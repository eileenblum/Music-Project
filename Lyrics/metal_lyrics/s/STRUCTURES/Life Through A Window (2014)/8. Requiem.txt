I just need you, now and forever more
I miss the sound of your feet on the floor
And I wish that I could see your face once more
I just need you, now and forever more
I miss the sound of your feet on the floor
I wish that I could see your face, and not your ghost, once more
Everyone is stained with some degree of endless pain
We're all alone in our own ways, excluded at our own pace
Growing restless to relate with a constant, stable, sub straight
Who the fuck am I supposed to come home to?
Like motivation for a lost cause
We're growing further and further from the first thought
It's aggravating (fuck) for the most of us
When life lets us settle with the dust
I feel lost, without you alive I've been spiralling down every fucking night
You're what ailed me (ailed me)
You're saved me from myself

So who the fuck am I supposed to come home to?
When all the colours fade to blue

I just need you, now and forever more
I miss the sound of your feet on the floor
And I wish that I could see your face once more
I just need you, now and forever more
I miss the sound of your feet on the floor
I wish that I could see your face, and not your ghost, once more

I will justify my weakened strength with a classic hate
I will justify my weakened strength with a classic hate
It pains me to bury all the things that relate to me
To lose the only one who put faith in me
To let the world take what was meant for me
And I swear you were meant for me

Lost, without you alive I've been spiralling down every fucking night
I feel lost, without you alive I've been spiralling down
I wish you could catch me now
I will justify my weakened strength with a classic hate
I evolved by mistake
(I still need you)
I will justify my weakened strength with a classic hate
I evolved with pain
(I still need you...)
