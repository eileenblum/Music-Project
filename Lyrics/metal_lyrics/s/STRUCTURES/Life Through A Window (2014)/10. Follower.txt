[feat. Adrian Fitipaldes of Northlane]Can we just let it all go?
Forget what was said
I'm losing control of my body and soul, and my head is drifting away
As black fades to red, a voice calls out to me
"You wanna do it again?"
You like the taste of fire burning through like cancer?
Whatever you desire, acquire it!

We're all capable of being what we want to
So which side are you on?
You tread so lightly on a line in the sand and if you
Can't decide then you're already gone
I am the cure
Where in this moment, all your dreams are certainties
What you say is so discerning I just wish I was dead
But I'll never experience
The emotion that comes with a separation from the head to the spirit of the body

I can't speak
I can't breathe
But in this moment
My mind is an ocean waiting for the calm before this storm
"You wanna do it again?"
You like the taste of fire burning through like cancer?
What ever you desire, acquire it!

I told you the world is yours to keep, as long as you're still sleeping
But I am the cure, I am the remedy
You left me here again
You left me here again
Dependence is a friend
Dependence is a friend
Alone until the end
Alone until the end
Dependence is a friend, so take your leave and go
Can we just let it go?
Can we just let it all go?
'Cause we forget the words we said
This picture was worth a thousand memories
Before you smudged our faces

Our minds erasing, before our eyes
Our minds erasing, before our eyes
I told you the world is yours to keep, as long as you're still sleeping
But I am the cure, I am the remedy
You left me here again
You left me here again
Dependence is a friend
Dependence is a friend
Alone until the end
Alone until the end
Dependence is a friend, so take your leave and go
