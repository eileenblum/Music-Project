This time, we'll reach for the sky.
Our lives will be our safe place
Where every instant of love will be with me,
Forever with me.

Every memory ends with me, it can't be forgotten.
We've been waiting for everything,
And it stays with me, makes me feel anything.
One day we'll rest our heads, and you will see.
