Now climbing mountains on the verge of the fall,
But looking backwards in time,
I could feel the walls about to break.
And losing devotion in time has meant there will be nothing left for me.

We are the solution.
Breathe, breathe in the bright,
Breathe in the sight.
Breathe in, it's all around you.
Breathe, breathe in the sight,
Breathe in the bright.
Prove that it's all around you.

We are the creation.
We are the solution to all.

And this indifference won't mean a fucking thing,
Because I am everywhere.

You thought you could survive this but now you've lost all motion.

Take this place, rip down the walls and make it yours.

I am the storm and here we go again.

Breaking down, I swear I'll tear you apart.

This indifference won't mean a fucking thing;
This is all just a feeble attempt at the sound.

Oh, haven't you heard that it's all just a matter of time?

Have I lost all faith in my mind?
No I told you, I told you, I told you a thousand times.

I told you a thousand times.

Never lay your dreams aside;
We've been losing the light.
Carried along still waters,
We're always losing our place in time.
This is all just a feeble attempt at the sound,
I've told you a thousand times.

Losing devotion in time, it's taking over our lives.

Breaking down, it's all just a matter of time.
It's just a matter of time.
