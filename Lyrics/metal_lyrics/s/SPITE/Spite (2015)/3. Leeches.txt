You can't be someone you're not.
Living a broke life through a broken screen.
Trying so fucking hard.
Slither you fucking snake.
Handed a gem you turned into slime.
Believing your own lies.
If life doesn't break you soon I will.
Whine and complain.
Shut your fucking mouth.
Consume and blame.
Expire motherfucker.
No one to back you up.
No one to give a fuck.
Cower like a rat when you take and take and can't pay the fuck up.
The stupid whore, she's all you have.
She fucks behind your back.
Spineless.
Stand straight without a back.
Why don't you go die like the frog looking fuck you are and croak.
Welcome to the real world.
Grow the fuck up.
Leeches.
Leeches.
Stay in the fucking distance you spineless bitch.
Stay in the fucking distance worth fucking shit.
Your life will fall apart.
Everything will break.
This is spite.
This is hate.
