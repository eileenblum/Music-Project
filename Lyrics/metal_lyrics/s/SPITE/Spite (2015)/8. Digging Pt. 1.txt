This is what you call a life?
Making sure that nothing is right
You fucking wretch
You fucking plague
Why did you do this to me?
Does it make you feel strong?
Do you feel like you belong?

You motherfucker
You fucking did this to me

and now Iâm lost at sea
Iâm not supposed to be
You fucking did this to me
Bring out the Devil in me
Walk home close the blinds shut the fucking door
Motherfucker I canât take this shit no fucking more
Give me more [4x]
I canât feel a thing anymore

My vision shakes
I grit my teeth
Whatâs it like underneath?

Pull up my shirt
Stare at my skin
This should be easy
The flesh so thin

Ripping and tearing
Deeper and deeper [2x]
Harder and harder [2x]
Take me to Hell [2x]

Deep in my veins
This will be painful
I want to die here
I want to die here and take you down to Hell with me

Iâm fucking digging [4x]

Take me to Hell
Soaking in blood
Take me to Hell
Iâm digging [2x]
