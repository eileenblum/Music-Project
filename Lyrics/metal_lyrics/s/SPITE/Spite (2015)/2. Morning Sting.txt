Eyes open.
The red draws out the white.
Get up, get up.
Try to remember last night.
Do you feel better?
Are you feeling alright?
Digging down to draw some blood just to see if I'm alive.
Spite.
A broken man, a dead machine, a bird with crippled wings.
Teased by life and born to did say "Fuck everything."
Fuck everything, burn everything, kill everything, destroy everything.
Fuck.
Burn.
Kill.
Destroy.
Morning sting.
Get up.
Nowhere to run.
Nowhere is safe.
A monster has awoken.
Down to your grave.
There is no hope for a better tomorrow.
Spill out your guts and spread your blood throughout the land.
There is no hope for a better tomorrow.
