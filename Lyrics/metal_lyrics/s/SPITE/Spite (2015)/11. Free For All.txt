I am the devil.
I just wanted what's worst for you.
I just wanted to hear you scream.
End this fucking world.
Human extinction.
This isn't self-hatred, this is hatred for all mankind.
Human extinction.
I've wanted this so fucking long.
Every man, every woman, every child.
We don't deserve any better.
We deserve to fucking die.
I am the snake.
I wanted what's worst for you.
Human extinction.
God has abandoned you.
Welcome to hell.
This is what
I've always wanted.
Welcome to hell.
Suffer in the flames with me.
Fuck.
Suffer in the flames with me.
Fucking free for all.
Survival of the fittest.
No morals, killing family.
Fucking free for all.
My friends become my next meal.
Long live the devil.
Long live the snake.
Today's the day that insanity took over me.
Today's the day that misery took the best of me.
Misery got the best of me.
Spite.
