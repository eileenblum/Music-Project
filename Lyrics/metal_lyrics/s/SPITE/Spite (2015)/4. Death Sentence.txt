No apologies
No goodbyes
Take the lustful fucker and hang him high
Scumbag, born from the mud
Raised by pigs
Personality of a fiend scavenger,
I think I've had enough
Take what isn't yours and I'll cut your fucking hands off
Do you have any decency?
So fucking broke you want a piece of me?
Took the one thing that I call mine
Used your dirty hands to tear apart my mind
I saw the way you looked in her eyes
I saw the way she looked in your eyes
Fuck the past and fuck the future
Fuck
I hope this feels torture
Wrap this rope around your neck and rot in hell
You make me fucking sick
Every breath you take is another mistake I've made
The fact I've let you live this long stings my very being
Do you have the fucking decency?
So god damn, broke you want a piece of me?
Took the one thing that I call mine
I swear I'm nervous, you're ready to die.
I want you to look in my eyes
Feel all of my hate before your demise
Fuck the past and fuck the future
Fuck
I hope this feels torture
Wrap this rope around your neck and rot in hell
You make me fucking sick
Spite,
Let me hear you scream it
Hey shit brains don't you get it?
This is who we are, get fucked if you tread it
See your family?
See your friends?
All here to see the way your pathetic waste of life
Ends
They never cared for you, she never wanted you
Sometimes we need someone awful to remind us who's been always true
You're a nobody
You are nothing
Look in my eyes,
I want to be the last thing you that see before you die
Wait till' I give the okay this moment is mine
Everything's mine,
So hang him high
This moment is mine
So hang him high
Watch his neck break
Swing,
Swing,
Swing,
Back and fourth,
Back and fourth
