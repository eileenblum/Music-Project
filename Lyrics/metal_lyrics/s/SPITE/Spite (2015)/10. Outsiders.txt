Rain fucking hell.
We are the ones who were rejected.
We are the ones who were told we were not good enough.
Turned away by the heavens.
Just for thinking for ourselves.
Turn the lights out.
Blacken.
Blacken.
Plotting our revenge.
Pull their eyes out.
Blacken.
Blacken.
Fuck the most high stay on the ground stand my ground.
There is no positive message.
There are no good intentions.
Get rid of all the brainwashed bullshit.
Dethrone the self-proclaimed kings and queens.
Fight them with rage.
Fight them with hate.
Hate.
Kill them with hate.
Rain all hell.
We'll leave the faithful faithless.
They never had any faith in us.
We'll leave the hopeful hopeless.
Branded by the flames.
Spite cult.
Let them see the end.
Let them see the fallen rise.
The ones you never gave a chance.
Was this your master plan?
I'm a sinner.
And I like it.
Doing wrong and dancing with my demons to this song.
I'm a sinner.
And God I love it.
Doing wrong and
I don't even give a fuck at all.
I'm a sinner.
Fuck it all.
I'm a sinner.
Cast me out.
I'm on the outside looking in.
Trapped in that hole in the sky you put yourself in.
Endless suffering.
The clouds engulfed by flames.
Burn forever.
