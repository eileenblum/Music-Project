Help me, help me!
I think I'm losing it
I can't see, I can't feel, everything is red
I think I'll kill myself, cut my wrist, wrap a noose around my fucking neck
No!
Things are quiet
I will not break me,
I'm trying to break you
A mother fucking sorry can not save you
Oh
You said fuck me?
No fuck you!
A mother fucking sorry will not save you any last words?
One last cry before I put you in the fucking dirt
I'm so sorry.
It's not enough!
Spite!
Snap!
There goes my brain
Snap!
There go your balls
Snap!
There goes my brain
Snap!
Everything goes
Everyone,
I despise everyone
Fuck you, eat shit, blackout, the world is a graveyard
All of you,
I will fucking kill off all of you
This is me, this is my, snap
Everyone,
I despise everyone
Fuck you, eat shit, blackout, the world is a graveyard
All of you,
I will fucking kill off all of you
This is me, this is my, snap
Get out of my head,
I think I'm losing it
Ugh!
Ugh!
Ugh!
Get out of my head,
I can't see,
I can't feel
Fuck!
Fuck!
Get out of my head, everything is red
Oh my God,
Oh my God!
Get out of my head,
I think I'm coming down,
I think I'm coming down,
I think I've snapped!
Snap!
Blow out my fucking brains!
Snap!
Blow out my fucking brains!
Die!
Snap!
