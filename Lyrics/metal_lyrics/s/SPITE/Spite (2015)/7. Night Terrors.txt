3 A.M.
Youâre not supposed to be here
This isnât the me you know
The hole you couldnât fill
The beast you couldnât tame
A room full of death but I feel so alive

Take it in [2x]
The room gets smaller for every tick of the clock
You can hear your organs throb
The silence cuts deep as your eyes begin to peel at the sight of me pushing a blade into the guts of a man

His dying breath
He looks at you
Youâre covered in your own puke adding to the filth of the room
Searching for an escape
Youâre already too late
I never wanted this for us but fuck youâve seen too much

Iâve fought too long to keep the spiders quiet in my brain
If it werenât for your disrespect you wouldnât know Iâm insane
A picture perfect world only exists in your dreams
I did my best to keep you safe I love you still but fuck it all
You fucking ruined this it's all your fault
If you werenât such a nosey bitch this wouldnât be happening at all
I guess Iâm better off alone and thatâs alright with me
If you have to die tonight then thatâs alright with me

Every person has someone out there that they want dead
The urge to fight the urge to kill we just donât act on it
You spineless cowards you are all fucking guilty at mind
Itâs fucking on motherfuckers so whoâs next in line?

Run

You fucking cowards
Fucking run
Iâm gonna pick you off one by one [2x]
So run

Run as fast as you can
I will not stop until I cut the throat of every man
I want everyone dead [2x]
I will not stop until I claim the life of every fucking man
So run
Run [3x]

A perfect world only exists in your dreams
I sit and wait [2x]
A perfect world only exists in your dreams
I sit and rot [2x]
I sit and wait
I sit and rot
I waste away

I waste away and wait for you
