Woke up today with a hole in my chest
(God dammit)
I woke up today

Tearing pictures apart both physical and in my brain
Cut you up and spit you out just like you did to me
I woke up today with a hole in my chest
You woke up today feeling your best

Hopeless
So hopeless
I hate this
Don't even care if I die here
Just die here
Let me die here
Nothing left but all the madness
Pure madness
Black clouds in the sky
No color in my eyes
The sadness
Utter sadness
No stars at night
Consumed by spite
A rage I can not fight

Empty room
White walls
All alone
All alone
Broken glass
Red walls
You're not there
I'm not there

Your soul is mine to take
Your heart is mine to break
In order to heal my ache
Your life I have to take

Fuck their lies
and fuck yours too
I never want to be a part of a tale so untrue
Made out to be the Devil
Made out to be a snake
Our beats were in sync they made us this way

All that time I've never cared so much for something
All my life I've never hated this much for someone
I guess I was meant to be this way
A man now a monster
I've gone insane
Ah fuck me

Call me the devil and ill play the part
I'll rip your whole fucking life apart
