I hope you choke
I hope you cry
I hope they leave you alone in your own shit to die
I hope it hurts
I hope it hurts
I hope there's a life after death so you can burn forever

Burn
(Fucking burn)
[2x]
Are you really what you say you're all about?
Your pictures fall down and your lights burned out
Your lights burned out
Your soul dies out

They'll walk away and leave you bleeding
Dead or barely breathing
The thought so God damn pleasing
Keep screaming

Die

I hope you choke
I hope you cry
I hope they leave you alone in your own shit to die
I hope it hurts
Yeah I hope it hurts
I hope there's a life after death so you can fucking burn

I wrote this song in spite of you
(You can fucking burn)
[3x]

I wrote this song in spite of you [2x]

Spite

In spite of you
