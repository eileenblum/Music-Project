Tell me what exactly are you thinking?
Think this might be a good time to be brave?
Well tonight my remorse went missing
Gone while I was out digging your fucking grave

Rot in filth

Rot
Rot you fucking piece of shit
Rot in the fucking dirt

I can't take it
I want to do more
I want to play with you
I want to make you unrecognizable
I want to fucking pick you apart
I want to taste your fucking heart
My own personal work of art
Hold still I'm trying to concentrate
God dammit you're not listening
Motherfucker fucking listen to me

Welcome to Hell
