Close the blinds
Close the blinds
Fucking shut the door
Motherfucker I can't take this shit no fucking more
Lost my faith
Lost my way
I entered hell today
The only place I feel at home so fuck it

I think ill stay here
I think ill disappear
Stick a nail through your head so you can't fucking hear
Spilling out my veins
Bashed in your fucking brains
Both lost our heads but only one of us was teasing

Wait a minute
Wait a second
I'm not fucking done
I'm making cuts
I'm poking holes
I'm pulling out your fucking guts
Hello, hello? Are you there? Wake the fuck up
Look in my eyes
Feel the hate before you fucking rot

Misery [2x]
Stay away
Misery [2x]
Get the fuck away
Misery [2x]
Run away
Misery [2x]
Stay the fuck away
Misery [2x]
Stay away
Misery [2x]
Get the fuck away
Today's the insanity took over me
Today's the day that misery got the best of me

I lost all my friends and my family
I lost the only one I love
Shunned by the light
Accepted my the dark
Before I go I'll leave my mark

Negative head
Negative soul
Raging heart
Ruined by you
Vengeful heart

Dead [3x]
All of my hopes
Dead [3x]
All of my love
Dead [3x]
All that I hate
Dead [3x]

Fuck

Fuck you
Fuck me
Fuck all of you
