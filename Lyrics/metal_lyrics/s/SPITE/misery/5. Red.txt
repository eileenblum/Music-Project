Never test a man who's lost his faith
Never test a man who's lost his way
Wary of the man who's eyes are dead
Wary of the man who sees you in red

Never test a man who's lost his way
Never test a man who's lost his faith
Wary of the man who's eyes are dead
My fucking eyes are dead
I fucking see you in red
