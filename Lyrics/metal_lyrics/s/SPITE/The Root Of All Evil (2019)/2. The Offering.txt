O', mighty one,
I bow down to thee as an offering
Take full control of me â rahh!

Satan, accept myâdevotion,
Holdâclose my soulâas I take zeal in thisârole
Commit, submit â oh, the power we hold
All who oppose shall smolder in the hole â roh!

(Overcome with cold sweats and shakes
I awake with numb nerves and headaches
The muscle-twitch, the nervous itch
Something's wrong but no one listens)

Starving, but I can only stare
It's my curse to bare â what's the point if no one fucking listens?

(Someone, help me â get it out of me)
Don't breathe
I scream, "Kill me!"

(The voice that tells me:)

I have hell to pay â won't let me be
The demon I see is just a reflection of me
If this is "OK", then I don't want to be
I can't come to terms with who I am in my sleep

Collapsing embraces
Foundations held in fragile but determined hands
But there's a turn away, a pull from me, the going against
The accusation of everything I never wanted to be as a man â go!

I didn't say that, I never did that
Put words in my mouth and a bloody blade in my palms
(I wasn't even there)
I'm still in my bed, just stuck in that nightmare

Now hold on, just wait a minute, now think for a second
Take a big step back, ask yourself the question:

What the fuck are you capable of?
The brutal slaughter of everyone you love
What can you say when your hand fits the glove?
This is the absence of god above

(This is the absence of god above
This is the absence of god above)
(I was simply a vessel to be controlled
Born to destroy, I take on the role)

Yes, this is who I am â urghh!
Bear witness to the Antichrist spawning to reverse creation
Worship, worship â all who oppose
Shall smolder in the hole â eternal death â face your damnation

(Aghh!
Aghh!)
(O', mighty one, I present to thee
Embrace and behold the trophy of souls)
The absence of god above

Urgh! (Urgh!, â¦)
