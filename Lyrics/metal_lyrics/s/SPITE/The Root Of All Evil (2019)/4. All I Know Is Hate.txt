(God, grant us the serenity
To accept the things we cannot change,
Courage to changeâtheâthings we can,
And wisdom to know the difference) Oh! Yeah!

[Guitar solo]

I'mâsick of living here with you

I'm sick of your face, and I'm sick of the trade
The older I grow, it seems the more I'm in pain
I never asked to be this way
Fuck 'em all â death to all â all I know is fucking hate

What a fucking day it's been
Blood, sweat, and tears â I was made for this
I can taste all my faults from the cuts on my lips
The sensation of my hands gripping hard into a fist

Cheers to letting go
A sober man is a man I don't want to fucking know
Neck up, all my vessels pop â all judgment fades away
The better you is dead â I'm the hunter and the prey
I'm sick of living here with you, I'm sick of this place,
I'm sick of your grace â burn forever â my soul lives in the flames
Promise that you're all about to die today
Fuck you all, kill you all â all I know is hateâ¦

And to take as I please
Blurred red is all that I see
My desire to make them all bleed
Will completely take over me â all I know is fucking hate

(Hate, hate, hate
All I know is fucking hate
Oh!)
Oh! I'm sick of living here with you (Oh!)

All the back and forth and ridicule
Sick of all the guilt trips that you always have to put me through
The older I grow, the stronger the pain
This is who I'm meant to be â fuck you all, death to all

(All I know is) hate
The old me is dead, never to return
I tied him up with rope,
Weighed him down with stone, and threw him overboard into the sea

He's never coming back
