Remember this?
Hole through the wall â bet your ass I was fucking pissed
Deliberate
Uh! You got one Iâwon'tâbe ruined too, soânow
Glass sinks in the bottomsâof my feet
I let it sting and the blood seep
You'll no longer get the best of me
Yeah!

My ears crack at the sound
Your yells rang loud, and I can't stay silent
I don't miss you; I will never go back
You will reach, and I'll fight back

All you've ever been is an attack â ah!

There's no love in getting beaten to shit
Pushing me towards death â I don't want any part of this
Ah!

I don't want a part of this

[Guitar Solo]

Take the shot â you'll miss â rghh!

Remember this?
Egh! Running around while you shut me down â I'm less
Deliverance
Seems to be the only way to get your acceptance

Oh, the fucking nerve

Years later, fucking hit my line
Have you thought about the toll of the abuse on my mind?
Back down memory-lane â let's take a fucking ride
Remember this?

(Push me, push me) The thing is,
(Push me, push me) God will forgive me for the things that I've done.
(Push me, push me) You?
God doesn't give a shit about you

Fuck your jealousy, fuck this tug of war
Fuck the highs â can't take the lows â my heart forever sore
My body turns volcanic â live life in constant panic
I'll dedicate my days killing God, so you'll never be forgiven

Oh!
