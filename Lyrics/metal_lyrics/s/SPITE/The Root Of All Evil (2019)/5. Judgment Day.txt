Urghh!
(Rghh!)

Hypocrites, it's fucking judgment day
Uh!

Uh! First mistake
Last mistake

No chance to grow up
No chance to learn
Like you haven't had a slip up
In your entire fucking life

You're such a perfect example
How I love to watch the high and mighty get buried under shit

Pick and choose who is accountable
For the same actions we all commit

With my foot through your head,
The ground starts to bleed
Your face now one with the dirt
It's judgment day â roh!

With my foot through your head,
The ground starts to bleed
Your face now one with the dirt
Smoosh

It's fucking judgment day
