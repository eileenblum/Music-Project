("I'm not here to make you happy.
I'm not here to brighten your dismal day.
I am here to end your miserable fucking life."

"All and all, you had a pretty good run.
Deep down inside, you must have known it had to end somewhere.
Might as well be here, might as well be now,
And it might as well be with me."

"I'm not crazy; I'm in control.
I'm not crazy; I'm in control. I'm not crazy; I'm in control.
I'm not crazy; I'm in control. I'm not crazy; I'm in control.
I'm not crazy! Fuck! Fuck!")
