(All of you are just the same,
Always looking for something you can take) Mrghohh!

Mrgh! All of youâareâjust the same,
Alwaysâlooking (Yeah!) for something you can take
AndâI've got something to say,
Some fighting words from the monster that's gone insane

Yeah, I know what I'm about,
So here I am on this stage â I'll shout

I've checked myself into prison
Murder in the first degree of this industry
Handouts and pass-outs, cop-outs and cash-outs
Fuck that shit you wanna hear and fuck the music to your ear

Just a broken man
Crack the shell, burn me out, take advantage, then
Chew me up and spit me out
Realness and truth can be a hard pill to swallow

Sick of the dick-rides and the come-and-go trends
Sick of copy-catted shit â all your songs start to blend
Too fed up and tired â got no time to make amends
This game's fucking dead â R-I-Put to an end

(Man, mother-fuck you all)
Oh!

(Dehumanize me) Pay your dues
(Dehumanize me) Pay your respects
(Dehumanize me) Pay with what, motherfucker?
I fucking paid it all (Dehumanize me)

Treated like I'm in a fucking zoo, a caged beast
Do I owe you something? Dance, monkey, dance
I won't empower your privilege nor respect your perspective
This team's gone AWOL, and we're gunning for you all

Uh!

And still these fuckers wanna be like me
Think they can verbally slaughter and flip that switch like me, yeah!
Well imitation is all I see
Watch and learn, 'cause second best is the best you can be

Because all of you are just the same,
Always looking for something you can take
And I will hunt you all like game â fun in the chase
Another neck to break
