(Urghh!)

Rahh!

(Better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven)
(Better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven)

Yeah,âI'm the dangerous one
Stepped out ofâline with an open mind
Don't ask for a reason why;
Could be the look on your fucking face
This heaven,
Is that where you think you all go?
A forgotten face when the month ends,
And you're rotting below

What makes you qualified?
Keep your head so high
You've always been against me,
And I'm already me against me
I've been neglected, objected
Once the sideline-waste
Make you spit up your guts
Tell me: how does it taste?

Slaves
(You're all just the same)
Slaves
(You'll now know my pain)
Slaves
I guess I'm just doomed
I see you in red,
So I bust in the room

Exploding sound of your oncoming death
Everybody hit the floor - Hell has no exit door
You feeling tall? Think you can save them all?
Pop pop pop! They drop - I'm gonna take them all

And when I'm done, my face will be remembered
And when I'm done, my name will live forever
You'll be another statistic
Now isn't that twisted? How fucking sadistic

Eghh!

Now all the people jump to flood their feeds
Opinions and arguments like they mean a damn thing
Your thoughts and prayers disgrace their families
God wasn't there nor here, so fuck all your beliefs

I'm coming for you, and there are more like me
So get on your knees like the rest and scream

Die
Spite
Spite

Motherfucker

(Kneel for heaven
Yell beyond the-)
