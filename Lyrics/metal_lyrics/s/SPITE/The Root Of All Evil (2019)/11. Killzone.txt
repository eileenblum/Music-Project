Raghh! (Urghh!)
Raghh!

Global shutdown â apocalyptic orange surrounds
The panicking ensues as the ground meets the sky
KOBK â think fast â you knowâtheâdrill
A dying worldâon lockdown is a worldâin which I thrive

I can feel my blood boiling

(Killzone) The only emotion valid is rage

No time to cry
No time to sympathize
Get them in line
Lead the masses to a worldwide flat line

Make this decision
Is it going to be you or them?
If you even have this choice,
Then you have the upper hand
No hesitation
Strike as fast as you can
If you have the jump on them,
They will not stand a chance

Weak with emotion,
Burdened by compassion
Their sentimental state
Throws them straight in death's direction
(Frailty)
Do away with the weak
You will be the first to go on
This day of reckoning â rah!

There's no reward for rectitude

The ones who survive are the ones who kill

(Ah!)

(I was never stuck in here with them;
They were stuck in here with me)

Urghh!
Killzone â the final two standing
I will survive â the reason why

I do not cry, do not sympathize
You're on the wrong side of the knife, and I'm desensitized

Urghh! With this one, I can pick him apart
And take my time
With this one, I can drain all the blood
Until his veins run dry
Spite
