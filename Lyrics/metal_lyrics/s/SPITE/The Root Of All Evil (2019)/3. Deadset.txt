Dead set
Yeah!
You dead set, ugly fucking whore

Dead bitch, what do you want from me?
Gotta get yourâfilthyâhands in everything
Yeah, deadest â always a hella big scene
Ticking time bomb â fuck away â you ain't blasting me
Booze-cruise through Bay Area hills
Gotta get home fast so you can pop a couple white pills
Shot people doing shot shit
Natural selection â take place â get that bitch fucking killed

What the fuck's the matter with you?
Wake up â messed up
You could never really give a fuck, could you? No
Uh!
Break bad â I'll watch a bitch choke
Spare me the trouble
But Goddamn do I wish I could it myself

Dead set â excuse after excuse
Tell me what I wanna hear â mrghh!
Should have listened when I said to shut your fucking mouth
You have no place â piss off five-hundred miles down south
(Sensitive subject alert)
Stupid fucking games have stupid fucking prizes
I've been down this road before
You made a mess on my floor, now you're spilling up â clean it up

You wanna sit with the king?
You want the love, want the fame, you want everything?
Do you know what it takes?
All the sacrifice to stay ahead in this race?
Roll over in pain
Sew your lips shut; fuck your opinion on anything
Wanna take me off stage?
Go against me at my own fucking play?

Dead set
(How you gonna embarrass yourself like that in front of all your peers?)
Dead set
(Burn all your bridges, cut your ties, straight-fuck your career)
Dead set
(I don't wish you well â there's a reason you're not here)
Dead set
(Rghh! I'd do it myself, but you're already)
Dead set

Dead bitch
Oh!
Yeah, fuck it up

[Guitar solo]

(Dead set) You wanna sit with the king?
You want the love, want the fame, you want everything?
(Dead set) Do you know what it takes?
All the sacrifice to stay ahead in this race?
(Dead set) Roll over in pain
Sew your lips shut, fuck your opinion on anything
(Dead set) Wanna take me off stage?
Go against me at my own fucking play?

(Dead set) (Roll over in pain)
(Dead set) (Do you feel the same? You fucking hate me? You wanna come at
me, then come at me
(Dead set) (Loyalty always lies)
(Dead set) Oh! I'd do it myself, but you're already-
