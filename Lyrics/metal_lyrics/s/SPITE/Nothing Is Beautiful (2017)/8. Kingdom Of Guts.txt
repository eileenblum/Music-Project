A new world where oceans run red
Structures are made from stacked and sewn limbs
Consequence of a life and foundation made from dead gods and a rotting old book
I brought down the sky
Tore a hole in the clouds and pulled the angels from their thrones
I made peace with hell
Become one with the devil and one with the snake
With broken wings and dead lights
The "blessed" now face the unfortunate and the damned
Stare into the face of those you have forsaken
The everlasting life you were promised was a lie
You did this to yourself
You're not "blessed"
You're fucking spoiled
You forgot about those who were born to die
Fuck a god that plays favorites
Do as I say or you're not welcome in my gates
Believe in me or you're not welcome to the holy land
What about those who were never exposed?
Doomed from birth
God forbid
I fucking think for myself
Fuck no
I refuse
I refuse
Religion where a killer
Can pray on his death bed for forgiveness
And is welcome to the light
But a good man without faith
Is casted like trash to the dark
This is why I'm fucking faithless
Fuck a god that plays favorites
I created a new life after death
Welcome to the kingdom of guts
Where actions have a consequence
Death is eternal
Live forever in agony
This is where you belong
This is where you belong
I created this monster
I am abominable
Cut them up yeah cut them up
Welcome to the kingdom of guts
Eat shit
Eat shit
Put your fucking face in it
Every action has a fucking consequence
