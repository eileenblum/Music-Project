Diving deep into the depths of my mind
Abysmal thoughts that haunt me in the night come to life
Obsessing over brutality, violence directing my morality
Starve the helpless, torture the innocent
Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up
There is no fucking God your dumb ass really thought
Close your eyes and fold your hands recite this ancient prayer
Worship this invisible entity and blessed be your family
If he loved you so much then question his mistake
If there really is a God then why would he create me?
God fearing when you should fear me
Abomination Jesus for the rich
Jesus for the privileged
Oh what a fucking luxury it just be
Holding on to your imagination past ten years of age
So tell me, do you wanna have some fun?
So tell me, do you wanna see some blood?
The best parts of life benefit number one
The one you idolize died a slave
He chose to break
You got me fucked up if you think
I'll ever bow to someone's power trip held together by child-like ideals
Pay attention (to me)
Offer everything (to me)
Throw a fit when things don't seem to go my way
Get fucked
Old T for those who pray to an angry God
The new T for those who kneel to a "loving" god
There is a story for whatever the fuck helps your case
Do me a favor and pray he ends the human fucking race
Abomination, annihilation, obliteration, extermination
While your head's in the clouds, mine's trapped in a cell
While you look to the skies, I'm in my personal hell
Nothing to lose in a world where nothing is beautiful
There is only hate, black and gray executes all vision of hope
I feel like I'm dying and I have no reason for holding on
The pain so sharp
Cut, cut
Slice away [4x]
Crippling depression
The room is falling apart on me
I exhaust myself to breathe
No endgame, dry heaving
No fucking purpose, pointless freedom
An infinity of agony, help me, help me
I'm screaming, I'm screaming
Just fucking end me, I don't wanna live amidst all this misery
Just when you think you found peace
Just when you think things might be okay
Remember one thing:
That nothing is beautiful
Nothing is beautiful [2x]
Nothing [3x]
Spite!
