Scraping by in this cesspool, take your life's worth, wipe your ass with it
Makes me fucking sick, look down at me forget the word "respect"
An over abundant feeling of self-importance, you're all full of shit
Everyone's wearing someone else's face
Blindly following rusted traditions, afraid of everything
I am so fucking over it, I am over human life
I hate the sound of you breathing
I hate that you're alive, so fucking die I've embraced my imperfections, I'll do with the world as I will
The hunt is on, I can taste you on my tongue
Turn me on, I want to feel you panic
I want to feel your anxiety keep screaming, keep screaming for me
Are you afraid?
Have you ever even thought that you might go this way?
Know that you'll die at my pleasure, salivating
I can smell it, fresh meat aroused by violence I'm fucking hard just knowing you're in anguish
Touching myself to the stench of your fear
Pushing farther using every orifice for satisfaction
Pink and red, pink and red, pink and red!
Spilling out your head, pink and red, I want you fucking dead I've thought it over 1000 times, all the ways I can cross this line
I want to rip my way inside
End your shitty excuse of a fucking life
Die! I'm fucking going to hell to sit at the side of Satan
But before I'm dragged beneath the dirt, I'll erase every trace of you I'll kill your family; I always hated them
Set fire to your dreams and piss on the ashes
Slaughter your friends just for knowing your name
And when I'm done with them
You're fucking next!
