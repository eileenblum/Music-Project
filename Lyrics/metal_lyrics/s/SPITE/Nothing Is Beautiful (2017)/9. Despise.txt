I'll end up in the dark but I accepted my fate the day I learned of my rage,
I know my way around this place taking names and reserving seats in oblivion. Go!

Hell waits for you
Take the cross you love so much
Lick it all around
Set it on fire
Turn it upside down
And shove it up your fucking cunt!
Shove it up your fucking cunt
Yeah!
Shove it up your fucking cunt
Fuck!
Jesus Christ, feet-first, going up your fucking... cunt!
I try to find a reason
Amen,
Amen!
Another dumb bitch bites the fucking dust!
I swallowed my hatred for five fucking years
Sitting in rejection, indignation
Yeah!
Opening your trap doesn't give you any kind of privilege
You're nothing fucking special!
Holy child
A rotting pile
Another waste of fucking life
Fuck you fucking both!

Fuck you fucking both!
Do you kneel the same way when sucking dick to say your fucking prayers?
Hung crucified, perished in agony, so you can spawn more fucking scum
I wish you endless pain

I wish you endless pain!
The Father, the Son, the Holy who-gives-a-fuck?
Can we lay this shit to rest?
Take the nails from your hands and from your feet
And drag them in your coffin for eternity
