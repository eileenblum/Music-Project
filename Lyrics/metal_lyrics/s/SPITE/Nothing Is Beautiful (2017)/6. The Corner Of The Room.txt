I'm peering straight down at myself
In this place we are 2 of 3
We are not alone, I can sense the presence of evil
I'm cold stiff, I'm petrified
In the ceiling, in the wood, in the walls
He hisses, he laughs, he makes himself known to me
I'm shaking, he's coming close
Not knowing who is real, I ask myself
What do I do? [2x]
He looked into my eyes and said don't breathe
