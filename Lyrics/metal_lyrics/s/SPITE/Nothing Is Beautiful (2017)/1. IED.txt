Spite cult motherfucker!

I've made plans for the end (this is the end)
I'm cutting all my ties (I am the end)
Feel all hearts collapse in my own hands
I am the earths demise
Motherfucker
Everybody wants something from me
No respect they just take everything
I want to squeeze their eyes out
I want to squeeze their eyes out
Fuck
Stay fucking angry
Misery
Misery
Get the fuck away from me
Act on impulse
Pissed off and violent I'm taking this out on you
Push my thumbs deep into your eyes
I can feel your brains (I'm not insane)
Oozing in my hands (I'm not insane)
I want to eat your brains (I'm not insane)
I WANT TO BREAK YOUR FUCKING FACE
And now I sit here with a mans whole life buried under my finger nail
And now I sit here picking his memories from between my teeth
And there's nothing wrong with me
There's nothing
