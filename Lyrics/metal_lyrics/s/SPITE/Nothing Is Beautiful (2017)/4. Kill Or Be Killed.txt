It's kill or be fucking killed
Give it up
Exhausted from pathetic fucking try-hards disgracing the hustle
A bunch of narcissistic look-at-me's false claiming the rulers throne
Do you have a single thing to offer that's not a trend or that has not been done before?
Another complaint
Over saturating my home
You had made yourself a sheep
These fuckers always want to be a victim
So come one let's put their blood on the table
I would rather lead the pack of wolves
Weed out the weak let them make our bellies full
It's kill or be fucking killed
No room to inhale
Leave nothing for you scavenger fucks
I am not flattered
I am honestly fucking insulted
So fuck off
I am king of this jungle and I sentence you to death
I am leader of this pack and we are hunting
We are aiming for your fucking neck
Carefully crafted social personas
Do you even know who the fuck you are?
Another no one trying to get a play at my game
Fuck out of my face you're entitled to nothing
People pleasers
Ass kissers
And fucking leeches
Are not welcome in this cult
We are all-seeing
Soul-eating
Fear-nothing beings
Walk with me
This is the outsiders' rise
Let the weak ones all die
