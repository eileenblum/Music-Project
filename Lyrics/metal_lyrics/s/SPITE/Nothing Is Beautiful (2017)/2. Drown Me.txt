I trapped myself here with all eyes locked on me
Except the ones that I adore (that I adore)
I can't speak, I lash out
Find me convulsing on the fucking floor
Stare at the wall and strain until my head explodes
'Cause no ones coming through that fucking door
Fuck, no, God dammit, no!
(No!) Don't give a fuck how you're feeling
(No!) Don't give a fuck about what you have to say
Don't care if someone has it worse than me
Tomorrow does not hold a better day
I'll do whatever it takes to make you look at me that way again (just look at me)
To make you lost in me like I'm lost in you
I'll do whatever it fucking takes
To ruin, to haunt you
To make you lesser, to break you the fuck down,
Irrelevant, isolate
Last night I put my belt around my neck
But I'm still here, still a fucking wreck
I guess I'm just selfish; I needed something permanent
I'll no longer be degraded; I'll just decompose
Terrible memories in once wonderful places
I can't seem to find the the beauty in anything anymore
Drown me in the ocean you hold on your eyes
Drown me [3x]
Drown me, fucker
Drown me [3x]
Yeah this is how I'll fucking die
Hold my head under wet lying lips
Kiss me goodbye (goodbye)
Kiss me goodbye
