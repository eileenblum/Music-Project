Completing this extensive work results in your death
Even worse for death I will welcome the monstrosities exposed to my
Earthly mind
Not ready to leave my world behind
My soul will be devoured if I read these lines

Inconvenient precautions imprison me solitarily

Incomprehensible lines of narration not fully explicit
Moral conflict to unleash this rage upon the masses

Examine by trial and error
Tenaciously grasping its meaning
The true horror unveils itself as curtains of death are lifted

Unearthly development unfolds before my weary eyes
Reasons that are now completely obvious
Repeating itself upon ages of mankind
Unstoppable
Unleash this rage upon the masses

My movements totally uncontrollable
Speechless my visions flashing over heaps of lines
Connecting dots never meant to be united
Finally a flash sculpture of the grand design

Struggling against my final sleep, forever dark
Light forsakens me as I become the last forsaken
To ensure the abominable continuation
