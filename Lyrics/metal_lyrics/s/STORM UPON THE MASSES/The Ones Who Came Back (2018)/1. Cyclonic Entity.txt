Finally I reached the end of my human existence
Moments before I become a witness to the grand scheme
A lifelong inclination to an existence of nothingness
Banishment to nonexistence for this cyclonic entity

The meaning of my choices momentarily in my grasp
Just long enough to slip away into a black void

Hate rages like untamed fire through my eyes
Blood lust crawls up my utter deformed anatomy
All ends in nothing
As far as the eye can see, only one thing lingers
A deafening silence no one will look upon
The slaughtering ends in absolute horror
As the dark fills this inclination for nothingness

My last vision of this grim episode is one of infinite proportions
For this deadly history will endlessly regurgitate into darkness
The meaning of my choices momentarily in my grasp
As my last steps are consumed in the horrifying dark
All ends in nothing
As far as the eye can see, only one thing lingers
A deafening silence no one will look upon
The slaughtering ends in absolute horror
As the dark fills this inclination for nothingness
Banishment to nonexistence for this cyclonic entity
