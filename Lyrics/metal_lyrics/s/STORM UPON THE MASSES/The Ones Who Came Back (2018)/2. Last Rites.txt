Junction at the end of your existence
You will never walk this earth no more
The paradox of life and evil
Is a natural being of your surrounding

My guidance will relieve you from this unbearable torment
But I can also immerse you into an atrocious abyss

You look pale, scared and sick
All that is sacred and safe has long forsaken your world
The darkest hour is near
Prepare to die alone
As you stand here beside me on this crossing
As I burn my message in your wretched soul

Release the horror from the darkest of the pit
For aeons of old it has been foretold

Release your very last sigh
So you can slowly close your eyes
Beware your soul will never rest
And restless it will remain
Until the end of time with countless nights
These, worthless human, are your last rites

No god you pray to
No god you worship
Stands here beside you to watch over your wretched soul
Until the end of time...fear the darkest night
Your false existence will never be heard from again
Worthless human
