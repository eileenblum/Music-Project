Soil breaks, horror overtakes
Wrecking havoc spreading mayhem
Devouring rage
Carnage upon mankind
Feasting on corpses

Absurdity has become insatiable need to feed
As ancient creatures crawl the earth
As you try to run, escape is impossible
Normality reduced to ashes
The world is overrun

Hunger grows, blood flows
Humans fear, death is near
Carnage will never stop until all life is destroyed
Behold its final stage as you witness your doom
The infestation has begun
The world is overrun

False god, pray and behold
False god, your kingdom will fall

Descend from a world beyond
They breed death and destruction

The ones who came back
