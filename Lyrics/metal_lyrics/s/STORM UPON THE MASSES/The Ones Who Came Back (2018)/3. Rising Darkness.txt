Servants of the black wait patiently in total silence
Hidden from the feeble eye
Called upon to proclaim illumination

Tolerant to the ignorant
Insuperable decadence peeling reality from their skin
Until nothing is left but shear frenzy, shrouded in bones and your blood

Rise
Behold the downfall of mankind
Darkness controls your world, your fragile world
Mighty destroyers of light come from the gateway
Mighty destroyers of light rise to become

Rise
Blackened earth now condemned
Hail to this new order
Rising darkness
The servants of the black
Darkness rising
Darker than black

Servants of the black wait patiently in total silence
Hidden from the feeble eye
Called upon to proclaim illumination
To enslave the impure

Darkness rising
Rising darkness
Enslave the impure
