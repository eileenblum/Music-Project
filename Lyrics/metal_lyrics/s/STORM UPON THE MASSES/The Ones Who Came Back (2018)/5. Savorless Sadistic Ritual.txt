Detach from what you believe in
What you have been calling hope
Wasted years of false truth
Sadistic ritual
Burn the souls of his throne
They are all useless, false and weak
Through mighty fire and light
Sadistic ritual

I will rebuild my heresy
Behold the grand dark legacy
Beware my true identity
I am your sadist king
My time will bring you glory
I am your soul devourer

No comfort, no one is by your side
There is no longer one to believe in
While you slowly walk the darkened path
The blackened hordes come to arise

I will rebuild my heresy
Behold the grand dark legacy
Beware my true identity
I am your sadist king
My time will bring you glory
I am your sadist king
I am your soul devourer

Detach from what you believe in
What you have been calling hope
I answer to your prayers now, your false religion
You sold your worthless body
Your soul was mine to take
No one is by your side, yet silently you pray to him
Infidel

Savorless sadistic ritual
