Annihilation of inferior world
Damnation in seas of blood
Knights of fire ascend from hell
Black armies rise
Born to spread the holocaust
Flaming steel enslaves all flesh
Riders of apocalypse
Conquer and burn the existence

March, black lord conquerors
Assault inferior domain
Serpents from the darkest abyss
Glide over victim remains
Leftover remains

Arrows of fire lighting the skies
Where shadows and dark souls come gathering
Searching in the rising darkness
Through the path of immortality
Blazing viciously through ancient skies
Above your shining heaven the ancient unholiness arises

Black clouds devouring the souls of men
As your land turns to a mass grave
March on, black lord conquerors
Assault inferior domain

Black hordes of apocalypse
Ride in fire from the black storm
Under their spell plagues are cast
Slaughtered will be the flock
Massacre upon the void
Extremely venomous like a serpent strike

Dawn of holocaust
Annihilation by hordes of Armageddon
Lead by the sword
Victorious they ride
Assault inferior domain
