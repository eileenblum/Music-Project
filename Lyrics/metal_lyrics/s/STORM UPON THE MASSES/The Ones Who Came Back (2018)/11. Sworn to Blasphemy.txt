Perversions will prevail
Eternal light forever dark
Blackened, obscured
Sacrilegious reign of fire
For him to see the triumph of blasphemy

Sworn to blasphemy
The sign of suffering
The numbers six six six
Almighty massacre
Multitude of tortured angels

Relentless ravenous hordes
Who ride for retaliation
From beyond the gates they have now returned
To unleash his wrath upon the wretched flock of infidels
Raised high the horns of hell

Perversions will prevail
Eternal light forever dark
Blackened, obscured
Fallen infidels thrown into the pit
Burning crosses erect
Cursed father, master
Conqueror of the throne

Sworn to blasphemy
Cursed father, mighty one
Your throne reigns supreme
Raised high the horns of hell
