When free minds crossing blades with those corrupted.
Only then shall unsaturated wrath be fed.

With intolerant act of deception.
Imposters are claiming my faith.
An impotent fuck on a throne of illusion,
eager to infect me with their taint.
Impotent fuck bears the crown of illusion,
eager to infect me with pure taint.

Indeed illusions fool some.
But there is hardly peace in bought salvation.

Long have I endured your grave injustice.
Trying to dishearten me, 
in the chambers of unbearable malice.
Long have I endured your grave injustice.
Trying to dishearten me with your malice.

I'll never beseech false redemption!!
I won't fall into your self-destructive
religious circus!!!

Charlatan, I'll rather crush your world.
Expel you from your throne.
Desecrate your sanctuaries.
And break your masses down.

It's your own choice to be blind,
so don't drag me into your mistery.
