Slowly sending the world
towards utter destruction.
Millions of cultures is laid waste.
A filthy people are building an empire.
In human blood.

Torture and child rape.
Molested unmercifully.
Corrupted to their core.
Wealthy on the dead and the poor.

Blinded by a veil of religion.
Drugged by thousands of lies.
Walking around in darkness.
Believing it's their divine light.

True father of lies. A god of demise.

I am vengeance and I'll paint you red.
Until your eyes stares from death bed.
Beware of me, hear and fear.
The cloak of blood will be yours to bear!!

I smell blood, I feel pain, 
I hear the world complain.
With mankind as hostage, 
they force through their taint.
I see blood, I see greed,
a corrupt community, an evil seed.

You shall not intoxicate my mind!!!
