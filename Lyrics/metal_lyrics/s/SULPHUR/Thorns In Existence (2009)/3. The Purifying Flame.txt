Chiming bells marks the final battle began.
Heed the fury, the flame of Armageddon.
With hatred it burns and the church tremble.
The fire grows as crosses crumble.
Born to scorn the crown of thorns.
Follow the horns, and summon storms.
Ignite and tame the purifying flame.

Unleash hells fury!!!

With the abyss jaws stretched open.
Pouring rivers of fire out.
Dragon winged souls and demons,
we summon you, rise to the call.
Follow he who comes,
bearing the banner of their destruction.
Cutting hypocrisy from the coming history.
Follow he who comes,
bringing signs of their desctruction.
Towards the might of heaven we ascend.
The black forces in command.

This is the cure for the taint in men.
Let the world purify in flames.

Burn!!!

Chiming bells rages the struggle on.
We feed the hungry flame of Armageddon.
With hatred it burns through bloody rain and thunder.
Cries fills the night as heaven is torn asunder.

And then angels start to fall.
Myriads upon myriads, wings in flames.
Setting the sky ablaze.
Like stars they plunge towards the ground.
Crushing hard into earth.
Marking the new ages birth.
