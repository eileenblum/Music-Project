Arise.... Luna...

From horizon to horizon,
her endless journey unfolds.
Daughter of the night.
The eye of the world.

In many seducing forms she reveals herself.
Casting her lunatic spell.

I walk under the starlit sky 
looking at sapphires shining bright.
Luna Noctiluca!!!
A jewel in the night,
daughter of the night,
behold her glowing light.
As she climbs high, 
she is the beauty of the nightsky.
Reflected in the sea.
Luna you seduce me.
Goddess of purity, embrace me.
Your naked skin  arouse me
to the point of ecstasy.

Behold, she is glowing.
Luna is growing.
Seduce me with your rays of light.

And when the final night approaches.
The eternal sleep surrounds me.
I find comfort knowing.
I rest endlessly with thee.

Luna Noctiluca, behold the majesctic sight.
Luna Noctiluca, touch me with your rays of light.
