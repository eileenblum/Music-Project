Constructed by a force of corruption.
Invented visions of eternal salvation.
Vile lies lead the way to seduction.
A power well known to men.

To perform the alchemy.
Turning suffering into virtue.
Wrongdoings into righteousness.
Death becomes salvation.

Ignorant fools making claim on creation.

Invented visions of eternal salvation.
Is no escape from the reality of existence.
Such beliefs only clouds your mind.
Filth remains filth even thought gilt in gold.

The vortex is building strength.
Growing to tremendous heights.
Sending the world into a great spin.
Towards cursed times.
Where weak minds carves the way to extinction.
Here they crave for their weak idols.

Then the invented visions,
looks more like a confusing path
to infernal demnation.
