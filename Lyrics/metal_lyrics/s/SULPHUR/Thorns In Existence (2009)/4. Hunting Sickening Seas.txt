With serpent blood running in his veins.
The bringer of havoc,
revealer of dark secrets.
With a breath of sulphur.

With a curtain of illusion
he hunts the seas of mankind,
and cuts the tongue of the ignorant.
And destroys the worlds tyrants.

Ha has stalked the earth,
for ages past and ages to come.
Feared by the tainted mind.

A beast from ancient times,
wicked and without regret.
Cast into the world,
spawned to bring fear upon mankind.

Walking slowly the path towards destruction.
They forge their own destiny in flames!!!

He has stalked the earth
for ages past and ages yet to come.
Feared by the tainted mind,
spawned to burn down,
the thrones of all religious kind.
He comes with the storm
like lightning striking from the sky.
A beast from ancient time.
Hunting the seas of mankind.

With serpent blood, running in his veins.
He is the bringer of havoc.
Spell caster of hells magic.
But the wrath to dread more

Hunting the sickening seas of mankind.
