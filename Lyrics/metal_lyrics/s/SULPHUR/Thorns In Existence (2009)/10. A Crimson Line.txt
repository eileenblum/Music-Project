With invalid moral,
and insatiable hunger for power.
They created a god to lay claim on every soul.

From deep within the very source of madness,
the guileful is evoked.
Like a thorn in existence,
drawing a crimson line, towards the divine.

An extravagant creation.
Hidden behind a glorious reputation.
Paving the divine road with skulls.
The real impostor, a contaminator of souls.

For their god truly hated the world,
and all without faith in his kindness
was tortured and killed.
So his name unhindered would prosper.

Like a thorn in existence.
A crimson line towards the divine.

"Kneel before me humans!
Enslave the world in my name
and be rewarded with everlasting life."

And his followers so hated mankind.
Forsaking all common sense
they burned everyone doubting his divinity.
So all that followed never should perish,
but prosper and live as kings.
In an everlasting life
in an abhorrent heaven.
