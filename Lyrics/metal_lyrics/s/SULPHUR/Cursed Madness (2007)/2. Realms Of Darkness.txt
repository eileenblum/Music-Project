Everything is so dead, in the land of our master.
Everything's so red, of blood.
This land empty of life
It's always night
It's always cold
Everything is so old

Dark thoughts slips through our mind
When we drink of your blood tasting wine
Lord of darkness, hear us
We call to you through their suffering.
Take your power and grow strong
We shall stand by you. 

We are ready, just waiting for your sign.
With your darkness we'll make them blind 

In the shadows we belong
Like the frosty moon among
Let our night embrace you
Let our horrors awake you
From you life and down to the abyss
where you belong
