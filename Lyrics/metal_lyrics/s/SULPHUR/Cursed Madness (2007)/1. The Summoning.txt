Dark sky cloaked goddess
From the far ancient lands
We summon thy across the mountains
Forests and far boundless grasslands
We summon thy across a distant time
And a hundred slow turnings
Of the vast spindle of the sky
We summon thy, from the land of mystery
Where ravers circle in the dark and the loud howling of wolves

Echoing eldritch through cold night wind
Bring close to me the stranger far worlds
Where humankind has never ruled

We call to you
Beyond the distant gray thundra
And the vast plains of snow

Beneath the unearthly rippling and
Flowing of the dark northern skies
Boreal nights
