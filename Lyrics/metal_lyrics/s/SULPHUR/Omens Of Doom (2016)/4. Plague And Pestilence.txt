Here I stand watching as all life is condemned
to a dark abysmal end.
The wars of men have left its mark and
the dying land turns dismal and stark.

My bloodshot eyes search the darkening skies,
with a desperate hope to see the golden sun arise.
But hope dies when dark clouds opens,
revealing the lord of flies.

Then I looked to the skies and saw the wielder of plague,
of famine and of demise.
And Hell followed with him.
And the horrors unleashed from them,
death by wars and hunger, catastrophes and plague.
Death by the beasts of the earth.

Famine, disease, then tormented miseries.
Death stalks the wastelands, blood redden the seas.
On human flesh we feast
Desperation and starvation turns us all into beasts.
A world gone vile, hostile and unearthly.
Plague and famines fatality, shatters the remnants of humanity.

On infected flesh we feast.
The infections, the taints corruption, expand and increase.

I struggle forth to avoid the omens of my ominous fate.

Crawling forth on sore hands and knees.
Hunted by ravenous beast
Whom upon my infected flesh intends to feast.

The dread turns me pale.
There is no escape for the weak nor the frail.
The howls of feasting beast drown out my tormented wails.
