Blinding lights and deafening blasts the piles of dead are growing fast.
I'm struggling to avoid the deadly explosion.
Flying shrapnel, concrete and lead, strives to paint the madness red,
to pave the landscape with the corpses of the dead.

I am wading through, through rubble and dust,
through the smoldering ash of dead bodies.
The air is suffused with the sharp smell of gun smoke
and the foul stench of burning corpses.

I am struggling through the gloomy scenery,
surrounded by the melted remains
of my black burned comrades.
Breathing in the horrid stench of death.

And the ground seems to tremble as we fall.
From the force of our...

Beneath the nuclear blaze.
Beneath the chemical haze.
A senseless struggle,
a disastrous apocalyptic race.

Cities ablaze, columns of black smoke,
fills the hungry clouds above.
A world ablaze, spewing out black smoke,
fueling the mushroom clouds.

And everything trembles, from the force of our fall.
From the force of our fall.
