Behold the rolling darkness. Great armadas of typhoons
and circling cyclones, unleashing their whirling spawns.
With black and twisting hearts, they're tearing the lands apart.
The growing tempest forms, apocalyptic storms.

Beware and fear, raging winds and lightning spears.
The raging demise and terror reign the stormy skies.
Beware and fear, winds shreds and lightning's flare.
Raging demise, dread arise, terror reign the stormy skies.

Despair while the demons shreds the lands with their twisting hands.
Enormous whirling beasts from the heavens descend.
Carving trails of devastation, leaving wreckage and ruins behind.
Trails towards desolation, towards the end of humankind.

Behold the shredding winds that ravage, rage and scorn.
Enormous whirling columns. A world broken and torn.
They leave the world bloodied, broken and torn.
