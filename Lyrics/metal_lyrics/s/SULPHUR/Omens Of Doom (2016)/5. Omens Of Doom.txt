Omens of mass destruction.
The terrors of hell unleashed.
On storms of fire and out of wrathful oceans,
raging hordes of dreadful beasts

Omens of doom and destruction.
A raw unstoppable force.
Retribution through suffering, through annihilation.
Hell's terror gives no remorse.

Wielders of infernal misery. Eternal misery.

Wild forces of powers and chaos raging destructively.
The world is breaking, as is its destiny.

War!

Omens of annihilation.
Behold the Omens of Doom.

Spawns of fire, serpents of the seas.
Beneath their waves the lands wail in misery.
Demons of the air and beasts of the earth.
All despair before their outburst of doom.

Bringers of doom, spawns of deprivation and sin.
The hammers of justice rises within,
to smite the self-righteous kin.
The world is ending and the reckoning begins.
