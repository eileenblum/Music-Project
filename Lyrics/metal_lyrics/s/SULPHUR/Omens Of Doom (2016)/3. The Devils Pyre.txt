As dawn breaks the sun awakes and paints the sky beautiful in crimson.
It's but a taste of what's to come.
For the beauty of the new days birth ends with the shivering of the earth,
and blackness shoots from the ground.
And as I looked and beheld, great fires emerged from the seven hells,
the flames bored into my sight.
And I looked and beheld as the lands into the inferno fell
and blackness devoured the daylight.
Ash and flames poured like firing rain, the night Hell reigned.

Fire! Fire!
And the earth shivers, sending columns of black ash flying high.
A smell of Sulphur as fires ignites the sky.
Burning rivers, with violent fury, down raging mountains slide.
Beneath infernal skies the helpless screams and cries.
And all the lands stir as the devil spills his semen upon the face of the earth.
Pyroclastic surges, a raging curse.
Purgatory's hunger and the flames insatiable thirst.

Storms of fire, burning rain.
Hell's Empire rise through flames.
World on fire, world in flames.
The Devils Pyre, infernal reign.

Ash and flame pours like firing rain, soon only charred lands remain.
And liquid fire rage higher and higher, ending it all in a great funeral pyre.

Storms of fire, storms of flames.
The flames rage higher and Hell reigns.
World on fire, world in flames.
The Devils Pyre burns again.

As dawn breaks the sun awakes and paints the sky beautiful crimson.
Dawn breaks, the sun awakes and paints the sky beautiful crimson.

And so the world plunged into flames, devoured by forces once of creation.
Only the stench of Sulphur remains, beyond the raging force of total destruction.
The raging force of total destruction.

Fire!

Infernal rage, volcanic age.
Fire!
Higher and higher the funeral pyre.
Born of burning desire, flames of infernal fire.
