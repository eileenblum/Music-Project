The view is a grim madness.
A barren and naked wasteland except a few.
A few dead trees that still stands, a few ruins that still stands.
A few dead trees that still stands and breaks the skyline.

The view is a dismal emptiness.
A veil of dust flows thick blocking out the sun.
Preventing daylight to penetrate.
No daylight penetrates.

Ash descends from heaven like the flakes of falling snow.
To cover the toxic landscape where fertility once was bestowed.
And the glow of the sun has faded,
daylight's obscured by a stratosphere suffocated.
Beneath lies the bitter cold blight where no life will grow.
The world is a gray madness.
Barren and naked, dismal and lifeless.

The rise of the mushroom clouds.
The rise of the mushroom clouds.

The world is a gray madness,
a desolated emptiness.
The world is a gray madness,
a monotonous infinity, dismal and lifeless.

As stare like shapes ascends to descend
with a crash like the crack of doom.
Echoes of the disastrous blast rumble and rolls.
The days of men has passed as has been foretold.

A brilliant flash like the brightest of lights,
the whole world ignites
Storms of fire, waves of vaporizing heat.
The destruction of mankind complete.
