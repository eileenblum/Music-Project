Lights out
Another fallen man
Call me the villain, the one that has taken it all [2x]
This beast inside will be the solution
Another fallen man, another fallen man
lights out
Slipping away from control
Time to prove the world
This day is not to forget
I make my mark upon the remains
Lights out
Another fallen man
This time were closer to the end of it all
I cannot hide this beast inside
Another fallen man, another fallen man
Lights out
Clouds forming over lifeless fields
Rain falling on decaying bodies
We're getting closer to the end
The pieces of man will never be replaced
The blackened atmos shows no sign of mercy
Let it down, let it consume us all
Too late to firefight
Incineration shall begin
The skies will burn us all
This day is not to forget
You now will bask in isolation, desolation
Smallest speck of all creation
The beast will demolish all
I cannot save you
