So far Iâve come from the silence and scum under this earth
I made it out alone
No one left to challenge me
All life is gone
Taken by force by annihilation
Fading away with final peace
Corruption has abandoned me
I slip away into the night
No turning back, no one in sight
Take my hand
I'll guide you through destruction
Just look around
Its just an introduction
I slip away into the night
No turning back, no one in sight
The remains of life are only left
You can call it my greatest theft
Break away from now
Leave this era of violent crimes
Take the gift of time
Cast away and begin to climb
Release from me
Dead and gone
All life fades away
