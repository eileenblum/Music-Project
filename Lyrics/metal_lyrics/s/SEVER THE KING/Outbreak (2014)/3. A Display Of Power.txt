I have arrived
Start sounding the alarm that hides your coward eyes
Broken down
Spit right out
I've killed your subjects
All your mindless lab rats died
What's lifeless now was once your prize
Breach your walls
I've found you hiding in the slime
Never fighting for your feeble presence
Weeping in silence, where's your fucking pride?
I have arrived
Your worthless existence will not be missed
Bow your head and crown me king
Lifeless parasite
(You feed off all)
You feed off all infected human corruption
And now you'll crown me king
You now will scavenge for your barren sense of life that will keep you alive
Oh, what a shame it lies beneath all dirt in the pits of hell
Satan's chattel
You are blind and you'll find that your path leads nowhere
You are blind and you'll find that your path leads nowhere
I want to hear you squeal
I want to hear you squeal
You are blind and you'll find that your path leads nowhere [3x].
You are blind
Fuck

[Anthony Izworski of Borderlines]
There's no peace within
Broken limbs and rotting minds
Just dead inside.
I'll watch your body squirm
And now you ll fucking learn that this is genocide

[John Tsilov of Ocularis]
Summoned forth
Carcass staggered,
Gripping the life form
Terrorizing visions

[Charlie and Aaron Chaparian of Sever the King]
Awakened, to bring the wrath upon your broken self [Charlie]
Shattered pieces of this life will be scattered about [Aaron]
Endless starting, gazing but there's nothing there [Charlie]
Iâd show you hope, but you really think I fucking care? [Aaron]

[Carmen Gumina of Borderlines]
Crawling from the depths you see the true fate of man
The rotting undead will bow at our feet
To bask in the power of the ancients
To know true pain

[Jake DeZerga of My Iron Heart]
Your smell will permeate through the depths hells inside you welcoming war
This destruction that you arouse
when you inhale
Causes the blight ridden man to open his eyes
