Save me
Am I the only one along this constant climb?
I've waited all this time
Endless thoughts of apprehension
How many seconds can go by without a fucking answer?
I'm starting to realize my being will decay
Rotting within, all I see is black
Another shout and I'm hoping they'll hear me
Cocked back And I'm gasping at the bottom
I can hear them crawling, one by one but no ones stopping
The illusion of serenity has taken over
Mindlessly controlled
Take down your blinds and shades
Exposing all the lies you hide in darkness
Let them see me
As I drown in this eternal hell
Inch by inch I crawl in darkness feeling nothing
But what's ahead of me?
Falsehood and a plate of fiction
Serve it up with a side of lies and mass distortion
I'm thinking why should I even attempt to leave this place
I'm stuck in silence, void of all illusion
Then I hear
Then I feel
All treason and dishonesty
This is the trigger of my outbreak
This is my outbreak
