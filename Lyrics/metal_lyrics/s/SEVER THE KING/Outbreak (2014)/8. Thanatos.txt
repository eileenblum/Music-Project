I am he, whoâs empire is unconfined Extends to mortal tribes of every kind
Whose absence lengthens life
Who presence end
Your soul will be dragged down to Hades
In the Elysian fields, youâll wander endlessly
I am death who conquers all, who shatters worlds [2x]
Stagnated, dead, diseased, and unforgiven
The depths of human filth rotting to the core
A cleansing has been issued
Eradicating whats left of you
I am death
I am Thanatos
Say goodbye to everything
The world youâve always known is under my wrath
Donât waste your time counting down the days
Your time is now
