Why do you ask for patience?
You know your time is up
Donât bother pleading for forgiveness
You scum
For you I have no remorse
Her body shook violently
Your smut
10 days rotten waiting in a cellar
For whatâs left of you
As I let it build up
Iâm slowly starting to fall apart
Iâm slowly starting to fall apart
I wish you could hear the voices
And what they want me to do
Keep screaming
The world canât hear you now
I know youâre fading
But donât close your eyes
Why do you look so surprised
Youâve fed my hatred
Why do you look so surprised
To be dismembered
Why do you look so surprised
Look at what this angerâs done to me
