I'll redefine all the back tracks you went
Retracing broken steps
Feeding on lost souls of a fallen race
Now deprived
This world is gone
We all stagger in a product of ashes
Begging for forgiveness
You're nothing more than a regressed charlatan
An imposter
Your fallacies have let you down
Time after time, deceiving those who stood beneath you
Trapped under, you thought they would remain in place
This world is gone
Give me one reason to stop
Nothing will convince me
Bred from violence, now at the top
Keep begging
Nothing will convince me [2x].
Now at the top
We were blinded by a feigned hand
Nothing more than a charlatan
Respond to me
I now control your every move
Crawling for hope is all you'll ever do
Bred from violence, now at the top
This throne is part of me
The dominance of all that's left
Feeding on lost souls of a fallen race
Preeminent leader of this fucked up world
Look at what you've done
Your soul rewarded to the son of perdition
I have accomplished my darkest mission
