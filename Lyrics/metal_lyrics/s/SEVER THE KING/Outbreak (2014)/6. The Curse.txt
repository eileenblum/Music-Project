A life corrupted by constant mistakes
Why canât I ever learn?
I never escape [2x]
The only option left, I'll embrace the darkness inside of me
This is a farce, a lie, a fucking curse
and now Iâm left face down on this earth
But i have risen,
Risen to become the monster against those who've created me
They'll scream towards the sky [2x]
What do you do, when everything around you becomes a fucking target?
What do you do, when your twisted desires become your own destruction?
You all will learn
You'll learn the meaning of fear
But they like what I've become
they like the anger I've built
but they like what I've become
they feed off of the anger
(This is my gift back to the world)
(A world that never gave a fuck)
(This is my gift back to the world)
(A world that has run out of luck)
