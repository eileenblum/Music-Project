The mothers' warm, embracing womb,
Her selfish wish aborting me.
The pains I feared, the ones to come,
All things that keep on haunting me.
The sands I walked, the lies I loved
The abyss I keep falling in.

I give up on hope - it's torturing me
My heart, it stopped - the pain came in to stay.
I close my eyes - they're blinding me
There is no choice, no way, no glimpse of future left for me.

The winters' cold, whispering tomb
My life - a bet I'll never win.
The friends I had, the ones I failed,
The held out hands I cruelly nailed.
The tired flesh I drag around
Asks me to leave it all behind.

I willingly abdicate life - this poisonous gift.
Take away this cup from me - shell I not have it ever again.
The thing I desire - the slumber that will finally come
Nothingness calls, her starring eyes are empty and cold.

You cannot inquire, nor raise your voice,
The rules are enforced, the future's foretold.
Seek no comfort nor try make others feel
Just crawl and do what you are told.

Your endless suffering keeps screaming to the sky
I do not weep for you no more, I'm done.
I don't care anymore, I'm gone.

I willingly abdicate life - the slumber finally came
I do not weep for you no more, I'm done.
I don't care anymore, I'm gone.
