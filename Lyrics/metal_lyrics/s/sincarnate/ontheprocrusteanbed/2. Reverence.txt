Breathe, please start to bleed.
Open your eyes and carry me further.
One pitiful life-time was not enough
To waste on the hate I'm breeding.

Why me?! Can't you see,
What you're asking?
You never cared in the least
What I would have ever answered.

You're just a worm, a second in time,
A pile of dust, the blink of an eye.

The more I see,
The more I hear,
The more I feel,
The more I hate it.

The more I know,
The further I go,
The deeper I fall
The less I can take it.

But how about me? I trusted in thee!
No other man could lift my burden.
It's not up to you and neither am I
Called to decide if it goes on and how further.

I saw them rise, I see them fail,
They are still rising, still yet to bow,
And they will do it again and again
There is no creature deserving this all.

I may be a worm, a second in time
This second I have is THE blink of THE eye.

The more I see,
The more I hear,
The more I feel,
The more I hate it.

No matter what you do,
No matter what you say,
No matter what happens,
I'll be standing!
