Are you the teachers of my heart? Yes, we do teach all hearts to break. Are you the keepers of the truths? Only of those, not owned by you!
While I was searching, praising your kind, I met a wise man, who lost his mind. Asking for guidance, I stayed in line, but as we walked, he walked behind.
We are the ones, whom you address. We're taking down, what you confess, if you confess dreaming, becoming, choosing, being, decaying, un-coming, nothing...
If there are choices then I've made some. The wrong they did can be undone. The ones I didn't are not to be taken as choices chosen by me. I met a girl across the sea, her eyes as truthful as can be. Are you a teacher of my past? Yes I do teach old hearts to rest.
I looked for answers wherever I could and asked those questions I shouldn't have. If there's a choice, I could have chosen, I would have chosen never to choose dreaming, becoming, choosing, being, decaying, un-coming, dreaming... Teachers, are my lessons done? No, they're not! Teachers! I can't do another one! No, you cannot!
