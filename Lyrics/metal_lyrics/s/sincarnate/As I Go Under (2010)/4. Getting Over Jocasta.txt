What makes you smile, sweet end of mine? Is it me or the black wine? Don't speak, be silent; the blind can see, the weak turn violent. It won't be me, the one you'll see, to turn around and try to flee...
Wicked words... they are to me, as much as your beauty will set you free. I am the one, who killed the Sphinx; I am the one to change these things. Obey me! Believe in me! Kneel to me! Be saved by me! I killed my father and your husband too, so I can live forever, I have to rape you through and through.
You foul child, why don't you see your tainted blood turning to sea, the rise of man, hour of gloom, carrying your seed, to our doom? Under your rule, there'll be no place, for a kind word, a smile on a face. With your machines, you will forget even to witness mankind's sunset.
