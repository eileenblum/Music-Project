In the beginning, there was the word, floating silently above the waters. It was you who first spoke, you, my love, have made it shatter. We are slaves now to the sneaking of a tongue, your lips are moving, your hands are begging, but you're uttering just words.
Brick by brick you have built your little house, step by step, burying you behind the walls. Are you safe now? Can you tell, who's eloping, who's to fall? Do not grow fond of this last coven, for it will also be your grave. I am not reaching for the heavens, to hear you ask "Is that all?!". I would be facing my worst demon, if my defeat could make you smile.
I am the furthest man on earth, the one you loved, the one you'll hate. The closer you're getting to me, I grow so cold, I fall so deep. You traitor! You lied, you were not looking for a place to hide! My lord, be kind, let her hear what's to be found.
And if you're looking for a meaning, do not remember what I said - cease forever speaking, go ask yourself and go ask your God. I'm only trading for a shelter, for I have been so alone. It pains me to see you surrender - these words have failed you, my love.
My hopes are fading, as I know, it will end. My feet are trembling; my heart is aching as we climb Migdal Bavel.
