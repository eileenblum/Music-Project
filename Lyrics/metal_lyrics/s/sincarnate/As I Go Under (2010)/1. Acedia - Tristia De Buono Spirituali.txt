Malice, rancor, pusillanimity, despair, torpor, wondering thoughts... Sullen was I in the sweet air that is gladdened by the sun, carrying lazy smoke within my heart... Now I lie sullen in the black mire...
How could have I become an accomplice to the horrors of this pitiful joke?
You're just a man, not less, not more, not hot, neither cold, not even, suffering of... sloth! Knowest not that thou art wretched, miserable and poor, blind and naked... behold, I stand at your door and knock, shall you hear my voice, would you open?
What if there's no shelter? No arms to embrace? What if I'm gone? Tell me... what then? For I've been ungrateful for living, for I haven't praised your work, cause I couldn't bear your absence, for I've been waiting too long?! Who's the one guilty of sloth?!! I'll vomit thee, out of my mouth, slut!
