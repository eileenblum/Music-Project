Once I was a deceiver, crossing seas of my own, till I met this wretched sailor, who promised me to open the door.
In exchange, we asked for a favor: to put on a cross at dawn.
Elijah, why have you chosen me? I'm rather fond of man and love the sea. I do not want to see you drown - fishmongers will hide you deep and hunt me down. They'll praise you and then, they'll kill you and then, they'll eat you and then they'll drink you. They'll use you and then forget you.
Elijah, I hope you were right; you'll save mankind and meet your dad death... I'm begging you, before you leave, open that door and let me in.
If you do sell him now, yours is the prize - we'll forever remember your name, Judas Iscariot.
