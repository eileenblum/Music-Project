Your eyes are tired, let them close. Forget about me, for I'm no loss. We have no things to leave behind, there will be no one awaiting us. The path we chose, the path we walk, it has no end, there's no return.
This litany you sing to me will bring you no relief. In my domain, you will not see the slightest gleam of truth.
We had the means; we had the time, now it is over, we crossed the line. I wish for nothing, there is no truth, there was just love, dismiss the fool.
You dare to question the god below, who gave you tears and eyes to cry?! Just keep on going, tasting the dirt, you'll have your lover, don't look behind. You worthless creatures, you wicked kin, how dare you breathe, how can you smile? You wish for nothing, but take it all, you find no truth, but forge your own.
Doomed as we are, haunted by fear and despair, tainted we are, reckless and wicked, but free.
But soon, too soon he turns his eyes. Again she falls in the dark depths, again she dies. No crime was his, if there's no crime to love. All alone, he makes his moan, and calls her ghost, this time, forever lost.
