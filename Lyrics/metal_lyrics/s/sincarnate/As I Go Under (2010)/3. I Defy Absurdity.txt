I defy absurdity, this relentless tyranny. To breath, to walk, to love and to hope, to care, destroy, always wishing for more... The senseless play you wrote - we play to your lunatic lines 'till you prevail. The hopes we try to borrow, you drown in each tomorrow...
Your hollow game of faith... We play to your commandments as you say. To serve, to pay, to wait, to hope and fail, to breed, obey, to you, the snake biting its tail...
Mother, how could you do it?! When you knew it would hurt so much? Father, now have it - the worse of you, human to touch. You dare to call this freedom?! Please keep it for your kingdom! In the end, it is I feeding you.
