Ceased from this fading pleasure
when sober words crushed on the wall
Lights out, I still wonder
what killed the last of senses,
made all the colors go numb
and left me behind it
facing the truth once again

Whoâs to blame?
Itâs not the light that parted
itâs not the war we started
itâs not the sun that fires blanks!
Itâs your senses shutting down
Itâs your eyes that did shut down

Forced to renounce the treasure
Deaf ears worn out my piercing voice
Whatever you are worth
you donât deserve this bleeding
Your drama this loss of touch
Soulâs in isolation
Face your decay once again!

Blame the eclipse of the sun
Blame me the damage is done

Itâs not the light that parted
itâs not the war we started
itâs not the sun that fires blanks

Donât chase me
erase me
Break this thrall that
tore me apart!
