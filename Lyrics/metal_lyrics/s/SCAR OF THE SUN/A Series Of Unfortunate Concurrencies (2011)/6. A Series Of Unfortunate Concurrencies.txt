Relinquish the vortex
and then the blind stared at the sun
Through the rubble
wonders seem so untrue

A later illusion,
the âgolden eraâ has begun
All these years
Iâve been searching for you!

Sudden impulse
This blowing smoke deceive the eyes
Once again, adolescence
filled up the gap with lies

And I was there
the counterweight
to even up the score
Painful blow, the beast within
betray me, start the war!

In a series of unfortunate concurrencies we lost
Curse the meaning, brush off prosperity
and the boundaries crossed
Your relentless mind motivated was,
despite what youâve been sold
Cracks appeared
frail substance
let descent unfold!

Moral combat
Years of destruction stole the light
Solar tense, obedience
the reason will ignite

And I was there
about to go
and blow the past away
Once I thought I knew it all,
but failed to save the day

Bound together,
this will never end!
Showâs over
when one of us dieâ¦
