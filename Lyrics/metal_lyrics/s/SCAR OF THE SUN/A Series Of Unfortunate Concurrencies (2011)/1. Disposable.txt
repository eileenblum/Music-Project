Go!
Released from your mortal touch of taint!
A flick of a switch,
dismissal complete!â

Breathless corpse!
A tag on my toe to certify my status,
the words were engraved on:
âsubject of the pastâ!

Time
Has failed to heal the pain
and nothing keeps me sane,
this warâs I was the only hostage!
Still
your ghost is in my brain,
your needleâs in my vain,
my sanityâs a distant project!

Gone!
And stranded among these faceless clones,
Itâs not gonna work!
The fire got no pulse!

This cruel guise
is squashing my face beyond control
and flays all my skin with no mercy,
grinds my essence down!

And I felt disposable!
I felt defiledâ¦
