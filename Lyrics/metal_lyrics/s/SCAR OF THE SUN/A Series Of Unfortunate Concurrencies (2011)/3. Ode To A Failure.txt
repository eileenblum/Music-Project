Defeat in motion
Casualty of your inner war
Surreal apprising
consequence of this never-ending state of flux
Degeneration
Betting how low you can go
Too much of nothing
Donât even bother to retreat or hide your tracks

How can I breathe
when these windows are sealed!
I canât rely on your
foul self again!
Havoc, no control,
could I ever decipher your thoughts?
I canât pretend all was
washed away by rain!

Urge your demons (count me our!)
I see your breakdownâs getting near
(getting near)
Urge your demons
Chase your reasons
Urge your demons (count me our!)
I see your breakdownâs getting near
(getting near)
A fall unending
haunted by your self created fear

A sick disorder
killing the light before the glow
and scars grow deeper
watching you fight the windmills of your fairytale
Imposed the distance
Another hand youâre dragging down
Your failed existence
terminates here and those unbroken will prevail
