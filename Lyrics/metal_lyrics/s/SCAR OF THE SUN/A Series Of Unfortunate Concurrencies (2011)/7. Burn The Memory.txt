All I express,
my essence youâre sure that you know!
Another illusion you have,
modestyâs the word, but you donât know it!

Present I am
And nothing belongs to the past!
I donât know why I should forget,
you got it wrong, so you should forget it!

I see you fallingâ¦

Progress you claim,
Iâve moved on is all that I hearâ¦
Another attempted escape,
typical try to avoid reality!

Pompous I sound,
I meant every word that I said!
You think that Iâm wasting my breath,
Patience a virtue and you donât have it!

So you lost the plot
and I had my share in that!
But Iâve crossed the border now!
Crossed the borderâ¦

Burn, burn, burn,
from the ruins rise,
the disaster is by your side!
Burn, burn,
in oblivion dive,
âcause I have to restore my pride!
