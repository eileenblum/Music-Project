âDEATH IS NOT THE GREATEST LOSS IN LIFE. THE GREATEST LOSS IS WHAT DIES INSIDE US WHILE WE LIVEâ
--NORMAN COUSIN

Behind your finger hides your great fixation
You canât escape by attempting levitation
Even if you defeated pain, that solemn feeling,
itâs arrogant to think youâll win your weight!

Stand on the air, but with no wings to fly
Mental deception, you donât even try
Skyâs not for everyone, limitâs too high
You wonât believe,
youâre not immortal, youâll die!

âSOMEDAY, AFTER MASTERING THE WINDS, THE WAVES, THE TIDES AND GRAVITY, WE SHALL HARNESS FOR GOD THE ENERGIES OF LOVE, AND THEN, FOR A SECOND TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, MAN WILL HAVE DISCOVERED FIRE.â
--TEILHARD DE CHARDIN

Conceive at last the fact youâre not the hunter
Surrender to the force that drags you under
If you ever upraise the crave, reality willâ¦
â¦will hold your lovely feet down to the ground!
