What I see debris you see a mould

Jaded by the blow
An instant calibration of my head
all the givenâs lost
Treated like a foe
A total cancellation of myself,
On you surface frost

What I see debris you see a mould

No need to pray
No words to say
Your eyes are blind
Iâll run away
I found the way
My sea, your bay
I think this time
Iâll pull away

While you insist in living life
In your bubble
Iâm leaving traces of my skin
on the rubble

Iâm falling
Iâm crawling
Appalling
Nothingâs the same
Iâm falling
Iâm crawling
Appalling
Everythingâs changed

No need to pray
No words to say
Your eyes are blind
Iâll run away
I found the way
My game, your play
I think this time
Iâll get away

Iâm sick if the words
that makes everything nice
I canât justify
furthermore any vice
and thereâs only one
that can wipe out the shame
Whatever I do
it will stay just the same
