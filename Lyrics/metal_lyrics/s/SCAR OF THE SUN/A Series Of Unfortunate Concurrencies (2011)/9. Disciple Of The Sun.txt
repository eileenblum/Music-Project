Why are you asking me to profane your icon,
destroy the flesh and the bones of this still?
I canât remain translusive, hiding in vapour,
injecting life to a such foul will!

So long to this endeavour, Iâve stretched my sensors
discern the one, and I keep my track clean
Frantic image but flawless, your contradictions
wonât mystify me and make you obscene!

Failed to discourage my faith,
I still remain the disciple I was ages agoâ¦

â¦Until the time that these eyes will restate their presence!
â¦Until your poisoned soulâs total convalescence!
â¦Until you get that these days werenât just a number!
â¦Until the wake from your never ending slumber!

I still remainâ¦
I still remain!

Failed to discourage my faith,
I still remain the disciple I was ages agoâ¦

All through the years
I was searching truth through madness
Absent, I only saw
fragments of your aptness
Iâll be devoted
in happiness and sadness,
Until the rays of your sun
will enlighten my darknessâ¦
