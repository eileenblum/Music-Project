Reaper on horseback I will ride
Black moon peaks through laden sky
To the end of time I will never die
This soul and body will be mine

As you prey I will feast
Stroke the spell of the beast

Eyes of the dead I covet
Ripping corpses god I love it
Fornication masturbation
I am the specter deep inside of you
Feel the cold touch of death

Nocturnal
