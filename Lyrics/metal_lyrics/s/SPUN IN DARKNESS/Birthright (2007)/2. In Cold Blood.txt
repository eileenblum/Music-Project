Winter moon hidden by clouds of flesh
Blistering bodies to fuel the flames
Apocalypse intoxication killing mass
Funeral for the living soul
Hell on earth

Attack the living
Hate will rise
In cold blood

Rise now
From the pits of endless death
In cold blood

Genocide burning corpses funeral fire
Lightning war never ends angel corpse
Death march brutality beaten left for dead
Killing birth pawns of destruction
