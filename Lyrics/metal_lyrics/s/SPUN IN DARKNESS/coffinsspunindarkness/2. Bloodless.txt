[performed by Spun in Darkness]the enemy within us
annihilate the form
a plague like sickness
military born
spiritual philosophies are hopeless
society feeds upon itself
down in pits of darkness
devoured corpse arise
looking for flesh
representing widespread annihilation
only the walking dead remain
bloodless shell
shell of death
