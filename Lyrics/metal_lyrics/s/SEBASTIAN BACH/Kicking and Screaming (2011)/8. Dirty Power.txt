I feel like striking back
I got a bad reputation oh have you heard?
No I don't feel like "coming back"
I got a lot to say
You got a lot of nerve

You try to tell me how to live
Don't even give it a try

Your dirty power's not controllin' me
And I ain't to blind to see
Don't cast your shadow in my eyes
Don't tell me how to be

In the season of the witch
A new enemy could be your best friend
You fall in love with a crazy bitch
You're gonna know what you end up with in the end

You try to tell me how to live
Don't even give it a try

Your dirty power's not controllin' me
And I ain't to blind to see
Don't cast your shadow in my eyes
Don't tell me how to be

I can't control myself
I got a bad reputation of have you heard?
And I can't convince myself
There's any lessons left yet to be learned
I spit in the eye of contention
I spit in the eye of the past
Our unions dissolution
Over now
But nothin' lasts

Your dirty power's not controllin' me
And I ain't to blind to see
Don't cast your shadow in my eyes
Don't tell me how to be

Don't cast your shadow in my eyes
Don't tell me how to be
