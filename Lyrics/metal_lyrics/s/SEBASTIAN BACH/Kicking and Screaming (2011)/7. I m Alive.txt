I have it all
I have nothing
It's all in my mind
From another time
But who am I
To complain
About circumstance?
Give me another chance
At finding the truth

'Cause I'm alive
This love's a fake
Wake up tomorrow
Brand new day
Was it a dream?
As real as you seemed
Leaving me
Without a thing
'Cause I woke up
With someone else not me

And I can't believe
All these years
Have come and gone
In a night
My whole life
I built it all
On nothing
'Cause I never knew
Just who was who
Was livin' with this truth

'Cause I'm alive
This love's a fake
Wake up tomorrow
Brand new day
Was it a dream?
As real as you seemed
Leaving me
Without a thing
'Cause I woke up
With someone else not me

And I can't believe

I have it all
I have nothing
It's all in my mind
From another time
I gotta start
Over again
'Cause every night
Is just black and white
I'm living with this truth

'Cause I'm alive
This love's a fake
Wake up tomorrow
Brand new day
Was it a dream?
As real as you seemed
Leaving me
Without a thing
'Cause I woke up
I woke up
With someone else not me
