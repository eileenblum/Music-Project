You look to me and read between the lines
I can't even see what's right or wrong this time

'Cause I haven't gone too far
I slip away and see my memories fall so hard

So come on, come on, come on
Live the life around you
Don't hold on, hold on, hold on
How it used to be
C'mon!

Paint a picture of this place in time
To see the means to which we know is fine
Bodies burned from every side
And when I close my eyes
There's still no place to hide

So come on, come on, come on
Live the life around you
Don't hold on, hold on, hold on
How it used to be

So come on, come on, come on
Live the life around you
Don't hold on, hold on, hold on
How it used to be
