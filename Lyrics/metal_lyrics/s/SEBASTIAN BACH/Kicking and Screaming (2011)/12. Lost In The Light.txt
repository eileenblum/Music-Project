Searchin' for a new horizon
Don't wanna live life secondhand
I'll make my own mistakes
Find my own way
On my own beliefs I stand
I got a sense of where I'm goin'
I only know just where I been
I don't need your advice 'cause after tonight I ain't never gonna see you
Again

Darkness can't pull me under
You know where I'll be found

Lost in the light
Of what I might find
Of what I might deny
Chasing time
Of what I might be
Of what I may someday see
I got you right where I want you to be

I'm not lookin' for a saviour
Keep your handouts it's alright
Are you the man who knows the answer?
Or a man who's caught in time?

Darkness can't pull me under
You know where I'll be found

Lost in the light
Of what I might find
Of what I might deny
Chasing time
Of what I might be
Of what I may someday see
I got you right where I want you to be

Darkness can't pull me under
You know where I'll be found

Lost in the light
Of what I might find
Of what I might deny
Chasing time
Of what I might be
Of what I may someday see
I got you right where I want you to be
