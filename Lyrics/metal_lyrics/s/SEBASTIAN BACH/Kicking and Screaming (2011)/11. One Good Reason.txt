I've been mistreated
Kicked down on the floor
I try do hard to get up
But I can't take it no more
'Cause you're livin' in a daydream
I exist in the now
And I got no time for lookin' back
At the jokers and the clowns, no

You turned your back on me
And I lost my faith in you
And now I just can't see
What we are gonna do

Give all I have to give to find myself away from this
There's no truth in words you say
So give me one good reason to stay

I'm sick of betrayal
Takin' all you can get
You treat my world like your trash can, baby
Like a ring around my neck
Never silent but deadly
Stick my head above the crowd
Take your aim
Take your best shot
You'll never stone me down, no

And now I just can't see
What we are gonna do

Give all I have to give to find myself away from this
There's no truth in words you say
So give me one good reason to stay

You turned your back on me
And I lost my faith in you

Give all I have to give to find myself away from this
There's no truth in words you say
So give me one good reason to stay

One good reason to stay
One good reason to stay
One good reason to walk away
Stay
