Alone in this world
In a madness I'm floating
I can't find a way to the other side
Long overdue with nothing to lose
Subliminal keys for two lives that collide

And there's nothing shown when I close the door
'Cause your sticks on bone have broken before

Caught in a dream
Lookin' in from the outside
Longing to be what'll soon set me free
Trapped in a dream
I'm caught on the outside
No one will take me and no one will save me

A new day will come
That shows what you've done
Is there and end to this thing you've become
Desperate to find my own piece of mind
Lead on as nothin'
Led on as blind

And there's nothing shown when I close the door
'Cause your sticks on bone have broken before

Caught in a dream
Lookin' in from the outside
Longing to be what'll soon set me free
Trapped in a dream
I'm caught on the outside
No one will take me and no one will save me

Caught in a dream
Lookin' in from the outside
Longing to be what'll soon set me free
Trapped in a dream
I'm caught on the outside
No one will take me and no one will save me

Caught in a dream
Lookin' in from the outside
Longing to be what'll soon set me free
Trapped in a dream
I'm caught on the outside
No one will take me
No one will save me
