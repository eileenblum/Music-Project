[feat. John 5]Who are you to tell me where I been?
I'm stayin' underground not comin' up again
Tell me why I gotta start and when
I swallow my pride and let it begin

Even though I've known you for so long
It feels like the first time
First time I met you again
I can't live a lie or
Fantasize on
Who you think I am

Look at me and you reminisce
You're lookin' back in time think about what you miss
You can't hear a single word I say
If it don't sound the same as yesterday

Even though I've known you for so long
It feels like the first time
First time I met you again
Facing indecision
Tunnelvision
Won't get in my way

Feels like I'm startin' over
One less bolder
One step closer away
Seein' tunnelvision
Indecision
Don't get in my way

Even though I've known you for so long
It feels like the first time
First time I met you again
Can't live a life for you to
Cling onto
I must be who I am
