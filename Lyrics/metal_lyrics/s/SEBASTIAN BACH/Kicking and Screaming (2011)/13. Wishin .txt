Life is so far from perfect
Sometimes the plans we make
Don't turn out how we pictured them
Best intentions fade
And we all need somebody
To help us see it through
If I could change the way things were and the way things are
Here's what I'd do

I'd wish the world a better place
Wish a smile upon ever lonely face
Wish I could be everything to you
But wishin' won't make it true
Oh no

We all have our own fantasies
Of things we wanna see
Sometimes it takes blood, sweat, and tears to make reality
I'd wish the world a better place
Wish a smile upon the lonely face
Help the helpless carry on
And ease your mind 'till the pain is gone
Find a light in the darkest hour
Take your dreams and give them power
I wish I could be everything to you
But wishin' won't make it true

One day we'll wake up and be where we want to be
And all the hard times will be memories

We'll never have the harvest
If we don't plant the seed
I wanna help you have it all
Please tell me what you need

I'd wish the world a better place
Wish a smile upon the lonely face
Help the helpless carry on
And ease your mind 'till the pain is gone
Find a light in the darkest hour
Take your dreams and give them power
I wish I could be everything to you
But wishin' won't make it true
