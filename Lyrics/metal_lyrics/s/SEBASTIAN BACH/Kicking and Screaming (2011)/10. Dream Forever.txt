All I believe is what I see
Can't fell you anymore
Another day in front of me
Just lyin' on the floor

Thinkin' of thing things I could have been
Just before I close my eyes
Fall asleep to rid my mind
I close my eyes again

I don't wanna live forever
Stay Forever
Feel forevermore
I don't wanna dream forever
Wish forever
Be forever at all

What I want
No what I need
Can't get it either way
Sometimes I event forget to breathe
With nothin' left to say
Sittin' here by a midnight streelight
I begin to close my eyes
Fall asleep to rid my mind
I close my eyes again

I don't wanna live forever
Stay Forever
Feel forevermore
I don't wanna dream forever
Wish forever
Be forever at all

Who really wants to live forever?
When your soul is dying alone
And all the days that pass don't matter
And all the people who care are gone

All I believe is what I see
Can't feel any your judgment?
I see myself running through a door
Leading me nowhere running fast
I spiral down doesn't mean a thing
A new day's already part of my past
Life is nowhere it's permanent
Can't so goodbye
And it's killing me inside

I don't wanna live forever
Stay Forever
Feel forevermore
I don't wanna dream forever
Wish forever
Be forever at all
