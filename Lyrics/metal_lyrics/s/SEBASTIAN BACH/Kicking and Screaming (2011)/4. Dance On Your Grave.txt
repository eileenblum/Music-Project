A far cry from a perfect life
Your words are just a twisted lie
If I could ask you why your world is such a blur
It'd be a never ending question
Will you ever give an answer?

And I know the reason why

I'm gonna dance on your grave
For throwing all my love away
Dance on your grave
You take it all away
Dance on your grave
You're sick and tired won't be no slave
Dance on your grave
You took it all away

Broken dreams like a test of fate
There's nothing left to love or hate
Try to cross the line of fire
Pulling hard on me
But I won't play your game no more
Will you ever let me be?

And I know the reason why

I'm gonna dance on your grave
For throwing all my love away
Dance on your grave
You take it all away
Dance on your grave
You're sick and tired won't be no slave
Dance on your grave
You took it all away

I'm gonna dance on your grave
For throwing all my love away
Dance on your grave
You take it all away
Dance on your grave
You're sick and tired won't be no slave
Dance on your grave
You took it all away
