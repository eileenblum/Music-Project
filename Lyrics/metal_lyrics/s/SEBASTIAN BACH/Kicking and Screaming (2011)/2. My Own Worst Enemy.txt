Another place, another face
Forgetting who I am
I'm screaming out at them
This time it's more than insecurity
A blackout today
Just push me away

So who am I?
And is it really just temporary
Or permanent?
Look away

So what's the news on the situation?
Am I running from myself?
A blinding light, I can't see
What is real inside of me
What's the truth I can't believe
I'm my own worst enemy

What could I do?
What could I say?
That wouldn't matter anything, anyway
I see the way it works
A pattern never lost
I try to make you see
But you wouldn't change a thing

So who am I?
And is it really just temporary
Or permanent?
Look away... Deny myself again

So what's the use of the situation?
Am I running from myself?
A blinding light, I can't see
What is real inside of me
What's the truth I can't believe
I'm my own worst enemy

My enemy

So what's the use of the situation?
Am I running from myself?
A blinding light, I can't see
What is real inside of me
What's the truth I can't believe
I'm my own worst enemy
