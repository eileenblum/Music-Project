You don't mean a thing to me
I got my axe in hand it's all I need
And what you said don't even sting
I got the open road and my six string
Cuttin' loose is all I know
It don't matter where I go
Out of luck, no soul to spare
Broke and stranded I don't care
Broke and stranded I don't care

'Cause ain't nothin' bothers me
Ain't nothin' weighin' me down
As long as I got the music drivin' me
Ain't nothin' bothers me

I miss out on so many things
All my friends and family
Chasin' after all my dreams
Bein' who I'm meant to be
The lows are low
The highs are high
It chose me so I don't ask why
Racin' down this unknown road
Broke and stranded I still go
Broke and stranded I still go

'Cause ain't nothin' bothers me
Ain't nothin' weighin' me down
As long as I got the music drivin' me
Ain't nothin' bothers me

The days are wearin' me out
But I just can't run away
'Cause there's nothin' left
I might not make it far
As far as I'd like to be
As far as I can see

Cuttin' loose is all we know
It don't matter where we go
Out of luck, no soul to spare
Broke and stranded I don't care
Broke and stranded we don't care

'Cause ain't nothin' bothers me
Ain't nothin' is weighin' me down
As long as I got the music drivin' me
Ain't nothin' bothers
You can't bother
Ain't nothin' bothers me
You can't bother me
