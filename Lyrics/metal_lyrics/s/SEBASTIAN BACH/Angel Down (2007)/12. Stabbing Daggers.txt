Circumstances beyond my control
Take advantage of my very soul
Time forgotten by all but one
Misbegotten son of broken love

Take what you're givin' for the last time
Nothin' I'll never know
Stabbin' Daggers through my back
Through the heart they go

Turnin' circles, spiral down in spite
Contesting your very life
Need some answers down from on high
To the questions- Father, who am I?

Take what you're givin' for the last time
Nothin' I'll never know
Stabbin' Daggers through my back
Through the heart they go

Circumstances beyond my control
Take advantage of my very soul
Time forgotten by all but one
Misbegotten son of broken love

Take what you're givin' for the last time
Nothin' I'll never know
Stabbin' Daggers through my back
Through the heart they go

I think you're talkin' to the wrong guy
I'm someone you'll never know
Stabbin' Daggers through my back
Through the heart they go
