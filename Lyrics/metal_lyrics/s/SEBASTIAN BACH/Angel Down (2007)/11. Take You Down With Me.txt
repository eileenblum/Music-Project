Why is it no suprise
I'm succumbing to fear?
Unforeseen alibis
In my head I can hear

Devil on my shoulder
Taking control over
Action, reaction
I just can't set it free

Take you down
If I'm gonna die
Take You Down With Me
Take you down
And I know it ain't right
Take You Down With Me

I try to understand
War, suffering and pain
Turning mankind against man
A generation is slain

Angel on my shoulder
Fighting control over
My temptation to
Destroy all that I see

Take you down
If I'm gonna die
Take You Down With Me
And I know it ain't right
Take You Down With Me

Take you down
If I'm crucified
Take You Down With Me
From the mountain on high
Take You Down With Me

Take you down
If I'm gonna die
Take You Down With Me
And I know it ain't right
Take You Down With Me
From the starry sky
Take you down with me
