Nothin' lasts forever
Nobody rides for free
For twenty years I took a stand
You're not takin' no chance on me

Some slow to anger
Some quick to hate
When you've given all you got
And you just can't satiate

We all live in negative
Can we ride to the light?

Deal in desperation
Peddling in spite
If it's a war you're lookin' for
You won't look far tonight

I'm sick of restitution
Paying back in blood
All I ever wanted was a little action
And maybe just a little love

We all live in negative
Can we ride to the light?

Why you gotta make it
harder than it has to be?
We could come together
And show the world we're free.
Break free!

Negative light comes to me out of the shadows
Negative light gives me what I need
Negative light gives me what I need
Negative light the part of me I don't want you to see
Negative light gives me what I need
