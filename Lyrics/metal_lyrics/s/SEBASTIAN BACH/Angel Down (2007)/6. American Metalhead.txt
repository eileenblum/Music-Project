Brothers in one, ageless at heart
Shoulder to shoulder, we'll never die
Legions tonight, hellborn and dark
Souls are alive as time marches on

Glorious might, sons of the Gods
Tyrants of loud, our hearts?- Red, black
We breathe in terror and breathe out the light
Live to survive, we are one tonight

We live we die we kill we rise
We live we die we kill we rise

Burn through the night, wolves are a pack
Forgotten sons and daughters alike
Lords of forever left stealin' from God
One live to live, we are taking it now
Evil bows tonight

We live we die we kill we rise
We live we die we kill we rise

One soul, one mind, one heart, one life
One soul, one mind, one heart, one life
Rise up!
