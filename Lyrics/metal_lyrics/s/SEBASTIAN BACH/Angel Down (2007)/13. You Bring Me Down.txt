I wait for you to sacrifice
Hopin' again, again
You'll raise me up again to life
You will save me now

I am less than I have been
This is the falling
Become nothing, man again
You just break me down

There is nothing more
In this life to take away
Until my dying day
You bring me down

I opened up another door
Looking for you there
No one can light the darkened room
Who will save me now?

After everything that you
Tried to put me through
All you ever do is
Bring me down

You bring me down
