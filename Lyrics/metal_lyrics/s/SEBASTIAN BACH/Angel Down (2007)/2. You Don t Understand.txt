I'll take a bullet for you in the night
Is what we're fighting for wrong or right?
I lie awake in my tomb, so confused
Who wins the battle when we all lose?

You don't understand
Wash this blood away from my hands
All I gotta do is give my life for you

I try and hide, but I'm in plain sight
Will I live to see the morning light?
Will I live to see my dreams come true?
Will I ever make it home to you?

You don't understand
Wash this blood away from my hands
All I gotta do is give my life for you

The sickly stench of death is all around
Brothers,sisters,mothers,children
Six feet underground
Is it justified?
Why do I feel so hollow inside?

I don't understand what it takes to be a man
What I gotta do is give my life for you?
You don't understand
Wash away the blood from my hands
All I gotta do is give my life for you
