Where do we fit in a
world that sells us lies?
It's so hard to be
your perfect kind

Truth is vital
yes that's what's inside
Cover yourself
You yourself deny

Like stars sky high we live and die
Free your body, your soul, your mind

Where do I fit in a
world that sells me lies?
It's so hard to be
your perfect kind

Like stars sky high we live and die
Free your body, your soul, your mind
Like stars sky high we live and die
Free your body, your soul, your mind

Blessed with light and showered in dark
While we're here we'll make our mark
Blessed with light and scarred by pain
Roll the dice begin again

Don't be afraid to win or lose
The money stays,
but the pain stays with you

We are showered in dark
And scarred by the pain
Begin again

Like stars sky high we live and die
Free your body, your soul, your mind
Like stars sky high we live and die
Free your body, your soul, your mind

Who cares about death?
Right now I'm alive
My two feet upon this earth
Under her skies
