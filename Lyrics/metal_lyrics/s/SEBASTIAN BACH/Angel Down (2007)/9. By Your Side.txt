So long my dear departed
where did you go
I can't believe you're gone and
the lights go out so slow
I'm missing you each morning
Days gone by
Again I feel the longing
to look you in the eye

You know I'll never let you go
You know I'll never hurt so bad
And if It takes a thousand Years
I will be right there By Your Side
You know I'll never let you go
When I lost you I was blind
And everytime I catch my tear
I will be right there by your side

I feel you when you're watching from afar
To young to leave me standing
I wonder where you are
The precious time we spent
my fondest memories
I'll hold on to the promise
That You made to me

You know I'll never let you go
You know I'll never hurt so bad
And if It takes a thousand Years
I will be right there By Your Side
You know I'll never hurt so much
When I lost you I was blind
And everytime I catch with tears
You are right there by my side

I stare into his eyes
and then I see your face
A dying love inside
a love you can't replace
You're looking down with pride
And let me show what I can tell

So long my dear departed
where did you go
I can't believe you're gone and
My lights go out so slow

You know I'll never let you go
You know I'll never hurt so bad
And if It takes a thousand years
I will be right there By Your Side
You know I'll never let you go
When I lost you I was blind
And everytime I catch with tears
You are right there by my side
