Mudkicker!

We stand accused but you lie
Varicose-veined finger
Prejudiced evil mind
The young get stronger
Free living fast
But you're a sapsucker
Ain't gonna last

Your twisted mouths feed the minds of babes
Taught from birth it's crime that pays
One man's fortune is another man's pain
But that's how you play the game

I ain't the child of your disgrace
Mudkickin' into my face
I've healed the wounds, been crucified
Mudkicker kick

All rise, 'cause here comes the boss
He's your big brother, the silver tongue's doublecross
His collar starched white, big black briefcase held tight
It holds the power to your demise

The corporation blue sedan
Behind the wheel Mr. Business-man
Thinks he's got the upper hand
But he misunderstands

I ain't the child of your disgrace
Mudkick into my face
Healed the wounds, been crucified
Mudkicker kick
I ain't the child of your disgrace
Mudkicker into my face
I've healed the wounds, been crucified
Mudkicker kick

Fuckin' Tokyo, you rock an' roll!

Your prestige is clear as day
But I can scrape the sewer bilge and see the same
The young get stronger, free living fast
You're a sapsucker, ain't gonna last, no

I ain't the child of your disgrace
You're mudkickin' into my face
I've healed the wounds, I been crucified
Mudkicker kick
I ain't the child of your disgrace
Mudkicker into my face
I've healed the wounds, been crucified
Mudkicker kick
Mudkicker kick, kickin' me down
Mudkicker kickin' me all around
Mudkicker kick, kickin' me down
Mudkicker
Mudkicker kick, kickin' me down
Mudkicker kickin' me all around
Mudkicker kick, kickin' me down
Mudkicker kick

I said mudkicker, I said mud
We don't fuck around, no

Gimme some lights out Tokyo, right here
Hello, hello, hello
You guys are screaming so loud, you're gonna be coming through every fucking stereo system speaker on the planet Earth!
