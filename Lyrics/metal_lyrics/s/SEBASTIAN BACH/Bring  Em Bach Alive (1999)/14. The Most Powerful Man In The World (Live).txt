If I could love you all
I would be the most powerful man in the world
And if I could conquer hate
Love would be my fate
For sure

'Cause I've danced with clowns
And have hugged fools
Where love's concerned
There are no rules

If I could burn my past
With a match
I easily would
Then to begin again
I would be the most powerful man in the world

'Cause I've danced with clowns
And have hugged fools

If I could love you all
I would be the most powerful man in the world
