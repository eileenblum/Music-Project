Anyone, almost everyone doesn't like to be alone
There's no match no the road and the crowd is going home

All along I've been knocking off my friends one by one
And now I see I'm not the only, only, only one

Does it help you to cry when you're alone?
Is it worth is?
Do you even like home?

Superjerk, Superstar, Supertears stream down his face
Vagrant stud, vagrant stud

All along I've been knocking off my friends one by one
And now I see I'm not the only, only, only one

Does it help you to cry when you're alone?
Is it worth is?
Do you even like home?

Superjerk, Superstar, Supertears stream down his face
