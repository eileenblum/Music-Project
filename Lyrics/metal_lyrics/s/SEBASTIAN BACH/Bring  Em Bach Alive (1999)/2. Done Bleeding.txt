You came to me in my disbelief
Suspicions running wild
Confuse me
Too good to be true
Angel soaring free
My trust was broke
When the devil used me

My battered heart
Was torn and ripped apart
Transgression into lies and treason

Well, I'm done bleeding, or so they say
I won't get in line to get thrown away
And I'm done bleeding, or so I'm told
Suck the blood straight from the stone

Stayed stinking drunk
Frat house Magna Cum Laude Punk
Toy for the mind anything that soothes me
Taste my disease
I'm a masochist to please
My love for you
Drove me to rack and ruin

So if I seem uptight
Scarred from the switchblade knife
Scarred for life when the cut's done healing

Well, I'm done bleeding, or so they say
I won't get in line to get thrown away
And I'm done bleeding, or so I'm told
Suck the blood straight from the stone

Come tap the vein
My heart remains the same
Keep beating
Done bleeding

Well, I'm done bleeding, or so they say
I won't get in line to get thrown away
And I'm done feeling times are tough
Strike me down, I'll get right back up at you
Straight from the stone
Straight out, straight out, straight out

Done bleeding
Done bleeding
Done bleeding
Done bleeding
