Blasphemer, you're not too blessed
You're a mystery mess
Blasphemer

You've come untied
You've come undressed
Blasphemer

Close your eyes and the world succumbs
Cherry bide, lovely laser lungs
Blasphemer

The throne by default
Certainly's not my fault
Blasphemer

Blasphemer, you know your place
Turn off your face
Blasphemer

Bind my limbs but untie the truth
Old or young, we're the same as you
Blasphemer

You're not too blessed
You're a mystery mess
You've come untied
You've come undressed
You know your place
Turn off your face
