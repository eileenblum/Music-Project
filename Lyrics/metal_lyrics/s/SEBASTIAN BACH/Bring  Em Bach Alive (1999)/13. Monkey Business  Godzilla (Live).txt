[Monkey Business (Skid Row)]

Outside my window there's a
Whole lot of trouble comin'
The cartoon killers and the
Rag cover clones
Stack heels kickin' rhythm
Of social circumcision
Can't close the closet on
Shoe box full of bones

Kangaroo lady with her bourbon
in a pouch
Can't afford the rental on
a bamboo couch
Collecting back her favors 'cause her
well is running dry
I know her act is terminal,
But she ain't gonna die

Slim intoxicado drinkin' dime
store hooch
Is always in a circle with his
part-time pooch
Little creepy's playing dollies in the
New York rain
Thinkin' Bowie's just a knife
Ooh the pain

I ain't seen the sun since I don't
know when
The freaks come out at nine
And it's twenty to ten
What's this funk
That you call junk
To me it's just monkey business

Blind man in the vox that will
probably die
The village kids laugh as they walk by
A psycho is on the edge of this human
garbage dump
And the vultures in the sewers
are telling
Him to jump

Into the fire from the frying pan
Tripping on his tongue
For a cool place to stand
Where's this shade
That you've got it made
To me it's just monkey business

Monkey business
Slippin' on the track
Monkey business
Jungle in black
Ain't your business if I got
No monkey on my back

Monkey business
Slippin' on the track
Monkey business
Jungle in black
Ain't your business
If I got
Monkey's on my back

[Godzilla (Blue Ãyster Cult)]

With a purposeful grimace and a terrible sound
He pulls the spitting high tension wires down

Helpless people on a subway train
Scream bug-eyed as he looks in on them

He picks up a bus and he throws it back down
As he wades through the buildings toward the center of town

Oh no, they say he's got to go go go Godzilla
Oh no, there goes Tokyo go go Godzilla

History shows again and again
How nature points up the folly of men

[Monkey Business (reprise) (Skid Row)]

The Vaseline gypsies and silicone souls
Dressed to the society
Hypocrite heartbeat and cheap alibis
Can't get you by that monkey

Monkey business
Slippin' on the track
Monkey business
Jungle in black
Ain't your business if I got
No monkey on my back

Monkey business
Slippin' on the track
Monkey business
Jungle in black
Ain't your business
If I got
Monkey's on my back
