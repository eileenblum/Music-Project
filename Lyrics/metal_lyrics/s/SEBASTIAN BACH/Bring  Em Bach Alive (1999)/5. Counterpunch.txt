I wanna kiss you, wanna kill you
Fill you
You wanna fight me, wanna like me
Bite me,
You wanna give it up
I'll never give it up
I wanna forget it but my mind won't let it go

We are seduced and then forgotten
By the fist of ill-begotten gains
When you hit the wall
Scale the heights and take the fall
When nothing's all there is
You've hit the skids.

First you date me, then forsake me
Rape me
Top of the mountain, then we
Drown in the fountain
Blood brothers. Godfathers. Sweet sisters
Blah blah blah
Best of friends
Stabbed each other in the end

You're so sweet
Sweet enough to smack
Or maybe we're just tough nuts to crack
When you hit the wall
Scale the heights and take the fall
When nothing's all there is
You've hit the skids.
