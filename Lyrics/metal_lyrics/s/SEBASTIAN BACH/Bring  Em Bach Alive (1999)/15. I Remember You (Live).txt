You remember me, Japan?
Because I remember you, baby!
Sing with me one time

Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
And when you needed me I came through

I paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
So that I knew that you were there for me
Time after time you were there for me

Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
Love letter's innocence - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you

We spend the summer with the top rolled down
Wished ever after would be like this
You said I love you babe", whitout a sound
I said I'd give my life for just one kiss
I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss

Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
Love letter's innocence - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you

We've had our share of hard times
But that's the price we paid
And through it all we kept the promise that we made......

I swear you'll never be lonely

Mr Richie Scarlet on the lead guitar, right here

Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
Washed away a dream of you
But nothing else could ever take you away
'Cause you'll always be my dream come true
Hey Tokyo, I love you

Love letter's innocence - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you
Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
Love letter's innocence - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you
