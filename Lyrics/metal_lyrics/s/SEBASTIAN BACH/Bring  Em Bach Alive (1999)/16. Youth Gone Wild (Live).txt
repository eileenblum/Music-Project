Alright, Tokyo, this is for all the fucking Youth...
I say Tokyo, this is for all the Youth Gone Wild

Since I was born they couldn't hold me down
Another misfit kid, another burned-out town
I never played by the rules, I never really cared
My nasty reputation took me to Tokyo, Japan

Well, I look and see it's not only me
So many others have stood where I stand
We are the young, raise your hands

They call us problem child
We spent our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile
We are the youth gone wild
We stand and we won't fall
We're one and one for all
The writing's on the wall
We are the youth gone wild

Boss screamin' in my ear about who I'm supposed to be
Get a 3-piece Wall Street smile and son you'll look just like me
I said "Hey man, there's something that you ought to know
Park Avenue leads to Skid Row"

I look and see it's not only me
We're standin' tall, ain't never a doubt
We are the young, shout it out

They call us problem child
We spent our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile
We are the youth gone wild
We stand and we won't fall
We're one and one for all
The writing's on the wall
We are the youth gone wild
Let me hear you wild

They call us problem child
We spent our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile
We are the youth gone wild
We stand and we won't fall
We're one and one for all
The writing's on the wall
We are the youth gone wild

We are the youth gone wild
We are the youth gone wild
We are the youth gone wild

We are the youth gone wild
