Got no more feeling
Iâm done with dreaming
Giving you all that I have
Taken for granted
Iâll take no chances
Doing the best that I can
When you see her
Call my name
Donât you tell her
This loveâs in vain

And if youâve had enough
Iâll stand here waiting, no hesitating
And if youâre out of love
Iâll be staying, Iâll still be waiting

Youâre outta patience, Iâm outta pride
How did it come to this?
I got no excuses, I got nowhere to hide
I live and I die for your kiss

When you see her
Remember this
Never tell her
That she wasnât meant for this

And if youâve had enough
Iâll stand here waiting, no hesitating
And if youâre out of love
Iâll be staying, Iâll still be waiting

Never be no more yesterdays
I canât be there for yesterday

And if youâve had enough
Iâll stand here waiting, no hesitating
And if youâre out of love
Iâll be staying, Iâll still be waiting

And if you havenât had enough
Iâll be staying and Iâll still be waiting...

Iâll be here waiting for you, oh...
