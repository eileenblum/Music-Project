We are the disengaged
From a freak state
What goes on in your mind?
Secrets on your phone
She doesnât know I know
Ainât no way to deny

No I donât wanna die
Donât wanna die alone
No, no, no, no
Still got eternity
Laid out in front of me

When you hold me tight
Everything feels alright
But behind the lies
Youâll never be mine

I donât want to live
Donât want to live alone
But you donât seem to care
That I donât want to share
No, no, no, no

Sheâs on the sinnerâs throne
Youâve heard the rumors fly
About her wicked ways...
Donât look into her eyes
The late âhe of the nightâ
Sheâs bad in every way

No I donât wanna die
Donât wanna die alone
No, no, no, no
Still got eternity
Laid out in front of me

When you hold me tight
Everything feels alright
But behind the lies
Youâll never be mine

I donât want to be
Donât want to be alone
But I donât care no more
Been devastated before

When you hold me tight
Everything feels alright
But behind the lies
Youâll never be mine

I donât want to see
Donât want to see you alone
Just want you to myself
And nobody else
