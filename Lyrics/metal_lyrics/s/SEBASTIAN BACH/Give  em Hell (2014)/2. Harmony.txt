I hate to say that we crossed a line
There ainât no turning back
I canât believe that I fell for the line
As old as lies can get

I wanna kick myself
I didnât see it

Harmony
Our final act of sin
Hard as itâs to be in love
So easy to forget
Harming me
Until my dying day
This song Iâll sing
Itâs all I got
I ainât going crazy

Shouldâve known youâre way too good for me to be true
Look out for the past
Now itâs catching up with you

I wanna kick myself
I didnât see it

Harmony
Our final act of sin
Hard as itâs to be in love
So easy to forget
Harming me
Until my dying day
This song Iâll sing
Itâs all I got
I ainât going crazy

Harmony
Guilty as sin
Hard as itâs to be in love
So easy to forget
Scarring me
Until my dying day
This song Iâll sing is all I got
I ainât going crazy
