Ah...
Ah...

Why is love pain?
Tell me why
Must love leave me again?

Iâm trying hard to forget you but I donât know if I can
Iâm not afraid to forget you âcause youâll never let me in

Lie straight to my face
Outta time
In the bed you made

Iâm trying hard to forget you but I donât know if I can
Iâm not afraid to forget you âcause youâll never let me in
You choke the very heart from me â sweet suicidal dream
And now Iâm living inside myself where you canât get to me

Iâm trying hard to forget you but I donât know if I can

You choke the very heart from me â sweet suicidal dream
And now Iâm living inside myself where you canât get to me
