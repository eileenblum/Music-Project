All my friends are dead
Iâm left all alone
Still I live and breathe
We are the left behind
Contempt to prophesize
Eternal rest in peace

Your turn to rescue me
Itâs too late to turn back now

Oh... oh...
All my friends are dead
Oh... oh...
And I donât have time to live a lie
And itâs too late to wonder why
Too late to turn back time again
âCause all my friends are dead!

All the days gone by
Mistaken for a ride
Ultimate sacrifice
We are what we destroy
Discarded like some toy
A childâs game of dice to play

Your turn to rescue me
Itâs too late to turn back now

Oh... oh...
All my friends are dead
Oh... oh...
And I donât have time to live a lie
And itâs too late to wonder why
Too late to turn back time again
âCause all my friends are dead!
âCause all my friends are dead!
âCause all my friends are dead...!

Oh...

Oh... oh...
All my friends are dead
Oh... oh...
And I donât have time to live a lie
And itâs too late to wonder why
Too late to turn back time again
âCause all my friends are dead!
