Hell inside my head...
Iâm on the run, into the new arms someplace
Run... Iâm on the run, inside my head
Running some loving madness
Destiny has put me to the test
Like kerosene, Iâm setting fire to the blackness!

Iâm on my way, until your bleeding, making you screaming
Iâm out of day, Iâm realizing, this is my time of rising!

Why? Why me not him? I canât get out
I am a slave to your system
Lives... Iâm out of lives, wasting my time, taking back all I can be
Canât you see, sheâs hard to possess
Hard to please, sheâs a disappearing mistress

Iâm on my way, until your bleeding, making you screaming
Iâm out of day, Iâm realizing, this is my time of rising!

Call me...
When you need a hustle break
Donât make me...
Tell you why I canât escape
Love is just a dream

Iâm on my way, until your bleeding, making you screaming
Iâm out of day, Iâm realizing, this is my time of rising!

Iâm on my way, finding freedom has left me breathing
Iâm out of day, until itâs over, I seem to be getting closer!
