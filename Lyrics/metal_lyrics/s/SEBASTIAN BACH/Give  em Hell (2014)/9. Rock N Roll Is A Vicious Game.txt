He rocked his way through yesterday, lord he thought he had a chance
He played guitar and wrote some tunes, of love and romance
He did his share of traveling, like a dog without a home
A fugitive who would rather give, a star that never shone

Isnât it a pity, isnât it a shame?
No one ever warned the boy: rock nâ roll is a vicious game
Oh yeah

He said he wouldnât get led around, or caught up in the games
Or end up in a gallery of faces with no names
And rock ânâ roll was in his soul, and music was a friend
He recorded a song that made us sing along, and he was on the road again

Isnât it a pity, isnât it a shame?
No one ever warned the boy: rock ânâ roll is a vicious game
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh... oh yeah, oh...
Stage fright, oh, and long black limousines
Heâs pushing himself a way too hard, or so it seems

He opened up his heart to us, he gave us what he could
We sympathized and harmonized, he made us all feel good
But itâs funny how those things can change, and time can pass us by
Songs that moved us so easily, no longer make us cry

Isnât it a pity, isnât it a shame?
No one ever warned the boy: rock ânâ roll is a vicious game
Oh yeah, oh... oh yeah
Rock ânâ roll is a vicious game
Rock ânâ roll is a vicious game, oh... oh!
Rock ânâ roll is a vicious game, oh yeah, no, no...
Rock ânâ roll is a vicious game
Rock ânâ roll is a vicious game, oh...
