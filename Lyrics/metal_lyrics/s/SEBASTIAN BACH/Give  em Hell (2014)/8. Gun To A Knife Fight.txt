I drink like I got something to prove
And I fight like I got nothing left to lose

On the bar, broken body in two
Faster on the draw than you ever saw
Now Iâm standing over you

I havenât always known a right from wrong and on and on
Try, thereâs a lesson that I have to learn and solve

I live by the bullet and the blade
Youâll try, ainât never gonna put me in my grave
Heart of steel, ainât nothing I feel
Iâd walk through hell before a prison cell
Ainât gonna take your deal

I havenât always known a right from wrong and on and on
Try, thereâs a lesson that I have to learn and solve

Dream about you every night
Sing into the pale moonlight
Die, but Iâll die on my own terms
You wonât take me alive

I donât wanna back away again, no
I donât wanna back away again, no
I donât wanna say no more
I just wanna even the score
I donât wanna lay my weapons down again

I havenât always known a right from wrong and on and on
Try, thereâs a lesson that I have to learn and solve

Dream about you every night
Sing into the pale moonlight
Die, but Iâll die on my own terms
You wonât take me alive
