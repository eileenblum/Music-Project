You know you drive me wild
Angelic demon child
A living succubus
You own me

I fell into your eyes
Your lips they hypnotize
You are my everything
My only

Sexual tension that I canât explain
Under your spell Iâm addicted to pain

You love to torture me
Sensual dominator
Tie me up and then you leave
This love is going nowhere

And when I come
I come only for you
Thrashing my bonds
Believe in the feeling sheâs true

And when you bite my neck
Draw blood drips down my chest
My hearts got nothing left
You broke me

Your touch I canât resist
Living dying just for this
Your poison is a kiss
Iâm jonesing

Sexual tension that I canât explain
Under your spell Iâm addicted to pain

You love to torture me
Sensual dominator
Tie me up and then you leave
This love is going nowhere

And when I come
I come only for you
Thrashing my bonds
Believe in the feeling sheâs true

You love to torture me
Sensual dominator
Tie me up and then you leave
This love is going nowhere

And when I come
I come only for you
Thrashing my bonds
Believe in the feeling sheâs true

Ah...
Ah...
