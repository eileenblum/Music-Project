Into the ring, let the games begin, I call you out
You stomp me down and make me want to scream and shout

Salvation â rips the very heart of me
Well if you make me have to beg, borrow, steal
For some affection
You know you make me feel

Itâs like I beat my head into the wall
I fight for your love and spend all my time in protocol

I give you my heart you can even take all of my wine

Iâll fight for your love and Iâll wait for you in blackest night, oh yeah
