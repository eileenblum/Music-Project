I want to keep you, shut the door, throw away the key
For you belong to me
You want to run, you want to hide, you try to leave
There is no hope, youâll see

I canât control myself
I push away
And Iâm left beside myself
Your love is so far away
When I need you close your gone again

I stalk your every move, so beautiful to me
And my twisted fantasies
I shut my eyes, youâre all I see, youâre in my dreams
And I wonât let anyone take you away from me

I canât control myself
I push away
And Iâm left beside myself
Your love is so far away
When I need you close your gone again

When I cling too tight â hold on
When I hold too tight â donât let go
âCause when I push you away, is when I need you the most
I need you the most!

I lost myself and youâre lost through my grace
Then I build a temple to your soul and Iâll obey
And I will worship on the ground you lay

I canât control myself
I push away
