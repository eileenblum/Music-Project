Living from 9-to-5
Anything but alive...
Crazy!
Crashing into eternity!

I'm like Amanda Bynes
Insane, I cross the line
I've got no hint of apology

Sometimes there ain't no escape
From bad decisions I've made
The situation will never change

Taking back tomorrow!
Another day of time I borrowed
I'm taking back tomorrow from today
Walk away

I am a haunted man
Lost everything I had
Ain't nothing left that you can take from me

All I know in life
Is hatred, fear and strife
All I am is everything I've seen

Sometimes there ain't no escape
From bad decisions I've made
The situation will never change

Taking back tomorrow!
Another day of time I borrowed
I'm taking back tomorrow from today
Walk away

All is lost
All is found
Count the cost
You're not around

Taking back tomorrow!
Another day of time I borrowed
I'm taking back tomorrow from today

Taking back tomorrow!
Another day of time I borrowed
I'm taking back tomorrow from today
Walk away
