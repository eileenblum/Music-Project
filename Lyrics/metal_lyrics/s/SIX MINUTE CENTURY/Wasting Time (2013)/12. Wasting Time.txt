Blindly searching for walls without hands
The end of ages, it knows no pardon
Conceding to all of life's torments
Seeking shelter in ruin

Trapped, forever a grain of sand
Caught in between hope and despair
Rounding each corner, never turning away
With no assurance, only a reckoning

Burning inside
Will fate and destiny collide?
Wasting time, it feels like chance is passing me by
Wasting time, no regrets, what's done is done, survive

Deja vu chapter two is incomplete
Getting closer, even I believe
On the brink this old fool, now he sees
That this is where I'm supposed to be

The suffering it never ends, it only sleeps
Poised to escape like a crazed beast
Wreaking havoc and misery
Time to make a move before it's too late

Burning inside
Will fate and destiny collide?
Wasting time, it feels like chance is passing me by
Wasting time, no regrets, what's done is done, survive

Burning inside
Will fate and destiny collide?
Wasting time, it feels like chance is passing me by
Wasting time, no regrets, what's done is done, survive
