He awakes to their constant screams
Enraged by the agony in their pleas

With a sinister smile
He readies himself for a nasty surprise
Searching for the latest headlines

Welcome to Needham Point

Bathed in neon light
He emerges from the shadows
So easily enticed

Countless faces
Bloodstained traces
The dealer of death's hand

On his way to Needham Point
A puppet pulled by strings that are broke

Once again we find ourselves drawn here
Like a moth to the flame
A reoccurring dream, one from which we'll never wake

Just a stone's thrown away
Busy street passerby, his domain

On his way to Needham Point
A puppet pulled by strings that are broke

A devil in a jester's court
We're all welcome at Needham Point
