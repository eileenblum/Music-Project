Rising tides, there's an approaching storm
The waves crash harder against the docks
Family and friends you much brace for the worst
From the dark clouds that loom on the horizon

The winds scream a horrendous song
As nature's fury moves onshore

Water begins to consume everything
The walls are ripped away

Ravaged by one of history's deadliest storms
We must preserve the memory of those who were lost

Being alive doesn't mean they survived
Affecting rich, old, poor and young

1900
No way to have known
A city of hope

1900
No way to have been warned
A city left in ruins

Shattered dream litter battered streets
But Galveston will forever endure...Galveston

1900
No way to have known
A city of hope

1900
No way to have been warned
A city left in ruins
