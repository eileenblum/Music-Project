Left to wander through dark valleys
No direction leads to the way out

Praying to elude wolves who keep howling
Through snarled teeth they grin a venomous smile

Are you afraid and all alone?
Time doesn't always heal
Some wounds are left unclean
Look for that defining moment to change

If the ground beneath begins to crumble
Just remember even the righteous stumble

The trick is not to be mesmerized
Fooled or deceived by the glamorized

Are you afraid and all alone?
Time doesn't always heal
Some wounds are left unclean
Look for that defining moment to change

Fragile shards of belief
Dangling from a dream
Look for that defining moment to change

Are you afraid and all alone?
Time doesn't always heal
Some wounds are left unclean
Look for that defining moment to change

Fragile shards of belief
Dangling from a dream
Look for that defining moment to change
