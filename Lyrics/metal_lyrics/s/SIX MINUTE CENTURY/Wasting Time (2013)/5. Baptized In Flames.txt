No need to cry
Soon it will all be over
Yes, he'll greet us
Before the last embers smolder
Rendezvous at the river
By the shore
Never to cry anymore

Congregation raise your voices
As foretold the prophecy
Together we will make a stand
Let our blood be on their hands

Thieves are knocking at the door
Here to steal eternal life from us

Baptized in flames
Born again

They came here to judge us
We will only be sentenced by God
By the eyes of the beholder
Who's keeping watch over all

Healed by unholy water
A rapture of fire

Baptized in flames
Born again
Baptized in flames
Kneel before the King of Kings

Outside Waco
Raged hell's inferno
Forgive them, they know not what they've done
What have they done?
Burnt Bibles in hands clinching
Smoking ash for pages

To err is human, to forgive divine

Rendered asunder by a fiery blunder

Baptized in flames
Born again
Baptized in flames
Kneel before the King of Kings
