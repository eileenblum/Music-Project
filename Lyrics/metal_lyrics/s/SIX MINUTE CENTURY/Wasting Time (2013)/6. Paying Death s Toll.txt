Soulless fowls led to water
Drowning in a churning sea
Dragged deeper
Tearing at them from beneath
Only one solution

Through the flames we abide
Weary we march on

A misfortune, only frustration
Leading you to only eternal damnation
Is there no solution?

Through the flames we abide
Weary we march on
With no fear in our eyes
We're paying death's toll

Banters of a tomorrow
Of grandeur things
Of a world without sorrow
What a world indeed

Let faith guide us
Carry us on broken wings
Relieving life's pressures

Through the flames we abide
Weary we march on
With no fear in our eyes
We're paying death's toll
