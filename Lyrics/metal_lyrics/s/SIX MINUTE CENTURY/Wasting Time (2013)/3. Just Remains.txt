Hey, Mr. Undertaker
Please don't take away my friend
Life's bloods had been drained
There's so much left unexplained
Oh Lord! Please resurrect him

If you could halt time's advance
What's the first thing you'd change?
Whatever's left is just remains
Beacons that flicker then fade

Is there no resolution?
Vultures perched ready to feast
Chalk lines left to erase
Toe tags for the deceased

If you could halt time's advance
What's the first thing you'd change?

Whatever's left is just remains
Beacons that flicker then fade

Whatever's left is just remains
Vessels led astray

You can't halt time's advance
You see, we're victims of circumstance

Whatever's left is just remains
Beacons that flicker then fade
Whatever's left is just remains
Vessels led astray
