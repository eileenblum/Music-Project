Here at the peoples temple all are welcomed
Please call me Father
For I am sent to heal you and to mend you
I'll lead you from temptation

Soon we'll be taking a journey
Into the land of milk and honey
Together we'll build a kingdom
And flee those who oppose us

And there we'll live out our...
Last days in paradise
I'll never deceive you, no I would never lie
Last days in paradise
We'll live forever amen

Now that we're together her in Guyana
I will always protect you, Keep you from evil

And there we'll live out our...
Last days in paradise
I'll never deceive you, no I would never lie
Last days in paradise
We'll live forever amen
