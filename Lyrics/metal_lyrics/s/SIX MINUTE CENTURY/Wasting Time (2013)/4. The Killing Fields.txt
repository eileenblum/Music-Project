Down a dark and winding road
Near a place I often go
Behind a rusty chainlink fence

Overgrown the lot is bare
Now only a place of mystery
Young lives brought to an end

Soon you'll understand the pain
Of those who still remain
And for all those tears they've cried
We'll avenge their lives

In this place not far from home
The killing fields, they grow

A monster on the prowl
He's killed since then there's no doubt
How many still go unnamed

Is there anyone who cares?
Is there anyone to shed a tear?
And for all those tears they've cried
We'll avenge their lives

In this place not far from home
The killing fields, they grow
Repulsed by your actions, the wicked shall fall
The killing fields will cease to grow

Provoking anger I lash out at what you believe in

Admit that he is real...and that he's still out there
Maybe you have seen his face
Brushing shoulders in passing
Did you catch his stare exchanging glances?
Did his laughter, did it make you cringe?

In this place not far from home
The killing fields, they grow
In this place not far from home
The killing fields, they grow
Repulsed by your actions, the wicked shall fall
The killing fields will cease to grow
They'll grow no more
