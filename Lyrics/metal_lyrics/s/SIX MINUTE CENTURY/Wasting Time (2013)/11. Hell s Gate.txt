A poor farmer's boy just becoming a man
Awkward, a rogue teetering on the edge
A beauty as sweet as she could be
Waitressing just to make ends meet
Who knew what their chance meeting would bring?

Incognito, alliances formed
A golden flash, a muzzle flare, hell's gate opens

A legend spoken of since I was a child
Of two young lovers destined by the gun
How they robbed and murdered
Wanted dead or alive
When the smoke cleared
They land side by side

Death for Bonnie and Clyde

Blood hounds at their feet
Lawmen pursued them to hell's gate

A bullet ridden fate
Beelzebub waits, swinging from hell's gate

Fast cars, the thrill of the chase
Wide open guns blazing
Screaming through hell's gate
