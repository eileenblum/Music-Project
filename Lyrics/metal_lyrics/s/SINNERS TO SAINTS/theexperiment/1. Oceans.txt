how does it feel to know that you could've saved that life
but you were too concerned (but you were too concerned)
with the vices in your own life
keep treading water, it's closing in
when you start drowning does instinct teach you to swim?
or do you hear your life begin to end
keep treading water, we're miles in
keep treading water, no time to swim
it feels like we're stranded in the middle of the ocean
the tides man are running dry
so save your breath
cast the anchor, we're closing in
put forth your wager, i bet he swims
I live my life amidst the water of the ocean
From down here the stars look so bright (so bright)
Ill throw my life away, just show me what it takes to be alive
We were so close we ran aground, but the undertow keeps pulling us down
I wanna know what its like to be alive, but dead inside
How can you change the tides, when they're so strong against you
I think Its time we saved some lives, I will start with mine,
I will never drown
