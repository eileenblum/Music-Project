This is an endless struggle.
You put your life on the line.
We've run for miles and miles,
losing ground and wasting our time.

Oh Great Healer! 
Can you raise us from the dead?
Our hearts are hardened.
We've been misled! 

I feel like giving in. 
I feel it slipping away.
I feel it under my skin. 

So show me the way!

We turn to You in times of sorrow,
when desolation fills the air!

I am the prophet of salvation!

He controls the movement of the mountains.
He commands the creatures of the ocean!
Repent or perish with this nation. 
Transcend yourself to find salvation.

Only with true faith will you walk upon the ocean.
