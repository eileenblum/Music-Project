You make me sick
What made me think that you would change for anything?
For anyone?

I sacrificed for you and me
I made it right and you walked away
When you come back I'll be gone
So make up your mind 'cause I know you're wrong (I know you're wrong)

Wait for me! I haven't decided where I want to be!
So suck it up and wait for,

Pray for me! I haven't decided who I want to be
So suck it up and get away

Come with me! I'll show you what happens when love's gone astray

Am I losing control? I can't feel a thing! What have you done to me?

Get out

I owe you nothing,
For failure was our greatest accomplishment!

When will you live again?
When will you love again?
I was selfish now i must face myself.
