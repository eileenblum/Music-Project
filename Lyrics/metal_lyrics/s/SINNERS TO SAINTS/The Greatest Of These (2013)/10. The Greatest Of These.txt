How can we love when
apathy runs through society's veins?

Pouring champagne 
just to watch a drug addict 
lead his wife and kids to a broken home. 
That's no way to raise a family. 

They separate and force the vows they took
to fracture like bones, 
leaving the kids on their own
to live in a fatherless home. 

How did we end up like this?
We kiss with deceit on our lips. 
The whispers, the secrets,
we act like it's natural 
but I don't believe it. 

I don't believe it,
that there's no hope
for those who feel defeated by a broken home. 

A whore and the attention she craves
to fill a void that a loveless father made. 
Revenge is the sweetest of things 
when there's hate on your lips 

I don't buy it. 
No, not for a second.
This isn't who you are
You're better than this 

Hidden bruises to cover the fact
that a father abuses his children.
Hiding bruises to cover the fact
that your daddy still beats you. 

How did we end up like this?
We kiss with deceit on our lips. 
The whispers, the secrets,
we act like it's natural 
but I don't believe it. 
I don't believe it,
that there's no hope
for those who feel defeated by a broken home.
