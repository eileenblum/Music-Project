Lonely and broken, 
I've found that
silence was golden 
in the age of kings. 
But you'd stay silent 
to withhold the pain you were feeling

I'm sick of watching 
you sell yourself short.
Together, we'd take a city like Rome.
But i'll take the world,
i'll take the world alone.

You're walking a thin line
Stonewalling closure with evasive accusations. 

Stop testing the waters and just dive in. 

You were my best friend [x2]
Don't look back it's in the past.
You knew this wouldn't last.
Your silence broke me in the end.

Your actions spoke louder than your voice could scream. 
The only thing you taught me was how to leave you.

Take a look and maybe you'll see.
The difference between you and me
is that I kept trying, and you gave in 
you left me rotting so I don't wanna see you again. 

I for one will never see the point in 
just forgetting everything about us. 
But you have shown me 
that nothing's worth waiting for you!
