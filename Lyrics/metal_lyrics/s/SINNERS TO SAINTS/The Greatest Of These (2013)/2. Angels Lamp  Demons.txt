Lifeless, alone, deprived. 
I lost all sense of innocence when 
success enticed me to the roots of my sins.
Failure to grow, a lack of inspiration. 

How can we grow? 
How can we grow if we starve the roots that we made? 
How can we grow if thereâs nowhere to plant a seed. 

These thoughts are resonating as I lay on a bed of nails. 
Fragile hands, blinded by my ego, 
pondering how I accessed these two shades of grey. 

I can hear demons fighting for me.  
Iâm laying on my death bed and now I see  
I can hear angels fighting for me.
Thereâs a war for my soul, and this is what was said. 

âGive inâ. I hear the demons calling,
âGive up, Youâre not worth His love. 
Youâre life means nothing to Him. 
Heâs a liar and your life heâs ruined." 

"Enough". I hear the angels calling, 
"His Love, is what kept me going. 
Your existence is the proof I need. 
My Godâs alive, and youâll never break me." 

So long 
my body shakes and quivers 
while faceless entities surround this deathbed Iâve made. 
Itâs hard to act when faced with all my mistakes, 
but His love washes my past away. 

Am I no better than demons?
His love, His Grace, His constant, everlasting reign. 
Iâve failed to live according to His will. 
I stand before my King as judgmentâs placed on me. 

Build up your kingdoms and hide your treasures. 
You decide the life you lead, but you canât take it with you.
