Say when,
tell me go and i will go
to wherever You send me.
You are my everything.

I live by faith and i'm ready for anything.
Until you break you will stand for nothing. 

How many times will you 
conquer the world looking for purpose 
only to find that you've 
lost your soul? 
And you still think it's worth it?

So you wanna run your mouth?
Well I'll give you something to talk about

The earth will tremble at the sound of his voice.

Every saint has a past,
every sinner has a future.
I will not let the things i've done 
define the man i know i'm supposed to become

My God, make me a vessel anchored by faith.
