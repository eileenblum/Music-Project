Stop living so safely.
Tear down your walls.
There's a world outside of them 
waiting for you to conquer it.

Stop living so safely.
Love, and forget what it's like to break. 
Learn from your mistakes
and let the world crumble in your wake.

These are the remnants of my ideology for you and I
(for you and I)

I swear it'd be perfect
I swear it'd be worth it
If you could see like me! [x2]

You say you're a dreamer,
that you live for your dreams,
but you don't stay awake
long enough to chase them;
long enough to make them happen.  

My eyes are getting heavier 
And the lights are getting brighter
with every second we wait;
We waste. 

Stop hiding behind the safety of mediocrity.
The world is yours to take,
so love, and forget what it's like to break.

I don't wanna wait for you
to realize that what we've got going
is something much better than the lies you hide behind [x2]

Live your life!
Live your life,
don't let the world decide for you.
