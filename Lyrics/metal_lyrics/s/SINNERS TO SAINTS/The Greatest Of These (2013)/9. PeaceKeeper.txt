Salutations
to the one who 
made a pact along the lines of a fashion vice.
With jewels so cunning saints cower.
Behind the eyes of the blind
there sits a portrait on the stand 
with a label that reads
"a sodomizer with no hope of a family."

There's nothing left
The bandages of the broken have come undone
There's nothing left
Why do we bow before lust?
Rip your eyes out
Outer beautyâs guilty pleasure is so, a sin.
Lusts the thread that will sew us in to bondage.  

Your disposition leads to disbelief (Disbelief)
A cold deceit flows through your eyes, despite disaster. 
The seams youâve reaped have been sewn.

Congratulations
to the one who
carries his cross in the midst of failures. 
Trial after trial we succumb to stumble.
Thereâs no erasing time.
But turn away from our troubled faces
bearing His mark in the darkest of places.

I surrender myself
to something greater.
Show me peace of mind.
Peacekeeper, faith over fear,
I hear You calling.
This is my prayer. 

Illuminate the darkness.
With this I start inside.

Eyes open wide.
Illuminate the blind
The key is in who you believe
We bow to one God
Surrender all your pride
And see the promise of eternity
