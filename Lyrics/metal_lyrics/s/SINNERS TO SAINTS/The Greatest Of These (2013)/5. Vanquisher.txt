Everyday I wake up and I thank you 
for what you have given to me,
For what I am has nothing to do with me!

In a sea of endless love 
these waves come crashing down on me!

Today everything we have made will go to waste. 
But, in Him we are everything we need to be. 

Take away what I've made, I will stay faithful.
Take away what I've made, I will stay faithful. 

You took away everything I am, I will stay faithful. 
I am stronger than the greatest army you could mount against me.

Hallelujah, I'm saved by Your grace [x2]

Hallelujah saved by Your grace
by your grace (woah)
Hallelujah saved by grace
By Your grace! [x2]
