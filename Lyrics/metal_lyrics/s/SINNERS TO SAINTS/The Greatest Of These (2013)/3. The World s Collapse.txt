We sought to find you as we called out your name, 
but you'd run, run, run, always pushing away your home. 

This life means so much more than your pride. 
True love opens the door. 

Running back and forth. 
Confused uneasy eyes. 
With Him in sight, live the life youâre supposed to live. 

Are you content with yourself? [x2]
Are you alive? 

This is love when needed the most. 
This is love, it wonât fade away. 
This is love, when needed the most, 
we're calling out your name. 

Rise up from below 
in this desolate place where you sit all alone, 
for youâre not dead inside. 

Love lost in the gravity of animosity. 
Fall to your knees! 

I've seen the world fall around me. [x2]

Fall to your knees and embrace your humility. 
You made your world fall collapse. 
Are you proud of yourself? 

You've run away from your faith. 

This life means so much more than your pride. 
True love opens the door. 
Running in circles wonât redeem the lies that you hide. 
There's hope in love. 

This is family, this is love. 
This is what we're made of
