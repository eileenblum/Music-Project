I never said goodbye. 

I anchored vessels with silence 
thinking i had time, but i was wrong. 

I watched the sunrise. 
And the stars, they watch me sleep at night,
so safely, they keep me from forever fading. 

And I'll pray you're in a better place. 
And i swear that i don't wanna be the one to bind you, 
i don't wanna be the one to hold you back. 
You're worth so much more than that. 

I never said good bye, 
and it's the last time 
i build up walls just to pass time. 
Reel in the anchor and chart the waters. 

Open your eyes
and learn to breathe when the air sets fire. 

I watched the sunrise. 
And the stars, they watch me sleep at night, 
so safely, they keep me from forever fading
and light the way back home. 

Go

I swear you'd be proud. [x2]

And i'll pray you're in a better place. 
And i swear that I don't wanna be the one to bind you, 
i don't wanna be the one to hold you back. 

Rest in peace! 

And i'll pray you're in a better place. 
And i swear that I don't wanna be the one to bind you, 
i don't wanna be the one to hold you back. 
You're worth so much more than that.
