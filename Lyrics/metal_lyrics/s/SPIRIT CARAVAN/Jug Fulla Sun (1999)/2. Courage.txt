Courage, Yes,
Her Words Bold And Red
The Vamps They Got Their Fangs On
Bleed Your Given Heart Dead
For Yourself You Must Do It
Life's Furies We Brave
It Was The Scorching Possession
Of That Loving First Gaze Discouraged Maybe, On Emotion
We Ride; That Fated Path Of Being
Where Destinies Collide
One Thing Be Sure, When Push Comes To Shove
There's A Fine Line Of Difference
Between Longing And Love To Flourish, Have Courage
This Round Aint Owin'
Unbound Just Growing
