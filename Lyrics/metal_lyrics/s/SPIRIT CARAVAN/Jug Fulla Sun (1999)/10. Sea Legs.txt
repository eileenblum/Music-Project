From The Warm Unkown Into The Cold Beyond
Message Of Spirit Is What's Drivin' Me On
Climbing Through The Sea
On A Magic Craft From A Sacred Tree
Sea Legs, Earthfin
Bolt And Hammer Gonna Do Them In
I've Got A Two Wheeled Sled Of Molten Chrome
A Well Done Iguana And A Real Heavy Gnome
Gliding Over Fear, The Opposite Of Beyond Is Here
From The Paradise Driven
To Escape The Deluge
Revealed The Mysteries Given
In Exchange For Refuge
Climbing Through The Sea
In My Side Car Rides My Atlantean Queen
Trick It Out!!
