Man Speaks With Forked Tongue
Greed's Hands Reek Of Tainted Blood
Empire's Forged On Cold Deceit
The Few Choices Are Pre-Ordained
Lies And Scorn Are Pain's Receipt
Unheard Voices Of Men Enslaved
Subtle Actions To Mislead
Calculated Program Of Despair
Religion's Factions Control They Feed
For Strength Of Life
We Must Care!!
