Bury My Body, In The Cold Ground
Make'em See What's Left
They'll Wonder Who'll Be Next
All The Lovin' Just To Lie
In The Cold Ground

Seems Like Livin's Just To Learn
Will The World It Always Turn
And The Hatred's Not Disguised
Futile Knowledge, Distant Road,
Future's Image, Tired Eyes

Bury My Body, In The Cold Ground
Endure The Timeless Test
Pass Through This Mortal Quest
Carried By Song, Until I Hear
That Eternal Sound
