Hate On You Can Look Real Pretty
When You're Down And You're Wired
And You're Ready To Love
The Rats Are Big Below That City
And They're Shifting Shape Just To Walk Above And The Race Is Run
Now Get The Bad Undone
With That Healing Tongue The Clown You Hired Just Don't Get It
Slippin' The Rails When He's Supposed To Kill
The Priest So Wired He Just Can't Hit It
Forked Tongue, Hooves, And His Paws In The Till
Healing!!
And The Race Is Run
Now Get The Bad Undone
With That Healing Tongue!!
