Salutations- To The Life Giver
Considerations, Simple And In Tune
Transmutation, Or Be A Pearl
In The Sky, Blood Red Sky Say Hey! How You Feelin' Now?
Have You Come Alive?
The Golden Rays Of Day Will Be Clearin' Out
All Your Poison Jive
It Won't Be Long Until We're All Put To The Test

Let The Skies Be Enough To Entertain
It's A State Of Mind Where The Wisdom Ascertained
When The Page Becomes The Pilot
And All The Questions Loaded, Loaded

Say Hey! How You Feelin' Now?
Have You Come Alive?
The Golden Rays Of Day Will Be Clearin' Out
All Your Poison Jive
It Won't Be Long Before We're All Put To The Test,
To Praise With Song
Creation's Life We're Blessed
