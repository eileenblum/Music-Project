The Moon Comes, Blackness Steals The Light
Spread My Wings To Take Flight
Holiness Is What You Need
To Stop The One That Will Suck You Clean
Suspended Animation, Hypnotized
Drain Your Soul With The Blink Of My Eye
Prince Of Evil, Yeah, That's Right
The Power Is More Yeah Than Might
I Need A Drink To Keep Me Alive
The Feeling Of Fear Is Your Demise
Prince Of Evil Yeah That's Right
The Power Is More Than Might
