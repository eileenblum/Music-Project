Conventions, rejections to being and that perceived
eontentions, inventions, atrophy's a pale reprieve
Tensions, injections, passion's pain to be bereaved

Illusions, seclusions, outlaws and castaways
Losin' confusion, ain't no winning, ain't no pay
Fuck your laws and your ways

Predictions, diction, why and when it was conceived
Contradictions, sorry fiction, cast aside for victory
Caravan flies onward, love and faith is a trusty steed!
