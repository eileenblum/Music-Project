[music &amp; lyrics: Spirit Caravan]

All - seeing eye, mocks lives that go by
Currency inflates, suffering propagates
Ideology designed to spawn hate and crime
Religions to create, to incite not placate

Is there something more to strive to live for
Than to toil every day to have it taken away?

Dark deals are made, in blood debts are paid
And the true Samaritans are framed as charlatans
Because his faith's a different name
Families lay slain
Why do you teach them it's alright
To load a gun and fight

How can this be called humanity
When you poison your own kind knowing all the time

Don't raise your hand against your fellow man
And the children must hear love will always be near
In the schools they must teach immortality's in reach
Through your strength they will find
Peace in heart, breath and mind

Is there something more to strive to live for
Than to toil every day to have it taken away?
