To smile, not fear unknown
Light miles, light years dimensions fold
Sublime is the dawning of awareness

As I climb into the darkness past your sun
To find a place not heartless, ours is done
With mind and breath the will forestalls certain death
To find sanctuary for the children
As I pine for the touch for which I long
To smile, not fear unknown
