Be lucky you've got the mind enough to
Take a look now and stop and think
Not trudge through life with boots of lead
Living for eat, sleep and drink
It's like a sense of instinct restless and aware
So little satisfies, yet there's so much there

It's like a vision baby of how you'd love to be
But the pain in your stomach, ain't on TV

Here we are in Lifer City
Here we are in another fuckin' city
Animals with machines from steel to dust
Thoughts stored in special vials
Drained from a brain before it rots away
Electro, techno, super power
Steel set in the mud and clay

It ain't gettin' no better and it will get worse
Understanding life today - maybe death ain't no curse

It's a rat race and you're in the trap
You're a Lifer, yeah what can you say?
