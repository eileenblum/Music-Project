Wake up from your sleep
It's your soul you want to keep

The story's the same, and you're to blame
I'm sick of hearin' about your games
Your lyin' and your cheatin'
Your stealin' from your friends
As far as I'm concerned it's never the end

You got to get away
Got to live for better days
Make your bed in the clouds above
Or take a walk out in the sun

You think you're flyin' high
You think you got it straight
I can see it in your eyes
You ain't doin' so great
Your lyin' and your cheatin'
Your stealin' from your friends
As far as I'm concerned it's never the end
