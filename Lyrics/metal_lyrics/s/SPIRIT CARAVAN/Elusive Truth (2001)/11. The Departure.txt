His departure on a raft of snakes
Embodiment of earthly mistakes
Visitors, they cannot feel
Inquisitors must know that they're real
From the lake a stranger rose
Bearded, fair with priestly robes

He taught about living
To trust and be kind
Life blood not given
Just flowers and wine

Iridescent plumes of light
All behold the seed of life

Still his wisdom they did spurn
Hail Morning star his light returns

May your gaze be filled with beauty
May your words be strong and true
May you understand your duty
For living is a gift of love for you

All extol the priest of light
All extol the feast of life
