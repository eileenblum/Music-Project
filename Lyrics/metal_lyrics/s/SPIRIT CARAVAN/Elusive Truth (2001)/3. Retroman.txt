Sideburn sporting, riding a Norton
Stone cold leader if you ever seen one
Smokin' weed since the day he was born
Demon seed, screamin' piss poor

Pentagram tatoo on his arm
Got holes on his face where they don't belong
Snortin' white, singing his song
He's one step farther than you've ever gone!

Can't bring him down if you think you can
Got the power of the ace in hand
He's the one gonna rule the land
That's right, Retroman

Bell-bottom rockin' wicked sound
So fuckin' high never touch the ground
Kind of the lizard can't be beat
One of a kind super freak

Can't bring him down if you think you can
Got the power of the world in hand
He's the one taken over your land
That's right, Retroman.
