On a steamy breeze amongst emarald trees
She stared into a crystal pool of water
Carved in the cliffs were petroglyphs
That told the story of the mystic jaguar flower

Black Flower

Like the waters divined so the priestess must find
A cure for the woes of her stone city
Seeks the flower so fine, its tendrils entwined
It's the psychedelic child of a jaguar father

Black Flower

Black petals like night with a face of blue light
Her essence holds the timeless answers
Frozen as the petals fall there, the Priestess lays bare
And she tastes the petal's power coming over

Black Flower
