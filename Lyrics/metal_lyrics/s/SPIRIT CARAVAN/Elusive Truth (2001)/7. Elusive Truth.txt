Fly on angel, fly through hatred's veil
Fly on, fly on, lofty heights prevail
Stride on warrior, still your path's in shadow
Stride on, stride on, find the golden meadow

Glide on true bloodwing, your noble course is set
Glide on, glide on, until your cause is met
Press on pilgrim, until your feet they bleed
Press on, press on, find the truth you seek!

Sail on skyship, silver beam of meaning
Sail on, Sail on, the spark of life is gleaming
Fly on seeker, into the dawn so pure
Fly on, fly on, with hope your trial's endured!
