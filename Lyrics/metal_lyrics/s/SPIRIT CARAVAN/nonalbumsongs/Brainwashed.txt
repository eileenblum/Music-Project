[2003 "The Last Embrace" compilation]

Iâll take your evil wind and give it right back to ya
Hungry buzzards are waiting on the grey fence of ignorance
Itâs a classic case, they obfuscate, a brainwashed populace
Screaming crows and sirens, a normal world is crying
Bright bird of redemption, winged truth, with eyes of fire
One more fool, divide and rule, a brainwashed populace
You dance around the question, because the answers, you must hide
You crept into the dimension, now be lost through all time
Itâs a classic case, they obfuscate, a brainwashed populace
