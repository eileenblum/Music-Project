[2003 "The Last Embrace" compilation]

The cardinal at the window bravely seeking home
Yearning, wings are beating tiny heart alone
Aching for the reasons, earthbound heart and soul
Yearning is unanswered, learning life grows old
Truth is like a shadow, shadows growing long
The cause it stems from knowing the cause is growing strong
Aching for the reasons a willing struggle sworn
Choices made of living, voices heed unborn
