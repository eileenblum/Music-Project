[2003 "The Last Embrace" compilation]

The words are counted, not weighed
I don't believe what you say
The face, a fountainhead that spews out lies
He got no ears to your cries

Don't build yourself a prison, baby
You will become a prism today
Hey today

The web of greed, it stretches far
They even think they own the stars
You pay to live, to live you toil
But will they feed their children oil?

Don't build yourself a prison, baby
You will become a prism today

Children of Light, they know the score
The newborn child knows not war
The tongue, it flutters soft and it's no surprise
They got no ears to hear our cries

Don't build yourself a prison, baby
You will become a prism today
Just do what you want to, hey hey
They're building us all prisons today
