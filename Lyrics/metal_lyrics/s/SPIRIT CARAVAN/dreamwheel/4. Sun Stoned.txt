The Sun that lights the way
Across the vast oceans and plains

The serpent's eyes have seen many days
And he tells us not to fear
I wake in the morning with thoughts of your face
Shining through my eyes
Like days of love and light rain down

Turning to embrace the Sun that guides the way
Across the vast oceans and plains
You take me higher when I see your smile
I wake in the morning with thoughts of your face
Shining through my eyes
