We only come to dream
We only come to sleep
It is not true, it is not true
That we come to live on Earth

Where are we to go from here?
We came here only to be born
As our home is beyond
Where the fleshless abide

Perchance does anyone really live on Earth?

The Earth is not forever
But just to remain for a short while
It is not true, it is not true
That we come to live on Earth

Where are we to go from here?
We came here only to be born
As our home is beyond
Where the fleshless abide

Perchance does anyone really live on Earth?

You got to dream &amp; keep on rollin' [2x]
