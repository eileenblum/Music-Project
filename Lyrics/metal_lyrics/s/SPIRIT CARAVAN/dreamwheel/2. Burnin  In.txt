There was a sign around for many years
It's universal power was revered
Then they twisted it around
And all the goodness was bound
Now it's a symbol of suffering, death and fear

With their crosses they came into the land
Claiming divine authority over man
They burned all the books
And their culture they took
Now the blood of the children's on their hands

It's sad the way the future looks today
The old and the young held in it's sway
A fanatical whim some call it a sin
It will come back upon them anyway

It's lies they're tellin'
Yes indeed
It's death they're sellin'
To feed their greed
To believe in something the just will win
The light of reason comes burnin' in

It's lies they're tellin'
Yes indeed
It's death you're smellin'
To feed their greed
To believe in something the just will win
With light of reason comes burnin' in
