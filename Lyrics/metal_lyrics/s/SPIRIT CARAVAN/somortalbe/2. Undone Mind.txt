Crawling on the floor for what you desire
On your knees into the fire
Oh no, can't stand the pain
Turning your brain schizophrene

The faster you get the further you fall
Can't see anything anything at all
Oh no, going down kamikaze flight
Hit the ground... hit it

Undone mind, killing time
Undone mind, watch your life shoe the sign
Undone mind, it's the last time
Undone mind, it'll leave you behind

Descending angels feel the fear
Know the end is not near
Oh no, can't stand the pain
Turning your brain insane
