The place left behind, haunting dreams
Day and night today, far away

Have strength upon the life you lead
These mortal chains broken free
So breathe, and succeed

Anxious memories disturb
Fleeting heights a life absurd
Euphoric fantasies extol, weary darkness on the soul

Upon the needle you were bred
poisoning the life you led you bleed

Oh like dead
The sorrow there you cannot change
Driven by a soul deranged in flames
Oh in vein

All these deeds the brain records
Twisted creed of shame's rewards
Thankful vision clears the way
I'll love you past my dying day
