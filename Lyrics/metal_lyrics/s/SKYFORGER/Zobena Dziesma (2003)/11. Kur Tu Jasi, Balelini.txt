Kur tu jasi, balelini
Vakara kajas auni?
Ej masina, nevaica
Atnes manu cepuriti
Kur tu jasi, balelini
Es atnesu cepuriti
Ej masina, nevaica
Atnes manu zobentinu
Kur tu jasi, balelini
Es atnesu zobentinu
Ej, masina, nevaica
Sedlo manu kumelinu
Kur tu jasi, balelini
Es sedloju kumelinu
Jasu talu svesuma
Sargat savu tevu zemi
Skir, Dievini, manu celu
Sarga manu auguminu
Lai godam es varetu
Ienaidnieku uzvareti

[English translation:]

Where You'll Ride, Brother?

Where are you riding to brother
This eve, putting on your boots?

Go sister, don't ask.
Bring me my helmet.

Where are you riding to brother?
I have brought your helmet.

Go sister, don't ask.
Bring me my sword.

Where are you riding to brother?
I have brought your sword.

Go sister, don't ask.
Saddle my horse.

Where are you riding to brother?
I have saddled your horse.

I must ride in a strange land.
To defend the soil of my forefathers.

Dievini, divide my path.
Protect my body.

The honour, I will deserve.
I will crush my foes.
