[M: Dilian Arnaudov; L: Dilian Arnaudov]

Stand on the shore of magic lake
Stand on the shore like in an endless dream
The lake is wrapped in mystery
Covered with grief reflected face I see

[Chorus:]
I see the tears drop in water
I see the wounds that left in me
I see the tears drop in water
I see the wounds that left in me

Stand on the shore of magic lake
Stand on the shore like in an endless dream
Darkness descended upon the Earth
I feel my heart turns into stone cold

[Chorus:]
I see the tears drop in water
I see the wounds that left in me
I see the tears drop in water
I see the wounds that left in me

[Bridge:]
Magic lake of my dreams
Inspire sadness in my soul
Magic lake of my dreams
Inspire sadness in my soul

[Chorus:]
I see the tears drop in water
I see the wounds that left in me
I see the tears drop in water
I see the wounds that left in me
