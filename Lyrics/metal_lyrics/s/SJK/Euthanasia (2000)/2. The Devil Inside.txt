[M: Dilian Arnaudov; L: Dilian Arnaudov]

When sometime your days are over
And you go the way of all the earth
On the deathbed don't close your eyes
Look at me before you die

[Chorus:]
Dark reflections like birds of pray
Suddenly rushed into your mind
Don't forget remember my name
I am the devil, devil inside

When sometime your days are over
And you meet Death face to face
I will stop it: Wait for a while!
Let you see me before you die

[Chorus:]
Dark reflections like birds of pray
Suddenly rushed into your mind
Don't forget remember my name
I am the devil, devil inside
