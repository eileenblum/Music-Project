[M: Dilian Arnaudov; L: Dilian Arnaudov]

How many graves I see on my way
How many graves, old and new
I sway like blown by a wind
I hear cries, wails and laughs

[Chorus:]
I hear the call, eternal call
I hear the call, voice of Earth
I feel the pain, eternal pain
I feel the pain, pain of Earth

The world is buried, destroyed itself
Vomiting poisons, vomiting stench
People remain with roots in Earth
Deep in a heart, heart of World

[Chorus:]
I hear the call, eternal call
I hear the call, voice of Earth
I feel the pain, eternal pain
I feel the pain, pain of Earth
