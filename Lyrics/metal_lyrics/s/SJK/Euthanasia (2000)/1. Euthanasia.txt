[M: Dilian Arnaudov; L: Dilian Arnaudov]

Another way, another life
You haven't got
Take a chance while the goin' is good
And turn the tide

Save your mind, save your soul
You must be hard
Do what one can, let the strength of will
Help you to survive

[Chorus:]
Last chance you haven't got

That sick world gave you pain
When you were born
Drive to the wall you have no choice
Let it be done

Save your mind, save your soul
You must be hard
Do what one can, let the strength of will
Help you to survive

[Chorus:]
Last chance you haven't got
