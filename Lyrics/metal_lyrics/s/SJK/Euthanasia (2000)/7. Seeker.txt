[M: Dilian Arnaudov; L: Dilian Arnaudov]

You ride the winds of time
Symbol of freedom
You own the power
And the will to fight

You've past the long way
Through the darkness
That left in your soul
Ruins of memories

[Chorus:]
Hear the call of infinity
Hear the call that leads in your way
Make a long arm for the sky
And you'll touch the stars

But lost in the night
The Dark will wrap
The ray, ray of light
In your eyes

Therefore you must fly
On the wings of wind
Collect in your heart
The first for life

[Chorus:]
Hear the call of infinity
Hear the call that leads in your way
Make a long arm for the sky
And you'll touch the stars
