[M: Dilian Arnaudov; L: Dilian Arnaudov]

We hang on the gallows
You can see, can't you?
One and all drawn and quartered
Nothing left of us

[Chorus:]
Dust to dust, rest in peace
Bones in ash will be destroyed
You have no right, right to laugh
Pray for our souls

Swelter burns the corpses
Blizzard turns in ice
Doomed by Living Death
Nothing left of us

[Chorus:]
Dust to dust, rest in peace
Bones in ash will be destroyed
You have no right, right to laugh
Pray for our souls

[Bridge:]
You who were born after us
Don't blame with evil words
If you have done good to us
God will take pity on you

God rest our souls
Man can die but once
You know God from Evil
We have been convicted

[Chorus:]
Dust to dust, rest in peace
Bones in ash will be destroyed
You have no right, right to laugh
Pray for our souls
