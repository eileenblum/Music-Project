[M: Dilian Arnaudov; L: Tinko Georgiev &amp; Dilian Arnaudov]

People are talking about moral and ethics
They always have compassion on us
They teach us how to speak and how to smile
My parents told me: "Don't tell a lie!"

My life is battle, endless and cruel
My pride is stifled all the time
Do what you want and no one you bow
Just know the words: "The moment is now"

[Chorus:]
All jesters' tears I've cried for my fears
My heart become as cold as a stone
My Ego dies in silent cries
My mind burns inside

I hear the bell begins to chime
I'll take in my life another prime
I will depend on me, now I am free!
Rushing ahead to fight it out

[Chorus:]
All jesters' tears I've cried for my fears
My heart become as cold as a stone
My Ego dies in silent cries
My mind burns inside

My life was battle, endless and cruel
My pride was stifled all the time
I did what I wanted and no one I bowed
I knew the words: "The moment is now"

[Chorus:]
No jester's tears I loose all my fears
My heart become as strong as my songs
My ego stands to conquer new lands
My mind flies me higher
