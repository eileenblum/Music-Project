[M: Dilian Arnaudov; L: Tinko Georgiev &amp; Dilian Arnaudov]

In the dead of night
I stand â alone
On a long road without end
I forgot my past
I don't know who I am
'Cause I lost my dreams again

[Bridge:]
Long time ago I was looking for the way
To land where I can live my days
All my life I tried to find the key
To my own reality

I touched the loneliness
It came to me again
I can feel it deep inside
But, soon I'll realize
It's virtual mystery
Prototype of mindless brain

[Bridge:]
How could I make, make it through the time?
But, I was living for today
Eternity surrounds me now
All the way across the space

[Chorus:]
Far back in past, in the time of leaving
Deep in black hole, time plays no role
I don't wanna go, but I have no choice
I know somewhere, someone will hear my voice

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna go, but I have no choice
I know someone, somewhere will hear my voice
I don't wanna go, but I have no choice
I know someone, somewhere will hear my voice
