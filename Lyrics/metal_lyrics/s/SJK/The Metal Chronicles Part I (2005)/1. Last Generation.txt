[M: Dilian Arnaudov; L: Tinko Georgiev &amp; Dilian Arnaudov]

Scientists are Masters who control your life
They use technologies to rule over mind
Brain experiments - victims feel no pain
We know it happens again and again

[Chorus:]
We're the last generation
We're the last in time
We're the last generation
We're the last in time

For a long time we're looking for the sign
The sign left for us as a thin bloody line
Forgotten memories from age after age
Are left for us as a white, blank page

[Chorus:]
We're the last generation
We're the last in time
We're the last generation
We're the last in time
