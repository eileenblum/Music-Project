[M: Dilian Arnaudov; L: Julian Iliev]

Once a woman's touch
Made him hold the grudge
The games of a whore
The portents of war
Blind he'll fight his friend
While a friendship ends
On madness verge
Sing sanity's dirge

[Chorus:]
Evil ways - over path that you thread
Venom grace - she's the snake in your bed

With a dark surmise
All to his surprise
When he felt a prick
He knew he was tricked
Thus she made him spurt
Spattered him with dirt
The thirst of a leech
Wrapped inside her speech

[Chorus:]
Evil ways - over path that you thread
Venom grace - she's the snake in your bed

Those who seized no fear
She did gnaw with sneer
Fools writhe to the scourge
Faith she shall encourge
She would never truce
Threw 'em deftly bruised
It's like a bilious spit
Night into the slit

[Chorus:]
Evil ways - over path that you thread
Venom grace - she's the snake in your bed
