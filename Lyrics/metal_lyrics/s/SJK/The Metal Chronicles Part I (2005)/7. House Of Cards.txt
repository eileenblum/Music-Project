[M: Dilian Arnaudov; L: Julian Iliev &amp; Dilian Arnaudov]

I see the tears in his eyes
A young man is crying unveiling the lies
Please... don't let him leave
Out of the world we live

Memories are coming from the past
It's all and nothing He got at last
No way to loose - too many to fall
Surviving to save his soul

[Chorus:]
Subconscious anger now turns to pain divine
Living in a house of cards
Well, there's no way back it's all mistakes of time
Welcome to the house of cards

He found the way that he walks
A dream brought to dying a murder of hope
No... Don't let him bend
Wings that will always mend

The light... will warm up his heart
A new road's beginning unfolds in his palm
Lord... bring back the smile
Just for a little while

[Chorus:]
Subconscious anger now turns to pain divine
Living in a house of cards
Well, there's no way back it's all mistakes of time
Welcome to the house of cards

Memories are coming from the past
It's all and nothing He got at last
Please... don't let him leave
Out of the world we live

The light... will warm up his heart
A new road's beginning unfolds in his palm
No... Don't let him bend
Wings that will always mend

[Chorus:]
Subconscious anger now turns to pain divine
Living in a house of cards
Well, there's no way back it's all mistakes of time
Welcome to the house of cards
