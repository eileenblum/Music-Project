[M: Dilian Arnaudov; L: Tinko Georgiev]

With a light I will guide through the fight
Follow me over the field
Enemy's anxious, scared for your long waited turn

Beloved Goddess remember that
I doth bestow you myself
Bless my soul and wade with me through mortal remains

The morning after, the misty shadows
The taste of madness bittersweet
Hills clad with dullness, sodden gory clay
Crimson daybreak slowly comes

[Bridge:]
Here where past meets today
All my deeds will claim on tomorrow
I stand on my own
'Cause my body is shielded by gods

[Chorus:]
Forever and ever,
As shades of doom drew on
In silence they whisper:
âThe Blade of One will rise!â
Eternal, immortal
The glory lies ahead
Go take it! Remember!
Your name's the Blade that lasts

I fight with rattle across this world of men
For blood I lust now furious
Oh, Goddess, sublime, witness my triumph
Promised destiny soon will come

[Bridge:]
See death follows me
And no man will live till tomorrow
I stand for the world
âCause my life is ruled by the gods

[Chorus:]
Forever and ever,
As shades of doom drew on
In silence they whisper:
âThe Blade of One will rise!â
Eternal, immortal
The glory lies ahead
Go take it! Remember!
Your name's the Blade that lasts
