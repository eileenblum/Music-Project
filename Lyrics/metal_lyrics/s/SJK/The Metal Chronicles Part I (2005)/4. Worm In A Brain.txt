[M: Dilian Arnaudov; L: Tinko Georgiev &amp; Dilian Arnaudov]

The power we possess will help us pass the test
We wont be like fools living under rules
We were part of machine life passed without dream
Just like marionettes we'll never forget

[Bridge:]
We feel something inside
It's creeping in our minds
We know it isn't strange
This is worm in a brain

[Chorus:]
Worm, worm in a brain

We're running through the time to make up our minds
With revenge as our guide hope's only ray of light
We're getting very close to fight we wisely chose
Providence points the way the way to the final day

[Bridge:]
We feel something inside
It's creeping in our minds
We know it isn't strange
This is worm in a brain

[Chorus:]
Worm, worm in a brain
