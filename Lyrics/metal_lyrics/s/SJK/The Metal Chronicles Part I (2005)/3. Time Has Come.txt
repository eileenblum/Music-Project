[M: Dilian Arnaudov; L: Julian Iliev &amp; Dilian Arnaudov]

Shades are all around
Floating with no sound
To the end of blue
Where nothing was true

Had to kill the day
Light would bind the way
To the crystal dream
And onto its stream

[Chorus:]
Sailing on - on like a ship in the sea
Carry on - carry the gift of my sleep
Set me free - free from the truth never seen
Through the storm - living in unreal dream
Flying high - where the wind's free to blow
Move along - beyond the shades spirits flow
Follow on â searching the unseen trace
Eternity - surrounds me across the space

Life I found inside
Caught it in my sight
So, here I awake
Where all is so fake

Set my visions free
Let creation be
First, second and last
Forms spinning so fast

[Chorus:]
Sailing on - on like a ship in the sea
Carry on - carry the gift of my sleep
Set me free - free from the truth never seen
Through the storm - living in unreal dream
Flying high - where the wind's free to blow
Move along - beyond the shades spirits flow
Follow on â searching the unseen trace
Eternity - surrounds me across the space

Now the world is calm
Faith is in my palm
Through the lifting smoke
Light I did evoke

On a distant shore
Stood a man he wore
The masque of my past
No shadow he cast

[Chorus:]
Sailing on - on like a ship in the sea
Carry on - carry the gift of my sleep
Set me free - free from the truth never seen
Through the storm - living in unreal dream
Flying high - where the wind's free to blow
Move along - beyond the shades spirits flow
Follow on â searching the unseen trace
Eternity - surrounds me across the space
