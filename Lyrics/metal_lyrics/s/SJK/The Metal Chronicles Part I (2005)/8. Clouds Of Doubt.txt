[M: Dilian Arnaudov; L: Tinko Georgiev &amp; Dilian Arnaudov]

You're living in darkness moonlight surrounds you
Walking alone in the night there's no turning back
Life of a drifter, leaving your home
You tried to remember, but no way to return

[Bridge:]
Doesn't matter where you are
Your mind is always far
The chance you've got before
Will come again once more

[Chorus:]
There's a fight in your head
There's a fire in your heart
There's a wind in your sails
There's a wall in front of you

Now, you're looking around and no one is there
People you've ever known are still beyond the wall
Time will make up your mind through the clouds of your doubt
You will see whole your life passed into Eternity

[Bridge:]
Doesn't matter where you are
Your mind is always far
The chance you've got before
Will come again once more

[Chorus:]
There's a fight in your head
There's a fire in your heart
There's a wind in your sails
There's a wall in front of you
