Who's to Judge
Onto Me
Thoughts In My Head
Slowly Become Me
Sadistic Is What I Am

Four Times The Hate
Five Times The Pain
Nothing To Lose
Nothing To Gain
Swallowed Whole For
The Good Of All Man
Oh God!

I Don't Understand

The Seedless End
Immortal Sin
I Will Defend
The Struggle Within
Transparent Souls
Live In My Head

The Final Straw
The Final Lie
Temptation Rules
Temptation Dies
A Pawn In Life
Is Just What I Am
But This Time...

I Understand!
