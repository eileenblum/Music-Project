Slipped Up
Fortified with Defeat
Turn It Up
Wallowing In Deceit
Exhibitionist Won't You Look
Won't You Look At Me
Anonymous
No I Can't Be Seen!

Acid In The Fields
Won't You Get Them All
Will I Stand Or Will I Fall
A Slight Of Hand A Twist Of Fate
Your Are Not The Only One
I'll Ever Hate!

Head Trip
Get The Hell Out Of My Face
No More
Can't Take You In My Face
Under Mindedness
Are The Terms In Which You State Your Case
Once More
Lost Before I Start The Race!
