She Walked Out
And Looked Up To The Sky
I Woke Up
I Had A Needle In My eye
Time Flys By
The Sacrificial Lamb
Oh Holy Man
I Caught On To Your Scam

I'm Coming To Get You

Come Right In
Please Pull Up A Chair
Blood Upon, Upon, Upon My Face
Blood Upon, Upon, Upon, My Hands
Blood Upon, Upon, Upon My Fists
Punch You In The Face!

I'm Coming To Get You
