I'm Searching For My Soul
In An Endless Hole
Called Misery
And The Pain You Feel
Is Not Unreal
In The Face Of Immortality

I Walk The Line
To The End Of The Road
A Meaningless Identity
Cause When Two Worlds Meet
And You Cry Defeat
It All Means Nothing To Me

Do It Right!
Sacrifice!
I won't come home
Until I Get It Right

In A Trance
Tribal Dance
I won't Come Home
Until I Get My Chance

Do It Right!
Sacrifice!
I won't come home
Until I Get It Right
