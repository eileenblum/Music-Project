I Got You Well Within My Sites
But I Can't Decide Your Fate
Ya Scream, Ya Shout, and Kick About
Then You Cry rape

I Want It, I Need It, I Can't Control It Now
I Want It, Ya Need It, I'm Gonna Show You How

I Feel The Steel Within My Chest
And Ask The Question Why
All You Can Do Is Wonder Who
And Slowly Watch Me Die

Watch The Tables Turn
When Am I Gonna Learn
Watch The Tables Turn
Man Am I Gonna Burn?
