Sacrifice, Suicide
I Am The Young Boys Child
Sanctified, You've Denied
You Were Once The Unborn
You Were Once The Young Boy

No Time For Suffering
Cry All You Want Cause I
Feel No Pain
No Time For Suffering
Feel The World Coma
Pouring Rain

Feel It Coming
Feel It Coming Down
Feel It Coming
Feel Phlegmatic Sun

I've Defied, All Your Lies
And Made You Look Like A Child
Crucified, I Won't Die
You Were Once The Unborn
You Were Once The Young Boy

I Feel No Suffering
A Dark Pit Swells
Inside My Soul
I Feel No Suffering
The Final Page In
An Open Book
