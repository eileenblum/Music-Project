It's Hectic, It's Frenzy, The Blood Shot In His Eyes
Something In The Way He Moved Led To His Demise
Absorbing, Distorting, Your Face I Can Not See
Come With Me To Heaven's End So I Can Plant The Seed

Clearly I'm The One Who'll Make You See The Way
Empty Pockets Full Of Ashes Will Not Pay

Redempting, Pre-empting, Think Hard Is What I'll Do
This Game In Which I Did Not Start, I'm Coming After You
Detesting, Arresting, The Final Move I'll Make
Got You Underneath My Thumb You Obtuse Little Fake

Stay With Me Forever, I Can't Take No More
Watch You Lying There While I Walk Out The Door!

Hate!

Redempting, Pre-empting, Think Hard Is What I'll Do
This Game In Which I Did Not Start, I'm Coming After You
Detesting, Arresting, The Final Move I'll Make
Got You Underneath My Thumb You Obtuse Little Fake

Clearly I'm The One Who'll Make You See The Way
Empty Pockets Full Of Ashes Will Not Pay

Eruption, Abduction, The Climax That I'll Reach
When I Put You In Your Place, You're Nothing But A Leech
Expected Suspected, The Finger Points My Way
Information Overload, I Best Watch What I Say

Stay With Me Forever, I Can't Take No More
Watch You Lying There While I Walk Out The Door!

Hate!
