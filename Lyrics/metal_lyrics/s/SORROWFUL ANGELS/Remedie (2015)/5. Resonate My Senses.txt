Drench my soul 
From the waters of your life 
Feel the cold 
As the winter is calling 

Frail intentions broken to pieces 
Sorry endeavours rest inane 
Frozen dreams collapse 
and quell the pain 

Thrown into this bitter rain 
Wretched all your fears I see 
Grey life into the fray 
Eternal futile battles 

Finding ways to relent 
That words cannot conceal 
Ceaseless fake lament 
An ongoing hypocrisy 

Futile pledges 
Never to betray 
Fragile words 
Vanquish the burden from within 
A suffocating cross 
Resonates and triggers senses to be 

Thrown into this bitter rain 
Wretched all your fears I see 
Grey life into the fray 
Eternal futile battles 

Finding ways to relent 
that words cannot conceal 
ceaseless fake lament 
an ongoing hypocrisy 

Feel the cold 
Thrown into this bitter rain
