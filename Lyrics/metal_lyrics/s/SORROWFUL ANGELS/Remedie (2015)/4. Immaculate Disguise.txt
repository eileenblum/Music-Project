Lost cross comes evading pain 
Lost cross coming through your way 

Far away 
Deceit 
Awaits on a dead-end street 

Entangled in this web of deception 
Lies the sweet darkness of your words 

Close my eyes 
I refuse to follow 
Make me blind 
For these demons 
feel no urge to hide 

a paling feeling of desire 
no intent to go into the pyre 

Deep inside 
I know 
I Decide 
How it ends this time 

In the dark recesses of your mind I invade 
The serpent in your eyes calls me 

The serpent in your eyes calls me 
Immaculate disguise 

Close my eyes 
I refuse to follow 
Make me blind 
mark these words i say 

Lost souls will go against the grain 
by summoning the rain 
To end the omnipotent fire 
End all desire
