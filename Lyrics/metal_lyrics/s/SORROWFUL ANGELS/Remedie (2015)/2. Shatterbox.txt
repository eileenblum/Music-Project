In tidal form appears
Uninvited
A seared wave of fears
Resignate

Greets the sky
A chemical goodbye
Bereaved ân wrecked you abide
Devoid of life

A trembling fear
This seclusion brings
So insincere
Inner voice that speaks

Worlds the twain shared
Penetrates thy shell
Disparaging lies âbeen bled
Mirrorâs edge

Greets the sky
A chemical goodbye
Depraving wretched life
Webbed with strife

A trembling fear
This seclusion brings
So insincere
Inner voice that speaks

Crumbling remain
Dire memory
Lift your frayed veil
Of apathy

A trembling fear
This seclusion brings
So insincere
Inner voice that speaks
