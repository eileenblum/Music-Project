Censured into inescapable fate 
Behold the righteous greet the years as they burn 

Clinging upon the starless night 
Blind I was but now I can see the light 

Frail is my strength though crushing my mind 
The hour of collapse, a sullen intent confined 

Fearless again I throw myself 
into the Abyss that lurks inside my head 
[Refrain ]
Learning's crown, thrown away 
Yearn the fount of unending flame 

Tear Life's Wisdom Page 
Filled with rage 

Don't find yourself astray 
at the close of day. 

Do not go gentle into that good night, 
Old age should burn and rave at close of day; 
Rage, rage against the dying of the light. 
[Dylan Thomas] 

Learning's crown, thrown away 
Yearn the fount of unending flame 

Tear Life's Wisdom Page 
Filled with rage 

Don't find yourself astray 
at the close of day.
