Cynical and vile 
Is it justice or just a foolish pride? 

The dimming of feelings feels so distant 
I lead the sorrow away far away 

In the glimpse of the morning light. 
I'm ready to die 

Where is 
The peace 
Inside? 
The winter reigns 
This heart 
Of black 
No remorse for our 
Our past 
You cast 
Your eyes upon 
These crimes 
I am part no more 

Lurking and waiting for souls that took part in my past 
Redeemed by the demons parading before my eyes 

Frayed is my soul I speak yet nothing I feel 
In need of a frame to give moral for my deeds 

Quit of your sorrow and let now this soul to be with me 
Free me and let me redeem from this outlaws within 

Tonight is the night when all things must be said and done 
So I come inside when tomorrow is here I'll be gone 

Foolish pride
