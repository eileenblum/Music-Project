Misty mornings 
of a coward sun 

Dreadful visage 
Fear infests 
calls the enemy inside 

I know, I try, I fight 
Remedyâs Deception 
Confront, defy with fright 
your seeds of impurity 

Fighting the supremacy of light 
Hide from the deception of the night 

Fear brings your image 
Lay my ghosts to rest 
this enemy that stains my soul 

I know, I try, I fight 
Remedie's Deception 
Confront, defy with fright 
Cleansing Impurity 

Feel the strings 
that pull you under 
Innate urge to merge 
Conflate 

I feel weary 
I feel Iâm losing 
Hear this eerie call 
From far away 

I know, I try, I fight 
Remedie's Deception 
It grips, it stains my mind 
Fade into obscurity
