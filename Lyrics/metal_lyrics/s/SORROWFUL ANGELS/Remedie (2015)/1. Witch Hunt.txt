Suspicious whispers outside (of) your door 
As prowling mob berates and caws seeking justice 

Lethargic minds abounding scorn 
Lest they infect 
Vain fanes of fools that they adorn 
Crave for 

Witch 
Hunt [2x] 

A sorry promise of tomorrow's unforeseen 
Like a fading shadow of a dream it may seem 
Revive a frozen glimpse in time so dire 
Devoured by embers fire 

Infidel's crown demands the spiteful deadly horde 
Hauled and tied to a pole of misconception 

A breath is spared if you evade 
The price to pay 
Mutate your trail for a warring way 
Their righteous way 

A sorry promise of tomorrow's unforeseen 
Like a fading shadow of a dream it may seem 
Revive a frozen glimpse in time so dire 
Devoured by embers fire 

In the fire 
Precious fire 
In the fire 
We throw and rip out 

Seeds of progress of the intrepid few 
Bickering like rodents for the truth they skew 
Fire is the sun and its flames a thorn 
Arrows in the hands of human scorn 

A sorry promise of tomorrow's unforeseen 
Like a fading shadow of a dream it may seem 
Revive a frozen glimpse in time so dire 
Devoured by embers fire
