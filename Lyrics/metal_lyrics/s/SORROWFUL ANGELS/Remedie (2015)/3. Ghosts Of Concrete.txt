Virus,crawling through your skin 
Replicating sin 
And breeds within 

Sirens, survivals of the storm 
Desert the oceanâs core 
And croon their song 

And here now I am 
A broken piece of man 
Of no desire 

My home is a dead land 
A barren aftermath 
Of stone and crow 

We are a hollow conclave 
Depraved by our own need 
Confined in walls of concrete 
Ghosts of our own creed 

Kneel before thine weathered shrine 
Handful of dust is mine 
Forlorn empire 

Prisoners of our own will 
writhed in cages still 
A trophies kill 

Gray times of wither 
To serve no more 
Entrapped in endless motion 
Break down the wall 

We are a hollow conclave 
Depraved by our own need 
Confined in walls of concrete 
Ghosts of our own creed 

Prisoners of our own will 
writhed in cages lifeless still 
Our cries trail back to misery 
Come clean and lift this veil 

Come Crawling 
Come Falling 
Our cries trail back to misery 
Come clean 
Break down the wall
