One more dusk embraces the nocturnal prime 
One more fight to quench my ravenous urge 

My diurnal crime feeds the need to Reconcile 
so I cling on the edge of time 

Wrath 
Loss 
Pain 

Years I've knelt, inside this cell 
Reluctant to rebel 
Overlong I've crooned thine song 
This path feels far too long 

Wrath 
Loss 
Pain 
Hate 
Diligence shall wait 

One more time I feel my mind will burst 
One more try to save my wrecked past 

Drifting below a sea no words can describe 
The exile brought by the plans of time 

The cries 
Like ruptured skies 
Abysmal rift 
A ship adrift 
Sails desperate for the tide 
A Joker's wild 
The holder's cards failed to reveal 

Wrath 
Loss 
Pain 

Hate greed 
Suffering loss 
Wrath pain 
Pray to your God 
Be saved 

The cries 
Like ruptured skies 
Abysmal rift 
A ship adrift 
Sails desperate for the tide 
A Joker's wild 
My fate awaits 

Praise the saviour 
Be my saviour 
Alas ! 
Closed are the gates 
My fate awaits 
Sails desperate for the tide 
A Joker's wild 
The holders Cards failed to reveal 
Wrath 
Loss 
Pain
