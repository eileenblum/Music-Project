[originally by Apoptygma Berzerk]Lost in the depths, the depths of your eyes 
I couldn't resist, why should I? 
I want to relax, I want to feel free 
I want to be you, you want to be me

I look at you; I look at your face 
Reach for my hand, just in case 
Forever with you, you mourn i can see 
Now I am you, do you want to be me? 

Why are you always hiding? 
Why are you always mourning?
