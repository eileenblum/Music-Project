[Music/lyrics â Dion]

Come daughter of sky your fall reached its lower end, time to reset
Dazed and drunken of life, your divine roots you seem to forget
Here in the flaming center of earth your chains remain
Your challenge, the fall, Divinity seems like a dream in vain

[Refrain]
Ride the kingdom, Rise above
Beyond the planes of the seventh sun
Seven spirits that rule them all
The spheres of life beyond this Dome
Rise from ashes, Ride above
Beyond the planes of Pain, Death and Love
Forget the martyr of the earthly pack
Where shivers of lust in flames attack

Lost in whirlwind within and in cyclone's roar
Atrocious spirits fight the eternal war
The end of the line, is eternity's start
Consciousnessâ end is existence's last part
Legions of seven bring us your wisdom
Elevate our souls to your seventh kingdom

[Bridge]
Those who rise up, return to the moon
Attracted by its orbit, enjoying the view of divinity
