[Music/lyrics â Dion]

A mystical momentum on this strange day
Hear the sirens calling I'll be on my way
Here my Father lies splendid killing spree
Mother of my ecstasy, begin

[Bridge]
I see the world blind as the sky explodes
I hear your cries out while your faith corrodes
I watch the sea grows violent, drowning waves
A mystical momentum on this strange day

[Refrain]
I slip away, the light fading
All is cold, the dream is ending
The voice inside my head stops calling
What is real, Iâm lost, Iâm drowning...

A mystical momentum on this awkward day
Inner demons calling I'll be on my way
Here my bloodline lies, on my stream of kills
Mother of all sins, begin!

[Bridge]
Shapeless dark, take my hand
A mournful kingdom, dreams of sand
