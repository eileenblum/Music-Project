[Music/lyrics â Dion]

The time is right in this dark night, seek no reasons to resist
May we hold tight and not forget, thereâs nothing to regret

For all these years of sorrow making our lives seem hollow
Tonight the pain sets free

We struggled so much to hide all this hatred inside
Trying our best not to forget

[Refrain]
Tonight comes our right of way as time takes its toll
Now itâs your time to pay as you slowly lose control

Thereâs so much cold in this heart, now taste the fall
Our knife takes turns, silent deadly end
The past makes amends as we transcend

[Refrain 2]
Tonight comes our right of way as time takes its toll
Now itâs your time to pay casting shadows on this throne
Tonight comes our right of way and we'll mourn until dawn
Around this despised clay, soon you fiend will be gone
