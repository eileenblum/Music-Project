[Music/lyrics â Dion]

Looking inside of you, comes through
A world that's built on chaos, a nous undue
Relieve the pain inside this body
Washed by rain your earthly seal

[Refrain]
Ride the avenue and take one good look
At what you have found in this dark term
Discovered new worlds on your route
Do you feel you have been outworn?

And I pray to your immense might
Who has strength to bend my resistance
And Iâll shine from the light of the night
I can't bear this existence

I pray to the only one whose stains remain
To shroud the dream that burns tonight
I will confess and won't fail you once again
We always craved the night
