[Music/lyrics â Dion]

Paving the way, a newborn day
Drains your soul and cries your name
For so long, Iâve seen you trying to die

[Bridge]
Wait and bleed, these wounds grow deep

[Refrain 1]
We are where dreams exit
We are the wrath of God, keeps burning
Genocide brings unity, we slay forever
We are this earth's degenerates

[Refrain 2]
The Earth is now laid waste
Before our Communion, all perish
So Indignant and rightful, we end forever
The world and all that dwell therein

[Bridge 2]
This is the fall, you go down
Now pay the toll, as you come round
