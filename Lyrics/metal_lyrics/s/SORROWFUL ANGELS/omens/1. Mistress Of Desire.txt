[Music/lyrics â Dion]

Those who gave their souls away
Strayed away with eyes ablaze
Of the fire she offered them today

A tragic kingdom of fallen ones
A saddened glimpse of apocalypse
Donât grab the hand she offers you at once

Those who stayed to fade away
Wonât you hear the cries, their voice of pain?
That she laughs at, in glorious dismay

[Refrain]
Behold! The Mistress of desire
Hold your breath, look up to the sky
The smell of death invites us tonight

Our hearts hold no regrets
The spiral that never ends
This ghastly voice that comes from inside

Those who stayed to fade away
Wonât you hear the cries, their voice of pain?
That she laughs at, in glorious dismay

My penance overdue
Tears me inside, I wish the pain subside
I must let it go, my soul be damned again

[Refrain]
Here Lies, The Mistress of desire
Hold your breath, look up to the sky
The smell of death invites us tonight

Our hearts hold no regrets
The spiral that never ends
Embrace the fear, upon you it confides
