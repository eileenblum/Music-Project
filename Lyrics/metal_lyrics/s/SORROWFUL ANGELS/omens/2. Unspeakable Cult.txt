[Music/lyrics â Dion]

I come in shadows blood, I am unspeakable cult
Destroying your faith, my kingdom reigns
Unleash my Wrath and you world fails

We make the world go round in tears
We are the shadow, when faith disappears
We are anxiety and fearless scum
Awaking your sorrow like the darkest sun


We bring the rapture and ecstasy within
Enshrouded by divinity, we slay among your kin
A tortured Horizon, arises from the East
As human kind is taken by force and brutally, ceased

[Refrain]
We take this world as our Hell
Tempting the struggle to prevail
Deformed from misery and thrown back again
This martyr awaits for me alone
