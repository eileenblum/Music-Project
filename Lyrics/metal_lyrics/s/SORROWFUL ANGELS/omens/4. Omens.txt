[Music/lyrics â Dion]

Is this the end my dearest friend?
Your smile is vicious, a sigh inauspicious
[Bridge]
Detached by a window of glass, I cannot touch
My chance has passed
A dying candle, a cordial smell
Oh dear friend I long your story to tell

[Refrain]
Sight beyond sight, the omens reveal the endless fight
Feeling trapped inside, in a desolate maze we hide
Our future is doomed; we are the hunted, being entombed
The well dries in our hives, a prey for the lord of the flies

This deadly era is a hideous chimaira
Reaping destruction, a chain reaction

[Bridge]
Swallowing gall each every night
Weâre getting used on this deadly bite
This world of doom withstands no more
We're on the realms of the War you adore
