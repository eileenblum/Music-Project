[Music/lyrics â Dion]

Staring the stars again, I crave your eyes,
In the sky, of the deepest blue
Feeling inside this thorn within
I wish i knew to put this through

I do mourn as you're sorrowful
And i will seek your inner thought
Stay by me and you will find out
All the truth inside as stars collide
Stars die

[Refrain]
Staring inside this room i hear
The voices in my head seem now so real
Living the world we're on in fear
I hate to watch the stars collide
The end is near
