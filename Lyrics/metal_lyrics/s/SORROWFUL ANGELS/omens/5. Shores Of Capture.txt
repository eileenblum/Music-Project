[Music/lyrics â Dion]

Desperate inside this cell, these chains my will retain
The thoughts of what I used to be in shade remain

Writing down of my secret wish
Iâm taking off this choking leash
In front of misery I stand, baring the strain
The grass slowly grows back after the rain
Open my eyes, brought back in line
Don't count one's death as a weakness sign

Trying to bare this thorn, my body's wrecked and torn
Fear for the blade that cuts inside, no rules now abide
These shores are despair echoing silent deadly screams
With ravaged limbs and damaged souls, forgotten left to die

[Refrain]
I see the panic in you, feeling alone, itâs alright
Your lonely road comes down to an end, no more to fight
Lost in the depths of your mind, disturbing thoughts
Why should I leave you behind?

[Bridge]
The blood, the steel, the knife, a kill
Alone, like you, tonight, I feel

[Spoken]
Relieve the grief inside
This soul is cleansed by rain and fire tonight
The hope that breeds in through my veins
Seems like the only freedom that still remains
No more steps to walk in this path
My body's wrecked and my soul feels torn apart
A shred of fear for the blade that cuts inside
Ashes of me and clays of a forgotten life
