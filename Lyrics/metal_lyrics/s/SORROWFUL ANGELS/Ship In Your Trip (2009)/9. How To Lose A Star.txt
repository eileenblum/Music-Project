[Music: Dion/Dariusz S., lyrics: Dion/Kostas K.]

Pictures of loss
Pictures of anger

Dark burning candles
Black rising stars
Into my father's
Irrational plans

Inspiration
Called deception

Can you believe it??
That's my lust
Like a star hiding behind a rainbow

To this moment of no hesitation
I'm a son of a higher creation
You're the lord of my darkest temptation
You're the reason of my illumination
