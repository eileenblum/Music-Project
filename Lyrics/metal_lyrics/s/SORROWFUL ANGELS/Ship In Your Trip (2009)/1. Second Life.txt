[Music: Dion/Dariusz S., lyrics: Dion/Kostas K.]

If you touch me, I can't feel
If you force me, to reveal

Find a shelter for your own
All I give is nothing
Not for me cause I'm alone
All I feel is something

I remember all these years
My pain, my cries, my tears
Find a shelter for your own
All I feel is something more

And if you wake me, from my grave
I will send you
I will tell you, something brave

Sold my ways, I've seen the days
Of an everlasting world
