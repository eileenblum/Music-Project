[Music: Dion/Dariusz S., lyrics: Dion/Kostas K.]

It's the struggle time
Itâs my summer time, it seems
Awaits
It's the final time
In a final time who wins
Again

I couldn't say to you

Leave me, leave my summer time
Leave me, leave my piece of mind
In a struggle time
In a final time who wins

I could face your kind
I could turn your vain in me
But my hands are tied
And my soul is damned again

I couldn't say to me

Leave me, leave my summer time
Leave me, leave my piece of mind
In a struggle time
In a final time who wins

Leave me, leave my summer time
Leave me, leave my piece of mind
Now I am alone at night
And before the dawn
My forgotten soul
It sleeps
