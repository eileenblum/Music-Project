[Music: Dion/Dariusz S., lyrics: Dion/Kostas K.]

Itâs not the questions of your mind
Itâs not the truth
The truth is blind

Lead me
To the other side of life
Kill me
Before the dark you tonight

Iâm Home
But Iâm not Alone
Iâm leaving the past
Iâm leaving on my own

Iâm Home
And I donât belong

Before the Sun
Before a Storm
You are so true you are so strong
You pray for me, I write you a song
I wrote for truth, who's never told

Find the treasures of human kind
In me but thereâs nothing good to find
