[Music: Dion/Dariusz S., lyrics: Dion/Kostas K.]

Have you ever seen my face
Have you ever find me a space
Did you ever learn to be the fandom of wisdom

I'm not the ship in your trip
Have you ever fought for a reason
Or you say that's not good season
Is your mind and your soul in a prison for real

Have you ever seen my face
Have you rent a place
To live with your sorrowful mind
And your dreams

Are you dreaming a true life
Look behind you there's a knife
It's the knife which turns my dreams into nightmares.

Look behind you and beware
Look my face and meet me there
Fight me the truth of the things that you told me
And go away tonight
