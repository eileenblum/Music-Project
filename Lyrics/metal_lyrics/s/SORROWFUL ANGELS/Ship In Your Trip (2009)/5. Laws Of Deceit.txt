[Music/lyrics: Dion]

Holds back your desire for love
But let us Race to the stars
In the Garden of Eden thereâs a life for you
And a lie from you makes this vision hold true

Soldiers of sin
We only fight to win
Come and be my twin
Trust on these eyes
Come and take my advice
Share love before sunrise

Betrayal in your eyes
Spits a thousand lies
But in this war we are allies
Is like a lover with a gun
Holds a burden in his hand
Killing love on every dawn

The wind blows cold
And bitter is the world
Inner demons now unfold
How can we compete
As we feel complete
By the laws of deceit

Donât run Away, away from your pain
Cause lies will never explain
Erasing the past Time goes fast
Though remembering so much

There's a love profound
On this forbidden ground
And we shall murder all pleasure's sound
Years of fears
All these broken years
That no one can repair

Come, Shadows of shallow despair
May you fill the broken air
