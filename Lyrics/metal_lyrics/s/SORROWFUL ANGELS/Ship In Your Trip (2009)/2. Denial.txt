Decisions made, rulers of fate
Make the call before itâs too late

Donât deny the reason to fight, hiding behind a lie
Donât pretend thereâs more to end this everlasting cry

Shadows fall, I recall - remnants of this life
Razorblade hysteria - cuts me like a knife
No hate in me, no empathy- I wonât cross the line
Falling darkness, failing me - Falling deeper into me

Decisions made, rulers of fate
Make the call before itâs too late
Shades of darkness come again
Committing future, if not now then when?

We die on and on, thrown into surrounding flames
Itâs all tears - Let it rain
Itâs all fears - Let it bleed
Waiting in vain
