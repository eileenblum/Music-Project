[Music/lyrics: Dion]

Into my steady hands
An empty soul reloads
So give me back those guns
Before this heart explodes

Returning trigger from your hand
Strange feelings flirt myself tonight
Pushing finger cannot stand
I'll turn this morning into night

For this Red Sunrise
I see you elevating to immense heights
For this Red Sunrise
I'll turn this fire into ice
There is no paradise
Only a world full of lies
There lies a nice disguise
And a fake advice
