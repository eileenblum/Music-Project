[Music: Dion/Dariusz S., lyrics: Dion/Kostas K.]

This soul, this rising soul
Living a lie without control
Enough for me but not for all
I drive between the lines of highway

This is my lie, this is my wrong way
I can't afford to pay today
I ruin my life, I choose a long stay
Alone because I fail
And I will fail whatever you say

I am like like winter
I am the ghost you see behind
I am the founder
I am the one who sets the price

And I will find you
And you will join me to my road
Why don't you hear me
"I want your life because I'm cold"

This soul, this dying soul
It's not too young, it seems too cold
Can you scream before the end
I am alive but I pretend

I can't forget
And I can't regret
Can't find a hole
Canât find a place to call my home

This is my lie, this is my birthday
I always steal the things of your pray
This is my lie, this is a long stay
I always celebrate
And I will replace you from the next day
