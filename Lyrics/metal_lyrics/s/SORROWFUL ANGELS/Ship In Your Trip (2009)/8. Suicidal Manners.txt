[Music/lyrics: Dion]

When the Darkness comes again
And time seems to reach the End
Give me something to believe
Show me faith so I can be

When the Darkness falls apart
Like corruptions painted art
Give me shelter or deny
Cause I wait to end my life

I'm going on a trip
Do you want to follow me?
Do you want to share with me
Things I want to see?
Come with me
And when the dark will fall again
You're not allowed to see the end
Maybe I'll pretend

Behind the Truth there lives a lie
Hiding pain inside my mind
Reveal these scars, Iâll find the way
To reach the End to end the Day

I live with agony
Tonight I'll set you free
But now i must return
To my Eternity
