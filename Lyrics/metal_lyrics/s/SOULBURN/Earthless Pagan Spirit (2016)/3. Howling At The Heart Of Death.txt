The lightning that was cast from 
the skies while you slept
Fed the fever that arose from your slumber
A deadthdealing darkness comes crawling
from your skies
Your voice filled with deafening thunder
This might it awakes as it creeps from within
Like millions of insects copulating

At the heart of death is where 
the howling begins
Mankind's to become an abortion
from a worn out crackwhore's womb
Hallucinate on the fumes
Envision the surreal ...All to real

All deflowerer
All consuming
Spectral demon
Nightfilled semen
Spill your deathstars
And drain the light

Transform yourself to the sight of a corpse
Let the withering flesh inspire it's cause
Murder your feelings and kill all regret
Become the god you'd never had

Blind your senses
Drink from the self divine
If you cannot cast your skin you have to die

So deep lay the roots like vomit on bones
Did you really think eartblue
was your colour?
Fuck off with every single moral phrase
That I can no longer withdrawal
Emptiness has got in to me
As it already was and always has been
The only true light that ever touched me
Was the flame of my own depravity
