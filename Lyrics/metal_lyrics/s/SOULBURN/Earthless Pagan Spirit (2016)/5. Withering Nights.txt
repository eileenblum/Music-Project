"The law of time it demands
All flesh to bow and to crumble"

Expanding the downfall in stop motion
Is to destroy the conscious
and free the converse of thought

Now inhale the triumph from
the incense of ashen orchids

From the sunless dawn that has risen
from the vaults of the mind's eye
At the core of a brand new awareness
On the deathbed of morrow's

Here is where I will grow my misfortune
In the density of despair

Upon those 
Who cannot see
Who cannot hear
Who cannot feel
And never will

Let us chant
at the dying heartbeat of children
in their immaculate defeat
And smoke out these pathetic virtues
from the fleshsly void in thee

For these are withering nights
Just like the one from which I was born
For these are withering nights

For these are withering nights
And no one shall escape
For these are withering nights
Leading astray

Let us dissolve in purest of will
into a womb of nothingness
Upon the bridge that was built
between stone and stellar
In dialogue with the godless foreverness

From the sunless dawn
that has risen from the vaults
of the mind's eye
At the core of a brandnew awareness
On the deathbed of morrow's

For these are withering nights
