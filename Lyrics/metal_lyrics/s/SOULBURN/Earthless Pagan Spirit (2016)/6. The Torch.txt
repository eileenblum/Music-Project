Ye' barren soil in ever thirst
My breath sweeps dust
from your plains like a
faith drained from it's temple
A drought that leaves
but fire from a tragic sun
Inhale the fire from it's fertile womb
and immolate
What struggle are you
holding up to?

I am the key!

I am the faith caught in ruins
like you beseeched
Drink my blood as boiling light
Light the torch from the inside,
live and incinerate!
Ground be your idol
With roots that shook the deep

Flaming force of illuminated sin
Set thy fatherless burdens ablaze
No shadow was ever deeper
within the spectre of your soul
No nightmare ever so real within
the fear that makes the glow

Malkuth - Yesod
Hod - Netzach
Tiphereth - Geburah - Chesed
Da'ath - Binah
Chokmah
Kether

Drink it! Inhale it!
Like a burning rabid fever
of all consuming fire
Drink it! - The fire from sin
Inhale it! - The ashes within
Rupture and release in utter devotion

"Shaped through an astral landslide
colossal horns rise from above
An all consuming blackness, bereft
the day from it's nourishing light"

Herehafter wherein we dwell
Oh how I feel your presence now
In this magnetic field of
a death to come, you draw me ever closer
Mountains of flesh abide
under the will of men
Draining rivers of blood sparkle
in utter bliss before the throne of hell
Already there to catch the scorched
feathers from the angels burning
Already there at your lefthand path

Hear these words echo
as the sky cracks with fear:
