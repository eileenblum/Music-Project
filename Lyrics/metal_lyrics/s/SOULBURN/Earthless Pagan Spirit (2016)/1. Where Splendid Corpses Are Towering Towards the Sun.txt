Ravish!
I'll ravish through your world like a god
As the stoning of all
harmony commences
Disrupter! Destructor!
I'll grab the snake by it's tail

This rabid fever,
like churning the fires of hell
I came on slaughterwings,
I cam with death

Hear the snapping of their
skeletons like branches
The path lies paved with broken bones
Their human flesh curls up like
autumn leaves in fire
Their human flesh turns sweet
when left to rot

Kiss of perdition, thy kingdom come
Harvest depravity, thy will be done

(From the depths of my heart, 
going on forever,
In the image of God, it is completed,
Let it be everlasting)

Savage is a heart untouched
Squandering from the cup of hope
Plurge into the craving of the dark
Dance with the fucking beast
and unleash the fire!

Their carnal vessels
lay forgotten in the wind
In utmost submission at the tiding
of their great redeemer

Kiss of perdition, thy kingdom come
Harvest depravity, thy will be done

Whatever comes forth
from the ruins at my departure
Shall thicken the skies
with the smell of death
Grace unheared at the dawn
from a sulpherous horizon
Where splendid corpses are
towering towards the sun

This rabid fever, like churning 
the fire of hell
I came on slaughterwings
