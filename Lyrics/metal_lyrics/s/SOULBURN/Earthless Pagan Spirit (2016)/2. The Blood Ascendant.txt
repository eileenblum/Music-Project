My youth melts as it degrades
Uncomfortable
My spirit lingers
To perish or to proceed?
At the devil's apex
I bestow
To the devil
To the devil
The pact
Uplift me now
At the edge of your sword
No doubt lies buried
No grace hath come

On the edge of the blade
There's only one way to go
Downwards, at both sides
Yet, as one I shall fall

The blood ascendant!

If there is nothing inside of me
I was already there
Before the waking dream
As one, we will become,
The all seeing eye, the thrust of the scythe

The wavering truth, it's cracks they shine
Upon my opened veins they slide
My veins spread out like angelwings
My eyes, the gates to lightless bliss

As one, we will become
the all seeing eye at the thrust of the scythe
On the edge of the blade
There's only one way to go

Downwards, at both sides
Yet, as one I shall fall

The blood ascendant!

Before the waking dream
A faith like dust, it never made me

Look all around from where you are
From the north to the south,
From the west to the eastern relics
When all is unclean,
Only the glutting of swords
can redeem
All rejoicing, the whores at play
The new wine shall not be dissapointing

Before the waking dream
The blood ascendant
