And from the depth a light was seen
A cold infinite star gazing into the mind's eye
In contradiciton with the gods
A grand reflection of spawned
out mystery mirrors me
Arise forever - spirited asunder

A light that springs eternally from shadows
And eternally lay caughtin the 
reflections of mine
Unveil the cemeteries we've lost by this
Narrow life - spirited asunder

And the dead is to be furtile
from it's radiating void
Distill my blood into it's 
mystifying reign
To surpass the end is to
Rise once more - spirited asunder

As we fall from grace
I'll cut the wings of your belief
And drape them around your rotting grave
Left with nothing but the musty vapour of
a death in flight - spiritied asunder

It shall cleanse the meaning
of God's own being
In a triple rupture of the soul
Love, hope and faith lie scattered
upon the altar of doubt, now
shine in redemption - spirited asuner

And in this temple we copulate
on the corpse of our deity
Blessed be the black of
heart for thy seed is night
Impregnating shadows in the cunt of twilight
Forever in lust - spirited asunder

We cannot be denied, nor can we be proved
As we rape the innocence from your vanity
It shall come to thee as you believed it would
Dead forever - spirited asunder

Those who make their gods
become like unto them
And all they that put their trust in them
All so blessed all so pure of heart
As in the bile that errupts
within there body temples
They all shall see God - spiritied asunder

I am the absolute I am without reality
I am without light
Thus the word of worms reveal to me
Bind together - spirited asunder

Now descend into the works of darkness
Those without doubt those without fear
Transform thyself in visions
of flame and thunder
My brethern of the new race
Rise together - spirited asunder

We are angels like nightmares of wonder
Whom scatter the scorched flesh of grace
We shall lift the eyelid from the wordly dream
While our hands choke the throat of harmony
By the devil - spirited asunder

Unveiled in adoraiton
we slip into thy fall
Blessed in thy suffering
and in thy glory
Fall forever - spirited asunder
