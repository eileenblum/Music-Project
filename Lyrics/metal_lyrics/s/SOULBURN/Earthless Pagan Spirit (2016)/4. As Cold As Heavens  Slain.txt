Where are the leading gods
that once stood loyal at the threshold of it all
Grand in absence
Smothered lay their vessels
All draped like molten shrines

I can taste the rot from their profound smiles

Where are the vices of men
That once shook the pedestal of meaning
That once cleansed the dreams of the rightious

Now pour your bewildered blood
On the plains of slaughtered truth
Goddamned be this fucking world

The birth of a new dawn unsung

Blackened rain thicks as tar
suffocates the moisty ground

Fields of the lifeless
From where I stretch an endless gaze
As cold as heavens' slain
As cold as heavens' slain

The death of heaven is a goddess
Her hand reaches from the ghastly deep
A vision of unearthed beauty
Lurks me into endless bliss

In a whirlwind of inverted prayers
No soul is left to keep
Already dead before the wake
No god, no soul, nothing to take
