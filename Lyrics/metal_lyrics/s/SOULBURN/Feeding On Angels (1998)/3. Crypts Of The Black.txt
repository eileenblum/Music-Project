Storming down from the hills
With an infernal speed
Their only aim is to quench their satanic greed
Carried by horses nothing more than carrions
Spreading mayhem and terror,
The wind will carry us

Crypts of the black

At night the crypts of the black are opened wide
From their sulphur graveyard,
They ride into the night
Nothing can stop such primitive
(and blackened) power
Hear the chanting at this hellish hour

Crypts of the black

There you can see them,
Emerging from the mist
Their eyes are glowing,
Fiery and intense
The weapons are rusty (and bloodstained),
Forged in eternal fire
No lives will be spared,
So hide your precious desires

This curse started some centuries ago
The knightly order sealed a bloody pact
Trading their souls for eternal life
A power to have for which many strive
Endless in time, summoning the dead
Empty shells, carried by the night

Their only need is to destroy the human race
As vultures they prey on flesh and blood
No emotions allowed, just a ghastly stare
As they take the lives to satisfy their thirst

Some may wonder if this curse will stop
If the crypts of the black will closed at dark
But the answer is simple
As long as there'll be humans
The black will rise from the crypts, to emerge
And slay until they're all dead
