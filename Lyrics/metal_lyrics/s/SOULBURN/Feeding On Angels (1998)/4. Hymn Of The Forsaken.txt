Ruling with might
Power through blood,
Your flesh is mine
Prevailing the night
Nocturnal domain,
An endless reign

Divine,
The flame of the righteous is alive
Sin,
Just engraved in my mind

As  chaos dies
Ending the tale
Of the good and brave
Silent cries
The ones who failed
Are now enslaved

Divine,
The flame of the righteous is alive
Sin,
Just engraved in my mind

Mysteries
My art is black,
Yet its fuel is red
Cold, but intense
As I speak the words,
Untimely end
Kissing your soul
Blackened rose,
Again so cold
Moonblood flows
Distorted views,
My eyes are black

Hymn of the forsaken
Untold by religion
Hymn of the forsaken
Obscure and forbidden
