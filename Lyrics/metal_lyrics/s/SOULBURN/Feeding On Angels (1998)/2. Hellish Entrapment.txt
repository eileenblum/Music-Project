Gazing through the infernal cloud,
I see a reign of hate
Captured in a satanic spell,
My mind was set ablaze
Demons and devils are shouting out,
Their victory is a fact
God and his warriors of light
Experienced an infernal death

Hellish entrapment
Hellish entrapment

Guardian angel, sky turning red
The cross stands on the hill
The wind howls around the cross
Expel goodness, our will
This place will be remembered
For its evilness and death
Because what I saw in the cloud
Took my breath

This place was deserted for ages and ages
No living creature did care to come here
The cross was witness of silence

Emperors and kings, no one could deny it
That this place where bloodshed took place
Was the battlefield where darkness took over

Here I slaughtered the lambs of christ
And drank the blood of the dead christ
Covered myself in relics so pride
To end the reign of this fucking light

Immortal I stand at the cross
This modern wreck, fate of the lost
I'm wondering if this is the end of his domain
This battle will remain
