Bitter was the delusion of chaos
We, the children of lust and perversity
Proud we stood on the battlefield
And gave our blood for your splendour

With hate in our veins, we charged the foe
Dark and grim we used our weapons
Sliding through flesh, blood spreads swiftly
Their numbers increased with the minute

Under the banner of the pentagram
Its blood-filled, upheaval at night
Through fire and violence
We'll cleanse this world
Drink the blood and join us this night
You will see the angels die
And lift the scourge of light and pride
Feast my friend and enjoy this flight
Flesh and silk, a beautiful sight

Mighty we fought with pure valour
Comrades felt through the slashes of our enemy
Because we were although our ranks decreased
And the end most of were deceased

The battle raged on for an endless time
The sun and moon embrace my pride
I thought and fought,
Attacked and slayed
'Til I was left
No sounds of death
Watching the carnage,
No souls are left
I reached my goal,
Weltering in gold
