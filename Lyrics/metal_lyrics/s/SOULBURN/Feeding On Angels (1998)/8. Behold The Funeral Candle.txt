By rites of a bestial nature
You're searching for your unknown future
Life eternal, fact or vision
Your strive for this ancient wisdom

Behold the funeral candle
Its light showing you your grave
Behold the funeral candle
Accept your fate, die in vain

Believe in forgotten wisdom
To behold the streams of this wisdom
Feel the might of the crimson star
You know the solution cannot be far

Behold the funeral candle
Its light showing you your grave
Behold the funeral candle
Accept your fate, die in vain

Behold the funeral candle
Behold the funeral candle

Behold the funeral candle
Its light showing you your grave
Behold the funeral candle
Accept your fate, die in vain

Flashes of wastelands forgotten
Below the soil, power
What happened in this moment of glory
Your messiah turned himself against you

Lost, you see a flame burning
The candle illuminates your body
See, your life is eternal
Eternally you rot in my inferno

Behold the funeral candle
Its light showing you your grave
Behold the funeral candle
Accept your fate, die in vain
