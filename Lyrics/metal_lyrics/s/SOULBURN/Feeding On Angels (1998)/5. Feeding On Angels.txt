Dwelling through time,
Unseen by man
The dark is my guide,
Embracing it with a cold passion
Warmth is for me not existing,
Love is for me just repelling
Awakened by the sign of the black,
Lasting eternal sins (of damnation)

Some may call me hideous
But other embrace the fact
That I'm feeding on angels,
Accomplished light's death
Their blood tastes so warm,
Their goodness I devour
Don't deny your fate,
It belongs in my bowels

I'm a true apparition
For those who seek a warm salvation
Day or night, it doesn't matter,
My wrath will come undetected

This dream has been seen
By many kindred blackened souls
They all are the eyes and ears
Of my existence

Many battles took place,
Countless one were undecided
Yet, I still exist,
In mankind's sleep I am buried

Feed for me... on angels

Feeding on angels,
Their blood gives me strength
Chanting the winds,
Experience the eternal fire
Feeding on angel's death
Behold the angel's death
Trespass my domain
And it will be your demise
