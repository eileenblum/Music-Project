Iâve come from dead cold hearts
And ravished throughout time
Compelled into this vortex
of miserable light
Boundless is my fury
Indecent is my crime
Raping of the virtues
Satanic yet Divine

My countless names are trickery
Your soul was never thine
Obscured by fallen grace
I am he who rides the night

Black holes of tar and blood
Delivering sufficiency
To the death of all that lives
Now suck out the staggering pulse
Radical alliance
Of an ancient godless cult
No flesh no blood no human touch
may enter this revolt

My countless names are trickery
Your soul was never thine
Obscured by fallen grace
I am he who rides the night

In suffocating darkness

The soul burns
But who decides
Who walks amongst
Who stands aside
Who sends his ravens through the storm
And through a wolf shall be reborn
Lifeless yet vivid
Its motions come to life
Like a sunset for the blind
A holocaust for the light

Can you behold the grasp of your eclipse?
Can you see the shades revive?
Does the sun sets in your heart with every dawn?
The answers will divide

Lifeless yet vivid
Its motions come to life
Like a sunset for the blind
A holocaust for the light

My countless names are trickery
Your soul was never thine
Obscured by fallen grace
I am he who rides the night

All values are now lain to waste
In Suffocating Darkness
The harvest from this holy ground
Smothered into death
Asphyxiated winds of wrath
In Suffocating Darkness
Awakened force of evil
With the blackest taste of death
