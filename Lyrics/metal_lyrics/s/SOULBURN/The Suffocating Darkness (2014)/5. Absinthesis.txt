This crippled lie
and it's dreadful cause
A cause to become deteriorated
In fragments to endeavor true life

I life to watch it slip away
A monument that flourishis through ruin
Wherein a poisened taste revives
While death is beating a heart that thrives

Let the mesmerizing darkness take a hold on you
Let the churning of the bile redeem the pace
Heavy bones of tired life have come to burden you
In breathless sleep no prayers keep the warmth of grace

The exitement of this passage boiling up inside
As you linger to mediating death
The kiss of cunts lay twiching on your fading thoughts
Vaginal flavored tissue on your breath

There is a greater light we are creating
It is the flame that scorches your last sigh
Feeding the flames that make your soul burn
Wielding the scepter and the scythe

Subliminal cadaverous profanity
Eating my way through temples of flesh
Above these common ways ther is no gravity
The wickedness of virtue shows it's face

The sky is turning liquid Stars they drown in black
Abysmal winds are rising life a tide
Faceless is the horror but you feel it's there
In the ever drowning blackness of the night

There is a greater light we are creating
It is the flame that scorches your last sigh
Feeding the flames that make your soul burn
Wielding the scepter and the scythe

This crippled lie
and it's dreadful cause
A cause to become deteriorated
In fragments to endeavor true life...A cold life
