Cryptic psalms
Amidst the howling winds 
A scorching source
of agonizing bliss
Beneath its veil
Mysteries of a life beyond
Can you hear it?

Sons and daughters with hearts ablaze
Forsaken ones in deathâs embrace
Chant this hymn, behold in awe
The blessed curse, abort by law

Come reign with us
Enslave yourself unto the beast
Extend your lust
Tyrants of dark supremacy
Sons and daughters with hearts ablaze
Forsaken ones in deathâs embrace
Chant this hymn, behold in awe
The blessed curse, abort by law

Vomiting our gospels
at the trembling pillars of heaven
Godâs eyes wonât close
but endure our wrath forever

Hymn of the forsaken

The ashes of sanity 
Lies at our feet
Drenched in excrements
we devour it in contempt

Cleansed through regurgitation ablaze
We vomit forth the law of abhorrence

Through blood we deny Tetragrammation
Signals of death carved in flesh and bone
The crystal ball has shown us our morbid fate
Now lit the torch and abominate

Sons and daughters with hearts ablaze
Forsaken ones in deathâs embrace
Chant this hymn, behold in awe
The blessed curse, abort by law

You are just a feeble abortion
of a faith to be erased by claws
The crimson dawn is upon you
We storm forward to annihilate
â¦Begone
