In restless crawling death
Crossing the mirror void
In restless crawling death
Crossing the mirror void

And on these shattered arms
The wounds so deadly come
To let these rivers flow
To the mourning and its glow

Death comes slow

Existence is a rivalry
I must escape its path and release this earthly dwell
Deprive me from this legacy
For all I found is nothing but a useless pile of shit

Entranced by the rusty knife
I slice the skin and take the dive
All morals and your fucking hope
I bring to death and let them choke

Hereafter lies my destiny
Come and take me, bring me to my death
I'm boiling in this agony
Suicide come be my bride 'cause we were meant to be

Cross the mirror void
Alone I descend through the musty reeking dark
Death awaits
Slaughtering this vessel in the twilight of my fate

The breathless and the cold
Crossing the mirror void
Treasury... life's mystery
Trapped in timeless space

In restless crawling death
Crossing the mirror void
In restless crawling death
Crossing the mirror void

Awaken at the sight of the reaper
In deflowering transgression
A comfort yet uneasy
As I reach death's swampy ground

Entranced by the rusty knife
I slice the skin and take the dive
All morals and your fucking hope
I bring to death and let them choke

Hereafter lies my destiny
Come and take me, bring me to my death
I'm boiling in this agony
Suicide come be my bride 'cause we were meant to be

Cross the mirror void
Alone I descend through the musty reeking dark
Death no longer, longer awaits
Uplifted in this cosmic haze

The breathless and the cold
Crossing the mirror void
Treasury... life's mystery
Trapped in timeless space

In restless crawling death
Crossing the mirror void
In restless crawling death
