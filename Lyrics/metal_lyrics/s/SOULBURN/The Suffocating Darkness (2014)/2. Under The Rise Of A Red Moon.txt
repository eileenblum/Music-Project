Home, my shadows with transcending darkness
Come and reap away with their hearts
For I have traveled the wastelands of Nod
Where fruits lay to rot and the day is stillborn

Malign are its ways countless and harsh
Its walls breathing sulphur by burnstone unchained
Ripping out teeth from both glory and hope
For here I shall stand in the midst of sin

Ascending through the ashes to unknown heights
Caressing the horns at the summit of my damnation

Tempting the skies, now lower the heavens!
Let me take a bite from the palace of god
Destroying its vessel, ereasing the light
Harmony's ending, may crosses burn bright

I can smell the blood through the rain
As the heavens burst open with biblical shame
Come chaos, come fire... give birth to their fear!
Under the rise of the red moon, my demons draw near

In the midst of sin
Blackness fills the arteries
Come Alive!
You will never saturate in luciferian light

Closing the eyes of the sun and let shine
The fires of lucifer rise!
The cup of salvation, squandered and torn
Wilderness opens its heart

In the midst of sin
Blackness fills the arteries
Come Alive!
You will never saturate in luciferian light
Under the rise of the red moon
