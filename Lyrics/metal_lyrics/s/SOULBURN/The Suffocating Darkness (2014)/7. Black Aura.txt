My shivering skin is old
My wings are lost in flight
Deathâs whispers reach to me through echoes

The begging of the cold funeral ground
Its muffled deafening cries defy me

These red dead eyes they stare
And these are the eyes of the timeless beholder
and the ever yearning end
Black Aura

This boneless scepter inhaling my life
Sipping it like wine
it drains my once so vivid truth
Black Aura

My spirit liesâ¦Untamedâ¦Bewilderedâ¦Free!

Darkâ¦Spiritualâ¦Dormancy!
Darkâ¦Spiritualâ¦Dormancy!

Swallowed by this thick air
Cold blackness overthrows me
Drowning in ecstasy
Black Aura

A thrust of withered soil
dirt collides with dirt
as I plunge into the void
The tempting core of the abyss

A seductiveness so hollow
This crucible demise
Fallacious are the living
In vein will be their price
Internal lies the struggle
Like a corporeal burial ground
Apotheosis de la Morte
Wielding Death

A thrust of withered soil
dirt collides with dirt
as I plunge into the void
The tempting core of the abyss
Black Aura
