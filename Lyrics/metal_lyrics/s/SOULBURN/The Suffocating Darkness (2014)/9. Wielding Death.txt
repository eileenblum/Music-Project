"corpora lente augescent rito extinguuntur:cineria gloria sera est"

Sepulchral fog
On my stinking breath
Views drained
from color and frame

Lucid Inferno in Fiery Haze
Incinerate:Get ablaze

Vultures gather
swirling high
round and round
the mystic sky
Eagerly awaiting
on Smoldering bones
Scorching feathers 
upon Death's throne

Lucid Inferno in Fiery Haze
Incinerate:Get ablaze

The farewell of patterns:share the hollow from the pace
By the call of it's initiation:and the wanting from the graves

Sepulchral fog
On my stinking breath
Views drained
from color and frame

An impetuous alliance
departing my flesh
Indulge into twilight
Bereft of any doubt

Lucid Inferno in Fiery Haze
Incinerate:Get ablaze
