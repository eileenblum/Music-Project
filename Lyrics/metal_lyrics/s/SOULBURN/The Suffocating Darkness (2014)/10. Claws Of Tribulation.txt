Claws of Tribulation
Redeemer of Hope
You cleanse, you thrive
Ye glorious sun

Discord of heart, Abort of thought
The tempest within, So profound

Claws of Tribulation
and the black death
Breathing demise
Breeding despised

The apotheosis
of failure and flesh
of Whores and of shit filled wombs
and their immaculate death

Claws of Tribulation
Your shining is like a star
Yet your light is embracing
The darkness of my heart

Storms of chaos sweeping forth
Discord of heart
With radiant malicious force
Abort of thought
Cleansing winds of cutting steel
Harvesting impurity
Unbroken I lay sanctified
In Symbiosis with the night

Awaken the hounds of hell
Prayers will be in vain
Existence of the frail
Smothered in crushing Darkness
Genocidal overload
The rotten stench of death exposed
The holiest of holy ghosts
Hail Satan!

Claws of Tribulation
And all in your grasp
You feed your hunger 
With consuming depth

The apotheosis
of failure and flesh
of Whores and of shit filled wombs
and their immaculate death

From within us the abyss
and from the outside on the edge
Looking inwards in once self
You may loose but never in doubt
Drowning evermore
Caught within these claws
As the Tribulation calls
and your skin grows cold
