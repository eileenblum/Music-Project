Welcome, this is you
Roaming on your unknown track
Symphony of life
Courage flowing wild
Essence for all fears to drown

Heartbeats - quiet and slow
Drums of war
The body's tired, days of cold
Devils howl
You hide away all your scars
Behind your pallid smile
You don't allow your heart to rejoice and dance
You are lost
Without a vision on your one way street
Climbing mountains with no top
You don't move, you don't breathe

Find your healing path, survivor

Stop bullets with your hands
And cause this hell to shake
Forget the blood you've bled

Fly, I'll share your heavy load
Vanish, emptiness of doubt
Hold the key of choice in hand
Break your sleep

Feel (the) symphony of life
Flooding veins and minds
An overture divine
When it all comes crashing down
Defeats are carving wounds
Wounds, piles of ache
Claws piercing skin
Stabbing in your back

You fly with fragile wings
While dreams collapse and fall
Hope's coming to an end
While you are wasting gifts
Living for today
Abject and exposed in your void

Answers you could find
Once your journey has commenced on gliding wings
Everlasting hold
Turn your back and walk away
From the howling wind that blows
From waves devouring faith
Leave the blind behind

Everlasting day, wreckage to prevail
Start to breathe
