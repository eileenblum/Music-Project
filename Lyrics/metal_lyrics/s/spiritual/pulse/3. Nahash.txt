Nights smile eternal, you can't see ahead
You forbid your soul to triumph
Conceive while you grow
You'll reap what you sow
It's your challenge not to fail, will you fail?

No!

Form your visions, forge your key
Don't proceed to sit in silence
Flashing schemes throughout your brain
Keep your soul alive

It is you who must find the truth and find it on your own
Fill yourself with meaning, lead yourself homeward
Take a deep breath, because life is waiting for you

Uncage!
