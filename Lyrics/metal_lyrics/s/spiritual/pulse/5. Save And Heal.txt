Passing time dulls your ache
Ache you feel when your life pumps weak
Find the sun that you hide
Mercy stumbles around, grace is a shame to waste
Troubles multiply your anger and suspend your growth

Save your broken wings
And heal your wounds to revive
Save and heal to sustain all the nails
To efface all that fails

You're just sailing a sea without port
You're just hiking on unhoused ground - recourse lost
Falling prey, to the wolves
A time of strife

A confusing place to be
Greed is biting sympathy
Sense your strength and arise
Life's not just a throw of dice
Many summits left to climb
Many road maps unfulfilled

Navigate, you don't need to be lead
