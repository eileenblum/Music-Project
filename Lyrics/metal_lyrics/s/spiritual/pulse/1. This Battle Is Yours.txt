Run, our world collides
Faint bricks of paradox
Climb the walls, in your heart you know that you must run
Hell's taking over and our clouds are bleeding free
No return, it's the way your life was meant to be

Now encamp!
Wonders to discover
Don't be idle

Learn to grow you are a vagabond that needs to stand
Hold your head up high when tears are shed
Because this battle's yours

Mankind just disagrees since all common sense has fled
Blood cascades
Deadly tides coming up
Don't crawl, head up, fist your hands
No loss will get you down
Give demons reasons to frown
For they'd ruin your day
Dispel colorless hollow ideals

Defeats for the sinning brood!
Then leave for the healing ports to be

Bodies so tired and no treasures to save or to unearth
Just a shell, without grace and all alone

When all you have is fallen apart
Don't burst into a spirit of rage
Enjoy the wild rotation from one chamber to the other
Don't become heavy and low
Because you have a willing mind and a ready soul
Your battle now begins
