You've Been Thinking I've Been Drinking.
Well. That's Right Man... Pass One
On Down. Letting Everything Get To
My Head. Hey Man. So What Are You
Thinking About? I'm Not Joking. She's
Been Smoking. You're Baby Girl. She's
Been Running Around. By Now She's
Got Every Disease. Spreading All Her
Loving All Over The Town. What Are
You Thinking About? About A Better
Place? Where You Can Think About
Thinking About Nothing At All?
