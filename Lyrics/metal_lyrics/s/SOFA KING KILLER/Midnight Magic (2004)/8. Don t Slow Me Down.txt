If You Could Walk In My Shoes. I Tell
You Where You'd Go. You'd Run Across
The Oceans. Wake Up In Mexico. If You
Could Open My Hero. I Tell You What
You'd See. The Parts Are All.
Rearranged And Some Are Just Missing.
Slow It Down. Don't Slow Me Down.
If You Could Look Through My Eyes.
I Tell You What You'd See. A
World Gone Completely Mad.
Everyone But Me. Help Me Out. I Can
Not Speak It So... Help Me Out. If I
Could Climb That Mountain. I Tell You
What I'd Do. Once I Reach The Summit.
I'd Take A Piss On You.
