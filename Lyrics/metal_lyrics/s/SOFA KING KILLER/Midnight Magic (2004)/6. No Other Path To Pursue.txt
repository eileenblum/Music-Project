Sitting Around. Wasting Time. If You
Where Mine. I'd Be Alright. Sitting In A
Prison Cell Late That Night. Just
Trying To Work It Out And Make
Things Right. But If I Had You. Well I'd
Be Just Fine. How Do I Get You Off Of
My Mind? If Only God Had Made A 48-Hour
Day. Well. I'd Probably Sit
Around And Do Nothing Anyway. But If
I Had You. I'd Be Just Fine. Tell Me
What I've Got To Do To Make You All
Mine. She's A Drug.
