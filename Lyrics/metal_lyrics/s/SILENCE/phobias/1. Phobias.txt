I lost it all
And I don't quite know how this began
And it's sinking in
It's got me thinking again about my past
And how I let it all slip away
I can't believe that in the end

It's what I fucking became
I know that I'm fed up
I've had enough
Open my eyes
Open my mind

I've lost it all
And I don't quite know how this began
And it's sinking in
It's got me thinking again

Recognize what's real inside
Decipher between your heart and your mind

Selfish disease
I'm pleading to let go of me
If it's not real
Then why am I so stricken by the thought?

It's got me thinking again
It's got me thinking again in my head

Selfish disease
I'm pleading to let go of me
My mind scares the living shit out of me
I've been losing grip on my own reality
Opened up to the dark side you see
I'm done living under your oppression

[2x]
Inside what lies behind
The aesthetics of reality

Why don't you just fucking recognize what's real inside ?
Decipher between your heart and your mind
Let's go
I'd like to take a second to stop and thank all you motherfuckers
That stood in my way

Recognize that this is the last time
You act like you're above me
I fucking know that I'm fed up
I've had enough
Open your eyes
Open our minds

[2x]
I've lost it all
And I don't quite know how this began
And now it's sinking in
It's got me thinking again

About my past and how it all slipped away
I can't believe that in the end it's what I fucking became
Get up
