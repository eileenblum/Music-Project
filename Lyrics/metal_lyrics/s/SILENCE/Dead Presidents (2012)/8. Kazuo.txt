i know the way you move, it wasn't like this before. this time you've gone too far, reactions become static. resulting in poor judgement. impassive condition of regression and coordinating your own depressive state of mind. subconscious is in disarray, always falling for the same mistakes. you know it's hard to see past this empathy. when anger comes as easy as the passing of time. i hope it's not too late, but you'll swear it was worth it in the end. you'll lose your focus. it was invited and welcomed to remain, attached to pride, removed me in spite of so many failed attempts for connection. there are two kinds of people in this world: there's the one's who make it and the one's who get sold. if you recall i saw this coming from the start. take one step and i will tear you apart.
