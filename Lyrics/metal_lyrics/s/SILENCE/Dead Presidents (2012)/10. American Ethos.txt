[feat. Dorn Fox of Bad Luck and Von Wolfe]the leaders are broken, they've closed the door. winning public opinion, making peace with the poor. feeding them questions, always searching for more. truth never existed. so much talk of sweet salvation but you'll never back it up. financed by their mental pollution but they'll never get enough. a foreign dependency, how pathetic we've become. cradled by authority in an endless drone. we are the orphans of our own thought, absent minds with an absence of hope trading our wealth for the sake of growing old. and they'll come in their robes with nailed hands on your shoulders, whether they're dead or alive. telling both geographic and cultural fiction, ignoring the changing of times.
