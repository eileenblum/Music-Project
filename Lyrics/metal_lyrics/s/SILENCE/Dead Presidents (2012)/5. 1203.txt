i will break the barriers if it's the last thing i ever do and i will die and my life will stand for something. i will break the barriers in your mind if it's the last thing i ever do. i've waited for this all my life. we build ourselves up, just to bring each other down. we are the kings and we wear the fools crown. every day i watch my brother take the knife from my fathers back, just to put it in their own chest. there is a void i cannot stand to see but not a soul is going to listen to me. no one's fucking listening.
