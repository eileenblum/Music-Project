does it ever end? the feeling, the memory, to give in to it. i can't do this again, it's only in my head so pull me out of this. 30 days kept awake since i found out and i will not forget. i swear to god the next time you speak those words to me, it never even meant anything. i understand that this life is about overcoming, but you'll never see me stop dragging this out. it's coming to the point where forgiving is forgetting, i guess we're better off forgetting you. i am beginning to see now that you will not survive this. the reality of your actions caught up with you. running around in these circles again. i can't stop what you have started, this consciousness gives me so much stress. i'm worn down by the thought of knowing the past stays, but i could never forget.
