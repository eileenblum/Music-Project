you think you understand me. listening to the voice of a liar, let it drown out your own. this was all in my imagination, building illusions of a life i believed in. i'd rather know that this was all a fucking lie. my only comfort for now will come from knowing this: you will never forget my face. this isn't simple and it won't come easy. what did you ever dream in the future? i can't help that you see me this way. did you really believe you could save us? we're turning back to the same old cycle. a thousand voices telling me to just stay away, but i can never seem to shake this. i could never just stop, just let me be. ghost image of the ones i used to love. seven days since i left your reality, i realize that i don't give a fuck. mind opened, you cannot change this. with time you'll learn this will end in regret. our world is empty, there's only the fake left. join the cycle, you're just another image. closed eyes, closed minds. this is the end, the only way left.
