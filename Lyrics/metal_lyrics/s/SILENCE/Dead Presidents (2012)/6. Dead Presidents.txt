[feat. Adam and Dylan of Playing for Keeps]why is it that the rest of the world knows we're being lied to? that there's something fucking wrong. but our own people can't stomach that the bigger picture hides inside our minds. lose your fucking ignorance, we were created to consume. feed up you fucking pigs your heart beats so much slower. never question what you're told, swallow it out of their hands without a thought. whatever happened to accountability i understand it's a selfish world, spending lives with your dead presidents for your entitlements. while the ancients sit back and watch the nation die, illusions of progress in all the emptiness. feeding the monster, funding the overseer. if this is it, look around, wake the fuck up. i can only take so much before it's enough. we're all so sick of hearing all your lies. the purest evil derives from lack of knowledge.
