determined to make a name for yourself, to fill the void that was never empty. you claim false innocence, i claim you motherless. you just don't know who i am, where i come from. we climb from the bottom up. i refuse to be nothing in their eyes. you're not my friend, family you'll never own a fucking part of me. this is what you get. the situation was never as it seemed. you turned your back on me, you'll turn on everyone and when you came back clinging to my skin like an open wound i refuse to let you in.
