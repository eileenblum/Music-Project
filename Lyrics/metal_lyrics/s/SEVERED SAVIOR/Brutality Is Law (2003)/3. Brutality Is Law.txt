I am the blade that cuts through life
To put them in their place
Beyond the grave
I am the blade of the guillotine
I am the face of the suffering
Walk through the valley of death
Executions are my bliss
No one lives through this
I am the blade of the guillotine
Which falls all day, you are only flesh
Brutality in the flesh
Brutality in the flesh
I am the face of Death in itself
Just another prayer for the dead
For what you see is a bag
Of blood which will rot
Until the end of time
I am the blade of the guillotine
Which falls all day, you are only flesh
BRUTALITY IS THE LAW
BRUTALITY IS THE LAW OF THE LAND
