Servants of filth, serve me now, arise
Blessed by the beast, reborn in the feces
Through my eyes he will see
Blessed by the beast, the death of creation
Praise the horns of Satan
In my breathe he will breathe, I will breathe
In my flesh he will be, I will be
Through my eyes he will see, I will see
Chaos will embody
I bleed for thee, takes me
I'm the messenger of Satan
I will be one with thee
By my hand spoil thee creation
Demons screaming my name
By this curse I'm blessed by Satan
Blessing by Satan's flame
Servants of filth, serve me now, arise
I bleed for thee, take me
I'm the messenger of Satan
I will be one with thee
By my hand spoil thee creation
Demons screaming my name
By this curse I'm blessed by Satan
Blessing by Satan's flame
By my hand spoil thee creation
Blessed by the beast, reborn in the feces
Through my eyes he will see
Blessed by the beast, the death of creation
Praise the horns of Satan
In my breathe he will breathe, I will breathe
In my flesh he will be, I will be
Through my eyes he will see, I will see
Chaos will embody
I'm the messenger of Satan
By my hand spoil thee creation
