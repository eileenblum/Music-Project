In cold blood
The pressure expands as my mind explodes
Thoughts control my actions, forced to bleed
Infected with life, I seek my cure from death
Gripping tighter on your neck
I realize you're drowning in your own blood
Drowning in your blood, I let go of your neck
Death came faster than I would expect
My emotions are expressed by your torture
What came of me?
How can I completely go insane and start killing
Everything in sight?
In cold blood
The pressure expands as my mind explodes
Thoughts control my actions, forced to bleed
Infected with life
Gripping tighter on your neck
I realize you're drowning in your own blood
Drowning in your blood, I let go of your neck
Your death came faster than I would expect
My emotions are expressed by your torture
What came of me?
How can I completely go insane and start killing?
The pressure expands as my mind explodes
Thoughts control my actions
Infected with life, I seek my cure from death
