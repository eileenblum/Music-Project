Falling from the burnt sky
Jaws of Hell open wide
Falling from the sky, they suffer
Burning angels claw at unheavenly skies
Darkness eternally growing
One by one, they will fall
To the lake of fire, the Pagan Messiah
Destroys the altar
Ascend unto thy winds, rising above
The boiling ocean
One by one, they will fall
To the lake of fire, the Pagan Messiah
Destroys the altar, In a storm of fire
What is your desire?
One by one, threw into the abyss
Darkness eternally growing
Falling from the burnt sky
Jaws of hell open wide
Falling from the sky, they suffer
Burning angels claw at unheavenly skies
One by one...
