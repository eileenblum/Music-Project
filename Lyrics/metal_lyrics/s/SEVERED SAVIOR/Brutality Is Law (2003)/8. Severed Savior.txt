No man shall liver under one God
Save yourself if you are a king
Die for a lie you mean nothing to me Christ
Welcome to the burial sight
You will not find a thing
You're so blind but you follow the lies
When will you find a meaning?
When will you find the truth's simplicity?
Have you completely lost hope
Giving up to a false divinity?
Brainwashed to believe in God
Denial that has been taught
Sever the God of hypocrisy
Sever the God of a deity
Sever the God of hypocrisy
Sever the God of a deity
Inveracity consuming the breed
Holy scripture engraved, believe and be saved
You are nothing to me, I'm already free
Adversary of thee, Christianity
Arrive you king of thieves
Show yourself unto thee
I will not believe in the prophecy
When will you find the truth's simplicity?
Have you completely lost hope
Giving up to a false divinity?
Inveracity consuming the breed
Holy scripture engraved, believe and be saved
So be it
