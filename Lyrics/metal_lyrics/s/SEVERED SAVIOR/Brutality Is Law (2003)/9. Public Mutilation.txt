Public mutilation
Staring down the barrel
My tool is my rifle, of assassination
Public mutilation
Twelve gauge fully loaded, carnage is the motive
Predator of the people
Massacre of the human race
Massacre of the human race
I was led here to seal their fate
Outrage of bullets spread
The wasteland of humans dead
Create destruction my glory
Celebrate the death of history
Massacre the human race, mutilate
Reborn in hate, I mutilate
Eviscerate
Ritual of execution
Cleanser of the human pollution
Massacre the human race, mutilate
I'm reborn, in hate I mutilate, eviscerate, execution
Ominous one unseen, concealed in surroundings
Staring down the barrel, predator of the people
Ominous one unseen, concealed in surrounding
Twelve gauge fully loaded, carnage is the motive
Predator of the people
Massacre of the human race
Humans bleed so easily
Massacre of the human race
I am here to seal their fate
Public mutilation
Staring down the barrel
My tool is my rifle, of assassination
Public mutilation
Mutilation
