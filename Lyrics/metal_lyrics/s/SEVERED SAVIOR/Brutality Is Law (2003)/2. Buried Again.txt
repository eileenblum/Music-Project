What have I done to myself?
Why wont this pain go away?
No time for this beast to rest
Not with so much flesh on the Earth
Evil inside of me, human killing machine
Power stronger than ten, bodies buried again
What have I done to myself?
Why wont this pain go away?
No time for this beast to rest
Not with so much flesh on the Earth
Blood covers me
Baptize my grave
A tendency to feast on death
Whats this pain I am with?
I can not control myself
Evil inside of me, human killing machine
Power stronger than ten, bodies buried again
What have I done to myself?
Why wont this pain go away?
No time for this beast to rest
Not with so much flesh on the Earth
Blood covers me
