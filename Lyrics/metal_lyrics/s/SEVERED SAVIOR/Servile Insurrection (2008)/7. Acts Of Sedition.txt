Defiantly opposing your own
Weakening the foundation
Jeopardizing stability with betrayal
Rebellion for reasons to defy your kind, treason
Of the highest degree
Do you think severance will set you free?
Think again
Disconnect from us and
Depend on all against one in the end
Fend for your life as your strength descends
Your defenses will fail
Against the masses you were born into
Retribution, execution, sentenced for your false delusions
You have chosen to be disfavored by your equals as a traitor
Traitor, your acts of sedition will have you punished by death
For your betrayal

Await the hammer's fall
Full force
Revenge will take its course
Silence
Apologize no more it's worthless

No sympathy for the betrayer

Await the hammer's fall
Full force
Revenge will take its course
Silence
Apologize no more it's worthless

Punishment will come full force
You brought this upon yourself
Regret sets in as you realize what you've done
Suffer the consequences for your actions
You thought you could not get caught
Yet here you are in the hands of ones you defied
Beg for the forgiveness that you will never receive
There is no mercy for an adversary
Depend on all against one in the end
Fend for your life as your strength descends
Your defenses have fallen
Against the masses you were born into
Retribution, execution, sentenced for your false delusions
You have chosen to be disfavored by your equals as a traitor
Traitor, your acts of sedition has had you punished by death
For your betrayal
Execution sentence for your acts of treason
