Inevitable
Impenetrable
Ignorance reverses intelligence
Devolving as a whole
Evolving as spoils of war
A cureless disease we are
Endless battle for survival
Illogical decisions throughout time
Causing the death of mankind
We are all equal
Yet most ignore the very fact that they are
War is inevitable
Throughout all life forms
Every specimen for himself
Strives to survive
Always on the defense
Born with their natural instincts at the surface
But humanity is the most cowardly of all kinds
Nuclear assault over
As every other species only knows
Bullets overthrowing blows
Innocence has absolutely no defense
Yet several have fallen at the drop of a bomb
Not knowing their lives are in the hands
Of cravens they've never met
How do you feel about your species?
Descendants of creatures that fight with their hands
Not technology created and influenced by fear
Damage done from a distance
To ensure their protection
Careless of defenseless beings
Not losing sleep over what they have done
The thing they don't realize is you can't sleep when you're dead
Inevitable
Impenetrable
We will be the cause of our own demise
Devolving as a whole
Evolving as spoils of war
