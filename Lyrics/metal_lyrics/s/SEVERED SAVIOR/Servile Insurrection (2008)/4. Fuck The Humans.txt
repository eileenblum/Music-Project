I have nothing but sorrow for your kind
Is this your reality or your demise?
I have severed everything that ties this world to myself
Picking up what was left
I'm glad you're all gone from my life
My world
I have forgotten what my life was
I have nothing but sorrow for your kind
I must retaliate
Sworn to revenge
I must retaliate
Sworn to revenge
Trying to remember times when I lived my life to please others
I will now be myself
I will now lay in wait
Set to take back what you took from me
Trying to remember times when I lived my life
I have forgotten
My life
What I was
my oath
I am sworn to revenge
Killing
Retaliation
You deserve

[Lyrics: Severed Savior]
