Ears and noses will be the trophies of the day
Collect the morbid keepsakes as a reminder of your suffering
Abolishing the filth that keeps me from victory
Paths will be cleared at all cost
Pummeling the barriers between me and destiny
Determination in your obliteration
Looking down on you begging for your last breath
I welcome the calculation of your time since death
Excepting the challenge meant your defeat
Such malice for an opponent
Summons inner euphoria
Deep within the stem
You have threatened the execution of my plan
But I will be the last one to stand
Rewards of cruelty

[Lyrics: Anthony Trapani]
