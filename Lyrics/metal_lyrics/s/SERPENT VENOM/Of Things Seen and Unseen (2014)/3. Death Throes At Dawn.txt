Uneasy mind breeding fantasy 
Live in a world of lies
You just can't cope with the agony
These wounds won't heal with time

The demons etching away 
Our heads are bowed down 
In shame
Last chance now
Death throes at dawn
It's over you're too far gone

The unseen ruling you
We ignored the signs
Out of your mind in this misery
Colliding stars align

The demons etching away 
Our heads are bowed down 
In shame
Last chance now
Death throes at dawn
It's over you're too far gone

Unlucky charms they are all
You have
You take them to the grave 
Reflecting on what will never be 
And what you'll never have

The demons etching away
Our heads are bowed down in shame
Last chance now
Death throes at dawn
It's over you're too far gone
