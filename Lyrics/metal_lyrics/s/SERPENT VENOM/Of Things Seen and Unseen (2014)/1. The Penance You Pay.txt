Send a bride to the sun
Appease his anger with blood
Walk the path chosen for you
As you ascend flesh and bone

The loveless ones
The fallen children of earth
Never will they be seen again
And still you think
That they will rise for you
You're wrong
Their faces haunt you in your sleep

Years of pain now you carry
This penance to the gods you'll pay
Lost your daughters to fire
For your sons the end of days

They'll never see
There's no wickedness
They believe

The loveless ones
The fallen children of earth

Never will they be seen again
And still you think
That they will rise for you
You're wrong
Their faces haunt you in your sleep
