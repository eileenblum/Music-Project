Lost souls horizon
The warriors of hell marching on
The king crowned in fire
Forever a slave to his oath

There are no masters
There's only you
Sorrows bastard
That's you

There are legions of serpents
You're crawling
Amongst your own kind
This life drags you under
Realities driving you down
To the ground

You're praying hard to your gods
They'll always leave you to die

Lost souls horizon
The warriors of hell marching on
The king crowned in fire
Forever a slave to his oath

There are no masters
There's only you
Sorrows bastard
That's you
