Burning in the night
The wishes we have made
Pilgrims of the sun
Their paths are set ablaze
Sent upon your way
The atavists and whores
A life of solitude
Alone they wage their wars

It's at your door, too late to turn
It's at your door, with us you'll burn
It's at your door

There's phantoms in the sky
A world too late to save
As mercies angels cry black tears
For the brave
You're casting circles and
Summoning your dead
You're climbing up the walls
As hope turns into dread

It's at your door, too late to turn
It's at your door, with us you'll burn
It's at your door

Blood of the cult
Cult of the damned
Damned are your words
These words of shame

There's no more history
Redemption for the lost
Blinded by our faith
We never count the cost
Tomorrows victims are
Your enemies and foes
You're trapped inside yourself
A place where hate will grow

It's at your door, too late to turn
It's at your door, with us you'll burn
It's at your door
