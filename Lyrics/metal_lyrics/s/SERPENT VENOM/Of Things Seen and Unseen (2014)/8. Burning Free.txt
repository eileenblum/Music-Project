Your soul I've come to reap
This world you'll never leave
Losing the will to shine
A path of deaths design

This life becomes a ritual
Out of your mind again
Your time is burning free
Out from the void again

No flowers mark your grave
A lost soul now enslaved
This mist you can't see through
Deaths hand is leading you

This life becomes a ritual
You're out of your mind again
Your time is burning free
Out from the void again

Life taken upon the wings of age
Skulls laid out in line for all to see
When will it end this tragedy
Blind leading the blind into insanity

See out this life
Burn free your time
See out this life
Burn free your time
