Black star in blood red sky
Foresee days of disaster
Sent to kill all we find
We're no longer the masters

Lords of life
Send your dead to fight
For us all
This curse lives

Death will reign on this night
Now we're frozen with fear
Rivers flow with our blood
Drown the sun with our tears

Black winged god curse your suns
Luciferian ways
Cross upturned in his fist
Tyrant of our dismay

Lords of life
Send your dead to fight
For us all
This curse lives

Stand in line wait your turn
Fall as one as we burn
I've no more life to give
Ashes now where you lived

To this plight they are blind
End of time funeral child
Generations decay
Too much got in our way
Lords of life on their thrones
Minds like temples of stone
Like temples of stone

Lords of life on their thrones
Minds like temples of stone
