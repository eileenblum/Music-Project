This tomb my reason
Seen through an empty glass
Fed on the bones of my last chance
The vultures circle
The black skies up ahead
You'll be the light
That shines forever

As I let them starve
A life left to chance
As I let them starve

The parasites are healing
Work their way inside
This unseen terror of my life
Beholden goddess
Thirteen lucky charms
This fear I swore I'd keep inside

As I let them starve
A life left to chance
As I let them starve

Spiritual power
All good is slain

Welcome to afterlife
A world that's drenched in pain
Never ending hunger
It comes again
My blood as black as night
Flows through these rotting vein
