Losing your mind
Losing your self control
Your lifes so unkind
Death leaving you on your
own again

Outside reality
Suffer the memory
I know i'll never see her face again

I thought you would last
My queen of serenity
Got stuck in the past
Your evil takes hold of me
again

Can't you see what you
have done
Know now you're not the
only one
who will pay for all your crimes
You'll be left waiting for 
all time

I have become what you've
become
You broke the circle on 
your own
And as you're fighting for 
your life
The outside it is where
you go
and you'll know
