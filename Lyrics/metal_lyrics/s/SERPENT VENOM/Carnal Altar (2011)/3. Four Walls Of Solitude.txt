In the walls of solitude, your world devoid of light
In the depths of misery your Hell arriving tonight

Cycle of insanity, Hell's Angel waiting for me
In a dream she's setting me free
Pentagram burned into her skull

Alone on this Earth
Four walls to keep you in
You're dead from your birth
Summoning higher power
Your body released
Solace in the Thirteenth hour

You made your love with the ancient Goddess
Now you know you've lost your mind
You made your love with the ancient Goddess
She kills the love
I have seen your fallen Earth, and look around - the eye's on you
I have seen your fallen Earth and death from above

Corroded mind's filled with disease
Suffer now for what you need
We ride on eternally
We will never be set free
