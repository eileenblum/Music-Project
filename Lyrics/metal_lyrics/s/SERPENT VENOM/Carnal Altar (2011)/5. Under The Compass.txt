Ritual tonight
From the dawn of
madness we arise
Blood spilt on sight
The followers sent here
just to die

Blind eyes of the
damned
The winter comes and it
will never end
The tombstone sky is
filled with tears
Forever man will cry

Realm of shadows
See the fire
I have felt the flames
Witches sabbath
I'm a doomed man
I'll never breath again

Time to realise,
not why we're here,
but why we're born to die
Our shattered souls are
laid to waste
Our crippled lives are
claimed here

All love is lost in here
The mystic claims
her share
As we are lost in here
