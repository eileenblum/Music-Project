Blackest sign of the times
Sacred dance around the firelight
Holy witch, she raised the flames
As we all must chant her name

Immortal demon - follow her ways of old

See the souls gripped with fear
Screaming out, their time is near
Hide behind your iron cross
Left behind with those you lost

Immortal demon - follow her ways of old

Driven insane
Into their graves

Satan's laughing as he's calling your name
Fortune smiles, no one to blame but yourself
Procession headed straight to the sky
It's all too much, into their graves they climb
Into their graves they climb
