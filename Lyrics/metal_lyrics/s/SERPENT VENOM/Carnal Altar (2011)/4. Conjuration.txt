In visions at night I see
the widow
Her cold staring eyes
are burned into my
soul
And from those sullen 
eyes I'm sure the tears
will flow
as damnation curses
me for evermore

I'm losing the will
Sent in for the kill
I can't believe that
you're
the king of earth in
chaos
Yeah

I'm losing myself in 
endless rivers
That slowly lead me
towards temptations
arms
The sun will realign
and cast its shadow
upon everything that
we have ever known

I'm losing the will
Sent in for the kill
I can't believe that
you're
the king of earth in
chaos
Yeah

I would wait forever for 
you
in my own hell
The gods conspire
against us all
Now realise your sins
Jesus sat beneath the 
skull
He's baptised in blood
Widow falling on her
knees
She cares no more
