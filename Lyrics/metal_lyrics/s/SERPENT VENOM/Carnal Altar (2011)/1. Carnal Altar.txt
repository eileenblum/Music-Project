Cast out on your 
knees
You're becoming my 
disease
Everyone ignores your 
pleas
Now there's a void 
where you once stood

Damned souls 
returning 
Gathering at the altar
Black candles burning 
out
for you

The people they betray 
You're foretold you 
must obey
My sorrow forced you 
out
Now this life's 
decaying you

Damned souls 
returning 
Gathering at the altar
Black candles burning 
out
for you

We're gone forever
you become the slave
A journey to the end
towards the sea of
graves

You'll hang upon my
words
You'll hang upon these
words
The end can now begin
Cleanse you
vanquishing the sins

There's nothing left to
pray for now
redemption's leaving
you somehow
Your masters love
revealed in pain
in emptyness alone
you'll reign

Lady of the dark
my cemetary bride
Addictions paralysing
you
Another thing to die
for
