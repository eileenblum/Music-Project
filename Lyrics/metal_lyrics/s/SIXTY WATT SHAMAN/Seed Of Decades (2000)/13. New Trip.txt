Come on, take a trip with us on crystal ships
We'll check out the system
We'll ride our high to other sides and not deny
We've got an addiction to these rhythms
Stars are burning, Haley's screaming
Drink some more 'cause we're just beginning
To make the night and break through spaces
We can always keep ourselves spinning

You know you wanna take a ride
Don't you wanna come along
We're going to the other side
I knew that you would come along

Satellites will light the night and show the way
To steer through the vision
Hold the wheel, I'll watch the course that lights the way
To burn what you need, what you want
Now, I believe I can see the truth ahead
Explodes like a new star, and we're reeling
Toward supernova tractor beams that pull us in
Get what we need, what we want

You know you wanna take a ride
Don't you wanna come along
We're going to the other side
I knew that you would come along

Alright
So you better hold on
You better hold on
So you better hold on
You're comin' along for the ride

Medicine men track in the sand
Of the planet where we'll land, safe as houses
Burn the peace pipe, you know we just might
Raise the flame of the funk when we douse this
Fire of desire in the gyre, we're movin' higher
We've got it here, just right
And even without a sound, we can get down
And take this groove into the night

New trip
New trip
New trip
New trip
New trip
New trip
