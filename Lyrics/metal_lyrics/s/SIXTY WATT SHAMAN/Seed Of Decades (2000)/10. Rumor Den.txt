Yeah, I've been with you before

Shall we call it our
Private treasure
In the rumor den
All together are
Songs of pleasure
And indulgences

And we break it down like this
Like this
Like this
Like this

Go out to the bar
Get in my car
Where we've never been
And despite it all
We'll connect ours
In the rumor den

And we break it down like this
Like this
Like this
Like this
In the rumor den

Yeah, I've been with you before
And I'll be with you again
I said
Yeah, I've been with you before
And I'll be with you again

I've been with you before
And I'll be with you again
And again
And again
And again...

In the rumor den
I will be
With you
Again
