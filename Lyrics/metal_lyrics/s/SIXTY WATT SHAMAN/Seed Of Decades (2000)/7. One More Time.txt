One more time

One more time, we blow these lines
And celebrate this crazy life
Past is dying and soon has come
Electric now, what we've begun

One more time, we may shine
Like coronas of blazing light
Raising hell and rock all night
One more time, we may shine, alright
Alright

One more time, we blow these lines
And celebrate this crazy life
Past is dying and soon has come
Electric now, what we've begun

One more time, we may shine
Like coronas of blazing light
Raising hell and rock all night
One more time, we may shine, alright
Alright

One more time

One more time, we may shine
Like coronas of blazing light
Raising hell and rock all night
One more time, we may shine, alright
