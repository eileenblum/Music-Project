If you're not busy being born, you must be busy dying
Standing up is hard to do, when you live a life of lying
If you're not being born, you must be busy dying
Learn to stand up on your own, it's time you best start trying

If you're not busy being born, you must be busy dying
When the truth knocks at your door, your consequence is crying
If you're not being born, you must be busy dying
When the truth done got you down, then get on with your dying
Dyin'...

Crippled sunshine, dogleg blues and all dogs have their day
Sing old tunes and wash these blues, it's calm beneath these waves
More important how we take our fate than what it is
How we live
Busy dying

All this time, I watched you die
I lay you down and waste my time
Get up, stand up
??

Don't you want to drink the wine
You'll find me dyin' on the vine
Tonight we put it on the line
Busy livin', busy dyin'
