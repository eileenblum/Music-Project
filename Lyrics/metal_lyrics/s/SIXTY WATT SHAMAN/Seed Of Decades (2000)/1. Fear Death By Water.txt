Now come the hell or high water
I'm a'take my rest
How long is the river
Where does it end

Alone
Pleasure of the guest
How long does the river run
Where does it end

Weight on the levee
Weight on the dam
Don't break down
Don't break down

Drink to drown your sorrow
Sorrow learns to swim
Don't expect to sink too long
Your card is drawn again

The phoenecian sailor
Pearls that were his eyes
Three staves and a holy wheel
Rivers don't run dry

Weight on the levee
Weight on the dam
Don't break down
Don't break down
Don't break down...

Somewhere across the hungry land
Down old Zion's trail
Well, the river is sleeping
How long, no one can tell

Alone
By the river's edge
Calling me to the water
Mysteries revealed

Weight on the levee
Weight on the dam
Don't break down
Don't break down
Don't break down...
