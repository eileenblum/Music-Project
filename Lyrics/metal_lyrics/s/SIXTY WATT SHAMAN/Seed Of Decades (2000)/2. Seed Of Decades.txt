I had the feeling I was carrying my head in my hands
Feet like a mile away and I could barely stand
Seemed I'd lost my way once again
Green absinthe at the liquor store to ask for direction

Direction
A little bit of
Direction

Hours later, west side at the tattoo shop
Somethin' 'bout a bottle of pills and black tooth shots
The soothsayer said a prayer and sent me out on my way
Seeds in hand, I made the land with a swagger off into the gray

Direction
A little bit of
Direction

I had the feeling I was underneath the light of the sun
Sowing seeds across the great union
Now they grow, now we know, somehow we've freed our minds
And we enjoy the fruit of these, an alchemy divine

Direction
A little bit of
Direction

Be my mama, save my soul
Fill my lungs with rock 'n' roll
Smoke my mama, smoke the bowl
Seed of decades, rock 'n' roll

Seed of decades
Seed of decades
