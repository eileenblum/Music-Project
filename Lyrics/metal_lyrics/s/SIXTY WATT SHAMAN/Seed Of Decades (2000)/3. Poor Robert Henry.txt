My illusion, dashed to pieces
My collision, damn the sun
I counted all my blessings
And the damage of that sum

Your life, numbed and drunken
My strength, a voice inside
Ain't it funny how things worked out
My life began the day you died
Poor Robert Henry

Poor Robert Henry
Drinkin' broke apart our lives
Lost you from last year and more
Poor Robert Henry
Drinkin' blotted out your mind
Blotted out your mind

Your sky, always falling
Like you from barroom chairs
I didn't want to hate you
But your abuse was hard to bear

Your life, numbed and drunken
My strength, a voice inside
Ain't it funny how things worked out
My life began the day you died
Poor Robert Henry

Poor Robert Henry
Drinkin' broke apart our lives
Lost you from last year and more
Poor Robert Henry
Drinkin' blotted out your mind
Blotted out your mind
Drinkin' blotted out your mind
Drinkin' blotted out your mind
Drinkin' blotted out your mind
Blotted out your mind

I'll go on
Livin' in all my desperation
Now you're gone
I'll go on
Livin' in all my desperation
Now you're gone
Desperation

I'll go on
Livin' in all my desperation
Now you're gone
I'll go on
Livin' in all my desperation
Now you're gone
Desperation

Poor Robert Henry
Poor Robert Henry
Poor Robert Henry
Poor Robert Henry...
