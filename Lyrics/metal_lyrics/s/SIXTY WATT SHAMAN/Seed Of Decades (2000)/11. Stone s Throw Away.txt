Black light and break dust
Mingle in the air
Far out on a country road
Ships are everywhere
Now I scream
A wicked dream
How is this occasion
I am given to the sky tonight
Visitation

Caged up, then tied down
To the silver table
I would move if I could
If only I was able
For what need
You take my seed
I'm violated
Taken off a country road tonight
Visitation

Take me away

I have seen them
Telepathic night-time visions
I have seen them
Telepathic night-time visions
Yeah

Above the Earth, the atmosphere
Has gone to sleep tonight
We awake in fields to find our soul
Revealed beneath the lights
The lights
It's a visitation

It's a visitation

I have seen them
Telepathic night-time visions
I have seen them
Telepathic night-time visions

Visitation
