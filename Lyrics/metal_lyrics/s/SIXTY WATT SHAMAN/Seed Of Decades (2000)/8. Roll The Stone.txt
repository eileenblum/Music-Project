Wake up in the morning
See the sunrise from my bed
Shake dreams from my hair
Rub my eyes and rise again
Stumble to the bathroom
See the face of my old friend
Bathe myself for a new day
A new day

And every year I make it
Is a triumph of my own
And every chance I've taken
I found the strength to hold
And when my soul is naked
I know I'm not alone
And every day I waken
I roll the stone

Step out on the porch
Got the papers in my hand
Roll the stone into a better place
A better place
Drift myself above the treeline
See the distant mountain stand
Say my prayers again
Say my prayers again

And every year I make it
Is a triumph of my own
And every chance I've taken
I found the strength to hold
And when my soul is naked
I know I'm not alone
And every day I waken
And every year I make it
Is a triumph of my own
And every chance I've taken
I found the strength to hold
And when my soul is naked
I know I'm not alone
And every day I waken
I roll the stone

And every year I make it
Is a triumph of my own
And every chance I've taken
I found the strength to hold
And when my soul is naked
I know I'm not alone
And every day I waken
I roll the stone
