Alright

I've been down on the wrong side of town
And I'm never gonna do it again
I've been down on the wrong side of town
And I'm never gonna do it again

I've been down, down, down
I've been down, down, down
I've been down, down, down
And I'll do it again

I've been down, down, down
I've been down, down, down
I've been down, down, down
And I'll do it again
I wanna do it again

I've been down, down, down
I've been down, down, down
I've been down, down, down
And I'll do it again

I've been down on the wrong side of town
And I'm never gonna do it again
I've been down on the wrong side of town
And I'm never gonna do it again

I've been down, down, down
I've been down, down, down
I've been down, down, down
And I'll do it again

I've been down
I've been down
I've been down, down, down
I've been down, down, down
I've been down, down, down
I've been down, down, down
I've been down, down, down
I've been down, down, down
And I'll do it again

Down, down, down

Got any more beer?
