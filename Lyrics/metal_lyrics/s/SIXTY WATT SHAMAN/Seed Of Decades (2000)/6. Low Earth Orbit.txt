Out of low Earth gravity
We made our way to the tranquil sea
To strike our camps
Beside the ruined spires

Kicking dust from a weightless bed
Extracting frozen polar caps
Distant, distant
The life we left behind

And we ignite every night
When we ascend the spire
To get higher

Sweet sunshine on celestial vines
Come and solarize this sky
Novel eyes
Looking back on Earth

And we ignite every night
When we ascend the spire
To get higher
From here it looks so different
From here it looks alright
From here it looks so different
From here it looks so fine

And we ignite every night
When we ascend the spire
To get higher
From here it looks so different
From here it looks alright
From here it looks so different
From here it looks so fine
