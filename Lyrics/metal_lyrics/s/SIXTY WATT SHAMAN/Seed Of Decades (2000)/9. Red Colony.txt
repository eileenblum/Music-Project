I spent time on the mountain
Brought blood up from the hills
Wrought iron and stone made company of me
Taught me the way of the lone
Ten thousand years of exile
From the breast of my motherland
Please Mosigh, send spacecraft again
To carry us back to our home

Great sun bleed your breath on my neck
While I strangle the vagrant old soul I reject
Embracing my steps toward the valley's stream
A place for your landing
Erected in symbols that cry to the sky
Stars mark the pathway
Red sand, cold burn
On forgotten Martian Earth

Old fathers, come save me
Your ships sailed here before
Pyramids and temples call to your angels
And long for your return
This red colony left here
Silenced from mother tongue
Don't leave us like you did Egypt
Craving escape from this world

Red colony
Red colony
Red colony
Red colony
Red colony...
