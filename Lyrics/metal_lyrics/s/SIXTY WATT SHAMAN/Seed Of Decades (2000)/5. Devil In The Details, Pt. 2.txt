We brought the substance
To ease uneasy minds
Waste not, you'll want some more
Before too short a time

And I will be there inside of you
We'll wash ourselves divine
Because in the end, we realize
We know not, we know not what we find

Don't know where to stop begin
Fill the tanks with the fuel of my sin
We've got to keep the engine humming

Don't know where to stop begin
Fill the tanks with the fuel of my sin
We've got to keep the machine moving
Keep that machine moving

Don't know where to stop begin
Fill the tanks with the fuel of my sin
We've got to keep the engine humming

Don't know where to stop begin
Fill the tanks with the fuel of my sin
We've got to keep the machine moving
Keep that machine moving
Keep that machine moving
