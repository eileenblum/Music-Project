One good leg and a five in a shoe
Gonna make me cross that line
Cars pass by in front of me
But they cannot break my stride
She got sheen and lean
And she got mean
She don't waste my time
Got one good leg and a bottle of booze
And five to one is fine... alright...
One good leg and hands to use
You'll come if I just try
Give me what I want from you
And I promise not to die
She got cream and scream
And she got steam
She likes the way I ride
Got one good leg and a bottle of booze
And five to one is fine... alright...
Don't you want to want me
You don't have to lie
It's alright to want me
We can make the backbone slide
