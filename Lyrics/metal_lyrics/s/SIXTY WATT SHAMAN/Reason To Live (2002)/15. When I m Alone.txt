When I'm alone
I think of you
When I'm alone
I know the truth
When I'm alone
I drink to you
When I'm alone
I find the truth
When I'm alone, I get stoned
And I dream of coming home
And I know where I belong
When I'm alone
It cuts to the bone
I think of the times
And I'm suddenly thrown
When I'm alone
It's so fucking hard
