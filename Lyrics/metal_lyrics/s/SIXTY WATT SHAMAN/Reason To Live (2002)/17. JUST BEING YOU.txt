[Hidden track]

I always dreamed that I would be somebody else,
Never dreamed I'd be you,
I'd always dreamed that I would be somebody else,
And what a nightmare to find out that I was you.

I'm doing all those crooked things you've done for years,
I smoke the grass and I drink the booze,
I'm doing all those crooked things you've done for years,
And I shed no tears
Just being you... just being you...

I never knew that I could be somebody else,
Until I found out I was you,
I never knew that I could be somebody else,
Until I found out I was being (fucking...?) you.
I'd hopes of being all the best a man could be
I sleep all day and I sing the blues,
I'd hopes of being all the best a man could be,
But that's not me
Just being you... just being you...

And now I wish that I could be somebody else,
Because I can't stand being you,
And now I guess I'll have to go on as myself,
And just be happy, that I'm fucking you.
Never thought I could be this kind of man,
But what else could I do?
Never thought that I would be this kind of man
But now I am
Just being you... just being you...
