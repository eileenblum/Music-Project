I got cornbread
In my gunny sack
My cornbread isn't done too well
I got a mind
To drink me a tumbler
Barkeep another one from the well
I got a sixgun
With my saddlebags
My sixgun is a-ready to roll
I done some jobs
And I'll rob a bank, well,
I'll rob a man when I damn sure will
I got an evil secret
Five years on the run
Soons I sees that I gotta hand in
I'm stealin the horse that you rode in on
I got a sixgun
With my saddlebags
My sixgun is a-ready to roll
I done some jobs
And I'll rob a bank, well,
I'll rob a man when I damn sure will
I got an evil secret
Five years on the run
Soons I sees that I gotta hand in
I'm stealin the horse that you rode in on
