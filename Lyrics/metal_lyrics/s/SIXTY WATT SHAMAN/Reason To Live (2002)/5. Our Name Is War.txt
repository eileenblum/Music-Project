Evil seeds
From your lairs where you ward
Disseminating on a bleak swollen world
Deviant breed
Economic control
But, have we mentioned the rebellion is born
Steeped in greed
Reinforce the control
Replacing freedom with confusion and woe
Wounding, bleed
The herd of all they should know
Oh Lord
World is torn
We gotta warn
Our Name is War
Empires fall in the midst of the dream
Pale black wisdom puts the thread in the seam
Brave men live who bring the death to the kings
Bone of contention
