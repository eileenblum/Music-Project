Wretched red tooth and the claw
The tables stick to the floor
Dirty flies and stale tobacco
And the price of my soul
So fuck it all what's in store
No remedy for the poor
Fill my glass
Against these ruins
My fragments are shorn
My lord...
Now pick me up should I fall
Careful I might spend it all
The bar is tapped into poison
For a fix and a brawl
So keep 'em coming I call
Beer is blood
Pour it all
Turn up that goddamned music
Till they show me the door
My lord...
Line 'em up
This ain't just pissin in the wind
A sty will blind you in the end
Believe there's wisdom in my plan
Another round...
My ruin
