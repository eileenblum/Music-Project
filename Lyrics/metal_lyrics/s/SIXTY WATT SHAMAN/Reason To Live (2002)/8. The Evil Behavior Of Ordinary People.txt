If it bleeds it dies, it's said
I may be crazy if I am.
And if a vitrified can realize
Than that's just what I am.
A glass jaw breaks
While bellies ache
And talk is cheaper when
Loose lips bleed
The flame of kings
So secrets never end
So, feed the beast that always needs;
It's hard to swallow sand
Of the hourglass.
What comes to pass.
And the hunger never ends.
The fires burn and liars learn
The art of encryption
We come from mud
And dragon's blood
And teeth for talisman
Lies
Hard to swallow,
I am learning
Evil in the mouth
... tastes like burning
Symbol
Slight of hand,
Tables turning,
Evil in the mouth
... tastes like burning
Truth. Sacred, not for men.
Please use whispers near the thieves
Posture of fire when you can
Till scorched earth, cleanes,
Can be retrieved
These things I have not said
Must be allowed to speak...
