Yesterday's gone
When the morning comes
Keeping strong
Everything you taught me
Now I belong
In the valley of the sun
When the morning comes
--I belong...
And now I belong
In the valley of the sun
When the morning comes
I will hold on to my seasons
But then again I let 'em go
Can't you see on the horizon
What light breaks when it comes
