Just a change of mind away
Waiting on the sun all day
Hands can bring about this change
Why'd we ever come this way?
Born into a masquerade
Working towards a shallow grave
Blood and fear, an endless race
Just to be mindless slave
I passed the harbinger
The reaper's call in tow
I labored through the harvest
To walk this long hard road
Looking for a destiny
Can you feel it gathering?
Welling up inside of me
Chakra to enlightening
Fighting for the light I seek
Challenge that will set me free
God is out there on the street
Go to him, you come to me
I've climbed these hills before
I've voiced a sad hello
I've heard the echo return
Down this long hard road
I passed the harbinger
I've rode with death in tow
I labored through the harvest
To walk this long hard road
What if wanting wouldn't
Wait to be
Darkness coming over
You and me
Shadows shatter twilight
Lingering
Sun set moon light crimson
Killing me
I passed the harbinger
I've rode with death in tow
I labored through the harvest
To walk this long hard road
I've climbed these hills before
I've voiced a sad hello
I've heard the echo return
Down this long hard road
