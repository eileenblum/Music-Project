I want to breathe again
What was once mine is stolen
I need to breathe again
My lungs are swollen
We wash the mentioning
We see doors open
We cleanse the mental limb
A sign unfolding
We reach the reckoning
And find we're chosen
Embrace the sickening
Find progress frozen
I want to breathe again
These lines unspoken
I need to breathe again
The bells are tolling
