All things come to pass
History, wash over me
Will you look inside
Will you know the truth
Will you find the place
Will you need the proof
Will you pray for me
Will you call my name
Will you understand
Watch this come to pass...
All things come to pass
History, wash over me
Will you look inside
Will you know the truth
Will you find the place
Will you need the proof
Will you pray for me
Will you call my name
Will you understand
Watch this come to pass
All things come to pass
History, wash over me
History, wash over me...
