I've been away
Gone an eternity
But I'm on my own
Left the keys to the house
By the back door
In an old clay jar
These are my last minutes
On a long distance call
Hungry and tired
But I know...
I know that it won't be long
There's been miles and towns
In a dirty van
Livin' on the road
Been feedin myself
On a dollar bill
Sleepin on a stranger's floor
These are my last minutes
On a long distance call
Hungry and tired
But I know...
I know that it won't be long
