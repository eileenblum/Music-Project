Posture son
Delay faces twirl
Show nerve
Show bliss
A daring young mind
To me
That frightened son of yours
What does he do?

I've got the nerve you'll see

Skeletal excuse for a body
Who do you scare?
Delay bodies blend
Much obliged
But there are too few
Set adrift for the blissful memory

I've got the nerve you'll see

Blend faces spawned
I've got the nerve you'll see
A daring young is still a label

Posture son
Delay faces twirl
Show nerve
Show bliss
A daring young mind to me
That frightened son of yours
What does he do?

I've got the nerve you'll see
