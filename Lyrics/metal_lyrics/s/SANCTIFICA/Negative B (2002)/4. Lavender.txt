Lavender
Returns to my consciousness by stealth
The smell that lured me astray
The paleness of my body
Embraces that warmth
That new warmth, from a distant sun

Behind those gates there's no one to tell
My invisible trail
The cleansing sleep is yet to come

It's staring right back at me
The oceans in my eyes lie still

Innocence
Silenced

Deceived
Cannot grasp what has been poured into me
As they watch me on that screen
As they lure my lips to taste that kiss
I see love in you my sweet
I see love through you

Silenced

Lavender
Filters through me as I recall
Alienation, indifference

This fate that has been laid upon me
I pray for stamina, for guidance
I pray for you my sweet
Am I one of the beloved
The wanted, the rejected
The cynics, the pure:

The beggars are the threats
We'll suffer our demands
Not yet will the slaves of passion and hunger be set free

As the sun awakes to meet its successor
This work of art, this portrait
Of what cannot be imagined
Will fade away
Lavender

...returns to my consciousness by stealth
