We'll seize this moment to salute you

Raiders come to sign the last of my gifts
I give to thee with honour:
What was given yesterday
Spirals down into oblivion

This will be no more you see
I give to thee with joy: and all of that
What was taken yesterday
Not yet beyond remedy

My gift a capital offence
The eclipse of beasts and ghosts

Raiding beasts come to sign the last of my gifts
Put us all at witness stand

Fear is gone
Hope is gone
That rugged surface greets my cheek
Again
