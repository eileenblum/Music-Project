Welcome to the fall my friend
sit down by the fire
a seething mass of men you are
united by a thought
a wish

Apart from me you saw it coming
as the first night repelled its dawn
smelled the roses that were painted for me

I let them lie, let them tell me what to see

You're so scarce so hard to find
summer shows no grudge against you
summer sits here raining through the day

You let them lie, let them tell us what to believe

Stares that label you
enables you to hum along
summer sits here raining
in your shed in my shed
we gather behind our labels
and summer sits there raining through the day
