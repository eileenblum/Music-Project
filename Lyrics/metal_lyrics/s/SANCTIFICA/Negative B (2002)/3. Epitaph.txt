Await my breath
The colours blend to extract
Nutrition
From black and white

And off we go
Into the colour saturated part of you
Count me in
The fraud you're planning

Now the peasant lies still
For he knows the lot
Knows why and when and whom to blame

Set the controls for pleasant dreams
Speak the liars tongue
To wake the ancient gods

Set the controls for higher grounds
Trust me to fetter my thoughts
Count me in

That epitaph
Met my eye through the wilderness
Now the crescent lies still
For it covers the lot

Sweet saturation
When colours leave no space to fill
I dare you, count me in
Count me in the fraud you're planning

That epitaph
Met my eye through the wilderness
As a monument of that fraud
Colours leave the spaces in shades of grey
And those salty tastes
That labels the dissidents

Morning mist
One freezing night awaits your death
Salty taste
Lures that child to lick
That child lies still for it knows the lot

Final solution for the colourless
And I'm off
I'll count you all in

That epitaph
One freezing night awaits your death
Colours spawned by dust
Recall the saltier taste of hate
