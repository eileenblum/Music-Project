[Lyrics by Hubertus]

I walk on a path of desolation where
screams and tears has a sound of bitterness.
O almighty, why can't i see the darkness that
blinds my view.

Lost in an empty essence where darkness
reign night and day. My yearning to a life of
victory drowns in grief and misery.

Why shall my flesh be consumed of this lust
of evil that perverts the creation of God? The
seduces that blackens my heart makes my
soul to tear apart.

Like the dew of the morning delivers the cold
shape of night. As rays of hope brings a
dawn of freedom. Emperor of universe
release my bounds and set me free by the
blood of Christ.
