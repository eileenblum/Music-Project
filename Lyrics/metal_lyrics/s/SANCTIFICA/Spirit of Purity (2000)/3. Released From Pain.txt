[Lyrics by Samuel Johansson]

Allene, jag vandrar igenom mÃ¶rkom dal.
Evinnerligen, jag fÃ¶rnimmen mitt hjÃ¤rtas
svÃ¥ra kval. Jag Ã¤ro omsluten av idel dÃ¶d och
sorgtyngd vÃ¥nda.

Alone, I wander through this dark valley.
Eternally, I feel the pain of my heart. I am
embraced by sheer death and agony
weighed down by grief.

Within despair i will remain, until the casket
becomes my bed. This dark embrace of
grief, entices me with chains of red. But
listen, hear the cries of another man in pain.
Blood as red as the blood dripping from my chains.

Behold, a lamb, nailed to a cross, filled with
the sins of mankind. But still his tears are
shining of hope, his death is not his end.
Arisen from hades, satan enslaved, the dusk
turned to dawn. Take his hand, reveal his
gift, do not fear the death of mourn.

Released by God I am, within his almighty
strength I stand.
