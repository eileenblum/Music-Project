[Lyrics by Hubertus]

Like an endless sound you whisper. Like
burning fire you walk through water. Where
water is calm there is my yearning to appeal
you. If danger lie in wait at night i will not
fear my destiny because you surround me
with courage of victory.

Shadows embrace the sorrows of pain.
The dawn reveal the brew of life. Spirit of purity,
my soul you shield.

O you mighty spirit. Before time you were
created. From the father you have arised,
Your greatness no one can conquer. O you
mighty spirit. Before time you were created.
You are an essence of power, the timeless
universe you embrace.

The demons of darkness cannot fight him.
His power is eternal. As a wind he liberates,
liberates the curse of hell. The messenger of
purity you are, like a flame of fire you fill my
soul. So fill my soul with purity, purity by the
blood of Christ.
