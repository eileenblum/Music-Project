[Lyrics by Hubertus]

Cold winds are blowing in the forest of the
north. The night is black, like an essence of
the calm. Embrace my soul, eternal Master.

The stars are your creation. And the
moonlight that shine in my face. Blessed is
the nature that gives me strength.

Autumn leaves falls like a preparation for the
winter. The trees are quiet in its rest. The
quilt of the winter covers the landscape as
your power embrace our hearts.

Even if the cold tries to drown me you will
still remain.
