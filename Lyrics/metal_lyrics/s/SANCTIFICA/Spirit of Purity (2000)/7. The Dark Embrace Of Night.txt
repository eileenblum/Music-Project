[Lyrics by Jonathan]

"Will it find it's way back or will it never again
shine?" one may wonder when the sun
disappears and the dark night embraces the land.

But after each night comes the dawn and the
sun again gives life to the forest.

As the nocturnal activities of the forest may
frighten the sons of Adam, the creatures of
the nocturnal forest is to worship the son of God.

And the flower in it's magnificence silently
worship the Creator.

The creator of all, the spirit of our lives, the
deliverer of mankind; I welcome thee deep
into the heart of mine.
