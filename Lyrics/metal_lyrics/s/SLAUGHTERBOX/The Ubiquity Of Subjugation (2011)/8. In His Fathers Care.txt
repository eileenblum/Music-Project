Eaten away by bitter sweet memories of degradations past.
From remorse to regret further into depths of sorrow and mourning.
I'll never forget what it felt like pulling the knife out of my back the look
in your eyes the smile on your face the way it felt as you twisted the blade.
What was once now shall cease to be.
As my eyes thy heart bleeds with every beatvv
And I weep.
Like a judas etu brute etu my dearest friend.
Hate is not an accurate description of what I felt for you.
How I loathed you and I damned you.
I'd like to hope you thought of me the way I'll always think of you.
I never got the chance to say I'm sorry friend.
