Omnipresence of subservience, defeated, conquered, under control.
Any being considered less than human, falls under tyrannical dominion.
Ubiquitous subjugation born from fear and hatred.
What hath man wrought? Discarded by god, relentlessly pernicous.
We have not fallen from grace, it has crumbled around us, never to be restored.

Born of ignorance, forged from unintelligence, no mercy for innocence, get down
there with the rest....
Get down there with the rest of the pigs.
The ubiquity of subjugation.
