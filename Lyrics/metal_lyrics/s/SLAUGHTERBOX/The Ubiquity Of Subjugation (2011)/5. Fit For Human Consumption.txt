Consumption is the explanation for basting in their defecation, covered with
malignant infection prepared for your mastication.
Food borne pathogens attach to the innards of your abdomen vero toxins shiga
toxins attack the lining of your stomach hyperurecemia seizures anemia
hemorrhage exsanguinate.
Eat up. Cyclospora cayetanensis, cryptosporidium parvum, listeria monocytogens,
yet a little inhumanity makes you sick.
In this age where man must reap what he's sewn wretched consumption of seeds
grown long ago,
lye now in this bed that we've made like pigs in our own shit this is what
we've created.
