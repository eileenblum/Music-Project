What? Oh no! How could this have happened?
A pro-abortion candidate planet that slipped through the cracks of natural selection.
Slipped through the cracks of natural selection.
Shat on this Earth, billions dispersed, conditioned coerced, poised for failure.
Striving for acceptance, begging for forgiveness, fear instilled, promising something more than emptiness.
Empty!
Lost! 
Been lead astray by hope, aspirations crushed by truth.
Nowhere left to go, still oblivious, nor do we seek the answers.
It must be nice to feel you know the truth.
Slaves! 
Are we going to let this happen to us?
Intelligence suppressed, ignorance rewarded, abhorrence atrophied, arrogance aborted.
Low is this life that we've lead, it's sad to know how it's going to end.
Please End.

DAMNED!
DEPRAVED!
HOPELESS!
FORSAKEN!
SHIT BIRTHED!
