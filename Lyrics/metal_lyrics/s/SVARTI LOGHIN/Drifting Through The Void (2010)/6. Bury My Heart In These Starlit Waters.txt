Dark was the night
Cold was the day
All of these years have passed now
But my soul regrets
When I gaze upon the plateau of hope
Is this all there is?
Or are we to weak to understand?

A velvet dream fills the void between us and infinity
And the calm streams of the soul is the only way
Therefore I lost my soul that day
Lost it to the stars
