I stopped being myself long ago
I didn't have anything else to give
There is no reason to raise questions
No reason to bother in opening my eyes

All I know is to look for the future haven
Turning to the elements and drift away

Being the son of everything and nothing
Just take me to where I belong
Somewhere beyond the end of the world
Let me drift away...
