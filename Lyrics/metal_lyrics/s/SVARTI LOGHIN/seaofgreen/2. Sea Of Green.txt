Sprung from the source
They stand above everyone's value
Above everyone's mind

Bitter winds is blowing silently
Enlightening my heart

Opening my mind

I know my faith
So I stand my ground

In silence

Underneath the sea of green
Is where you will find me

In silence

Times are changing
And they will return to the sea

This mighty grave
