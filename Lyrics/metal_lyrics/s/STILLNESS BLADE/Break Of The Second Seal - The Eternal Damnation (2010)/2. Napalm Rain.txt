Earth, air, fire
...it caught fire my breath
Air, fire, water
...bury the tomb of humanity

Fire, water, Earth
...hide my corpse
Earth, water, air
...it caught fire my breath

Napalm Rain, Napalm Rain, Napalm Rain

Earth, air, fire
...wrap the immaterial obscure palace
Air, fire, water
...floods its deformed rooms
Fire, water, Earth
...collapse under its rubble

Earth, water, Earth
...wrap the immaterial obscure palace

Napalm Rain, Napalm Rain, Napalm Rain

Bloody hymns will stun my mind
Bloody hymns will live on thirst of destruction

A funeral without corpse will start soon
A purify exterminate will finished soon

The air will burns like a fire without end
The dust will make visible the human desperation
