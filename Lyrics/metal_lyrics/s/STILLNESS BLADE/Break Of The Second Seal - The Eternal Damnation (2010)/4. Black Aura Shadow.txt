I don't fear my aura...
The black trail thats come before me...
The burnt soil buried around me...

I don't fear the dark omens...
Projected in blind eyes...

The flaming blades coming my soul...

Violation...
Of bloody flock in my mind

Desecration...
In the temple of dying spirit

I don't fear my aura...
The black trail thats come before me...
The burnt soil buried around me...

I don't fear the dark omens...
Projected in blind eyes...

The flaming blades coming my soul...

Violation...
Of bloody flock in my mind

Desecration...
In the temple of dying spirit

Strangulation...
Of crawling illusion in the fire

I'll be own shadow
I'll be shadow of my mind
