Mutilator
...release the blood of my corpse
Violator
...rip the flesh of my God
Annihilator
...darken the darkness of my fall
Ancient traitor
...break the spiral of my stock

I'll see the tears of the ripper
And the ascension of seven blades

Desecrator
... destroy the source of my light
Blind creator
...burn the perception of my sight
Immolator
...don't give back vain my sacrifice

I'll see the tears of the ripper
And the ascension of seven blades
