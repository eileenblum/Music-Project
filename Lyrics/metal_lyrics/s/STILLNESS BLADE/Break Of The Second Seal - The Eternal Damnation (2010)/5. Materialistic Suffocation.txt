I had to obscure the shadow of my velleity
I had to satisfy the false thirst of vacuity
Distorted visions,
Lacerating afflictions breed vortex under my skin
Enveloping perversion, mortifying compulsion carve my bones

I'm the darned reflection of my existence
The death-rattle, the agony of my beginning
I'll imprison your slavery
I'll segregate your torture

I've been buried with a robe of bare life
I was buried by heavy obstruction
Materialistic Suffocation annihilate every breath
Mortal Loneliness emit empty glances

I slowly felt the forsaking of my spirit
The division, the separation from my defenceless body
I felt my interior conflict die

Dominating by instinct of not dying
Suffocated by death life
