The spiral violence will never end
Its end will be in the era that won't come
The roots of hate cannot eradicated from this arid Earth

I will be the killer of this victims
I will be the slave maker of this slave

Stock of vengeance immortality of hate
Stock of vengeance implacability of fate
Stock of vengeance instinct of the beast
Stock of vengeance i'll kill now!
Now!
Now!
I'll kill now!

Vengeance is done
My eyes are empty
Vengeance is done
My thirst was appeased

Not forever

I can still die
I can still the cut of my blade
I can feel the implacability of breath
I can damp it once more

Not forever
