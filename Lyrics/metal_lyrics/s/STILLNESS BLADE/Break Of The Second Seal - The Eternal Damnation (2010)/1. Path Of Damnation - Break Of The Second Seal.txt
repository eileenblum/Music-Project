The eternal damnation opens in front of my remains
The exhumation of my past nightmares grazed my blade
The cry and despair of my victims art inside of me

Arrived at my second end
I saw my sadness arising and dying
I felt the vigour of my blade
...its perfection is almost complete
...will my path have a destination?

Break of the second seal

My mind become ethereal
It wrap the darkness of my essence

I knew the omen of pain and mutilation
And i wanted to face them with vehemence
I knew the fateful effects
And i wanted to face them with pain

Aware that they will take me to death
Aware that they will give me new power
