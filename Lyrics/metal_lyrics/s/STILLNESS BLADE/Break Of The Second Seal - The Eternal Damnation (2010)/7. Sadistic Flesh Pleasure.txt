The deceitful reflection of matter
Causes primordial reaction
That infects my mind
My blades reflect the darkens of my eyes

I will bleed
Of sadistic flesh pleasure

Pierce of timeless light bleed in the darkness
Your skin trembles in the terror of living
Fear vanishes before its birth
Inauspicious instinct of dying

I will bleed
Of sadistic flesh pleasure
