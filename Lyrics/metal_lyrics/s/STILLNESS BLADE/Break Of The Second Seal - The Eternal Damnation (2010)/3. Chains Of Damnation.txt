The ancient bridge was suspended
In the emptiness of my existence
Decadence was master of its slaves
The echo of its damned would make possible its crossing my fall

Chain of damnation. The shadow without face will see through my eyes
Chain of damnation. The shadow without face will kill through my hands

In the gallery of pain was enlightened by dead torches
Burnt by fire of the hidden truth
Hanging on fragile wall of the no-being
The tortured of the damned was before my vitreous eyes

Chain of damnation. The shadow without face will see through my eyes
Chain of damnation. The shadow without face will kill through my hands
