A dark rain will wash my hands...
Cutting frozen flames will purify my sorrow...
An icy wind will blow on a never lit stake...
The decapitated corpses of my dreams will float in a winter lake...
Burn your sadistic sorrow
burn the visions of horror
Burn the fired arrow
Burn, burn, burn!
Burn the dark purification
Burn the symbolic contradictions
Burn the blade of perdition
Burn, burn, burn!
Your crying will dry my tears...
Your blood will wash my face...
Dark purification
Symbolic contradiction
