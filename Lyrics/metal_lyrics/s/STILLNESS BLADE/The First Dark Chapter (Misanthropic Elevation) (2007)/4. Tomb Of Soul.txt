I had to go in where I didn't want to...
I knew that i had found ancient wounds...
Visions of experienced nightmares...
Visions of nightmares to live...
His temple was suspended in the darkness of truth...
It was immersed in a ocean of tears to pour out...
Surrounded by the ruins of my lost soul...
My weapon was with me...
They wouldn't have betrayed me...
I knew that I had to kill if I wanted to live...
I knew that I had to die with him...
Few moments...
Few steps...
My last words lay in silent lands...
The brutality of the first blow resounded long...
Its echo become more and more deafening...
More and more unceasing...
Trapped in the vanishing of the ruins...
He faded through the cold wall of unconscious...
