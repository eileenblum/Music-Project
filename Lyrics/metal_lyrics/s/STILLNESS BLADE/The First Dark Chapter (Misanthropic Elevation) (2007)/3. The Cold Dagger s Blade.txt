My steps were heared scarecely
An unreal atmosphere of torpor wrapped in sad decadence around...
Gashes of mad light bled from the sky...
You were here...
In a cave of my unconscious...
In my depths...
Like a snake in the bosom ready to strew its venom
Stare my threatening eyes...
Kill me before I'll kill you...
I heared your screams because of my presence...
I saw your eyes that died away because of my first lethal stab...

I felt the blade that sink into your white flesh...
A moment...
And nothing more...
I only had the scar of the first stab stab I gave you...
The more violent...
The lethal one...
