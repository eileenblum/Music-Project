Few uneven steps divided me from your death...
Few nightmares remained to you to live...
Few troubled breaths...
There was a pungent smell of burnt blood...
The vicious signs of time were seen on the blackened walls...
The dim light of illusion was seen...
it seemed to be in your tomb...
Slowly that door opened...
A blind glance...
The blinding light of the darkness illuminated my last death...
A rain of fire beat time of your end...
I heared your deaf lament...
I saw my shadow in the dark...
A moment...
And then nothing more...
The grim execution is done...
