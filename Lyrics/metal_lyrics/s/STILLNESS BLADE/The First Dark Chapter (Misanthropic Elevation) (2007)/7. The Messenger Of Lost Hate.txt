Your death will darken my mind...
My darkness will dig up into your fate...
My carnage will march like an aimlessly slow procession...
Your blood in my eyes...
My hate on your face...
Your skin will be a mournful cloth...
That will adorn the doors of my Hell...
The messenger of hate will break my chains...
The messenger of hate will call my name...
The messenger of hate will see your pain...
The messenger of hate will live again...
Old bloody blades...
Instincts of repressed hate lacerate my mind...
Tongues of fire will recite your elegy...
