A storm has crushed my favourite star
The light to help my body grow
Possibly maybe, here we are
It's just a waste of time
Come and go
The mirrors make my body flat
And hide the plasters on my arms
A speck of hope's been left ashore
But no one cares
Cares at all

In the world of convenient spells
My morning feet are numb
The question so incomplete
The answer never to be found
The shutter so low, we're bound
To come up the way we are
The question so incomplete
The answer never to be found

So I'm back home
To give back all I've got
And dust the surface clean
And feel

The plasma in my blood
The salt in my sweat
The cross-section of my veins
The water in my breath
The universe at large
Sifting through my hands
Ever so intangible
But never so immense
So I give my loudest cry
Before my voice turns dead
Hoping to reverse the tide
In the face of nothingness

Holy water drunk in cups
Is filling up your lungs
A day that never comes again
A story told thousand times
It's fine, it's good enough
I'll rest till I'm alive
A day that never comes again
A story told thousand times

So I'm back home
To give back all I've got
And dust the surface clean
And get my senses back
So I'm back home
Reading all my life
Inked on paperstrips
For the last time

The plasma in my blood
The salt in my sweat
The cross-section of my veins
The water in my breath
The universe at large
Sifting through my hands
Ever so intangible
But never so immense
So I give my loudest cry
Before my voice turns dead
Hoping to reverse the tide
In the face of nothingness
