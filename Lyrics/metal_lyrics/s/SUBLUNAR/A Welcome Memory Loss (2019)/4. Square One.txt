Sit down and stand up
Clear off, come right back
Rotate, disintegrate
I'm only killing time
Take bows, don't panic
Take shapes, be nothing
Be next to nothing
A point between my eyes

Now that you've finally had enough
You see how lucky you are
It's me before your very eyes
Still there's nothing to change at all
Now that you've finally had enough
You see I'm on your side
It's me before your very eyes
Still there's nothing to change at all

You see the others would come and go
But I'm set in my ways
See there's nothing to change at all
This game's called square number one

Be there
Only when I'm somewhere else
Be there
Only when I'm somewhere else

The very moment I give you back
All that is not down
Uneasy objects start floating
Like a swarm of dead flies
Keep drilling your holes
Get ready to get my pain
It's a simple game
The very moment I give you back
All that is not down
Uneasy objects start floating
Like a swarm of dead flies
Keep drilling your holes
Get ready to get my pain
It's a simple game

Now that you've finally had enough
You see how lucky you are
It's me before your very eyes
Still there's nothing to change at all
Now that you've finally had enough
You see I'm on your side
It's me before your very eyes
Still there's nothing
To change

Is it that you've finally had enough?
There's no one on your side
There's nothing in your very eyes
See there's nothing
