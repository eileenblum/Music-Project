I think I guess I can say
They like to come out at night
Trying to get away
Moving slowly
To reach the points
I've left behind

I guess I can say
They cross the borderlines
I've drawn to see if there's
Anything beyond
And above
And inside it all

Oh what a nice pair we are
The force that moves their legs
Keeps my mind in one place
Just to hold on

But when there's no one around
It might get strange at times
You might feel out of place
My lights are on

My precious I
The reason left outside
This time we meet in another place
