All the moments, all the whiles
All the fingerprints of mine
Crowded streets and empty souls
Burn to nothing, nothing as we go
Nothing as we go

Make sure to count your regrets before it's over
And bury them in a place you'll never find
Just let it thrive on your own neglect
Make sure to count your regrets before it's over
And bury them in the centre of the sun
Just let it thrive on your own neglect

With every step, every breath
I feel we're getting closer
Close your eyes, let it go above the sky
With every step, every breath
A million moments older

So lost for words we are
Just like newborns
Brought to life
That's not dying away
So lost we are
Just like newborns
Under the sun
That's not fading away

That's not dying away
That's not fading away
