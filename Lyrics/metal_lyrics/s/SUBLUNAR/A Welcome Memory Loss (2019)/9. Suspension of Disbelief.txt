Heavy raindrops climbing up your face
Making shelters, taking shapes
That's why, stop waiting for something else
Has the never-ending started yet?
Does it always start with such a gentle storm?

It's just like being here and now
But never making it on time
You had a yellow dress
But the film was black and white
I've found a proper way to hide
Carving stone, collecting flies
That happened to fossilize
In my pockets

Moving backwards, spinning out of time
Getting older, drawing perfect lines
Moving backwards, drawing perfect lines

It's more than a sum of accidents
Hiding behind the stars
That's measuring the space between us
Wherever you are
A moment here
A day afar
A year inside a star
Outside the ways that feed us

It's more than a sum of accidents
Hiding behind the stars
That's measuring the space between us
Wherever you are

Now that the lights are out
The world stops being what it seems
There's only a part of me waiting
Now that the noise is down
I'll touch you with my phantom limbs
There's only a part of me waiting
Of all different shapes and sounds
Moments worth spending here
There's only a part of me
Waiting for the sign

Drifting back and forth
Knowing what's left to see
A while that should last forever
Suspending all my disbelief
So far
Suspending all forever and ever

It's more than a sum of accidents
Hiding behind the stars
That's measuring the space between us
Wherever you are
A moment here
A day afar
A year inside a star
Outside the ways that feed us

Now
We're looking at places and times
Moments inside a star
Outside the ways that feed us
Now

Is this all that we can see?
Short-sighted from fear of getting blind?
My hand outside all my beliefs
I'll keep waiting for the sign
