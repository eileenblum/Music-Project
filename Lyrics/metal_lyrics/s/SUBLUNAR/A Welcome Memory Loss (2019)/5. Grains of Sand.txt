It seems okay now
But it's easier when you breathe
One-way footprints and a bottle of sand
One book too many
On a line that you may reach
But it moves only further as you float around

Back down
I'm under your feet
So many stones the time has thrown
End up in the sea

We live and die with the shadows we can't outrun
No matter the light
And the very same gravity that scatters the sand
Holds us down

It's all about
The count of breaths you take
The less I speak the more you understand
We come and we go
But what's there in between?
Man-made structures
As big as the grains of sand

Back down
I'm under your feet
So many stones the time has thrown
End up in the sea

We live and die with the shadows we can't outrun
No matter the light
And the very same gravity that scatters the sand
Holds us down
