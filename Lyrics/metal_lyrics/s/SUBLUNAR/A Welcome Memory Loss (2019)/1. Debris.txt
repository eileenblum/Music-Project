Just in time
The sun is piercing through the dust
Just in time
We're raising our sketchy heads
Delivered we are from a game gone too far
Seems the jaws of death have missed us
Delivered we are to a world lost in time
Can anyone believe us?

Broken spirals
Scattered stones
We are

My arms turn into branches
Awaiting the rapture
We're back at the drawing board
Just in time

Surrounded by the fallen stars
That need to burn inside like cigarettes
In an ashtray full of dead galaxies
We are made again

We're numbers to count
We're stories to write
We're future celebrations
Words of consolation
Before the guilt goes down

We're shivering sounds
We're scary red eyes
We're broken limbs in piles
Awaiting to be photographed
When the light is fine

We're people undone
Frozen with harm
Afraid to come to terms
With our human nature

It's just one
Of many times

Surrounded by the fallen stars
That need to burn inside like cigarettes
In an ashtray full of dead galaxies
We are made again
