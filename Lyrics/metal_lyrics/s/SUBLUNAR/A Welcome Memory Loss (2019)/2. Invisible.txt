There's nothing
There's only eyes
A taste of frozen air in my mouth
It's a delusion, they would say
Just like an urge to stay alive
Alive
Inside
Alive
Inside
Slightly more than alive

Escape, escape, escape
Tread on beasts lying around
Fuel the tanks
You know there's nothing to it
It's your bad time
Kiss your wife goodbye
Drown your screams
Like a dog in a bag
You know there's nothing to it
You know there's nothing to it

I've nearly forgotten
I've nearly wiped it out
But there's too many ways
Just too many ways inside
I've nearly forgotten
I've nearly wiped it out
But there's too many ways
Too many ways inside

No matter what you see
There's not much to see
No matter what you feel
There's not much to feel
In this uninhabited, cosy hell on earth
No matter how hard you may try
Try to take a grip and put your legs down
And run, run away from this make-believe
No matter what you fake
What smiles you give
What lies you use to put
Your demons at ease
In this uninhabited, cosy hell on earth
No matter how hard you may try
Try to take a grip and put your legs down
And run, run away
Keep looking around
You know
The boy is trapped inside
The boy is trapped inside
Again

All the scratches on my skin
Invisible in the morning light
All the scratches on my skin
Invisible in the morning light

I've nearly forgotten
I've nearly wiped it out
But there's too many ways
Just too many ways inside
I've nearly forgotten
I've nearly wiped it out
But there's too many ways
Too many ways inside

Now that you've lost your mind
We give you back your heart
Your heart
It's useless and that's because
It's way too small to fall
Apart
