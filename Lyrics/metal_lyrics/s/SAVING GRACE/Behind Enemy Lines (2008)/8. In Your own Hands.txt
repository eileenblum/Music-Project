GO!

You were told there was no hope for you and you believed it. 
Raped day after day by a world that knows little of.. 
Compassion!
And you conceived its bastard child. 
Now inside the sickness grows. 
It swells and pressure builds. 

You know it hurts you but you canât quite figure out why. 
So instinctively you drown it in poison. 
You know it hurts you but you canât quite figure out why. 
So instinctively you drown it in poison. 

Poison!
Poison!
Poison!
Poison!
Poison!


But that glamour is temporary and eventually the cracks begin to show. You
scramble grabbing whatever you can find and hold onto it until it breaks
for the pressure. This cycle repeats.

Until thereâs nothing left 
Until thereâs nothing left 
Nothing!

And you seem to think that thereâs but one way out. 
Such a shame. Such a waste of life. 
Such a selfish choice. 
Such a selfish choice.
Choice!

UH! 
In your own hands!
My heart bleeds for your soul!
