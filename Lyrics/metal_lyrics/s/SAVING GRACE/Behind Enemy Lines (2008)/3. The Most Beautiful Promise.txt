...and then He swore to me. 
Swear did He silently.
Heâd stay right next to me. 
Said Heâd be there for me. 
And in my times of need
He said Heâd give to me strength I need to survive
The bloodshed of this life.
And the wounds I sustained would heal and leave no scars.
He said Heâd die for me. 
Heâd die a thousand times.
This brought tears to my eyes and I fell to my knees.
I opened up my heart and let his life consume me. Consumed... My heart... and healed... My wounds.

And after a lifetime of lies and broken promises,
his words made my mind swell with love and passion.
Into your arms I commit my life.
Into your will I commit myself.
Into your hands I commit my heart.
Into your hands I commit my spirit.

I gave my life, my Life, my Heart, my Soul!!!
And without parting my lips I gave him thanks.
I gave him praise.
