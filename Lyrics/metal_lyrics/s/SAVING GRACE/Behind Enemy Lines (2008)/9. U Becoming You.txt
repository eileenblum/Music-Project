OH!
In a time where fitting in is such 
a crucial part of existence, 
self compromise hits an all time high 
and self-respect, self-awareness has died. 
WHY? 

Where has integrity gone? 
Where has acceptance gone? 
Is individuality not beautiful? 
Where has integrity gone? 
Where has acceptance gone? 
Is individuality not beautiful? 

Just another pretty face in the heaving sea of bodies.

Not you.
Not even human. 
Just another mindless drone walking the path of submission. 
Your eyes glazed over and your mind numbed by years of sedation.
Submission! 
Submission! 
Submission! 
Submission! 

I know that somewhere...
Down there beneath 
that facade lies...
a neglected human being. 
Just begging to see 
the light of day. 
Just begging to know... 
the love of self. 
SELF!

Bring that beautiful complexity to the world. 
Give it a new lease on life. 
Burn the guidelines. 
Burn the pin-ups. 
Be yourself. Not what they want you to be. 
Ignore their expectations. 
Ignore the lies they tell you. 
Ignore your self-rejection. 
Ignore THEM!

Be yourself. Not what they want you to be. 
Be who you are. Know who you are. 
Be yourself. Not what they want you to be. 
Be who you are. Know who you are.

OH!
Just be yourself.
Just be yourself.
Just be yourself.
OH!

BREAK IT DOWN!
