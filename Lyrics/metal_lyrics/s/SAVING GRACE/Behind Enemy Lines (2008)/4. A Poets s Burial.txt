To write another song of heartbreak. To lose the will to live again. 
To write another song of hatred. To feel the urge to kill again. 
To feel the urge to kill again.
To feel the urge to KILL!

To write another song of heartbreak. To lose the will to live again. 
To write another song of hatred. To feel the urge to kill again. 
Oooohhhhh!

The same old tired numbness. 
Nothing different but the pen. 
Iâm bleeding nonetheless. 
I donât think Iâll try again. 
Instead Iâll draw close to Christ 
and prove myself to Him. 
Instead Iâll draw close to Christ 
and prove myself to Him.
OOOHHH!

I find me all by myself again 
and see that I am free from within.
I find me all by myself again 
and see that I am free from within.
I find me all by myself again 
and see that I am free from within.
I find me all by myself again 
and see that I am FREE!

WWWWWWEEEEEEE!
OH!

The urge to seek the comfort of another 
angelâs arms has died with everything else... 
The urge to seek the comfort of another 
angelâs arms has died with everything else... 

Iâm... Dead... To You... 

Solitude is safety in my own arms.
Solitude is safety in my own arms.
Solitude is safety in my own arms.
Solitude is safety in my own arms.
