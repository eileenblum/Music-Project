Raaaaaawwww
hhhhhhooooooo
Eeeeaaaaarah
Yyyeeeeeaaaaaaahhhh
Wwwwwwweeeeeeeee

For so long 
For so long 
For so long... 

For so long Iâve heard, so many people crying out to God for His
forgiveness. 
They raise their eyes towards His heaven and cry out from blackened sinful
lives. 
When His mercy helps them live.
They turn their backs and fall into the world. 
They turn their backs and fall into the world.

Reeehoo!

You take for granted 
the gift of Jesusâ passion 
knowing your life 
can be redeemed, 
but bear in mind that His return is near 
and if your life is anchored by your vices 
you will be shunned 
for you walked the widest path. 
The widest path.
The widest path.
The widest path.
The widest path.

Stand ready 
Upheld by Christ 
Living the life 
He made you to. 
And praise His name 
For He is Holy... Holy!
