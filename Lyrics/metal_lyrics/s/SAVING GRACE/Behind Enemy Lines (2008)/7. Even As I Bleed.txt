With tattered wrists! 
Yeeeooooohhh!
and shattered fists I raise my hands to skies above. 
On bloody knees I bow before my Lord. 
With tattered wrists and shattered fists I raise my hands above. 
On bloody knees I pray. 
I PRAY!

On bloody knees 
I bow before my Lord. 
On bloody knees 
I bow before my Lord. 
I pray!
I PRAY!

Even as I bleed. 
Reho!
Praise be to you my God. 
Even as I bleed. 
Thanks given to You Jesus. 
Even as I bleed. 
Praise be to you my God. 
Even as I bleed. 
Thanks given to You

For without struggle there would be no progress. 
And without nightfall the sunâs beautyâd be mundane. 
Glory! 
To You! 
My merciful Father! 
I love You. 
WeeeeYOU!
Iâm! Humbled! Yet! Again!
