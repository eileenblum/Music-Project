Devoid of malicious intent.
Just a mindless wanderer.
Pushed and pulled by criminal impulses.
Pulsating.
Compulsive.
An endless cycle of peaks and troughs.
A perpetual rise and fall of weakness and will.
Is this an illness, or nothing more than a product of the human condition?
A chasing of the wind.
Just pissing in the wind.
Bathed in the stench of repeated offenses.
Enrobed with the reek of decay.
A convict digging up the corpses of past victims to kill again.
Is this an illness, or nothing more than a product of the human condition?
A chasing of the wind.
Just pissing in the wind.
From blood to dust and back again.
Stabbing, strangling putrefying flesh.
The recidivist retracing steps erring both left and right.
Yet there's no end in sight.
Deeper.
Further.
To the very heart of darkness.
Deeper.
Further.
Deeper.
Further.
Deeper.
Further.
And further still.
