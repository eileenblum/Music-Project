[Song commentary (by guitarist Vasely Sapunov):
This is the oldest Saving Grace song that we still play live and we wanted to
use it for the opening track of the new album. It is undoubtedly our best known
song and its lyrics sum up everything that we stand for as a band, as brothers
and as a ministry. By the redemption of the cross we have been ressurected from
the dead and have received new life through the blood that was spilled. To stay
forever true to our faith, our family and our friendship is the very essence of
everything Saving Grace is about.]
