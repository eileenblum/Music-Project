I would have you know that if it were denounce or die you would be staring into dead eyes.
I would like to know, do you carry the weight of truth and conviction
or am I speaking to a room pulsating with the motions of fermenting flesh?

or am I speaking to a room pulsating with the motions of fermenting flesh?

Would you really go to any length?
Would you fight âtil the death?
Would you really go to any length?
Would you fight âtil the death?
âtil the death?
âtil the death?

Would you really go to any length?
Would you fight âtil the death?
Would you really go to any length?
Would you fight âtil the death?

Well, either way,
I hope you realize I would happily âwasteâ my breath on you
âtil the day I die to help you see the Truth.
âTil the day I die.
Until the day I die.

Iâm not afraid of change.
My name is revolution.
Iâm not afraid of change.
My name is revolution.

My name is revolution.
My name is revolution.

Iâm not afraid of change.
Iâm not afraid of change.
Iâm not afraid of change.
Iâm not afraid.

[Song commentary (by vocalist Nicholas Tautuhi):
This song is my way of questioning those who say that they would stop at
nothing to uphold their beliefs. However, I also kind of wrote it from the
perspective of Jesus speaking to me. Are we really as zealous as we claim?
That is for us to examine within ourselves.]
