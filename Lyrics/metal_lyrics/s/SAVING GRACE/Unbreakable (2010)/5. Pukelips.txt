[feat. guest vocals by Adam McFarlane of Corpse Feast]OOOHHH!
Oooooooohh.
OH!

An ever present question
(question)
Haunting every single thought
(every single thought)
That passes through my head
(through my head).
Inner monologue bombarded
With a slew of degradation and abuse seemingly mocking my every attempt to
Grab at any form of stability.
Yeah.
Stability.

The voice of unreason screaming in my ear,
Throwing reality out the window
And removing any sense of balance.
And removing any sense of balance.

RRRRRRAAAWWW.

And all this through a crack in my shell.
And all this through a crack in my shell.
And all this through a crack in my shell.

OO-OO-OO-OOHHHRRR
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRAH!

The vastness of the enemyâs army is both fear and awe-inspiring.
(RRRRRRRR)
The vastness of the enemyâs army is both fear and awe-inspiring.
Awe-inspiring.
Awe-inspiring,

"But a mere whisper has been more than enough to crush me."

Woooorrrrds...
Get out of my head.
Just get it out of my head.
Get out of my head.

OOOOOOOHHHHHHH!!!!
Oh Jesus please!!!!
(Jesus please!!!!)
Still this vomit lathered tongue!!!!
OH!
