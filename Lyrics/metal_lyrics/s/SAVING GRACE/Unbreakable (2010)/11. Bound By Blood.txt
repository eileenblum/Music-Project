[feat. guest vocals by Levi Robinson of Bloodsport]EEEERRRAH
GO!

OH!

This is a blood-bound brotherhood,
nothing can take this away.
No hate can come between us,
no distance can separate.

Through the years Iâm looking back without an ounce of regret.
These times we shared together
I know weâll never forget.

No regrets.
Never look back.
In His Name.
Bound by Blood.
Bound by Blood!!

[Nick:] "From the East Coast of New Zealand to South Australia and
worldwide, flying this banner high, proclaiming a message of hope to a dying world."

[Levi:] "You think weâre gonna sit back and watch this world burn in hell?
No way... itâs time to step up or step outâ the way!"

Break it down!!!
Drop it!
Bound! By! Blood!
Bound by Blood!
