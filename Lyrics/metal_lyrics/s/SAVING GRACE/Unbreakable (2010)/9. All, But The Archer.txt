OH!
RRROOOOHHHH.
REH!
OOOOOOHHHHH!

All I ever wanted was a father to love and edify me.
All I ever wanted was a lasting pure embrace,
but your attempt was self-serving and sick.
What father would ever do this to his own child?
to his own child?
to his own child?

Let me fall victim to perversion
justice died the moment you stepped in.
Let me fall victim to perversion
justice died the moment you stepped in.
Trust betrayed and innocence taken
silence bought your justification.
Trust betrayed and innocence taken
silence bought your justification.

You put a price on...
You put a price on...
PURITY!
scared it into secrecy,
but dormant bodies burst.

"But the scratches on the surface hinted at something terrible beneath"
waiting to bleed out a secret death
a truth untold,
but once itâs spilled the battle is over.
Internal bleeding ebbs long after wounds have healed.
No part of me remains untainted by your hands.
The guilt is on your head
the blood is on your hands.
The guilt is on your head.
your head.

OOOHHH!

the blood is on your hands.
the blood is on your hands.
the blood is on your hands.

This war is won.
This war is won.
This war is won.
This war is won.
This war is won.
This war is won.
This war is won.
This war is won.
This war is won.
This war is won.
This war is won.
This war is won.
This war is won.
This war is won.
This war is won.

[Song commentary (by vocalist Nicholas Tautuhi):
As a child I was sexually abused for many years by a close family friend,
who tried to justify his actions by telling me that he wanted to give me what
I had been missing out on by not having my father around. Every day of my life I
can feel the effects of what I lived through and every day is a battle to fight.
Some days itâs easy and some days I go to sleep with the taste of defeat
on my tongue, but at the end of it all the victory is in shedding light on this
struggle. Itâs in darkness that our inner demons thrive, so donât give darkness
a chance to take hold of your hurts... give them to Jesus.]
