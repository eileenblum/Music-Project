OOOOHHHH!
OH!

Bury me.
in JimÃ©nez. 
Bury me.
(bury me.)

Take me home at the end of the day. 
Give me a humble burial in an unmarked grave. 

Take me back... 
to where the water is pure and the air is clear.
water is pure and the air is clear.

Oooouuuu!
OOOOOHHHHH!

You carry me with promises to a place where beauty breaks your heart. 
To where beauty breaks your heart.
beauty breaks your heart.

"To Where I can lay at Your feet forever. To Where I can bask in Your
majesty for eternity. In Jesus Name. Amen..."
