From the moment that you were born
youâve been shown aesthetic perfection
and told that youâre nothing if not that,
force-fed vanity by the media and its lies.
And its lies.
Eeehu!

So you hide your heart and you hide your face,
buried beneath six feet of mascara,
building your life on one single layer of foundation.

And all the while just beyond your sight
The face of love;
compassion,
stares from behind the mirror.
He weeps, for you are ashamed of the beauty He sees deeper,
even deeper.
The only beauty that matters.
Eeehooo!

For everything of this world will pass away is subject to decay.

Look further.
Even further.
Even further.

"And you too will see what His eyes rest upon, itâs you and that beauty is indescribable.'

Let it breathe.
Let it breathe.
Let it breathe.
Let it breathe.
Let it breathe.
Go...
Let it breathe.
Let it breathe.
Let it breathe.

[Song commentary (by vocalist Nicholas Tautuhi):
From birth we are bombarded with images of unattainable beauty and material
excess. This song is about the true beauty that goes beyond the depth of skin.
The beauty that all too often goes unnoticed for many of us. We are all
individuals, created by God. Beauty is more than how we look. Itâs who we
naturally are in Christ Jesus.]
