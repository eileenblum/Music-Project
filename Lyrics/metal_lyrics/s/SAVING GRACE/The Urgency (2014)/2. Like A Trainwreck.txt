With your sights aimed squarely at your two left feet, 
and your feet headed straight for your mouth; 
you run in ever decreasing circles of self defeat. 
Intent on keeping your eyes glazed over 
and your head filled with lies. 
The truth is screaming at you,
The truth is screaming at you,

but the hedonistic hum of the west is all-consuming. 
It matches your frequency with the brownest of notes 
while you medicate and masticate your way through life. 

Beauty passes beneath your nose unnoticed, 
for the beholders eyes 
were torn from their sockets long ago. 

Beauty passes beneath your nose unnoticed, 
for the beholders eyes 
were torn from their sockets long ago. 
EGH!

On your quest for self-gratification, 
I've seen you turn a blind eye 
and drown out the voice of truth so many times, 
that I wonder if you even really want to be saved. 

But I can't leave you here to die. 
I can't just leave you here to bleed. 
But I can't leave you here to die. 
I can't just leave you here to bleed. 

Here to bleed. 
Here to die.
Here to bleed. 
Here to die.

With your sights aimed squarely at your two left feet, 
and your feet headed straight for your mouth; 
you run in ever decreasing circles of self defeat. 
Intent on keeping your eyes glazed over 
and your head filled with lies. 
The truth is screaming at you,
The truth is screaming at you,
