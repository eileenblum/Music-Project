I exist to bring you despair. I exist to usher your destruction. Total chaos. Total obliteration. Your very demise is on the tip of my tongue. No more lies. No more deceit. I have come to end it all. I have arrived. I have awakened. Years of sorrow and years of torture culminating in this very instance. A lesson lived, seven lessons learned. Behind your disguise there is no surprise. Can you see them? The horde of soldiers shrouded in light? Standing by my side? As we sing a new song with fire in our eyes, this ritual is taking place.
Behold your downfall. Welcome to your deathbed. Behead the serpent. Dig the grave. Bury the body. Walk away. Walk away smiling...
