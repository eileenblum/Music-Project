GO!!

Fight. 
Fight 'til the death! 
Fight. 
Fight.
Fight until our dying breath. 
We are the broken. 
We are the lost. 
We are the ones who'll take this back 
at all costs. 

This generation is alive. 
The sleepless ones who'll raise the dead. 
Because we have nothing to lose. 
You can't hang this death over our heads. 
No!

This is the time for which we're born, 
and there's no way to slow us down. 
This is the anthem of the underground. 

We are the broken. 
We are the lost. 
We are the ones who'll take this back 
at all costs. 
We are the faithful. 
We are the few. 
We are the chosen. 
We are the true.

This generation is alive. 
The sleepless ones who'll raise the dead. 
Because we have nothing to lose. 
You can't hang this death over our heads. 
No!

This is the time for which we're born, 
and there's no way to slow us down. 
This is the anthem of the underground.
