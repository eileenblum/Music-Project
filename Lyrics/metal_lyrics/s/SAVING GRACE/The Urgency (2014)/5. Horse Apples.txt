This is the age of vanity. 
A self-obsessed generation publicly masturbating. 
Readily yielding privacy 
and vomiting their ignorance into an ocean of foolishness. 
and vomiting their ignorance into an ocean of foolishness.

Self portrait... 
Self portrait...
Hand painted with diarrhea.
Tunnel vision staring straight into a mirror.
Tunnel vision staring straight into a grave. 

Breeding apathy and what seems like disbelief 
in the existence of the world outside of your experience. 
This is the age of vanity. 
Nothing is sacred except for self. 

I refuse. 
I lift my body from the floor. 
I shall participate no more, 
I 'm gouging out my minds eye 
with bloody fingers 
of severed hands. 
Wash me clean and keep me free. 
Wash me clean and keep me free. 

"But this needy heart and these treacherous eyes would sooner have me drowning" than facing the sun.
Keep me free.
