Clinging to the edge of my sanity
and I'm about to lose my grip.
3285 taking it's toll on my life.
Who is this man that stares back from the mirror?
Is this beast my own creation?
As the final grain of sand drops free from the hourglass, I've lost sight. I'm looking away.

I'm not the same.
I'm not the boy who wrote those words.
Can't shake the shame;
with my head in my hands is there anything worse than forgetting your ways?
Than forgetting those nights and forgetting those days?
I am to blame.
I'm looking away.
I'm walking away.
Tearing from the inside.
Hearing voices,
seeing signs.
Trying to find the answers.
Losing ground, I've lost my mind.

I could never imagine;
I could never perceive how this ending would come.
Always figured that something;
always figured that someone would tell me I'm done,
but the fighting has killed me,
and the fire within me has stifled and died.
Now they're looking within me
and they're looking right through me,
exposing this lie.

Tearing from the inside.
Hearing voices,
seeing signs.
Trying to find the answers.
Losing ground, I've lost my mind.
I've become the downside.
Everything we once built I've destroyed.
I am one with suicide...
stumbling through this endless void.

I am the apocalypse!
I am the apocalypse!
Betrayal on my lips.

"Walking alone through this abyss,
my purpose remains clear... "

Freedom.
I walk free.
Walking free from the chains of a dead man.
I walk free.
Walking free from the chains of a dead man.
I walk free.
Walking free from the chains of a dead man.
I walk free.
I walk free from these chains.
