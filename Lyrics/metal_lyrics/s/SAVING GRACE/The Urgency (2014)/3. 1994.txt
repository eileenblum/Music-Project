Don't you get comfortable. 
We are not a part of your furniture. 
We do not belong. 
We are here to burn your world to the ground. 
To the Ground 
EGH!

There is no corner to put us into. 
There is no wool over my eyes. 
There is no corner to put us into. 
There is no wool over my eyes.
I perceive... 
I perceive... 

You can't poison the cure. 
What we carry crushes kingdoms. 
We will usher in a new age of truth. 
Make no mistake... 
The past is gone. 
We will scream into the ears of those who sleep. 
We carry your awakening 
We carry your awakening 
and we are far beyond driven. 
Far Beyond Driven!!!
