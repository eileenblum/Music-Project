I will burn...
I will burn...

Through the world's affliction
Through the earth's decay and rot You reign
Victor to the victims
Life and restoration in Your name
Mercy for resistance
Even through my sin, Your grace abounds
Even in the distance
I hear Your voice and it sets my soul ablaze, my soul ablaze

Ignite the fire and I will burn

In these days of trial
In the years of turmoil You bring peace
In this life of anguish
The throne of grace and mercy brings release
Forever learning
Let Your Spirit guide me in this place
Hidden lamps are burning
It's time to let them shine and set this world ablaze

For the One who died for me: a liar
For the One who died for me: a thief
For the One who's eyes are filled with fire
For my loving Saviour I will burn

I will burn...
For the One who died for me: a liar
For the One who died for me: a thief
For the One who's eyes are filled with fire
For my loving Saviour I will burn

I will burn!
I will burn...
I will burn!
I will burn!

For the One who set me free I'll burn
For the One who died for me I'll burn
