OH!!!

Spilled into recollections 
encompassed by sound. 
Cut off... 
cut off and waiting. 
cut off and waiting.

12 Years spent unconscious to my own grief. 
Pushed forward and owned by my own weaknesses. 
"I've done everything I can to push this away and forget it ever happened."

I've put these things below me. 
Attempting to heal through silence. 
I've put these things below me. 
Attempting to heal through silence.
Or something. 
Or nothing. 
???
Or whatever. 

Warm blood. 
Deep breaths. 
You gave this noise to me. 
Warm blood. 
Deep breaths. 
You gave this noise to me. 
Warm blood. 
Deep breaths. 
You gave this noise to me. 
Warm blood. 
Deep breaths. 
You gave this noise to me. 

And I never thanked you because I never knew. 
And I never once said what you meant. 
Or that I loved you. 
That I miss you. 
And I never thanked you. 
I never thanked you, 

but I wish you were here to see this. 
But I wish you were here with me.
but I wish you were here to see this. 
But I wish you were here with me.
