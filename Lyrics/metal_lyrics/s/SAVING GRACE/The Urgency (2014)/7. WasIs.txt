[feat. Tommy Green of Sleeping Giant (Vox)]Can you make it through the night?
Is prayer even answered?
Have you ever spoken?
Will I break and drink this light?
Is there any mercy...
mercy for me?

The clock is broken.
Your eyes are swollen.
The price that I've paid.
The price.
Embraced the downfall.
Embraced the downfall.
Embraced the downfall.

Can I be the temple king?
Divine as my dreams
or is this my nightmare?
Will this ruin everything?
My life as a vapor.
Captive and dark.

Such thick oppression.
Dope sick repression.
The price that I'll pay.
The price...

So this is an overthrow.
Now this is my overthrow.
Overthrow.
Overthrow.
