Yeeeeeaaaaahh

You destroyers of Grace. 
Destroyers of Salvation. 
That which is wrought by faith; 
can never be gained by works. 
The flesh you lean upon 
decays beneath you; 
It rots in your hands. 
It rots in your hands.

It's acrid stench 
flows into your heart. 
It's acrid stench 
flows into your heart.


Defecate your Bristol doctrine from your rectal tongue into porcelain. 
Defecate your Bristol doctrine from your rectal tongue into your cathedral. 
You mutilators. 
You deceivers. 

You've rendered the blood spilled 
pointless by taking up a burden long thrown to the ground. 
You have made them 
twice the sons of Hell; 
a burden only one man could ever bear.

Defecate your Bristol doctrine from your rectal tongue into porcelain. 
Defecate your Bristol doctrine from your rectal tongue into your cathedral. 
You mutilators. 
You deceivers.

If this is your way then Christ shall profit you nothing. 
If this is your way then walk it alone.
walk it alone.
walk it alone.
walk it alone.

walk it alone.
Alone.
All alone
Alone.
All alone
Alone.
All alone
