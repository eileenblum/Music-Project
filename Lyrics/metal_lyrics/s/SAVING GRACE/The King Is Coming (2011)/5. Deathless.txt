Blech!
"He is the living one who was dead, behold He is now alive forever and ever and holds the keys to death and Hades."
Yeeaaahhh!
YEEEAAAHHH!!
Royal blood flowed through His veins even as He was a beaten man spat on in shame.
Tied to the cross by mockers who scoffed, beaten, bruised, pulverized with no help from aloft.
And though His body was buried once they pulled Him from the tree, there was no grave on earth that could hold His majesty.
Death was rendered powerless and all hell fears His name...
Deathless Conqueror,
King of Kings riding through a field of bloodâ¦
"He that is dead is free from sin and if we be dead with Christ then we shall also live with Him.
Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more; death has no more dominion over Him."

UH!

King of Kings and Lord of Lords,
Eyes of fire...
Deathless Conqueror!
King of Kings and Lord of Lords,
with justice waging war
He's the Deathless Conqueror!

King of Kings and Lord of Lords,
Faithful and True...
Deathless Conqueror!
King of Kings and Lord of Lords,
Word of Godâ¦
Deathless Conqueror!
King of Kings!

[Through His glorious resurrection, Christ conquered death once and for
all. He made it possible for us to live in eternal glory with Him through
the death of our flesh and through our new birth into the kingdom of
Heaven. He is the word of God, the faithful and true King of Kings and
Lord of Lords, Jesus Christ, the deathless conqueror.]
