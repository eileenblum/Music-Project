Flesh mingles with spirit and so begins the dilution.
The fatal compromise.
(The fatal compromise.)
Septic hypocrisy.
Muscles clench,
forcing vomit over the congregation's eager ears.
Catering to the carrionâ¦
rot permeates the living.
Deception devours selflessness
and the streets run red with the blood of the truth.
Walking hand in hand with the great masquerader,
wading knee deep in the blood of the truth.
Once could see, but now are blind.
Wading knee deep in the blood of the truth.
(The peoples need for God is intercepted by a watery imitation, serving
our carnal nature, justifying self gratification.)
Though the night is dark,
new light is yet to come.
Though you bend and break,
His strength is in your weakness.
And through the bloodiest trials,
new character is forged.
Though the war is won,
the battle rages...
ON!!!!
His kingdom
will be preached
and so will
His testimony.

The Gospel lives! [7x]

[We are all responsible for the preaching of the eternal gospel of the
Lord Jesus and to preach it accurately, but to blindly trust that every
teacher out there is preaching the true gospel would be foolish. Question
everything. Make sure it lines up with scripture and be willing to
biblically rebuke those who preach lies or share in their guilt. The truth
is within reach and willing to be found. Take the initiative; find it and
go forth in encouragement, speaking life-giving words of truth.]
