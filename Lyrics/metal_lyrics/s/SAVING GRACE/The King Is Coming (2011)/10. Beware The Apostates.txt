Prophecy fulfilled in creeping defilement. 
Condemned ones bring perversion and disgrace. 
Disgust, spitting in His face. 
Denial of the Father, 
denial of the Master. 
His grace and wrath, both equally righteous. 
Disloyal wings forever shackled in darkness.
Ruins in flames, 
immorality punished. 
The clock strikes the hour 
inflicting destruction.
Blasphemy of the glorious ones through transgression of flesh. 
Dreamers of dreams scorn and reject authority.
("Behold the Lord comes with ten thousands of His Holy Ones" Righteous
judgment poured out...words and deeds judged alike.)
"These are hidden reefs at your love feasts". 
Hiding, faceless, 
devoid of truth. 
âThey feast with you without fearâ. 
Fearless, soulless, 
shameless and sick 

shameless and sick
(liars)
shameless and sick 
Eternally black... 
As for you: 
be built upon the most holy faith. 
Let the mere scent of sin turn your face in disgrace.
Show the mercy you've been shown and to doubters show grace. 
Be the one who, through Christ, 
snatches souls from the flames.
Glory! 
Majesty! 
Dominion! 
Authority!

Glory! 
Majesty! 
Dominion! 
Authority!

[Jude: 1]
