Rrrrraaaaa!
Yeah!
...as in the days of old the Glory fills the temple of the Lord
We are your temple
We are your temple

This burning deep inside of my heart
These lips adorned with praise
My hands raised in worship lost
In the wonder of your ways

Come now and take your place Lord
Bring forth new winds of change
Set our lives ablaze with fire
Bring down your Heavenly rain

We are your temple...

Bring away the darkness of sin
Fill these hands with seeds of truth
Show the path and I will follow
Let your Spirit lead me through

This hunger taking over my life
This thirst for Heavenly ways
These eyes are filled with visions
This heart your dwelling place

Come reign here Holy Spirit
Bring forth a storm of change
Set our tongues ablaze with fire
Bring down your Heavenly Glory, Glory

You made these hands
Now take these hands
Lord fill these hands
Lord fill these hands with seeds of truth

Bring your fire down!
Glory
Fire
Power
Shekinah

[The Lord's manifest Glory is poured out as in the days of old each time
His people unite in Holiness and turn from their sin. Fill your mind and
heart with the word of God and fill your hands with seeds of His truth,
sowing the gospel of salvation across the earth as we are commissioned
to. The Holy Spirit lives and dwells with those who are dead to sin and
alive in Christ, pouring out unspeakable power and Holy Fire for the work
of God's kingdom.]
