The vision beheld is one of terror and of glory. 
And every knee bows and every tongue confesses. 
So do the mountains crumble into silent awe. 
Creations groaning stills... 
It gazes and as His brilliance pierces the dark, It flees. 
His presence overwhelms all. 
His majesty. 
(Oh, His glory. Hallelujah! )
(Hosannah!)
And as the sky rolls up and the stars begin to fall... 
as the valleys rise up and the high places bowâ¦ 
His people, with lifted eyes, raise hands 
and voices and we scream, we sing: 
The Kingâ¦ The King is coming! (The King is coming!)

[This is the moment that every follower of Christ has both dreaded and
anticipated for the past two thousand years. Jesus warned that He will
âcome like a thiefâ (Rev 16:15), thus we should be ready as were the five
wise virgins that He spoke of in Matthew 25 so that we are not told âI do
not know youâ and cast out into eternal darkness.]
