Rrreeehhh!
Yeyah!
A VOICE LIKE THUNDER SPOKE
"Come!" and one by dreadful one, 
the four riders arise 
each bearing his own disaster. 
Stephanos! 
The crown and the bow bent on bloody conquest 
taking the triumphs allowed 
by the Hand of He in power. 
OOOHHHH!
The taker and his sword; 
tranquility slaughtered. 
The corpses pile high neath his unbloodied blade. 
Folding history upon the present, 
unleashing our lust for battle...
upon ourselves. 
The hand and the scales renders the people 
incapable of filling their needs. 
Drowning in your oil and wineâ¦ 
and at the beckoning 
of the fourth creature, 
with Pestilence upon his back, 
the pale horse came forth 
and Hades followed in his wake. 
and HADES followed in his wake. 
They were given power over a fourth of the earth 
to kill by sword famine and plague, 
and by the beasts of the earth. 
Blech!
Here is the aftermathâ¦ 
each one begets the next. 
This is no trivial judgment. 
RRAAAWWW!
This the beginning of the end 
and thus 
the Great Tribulation has begun.
This the beginning of the end 
and thus 
the Great Tribulation has begun.
