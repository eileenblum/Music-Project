Like a root from dry ground. 
No majesty that pleased. 
No Desirable beauty. 
Despised and rejected. 
Acquainted...
with grief. 
Repressed!
Afflicted!
Silentâ¦ 
like a lamb led to slaughter.

[In the Old Testament scriptures the words of The Prophet Isaiah foretold
the very essence of Christâs future, His being and His purpose. As a Man
of Sorrows He would be scorned, rejected by His own people, sacrificed for
the sins of the world and in total humility and obedience He would walk to
His death, as a lamb to the slaughter. Pierced for our transgressions and
crushed for our iniquities, it is only by the wounds of Jesus Christ that
we are truly healed and set free.]
