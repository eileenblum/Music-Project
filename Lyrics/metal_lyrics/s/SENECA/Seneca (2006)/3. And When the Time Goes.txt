Words mean nothing
Stale air and a hollow heart, stale air and a hollow heart
Words so played out
I am the epitome of self wallowing and mire

Go search, go seek [x6]

Act like nothing is wrong, you know it tastes so good
I will stare at this forever, and I will bleed this forever

You can justify this if you wish, with nothing for words
I will blink you away. And you will never kiss such cold

If I wanted you killed, you'd be dead already [x3]
1, 2, 3, 4, I declare war
You'll never take me alive.
