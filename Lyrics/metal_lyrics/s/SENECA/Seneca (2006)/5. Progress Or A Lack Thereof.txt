For now, just for old times sake, I need you in my arms.
Now the victor is the victim, and failure takes it place.
Could this hierarchy ever fall.
Could this thirst be quenched.
My fingers cant move fast enough to cleanse me of my impurities.
Strong as death.
This is all going to end wrong.
You're ripping out the heart of the earth.
It's not the end of the universe just because your life is over.
You will give in.
You're consuming the innocent and this will end you.
I hate these streets of evolution where there is no progression
