You need to be more careful with your hands.
These are the days when skies resume, their old deceptive reasonings of June.
A blue and gold mistake.
Now thirteen scars mark your wrist.
Lets focus on the theory.
Magnetic pulses will release you ending the depression.
Is it everything you thought it would be.
But you have the freedom to fail.
This is the myth of ending.
Is it everything you thought it would be baby?
