As she walked into the room, flashbacks are blinding.
Remembering the nights, acknowledging the days, I died for you.
No names will be protected, for there are no innocent.
Rise and shine.
You'll rise and you'll shine.
Beautiful, here is my new mindset.
Girl, boy, I have come for you.
There's no need for last words, just forget and move on.
Your face is full of lies.
