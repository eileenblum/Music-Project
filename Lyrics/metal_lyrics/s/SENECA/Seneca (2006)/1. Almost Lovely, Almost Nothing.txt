Myself disintegrated
Everyone disintegrated
Yet part of the scheme

How long must this exist, how long must it endure
How long must this exist, how long must it endure

It's nice to know,
It's nice to know there's still some debauchery going on
There's still some debauchery
Call it what you want, its your decision forget about music
Forget about words, this is fashion (fashion)
This is fashion (fashion)

Call it what you want, call if what you want

I hope everything this world holds for you
I hope it withers away into dust
And I hope everything this world holds for you, I hope it fades (it fades)
I will write you in one liners, I will trace you in one line phrases
