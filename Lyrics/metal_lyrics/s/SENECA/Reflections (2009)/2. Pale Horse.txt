In speaking with this mirror image in the picture frame
Your black and whites so remind of that pale horse
Father, I've fallen from grace
Your the only reason I have become
This martyr to all those left behind in your wake
As I come to bear the cross of all your burdens
What you destroyed was so much more than create
So I repent

I will turn blood into wine, and we will drink in remembrance of you
Our memories will fade in time, but the widow lives on alone

In speaking with this father figure in the picture frame
I wonder now if you are gone, or if you were ever
A fading shadow in the walls of our consciousness,
Only the consequence remains...
I will turn these memories to ashes and breathe them in for strength
You left me alone, in a world we didn't know, and now my mothers eyes roam, and my brothers abandoned
You left me alone, and my brothers abandoned

So I will turn these memories to ashes and breathe them in for strength
