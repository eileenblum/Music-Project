Here I sit alone
On the pointless throne
Hiding from the light
Shadows freeing none
I become undone
This life no longer fun
The poison bittersweet
It's all I need to taste
Believing it's the pain
You cannot go far
Carrying the weight of who you are
I have tried so long
To be a part of all that's going on
When the ceiling falls
Can't support the wall
You cry into the night
Laugh from all your fears
Crying you just might
Go black from lack of sight
Emptiness abounds
There's nowhere I can turn
I think I'm gonna drown
You cannot go far
Carrying the weight of who you are
I have tried so long
To be a part of all that's going on
Tragic as it seems
I've lost my only dream
Just as it had broke
My grip had gave its hold
All is gone I see
There's no one left but me
And I am not for long
You'll miss me when I'm gone
Sleep will last so long
You cannot go far
Carrying the weight of who you are
I have tried so long
To be a part of all that's going on
You cannot go far
Carrying the weight of who you are
I have tried so long
To be a part of all that's going on
Ohh....
