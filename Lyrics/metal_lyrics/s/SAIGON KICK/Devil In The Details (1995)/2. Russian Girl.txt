Russian girl you came to me
You are my whole entire world
You talked me down from high above
And suddenly took me by the hand
Russian girl, stay with me
You lay me down upon the sand
And sing a song into the night
Your eyes so green, I drink them in
And they fill my deepest need
Russian girl, stay with me
I donât mind if we donât speak a work
We donât have to talk about it anyway
I just want to be the only one
Let me stay awhile please
Let me stay awhile
Russian girl
You promised love and I fall down
Proposition me my girl
Stranger still, I canât resist
Youâre simply overtaken me
Russian girl
Stay with me
