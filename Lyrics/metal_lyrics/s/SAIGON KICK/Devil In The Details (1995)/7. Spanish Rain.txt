I recall the place, the way you move, your angel face
You came to rest your weary soul
spend some time and drink some whine
with me...
ah, me
we defined romance, they way we danced
your beauty stopped time
We spent a night in Spanish Rain
I felt no pain and you were mine
Soon came the sun
And you were gone without a trace
So alone inside my home without you
all mine
