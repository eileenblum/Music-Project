Victoria said she'd be better of dead than discovered
She hid in her room from the razor sharp words of the others
Where she'd gone wrong is she shot a good friend of her mother's
As quick as it seemed the results were extremely grotesque
Victoria knew that the end was coming soon
And she prayed for a soul saving saint
She knew all too well she'd soon be in a cell
For all of her last living days
Now she searched out a good place to dispose of the body
S narrow ravine with a deep running stream seemed just right
Victoria knew that the end was coming soon
And she prayed for a soul saving saint
She knew all too well she'd soon be in a cell
For all of her last living days
Victoria knew that the end was coming soon
Victoria wants to be just like you
Victoria sensed that the end was near
Victoria knew, Victoria knew
The body was found in the sound not too far from the boathouse
Tied to the corpse was a swatch from Victoria's dress
'Sad as it seems I'm not sorry' she gleamed from the chair
'I've not lost hope as I cope with my new lack of hair'
Victoria
