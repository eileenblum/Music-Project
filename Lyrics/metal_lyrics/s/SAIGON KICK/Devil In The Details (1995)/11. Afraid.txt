I was alive
Seven years ago
I never died
Let the spirit go
You took away
The things that I adore
And I won't let it stand in my way
And I won't let it stand in my way
You were the one
Made me afraid
I never lied
About the way I feel
I never said
Changed it all for you
You were the one
Made me afraid
In danger of a crime
So afraid
Of losing all I am
Keep my dream upon your case
Just like some teen that fell from grace
I stand ahead, you could fall down
It's hard to balance every ground
You were the one
Made me afraid
In danger of a crime
So afraid
Of losing all I am
Afraid
In danger of a crime
So afraid
Of losing all I am
