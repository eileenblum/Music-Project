I love my little baby
I'm gonna get so close to you
I'd walk a hundred thousand miles
Just to get your inner view
Well, my little darlin'
Oh, when I see you I get hot
I lay upon the red fire coals
Just to see how you got
Oh, well, my little darling
I wanna get so close to you
Well, my little baby
I'm wanna make my dreams come true
When I was a boy
I used to dream about you
You used to tease me
So I would really come [Incomprehensible]
Well, my little darlin'
I'm gonna get so close to you
Well, my little baby
I'm gonna make my dreams come true
When you're all alone
You know I'm not that hard to find
When I am in need, you are divine
As everybody know
Oh, beneath it there's a moon
Eyes often always left me
Feeling quite like the loon
Well, my little darlin'
I'm gonna get so close to you
Well, my little baby
I'm gonna make my dreams come true
When you're all alone
You know I'm not that hard to find
When I am in need, you are divine
When you're all alone
You know I'm not that hard to find
When I am in need, you are divine
Well, my little baby
I'm gonna get so close to you
I gotta be so close to you
I gotta be so close to you
Wanna be right next to you
I gotta be so close to you
Wanna be right next to you
Have to be right next to you
