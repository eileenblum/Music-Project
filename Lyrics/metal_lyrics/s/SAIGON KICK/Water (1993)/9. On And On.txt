Without love
The right would be wrong
Without you
My life an empty song
Within time
We will dance upon the ice
In the dawn
This could all be gone
Gotta get right back on time
Gotta stand straight up the line
Have to burn my heart complete
Gotta get fast upon my feet
Gotta act way beyond my means
Have to read the in-betweens
Gotta get back on my
Back on my feet again
On and on and on
It's gotta be love
It's gotta be love
Sweet love
In your eyes
A million brilliant lights
Shine on me
And lead to sleepless nights
Bring to me
The one I desire
I can't resist her
And soon begin to drown
