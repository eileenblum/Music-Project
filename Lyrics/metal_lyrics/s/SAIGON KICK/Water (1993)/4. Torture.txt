Freedom seems to haunt you
But the voice ain't that familiar
Action seems to call you
But you're feeling quite the same
Seasons from with torture
Yet your feet can't find the ground
Reeling from the pressure
And this isn't safer ground
You can't justify your shameless ways
Actions from the homeland
Does that mean the party's over?
Feelings not divided
And your shoes will hit the ground
Checking from the family
We're living without wisdom
Trying to gain an inch
On this southern [Incomprehensible] ground
You can't justify your shameless ways
Way to hard to see what's in yourself
You can't read the meaning in that soul, oh yeah
Living on the outskirts
Of the town in West Dakota
Trying to fix the barn
[Incomprehensible]
Somethin' is tryin' to [Incomprehensible] us
And they're hard to get away from
Got to beat your death
But we have to live this way
You can't justify your shameless
Way too hard to see what's in yourself
You can't read the meaning in that soul oh yeah
It's way too hard to see what's in yourself
You can't read the meaning in that soul oh yeah
