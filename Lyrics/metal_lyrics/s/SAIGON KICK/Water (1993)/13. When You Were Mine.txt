I never thought that life could be so unkind
Until I lost you
No more times by the lake in June
No more walks beneath the moon
When you were mine
There would be another day in my life
All this time the river flows to nowhere that I can't find
The leaves will change as time goes by and by
It's all the same to me
The wind will blow as if it knows the rhyme
Why not me?
When you were mine
There would be another day in my life
All this time the river flows to nowhere that I can't find
You were always there to be with me
And show me a kindness of a type
I grew so fond of receiving
Almost daily when you came
We talk for hours over things
We believe in caring for each other
Hand in hand through life before you left me
Standing all alone helpless without you
I never thought that life could be so unkind
Until I lost you
No more times by the lake in June
No more walks beneath the moon
When you were mine
There would be another day in my life
All this time the river flows to nowhere that I can't find
When you were mine
There would be another day in my life
All this time the river flows to nowhere that I can't find
When you were mine
There would be another day in my life
All this time the river flows to nowhere that I can't find
