I may not be the man I wanted to
I may not be the king of wit
I may not know the things you need to know
I might not measure up quite yet
I may not have the grace of Fred Astaire
I may not have the mind of Jung
I cannot buy the things you need to have
But there is something you can't forget
I love you
I love you
Through the fires
And all the hell
It's something I can't stop
I love you
It may not seem that I care enough
I may not take the time to say
You can't leave me standing here alone
Until you hear what I have to say
I love you
I love you
Through the fires
In all of hell
It's something I can't stop
I love you
