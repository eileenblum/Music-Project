You and me
You know we're never going to die
Right or wrong
It still won't mend a broken heart
And I don't mind
The colors in your hair
You don't see
The water dancing with the dead
Pick it up again
and realize
I'm never coming home
To lose it all again
Could capsize
My vessel on it's own
Off to be
The one think that I know I am
Stand Alone
Beyond the reach of helping hands
Pick me up again
and realize
I know not what I do
To lose it all again
Could capsize
My vessel on it's own
Stop me from drinking the water
In which I drown
Hold me in darkness
Beneath the water now
Out in the ocean
far from any land
Sail to emptiness
The water's on my hands
Pick me up again
And realize
I know not what I do
To lose it all again
Could capsize
My vessel on it's own
Only the ones in the water
Could be found
Hold me in the darkness
Beneath the water now
Take me up
To higher lands
To higher lands
I go
