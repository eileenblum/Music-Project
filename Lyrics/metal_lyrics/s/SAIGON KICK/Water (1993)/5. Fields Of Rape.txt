There is danger in the fields of rape
Not too far from where you walk
There is danger on the path you take
Too late, you've gone too far
There's meaning in these words of hate
Hidden, yet to find
There's children behind an iron gate
Hiding swollen eyes
Change these fields of rape
Wash them away like the morning rain on your face
We gotta change these fields of rape
Take me away from the burning pain of this place
There is hunting in the fields of rape
And we've become the game
There is running in the fields of rape
Abolish all mankind
There is crying on the African soil
And life is hard to keep
There is dying in a Bosnian town
A girl of just sixteen
Change these fields of rape
Wash them away like the morning rain on your face
We gotta change these fields of rape
Take me away from the burning pain of this place
There is danger in the fields of rape
Not too far from where you walk
There is danger on the path you take
Too late, you've gone too far
There's meaning in these words of hate
Hidden, yet to find
There's children behind an iron gate
Hiding swollen eyes
We gotta change these fields of rape
Wash them away like the morning rain on your face
We gotta change these fields of rape
Take me away from the burning pain of this place
We gotta change these fields of rape
Change these fields of rape
We gotta change these fields of rape
We gotta change these fields of rape
