Said she was a Sentimental Girl from France
Mother was the victim of a failed romance
When she went to call upon the boy next door
She was really horrified at what she saw
Said he was a Continental Man from Greece
Wasn't really sure what that meant but at least
Promised her the life of [dreams and a king?]
Wasn't too long before bells were to ring
Kid needs to look around for someone else
Kid needs to look around and around and around and around
So they lived their life upon a great big hill
Wasn't too long before blood was to spill
Hit him in the back with a tool from the shed
Now she's upset because she thinks he is dead
When she turned he rose above the hardwood floor
[...?]
He was right behind her and swinging a bat
Landed on her head with a soft wet smack
Kid needs to look around for someone else
Kid needs to look around and around and around and around
Kid needs to look around for someone else
Kid needs to look around and around and around and around and around and around
Hit her on the head with a bat
Hit her on the head with a bat
Hit her on the head with a bat
