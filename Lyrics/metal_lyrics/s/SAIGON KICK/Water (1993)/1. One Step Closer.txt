I am bound
Both feet and hand
Safe and sound to my cross
I will die
For I have Sinned
Have mercy on my soul
on my soul
on my soul
One step closer
To the setting sun
Your skin's on fire again
One step closer
To the promised land
Your mind's a liar again
One step closer
To the bleeding heart
A bandage for the wound
One step closer
To the only one
I am
Cause you never could
Light and Heat
From my hand
Burns the flesh of mortal men
I am the sign
From the west
The divine is laid to rest
laid to rest
laid to rest
