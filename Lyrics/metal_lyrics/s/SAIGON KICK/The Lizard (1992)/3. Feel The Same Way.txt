Saw the fire light

Had the same dream tonight
Felt the fears of the endless night in the middle of the morning light
(in the middle of the morning light)

We have disease gone crazy thoughts of revolution hazy
Computer days are lazy
I'm on the side of the man who's wiser
I'm on the side with the gun that fires

Feel the same way

Lost a life tonight

Caused a little fright tonight
Stole a dream of right
Call me a man with a view that's wild
Call me a man with a mind like a child's

Can you feel the power?

Watch them build the biggest tower
Cry a little shower all in the site of a race that's leaving
All for the right of a man you're killing

Feel the same way
