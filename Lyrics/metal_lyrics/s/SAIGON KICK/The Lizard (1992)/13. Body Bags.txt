Look into the eyes of the government liars
Listen to the sound of the guilty choir
Blood stains on the sacred pyre
Under the book the breathing fire

Social Nags, body bags

Make you gag
What a drag, drag, drag
Cyanide and suicide

Don't you try

You're gonna bleed some more

Come and let me tell you about social giants
Heard about the news but no one buys it
Killing is no secret science

Politics are fixing all defiance

Social Nags, body bags

Make you gag
What a drag, drag, drag
Cyanide and suicide

Don't you try

You're gonna bleed some more

Marilyn was the finest sleeper

J.F.K was the youngest bleeder
Luther died the bravest dreamer

So kill me know cause I'm a believer
