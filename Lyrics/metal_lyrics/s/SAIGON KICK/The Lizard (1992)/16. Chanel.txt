If you see me in the pouring rain,

no I'm never coming back again for you,
My beloved Chanel

Walk along my dear hand and hand

No, not a tear, not a grain of sand for you,
My beloved Chanel

Dancing on the moonlit sky, Glancing in each others eye

Oh, my heart does swell
Believe me when I say to you, you really ring my bell

Walking in the park the other day,

My heart skipped as I heard him say for you,
My beloved Chanel

Crying, screaming, ranting, raving mad
If you were dead, boy would I be glad for you,

My beloved Chanel

Dancing on the moonlit sky, Glancing in each others eye

Oh, my heart does swell
Believe me when I say to you, you really ring my bell

Laughing as your grave is built

Not an ounce of shame or guilt for you,
My beloved Chanel

I never cried, I never could

All the blame would do no good for you,
My beloved Chanel
