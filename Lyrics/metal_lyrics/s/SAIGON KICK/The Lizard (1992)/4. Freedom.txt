She talks to me, Outside she screams
But somewhere there's a little child

locked up inside your alibis
So take a bow for what you've done

Freedom

They light the sky, So many die

For what they see is wrong or right
Your world it seems a puzzle piece

So close but we never see

Freedom

Life goes by but the pain you'll never see from the scars your world has put on me
Our statue reads the words of peace

Those written before my time
She holds the light for those who died, so die for me and pray for me
