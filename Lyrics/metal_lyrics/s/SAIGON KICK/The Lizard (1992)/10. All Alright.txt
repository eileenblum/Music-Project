That's what I want is a blood in your eye
That's all I need is a reason to die
Put it in your vein, It will ease the pain
So talk your shit to someone else cause I ain't got the time

Don't ask me things you don't wanna hear

Turn your heart to stone in the blink of an eye
You're all I want, You can take me higher
Lady of my soul, You can't change my mind
Suicide Jones ain't got shit on me

Don't ask me things you don't wanna hear

We're all alright, whether it's wrong or right
Baby it's all alright from here
