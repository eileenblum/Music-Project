Lonely sidewalks
Silent night
Bring the evenin'
Deep inside
Hold me darling
Touch me now
Let the feelings
Free tonight

Love is one the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight baby
Love is one the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight

Time of season
Wipes the tears
No rhyme or reason
No more fears
All the dreamin'
Is far behind
You are here now
Everything's alright

Love is one the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight baby
Love is one the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight

And in the morning
I'll be gone away
All the things are left behind
If you need me
I'll come night and day
Let's stop the hands of time

Love is one the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight baby
Love is one the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight baby

Love is one the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight baby
Love is one the way
I can see it in your eyes
Let's give it one more try tonight
