When I tell you people to do the lizard,
Pull yourself together and take a listen
Take my flask and sip the liquid
Forgive me now for what I might deliver

Look around

All around

Lick your friends until they start to quiver
I ask myself if to give is richer

Look around

All around

Save yourself from falling down, all around
There's no chance you can be found underground

The Lizard....

There's a thing we say about the foolish wisher
Just do the dance and become the Lizard

Look around

All around

Save yourself from falling down, all around
There's no chance you can be found underground

The Lizard....
