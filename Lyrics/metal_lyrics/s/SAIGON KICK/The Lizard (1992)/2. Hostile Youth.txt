I can feel you now

Deep inside of me
I was blind but now

All the pain I see

We don't like our homes
It's nothing but a joke
We won't do what we're told
Leave us all alone

God is dead, you see
All you need is me
Kill off those who deny
You are king tonight

We don't like our homes
It's nothing but a joke
We won't do what we're told
Leave us all alone

I can feel you falling faster
Your life is on the wall
No more laughter, no more rules
Catch me if I fall
