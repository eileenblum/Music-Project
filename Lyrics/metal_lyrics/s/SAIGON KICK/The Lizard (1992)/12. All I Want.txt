I have danced in the finest ballrooms
I have loved, never loosing sight
I have sighed at the sight of Paris
All I want is you

All I need is you

I would die from a soldiers bullet
I would wait in the noon day sun
I would cry from the highest mountain
All I want is you

All I need is you

All I want is you....

I can run with the bulls in Spain
I can have the finest jewels
I could climb the Himalayas
All I want is you

All I need is you

All I want is you....

I am the one who kneels down, don't you know?
I want the things only you could ever show
You need a man who loves you more than his life
Zero's the price for the ride into life

I never thought the sun would rise on a day as fine as this
All my life, I would dream it happened
All I want is you

All I need is you....
