In the light of day I can still see the light, see the light
Veins of red and blue dance on tracks in the night, in the night

Once upon a dream I had she came and said OK [x2]
The world goes round [x2]

She will come to you with a scream for her life, for her life
Act of god, part two, Her life bleeds off the knife, off the knife

Once upon a dream I had she came and said OK [x2]
The world goes round [x2]
