Oh no
Oh god no
He's dead

He's dead

My dog was walking down the street, minding his own business
Then this fucking car came and ran him over
Have you seen my dog playing round and round?

And he was looking up at me with those big brown eyes
And he started shaking and shaking
There I was I didn't know what to do,
And the blood was just pouring out of his mouth into a puddle

Oh god

He's dead, no!
Have you seen my dog playing round and round your town?
