Let's say you take the pain
To far and distant places
And if you ask of me
I'll tell you all the stories of life
And when you get there
You seek solace in their faces
No longer searching for
The light within the tower of love
What you say and what you do
Is a contradiction to the
Life that's safe and sound
(Safe and sound)
What you say and what you do
Is a contradiction to the
Life that's safe and sound
(Safe and sound)
I dreamt the blue skies
Came crumbling down to pieces
It's like the world is simply
Closing in and holding me down
I've seen the pain, the hate
And death without a reason
I've walked between line of reality
And earthly escape
What you say and what you do
Is a contradiction to the
Life that's safe and sound
(Safe and sound)
What you say and what you do
Is a contradiction to the
Life that's safe and sound
(Safe and sound)
Let's say you take the pain
To far and distant places
And if you ask of me
I'll tell you all the stories of life
And when you get there
You seek solace in their faces
No longer searching for
The light within the tower of love
What you say and what you do
Is a contradiction to the
Life that's safe and sound
(Safe and sound)
What you say and what you do
Is a contradiction to the
Life that's safe and sound
(Safe and sound)
What you say and what you do
(What you say and what you do)
What you say and what you do
(What you say and what you do)
What you say and what you do
(What you say and what you do)
What you say and what you do
(What you say, what you say)
What you say and what you do
(What you say and what you do)
