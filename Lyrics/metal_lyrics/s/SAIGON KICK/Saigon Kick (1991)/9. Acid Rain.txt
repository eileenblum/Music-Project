Rain, rain, acid rain
Don't come back for another day
I wash my face in the sea of blood
I wash my face in the sea of blood
Rain, where are you hiding?
Gotta, gotta get away
Get away, get away
I walked on the wings of your mother's schemes
I walked on the water and I floated on streams
Went to the mountain, oh, what did I see?
A [Incomprehensible] castle up on that hill
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, oh no
Gotta, gotta get away
Get away, get away
Rain, rain, acid rain
Don't come back for another day
I wash my face in the sea of blood
I wash my face in the sea of blood
Yeah, oh no
Gotta, gotta get away
I'll get away, I'll get away
Rain
Gotta, gotta get away
Hey, hey now, no, no, no
Gotta, gotta get away
