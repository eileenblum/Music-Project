Time people might say
Isn't it grand and sometimes unfair?
Climb as high as you can
Talk to the stars and kiss them for me
Is this your world? So far away
All that you know, all gone away
Life isn't it vague?
Haziness, thoughts of one's reason to live
Fly so far away
Over the clouds and wait for me there
Is this your world? So far away
All that you know, all gone away, so far away
As I watched the sun touch down
To the last point of a dark, pale, violent night
Endless thoughts flowed through my mind
Like faint rainbows caressing the skies
We are the new world love clan
Crimes based on position
Not of a constant just a transition
Love is what they say
Binding the last safe thing but steals it away
Is this your world? So far away
All that you know, all gone away
Is this your world? So far away
All that you know, all gone away
Is this your world?
