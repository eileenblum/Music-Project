He says she said that the counters in the room was a paranoia
It's hard to believe the walls can breathe
But I see it in my eyes
I see it in my eyes
Pretty girls with painted faces
Dancing for the boys
Crazy dreams just how it seems
As you know she slowly passed me by
Coming home, oh-oh-oh
I'm coming home, oh-oh-oh
Coming home, oh-oh-oh
Flying high to paper skies
Soaring through the heavens of shame
Find me now I never left the ground
Only how the stars remain the same
So the stars remain the same
So they remain the same
Coming home
Well I'm coming home, oh-oh-oh
Coming home, oh-oh-oh
Coming home, oh-oh-oh
It's always the beautiful ones that let you down
They fall in love with the lust
They fall in love with sex
They fall in love with the faith
The faith, the faith, the faith in Hell
Coming home,
A-well I'm coming home, oh-oh-oh
Coming home, oh-oh-oh
Coming home, oh-oh-oh
A-well it's one small thing I say to you
Is always keep control
Pretty girls with their painted faces
Dancing for the boys
Are coming home, home, home
Are coming home, oh-oh-oh
Coming home, Coming home
