Suzy had a dream
Of what she could not tell
She only guarantees
It'll take you straight to Hell
Sunday was a day
When we prayed up to the skies
Doesn't change the fact
That we all soon die
Stand right on the line
The line of dreams and fate
And if we should bail
We'll find someone to hate
It's so hard to walk upon the line
Sometimes
It only leads you back
Where you were found
One day we will see
The little red light's enough
'Til then we'll pull ourselves
Down from high above
It's so hard to walk upon the line
Sometimes
It only leads you back
Where you were found
It's so hard to walk upon the line
Sometimes
It only leads you back
Where you were found
Yeah!
It's so hard to walk upon the line
Sometimes
It only leads you back
Where you were found
