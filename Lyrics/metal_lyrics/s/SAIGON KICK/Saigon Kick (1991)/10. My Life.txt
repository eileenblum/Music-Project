Father says he is the only one
And even if he is the only one
I find him so confusing still today
Mother says she is the only one
And even if she is the only one
She was the one I needed her today
She was the one I needed her today
You know I never tried to hurt you
I never tried you know I really never tried
Somehow I find I really need you
I'll never, ever, ever leave you
You never ever will believe me

[Chorus:]
Even if you walked across the skies
I'll be with you tonight
Even if you told a thousand lies
I'd still believe you
All alone along the sea I dream of you
You know I need you here with me
The emptiness inside my heart
Your an angel well within my
Your and angel well within my sight
Sister says she was the only one
And even if she was the only one
My life was just completed yesterday
Darling say that you're the only one
And if you say that you're the only one
My life was just completed here today
My life was just completed here today
I find him so confusing still today
Mother says she is the only one
And even if she is the only one
She was the one I needed her today
She was the one I needed her today
You know I never tried to hurt you
I never tried you know I really never tried
Somehow I find I really need you
I'll never, ever, ever leave you
You never ever will believe me

[Chorus:]
Even if you walked across the skies
I'll be with you tonight
Even if you told a thousand lies
I'd still believe you
All alone along the sea I dream of you
You know I need you here with me
The emptiness inside my heart
Your an angel well within my
Your and angel well within my sight
