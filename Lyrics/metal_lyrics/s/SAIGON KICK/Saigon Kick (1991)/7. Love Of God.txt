Father know, woman cries
No one looks into those eyes
Stories told a thousand times
Which a fool always buys
Fields of fire, electric sight
Burned my flesh alive tonight
Rose of love, trees of life
Now I'm all a flame
For the love of God
Shining through, feeling all your pain
For the love of God
Shining through, feeling all your pain
Spend your life, searched your soul
A moments glory, a dream of gold
Rays of light, stain glass walls
Within his house, the angels call
Sister slaves, brother fights
Mental walls divide the light
Cast in stone, world of lies
Now I'm all a flame
