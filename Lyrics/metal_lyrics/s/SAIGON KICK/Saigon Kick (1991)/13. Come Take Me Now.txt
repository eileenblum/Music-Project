Time, Iâm dreaming it all away
I canât find the words to say
But somehow I feel itâs over
God, Iâm down on my knees to pray
Life slowly fades away
It just seems to last forever
Home, take me to the place
Itâs warm and Iâm not afraid
Shelter me from the rain
Lord, come take me now I feel that itâs over
I feel that it`s over
Lord, come take me now I feel that itâs over
I feel that itâs over
Lost, out here without a trace
Feeling all the pain
Wondering if Iâm insane
So, you think that yesterday
Is gone away
You wish it was here to stay
It just doesnât seem the same
Lord, come take me now I feel that itâs over
I feel that it`s over
Lord, come take me now I feel that itâs over
I feel that itâs over

[Guitar solo]

Lord, come take me now I feel that itâs over
I feel that it`s over
Lord, come take me now I feel that itâs over
I feel that it`s over
Take me lord
Take me far away
I said itâs over
Come and take me please, I say
Lord, come and take me now
Come and take me now
