I can see the future deep inside tomorrow
I can smell the money, the way you feel
Guarding all the children, is not love the answer
you cannot pretend your life is real...

[Chorus (x2):]
Can you see the colors
changing just inside tomorrows skies,
can you feel the winds of change
blowing upon our lives
Can you see the future well within your sorrow
beyond your discerning the fatal reel
Guarding all the children, is not love the answer
you cannot pretend your life is real...

[Chorus (x2):]
Can you see the colors
changing just inside tomorrows skies,
can you feel the winds of change
blowing upon our lives

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus (x8)]
