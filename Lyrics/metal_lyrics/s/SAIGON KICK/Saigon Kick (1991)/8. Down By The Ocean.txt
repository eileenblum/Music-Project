Down by the ocean
Where the little girls play
Down by the ocean
Where the little girls play
Sweet Larissa wants candy
Johnny wants her to stay
Sweet Larissa wants Johnny
But Johnny thinks he's gay
Time's always changing
And I don't know what to say
Same old story
Just a different day
Upstairs, turn right, take a look around
Your mama's not at home (home)
Johnny's got a need
Johnny's got a needle
Johnny feels at home
Time's always changing
And I don't know what to say
Same old story
Just a different day
So it's just a
Just a different day
Hmmm
Down by the ocean
Where the little girls play
Down by the ocean
Where the little girls play
Sweet Larissa wants candy
Johnny wants her to stay
Sweet Larissa wants Johnny
But Johnny thinks he's gay
Hey!
Time's always changing
And I don't know what to say
Same old story
But it's just a different day
Time's always changing
And I don't remember what to say
Same old story
Just a different day
