When I look into the light
Then I see that the light won't do
See the shade of a daisy fooling you
So you go about your ways
As you did I head [Incomprehensible]
All in your eyes when he sent for you
State your case and then I will follow
No romance, no romance until tomorrow
State your case and I will follow
No romance, no romance until tomorrow
Lives ahead of your time
You're a legend but you never knew
See the shakes in the wake puttin' it back for you
Got to school in these ways
But if you fall, who catches you?
All the walls that you make will never do
So, state your case and I will follow
No romance, no romance until tomorrow
State your case and I will follow
No romance, no romance until tomorrow
I.C.U. in starlight
I don't mind but I'm feeling used
I.C.U. in starlight
And you're blind to what I can do now
I fall down, so fall down
[Incomprehensible] when I'm here when you're down
When they look into the light
Then they see that the light won't do
See the shade of a daisy fooling you
So you go about your ways
As you did, I head [Incomprehensible]
All in your eyes if he sent for you
State your case and I will follow
No romance, no romance until tomorrow
State your case and I will follow
No romance, no romance until tomorrow
I.C.U. in starlight
I don't mind but I'm feeling used
I.C.U. in starlight
And you're blind to what I can do now
I.C.U. in starlight
I don't mind, don't mind
I don't mind, no, no, no
Oh, no
I.C.U. in starlight
And you're blind
It is one thing I like, yeah
