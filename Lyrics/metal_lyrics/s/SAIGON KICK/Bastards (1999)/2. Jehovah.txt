Something somewhere's really fucking wrong
I Got my eyes peeled back but
I'm singing the same old song
I got my right hand on the book of how and way
I took my glasses off so you could see my pretty eyes

I gave and I take ya
I bend and don't brake
You're thinking all in all
He's a raving sensation

Jehovah makes his mother cry
Don't let your soul bleed dry
Jehovah makes his mother cry
Don't let your soul bleed let it fly

I got a big black belt around my waist
And if you ask me nice I'll let you have a taste
I got these big brown eyes you love to dream about
I got those pouty lips to tell you just get out

I gave and I take ya
I bend and don't brake
You're thinking all in all
He's a raving sensation

Jehovah makes his mother cry
Don't let your soul bleed dry
Jehovah makes his mother cry
Don't let your soul bleed let it fly

I got some brand new pants so I could be in vogue
Not the fashion sense the cover don't you know
I got a villa high atop a mountain range
I got a pillow made of clouds that spells my name

I gave and I take ya
I bend and don't brake
You're thinking all in all
He's a raving sensation

Jehovah makes his mother cry
Don't let your soul bleed dry
Jehovah makes his mother cry
Don't let your soul bleed dry

Jehovah makes his mother cry
Don't let your soul bleed dry
Jehovah makes his mother cry
Don't let your soul bleed let it fly
