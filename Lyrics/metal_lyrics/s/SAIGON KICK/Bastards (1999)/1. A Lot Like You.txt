I'm a lot like you without clue
But it don't come easy so easy for me

What's a boy to to do I'm lost in eyes so blue
I bet it all come easy so easy for you

Conscience makes the would go round
She sits inside with a smill frown
She wants to walk the streets without her name

Trapped inside a zoo did you get your pictures dude
It's just all easy so easy to do

Where's head right now
Did you lose your big cash cow
Did they all bleed easy so easy for you

Conscience makes the would go round
She sits inside with a smill frown
She wants to walk the streets without her name
her name

Conscience makes the would go round
She sits inside with a smill frown
She wants to walk the streets without her name
her name

Balance this against your will
The ones you love you know you kill
What's a girl to do with all of this
all of this
