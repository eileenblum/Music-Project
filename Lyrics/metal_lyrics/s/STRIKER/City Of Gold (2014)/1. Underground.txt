Night after night
The passion burning deep in every soul
I can feel it
Night after night
We keep coming back
Together we are strong
I need it

Believe in yourself
And nobody else
We're holding the crown 
Crushed by the sound
Believe in the underground

We'll win the fight
We're fighting and no one can keep us down
Feel the power
We'll take control
Fight and conquer all those who appose
It's the only way

Believe in yourself
And nobody else
We're holding the crown
Crushed by the sound
Believe in the underground

Night after night
The passion burning deep in every soul
I can feel it
Night after night
We keep coming back
Together we are strong
I need it

Believe in yourself
And nobody else
We're holding the crown
Crushed by the sound
Believe in the underground
