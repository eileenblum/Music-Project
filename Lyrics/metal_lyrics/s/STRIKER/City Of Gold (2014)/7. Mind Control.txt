Living under mind control
But that ain't living at all
They give you what you want
But never what you need

I'm starving for life
I'm dying to live
Tell yourself it will be alright
The change isn't worth the fight

Don't think, don't speak
Just agree with everything they say
And if you tow the line
You'll be a slave until the day you die

Tell me what to think
Tell me how to feel
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
Watch what you say
Watch what you do
Cause the man is watching you

We're building it up and it's ready to fall
We reach to the top but it's always too tall
The system we have is the end of us all
Give up your dreams and surrender your soul

No one cares until it's too late
By the time you know it's already over
They'll bring you to your knees
Stop and watch you bleed
The secret's out
It might be too late
The only way to know for sure
Is smash the fucking gate

Tell me what to think
Tell me how to feel
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
Watch what you say
Watch what you do
Cause the man is watching you
