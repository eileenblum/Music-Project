Bright eyes tell stories
The way the world used to be
White lies of lost glory
We were blind but used to see

They're screaming into the night
The blood of the innocent soul

City of gold
It's no time to be alive
City of gold
When you're lost in the city

Baptized in memories
The writings on the wall
Truth dies with history
What really happened there?

They're screaming into the night
The blood of the innocent soul

City of gold
It's no time to be alive
City of gold
When you're chosen to die
City of gold
The golden king, the serpent ring, the god of all
City of gold
The master of the sun

Darkness into shadow
The death of the sun
Reborn to rise again
Under the morning sky

They're screaming into the night
The blood of the innocent soul

City of gold
It's no time to be alive
City of gold
When you're chosen to die
City of gold
The golden king, the serpent ring, the god of all
City of gold
The master of the sun
