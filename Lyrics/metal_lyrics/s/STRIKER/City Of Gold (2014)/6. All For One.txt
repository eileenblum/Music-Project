Teacher listen to the words you speak
Do you practice what you preach
What do you hear when you're all alone
And in the end will you atone

We'll get to the top at the end of the day
Believe it's the truth when I say

All for one
One for all

Creator look at the world you made
The king of hearts in a deck of spades
You gave us vision without the sight
To find the answer, the meaning of life

All for one
One for all

We'll get to the top at the end of the day
Believe it's the truth when I say

All for one
One for all
