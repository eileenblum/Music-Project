Do what you want
In a world that's so cut throat
They don't expect you to be
What you want to be
A rebel with no cause
Willing to fight to be free

Oh ready to rise up
Ready to fight for you
Fight for you

To live, to die, a free man
To live, to die, a free man

Don't back down
We refuse to obey
When the streets are on fire
We stand in the flames
Won't let fear control how we live
We've got too much to give

Oh ready to rise up
Ready to fight for you
Fight for you

Sometimes it feels like the end
Is so close
And everything, everything, feels
So far away
Sometimes it feels like the end
Is so close
And everything, everything, feels
So far away

Oh ready to rise up
Ready to fight for you
Fight for you

Oh ready to rise up
Ready to fight for you
Fight for you

To live, to die, a free man
To live, to die, a free man
