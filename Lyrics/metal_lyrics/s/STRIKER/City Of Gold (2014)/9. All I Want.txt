Before she came to me
Life was a mystery
Walking down another lonely road
I was hypnotized
Caught up in my own lies
And got lost along the way

I was waiting for someone
To come wash these sins away
I was waiting for someone
Someone like you

And I had to tell myself
No man is made of stone
And no one wants to die alone

But when you're waiting for someone else
It can be so hard to remember

She's all I want
She's everything I need
Yeah she's got it all
It only gets better
As time passes by
Yeah she's got it all
She's got it all

I had to turn away
And get a new perspective
Cause everything I need
Was staring back at me

But when you're waiting for someone else
It can be so hard to remember

She's all I want
She's everything I need
Yeah she's got it all
It only gets better
As time passes by
Yeah she's got it all

If you'll take me
You'll never be alone again
Until the end
We belong
Our love is strong
My friend
Until the end

Before she came to me
Life was a mystery
Walking down another lonely road

But when you're waiting for someone else
It can be so hard to remember

She's all I want
She's everything I need
Yeah she's got it all
It only gets better
As time passes by
Yeah she's got it all
She's got it all
