There's no chance
For salvation
The world's spinning out of control
The last dance
Of dead nations
We're never getting out of the hole

Shut down, Reset, Destroy
Total, System, Destruction

The fire burns another day
Too young to die, too old to pray
Revolution paves the way
To burn the lines
And start again

Got sick, from radiation
Warning shots but we never learned
Low class frustration
Watch your city burn

Shut down, Reset, Destroy
Total, System, Destruction

The fire burns another day
Too young to die, too old to pray
Revolution paves the way
To burn the lines
And start again

The fire burns another day
Too young to die, too old to pray
Revolution paves the way
To burn the lines
And start again

To burn the lines and start again
To burn the lines and start again
