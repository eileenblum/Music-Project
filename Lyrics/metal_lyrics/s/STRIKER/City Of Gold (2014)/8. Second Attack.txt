Only the strong survive
We are all born to die
Your move, the choice between hell or high-water
Too few can walk alone
Too fast to throw the stone
Lights out, you can't stop me now

This is a second attack
There is no time to react

Dive in, jump off the cliff
Go off and run the risk
The second attack
What's holding you back
Fuck it I'm going in
Living a life of sin
Hold on to what you believe

Songs of the night are calling to me
The voice of the siren I finally see

Calling out, calling to set me free
Calling out, the difference between you and me
The songs of the night are calling to me

These times will never last
Strong winds still holding fast
On and on so it's now or never
We are what we create
Start now, don't hesitate
The future is ours
The wealth and the scars

This is a second attack
There is no time to react
