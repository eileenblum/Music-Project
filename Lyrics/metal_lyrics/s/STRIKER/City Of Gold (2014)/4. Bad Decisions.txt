I live today but always think of tomorrow
The highroad isn't always easy to follow
Every path has its ups and downs
Spent too much time always hanging around

Oh I gotta get away
Don't want to lose these days
Oh I gotta find a way
It's hard to go when it's so easy to stay

Oh, I'm making bad decisions
Oh, I'm making bad decisions

You take a chance and it ends up the wrong way
A wrong turn can lead you astray
Time to wonder but no time to choose
But that's the way it goes win or lose

Oh I gotta get away
Don't want to lose these days
Oh I gotta find a way
It's hard to go when it's so easy to stay
Hey

Oh, I'm making bad decisions
Oh, I'm making bad decisions

When you follow your dreams
Your life can be lonely
And it's not always right
But it's always been my way

Oh I gotta get away
Don't want to lose these days
Oh I gotta find a way
It's hard to go when it's so easy to stay

Oh, I'm making bad decisions
Oh, I'm making bad decisions
