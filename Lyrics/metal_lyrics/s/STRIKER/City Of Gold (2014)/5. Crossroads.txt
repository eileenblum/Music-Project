Take your empty life
I don't need it
Take your wasted time
I don't need it at all
Take your silver and gold I don't need it at all

Take your nine to five
I don't need it
Swallow your hollow lies
I don't need it at all
Let the hammer fall
I don't need it at all

The lust for freedom is calling us all
The harder you fight, the harder you fall
I know the meaning can be hard to see
And I don't want the weight of your sympathy

I want to see something new
I want to go places I've never been
I never know which way to go

I want to learn something new
I want to see faces I've never seen
I never know which way to go

Went along without having a reason
This empty life is a good damn prison
I can't relate or participate
I had to go 'cause I couldn't wait

I want to see something new
I want to go places I've never been
I never know which way to go

I want to learn something new
I want to see faces I've never seen
I never know which way to go

I'm waiting for the world to see
Not every mind is a puzzle piece
They can't all be forced to fit
And wander through life
Never giving a shit

I want to see something new
I want to go places I've never been
I never know which way to go

I want to learn something new
I want to see faces I've never seen
I never know which way to go
