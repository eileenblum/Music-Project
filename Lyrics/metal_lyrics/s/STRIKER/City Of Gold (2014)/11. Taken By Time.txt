I can't shake this feeling
The feeling you're still there
And I wish things could be the way they used to be
When you were here with me

So long
I'll remember you
I'll remember you
I'll remember you
I never thought you'd be
Taken by time

It's so hard to ease the pain
The pain in my heart
One day I'll be OK
The empty feeling fades away
See you beyond the grave

So long
I'll remember you
I'll remember you
I'll remember you
I never thought you'd be
Taken by time

I'll always remember
I'll always remember
I'll always remember
I'll always remember

So long
I'll remember you
I'll remember you
I'll remember you
I never thought you'd be
Taken by time
