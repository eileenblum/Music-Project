Out in the night , haunting the streets
sign of terror - There is no retreat
through the back roads madness unfolds
evil takes control

Run for your life
fear holds your tight
you better beware
demons on the hunt tonight

HeÂ´s out for blood - stay out of sight
lord of the sword
cuts through the night

My blade is lethal
i strike with power
i live in the darkness
this is your final hour

Heart of steel - Out to destroy
my thirst for blood
is never satisfied

Run for your life
fear holds your tight
you better beware
demons on the hunt tonight

HeÂ´s out for blood - stay out of sight
lord of the sword
cuts through the night
