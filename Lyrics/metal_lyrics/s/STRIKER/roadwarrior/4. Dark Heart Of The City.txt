Evil lurks in the shadows
eyes burn in to your soul
poisoned minds feed on the night
a city countrolled the hands of the wicked
and no one dares stand up
stand up your whatÂ´s right

Oh no - it will never change
this city knows only pain

In the dark -life is but a dream
in the dark - the worlds not as it seems
in the dark - life is but a dream 
in the dark - no one hears you scream 

Creatures of the darkness run into the night
fear chills to the bone - all alone
nowhere to call their home
searching for freedom at the end of the rope
living on the edge of the world 
the end is only a step away
so deep you can never get out
theyÂ´ll only drag you back 

Bullying the weak :Chris
terrorizing the possers :Ian

In the dark heart of the city
youÂ´ll find what youÂ´re looking for 
in the dark heart of the city 
you can feel its pulse 

Six -string armageddon:Ian
