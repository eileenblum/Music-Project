Torched and twisted metal
tearing through the night
a warrior stands alone
witing for the fight

Dust upon the ground
and thunder from the sky
killers all around
your worldÂ´s about to die

Road warrior - on the run

Hpocalyptic posermashing :Ian

He stands and the fights
with nothing to fear
the sounds of gunshots
ring is his ear

Fire off a round
his target explodes
hear pounding faster
they race round the road

Rage and fury
death in his eyes
youÂ´ll never escape
heÂ´ll seal your fate
in the end
you all shall die

Road warrior - On the run
