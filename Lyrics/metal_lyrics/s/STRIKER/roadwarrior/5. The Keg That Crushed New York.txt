[Bonus Track]Metal keg of glory, one thousand tonnes of steel
Filled right to the brim - a thousand beers to steal
From the planet booze in the galaxy of beer
Flew beerzillion light years just to party here

Taller than a mountain, high up in the sky
Fear the beerorizer, so drunk I'm going to die

The keg that crushed New York
Watch out, the tidal wave is coming
The keg that crushed New York
You better start running....NOT

*tsk* glug...glug...glug...glug....GO!!

You've had one beer and I've had eleven
If beer came from boobs I'd be in heaven
So quit your job and leave your school
And party with Striker, that'll be cool

Taller than a mountain, high up in the sky
Fear the beerorizer, so drunk I'm going to die

The keg that crushed New York
Watch out, the tidal wave is coming
The keg that crushed New York
BEERNAMI!!!!

Surfs up!

Metal heads, metal heads, drinking beer and breaking shit
Metal heads, metal heads, drinking beer and breaking shit
Metal heads, metal heads, drinking beer and breaking shit
Metal heads, metal heads, drinking beer and breaking shit

Taller than a mountain, high up in the sky
Fear the beerorizer, so drunk I'm going to die

The keg that crushed New York
Watch out, the tidal wave is coming
The keg that crushed New York
Wipeout!
