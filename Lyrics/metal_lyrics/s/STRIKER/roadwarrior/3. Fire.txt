ThereÂ´s no tourning back
weÂ´re here to attack
running hot
with the pedal to the metal

Wheels of steel - speed unreal
Yeah yeah - Turbo shock

Race to the end
life on a razorÂ´s edge
ride on the wind
ready to crash and burn

Fire - Burning in the night
fire -Burning in the night

Out of control , rock and roll
danger zone
ready to explode

Kick your face
into outer space
feel the roar
of my metal scream

Burning in the night
Burning in the night

No ! Yeah !
