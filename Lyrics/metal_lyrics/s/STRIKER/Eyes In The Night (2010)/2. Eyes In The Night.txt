Out in the golden plains
The danger is real
The hunter is hunted
Fear is all that you feel

Chained up in terror
From what you can't see
It's out there somewhere
But where could it be

Beware
The man eater
He could be coming after you

Eyes in the night
Stalking his victims just out of sight
Eyes in the night

Wild and free
The leader of the pack
Slowly it waits
To make its final attack

Eyes glowing in the dark
Your death coming near
Out of the shadows
The beast appears

Beware
The man eater
He could be coming after you

Eyes in the night
Stalking his victims just out of sight

Out in the golden plains
The danger is real
The hunter is hunted
Fear is all that you feel

Beware
The man eater
He could be coming after you

Eyes in the night
Stalking his victims just out of sight
Eyes in the night
Stalking his victims just out of sight
Eyes in the night
