Terror rising
My mind a distressed flood of lies
The choice was made
It is his will to send them to their graves

Make them burn
I don't know what to believe
Make them suffer
I will make them bleed

Out of his mind
Running blind
Is this the fate of mankind

Can you see the madness in his eyes
He's the terrorizer
Can you see the madness in his eyes
He's the terrorizer

This is it
The final act the curtains close
Will I make them proud
Or will I burn forever in hell

I close my eyes
See my life flashing before me
Do I have the strength
To take my own life

Out of his mind
Running blind
Is this the fate of mankind

Can you see the madness in his eyes
He's the terrorizer
Can you see the madness in his eyes
He's the terrorizer

Out of his mind
Running blind
Is this the fate of mankind

Can you see the madness in his eyes
He's the terrorizer
Can you see the madness in his eyes
He's the terrorizer
