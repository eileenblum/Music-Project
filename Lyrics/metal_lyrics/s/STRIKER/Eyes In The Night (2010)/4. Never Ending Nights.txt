The loneliness it cuts through me
You've been away for far too long
In the night I feel your touch
I need you back where you belong

Like an icy vision
I see you in my dreams
Reaching out
To touch my hand

And I still remember

One never ending night
Evening in paradise
As I look into your eyes

I wait here all alone
I'm longing for you touch
I need you now like I always have
This feeling is too much

You always are so distant
You are so far away
But in my heart I know
We grow stronger every day

As the pain is growing
One day I'll see the end
You and I
Side by side

And I still remember

One never ending night
Evening in paradise
As I look into your eyes

Take me back
To those never ending nights
