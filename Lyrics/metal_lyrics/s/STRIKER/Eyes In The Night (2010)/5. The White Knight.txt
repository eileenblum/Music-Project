He is the holiest of knights
Forever fighting for the light
The protector of the innocent
Defender of the weak

Hear the cry of the angels
The holy war
Those who try will fight and die

Ride on into the mouth of hell
Unholy demons he will kill
Send them back from whence they came
All in darkness know his name

Hear the cry of the angels
The holy war
Those who try will fight and die

Protect the kingdom
You shall not pass
Fight for glory
Defend what is right
The white knight

Forever legends will be told
Of a man who stands alone
Symbol of honor burning bright
Glowing armor in the night

Hear the cry of the angels
The holy war
Those who try will fight and die

Protect the kingdom
You shall not pass
Fight for glory
Defend what is right
The white knight

Hear the cry of the angels
The holy war
Those who try will fight and die

Protect the kingdom
You shall not pass
Fight for glory
Defend what is right
