Listen my people
To these words I have to say
A new time is upon us
There are lives that must be saved

Sickness and evil
A plague through out our land
Brings chaos and hatred
We all must take a stand

We see the times are changing
We are reborn
Our trust has been shattered into pieces
Our minds are tom

Sick and tired
Of the ignorance of fools
Break your shackles
Disobey the rules

Take a minute to disbelieve
What theyâre telling you and me
You have the power
Take your life and

Break away
Listen to your soul and cease the day
Break away
Believe in me there is another way

Liars and cheaters
You can see them everywhere
Nothing to check the balance
No one even cares

The rich get richer
The rest of us will die
Our worlds a tragic story
How can we survive
