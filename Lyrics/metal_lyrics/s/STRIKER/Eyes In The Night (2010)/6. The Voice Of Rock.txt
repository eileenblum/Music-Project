Midnight's on fire
Feel the heat of the night
The voice is calling
You're ready to ignite

We are the darkness
We are the light
We are the chosen few
Who stand up and fight

Street people
We carry on and on
You too will hear the call
When your backs against the wall
Open your mind and you'll hear

The voice of rock
The voice of rock will never die
The voice of rock
Shout it out to the sky

Feels like the world's against you
Like there's nowhere to turn
You are the victim
Of lessons never learned

Everyday the same old shit
You just can't catch a break
An endless stream of disappointment
They take and take and take

Street people
We carry on and on
You too will hear the call
When your backs against the wall
Open your mind and you'll hear

The voice of rock
The voice of rock will never die
The voice of rock
Shout it out to the sky

Rock!
Rock!
No the voice of rock will never die
The voice of rock
Shout it out to the sky
