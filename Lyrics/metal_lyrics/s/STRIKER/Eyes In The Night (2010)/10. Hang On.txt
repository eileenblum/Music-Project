You've never been so low before
No you can't figure it out
The world is yours open the door
There is more than meets the eye

Hang on
To the edge of your life
(To the edge of your life)

Stay strong
You don't know what you've got until itâs gone
(What you've got until itâs gone)

Taking the chance to live your life
With open arms
Let all your wildest dreams come true
Itâs up to you

Hang on
To the edge of your life
(To the edge of your life)

Stay strong
You don't know what you've got until itâs gone
(What you've got until itâs gone)

Life is ever changing
You can travel any path you choose
Always rearranging
Life goes on and on and on and on

Hang on
To the edge of your life
Hang on
To the edge of your life

Hang on
To the edge of your life
(To the edge of your life)

Stay strong
You don't know what you've got until itâs gone
(What you've got until itâs gone)
