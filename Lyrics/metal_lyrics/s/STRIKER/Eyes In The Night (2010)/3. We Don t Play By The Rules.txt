Try and push me around
Try and get in my way
But yeah baby
Donât give a shit what you say

I'm rough on edges
I'm dirty and mean
Yeah yeah
I'm the best you've ever seen

I've got the will
I've got the way
Breaking the rules
Every single day

Don't try and stop me
Well I'm a loaded gun
Squeeze my trigger
Ooo you better run

We don't play by the rules
We're nobody's fools
Time to change the game
Everybody knows my name

You want a piece of the action
Well I'm the main attraction
Baby don't get me down
I just wanna fool around

I like it fast
I like it loud
I wanna hear that (UH!)
Pounding through the ground

Well I'm a man of action
Any place any time
One look at me baby
I'll stop your heart on a dime

We don't play by the rules
We're nobody's fools
Time to change the game
Everybody knows my name

You want a piece of the action
Well I'm the main attraction
Baby don't get me down
I just wanna fool around
