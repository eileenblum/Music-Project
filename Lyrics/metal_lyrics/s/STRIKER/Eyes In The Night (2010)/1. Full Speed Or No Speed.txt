I see the fire
I see the flames
Setting the world ablaze
I feel the speed
I feel the rush
Grinding your bones to the dust

Something comes alive
Hang on for the ride

Full speed or no speed
Live one day at a time
Full speed or no speed
Living life ain't a crime

Loud like thunder
Fast as light
Racing on through the night
Full metal fury
Speed rocket strike
Full speed out of sight

Something comes alive
Hang on for you life

Full speed or no speed
Live one day at a time
Full speed or no speed
Living life ain't a crime

Life in the fast lane
Get out of my way
I don't care what they say
I live for today

Full speed or no speed
Live one day at a time
Full speed or no speed
Living life ain't a crime
