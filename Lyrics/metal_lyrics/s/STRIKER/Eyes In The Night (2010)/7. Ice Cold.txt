Take a moment as I fall into your soul
In a world of madness as a child you were thrown
Pain and torment the well of sanity runs dry
The violence washed out by the tears in your eyes

Maybe you can find a way
To forget the sins
Of yesterday

Across a bridge and far away
Your innocents lies buried
Never to return
Itâs lost in the shadows

Maybe you can find a way
To forget the sins
Of yesterday

Ice cold
Your Heart
Step into the mind of a killer

Your fate
Disgrace
You can never go back to the way things were

You're on the outside looking in
On your memories
The mind plays deadly games
Of sin and illusion

Maybe you can find a way
To forget the sins
Of yesterday

Ice cold
Your Heart
Step Into the mind of a killer

Your fate
Disgrace
You can never go back to the way things were

Many years have gone
You beg for forgiveness
Locked away forever
In the dungeons of your past

Maybe you can find a way
To forget the sins
Of yesterday

Ice cold
Your Heart
Step into the mind of a killer

Your fate
Disgrace
You can never go back to the way things were
