I'm on fire my mind is burning
My soul's alive with the flame
My heart's racing I'm moving faster
I know you feel the same

Take a chance
And roll the dice with me
Do what it takes
To set me free

When the day turns to night
And the feeling is right
You know I've got to
Feed my fire
When I push to the edge
I've got you out on a ledge
I can give you
Hot desire

My attention is shorter than you think
There's no rules to the game no
My priorities ever changing
And you're the one to blame

Take a chance
And roll the dice with me
Do what it takes
To set me free

When the day turns to night
And the feeling is right
You know I've got to
Feed my fire
When I push to the edge
I've got you out on a ledge
I can give you
Hot desire
