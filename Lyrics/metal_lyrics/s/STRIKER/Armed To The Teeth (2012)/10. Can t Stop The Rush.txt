I can't live like this anymore
One more day I'll walk out the door
Call the cops
I must be out of my mind

I won't stop living life on the line
No don't you worry I'm doing fine

Can't stop the rush
Oh yeah I can feel it
Can't stop the rush
Armed to the teeth

I've got stacks, money to burn
No more problems, I rip every turn
Youth gone wild, It's not my fault
Go for the cash, and never hit the vault

I won't stop living life on the line
No don't you worry I'm doing fine

Can't stop the rush
Oh yeah I can feel it
Can't stop the rush
Armed to the teeth

Can't stop the rush
Oh yeah I can feel it
Can't stop the rush
No I'm never gonna quit

Can't stop the rush
Oh yeah I can feel it
Can't stop the rush
Armed to the teeth
