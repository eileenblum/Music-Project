Into the sky our journey begins
Off to a place that memory erased
Forgotten land that man left alone
Our final destination never coming home

Never coming home

Land of the lost, home of the strange
I'll be waiting for you
Land of the lost, home of the strange
I know you're out there somewhere

Moments of panic as we fall through the trees
Crash in mid air no way to repair
Music of the night so strange to my ears
Closer and closer it's calling me
To answer my fears

To answer my fears

Eyes in the darkness draw ever so near
No guiding light no saviour in sight
Nothing to do but pray for our rescue
Death is near and no one knows we're here

Land of the lost, home of the strange
I'll be waiting for you
Land of the lost, home of the strange
I know you're out there somewhere

Land of the lost, home of the strange
I'll be waiting for you
Land of the lost, home of the strange
I know you're out there somewhere

Land of the lost, home of the strange
I'll be waiting for you
Land of the lost, home of the strange
I know you're out there somewhere
