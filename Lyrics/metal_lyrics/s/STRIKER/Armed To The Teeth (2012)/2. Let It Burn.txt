I'm breaking down
I'm losing ground
Don't even know why I'm still here

I never wanted to be
Like everybody else
I want to live by my own rules

Seems like my problems get a bit worse everyday
I've got no money so who cares anyways

Let it burn
Burn down in fire baby
Let it burn
Burn it down

Let me bang my head
Against the closest wall
I can't tell if I'm alive

I swear I did this shit
Already twice before
This kind of thing I can't ignore

Seems like my problems get a bit worse everyday
I've got no money so who cares anyways

Let it burn

Seems like my problems get a bit worse everyday
I've got no money so who cares anyways

Let it burn
Burn down in fire baby
Let it burn
Burn it down

Let it burn
Burn down in fire baby
Let it burn
Burn it down
