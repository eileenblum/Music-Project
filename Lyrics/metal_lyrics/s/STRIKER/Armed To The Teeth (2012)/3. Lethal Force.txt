Forget the future
The blood spills today
Weapons of war
Reduce us to clay

The clans fight in the night
Stepping into the light
The fire is raging

We're all shooting to kill
Do it just for the thrill
No one's worth saving

Oh
Lethal Force
Oh
Lethal Force

Countries destroyed
Reduced to ashes in the night
The winds of war are calling you
Beware

The clans fight in the night
Stepping into the light
The fire is raging

We're all shooting to kill
Do it just for the thrill
No one's worth saving

Oh
Lethal Force
Oh
Lethal Force
