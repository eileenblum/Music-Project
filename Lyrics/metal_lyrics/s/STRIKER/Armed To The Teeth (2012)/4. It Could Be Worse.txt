The pressure's building
It gets higher everyday
Close to insanity
And nothing goes your way
But you don't know
You don't have a clue
A lot of people on this earth
Are a lot worse off than you

No matter what
It could be worse
When you're falling down
So don't complain
Let it go
Just get back up

You push a boulder
Up a never ending hill
But across the ocean
Children are forced to kill
What do you know
You don't know shit
And I'm not perfect
But at least I'll never quit

No matter what
It could be worse
When you're falling down
So don't complain
Let it go
Just get back up

If everything was perfect
And everything was fine
You'd kick and scream
And still put up a fight
Fuck off
