It's a part of my soul
Like the air that I breath
And I'll never return
You and I were born to burn

Beyond your love
Beyond your life
Sound of the music will take you
Don't look back
Don't let go
It will control you forever

Forever

No matter the time
No matter the place
It's always been there for me
To set me free

Beyond your love
Beyond your life
Sound of the music will take you
Don't look back
Don't let go
It will control you forever

Beyond your love
Beyond your life
Sound of the music will take you
Don't look back
Don't let go
It will control you forever
