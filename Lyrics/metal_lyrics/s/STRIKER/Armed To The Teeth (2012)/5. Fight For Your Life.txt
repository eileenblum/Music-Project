So many faces
From different races
Come to meet as one
So many faces
From different places
Come to spill their blood into the sand

Fight for your life
Fight for your freedom
Or you'll never live again
Fight for your life
Fight for your freedom
Or you'll never see tomorrow

Is there a meaning
To the constant screaming
That haunts me in the night
I do what I have to
To keep myself alive
To see the traitors heart before my eyes

Fight for your life
Fight for your freedom
Or you'll never live again
Fight for your life
Fight for your freedom
Or you'll never see tomorrow

My path is chosen
My fate is set
I spill their blood
For your entertainment

Fight for your life
Fight for your freedom
Or you'll never live again
Fight for your life
Fight for your freedom
Or you'll never see tomorrow
