Out here we howl in the streets
Dangerous beasts on the prowl
Rampage with thunder and lightning
Eyes glow with fire
Midnight in leather
Cold steel, a flash in the night
Never back down from a fight

Hear us coming
Coming for your life
Hear us calling you
Out in the night
You'll feel the bite
You all live in fear of the Wolf Gang

The evil will spread like disease
Shadows our shields in the dark
Unchained the spell has been broken
Your time's running out
There's nowhere to hide
Walking in fire, destroyer of light
A servant, a child of the night

Hear us coming
Coming for your life
Hear us calling you
Out in the night
You'll feel the bite
You all live in fear of the Wolf Gang

Hear us coming
Coming for your life
Hear us calling you
Out in the night
You'll feel the bite

Hear us coming
Coming for your life
Hear us calling you
Out in the night
You'll feel the bite
You all live in fear of the Wolf Gang
