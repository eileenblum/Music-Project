Well look at you
You tell me I can't live this way
You'll never make it kid
Just give it up today

Well that ain't gonna happen
I'll never throw it all away
I'm like a loaded shotgun
So get the fuck out of my way

I never said it would be easy
But I'm never gonna quit
I never said I'd do the usual
Do it for the fun of it
So you can try and stop me
But I bet you never will
I'm on my way to the top
While you're standing still

We've had enough
This is the end
Try to break us we won't bend
No matter what
Your way of life will never save me no

You always try and drag me down
I won't let go
And I'm coming back for more
Save yourself
Cause I'm gonna take it all
All the way

Life is short enough
I won't wait 'til it's too late
I'm the master of my destiny
I don't believe in fate
Living for the danger
Running on the red line
One day you might catch me
Living on top of the world

We've had enough
This is the end
Try to break us we won't bend
No matter what
Your way of life will never save me no

You always try and drag me down
I won't let go
And I'm coming back for more
Save yourself
Cause I'm gonna take it all
All the way

We've had enough
This is the end
Try to break us we won't bend
No matter what
Your way of life will never save me

You had it all
You couldn't see
Don't tell me
What to believe
Cause you know it's coming fast
And we're gonna make it last

You always try and drag me down
I won't let go
And I'm coming back for more
Save yourself
Cause I'm gonna take it all
All the way
