Everyday
I'm looking over my shoulder
There's gotta be a better way
Cause these times couldn't get much colder
The price to pay
Is too high for me to gamble
And the pressure
Is too much to handle

Waiting 'til the time is right
Truth be told no end in sight

I'm locked in
I can't seem to get away
There's gotta be a better way

Lost on the road to riches
I'll never find my way back
Lost on the road to riches
I'm lost forever

Everyday
I'm feeling locked in
The outline
Is being chalked in

Waiting 'til the time is right
Truth be told no end in sight
