You can be the one
Who beats the odds
And you can tear it down
When you're rising up

You gotta find a way
Take it all
Find the strength to be the last man standing
Stronger than death
You want to be the best
The iron never lies
You want to test your strength
The iron never lies

I want to test the limits
The red line
Past the point of no return
On the front line

You gotta find a way
Take it all
Find the strength to be the last man standing
Stronger than death
You want to be the best
The iron never lies
You want to test your strength
The iron never lies
