Burning hearts
Old stars and new kings
From the very start
We learn to fly with broken wings

Outlaw
Let your true colours show
The feeling never dies

It's in my blood
I'll never change

Free spirit
Lost and never found
True power
Never backs down

Outlaw
Let your true colours show
The feeling never dies

It's in my blood
I'll never change
It's in my blood

I have heard the call
The feeling's here to stay
I won't let it get away

It never dies
No the feeling never dies
The fires strong the feeling never dies

It's in my blood
I'll never change
