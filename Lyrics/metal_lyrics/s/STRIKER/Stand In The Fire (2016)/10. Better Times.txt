We were young and restless
Running in and out of trouble
Those days I'll remember until the end
But life can change in a million ways
As time goes by we drift away

If there's a better time I can't remember
Good times with bad friends
I'll drink to that

We used to skate all day
And into the night
Without a care in the world
I can tell you one thing
We didn't care about nothing

It was a simple time
Living easy lives
It was over so fast
The good times don't last

If there's a better time I can't remember
Good times with bad friends
I'll drink to that

Those were better times

We were young and wild
Always looking for some action
All we have are the memories of a better time

No we'll never lose those days
They'll never fade away
But I'll never feel the same

If there's a better time I can't remember
Good times with bad friends
I'll drink to that
