I can't believe what I saw that night
And I still don't think I do
Strange lights are moving through the sky
Is this a dream is this the end

[CHORUS:]
I can see
The phoenix lights
Fly through the sky
Tell me why give me a reason

Or is it all just smoke and mirrors
And I know what I saw you can't tell me I'm crazy
The truth is out there I believe
You've got to set me free

[CHORUS]
