We held out through the bad times
To reach the other side
The old days like a past life
Like a drift in the tide

Tooth and nail
Still holding it down
And we still remain
United
Unbroken
Until the end

Some things never change
It's a hard life to live
Life's a journey not a ball and chain
That's why we won't give in

Tooth and nail
Still holding it down
And we still remain
United
Unbroken
Until the end

We're not going anywhere
Stuck in our ways
We ain't back cause we never left
We always stay the same

Tooth and nail
Still holding it down
And we still remain
United
Unbroken
Until the end
