It's a hard road to follow
If you're living for someone else
It's always tomorrow
You can't always trust yourself

Hard times
They come and go and shake you to your core
Land mines
The voices getting harder to ignore

Cutting down those who stand in the way
Stand in the fire and bring victory

Stick to your guns
Stand in the fire
Stick to your guns
Stand in the fire

You gotta do it for yourself
The rest will come in time
You won't survive
If you're trapped inside your mind

Hard times
They come and go and shake you to your core
Land mines
The voices getting harder to ignore

Cutting down those who stand in the way
Stand in the fire and bring victory

Stick to your guns
Stand in the fire
Stick to your guns
Stand in the fire
