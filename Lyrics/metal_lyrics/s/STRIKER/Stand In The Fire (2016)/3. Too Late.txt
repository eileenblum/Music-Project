The night is calling
Out in the streets again alone, alone
I was looking for you
But I can't see to find my way, my way

Too late to stay too late to go
Too hot to touch too cold to hold
Tonight's the night it's all the way
But she said to me

It's too late for love this time
It's such a fine line
It's too late for love this time
I can't get it right

If we meet in the middle
We will find the love tonight, again
I can feel it coming on so strong, so strong

Too late to stay too late to go
Too hot to touch too cold to hold
Tonight's the night it's all the way
But she said to me

It's too late for love this time
It's such a fine line
It's too late for love this time
I can't get it right
