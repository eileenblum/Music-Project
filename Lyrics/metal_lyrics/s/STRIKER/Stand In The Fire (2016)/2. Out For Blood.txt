You're out of control
Yeah you're putting your own life in danger
You're all on your own
And you're living your life like a stranger

You're crossing the line
And breaking the rules
Give me your badge and your gun
Because you're off the force for good

You know this time that it's personal
And I'll have revenge

He's out for blood

I don't care what you say
They killed my partner my only friend
This one is off the books
And I'm doing it my way

Living a life where too many die
Living a life where too many cry
Living your life and just getting by
Living a life where too many cry

You know this time that it's personal
And I'll have revenge

He's out for blood
