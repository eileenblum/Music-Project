You like to pass judgment
From on top of the throne
It can't always be that way

Why can't we see
That it just isn't right to have so much
When others have so little
Why can't we see
Do you think that it's right
Dreaming of what you want
When others can't even dream

Yesterdays wars
Are still haunting today
The crimes of the past are so far away
We thought that we could change
The future is walking away
We could help but we don't
It's a god damn shame

How can one life
Be worth more than another
How can hind sight
Be the only way we can see

You can see it
Written on the faces of the youth today
How can you care if you don't know
A generations worth of apathy

How can one life
Be worth more than another
How can hind sight
Be the only way we can see

The final hour of the iron fist
When nothings left
We'll eat the rich
