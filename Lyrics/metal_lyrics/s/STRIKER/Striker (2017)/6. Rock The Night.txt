You always seem to be on my mind
I can't let you go
I can't let you stay
You always seem to be a mystery to me
I can't let you go
I can't let you stay

The more that I think about you
The more that I know what to do

There's something out there and it's calling me
To rock the night
You've gotta bring them to their knees
There's something out there and it's calling me
To rock the night
Yeah you've got to make them see
What you can be

I don't know the reason why
It's just the way I feel
To rock the night away
Is all I've ever wanted
Way back when we started
Just some kids out on the run
A long time ago
You keep the dream alive

The more that I think about you
The more that I know what to do

There's something out there and it's calling me
To rock the night
You've gotta bring them to their knees
There's something out there and it's calling me
To rock the night
Yeah you've got to make them see
What you can be

You always seem to be a mystery to me
I can't let you go
I can't let you stay

The more that I think about you
The more that I know what to do

There's something out there and it's calling me
To rock the night
You've gotta bring them to their knees
There's something out there and it's calling me
To rock the night
Yeah you've got to make them see
What you can be
