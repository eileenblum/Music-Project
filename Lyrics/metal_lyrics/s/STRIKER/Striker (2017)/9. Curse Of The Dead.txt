The bringer of life
Is not the vision of man
Death is the only way out
Playing with madness
Awaken the dead
You might as well
Throw your life away

Fear in your eyes
Running in terror tonight
The curse of the dead
One fatal error
The spell can't be broken tonight
The curse of the dead

Lost in the chaos
Death biting your heels
Injection a toxic mistake
Into the darkness
You're spiralling down
The living dead rising form the grave

Fear in your eyes
Running in terror tonight
The curse of the dead
One fatal error
The spell can't be broken tonight
The curse of the dead

The bringer of life
Is not the vision of man
Death is the only way out
Playing with madness
Awaken the dead
You might as well
Throw your life away

Fear in your eyes
Running in terror tonight
The curse of the dead
One fatal error
The spell can't be broken tonight
The curse of the dead
