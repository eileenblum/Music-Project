No one has to tell me how to live my life
The rules you live by are not by choice
Your weakness is easy to see
You gotta keep that shit away from me

I don't need you t bring me down
Be yourself when I'm not around

No one has to tell me how to be myself
And I won't live my life for someone else
Your weakness is easy to see
You gotta keep that shit away from me

I don't need you to bring me down
Be yourself when I'm not around

You're negative so pass me by
You've got to find your inner strength and let it out
If you won't learn then you won't change
So in the end I cut the cord and let go

I don't need you to bring me down
Be yourself when I'm not around
