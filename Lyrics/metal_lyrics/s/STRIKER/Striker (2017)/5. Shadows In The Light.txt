Don't get caught
At the wrong place at the wrong time
Be afraid
You've got everything to lose
Murder, killer

Shadows dance in the light
Dancing in the light
Like flames in the night

Don't get caught
At the wrong place at the wrong time
Be afraid
You've got everything to lose

When you feel their eyes
On your back
Like so many times before
You're losing track
No one's out to get you
You're paranoid
But all your trust
Has already been destroyed

Murder it's murder
Now your castle starts to fall
Killer You're a killer
You went too far
Into the night

Shadows dance in the light
Dancing in the light
Like flames in the night

Don't get caught
At the wrong place at the wrong time
Life in fear
A wrong move and it's showtime

I feel the pressure coming down on me
Get no protection from my enemies
If they're not serving you then there're not serving me
Too many people still refuse to see

The shadows dancing in the light
Like fire dancing in the night

Shadows dance in the light
