I don't want to feel compelled to question everything
You hear so many lies and see so many different things
The world around me can't and won't be my reality
I want to follow my own path
Use my own eyes to see

I don't wan't
To feel like
A prisoner
Lost in time

There is no second chance
When you get up there it's a long way down
I'm hearing freedom's call

There's too many people who just can't seem to agree
No one wants to hear the words that other people say
The whole system is just rotten to the core
Those like you and me are left always wanting more

I don't wan't
To feel like
A prisoner
Lost in time

There is no second chance
When you get up there it's a long way down
I'm hearing freedom's call

I just want to be free
Free as an open sky I just want to be free
Free from the secrets and lies
