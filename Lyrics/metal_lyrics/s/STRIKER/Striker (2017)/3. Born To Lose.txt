See things in a different way
Always been the one to say
I'm ready to take a leap of faith
Born to lose live to win
Back in for another swing
Sending chills down my spine
Going across the line

Born to lose
But I'm living to win

Time to change my state of mind
Broken down and left behind
It's not the way it's gonna be
I've been down been counted out
Hear the voices start to shout
Feels like the world is on your shoulders

Born to lose
But I'm living to win

Can't you see, I'm living free
You can't cage me, I'm born to lose but I'm living free

Born to lose
But I'm living to win
