I've been dreaming and I can see it now
But I can never stop
I've been working for so long
To make it to the top

But they say it's too far
It's too late
It's too hard
And it's a mistake
You can't and you won't
There's no way
So just don't

Over and over they tell me to stop
I'll show them the power
Go over the top

Here in the front row
With something to prove

But it feels so far
So far away
When you're the underdog
You've gotta fight another day

All the hard times
I left in the past
Made me who I am
And all the all the nights
I made it through
To see the other side

Over and over they tell me to stop
I'll show them the power
Went over the top

Here in the front row
With something to prove

But it feels so far
So far away
When you're the underdog
You've gotta fight another day
