Don't want to think about it
'Cause that was yesterday 
Tomorrow brings more opportunity
I know I aid it before
But this time it's real
Yesterday has never seemed so far away

Do what it takes
To leave the past behind
Do what it takes
To put it all on the line

It's the return to my former glory
Yeah I'm back again

Feeling down and out
But that's the price I pay
All I needed was a light to lead the way
And now I'm back on top
It's like I never left
It feels so good to be back on track again

Do what it takes
To leave the past behind
Do what it takes
To put it all on the line

It's the return to my former glory
Yeah I'm back again
