Oh my light, give my star a fate
Once my heart filled with hatred
Was cured by your ice cold rays
No more wishing death, just obeying your will

Their life is not a life to your eyes
Their faith is a vain call in the night
Through their world my god it dies
I will kill again to end their lies

Only one truth it was written
Only one face for your flame
Only one hand to give the hell
Only my hand to end their flesh

Their life is not a life to your eyes
Their faith is a vain call in the night
Through their world my god it dies
I will kill again to end their lies

Life is a sin
How heaven can be
If not enduring the pain
Suffocating in the rain
You are not owning the world
You are nothing through his words

I am the reminder
For you to remember
You will die by my hand
Yet the will is higher
And the angels just stand
Enjoying the murder
