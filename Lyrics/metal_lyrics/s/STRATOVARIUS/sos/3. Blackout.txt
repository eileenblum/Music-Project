[Scorpions cover]

I realize i missed a day
But I'm too wrecked to care anyway
I look around and see this face
What the hell have i lost my taste
Don't want to find out
Just want to cut out

My head explodes, my ears ring
I can't remember just where I've been
The last thing that i recall
I got lost in a deep black hole
Don't want to find out
Just want to cut out

Blackout
I really had a blackout

Blackout
I really had a blackout

Blackout
I really had a blackout

Blackout
I really had a blackout

I grab my things and make my run
On the way out, another one
Would like to know before i stop
Did i make it or did i flop
Don't want to find out
Just want to get out

Blackout
I really had a blackout

Blackout
I really had a blackout

Blackout
I really had a blackout

Blackout
I really had a blackout

Don't want to find out
Just want to get out

Blackout
I really had a blackout!
