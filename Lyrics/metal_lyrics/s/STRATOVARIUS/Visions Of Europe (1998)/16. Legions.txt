Far in the core of the earth
First it was given birth
We heard the call the message was so clear
The tracks were laid for the future to come

Sons and daughters of the Rising sun
The armies in Europe here we come
We run like the wind we play from the heart
Now we are here together we sing

Faster than light higher than the sky
Tonight we're together again
Never give up and never give in
Stronger than steel we're the legions of the Twilight

We survived the hard times
Never accepted the lies
You run like the wind you sing from the heart
Now that we're here together we'll sing

Faster than light higher than the sky
Tonight we're together again
Never give up and never give in
Stronger than steel we're the legions of the Twilight

When we have to go back home again
We'll keep the mem'ries we gained inside our hearts

Raise your hands for us!
