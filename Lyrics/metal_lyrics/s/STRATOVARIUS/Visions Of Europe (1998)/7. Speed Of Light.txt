Today is just an other day
Of my life too short to live
I should have some kind of meaning
A destiny to believe in
Before I go to sleep

I find some pictures of a time
When everything was still so fine
Although the years have passed by
I will give it all I have inside...everything

I'm away lost in my thoughts
Everyday my life goes by
At the speed of light
