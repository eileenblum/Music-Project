I'm entering in to the woods
I left everything behind
I have to follow my heart
Don't know what I'm looking for
Starlights guiding my way
To old black oak where we meet
Now it's full moon

Other side is calling me
Singing dancing this is no dream
Twilight Symphony

The feast is going on
Rapture never seen before
The fury is taking us
Into a new level soon
Hearing voices everywhere
Telling me what to do
Giving me answers

Other side is calling me
Singing dancing this is no dream
Twilight Symphony

The spirits are calling me
I only wish to die
There is no question why
Anymore
