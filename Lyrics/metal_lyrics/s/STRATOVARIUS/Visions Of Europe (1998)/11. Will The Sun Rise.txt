Throwing my dreams out of my mind
Casting them into the sky
Canceling tasks I've delayed for so long
Now it's do or die

I can't be seen I can't be heard
But I am here and I am wondering

Will the sun rise tomorrow
Will it light up my sky
Can I wake up with no sorrow awaiting
Will the sun rise tomorrow
Will I still see the dawn
And not worry 'bout the future anymore

At the end of each day I promise myself
I'd better start to live
Cause sooner or later I'll find out
There's so much I can give
I can't be seen I can't be heard
But I am here and I am wondering

Will the sun rise tomorrow
Will it light up my sky
Can I wake up with no sorrow awaiting
Will the sun rise tomorrow
Will I still see the dawn
And not worry 'bout the future anymore
