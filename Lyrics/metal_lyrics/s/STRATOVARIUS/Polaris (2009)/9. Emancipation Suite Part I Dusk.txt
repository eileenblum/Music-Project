I'm staring at the last rays of the sun,
The final night's begun
Shadows fall and hide the earth beneath them
My land has fallen deep into the hands
Of men with evil plans
Times have gone, when peace reigned over our lands

It's time to break these chains and head to freedom
It wont be long I swear to you
I will see I will be I'll be free
A new day will be dawning

Emancipation - I will break free
Determination - Just leave me be

Into the darkness I have been confined
The last one of my kind
Wayward soul still fighting to be set free

It's time to break these chains and head to freedom
It wont be long I swear to you
I will see, I will be, I'll be free
A new day will be dawning

Emancipation - I will break free
Determination - Just leave me be
