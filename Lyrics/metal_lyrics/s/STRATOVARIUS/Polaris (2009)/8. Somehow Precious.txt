Yesterday
Seems so far away
Some projection in a dream
Sweaty sheets
I am back to reality
I walk out to my own scream

All the bad things that were said
Will not leave me be
I need to get them out of my head

What have I said?
What have I done?
Can I have another chance?
What I said late
No one has won

Give me a glance
don't deny
That I am somehow precious to you

And today
I still feel the same
Even though you are so near
I try to talk
my lips are whispering now your name
but the words have seem to disappear

All the bad things that I said
Will not leave me be
Once again I'm all alone in my bed

What have I said?
What have I done?
Can I have another chance?
What I said late
No one has won

Give me a glance
Don't deny
That I am somehow precious to you

What have I said?
What have I done?
Can I have another chance?
What I said late
No one has won

Give me a glance
Don't deny
That I am somehow precious to you
That I am somehow precious to you
