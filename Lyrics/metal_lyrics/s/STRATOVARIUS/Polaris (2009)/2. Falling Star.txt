Feel the night time growing nearer
From amidst the darkness I will start my flight
See the stars are shining clearer
Turn around before you're blinded by the light

I am made of burning flame, cast from coldest ice
There is nothing that can stop me

Now I ride above the sky, it cannot hold me back
I dive within the deepest darkest space
See I vanish in the light, you cannot find me there
No one can ever catch the falling star

Feel the heat is growing stronger
Everything that's in my way will be destroyed
See my journey's growing longer
For eternity I'm doomed within the void

I am made of burning flame, cast from coldest ice
There is nothing that can stop me

Now I ride above the sky, It cannot hold me back
I dive within the deepest darkest space
See I vanish in the light, you cannot find me there
No one can ever catch the falling star

Now I ride above the sky, It cannot hold me back
I dive within the deepest darkest space
See I vanish in the light, you cannot find me there
No one can ever catch the falling star
