Taking a chance
Go again
To the great unknown

Facing your fears and feel
what's on your mind when you're alone

Fall into the sea
So you will be free
Into the deep
You disappear

Dive deeper into the ocean
You'll find more about your emotions
As you go far beyond imaginary borderlines
Into the deep unknown---

Need to breath, might drown
You can't inhale
No one around, sliding down
Time passes by, you can not fail

As light fades away
There's so much to gain
You're holding on
It's not in vain

Dive deeper into the ocean
You'll find more about your emotions
As you go far beyond imaginary borderlines

Dive deeper into the ocean
You'll find more about your emotions
As you go far beyond imaginary borderlines
