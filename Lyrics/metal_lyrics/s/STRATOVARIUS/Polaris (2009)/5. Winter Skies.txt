Walking by a frozen lake
Silent snow in the air
Dreaming of the summer day
Carry me till I'm there

Winter skies, leave me alone
When I lose my way
Winter skies you call me home
Winter skies, leave me alone
When I lose my way
Winter skies you call me home

Bring me back when I am lost
Far from your embrace
Bring me silence, bring me frost
Your familiar face

Winter skies, leave me alone
When I lose my way, northern star
You call me home

Winter skies, leave me alone
When I lose my way
Northern land
You are my home

Winter skies, leave me alone
When I lose my way
Northern land
You are my home
