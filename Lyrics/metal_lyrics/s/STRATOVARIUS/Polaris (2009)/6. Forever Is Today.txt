I'm dreaming awake,
My thoughts won't let me go
Feels like my mind has turned into my foe
The fear of tomorrow,
The fear of today
I'm trying to stay,
I'm trying to run away

My life is at stake,
My time is running out
Feels like I live my life in constant doubt
The fear of tomorrow,
The fear of today
I'm trying to stay,
I'm trying to run away

Each moment shall pass,
Will never return
Your fate is what you make of it
So seize your day

I will waste no more time
Leave my worries behind
I live for this moment alone
Let me tell you my friend,
All things come to an end
Forever is today
So don't delay

I will waste no more time,
Leave my worries behind
I live for this moment alone
Let me tell you my friend,
All things come to an end
Forever is today
So don't delay
