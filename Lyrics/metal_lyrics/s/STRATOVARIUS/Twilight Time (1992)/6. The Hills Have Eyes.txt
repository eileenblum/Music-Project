[Music &amp; Words by Tolkki/Lassila]

Come with me my child
It's gonna take a little while
To teach you the knowledge
Of the ancient rhyme
Fly with me tonight
Through the cosmic sea
It's a mystery

From the thirst for life
You will never keep away
Pleasure of one man
Makes another man a prey
Fly with me tonight
Through the cosmic sea
It's a mystery

The hills have eyes
mind your step you'll better be wise
Or you never rise again
The hills have eyes
never forgive nor compromise
You fail in vain
