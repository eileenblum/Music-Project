[Music &amp; Words by Tolkki/Lassila]

The time is running
It's running so fast that you don't notice
Years are passing by
And you're growing older
What happened to all your dreams?
Did they become true at all?

We cannot undo the deeds of the years
They leave you on your own
With all your deepest fears

Don't look for the future
Don't live in the past
Just take it day by day 'cause life goes fast
The minutes, the hours
The days and the years will fly so
Live still when you have the time

We cannot undo the deeds of the years
They leave you on your own
With all your deepest fears

Wheel of the time
Turns again tonight
Eternally decides our destiny
Wheel of the time
Turns again tonight
Without reason or rhyme

The hands of time
