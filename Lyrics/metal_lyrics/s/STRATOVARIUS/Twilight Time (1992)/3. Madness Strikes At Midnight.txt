[Words &amp; Music by Tolkki]

He's crawling out from the asylum
Under cover of the night
Insanity of his crazy mind
It's useless for you now to hide
Walking the streets someone's in sight
He's waiting for you in the night
Hiding in the shadows
Hiding in the alleys
He's ready to kill tonight

So lock your doors and hide
And pray your god 'cause you're not alone

Years he spent in the cage
They did not help him at all
Now today with the power of his rage
He's slaughtering people tonight
Walking the streets someone's in sight
He's waiting for you in the night
Hiding in the shadows
Hiding in the alleys
He's ready to kill tonight

So lock your doors and hide
And pray your god 'cause you're not alone

Madness strikes at midnight
Madness strikes at night
