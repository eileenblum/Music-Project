[Lyrics and Music by Jens Johansson]

Crocodile tears from industrial giants,
apologies counting for nothing
Graveyard obssessions and shallow confessions,
The game never ends in a draw.

An eternal horizon that reaches the sky
When we're standing together, we cannot ever die
And we're chasing the darkness away with our cry,
Never die, never die,
We never die.

Fragile and cold by the side of a mountain,
Big hopelessness bearing to promise,
Brothers and sisters of metal together
We'll conquer the evil as one!

An eternal horizon that reaches the sky
When we're standing together, we cannot ever die
And we're chasing the darkness away with our cry,
Never die, never die,
We never die.

[Solo â Jens]

An eternal horizon that reaches the sky
When we're standing together, we cannot ever die
And we're chasing the darkness away with our cry,
Never die, never die,
We never die.
