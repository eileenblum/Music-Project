[Lyrics by Timo Kotipelto. Music by Matias Kupiainen]

[Computer:] Warning! Event horizon ahead. Warning!

Standing outside
In darkness my breath is steaming
The sky's open wide
I hear the silent screaming

Deep in the dark, somewhere in space
Spinning around, leaving no trace

Nothing escapes
And the boundary's been breached
All matter and shape
Destination's reached

A star dies, collapsing in its core
End of the journey, it won't be seen anymore

I can see the point of no return
And when the light is slowly turning to red
Light years away, there is no concern
A force of gravity, event horizon lies ahead

[Solo â Matias / Duet / Jens / Duet]

[Computer:] Alert! Destination's reached

I can see the point of no return
And when the light is slowly turning to red
Light years away, there is no concern
A force of gravity, event horizon lies ahead

I can see the point of no return
And when the light is slowly turning to red
Light years away, there is no concern
A force of gravity, event horizon lies ahead

[Computer:] Warning!  Imaginable impact. Please evacuate immediately.
