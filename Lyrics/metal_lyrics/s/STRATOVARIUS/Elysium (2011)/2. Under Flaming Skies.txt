[Lyrics by Timo Kotipelto and Matias Kupiainen. Music by Timo Kotipelto]

The wind is blowing
There's ashes in the air
The heat is flowing
You stare in despair

Hear the warning
The times are changing fast
The Earth is crying
With a thundering blast

You feel the ground's quaking
The powers unknown are released
The dams breaking
The fear's increased

Bring on the night
A shelter from light
The skies are burning
Bring on the night
Hide from the light
The winds are turning
You're under flaming skies

The sacred fire
Is spreading, destroying all
The exploding spire
Will finally fall

You feel the ground's quaking
The powers unknown are released
The dams breaking
The fear's increased

Bring on the night
A shelter from light
The skies are burning
Bring on the night
Hide from the light
The winds are turning
You're under flaming skies

[Bridge]

Bring on the night
A shelter from light
The skies are burning
Bring on the night
Hide from the light
The winds are turning
You're under flaming skies

Bring on the night, the skies are burning
Bring on the night, the winds are turning
You're under flaming skies
