[Lyrics by Timo Kotipelto. Music by Matias Kupiainen]

I thought I could not find
Someone who's so alike
The way you think, I feel it in my heart

It is so hard to see
What's happening to me
Two souls uniting and can't be apart

All these lonely nights and days let me scarred

Waiting all my life
This feeling
I have been denied
I'm redeeming
Heavenly divine
Awareness purified
Awaken in the night
I've been dreaming
Waited for a sign
I've seen it
Heavenly divine
Some fairness will finally be
Justified

If there's a past life
I know you've been all mine
You are forever the one, divine

All these lonely nights and days let me scarred

Waiting all my life
This feeling
I have been denied
I'm redeeming
Heavenly divine
Awareness purified
Awaken in the night
I've been dreaming
Waited for a sign
I've seen it
Heavenly divine
Some fairness will finally be
Justified

[Solo â Matias]

I'm watching when you sleep
And listen as you breathe
I'm close to you and keep you warm

Waiting all my life
This feeling
I have been denied
I'm redeeming
Heavenly divine
Awareness purified
Awaken in the night
I've been dreaming
Waited for a sign
I've seen it
Heavenly divine
Some fairness will finally be
Justified
