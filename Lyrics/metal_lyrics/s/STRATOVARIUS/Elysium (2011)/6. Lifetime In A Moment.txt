[Lyrics and Music by Lauri Porra]

"Omnia sol temperat, purus et subtilis.
Novo mundo reserat faciem Aprilis"

From the dark, I watch you go away
I will never see you...
Again

Every passing day prolongs my pain
I am slowly fading...
Into the void

Voice without a sound
A sound that no one cares to hear
A second round to live your life
Just passed away

Moment in a lifetime
Lifetime in a moment

Seize the say, don't let it slip...
Away
Cherish every moment...
Before it's gone

Voice without a sound
A sound that no one cares to hear
A second round to live your life
Just passed away
Moment in a lifetime
Lifetime in a moment

[Solo â Matias]

Moment in a lifetime
Lifetime in a moment

Moment in a lifetime
Lifetime in a moment
