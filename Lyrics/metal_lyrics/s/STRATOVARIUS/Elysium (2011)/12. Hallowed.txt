[Bonus track]

Once they countdown the final dream,
Life will never be the same.
Due to blindness they cannot see,
That we cannot starve this way.

They will stop when it's too late,
Just to realize, you cannot eat money.

Whoaaaaaa.
Time is running out,
Runaway (Runaway) (Runaway),
World is burning down.

When the earth turns to black from greed,
When the last drop of water has been spent.

They will stop when it's too late,
Just to realize, you cannot eat money, so....

Whoaaaaaa.
Time is running out,
Runaway (Runaway) (Runaway),
World is burning down.

[Guitar solo]

Whoaaaaaa.
Time is running out,
Runaway (Runaway) (Runaway),
World is burning down.

Time is running out,
Runaway (Runaway) (Runaway),
World is burning down.
