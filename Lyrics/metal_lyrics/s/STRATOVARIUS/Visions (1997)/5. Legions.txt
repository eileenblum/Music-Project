[Music: Tolkki / Lyrics: Kotipelto]

Far in the core of the earth,
First it was given birth.
We heard the call the message was so clear.
The tracks were laid for the future to come.

Sons and daughters of the Rising Sun,
The armies in Europe here we come.
We run like the wind, we play from the heart,
Now we are here together we sing.

Faster than light,
Higher than the sky,
Tonight we're together again.
We never give up, never give in,
Stronger than steel
We're the legions of the twilight.

Battle of the day

We survived the hard times,
Never accepted the lies,
You run like the wind, you sing from the heart.
Now that we're here together we'll sing.

Faster than light...
Higher than the sky,
Tonight we're together again.
We never give up, never give in,
Stronger than steel
We're the legions of the twilight.

Battle of the day

When we have to go back home again,
We'll keep the mem'ries we gained inside our hearts.

[2x]
Faster than light,
Higher than the sky,
Tonight we're together again.
We never give up, never give in,
Stronger than steel
We're the legions of the twilight

Battle of the day
Battle of the day

Legions of the twilight
Legions of the twilight

Raise your hands for us!
