[Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Kotipelto]

I feel like I'm drowning, trying to catch my breath.
Don't know what is happening, there's no sense of time.

Deep underneath my skin, feeling the pain within, hear my cry...
I feel drowned towards you, I can't resist, I don't know why.
My life is changing, I cannot recall...

Where I've been before, the abyss of your eyes,
meaning so much more, am I losing my mind?..

The sun isn't shining, your eyes light my way,
I've found what I've been searching for, my love won't go astray.

Deep underneath my skin, feeling the pain within, hear my cry...

I feel drowned towards you, I can't resist, I don't know why.
My life is changing I cannot recall...

Where I've been before, the abyss of your eyes,
Meaning so much more, am I lost?..

So many years my drifting heart has wandered around,
Don't turn on me, won't you stay by my side?..

I've found... where I've been before, the abyss of your eyes,
Meaning so much more, am I losing my mind...
