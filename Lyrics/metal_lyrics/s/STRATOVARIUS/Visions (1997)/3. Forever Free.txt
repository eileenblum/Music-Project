[Music:Tolkki/Lyrics:Kotipelto]

They try to give me answers to questions I've never asked.
I'll have no part in their conspiracy.
I guess I am the kind of guy that will never stray.
The thing I need is privacy, some guiding, depriving, misleading and combining.
They're watching our every move.
They can try to bind our arms, but they can't chain our minds or hearts.
We will keep our faith inside our souls and never let it go
We're Forever Free
You see them making headlines, new pictures tell old stories,
explaining what they have said and done.
Media's new illusion, creating more confusion
but I know that they'll soon be gone.
