Don't fear the darkness
Let it find you if it must
Open the door and
Embrace the sadness

Pain won't stain you
It will only make you strong
Hurt won't haunt you
But lead you where you belong

Let your grief fade away
He's a guest, not here to stay
For one more day

Keep the flame, let it burn
Through the night let it shine
A light divine

For few are those who
See with their own eyes
Few who feel with their own hearts
And few are those who
Reach for the stars and
Few who do more than their part

Let the daylight wipe away your fears
For this is your life
And nothing can hold you back

Take a moment
Take a breath and start again
You're not broken
And it can't rain all the time

Keep the flame, let it burn
Through the night let it shine
A light divine

For few are those who
See with their own eyes
Few who feel with their own hearts
And few are those who
Reach for the stars and
Few who do more than their part

For few are those who
See with their own eyes
Few who feel with their own hearts
And few are those who
Reach for the stars and
Few who do more than their part

For few are those who
See with their own eyes
Few who feel with their own hearts
And few are those who
Reach for the stars and
Few who do more than their part
