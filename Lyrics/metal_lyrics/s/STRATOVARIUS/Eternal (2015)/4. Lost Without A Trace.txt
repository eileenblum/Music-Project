I can't explain the way I feel sometimes
The loss of words, the chaos in my mind
It seems like I can only bring you pain
The passion fades away
Like tears in the rain

And every time you try to reach for me
I feel afraid, I feel Iâm in too deep
It's not your fault we ended up this way
It's just that I can't be
What you want from me

I must walk away again

[Chorus:]
You will never see me
You will never hear me calling out your name again
Iâm out of words to say so Iâll stay away
You will never heal me
You will never feel my touch upon your skin, your face
For Iâ
I'm lost without a trace

I did not want to fight, not make you cry
I was too weak, the time was not right
I hope one day you can forgive me
For everything I've done
How I let you down

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus 2x]
