Sometimes it's not that easy finding all the words
For how I feel when you are near
The more we are together makes me realize
All I ever wanted is you

What can I say?
You make all my dreams come true
And every day I want you right here by my side
To take my hand and hold me tight
I never want to be alone again

Oh my love

The days are shorter now
I'm reaching for some light
And I find it in your eyes
Brighter than the sun it filled me up with love
Don't ever close them for me

What can I say?
You make all my dreams come true
And every day I want you right here by my side
To take my hand and hold me tight
I never want to be alone again

Oh my love

Yes I know baby
It takes a world to keep what we have
And not let go
I was lonely
Before I met you
But you wiped away all the sorrow

What can I say?
You make all my dreams come true
And every day I want you right here by my side
To take my hand and hold me tight
I never want to be alone again

What can I say?
You make all my dreams come true
And every day I want you right here by my side
To take my hand and hold me tight
I never want to be alone again

Oh my love
