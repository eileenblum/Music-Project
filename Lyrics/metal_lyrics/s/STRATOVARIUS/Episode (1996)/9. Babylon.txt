[Words &amp; Music by Tolkki]

A new day is rising in ancient Babylon
Revealing mysteries to see
and the endless caravan
never ending it's journey
with the wings of the wind I will fly
I can hear you calling me
I am blind but I see

Babylon
your memory haunts me forever
won't leave me be
Babylon
your glory's stronger than ever
for all to see

Centuries have passed by
but your memory still lives on
In the minds of those who see
Under the summer moon
there comes a sight
that stays with me forever
I can hear you calling me
I am blind but I see

Babylon your memory haunts me forver
won't leave me be
Babylon
your glory's stronger that ever
for all to see

And underneath the starlit sky
I feel so strong I'll never die
I'm on this road to Eternity
My soul will live forever - I'm free
