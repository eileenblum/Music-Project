[Music by Tolkki, Words by Kotipelto]

Throwing my dreams out of my mind
casting them into the sky
canceling tasks I've delayed for so long
now it's do or die

I can't be seen I can't be heard
but I am here and I am wondering

Will the sun rise tomorrow
will it light up my sky
can I wake up with no sorrow awaiting
Will the sun rise tomorrow
will I still see the dawn
and not worry 'bout the future anymore

At the end of each day I promise myself
I'd better start to live
coz sooner or later I'll find out
there's so much I can give
I can't be seen I can't be heard
but I am here and I am wondering

Will the sun rise tomorrow
will it light up my sky
can I wake up with no sorrow awaiting
will the sun rise tomorrow
will I still see the dawn
and not worry 'bout the future anymore
