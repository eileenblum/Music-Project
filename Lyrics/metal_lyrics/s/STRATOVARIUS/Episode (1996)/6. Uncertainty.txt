[Music &amp; Words by Kotipelto]

Learning by trying it's hard to deny it
while paying for what I used to know
Dreams are deceiving untill I'm achieving
the goals I haven't set too low

Waiting for a new day
to wipe away
the Uncertainty that flows around me
once again to stay

So many choices but so few answers
my time slips away while thinking too much
Whom to believe in they're all just repeating
the same old lies so nice to clutch

Waiting for a new day
to wipe away
the Uncertainty that flows around me
once again to stay
