Drifted apart on the sea of life
Sailing to new horizons out of sight
We lost the way, we lost the key
But the spirit was kept alive and free

United we stand
Divided we fall
Our destiny's here tonight with you all
Through wind and thunder we sail to your shore
We will not give up so open the door

Cause we're united
We stand united

It's good to look in the eyey of a friend
And shake his hand and thank him for the years
And it's great to see you all here
Together again calling you

United we stand
Divided we fall
Our destiny's here tonight with you all
Through wind and thunder we sail to your shore
We will not give up so open the door

United we stand
Divided we fall
The sun is shining for each and for all
The future is brighter
There's hope in the air
Together we're singing together we dare
