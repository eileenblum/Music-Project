Look around turn around
You just might fall to the ground
Sail away break away
Damage done nothing to say
All my life I've felt like an outcast
But not anymore, a thing of the past
Feel the sun, got to run
Feels like life has just begun
All is new, different view
so many things that I will do
I'm leaving behind the things I don't need
and with confidence I'm planting the seed

I'm still alive
I'm ready to feel the wind in my hair
And I know there are so many things to share
I will write my story again
Masterplan of a new kind
I was lost but now I'm found
I'm still alive
