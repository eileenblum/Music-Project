I am the earth and sky
I am the low and high
I am the snowflake in the winter evening
I am the birth and death
I am your final breath
I am the one that gave you life and freedom
Choosing your own way

Everything you've ever known
Every seed that you have sown
Came from me I made you
My creation is supreme
This is all my perfect dream
No mistakes in God's great perfect cosmic play

I am the Alpha I am the Omega
I am the beginning and the end of time
I am the Alpha I am the Omega
My whole creation stands before me tonight

I am the dark and light
I am the day and night
I am the mirage
I am the echo
I am the fear and anger
I am a familiar stranger
I am the shadow I m a star that guides you
Until the end of time.
