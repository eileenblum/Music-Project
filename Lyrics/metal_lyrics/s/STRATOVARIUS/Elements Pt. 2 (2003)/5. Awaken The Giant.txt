I'm staring at the wall
Sick and tired of all
Manic depression makes me crawl
It makes me small
I need some peace of mind
The pressure makes me blind
The labyrinth of pain, the exit I must find
It's all inside of me, the answers lie within
And all that I can win I take for myself
I'm the one who holds the key
To all that I can be
My spirit yearns for truth,
It's learning to be free

Through the years
I was doing things the wrong way
But now I've changed it is time to say

Awaken the giant
Don't let it sleep
Awaken the giant
Look deep within

I won't give up the fight
Until I see the light
I won't give in
To the gloominess of life
The end is in my sight
In the middle of darkest night
I see my future's bright
I'm reaching for new heights
