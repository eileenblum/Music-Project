Sun is shining
Sky is so blue
I'm filled with hope
It's promising
The course my life is taking
Searching of my truth has brought me here
Facing things with confidence
That all will be OK
Past is gone
Life goes on
Memories remain
I break the chain of misery and pain

Marching to a different drum
Shines my liberty
It's growing stronger every day
I feel it in me
Leading me to a different world
Freedom shows the way
It's there for you and me to find
It's heaven on earth

I'm standing here today and understand
There is no reason to hide anymore
So many things to see so many things to gain
My life is not in vain
