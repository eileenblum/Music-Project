[Tolkki]

You found the truth again
I showed the way
The Path of Wisdom is the only way to reality
You learned to live Your life
The hard way
Your tears put out the fire from your soul

Lost behind the lies I can hear your cries
Now is the time to rise again so strong

Learn from your past
But better make it fast
The time is running out for you to change your life

You must learn to live
There's so much to give
Set Fire to your soul again and be... The Rebel
Hold your head up proud
