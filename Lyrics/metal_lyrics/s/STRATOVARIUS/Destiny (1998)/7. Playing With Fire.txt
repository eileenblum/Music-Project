[Tolkki - Kotipelto]

Hunger grows stronger I feel it day by day
I need I desire her passion now
I see that look the shine in her eyes
Can't let her go she's so divine
There's no one who could stop me now
She'll be mine

She's teasing I'm unfreezing wanting more and more
I'm dreaming just like streaming through the door
I see that look ...

Playing With Fire
Hiding inside the flames
Playing With Fire
It's a dangerous game
