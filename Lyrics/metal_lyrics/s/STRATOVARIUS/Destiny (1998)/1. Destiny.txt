[Tolkki]

The times are changing so fast
I wonder how long it lasts
The clock is ticking time is running out
The hatred fills this Earth
And for what is worth
We're in the end before we know

Throughout the years
I have struggled to find the answer that
I never knew
It strucked me like a million lightnings
And here I am telling to you

Every second of day it is coming your way
Future unknown is here to stay
Got to open your mind
of you will be led to astray
There's a time to live
There`s a time to die
But no one can`t escape the Destiny

Look all these things we`ve done
Under the burning Sun
Is this the way to carry on?
So take a look at yourself
And tell me what do you see
A wolf in clothes of the Lamb?

Throughout the ....

Every second ...

Let your spirit free
Through Window of your Mind
Unchain your Soul from hate
All you need is Faith

I control my Life
I am the One
You control your Life
But don't forget Your Destiny....

It's time to say goodbye
I know it will make you cry
You make your Destiny
I know you'll find the way
And outside Sun is bright
The things will be alright
I will be back one day to you
So please Wait For ME
