[Tolkki]

The setting sun creates another world
The shadows fall another day is in the end
The Paradise is sleeping peacefully
And one more day is again history

Tell me can we go on like this?
Everybody is living in a bliss
Are these the last times of our Mother Earth?
Or is it just beginning of new Birth?

Don't be afraid we must be wise
Patient and peaceful and strong
Maybe it's like you would throw the dice
Then hope that nothing goes wrong
Remember that you have the right to say
All things that you feel inside
Open your mind and you open your eyes
Together now is the time

Sing the Anthem Of The World
But will we ever learn
To control our hate and to forgive
We must learn to find the way
To just live another day
And be free like an Eagle in the sky

How about if God just let us down?
If he just is polishing his crown?
What's the key to the Universe?
Is life down here just one big endless curse?

Don't be afraid...

Sing the Anthem Of The World....
