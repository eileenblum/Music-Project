[Music and words: Tolkki]

No Christ, God nor religion
Gave me the answers I was looking for
Arrogant hypocrites
Selling the key to heaven's door

I've got my own way
I don't care what you say
You speak your truth and I speak mine

Find your own voice
Unleash the power within
Go find your own truth and let (the) others be
Let your own light guide your way through life
Find your own way
Make your own paradise

Find your own voice
It's your own choice

Find your own voice
Unleash the power within
Go find your own truth and let (the) others be
Let your own light guide your way through life
Find your own way
Make your own paradise

Find your own voice
It's your own choice
Find your own voice
It's your own choice
