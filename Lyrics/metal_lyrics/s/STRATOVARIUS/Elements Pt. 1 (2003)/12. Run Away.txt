[Special edition bonus CD track]

Run the other way
Wipe your tears away
The pain is here to stay
Nothing in the way
Take the clouds away
There's nothing more to say
There's nothing more to say

Run away
I will remember you
Run away
I will remember 'til I die

Never wanna die
Drowning in the sky
Like rats who left the trap
Was it just a game
Only doubts remain
We're drowning in the pain.

Run away
I will remember you
Run away
I will remember 'til I die
