[Music and words: Tolkki]

Welcome to my world
Close the gates
You've come from far away
I've been expecting you
You are the holders of the key
To the story that never ends

Fantasia
Resides deep in your heart
Leave your worries far behind
Fantasia
Let the freedom ring the bell
Let us all unite
Borders made of hate are gone
Nations singing the song of peace
In Fantasia

How would it be? A world without hate
Without heaven, without hell
No wars, no arms, no religion, no God
Just your own truth

(Fantasia can arise in you)

Fear and darkness prevail
But finally they will fail

Fantasia
Resides deep in your heart
Leave your worries far behind
Fantasia
Let the freedom ring the bell
Let us all unite
Borders made of hate are gone
Nations singing the song of peace
Fantasia

Fantasia
One day when love conquers all
Mankind will prevail
No more jealousy
Fantasia
No more envy no deceit
The nothing is gone
Future's bright and glorious
We are all victorious
We are kings in Fantasia
