[Japanese bonus track]

Sometimes I just want to lie in your lap and dive into deep blue.
When the world's too much too bear, to get a way I dive into deep blue.
The ocean of your eyes, I sink into the mystery tonight.
Into deep blue.

When reality is hard I have a place to go, into deep blue.
When I'm not wanted and I'm down, everytime I go into deep blue.
The river of my tears, all my nightmares, my deepest fears.
Into deep blue.

The sun is shining, I feel so fine.
I live my life, it's only mine.
I left the past behind for good, there's no more sorrow.
Future looks bright ahead, and after all what's been said.
I'm standing here on my two feet, with my eyes open.
