[Music &amp; Words by Tolkki]

Let me take you to the far away places
Where you've never been to the orient lands
Soon you will notice the mountains and forests
We're flying over them now

Don't you be afraid, just take my hand
as we race with four winds
Welcome to the land of mystery
Welcome to the land of secrets
This is no ancient history
We are flying through the gates of Babylon

Allah is speaking us all with his mighty voice
Bowing to his power as we go down
This magic carpet ride is not a dream to us
It's really happening
