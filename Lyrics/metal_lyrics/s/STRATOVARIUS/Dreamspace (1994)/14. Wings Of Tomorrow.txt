[Music &amp; Words by Tolkki]

New winds are blowing over the world can you feel it
Message is spreading among all the people
Future is calling, history is leaving behind
Nobody is thinking about the past days

If you want to have a look in future world
If you have an open mind now it is your turn
Come join our forces to this trip on the Wings of Tomorrow

Concider that this world could be free from all this hatred
There would be no borders no laws of anykind yeah

Still mankind is falling, planning it's ruin everyday
But hey we can still stop this madness together

If you want to have a look in future world
If you have an open mind now it is your turn
Come join our forces to this trip on the Wings of Tomorrow
