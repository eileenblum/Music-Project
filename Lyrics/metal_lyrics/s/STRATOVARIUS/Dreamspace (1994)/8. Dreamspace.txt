[Music &amp; Words by Tolkki]

Looking back through time to my childhood days
I used to have a place where I could escape the reality
But lately things have been so difficult for me
trying to reach for the light in the fall of darkness

Waiting watching my life I'm wasting my time
I'm losing grip from life
Going back to my dreamspace leaving it all behind
soon the things will be allright when I get there

Am I safe in here, nothing left to fear
I will close my eyes and float away with stream

Wandering here in this eternal darkness
no signs of light anywhere I am going in sane
Now I am leaving this life
No hope left I want to die
