[Music &amp; Words by Tolkki]

Sign of the times and writings on the wall
they show me it's time has come
Order of a new kind we will all find
stronger than never before
Things are pretty much the same
like in the year thirty eight
oh won't we ever learn
This time is't gonna be different
so let's all join our hands
And let the children sing
for the last time

4th Reich is rising
can't you see the signs
4th Reich is rising
for the last time

Let's just press more money
don't worry about the inflation
we got to have more weapons to carry on
Unemployment and sorrow cannot be avoided at this point
but thins will be so different when they are
ruling the world

4th Reich is rising
can't you see the signs
4th Reich is rising
for the last time
what will be left to our children

is this our final destiny
