[Music &amp; Words by Tolkki]

What the hell is going on
Skijumpers making music that sells gold
There's no talent in this game
Hunting, hunting for the fame
Publicity is all you need
that's why it feels to me like

Reign of Terror

Everything costs so much nowadays
An individuals vanish in the haze
Entertainment for the masses
saving, saving your own asses
Rats are leaving sinking ship
still it feels to me like

Reign of Terror

What the hell is going on
everything is upside down
Hunting, hunting for the fame
terror, terror everywhere
