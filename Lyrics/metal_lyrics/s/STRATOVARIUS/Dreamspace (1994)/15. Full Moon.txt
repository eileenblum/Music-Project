[Japan bonus Track]

[Music &amp; Words by Tolkki]

Shining there in the sky light our way across the land
Black clouds in fromt of you face fading into the haze
In this prison of mine my soul lies in despair

My mind wanders through time tell me what is my crime
What is behind velvet lies heart as cold as the ice
in this prison of mine my soul lies in despair
Won't you set me free now I have to leave

Thanks to cr4dle for correcting track #6 lyrics.
