[Words &amp; Music by Tolkki]

Silence is all I hear
Blackness fills my world
Midwinter days and lonely nights
Depression takes over
my frozen mind

Morning starts a new day
Dawning nowhere to be seen
Oh, won't you break
my chains and let me go
free as a bird in the sky

Winter blows colder
I'm growing older
Visions of darkness
breaking the silence
Winter blows colder
I'm feeling older
Light fades away
I'm here to stay

I'm telling you no-one could ever take your place
open your eyes and you will see
