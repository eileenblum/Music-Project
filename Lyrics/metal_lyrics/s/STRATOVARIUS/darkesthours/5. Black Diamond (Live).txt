[live recording, GÃ¶teborg, Sweden]
[Music: T. Tolkki / Lyrics: T. Kotipelto]

Again I see you standing there watching me.
Your gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly,
Inviting me to get close to you,
Can't help myself.
There's fascination in the air.

I try to fight this strong sensation
But there's no chance to escape from this temptation.
Feels like I've known you before, repeating phrases,
But I yearn for something more.

[Chorus]

I know I can't stay by your side forever,
But I know I won't forget your beauty,
My Black Diamond.

[Repeat chorus x2]
