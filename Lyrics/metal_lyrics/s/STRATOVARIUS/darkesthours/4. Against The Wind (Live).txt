[live recording, Sofia, Bulgaria]
[Words &amp; Music by Tolkki/Kotipelto]

Once again I try to make things work
Facing all the power of society
Searching all the answers of the life
I'll never make it on my own
Was I meant to fail everytime
Seems to me that's my destiny
Is this all that's left to me
Confusion and bad memories

But now my time has come
No more running in the dark
I want much more than this
I really want it all

[Chorus]

Against the wind we run
To every place under the sun
We've got so much power inside
We will never give up
Against the wind we go
Towards the new shore
Together we'll forget the sorrow
It's forever gone

[Repeat chorus x2]
