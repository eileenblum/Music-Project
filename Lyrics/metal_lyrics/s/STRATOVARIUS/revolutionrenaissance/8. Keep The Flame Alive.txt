I have walked this lonely road
A thousand Years, it's filled with bitter tears
I have swum across the sea
Just to find away that home
I have been everywhere
I have seen what I should not seen
Still I'm here on this road
just to find where i belong
in my soul in my heart
Weariness tears apart
Still i walk on this road so my friends...keep the flame alive
