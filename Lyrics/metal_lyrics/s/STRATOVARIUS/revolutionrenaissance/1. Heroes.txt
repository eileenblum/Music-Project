look to yourself hear what i say
the answer is inside of feeble
here what you are to watch you say
or you just made and go by suddenly 

if doesn't matter
in your use better
stronger so poke of kinku
dreams are meaning not anymore
cos you made by faster by that more

still we turn around
and we found the stout
we will pay the way to out

we are heroes in the night
livin at the all the fight 
where the warriors are leading
tire that's okay
gonna fly here
gonna die all the day
gonna stay here all for now
cos' we are heroes
heroes of the light
