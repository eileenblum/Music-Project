You came into my life one sunny day
There was no reason to repair the shame
I travelled long and far to see the mirror on my soul
Fading like a dream away from me
To capture all the moment is undone
To share the view of morning sun is wide
To learn and live buying too many is the only way to go
Fading like a dream away from you

Angel I can't take away the pain
I can only share the trait
Take away the shame
Angel there's so much in life
Bigger than the wild
One day you'll see
My angel
