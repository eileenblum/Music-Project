When The sun setting down
all the awnsers must found
many people can fear whit the lonely
and the campers will stay
many times they will play
on the mouth in the lost of the lonely

[bridge:]
if there's a wheel there is away
i find a person like the mean and let he's take
just look began up to the sky
and see the mistery is goin so low
waiting for sun waiting for moon it is close
waiting for fun sailing away it is trought...

[chorus:]
Revolution, evolution
Revolution renaissance
evolution, revolution
this in my mind everyday
Revolution, evolution, revolution renaissance
Evolution, Revolution
this in my mind to stay

when you open the box
will you only find bags
on the dreams of your last long ago
is it just here to stay
is it foil you to play
or your mind get it up once again

[bridge]

[gitar solo]
[chorus x3]
