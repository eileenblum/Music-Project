Where is the conscience of the world?
where is the ancient to the bird?
and i see hideway and i here to stay
but where is the conscience of the world?
Man against another man I see
Whole creation fighting endlessly
and we will learn to give?
we will learn to live?
cause we are the conscience of the world
What if we'd turn around?
Eden is burning
what if we make the sound?
Eden is burning
Is there another way?
Eden is burning
the price to say the day
Eden is burning
