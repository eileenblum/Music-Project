chasing shadows falling
there's no reason to the calling
we are spreading all the news across today

sentinel is calling but my rightful pain is falling
there s no vanish to the point of no return

It's like at days of season tear
Seems like a fraction of the fear

[Chorus:]
If I fornicate in moonlight there's no reason to get mad
I might copulate in sunlight I might have to stay outside
if there s any way for me to find the answer to the call?
what you re gonna do? In your last night on earth!

[Chorus x2]
