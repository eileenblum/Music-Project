Look to the mirror and see what's the latest in fashion news
See all the creams and lotions and potions for you to use
let them slip away for another day, to stay, hear me say

[chorus:]
danger us and toxic cos'
must goes dreams on
no so you for your skin
so you must pay the price
anchor us and body cos'
in excel's is does
but i call it glorious divine
maybe the dreamer we placed in trougth to the match on yet
on lazy time when you cabin of your pennys go long in the year
feel it slips away for another day, to stay, hear me say

[Chorus]

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus x2]
