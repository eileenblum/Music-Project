Look at me do you see
All the things you could be if you see many more
Usually suddenly
They are clear and you are up against a wall
Fade away nevermore
Ultimate autobahn, many cars speeding up
No police anarchist maybe better 'cause you wanna say,
"And it's OK"

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna do the things you say
I don't wanna play the game you play
I just wanna make the best of what I can believe to be
I don't wanna fight if that's okay
If I really find some last gate
I just wanna walk the road I paved with myself
I did it my way

If you say you could pay but you can't pay enough
Vanished luck for a guy like you are with your chains
You just think that you can buy your way to hell
What I say I will say but you don't care about anyway
Hemingway library misery
'Cause you wanna rule the game yourself
But it's OK

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna do the things you say
I don't wanna play the game you play
I just wanna make the best of what I can believe to be
I don't wanna fight if that's okay
If I really find some last gate
I just wanna walk the road I paved with myself
