[Kupiainen/Kotipelto]

I'm waiting for a train
To take away the pain and ease my mind
I hear the tracks squeal
It makes me want to scream and let the world know how I feel

One way journey, no need for a seat
I'm beat, I won't be coming back
And what I'm learning, this life will be turning
Around at the end of the tracks

Freedom, the life of a drifter
Who know, if I'll ever find home
When its time to go I'm already there
I'm never scared, I'm living one day at a time

Freedom is my crime

Another hazy nightÂ 
Nothing is in sight, no hope in the air
Would I leave behind
All that's on my mind, would I forget, would I dare

One way journey, no need for a seat
I'm beat, I won't be coming back
And what I'm learning, this life will be turning
Around at the end of the tracks

Freedom, the life of a drifter
Who know, if I'll ever find home
When its time to go I'm already there
I'm never scared, I'm living one day at a time

The sun ain't burning the skies aren't blue
For me it's a sign to move on
And what I hear has made it so clear
I'm heading towards the new dawn

Freedom, the life of a drifter
Who know, if I'll ever find home
When its time to go I'm already there
I'm never scared, I'm living one day at a time
