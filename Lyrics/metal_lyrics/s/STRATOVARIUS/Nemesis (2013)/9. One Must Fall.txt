[Kupiainen]

Take all that I have left
Take everything I have spared for you

Tear down all my veils
Tear down âtil you see my naked core

Burn down my Eden
Burn down all that I had built for you

Save me-it is all that I have
Spare me-or we all will be damned
Save me

One must fall- and stay in the shadow
Thereâs no thrall- no hope, no salvation
One must fall- under the black rainbow
Fight no more and maybe there is a better day
But in the end no one will be saved

Bring down the rain on us
Bring it down so we can drown in the flood

Harvest the seeds Iâve sown
Harvest until you have drained my blood

Save me- what are you fighting for?
Spare me- or thereâs no tomorrow
Save me- your reign is no more
Save me

One must fall- and stay in the shadow
Thereâs no thrall- no hope, no salvation
One must fall- under the black rainbow
Fight no more and maybe there is a better day
But in the end no one will be saved

But in the end no one will be saved!
