[Kupiainen/Kotipelto]

The night turns to dawn
The cityâs left behind
Those whoâve been blind they will be saved
White stripes on the road theyâre guiding my way
Reciting my prayers the road is paved

Through all the years Iâve carried the flame
In the darkest nights as the lightning strikes
Iâm bringing hope to those who walk in the shadows

As I drive alone
My mission is unknown
Will it be revealed for me cause

Now Iâm calling out for

Power- streaming through me
I will let out the angel or the beast
This power- will make you see
As the lightning strikes your pain will be released

Free me- thatâs what I hear you
Screaming- in misery
Free me- from this pain while
Screaming- kneel before mighty
Power- my power
This power- my power

Calling out for

Power- streaming through me
I will let out the angel or the beast
This power- will make you see
As the lightning strikes your pain will be released

Free me- thatâs what I hear you
Screaming- in misery
Free me- from this pain while
Screaming- kneel before mighty
Power- my power
This power- my power
