[Johansson]

You wanna go to heaven but you never want to die
A silent scream for freedom turn to
Fire turn to water turn to
Stoneâs the same, the skyâs the same, it doesnât roll away
The other side where life goes on is
Close and yet you know itâs just a lie

But youâre stronger than they are
Feel the wind in your hair
And youâre faster than they are
And it feels that youâre lighter than air

When youâre drawn to the ground by the dragons
Would you raise up your head, would you gaze at the sky
When youâre drawn to the ground by the dragons
Would you raise up your head, would you cry

And all the wicked prisons that they built inside your mind
And all the wicked borders that unite us, that divide us, until
Death ever different will embrace us in the end
But roll away the stone, and hear the
Wind will whisper out your name

But youâre stronger than they are
And it feels that youâre lighter than air

When youâre drawn to the ground by the dragons
Would you raise up your head, would you gaze at the sky
When youâre drawn to the ground by the dragons
Would you raise up your head, would you cry
