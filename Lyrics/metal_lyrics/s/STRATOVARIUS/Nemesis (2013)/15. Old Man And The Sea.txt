[Exclusive Bonus Track]Son, my father he said to me,
You only dream when you're young.
Some might think that he knew it well,
But I have proved him wrong.

Years have passed and I've grown old,
And time has taken its toll.
Though my days are soon over,
It feels life's just begun.

Just once more I sail the last sea,
Let the wind carry me home.
Close my eyes and take a deep breath,
In my soul I am forever young...

Just once more I sail the last sea,
Let the wind carry me home.
Close my eyes and take a deep breath,
In my soul I am forever young..
