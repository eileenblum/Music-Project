[Kotipelto/Liimatainen/Liimatainen]

Once upon a time I was the scribe of all my dreams
Iâve seen the years turn into dust, now feel the rust in me
Iâve walked the shores of Avalon, Iâve seen the seasons change
Iâve laughed and cried, Iâve lived and died, but only on the page

Now all I have, all I am
All I ever was is here, on the page
Itâs all the same, it never mattered anyway
Itâs all a lie so let it burn

All empty words and all rhymes will fade
As the light of last candle flickers away
If the story is over, this chapter my last
Let it be my best one, let it be my own

I hope itâs not too late to learn to live and learn to love
I yearn to fight, to turn the tide before the tender dark
For I never drew the sword from stone, thereâs no Helen in my Troy
I stand alone, I stand forgotten, just gazing into the void

Come night, test my will, test my soul
Test my faith and test my heart, torn apart
Make me strong, make me whole again and
Guide through the dark âtil the morning comes

All empty words and all rhymes will fade
As the light of last candle flickers away
If the story is over, this chapter my last
Let it be my best one, let it be my own
