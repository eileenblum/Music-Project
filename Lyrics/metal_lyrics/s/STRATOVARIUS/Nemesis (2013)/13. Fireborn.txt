[Limited Digibook / Japanese Editions Bonus Track][Porra/Porra]

I was born within a dream
and awoken by a thunderous scream 
Fireborn, burning within
I can feel it burn under my skin

Hold my head up high
tonight we're gonna fly
be all that we can be
go as far as we can see
fly high I'll tell you why
tonight we take the sky
Fireborn

Chase the light, capture the star
as you race the night, be what you are 
Fireborn call out your name
when you come with me we are the same

Hold my head up high
tonight we're gonna fly
be all that we can be
go as far as we can see
fly high I'll tell you why
tonight we take the sky
Fireborn

Hold my head up high
tonight we're gonna fly
be all that we can be
go as far as we can see
fly high I'll tell you why
tonight we take the sky

And now head up high
tonight we're gonna fly
be all that we can be
go as far as we can see
fly high I'll tell you why
tonight we take the sky
Fireborn
