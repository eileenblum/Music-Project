[Verse 1]
Won't you open up your heart and let me come inside. 
Please let the loving start to climb. 
I know you may may wonder why I've come to hold you tight. 
I don't want you to cry tonight. 
I will take you in my arms and sing your favorite song. 
As i tell you of your charms all night long. 
You've been hurt over again, with all my love I say I am 
Holding out my hand. 

[Chorus]
You won't be lonely anymore. 
You won't be lonely anymore. 

[Verse 2]
For so long you've been in rain, but now you're warm and dry. 
You've been through all the pain and now it's blue skies. 
You'll be happy and secure as long as you are mine and as 
Long as I am yours. 

[Repeat Chorus]

Won't you open up your hear and let me come inside. 
Please let the loving start to climb. 
I will take you in my arms and I will hold you tight. 
You won't be lonely tonight.
