I woke up at six a.m., and took a look at me
All I was, all I am, I refuse to be
Within a simple breath, I taste my destiny
Before I lose what's left, I want my heart to see

[Chorus:]
Love is why I live, Love is why I die
It's what I give, and yet what I deny
It's what I need, it's how I will survive
Love Is Why

I can read, I can write, but still I'm deaf and blind
All the things I've discerned, I've given up to find
The only thing that sets me free is a mystery
Worth more than anything, throughout my history

[Chorus]

Love is patient, Love is Kind, Love - it has no pride
Love will wait forever, Love won't hide
Love is patient, Love is Kind, Love - it has no pride
Love will wait forever, Love won't hide

[Chorus]
