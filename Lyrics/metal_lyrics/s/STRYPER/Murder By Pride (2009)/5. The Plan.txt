Ten years ago
I know I loved You so
Right here, Right now
I just don't know

I've tried, I've lied
I've told the truth at times
I've laughed, I've cried
I've slept with open blinds

Where do I go from here?
I've gotta crucify my fear

[Chorus:]
I want to be the man, the one I know You see
I want to live the plan, the one with You and me

I'm worn, I'm torn
I'm sheared from side to side
But Your love, Your light
Is something I won't hide

I wanna go somewhere from here
So I can sail a sky that's clear

[Chorus]

I want to be the man, The One I know You see
I want to live The Plan, The One with You and me

[Chorus]
