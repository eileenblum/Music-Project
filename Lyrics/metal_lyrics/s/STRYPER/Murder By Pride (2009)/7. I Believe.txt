I Believe in You and You believe in me
I Believe in Love and Love believes in me
I Believe in faith and hope and destiny
I Believe

I Believe in Life and Life believes in me
I Believe in God and what He sees in me
I Believe there's more to life eternally

[Chorus:]
I Believe

I Believe in peace and peace believes in me
I Believe in grace and grace believes in me
I Believe in mercy cause it's holding me
I Believe

I Believe in what is good and what is right
I Believe in darkness there's a shining light
I Believe to win the war you have to fight

[Chorus]
