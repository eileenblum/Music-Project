Listen, birds don't sing anymore
Waves don't crash on the shore
'Cause You don't love me anymore
See, the morning sun doesn't shine
And the moon's nowhere to find
'Cause You don't love me anymore

[Chorus:]
Then I realize - I'm Alive, I'll survive
I was only dreaming that our love died
I'm Alive, I'll survive
I'll never stop believing

Feel, there's no wind in my hair
There's no warmth from the sun's glare
'Cause You don't love me anymore
Stand, there's no ground to walk on
There's no one to lean upon
'Cause You don't love me anymore

[Chorus]

Then I realize - I'm Alive, I'll survive
I was only dreaming that our love died
I'm Alive, I'll survive
I'll never stop believing or deny

[Chorus]

Listen, the birds are singing once more
The waves are crashing on shore
'Cause You love me....
