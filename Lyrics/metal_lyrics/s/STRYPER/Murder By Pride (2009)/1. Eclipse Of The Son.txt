I've been running nowhere street
I've got to mend my bloody feet
I've thrown away ten thousand days
I've hidden black and white and painted gray

In my weakness, out of pride
I failed to see the other side
It's a lost and broken war
That I won't fight for anymore

[Chorus:]
Where did I go wrong?
A shattered life, a wasted song
I composed, I lived and wrote each one
What is destiny?
To Live and Love and Die Honorably
So I'll trade My Eclipse for The Son

I want to make a difference
I want my life to make some sense
Cause when it's all over
I will have to answer for myself

I'm tearing down my rotten fence
And burying my weak defense
I want to crossover
Its time to take my heart off of the shelf

[Chorus]
