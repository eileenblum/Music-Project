Love saves the soul
Hate kills the heart
Fear robs the goal
Hope gives a start

Forgiveness is a gift
Bitterness a chain
The ugliness we sift
His beauty still remains

[Chorus:]
When we all reach Heaven
There will be no shame
'Cause when we stand before Him
He will know each name
It's all about believing
He died and took the pain
When we all reach Heaven
It's Mercy Over Blame

Faith heals the scars
That pride has brought upon
Grace will be ours
When all we have is gone

[Chorus]

When we all reach Heaven
There will be no shame
'Cause when we stand before Him
He will know each name
It's all about believing
He died and took the pain
When we all reach Heaven
It's Mercy Over Blame
