To fear You, to love You, to seek You
To be near You, to be of You, be in You
To know You, show You, need You
To learn You, speak You, read You
To love You, show you, need You
To love You, speak you, read You

To see You, to hear You, to meet You
To drink You, to taste You, to eat You
To know You, show You, need You
To learn You, speak You, read You
To know You, show You, need You
To learn You, speak You, read You

[Chorus:]

You're my everything - (everything)
My bridge across the water - (my living spring)
The melody and the song I'll - (forever sing)
Don't You know that you're my everything
You're my everything

To touch You, to hold You, to feel You
To take You, accept You, reveal You
To know You, show You, need You
To learn You, speak You, read You
To know You, show You, need You
To learn You, speak You, read You

[Chorus]
