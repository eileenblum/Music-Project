You've been workin' hard
Tryin' to make your life appealing
You've got no regard
You don't know what the hell you're feeling

[Bridge 1:]
You've got everything, live like a kink
But how will you live tomorrow?

[Chorus:]
You're caught in the middle
And you don't know where to go
Turn it around, come back to the ground
Before you break and lose control
Are you here at all
Or are you at the point of no return
You've got to make a call
You've got to make a choice before you get burned

[Bridge 2:]
You've got what it takes, make no mistakes
Don't live your life in sorrow

[Chorus]

[Bridge 1]

[Chorus]
