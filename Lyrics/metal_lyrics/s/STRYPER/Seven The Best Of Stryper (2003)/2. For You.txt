I would walk through the fire for you
I would fly even higher for you
My one and only desire is you
But will you ever want me?

[Chorus:]
I can give you the stars
I can give you the oceans
I can give you the sun and the moon with a view
I can give you the world with undying devotion
But if I lose your heart
Then what good will it do?
I'd run a million miles for you
I'd take on any trial for you
I'd fight any battle and I would die for you
But will you ever know me?

[Chorus]
