I'm alive but am I living?
If I'm in fear of who I long to be
Of myself I'm unforgiving
I'm grasping hope when I believe

[Chorus:]
We all need Something
We all need Something more
We all-we all-we all-we all
We all need Something else
And Something to live for
Life is short yeah that's a given
What's here today is gone tomorrow
In a world that's lost and driven
To find The Way is to know

[Chorus]
