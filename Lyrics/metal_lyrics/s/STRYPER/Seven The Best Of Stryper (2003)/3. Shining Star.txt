Shining Star for you to see
What your life can truly be
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams will take you very far
When you wish upon a dream
Life ainÂ´t always what it seems
Once you see your light so dear
In the sky so very clear

[Chorus:]
YouÂ´re a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you can truly be
Truly be
Shining star comes into view
Shine it's watchful light on you
Give you strength to carry on
Make your body big and strong
So if you find yourself in need
Why donÂ´t you listen to his words of heed
Be a giant grain of sand
Words of wisdom yes I can

[Chorus x2]

Shining star for you to see, what your life can truly be
