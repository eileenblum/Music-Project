Inside of me there is a lonely place
Sometimes I just don't know it's there
But when I'm all alone
That's when I have to face...

[Bridge:]
The part of me that needs someone
To be by my side that's when I call on...

[Chorus:]
You, You make my life complete
You give me all I need
You help me through and through
I'm calling on you
I can't explain just what You do to me
My love grows stronger everyday
You give me love, You give me company

[Bridge 2]
And when I have to face the rain
You bring sunshine into my life

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
