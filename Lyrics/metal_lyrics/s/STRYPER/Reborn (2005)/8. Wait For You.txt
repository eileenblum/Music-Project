You go left
I head in the right direction
I go up
You go down
I take my time
You rush every situation
I go straight
You go around
But I'll wait for You
Oh I'll wait for You
Yes I'll wait for You
Oh I'll wait for You
I'm awake
You're tired and You feel like sleeping
When You're cold
I'm on fire, yeah
You repeat yourself
I say it once, and it's the one I'm keeping
You go low
And I go high
Oh I'll wait for You
Yes I'll wait for You
Yes I'll wait for You
Oh I'll wait for You
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll wait
Oh I'll wait for You
Yes I'll wait for You
Yes I'll wait for You
Oh I'll wait for You
And I'll wait
Oh I'll wait for You
Oh I'll wait for You
