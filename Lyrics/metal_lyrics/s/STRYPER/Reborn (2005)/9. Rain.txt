Breathing, it once was so easy
Now I'm torn between the sky and the water that climbs up
And drowns me in sleep
I remember, the moon caught in the trees
The stars would fall and dance from branch to branch
And watch me believe, hey, summer follows fall
When I'm watching the rain
Melt my window away
Will You hold me here in Your arms
When I'm sinking in pain
And I'm thinking love's late
Will You hold me here in the night
Constants, always change their mind
All is so sublime then I blink and I find
That it's written in rain
Oh after, is the sweetest smell of spring
Years and years before I could see past the storm
But it's harder now, believing that summer follows fall

[Repeat Chorus]
