Someone's child but no one's friend
A city street alone again
Funny how tears don't wash away
Even in December rain
Someone's child you'd never meet
Merchandise on a darkened street
A painted face with a child's eyes
A paradox of sad disguise
When did I see You cry oh Lord
When were You all alone
When did I see You so far away from home
Someone's child now half alive
Lives in a bottle just to survive
Had a home and had a wife
That's a story from a different life
We've all seen him a time or two
He's not all that different from me and you
He's more than a face or a name
He's a reason why You came
When did I see You cry oh Lord
When were You all alone
When did I see You so far away
You say I closed my eyes
You say I closed my heart
I never stopped looking
You say I didn't start
When did I see You cry oh Lord
When were you all alone
When did I see You so far away, so far away, so far away from home

[Repeat Chorus]
