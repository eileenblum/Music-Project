Amazing, amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once, I once was lost
But now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
When we've been there
Ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days
To sing God's praise
Than when we first begun
It was grace, it was grace that taught
My heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How, how, how, how precious, how precious did
Oh that grace appear
The hour I first believed

[Repeat Chorus]
