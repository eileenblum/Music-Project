You are my air
You are the ground that I stand upon
Oh, and I love You
You are the light
The moon in the night and the sun of every dawn
And I need Your touch to heal me
You're the one that I glorify
If I die today
I know I can say
I don't have one regret
' Cause I own Your redemption
As long as I breathe
I'll always believe
That You took this life
And painted it with definition
So I am Yours
Living was hard
And loneliness easily justified
Oh, then I found You
Ooh, I suddenly knew
What I wanted to do was to make You satisfied
And not to die for selfish pleasure
But to live with You by my side
If I die today
I know I can say
I don't have one regret
' Cause I own Your redemption
As long as I breathe
I'll always believe
That You took this life
And painted it with definition
I am Yours. I am Yours. I am Yours. I am Yours.

[Repeat Chorus]

If I die today
I won't regret
' Cause I won Your redemption
As long as I breathe
I'll always believe
That you took this life
And painted it with definition
I am Yours
