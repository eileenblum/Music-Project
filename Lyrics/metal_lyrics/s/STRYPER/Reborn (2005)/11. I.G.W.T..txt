It's been said money talks, if so what does it say
Four simple words we see every day
The rich, the poor, heaven is for those who choose
Don't put your trust in money you'll lose
Again and again
In God we trust, in Him we must believe
He is the only way
In God we trust, His Son we must receive
Accept Him today, tomorrow's too late

[Repeat Chorus]

Ooh, ooh, ooh, in God we trust

[Repeat]
