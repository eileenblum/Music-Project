I need Your love, I wanna be close to You
I need Your touch, it makes me feel refined
I need Your heart, it warms me when I'm frozen through
But I walked away, left You to stay, with no explanation
Now I realize, my darkened skies, won't shine without Your light
Will You forgive me
Can You forget the old me
If You let me
I want to make You mine
I see Your face, and suddenly my heart stands still
And when You smile, I'm lost within Your perfect world
But I walked away, left You to stay, with no explanation
Now I realize, my darkened skies, won't shine without Your light
But I broke Your heart, right from the start, and it's killing me inside
I know I can be, the one You see, if I throw away my pride
Will You forgive me
Can You forget the old me
If You let me, I want to make You mine
I want to make You mine
I want to make You mine

[Repeat]
