Take me and I lay down my life
And break me, cut the cancer with a knife
Teach me, what is wrong from what is right
And show me, when to walk and when to fight
I am weak, I'm never strong
I've been upside down for way too long
I'm sick and tired of no real change
Can You help me rearrange
My life 'cause I really want to live again
I want to live again
So shake me, I'm a man who's settled
I'm a man who's settled in, settled in
Can You clean me, I'm so dirty from within
I am weak, I'm never strong
I've been upside down for way too long
I'm sick and tired of no real change
Can You help me rearrange
My life cause I really want to live again
Ooh yes I am weak, I'm never strong
I've been upside down for way too long
I am weak, I'm never strong
I've been upside down for way too long
I'm sick and tired of no real change
I said, can You help me live again
