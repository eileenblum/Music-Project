[previously unreleased]

I'm hearin' people talkin'
Sayin' things that just ain't true
Thinkin' that they know what we've been through
They say that we've been walkin'
Away from what we started to do
But we still want our message to get through

[Bridge:]
We're soldiers under command
Gonna sing it loud and clear
He's the rock that makes me roll
Turn it up, we want you to hear

[Chorus:]
Can't stop the rock
Can't stop the rock
Playin' in this rock band
Tryin' to make a stand
Hasn't been an easy thing to do
Travelin' 'cross this land
Tryin' to make people understand
We've got the right to rock 'em how we choose

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
