Too many days go by
When we don't see eye to eye
We hold the key that will open all the doors
I just wish that we could give just a little more

[Chorus:]
This time we've gotta stick together
Can't let our hearts turn into stone
We'll win this fight if we never say never
As two bodies, one mind one soul
I swore that I'd never give up on you
And you said that you would see this through
So let's light the fire that will burn the wall to the ground
Let's find what we thought could never be found

[Chorus x2]
