Now is the time
That we stand together as one
A new light inside us will shine
As bright as the sun
Let's bring, bring in the new
And do away with the old
A new love, a new love that's true
A love that's never cold,
A love that never dies
A love that fills our souls
We will survive

[Chorus:]
Together as one
We'll stand for the world to see
Together as one
We'll shine bright throughout eternity
All the dreams we've dreamed before
Are now reality
Now the dreams of a perfect love
Will always be

[Chorus]

You and I in a perfect love faithfully
