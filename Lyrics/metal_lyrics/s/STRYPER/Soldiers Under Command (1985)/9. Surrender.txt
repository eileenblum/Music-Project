[Verse 1]
Singing out in harmony 
It explains so well 
What we're called to do 
Want to rock so you can see 
We can rock as well 
Rock as well for you 
Bridge You can have it all tonight 
Pick it up and make it right 
Oh, you can be free 
In the dark you need a light 
Do you want to make it right 

[Chorus]
Oh, Jesus Christ is the lover of your soul 
And He wants to give you all you need 
So freely surrender 
Open up unto His Majesty 

[Repeat Chorus]

Jesus Christ is the lover of your soul 
And He wants to give you all you need 
So freely surrender 
To the King 
Freely surrender 
Open up unto His Majesty...
