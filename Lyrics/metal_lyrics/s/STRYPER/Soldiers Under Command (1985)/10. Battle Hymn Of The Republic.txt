Mine eyes have seen the glory 
Of the coming of the Lord 
He is trampling out the vintage 
Where the grapes of wrath are stored 
He hath loosed the fateful lightening 
Of His terrible swift sword 
His truth is marching on 
Glory, Glory Hallelujah 
Glory, Glory Hallelujah 
Glory, Glory Hallelujah 
His truth is marching on 
His truth is marching on
