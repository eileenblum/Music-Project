[Verse 1]
Clap your hands and stomp your feet 
All you girls and all you guys 
Let's rock the world with a new beat 
C'mon don't wait 
Don't you pass it by 

[Chorus]
One big family 
That will live eternally 
Together forever 
All you have to do 
Is receive the one who died for you 

[Verse 2]
I get so high I can't stay in my seat 
Excitement fills the air 
Let's rock the world with a new beat 
All you girls and guys everywhere 

[Repeat Chorus]
