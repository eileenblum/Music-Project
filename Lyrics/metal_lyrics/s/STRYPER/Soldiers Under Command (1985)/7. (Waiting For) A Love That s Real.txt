[Verse 1]
She says she tries so hard to show it 
She wants to say what's on her mind 
Seems like he doesn't want to know it 
She says he's always so unkind 

[Bridge]
But she's not giving up 
Until he sees 
Her live inside is heavenly 

[Chorus]
I love you, I want you 
But that won't change the way I feel 
I love you, I want you 
I don't want love that's just not real 

[Verse 2]
It seems like nothing's getting better 
She knows she just can't carry on 
She always thought it would last forever 
But now she knows that it's not love 

[Bridge]
She waits so patiently for perfect love 
She knows someday it will come from above 

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
She waits for Godly love 
Knowing that someday it will come from above 

[Repeat Chorus ]
