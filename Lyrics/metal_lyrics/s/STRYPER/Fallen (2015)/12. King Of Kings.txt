Do you believe in God?
Do you accept his mercy
Or is he just a fairytale?
Is Christ a fraud?
Or is He true and worthy
Is He the One you choose to hail?

He is the King of Kings
And the Lord of Lords
He died at Calvary
So we could live forevermore

Sometimes we all have doubt
And many times we're empty
But there's a constant that we need
When love is all about
Protecting and defending
There isn't room for our own greed

He is the King of Kings
And the Lord of Lords
He died at Calvary
So we could live forevermore
