I came in sixty-three
With a song in my head
I grew up impatiently
Thinking too far ahead
With no choice I started to voice
Everything I believed
I knew you that I was the one
Who would never retreat

No - till I get what I need
No - till I get what I need
Till I get what I need

On the run and chasing the sun
Never looking behind
It ain't over till it's done
And I'm able to find
The one thing that drives me
To reach far beyond the stars
I won't break, I'm not gonna breach
Until I make my mark

No - till I get what I need
No - till I get what I need
Oh - till I get what I need
Till I get what I need

No - can I get what I need
No - can I get what I need
Oh - can I get what I need
Can I get what I need

No - will I get what I need
No - will I get what I need
Oh - will I get what I need
Will I get what I need
