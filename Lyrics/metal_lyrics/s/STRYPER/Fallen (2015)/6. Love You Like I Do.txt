You've only seen just a glimpse of me
(So you just can't leave me now)
I want to show you the world I see
(But you just can't leave me now)
I've got it all, what you want and need
(But you just can't leave me now)

No one will love you like I do
If only you'd just believe that
No one will ever look at you
The way that I do - love you like I do

I carried you when you could not walk
(Tell me why would you leave me now?)
I was your voice when you could not talk
(So why would you leave me now?)
We're almost there, with a little to bear
(But you just can't leave me now)

No one will love you like I do
If only you'd just believe that
No one will ever look at you
The way that I do (oh no)

No one will ever love you - the way that I do

No one will love you like I do
No one could ever love you
No one will ever look at you
That way that I do
No one will love you like I do
On one will ever look at you
On now could ever look at you
Love you like I do
Love you like I do
