A crown of thorns, it was placed on His head
They clothed him in purple and stated their case
âHe is The King of the Jews" as they slapped His face

Pilate said, âI find no reason to charge Him.â
As soon as they saw Him they said, "Crucify.
He just proclaimed to be God, He surely must die."

[Chorus]
Yahweh - Yahweh - Yahweh!

When Pilate heard this he was afraid
He asked The Lord where do You come from
Donât You realize I have power to free or kill The Son

Jesus finally decided to answer him,
"You have no power at all over Me.
If it didnât come from above, youâre too blind to see."

[Chorus]
Yahweh - Yahweh - Yahweh!
Yahweh - Yahweh - Yahweh!

And so, the soldiers took Jesus
Dragging His cross to a place where He knew
They hung a sign that would read âThe King Of The Jewsâ

They nailed His flesh to the wood
He said, âItâs Finished,â and laid down His life
Gave up His spirit for all - He was crucified!

[Chorus]
Yahweh - Yahweh - Yahweh!
Yahweh - Yahweh - Yahweh!
