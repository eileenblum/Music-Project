I've seen the other side
It's not what the world wants you to believe
I've traveled far and wide
And I've learned that things
Aren't what you perceive

But that's just life, take it all in stride

Keep running for the line
And looking for a sign
The planets will align
Because you have the calling

When all the lights go out
It's impossible to find your way
We start believing doubt
And all our weaknesses are on display

It's as good or as bad as you want it to be

Keep running for the line
And looking for a sign
The planets will align
Because you have the calling

Keep running for the line
And looking for a sign
The planets will align
Because you have the calling
