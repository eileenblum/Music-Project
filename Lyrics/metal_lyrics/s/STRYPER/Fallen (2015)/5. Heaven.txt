I am standing
Even though I've been to hell and back
Taking off and landing
With my heart in place and faith in tact
I won't give up
Even though the odds, they tell me to
I'm here with a purpose
Every word I say and thing I do

My destiny will never die
I'll never guess or wonder why

I choose heaven - I choose heaven
I choose heaven!

This world spins
Every deed that's done, misunderstood
At times it's a no-win situation
To defend what's good
It takes courage
To look the devil in the eyes
And say "get away"
I can see right through your cheap disguise

I choose heaven - confession
I choose heaven - I choose heaven!

I choose heaven - accession
I choose heaven
I choose heaven - confession
Accession - I choose heaven!
