We all have something to do
And we all have somewhere
That we're going to
We all have something to say
And we'll take down
Those who get in our way
We let the mind control the heart
Tearing the best we have apart
We've got convictions deep inside
We've got to let it ride

Tell me why? Pride!
Tell me why...

Two friends who shared the past
No one could have guessed
That it wouldn't last
I know it can be restored
If forgiveness is something
That's never ignored
We can't let fear and jealousy
Take everything that we should be
We can't let life just pass us by
We've got to let it ride

Tell me why? Pride!
Tell me why...

Pride! You've got to tell me why...
Tell me why? Pride!
You've got to tell me why - pride!
Tell me why? Pride!
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why...
