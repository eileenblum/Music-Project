On the first day He made Heaven
Then earth and said let there be light
Then He separated the water from the sky
The ground becomes land
And waters became the seas, He was pleased
Trees would take root and live to bear fruit

Let there be light
Day and a night
Stars shining bright
Let there be light!

And then upon the fifth day
Fish would swim and birds could fly
Land bearing creatures
All according to their kind
And so it shall be
A man and a woman after Thee
And He was pleased
Soon theyâll increase and rule every beast

Let there be light
Day and a night
Stars shining bright
Let there be light!

Let there be light
Day and a night
Stars shining bright
Let there be light!
