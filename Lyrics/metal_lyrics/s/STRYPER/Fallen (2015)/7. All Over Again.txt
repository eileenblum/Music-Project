I've seen it good, I've seen the bad
That's just the way it goes
Misunderstood
Happy or sad I'm sure what I feel shows

But here I am gratefully
Alive and well thankfully

If I had the chance to do it all again
No I wouldn't change a thing
(I wouldn't change a thing)
I've lived the life of a thousand men
With the honor of a king
And I'd do it all over again

I've made choices
I'll take the blame for everything I do
My heart rejoices
Cause there ain't no shame
When you let love through

No matter how high or low
I'm gonna let you know, baby

If I had the chance to do it all again
No I wouldn't change a thing
(I wouldn't change a thing)
I've lived the life of a thousand men
With the honor of a king
And I'd do it all over again

If I had the chance to do it all again
No I wouldn't change a thing
(I wouldn't change a thing)
I've lived the life of a thousand men
With the honor of a king
And I'd do it all over again
With the honor of a king
And I'd do it all again with you
