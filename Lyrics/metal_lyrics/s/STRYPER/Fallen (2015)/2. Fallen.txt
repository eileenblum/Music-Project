You were filled with pride because you were so beautiful
Your wisdom was corrupted for the sake of your splendor
You were cast down to the ground, exposed before the kings
Deceiver of the world, you know you'll always be the great pretender

Now you're fallen, fallen, fallen

You used to be so blameless from the day you came to be
Unrighteousness, it reared its evil face inside of you
You were once anointed, when you walked the music played
Like lighting from the sky, you were forever thrown from heaven too

Now you're fallen, fallen, fallen
The end is calling, calling, fallen

Now you're fallen, fallen, fallen
The end is calling, calling, fallen 
Now you're fallen, fallen, fallen
