You've got to love how they portray Christianity
Just a freak another fool for the world to see
Twisting and distorting all, making money too
Mocking every thing that's said, they don't have a clue - no!

[Chorus:]
Big screen lies, it's no surprise
I'm getting wise, to the big screen lies

It's the way it's always been, persecuting rules
As the wolves lie in their den, sharpening their tools
Feasting on the faith of those, who dare to make it known
As a warning to the foes, you'll reap what you've sown - oh yeah!

[Chorus:]
Big screen lies, it's no surprise
I'm getting wise, to the big screen lies

[Chorus:]
Big screen lies, it's no surprise
I'm getting wise, to the big screen lies
Big screen lies, it's no surprise
I'm getting wise, to the big screen lies
