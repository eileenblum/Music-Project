Iâm a victim of your pain
But I have no one else to blame but me
There were choices guaranteed
I closed my eyes, and turned the other cheek

[Chorus:]
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But words will never hurt me so they say
Oh well, yours hurt like hell

You donât own me - I am free
Iâll take the high road and pray that it takes me
Company loved misery
Until it chose to change the scenery

[Chorus:]
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But words will never hurt me so they say
Oh well, yours hurt like hell
Iâm a fighter on the mend
And I will rise above the world you spin
You fail, I wish you well

[Bridge:]
Iâm letting go of you â Iâm letting go of me
Iâm letting go of all the things that hold me down emphatically
Iâm letting go of time â Iâm letting go of space
Iâm letting go of all the waste Iâve carried to this place

[Chorus:]
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But words will never hurt me so they say
Oh well, yours hurt like hell
Iâm a fighter on the mend
I will rise above the world you spin
You fail, I wish you well
