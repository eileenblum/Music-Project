Weâve been adrift, upon the oceans
Trying to sift through our emotions
Thereâs no land in sight as we sail through the night
Looking for something to see â suddenlyâ¦

[Chorus:]
Weâre Saved By Love
Weâre Saved By Love

We canât forget, what brought us this far
Itâs heaven sent, beyond the big star
Just when weâre feeling that weâre going down
We canât go on anymore â weâre restored

[Chorus:]
Weâre Saved By Love
Weâre Saved By Love

[Bridge:]
We canât go on if we feel thereâs no wrong
Hurting the ones that we need
When brothers and sisters are moving along
Reaping and sowing the seed
Oh the one thing that we have that lights up the dark
And shows us what we need to see â look above
