In a time when love is taken with a price
I won't cross the line or blindly sacrifice
We have something that they shine upon the screen
And itâs deeper than what's felt or what is seen

Golden years, worthless tears
Iâve seen enough to write tale after tale
But through it all, you never fail

[Chorus:]
Te Amo â Living, dying, young and old
Te Amo - Youâre a treasure with a heart of gold

You were there when I could sense no other soul
And you cared when I was down and letting go
Youâre an angel that came down to earth to be
The saving grace to help this non believer see

There is more, so much more
Hidden deep beneath a land of stone
Now itâs known, Iâm not alone

[Chorus:]
Te Amo â Living, dying, young and old
Te Amo â Youâre a treasure with a heart of gold
