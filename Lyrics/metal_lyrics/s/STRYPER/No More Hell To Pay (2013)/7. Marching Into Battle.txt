I saw The Heavens open, and behold a white horse
The One that was sitting upon him, was called faithful and true
His eyes were like two burning flames, on His head a gold crown
He wore a vesture of blood, with a name nobody knew

Marching Into Battle
Marching Into Battle
Marching Into Battle

Out of His mouth came a sword, He used to smite the nations
The beast and false prophet were bound, and cast into the sea
Theyâre followers slain by Almighty, fowls they fed upon them

Marching Into Battle
Marching Into Battle
Marching Into Battle
