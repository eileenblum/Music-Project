If He were here today, what would we say?
Would we repeat the past, or let Him lead the way

Minds jaded, lifeâs faded - will we answer the call?
To keep fighting â Uniting, and stand up tall

[Chorus:]
He turned Water Into Wine
And made the blind man see
He cast devils out, into swine
Heâs came to set you free

The road to hell is wide, but heavens narrow
Will we stop tryinâ to hide, or be like Pharaoh?

Pride and Glory, same story - since the beginning of time
If weâre ready â and weâre steady, weâll make the line

[Chorus:]
He turned Water Into Wine
And made the blind man see
He cast devils out, and into swine
Heâ came to set you free
