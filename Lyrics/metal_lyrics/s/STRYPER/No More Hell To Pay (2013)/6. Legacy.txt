Weâve built an empire
That in the end we canât take with us
We walk the high wire
We cross the boundaries and thatâs our rush

[Chorus:]
But when we step beyond the other side
There will be nothing to hide â Whatâs our Legacy?
Will we be humbled far beyond our pride?
Or are we in for a rough ride - Whatâs our Legacy?

Itâs never too late
To sacrifice what doesnât matter
We hold our own fate
Itâs time to swing and be the batter

[Chorus:]
But when we step beyond the other side
There will be nothing to hide â Whatâs our Legacy?
Will we be humbled far beyond our pride?
Or are we in for a rough ride - Whatâs our Legacy?
