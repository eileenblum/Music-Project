Iâve blown up our world, and scattered pieces behind
A boy and innocent girl, defined one of a kind
Love was making, we were taking
But now itâs harder to find

[Chorus:]
You Still Move â oh You still move me yeah
You Will Always â You will always be The One

I say with a smile, all I should with a word
Youâve stayed for a while, itâs bordering on absurd
Cause thatâs your glory and pains my story
But grace is what Iâd prefer

[Chorus:]
You Still Move â oh You still move me
You Will Always â You will always be The One
