I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm coming like a thief at night
And you, you, you, you're out of time so make it right
There, there, there, there will be no more apologies
'Cause my, my, my, my wrath will spread like a disease

There's a revelation
It's coming after you
Without hesitation
It's gonna bring the truth

In, in, in, in an instant will the trumpet blow
Sin, sin, sin is counted, the fee is tolled
Blood, blood, blood will run and turn the waters red
A flood, a flood will wash away the devil's bed

There's a revelation
It's coming down for you
Without hesitation
It's gonna bring the truth

[Solo]

There's a revelation
It's coming down for you
Without hesitation
It's gonna bring the truth

There's a revelation
It's coming down for you
Without hesitation
It's bringing down the truth
