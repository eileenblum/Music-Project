Iâve been running, Iâve been gone
Not forthcoming, for so long
Disillusioned, heartless too
Convoluted, through and through

[Chorus:]
But Iâm Giving Myself Up And Over To You
Take Me, Shape Me, Break Me, Make Me Renewed

I am tired, breaking down
Iâm unwired, tied and bound

[Chorus:]
But Iâm Giving Myself Up And Over To You
Take Me, Shape Me, Break Me, Make Me Renewed

I look to the sky, I see You all around
When I close my eyes, I dream that I am found
Youâre standing there, youâre power I can feel
You move upon me, like a river made of steel

[Chorus:]
But Iâm Giving Myself Up And Over To You
Take Me, Shape Me, Break Me, Make Me Renewed
Yes Iâm Giving Myself Up And Over To You
Take Me, Shape Me, Break Me, Make Me Renewed
