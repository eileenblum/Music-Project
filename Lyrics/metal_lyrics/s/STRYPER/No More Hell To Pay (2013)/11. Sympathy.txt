Step inside my carnival, where everythingâs a ride
Up and down, itâs all around, turning side to side
Iâm the outlaw - Iâm the law

My way or the highway â Iâm one dimensional
I broke the mold and tossed the clay, incomprehensible
Iâm the only - A rarity

[Chorus:]
As hearts degrade, can I find some sympathy?
As mercy fades, I am blind but I just I want to see

Set in stone and sealed, I seem unbreakable
In despair, a simple prayer makes change obtainable
Iâm forgiven - I forgive

[Chorus:]
As hearts degrade, can I find some sympathy?
As mercy fades, I am blind but I just I want to see

âHearts Degrading, Mercies Fadingâ [x2]

[Chorus x2:]
As hearts degrade, can I find some sympathy?
As mercy fades, I am blind but I just I want to see
