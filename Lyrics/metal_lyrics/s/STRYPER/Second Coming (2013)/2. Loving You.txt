[Verse 1]
I was so confused, not knowing what to do with myself. 
I was being used, blinded I was headed for hell. 
Then God saved me, pulled me from the heat. 
It's always on my mind. 
What a blessing that was sent to me. 
Together we will shine and... 

[Chorus]
I'm loving you. 
I'm loving you. 
I'm loving you. 
I'm loving you. 

[Verse 2]
Anger in my heart, life was such a drag for me. 
Then I made a start to serve the living God, now I'm free. 
You're my whole life, you're my lasting dream. 
It's always on my mind. 
What a blessing that was sent to me. 
Together we will shine and... 

[Repeat Chorus]
