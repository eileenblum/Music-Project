[Verse 1]
In a land of freedom 
God has sent His grace 
We're proud to live in such a place 

[Verse 2]
With the right to sing 
Song after song 
This song's for you to sing along! 

[Chorus]
Whoa-o-o-o Whoa ooo La, La 
Whoa-o-o-o Whoa ooo La, La 

[Verse 3]
Lift your voices higher 
We want to hear you sing 
Let's lift our voices to the King of King's 

[Repeat Chorus]
