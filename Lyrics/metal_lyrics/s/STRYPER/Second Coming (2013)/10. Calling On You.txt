[Verse 1]
Inside of me there is a lonely place 
Sometimes I just don't know it's there 
But when I'm all alone 
That's when I have to face... 

[Bridge]
The part of me that needs someone 
To be by my side that's when I call on... 

[Chorus]
You, You make my life complete 
You give me all I need 
You help me through and through 
I'm calling on you 

[Verse 2]
I can't explain just what You do to me 
My love grows stronger everyday 
You give me love, You give me company 
And when I have to face the rain 
You bring sunshine into my life 

[Repeat Chorus]
[Solo]
[Repeat Chorus]
