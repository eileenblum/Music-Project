[Verse 1]
We're gonna rock and have a good time 
Tonight's the night, the night we move 
Together we will stand to rock the land 
We're gonna rock for something new 
We're gonna rock for something true 
Tonight's the night so let's lift up our hands 

[Chorus]
Jesus, King, King of Kings 
Jesus, makes me wanna sing 

[Verse 2]
He makes me want to jump around 
He keeps my feet above the ground 
Tonight the night it's best to rock the land 
We're gonna rock for something new 
We're gonna rock for something true 
Tonight's the night so let's lift up our hands 

[Repeat Chorus]
