[Written by Michael Sweet]

IÂ´ve been lost and harder to find
Since i met twenty-five
In my lie, itÂ´s now do or die
And about damn time
I canÂ´t run, iÂ´m not gonna hide
In another bottle of wine
A can see my soul in a different place
I donÂ´t want to go as another case
(Of a man whoÂ´s heart is)

Blackened, blackened

IÂ´ll give blood and money to gain
The strength to stand for the call
I trust love, itÂ´s certain to change
A heart thatÂ´s born to fall
I belive i more, that i long to see
When i find my faith iÂ´ll be free
(Before my heart is)

Blackened (DonÂ´t want my mind to be)
Blackened (DonÂ´t want my soul to be)
Blackenedâ¦
