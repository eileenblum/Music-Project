[Verse 1]
She waits alone, oh every night 
Tears are in her eyes 
She has lost all the love she had 

[Verse 2]
She lived her life for Him each day 
She threw it all away 
To live for herself - live her life her way 

[Chorus]
There is no love like the love of your first love 
It's so true 
It's for you as you are 
Tears in the night 
Filled with pain 
You're running from the love 
That you had once before - your first love 

[Verse 3]
Someone to hold you though the pain 
To make you smile again 
And to protect you forever 

[Verse 4]
Someone to take your fears away 
To help you through each day 
To carry you when you just can't go on 

[Chorus]
There is no love like the love of your first love 
It's so true 
Your love will never leave you 
Tears in the night 
Filled with pain 
You're running from the love 
That you had before you cried out for your first love 

[Repeat Chorus]
