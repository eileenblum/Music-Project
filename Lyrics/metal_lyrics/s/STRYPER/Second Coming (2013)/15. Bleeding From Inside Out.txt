[Written by Michael Sweet]

YouÂ´ve lived a hard life, a self made prisoner
You built your house upon the sand 
It sharpens the dull knife that cuts and makes 
You endure
The scars that label you a â broken man

YouÂ´re bleeding from inside out 
Wounded beyond your own recognition 
YouÂ´re bandaged in fear and doubt
Brought to your knees by a life and death
Collision

You see what you want to see, a child in make belive
You rule the land where you King
ThereÂ´s rain that washes clean, the stains that 
Mark youÂ´re legacy
There is redemption â itÂ´s your destiny 

YouÂ´re bleeding from inside out 
Wounded beyond your own recognition 
YouÂ´re bandaged in fear and doubt
Brought to your knees by a life and death
Collision.
