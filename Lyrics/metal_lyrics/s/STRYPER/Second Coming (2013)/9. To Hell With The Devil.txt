[Verse 1]
Speak of the devil 
He's no friend of mine 
To turn from him is what we have in mind 

[Verse 2]
Just a liar and a thief 
The word tells us so 
We like to let him know 
Where he can go 

[Chorus]
To hell with the devil 
To hell with the devil 

[Verse 3]
When things are going wrong 
You know who to blame 
He will always live 
Up to his name 

[Verse 4]
He's never been the answer 
There's a better way 
We are here to rock you 
And to say...

[Repeat Chorus]
