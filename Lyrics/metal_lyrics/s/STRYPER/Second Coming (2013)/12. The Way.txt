[Verse 1]
I want to sing some other way 
Always the same, never a change 
What can I do to make me feel right 
Change all my ways, give up my life 

[Chorus]
Oh - What did you say? 
Oh - Christ is the way 
Rockin' for the One who is the Rock 

[Verse 2]
I feel His strength come into me 
Reading His word helps me to see 
I feel so new, I want to sing 
Feeling His joy in everything 

[Chorus]
Oh - What can I say? 
Oh - Christ is the way 
Rockin' for the One who is the Rock 
Rockin' for the One who is the Rock
