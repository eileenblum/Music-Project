[Verse 1]
They say that rock and roll is strong 
But God's the rock that makes us roll 
Don't need no drugs to help us push on 
We've got his power in our souls 

[Bridge]
Stand up and fight 
For what you believe in 
We know... 

[Chorus]
He's the rock that makes us roll 
Rockin' all the world 
Giving me the courage to be bold 
Giving me just what I need 
Always guaranteed 
He's the rock that makes me roll - rock'n'roll 

[Verse 2]
You say that rock and roll is strong 
Yes, God's the rock that makes us roll 
Don't need no drugs to help you push on 
You can have His power in your soul 
Repeat Bridge and Chorus
