[Verse 1]
Long ago, there was a man who came 
Came and died for you 
You, you say you don't want to know 
But I've got to tell you the truth 

[Chorus]
God, I will follow you because you died for me 
Gave to me your life to set me free 
Anyone who asks shall receive 
Jesus in your heart 
It's time for you to start 
Giving God all the glory 

[Verse 2]
More than a man, God almighty 
He created you 
He's the One, the One who rules the land 
He is the One I choose 

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
All of the glory today 
No matter what some people say 
All of your faith 
And your life will start to change 

[Repeat Chorus Twice]
