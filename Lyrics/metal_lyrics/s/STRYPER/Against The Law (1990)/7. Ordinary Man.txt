[Verse 1]
You try to put a tag on me, mama 
You try to make out to be so good 
You try to make love you like you think I should 
You're hearin' stories 'bout me, baby 
I'm not what you want me to be 
Before you leave me, honey 
I just want you to see 

[Chorus]
I am just what I am 
I'm an ordinary man 
If you love me, you'll understand 
I'm an ordinary man 

[Verse 2]
When we first met the fire was burning, girl 
But now I'm tied to so many things 
But I still love you, honey, please don't set me free 

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You went and left me all alone, baby 
But I still want you, girl, to see 
I'll always love you, honey, please come back to me 

[Repeat Chorus]
