[Verse 1]
I see you standin' there, oh so fine 
I can't believe my eyes Girl, I just can't seem to make you mine 
No matter how hard I try 

[Bridge 1]
I've never wanted any one more than you 
Girl, I'm hopin' that you're wantin' me too 

[Chorus]
Lady, I wanna be your man 
Lady...

[Verse 2]
Won't you tell me what I've gotta do 
To win over your heart 
This feeling inside is something new 
It's tearin' me apart 

[Bridge 2]
I never dreamed I would meet someone like you 
Won't you tell me that you're feelin' it too 

[Repeat Chorus]
Baby, I'll love you all I can 
Lady...
