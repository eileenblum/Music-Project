[Verse 1]
We're the thundering sons 
We're the undying ones 
With the power of good 
Evil has never won 

[Bridge 1]
With armies from heaven 
We have fought with a rage 
It's all in the rhythm 
And the fire coming from the stage 

[Chorus]
We will rock the hell out of you 
We will rock the hell out of you 

[Verse 2]
In the streets every day 
We search for anyone 
Who will fight anyway 
Until the battle's won 

[Bridge 2]
We thrust in our sabres 
With the words that we sing 
It's all in the rhythm 
And the power coming from the stage 

[Repeat Chorus]
[Repeat Bridge 1]
[Repeat Chorus]
