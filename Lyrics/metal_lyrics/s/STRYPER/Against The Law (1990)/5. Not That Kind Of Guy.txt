[Verse 1]
I see you lookin' at me baby 
I know what's on your mind 
You just wanna come to my place 
And have a real good time 
Even though you look so fine 
My reputation's on the line 
I don't give my love away for free 
Baby don't you throw yourself at me 

[Chorus]
When I say no way you ask me why 
Can't you see I'm not that kind of guy 

[Verse 2]
Don't go cryin' to your friends babe 
They won't understand 
Call my mama and she'll tell you 
I just ain't that type of man 
Don't be playin' silly games 
Girls like you are all the same 
I would love to take your hand 
But baby, I don't need no one night stand 

[Repeat Chorus]
