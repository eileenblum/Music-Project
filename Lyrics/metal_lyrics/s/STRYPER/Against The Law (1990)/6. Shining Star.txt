Shining star for you to see 
What your life can truly be 

When you wish upon a star
Dreams will take you very far
But when you wish upon a dream
Life ain't always what it seems
What you see, it looks so near
In the sky so very clear

[Chorus]
You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you can truly be
Truly be

Shining star comes into view
To shine it's watchful light on you
Give you strength to carry on
Make your body big and strong

So if you find yourself in need
You've got to listen to these words of heed
Be a giant or grain of sand
Words of wisdom, yes i can

[Repeat Chorus]

[Fade]
Shining star for you to see 
What your life can truly be
