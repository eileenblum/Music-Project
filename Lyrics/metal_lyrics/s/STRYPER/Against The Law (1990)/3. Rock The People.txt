[Verse 1]
From the time I was a boy 
I knew what I was born to do 
Instead of playing with my toys 
I'd play my songs, that's all I knew 

[Bridge]
With a guitar in my hands everyday 
My heart and soul would always say 

[Chorus]
Rock the people 
Rock the people 

[Verse 2]
Now I've been around the world 
I can't believe what I have seen 
I've rocked with every guy and girl 
Sometimes I think it's all a dream 

[Repeat Bridge]
[Repeat Chorus]
[Repeat Bridge]
[Repeat Chorus]
