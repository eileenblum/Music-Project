[Verse 1]
Take a look around, won't ya tell me what you see 
Is there love to be found in this world's pain and misery? 
Tell me, will it ever change? 

[Chorus]
All for one and one for all 
Isn't that the way that it should be 
Will we ever change this world? 
United we will stand up tall 
United we will never fall 
If it's all for one and one for all 

[Verse 2]
Days are going by, its up to you to make a start
Before this world of ours turns to dust and falls apart
Right now I know we can make a change 

[Chorus]
All for one and one for all 
Isn't that the way that it should be 
Will we ever save this world? 
United we will stand up tall 
United we will never fall 
If it's all for one and one for all 

[Repeat Chorus]
