[Verse 1]
Livin' life on a wire 
Never knowin' what to do 
Cryin' to find me a reason to stay with you 
Then I saw you with someone 
Oooh babe now I know 

[Chorus]
I gotta lay low, just let go 
I gotta say no, girl just go 
I'm sayin' two time girl I don't want you to stay 
I took a real blow, hurt me so 
You hit me real low, now I know 
I'm sayin' two time woman don't come back this way 

[Verse 2]
Hangin' out at a party 
All my friends everywhere 
Thought you were right beside me but you weren't there 
Then I caught you with someone else 
That's the end of the show 

[Repeat Chorus Twice]
I took a real blow, hurt me so 
You hit me real low, now I know 
I'm sayin' two time woman don't come back this way 
Don't come back
