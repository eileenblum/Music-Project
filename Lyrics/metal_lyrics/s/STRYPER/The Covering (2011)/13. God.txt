Oh, oh, oh, oh!

Hearts are weeping, soulâs are keeping on ice
Spirits dying, wickedness wonât suffice
Those who cared, they stop and stare at the wall
Doing nothing, watching prisoners fall

The sun is falling from the sky
The earth is cold and still

[Chorus]

God - have mercy on us
For we know not what we do
God â dark and blinded, we are burning
Without You â God!

Yeah, oh, oh!

Without conscience, without warning at all
We kill the wounded, crushing those who crawl
Canât we see that life, is hung by a thread
In the end our flesh is buried and dead

Mountains crumble, rivers swell
The tide is taking all

[Repeat chorus]
