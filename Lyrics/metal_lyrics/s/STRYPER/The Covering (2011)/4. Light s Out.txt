[originally by UFO]

Wind blows back and the batons charging
It winds all the way
Right to the butt of my gun
Maybe now your time has come

From the back streets thereâs a rumblinâ

Smell of anarchy
No more nice time, bright boy shoe shines
Pie in the sky dreams

[*] Lights out, lights out in London
Hold âem tight âtil the end
Better now you know weâll never
Wait âtil tomorrow
Lights out, lights out in London
Hold âem tight âtil the end
God knows when Iâm cominâ on (my) run

Heaven help those who help themselves
Thatâs the way it goes
The frightening thoughts of whatâs been taught
And now it shows

[* repeat]

[instrumental]

[* repeat]

You keep cominâ, thereâs no runninâ
Tried a thousand times
Under your feet grass is growinâ
Time we said goodbye

[* repeat]

Lights out, lights out in London

Lights out, lights out in London
