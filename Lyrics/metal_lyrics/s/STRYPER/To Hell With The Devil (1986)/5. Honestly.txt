[Verse 1]
Honestly, I believe in you 
Do you trust in me 
Patiently, I will stand by you 
I will stand beside you faithfully 

[Bridge]
And through the years 
I will be a friend 
For always and forever 

[Chorus]
Call on me and I'll be there for you 
I'm a friend who always will be true 
And I love you can't you see 
That I can say I love you honestly 

[Solo]

[Chorus 2]
Call on me and I'll be there for you 
I'm a friend who always will be true 
And I love you can't you see 
That I love you honestly 
I will never betray your trust in me 
And I love you can't you see 
That I can say I love you honestly
