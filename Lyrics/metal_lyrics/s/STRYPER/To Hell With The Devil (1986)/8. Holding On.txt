[Verse 1]
Everyone has been hurt before - love will come and go 
When you put your faith in something so unsure 
Never happy and wanting more - love will never grow 
Till you put your faith in something that's secure 

[Chorus]
I'm holding on to the One from above 
The One that's secure the one that has cured 
My broken heart with perfect love 

[Verse 2]
I never thought it would be this good 
I never even dreamed that someone could make my 
Life so complete 
So if you're hurting and wanting more 
No matter how it seems you can have it all 
If you will just believe 

[Bridge]
That someone is there for you 
To catch you when you fall 
To make your life brand new 
To give you all 

[Repeat Chorus]
