[Verse 1]
Free to turn away - say goodbye 
Free to walk away - and deny 
The gift waiting for you 
Whispers a still small voice 
It's your choice - you're.. 

[Chorus]
Free - Free to do what you want to 
Choose your own destiny 
Free to do what you want to 
Free to open up - and believe 
Free to simply ask - and receive 
There's no better time than now 
You've got the right to choose 
You can't lose - you're... 

[Repeat Chorus]
