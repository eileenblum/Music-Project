[Verse 1]
Singing out what I believe 
Singing out for you 
Never want to push you can't you see 
We just want to spread the news 
In a different way 
Rock the world but rock it with the truth 

[Bridge]
You want it 
We got it 
Rock that lifts you up it doesn't bring you down 
Stand for it 
Fight for it 
We are... 

[Chorus]
Rockin' the world for You, Holy One 
Rockin' the world for You, and your son 

[Verse 2]
If you want to rock the world 
Come along with me 
Spread the news to every boy and girl 
Singing out what we believe 
Singing out for truth 
Opening our eyes so we can see 

[Repeat Chorus]
