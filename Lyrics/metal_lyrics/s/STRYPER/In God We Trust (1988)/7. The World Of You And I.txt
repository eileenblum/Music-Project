[Verse 1]
You're out there all alone 
Searching endlessly for a home 
You're happiness has gone away 
Then you hear somebody say 

[Chorus]
We can have what everybody dreams about 
We can say hello and never say goodbye 
Love can last forever without any doubt 
In the world of you and I 

[Verse 2]
You've go to keep your faith 
Follow me I'll lead the way 
There doesn't have to be any pain 
Forever you and I will reign 

[Repeat Chorus]
