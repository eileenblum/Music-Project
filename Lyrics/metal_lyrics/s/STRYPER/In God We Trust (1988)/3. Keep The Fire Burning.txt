[Verse 1]
We've been through a lot together 
We've seen what some will never see, you and me 
Prayer after prayer's been answered 
We can't go on without belief, can't you see? 

[Chorus]
We just gotta be strong 
Keep the fire burning 
Gotta move on, keep our hearts from turning 
Gotta hold on, onto what you're learning now 
And never let go 

[Verse 2]
Nothing can stop us now 
We're growing stronger every day in every way 
Spreading the word together 
It doesn't matter what they say, no way! 

[Repeat Chorus]
