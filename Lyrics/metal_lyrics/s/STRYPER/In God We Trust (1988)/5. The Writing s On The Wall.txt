[Verse 1]
The truth is right before you 
Don't refuse it 
No matter what you've been through 
He can change it cause 

[Chorus]
He is our God, Creator of all 
Unless you accept Him, you'll continue to fall 
The battle is real, on you He will call 
So don't ever wait because the writing's on the wall 

[Verse 2]
Just look around and 
You will see confusion 
The God that Stryper serves 
Is no delusion cause 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Don't wait till tomorrow 
Tomorrow's too late (tomorrow's too late) 
You've heard the truth so what will you do 
Who will you choose? 
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh) 

[Repeat Chorus]
