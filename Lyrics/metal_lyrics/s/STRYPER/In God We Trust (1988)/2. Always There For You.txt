[Verse 1]
Love can be so cold 
And loneliness gets old 
More than words or broken promises 
I want to show you what true love is 

[Chorus]
I'm always there for you 
I'll always stand by you 
When the world has closed the door 
And you can't go on anymore 
I'm always there for you 

[Verse 2]
You've been hurt before 
And you don't want anymore 
There's a better way for you 
Believe in me, I'll see you through 

[Repeat Chorus]
