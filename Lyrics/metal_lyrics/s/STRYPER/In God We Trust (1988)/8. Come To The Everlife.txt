[Verse 1]
A new life to live, a new heart to give 
No sorrow no pain, new bodies to gain 
Peace and harmony found, love will be all around 

[Chorus]
Come with me tonight 
Come to the everlife 
We will see new life in the sky 

[Verse 2]
You don't have to lose, you just have to choose 
Just call on His name, you won't be the same 
Lift your hearts up today 
Put your troubles away 

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge 1]
New life so endless and free 
Just lift your hearts up, you'll see 

[Bridge 2]
Peace and harmony found 
Love will be all around 
Lift your hearts up today 
Put your troubles away 

[Repeat Chorus]
