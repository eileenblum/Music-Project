[Verse 1]
Once upon a lonely night 
Emptiness filled my heart 
And I realized my life wasn't right
Searching never finding, day after day
Then I called upon your name 
And I just want to say 

[Chorus]
I was lonely, lost without your love 
Sad and lonely without you 
Your the only one that I'll ever love 
I need you 

[Verse 2]
All I'll ever need is you 
Cause you are everything 
I've never seen a love that's so true 
The search is over now for me and forever more 
And I'll never have to be lonely anymore 

[Repeat Chorus]
