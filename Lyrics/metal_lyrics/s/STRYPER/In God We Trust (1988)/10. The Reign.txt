[Verse 1]
Cars, mansions and planes
Income that never refrains
The more you receive, the less you believe
In His name

[Verse 2]
There will come a day
When this will all pass away
The world will die and millions will cry
To be saved

[Chorus]
King of Kings
And Lord of all is He
Come and be a part of the reign

[Verse 3]
Pride, fortune and fame
Glory given to your name
A heart filled with greed is planting a seed
With no shame

[Verse 4]
There will come a day
When you will soon pass away
The Son will deny and then you will cry
To be saved

[Repeat Chorus]
