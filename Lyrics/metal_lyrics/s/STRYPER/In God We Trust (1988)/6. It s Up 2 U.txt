[Verse 1]
Let's join together and make a stand 
Let's make a change throughout our land 
Renew our bodies, spirits, minds and hearts 
It's up 2 U to make a start 

[Chorus]
Come on everybody 
Put your hands up in the air 
Just move to the rhythm 
Join in people everywhere 

[Verse 2]
There is an answer for these troubled times 
Together we can make it right 
Renew your body, spirit, mind and heart 
It's up to you to make a start 

[Repeat Chorus]
