I choke, and a sour taste escapes my mouth
I freeze when slowly all the lights fade out
I cry for help but words donât seem to carry through the gloom
I crawl into the corner of my mattressed room

I lose control
Something takes hold of me
(And I) fight (to break) free
(From the) grip (tightening) a(round) my soul

If I had known there was a monster deep inside of me
I would have known that I belong in isolation cellsâ¨I wouldnât hesitate to end it all and set me free
a simple accident will mark the end of my distress
and all I hear are funeral bells as I am laid to rest

I hide from something lurking just outside my view
I try to block the visions out but they keep breaking through
I scream as shady figures slither down the matressed walls
I crouch and watch it all break as the monster calls

I close my eyes
Wait (to be) anesthetized
(or) soon I will fall (and the)
monster will rise

If I had known there was a monster deep inside of me
I would have known that I belong in isolation cellsâ¨I wouldnât hesitate to end it all and set me free
a simple accident will mark the end of my distress
and all I hear are funeral bells as I am laid to rest

I lose controlâ¨itâs taking hold of me

If I had known there was a monster deep inside of me
I would have known that I belong in isolation cellsâ¨I wouldnât hesitate to end it all and set me free
a simple accident will mark the end of my distress
and all I hear are funeral bells as I am laid to rest
