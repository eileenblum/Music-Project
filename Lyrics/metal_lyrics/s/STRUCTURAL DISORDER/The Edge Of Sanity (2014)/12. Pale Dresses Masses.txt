In this place from distant dreams
Here headstones mark where old friends sleep
Your song raise from the open tomb
Now there's no horror, there's no wounds
Your hair glance in the wind, you smell like sunshine

Give me strength and lead me through the pale dressed masses
let me still embrace you, kiss you and caress you, Let me walk beside you, never be without you, make me whole
Tell me that reality is but a work of art

I feel that I'm coming home
Won't live afraid, won't die alone
My flesh is stardust, souls will soar
When long lost heartbeats float ashore
Your smile will linger on, your song will find me

Give me strength and lead me through the pale dressed masses
let me still embrace you, kiss you and caress you, Let me walk beside you, never be without you, make me whole
Tell me that reality is but a painting
Tell me that our heaven is beyond that bend
