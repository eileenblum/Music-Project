In the silent morning I wake up to see the one I love the most,
she's lying next to me, breathing still

And I feel that everything I need is you right now (and) forever

It is not a lonely world if we're together
It is not a cruel world, if you are here, there's no fear
And I wish that I could freeze this moment, and preserve this feeling

And so I carry this so deep inside
She was my whole, was my bride
All these things left behind
leave me no peace of mind

Her golden hair is messy on the wrinkled bedding
Suddenly she opens up her eyes and she smiles at me
She stretches out her arms, gives me a kiss and then she says 'good morning'

We make love since there's no rush for work and then we
Walk downstairs, I grab my bags and leave her there, unaware
that this day will stick in mind and soothe my pain inside, forever

But then what happened? Is she still alive?
When did I leave her behind?
Pieces I cannot find
Leave me no peace of mind
