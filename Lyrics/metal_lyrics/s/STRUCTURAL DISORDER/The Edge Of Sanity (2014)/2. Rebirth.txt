Free my soul from this sickened mindâ¦

Feel me,
trapped inside me
wonât you see me,
Help me end this story,
it distorts me,
wonât you grasp me,
Falling deeper and deeper
So help me
I am begging
Wonât you free me,
Because deep inside me
There is something,
Like a bird in a rotten cage of flesh

Free me from this sickened mind,
and from these wicked sights
Help me turn the tide,
at least, help me die

Panic takes over me,
Iâm falling, nowhere to flee,
I am screaming my voice away,
no-one hears me, why does it have to be so damn cold?

[Spoken:]
âStill I can see all that could have been
We, as a family, but all thatâs left is this nightmare of a lifeâ

Free my soul from this sickened mind

Feel me,
trapped inside me
wonât you see me,
no-oneâs praying for me,
it distorts me,
wonât you grasp me,
falling deeper and deeper,
so kill me, as a favour,
wonât you do it,
please just do it for me,
I am waiting,
wonât you just put a bullet in my fucking brain

Free me, from this sickened mind
and from these wicked sights,
help me turn the tide,
at least, help me die
