I woke up tomorrow and the colors were all dullâ¨
I was stuck with gnawing headache, like a drill put through my skullâ¨
And it seemed just to get stronger, I had never felt such pain before

On this ocean of confusion, I heard an unknown voiceâ¨
I was lost in my delusion and I never had a choiceâ¨
Because this was the sound of reason, this was what I had been chosen forâ¨â¨

He poisoned me that moment when he stepped right up from hellâ¨
You see, no man has a perfect and impenetrable shellâ¨
He got me while I slumbered, he got me while my guard was down
Sensing his perfection, I had never felt so smallâ¨
He said, "Open you eyes", and I stepped right through the wallâ¨
To the far side of the fences, I had never been that far from homeâ¨â¨

Awake my ghoulsâ¨
They stain my soulâ¨
They preach my doomâ¨
They raise my tombâ¨â¨

Corpse Candles, â¨Embrace me, keeps me awakeâ¨
Who will sleep well tonightâ¨
Corpse Candles,â¨Within me, leading astrayâ¨
As I follow the lightâ¨â¨

The scenery is changing, and I know what happens thenâ¨
As I see things through this doorway that was never ment for menâ¨
And I sympathise with Dante, although he of course was wrong about hellâ¨â¨
And I will call out for mercy, and my guide will show me graceâ¨
While he leave me in control again, for now in any caseâ¨
And I fall right to the floor, the floor of this very god damned cell

Awake my ghoulsâ¨
They stain my soulâ¨
They preach my doomâ¨
They raise my tombâ¨â¨

Corpse Candles, â¨Embrace me, keeps me awakeâ¨
Who will sleep well tonightâ¨
Corpse Candles,â¨Within me, leading astrayâ¨
As I follow the lightâ¨â¨

Silent morning, never-ending days and dreaded nightsâ¨
And what use is there for colors if the room is naked whiteâ¨
But I know that it's nothing compared to this inner custodyâ¨â¨
The sun is but a memory, the moon is never upâ¨
And my head is like a highway where the traffic never stopsâ¨
At least I'm not all lonely, at least he keeps me company
