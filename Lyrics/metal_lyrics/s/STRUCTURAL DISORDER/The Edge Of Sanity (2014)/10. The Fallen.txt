Scenes from long gone days pass me by
Hidden like the tears of sorrow blinding my sight
And noone is here to tell me why
It all had to end this way, and why she suffered that night

But the voice was too strong, too resentful,
feeding on the shadows inside
Forever there, taking me over,
aiming to kill all bright in my life

He told me to pull every trigger,
told me not to hesitate
And I was just too weak to question,

turning everything I loved to dust in time
My blood on the floor
I saw it before
But it wasnât mine that time, no it wasnât
I still see the knife
How she prayed for her life
And I wouldnt have done it, I wouldnât have done it if it wasnât for the reason inside.

[Spoken:]
âForever trapped
Forever trapped
Forever trapped, Iâm the fallen
Iâm the fallen, forever
Not too human, but it hurts
How it hurts to be trapped, forever Noone prays for the fallen, right?â

Scenes from long gone days pass me by
One day maybe I can see it through
Till then I will call out the question why
As the fallen, but I know there is no escape from you

When her very last breath broke the silence,
I couldnât hear the voice inside
And suddenly I was more lonely
than I had ever been in my life

I yelled her name, god knows I shook her,
kissed her lips and struck her hair
But the tears I cried could never have held them,
the spirits of my wife and my unborn child

Oh, the scenes that pass me byâ¦
