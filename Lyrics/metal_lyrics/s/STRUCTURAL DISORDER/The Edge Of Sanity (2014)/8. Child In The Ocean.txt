Time will slowly get the hold of me
I surrender to tranquility
So close and lock the doors, ignore the raging war
battles roaring within me

All the torn and frightened faces
hiding in the darkest places
Makes me feel sick and so infected
Yet rejected, disconnected
Past is strong, the present kneeling
Haunted by these walls and ceiling
nothing to read but empty pages
face defeat to silent cages

Nothing were between us and the sunset
On this place we could not be found
You saw me in the last light
And whispered that you knew there was life inside

The darkening sea was vast and we were silent
The pulsing blood was warm, unspoiled
We vanished in the long shades
and found a river running through sacred soil

And life would run through us
(through heart and through spine)
this life designed by us
(of wondrous design)
And I believed so much in you and me
(our blood intertwined)

Never come here, stay away from me
You might find this cell an open sea
this far from every shore, the stormy weather roars
better cling to the debris

Darkest ages, darkest hours
burning ice and freezing fires
climbing up but the starway's falling
keep on tossing, spinning, crawling
Turn around without directions
heal the wounds with new infections
Hear the silence, taste the hunger
bad dreams penetrates your slumber
