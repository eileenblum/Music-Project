Closed eyes lay open wide

Calm inside, thought is clear and tears will dry

Old wounds are sterilized, I
'm paralyzed by whatever's been applied

And somewhere the moon will rise,
but clouds made of concrete block out the sky

and I never found the time
to count all the stars, nor to memorize

Breath is moving slow
Stable signs, looking fine but feeling cold
They must never know
That I've escaped from the dead fluorescent glow

And still the morning star
may shine from the dark matter pedestal

And venus and mars align,
as I move away, away from imprisoning time

(I move away)
As I move away
Away from this prison of time
(I move away)
As I move away

Away from imprisoning time

In the silent morning I step out from a world where I lived before
Failing every warning, losing all that I earned, every soul I've adored

Burn it all, I sense the skies
I may fall, but then arise

Door stands open, light shines in
Burning walls will melt away
Wash my hands, forgive my sins
Lead me out, I went astray

Open doors
Light shines in
Wash my hands
Forgive my sins

Walls will melt away, burning down, washing out
hear me out, I went astray, lead me out, take me home todayâ¨â¨
(Free my soul, and forgive my sins)

Free my soul from this sickened mindâ¨
Free my soul from this sickened mind
