Sleepwalking shadows â¨
Adamant decisions beyond my controlâ¨
A firm grip that tightens â¨
Around my mind, around my soul â¨â¨

Artificial veils are woven â¨
A bitter taste, a putrid stench of fear â¨
Once again, the grip it tightens
â¨As I see myself fading away â¨â¨

Save me I am drowning â¨
In this ocean, no emotions in me â¨
I feel hollow and uncertain â¨
I canât see through the veil spun by needles â¨

I am begging wonât you free me â¨
because deep inside me â¨
there is nothing
where there once stood a mindâ¨â¨

Imaginary friends still linger â¨
Shadows from a pleasant past â¨
I reach out my hand to touch them â¨
just inches away from my grasp â¨â¨

Please just lead me home again â¨
Please donât let her fade away â¨
Lay this weary mind to sleep â¨
As the demon lingers in the deep â¨â¨

I can feel how my hands are shaking, caused by my abstinenceâ¨ â¨

[Spoken:]
âI donât recognize my own reflection, I donât recognize my own actions,
Hell â I donât even recognize my own dreams anymore!
Thisâ¦ medicatedâ¦ drugged beingâ¦ itâ¦ it isnât who I am!ââ¨

I can feel how my mind is breaking with every breath I take â¨â¨

[Spoken:]
âI wonât swallow anymore pills and I wonât let you come near me with those fucking needles again, you hear me?!
I wonâtâ¦ I want to remember! I want to fucking remember!â â¨

I can feel how my soul is fading, leaving behind an empty shell â¨
I can feel how my heart is bleeding, knowing that it will soon be goneâ¨
I can sense my memories fading, leaving me in the bitter cold â¨
I can feel how I am breaking as I let the pills go down â¨â¨

Please just lead me home again â¨
Please donât let her fade away â¨
Lay this weary mind to sleep â¨
As the demon lingers in the deep
