Can you save me from myself?
Tell me why I love this pain, and why I'll self-destruct with every move I make.
I'm taken to the edge.
All that I loved removed from me; where I had cared, there's only suffering.
This part of me.
Tell me why I cannot escape from this hate.
These feelings, emotions, are just a fucking waste, for from them comes nothing; I dream, then I awake.
I struggle day by day; how much can one man take?
I'm far too strong to break.
All by myself, I'll stand alone.
All by myself, I'll walk this path alone.
I'll stand apart from what they are.
I carry the strength to stand alone.
I need no one to take me back, I realize I can't be saved.
I struggle to become a better man today than I was yesterday, but something's in the way.
Watched my life slip away; consumed by memories.
Surrounded by weakness, I watch you all decay.
This world is fucking dead to me, and I've become your enemy.
Dead to me.
