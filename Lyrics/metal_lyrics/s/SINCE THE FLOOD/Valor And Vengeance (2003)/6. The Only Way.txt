Never again.
I see the fire in your eyes.
You don't like what you see or hear.
You know there's nothing you can do.
That's what separates me from you.
I see your anger and taste your fear.
What you're thinking is a bad idea.
You have been warned.
Patience, I have none.
Things could've been different.
You brought this on yourself.
I sacrifice for my family, and nobody else.
And you thought I'd give up.
I bet you thought I'd quit.
Just save that act you play for someone else, because I don't buy your shit.
You've got a lot to learn about respect.
Think before you speak to me, unless you want to learn the hard way.
It's part of my life.
