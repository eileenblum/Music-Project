[re-issue bonus track]

Nothing in common; I'm not like you.
You don't fucking know me, and you never will.
Not an ounce of faith in you, I will never trust.
I will give you nothing more.
Ashes to ash, dust to fucking dust.
Laid to rest.
Give your opinion when I never ask.
You're so quick to tell me what you think.
You said I've changed.
How would you know?
You didn't know me long enough.
What the fuck made you think I care what you think of me?
What the fuck made you think I care?
You're nothing to me.
I cannot relate to you.
There's something you need to prove.
What made you think I'd let you in?
My friends are few and far between.
I know your kind, so save your breath.
Look out for number one and fuck the rest.
Your concept of friendship is not my kind.
The trials come and go, and I'm glad they're fucking gone.
