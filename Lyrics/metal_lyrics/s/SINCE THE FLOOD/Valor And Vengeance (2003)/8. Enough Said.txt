The way you live is not alright; it's time to fight.
It's time for you to make the changes in your life.
Don't quit, stand up and fight.
Can't wait, the time is now.
I can't understand, why are you willing to take that fall?
I will not stand by and watch you come apart.
I owe it to you, you owe it to me, and through it all, we stood as one.
Until the end, we'll stand as one.
Enough said, quit holding back; you see what's wrong.
It's been this way for too long.
In my life, I see it's time to make a change.
Let's start tonight.
