You failed me.
I should have known it long ago.
In my eyes, you've torn apart everything we had; and for what?
Afraid to be a man, afraid to take a stand.
I've grown tired, tired of you and your half-hearted ways.
I thought you were on my side, but you were in my way.
I let you waste my time.
You can't take back what's gone.
You're too afraid to lose, and I've lost all my life.
I have been betrayed.
How can you live with yourself?
If I were you, I could not look me in the eye.
There'll be no more holding back.
Save your excuses, your actions say enough.
First time, last time, you failed; you're in my way.
I'd be there for you.
If you needed me.
I wouldn't hesitate, now I'd just walk away.
You won't fail me again.
