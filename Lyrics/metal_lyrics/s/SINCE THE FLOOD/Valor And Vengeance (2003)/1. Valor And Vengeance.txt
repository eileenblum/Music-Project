I am not alone.
So here we go again, feels like we cannot win.
Our backs against the wall, like so many times before.
No matter what is said, no matter what we do.
There's one thing that holds true; you for me, and I for you.
Us against the world, that's the way it is, and in you I find the strength to overcome.
I will not back down.
I can't close my eyes.
I refuse to take less than what I gave.
You've given me strength.
The strength to overcome what I cannot change.
The power to destroy whatever's in my way.
There's no more looking back, only straight ahead.
Open my eyes and come alive with a brand new strength.
You give me strength, strength to rise above.
I can't believe how far we've come.
Moving forward.
