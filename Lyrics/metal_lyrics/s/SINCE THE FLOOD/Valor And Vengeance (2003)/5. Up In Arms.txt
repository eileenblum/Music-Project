Born into this, cast, I never asked for this.
I don't belong.
I never will.
Searching, still I search for a reason.
To belong, unaccepted amongst the rest.
The way I live...
I despise all you are.
Once I tried, once I cared, but now that has all changed.
I reserve no pity for you, hate your kind and all that you do.
I will never change my ways.
I will not become your slave.
I will never bow to you.
I'll never see things your way.
Don't want to live like you.
You all make me sick.
There is no light at the end of my road.
No bright future; caught in a stranglehold.
Was born into this; I never asked for this.
Slowly slipping away, goodbye.
Never will I see eye to eye with you.
Outcast.
