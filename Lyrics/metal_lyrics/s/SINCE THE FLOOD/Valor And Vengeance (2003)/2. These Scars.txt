Watching the paper bleeding my pen bone dry.
Words flow, yet I am still alone, conscious but barely breathing.
Watch my life pass me by.
You've taken my heart for a ride; put my will to the test.
All I wanted was to make you happy, but I'm dying inside.
If I had to paint a picture of my mind, it would be your face against the sunlight.
You are larger than life to me, and I hoped we'd share one destiny.
The hardest thing I've ever tried to do was set you free.
You're free, but I'm so empty.
Now what have we become?
What will tomorrow bring for us?
Forever a part of my life, you'll always have my trust.
Look what we put ourselves through.
I cannot justify these tears, though I understood all of your fear.
Right now, there is no turning back.
Every time I try to live, with everything I have to give, something's always, always in my way.
What's left for me?
