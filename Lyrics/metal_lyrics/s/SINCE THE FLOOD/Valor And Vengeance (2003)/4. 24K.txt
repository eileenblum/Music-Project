For you, I'd die tonight.
For you, I'd give my life.
No one can take what we have, our bond is too strong; brothers for so long.
In my eyes, you'll do no wrong, and that's the way this just has to be.
When I was down, when times were tough, you were right there to lift me up.
I hope you know that if you ever need me, don't hesitate; I will be right here waiting.
More than a friend, my boys are family.
The day it ends?
The day my heart stops beating.
You're alweays there for me.
I'm always here for you.
More than blood, understood.
When I'm near, have no fear.
I'll separate those phony ones who try to pretend; they won't last long.
God help the man that gets in your way.
I'd throw down at the thought, and watch him bleed.
I have your back, just like you have mine.
Never turn my back on my brother.
