I can't look back; I don't have the time.
I've been down before, and I've picked myself up.
it's never easy, but you can't get caught up.
Just keep your head high and live for today.
When you feel alone, you need to get to a show and let it out.
If I feel alone, I need to get to a show and let it all go.
When I feel alone, and there ain't shit in my life that's going right, need to find a show and let it all go.
