In my eyes, you've taken the last, in and out of my life that fast.
The way we were, never again will we be.
I watched you change, you watched me suffer endlessly.
Now you've afraid, afraid to lay in the bed you made.
You have no fucking loyalty.
More than a fucking game to me.
I wish that I could make you see.
You'll never understand, you'll never have the heart I have in me.
Never have, never will.
My loyalty, my sacrifice, left me for dead.
I'm moving on; life without you is easier.
What I've felt for you has been removed, 'cause you're no friend.
You're fucking weak, and nothing more, there's no love lost.
I see right through you.
No one needs you here.
You will hold nothing sacred; you have no heart.
I always knew you'd break this, weak from the start.
You thought that you could just take; you never gave.
No reason for you 'round here, don't show your face.
You have no heart.
Break the bond that never was.
Where's your heart?
Where's your pride?
