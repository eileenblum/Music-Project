from sacrifice comes strength.
strength what makes a man strength within these hands
strength above the rest strength that can't be broken to stand alone to face my fears
to hold my head high and do what it takes without a second thought Power that can't be bought
strength what makes a man strength within these hands
strength above the rest strength that can't be broken
not afraid to struggle it's part of my life it only makes me stronger
I've learned from my mistakes I learned through pain I learned though sacrifice
to do what it takes without a second thought for those I love for those who give me strength.
