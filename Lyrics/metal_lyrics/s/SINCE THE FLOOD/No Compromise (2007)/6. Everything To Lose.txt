I can't take this anymore I'm done nothing is ever good enough feel like the world is on my shoulders
just one wrong move could destroy all that I know I'm losing sight I can't 'til what's right
and everyday becomes a struggle just to get by.
where did I go wrong what happened to life I led
it used to be simple I've grown cold watching time stand still where did I go wrong everyday is now a fight
nothing's easy anyone I can't take it away nothing's ever good enough there's gotta be a better way.
this ain't the way I wanna live they'll take until there's nothing left to give I gave up caring long ago.
everyday I carry the weight of the world with nothing to gain and everyday I lose
why should I try? why should I care? nothing to gain and everything to lose.
