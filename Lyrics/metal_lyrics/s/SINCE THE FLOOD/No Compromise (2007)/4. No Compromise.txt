there is no compromise here's how it will be one look inside these eyes and you can see what can't be stopped
we've come to far to turn back now we've worked to hard shed too much blood
can't turn back now, won't look back now.
no compromise.
everything we've built and everything we've done
we've done it on our own no help from anyone.
for all we've done and what's to come
we won't change not for anyone we won't change not for anything no compromise
we've come to far to turn back now we've worked to hard shed too much blood.
