Days pass, the nights grow cold and I can still hear your voice.
whisper the words to me you know I need to hear.
reassure that this won't change no matter how much time we share.
broken promises are all I have left.
all that I have.
I know that it was hard for you to say goodbye.
I didn't want to let you go.
too hurt to fight.
people come and go in life, that's just the way it is, but I'm damned if you stay I'm damned anyway, what have we become?
for all the years spent, both of our lives touched, promise me one thing, don't ever change.
it's a cold cruel world but don't be afraid
it won't break you down, the way it broke me down.
you were my last hope for finding good in this world a heart as pure as gold
your voice shined warmth through cold.
I know you'll make it, you make me wanna believe, there was something out there
something for me.
