every step I take they'll try, try to bring me down try and try again
but I'm not built that way I live for myself not for anyone else they don't like the way I live my life
that's alright it doesn't mean a thing to me think I'm going to change because of what they say.
there's no way they'll never get the best of me.
I will never change the way I live my life.
I will never change I'm proud of who I am
you don't understand my life just want to look down on me
don't tell me who I'm supposed to be don't question the values I have
don't question what matters to me what matters to me I'll never change my ways
you're wasting your time I'm not built that way I live for myself don't try to change me
you have to understand I am what I am I live my life the way I like
don't try to change what you don't understand I will never change the way I live my life.
I will never change I am proud of who I am
