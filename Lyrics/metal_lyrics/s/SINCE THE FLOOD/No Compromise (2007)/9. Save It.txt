the walls are closing in goodbye to everything separate just let me be alone stay away don't ask me what's wrong
stay away take one step back I don't need your help I never asked
I can handle this alone on my own everybody's got the answers but no one what's to help themselves
you're becoming the problem I don't want to hear a fucking word you have to say
I don't want to hear it so save your breath just let me be I don't want it I don't need it
your opinion means nothing to me I've always been on my own so shut your mouth and fucking leave me alone.
