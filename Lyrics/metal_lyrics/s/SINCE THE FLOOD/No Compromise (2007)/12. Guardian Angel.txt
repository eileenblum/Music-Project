until we meet again you know you're always on my mind I know you're right here by my side.
I know you're looking down.
I feel you watching over me I know you're with me when I fall, you still protect me from myself
I know you're looking down, I feel you watching over me arms raised to the sky I try my best each day
to carry on your name you're more, much more than just a memory.
my life was shaped by the love that you gave me
until we meet again.
when I get lost, you help me find my way and when I'm down you're always there for me
can't forget you.
I cherish every moment we shared while you were here with me.
I won't let go
I never got to say goodbye but you're still with me I know you're here.
I try my best each day to carry on your name.
you're more, much more than just a memory
until the day we're together again I know you'll be right here watching over me.
you know you're always on my mind.
I know you're still right here by my side.
