power.
it's mine.
you'll learn.
in time justice for them move fast.
I am revenge.
waiting in the dark.
smile on my face.
the story has two sides you chose what was not mine for them I'd fight
prepared to cross the line.
you made your stand, I hold your fate in my hands
I can't forget I can't just let you walk away.
no fucking way, not on my life, not on my time not while I'm alive
you chose your path you chose to fight there's one way out, you'll pay the price
crossed.
crossed my path you stand against when I strike back is when it ends
I am revenge here to make this right I am revenge I am the end.
