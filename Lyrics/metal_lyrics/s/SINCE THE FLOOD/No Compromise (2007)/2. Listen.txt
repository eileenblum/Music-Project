I fucking spelled it out for you, I made it crystal clear.
tried so many ways to tell you you didn't wanna hear
the writing's on the walls my friend but you still cannot see.
the picture you made in your hear head it's not reality.
get over it.
move on with your life.
there was nothing there for you and we all hurt sometimes.
it's human nature to want what you can't have,
it's human nature to make yourself feel pain.
and if you got one wish you wouldn't want it anymore, and if you got one wish, you'd only want more.
human nature
