there's a war inside my head, am I alive or fucking dead?
show me a reason to believe I can't believe in anything
my whole damn life is one big sacrifice giving gets old so fast when you get nothing back
two bleeding hand and a broken back a lust for things I'll never have.
my whole damn life is one big sacrifice giving gets old so fast when you get nothing back
was it all for nothing what a price to pay to live a life that's worth something
was it all for nothing what a price to pay to live a life that meant something
I can't believe in anything show me a sign one reason to career was it all for nothing do I have the strength
to face the day or live in a world full of enemies
