Behold!
The secret mountain spring
Its waters in vital excess
- never motionless

Lo!
The leafs that dance in the wind
In the depth and all heights aloof
- the air is in the move

Poisonous mind - standing still
Follow the flow - become thy self

Bow to the king of all kings
Bow to the queen of all queens

Touch the mountain! - elated by oceans of time
Proud and tall - it can not fall

Feel the fire!
Mother of life and death
All consuming flame - never the same
