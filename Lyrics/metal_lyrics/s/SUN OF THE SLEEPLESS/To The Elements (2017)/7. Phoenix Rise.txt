In all beauty there is shadow
Immaculate and false
In the clearest water's poison
To him who sees the fault

In all pain there is a halo
Weak and of cold light
In all sleep's a wake
A ceasing of all night

Absorbed and extinct,
Summoned from the embers glare
From the cold ash
Imposed into the air

In ruin is creation
In all rest's a strife
In dolefulness lies hope
Where in all death is life

Feed thy sanctum to the flame...

Fall temples fall
Into nothingness exiled
Cast down the ruins
Spoil all within thine eye

Burn fire burn
Burn every thing that is defiled
Burn Phoenix burn
In feral, untamed flame to die

"From ashes a fire shall be woken
A light from the shadows shall spring
Renewed shall be the blade that was broken
The crownless again shall be king"

[J.R.R. Tolkien]
