In the depths of the woods...
Infinity of trees
Dew strokes moss,
branches, leafs

A strong spirit reigns
- sacrosanct, pure
Resinous scent
elates the allure

In the realm of the bark

Emerald church
Wooden Priest
Hear the prayer silently

In the morass
vermin crawl
Where roots are deep
crowns rise tall

In the realm of the bark

Emerald church
Wooden Priest
Hear the prayer silently
