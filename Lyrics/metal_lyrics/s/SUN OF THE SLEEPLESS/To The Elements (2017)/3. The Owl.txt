Hunter of silence
Awakened...
Wary thine eye
in the dark

With sharpened senses
in quiescence glides
The Owl

Sublime Observer
of the earthly ado

Wisdom, prevision
- with unrivaled view
The Owl

Wanderer between the spheres
Its stroke of wings in silence clad
and so unnoticed it appears
as messenger of the dead

A passage
Thorugh nocturnal skies... glides...
The Owl

Wanderer between the spheres
Its stroke of wings in silence clad
and so unnoticed it appears
as messenger of the dead

Sublime, free, forever at night
The Owl
