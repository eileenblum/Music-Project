Right by the olden forest lane
there stood a crooked hut
All mossy stone and rusty chain
and weathered wood on bricks of mud

And in the winters cold as ice
there seemed to shine a light inside
And in the summer rains by night
something hid there in disguise

There lived a witch
I saw her weave my dreams

There by the olden forest lane
in wooden scent of fir and pine
Clad in a light arcane
it stood embraced by rampant wine

And in the winters cold as ice
there seemed to shine a light inside
and in the summer rains by night
something hid there in disguise

There lived a witch
I saw her weave my dreams

To play of light
in the trees
when the stars ignite
and the breeze
of the wind whispers
to me...
To this site I return

Forest ever green
Night reigns supreme
Magic of the scene
Weave my dreams

There lives a witch
I see her weave my dreams
