There is no place for any mindless actions
Go ahead, think you're eternal
Light becomes shadows
And darkness will swallow us whole

Love life
A value worthwhile
Survive

Don't waste the one thing you can't replace
Bad fate, sending you to an early grave
Don't waste the one thing you can't replace
In a mindless haze, these are dark days

How can you take your life for granted?
Only fools believe in second chances

Learn constraint
Let go of the inner child
You've only got one shot

Take back control, think it through
Your actions decide, your existence denied

Take back control, think it through
Don't make the same mistake
You never listen, I never listened too

Instead of running face first into a fucking brick wall
We've got rot
