Staring at the sky, thoughtless
The joys of life
Close friends by my side

I can, I can feel it all
The grass slipping between my toes

One single second, it all stops
This is where it ends
One single second, it all stops
Ignorance is dead
Wake up

Burn

Blazing inferno
Consuming what was and is yet to come
I stand on the edge of the abyss
With a pale skin I behold the pale horse

Here to take me away, I am a dead end, there's no saving me
But you won't let my life burn out
Help, help is on its way

I can't feel a thing
My life is in your hands
Save me from my decay

I can't feel a thing
Cover me beneath your wings
Secured in desolation
