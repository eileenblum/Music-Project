My artificial life is over now
White chains dissolve
And I, the fallen, will rise again
Survival, against all odds

The fallen will rise again

I will rebuild these bridges
That were swept away by the current
But where do I start?

What is the point of living, if you don't have hope?
This life on earth, too short to resign yourself to fate
Why keep holding on, if you're not even trying?
This time, you better not let inertia win the day

One step at a time
Small victories (small victories)
My limbs are trembling
And I just can't keep, I can't keep my legs from collapsing
Am I this fucking weak? Am I this fucking weak?

"You don't walk this path alone"
My shining beacon, you are my torch in the darkness
Don't dare to cave in now
Keep a positive mindset

Infinite

It's not that easy, it's not that easy
The road to recovery

You're not there yet, where you want to be
But neither are you where you used to be
I focus on the here and now and where I want to go
