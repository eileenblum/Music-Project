Waking up, I open my eyes
Where am I?

Images of that one day
Flashing through my mind
It all starts to make sense now
It starts to become clear

Bandages, needed comfort
Are but white-colored chains
Sleep, eat, suffer, repeat
Dependent
Paralyzed

Is this real?
Open my eyes
Too blind to see

Nightmares chasing me
Pain is taking over, please treat me
Take me along with you
Destination unknown
For now, I only have one option
Travel along, hope to hold on

It never ends, this vicious cycle
Counting down, going blank again

Bounce back

White chains remain
Patience, the key, slowly reveals the new me
