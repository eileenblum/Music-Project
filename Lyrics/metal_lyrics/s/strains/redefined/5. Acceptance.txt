Thinking back
The way I used to be
Nothing left, nothing remains
The shade of my former self
Only ashes still haunt my mind now

Nothing left, nothing remains
Forget the past, it's not the same

Now come your words of understanding
"Everything is fine" you said, "glad you're alright"
Ignorance is bliss

Fuck
Fuck you
You don't have a clue what I've been through
Your perception, a veil that deludes you
A veil of ignorance, you can't look beyond
Don't even try to comprehend what I've felt
I hope you'll never know

There is much more to me than meets the eye
Fragments I accept I've lost
Fragments I've lost for good
Through the struggle I've learned who I am today

Shed my skin, letting go was never easy
Overcome what I've become

It remains a burden I accept
Maybe the past will haunt the future
How will I cope?
Am I redefined?
