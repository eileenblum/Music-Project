I sleep. Sleep in Sanity.
Day for Day. Night for night away in my head.
God in me. Justice suffer me in my bed
Deep pain. The all killing rain in my hand.
Cross the Sigh, lost Ray of Shine in my bread.
Horror lies, Angry of Darkness days in my led.

No, I creed Creator, In God. No, I help a sleeping man.
I can't go in dwelling - place. I must help you, man.

Who - Godless, killing Christ. Death. Man of Devil.
Song of Pain, tramp and sick. Blasphemous: That's dead!

Oh, my beauty!.. I Suffer: I cry: Blessed Moment.
