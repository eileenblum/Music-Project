Sleeping in Grave. Girl is a future wife.

Silence. Tonight.
Bloody Moon light and my dying bride.
Heaven and hell. In Crying bell for you.
Sorrow and Fear. My heart full of tears.

Where is justice? God! Rescue is in word. Rescue of world.
She's dead, but life is long. You always alive. In my heart.
All that you have left. Is my memory yes. And life for two.
