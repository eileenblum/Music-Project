That one who has gone in the night, in deep distance.
Closed in the Circle and possessing knowledge
But refusing this You, living as heathen, pitiful and unhappy.
You, possessing him, will die rejecting recovery.
Spiral staircase of the cave leading downstairs.
And become acquainted with torments of oblivion.
Who is me? Brain and Pain. Angry and Rains.
Who is me? This long a Path. Dust of Stones.
Who is me? Sigh with cry awaiting mankind.
Who is me?..
