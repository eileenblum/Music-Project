My disgust commences at the end of what was truth
This doctrine of hollow promises that would cease mortality
Faith in vain rewards regret
Take to heart this crime of fraudulent documentation
To moralize mankind
The posthumous foresee an end to parasitic rule
We, though few, will wage the war to destroy this barbarism
Towering in such egoism as to reach beyond heavens
With brevity and fact as will
We will crush idols with philosophy's hammer

Contempt, our deity
Power-principled liars mute knowledge and culture
We prefer to question rather than accept
Forbidden yearning for absolute science
A god excused by nonexistence
Grants no pardon when we take reign

With just our presence, the silent masses roar
Audible with conviction's authority
A labyrinth of predestination
End of contagious suffering
No pity for those pitied
Reclaim our throne of nature
With this battle for order underway
We will leave morality defamed upon its cross

Need no christian charity, be superior in thought
Need no hope, conceptualize destiny as god
Follow now with Pilate
Reevaluate all values, strength restored through wounds
