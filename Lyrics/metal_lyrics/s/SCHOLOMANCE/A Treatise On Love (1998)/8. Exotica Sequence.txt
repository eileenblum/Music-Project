Kiss me... with your fear
I need us being
Together...
You and I have always been the unseen
Invisible to most until the bonding began
Weary, dreary, tearyface
Take me to the happy place

The christ figure beckons those who are fools
Those who will drink the sacred blood of his wounds
And wipe the dribble from their passive stinking mouths
With the soiled cloth worn by the divine falsity

In dreams we can die, In fantasies we can thrive
But here, only you and I in our nightmare
In an erotic embrace that burns Despair

The Swallowers and the Listeners are just outside
To enter our paradise of private splendor
So may they be eviscerated
We that are bonded shall be saved
Those of the light be shunned
Atop desolate plateaus of imagination
Centuries will fall, the sodomization of time
And still we will sleep on the edge of oblivion
Infliction of pleasurable delusions
Of erotica, this Exotica Sequence

Leaves dry and dead float on cooling Autumn winds
Snow gentle and silent drifts in sunless winter skies
Spring green and rebirth ignored
Summer warmth and joy unnoticed
