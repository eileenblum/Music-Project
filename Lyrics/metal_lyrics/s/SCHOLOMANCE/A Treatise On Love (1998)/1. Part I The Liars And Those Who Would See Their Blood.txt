And I found a raven's feathers beneath melting snow
And I thought of you and how you fed upon me
In the manner of the most vile carrion
With lips painted glistening scarlet.
You were the heroin in my veins...

Oh, I bleed not well and not fluidly
Yet you devour my poisoned crimson.
Deceit in elegant waves of euphoric pain
Treachery as only your kind may summon
Misery. More hatred in one short life
Than the minions of Genocide ever unleashed.
Stagnation. Fault of mine? Or yours?
Stab me. Fuck me over and over.
You are why I am this and not a lamb,
All fluffy and white, like the rest
Looking forward to their stupor.
Looking for their leaders
Yet unwilling to seek their origins.
I have sought after what is mine.
(Hen Ddihenvdd.)
Wasted time or essential to my lie?
Overtaken with plague, exposed to disaster,
Stellar blackness may await...
