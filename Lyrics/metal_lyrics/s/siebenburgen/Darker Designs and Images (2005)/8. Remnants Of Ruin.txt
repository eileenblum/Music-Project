Golden eyes my precious child
Amber burns my soul
Stained by the glorious night
Our shadows bloom

As the moon caress us
Nothingness returns once again
And as the last tranquility abandons us
Our formation is ravaged and dead

Blessed by our fears and sinful dreams
We haunt the realm of night
Together we stand eternally
As darkness hails our destiny

Tears fill from my eyes
I dream once more again
Remnants of ruin
This blessing is all mine

Blistering cold, ravaging night
We walk the trails of lust and fear
No more tears, my precious child
Thy amber fire burns my soul

As the world burns, we burn together
With our precious sins and delusions
And the fallen ones laugh together with
The crimson serpents of our faith

Whispering voices, little obscene speeches
From deceiving slithering tongues
Our last temptation made us blind
And life where endlessly ruined...
