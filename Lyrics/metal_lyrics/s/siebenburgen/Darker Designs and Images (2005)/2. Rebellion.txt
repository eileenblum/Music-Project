Shadows stalk wiht black wind storms
Through malicious soils of wastelands shores
Rain and thunder, lightning cracks the sky
Pest forged and plagued foes
True breed born, with steel in hand
Shields of silver flashing in the night

Raven black, bringers of death
Legions dark, on cloven hoofs
Proud riding warriors of scorn
No mercy shown, destruction roars
Bones to ashes, ashes to dust
Cleansing metal from infidels hands

Battles fought and battles won
Together standing strong
No pain is greater than loss, forbidden
Crushing their way into enemy lines

Rebellion
Battle lord of black scorn
Blood born, demon spawn
Rebellion
A malicious storm, shapeless form
Bringer of chaos and hate

Earth burns, time turns
All haill the battle lord
Earth burn, time turns
All hail the battle lord

Shadows stalk with black wind storms
Through malicious soils of wastelands shores
Rain and thunder, lightning cracks the sky
Pest forged and plagued foes
True breed born, with steel in hand
Shields of silver flashing in the night

Battles fought and battles won
Together standing strong
No pain is greater than loss, forbidden
Crushing their way into enemy lines

Rebellion
Battle lord of black scorn
Blood born, demon spawn
Rebellion
A malicious storm, shapeless form
Bringer of chaos and hate
