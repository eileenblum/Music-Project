It came in moonlight, dressed in glooming night
Shadow worn, soul thorn, praised in it's fall

Annihilation, intoxication
Fevering festering flames
Spawned by my own death
A dream of dreaming
Mightier than the sky

Abomination, abortation
Feast of ghouls in the dark
Fallen angel, slithering
A new day will arise

Told as shadows conquer worlds
Blackened dawn of dusk
A chalice raised, now filled with blood
Moonlit gold in hand
Preach the hymns of living dead
Praise the serpent of the horned
Cast thy shadow, down beneath
Scorned, as legion rise

Cast away, daeth will heal
Surrounded by angels in fear
Annihilation, abomination
Blood runs cold in me

Filled with hate, intoxicate
Black mirrors in my eyes
Sworn to me, me to the scorned
An angel long since dead

Sands of time, glory be mine
I praise the serpents of my fate to be
Dreams of madness they reveal
Signs of immortality
Black throns shreds deep insanity
My shadow extends into supremacy

Abomination, abortation
Feast of ghouls in the dark
Fallen angel, slithering
A new day will arise
