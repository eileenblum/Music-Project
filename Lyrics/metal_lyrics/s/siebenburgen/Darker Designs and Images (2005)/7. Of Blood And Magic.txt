A gathering of shadows
From dimensions old
Arising from the seven worlds
And eclipse the midnight sun
King Nozierra bound in blood
Enchanted invocation animates from flames
Great beast of dark Aschteia
Incantation burnt by stars

Stillbron son of demon blood
A pact of prophecies
A shadow king, lord of souls
Rider of the abyss

Seven stones, seven thrones
A king of might and war unleashed
Great Nozterrra, spawned by death
Seven stones, seven thrones
Demon majesty of fear released
Now crowned, by blood and magic

Passage seven, stands exposed
A manifestation
Blood of christ and fallen angls
Demons breed with virtuous spirits
Bleeding gifts they sworn
Nozterra, take this offering
