Fallen angels sing to me
Of a darkened world with a dying sun
Awaiting fate inside the dream
Black mirrors gazing down on me
As the world burns through the night
I feel my shadow grow

Embraced by wings of moonlit silver
A journey through the magic of a dream
Shadows born within my soul
A nights eternity
Such beauty blind
