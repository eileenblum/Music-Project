[Music: M. Ehlin, L. Ekstr?m, Lyric: M. Ehlin]

Under a nightly sky
In ecstasy of the newly born
Creatures of a time forgotten
And a place forlorn

Hear their cries
Look deep into their eyes
Watch them fly into the night
Try to reveal
What they have concealed
And they will let you burn

"....Glory to the Kings of night
Hail the Ones of ever blight
Fear Them as you fear the dark
Majesties Infernal ...."

Under a darken sky
With the moon shining bright
They hail the ancient ones
On this devilish night

With fires burning
They are yearning
For spells and sacrifice
To conquer the night
No daylight in sight
And the bounds will be broken
