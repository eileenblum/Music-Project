[Music: M. Ehlin, L. Ekstr?m, Lyric: M. Ehlin]

Thy wicked beauty haunts me
When dreams of thee I dream
Revealing truths of midnight
And all that lies within

The nightly temptest is thee
From the shadowy dusk
With ember eyes of fire
And a heart of sin

"....Dream with me as I dreamt of thee
During ancient times and those to come
Feel the pleasures of thee in my dreams
As of thee, as of sin...."

Thy whispers in the forest dark
Stalks me through the night
Of passion and of dreaming
Thy answer waits for me

Meetings under moons so full
Their light is thy seal
Combined with sinners glory
I am waiting just for thee

Mistress of one thousand years
Which I all have dreamt
Thy vision is now crystal clear
And my soul is bound

I wait for thee, when thee call
And call thee will, I know
When dawn is following the dusk
We sleep beneath the frozen ground
