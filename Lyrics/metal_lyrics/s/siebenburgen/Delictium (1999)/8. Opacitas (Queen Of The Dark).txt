[Music: M. Ehlin, L. Ekstr?m, Lyric: M. Ehlin]

From the wine, Opacitas enthroned
Through the light of flickering birth
Brought upon madness and stillborn breeds
Embraced by the shadows she eternally invokes

Mistress of malicious ways
Demon, Queen of the dark
Unhallowed be thy name, Opacitas

"....And angels fell from grace that night
Surrounded by darkness and dreadful fright
Rising as icons midst church and tomb
While Opacitas dried them in her womb...."

Chalices filled with blood divine
Black candles and essence burn
Luring the realm into temptation
As the heavens trembled with fear

From the wine, Opacitas enthroned
Through the candles of flickering light
Embraced by the shadows she invokes
Brought upon madness, as stillborn gave birth
