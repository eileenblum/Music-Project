[Music: M. Ehlin, L. Ekstr?m, Lyric: M. Ehlin]

Silent darkness invokes the palette
Forcing the night into our hearts
Facing candles in mirrors of dark
As shadows embraces the arts

Opened wide stand gates to nightmares
Lurking each painting with gloomy light
Precious gifts of nightly treasures
Forever preserved by this dismayed sight

Gather the allies among dreaming and living
Summon the fiends of grave and death
Souls of darkness, dwellers of nightfall
Searching, grasping for timeless breath
Dead is now the art of dreaming
Dreaming is now the art of death
Find thy soul in ever grieving
Conjured by demons of twilight birth

"....Thy flesh shades of scarlet sights
As thou suffers the age of dawn
Thy pale skin upholds the marks
Of a dream of scarlet nights...."

The archfiends of fearless hunting
Destroyer of daughters and sons
Creatures within the illusion
Dwellers of a crimson dream
