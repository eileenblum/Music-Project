Through the storm of the fallen star
Smoke settled ruind webbed
Clouds the sun, bound by death
This sulphur feast
Flaming beasts sets skies ablaze

Illuminated by (their) skeletal core
Wings turns black, as thunder roars
Forgotten are the sins of man...
...Forgotten are the sins of man...

By true hordes of demons breed
Torture souls of brimstone seed
Sculptures in rapture, brings their end
Dead lies the fields of Schaar
Abomination spirits
Kindred of the damned
Armies of the dead approaches
As the sun turns black

All hail the king, spreading her wings
Lord of great shadow rules ravished earth
Beneath the structures of a new world order
Arising from his throne of death

Thunder crushes all in sight
Echoes of hellfire might
Fierce power to unlock the chosen
Thirteenth of Nebula keep

Rulers long forgotten
Bound by dreamers of the flaming seas
Thirteenth of Nebula keep
Dark demons of the bleeding storm
Still havocking throughout dark dimensions
Of glorified past
Forever as the scorned approaches
Riding out in mist of plague
Thirteenth of Nebula keep
Dominating soulless hearts, in rapture burning
War shrouded with endless hate

The earth will tremble
So violently that trees will be uprooted
And mountains will fall, and every chain and shackle
Will snap and sever freeing the God of Mischief
And his ferocious son
