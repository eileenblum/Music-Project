Behold last glimpse of day
Frozen stars, blinding decay
Beneath departed starry skies
Blood changed, shallow sinners cry

Follow through the elders rage
From the sphere, dark crystal burns
Broken may the dreamer be
Sleeping souls, as eyeless see

From the spell of invocation
Man disrupted. Soulless bleeds
Choirs of the dead awakened
Like a burning star

Son of morning never glow
True heartness blackness ascend
From horizons old distorted
Arise midst death and pain

Damnation close to demons heart
Dragons fire, storms disease
Alit the grounds of the sacred hordes

As dawn of shadows advance
Poisoning the stone of Archer
Bitter wine from the spoiled earth
A feast of war that madness binds

Behold the last glimpse of the day
Frozen stars death and decay

Beneath departed hollow skies
Angels of the sun will die

Follow through the elders rage
From the sphere, where poison burns
Broken may the sinner be
Sleeping souls, as faceless screams
