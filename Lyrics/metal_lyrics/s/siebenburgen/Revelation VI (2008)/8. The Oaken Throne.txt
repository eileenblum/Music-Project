Winds of darkness, storming seas
Blood filled shores, horizon in flames
Ancient wisdom, warriors proud
Dimension of hatred, open the gates...

Beneath a burning heaven
Black banners in the wind
Hollow eyes staring, resting on ruins
An eternity lost, now risen once again
A new order, a new king, ruler of a dead land

Howling wolfs, crawl to war
Bloddied steel, towards black sky
Moonlight reflecting, shields and swords
Honor and pride, glory or death
...glory or death

On the throne of the underworld
A king of great shadows crowned
Before all, ever fall
Demon of soulless breed
