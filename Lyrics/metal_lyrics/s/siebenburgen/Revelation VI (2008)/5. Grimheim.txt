Fire death glory hate
Fiends of the reaping sky
Soulles of the nebular
Frozen in time

Through the gates of Grimheim proud
Warriors march, side by side
Armies of Grimheim, towards war
Through the gates of Grimheim proud
Warriors ride, side by side
Shrouded metal, battle forged
Sons of true fear arise

Chaos, cleansing light
Fierce thunder roar
War power, destruction mass
Hell supreme, unleashed

Glory honor pride death
Soulless of the nebular
Rise through the mist of dying
Frozen in time

Above all, supremacy
Order of the seven worlds

Internal necropolis, sacrificed, forgotten
Three times four, new darkness
Awaken storms of fire
Once lost, feared united
Found in Metlech horizon

Crowned King dethroned by Elders might
Eternal nemesis of a scorned land
