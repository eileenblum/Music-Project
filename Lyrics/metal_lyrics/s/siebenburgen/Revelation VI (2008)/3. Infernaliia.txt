Etheons departed, fallen from grace
Black winged and chained to stone
Bound by flaming magic
Dreaming demon undead
Like a solstice dragon, conquering the day

Infernaliia
Blesses angels undivine
Infernaliia
Condemned to rise again

Etheons crowned, fallen from grace
Abusing the wisdom of the underdark
Unleashed by flaming magic
Undead demon call
Chaos blinds the banned
Weakened sinners weep

Shadows expanding
Slithering darkness arise
Conjuring masters praying
Calling blackened sky
Shadows expanding
Slithering darkness side by side
Nocturnal masters calling
Preparation of the ghost

Vultured beasts, forced in anger
Wrath of Caouldran, fires high
