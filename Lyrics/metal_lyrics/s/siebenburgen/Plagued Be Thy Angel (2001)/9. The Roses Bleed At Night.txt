Stars brightly shrouded,
in dark silver light
Abandoned by the tyrants,
that rests in vicious death
This precious womb,
with glimpsing lips, enthrones
As shadows cast their splendid dreams,
and arose

With perfect beauty,
death rises with grace
Unveiling her tomb,
seductive and cold
Painted in colors
of the painful night
Sacrificed,
and eternally forgotten

In search for thee,
I placed my soul, in gratitude
Gazing into the mirror black,
when all life faded away

Sacred ones, no longer stalking.
though the dark night allured
The ritual sins, blessed to be,
an everlasting Eden

"As blood red roses
withered on thy grave
And flesh beheaded thy pain
Thou glowed
with immortal anger warm
And the hatred of the undead..."

Possessing the glory, that lies below
Her own cunting garden of delight
Tears whipped white from eternity
Scarlet serenades, mourns and grieves

Stars brightly shrouded,
in dark silver light
Abandoned by the tyrants,
that rests in vicious death

This precious womb,
with glimpsing lips, enthrones
As shadows cast their splendid dreams,
and arose

With perfect beauty, death rises with grace
Unveiling her tomb, seductive and cold
Painted in colors of the painful night
Sacrificed, and eternally forgotten

"As blood red roses
withered on thy grave
And flesh beheaded thy pain
Thou glowed with immortal anger warm
And the hatred of the undead..."
