Shadows, forthcoming darkness
Take me as I am...
Dead but believing, never deceiving
The perpetual wounds of faith

Surrounded by falling angels
That departed heavenly grace
Destination supremacy
Dreaming as we burn...

"I watch with eyes repellent, down on purest ones
Descending from my haunted keep, gazing in disgust
Darkness guides me, I am eternal, advancing towards death
Filled with wrath, opposing shallow light...I am the night..."

Shadows, my true fiends
I am now as thee
Solid and perpetual
Ageless I will be...

Surrounded by falling angels
That departed heavenly grace
Destination supremacy
Dreaming as we burn...

"I watch with eyes repellent, down on purest ones
Descending from my haunted keep, gazing in disgust
Darkness guides me, I am eternal, advancing towards death
Filled with wrath, opposing shallow light...I am the night..."
