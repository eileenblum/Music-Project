Her creation was mine,
obliterated form her embracing dreams
Poisoned, intoxicated she gained
the pleasures of night
I stole her sanity,
my blood was hers to keep
An anthem for the shadows to dwell...

Black stars enshrouded her,
she opened her eyes
And saw the dawn of time...
Experiencing the wicked ways of the lie...
I buried her deep down inside...

"...From her mourning cape,
black feathers turned to dust
Adored by shadows,
grand whore of the night
Born in sin, spawned from my lust
An angel hidden from her light..."

Shadowqueen, come closer,
dwell with me in sin
Reveal thy inner sanctum,
possess me, dominate...

As tranquility sought madness,
spellbound from within
She met her damnation,
my deadly kiss, her fate...
I devastated her mortal grave,
cleansed and purified

I led her into temptation,
and through the darkness of all her fears
Dying and abused, she was used,
as the template of my hunger
Deceived by her own moralization
of her crimes...
...she fed my world complete

Her creation was mine,
obliterated form her embracing dreams
Poisoned, intoxicated she gained
the pleasures of night
I stole her sanity,
my blood was hers to keep
An anthem for the shadows to dwell...

Black stars enshrouded her,
she opened her eyes
And saw the dawn of time...
Experiencing the wicked ways of the lie...
I buried her deep down inside...

"...From her mourning cape,
black feathers turned to dust
Adored by shadows,
grand whore of the night
Born in sin, spawned from my lust
An angel hidden from her light..."
