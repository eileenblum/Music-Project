Silently fading into the unknown
Waiting for darkness to take my soul home
This life gave me nothing but a name for my grave
A long wish to die, and escape from the pain
The righteous may bless the old and the young
But I was not blessed by anyone
And now when it's over, it wont take long
Until I descend, until I am gone...

THY KINGDOM COME

BLESSED BE THE POOR
BE THE SICK
BE THE MEEK
AND BLESSED ART THEE
BLESSED BE THE OLD
BE THE WEEK
BE THE YOUNG
