Wings of angels, shaded the sky
And stained the sunset with ebony stars
Sorrow met madness, and daggers consumed
Ashes of beauty, forlorn and defiled

Behowling the purity of death
The vicious temptress divine

"...Forever have I searched for thee, my nocturnal bride
Through centuries I have waited, but now thou art mine
I know that nothing is forever, and that dawn will do us apart
I shed no tears or sorrow, I have kept thy midnight heart..."

Passion and paleness, oaths of past
Pleasures of urging pain and fear

Shrouded darkness, the wicked enthrones
The priestess of timeless lust arose
Laid to rest, but slumbers not
Deceived by her fearless dreams

I buried thee
My mistress nocturne
I drank thy bitter wine,
And tasted thy world bizarre
Thee brought me madness,
That I am sure
But sands of time came closer,
Farewell my bride, farewell...

"...Forever have I searched for thee, my nocturnal bride
Through centuries I have waited, but now thou art mine
I know that nothing is forever, and that dawn will do us apart
I shed no tears or sorrow, I have kept thy midnight heart..."

Pale as moonlight are the lilies on thy grave,
Never fading, just like thee...
Thou art with me, we share the same dream,
Thy blackened treasure, now belongs to me...

"...Forever have I searched for thee, my nocturnal bride
Through centuries I have waited, but now thou art mine
(Even though) I know that nothing is forever, and that dawn will do us apart
I shed no tears or sorrow, I have kept thy midnight heart..."
