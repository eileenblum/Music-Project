Her shadows mourn in moonlight
Dark traces for the soul to feed
Each wound that transforms her
Is mine to conquer and bewitch
As storms breathes inside of her
Winds of faith heals and grieves
This temptress that haunts my desire
Turned death endlessly against me

I draw the circled pentagram extreme
Wishing that death would reanimate
That flesh becomes the truth
Amongst the stars above her bones
Shattered, abused by the night
Torched alit by graveyard mists
That died together with her sins
Shaping her frigid flesh dead and dried...

By spells of sacred daughters
That departed their misdeeds
I crave my nightly courtesan
To violate my sense again
And as the final sunset
As the moon, the stars, the sky...
I placed my soul in gratitude
To darkness, to the gates of pain...

"Behold its glory, the night alit,
Our shadows painted, in the light of the moon
Our dark secrets, unknown to mankind
As I, the breeder, devoured thy mortal soul..."

Wings aroused, as moonlit flesh emerged
From wastelands deep down the ground
As icons in stone bowed for the animated dead
I forced thy entry to the final world

"Behold its glory, the night alit,
Our shadows painted, in the light of the moon
Our dark secrets, unknown to mankind
As I, the breeder, devoured thy mortal soul..."

My slumbering beauty, possessing nightly grandeur
Endless, and forever, I am thine, eternally
I was spellbound from eyes of sapphire jewelry
And the sins from the depths of thy soul

Enchanted by thy darkness
My Queen of lust and urge
I watched thy shadow, mourning in the dark
So cold and dead, so dead and dried
Seductress of my dreams, I wither with thee
My flesh, my true nocturnal blood...

"Behold its glory, the night alit,
Our shadows painted, in the light of the moon
Our dark secrets, unknown to mankind
As I, the breeder, devoured thy mortal soul...
