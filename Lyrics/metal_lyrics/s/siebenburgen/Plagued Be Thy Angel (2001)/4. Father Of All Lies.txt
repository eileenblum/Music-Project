Welcome to my world below
I grant thee pleasures unknown
Bestow thy sins, forfeit thy soul
Praise me as thou fall...
Cast thy self before me
Pray on bended knee
Be my shadow, serve my ways
As given unto thee...

Seven sins
Seven ways to heed...
...Seven sins
Seven ways to heed my destiny...

"Behold my visions, remember my past
I am the lord of the flies
In feeble rapture, weak adore
Twelve bastards and a whore
So choose your path, left or right
I am the father of all lies"

As above, so below
Another kingdom, another grace
I bid thee welcome, to the inverted
United in flames
Don't fear the reaper, thy only foe
And thy key to me...
In death thou will find
The powers of darkness entwined...

"Behold my visions, remember my past
I am the lord of the flies
In feeble rapture, weak adore
Twelve bastards and a whore
So choose your path, left or right
I am the father of all lies"

Welcome to my world below
I grant thee sights unseen
Bestow thy sins, forfeit thy soul
Praise me in thy fall...
Cast thy self before me
Pray on bended knee
Be my shadow, serve my ways
As given unto thee...

Seven sins
Seven ways to heed...
...Seven sins
Seven ways to heed my destiny...

"Behold my visions, remember my past
I am the lord of the flies
In feeble rapture, weak adore
Twelve bastards and a whore
So choose your path, left or right
I am the father of all lies"
