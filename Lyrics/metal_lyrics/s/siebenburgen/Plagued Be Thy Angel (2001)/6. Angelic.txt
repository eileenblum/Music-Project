Embraced by the nightmares thou forced me to dwell
Caressed by thy horrors which I into fell
My darkest angel, my temptress of night
Glorificator, of lust and delight

I am lost in thy dark desires
Thy serpentic Eden of flesh
Through splendid creations which thou me into lured
I faced the dreams, drunken from thy wine

"As moonlit silver whispered through mysteries eyes
And ravens seeded sorrowpaths in faded thine
Thou hungered for lust and passion dark
When sin stroke thy hands into bloodied mine"

Call out and I will follow
The dark paths that thou cast before me
I will treasure them as night treasures shadows
And flee the light above

Sorrows that we burnt together
Memories that faded away
The tears that we dreamt forever
Will eternally greet us our death

As night spreads its wings in silence
And all that remain is pure
We gather our screaming horrors
In awe to our precious sins
