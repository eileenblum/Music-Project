The night falls.
I am alive

when you dream of glass, I shatter

every single piece belongs to me

in your nightmares im back together

this is reality.

my teeth will sink
in every inch of your body
my teeth will sink
in every inch of you and you will fall

when you dream of glass, I shatter

every single piece belongs to me

in your nightmares im back together

this is reality.
