this is justice. these are our final days.the liability of what
remains. something in my way. something holding back. just us free.
just set us fucking free. before I let go of all thats left of
me.memories never leave my mind.all this uncertainty, leaves my eyes
open wide.you hide behind the fucking shadows. your promises of better
days.but we will never let this. become our history.step up. step up
for yourselffor all of this.as our lives become awake. ill be sleeping
just incase.to remind me of a day. where the ocean can wash me away.in
this moment of clarity.where the ocean meets the city.our lives could
end todaythats why im living every memorywe can put a stop to this we
do it once and for all, we will never be the victims as the cities
start to fall.all these relics there a trap, when you die you're never
coming back. why would you ever want to live in a false perfection.all
of these memories never leave my mind.all of this clarity my eyes open
wide.
