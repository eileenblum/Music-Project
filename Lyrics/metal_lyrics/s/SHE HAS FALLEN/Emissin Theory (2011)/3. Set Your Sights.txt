your mind has been altered
but the image still clear
together we falter
let us swallow your fear

ive been searchin for the answers
for far too long
drop the signals cause were coming
home

set your sights
its all weve got
direct your thoughts

step back
and watch the sky turn
black

step back for the sky

grab my arms. DONT LET GO!

ive been searchin for the answers
for far too long
drop the signals cause were coming
home

set your sights
its all weve got
direct your thoughts

THE FLOOD WILL SWALLOW US ALL!
