lets forget.
everything that we've been through.
and watching you change.
and all this regret.

its the last time
we say farewell

goodbye

and the lies you say
who were you trying to distract?
dont be afraid
because the knives in my back

try to let go
lets go our seperate ways
but before I let you
just listen to me

you will listen to me

I drew the border but you betrayed me

I drew the border but youll never forget my fucking face

you will never forget me

and the lies you say
who were you trying to distract?
dont be afraid
because the knives in my back

try to let go
lets go our seperate ways
but before I let you
just listen to me

war is endless.
