Look to the moon,
save your last breathe
deep in your eyes are seconds that we
have left

and now shes gone

and I knew it all along

ill travel all the oceans just for a sign
ill pick up all the pieces you left
you left me here to die

we are bound together

with out lives

6 feet under

we are bound together

we are bound together now

every step that i take without you
leaves me open again
every step that i take without you
leaves me open again and again

no more regrets

your all that i have
your all that i ever wanted

i want to age with the winds
buried in an hour glass
i want to just let time take my life
take my LIFE!
