Reflecting a cold shine of despair
A pale vision of desolation
Reflecting the hatred
A lifeless piece of hatred

Through my mournful eyes
A reflection of a light faded away
Inhumanity is left alone

I remember cold
I remember a distant night
So far away, lost

I remember a life so grim
I remember grief
Alone in a dissonant void
Leaving a cold forgotten earth
