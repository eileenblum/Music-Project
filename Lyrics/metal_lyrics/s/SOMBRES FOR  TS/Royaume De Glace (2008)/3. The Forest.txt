The forest where I sleep
Is a shield against humanity
I left behind my mortal stone
Away from fear and misery

Is a great timeless womb
Where art itself adorns the sky

Beyond the veil of time
Sleeps in eternity
The forest in quintessence

Beneath a myriad of stars
I drowned the deepest of nights
Leaving behind this desolate wood

I remain a monument of cold whispers
But I keep so deep inside a nest
Where a forest enlights with pureness
Shining like burning embers...
