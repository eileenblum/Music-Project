Every start refers to an end
What you look feel and breathe will soon too die
The light is finished to the rhythm of time expiring in space
The introduction to the new dynamics is processed
The old time ends to begin the new registry of existential memory
The last breath of the universe will give way to new forms

This is the process of destiny
Beginning cycle is created like a drop in the ocean
The colossal ruins died and the pain also came to an end forever.
The beginning and the end will be forever infinite
