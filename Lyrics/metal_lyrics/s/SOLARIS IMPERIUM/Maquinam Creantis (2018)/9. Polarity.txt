Death is nothing more than an invention that the mind created to not abandon the inner melancholy and the big void
I am everything and nothing I come from fantasy and reality
Always standing in the same place up or down we talk about the same
Here there will always be a back for an obverse
Dimensional gears rotate in wrong way
The past and future merge with the time
Cause and effect are balance
We are constantly on the mental pendulum from side by side
Obeying the stellar motion of the stars to above and below
I'm polarity
Polarity
Polarity
