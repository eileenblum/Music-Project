Under the deep seas of amnesia, silence always wears white,
Mystery in a state of continuous recycling
Even the hope is present

Existential information was suppressed
The perception of just being with eyes wide open turns us into cattle

I do not remember the departure, now we flee from the future without knowledge, programming prevents us from being autonomous

They come to dissent
We are poisoned with lies
Happiness is bought by material state

Deposited in weak bodies
We are so easy to manipulate
Deposited in weak bodies
We are so easy to manipulate

The sense of the days is cold
One star dies to give me life
When the deceit is behind the innocence

What is the unknown origin and how much time we have here, I still wonder if we could ever choose to live and break the cycle
What is the unknown origin and how much time we have here I wanna break the cycle

Thousand fictions exists to entertain the mind and not find the exit
Prisoners in meat bodies and acting as machines in production
