You were easily misled by brain imaging
Lies flow in consequence to decisions
Synthetic structures call into question the state of mind
Reality can hide behind the waves of light.

I'm distorted in a holographic design cage
Betrayal and deception are everywhere
Life here is a lie, hypnotization by digital shapes

Programming for denial is absolute
They make us see and feel the pleasure
Induced deeply in each individual consciousness
We lost the will in synthetic creation
We are creatures caught in dynamic of lies, dynamic lies
Mental subliminal shots of holographic confusion
