Now that you are entering the solemn sound of ruin
You discover the roar of the earth's disease
When the center of life revolves around death
This you breathe today is the cause of extinction of tomorrow
They have come to colonize, our habitat
By means of military technology and pathological

Infiltration of the toxin in the brain stops the evolution

The view dissolve in a valley of rubble
While civilizations breathe the darkest dawns
New diseases increase the radius of biological devastation

Thought has aimed at common standards of obedience, slaves walking in reverse.
Many were killed, others were captured for biological experiments only a few survive
This is the war of the fourth insurgency
