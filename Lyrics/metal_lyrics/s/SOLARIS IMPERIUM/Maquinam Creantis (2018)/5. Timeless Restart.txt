We always breathe the time of existential scheme where every second gets more lethal in a process of slow disintegration.
Get ready for the start.
All that was, is and will be
It's a perception of a game that won't win
I'm in a virtual universe
It's the first kingdom of the four sectors

Making time to the rhythm of his thought
In the incommensurable realities
Restoring the existence becomes timeless, omnipresent and unfading

They will have the last word in deciding between life and death
In a monochrome cosmos while the planetary nebula radiates
All that was, is and will be
It's a perception of a game that won't win
Nucleosynthesis rises fast
The fading process began to eat us

Creative minds of sublime forms, put the fate in motion
Being part of our time involved us in a state of timeless restart
We are an illusion of the eternal dream

They create suns on their way to illuminate the space
Light years away the ashes are mixed with the shadows

This is the end and the beginning timeless
