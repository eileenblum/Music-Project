And now my change is here
You can see
I'm one more in the process of the current trend
It's my new life
Errors and physical imperfections are changed by synthetic material

Psychological damage is eradicated
Gray matter is restored.
Intelligence grows simultaneously
Common defects are exterminated
I'm ready for the new life module to follow
Ones self is eternity

Damaged cells will undergo cryopreservation until further notice
So far the update of the body is stable with the machine
This is the end of suffering
A new skin restores me
Welcome the new day
Welcome the new sun
A new light surrounds me
