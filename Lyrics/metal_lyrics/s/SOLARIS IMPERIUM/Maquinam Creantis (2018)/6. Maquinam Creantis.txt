I am the creator of the good and the bad, the positive and the negative
I have with me the power of your creation and your destiny
Once the database is ready for processing itâs installed in your head
And start the game in the simulation; only the best will leave here.

In the game many kill, hate pollute and devastate
Others smile and become a succulent prey to others
Thinking of the opposite of the usual is almost impossible
Draw a line on your future without logical reason

The positive and the negative
Your destiny
Impossible
Devastate

You get used to swallow the poison of others
Fall to the disease called humanity
You will meet again and again with the cycle
Neural patterns recharge

Your eyes are covering with brilliance, glowing like fireflies
After the carrion shadows will end the glow
Do not ask me the why of things
This time there is no mercy for anyone.
This is the big machine
