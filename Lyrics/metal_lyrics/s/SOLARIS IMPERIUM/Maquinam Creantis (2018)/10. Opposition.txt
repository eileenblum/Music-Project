The enemy is hidden under the curtain, directing the show of manipulation the lie is his weapon, the illusion his trap, the moment arrives, the pyramid will fall, the oppressed will rise, will fall, the pyramid will fall.

The debugging has begun, his head and his blood will flow, a new era, upon the corpse of the fallen oppressor will begin

The jaws of the lion have opened, to tear and annihilate his captor, confrontation is imminent, facts are already written, opens the way to the opposition, receives the punishment of the oppressed, opens the way to the opposition, the old order has been drowned in his own poison

The jaws of the lion have opened
Opens the way to the opposition
This is our oppositionâ¦
