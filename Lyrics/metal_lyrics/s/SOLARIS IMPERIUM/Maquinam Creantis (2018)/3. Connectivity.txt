Complex configuration of gamete circuit
Let me see the creation of the perfect race, magnificent illusion
We cross the perfect line between human and machine
It's not an experiment, the hybrid creation born.

We are connected through meat and circuit
We are from a place of hatred and ashes
We are programmed to release the coma
We are a race created to lift those ruins

The connection chemical and digital was made successfully, now the new genetic code will guide to the new hybrid race.
Loading expansion specie.
Now our thoughts are generated by the body of coalescent material new life has begun
