No lie is more endemic to this era
Nor more diseased
Than the lie of progression

No lie is more self-aggrandising
Entrenched, hostile to truth
Than the lie of progression

Do we not decay? 
Do we not perish?
Unlike those wise with years
Our years have brought madness

That by the fact of our own era we must be right
More so than those, our fathers, it's held that we advance
With every generation, ennobling ourselves
In chronocentric and blind narcissistic hell

This world is fated
Approaching its nadir
Walking the path away
From any higher order

The utterances of slaves, flouting eternal laws
Suckling at the black teat of Kali with dripping maws
Yet victory goes to those who know how to obey
In total scorn defying the lie of progression
