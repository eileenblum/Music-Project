To feed the ages which sup on rise and fall
To make a blood offering to decay itself
Did cast off Mars attendant, sanctioned white robes
Besieged by the poisons of pure senescence

Dry, without libations shall lie imperial soil
Lest it be the sweet wine of its own demise
Thirsting for oblations of blood upon its altars
Lest it be the forsaken blood of its own youth

Fallow thy temples of stone
Thrown open to beasts 
Observing cold centuries
Where no works are spared  

When the gates of Mars were closed and hands chained
In the lap of a corruption more fell than arms 
To slake the ages did that empire fall
For the past is pregnant with a future ready seen
