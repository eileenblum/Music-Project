Now father has set in flesh
Great bequeather and sufficient cause
What before was not, king of all effects
Ruler of all creation 

Strife - all gods and men reveal
Of substance thou art father
War - here dictate by thy hands
Bear the names of all births and deaths 

Strife - the nature of all agents 
Speaks in life's anthesis
Shall he remain man, or become a god 
In the conflict of all?
Name the enslavers and saviours
By one the other strife designates
The bow would be left unstrung
And the cosmos dead but for war

To all things that find existence in conception
Strife is the father of all in nature
To all things acknowledge your monarch and king
Polemos pater panton 

"Would that Conflict vanish from among both men and gods"
The declaration leapt from Achilles' tongue 
Would thou pray for the destruction of all moving objects?
For even man and god are both born of war

Source of the light and the dark
Both share a stem in strife
False - the error that they are two
The harmony of opposing force

To all things that swim in the current of creation
War the baptizer and regulator 
To all things render your fealty in return
Polemos pater panton
