Worker of divine will and mandate of heaven
Kshatriya thou master of the chaos that thou art
Enduring the spear without agony
As the knightly horse who rarely feels the master's whip 

Attending to the only order timeless and unauthored
The sentry of his arms, who sees without sight
Servant of the hammer of eternity's execration
With the blood-stained hands of a healer and a king - and a king

Attendees to madness, they who light the great black fire 
Wherein one day nigh they will be cast
While the kshatriya lights the Self-ignited flame 
To burn alive their hollow, craven hope of peace

Those ripe to bring ruin to the world of profane creation
Around whom such is an immortal silence born
A greater silence when the dawn of fire comes
Mere instruments of a boundless will divine
Thus spoke the sun: "Tasmat tvam uttishta!"

The heavy burden of the earth, thou justly cast to desolation
Kshatriya thou master of the ascesis of power 
Standing upon mountains, as the sorrowful look on in mourning
By a will transhuman, raise a prayer to total war
