In the mythoi of all worlds, in all eras
In the ancient rhymes of verse, ageless and hallowed
Are the pure whispers singing of the end

The heart of all the races past, who left us their words
Beat in full knowledge that it will have an end 
As it had its primal source, both which the same
A sacred bridge whose name is carnage and decay

Bearing alone the footsteps of the gods
Far from the rising tide of death
Which follows dissent divine

The final throes of entropy are sworn
Bitter sleep of the sovereign sun 
Whose child from abyssal womb
Will bless the seed of gold

When echoes divine dissent, perceived below
The race of earth will answer in antiphonal cries
To take up arms with gods, a future bestowed
Or perish in the earthly dust's unbidden demise
