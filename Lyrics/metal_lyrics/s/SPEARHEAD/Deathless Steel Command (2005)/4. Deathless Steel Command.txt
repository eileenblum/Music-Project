Black steel stained by pillars of blood
The Iron drinks the ignoble blood
No Holiness nor righteousness
Acrid infirmity and lies
Apocalypse of mass defiance
Revelations of perishing Heaven
Surrendered hope and dignity
Pillage and Plunder

Merciless efficiency
Fields of corpses putrefy
Mankind's misconception
Miserable Slaughter and Bloodshed

Merciless efficiency
Fields of corpses putrefy
Mankind's misconception
Miserable Slaughter and Bloodshed
The black ordure of vermin veins
Slithers down the blood-groove

Troops of the holy war
Bastion of steel
Who followed the holy star
Who will turn milk and honey into blood

Troops of the holy war
Bastion of steel
Who followed the holy star
Who will turn milk and honey into blood
