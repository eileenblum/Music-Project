Ablaze was the age of fire
Clamouring, the claws of leaping flame
Victory was sung by plague and cannon
That vomited forth the cleansing fire

The destruction was imminent
Warriors bled the freezing horizon
Baying for blood and vengeance
Summoned by the last call for the final war
Stern and Proud in Valour
Ravening in the fields of arms' debate

Stripped from triumph
The serpent's brood of ill-bred sheep
With mighty disciples of honour
All plunged into merciless slaughter
True sacrifice in bitter combat
The undefeated destiny overmasters

Stripped from triumph
The serpent's brood of ill-bred sheep
With mighty disciples of honour
All plunged into merciless slaughter
The era of silence commanded
And the gallows were filled with swaying peace

Stern and Proud in Valour
Ravening in the fields of arms' debate
The blood soaked soil yields no grief
Warriors bled the freezing horizon
Baying for blood
And vengeance
