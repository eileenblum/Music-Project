Decaying, the weak cannot feign strength
Disfigured faces stare at the truth
Taste the blade of timeworn vengeance
Against your womb, whore of Christ

Crucified, hung this filth-crowned meat
The plague of the earth and of ignorance's birth
The polluted cattle shall be lead to their tombs
The weak have been corrupted let them die

Too weak to thwart the triumphal march
Delivered into dirt in helpless misery

Helpless misery
Violated purity
Helpless misery
Violated purity
