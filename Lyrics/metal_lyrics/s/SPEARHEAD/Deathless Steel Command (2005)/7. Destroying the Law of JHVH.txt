Terror Command of a Godless plight of iron demons
On Hidden Knives and invalid rites

Ten days penance, No regret, R.H. enter death
Asphyxiation in fog of hate is the Ultimate destiny
Listen to the harvest of war and order
Jerusalem's fire spat convulsion

Under black clouds of a man-made apocalypse
Dying lambs creep in extraneous insolence
Egalitaria collapses under the mire of governed fungus
Only the inquisition of mortality quells the leech

Crush the cross... the golden lies.
Indomitable honour and unholy hatred is ultimate

Decrees of terror, battle calls, Alleluia! Time to die
Ebbing plague, Total War, G.S. No More
