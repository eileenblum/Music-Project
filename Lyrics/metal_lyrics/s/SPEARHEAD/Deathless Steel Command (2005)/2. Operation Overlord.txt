Assault and enslavement
Supreme commanders of iron will
Rulers of the sea
Indomitable and defiant
Raining down a tonne of death
Unconquerable and merciless
Commanders of the Air
Flying in the face of fire

Imperial battalion - of terror
Total carnage on the coast
Inexorable on land - Marching through the littered dead
Relentless bombardments - Artillery of blackest steel

Shoulder to shoulder
In waves of advancing iron
Sovereigns of battle
The wall of approaching perdition
The lightening strikes
Descending on the enemy
On the thunder they rode
In valiance and wrath

The division's strike
Mortar and shell devastation
The sky grows dense with solid warfire
And with the stench of slaughter and conquest
