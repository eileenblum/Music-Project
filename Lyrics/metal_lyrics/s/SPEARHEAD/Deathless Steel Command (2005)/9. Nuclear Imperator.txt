Kiss the winds of nuclear devastationAs it tears at your flesh and your faithThe fires of biblical holocaustWill decimate the dying plague Annihilating the sediment of ruinWeakling humans lie in waitNuclear condemnationRazorblade screams; Terminal fate Amidst choking degeneracyBurning figures danceHand in hand to oblivionThe wandering corpses advance Coagulated atmosphereFor Earth is for the whole manHeavy on those who would not fightThose flocks of infirm half men Once again the skies watch extinctionOnce again black landscapes pave the way...
