Imperator pacificus - transgressing the law sacred 
Superseded dominion - of mere human ordinance 

For those who shall not yield 
To the dictate of the irenarch’s word 
For those who shall not laud 
The orations of his lassitude 
For those who shall not bow 
To the throne upon which such peace is crowned 
For those impending few 
Destined to seize his sword and scepter 

Ara Pacis! A sword brought for thee 
Upon the altar of majestic peace 
Ara Pacis! Fire bought for thee 
Within the temple of indolent peace 

For those who consecrate the regicide 
Will be through conquest reborn 
For those bestowed with victory 
Bestowed with a sword of peace in storm 
For those who surpass the plebian will 
Surpassing that which can’t be opposed 
Will one day hold the scepter 
Of empire, axis of the world 

Ara Pacis! Blood upon thee 
From throats of the irenic see 
Ara Pacis! Burn forevermore 
By the fire of the stratocratic law
