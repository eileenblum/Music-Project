Imperial grace bestowed by heavenâ€™s willAn emanation of the solar lawIulianus Augustus by absolute rightA king - half dust, half god Reinstate the fallen order from its bed of decadenceExtirpate the curses and the vices of the past Enter the decayed palace of ConstantinopleFated victims of tragic maledictionLet oblivion rest upon that darkened epochThe sinecurist swarms and the herders of nescience Flavius Claudius Iulianus ApostataBearer of dynastic spirit The sovereign reflector of deific truthImmutable in thy providence  The ruler of all things, around whom all things standPreserver of the celestial truth Eternal solar justice beyond the earthly clawsMaintainer of the fire undying
