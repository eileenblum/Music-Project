In battle itself is the power to arouse and awaken supremacyBeyond victory and defeat is the only virtue we surrender to Enslaved, the powers of chaos and fear, and passion that blind the fightAbove pleasure and pain, and gain and loss, surpassing moral chainsIn his cell, his pallid telluric confine, man subjects himselfInaction, desire - secular defects that war shall transcend Light against raw power, the divine path, a symbol of triumphConquered, the crisis of corporeal death - Victorious peace Whether through gain or defeat, impulse shall always hinderDeath triumphant conquers indolence and manâ€™s emotions Whether through death or victory, the ascetic shall always ascendDeath triumphant conquers storm, blood and misery
