Neither father nor fortune had ever wished That the Bismarck would forever live To depart from lifeDistrait from sufferingTill the last breathTill the last shell Neither through fortune nor chance alone Had ever a man immortality gained Masters of the world, of the seas, through this, a pure distinctionYet with no foot of earth their own, a mark of pure disciplineHumble suppliants to the bitter floods and waves of suffering They who sit in judgment to the war and to the callous sea When time grows cruel valour becomes the only light That shines in sinking darknessThat remains alight through all blessings and all illsValour raises men high when fortune falls This day will make wives widows, as the war willsPurity of silence and pure honour will thus reignResolved to duty as the destroyers emerged  Pure devotion though death was absolute Duty attendIn loyaltyYield to nothingSave dishonour In accordance with the decree of fortune perishAnd the will of blessed inexorable war Fire unchainDisable the beastCondemn to the seaDestroy the Bismarck Withered her flower of triumph and mastery Though valour remains more glorious to behold
