Let those men who do not fightFeasting at the table of slothWhere they spent their youthThere let them pass into old age Weary through indolenceNot a glory to their name The slaves of their stomachs Who leave to us sweat and dust Assumed the mask of virtueAcquired a relish for idlenessRotten with unjust prideThey pass their days till death For as to all the arts of lifeFor as to all the arts of warIs luxury a fatal viceDestroyer of a shameless state For a tranquil worldSituated in the embrace of silenceThere is no pride in their crownedFor above their heads soar men of arms Lifted torches light the pyresThis decadence - devastated Si vis pacem para bellumWhen the pillars collapse and fall The land and sea, the root and branchOf this empire shall be conquered Si vis pacem para bellumWhen the pillars collapse and fall
