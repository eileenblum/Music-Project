Europe, mother of menIn turmoil, on her dais of crumbling stoneTen years of prolonged peaceThe treaty, a testament to ruin Three kings, exchanging sword and spiritThree empires, two senescent flamesSpirit - the deathless prevailerWar - The father and the son Tsar defend the aristocratic rule With eminence, honour and humilityFranz II by the grace of GodThe last Holy Roman Emperor Great empire of NapoleonUsurping legions cross the Rhine 350 thousand Renewed hubristic martial pride Tsar, press on in blessed battleUnchain the Imperial GuardFranz Archduke converge thy losses Assemble Mother Europeâ€™s fateAdvancing force attend the fogVeiled division of St HilaireThe sun of Austerlitz is thineMay it tear the mist apart Holy Roman Empire now prone in thy graveSubmission of a kingdom once greatNew empire deliver thy sovereign domination Europe supplicate to the will of an iron hand To live ingloriousIn defeat and disgrace is to die each day To die in war in gloryIs to live forever
