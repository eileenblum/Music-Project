Millions of the youngStrode under the black skyMobilized for gloryAs their march echoed Entrenched by the raw fireImmobilized in that soilMachines controlled the fieldsWhere honour could not Obeisant to fate in the morning mistThe brotherhood of arms reached its journeyâ€™s end No requiem or obsequies For the anonymous fallen who rest in the soil No recourse through the machinesThrown into gun fire all maneuversThe sunken road now nothing more Than shell-holes filled with carcasses and wreckage
