Submit, obey, the scrolls of AbrahamSet in parchment and leaves and stone Procurators of a law before timeMarching under standards of bloodGloried in the wounds of creationIn an age barren of honour and pride Submit, obey, the scrolls of AbrahamRotting parchments and leaves and stone The purgatorian storm shall sweepThe purgatorian sun shall riseTyrants, taste the sword of truthTyrants, inhale the fire of justice Submit, obey, the scrolls of AbrahamPunish, destroy, the nonbelieversSubmit, obey, the scrolls of dissolution  Destroy, create, under this standard
