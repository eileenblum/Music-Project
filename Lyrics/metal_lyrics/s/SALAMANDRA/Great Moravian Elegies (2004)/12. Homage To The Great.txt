Question my dream and
Laugh at my hope
I shan't surrender
Shan't fear for future at all

I believe that wisdom
Of our forefathers will
Forever be praised and
Be always remembered well

[REFRAIN:]
Pay tribute to Great Moravians
Guess whoever strayed Moravians

Great realm collapsed
Many centuries passed
Where history goes
May teach us cherish the past

Who questions your dreams and
Laughs at all of your hopes
May make you surrender
Give up the future and life

[REFRAIN]

Rising forever
Guess whoever strayed Moravians
Pay tribute to Great Moravians
Wonder forever
Guess whoever strayed Moravians

[SOLO]

[REFRAIN]

Pay to forever
Guess whoever strayed Moravians
Wonder forever
I'm one of the great Moravians
Deep in my heart
I am the child of the great ones Moravians

Question my dream and
Laugh at my hope
I shan't surrender
Shan't fear for future at all
