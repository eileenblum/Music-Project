Aeons come and go
Numerous centuries passed
Great empire is lost
Buried by doubt and weird fear

Even today one may be asked
If there is a sense
To learn from past, what our fate is
And where we all go

We may learn from the past
How brave our nation's once been
We should learn it fast
That fight for freedom is real

Even today that fight is led
To never be stopped
Let's learn from past, what our fate is
And where we all go

[REFRAIN 2x]
Aeons come and go away
Will you try to learn
From what's wrong
In the times that strangled all
Hope of a nation so strong

[SOLO]

[REFRAIN]

Hear the voice Moravian
Hear the voice Great Moravian
It's your choice proud Moravian
Be the voice, Great Moravian
Hear the voice, my Moravians
Be the voice, Great Moravians

[SOLO]
