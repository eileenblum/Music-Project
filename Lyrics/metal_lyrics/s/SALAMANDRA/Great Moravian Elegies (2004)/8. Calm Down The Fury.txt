Please dress the altar
And carefully say
Each of the prayers
That may bring us hope
Force in the young man
Caught in last raid
And chant all the prayers
That may bring us hope

[BRIDGE:]
To calm the furies down
This man is doomed to die
To bring our empire back
We shall make this sacrifice

[REFRAIN:]
The priest is raising hand
To stab the chest and then
Take out his beating heart
And life
To calm the furies down
This man is doomed to die
We'll win our freedom back in war
Win back in war

Dress many more altars
And carefully say
Each of the prayers
That strengthen our hope
Force in the young men
Caught in the raids
And chant all the prayers
That feed up our hope

[BRIDGE]

[REFRAIN]
