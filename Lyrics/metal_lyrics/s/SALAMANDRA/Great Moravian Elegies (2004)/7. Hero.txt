No more
Talk of decay
I've heard
Your mournful prayer
If the nation rose
Got rid off the weak
We might conquer back
What was our realm

[BRIDGE:]
Where's your faith gone
Where is the will
Face the future
Without fear

No more
Grieving for the dead
Search for
Leader's in vain
No one ever has
Saved a nation's peace
One hero won't make
Enemies flee

[BRIDGE]

[REFRAIN:]
Let our anger grow
Make it shatter the walls
That divide our dream
From the world that's real
One hero won't bring
Back the pride and glory
Let's unite, fight back
For the realms
We had

[SOLO]

No more talk of decay...
