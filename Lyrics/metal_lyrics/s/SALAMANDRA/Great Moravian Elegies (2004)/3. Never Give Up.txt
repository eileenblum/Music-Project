Don't you give up your fight
We shan't obey dead-end fate
Days have darkened and soured
When search for shelter's been vain

[BRIDGE:]
We aren't tired enough
To dig up our graves
Where has my duke gone
Where are his kin now
We aren't tired enough
To lay in our graves
Where has my duke gone
Where are his kin now

[REFRAIN:]
Battle is on, our aim is clear
We shall walk out as free
Battle is on, our aim is set
Or else we won't come back

There's no time to comply
Accept the foreigners' law
Brave men've governed this land
Since very earliest days

[BRIDGE]

[REFRAIN]

We shan't comply with rule
Of foreigners' reign
Brave men have been our dukes
Battle is on, battle is on
Till we win

We shan't give up our fight
We don't take this fate
Don't care for cold and dark
Battle is on, battle is on
Till we win

We shan't comply with rule
Of foreigners' reign
Brave men have been our dukes
Battle is on, battle is on
Till we win

[BRIDGE]

[REFRAIN]

We'll never give up fight
Don't take this fate
Never mind cold and dark
Battle is on

We'll never give up fight
Don't take this fate
Never mind cold and dark
Battle is on
