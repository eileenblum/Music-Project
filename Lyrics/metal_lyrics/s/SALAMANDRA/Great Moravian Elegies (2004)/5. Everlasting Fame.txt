Wake! As tomorrow
Is not gonna wait
Our darkened and mournful tomorrow
Is going to take

Our homes and land down the stream
The endlessly flowing stream of time
Time that's killed
And ruined many mighty realms before

Let's hold the future
Firm in our hands
Our unique and only one future
There's no other chance

Our homes and land need each hand
Every hand clenches axe or sword
Every hand
That may be able to take control

[BRIDGE:]
No one shall suppress our land
Nobody dictates our lives

[REFRAIN:]
Freemen's realm shan't obey
Moravian country shan't die
No one shall suppress our land
Nobody dictates our lives
Freemen's realm shan't obey
Moravian country shan't die
See our fame reach the sky
Moravian country shan't die

Tomorrow is not gonna wait
Dark and mournful is sky
We shall thrust
Swords at fiends' hearts
Freemen's realm'll never obey

[SOLO]

[REFRAIN]

...See our fame reach the sky
Moravian country shan't die
