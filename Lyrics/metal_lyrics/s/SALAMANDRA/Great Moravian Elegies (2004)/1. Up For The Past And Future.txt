Let's hope for the good and no trouble
When all just seems fair
Think of the long gone days
When history was made out of 

Wish for tomorrow
That's filled with love and lived in freedom
Let there be no fear,no sorrow
When there was no hope for a future 

This wish still remained
To fight the evil reign
From ruling freemen's land 

Men in arms
Rose up against the bad
History's been made 

Out of wars
