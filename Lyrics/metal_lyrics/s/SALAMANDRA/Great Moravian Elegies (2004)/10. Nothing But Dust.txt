Courageous men joined and
Led fights and waged the wars
They tried to make the nation one
But after these thirteen
Years when the last duke died
Nobody's come to wave the flag

[BRIDGE:]
Nobody's come lead the noble men
Nobody will save freemen's dream

[REFRAIN:]
Moravian
Moravian wasteland
Now Moko blows
Ashes and dust
Over all
Moravian wasteland
Ruins of the great empire

No brave men can again
Lead fights and wage the wars
No people listen to the call
Cause after these thirteen
Years when the last duke died
They've lost their hope and will to survive
