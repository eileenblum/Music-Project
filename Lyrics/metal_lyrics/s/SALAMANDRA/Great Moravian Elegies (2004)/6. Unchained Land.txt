Down from the mountains high
Past hills and meadows
That's where hawks fly up in the sky
Downstream the rivers wide
Past ponds and branches
That's where the country draws
The life sap from its roots

Follow the streams that run
Past towns and castles
Growing stronger, deep and wide
Trace ruins of mighty realm
Seek for its remnants
Whose greatest share is there
Living in your heart

[REFRAIN 3x:]
Come, see  Great history lays open
Come, see  Our roots are here
Come, hear All country tells the story
Come, hear Glorious realm
