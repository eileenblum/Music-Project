Tears in my eyes
Turn into a rain
And wild river
Ocean with no end

Deep in my soul
Beneath peaks and stones
Eternal silence
Beats of my heart

Open your mind
Listen to my requiem
Sad melody
Song full of pain

Deep in your core
Your faith wrapped in ice
Deepest motions
Open your eyes

I've dreamt of the land so long
But now it's just your scene
That's left in my heart that is all
Say where it's give me a trace
A hundred years have been lost
As mysterious grail

Men are crying over your beauty

Know your name
Is all I want
Want to know your secret dreams

Know your name
Is all I care
Care about your strong desire
Your strong and hot desire
