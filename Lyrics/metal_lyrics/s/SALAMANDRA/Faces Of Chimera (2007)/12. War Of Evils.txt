Seven days that are coming now
Will surely go down in history
Story that can't be found in the books or memory

Bloody fight will never end
With powers of evil and its crimes
We know it's greatly powerful at all times

Fear inside but not terrified
Hiding hardly they are tired too much
Everybody who believes in the fight don't give it up

Listen to the drums and their strong sounds
Encouraging to the last night of ours
Look up to the sky and feel your heart
Tomorrow and on we'll be all apart

Want to see just smoke and steam around
So set the fire and bring all iron down
It's time to show the mystery of steel
Our dogs should stay hungry to make it real

Evil the king of darkness
Like eagle flying so damn high
Evil coming from the darkness 
Eagle our sacrifice

Bloody fight will never end
With powers of evil and its crimes
We know it's greatly powerful at all times

Fear inside but not terrified
Hiding hardly they are tired too much
Everybody who believes in the fight don't give it up
