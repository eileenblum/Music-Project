All you feel's disquiet
Longings burn and you long to pry
Lovely chimera
Sneaks into your dreams
Braids you in those betrayal nets you cry
Damn such chimera

You don't have a chance at all
You can't run away
From this nightmare's course
Looks right into your eyes
With evil-eyed sight
You sink under force

Guards you day and night
Prowls around and leaves deep trace in soul
This cruel chimera
Controls your pure mind
Lives in your dreams with the only goal
Seek and destroy

You don't have a chance at all
You can't run away
From this nightmare's course
Looks right into your eyes
With evil-eyed sight
You sink under force

Come for a fantastic ride
You feel your wings grow
Life is like free fall
Fly and rise to the sun
Your ideas burn
So wake up and jump!
