Water and fire
From way back fight and wrestle face to face
Light at the end of
Way bringing death may not just be the case

Hatred and love have
Been settled in all human hearts for so long
Sorrow and life go
Together doesn't matter if it's right of wrong

Death or glory leave
A victorious taste
Tears of happiness
Become bitter of pains

Faded is glory
And you see star above you it's a sign
Envy fills your heart
And they say truth is hiding in the wine

Death or glory leave
A victorious taste
Tears of happiness
Become bitter of pains

I see Orion shining high
Seems so close but still so faraway
Our lives are passing by
Even you have a place of your own up there
When? Did you ever tell me?
