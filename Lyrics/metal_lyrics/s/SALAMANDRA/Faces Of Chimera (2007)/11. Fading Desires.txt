Look around the world to see
How we change our needs
Desperate to find the things
To satisfy our greeds

Love and pride ain't much for us
Today you can't deny
We don't treasure glory or
The starlight in the sky, in the sky

You say you need them but it's
Your mind talking I know
We do take it all for granted
Still want more and more

Remember our ancestors
Willing to die for pride
Never hesitated to call out
Stand up and fight

Save us
To stand on solid ground
Save us
None shall damn your aid
Save us
Pray for our salvo
Save us
We promise we'll obey
