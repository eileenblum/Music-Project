You never thought deadly shadows crawling slyly
Behind you could take you far away
You're full of grief and more and more afraid
Feelings are just an empty phrase

You find no help in advice as your friends don't understand
You feed them with gall
So you imitate, got to ignore it all
And you think they don't mind at all

Now you can feel like an empty shell or a page
Someone mean and evil tore away
Your eyes are closed, you spy a misty call
From your soul that is mazing in the hell

You find no help in advice as friends don't understand
You feed them with gall
So you imitate, got to ignore it all
And you think they don't mind at all

Heart full of snow
Ice traces disappear
Hate's a boomerang that returns back to you
Heart full of snow
Muscle of ice showing fear
And it doesn't melt and doesn't tell you the truth

You keep refusing to live your dreams
New day has born to fight off all your fears
