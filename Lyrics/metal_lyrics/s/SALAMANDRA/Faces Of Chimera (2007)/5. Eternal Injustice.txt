Cruel scream spreading in town
Deep despair going around

Unjustly accused, let wilt
Innocent admit their guilt

You know force of lord is great
Beg for grace, appeal to fate

Unjustly keeping in chains
Your hands are full of blood stains

Bonfire
Set to find
Reason to blame
For revenge
Wish to frame
Denounce the bad

Thousand years no change at all
Enemies are new and more

How much blood is it gonna take
Empty words that give you ache

What gives them right, tell me why
What are their reasons to cry

How much blood are you gonna stand
Will they ever understand

Bonfire
Set to find
Reason to blame
For revenge
Wish to frame
Denounce the bad
