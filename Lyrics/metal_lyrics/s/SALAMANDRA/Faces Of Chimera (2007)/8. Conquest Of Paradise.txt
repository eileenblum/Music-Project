I sense black sky above my head
No one can see it just looks bad

Lost a thousand miles from home
Lost at the end of world
Lost at the ends of all

Tell me how much time now I have
When and if ever we'll get there

Only questions but no gainst
Just doubt and its bad taste
And death is all around

Please help me now
I lose my promise
Please tell me why

Perhaps we stand
In front of paradise
There's no way back
