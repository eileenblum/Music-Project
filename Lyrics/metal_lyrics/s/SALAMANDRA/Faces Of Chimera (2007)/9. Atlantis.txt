Listen to the story that once upon a time
Somewhere in the ocean an isle appeared for a while
Beyond Hercules pillars the great and huge empire
Conquering every country big power on the sea

None will ever tell you where that huge might arose
Their glorious existence was not to last for long
Now that power is over they failed to beat the Greeks
Going back to ocean in a single day and night

Just one day of fatal misfortune

Volcano or Poseidon
Went mad about things in the world
They could not let it widen
Atlantis had to go

You know life is boring when it's just felicity
No pain or complications but pure simplicity
You live your life to full speed when you're sad and full of pain
When jaundice and sick spirit go with you hand in hand

Just one day of fatal misfortune

Volcano or Poseidon
Went mad about things in the world
They could not let it widen
Atlantis had to go
