You! Look in my eyes
Read my lips to hear the lord
You! Listen to my voice
I am passing his word

You say "Follow the knights"
Who lead crowds but I still want more
Good and evil just fight
Which is the way to go, right way to go

You must follow your heart
Stand with pride and pray to wise men
Who never stand apart
Don't give up! Say amen

Some men wished to break free
But were too blind to trust naked truth
Saw the phantom of win
Their end was terribly cruel, terribly cruel

Heroes
From heroes
For heroes

Heroes
From heroes
For heroes
