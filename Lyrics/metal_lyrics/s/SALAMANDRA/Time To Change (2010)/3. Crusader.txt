High on the bluffs ready to fight
And to die, there is no time.
Neglected fear, anger and pain
It's the last war, it's in vain.

His promise is to truly fight
On the side of Christian God
And defending Lion Heart.
Still greed, meanness and the force
Brings the army to the loss
And it's nearly half-destroyed.

Forsaken man in Holy land losing horse walking on foot.
Saving himself from Turkish rage and escaping with the gloom.

The knight is weak he lost his pride
Wandering on until he dies.
Reveals the truth about his sin
And he knows it's late to win.

Marching across the wasted land
Knight is wounded with no faith
Trying to find a runaway.
The sky is red with fiery signs
All hopes are now burned alive
And the glory left behind.

Forsaken man in Holy land losing horse walking on foot.
Saving himself from Turkish rage and escaping with the gloom.

The greed killed you, a crusader, the blood in your eyes.
You're guilty, a crusader, your soul soon dies.
