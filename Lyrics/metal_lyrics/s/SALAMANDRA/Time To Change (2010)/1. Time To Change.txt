Ticking of time clocks basically anywhere
Anywhere in the world

Fate of these lands has been now placed in our hands.
Will we have time to mend the brittle world.
We just leave empty spaces nearly everywhere.

Stop to blacken our skies, realize to hear the cries.

Cannot we give a chance to our hungry world?
We must take control of the children's greed.
Ticking of time clocks basically anywhere.

Stop to blacken our skies, realize to hear the cries.

So try to change the scary scenes
And make them disappear in early mists.
It's time to change the beast inside
It's time to find the man to start to fight.
