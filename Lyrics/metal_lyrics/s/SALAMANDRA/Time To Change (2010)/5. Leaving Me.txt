Let's pretend, I do not know the truth
Let me know what you really feel inside
All the pain I feel and my heart you've melt
You are leaving me with no doubt.

As I lie next to you in bed
Oh I know, your feeling's not the same
Looking at your face in the sleepless night
Staring at your back warm in sleep.

To watch you leaving â¦

I know you look at me but you cannot really see
I know you think of someone else.
Each time you pass me by, my heart is broken now
I think that my soul has been cried out all.

We both know you want to leave me soon,
I look at you with a whisper in my voice.
Do you really leave, do you really go
Far away from me and my life?

To watch you leaving ...

I know you look at me but you cannot really see
I know you think of someone else.
Each time you pass me by, my heart is broken now
I think that my soul has been cried out all.

I know you look at me but you cannot really see
I know you think of someone else.
Each time you pass me by, my heart is broken now
I think that my soul has been cried out all.

Your face is somewhere far
Hidden in distant world of your own inner life
(My sorrow will not keep you here no longer by my side)

Your face is somewhere far
Hidden in distant world of your own inner life
(My sorrow will not keep you here no longer by my side)
Your face is somewhere far
