I can hear your voice on the edge of doomy night
I can hear you sigh when the Moon shines bright.

And when you are near it seems like the time
Has fallen death still
Your spirit comes now
And telling me tale of your sad destiny.

Your shadow is here dancing on walls
Coming with chill
Coming with cry
I know your fate is just lonely wandering.

I know your pale face from all my restless dreams
I know your lost soul can't reach eternal sleep.

And when you are near it seems like the time
Has fallen death still
Your spirit comes now
And telling me tale of your sad destiny.

Your shadow is here dancing on walls
Coming with chill
Coming with cry
I know your fate is just lonely wandering.

From your solitude
You are calling me
Oh, follow me.

Never find the rest
You are begging me
Oh, set me free.

From your solitude
You are calling me
Oh, follow me.

Never find the rest
You are begging me
Oh, set me free.

Your shadow is here dancing on walls
Coming with chill
Coming with cry
I know your fate is just lonely wandering.

From your solitude
You are calling me
Oh, follow me.

Never find the rest
You are begging me
Oh, set me free.

From your solitude
You are calling me
Oh, follow me.

Never find the rest
You are begging me
Oh, set me free.

Oh, set me free.

Oh, set me free.
