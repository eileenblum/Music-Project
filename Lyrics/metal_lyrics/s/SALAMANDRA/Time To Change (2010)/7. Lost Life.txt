Breathing once again her name
And you will never know your son's face.
Hopeless in the darkest day
Nobody ever told you this fate.

Your soul's in the grave
And you go just alone
Through the fog and clouds
Going far and so far.

What you hoped so much
Coming back your home
Instead of that you are
Lying down
And why you must be here

No life just sorrow memories
No life just sorrow memories

Your heart is now lifeless
And you are lying in the silence.
Your life has come to the end
The destiny that cannot be bent.

Your soul's in the grave
And you go just alone
Through the fog and clouds
Going far and so far.

What you hoped so much
Coming back your home
Instead of that you are
Lying down
And why you must be here.

No life just sorrow memories
No life just sorrow memories
No life just sorrow memories
No life just sorrow memories

You're away from this world
Your death is so useless
Shadows cover your face
Staying in the darkness.

You leave us forever
We lose you and never
Won't forget your face and
You leave us now and once forever.

You're away from this world
Your death is so useless
Shadows cover your face
Staying in the darkness.

You leave us forever
We lose you and never
Won't forget your face and
You leave us now and once forever.

No life just sorrow memories
And once forever
No life just sorrow memories
And once forever
No life just sorrow memories
And once forever
No life just sorrow memories
And once forever
