When you get to the end of all
The light you know so long
And it's time to enter the mysterious.

Step in the darkness, the unknown
Even if you feel alone
And it's time to enter the mysterious.

Share all your feelings in your heart
With the nightlight and the sky
And the day is far from you.

Dreams disappear in universe
Chasing splinters of your life
And reflects the time on you.

Seems all the stars and galaxies
Moving at the speed of light
And it's time to enter the mysterious.

Lights in the darkness of the space
High and glitter everywhere
And it's time to enter the mysterious.

Share all your feelings in your heart
With the nightlight and the sky
And the day is far from you.

Dreams disappear in universe
Chasing splinters of your life
And reflects the time on you.

See and open your mind to million of stars
That shine on you brightly
See and open your mind to million of stars
Feel with your soul the eternity.

Share all your feelings in your heart
With the nightlight and the sky
And the day is far from you.

Dreams disappear in universe
Chasing splinters of your life
And reflects the time on you.

See and open your mind to million of stars
That shine on you brightly
See and open your mind to million of stars
Feel with your soul the eternity.

See and open your mind to million of stars
That shine on you brightly
See and open your mind to million of stars
Feel with your soul the eternity.
