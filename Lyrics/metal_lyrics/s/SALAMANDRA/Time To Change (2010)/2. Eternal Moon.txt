Rising and shining in the night
Floating to us with silver rays
Emerging Mistress of the light.

She turns her face upon the world
Below the nightside of the Earth
Trembling the souls of young and old
There's nothing that can be more worth.

In distance, in silence, blissful in peace and doomy night.

She's bringing us the hope to live
Returning ancient human roots
Guides us and shows the way to heel
The whole world now and not to lose.

Everyone turns their gaze towards
The fiery and eternal heart
Nobody wants her leave and die
Forever, helping in our fight.

In distance, in silence, blissful in peace and doomy night.

From birth and death once and for all the night time and
Nothing at all escapes from your constant existence.
We never stop waiting for the soft moon shining
Enjoying your presence before the night grows older now.

Beyond the world of time and space
Rising and shining in the night
Floating to us with silver rays
Emerging Mistress of the light.

She turns her face upon the world
Below the nightside of the Earth
Trembling the souls of young and old
There's nothing that can be more worth.

In distance, in silence, blissful in peace and doomy night.

From birth and death once and for all the night time and
Nothing at all escapes from your constant existence.
We never stop waiting for the soft moon shining
Enjoying your presence before the night grows older now.

From birth and death once and for all the night time and
Nothing at all escapes from your constant existence.
We never stop waiting for the soft moon shining
Enjoying your presence before the night grows older now.
