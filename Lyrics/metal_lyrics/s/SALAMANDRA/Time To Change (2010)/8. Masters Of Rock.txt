Tonight we're all free, see what it means
Heal all your mind from all inner fears.
Let's rock through the night white stars are here
None can change us, none can change me.

Believe our time has come
In the darkness of the soul
Fly towards the silver storm
And you know you're not alone.

We don't want to be silent and calm,
Let's live our life we have lived so far.
Fuck off the world of angels and lies
Better to sing and stay alive.

Believe our time has come
In the darkness of the soul
Fly towards the silver storm
And you know you're not alone.

For you are "Masters (of Rock)", heavy - metal fools
For you are "Masters (of Rock)", without any rules.
For you are "Masters (of Rock)", singing in the crowd
For you are "Masters (of Rock)", screaming down aloud.

Believe our time has come
In the darkness of the soul
Fly towards the silver storm
And you know you're not alone.

For you are "Masters (of Rock)", heavy - metal fools
For you are "Masters (of Rock)", without any rules.
For you are "Masters (of Rock)", singing in the crowd
For you are "Masters (of Rock)", screaming down aloud.

For you are "Masters (of Rock)", heavy - metal fools
Screaming down aloud
