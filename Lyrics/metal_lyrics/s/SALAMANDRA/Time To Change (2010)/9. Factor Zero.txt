I walk by the streets and crowded towns
Asking myself who they are
Faces looking at me - quite bizarre
Are they "superhumans" now?

Beneath the everyday face mask
There is a big man inside
Hidden in casual day life.

Nobody knows, the unknown name -
Not visible, I'm Factor Zero.
My mind's so full, my life's so rich
Not visible, I'm Factor Zero.

Little gem of innocence inside
That makes me want to believe
Decency will triumph in the fight
Defeats the stupid and the pride.

Beneath the everyday face mask
There is a big man inside
Hidden in casual day life.

Nobody knows, the unknown name -
Not visible, I'm Factor Zero.
My mind's so full, my life's so rich
Not visible, I'm Factor Zero.

Nobody knows, the unknown name -
Not visible, I'm Factor Zero.
My mind's so full, my life's so rich
Not visible, I'm Factor Zero.

Nobody knows, the unknown name -
Not visible, I'm Factor Zero.
My mind's so full, my life's so rich
Not visible, I'm Factor Zero.

I'm Factor Zero
I'm Factor Zero
