Splatterhouse-the last place you will be seen alive
Splatterhouse-shrouded in disease, darkness, pus, filth and slime
Splatterhouse-your final resting place once your inside
Splatterhouse-you have been warned now you will die
Now you will die
Welcome to our rotten abode
The house your parents told you not to approach
A family of filth, a legend of horror
Gruesome sights and delights just inside the door
Suspension of life upon meat hanger hooks
Could not resist temptation, you had to have a look
Now youâre a guest at tonights long-pig feast
A splendid night of terror in honor of the deceased
In honor of the deceased
the last place you will be seen alive
shrouded in disease, darkness, pus, filth and slime
your final resting place once your inside
you have been warned now you will die
Bound, gagged and drugged/conscious but paralyzed
A sick display of the grotesque for your very eyes
Hear the muted screams from underneath the floor
As I bring a corpse into the room and start to explore
Chest cavity split-rib cage I cleave
Limbs turned to stumps-for now the head I leave
Cold sweat runs down your face and you begin to squirm
As I begin to operate upon the cranium
The room is now abuzz-bonesaw begins to grind
Perfection with a fine toothed blade-explorations of the mind
With a pull and a pop-grey matter is exposed
Unzip my trousers with one hand and enter the frontal lobe
I take my mind fucks literally and now it is complete
Iâm in a state of ecstacy, my appetite increased
Now to bring you to the table my brothers will soon join
Preparation of your first cannibal feast has kept them occupied
The feast it is now ready, now itâs time to dine
All you can eat human meat, all it cost you was your life
The house built on hell reputation of infamy
The last house on the left of the dead end street
Getaway for the weekend or the rest of your life
A horrific time for all bring the kids and the wife
Your kids and your wife
