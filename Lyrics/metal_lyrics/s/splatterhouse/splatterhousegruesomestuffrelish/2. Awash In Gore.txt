how long has it been/Iâm confined to this box
they have laid me to rest, decay, fester and rot
for of peace I know none/death has only brought pain
the foul stench of my flesh has driven me insane
My head is now pounding I must ease the pain
Long has it been since blood ran through these veins
Now brought back from death, from eternal sleep
To stalk this wretched earth, a living flesh feast
Cadaver-brought back to life
Earth vomit-deaths putrid slave
Fresh flesh, guts and brains to devour
Fear and terror paralyze your face
No grave can hold me nor casket contain
This dead rotten body and itâs lust for brains
I splinter the pine and tear up through the earth
Nightfall has come and hellâs given birth!!
A putrescent mass, I now hunt for my prey
Cancerous cadaver, pallbearer of pain
Steaming bloody mass is what I crave
To sickness death and gore I am a slave
Cadaver brought back to life
Earth vomit deaths putrid slave
Dead hands rip your throat in two
Blood rains a tracheal spew
Black of night/I lie in wait
Death approaching/a revolting fate
I gorge myself on muscles, organs, gristle and grime
Nothing will go to waste as your flesh becomes one with mine
Awash in gore
Through flesh and bone I chew and tear paralyzed by fear-undead attack
Before your eyes I make you my disembowelment feast- undead attack
Organ harvest, cranial dig, ripped limb from limb-undead attack
