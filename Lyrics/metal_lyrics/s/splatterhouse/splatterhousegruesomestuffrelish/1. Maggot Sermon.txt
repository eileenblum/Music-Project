Inhabitants of rot /companion to death
Come forth to the wound/congregation anti-flesh
Legions for the lesions/deliver malady
Exterminate the pale flesh/consume humanity
Promotion of death/ from deep within the skin
Infected flesh wound festering/we burrow deep within
I call upon my brothers as they scream and crawl and squirm
The blood and pus our nesting ground the king of rot white worm
Maggot swarm regurgitates/vomits out your mouth
Feel us move beneath the skin/your existence is moving south
The stench of your infected wound draws flies to the room
As your head lay down to sleep your body becomes a maggot womb
Body cavity collapse/liquefied guts/all immunities failed
This body can take no more
Stomach burns/nauseating pain/grips this infected body
Festering swarm/gut munch galore
Inhabitants of rot/companion to death
Come forth to the wound/ congregation anti-flesh
Legions for the lesion/deliver malady
Exterminate the flesh/consume humanity
feast upon the feeble/while I feast upon your brain
internal organ damage/drive your mind insane
populate inside your body/larval human hive
prolapsed rectum, ulcers/eating you fucking alive
The pressure builds within your head you cannot keep control
You wretch and gag and hold your guts as we exit the nearest hole
Inhabitants of rot/companion to death
Come forth to the wound/congregation anti-flesh
Legions for the lesion/ deliver malady
Exterminate the flesh/consume humanity
Promotion of death from deep within the skin
Internal organ damage/drive your mind insane
Prolapsed rectum, ulcers/eating you fucking alive
