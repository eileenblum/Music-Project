Lost in translation what fractions may hide
Deaf to allegory
Unless the digits combine

Dice roll

Through the skylight
Clouds compressing
Taking hold
Sunlight's dying, fighting, trying
But can't unfold
I feel cold, am I dead?

No, but lifeless instead

I froze all conclusions
I gave in to lies
Faith spoke to disaster
Disaster replied

Through the skylight
Clouds compressing
Taking hold
Sunlight's dying, fighting, trying
But can't unfold
I feel cold, am I dead?

Am I dead?

Through the skylight
Clouds compressing
Taking hold
Sunlight's dying, fighting, trying
But can't unfold
I feel cold and reset
