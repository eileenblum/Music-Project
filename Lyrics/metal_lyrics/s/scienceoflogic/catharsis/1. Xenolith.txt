Our jungle bleeds as the lions scream
When all the anger goes through the teeth
We may divide for one more time
Be sure it never ends to go by

I'm reaching out but all angels went blind
I'm begging louder but they can't hear my cries

I saw this flame was coming up
But no one stopped the growth
While all the fire encircles us
The ash I breathe numbs out my soul

My body moves but my mind is asleep
Listening to biased words I cannot believe
For this machine takes its power from lies
You are the mechanist and so am I

I'm reaching out but all angels went blind
I'm begging louder but they can't hear my cries

I saw this flame was coming up
But no one stopped the growth
While all the fire encircles us
The ash I breathe numbs out my soul

Our jungle bleeds as the lions scream
When all the anger goes through the teeth
For this machine takes its power from lies

I'm reaching out but all angels went blind
I'm begging louder but they can't hear my cries

I saw this flame was coming up
But no one stopped the growth
While all the fire encircles us
The ash I breathe numbs out my soul
