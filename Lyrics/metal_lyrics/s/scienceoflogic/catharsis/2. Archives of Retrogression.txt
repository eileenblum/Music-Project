A living entity on sale as a sprite
Across a platform that consists of these tiles
Is an allusion to your struggle in life
Without having a guideline

Now come inside - I am your guide
For this trip through human souls
Where stories end before they're told
And public suicide

Outwardly no one seems to perish of misery
Pretending to be fine just to gain sympathy

These are the archives of retrogression
Add a shot of yourself
Learned to bring all kinds of motion to life
They outstand - but at what price?

A living entity on sale as a sprite
Across a platform that consists of these tiles
Is an allusion to your struggle in life
Without having a guideline

I'm given lives - also your smile
Though you don't know my face
I promise you that some will gaze
As others simply wipe
