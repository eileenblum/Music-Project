Donât tell me once again that this was all just according to plan. I thought Iâd seen everything hidden up your sleeve, I never saw this coming. If only I could find a way, a way through this pain, never again. You left me stranded, you left me scared, I can barely hold on. Quiet, Iâve heard all that there is to hear. You stated your fears to my ears, never again. Falling over I had to let go of all that I knew. Whatever happened to forever now itâs never, (I hope you shake and shiver when you roll over to the cold side of the bed, Iâm not there) Hey faithless, we canât be. I never expected it to come to this so goodbye happiness. (You made me think that I would never be good enough so I kept at it, I gave and gave and gave) Goodbye. When youâre done saying where I went wrong, could you bare to tell me where I belong? Iâll fight âtil thereâs nothing left of me, Iâll go wherever I need. Iâll fly to the furthest star to forget the fact that you left me. Ill fight âtil thereâs nothing left of me, Iâll go wherever I need. Iâll fly to the furthest star to find out how to live my dreams. You had me at goodbye. Now itâs all coming through, Iâm finally seeing you. Hey faithless, itâs allâ¦(Whatever happened to forever now itâs never) Whatever happened to forever now itâs never. (I hope you shake and shiver when you roll over to the cold side of the bed, Iâm not there) Hey faithless, we canât be. I never expected it to come to this so goodbye happiness.(You made me think that I would never be good enough so I kept at it, I gave and gave and gave) Goodbye. Hey faithless, you know I needed more, I guess thatâs what best friends are for. Waste away like the smoke that disperses in the air, and watch me live on, watch me fight and win and succeed. I know that breaks your heart, but itâs all you deserve, and now weâre even.
