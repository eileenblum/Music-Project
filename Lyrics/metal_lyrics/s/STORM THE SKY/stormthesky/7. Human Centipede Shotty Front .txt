[feat. Ray Vavasis]Before the ends of the world meet, and opposites collide and sink. Iâll show you what it means to live free from regret. Coward, youâre running out of time, to make your mark or get left behind. This world doesnât owe you shit, itâs up to you to make the most of it. Choose or be chosen. To the ones that will never (never, no never), be the best and the better (Iâll be the best I can be), for now and forever (stay by my side). I canât believe such a beautiful creation was so wrong in oh so many ways. Through all the choices that Iâve made, youâll find my legacyâs engraved in stone. No, nothingâs set in stone. The quicker that you learn that, the faster we move on. Leave the past right where it belongs, whatâs done is done. If you come at me youâll be on your knees. To the ones that will never (never, no never), be the best and the better (Iâll be the best I can be), for now and forever(stay by my side). To the ones that will never (never, no never), be the best and the better (Iâll be the best I can be), for now and forever (stay by my side). Donât listen to anything they say, itâs all fake (promise me youâll stay). Darling donât get played, donât let this be their game (then I could find my way, I never thought it would end like this). Iâm there with you in your thoughts (Iâm sorry Iâm there with you in your). When you see that youâve been deceived. Then youâll see, then youâll believe.
