I believe in a sense that less is more. The failings of my past will at last, light the path that I will always be true to. Donât be afraid to take my outstretched hand and walk with me. Promise youâll follow me through this. Another failure, another second chance. Donât be content in your misery. If youâre in a state of mind, you think you canât survive. Another chance is another gone. No closer to fleeing from this state of misery. Breathe in a new day and look around you. Wake up from this dream these walls are closing in. A second chance to start again. Trust that I really did mean to fix this, if you didnât say no. With every closing door, light shines from another. I would have tried and strived just for us to survive. But one fatal lie will tear us apart. Of all things a lie will be the end of us. (Youâre never there, when I needed you most) Oh how those cards have changed. Iâm ready to abuse the fucking power. Letâs get this straight. You never meant a thing to me. Youâve had your chances, but you crossed the line. Donât even think for a second, youâll ever cross my mind. Youâve had your chances, but you crossed me one too many times. Fuck it, this is goodbye. You are the best thing that never happened to me. Choke.
