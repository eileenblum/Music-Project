[feat. Trenton Smith]Well fuck I'm in love again
head stuck in an oven and
There's no such thing as youth without consequence

The haze has settled in,
And things are cloudier than they have ever been
I don't know where I stand in importance when it comes to all the truth that I am yet to see
I feel your spirit with me,

We're walking side by side,
But your heart it fades,
And I've been feeling it for days,
At the end of it all,
You're broken

Did I mention that you're the only thing I want more than attention?
If these walls could talk the talk I'm sure they'd back me up
And my intentions, well they're the only thing I feel like I have to prove
Cos these words aren't verbs (true)
First thing's first
You've gotta let me help you

This is exactly what I meant when I said you were perfect
Perfect for someone else
You'll never show me that you proved you deserved it
It Wasn't worth it

I feel you here
Taking over shattering all I have
Just give the rest of me back
Keep me intact
You took the best of me just give the rest of me back

Did I mention that you're the only thing I want more than attention?
If these walls could talk the talk I'm sure they'd back me up
And my intentions, well they're the only thing I feel like I have to prove
Cos these words aren't verbs (true)
First thing's first
You gotta let me help you

You tried to sow us together again
With a needle of reckless intent and you cut every thread I had ever stitched in
You were death of me before I let you in
And god I hope this sentence stings
Hang by a thread
I hope you unravel slow

Did I mention that your attentions the only thing I want
And If these walls could talk the talk I'm sure they'd back me up
And my intentions, well they're the only thing I feel like I have to prove
Cos these words aren't verbs (true)
First thing's first
You gotta let me help you

Did I mention that you're the only thing I want more than attention?
If these walls could talk the talk I'm sure they'd back me up
And my intentions, well they're the only thing I feel like I have to prove
Cos these words aren't verbs (true)
First thing's first
You gotta let me help you
