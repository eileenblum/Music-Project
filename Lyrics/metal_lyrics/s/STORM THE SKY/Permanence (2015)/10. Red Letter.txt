Oh my god
You're so overwhelming
Oh my god
You're sober so you tell me

Bite your tongue
Just this once
Bit your tongue
this is more than we can speak of

Hold your breath run for cover
Tell me how you feel
No regrets, None but lovers
Do you feel alive?

Nothings left but the light of tomorrows hope
Forget the rest I swear we're almost home
Nothings Left but tomorrow
We're unforgettable

We're unforgettable
Forget the pain we used to know
I swear we're almost home
Don't be defined by what you've been
You'll see, in time there's hope inside everything

Oh my god
There's no hope for us if we don't find or feel love
Oh my god
Trust together, swear you'll never be giving up
on just what you are

Hold your breath run for cover
Tell me how you feel
No regrets, None but lovers
Do you feel alive?

Nothing's left but the light of tomorrows hope
Forget the rest I swear we're almost home
Nothings Left but tomorrow
We're unforgettable

We're unforgettable
Forget the pain we used to know
I swear we're almost home
Don't be defined by what you've been
You'll see, in time there's hope inside everything

There's love
All around us
Blood
That surrounds our hearts

We're one in the same
We're one in the same

Our memories are evidence
We'll always remain
Far from broken, finding hope inside everything

We're unforgettable
Forget the pain we used to know
I swear we're almost home
[Repeated]
