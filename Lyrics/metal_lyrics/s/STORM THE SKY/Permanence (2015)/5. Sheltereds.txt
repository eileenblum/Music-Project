Oh my god I need to find some shelter I know I need to find
The rest of my life
Put your ears to the ground
Can you hear it now
We're building bridges just to knock them down
Destroy your doubts
How can you tell me that you don't need saving now
This is the sound of a lost generation
I need to know that you're with me
We're nowhere near the truth
We've gotten used to liars
We're just improvising life

Just last a lifetime
I can teach you how
And I can slow time down
So it takes a lifetime
For you to say good bye
Just show me your mind
I'll take it and change your life
I can't offer you a moment in time
But I swear I'll always be by your side

If I could find the perfect rhyme
to show the world is alive I swear we can make this right
I'll take your pride
And break it before your eyes

We will become what we deserve
A life lost, a lesson learnt
We will become what we deserve
I won't watch the world burn

Just last a lifetime
I can teach you how
And I can slow time down
So it takes a lifetime
For you to say good bye
Just show me your mind
I know I can change it if i try
I can't offer you a moment in time
But I swear I'll always be by your side

I need you to show that you're with me
I need just to know you're here
I swear we've been sworn into secrecy, forcibly. [x2]

Are you listening?

You're hiding inside reciting your lies
But all I see is fear
They say the clouds have a silver lining
But the clouds will be gone in time and I fall down hopeless and begging I cry out
Can you hear me now [x2]
