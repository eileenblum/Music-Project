Mother what you're telling me
Is that you want to leave
You'll never know what you've done to break me
Now everytime I close my eyes I see a broken mess that I can't repress

So what you're telling me
Is that want to leave
You'll never know what you've done to break us down
All along there's been a sickness building up
I'm gonna let it out, I'm gonna let it out

If the world loves a lover
I wonder, I wonder
If the world can recover
If all's fair in love and war
I wonder, I wonder
At the end of it all
Why are we left wanting more,
What are we searching for

I feel the walls shake and I can't escape
It's like prison made inside my mind
I try to block out the sound you kept him around
in the end you let yourself down

Now it all comes down to the fact
that you never had the chance
to take back the choice you made
Your sons are awake to the way you've changed
They'll never feel the same

If the world loves a lover
I wonder, I wonder
If the world can recover
If all's fair in love and war
I wonder, I wonder
At the end of it all
Why are we left wanting more,
What are we searching for

If blood is thicker than water
Water is thicker than love
When life just don't feel like enough
If blood is thicker than water
Water is thicker than love
When life just don't feel like enough
Yeah Love just don't feel like enough
If blood is thicker than water
Water is thicker than love
When life just don't feel like enough
