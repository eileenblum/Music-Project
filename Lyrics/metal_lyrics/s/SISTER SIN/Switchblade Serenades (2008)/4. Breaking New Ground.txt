Let's give 'em hard and real mean
To put an end to this rock 'n' roll scene
Here's to ya all, something with class
Deliver good and fast, fast, fast

No moral sense in me, I scream and yell
So fucking pissed off, louder than hell
I wanna win, don't run and hide
It is my way with no compromise

We're dysfunctional punks and bastards

(Screw you) we're breaking new ground
(Fuck you) this is the new sound
(Screw you) we're breaking new ground
(Fuck) all of you, this is the new sound

Hey-hey
Hey-hey
Hey-hey
Hey-hey

Of me, there is no other side
The better you know, the better you like
On stage, I'm in a rage
I'm like an animal locked in a cage

To me, it's personal, it's getting me psyched
And you can spit on me all that you like
It's my show and there is no tomorrow of mine

We're dysfunctional punks and bastards

(Screw you) we're breaking new ground
(Fuck you) this is the new sound
(Screw you) we're breaking new ground
(Fuck) all of you, this is the new sound

Hey-hey
Hey-hey
Hey-hey
Hey-hey

Commit your suicide
I feel no sympathy
'Cause it's an easy way
To not fade away

Hey-hey-hey-hey

(Screw you) we're breaking new ground
(Fuck you) this is the new sound
(Screw you) we're breaking new ground
(Fuck) all of you, this is the new sound
(Hey-hey) we're breaking new ground
(Hey-hey) this is the new sound
(Hey-hey) we're breaking new ground
(Hey-hey) this is the new sound
