You'll get nothing for nothing, it's good how honesty feels
Get in the fight and you better grab life and shake it a little bit
With no hands on the wheel to make sure it's for real
Open them eyes 'cause we ain't got nine lives to make it

There's been a lot of shit 'fore these eyes
We're not a number to make them increase

By our own terms, the way it should be
It's the way that we want it
This is just who we are, it's not if it's because
Death will greet us

You better live by the moment and do as you please
Don't stay on the ground and wait until you've been found by a savior, think of it
It's what matters the most, so let's bring them a toast
From out of this league, we'll come and hunt you with bad ass behavior

It's been a lot of shit 'fore these eyes
We're not a number to make them increase

By our own terms, the way it should be
It's the way that we want it
This is just who we are, it's not if it's because
Death will greet us
By our own terms, the way it should be
It's the way that we want it
This is just who we are, it's not if it's because
Death will greet us

You'll get nothing for nothing, it's good how honesty feels
Get in the fight and you better grab life and shake it, think of it

By our own terms, the way it should be
It's the way that we want it
This is just who we are, it's not if it's because
Death will greet us
By our own terms, the way it should be
It's the way that we want it
This is just who we are, it's not if it's because
Death will greet us
