Let's make this one our own
This is one of ours
Now c'mon and bring this motherfucker home

Places I have been, anywhere I'll stay
Here is my life to sign away
Riding the high waves along the city streets
A fortune underneath these dirty feet

There's a saying
Everywhere you're going
And remember
There's a place identified as rotten, we still chase

Now get this

And the road keeps hammer on with no promises to keep
You better step aside as we beat the street
No remorse and no regrets, were so total and complete
So just step aside as we beat the street

It's time to leave this town again to trust no one
Hell inside of me, the war I won
Practicing the blues in every drop of rain
Absorb everything just to feel the pain

And I will play this
Everywhere I'm going
A reflection
Of the truth and with a great policy of youth

So lick this

And the road keeps hammer on with no promises to keep
You better step aside as we beat the street
No remorse and no regrets, we're so total and complete
So just step aside as we beat the street

And the road keeps hammer on with no promises to keep
No remorse and no regrets, we're so total and complete
We beat the street

And the road keeps hammer on with no promises to keep
You better step aside as we beat the street
No remorse and no regrets, we're so total and complete
So just step aside as we beat the street
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
So step aside
