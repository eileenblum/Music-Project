I'll lay down the news for ya honey
And leave nothing in between
You like the fast way of money
And no promises to keep

You want my love and I will do ya for days
I'll nail you down (my little bitch) and I spit in your face
I know you know I would, just like I know you should

There is no one who will ever change my way, oh, no, no, no, no
No, not this time or the next day
C'mon, I give it to you straight

Love/hate, Scandinavian made, I'm getting all I can take
I said love/hate, yeah I'm the bastard you will love
To love/hate, Scandinavian made, I'm getting all I can take
I said love/hate, yeah I'm the bastard

I have been cold-hearted maybe
My love is rotten to the core
But it suits you, baby
And to me, it's never been a bore

In every way, I'm just a slug on my own
Against the wall (between your legs) I'll never leave you alone
It never matters to me
Whatever happens will be

There is no one who will ever change my way, oh, no, no, no, no
No, not a single word they say
I pledge allegiance to the state of?

Love/hate, Scandinavian made, I'm getting all I can take
I said love/hate, yeah I'm the bastard you will love
To love/hate, Scandinavian made, I'm getting all I can take
I said love/hate, yeah I'm the bastard you will love

Love/hate, Scandinavian made, I'm getting all I can take
I said love/hate, yeah I'm the bastard you will love
To love/hate, Scandinavian made, I'm getting all I can take
I said love/hate, I'm the bastard you will love to hate
