Wanna say hello to my little friend?
We're back in business until the end
You oughta know I want you

Let me take you out and there's a place I know
Have a couple of drinks and when we're ready, we'll go
Back to my place, I will show you

We're everlasting you and I
Even if it was only for a night
I leave you with this
What I'm sorry to say is

Out of my way
I never wanna see you again
Out of my way
The price you pay for being one out of ten

Out of my way
I never wanna see you again
Out of my way
The price you pay for being one out of ten

I love you still as a friend to begin with
Don't sit and wait there by the phone
'Cause you will find yourself so alone
Out of hope and without reason

We never stood the test of time
And I guess I never even really tried
It's what it is, I'm not sorry to say this

Out of my way
I never wanna see you again
Out of my way
The price you pay for being one out of ten
Out of my way
I never wanna see you again
Out of my way
The price you pay for being one out of ten
All I have to say is
I'll never be the one committed to you

Out of my way
Out of my way
I never want to see you again
Out of my way
Out of my way
The price you pay for being one out of ten

Out of my way
I never wanna see you again
Out of my way
The price you pay for being one out of ten
Out of my way
Out of my way
Out of my way
The price you pay for being one out of ten
