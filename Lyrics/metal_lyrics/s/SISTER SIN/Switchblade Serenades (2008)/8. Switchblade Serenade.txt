I've been watching you from afar
And I really like what I see
Now the closer and closer to you that I get
The feelings intoxicate me
I will make you mine forever
I only wanna be with you
And it will only be me
Now there is only one thing I can do

What has become of me
You'll taste the

Brutal in me
For you I've made a switchblade serenade
Obsessive me
Your life begins to fade away
Significant made
A switchblade serenade
Brutality
Mind over yours

I like the smell of your skin
There's no words to say...you say nothing
I had to put you to sleep
You're lying here next to me
You will never escape
This is the way I want it to be

My love's a guillotine
You'll taste the

Brutal in me...

Brutal in me
For you I've made a switchblade serenade
Obsessive me
Your life begins to fade away
