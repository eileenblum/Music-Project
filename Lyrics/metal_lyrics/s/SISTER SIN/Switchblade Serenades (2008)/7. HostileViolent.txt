So hellish mean yet tragical
And so obscene
It's hostile violent tonight
And you'll find
The main attraction is the action in our kill
Get yourself ready for a fight

This is all there is to be
For y'all to see
It is all we know
We're all fucking ready to blow

Hostile violent
We're bad new a-comin' to smash your silence
Hostile violent
We're bad news bad we're
Hostile violent
We're bad news a-comin to smash your silence
Hostile violent
We're bad news bad so bad

Let's turn it up
Into this madhouse human zoo
You don't have to look twice
You will find us kick the living shit
Out of everything in sight
You can consider yourself through

This is all there is to be
For y'all to see
It is all we know
We're all fucking ready to blow

Hostile violent...

Coming closer now we're near
Listen? The scratching on your wall
My switchblade knife hostility kills

Hostile violent...
Coming closer now we're here
