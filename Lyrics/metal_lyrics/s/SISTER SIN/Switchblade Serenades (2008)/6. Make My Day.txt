Listen up baby, you're no fool
I wish I walked you home from school
Dream lover, head to tail
Could've put a lot of boys in jail

Tell you what, you're red hot
Let's go do it in the parking lot

I mean every word I say
And I wish you'd stay
Stay mean, stay clean
Don't ever ask me where I've been

Shine a light on me
Come on babe, set me free
Don't go 'way please, please stay
Roll over and make my day
Shine a light on me
Come on babe, set me free
Don't go 'way please, please stay
Roll over and make my day

Hey
Hey

You're so bad honey, you're so tough
Skin so smooth, but your tongue's so rough
Crazy mama, turn me down
Watch out 'cause I'll be 'round

You're so bad, I'm so glad
Best woman that I ever had
I mean every single word
And I hope you heard

I'm the one to turn you on
Stick with me and you can't go wrong

Shine a light on me
Come on babe, set me free
Don't go 'way please, please stay
Roll over and make my day
Shine a light on me
Come on babe, set me free
Don't go 'way please, please stay
Roll over and make my day

Be the one you want to be
Don't go anywhere far from me

Shine a light on me
Come on babe, set me free
Don't go 'way please, please stay
Roll over and make my day
Shine a light on me
Come on babe, set me free
Don't go 'way please, please stay
Roll over and make my day

Shine a light on me
Shine a light on me
Shine a light on me
Shine a light on me
