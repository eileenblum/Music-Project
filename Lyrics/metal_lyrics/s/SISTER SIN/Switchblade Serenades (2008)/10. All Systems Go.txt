When the time is right I'm moving in
from two steps behind
Fred Astaire's in a sway
keep moving all the time
You're always a familiar face
to the eyes that won't go blind
Standing here in the shades now
Ready to walk the line?

We will live for the ages...and all time

Freak out ya seekers
All systems go
Leave all what has been behind
Freak out ya seekers and you
All should know
Won't ever let 'em take my pride
All systems go

Sell-out boredom euro-trash
like me, myself and I
Livin' ain't a luxury
when no one's at your side
Yesterday has been and gone
and my heroes gone wild
Everything that's left for me
is a wicked worried smile

I'll keep on turning pages...until I find

Freak out ya seekers...

Nothing will stay the same
Now we can stake our claim

Freak out ya seekers...
