Little by little, my love, each day
Inch by inch we fade away
Screw all the matters, save the end
Better start breathing, stop pretend
Out of the blue as a long lost child
Into the black, running wild
Beat up and bruised, but hey, I'm alright yeah, I'll stray

Feel it's trembling wild

You've predicted a war inside of my mind (red-on, alright)
I'm on parole and killing time
You've predicted a war inside of my mind (red-on, alright)
I'm on parole and killing time

Back on demand for sure, it's you
Who justify my point of view
Caught up in dreaming, I'm aware
High on devotion and I don't care
Out of the blue as a long lost child
Into the black, running wild
I'm on the loose, but I'm still alright yeah, I'll stray

Feel it's trembling wild

You've predicted a war inside of my mind (red-on, alright)
I'm on parole and killing time
You've predicted a war inside of my mind (red-on, alright)
I'm on parole and killing time

I'm on my way to go now
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Feel its trembling wild
You've predicted a war

You've predicted a war inside of my mind (red-on, alright)
I'm on parole and killing time
You've predicted a war inside of my mind (red-on, alright)
I'm on parole and killing time

I'm on parole and I'm red-on, alright
With war inside my mind
I'm on parole and I'm red-on, alright
With war inside my mind
