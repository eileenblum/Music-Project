My fuel's injected
Blood's running hot
I won't get down on you
I ain't your slut
You won't spit on me, no
You've had your fun
No regrets on nothing I have done

You want a piece of me tonight
You've got it

Come get a piece of me tonight
In for the kill it's live or die
Eye to eye
You want a piece of me tonight
I'll get ya
Eye to eye
In for the kill it's live or die
I'll get ya
Eye to eye

A slice of excitement
Right upon your jaw
Hear it as I break you
You're going down
This time's the last time
You'll see my face
I'm at your back and I'm on my way

You want a piece of me tonight
You've got it

Come get a piece of me tonight...
