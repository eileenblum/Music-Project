Where is he going out tonight? Is he coming home?
A little boy two steps under the neon lights
Don't bother telling anyone, hit the bottle and run, he said
A part of you is missing and it's something I never had

A part of you is still a part of me
Only tragedy loves company
A part of you is still a part of me
Only tragedy loves company
Tragedy loves company

He needed someone to be his friend, he's lost alone again
And times can never change the way he feels
Don't you know that he's been victimized and has alone realized
The end is only the beginning of another bitter end

A part of you is still a part of me
Only tragedy loves company
A part of you is still a part of me
Only tragedy loves company
Tragedy loves company

A part of you is still a part of me
Only tragedy loves company
A part of you is still a part of me
Only tragedy loves company
Tragedy loves company
