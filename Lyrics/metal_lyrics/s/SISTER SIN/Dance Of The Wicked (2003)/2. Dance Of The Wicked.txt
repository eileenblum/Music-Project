I hear the sound, it's like salvation
To the music I am bound
I'm gonna stomp all over the nation
Cause I like to prowl and mess around

I'm so alive and kicking
Burn my fuse and dance with the wicked

(Burn my fuse) dance of the wicked
(Turn me loose) dance of the wicked
(Burn my fuse) dance of the wicked
(Turn me loose) dance of the wicked

I like the beat, it's my temptation
It makes me move in the streets
If it ain't got the groove, it's masturbation
I'll make you crawl down on your knees

I'm so alive and kicking
Turn me up and dance with the wicked

(Burn my fuse) dance of the wicked
(Turn me loose) dance of the wicked
(Burn my fuse) dance of the wicked
(Turn me loose) dance of the wicked

(Burn my fuse) dance of the wicked
(Turn me loose) dance of the wicked
(Burn my fuse) dance of the wicked
(Turn me loose) dance of the wicked

Dance, dance, dance of the wicked
I'll dance for you
So dance, dance for the wicked
Dance of the wicked
