So I may be a dreamer
But I've realized you're true
In a cold hell, I'm lost without you

Time to learn how to live
It's time to learn how to die
Love is sacred, but it's never black and white

I've got to hide my love away
Every time you go
I will do anything for you
For you to stay

You're falling into my dreams, yeah-yeah
You're falling into my dreams, may I sleep forever
You're falling into my dreams, into my dreams
You're falling into my dreams, may I sleep forever

It's purification
To look into those eyes
It's either destiny or the devil in disguise

Time to learn how to live
It's time to learn how to die
My truth of heart will never lie

I've got to hide my love away
Every time you go
I will do anything for you
For you to stay

You're falling into my dreams, yeah-yeah
You're falling into my dreams, may I sleep forever
You're falling into my dreams, into my dreams
You're falling into my dreams, let me sleep forever, ever and ever

May I sleep forever, yeah-yeah
You're falling into my dreams, into my dreams
You're falling into my dreams, let me sleep forever
You're falling into my dreams
You're falling into my dreams, my dreams, my dreams
You're falling into my dreams, yeah
You're falling into my dreams
