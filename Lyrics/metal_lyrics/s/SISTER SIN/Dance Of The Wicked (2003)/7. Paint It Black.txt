I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby, it just happens every day

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I want to paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black
Yeah, I want to paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee these things happening to you
If I look hard enough into the settin sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see a red door and I want it painted black

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I want to paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black
Yeah, I want to paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black
Yeah, I want to paint it, paint it, paint it, paint it black
