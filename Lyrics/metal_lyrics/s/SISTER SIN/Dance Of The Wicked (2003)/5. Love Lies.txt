Standing out in the rain
When broken heart love's in vain
Hear them cry out in the silent shame
All alone in the night
With the broken dreams as price
Love offers no delight

I'm on the run to hide away

Love lies
All our dreams gone by
Everything has to die
Love lies

Love lies
All our dreams gone by
Everything has to die
Love lies

You're feeling lost on your way
With a constant voice in your head
Saying I'd be better left for dead
Living life on the edge
Though it's the only road you choose
When you've got nothing to lose

I'm on the run to hide away

Love lies
All our dreams gone by
Everything has to die
Love lies

Love lies
All our dreams gone by
Everything has to die
Love lies

Love lies
All our dreams gone by
Everything has to die
Love lies

Love lies
All our dreams gone by
Everything has to die
Love lies

Love lies
Love lies
Love lies

Everything has to die
