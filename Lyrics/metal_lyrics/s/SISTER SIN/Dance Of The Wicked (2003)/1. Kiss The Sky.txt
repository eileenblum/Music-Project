It's violation against vitality
An accusation you don't wanna see
You oughta know
You oughta know

Every day got its own hero
Got its own king
And for those who speaks, knows nothing
Knows nothing

It's such a crime, a critical slime
Must be a thrill in the way you kill
I can't deny you're the reason why
I can kiss the sky
I can kiss the sky

Put up a fight and then you turn me in
Ain't satisfied until everything is gone
Got to keep on
Keep on going on

Every day got its own hero
Got its own king
And for those who speaks, knows nothing
Knows nothing

It's such a crime, a critical slime
Must be a thrill in the way you kill
I can't deny you're the reason why
I can kiss the sky

It's such a crime, a critical slime
Must be a thrill in the way you kill
I can't deny you're the reason why
I can kiss the sky
I can kiss the sky
I can kiss the sky
I can kiss the sky
