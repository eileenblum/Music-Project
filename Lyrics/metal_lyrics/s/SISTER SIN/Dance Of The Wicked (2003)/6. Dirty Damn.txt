Yeah!

Fill me with your pleasure, fill me with your pain
I'm in total control, I've got no shame
I'll be your second-hand dealer, my vamperilla of sleaze
Pull me up and roll me over, I'll give you double disease

Lock me up, throw away the key
Do all the things that's best for me in reply

Dirty damn I
Dirty damn I
Dirty damn I
Dirty damn I

Won't you come a little closer? I see the world in your eyes
I'll be a real smooth dancer, up and down your thighs
Like a shock to the system, I'll make you run
For the bullet in your barrel and the sound of my gun

Lock me up, throw away the key
Do all the things that's best for me in reply

Dirty damn I
Dirty damn I
Dirty damn I
Dirty damn I
Dirty damn I

Before I'll take you down that's where you will be
Down, down
So come along with me to my side of town
Down, down

Lock me up, throw away the key
Do all the things that's best for me in reply

Dirty damn I
Dirty damn I
Dirty damn I
Dirty damn I
Dirty damn I

Dirty damn I
