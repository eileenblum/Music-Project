Drink up, smash the glass
Old-school blastin' vynil tracks
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass and get out
Hey you, what's hot and new?
Never cared, won't ever do
Sold this soul a long, long time ago to rock and...

Ten years down the line, would change my ways
Lookin' back and say "Could have had kids, could have been rich
Regret the choice I've made"
Not too likely my friend, I'd say the same

Here we go, never to retreat or surrender
Have no hope, against the grain, now and forever
Where the wind blows, will you sail with tomorrow?
Stand your ground, so tell me, are you in it for life?

Where's that coke and rhum?
Strandh's passed out in the morning sun
It's 9 AM and the party's just begun
Now gimme a new town and city lines
Sore throat and bloodshot eyes
Wrong turns, but we've made it just in time

Oh, let this 10 years down the road, would change my ways
Lookin' back and say "Could have had kids, could have been rich
Regret the choice I've made"
Not too likely my friend and I'll tell you again

Here we go, never to retreat or surrender
Have no hope, against the grain, now and forever
Where the wind blows, will you sail with tomorrow?
Stand your ground, so tell me, are you in it for life?

[Solo]

Drink up, smash the glass
[?] vynil tracks
If you don't like it, kiss my ass
What's that? Hot and new
I don't cared, well, I never do
Sold this soul to rock and roll

Here we go

Here we go, never to retreat or surrender
Have no hope, against the grain, now and forever
Where the wind blows, will you sail with tomorrow?
Stand your ground, so are you in it for life?
Here we go, never to retreat or surrender
Have no hope, against the grain, now and forever
Where the wind blows, will you sail with tomorrow?
Stand your ground, so tell me, are you in it for life?
