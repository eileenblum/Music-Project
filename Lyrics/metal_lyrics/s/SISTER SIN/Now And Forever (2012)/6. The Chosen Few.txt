Give it up now for the chosen few!

Fed lies of this better future, where bullshit rules and they want us all to believe
All I see are consumption prayers, blood red greed... and now they're coming for me!
Dead eyes on the faceless faces, numb minds worship God on the TV screen
Fast cars waving fashion banners, livin' the dream from in a magazine!

You want to be just like me? Strive with the rest, and you'll see...
Stand up and spend your pay -- we want to hear you say:

"Give it up now for The Chosen Few! Money for nothing and nothing like you! The jetset wannabes keeping it true... now and forever -- the chosen few?

Give it up now for The Chosen Few! Rising above 'who the fuck are you?'. Running the world and your mindsets too -- unfakeable, unbreakable, The Chosen Few!"

Fake smiles on the N.Y. Catwalks, Daddy's little girl got the world right under her feet
Flashing lights on the tinted windows... a murder/rape scene or just another O.D.?

I do know I don't wanna know -- now who's wearing what, who's fucking who?
But does it leave you wanting to draining your mind for a privileged way of life?

You want to be just like me? Join with the rest and you will see...
