Can't stop thinking, feeling cold, kicking and bleeding
My mind's racing and it won't give room for peace
I lie dead awake counting cracks on this bedroom ceiling
Taunting tick, tick, will these thoughts ever leave it be?

I guess I've been waiting for some time
Oh, for something to separate this body and mind

Keep on running without fuel, still it goes for miles
Keep on shutting out, but the scream's too loud
Trip the wire just too soon and I'd go for the gold
In all time running low
Keep on reaching for the dark then they take it away
The clock's ticking on, but time stays the same
Raised the bar just too high and now I go for the gold
In my all time running low

Can't stop drinking, looking out at the city's skyline
The drugs stopped working ever since you reappeared
I stay wide awake, twist and turn from the out to inside
It's 4:49 and the sunrise getting near

I guess I've been waiting for some time
Oh, for something to separate this body and mind

Keep on running without fuel, still it goes for miles
Keep on shutting out, but the scream's too loud
Trip the wire just too soon and I'd go for the gold
In all time running low
Keep on reaching for the dark then they take it away
The clock's ticking on, but time stays the same
Raised the bar just too high and now I go for the gold
My all time running low

Keep on running without fuel
Keep on shutting out, but the scream's too loud
Trip the wire just too soon and I'd go for the gold
In all time running low
Keep on reaching for the dark then they take it away
The clock's ticking on, but time stays the same
Raised the bar just too high and now I go for the gold
In my all time running low

Goes for miles
Scream's too loud
Go for gold
In my all time running low
