Fuck you! Fuck them and fuck the world too.
Do I look like some bitch to you?!
Ill bet a blackened eye that you'll remember my name.
Well shorty step back and get out of my face and my way!
You turn my hard heart cold, stealing what we got and call it "Rock and Roll".
I'll bet our 2 counts an hour and all the hurt In the world that you all will burn.

This Is the Fight Song.
Don't point your finger at me!
Pray for that God forgives. I Dont!
This Is the Fight Song no matter who or where your from.
Pray that God forgives... I Dont!

Listen You make this bad blood rise.Hand me some rope
'cause I'll be hanging around hearing blacktounge bitchen'
for hours on end. C'mon give it a break and drop fucking...!
Now lets keep it honest In here I don't know you so you
sure don't know me. So keep my name out of your mouth
and we can keep it the same just like the doctor said.

This Is the Fight Song.
Don't point your finger at me!
Pray for that God forgives. I Dont!
This Is the Fight Song no matter who or where your from.
Pray that God forgives... I Dont!

This Is the Fight Song.
Don't point your finger at me!
Pray for that God forgives. I Dont!
This Is the Fight Song no matter who or where your from.
