Let's head for hell tonight, you and I
No shackles in here can hold us down
We'll ride free
We wait patiently
Break the walls, smoking gun
Across the border unchained, unbound
We ride free
We kill instantly

Ash to ash, dust to lust
Through other's blood, we'll never rust
Forevermore as our love will sore

We are the darkest angels from the heavens above
The outlaws coming from the fires below
And we won't die old, blessed by our broken homes
Shotgun romance, all natural born
Show no mercy, slay them all
One kill, two souls, oh, our hearts of cold
Hearts of cold

Scar this town, crown the crime
Baby, we'll make headnews tonight
We're set free
We run famously
Through endless miles, dusk 'til dawn
It might end today, but we made it far
When we leave
We won't leave here peacefully

Ash to ash, dust to lust
Through other's blood, we'll never rust
Forevermore as our love will sore

We are the darkest angels from the heavens above
The outlaws coming from the fires below
And we won't die old, blessed by our broken homes
Shotgun romance, all natural born
Show no mercy, slay them all
One kill, two souls, oh, our hearts of cold
Hearts of cold

Slay them all
Cold

[Solo]

The darkest angels from the heavens above
The outlaws coming from the fires below
And we won't die old, blessed by our broken homes
Shotgun romance, all natural born
Show no mercy, slay them all
One kill, two souls, oh, our hearts of cold
Hearts of cold
Cold
