"The next step for mankind will be the last season in sin"

I am the plague incoming
End of the line
I see the world uncoming
Vanished in the blink of an eye

You speak of warnings
Dead words on repeat
Here now -- gone tomorrow
Is it getting harder to breathe?

As it shall all come to pass
Rivers running dry
And the earth scorched into ash

Eternity might not be and I
I don't mind if the cities all fall
And the worlds will collide
I'd put the fuel to the fire tonight
That's right
No sorry
I can't wait
Hoping for a judgement day

Divide and break-outs to theories of fear.
I don't wanna live forever
Anyways but hey that's just me
Our days be numbered
And I'll heed that call
Here now -- dead tomorrow
So does it really matter at all?

As it shall all come to pass
Oceans subside under heavens hung in black

Eternity might not be and I
I don't mind
If the cities all fall
And the worlds will collide
I'd put the fuel to the fire tonight
That's right
No sorry
I can't wait
Hoping for a judgement day

I, I don't mind
If the cities all fall
And the worlds will collide
I'd put the fuel to the fire tonight
That's right
No sorry
I can't wait
Hoping for a judgement day, judgement day

End of the line
End of the line tonight
And I don't mind
