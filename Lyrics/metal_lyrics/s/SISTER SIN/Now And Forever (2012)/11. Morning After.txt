Don't hold any sorrow, don't shed tears
I'll be gone tomorrow, I will be damned

No, no, no, there's nothing to be sad about
It's just a way the weak get out
I hope you read this letter

This is the morning after
All of the pain is dead and gone
This is the morning after
I hope your feelings numb

All my life's been borrowed, never cared
I'll bare the cross tomorrow, to hell, I swear

No, no, no, there's nothing to be sad about
It's just a way the weak get out
I hope you read this letter

This is the morning after
All of the pain is dead and gone
This is the morning after
I hope your feelings numb
This is the morning after
All of the pain is dead and gone
This is the morning after
I hope your feelings numb

No, no, no, there's nothing to be sad about
It's just a way the weak get out
I hope you read this letter

This is the morning after
All of the pain is dead and gone
This is the morning after
I hope your feelings numb
This is the morning after
All of the pain is dead and gone
This is the morning after
I hope your feelings numb
