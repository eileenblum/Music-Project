Beg please, makes my heart race faster
The thrill of watchin' them try
I love wine, but your friend looks better
And red stains, stains well on white

This ain't no love song
Don't raise them expectations
You just flesh and bones, boy
Tonight means for destination
So let me brand you good

Bleed, bleed 'em dry
Take what I want when I want it and how
My girls all know what I'm talkin' about
Hang, hang 'em high
You can beg, plead, foam at the mouth
No quarter here hun, queen of ice

My, my, who's a real smooth talker
And don't know where to start?
Good dog, can you fetch me another?
Close, but it ain't, it ain't no cigar

This ain't no love song
Don't raise them expectations
I'm not yours alone, boy
Lesson learned in humiliation
So are you housebroken too?

Bleed, bleed 'em dry
Take what I want when I want it and how
Now who said that boys don't cry?
Hang, hang 'em high
You can beg, plead, foam at the mouth
No quarter here hun, queen of ice, ice

[Solo]

Wanna feel it, wanna steal it, wanna share my fun
Gotta heat it, really mean it, not the only one
Wanna feel it, wanna steal it, wanna share my fun
Gotta see it, really mean it, you're not the only one
No, no, baby

Bleed, bleed 'em dry
Take what I want when I want it and how
Three strikes and you're all out
Hang, hang 'em high
You can beg, plead, foam at the mouth
No quarter here hun, queen of ice

Hang 'em, hang 'em high
Hang 'em, hang 'em high
Hang 'em, hang 'em high
Hang 'em high
Queen of ice
