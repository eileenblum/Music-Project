You, you lack of devotion
Goddamn right, I fucking do and it bothers you to know
That I don't conform like supposed to
There's no path up in here that we all must follow

'Cause it's who we are, it's what I'm
And what they have is nothing that we'll ever need
Stand up proud to scream it out
We're nothing like you and you're nothing like me

Watch the walls descending down the shape of things to come undone
Long time comin', how it hurts to know realizing I'm not you?

The blind leading blind congregation
All slaves to the game indifferent in mass graves
That's what you're tryin' to sell me?
Slumber at its best, matching paintings by numbers

No, it's not what we are, not who I am
And what they have is nothing that we'll ever need
Stand up proud to scream it out
I'm nothing like you and you're nothing like me

Watch the walls descending down the shape of things to come undone
Long time comin', how it hurts to know realizing I'm not you?
I'm not you
I'm not you
I'm not you

Stand up proud
Stand up proud
Stand up proud
Scream it out

Watch the walls descending down the shape of things to come undone
Long time comin', how it hurts to know realizing I'm not you?
