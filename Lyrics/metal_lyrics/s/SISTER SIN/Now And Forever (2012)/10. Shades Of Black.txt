As emotions stripped to bone
And everything we held, I'll make it on my own, on my own
From the cradle to our grave
That's all we ever knew, but nothing stays the same

And I've seen you change
And I feel your pain, your pain, the pain

When all has been said and done
Will you miss me when I'm dust in the wind for the world to take another memory to fade?
I know we said it all and I know we made it far
Broke the chains and we shook this cage, still you're crawling back through shades of black

Shades of black
Don't lay that guilt on me
Shades of black
Shades of black
You have always been the weak

Now in rear view, life goes on
Caught in this dying past just tryin' to hold on
And I see you frail me, growing strong
Will you ever get what has been is dead and gone, gone, gone

When all has been said and done
I won't miss you when you're dust in the wind for the world to take another memory to fade
I know we said it all and I know we made it far
Broke the chains and we shook this cage, still you're crawling back through shades of black

Until the world cease movin' and I won't let you bring me down
No, I won't say I'm sorry for all your love rejected, dead cold and disconnected

Shades of black
Shades of black
Don't lay your guilt on me
Shades of black
Shades of black, black, black, black
You have always been too weak
