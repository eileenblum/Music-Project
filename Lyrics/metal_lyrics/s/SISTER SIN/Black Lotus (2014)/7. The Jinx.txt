Can you walk through fire and donât get burned?
Can you do hard time and donât get turned?
Could the sun out there wash your blues away?
Can you wear those chains for one more day?
Can you live in this world and keep the jinx away?

Hate in your bones, blood on your hands
Now you used to be such a righteous man
Itâs like the more that you try the faster you sink
And itÂ´s hard to smile when you never win, when you never win

Shakinâ the jinx

If IÂ´d say sorry would it make amends?
Or would it come right back to my face again?
You said that I failed to plan but did I plan to fail?
Doesnât really matter anyways because Iâm cursed that way, cursed IÂ´d say

Such a long way down
And I know that it will always be there to make sure that IÂ´ll fall to the ground
Shakinâ the jinx

Can you walk through fire and donât get burned?
Can you do hard time and donât get turned?
Could you wear these chains for just one day?

If I say Iâm sorry would it make amends?
Would you throw it back in my face again?
Never failed to plan but did I plan to fail
It wouldnât even matter anyways âcause Iâm cursed this way

Such a long way down
And I know you will always be there to make sure that IÂ´ll fall to the ground
Still shakinâ the jinx
