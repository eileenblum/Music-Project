In the witching hour
Comes a rider in blackâcold through and through
Enslaves by desire
Just like a drug, sheÂ´s consuming you slow

You canât love like you used to before
And you canât find trust in nothing else anymore
Those pale lips, the bourbon-soaked kiss
SheÂ´s the den of your sinsâthe slit of a wrist

âI was forged by fireâa daughter of the canyon lands
Hellâs spawn of liarsâraised by the dead in the sun-scorched desert sandâ
Heed the killer of hearts
Face the angel in black where the desert starts
Hear her ravenous tune
A call to the wild in the white light of the moon
Spawned out of the dark
Under blood-red skies below falling stars
Fall onto your knees
Surrender your soul to the crimson desert queen

Time stopsâturns to reverse
A thousand years passed, havenât you heard?
When a red moon rises over barren terrains
The black-backed jackal howls; calling her name

âFor I am the sinister savior-commander in his LuciferÂ´s reign
The new world creatorâhere to see to, blood will fall like rainâ

Heed the killer of hearts
Face the angel in black where the desert starts
Hear her ravenous tune
A call to the wild in the white light of the moon
Spawned out of the dark
Under blood-red skies below falling stars
Fall onto to your knees
Surrender your soul to the crimson desert queen

In the dead of the night
Under blood-red skies
Fall to your knees
Before the crimson desert queen
Heed the killer of hearts
