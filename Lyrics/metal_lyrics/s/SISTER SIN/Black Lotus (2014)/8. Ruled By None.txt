Hear it echo in the streets
Roaring from the underground
An unrelenting violent sound
Thirteen demons on a leash
Monitor the movement growth
Underneath and up above
Can you see it now?
Can you feel it now?
Scratching through your skull and bones, unto the heart and soul
WeÂ´re everywhere and all around, in the air canât hold it down
Whispers in the wind and screaming out from deep within

Forever and always at your side
Never to betray, deceit or lie
From this day forward are you with me now?
Rise to reclaim, Brothers
This is a call to arms
Stand!
Align by my side, Sisters
Wherever you are for whatever may come
Ruled by none

Outlaws ânâ sons, daughters alike
All the restless souls, rebel minds
Misfit kids and wretched ones
WeÂ´re everywhere, high and low to never change our hearts for show
Fueled by rage, defiance flowing through our veins
