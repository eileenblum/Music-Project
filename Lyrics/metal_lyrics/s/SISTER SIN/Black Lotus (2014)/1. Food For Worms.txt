I live my life by simple rules
Try to separate all the dirt from gold
Learned to tell whose friend or foe, when to rise above you know
Times change so IÂ´ve realized
ThereÂ´s scum out there of a different kind
YouÂ´ve got to know how to sort them out, gonna teach you how

First; theyâre worms, like ghosts they walk the earth
Donât ever show sympathy for they wonât show it to you
Remember; they feast, they thrive on prejudice and lies
Never on their own, never all alone
So take this advice
Keep your enemies closeâfire in the hole
And out came the wolves
Fire! (Burn in every lair!)
Let fire (fill the air!)
Keep your enemies closeâalways keep them close
And out came the wolves
Fire! (Torching every creep)
Why fire? (Â´Cause fireÂ´s fucking cheap!)

In new shapesâsubtle forms
Still the same shit âbout pride and war
The black caps back in â45 now replaced by suits and ties
Ignorance is bliss they say
And history tends to repeat its way
You got to know how to lure them out, Iâll show you how

First; theyâre worms, like ghosts they walk the earth
Donât ever show sympathy for they wonât show it to you
Remember; they feast, they thrive on prejudice and lies
Never on their own, never all alone
So take this advice
Keep your enemies closeâfire in the hole
And out came the wolves
Fire! (Burn in every lair!)
Let fire (fill the air!)
Keep your enemies closeâalways keep them close
And out came the wolves
Fire! (Torching every creep)
Why fire? (Â´Cause fireÂ´s fucking cheap!)
