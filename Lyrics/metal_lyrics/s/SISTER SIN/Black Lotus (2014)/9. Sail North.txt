Turn it up, gimme volume or blood
Make that bass sound pound through the walls
This is what we do where thereÂ´s nothing to do
In the country of rain and snow
Crank it up gimme volume and blood, câmon baby shake that ass
Hit it all again âcause we never grow old
This is what we do up in the cold
This is what we do where we come from
How we do it where we call home

Take a ride on the hellway to high
Where the moon shines bright and tears donât dry
Pay a visit to where silence is gold
Here no one ever speaks unless spoken to
Sail northâScandinavian bound
Sail northâto where only weekends count

Rev it up hun, give it some gas and push the pedal right down through the floor
This is what we do when the weekend get slow, this is how we roll
Rev it up, give it gasâgotta make that engine roar
Hit it again Â´cause it never gets old
This is how we roll up in the north
This is what we do it where we come from
How we do it where we call home

Take a ride on the hellway to high
Where the moon shines bright and tears donât dry
Pay a visit to where silence is gold
Here no one ever speaks unless spoken to
Sail northâScandinavian bound
Sail northâto where only weekends count
