Hear me out
Most of my time IÂ´ve spent thinking about
Like who I am what Iâm supposed to be
IÂ´ve tried it all; school and dead end jobs
But now I know that thereÂ´s a higher purpose for me

I will rule this whole universe
Assemble my own terror regime
IÂ´ll ban all laws and commercial T.V.
Start to sound pretty cool now you better well goddamn agree

Kill the king
Long live my tyranny
IÂ´ll give you anarchy, for all I give you anarchy
So kill the king and let the revolution sing
All shall obey or die and hail my chaos royale

Gonna build a giant killing machine
No one will dare to stand up or oppose
Enslave the earth with an iron fist
Now the whole world is my personal bitch

IÂ´ll put an end to all music that sucks
According to my flawless taste
No hipster shit, radio rock, bubblegum DJ pop
Heavy metal all of the way, make no fucking mistake

Thou shalt have no other Â´fore me
Or you wonât live to regret!
ThereÂ´s a choice of complete submission or certain death!
Kill the king and long live my tyranny
IÂ´ll give you anarchy, for all I give you anarchy
Kill the king and let the revolution sing
All shall obey or die
Have no fear Â´cause I will end democracy
I know what you need so no one dare to question me
Kill the king and let the new era begin
All shall submit or die and hail to the chaos royale

And thou shall have no other âfore me
âCause all the others are dead!
ThereÂ´s a choice of complete submission
Whatsoever ye shall bind on earthâye shall serve me till death

Kill the king
Long live my tyranny
IÂ´ll give you anarchy, for all I give you anarchy
Kill the king and let the revolution sing
All shall obey or die
Have no fear Â´cause I will end democracy
I know what you need so no one dare to question me
Kill the king and let the new era begin
All shall submit or die
Hail chaos royale!
