Deliver me your darkest hour
And let me tell you this; laughter donât deform this face no more
Nothing left here worth to savor
You know itÂ´d come to this, the time to leave you with

Scars from the past dear mother
Hope it hurts you to know I came out stronger

No headstone or cross, no prayers no god
A shallow grave is all there be to your memory
Make no mistake; IÂ´ll be better off this way
You never brought this bastard down
My will be done

Say again but donât come closer
Silence when you speak to me!
Seasons pass and IÂ´ve grown colder
Tables turn and cards play out, ainât it ironic how

How life came about dear mother
In the end itÂ´s just you, itÂ´s you whoÂ´ll suffer

No headstone or cross, no prayers no god
A shallow grave is all there be to your memory
Make no mistake; IÂ´ll be better off this way
You never brought this bastard down
My will be done

No pity or shame, forgiveness nor blame
Just history fading away
Spare me the lies, all the tears and your trials
Stones lay as thrown just like you would know

No headstone or cross, no prayers no god
A shallow grave is all there be to your memory
Make no mistake; IÂ´ll be better off this way
You never brought this bastard down
No pity and scars in my body and heart
No monument or sympathy to your memory
Make no mistake; Iâm well off and on my way
You never brought this bastard down
My will be done
