I donât want your number
I donât want your love
I donât feel what you feel

I donât need politics
Promises donât equal shit
I donât share your beliefs

And you

Donât speak to me about religion and faith
Your God ainât mine, I never asked to be saved

Itâs nothing personal, I hate it all; the fake concerns and vanity
Your superficial cause

Stay the fuck away from me
Out of sight and mind
Itâs all I ever asked of thee
Now weÂ´re way beyond a shadow of a doubt
So just count me out

I donât get your passion
Flash cash and shallow fashion
Canât relate to them needs

I donât expect support
Of any kind or any sort
I can fend for myself in this hell

For I

How could I rely on authority?
Whatever you do youÂ´ve done nothing for me

It ainât personal, I hate you all
When everythingÂ´s said and done, itÂ´s all I got

You better stay the fuck away from me
Out of sight and mind
Itâs all I ever asked of thee
Now weÂ´re way beyond a shadow of a doubt
So just count me out
