Welcome in to my world of darkness
Come on down watch the angels cry
Here I dwell in all grief and sadness
Hell is where my heart resides

Deep water rising, tidal waves unleashed
The roaring thunders here to chase away the summer breeze
ThereÂ´s no tomorrow, no innocence no more
Sign off with a syringe kissâAu revoir

Chemicals they speak inside my head
The day that I met you, you brought me death
No regretâsticks and stones
So longâIâm coming home
IÂ´m coming home

Welcome in to my world of darkness
Come on down watch the angels cry
Here I dwell in all grief and sadness
Hell is where my heart resides
Where my heart resides

Down on the highway, wrong side of the road
The good lord took his only child and Hell knows heÂ´ll be joining soon
âThereÂ´s no tomorrowâ he screamed inside the car
Took his foot from the brakes
Au revoirâUn deux tuez moi

The imagery is stuck inside my head
The day you left me here you left me dead
Brace for impactâhere I go
Hey sonâIâm coming home
IÂ´m coming home

Welcome in to my world of darkness
Come on down watch the angels cry
Here I dwell in all grief and sadness
Hell is where my heart resides
Where my heart resides

And I can see it in your eyes
What once was there has come to die
This is itâsay no more
Walk with meâIÂ´ll take you home
IÂ´ll take you home

Welcome in to my world of darkness
Come on down and watch the angels cry
Here thereÂ´s room for all grief and sadness
Hell is where my heart resides
Au revoir
