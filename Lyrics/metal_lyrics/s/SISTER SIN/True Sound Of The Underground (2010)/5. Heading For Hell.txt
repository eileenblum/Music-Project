One for the road this last call
Oh yeah and I ll bet you ll be divine
A fistful of self indulgence
But I ll make sure to quit in time
One slip off the wagon
2, 3, 4 and heading down, down, down
To the wrong side of a different day
Six hundred thousand miles away
Away.
Out of the light back to my lifelong love necessity
Down on the floor I bid farewell  Heading for Hell
Into the black towards the great escape from misery
With a toxic heart for the world to tell- Heading for Hell
So sick of being sick and tired
So tired being sick and craving more
Oh just wanna be alive and wired
Now kill the lights and shut that door
Spit it out and then some
I can't hear, you talking to me, me, me?
From the wrong side of a different day
Six hundred thousand miles away
Away.
Out of the light back to my lifelong love necessity
Down on the floor I bid farewell  Heading for Hell
Into the black towards the great escape from misery
With a toxic heart for the world to tell- Heading for
Hell
In a whiter shade of pale
-And wish me well, might not make it back
OK- six thousand miles away I bid farewell
Heading for hell
Out of the light
Into the black
Out of the light back to my lifelong love necessity
Down on the floor I bid farewell  Heading for Hell
Into the black towards the great escape from misery
With a toxic heart for the world to tell- Heading for Hell
Heading for hell, down on the floor take farewell
With a toxic heart for the world to tell
Down in my whiter shade of pale
