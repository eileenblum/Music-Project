Got these righteous mishaps pointing fingers left and right
And telling you what to do-no
Watch these fat cats hypocrites  white collar corporate hats
And when their winning you loose
Another lowlife victim fraud cover-up and bless your heart
Know if we read it it's true
And if economy's falling hard bleed em  dry and hide the scars
It's not their own they abuse
Oh, no
Whenever they re winning you loose
Where do you come from to judge and dictate what I need?
Think you re better than me?
So who are these bastards to rule and degrade in the end?
You know we re better than them!
Better than them, better than them
I am, I am
Better than them, better than them
I see these money stints, new found religious cults gaining ground
Preaching right from wrong
For that Great divine, break them down, separate and grind em  out
All the sinners from saints
To all those powersuites  white lies  and second coming of the Christ
I've got a message for you
Don t need your blind belief's, heresy and screwed up fucking strategy
Will not conform to your truth
Oh no
Whenever I ll win you ll loose
Where do you come from to judge and dictate what I need?
Think you re better than me?
So who are these bastards to rule and condemn in the end?
You know we re better than them!
Better than them, better than them
I am, I am
Better than them, better than
