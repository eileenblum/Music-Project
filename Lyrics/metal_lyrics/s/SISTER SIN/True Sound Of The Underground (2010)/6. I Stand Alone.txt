I, I need your heartbeats close to mine
And I, Just need to use you for awhile,
I like your design
Dry; dry the tears I ll never shed for you
And try, forgive the lies it's just what I do,
Is this getting through?
Won t ever be what you want me to
Can't offer no love
Least not the kind you re thinking of

Bound to no one
I feel for no one
Don't you know that inside this heart of stone
I stand alone
Can't you tell that I m bound to no one
And I take what I want
This time tomorrow I'll be gone, I stand alone

you, your shallow soul plead recognition
And you find it so easy to believe
I d never deceive
Reap; I reap the loneliness to reach you
And feed, straight from the heart and deep into
Is this getting through?
You know Ill never be what they want me to
Can't offer remorse
Least not the kind they re asking for
Bound to no one
I feel for no one
Don't you know that inside this heart of stone
I stand alone
Can't you tell that I m bound to no one
And I take what I want
This time tomorrow I ll be gone, I stand alone

Bound to no one, bound to no one
Feel for no one, feel for no one
Save your tears until I've cut and run, on to the next before the morning comes

Bound to no one
I feel for no one
Don t you know that inside this heart of stone
I stand alone
Can't you tell that I m bound to no one
And I take what I want
This time tomorrow I ll be gone, I stand alone

[Outro]
Bound to no one (bound to no one)
I feel for no one (feel for no one)
Don t you know that inside this heart of stone
I stand alone
Can't you tell that I m bound to no one
And I take what I want
This time tomorrow I ll be gone, I stand alone
