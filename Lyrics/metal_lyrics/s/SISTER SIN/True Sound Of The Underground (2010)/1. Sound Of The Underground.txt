You feel it coming and hear that roar
It's moving in right through the flesh down to the core
I've got that power and strength to reclaim
What is ours, forget the past, rewind/erase

Won't sit around  til the world goes by (no, no, no no)
Now it's our to claim so just step aside, you hear me?
Fuck the fashion and prove them wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You hear me!
Tear down the walls, shake the world and
Break them down give them hell yeah
One by one
We stand as one and Ruled by none
To the sound of the underground

Step it up kid, earn your crown
Open your eyes and break the trend, no compromise
They got their side, we've got ours
Let s tear it up, brick by brick and pound for pound

Won't sit around til  the world goes by, (no, no, no no)
It's our to claim so just step aside, you hear me?
Fuck the fashion and prove them wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You hear me!

Tear down the walls, shake the world and
Break them down give them hell yeah One by one
We stand as one and Ruled by none
To the sound of the underground

Tear down the walls.
Shake down the world paint it black and make it bleed
Show no mercy for the weak.
We stand as one and
Ruled by none
To the sound of the underground, underground, underground
Break them down!
