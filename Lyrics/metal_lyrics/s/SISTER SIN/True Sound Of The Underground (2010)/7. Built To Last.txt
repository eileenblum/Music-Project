C'mon
It's been six years standing strong
Cut some deadweight that didn't belong
Never bothered us all that much
Thrill of the fight can't ever get enough
Still broke and payin  the dues
Still hungry and got heart you know
Others bark but they got no bite
Above and beyond when I m right I m right
It don t matter how you beat this dog because
Made built to last, made built to last
Bad bones baby and a jawbreaker too don t mess with the ones who got nothing to lose
Made built to last, made built to last
As these wheels keep turning there ain't no coming back, Made built to last
May just be subtle as a flying brick
They can let us have it but I ll never stick
Been through worse in the blink of an eye
You're talking  is cheap and I ain't got all night
This road gives no second chance
Won t waste it on no love or romance
So fade out or retreat with class?
Nah, fuck all that shit
Made build to last
It don t matter how you beat these dogs because
Made built to last, made built to last
Bad bones baby and a jawbreaker too don t mess with the ones who got nothing to lose
Made built to last, made built to last
As these wheels keep turning there ain't no coming back, Made built to last
Running through the days on straight
Onto the highway's breaking hell to pay
Cutting corners never been my style
Right on the verge beats this heart o  mine
Been six years standing strong
At least ten more carved in stone
And with the devil standing close to our side
Fortune and fame will pave our way tonight, alright
This heart of mine
Made built to last, made built to last
Bad bones baby and a jawbreaker too don t mess with the ones who got nothing to lose
Made built to last, made built to last
Made built to, made built to last
