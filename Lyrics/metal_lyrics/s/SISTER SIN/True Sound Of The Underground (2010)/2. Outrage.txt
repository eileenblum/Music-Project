Cool calm and all collected?
Try hide that hate from here
Let go pass by unaffected?
For what reason you choose
To never expose
Resolute in denying emotions
It s there weather like it or not
Lash out hun make it atrocious
One shot!
Show for what you lack
Spill your guts now don t hold it back
C'mon bring it on and let me feel it
I want that teenage rampage, mayhem and outrage
C'mon scream it out til  I believe it
We need that front page outrage alright
Make it bleed between the lines
Cold... Cold calm and disconnected
Fine line between heaven and hell
Today determines tomorrow
Ya all get just what I say
We said
Let go give in to the moment
Lash out in a violent display
My time, your time to go when
Rise up
Show for what you got
Ready to burn then rip it out
C'mon bring it on and let me feel it
I want that teenage rampage, mayhem and outrage
C'mon scream it out til  I believe it
We need that front page outrage alright
Make it bleed between the lines
