Hey!
Whiplash/hammer-smash tonight.
I got to step it up and make em  hurt alright
hear it roar when i m off to war that s right.
Have these gloves laced up tight

Well!
I do black on black, back to back let's go.
When I bring it you will know.
Burn rush to blow.

You think you've seen it all but you ain't seen nothing yet

One round winner can't bring me down
Beat em down,
Beat em down
Won't stop swinging til they hit the ground,
Bring em down,
Bring em down
Knock out baby you're history so just leave it be and just let it bleed
Won t stop swinging til they hit the ground, Beat em down, Beat em down, Down!

I do black on black, back to back let s go.
I fight to win, never cave in or get slow.
Stick and move, olde 1, 2 and it's on, just one counterpunch and down for the count.

You think you've seen it all but you ain't seen nothing yet

One round winner can't bring me down
Beat em down,
Beat em down
Won't stop swinging til they hit the ground,
Bring em down,
Bring em down
Knock out baby you're history so just leave it be and just let it bleed
Won t stop swinging til they hit the ground,
Beat em down,
Beat em down,
Down!

By the ropes and getting faded
I got your game and its overrated

One round winner can't bring me down
Beat em down,
Beat em down
Won't stop swinging til they hit the ground,
Bring em down,
Bring em down
Knock out baby you're history so just leave it be and just let it bleed
Won't stop swinging til they hit the ground, try to beat me down, try to beat me down
