Heads up getting close and I can't shake this
So pure and I d like to taste it, embrace it
This basic thirst for
Violence, destruction, rage, defiance
Feel it's building up inside then controls when
This freak of me
Comes alive
Faint rush of blood kicks the grind to the teeth
Re-defined
And now it might just blow if ya hit that beat
Meet the devil I know, so cold, so cold and
When push comes to shove so cruel, so cruel man
No sense of control -- oh no, oh no when
Meet a devil I know, so cold, so cold
Clean kill and a shot to numb the senses
A quick drink to ease the sleepless, endless
All time famous
Silence, all these  talk too loud  surrounds when
I need my time alone damn, you fear when
This freak of me
Comes alive
Faint rush of blood kicks the grind to the teeth
Re-defined  And now it might just blow if ya hit that beat
Meet the devil I know, so cold, so cold and
When push comes to shove so cruel, so cruel man
No sense of control -- oh no, oh no when
Meet a devil I know, so cold, so cold
In the eye of the storm to the brink of the edge
From sides to side down to the end of the ledge
Meet the devil I know, so cold, so cold and
When push comes to shove so cruel, so cruel man
No sense of control -- oh no, oh no when
Meet a devil I know, so cold, so cold
