Been roaming the streets in the nightlights
Always scavenge the streets at night
Anxiety screams through the back of his head again
Need something that eases that hunger
Just need something to cure the pain
One last escape then I'm ready to live again
We walk the line reach out for the sky on needles and pins
It s hard to fight with a will to die then place all bets in
These times, these times aren t a changing, from street ends to anywhere
These lives, these lives aren t a waiting for a miracle to appear
Been searching for something to trust in
He keeps trying but always fails
All hatred burns through the back of his head again
I just need someone who sees me
And don t you think you're superior!
When safety s off will you show me respect my friend again and again?
We walk the line reach out for the sky see the reaper s grin
It s hard to fight with a will to die then place all bets in
These times, these times aren t a changing, from street ends to anywhere
These lives, these lives aren t a waiting for a miracle to appear
Not here!
These times, these times aren t a changing, from street ends to anywhere
These lives, these lives aren t a waiting no...(yeah)
These times, these times and these lives, these lives from street ends to anywhere
These times and these lives , stop preaching cause there ain't no miracle here
Nowhere
