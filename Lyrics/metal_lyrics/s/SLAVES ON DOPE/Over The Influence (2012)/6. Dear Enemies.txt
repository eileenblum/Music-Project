Take all the spite that youâre saving up for me/ And make some room, âcause you know youâre gonna need it/ no one to blame for your failed attempts at life/ so long you fucking hypocrites/ Get out! Get out! Right now, just get out!/ GET OUT!!!/ Convince yourself that the world is after you/ and wonder why all that glitters ainât gold/ hereâs some advice, you better listen up/ pack it in, âcause Iâm back in control/ you fucking sell outs, sell out, youâre done/ you sold out, sold out/ so long, so long, youâre done, you sold out! Sold out!/ Dear enemies, accept your defeat/ youâve got nothing to gain and even less to lose/ come clarity, revenge is sweet/ you might have started the war, but I will finish it/ each single move, it just seems s desperate/ put on a face that your friends will recognize/ sink to new lows, but it makes no difference/ I can see through you, you dirty parasite/ Get out! Get out! Right now, just get out!/ GET OUT!!!/ Itâs gonna get worse before it gets better/ just like a dog thatâs all bark and no bite/ so long, so long, youâre done, you sold out!/ Sold out!/ Dear enemies, accept your defeat/ you got nothing to gain and even less to lose/ come clarity, revenge is sweet/ you might have started the war, but I will finish itâ¦
