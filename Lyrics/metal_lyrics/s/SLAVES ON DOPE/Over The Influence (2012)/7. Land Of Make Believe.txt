I awake each day, destined for failure/ and I keep digging myself deeper and deeperâ¦ down/ youâre in the land of make believe/ thereâs none for you, itâs all for me/ your satisfactionâs guaranteed/ thereâs none for you itâs all for me/ Iâm still whoring myself/ the well is running / a prisoner of my past and sentenced to live it/ over and over againâ¦. / youâre in the land of make believe/ thereâs none for you, itâs all for me/ your satisfactions is guaranteed/ and if at first you donât succeed/ thereâs none for you, itâs all for me/ itâs such a tangled web you weave/ go feed your misery/ go bathe in agony/ youâre stripped of bravery
