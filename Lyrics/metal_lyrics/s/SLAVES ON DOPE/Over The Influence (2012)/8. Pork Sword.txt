Turn off the lights/ no oneâs around/ the TVâs on/ but thereâs no sound/ the stage is set/ a dressing gown/ the pig is greased/ and going down!!/ hereâs to the private celebration/ youâre the only one that ever knows/ you remove all your frustrations/ all hands on deck steady as she goes/ glorification, pulverization, exhilaration, / nothing compares to this/ the more I need it, the more I feel it/ appreciation, infatuation/ the more I feel it, the more I need it/ you start to sweat/ you pull it tight/ youâre short of breath/ it feels alright/ the punishment for you naughty girls/ your parting gift a string of pearls/ hereâs the private celebration/ youâre the only one that ever knows/ you removed all your frustrations/ all hands on deck, steady as she goes/ imagination, retaliation, evacuation/ nothing compares to this/ the more I need it the more I feel it/ manipulation, paralyzation/ the more I feel it, the more I need it/ the pretty disease/ youâre aiming to please/ now fall to your knees/ and swallow it, swallow it/ and choke on a high/ youâre lonely goodbye/ itâs leaving you dry/ no beg for it, beg for it/ the porno parade/ you dropped a grenade/ call in the brigade/ and let loose the cannon balls/ and starting to slip/ so tighten your grip/ and down goes the ship/ now swallow it
