The hill you have to climb is steep and high/ Itâs getting harder to see/ the ship is sinking and you cannot swim/ hands waving in the airâ¦/ end of the race/ red in the face/ cause you cannot keep up with the pace/ youâre a disgrace/ and despicable/ exhausted you collapse into the mud/ eyes burning from your tears/ you crawl your way back up to your feet/ only to fall backâ¦./ end of the race/ red in the face/ âcause you cannot keep up with the pace/ youâre a disgrace/ ad despicable/ vanity case/ youâve been replaced/ so you better learn how to embrace/ That lonely place, so predictable/ I donât think the audience would disagree/ you wouldnât be here without me/ you pound your chest like you just won the war/ the jokeâs on you/ but you think the jokeâs on me/ fighting an enemy thatâs invisible/ this ends the love affairâ¦.
