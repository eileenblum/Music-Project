We all need therapy, âcause God never seems to listen/ Open up the pharmacy, and youâll hear the angels crying/ I never sleep/ Sheâs lying on the plastic beach/ and itâs reflecting right at me/ I never sleep/ Burn the evidence/ I fill the void when Iâm fucking you/ locked in the white room with no view/ itâs irrelevant/ my life is quickly turning to/ a catch 22/ Iâve lost all self control/ thereâs no light in this hole/ it will destroy me, break me/ set me up to fail/ Iâm like a time bomb/ chemical, comatose, medical, overdose/ counting tiles on the ceiling/ forty-five or sixty-seven/ the telephoneâs always ringing/ this conversationâs going nowhere/ ahhhh insomniac/ burn the evidence/ I fill the void when Iâm fucking you/ locked in the white room with no view/ call the ambulance/ my life is quickly turning to / a catch 22!/Iâve lost all self control/ Thereâs no light in this hole/ it will destroy me, break me/ set me up to fail/ Iâm like a time bomb/ chemical, comatose, medical, overdose/ as my life seems to fade/ one second isnât a second at all/ ignore it but it never goes away
