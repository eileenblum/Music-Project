She came to Hollywood/ To be a big star/ now you can find her/ in the back of a car/ sheâs doing things she never thought she would do/ down on Melrose Avenue/ now was it good for you?/ no more auditions, sheâs taken the role/ she might deny it, sheâs lost all control/ another victim of the status quo/ try to put the fire out with gasoline/ sheâs such a libertine, sheâs only seventeen/ drown yourself in nothing but amphetamines/ another drama queen, here comes the guillotine/ sheâs growing tired / of all of their games/ all sheâs aspired/ has gone up in flames/ the meritocracy has become the norm/ sheâs all tattered and torn/ quiet before the storm/ locked in her bathroom/ doing lines in Bel Air/ morally bankrupt/ sheâs a millionaire/ thereâs no reflection from her vacant stare/ try to put the fire out with gasoline/ sheâs such a libertine, sheâs only seventeen/ drown yourself in nothing but amphetamines/ another drama queen, here comes the guillotine/ dearly departed/ taken so young/ it makes no difference to everyone
