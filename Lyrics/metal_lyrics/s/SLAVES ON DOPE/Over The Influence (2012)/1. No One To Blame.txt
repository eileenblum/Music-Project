Think fast/ knee jerk reaction/ five fingers turn into a fist/ and it slams over and over/ frustration just walked away/ youâre always ahead of the action/ process all the things you ignore/ step back, and begin dissention/ onto the killing floor/ immediately you will disagree/ either way, it makes no difference to me/ and youâve got one else to blame/ except yourself/ you put your hand into the flame and burnt yourself/ seek out and search for something/ but it keeps eluding you/ your past has got the answers/ and itâs hunting you down like a dog/ youâre always ahead of the action/ process all the things you ignore/ step back, and begin dissention/ onto the killing floor/ immediately you will disagree/ either way, it makes no difference to me and youâve got no one else to blame/ except yourself/ you put your hand into the flame and burnt yourself/ and then a crack in the sky opened up/ and all the innocence fell below
