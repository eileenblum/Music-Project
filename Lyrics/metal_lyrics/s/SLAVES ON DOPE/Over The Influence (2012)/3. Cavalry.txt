Back to the basics/ screwed on my head/ took a few years for myself/ couldnât care less what they said/ walked out on the dream to look over the edge/ as blood fell from the sky/ all illusions lied/ amuse the amazing/ two left but weâre still winning/ I didnât start the war/ I never asked for this/ you couldnât break me/ call the cavalry/ all your rivers run dry/ the fear of failure, I can see it in your eyes/ call the cavalry/ your revolution has died/ saved all my aces/ just for this hand/ takes a real man to admit/ when heâs buried in the sand/ Iâm fully awake and prepared to withstand/ all the negativity is removed from me/ questions with no reply/ itâs ironic but Iâm still satisfied
