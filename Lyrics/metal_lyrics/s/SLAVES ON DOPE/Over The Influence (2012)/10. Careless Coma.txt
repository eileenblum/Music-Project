I am not the man/ That I want to be/ But Iâm a better man/ Then I used to be/ On this battleground/ You will wear the crown/ This loves watered down/ got my answer/ lost the race before the start/ amusing/ put the cart before the horse/ confusing/ all along I knew it was wrong/ but it felt so fucking right/ but an arrow through your heart/ careless coma/ Iâm a loser itâs true/ but I lose for you/ and if you knew the truth, you would lose it to/ itâs a slippery slope/ with this loathsome rope/ Iâm just trying to cope with your distance/ lost the race before the start/ amusing/ put the cart before the horse/ confusing/ all along I knew it was wrong/ but it felt so fucking right/ but an arrow through your heart/ careless coma.
