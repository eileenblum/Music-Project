You were so, so special,
To all who ever knew you
Want to give you the honest answer
Want to tell you much I care,
Want to give you what you've given me
Why'd you have to go
You've left us all to go
And get the answers
I'm not going home right now,
I'm not going to watch you go,
I'm going home right now,
To find you broken
