I try to assure you
That I'm not disillusioned
And it's not where you are
But that doesn't change the
Way that I feel about the plan
I know you're talking to...
I can't be the hand that
Pushes them away
And you can't re-assure me
You don't know what to say
There's a lot I can't tell you
But I will do the best
I can, this all could change
And your tears turn to anger,
And you lash out at me,
'cause I'm far and I'm selfish
And you won't laugh and see that
This all could be simple if
We would catch our breath,
And remember the plan
I know your talking to all the
Ones who bring you down,
They wanna take from you
All the happiness you found
