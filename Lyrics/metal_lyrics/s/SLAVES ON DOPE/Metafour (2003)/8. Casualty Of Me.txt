When you go out and get wasted
It's a frightening time for me
Cause I've been in all those places
And I know you will deceive
Realize that I'm alone
And I'm doing what I can
You're an anchor that doesn't sit still
Though I try
I never seem
To keep the slate clean
Tell me what does it take to make
All the stories
Stop
Playing out in my head
I'm a casualty
A casualty of me
I've got too much time on my hands
To get away from this dream
Tell me what does it take
To escape all the boredom
I'll give away my foundation
Is it wrong to feel this way
Are the walls closing
Am I giving too much in
