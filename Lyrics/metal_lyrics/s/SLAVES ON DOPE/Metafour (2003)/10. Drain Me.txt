I never wanted the finer things
In life
They never meant much to me
I only wanted to be the best at what
I did,
And I am
You took all of my
Life from me and you
Drained me
I never wanted to argue, and I
Wish we never would have started
I only wanted for me what's fair
And should you care, if I dare
I only wanted for me what's fair
And for you to be there
