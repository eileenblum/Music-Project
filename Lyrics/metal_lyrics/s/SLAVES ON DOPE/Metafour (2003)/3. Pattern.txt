Couldn't sleep last night
The warning signs were flashing
They were so bright, they took over me
I got up to breath, but the fear
Stepped back and hit me
I tried not to
Scare easily when you explained
All the blackouts
There will be days when the
Pattern doesn't bother me
Couldn't sleep last night
It must have been the coffee,
I never should have drank
It after eight 
It always makes me see,
The truth that hides inside
Me 
It's out in the open
Couldn't sleep last night, 
And I probably won't tomorrow,
I tried not to...
