There's no sign of life in this hole I live in
The lights are on, but nobody's home
The only thing I love is this glass friend
I can't put him down (give him up)
But I'm trying, yes I'm trying...
To put it down (and keep it down)
Over over, I keep falling
I'll latch on to you, and you won't complain...at all
The only thing I have is my glass friend, I can't give him up
But I'm trying
To put it down (and keep it down)
Over over, I hear voices
But it's a waiting game,
And I feel the same
