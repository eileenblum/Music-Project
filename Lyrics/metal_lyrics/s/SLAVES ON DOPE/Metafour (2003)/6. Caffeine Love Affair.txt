I have always compromised
Buried me with all my lies
You belong to something else
That isn't tainted, or pre-mediated
Quiet! Don't tell anyone!
It's just our secret
But you'll never keep it
Stories started in my head
From those messed up things you said
They began to take control
Got the warning, it's all over
Chaos, caffeine love affair
Hurts too much, don't touch me there
I hate when you touch me there
Quiet don't tell them!
