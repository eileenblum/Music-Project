The simple things that I take for granted will
Get away from me eventually
I was smacked around
And beaten to the ground
My head became a piece
Of broken coal
I never thought that I
Would ever let you in
All I did was criticize
You
You were my only hero
You saved me from the sea
So, come take a bow
My hero
You brought me back
To me
Bitter words were said
I screamed them all myself
I pounded on your door
Ten times or more
You got under my skin
But I didn't let you in
I put up doors to let you out
