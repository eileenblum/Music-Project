We did it to you, you did it to us,
Sounds like a broken record
I pulled back the clouds,
So you could be free
Molested my frozen memory
You, you lied - it's in focus
And I'm keeping it that way
I realized when you were around,
You dragged us down
Entrusted a friend, to save us again
You pissed on the hand that fed you,
To think we were tight, no never again,
Will I let your kind betray me,
I pulled back the clouds, so you could
Be free, so you could be free
