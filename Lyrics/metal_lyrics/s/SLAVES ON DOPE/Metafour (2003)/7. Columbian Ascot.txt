This situation has begun, no turning back from 
From this point on
We've made a commitment to piss...
All over your memory
You can't begin to understand
How you will suffer at the hand
Of my Colombian hitman, up shit's creek
With no paddle
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
This is the family recipe, bad luck for you,
And you'll agree
That this is all because of your sticky fingers
Insert the knife below the neck
Make an incision ear to ear
Grab the tongue and pull in through
The slit you made with your knife
You lose, we win
What doesn't kill you makes you strong
You may be gone, but we live on
What doesn't kill you makes you strong
You make be gone, but we win!
