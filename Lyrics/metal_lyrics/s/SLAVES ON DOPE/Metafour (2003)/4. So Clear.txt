I looked at what
I thought you were 
Faking
And then I put up
The walls I'd been making
It's so clear, that pushing
You away,
Could be the only way
It's so clear
That all the mindless
Games, could only fan
The flames
I looked at what I
Thought you were saying
The distance is not the 
Cause,
It's in the wanting
Don't get to caught up
In what I'm saying
It's so clear
That all I need
Is right here
But I'm too blind to see it
And I should try to stay here, 
But I'm too scared to do it
I looked at what I want from you now.
