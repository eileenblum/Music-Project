He wants a minute or to feel
Like a real-life person
And all the people he knows don't
Play, they just keep rehearsing
A poster boy for everyone, who didn't
Have the guts to do it
A poster boy for everyone, 
But inside he thinks he'll lose it
He never says what he means,
They benefit from his dreams
He always knew he was better than
Them, but he never showed it
They made a fuss, and they fawned over him,
He just wanted balance
A poster boy for everyone who didn't have the guts to do it
