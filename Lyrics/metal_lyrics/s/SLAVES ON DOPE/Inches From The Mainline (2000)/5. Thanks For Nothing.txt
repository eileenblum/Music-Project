It's So Very Nice To Meet You
I'm A Big Fan Of Your Band's Album
Do You Think We Could Meet And Go For Coffee
So I Can Tell You All About My Plans For Stardom?
By The Way, How Did You Get Here?
And Tell Me Every Single Step
You Took While Coming Up
I'm Sure I'll Follow Them
As Long As I Can Still
Be The Person Who Still Has Both Feet
On The Ground

Chorus:
Your Band Is So Bad
So Thanks For Nothing
Fuck You, Fucker, Fall

I Hate You
I Could Give You A Map
Point To Where
You Need To Go
Tell You What To Avoid
And Who's The Best For You To Know
Even If I Spelled It Out
You Still Would'nt Say It right
They'll Back You Up
And Knock You Down
Get Up For The Next Fight

They're Coming For A Piece Of Your Heart
Stick It In Their Face
So They Can't Even Start
I Could Never Turn My Back On You
Cause I've Been In Your Shoes

You're The First To Say I Became A Dick
But You Know That's Not True
