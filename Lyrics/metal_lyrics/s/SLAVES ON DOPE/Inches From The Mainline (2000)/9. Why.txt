Start me up with something I could never give into
Sort me out with the hate machine
Your hands are tied
But you seem to be waving with both of them
Is this the way to manipulate
Procreate a test tube baby full of hate and fear
Walk forward while taking eleven steps back
Pull the foundation up from the cracks
Fool myself all day
Why?!

[Chorus:]
You can't afford, to be ignored (Why?!)
You're staring, too
Why? Oh why? Oh why? [x2]

Your hands are tied but you seem to be waving
Walk forward while taking eleven steps back
Pull the foundation up from the cracks
Start me up with something I can never get into
Fuck you for my life!
Why?!

[Chorus]

You're a piece of garbage,
I don't like your face,
'Cause you always do things,
Only to fuck up [x2]

I don't like you, you can't stay here
Why?!

[Chorus]

You're a piece of garbage,
I don't like your face,
'Cause you always do things,
Only try and fuck up

Fuck you for my life!
