The shot that took you out
Open wide
Put your foot in your mouth
It stole your secrecy
Lock the door
Throw away the key

Don't deny this
Know you want to try this
Take away your blindness
With your narrow-mindedness
Help me find that pot of gold
Lighten the load

Green eyes that satisfy
Carry the weight of the land to the sky
Meanwhile, they cry
I can't die

Took your breath away
Left you winded
With nothing to say
It's easy to proceed
When you're good
Faith is nothing but greed

Don't deny this
Know you want to try this
Take away your blindness
With your narrow-mindedness
Help me find that pot of gold
Lighten the load

Green eyes that satisfy
Carry the weight of the land to the sky
Meanwhile, they cry
I can't die

I can't die

The shot that took you out
(Open wide, put your foot in your mouth)
It stole your secrecy
(Lock the door, throw away the key)

Don't deny this
Know you want to try this
Take away your blindness
With your narrow-mindedness
Help me find that pot of gold
(Listen to me)

Green eyes that satisfy
Carry the weight of the land to the sky
Meanwhile, they cry
I can't die

Green eyes that satisfy
Carry the weight of the land to the sky
Meanwhile, they cry
Meanwhile, they cry

I can't die
