Give me a reason, I can take it
I'm pissed off now, but I can fake it
Making noise as I sweep the floor
You tweak up, Boom, it's stronger than the door
You're slaping my face
Treat my like the neighbourhood disgrace
Got the juice, now tell me how's it's taste
Just savor it for now

You say you wanted this in your life
But now you're eager to disconnect

Say, say what you want to
Say, say what you want to
Say, say what you want, choose a four letter word [x2]

Give me a reason, I can take it
I'm pissed off now, but I can fake it
Dropping bombs as you hit the floor
You tweak up, Boom, it's stronger than the door
You're slamming in my face
You're freaking out
A total fuck without the taste
No trace, erase, disagree

You say you wanted this in your life
But now you're eager to disconnect
I put you in the frame on my table
But now your mouth is wide open, why don't you

Say, say what you want to
Say, say what you want to
Say, say what you want, choose a four letter word [x3]

Say what you want, it's a four letter word

"BREAK"

You're a fuckin' bitch

LOVE!!!
I feel the time to take you now is
I feel the place to make a mark is here
I see you still with your eyes so low
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!

Bitch slap, bitch slap, bitch slap, bitch slap

"Excuse me, do I have fuck me written on my forehead?"

Say, say what you want to
Say, say what you want to
Say, say what you want, choose a four letter word [x3]
SAY!

Bitch slap, bitch slap, bitch slap, bitch slap
