Life, is what you make it
Don't, you try to fake it
Truth, is not the answer
The closer you get
They'll keep you guessing
Don't care if you're stressing
A box of nothing
Now go be great

Why is the attraction
Only worth a fraction
I've been getting fucked since
I picked up the mic
When will the illusion
Start to feed my family?!
A one way ticket
To minimum wage

You wanna be
What you wanna be
You're rocking...hardly
(Don't tell me)
You only see
What I let you see
I'm feeling, sorry [x2]

You try and try
And try to clarify
Objectify yourself [x2]

Don't tell me
How to live my life [x4]

You wanna be
What you wanna be
You're rocking...hardly
(Don't tell me)
You only see
What I let you see
I'm feeling, sorry

Don't tell me
How to live my life [x10]
