Reach Back Into Your Mind
And Grab What You Left Inside [x2]

You're Pushing Me
And I'm Gonna Push Back
Pushing Me
Set To Attack [x2]

Reach Up And Touch The Sky
This Time You're Asking Why
You Tried To Achieve It
I Could Not Believe It
I Left It In Your Hands
And You Dropped The Ball

You're Pushing Me
And I'm Gonna Push Back
Pushing Me
Set To Attack [x2]

Reach And Grab What You Want
Do You Want To Feel
Someting That's Harder
Than Your Fucking Soul
Push, Go Far
Grab What Is Left Inside
That's Cool
That's Who You Are
And I Don't
Want To Believe

You're Pushing Me
And I'm Gonna Push Back
Pushing Me
Set To Attack [x2]

You're Pushing Me
And I Can't Push You Back [until end]
