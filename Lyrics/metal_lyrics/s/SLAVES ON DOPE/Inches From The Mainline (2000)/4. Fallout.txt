Shut Up, Shut Up, I Hear What You're Saying
I Know Exactly Where You've Been Kind
Don't Think That I Take All This For Granted
And I Fucking Whine!

Look Up And See The Obstacles In Front Of Me
I Jump Over These Everyday
Wake Up And Try To Come To Your Senses

I Know I'm Calling To Ask For Money
Things Aren't The Way I Want Them To Be

Just Like The Last Time
This Is The Last Time
Just You Wait And See
You Won't Believe The People Im Meeting
They're The Ones You See On TV

Sooner Or Later
You'll Get The Picture
I Can Really Be

All Of My Pride Is Melting
For All To See
Fallout Is More Than Likely
Please Come To Me

You Won't Believe The People Im Meeting
They're The Ones You See On T.V

Sooner Or Later
You'll Get The Picture
I Can Really Be

Shut Up, Shut Up, I Hear What You're Saying
I Know Exactly Where You've Been Kind
Don't Think That I Take All This For Granted
And I Fucking Whine!

All Of My Pride Is Melting
For All To See
Fallout Is More Than Likely
Please Come To Me

If I Scream Out Loud
Will The Sound Of My Voice
Become Even Louder Than That C.B In Your Eardrum?
Every Person In The World
Wants A Fair Shot
I Just Went And Got Mine

I Know I'm Calling To Ask For Money
Things Aren't The Way I Want Them To Be

Just Like The Last Time
This Is The Last Time
Just You Wait And See
Look Up And See The Obstacles In Front Of Me
I Jump Over These Everyday
Stand And Try To Come To Your Senses

All Of My Pride Is Melting
For All To See
Fallout Is More Than Likely
Please Come To Me
