Now, all I feel is nothing but pain,
You've sorted out, most everything I've gained
But in the wake of it all
I see your face smiling back at me
I won't forget you
I can't - (forget you) forget (forget you)
You!
You!

Grow!
Just see what it takes to
Grow
Step up to the plate to
Throw
Just see what it takes to

I've become a kafka bug
Dropping my hardcore shit like rat crap
We're in the drivers seat now
(I see you driving down that stretch)
and every time I see your face
I see a bottle stuck in it
Man, you're just like me
You're just
Like
Me!
Me!

Grow!
Just see what it takes to
Grow
Step up to the plate to
Throw
Just see what it takes to

I can't stand
by your side [x4]
Kaf - Ka...
