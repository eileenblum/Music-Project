I remember all the times that you stared at me
And you told me I was something to be proud of
Took a walk to the corner store in 85'
And again in 86'
In 87' i got high for the first time
88' it was my favorite pass time
89' I was inches from the mainline
On divine I'm doin' fine

This beast doesn't let me go!
It's makin' me!
(feel so strong)
I'm trying to re-create insanity!
(feel so strong)

Put myself in a program of recovery
Saw another side of life that was beautiful
It allowed to incorporate a way of life
That was meaningful to you
But you can never let go of the past
Sometimes the winner is really dead last
I know I'm clean
But my mind is so filthy, so filthy
So beautiful!

This beast doesn't let me go!
It's makin' me!
(feel so strong)
I'm trying to re-create insanity!
(feel so strong)

Don't rush me!
I'm fragile!
I wont bark
But I'll bite back, and I'll attack!

Do you belong?

This beast doesn't let me go!
It's makin' me!
(feel so strong)
I'm trying to re-create insanity!
(feel so strong)

I've been trying to get over
Being god but it's jus too much fun
To control
