Locked in your cell
You think that you would have learned
All that time to think about it
Still, you mix that vodka with the cranberry

Bring back the past cause
The past is not broken [x3]

Say what you want say its not fair
You lie to the world
To live with yourself
Say what you want say its not fair
You try to reform
But the storms still inside

You make me wonder what you're like high
Cause face to face
You seem like a gentleman
The grass is green right where you're standing

Bring back the past cause
The past is not broken [x3]

Say what you want say its not fair
You lie to the world
To live with yourself
Say what you want say its not fair
You try to reform
But the storms still inside

Say what you want say its not fair
You lie to the world
To live with yourself

Something that you wanted to climb
Anything you see can be
A spot-on illusion
You're sick with confusion
I try to deceive you
But it doesn't reach you

To the world
To live with yourself
Say what you want say its not fair
You try to reform
But the storms still inside
Say what you want say its not fair
You lie to the world
To live with yourself
