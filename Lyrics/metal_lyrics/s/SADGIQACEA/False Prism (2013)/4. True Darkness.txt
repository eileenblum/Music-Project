The vermin is disguised
It feeds off anxious minds
You fall to your knees
in sight of thou

Evil in man is fear
The haunted spectrum
The lesser known

Guard their honor with your guns
Beseech it
Worship your obedience
Property
Hypnotized
Illusion of resolve

Swaddled in
it's warm dark folds
A blind of mirrors
Falling prey to its lure
Try to break from its coil

It numbs

Shape shifter
Life ripper
Doom dealer

Shaping your being: disarray
Hope of souvereignty fades
Complacently replaced

The faceless villain prevails and permeats

Death of idea
Death of self
Termination of striving
Submit to false comfort
