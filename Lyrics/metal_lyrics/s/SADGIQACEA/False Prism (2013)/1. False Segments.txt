Amalgamate of praise
Bestow me war-torn
Ye bear a torgid writhe
Emancipation

Envelop me
From my head to your toes
Brimming with tears
And aching for me to let go

Running rampant
Upon your globe
Constant etnrancement
A call ignored

I'm blessed beyond belief
I've not your god to thank
Oh harrowed life
I seduce myself
Extinguish fires
Of holy grain
And with this force
Encompass pain

Amalgamate

Oh soul of my lament
Bury me with fervor
