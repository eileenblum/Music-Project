Seeing through wolves' eyes
We all carry
Designated restrictions
We are weighted down

Let the roots pull you under
Let the roots pull you down
Let the dirt sink beneath you
Dissolve into earth

So you're seeing the reversal sights
Ones they told you that were wrong
But the difference from the wrong and the right
Is no longer etched in stone
It's all a distraction
An endless black hole
You let yourself cave in
And suck out your soul
Your values are worthless
You've been so naÃ¯ve
Another prisoner of the eye
And the power that it keeps
