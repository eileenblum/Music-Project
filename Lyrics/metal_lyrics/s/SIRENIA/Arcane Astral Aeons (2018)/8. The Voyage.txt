I'm headed downstream
Lost in a dream
Along with the current I flow
I'm passing through time
Bound for decline
I'm in for whatever may come

Fade into the night
Fall apart inside
Can't find no light
I have lost my way
I was led astray
On the twelfth day
Onwards and on, and on, here I go
You left me behind where only God knows

Still headed downstream
It's time to give in
All voyages come to an end
If you caught my eye
The day that I died
What would you might then comprehend?

Fade into the night
Fall apart inside
Can't find no light
I have lost my way
I was led astray
On the twelfth day
Onwards and on, and on, here I go
You left me behind where only God knows

Fade into the night
Fall apart inside
Can't find no light
I have lost my way
I was led astray
On the twelfth day
Onwards and on, and on, here I go
You left me behind where only God knows
