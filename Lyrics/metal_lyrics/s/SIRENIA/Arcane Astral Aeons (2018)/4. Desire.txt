Your desire takes me higher
Love the way that you light me on fire
So appealing, pure and deceiving
There's no way to resist you, believe me

You come to me light as the breeze
You're taking the lead in this dance of primary needs
Of instincts and dreams
Your senses all on fire, burning bright as the sun

Your desire takes me higher
Love the way that you light me on fire
So appealing, pure and deceiving
There's no way to resist you, believe me

When you look my way I ignite
You're catching my eye
The depth of your eyes draws me in
To thrills and to sin
My senses all on fire, burning bright as the sun

Your desire takes me higher
Love the way that you light me on fire
So appealing, pure and deceiving
There's no way to resist you, believe me

J'aime la douce ivresse de ta subtile Ã©treinte, O mon amour
Quand ton regard de braise s'embrase
Et se perd lorsque ma main te touche
Vois avec quelle adresse j'abandonne sans
Crainte et sans dÃ©tour toute vaine rÃ©sistance
Ce pour qu'enfin je goute au baiser de ta bouche

My desire
Takes my higher
High and wired
I'm on fire

My desire
Takes my higher
High and wired
I'm on fire

Your desire takes me higher
Love the way that you light me on fire
So appealing, pure and deceiving
There's no way to resist you, believe me

My own desire
Takes my higher
Love the way that you light me on fire
So appealing, pure and deceiving
There's no way to resist you, believe me
