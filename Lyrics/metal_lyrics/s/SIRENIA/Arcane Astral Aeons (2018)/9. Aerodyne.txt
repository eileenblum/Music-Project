Head towards the stars
Towards a galaxy afar
Circle in a plane
Light years away
I'm passing by the moon
Somewhere around mid-afternoon
Won't be back anytime soon

Livewire, on fire
I can't get any higher
Towards the sun
I'm too far gone

Hands upon the wheel
Forward on at sonic speed
I can't slow down
Nobody taught me how
Passing by the sun
Like a bullet shot from a gun
There's no way I'll be outrun
There's no way

Livewire, on fire
I can't get any higher
Towards the sun
I'm too far gone

The desert sun aflame
I ride that horse
Without a name
Every day seems all the same
My soul's on fire
How can I ever
Get any higher
Afraid to fall down off the wire

All these voices scream at me (They scream)
They're calling out my name
Cold dead hands reach out in greed (My name)
It's driving me insane

Livewire, on fire
I can't get any higher
Towards the sun
I'm too far gone

Livewire, on fire
I can't get any higher
I ride cloud nine
I'm aerodyne
