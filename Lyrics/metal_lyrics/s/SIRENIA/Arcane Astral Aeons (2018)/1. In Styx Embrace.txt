The time has come
For me to face who I have become
The looking glass stares back hard
Who are the one before me
This lost and lonely soul so frail and scarred

Give away to the pain of yesterday
We're all lost, scarred and broken anyway

Like the darkness conquers the light
Will a new dawn come to life, come to life
Like the day gives in to the night
Will the sunset cease the light, cease the light
I hold my pledge to thee
Who darken all my dreams

The haunting past
Endures my persistence at long last
I gave me all for no greater cause
At the end it downed on me
There was no need to even carry on

Give away to the pain of yesterday
We're all lost, scarred and broken anyway

Like the darkness conquers the light
Will a new dawn come to life, come to life
Like the day gives in to the night
Will the sunset cease the light, cease the light
I hold my pledge to thee
Who darken all my dreams

Dying emotions and dreams
All led adrift on the Stygian stream
Cursed down below and beneath
This river will seize all secrets
I drown in the currents
I'm embraced by the Styx
A startling burden
A total eclipse

Silence speaks louder than the knife
Timeless appears the void that wore me down
Right to the ground

Like the darkness conquers the light
Will a new dawn come to life, come to life
Like the day gives in to the night
Will the sunset cease the light, cease the light
I hold my pledge to thee
Who darken all my dreams
