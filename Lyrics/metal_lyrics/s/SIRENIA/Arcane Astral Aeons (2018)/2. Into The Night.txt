Ah, ooh, ah

Into the eye of the storm
Deception and scorn
Dark clouds form
Into the depths of the sea
I can not breathe
I'm lulled into sleep

I'm sinking deeper in a bottomless sea

(Into the night) The waves grow higher
(Into the night) Where foes conspired
Here, where all daylight gives in
(Into the night) So cold and dire
(Into the night) The moon rise higher
Here, at the end of all things

Into the lingering dark
No light in my heart
No gleam, nor a spark
Into the realms of the moon
A bright silver spoon
A dying maroon

The undertaker emerged way too soon

(Into the night) The waves grow higher
(Into the night) Where foes conspired
Here, where all daylight gives in
(Into the night) So cold and dire
(Into the night) The moon rise higher
Here, at the end of all things

(Into the dark) Les vagues se dÃ©chaÃ®nent
(Into the dark) Ou l'ennemi conspire
(Into the dark)

(Into the night) The waves grow higher
(Into the night) Where foes conspired
Here, where all daylight gives in
(Into the night) So cold and dire
(Into the night) The moon rise higher
Here, at the end of all things

(Into the night) The waves grow higher
(Into the night) Where foes conspired
Here, where all daylight gives in
(Into the night) So cold and dire
(Into the night) The moon rise higher
Here, at the end of all things
