In my darkest dreams, I follow you into the night
In my darkest dreams, I walk with you beyond the light

[Chorus:]
This darkness on my mind
Always tries to bring me further down
This darkness deep inside
Makes me lose myself time after time

In my darkest hours, I see the world be built devours
In my darkest hours, I see a crumbling tower

[Chorus]

Makes me lose myself time after time
Makes me lose myself time after time

[Growls:]
Feel the pain, it's growing strong
Our hearts been bleeding for so long
There's a light, there's a dream, there's a fire within
Fading on into night eternally

Our crumbling walls, I can see them fall
Our bleeding hearts, forever lost in the dark

[Chorus x2]
