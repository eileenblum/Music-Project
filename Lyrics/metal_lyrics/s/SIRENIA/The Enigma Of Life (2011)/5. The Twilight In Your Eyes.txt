The twilight in your eyes
It lingers still
Like it has done all your life

Your heart is aching inside
It's bleeding still
Like it has done all your life

[Chorus:]
I want to see the sun rise in your eyes
Be gone all sorrows, the pain that you keep inside
I want to see the summer lighten your life
Be gone all winters, the cold you still hold inside

The sorrow and the strife
Still linger here
Like they have done all your life

The pain keeps holding you down
It hurts you still
Like it has done all your life

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]

I want to see the sun rise in your eyes
Be gone all sorrows, the pain that you keep inside (keep inside... Keep inside)
