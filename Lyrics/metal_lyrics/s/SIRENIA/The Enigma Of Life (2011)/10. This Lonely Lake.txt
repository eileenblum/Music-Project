I drift on a lonely lake
A lake of the darkness you forsake

I'm falling apart here in this life
I can not find the things that I've been searching for
All this time

[Chorus:]
Hear the sound of my heart breaking down in tears
As I cave in to all my fears,
It's a cruel world out there
I'm led astray in this wasteland and in the end
I know that I'm bound to descend

I'm lost on this lonely lake
I can't seem to find my way

I'm giving up on this life
'Cause I can't find the things that I've been searching for
All this time

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
