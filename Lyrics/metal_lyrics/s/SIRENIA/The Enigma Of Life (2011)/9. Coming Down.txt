Voices speaking to my mind
From afar
From distant times

They speak to me about my life
Of years to come
With loss and strife

[Chorus:]
Life's coming down to the sound of your heart breaking
For all these years they tried to bring you to the ground
They made you fall eventually, this time around

For all these years you spoke to me
To my mind
To my sanity

Revealed to me all my deepest fears
And brought me down
Soaked in tears

[Chorus]

[Growls]
I scream in desperation
I'm the lost and the fallen one
I lost my destination
So long ago

Heading on towards devastation
I'm the lost and the fallen one
This will be my resignation
Once and for all

[Solo]

[Chorus]
