You know all my dreams they fade with time
They're slowly dying in the darkest corners of your aching mind

A radiant star has lost its shine
Now consumed by all the darkness and the pain within this life

The fading embers burning out, while you linger here
Forevermore in darkness and in doubt

[Growls:]
(Fade... ) All my dreams they fade
(Fade...) See them pass away
(Fade...) See them all decay
All of my dreams fade away...
Into the night
(Fade...) Out of my sight
(Fade...) Like candle lights
All of my dreams fade away...

All of my dreams have come to an end

[Solo]
