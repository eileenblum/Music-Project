All these dreams I left behind
All these tears I cried through mournful nights
They're still haunting me as years pass by
All the dreams I ever wanted to come through for me
I saw them all cease to be

[Chorus:]
All my dreams decline, they fade away and die
I see them all passing by, break before my eyes
And still I wonder why no dreams come through for me in this life

All the love you offered me was not enough to ever set me free
I still recall all we hope to be
All my words still left unspoken
A troubled mind and a heart so broken

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
