Emerald green, you shine of hope and dreams
Crystal blue, you see me trough
Rubin red, you left my heart for dead
Diamond bright, purest delight.
Don't you see, I tried to set you free
I wanted you to be my one true love
Talk to me, reveal how you feel
Does your life still feel so unreal?

Won't you ever realize
Our worlds on fire
You're still living in denial, my love.
Won't you take me by the hand
We're off to never land.
We will watch the sun descend, never again.

Ardent gold, embracing me so cold
Silver lines of sweet decline
Onyx black, fierce as a heart attack
Sapphire, burn with desire.
Don't you see, I tried to set you free
I wanted you to be my one true love
Talk to me, reveal how you feel
Does your life still feel so unreal?

Can't you see, you're my will to be
My eyes are fixed on you my love.
Oh, I can hardly breathe
I concede that you're my destiny
Totally obsessed with thee
You are the air I breathe...
