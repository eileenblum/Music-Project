Tell me how does it feel
When your dreams are wrecked and lost
And confined within the sea of time
Treason, way beyond all reason and white lie
There's a time when the truth comes down to die
Are your needs so dire
I'm a gun for hire

The tears on her face
Are crystallized by the winter's embrace
Lost in this godforsaken place
Seems like she's fallen from grace

Winter, it's veil around her
Wither in every way
And the cold it seems is here to stay
Silence speaks out in defiance
And hurtful ways
The road to life has turned into a maze
Are your needs so dire
I'm a gun for hire
Can you feel the fire
Burning brighter and brighter

There is not much left to tell
The road is short from here to Hell
Toss a dime into the wishing well
The truth turns out to be a lie
Life is just death in disguise
Once burned, then twice shy...
