You're standing in the hall
Staring at the wall
Your eyes are cold and sad, blood-red
Your sanity was misled, left for dead.

Failed to walk the line
Fallen off cloud nine
Did you lose your mind
When did you fall behind
Tell me now
Will you ever find
The key to bring you back to life?

You linger in despair
Going nowhere
You're forcing on a smile, for awhile
Every once in a while, reconcile.
