Another dream went downstream
So it seems, my savior
Please bring me to life
Caught in your eyes, a web of lies
Purify these tears, love
You're death in disguise

We're coming to life when we fall down
Here's yet another breakdown
We are nothingness undone
What have we all become

The mirror lies, it divides
Mesmerize my senses
You're under my spell
Into the night, out of sight
Hold on tight to me, love
I'm death in disguise

We're coming to life when we fall down
Here's yet another breakdown
We are nothingness undone
What have we all become

Broken dreams won't come to life
Every day remains a strife
Silent screams speaks out so loud
Elusive sun and dark rain clouds...

We're coming to life when we fall down
Here's yet another breakdown
We are nothingness undone
What have we all become
