I stare into the eyes of sleep, the never waking
Two feet wide and six feet deep, my new realm of waiting
Beneath the flowers and fields
That's where my new journey begins

The roots are embracing me now
Feel the warmth of the earth somehow
The priest close the door, shuts the light
The undertaker smiles
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust

I gaze into infinity, a world of dreamers
I left behind the cruelty of non believers
Beneath the flowers and the fields
My kingdom opens up to me

Come dream with me, eternally
I'll be your saviour
Beneath the fields, flowers and trees
We'll sleep forever.
