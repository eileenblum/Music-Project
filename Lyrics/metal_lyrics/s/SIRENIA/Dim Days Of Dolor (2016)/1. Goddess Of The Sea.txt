Scarlet and red, flaming sunset in the distance
You're going down on the prowl, Sea Goddess
Never to rest, all obsessed in Thy search for Northwest.
Vigilant eyes coming to life once again
Here in the night, in the depths of the search
Searching the deep infinitely with desire and greed.

Coming alive, thrive in the night, sleeping in the fire
Chest of gold, dreams unfold, burning with desire
You are my treasure, haven and pleasure, my pearls and gold.

Give me a gust, give me the wind and that horizon
Give me nine waves, seaman's grave, endless sleep
I honour Thee eternally. RÃ¡n - my Goddess of the Sea.
At the seashore or ocean floor, always searching
Precious treasures all bound for your net
All you possess my Sea Goddess you will wear as a dress.
