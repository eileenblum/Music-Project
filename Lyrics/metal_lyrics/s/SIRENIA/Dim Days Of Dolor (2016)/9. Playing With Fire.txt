What is this misery called life
What are these days filled with strife
What are these words sharper than a switchblade knife
So hard to find a way to cope
So hard to find a shred of hope
Too hard to justify a life for a misanthrope

You are my desire
Take me higher and higher
Playing with fire
Strung out, high and wired

What is this feeling on my mind
I crave for something undefined
An addiction's curse devours my piece of mind
What is this life that I forsake
I drift along in its wake
And when I left you there, what did I undertake.

Mon dÃ©sir se fait troublant
Jouons avec le feu
Conduis-moi au firmament
Quels qu'en soient les enjeux

Are you playing with fire
Can't you see the flames grow higher
Are you still high and wired
Are you burning with desire
Are you up against addiction
Are you conquered by affliction
Is your life thy infliction
Say your final benediction
