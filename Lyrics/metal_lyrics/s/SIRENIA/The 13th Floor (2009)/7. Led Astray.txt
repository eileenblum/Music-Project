I go through the pages of my own life, day by day
Like a dream on the horizon, they seem so lost
All led astray
I see them passing away

These feelings inside me
Keep bringing me further and further down
Been lost for so long, can't find my way home
I don't even know where I belong

I've faced all the ages all alone, by myself
Never ending is the treason in every night
And every day
The circle drives me insane
