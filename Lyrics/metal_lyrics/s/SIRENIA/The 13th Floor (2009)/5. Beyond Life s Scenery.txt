There's a voice that speaks of time
There's a growing void inside
There are doors in life that I can't seem to find
There's a fire in my dreams
Fading day by day it seems
There's a narrow path beneath the fallen leaves

The years we tried to deny
Still haunt us now

There's a garden deep within
Where all life is withering
There's a fall and there's a wall and there's a sin
There are nails through my heart
All hope is torn apart
There are footsteps leading to my epitaph

I see you stand forsaken
On a desolate and distant shore
You have been lost for so long
No one can ever take you back to how it was

Down, feeling down, falling down, sinking further down
Misery circles around

Wane, feel the pain, gone insane and this life's to blame
Seems like it's all in vain
Dark, the past was dark, the present's dark, the future seems so dark
Alike our hearts
Deep is the sleep that life keeps beyond it's scenery
What life sows, we'll never reap

The years we tried to deny
Still haunt us now
The pain still burns deep inside
As life flows by
