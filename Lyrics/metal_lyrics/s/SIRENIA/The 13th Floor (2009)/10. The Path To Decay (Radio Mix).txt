[Bonus track]

Life brings nothing for the same
Keep searchin' new days on the horizon
While time just seems to slip away
I'm leaving no trace along the way

Seems like I'm falling deeper
Deeper inside myself
Feels like I'm growing weaker
Much weaker each day
Along the path to decay

The lights are fading day by day
No cure for the lost, there's no ascending
When life could not become more pale
A new dawn is here, another day

Seems like I'm falling deeper
Deeper inside myself
Feels like I'm growing weaker
Much weaker each day
Along the path to decay

[Guitar solo]

Seems like I'm falling deeper
Deeper inside myself
Feels like I'm growing weaker
Much weaker each day
Along the path to decay

[Choir]
