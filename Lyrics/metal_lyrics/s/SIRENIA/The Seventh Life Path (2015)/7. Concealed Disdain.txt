I cant stand this life no more
I cant stand what I've become
Wheel of fire, life undone
I've always felt so broken
Lost signs and waning tokens
The nameless pain remain unspoken

Someone at my door
I hear a voice I've never heard before

A stranger calling my name
Concealed disdain
Life drives me insane

I cut my veins wide open
I cant stand this life sober
The burden of time pulls me under this existence torn me asunder
This time I'm free at last
Free from pain and a haunting past

Lunacy and toil
Are consuming my soul

Life demoralize me
Won't you all just leave me be
