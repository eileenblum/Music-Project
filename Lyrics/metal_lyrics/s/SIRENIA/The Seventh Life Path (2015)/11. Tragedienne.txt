By the sea I wandered on
Seeking some relief

On a soothing April dawn
Was when this came to be

By the sea I lingered on
When I became aware of
Distant voices from beyond
So dim and alluring

Riddles of the deep
Secrets of the deep blue sea

Tragedienne, in sorrow eternally

Mesmerized and shivering
I came to understand
There's something about the sea
The grave for a thousand men
