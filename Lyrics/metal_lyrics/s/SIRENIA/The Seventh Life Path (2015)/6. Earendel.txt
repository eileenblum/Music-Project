I count the star on a bleak midwinter sky
I watch them twinkle, shine, wane and die

But there's a star shining brighter than them all
A star that lingers when all the others fall

Shine for me my morning star
I treasure thee from afar
Rise and shine, never decline, my divine..
Arise wherever you are

I count the scars deep within our souls
I count the hearts you broke and the dreams you sold
But there's a hope transcending them all
A hope that lingers when all the others fall

Sirius... Pass all your light on to us

Earendel... You are our wishing well

Zorya... Radiant diamonds above

Venus... Forever guide us
