Here comes the storm, enraged and winterborn
Here comes the fall, precipitation for one and all
Here comes the night, consuming every ray of light
Here comes the end, behold as chaos and death transcends

Come with me now
Into the night, into the night
Follow me through life
Glowing moonlight
The silver eye, silver eye
Guide us through the night

Here comes the rain, to chill my heart with cold disdain
Here comes the pain, to devastate and to restrain
Here comes the snow, to chill my soul as autumn lets go
Here comes the crow, to rest upon my tombstone

The silver eye is shining bright
On a bleak midwinter night

Lead me on through the night...

Come with me now
Lead me on...
I'll follow thee through life...

Follow me now
I will follow...

Lead me on through the afterlife...

I will lead you on
Lead me on...
I'll follow thee blindly...

I'll lead you home
I will follow...
