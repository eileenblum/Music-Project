I spin in circles like the wheel time

I'm wasting away

I'm losing my mind
Head for the unknown, the long lost divine
Grand mystery
The riddle of life

An elixir... Is all I need
An elixir... I beg and plead
An elixir... Let me drink my fill of this cure-all remedy
An elixir... I come undone
An elixir... The fallen one
An elixir... Fill my mug
I'll drink to life and a loaded gun

I have seen into the future of mine
Just years of decline
All waiting in line

Behind the curtains of life there's a light
Still shining bright
The end is in sight

Come speak to me
My love, my enemy
After all we've been through
I'm still dead to you
