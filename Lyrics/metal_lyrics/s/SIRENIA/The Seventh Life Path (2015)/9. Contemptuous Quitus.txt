Deception smiles at you, derisive
Reflections so divisive
Conception of your deceit
Divides all of my inner feelings

This is the language of the dark asphyxiation of the heart
Your very soul all torn apart
Contemptuous quietus

Perceptions falling through, failing you
Becoming your own doom
Self-deception digs a grave for you
Where your regrets will come through

You're the torn in my heart
You will tear me apart
You're a plague and a curse
Contemptuous quietus

You're the pain in my soul
Spinning out of control
Ominous dusk
Contemptuous quietus
