Another day enshrouded in mist
Profound scars on my wrist
I failed to live, I just exist
Days of grievance still persist
Shining dreams of a life divine
Enshrined by the wheels of time
A growing darkness on my mind
Soon the cathedral bell will chime

Alleviation of my pain be done
I cannot stand who I have become
I see my life flash before my eyes
The cathedral bell chimes for me this time

Another night enshrouded in grief
No ascendance, no relief
All hope turned to disbelief
Wither away like autumn leaves
In the eye of the October storm
Every shred of warmth is torn
My heart feels ill, my soul outworn
I wish that I was never born

There's a beauty in all fading light
A vivid gateway to a night divine
Like a velvet caress, so benign
Like a sacred unopened shrine
Becoming mine
There's a waning garden in my dreams
Over flooded by a thousand streams
Streams of tears that makes me drown
Sinking down, further down
