[Bonus Track]These chains that bridles me
That kept me from being free
These chains held me down
For far too many years
All of this time has been in vain
Now is the time to break these chains

You cannot change me
You cannot break me
'Cause there's strength in me
That's bound to be
You can't control me
You can't exploit me anymore you see
'Cause I broke free

Emotions dividing me
Profound as the deep blue sea
But I won't give in
I'll never let the demons win
Though all my past drives me insane
I will refuse to let my life be all in vain
