[iTunes Bonus Track]Deep inside of me
Thereâs a river running wild and free
Like I used to be
As the years went by
I became estranged to myself and my life
A sequel of decay and strife
Â 
Waning onâ¦
I lost my sanity so long ago
I still donât know how this came to pass
I once was a star
On top of everything I came across
But now, alas!
Iâm right back at the start
Â 
Beneath a darkened sky
The river of life is running dry
Still I donât know why
Itâs hard to remain sane
When all my glee has now been replaced by pain
The only thing that still remains
Â 
Waning onâ¦
I lost my sanity so long ago
I still donât know how this came to pass
I once was a star
On top of everything I came across
But now, alas!
Iâm right back at the start
Â 
All the things that slipped through my hands
So many things I failed to understand
Is this all there is for me, just a high ordeal
It all seems to me so unreal
Â 
Waning onâ¦
I lost my sanity so long ago
I still donât know how this came to pass
I once was a star
On top of everything I came across
But now, alas!
Iâm right back at the start
