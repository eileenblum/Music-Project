[Bonus Track]A lonely girl with a broken heart
Down shut eyes, all torn apart
She offered her heart to you
Though it was pale and frozen through
But you turned it down

She's lost in denial
Her feelings are gone
Her mind's turned numb
Lost in denial
Can't anyone take her back home

A weeping girl with a broken life
Darkened eyes and a faded smile
She offered her life to you
With all its loss and all its doom
But you turned it all down
