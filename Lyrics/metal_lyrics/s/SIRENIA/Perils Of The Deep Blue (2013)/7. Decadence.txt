In decadence
I'm speaking to myself again
Falter through these ruined years
My windows are red with tears
I'm passing through gaping doors
Through the aeons of my inner wars

This is the silence that never ends
It brought my sanity to decadence
These years of vanity's
Been breaking me down
My hands are shaking, my mind is aching

Lost in a trance
All downfalls they come in advance
Life is a deadly romance
But you might get fooled at first glance
I'm passing through aging halls
While I'm waiting for the curtain call

This vile anxiety
Brought here by you for me
This war, this war
This grave sobriety
Seems like it's killing me
This war, what for?

My world's on fire
State of denial
Sleepwalking souls
Wearing blindfolds
