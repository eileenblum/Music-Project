This must be the funeral of my soul
I've never before felt so cold
It feels like thorns through my heart
Like claws tearing me apart

You got to chase your demons on the run
Put out their fire, their dark desires
The exorcism has begun
Slaying all, leaving none

This must be the burial of my heart
This must be the day my life falls apart
I've never before felt so distressed
I beg you to put my pain to rest
