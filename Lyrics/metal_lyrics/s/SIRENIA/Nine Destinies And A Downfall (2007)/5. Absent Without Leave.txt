I can feel the eyes of your despair
Even where you're not here
I can feel your pain within myself
It's still keeping me down here
Life keeps on growing colder year by year
With a winter heart and my frozen tears
I stand lone to face my darkest fears

I' ve been wasting away, i' ve been fading inside
I' ve been drifting away from the lights in my life
I' ve been living in vain, living insane
I' ve been tripping down all the darkest of lanes

There's a shadow that dwells inside your head
Within mine as well
Turns our lives into a living hell
Like a curse and a spell
I' ve been drifting away from days of light
I' ve been swept away far into the night
I guess I'll never ever make it back

On a morning, a summer dawn
You speak in riddles and rhymes
From a distance your life it seems
Like a frozen heart in neon dreams
