There's a river that runs along
Your fading hope and darkened days to come
The lights are fading out once more
I see you falter so lost and blind
I know a shadow still lingers in in your mind
But i can`t lead you on, not this time

I`ve been dreaming for far too long
And my dreams all break one by one
I'm still standing, still facing the fall
Will i give in the distant calls

I`ve been watching your crumbling walls
I`ve endured a thousand tears or more
In a frozen moment of time, i see you fall
Only memories remain of you now
You' ve given in to darkness and to doubt
You couldn`t find the strength to cast
The demons out
