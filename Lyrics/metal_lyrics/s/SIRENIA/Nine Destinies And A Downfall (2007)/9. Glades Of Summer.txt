In the fields of summer
I will dance away with you
I never knew the pain would see us through
And though we fear the silence
We never ever realized
That life was only passing gently by

When the darkness seems to fall
Then I can hear you call
Your voice is clearer now than before
And in the summer rain
IÂ´ll carry all your pain
If I could only see you again

In the glades of summer
A light still wanes in you
Like winter days long gone
In midst of June
And though the cross feels lighter
On a warm midsummer night
Why do we then still feel so cold inside

When the darkness seems to fall
Then I can hear you call
Your voice is weaker now than before
And in the summer rain
You gave in to your pain
And life will never be the same again
