I stroll through days and nights
And through hours of weeping
Can i mend by broken heart by
Speaking to myself
I`ve been lost and found
And broken down bye the treason in your eyes
IÂ´ve been turned around
Burned upside down by the fraud in all your lies

Feel the lights are fading within me
There's a void and a growing anxiety
I can feel the bitter end draws near
I concede this life has nothing more for me

I fall through rays of light
In the hours of redeeming
Last call and far too late now
As far as i can tell
I`ve been burned in life, burned too many times
Wheel of fire's still burning
I have done my time, walked too many lines
And my soul keeps on burning
