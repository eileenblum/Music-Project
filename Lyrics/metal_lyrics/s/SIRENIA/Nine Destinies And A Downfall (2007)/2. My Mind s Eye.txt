If you were here
I'd whisper sweet nothings in your ear
And appeal to all your fears
If you were mine, if you were only mine
I'd bring you so much further down
And twist your mind until the end of time

You will never realize
What darkness lies inside my mind

If you are down
I will come to chain you to the ground
And penetrate your mind
If you are lost, if only you are lost
I'll be there to break you trust
And ravage all your lust for life, my love

[x3]
You will never realize
What darkness lies inside my mind
