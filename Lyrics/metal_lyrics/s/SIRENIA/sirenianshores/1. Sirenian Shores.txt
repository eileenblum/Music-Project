Down by the sounding sea 
Drawn to the lure of a siren's melody 
to the tempting sweeping of the waves 
to the calling of a mellow grave 
Yon all wonder and yon all dreams 
Can't strive against giving in 
And she siren angelique 
invoke my endless sleep 

Come with me into the deep 
I'll lead you on through the seas of infinte sleep 

I stand upon the sweeping shore 
A frozen heart won't thrive no more 
A velvet voice is calling me 
yon this scornful deep blue sea 
Take my hand, I'll follow thee 
into the sombre placid deep 
Beyond the waves and far beneath 
where I can rest, forever free 

I'm going under 
In writhes I'm going down 
in a lunar sea on the siren's night 
Beneath the surface 
I choke...tenderly drown 
and a thousand scornful sirens come around 

Fear the sounding sea 
Don't give in like me...
