[Expanded Edition Bonus Track]

[Music &amp; Lyrics: Hanneman &amp; King]

Quarters for the criminally insane
The sentence read for life I must remain
The path I chose has led me to my grave
To try again I'd have no other way

Quarters for the criminally insane
Escape for me has fast become a game
Soon to be, I'll leave without a trace
Endangered species end the human race

Branded in pain
Marked criminally insane
Locked away and kept restrained
Disapprobation, but what have I done
I have yet only just begun
To take your fuckin' lives!

Night will come and I will follow
For my victims, no tomorrow
Make it fast, your time of sorrow
On his trail, I'll make you follow
