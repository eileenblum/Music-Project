[Hanneman/Araya]

Razors edge
Outlines the dead
Incisions in my head
Anticipation the stimulation
To kill the exhilaration

[CHORUS]
Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die

[CHORUS 2]
Close your eyes
And forget your name
Step outside yourself
And let your thoughts drain
As you go insane... go insane

Innate seed
To watch you bleed
A demanding physical need
Desecrated eviscerated
Time perpetuated

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS 2]

Inert flesh
A bloody tomb
A decorated splatter brightens the room
An execution a sadist ritual
Mad intervals of mind residuals

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS 2]

Kerry King: guitar
Jeff Hanneman: guitar
Dave Lombardo: drums
Tom Araya: vocals, bass
