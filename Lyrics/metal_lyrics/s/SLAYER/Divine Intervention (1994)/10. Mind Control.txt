Unknown are the caverns of the mind
New realms of affliction lurk inside
Unbound massive mental energy
Your last breaths taken from you easily

Incoherence disrupts your rationale
Involuntary your last confessional
No sense of being missing segments of time
Inconsistency is feeding on your mind

[lead: Hannemann]

Mind control, pain unfolds
I own all your sensations
Weakening, reasoning
Mesmeric full demolition
Hypnotized - victimized
Behold the threshold to the web
Screaming souls fear echoes
Piercing boundaries of the dead

[lead: King]

Penetration of the window to your soul
Deterioration of the mind, no self control
Temporarily comprehend no memories
Hollow carcass of a man is all I leave

Execution but a thought in the end
Slowly erasing your life and what has been
Passing victims in the land of secrecy
Cerebral death can come to you in your dreams
