I never thought the taste of you would be the only thing to make me bleed
Why am I so alive while you lay still in the ground beneath me?

Fear of death the dark inside
Have become your only children
They're in front of you,
Watching you
Lost screams, unholy dreams, unrest
I laugh at your god as he's passing through

Slicing at your throat to warm my skin
Never thought it'd come to this
What the fuck?
I've gone wrong no rest

Your children still call
Can't you hear them screaming out your name?
You've gone insane,
They're in my head
They want you to die in front of me, die in front of me

Thinking why me?
Wishing this was all a dream
Insanity, reality,
You're going to die in front of me

Pestilence is here,
Death awaits,
Your body is not of Christ
It's my alter,

Helpless and alone,
Violate,
Enveloped in my skin
Faceless canvass,

Tearing at your flesh,
Bathed in blood
Violently regress,
Death's so endless,

Brutal is your pain
Anguish is a game,
Broken and afraid,
God can't help you now

You'll wish you were in hell [3x]

Ghostly figures are always standing still
Are they mocking me?
What do they see?

I didn't want your death to end so fast,
But once you start, you cannot stop
I need it now to fucking last

Die in front of me
Die in front of me.

Thinking why me?
Wishing this was all a dream,
Insanity, reality
You're going to die in front of me.

Pestilence is here,
Death awaits,
Your body is not of Christ
It's my alter,

Brutal is your pain,
Anguish is a game
Broken and afraid,
God can't help you now

You'll wish you were in hell [4x]

I never thought the taste of you would be the only thing to make me bleed,

All alone in my funeral home,
Playing in blood
There's just got to be
Something's wrong with me,

Draining veins,
It's all the same
The torture in my head,
It won't stop until I am fucking dead

Pestilence is here,
Death awaits,
Your body is not of Christ
It's my alter,

Helpless and alone,
Violate,
Enveloped in my skin
Faceless canvass,

Tearing at your flesh,
Bathed in blood
Violently regress,
Death's so endless,

Brutal is your pain
Anguish is a game,
Broken and afraid,
God can't help you now

You'll wish you were in hell [3x]
