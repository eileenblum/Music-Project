Awake each day to propaganda,
Ready to persuade,
Complacency, conformity
Relentless madness they regurgitate
So save your breath, you can't coerce the strong with verbal warfare

Defending, bludgeoning, to succumb to Christ or they will
Watch you fucking burn, these apocalyptic predators must die
Everyone til none are left alive, I'll eradicate the weak
Within this war, cos I'm the fucking weapon, I'm not, not of this god

[Lead: Hanneman]

Replicate, like a virus that infects with disease
The beckoning pestering, don't preach to me with your blasphemy
Exterminate, the bottom dweller on your fear they prey
There's symmetry in anarchy, believe the lies or they will watch you

Fuckin' burn, these apocalyptic predators must die
Everyone til none are left alive, I'll eradicate the weak
Within this war, cos I'm the fucking weapon, I'm not, not of this god
False god, sorcerer, free thought torturer, embedded in the mind of the masses

Outcast, conjurer, spineless provocateur, engulfed in narcissistic madness
No need to feel so hollow, a promise of no sorrow, you call him the messiah
I seek a deviant pariah

[Lead: King]

Holy water empty threat, the holy cross has no effect
I piss on any object of virtue, crucifix and rosaries
A world of insecurities, keep waiting for your soul to be rescued
You'll see no bright tomorrow, a promise of more sorrow

You call him the messiah, I see a reckless fashion based on metal slavery

[Lead: King]

You are the tainted, I am the pure, you are the sickness
I am the cure, a toxic threat of your non sense, I feed
I'll be the one to bring Christ to his knees, crucify then ridiculed again
A target for all time, until the end

I'll expose a total inconsistencies, and wallow in my heresy
Cos I am the fucking weapon, attacker of their ideology
Intoxicate with rationality, these apocalyptic predators must die
Cos I am the fucking weapon, I'm not, not of this god
