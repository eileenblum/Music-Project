With our callous minds we infect
Other ways of life no regrets
Like a masochist we instigate
While the rest of the world must tolerate

Americon, it's all about the mother fucking oil
Regardless of the flag upon it's soil
In a blood bath we pad our fucking greed
The price is high to maintain liberty

Americon, so here we live in a land of deceit
That imprison the minds of the weak
No immunity for swaying the odds
From this resistance strain americon

Americon, some feel the need to play god
No immunity for swaying the odds
From this resilient plague americon

With our poison minds we infest
Other ways of life we ingest
In a blood bath we steal you dignity
The price is high to maintain liberty

Americon
