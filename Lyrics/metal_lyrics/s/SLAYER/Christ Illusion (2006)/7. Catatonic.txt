[King]

Fear is just interpretation
Feeds my motivation
Our time together is
A bloodbath of serenity
Plead no more
There's no confusing the final
Excitation
My rancid passion is electrified

Accept this
My religion of torture
I can't see any purity
Just imperfection and obscenity
My blood soaked hands devise
Your slow methodic demise
Asphyxiate the world
It's blind without me

Catatonic
Catatonic
I'm numb in priceless solitude
Exhilarating keeping pieces of you near

[Lead King]

Visions of decapitation
My mental masturbation
I try to resurrect
Your consciousness, your intellect
Once so pure
Your pain excites and tests me
Excitation
The empty stare emitting from your eye

Embrace it
My religion of torture
All I see are the impurities
The imperfections and obscenities

[Lead King / Hanneman]

Accept this
My religion of torture
Excitation
The rancid passion coming from your eyes

My blood soaked hands devise
Your slow methodic demise
Asphyxiate the world
It's blind without me

Catatonic
Catatonic
I'm numb in priceless solitude
Exterminating all the voices multitudes
I can't stop because it's so hypnotic
Catatonic
