[VINYL ONLY TRACK]
[by Suicidal Tendencies]

Bombers in flight
Trident missiles in the air
My missiles undergroung
Protect us till we're dead

Memories of tomorrow-crying sorrow

Push the button
Kiss good-bye the nuclear arsenal
A bomber flying off their ramps
Nuclear bombs explode

Radio active people
Search for medicine
Pray for shelter
Kill for food

Memories of tomorrow-crying sorrow

Mass starvation
Contaminated water
Destroyed Cities
Mutilated bodies

Memories of tomorrow-crying sorrow

I'll kill myself
I'd rather die
If you could see in the future
You'd know why

Memories of tomorrow

Tom Araya - bass, vocals
Jeff Hanneman &amp; Kerry King - guitars
Paul Bostaph - drums
