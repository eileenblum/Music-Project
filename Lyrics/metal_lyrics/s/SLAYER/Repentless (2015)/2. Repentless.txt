[Music &amp; Lyrics by Kerry King]

Arrogance, violence, world in disarray
Dealing with insanity every fuckinâ day
I hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckinâ scene
Pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity
Ainât got the time, I donât want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckinâ do
No looking back, no regrets, no apologies
What you get is what you see

Live fast, on high
Repentless, let it ride

My songs relive the atrocities of war
Canât take society any fuckinâ more
Intensity, anarchy, hatred amplified
Playing this shit is all that keeps me alive
I leave it all on the road living on the stage
This is my life where I kill it everyday
So take your shot, bottomâs up, this is no lie
Iâll be beating this guitar âtil the day I die

Live fast, on high
Repentless, let it ride

[Leads - King, Holt, King, Holt]

I hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckinâ scene
Pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity
Ainât got the time, I donât want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckinâ do
No looking back, no regrets, no apologies
What you get is what you see
Weâre all killing ourselves a little more everyday

Live fast, on high
Repentless, let it ride

[Lead - King]
