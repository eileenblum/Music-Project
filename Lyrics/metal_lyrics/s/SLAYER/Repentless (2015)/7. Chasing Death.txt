You can never truly see
Inside the ones you know
Until youâve found them near
The edge of self control

All I hear are lies
You're lying to yourself
And everything is out of control

You're just a fuckin' slave of discontent
I'm sick of watching you dig this hole

Time waits - for no one
Won't stop - It can't be outrun
You know - That pain in your head
Won't stop 'til the desperation ends

You've found yourself chasing death
Oblivious until the end
You'll never stop chasing death

Innocence, common sense, I don't see the relevance
Of anything that you've got to say
Parasite, socialite, you're never gonna win this fight
There is no fucking easy way out
No easy way out

I know I should have seen it all coming
But I had to find it out on my own
A whore to incompetence you hide behind
The shadow that once was your thrown
Control is a discipline even when
Frustration just stands in your way
The throes of insanity feel just like
A war inside you everyday

Time waits - for no one
Won't stop - It can't be outrun
There's just - no way of knowing
How long - paranoia's growing
Canât stop the poison winning
Please - Just take away this feeling
You know - that pain in your head
Won't stop until the desperation ends

You've found yourself chasing death
Oblivious until the end
You'll never stop until you're dead

Innocence, common sense, I don't see the relevance

There is no fucking easy way out
No easy way out
No easy way out
No easy way out
