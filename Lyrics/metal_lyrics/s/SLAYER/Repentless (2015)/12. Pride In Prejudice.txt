You made your choice
I'll take my stand
Your life story in my blood stained hands

Pride in prejudice
Don't give me that power bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gun shot sets the precedence

Abuse of power, civil unrest
Money in blood is of no significance
Inner rage waiting to ignite
Blood of the innocent unites

I'm right you're wrong
In number I'm strong
Violence is proof enough that I am

Pride in prejudice
Don't give me that power bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot sets the precedence
Marshall Law a militant state
Barrel of a gun seals your fate
Fire burns with media hype
Speak the truth through your own lies

[Lead: King]

Pride in prejudice
Don't give me that power bullshit
Hate in violence
One gunshot sets the precedence
Pride in prejudice
Donât give me your bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot killed the innocent

Some love to hate
Right in your face
Violence will facilitate

Fuel the fire with racial slurs
And see who kills the other first
