You're staring at the atrocity vendor
A fuckin' equal opportunity offender
A sociopath with methodical control
Voyeur of terror watch the scenes of death unfold

I'll never hesitate to beat you, break you, sever every part of you
Light you up with kerosene, watch you burn, watch you bleed

I am torture redefined, cancer shooting from my eyes
Hell yes, agony is real, I can show you how it feels
Violence pulsing in my veins, death forever reigns

In this chapel I am the pastor
A fucking guarantee of your impending disaster
No limit to the anguish you'll see
Bear witness to this agony eternally

I'll never hesitate to beat you, break you, sever every part of you
Reeking of despair, this is no fuckin' nightmare

I am torture redefined, cancer shooting from my eyes
Hell yes, agony is real,I can show you how it feels
Violence pulsing in my veins, death forever reigns

You're staring at the atrocity vendor
Mother fuckin' equal opportunity offender
So many parts of you I'll possess
Trophies of appendage are mine to obsess

I'll never hesitate to beat you, break you, sever every part of you
First class terror ride, personal genocide

I am evil unconfined, cancer shooting from my eyes
Hell yes, agony is real, I can show you how it feels
Violence pulsing in my veins, death forever reigns
