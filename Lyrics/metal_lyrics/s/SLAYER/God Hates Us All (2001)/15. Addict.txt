[Bonus track]
[music: Hanneman, Lyrics:King]

I won't cover you eyes
I want your innocence
Glisten before me in a cold sweat
I wan't you to see your lie spill on me
Spill on me
Manifested as a primitive craving
The craving never seems to go away
I want to see the face of everyone fall
Fall into the cold embrace of death
You're in my nightmare
I decide when it stops
It's my fucking drug
Makes my rush intensify
Hardcore the overdose
Your fear gets me high
Unbound I'm the weapon made to sterilize
Sterilize all the idiot victims
Anytime, anywhere, anyone I want
Everyone's addicted to this torture
I'm the agony in every breath
Every breath brings you closer to me
You'll do anything, anything
You'll do anything to make it stop
You're in my nightmare
I decide when it stops
It's my fucking drug
Makes my rush intensify
Chaos deep inside it makes me
It makes me feel surreal
It makes me need to kill
It makes me feel surreal
It makes me need to kill
Do you want to feel eternity
Your eternity lies within me
I am the terror of your final breath
Your final breath brings light to my darkness
Like an act of fucking God unleashed
On the innocence - innocence of mankind
You'll do anything - anything
You'll do anything to make it stop
It's my fucking drug
Makes my rush intensify
Hardcore the overdose
Your fear gets me of like fuck
