[Bonus track]
[music &amp; lyrics: King]

Come step inside my hate, you know there's nothing to it
Step inside my pain, you'll never make it through it.
Once you're sucked into my sado-paradise
Lose your mind, inside, the pleasure lies within your pain.
Pain.

Drown in my hate. You know, you know.
Brutality's the way of this world.
Branded and scarred. Defy, defy.
A comatose and blind existence.
Hatred holocaust you see in me
Is more than just a way of life.
I've reinvented the way I relate to this complacent world.

All of life decays.
Rapes my eyes.
Screams never silence the pain.
Death is like an old friend.
I can't wait to watch you die.

I am you vice. So real, so real.
Desires of the scars of new flesh.
Bathe in you blood. Excites, excites.
The ritualistic lacerations.
Inhumanities. Profane, insane
Inflicted since the dawn of time.
Make your peace with God. Goodbye.
And embrace the pain that burns inside you.

All of life decays.
Rapes my eyes.
Screams never silence the pain.
Death is like an old friend.
I can't wait to watch you die.
I can't wait...

Come step inside my hate, you know there's nothing to it.
Step inside my pain, you'll never make it through it.
Redefine your life in sado-paradise.
Necessary cleansing of the mind's eye.
Love and agony. Electric ecstasy.
Can't get enough euphoric serenity.
Stains won't fade away forever scarstruck.
They never fade away forever scarstruck.

Drown in my hate. You know, you know.
Brutality's the way of this world.
Branded and scarred. Defy, defy.
A comatose and blind existence.
You're like the walking dead. So blind inside.
Oblivious to psycho pleasure.
I am your new God. Un-God.
So if you want hell, here I am.

Everything around me decays.
Rapes my eyes.
Screams never silence the pain.
Make you my canvas of pure, fresh flesh
Scarstruck!
Scarstruck!
Scarstruck!
