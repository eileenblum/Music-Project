Everything fades to black
Watch what you're saying because
I've got nothing to lose

No slack in this chain to take a single stride
Face first in the dirt

Turned your back when I was hurting
'Showing' respect' is what you stand for
Suffering for you, was that enough?
Eyes dream of the home but face the fence
