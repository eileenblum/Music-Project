Bottom of the map
Blinded in ignorance
Another body found in the gutter that ain't no martyr
Plagued by corruption
Beaten to submission
Cowards to broke this town
Buried it down in the dirt
Tucson is weeping
But her tears are dried in the sun
Tucson's pride won't be stolen
Tucson's dreams won't be broken
