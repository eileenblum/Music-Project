No hope
No integrity
Fucked up integrity
You didn't mean to spoil her
Stuck in my eyes
Your smug smiling face
Your acting so gentle
For all the women you'll snake
Fake to me
Hate what I see
Step in my way
&amp; you're fucked up
You'll lay in a pool of your blood
Don't get mouthy &amp; fucking smart
