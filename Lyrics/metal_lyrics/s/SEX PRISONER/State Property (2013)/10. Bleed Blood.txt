Wings torn from your back, bleeding the blackest blood
Struggling to get a John, promiscuity's what you're killing for
Fashion, material greed
Straight to the streets
Bleed blood to save your dreams
Balled up, tossed out like the other trash
Back to the street corner where you breed
Standing on the street corner like the other trash
