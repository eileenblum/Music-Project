Trapped in the Hell
Broken man full of despair
Crawled away from all that's good
Botched reality, born cursed in this grave with these sins I can't pay
Sentenced to a life of pain
When I touch these scars, they bring up bad memories &amp; all the things you've done to me, they start to bleed
The walls are closing in
Strife
Can't escape bad memories
