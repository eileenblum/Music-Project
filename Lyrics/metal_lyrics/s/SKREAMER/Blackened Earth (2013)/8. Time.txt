Hello, hello my child
If words could break a smile
Or change what came to pass
Bellow, bellows the answers
Can't hide our great disasters
This scene could be my last

[Chorus]
And everything that i've done wrong
I promise you i'll make it up
There's only one thing that I know
I love you too much to let go

So time will heal another
Restore the love and cover
You've made your last mistake
The wounds you've made still open
The things you've left unspoken
How easily they break
