His arms wide open,
teeth bearing grin
So drunk from hoping,
she'll let you in
The smell excites him,
as does the chase
The grin it widens,
upon his face

You can see it in his smile,
it will hurt for just a

WHILE [6x]

She stood there frozen,
lust in his eyes
No more words spoken,
to her surprise
She cannot fight him,
so she shouldn't try
His arms embrace her,
and dulls her cry
