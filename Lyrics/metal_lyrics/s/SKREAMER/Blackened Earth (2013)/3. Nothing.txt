Forget, nothing
Regret, nothing
All this time in here, for something
Be it men, or be it cowards
I have fucked, this world for hours
No regrets and no mistakes,
i'll destroy everything you make
You'll bring me men, i'll send you back boys,
there's no way you can stop this noise

We are the dying forgotten ones
Your fucking family, your daughters your sons
We are the ones that you love to hate
The "Perfect" families that you create

So can you kill what you have never loved?
Pray to God, thank the start above?
Can you kill what you never loved?
Pray to God, thank the stars above

Don't pity us [2x]
Fuck you
Don't pity us [2x]
Join us
Don't pity us [2x]
Nothing

NO WAY YOU CAN STOP THIS NOISE
