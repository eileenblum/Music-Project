I am abomination
Your twisted dark salvation
In every dark salvation
In every dank fixation
I burn my voice into skin
I feast on cries of sorrow
Leave lifeless torn and hollow
I laugh as legions follow
Bathe me in my well of sin

[Chorus]
I will be, the last voice you hear
And every word thats tongued, I'll disregard
Lie with me, and let me into you
As now I drag your soul straight to hell.

I've bested kings and paupers
Lay waste with unchained slaughters
My hatred knows no borders
Nothing known can sate my thirst
My loathing is immortal
My hand will purge the doubtful
You cannot end this downfall
This place has not seen my worst

I spit upon the righteous
Spread famine, war and plague
My killing spree is unjust
My weapon is my rage

These words are not a warning
Your soul will gain no mourning
Can't stop this hell from spawning

LET ME IN
