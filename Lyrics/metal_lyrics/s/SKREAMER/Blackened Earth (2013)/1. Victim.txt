[Dedicated to Sophie Lancaster]Bleeding, we are the victim
Our only crimes are our lives
Beaten, life is taken
When blood is spilt a mother cries

When pointless shit around you
has fallen,
has fallen
The only answer is our lives [2x]

[Chorus]
We are the victim,
we are the victim,
we are the victim of our lives [2x]

Seething, watch the hate spread
To everything you hold dear
Sacred, life was taken
So was this demon born of fear

Victim, or our passion
Victim of our cause

And what was born was killed in sorrow
Never will she see tomorrow
This wasn't something lies could borrow
When you took her life
you condemned your own

[RIP Sophie Lancaster 24th August 2007.]
