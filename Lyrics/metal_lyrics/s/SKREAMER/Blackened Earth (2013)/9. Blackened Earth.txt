Sell us, all of this shit that you tell us
Condemn ostracize and expel us,
as you profit for blood lust adn chaos

[Chorus]
Twisting and turning as our world is burning,
we watch your deception as it burns away
Out of sight out of mind voiceless forgotten,
we'll fight and we'll die until we have our say
BURN IT DOWN

Unwilling our voices can't stop all this killing
Our world is a prison you're building
Our final solution is sealed in

[Chorus]
Twisting and turning as our world is burning,
we watch your deception as it burns away
Out of sight out of mind voiceless forgotten,
we'll fight and we'll die until we have our say
BURN IT DOWN
