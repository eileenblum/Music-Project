I cut my fingers so my hand won't let this fucker slip
And every word it lingers, louder as I tighten grip
In every dream he haunts me mocking in his ignorance
How could I mistake deception and hate for Innocence?

Will I let it slip?
Or will I take this fucker down.
Is it a bad trip?
Are my feet still on the...

Every laugh shared, every thought had,
every moment I want out
All your bitching, all your lying,
I'll pull those two words out your mouth

You couldn't look in my eyes,
when you said your goodbyes,
that I could take
Now you're spreading your lies,
eating shit with the flies,
no more to fake

Will I let it slip?
Or will I take this fucker down.
Is it a bad trip?
Are my feet still on the ground.

STOP YOUR BITCHING
