Rise up, and fight them
Join us, on this ground
Do not, deny them
Their twisted, your sound

[Chorus]
We're standing on top of the world
Waiting for the flood
We've offered you a better life
We are flesh and blood

Fight on, for a reason
Fuck them, fuck their treason
No escape, let rage build inside you
This is our cause

[Chorus]
We're standing on top of the world
Waiting for the flood
We've offered you a better life
We are flesh and blood
