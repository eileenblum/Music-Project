Embrace the darkest of your fears
And seek the warmth within the dark
The fear and pain you live with
Will keep you from transcending

Everything you were taught
To believe in this life, was a lie
It's all to keep you from knowing
The terrifying truth is that
This life is only the passage to death
Perception of life - holographic deception
Illusions unknown to all mankind

Reborn to live out these insufferable lives
Damned to the cycle of enslavement
The only way to pass through
Is to take your own life
And receive the gifts from the gods

You choke
Cannot swallow
The truth has made you vomit
You now know
Your vessel is hollow
And you're left to weep and wallow
Gagged by the truth
Gasping for air that's not there
Frantically reaching for hope within
Deception, your perception
Is the center of all reflection

You choke
Cannot swallow
The truth has made you vomit
You now know
Your vessel is hollow
And you're left to weep and wallow
Gagged by the truth
Gasping for air that's not there
Frantically reaching for hope within
Deception, your perception
Is the center of all reflection

To go beyond what's real
To question your existence
This is how you'll find
The answers you seek

Your fear is where it thrives
It breeds within its lies
It feeds on lives in pain
Consuming souls forever binding the weak

The only way to be truly free
And break the chain of slavery
Is to embrace and go beyond
Beyond the warmth within the dark
Is what we were taught to fear and shun
The thought that there's a chance
To understand the cycle can be broken
But you must take your life
