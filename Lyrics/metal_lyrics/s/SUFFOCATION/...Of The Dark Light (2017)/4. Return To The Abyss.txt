Not all of us were born as equals
predetermined to rise or to fall
the strain cannot be ever altered
through dreams it can be deciphered
enraptured to return to the abyss
bow to the infinite
beyond a life that was lived out
there is nothing that you can do
to change this life that you've been given
nothing remains for you to embrace
only silence for you to hear
unconsciousness relics within
this illusion reflects what's real
there is no more, no more deception...
your perception has been shattered
enraptured to return to the abyss
bow to the infinite
beyond a life that was lived out
to stay is to accept a fate
most will never know
anything just beyond that
to escape is to embark
on the unimaginable
to end this is the only way
approaching the precipice
release of consciousness
to leave this world behind
the path begins
beyond the darkness
mortality's last fleeting moments
your heartbeat wanes before the passing
try to refuse this world of substance
grasping for light
the darkness shrouds
enraptured to return to the abyss
bow to the infinite
beyond a life that was lived out
there is nothing that you can do
to change this life that you've been given
nothing remains for you to embrace
only silence for you to hear
unconsciousness relics within
this illusion reflects what's real
there is no more, no more deception...
your perception has been shattered
