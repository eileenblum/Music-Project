Soon we are all to die
Your hopes and fears irrelevant
Projections of life and death
Become complete reality

All things will crumble
All will disband
All alone in this world
Souls with nowhere to rest

We offer disillusions as relief
While caught we struggle hopelessly
Boundless confusion saturates
Only in dreams can we have clarity

All things will crumble
All will disband
All alone in this world
Souls with nowhere to rest

Endless Cycles of the Suffering
Endless Cycles of the Suffering

Born into this filth
Life not worth living
These dreams of my death
...and beyond life itself

Alive only to comprehend
these ways passed down throughout the centuries
To inflict all with fear, pain and disease,
death and rebirth, the unending cycle

To die in this pain,
and never to reach a total path of awakening
Born into filth, these dreams of my death
Venial teachings guide toward the false light
Kneel, Kneel, Kneel to the divine
Serve, Serve, Serve the divine corruption

All things will crumble
All will disband
All alone in this world
Souls with nowhere to rest

To lost everything you thought was real
Terrified to let go of what you think you know
Can't stop the struggling, can't let go - collapse
Death and rebirth, the unending cycle
