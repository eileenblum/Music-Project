A tale of a world left behind,
written to preach to the weak.
Hundreds of thousands wait to bear witness
to this horrid conclusion

The end is near they claim, 
rumors of fear consume
The arrival of the final decline of the world

To witness the rise and fall of it all 
Haunting visions come to fruition
A foolish faith devours life
Society plagued by the horror of the end,
revel in succession
Slaughtered in an instant, 
they'll be punished for believing
Slaughtered in an instant,
they'll be punished for their faith

The sun turns black, faith eclipsed, hope devoured
The moon, blood red, the stars fall like rain
Approaching the consequence
Restrained, you receive the mark of the beast
Soul bound, catastrophic fate

Futile attempts to resist
Your mortal flesh cast down
burning seas of the forth coming equinox
Plead for your essence, writhing in purgatory
Akashic recrods destroyed - Eminent wrath

The sun turns black, faith eclipsed, hope devoured
The moon, blood red, the stars fall like rain
Approaching the consequence
Restrained, you receive the mark of the beast
Soul bound, catastrophic fate

Drink the wine, wrath of god
Judgement fall upon you now
Eternal cries of death
Seed the mark of his name

Fallen through, fallen through sin
His mercy no longer pleads for your soul, plead for your soul
Engulfing elements of strife overrule, cast into flames
You are condemned to this eternal desolation
