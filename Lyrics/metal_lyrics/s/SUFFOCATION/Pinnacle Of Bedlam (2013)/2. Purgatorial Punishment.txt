Final Judgement, your judgement
Purgatorial Punishment

Suffer the karmic consequence
Exalted one, devours the deceased
World of purgation
Mirror of Karma-the naked soul

Denied pleas-souls beg
The impartial form, conjures unbound power

A passage to testify
State of disembodiment
Exoteric vows

A jury of deities
Determines your fate
The five messengers
Young, old, diseased, the punished, death
Desponders of truth
