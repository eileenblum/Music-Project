The blessing's curse, inversion of the truth
Imperious institutions
Enlightening, or distressing the threshold?
Prevalent degradation
Instinctive conciseness, demanding values of uncertainty
Immutable truths
Iconoclastic renunciation of the false less ness
Rearing expendable purity

Synthetic virtues
Seek out the truth
Foreboding state
Consumes relentlessly

Vital imprisonment
Malicious consequence
Concealed conviction
 Desire, fraud, rapture
Insist on the vast hypnosis
Tyranny everlasting
Escape your immortal soul
Distrust, disbelief, discord

The pain, the suffering, the fallacy

[SOLO: Hobbs]

Accursed obscurations of a blessing
Impious mystics lie perpetually
Controlling fate for centuries
influence of ignorance and illusion stage the ambush

The blessing's curse, inversion of the truth
Imperious institutions
Enlightening, or distressing the threshold?
Prevalent degradation
Instinctive conciseness,
demanding values of uncertainty, immutable truths
Iconoclastic renunciation of the false less ness
Rearing expendable purity
