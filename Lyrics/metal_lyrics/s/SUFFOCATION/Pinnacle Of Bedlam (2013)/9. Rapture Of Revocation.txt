Death lies within thyself
Eager to release itself
Imbued with a life
All it's own
Reckless signs of exclusion
Renounce one's thought
Of suicidal contempt

Despondent and unrelentless

Desire to achive
Sacrificial solace
Pitiful existence lends
A feeling of enrichment
To the other side
Peacefulness ensues
And eases the mind
Taste the nectar of gods

Death is only everlasting
Rapture of the revocation

Denounce the lies that hold you
Don't look to the heavens
For a savior trust in death and not in life

Demons welcome your flesh
Taste the blood and spill the wine
Reborn unto this world
Tip the scales that bind

Unholy lies now vilified
Raised from death and reassured
Your task is incomplete
Unholy lies

Death is only everlasting
Rapture of the revocation

Death is only everlasting
Rapture of the revocation
