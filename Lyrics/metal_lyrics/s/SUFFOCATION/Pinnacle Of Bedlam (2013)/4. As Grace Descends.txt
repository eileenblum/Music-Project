Man fell from his grace and strayed from the path
His anger now intolerable
Insidious behold the pale white horse
Hooded messenger of death is now set forth
His dismal gaze cripples souls
Renounce the seven deadly sins

The air unfit to breathe
The water poisoned by a blessing
Darkened skies witness the final sunset
Red rain showering from the heavens

As grace descends!

Barren lands diseased
Complete collapse of conditions
Burning, searing, putrid air
Inhale the toxic atmosphere
Asphyxiate, drown in blood
Boils the flesh and eat through tissue

Torrid winds,

Oceans freeze
Torrential acid rain
The ground quakes
Separates denying life
As grace descends

Volcanic debris consumes those left alive
Denying life
The extinction witness

...as grace descends
