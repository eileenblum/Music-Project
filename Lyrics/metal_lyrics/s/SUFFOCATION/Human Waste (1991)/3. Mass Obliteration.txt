Warfare, a promise to eliminate mankind.
The planet as we know it, taken by demented minds.
Warheads produced to exterminate the earth.
The sacrifice will lead us to our death, no rebirth.

No one has the power to declare this world to die.
Voting and electing the right to crucify.
Times of turmoil have decided what to do.
No need for common knowledge, we're through.

World explosion
Mass obliteration
... of a race.

Forced to live here day by day through day by day.
We dread the fear of living in the afterworld spirits of the dead.
Thoughts of nuclear holocaust that drive our world insane.
Woman and children forced and left to kill.

Through daily hibernation, manage to survive.
Sifting through, they must be found, extinction we provide.

PURIFY - the unholy land
EXTINCTION - the so called master race
CRUCIFY - the preachers of this hate
LIQUEFY - the minds of those they create.
