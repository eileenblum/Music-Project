A forgotten absolution remains within the shadows
Reborn and replenished to reflect sights unseen
The sins of the fallen will be exceeded by the sins of all
To cross through the kingdom of fire and blood
Possession of fate and destiny misplaced
Betrayal and abandonment embraced
Disingenuous fate for all to suffer
Force feed this hate to rise and to fall
The protection of all placed into the wrong hands
Mass deception passed down repeatedly

False impressions of truths instilled
Force of negativity, Doorway scrolls
Oath, beg, Absence, Redemption
Paranoid, abandonment, Betrayal, murder, genocide

Redemption, Rise above the pain and horror
To survive this reign of hell on earth
Remit absolution climb out of the shadows
Countless more souls will pass through

For those who rise and those who fall
Disingenuous life passed down to all
Grant you the pardon of all your sins
For those who rise and those who fall

Possession of fate and destiny misplaced
Betrayal and abandonment embraced

Force of negativity, Doorways, scrolls
Oath, beg, Absence, Redemption
Paranoid, abandonment, Betrayal, murder, genocide

Redemption
