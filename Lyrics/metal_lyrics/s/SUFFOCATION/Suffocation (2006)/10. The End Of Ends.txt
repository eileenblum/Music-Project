The end of ends, to solve the problem
The cause of death, the sum of our stricken lies
Natural selection, a dying dog will die

The old stray of the pack we weep in pity
To see the utter truth, believe in infamy
Destroy and conquer and lacerate humanity

Beneath the bowels of a hollow life they dwell
Without belief, isolations now reality
The end of ends is now indicative
So let the fatal wounds bleed

The end of ends our path is sanctified
Strangulation to rid ourselves of heresy
Altercations a cruel hand we strike
No remorse, plague and famine nullify
Thrones of blood and pain reside amongst the dead

Kill your own blood-shed, external dissident
Abolish life, no thought of human retrospect

Denounce their kin with strife, inside they hope we die
Breeding spawns you know will come sacrificed
Blind feeding shallow minds as souls are left denied

I strike the weak, Bloodshed resides over me
I strike the weak, Pawns left denied

An end to ends drains the souls who plead
Infected within the timeless slumber of those who heed
An end to ends drains the souls who plead
Infected within the timeless slumber of those who heed

The end of ends is now indicative
So let the fatal wounds bleed
The end of ends our path is sanctified
Strangulation to rid ourselves of heresy

The end of ends is now indicative
So let the fatal wounds bleed
The end of ends is now indicative
Suffocation to rid ourselves of heresy

I strike the weak
Bloodshed resides over me
I strike the weak
Pawns left denied
