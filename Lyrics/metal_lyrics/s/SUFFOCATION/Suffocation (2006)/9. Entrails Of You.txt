The many pleasures of the flash consummate my self indulgences
A being so beautiful as you tingles the senses and pushes one to defilement
Like the lamb to the slaughter what terrible things I would do to you,

You are so beautiful; I bathe myself in the entrails of you
Submerge myself in your blood and wear your flesh, you are so fucking beautiful
You are so beautiful; I bathe myself in the entrails of you

Entangled in a pile of flesh and blood warm yet cold at the same time
Now is the time to reflect on what could have been
Visions of delirium and blurs of misleading laughter cry out
At one moment the words that were once spoken muffled by the distance of passing soon become clear

You are so beautiful; I bathe myself in the entrails of you
Submerge myself in your blood and wear your flesh, you are so fucking beautiful
You are so beautiful; I bathe myself in the entrails of you

With the last whispers of breath left upon your lips
You still reach to call out as if to say something that once was meant
But it distorts my ears as it has no meaning anymore

What was that you were saying? I can't hear you
Speak up, what? Still not understanding
Sorry, Goodbye, goodbye
