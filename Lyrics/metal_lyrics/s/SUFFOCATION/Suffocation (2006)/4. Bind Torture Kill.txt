Torture provokes to divorce sanity
Horror mummifies victims who plead
Suicide tempts the mind of the mortal, sickened with grief
Godless fate, perception of the lie, debilitate the weak

Upon the altar of sacrificial bliss
I'm damned to be disposed in perpetual fire
Dismantled youth, forced and shaped my being
Predestined fate nurtures the act of sinning and drives me to

Blind torture kill, You judge my world
Your views have been mistaken
The sickness stems deeper than it seems

I bind to keep, Torture one to strengthen
And kill the weak who fail to meet the needs
Unstable diagnosis, detained to live a victim of myself
Predestined fate nurtures the act of sinning and drives me to

Bind torture kill, Crippled soul, Desensitized
Restraints impeded, Evolving my rage
Bind torture kill, Sanity diminishing
Internal wars desecrate, Re-haunting me
Lunacy dictates my being

Enslaved until my demise surrenders me
Until then I must feed the demons
Fuel my rage and commence haunting you

Bind torture kill, Disposed mental state
Confides my will to tolerate, My plea to help denied
You judge my world, Your views have been mistaken

This sickness stems deeper than it seems
I bind to keep, torture one to strengthen
And kill the weak who fail to meet the needs

I'm damned to be disposed in perpetual fire
Dismantled youth forced and shaped my being
Deafening voices fuel my actions
And drive me to bind torture kill
