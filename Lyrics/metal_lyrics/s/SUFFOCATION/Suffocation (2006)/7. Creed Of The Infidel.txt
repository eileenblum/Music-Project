Plead for your soul, my world is law
Uprise the tyrannous
Wars disguise and justify damnable needs
Re-haunting souls in graveyards of atrocities

Crippled in my mind... desecrate and alter the state of my faith
Conscience that's over-ruled, destroy and tarnish the will of one
Masses who mourn, curse, and despise and martyr beloved ones
Land that once bred our existence now holds the cold of crypts

Perpetrators of this dreadful evil still exist
Crippling fear alters the focus of life that is
Youth denied, exist in a state of war
Adapt or die as kids

Law of the infidel, kill or be killed
Goal of the infidel, destroy and rebuild
Reward of the chosen few, power we've gained
Fate shared by all, Pain, Pain, Pain

War scars traumatize and burn truth in flesh
Blood stains paint that led lives to death
land that once bred our existence now holds the cold crypts

Perpetators of this dreadful evil still exist
Crippling fear alters the focus of life that is trained to destroy your fate
And will, Kill or be killed

Law of the infidel, kill or be killed
Goal of the infidel destroy and rebuild
Reward of the chosen few, power we've gained
Fate shared by all, pain, pain, pain
