Souls, souls to deny 
Oppressed to a promised place 

To desire a place for you to die, unbeknownst to you thoroughly denied. 
Expectations of a fruitful way to live, ungodly not to be achieved by you. 
Evil lies, death denied 
cursed to walk this pitiful existence 
To be taught a certain way to be, 
let down by the powers consuming me 

Souls, souls to deny 
Oppressed to the promised place 

God has abandoned you pain and misery a gift to you. 
How do I deserve all this despite this unholy place 
Infliction of desires purging thoughts realized 

Souls, souls to deny 
Oppressed to a promised
