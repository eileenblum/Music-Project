Etched within the centuries, 
bequeathed upon the generations 
Litanies guide the baneful, 
serve the scourge of enmity 
Inheritants taught nothing less 
than absolute superiority 
Resurrecting what time has seen, pontificating savagery 

Echoes of ignorance 
Scrolls of hatred and prejudicial idolatry 
Words of malice scald the culture while raping society 

Spoken tales defile all purity 
History enshrines the absurd 
Forced to relive the insanity relive 
Revert the passages of time, unearth archaic ways 
Reset epoch's once dispersed, enslave rationality 
Exhibit the bleeding of man's ancient wounds 
Share this misguided pain, 
conjure the demons of the past 

Defy, fall to no demigod 
Blasphemous their theologies 
Inquisitions punish sinners, justify the genocide 
Cleanse the bastards, slay the torrid, 
rid the land of stained skin 
Words of insolence ordain the future 
Plauge the seed of morality 
Behold.....the tomes of acrimony 

Coercion steers domination, campaign segregation 
One feasts the victors fruits, 
serfs gorge the ample dirt 
Last gasps, stifled by the blood 
of intolerance's wrath 

Defy, beseech no demigod 
Subordinate, all distant creeds 
One creator to punish sinners, capitulate genocide 
Denounce the bastards, slay the torrid, 
slay all sons of stained skin 
Words of ignorance defend no logic 
Fuel the flames of idiocy 
Behold.....the tomes of acrimony
