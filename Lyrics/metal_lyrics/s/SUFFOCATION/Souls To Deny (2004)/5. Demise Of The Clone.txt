Damn the forgotten seeds 
inbred as a slave to habitual needs 
Souls consumed. 
Denied a response from a lifeless tomb 

Precious births 
Destruct to a plauge that infects the earth 
now regret the spawn unnurtured 
and feared to be dead by dawn 

Curse the consumed, born a salve 
reformed a distorted spawn of a masochist 
Deformities cripple and mold 
So you breathe but don't exist 
Internally decompose, 
skin erodes and exposes the skeletons 
damn the genes incestuously cloned 
to prey upon the innocent. 

Impotent, world demise 
Incarnate sacrifice 
feeble breed disposed in a world disowned 
Demise of the Clone 

Genocidal fate I impose, will reign upon you 
those who mourn fear for their own, 
mentally enslaved and subdued 
Landlords of the killing feilds, 
reuse plots of the decomposed 
Tombstones don't identify, 
A graveyard of the dormant souls 

Mass catacombs, putrefied lie beneath 
The uncivilized, disturbed and the weak 
under tyrants rule 
you cripple all under one throne of bones 
Demise of the clone 

Limitless, fiend to numb lets you breath but don't exist 

Labeled invalid your thoughts are consumed. 
Disposed, distorted, reformed a pawn 
in the face of doom. 

Internally decompose, skeletal image protrudes 
as your skin erodes 

Die succumb to the fate of your own 
Demise of the clone 

Insolent fool weak and retooled 
Born to society's mold 
Disrupting the order put in place what a dismal disgrace 
Besiege the innocent 
Reduced to ashes a clone reborn 
from the face of doom consume 
Impotent, world demise 
Incarnate sacrifice 
feeble breed disposed in a world disowned 
Demise of the Clone
