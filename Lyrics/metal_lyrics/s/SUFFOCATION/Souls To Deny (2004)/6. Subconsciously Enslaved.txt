Impure thoughts provoke my mind, 
undeniable deeds I implore 
Sickness helps fill the void, I feel I must react 

Is it me am I alone 
Is it me am I alone 

Why do I think this way have I been pushed to far 
Nothing makes sense to me really what does it all mean 

Is it me am I alone 
Is it me am I alone 

I feel I must release frustrations on the weak 
Inconceivable accomodations 
creep in my deviant thoughts 
Visions of devoured flesh 
sift through the awakened mind 
How would it feel to rip you in half 

To relinquish the mind may invoke a path 
Destined to bring oneself closer to the truth 
To deny these thoughts may rid you of insanity 
To taste the flesh that consumes you 

Subconsiously Enslaved 

Death is 
So close 
Can You 
Feel it 

Is it me am I alone 
Is it me am I alone 

Is it me am I alone 
Is it me am I alone 

I feel the pain 
Flooding the gates 
Open the mind 
Release the insane 
Snapping the chains 
To pick the lock 
Awaken thyself and release the hate
