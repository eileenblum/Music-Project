Sorrow fills my weeping eyes 
Plauge and famine revived 
Reaping the benefits of life's tomb 
Insolent your fate 
To weep once more 
To seal our fate, look at what we've done 
to this holy place 

Fought through the centuries of time 
Religious undertones befall the earth 
A god of everlasting peace 
Yet lives are lost to you 
Is there such a place as this 
Supposed equality amongst all beings 
To serve the allmightly one 

Plauge... another tool of demise 
Thin the weak and feeble to die 
Father, why have you forsaken me 
The child that sits upon your cross 
Molest the innocence to quench the thirst 

Representing the church an unholy curse 
Brought before judgement the eyes of hypocrisy 
An unfitting place this must be 

Sorrow fills my weeping eyes 
Plauge and famine revived 
Reaping the benefits of life's tomb 
Insolent your fate 
To weep once more 
To seal our fate, look at what we've done 
to this holy place 

Contrived a plan for all to die 
Mislead to believe your lies 
Does this not seem too harsh 
Slaughtering the lambs that are lost 

Famine... another tool of demise 
Starving the innocent left to die 
Father, why have you forsaken me
