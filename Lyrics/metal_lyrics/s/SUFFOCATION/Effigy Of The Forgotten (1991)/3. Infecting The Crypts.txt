Exhume the wretched body from its timeless slumber
Thrashing the tomb to reveal what's inside
A maggot-infected corpse stares dismal
Inhabited by worms chewing holes through your carcass

These ancient lands beckoned the burial of humans
The unfertile soil infecting the crypts
Of the once deceased bodies not through decomposure
Ending their peace, their chances of hell

A vomit-type substance is formed from its innards
A featering slims that reveals inside

The substance erupts and its stomach bursts open
Forced down your throat to regurgitate life
