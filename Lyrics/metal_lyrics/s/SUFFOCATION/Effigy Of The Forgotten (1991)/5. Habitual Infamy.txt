Pray in homage under shadows of ancestry
Conceptual lords above bathing in your inquiry
Memorizing thoughts through hallucinations of despair
Imminence burns within, plunge yourself to disrespect
Battred visions, desolation drips into your eyes
A feeling of oppresiveness that vastly clutters life
Deviation scarred within, placed upon you from your birth
Engage with destitution, as it rips into your mind

Morally detrimental
Incapacitated existence
Ignorant false worship

Exit all that's insincere
Rendered never to beleive, never to place trust again
Deny the coss you bear
Resisting all religion, resisting infirmities
Habitual infamy
Malignant infatuation
Reduces your will to live
Illusive reality
Images shred your mind to pieces
Deception crowds you
An infection of thoughts that god is there for you
Condemnation
Self-inflicted betrayal provoked by others

Sink in deep depression
States of mental turmoil
Abdiction enters
Sanity depletes
Paralyzing conflicts
Fear of retribution
Catastrophic frenzies
Burns within your mind

Sifting through delusions
Comatose with anguish
Tribulation drowns all hope
To live on

Purge your soul in hate
You're realizing you can't afford
Brace yourself til all resistance ends
Cut yourself and release the blood
