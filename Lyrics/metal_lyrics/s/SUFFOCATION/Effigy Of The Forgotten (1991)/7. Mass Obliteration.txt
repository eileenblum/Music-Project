Warfare, a promise to eliminate mankind
The planet as we know it, taken by demented minds
Warheads produced to exterminate the earth
This sacrifice will lead us to our death, no rebirth

No one has the power to declare this world to die
Voting and electing the right to crucify
Times of turmoil have decided what to do
No need for common knowledge, we're through

World explosion
Mass obliteration
...of a race

Forced to live here day by day through day by day
We dread the fear of living in the afterworld spirits of the
dead
Thoughts of nuclear holocaust that drive our world insane
Women and children forced and left to kill

Through daily hibernation, manage to survive
Sifting through, they must be found, extinction we provide

Purify - the unholy land
Extinction - the so called master race
Crucify - the preachers of this hate
Liquify - the minds of those they create
