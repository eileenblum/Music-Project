[Lyrics - Cerrito]
[Music - Hobbs/Cerrito]

Pain - Infliction - Loathing ways
Excursions into harsh reality
Scorn - Diaspora - I'm now forced to be this way
Torrents of delusion - Placid winds erase

Torn away from the truth of my inner self
Life replaced, despise the sun that breeds disgrace
Wretched visions of a life that could never be

Gloom - Depression - Disarray
Conviction shrouded by malignancy
Visions scream forth - Corruption welcomes
Grasping at salvation in hopes of an escape
Retribution - Evoking rage
Resurgance through a lust for apathy
Cleanse - Unshackle - Pressure builds can't take the strain
Onward to defiance - Banish with disdain

Torn away from the truth of my inner self
Life replaced, despise the sun that breeds disgrace
Wretched visions of a life that could never be

Shatter illusion - Shed my confusion
Release possession to this regression
Permeate the rival, Glorified despisal
Dethrone conception, Sever intention
Release possession to this regression
Shatter illusion - Shed my confusion
Release possession to this regression

Pain - Infliction - Loathing ways
Excursions into harsh reality
Visions scream forth - Corruption welcomes
Grasping at salvation in hopes of an escape
Retribution - Evoking rage
Resurgance through a lust for apathy
Cleanse - Unshackle - Pressure builds can't take the strain
Onward to defiance - Banish with disdain
