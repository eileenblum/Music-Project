Evil dwells within the inner sanctum of the mind. Each person has a
piece of the puzzle locked inside. It only takes the right key to
open the subconscious. Once inside, it feeds like a leech sucking
the blood of an organism.
Until the whole body is infected with the disease. The mind then
becomes cluttered with cloudy visions of death, killings and all
other satanic biddings. It begins to affect thr train of thought.
The limbs cease to function, they tend to run amok. Reaching out to
grab a utensil of death.
Maybe starting with a finger or toe.
Once you've started, you can't withhold yourself from continuing.
The pain you feel is a mere infractioin of the evil that dwells
within your head.

You must continue to rid yourself of the dreaded disease. Maybe if
you cut it out, the eye of the plague that sweeps across your body,
you could be whole again.
In order to tear this part of yourself, would bare to die a painful
death.
It would include opening the skull cavity and removing the brain.
An unspeakable horror that no being could handle.

Yet you feel as if this were your only hope.
Your prepare yoursefl for surgery.
Scalpel in hand, you thrust into the scalp.

The pain is unberable, but you continue making the incision.
With drill in hand, you find the seed of the demon inside.
Blood spews over the walls as you drill deeper.
