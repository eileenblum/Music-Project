Tattooed from  the camps that mark your existance on a planet
deranged from the minds of the Reds. Inferior race awaiting the
moment when you are dismissed from your service in life. Captive in
torment, the merciless slaughter of souls misfortuned at birth.
Taken from wombs before they are nurtured, subjected to torture
unknown. Where bodies once lay, the ground in now fertile to sprout
the tree of damnation. A sign of remembrance that brings forth the
hatred which haunts the deceivers of life. This deadly disease which
goes through one man, to speak upon one as inferior. Their heads
will hang low because in time they will acknowledge the human race
as the superior. Families incarcerated commit spousal murder to
avoid the sightly pain of their loved ones. Abducted while sane, now
insane, not by choice, It was forced by the crisis of murder.
Constant infanticide plagues loving mothers as their newborn is
placed in a bed of dead roses.
