I sit as tomorrow I die and today I will unburden my soul
These events have tortured me and destroyed me
I can still hear her faint screams engulfed in the atmosphere around me
The stench of ammonia still encircles the room where her disemboweled corpse lies
One night returning home, much intoxicated, I fancied my wife to avoid me

I seized her with, with the fury of a demon instantaneously possessed
I knew myself no longer
My original soul,
At once to leave my body and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fiber of my frame
At an instant,
I grabbed the knife from the kitchen and left incision from ear to ear
In turn, her limp weak corpse fell instantaneously

I in return having received much pleasure from the initial blow
Had begun to cut into her abdomen
Once inside I began exploring the regions of her innards
The warm blood still running,
The warm blood still running down my hands is cold and damp.

I began to remove her intestines, stopping to take a little nibble or two
Her uterus seems to mesmerize me as I bury my head into it
And lose myself into a world of the subconscious
For now I know the many pleasures of my wife
And I will soon be joining her
