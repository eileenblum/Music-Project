From my soul
I dispose the weak
Enslave, all kings left dethroned
I pronounce
My oath in Blood

Withdrawn from my veins I spill
An existence defined
By the paths I saturate

Laws you impose
Get overruled
Irrelevant ways of the fools
Sentenced before higher courts
I'm self detained,
In ways you judge not

Detours denied,
Tell tales, of masses who failed
Unearth and incinerate the old
Feeble ways

From my soul
I dispose the weak
Enslave, all kings left dethroned
I pronounce
My oath in Blood

Bleed the fucking truth
Or die by the fraud
That's become of you
Denounce clones and amongst
Kings, who use the flame and burn

Blood in, blood out
Blood in, blood out

Detours denied,
Tell tales, of masses who failed
Unearth and incinerate the old
Feeble ways

Bleed for the oath taken
Bleed for the oath taken

Detours denied,
Tell tales, of masses who failed
Unearth and incinerate the old
Feeble ways

From my soul
I dispose the weak
Enslave, all kings left dethroned
I pronounce
My oath in Blood
