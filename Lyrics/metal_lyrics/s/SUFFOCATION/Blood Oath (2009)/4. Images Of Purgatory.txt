Darkness falls covering the day
Ghoulish figures
move between the shadows
unexplained voices come from nowhere
Caught between here and there
Left over fragments repeat
A life once lost over and over.

[Solo: Hobbs / Marchais]

Disturbing images unfold
Tortures figures
recreate a deed
Evil is the host this night
Demonic sounds
consume the darkness

Darkness falls covering the day
Ghoulish figures
move between the shadows
unexplained voices come from nowhere
Caught between here and there
Left over fragments repeat
A life once lost played over and over.

As they prey upon the living
concede made flesh delivers to he
transpondent unremorseful plea
relinquish thy soul and transcend forth

Between here and now
deliver unto darkness
befall the pits of despair
and rise from the shadows
to reclaim an heir.
Sit upon my side to rule.
