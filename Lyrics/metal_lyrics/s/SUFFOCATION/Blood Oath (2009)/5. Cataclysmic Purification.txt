A calamitous future-
warning cries of inhuman terror
as time elapses
a period of purification draws near.
Those who survive
will endure endless
dark periods of spaces and time

Visionary - profound

The wounds of all
have become one

Rise to power
Ominous games of slaughter
a future yet to unfold
Fire and swords
shall sweep the land
the end of time
this unnumbered
the terrible judge
will judge his people.
Indigenous events plague

Indigenous events plague
first light of wisdom
the 4th world will end
and the 5th will begin
Cataclysmic changes
will soon be upon us.

Disillusion
The world will be set on fire
the great day of purification
Upheaval
period of worthy change.
