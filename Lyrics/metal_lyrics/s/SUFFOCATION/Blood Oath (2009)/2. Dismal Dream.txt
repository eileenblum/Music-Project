Violently ripped
from the arms of my bliss.
An end to what is,
life's dismissed.
My screams, my pain,
I am no longer sane
how can this be
the end of my reign?

What have I done
to deserve all of this?
In the blink of an eye
all things have changed
and how will I make it through all this?
This nightmare
that I cannot wake from.

My dismal dream
I live and breathe
I realize
I cannot leave

Embracing this plane of insane
mental state
of strange confusion-
consumes me whole
and somehow
I'm trapped here
within perceiving no escape
wretched horror wraps my fate

My dismal dream
I live and breathe
I realize I cannot leave

Dismal dream
impressions of fear
deception of self,
am I stuck here?
Made to see,
soul stripped from me
no chance of escape

My dismal dream
I live and breathe
I realize
I cannot leave
I cannot leave

Sanity Collapses
in the blink of an eye
irrational behavior
manifests from inside

Violently ripped
from the arms of my bliss.
An end to what is,
life's dismissed.
My screams, my pain,
I am no longer sane
how can this be
the end of my reign?
