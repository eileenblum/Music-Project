A lifetime of misdeeds
has lead you to me
you've made your last mistake.
This time you won't get away.

[Solo: Hobbs]

I'll see to it
that these are you last breaths,
and strip the life with my bare hands.
You never saw me coming,
now I've got you
It's gone on too long, this time it ends.

And now I'm to take your life,
and still this will not rectify
what have you down.
What have you done?
To torture the soul, undeserving
seems to be the only way,
to solve your unjust ways

A lifetime of misdeeds
has lead you to me
you've made your last mistake.
This time you won't get away.

You never saw me coming,
now I've got you
Now that I have you,
I'll do as I please staring into me
while these hands
grip around your throat
Your life flashing before you,
how could this have happened?
I clench, tighter and tighter,
Staring into your blood filled eyes.
I know what you want to say,
but I care not to hear

You cannot undo what you've done,
this is forever. Theres no going back,
you did this to yourself,
through a life mis-lived
and no one can save you now

Holding on,
tightly gripped
Realize that this is my last resort
latched on to what is worthless
it ends here and now

What can you possibly be thinking?
As these eyes stare into yours...
Is this happening to me?
Here and now?
Undeserving.
