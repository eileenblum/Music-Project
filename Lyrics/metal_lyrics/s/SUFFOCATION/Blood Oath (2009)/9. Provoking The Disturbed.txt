Scarred souls, remain raw
Unveiling my world as blood soaked

Mankind, Expired paralyzed
Broken by the doctrines imposed
civilized breed
A myth portrayed
to pacify and enslave

Starve the basic needs
Of born kings
classified as insane.
lies are thy mask of the cowards
faceless beings.

Fear
Unveils your weak feeble beliefs
you dare diagnose those
who obey no laws
As disturbed and unstable
Though the strength of the lunatics
will survive
Thee apocalyptic wars.

Truth. We're all insane
my hands are tied, restrained
Truth, define your truth
reality reigns in pain
PROVOKING THE DISTURBED!

Desensitized behavior, ensures
I despise equally
release is my, savior
from confined masochistic beliefs

Civilized breed
a myth portrayed
to pacify and enslave
Starve the basic needs of born kings
classified as insane.

[Solo: Marchais / Hobbs]

Lies truth be untold
Impressions of lawless society.
Clash of the evident curse.
Demise of those who are out spoken.
Chaotic reign of the insane.
Lies truth be untold
Impressions of lawless society.

Scarred souls, remain raw
Unveiling my world as blood soaked

Mankind, expire paralyzed
broken by the doctrines imposed
Lies, are the mask of the cowards
faceless beings.

Fear
Unveils your weak feeble beliefs
you dare diagnose those
who obey no laws
as disturbed and unstable

Though the strength of the lunatics
will survive
thee apocalyptic wars.

Truth, we're all insane
my hands are tied, restrained
Truth, define your truth
Reality reigns in pain
PROVOKING THE DISTURBED!
