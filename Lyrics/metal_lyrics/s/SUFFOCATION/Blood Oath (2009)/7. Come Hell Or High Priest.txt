Enemies from the womb
hypocrites will consume
tales they claim
shall guide our lost souls.

Sodomized by your priest
consoled though punished
Slaves before your lord

Effigies
slowly burn
Disdained, views you preach
threaten mankind
Restrain the god fearing
Sickening masses
zombifies existence
run from fear
through prayer.

COME HELL OR
COME HELL OR HIGH... PRIEST

Ignorance
Thee oblivion of bliss
Search untraceable gods
Is there, no other... means to breathe...
Content as a sinner?

Impending wrath of truth
drive my mind to burn
My own... Law and existence
reign on all deserved

[Solo: Marchais]

Impending wrath of truth
drive my mind to burn
My own... Law and existence
reign on all deserved

Shroud of deceit
Unravel and crumble at the feet of...
sickening masses not questioning
like sheep led to slaughter
Truth and death the only permanence
death the only truth

Demise creeps in and fills the skies
it's heavy reality should open your eyes
zombified progression towards a cliff
Ignorance their oblivion of bliss

Shroud of deceit
Unravel and crumble at the feet of...
sickening masses not questioning
like sheep led to slaughter
Truth and death the only permanence
death the only truth

Enemies from the womb
hypocrites will consume
tales they claim
shall guide our lost souls
Sodomized by your priest
consoled though punished
Slaves before your lord
Effigies
slowly burn
Disdained, views you preach
threaten mankind

Restrain the god fearing
Sickening masses alienate the truth
COME HELL OR HIGH... PRIEST
