Harbringer of death and slaughter -
(next time round you'll be the slain)
Refuse the dying man your water -
(thirst when you come back again).
Don't spare the rod don't spoil the child -
(I hope you like to take a beating)
Feed your face while others starve -
(you'd better learn to not miss eating.)

Shining beaty - fair and wise,
Has served it's time as dim an sallow
An honest judge seeks truth through eyes
Which once gazed lifeless from the gallows.
Hands that heal the sick and lame,
Long since held tools of inquisition.
Tongues which speak words true and sane
Have chanted sermons on perdition.

[Chorus:]
Cross the bridge that spans forever
Living thread of evermore.
Without begining ending never,
Living thread of evermore
See the footprints in the sand
Countless lifetimes gone before,
Point our path with unseen hands
The living thread of evermore.

From egg and sperm 'neath sticky sheet,
To ash and bone or maggot meat,
The way looks neither pleasant or too long
So have you stopped to wonder whether
If when weighted against a feather,
All your deeds appear so big and strong?

Cross the bridge that spans forever
Living thread of evermore.
Without begining ending never,
Living thread of evermore
See the footprints in the sand
Countless lifetimes gone before,
Point our path with unseen hands
The living thread of evermore.

Light and dark complete the circle
Find the yang to fit the Yin
Barren desert - lush green myrtle
Chase the wind to lift your wing

From egg and sperm 'neath sticky sheet,
To ash and bone or maggot meat,
The way looks neither pleasant or too long
So have you stopped to wonder whether
If when weighted against a feather,
All your deeds appear so big and strong?

Cross the bridge that spans forever
Living thread of evermore.
Without begining ending never,
Living thread of evermore
