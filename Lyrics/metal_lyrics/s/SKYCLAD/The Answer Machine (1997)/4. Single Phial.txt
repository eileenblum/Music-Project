[Lyrics: Martin Walkyier]
[Music: Steve Ramsey]

I have walked the earth so many times before your birth,
Today is only yesterday's tomorrow.
And as a Gardner in Eden it was i who sowed the seed then
I've come to reclaim this life you borrow.

Singing 'ring a ring o' rosies' for your final lullabye,
Have you any prayers to make before you wave your last goodbye ?
I bring 'a pocket full o' posies' - lay a wreath to ease my guilt,
As the light's go out forever not one drop of blood was spilt.

[Chorus:]
As yet unwritten history -
Once more i stride the lightning road
Identity a mystery -
My burden is Pandora's load.
Traversing endless centuries -
Disguised behind Death's lipless smile,
I hide that my intention is to pour this single phial.

I'd have rather seen your face almost any other place
Still here we meet - always the way in this profession
And as i gaze into your eyes - i see the glimer within dies,
From ther moment i first make my dark confession.

How could i swear i would be there for you, until your dying day,
Certain in the knowledge that it's not that far away?
So you leave me sitting here bewildered as a new dead ghost,
While i try to justify destroying that which i love most.

As yet unwritten history -
Once more i stride the lightning road
Identity a mystery -
My burden is Pandora's load.
Traversing endless centuries -
Disguised behind Death's lipless smile,
I hide that my intention is to pour this single phial.

The dark millenium is ending - final daze of the decayed
And a reign of tears is falling - it's the judgement eve parade.
Though I wash my hands a thousand times - still the guilt remains,
She stole my heart - I took her life ...
(And yet i never knew her name).

As yet unwritten history -
Once more i stride the lightning road
Identity a mystery -
My burden is Pandora's load.
Traversing endless centuries -
Disguised behind Death's lipless smile,
I hide that my intention is to pour this single phial.

Out with a whimper - not with a bang.
And they all gathered round while the church bell rang.
Singing 'bring out your dead' they 'll stretch for miles,
To be bourne to their graves in single files.

[Chorus:]
As yet unwritten history -
Once more i stride the lightning road
Identity a mystery -
My burden is Pandora's load.
Traversing endless centuries -
Disguised behind Death's lipless smile,
I hide that my intention is to pour this single phial.
