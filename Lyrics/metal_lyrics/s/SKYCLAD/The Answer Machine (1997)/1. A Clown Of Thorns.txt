Walking my personal Calvary mile to a do-it-yourself crucifixion,
It's a kingdom of clowns wearing martyrdom's frown -
I must fight for my hammer and nails,
We're an endless procession of lost, dispossessed unbelievers -
Whose prayers go unheard and unanswered,
(unheard and unanswered like junk mail for Jesus).
