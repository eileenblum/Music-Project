You say i'm a free man,
But what does that mean to a social security number?
A grey suit as sharp as a new guillotine,
Bought and paid for while drugging us under

Tell me what use is a citizens charter -
When blood is the ink for the new Magna Carta?
Sci-fi style weapons in feudal societies
Fingers on buttons that twich with anxiety

[Chorus:]
Brought to our knees by the powers that maybe,
Don't care if humanity lives or it dies.
You're alright Jack - so you pulled up the ladder
And hook, line and sinker you swallowed their lies.

Now it seems that the truth is not easy to say
Mouth stuffed with the goodies they sample.
Stripped by their mistresses - tied up and flayed
Like pye-dogs that would lead by example

Not enough answers - and cash payed for questions
Waste paper baskets - filled with good suggestions
Show me a promise they made that has lasted
Successes have fathers - but failure's a bastard

[Chorus:]
Brought to our knees by the powers that maybe,
Don't care if humanity lives or it dies.
You 're alright Jack - so you pulled up the ladder
And hook, line and sinker you swallowed their lies.

Your Motto was 'in god we trust - all others pay by cash'
You hide beneath oak tables when the windows start to smash
The natives are revolving open season on the scum
Sit back and wait forever for the Eirenarch to come
Rich and poor divide the classes, instigate two types of law
Making ninteen nineties Heaven feel like 1984
Your finger on the trigger of a 12-bore in the dark
When justice knocks upon your door send for the Eirenarch.
