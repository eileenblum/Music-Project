[Lyrics: Martin Walkyier]
[Music: Graeme English]

It's a mountain that we all must climb,
In giant leaps or one step at a time.

I saw a fat, old money lender - shoes of silk and ermine,
Laughing as they stambled on blistered feet rough shod.
He never helped the poor and weak - viewed them all as vermin,
So when he fell they passed him by and struggled up to god.

Each of us must walk a different track -
No sign to guide us and no turning back.

[Chorus:]
Humanity in motion - it's the pilgrimage eternal.
Most are blind - But i suspect what rare few know is real.
"You carry me, i'll carry you" this simple childish notion.
A cable car to Shangrai-La,
Your worn up soul to heal.

The soldier boy is marching proud (with military precision)
Kicking others from the path - so keen to reach the peak.
Never will he get there with this tactical decision -
He spends so much time fighting that each footstep takes a week.

Carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero,
Persta et obdura - omnia vincit amor!

My money's on the holy man - just clad in sack and sandals
Heard a small child crying there - so turned around and stopped.
Like a beacon now he shines (bright as a million candles)
Alone upon the summit when the selfish have all dropped.

It's no contest - but we still race there
Like the saintly tortoise and the godless hare.

Humanity in motion - it's the pilgrimage eternal.
Most are blind - But i suspect what rare few know is real.
"You carry me, i'll carry you" this simple childish notion.
A cable car to Shangrai - La,
Your worn up soul to heal.

You're worn up sole to heal,
Your worn up soul too ...
Heal your worn up soul.
