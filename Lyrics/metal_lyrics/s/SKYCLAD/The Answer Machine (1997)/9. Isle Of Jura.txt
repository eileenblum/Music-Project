All around me strangers scurry -
In a crowd but all alone.
Got to hurry - pack my worries,
Feel the arms that I call home.

I am lonely - I am lost,
Inside my private holocaust.

[Chorus:]
O' steel angel please carry me -
Fly me to my love,
From cold Earth far beneath me
To the Heavens high above.

All aboard but fly so-low
(Chocks away) The engines start.
Crossing oceans of emotion that circumnavigate my heart.

Have you ever talked to someone,
Not recalled a single word?
The gentle rhythm of the humdrum,
It was the only sound i heard.

Why was I not so astute to stow
My dreams a parachute?

O' steel angel please carry me -
Fly me to my love,
From cold Earth far beneath me
To the Heavens high above.

It seems they never sensed how time was passing,
Deep in the silence and the cold.
Sat living, breathing, drinking, laughing -
While Death lay sleeping in the hold.

Then my eyes beheld a vision,
A beaty Brighter than the Stars
One singe spark - and then ignition,
Bathe my flesh and heal the scars.

The hand that dared to touch God's knife,
But 'Isle Of Jura' - I love life.

O' steel angel please carry me -
Fly me to my love,
From cold Earth far beneath me
To the Heavens high above.
