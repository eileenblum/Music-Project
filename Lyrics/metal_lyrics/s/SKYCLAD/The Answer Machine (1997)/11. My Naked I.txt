I wish that you could know one day the secrets I've been keeping,
Of the demons I have locked away - they prowl a one track mind.
If you had thought this tongue in cheek was just reserved for speaking
one hour at my sweet mercy would be sure to send you blind.

Speeding through the darkness of this endless Friday night,
In a body with one drunk and careless owner.
There is nobody home - but all the light are shining brightly,
How I'd love to wake beside you when it's over.

[Chorus]
Yearning serpent - sharp foretooth,
I ache to taste of nacked youth.
The fleeting glance I can't forget,
Could make of me an agapet.
The reins that bridle my desire -
grow flimsier than your attire.
Feeling brave? - then come and try to stare into my naked I.

Like a spider with a fly upon her web -
come wrap those legs around me.
Deflower me - devour me,
My veins aglow with blood like liquid fire.
I'm a willing victim - gagged and bound down on your altar of seduction,
Awaiting my destruction in the all consuming flames of raw desire.

I fear I should be boiled in oil just for these thoughts I'm thinking,
If you'd be my new hobby I could give up DIY.
I've just one vice in life - but how its jaws long to be sinking,
In the flesh of Eden's apple with some subtle succubi.

I'd say without a doubt you're the best sex I never had,
Cause in my dreams you wear a necklace white and pearly.
Make mine a triple bromide on the rocks please - (stirred and shaken),
Should I wait 'til it's too late - or come too early?

Yearning serpent - sharp foretooth,
I ache to taste of naked youth.
The feeling glance I can't forget,
Could make of me an agapet.
The reins that bridle my desire -
grow flimsier than your attire.
Feeling brave? - then come and try to stare at my naked I.
