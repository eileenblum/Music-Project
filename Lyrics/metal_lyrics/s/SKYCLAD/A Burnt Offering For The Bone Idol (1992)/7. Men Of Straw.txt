I pray that soon the blessed meek their world shall inherit
When all of these bastards are judged by their merits
And called to account for the acts they've commited
The jury their victims - no sins are omitted.

I'd gladly burn these men of straw who beat the weakest hardest
They sow the seeds of misery - let children reap the harvest
The "lowest of the low" are they - not fit to share our planet
They are not men but beasts indeed, so take this beast and hang it.

Suffer the children - unseen and unheard
Who live in the dark closets where skeletons stirred
Behind mental parapets feelings lay hidden
They cried out for nothing - and nothing were given.

Why is it so hard to comprehend
They should not be released to re-offend?
I think instead that they should take the place
Of the animals dissected by this so called "Human Race."

The time has come to take these scum and set a fine example
The only problem is - I fear no punishment is ample
Now I am not a violent man - but it would give me pleasure
To watch these vermin crucified (then kill them at my leisure).

They rob the young of innocence and then show no repentance
We should relieve them of their lives - the crime befits the sentence
Instead set free to hurt again for reasons I can't figure
Just line them all against the wall and let me pull the trigger.
