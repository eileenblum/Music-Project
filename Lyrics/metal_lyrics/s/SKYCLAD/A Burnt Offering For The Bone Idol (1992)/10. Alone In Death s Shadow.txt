Carnal gladiators lie restless awaiting the dawn
Slaves to their passion - so eager its will to perform
They wrestle the "Double Backed Beast" face their foe hand to hand
The arena was life but alone in deaths shadow they stand.

You brand the social leper - then spare no second thought
Too scared to give this kiss of life - "Come rise my son and walk."

On these streets of damnation the destitute huddle once more
Can we pass them by just like all who have been there before?
Are you so cold and heartless you can feel no shame
That we allow a human life to become a death in vein.

A fear that's bred of ignorance perpetuates the lie
Well there but for the mercy and the grace of God go I.

Prisoners in a sterile vacuum - hearts that feel but dare not touch
The freak show in this callous circus - on parade so all may look
Those who gaze upon the outcasts to taste how bitter life can be
Can't comprehend the pain you feel - their blinkered eyes will never see.
