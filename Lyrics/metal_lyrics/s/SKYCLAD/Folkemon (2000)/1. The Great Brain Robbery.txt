Why do you still refuse to see,
this vast global conspiracy,
that's infiltrating lives and homes?
(A race replaced by servile drones).

Chips are down and stakes are high,
milk-shake minds are sucked bone dry.
If their fiendish schemes should fail,
they'll smoke us all - but won't inhale!

The evidence was there,
beneath our noses all the time.
We're too gullible to care,
they conceived the perfect crime....
The Great Brain Robbery.

Met my neighbour one fine morning;
spoke of planetary warming.
She looked at me and laughed;
wait and see who's laughing last.
Dread to think how deep they stoop,
dredging for new dopes to dupe.
Plots so blatant yet sublime;
fool all the people all the time.

False prophets ever lie,
of non-existent better days.
Then as judgement hour draws nigh,
they make their hasty getaways....
The Great Brain Robbery.

Leaders of united nations,
speeches preached from t.v. stations.
Truth or falsehood - no one cares,
All just want to be millionaires.

Armed with charm the slick of wit,
contort each thought - waive every writ.
Devise new means to beat the charge,
disguised 'neath urbane camouflage.

They subjugate free-will,
with intolerance and strife.
Won't be content until,
They own your money and your life....
The Great Brain Robbery.
