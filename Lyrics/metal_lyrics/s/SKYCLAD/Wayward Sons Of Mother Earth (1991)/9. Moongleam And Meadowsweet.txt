See her face shine in the moonlight--
Soft as silk and white as cream,
Silently I watch her slumber--gently kiss her cheek,
Then I lay my weary head beside hers--close my eyes and dream.
In the morning she'll awake--
Cast off the night and shine like summer,
As she dances all about me she sparkles like a stream,
Her hair is full of meadowsweet--she's wrapped in leafy green.
On bended knee before you with tears in my eyes,
I pledge that till my dying day my sword is on your side--
Forever on your side.
And I love you more than life--
I swear that you mean everything to me,
Everything I'd sacrifice--
If my lady you would favour me.
Far brighter than the stars your smile,
You hold the richest sunset in those eyes--
You are England.
Fear not lady I'll defend you--
In your cause lay down my life,
When 'concrete dragons' threaten they shall see my mettle gleam,
And die if they should try to steal your cloak of leafy green.
Of all the things worth dying for--
None sweeter have I seen,
Than the rose that is my England--
In her cloak of leafy green.
