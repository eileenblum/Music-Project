[Intro:]  'Megeddo's Gateway.'
Hunter of the silent darkness--
Mighty steel leviathan,
Rise from your nocturnal vigil--
'Davey Jones' the time has come.
Send spitting fires and roaring thunder--instigate Poseidon's wrath,
Unleash the terrors of the deep uncertain of the aftermath.
Attack is the best form of defense--fingers on a keyboard play,
When genocide's a numbered sequence death is but a breath away.
I. I hear sirens screaming--
C. See lightning rip the sky,
B. Be afraid my darling--
M. Embrace me as we die.
Dark clouds gather (tensions mounting)--current tides are making waves,
They navigate a sea of tears--above them storms in tea-cups rage.
Only Jonah 'neath the ocean witnesses the damage done,
But can't turn back the hands of time--none can unload a smoking gun.
I. I hear sirens screaming--
C. See lightning rip the sky,
B. Be afraid my darling--
M. Embrace me as we die.
The lords of Fleet Street speculate--as noble statesmen mediate,
They tread on thin ice cracked by hate--one slip could spell disaster.
We gave you power to decide--but now you gamble with our lives,
We've all been taken for a ride--next stop the hereafter.
These implements of science-friction--
Are the pawns of power play,
By splitting hairs and splitting atoms--
They'll kill us all the 'new-clear' way.
Entice us through Megeddo's gateway on this final exodus,
As flesh is turned to ash and vapour by the fires of 'terminus.'

'They are as sick that surfeit with too much, as they that starve with nothing.'
William Shakespeare (The Merchant of Venice).
