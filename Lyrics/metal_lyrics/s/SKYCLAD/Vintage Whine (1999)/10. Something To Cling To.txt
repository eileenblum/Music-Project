Sometimes life feels like an ocean,
cruel and far too cold to mention.
Though you raise a great commotion - still no-one pays you attention
There's no sail on the horizon,
when the shark-fins gather near,
you watch your chances of surviving scuppered -
(sink, then disappear),

[CHORUS:]

All I need, all you need, all we need, is something to cling to.
(Watch your chances disappear when the shark-fins gather near),
All I need, all you need, all we need, is something to cling to.
As your 'fair-weather-friends' stand waving,
from the comfort of their yacht,
(it's strange how when you needed saving
they conveniently forgot).
The countless times you've stopped them sinking,
fought to keep their lives afloat,
and hauled them upwards, (without thinking).
to the safety of your boat.

[CHORUS:]

AIl I need, all you need, all we need, is something to cling to
(Fight to keep your life afloat - far from the safety of your boat)
All I need, all you need, all we need, is something to cling to

So tired and numb - your limbs now weaken
and you slowly start to wonder;
Should I not admit I`m beaten,
let these waters drag me under?
Feel a peace and calm descending,
ceasing fears, and cares, and crying.
Knowing that your life is ending,
reconcile yourself to dying.

Then as if from out of nowhere.
(and just when you least expected).
floats a single piece of driftwood - by some unseen force directed
It's a gift life often brings you.
when you thought all hope long gone.
sometimes a single dream to cling to.
gives you strength to carry on.

It seems the wisest words that I know,
(three which some dead scholar wrote)
are simply these: - "Dum spiro spero"
meaning; "WHILE I BREATHE I HOPE".

[CHORUS:]

All I need. all you need, all we need, is something to cling to,
(The wisest words man ever wrote are simply "While I breathe I hope").
All i need, all you need, all we need, is something to cling to.
