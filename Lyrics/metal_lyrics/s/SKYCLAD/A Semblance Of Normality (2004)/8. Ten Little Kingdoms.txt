'One united kingdom the fancied wouldn't do
To please some grumbling Irishme, they split it into two
Two little kingdoms, but then the Scots, you see
Claimed their anciant throne and rights, then they were three
Three little kingdoms but then one more
For Welshman claimed a parliament and then they were four
Four little kingdoms wouldn't do at all !
One of them was far too big; the others were too small'

And this is the price we'll pay
Take a lesson from your history
'Divide and conquer is the game they play'
And this is the price we'll pay

'All across Great Britain anciant hates revived
Cornwall wants to rule herself, and then they were five
Five little kingdoms, but London is a fix
Raised the 'southern english' flag, and then they were six
Six little kingdoms, the 'Home rule' heaven
Caused a rising in the West, and then they were seven
Seven little kingdoms Northmen wouldn't wait
Hailed Northumbria and then they were eight'

And this is the price we'll pay
Take a lesson from your history
'A house divided simply cannot stand'
And this is the price we'll pay

'And the towns that one may visit via the Eastern county line
Formed East Anglia and then they were nine
Nine little kingdoms never could agree
How to work together and so they went free
Ten little kingdoms too weak to stand alone
A foreign nation conquered them, then they were gone'

And this is the price we'll pay
Take a lesson from your history
'Devolution is the devil's ploy'
And this is the price we'll pay
