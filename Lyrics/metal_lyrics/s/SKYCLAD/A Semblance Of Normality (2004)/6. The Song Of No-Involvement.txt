We're building up to nothing
Can make it last all day
They're handing out the pitchforks
To keep the tide at bay
Through time and tide will never wait
We'll stand our ground and celebrate :

A song of no involvement
A show of no-concern
A song of no involvement
We're far too good to burn

Well indolence is blissful
Employment is the curse
Once bitten makes you work shy
You've gone from bad to worse
The winds of change whatever they they bring
We'll turn our backs and learn to sing :

A song of no involvement
A picture of restraint
A song of no involvement
The world will have to wait

'A sense of within which knoweth sin
And makes you pay with guild each day'
That still small voice inside your head

To those wo look for answers
Or seek to rule the roost
Go sign your 'ignoramus'
Cos we're the living proof
Live and let live and learn to forgive
Come Heaven or Hell, we'll join in with :

A song of no-involvement
A testament to sloth
A song of no-involvement
Sounds good upon my oath

A song of no-involvement
This life is such a farce
A song of no involvement
The world can kiss my arse
