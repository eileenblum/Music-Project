Wall "the west' wakes up to a terror attack
But they got enough muscle to give it right back
Now the warmongers are happy they know that they can't lose
They picked a good day for to bury the bad news

And all the latest figures talk of rising crime
While offenders are released before they've served their time
But they'rehappy down in Brussels
They know that we can't choose
They picked a good day for to bury the bad news

We've got a military stand-off
While they can't agree the peace
And political solutions
Are always out of reach

A giant asteroid passed close by last night
Well this one didn't hit us but the next one might
But the scientists are puzzled they're looking for the clues
They picked a good day for to bury the bad news

While all floods and famine
And the cyclone's rage
Of biblical prportions
Can't even make the front page

I said 'Hold on a second, there's a late on the newsflash'
Billions wiped off as the 'high-techs' crash
But the ministers are happy they know that they can't lose
They picked a good day for to bury the bad news

They can't bury the bad news, they can't bury the bad news
They can't bury the bad news, they can't bury the bad news
