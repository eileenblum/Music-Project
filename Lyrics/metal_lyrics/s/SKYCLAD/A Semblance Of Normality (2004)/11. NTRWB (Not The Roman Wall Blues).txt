Hey Mr Auden have you hear the news ?
Seems they found a cure for your Roman Wall Blues
Says on the tablets that they sent back home
They got dates, wine and olives direct from Rome

They got baths and medicines I've been told
To cure your lice and care for your cold
And if your eyes are sore for the rain or mist
You can always sign up to th old sick list

Downtown Corbridg on Saturday night
Find a local lassie to treat you right

So hey, Mr Auden let me put you straight
Did a little diggin' bring you up to date
Well a backwater it may be
But you got to brush on that history
