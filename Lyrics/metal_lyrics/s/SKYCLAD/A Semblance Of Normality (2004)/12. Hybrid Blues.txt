You think you come so far ?
You think you learnt along the way ?
You're better off by far
Than where you were jus' yesterday
You say you got your scars
There's nothing left to say

You got to look beyond
Go make some ripples on your pond
We are the things we sing
All wrapped up with bows and strings
You think you're everything ?
Accept the sense of substance over style

And take away the hype
Take away the sad affairs
Listen to your lies
Can't you see it now there's no-one there ?

We are the things we choose
Come walk a mile in this man's shoes
And if you're still confused
Go learn to sing some hybrid blues
What have you got to lose
Except your sense of ignorance and pride ?

And take away the hype
Take away the sad affairs
Listen to your lies
Can't you see it now there's no-one there ?

I can't tell you anymore
I can't tell you what to think or say
Take away the hard lines
Can't you see it any other way ?

But I still don't hear this 'inherent cry'
From 'Dear old Stockholm' to the 'My-O-My'
Make it, lose it, make it, lose it

I still don't hear that plaintive call
From the sacred mountains to the 'wailing wall'
Faithless, shameless, faceless, hopeless

Now I loved me a woman, don't mean a thing
I loved me a woman, gave her everything
'I got stones in my passway and I railed at the moon
There's a light at your doorway, guess who spoke too soon ?
Singing, 'take me, use me, love me'

But I still don't hear that primal scream
Of a rich man nightmare or a poor boy's dream
Have i lived too long ? Have I lived at all ?
If life's a journey, catch me when I fall

And you're lying there like 'the brid stripped bare'
In the virtual madness, in my my dark dispair
Singing, 'Hurt me, hate me, hear me, help me'

Is this hybrid offspring just a high-class where
O a pale young virgin and wild old boar ?
Pointless, tasteless, thoughtless
