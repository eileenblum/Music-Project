Like the promise of a grey day dawning
Like all the dreams I've never had
Like I'm working as the beast of burden
Just like Sisyphus I know where I stand

Like I need another rude awakening
With all your caterwauling in my ears
Like I know where all the money comes from
Just like the man said 'Here my dear'

Like I need another cute Demelza
Like I need to be a gentlemen
Like I need another sweet Lolita
Like I need another Jezebel

'Love is the flame of burning brandy'
I take a drink from your poisoned cup
Like I need another Mata Hari
Like I need to see those eyes close-up

Like I need another 'brief encounter'
Like I need another fresh start
Like I understand your indignation
Like you care about my wounded heart

Like I need another misadventure
Like I need another dead-end trail
Like I need another misdirection
Like I need another fairy-tale

Like I bring a plague on all your houses
Just like I'm Herode or 'the king of Misrule'
Like I need another stark reminder
Like I'm Jonah or The April Fool

Like I need to make another swan-song
Like I need another 'sordid boon'
Like I need another born-again virgin
Cut my heart out with a wooden spoon

Like a ballad for the disenchanted
Like a sonnet for a long-lost friend
Like a requiem played on my heartstrings
Like you're the last word and this is the end
