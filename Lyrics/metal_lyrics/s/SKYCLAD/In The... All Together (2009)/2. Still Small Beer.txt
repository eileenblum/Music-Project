Wake up Jacob now, wake up John
Day's a-wasting, great things to be done
Super-highways don't build themselves
Estates and empires by the stroke of twelve

Where we fit in the scheme of things?
We're just debris blown by the wind
So forget your woman and the water can
We're all working for the man

He's got money now, he's got fame
He's got letters running after his name
He says "We are where we must be
And we are what we must be"

Still small beer
Got the message loud and clear
Still small beer
For what we're worth, it's still small beer

Head down Harvey and tail up Tom
In this man's army, there's no spoils to be won
Spit and polish, keep your muzzle clean
We're just cogs in this war machine

Best foot forward, do we march in fear?
We're all cloggers and minions here
So know your station and make no mistake
As you brew, so you shall bake

All our effort and all our time
All together in the firing line
But an honest soldier is never forgot
Whether he die by musket or pot

Still small beer
Got the message loud and clear
Still small beer
For what we're worth, it's still small beer
Still small beer
Drink up and get out of here
Still small beer
For what you're worth, it's still small beer

And we sing our song to the sun
"Beer! Beer! Beer!" cried the soldiers
"Brave fellows are we"

And we sing our song to the sun
"Beer! Beer! Beer!" cried the sailors
As we heave along the way

What we're worth and what we're not
We'll make the best of what we've got
But they made it plain, so it would appear
That he who thinks beer's not Shakespeare

Still small beer
Got the message loud and clear
Still small beer
For what we're worth, it's still small beer
Still small beer
Insignificance
Still small beer
Insignificance
