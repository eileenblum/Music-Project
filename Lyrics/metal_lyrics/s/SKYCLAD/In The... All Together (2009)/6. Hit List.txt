A list of needs to get me started
Help me organise my day
Get up, get dressed and get reminded
Exactly what I need to say

Everything is architecture
Everything's political
It's all pride and prejudice
Don't tell me that it's art!

A cool head for calculation
These things occupy my mind
I work better independent
Deal with one thing at a time

Buzzwords buzzing through my brain
Repetition makes the point...again
Your vile vowel movements, they bother me
Don't bother to buzz me again

In the evening when the west light glares
And the storm beats out to sea
Can you find you if you sit and stare
Is your soul lost on the breeze?

Let's start again and stop pretending
Forget the furniture of war
Communication's never ending
Make things better, know the score

Everything is architecture
Everything's political
It's all pride and prejudice
Don't tell me what it is!

A list of needs to get me started
Evaluate, prioritise
Certain things must be decided
Taken one step at a time

In the evening when the west light glares
And the storm beats out to sea
Can you find you if you sit and stare
Is your soul lost on the breeze?

(Counterpoint 1):
All these things I hear could make me live in fear
Could force me not to care or drive me to despair)

(Counterpoint 2):
Everyone lets you down, yes

(Counterpoint 3):
Sooner or later, more or less
