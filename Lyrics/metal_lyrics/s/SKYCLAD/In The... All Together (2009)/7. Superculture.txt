Councillor, I love your city fair
With its vistas and its good clean air that we all breathe
Councillor, I love your city fair
With its moguls and its gurus who sing "boom or bust"

It's okay because we're free men and in God we trust

Love your superculture
Bigger, brighter future
They make it better every year
Love your superculture
Even if it's overdone
Overblown and over here

Councillor, I love your city fair
With its curfews and its social care and "by your leave"
Councillor, I love your city fair
With its civic pride and its eyes fixed firmly on the prize

It's okay because it's legal, down in black and white

Love your superculture
Bigger, brighter future
They make it better every year
Love your superculture
Even if it's overdone
Overblown and over here

Superculture, we're living under
Superculture, we're going under

I believe in the God's deliverance
I believe in reverence
I believe in association
I believe in consumption

Even though it's fatally flawed
Even though it won't be ignored
Even though I don't feel good
Even though I don't see why I should
Even though I'm by myself
Even though it's not good for my health
Even though I'll never be missed
Even though I won't make a fist

Sirrah Sirrah, can you hear my voice?
We're the underclass who have no choice of what gets done

Love your superculture
Bigger, brighter future
They make it better every year
Love your superculture
Even if it's overdone
Overblown and over here
