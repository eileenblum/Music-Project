With laptops made of calfskin, wrought to spread the holy will
Disseminating dogma, using lapis, gold and quill
And the word was with the few and the few were very strong
A mass communication where you feel you don't belong

Now the words that flow between us run like torrents through the air
Connecting everymen at any moment, anywhere
Seems that what's important at the end of the day
Down through all the ages, just the same old things to say

Sure, the aldermen and theigns did tarry, warmed in winter halls
With new ideas and learning locked up safe within their walls
Till the patrons all did strive, with the "Blue Plague brigade"
Victorian reformers will be smiling in their graves

To hear how the news spread between us
Something good to tell the world?
Though it's mostly dumb and they say it's cheap
There's a talk plan made for everyone

To think some people deny this...
In a free state, tongues too should be free
And in desperate lands, the disaffected hand
Sprays "Save the world" upon the street

Now the words that flow between us run like torrents through the air
Connecting everymen at any moment, anywhere
Seems that what's important at the end of the day
It's mass communication and we call can have our say

We may speak of creature comforts, but still our greatest feat
Is to see and hear and understand the words upon the street
