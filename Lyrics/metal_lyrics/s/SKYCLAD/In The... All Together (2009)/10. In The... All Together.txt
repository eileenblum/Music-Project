Another dawn, another date
Another meeting of the ol' G8
To change the world, make history
Not compromise or hesitate

Try something, try anything
Try help the situation
Amidst the cries and demonstrations
We hear the plans of favoured nations

"If it could be done", they said, "the sooner then, the better"
"It would be good if it was better than the way it was before" they said
In the mire all together, when there's so much to admire
It seems "the emperor's new clothes" is such a seasonable attire

The issues are of great import
The problems very clear
From fevered minds and tortured brows
There's such a lot to fear

From climate change to debt relief
Surely couldn't come much bigger
All the power that is nuclear
Whose finger's on the trigger?

On the horns of this dilemma with death's spectre in the wings
Where democracy is waning, clearly it's a "people thing"
Yes, we're in it all together and all our wishes are laid bare
We taste "the truth without the trimmings" and we find it meagre fare

Welcome to "a day in the life show", starring you and me and all
It's better than your realiTV, you just couldn't make this stuff up
As pandemics spread around the world...
We've got pestilence, famine, fire and flood for the people in glasshouses

Now the good will is all over and we're left with nothing good
It seems "the best laid plans of mice and men" get trampled in the mud
Yes, we're in it all together, right up to our nether lip
In this cesspit we inhabit, only takes a slip

"If it could be done", they said, "the sooner then, the better"
"It would be good if it was better than the way it was before" they said
They said nothing too explicit, there's no meat upon the bones
"We'll just have to wait and see", they said, "just see how it goes...", they said
