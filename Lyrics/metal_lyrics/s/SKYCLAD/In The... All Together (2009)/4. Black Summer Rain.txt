I understand this fault is mine
I'm basking in reflected light
Why should I run, why should I hide?
Why should I take another's prize?

You don't see it, you just don't see it
But you're up to your neck in it now

Black Summer Rain
Black Summer Rain
Black Summer Rain
Black Summer Rain

Dark brooding thoughts that cross my mind
Like clouds across your sunny sky
They weather, they weather in me
And I understand this serpentine

You don't see it, you just don't see it
But you're spoiling this perfect day

Black Summer Rain
Black Summer Rain
Black Summer Rain
Black Summer Rain

Like a maelstrom around you, it blinds you
Hiding behind all those lies
Condescending, aloof when we find you
But you're in for a nasty surprise

You don't see it, you just don't see it
But you're up to your neck in it now

Black Summer Rain
Black Summer Rain
Black Summer Rain
Black Summer Rain
