You say that it's good reason, "an eye for an eye"
"A queer bird the fish, sir" must be my reply
For fresh meat and lodgings I'll stand by your side
If wishes were horses, then beggars would ride

All the days after, said all the days after
All the days after, let fortune decide
Always and after, sing, always and after
Death, debt or disaster, let fortune decide

When absurdity starts to make more or less sense
Embrace all your demons, then banish them hence
When clarity flows in the sweet by and by
And questions are answers, you'll know which is why

So, if you seek wisdom, I'll tell you once more
But if you want answers, you've got the wrong door
Ask me no questions and you'll get no surprise
"The truth is a cow, sir, that sceptics despise"

All the days after, said all the days after
All the days after, let nature decide
For always and after, sing, always and after
For lust, love and laughter, let nature decide

When absurdity starts to make more or less sense
Embrace all your demons, then banish them hence
When clarity flows in the sweet by and by
And questions are answers, you'll know which is why

Your lips on my own when they printed "farewell"
Had never been soiled by the beverage of hell
But they come to me now with the bacchanal sign
But the lips that taste liquor, they taste so divine

All the days after, said all the days after
All the days after, let wit be your guide
Oh, you may laugh sir, said oh you may laugh sir
For madman or master, let wit be your guide

When nonsense begins to make more or less sense
Life's riddles and puzzles, just banish them hence
When lucidity flows in the wink of an eye
And questions are answers, you'll know which is why
