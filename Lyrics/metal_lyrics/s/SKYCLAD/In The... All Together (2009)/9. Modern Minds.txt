Lord knows I've been drinking again
Caffeine and alcohol
And taking of that opiate and where that leaves me
...I don't know

Asking all those questions 'bout democracy
Society and "all that jazz"
Go to run a check on reality
Is anything just what it seems?

We can work it out
We've got modern minds
There's nothing to be scared of
We've got modern minds

Lord knows I'm a willing man
And you shouldn't want to stop a willing man
You could never hurt me like I hurt myself
So, let me go, abuse myself

A chorus of dead eyes say "Let's help you down"
And if I listen, then I'm lost
Singing songs of lust and obscenity
They're tempting me, they turn my head

We can work it out
We've got modern minds
There's nothing to be scared of
We've got modern minds

On fire, my mind's on fire...

If it's forbidden to forbid
How come it feels like I never lived?
And if I flatter to deceive
How come it feels like I never lived?

I know what I like, they won't change my mind
I know what I like, they won't change my mind
Rhythm, colours, form, I know what I like
I know what I like, they won't change my mind
