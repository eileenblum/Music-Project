In with the old and out with the new
The people you know should be people you knew
The old stuff's made to last don't you know
So forward into the past we'll go
Out with the new and in with the old
The next big thing's left in the cold
Boldly going where we've been before
Taking the well-worn path for sure

The memory of a golden age
Trying to relive halcyon days
The future is a parlous state
So we're for turning back
What's imminent is in our hands
We know what's real â we understand
For years we played the underdog
But the world sounds better in analogue

With royalties at an all-time low
Looking back is the way to go
Keep it real and underground
You know what-s coming round

It's community, it's stronger bonds
Swimming in ever smaller ponds
They've heard it all before anyway
So please believe the hype

So it's in with the old and out with the new
The people you know should be people you knew
The old stuff's made to last don't you know
So forward into the past we'll go
Out with the new and in with the old
The next big thing's left in the cold
Boldly going where we've been before
Taking the well-worn path for sure

They said that "Pop would eat itself"
Are we all cannibals now?
Those that declare, declared it dead
While gnawing on the bones
The people who win well they know the game
Milking the system for all that it's worth
It's so much more than life and death
It's re-birth

So it's in with the old and out with the new
The people you know should be people you knew
The old stuff's made to last don't you know
So forward into the past we'll go
Out with the new and in with the old
The next big thing's left in the cold
Boldly going where we've been before
Taking the well-worn path for sure
