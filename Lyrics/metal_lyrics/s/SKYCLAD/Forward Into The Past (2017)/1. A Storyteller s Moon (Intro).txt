Welcome back my friends, yes, it's been to long I fear
In these sad and stormy times, you'll find a place of refuge here
I am your genial host, I trust, a narrator fair and true
Though there's nothing new under the sun, it's a storyteller's moon
Under the sparkling skies we sit, to sing our songs and tell our tales
Of war and strife, of love and loss
While drinking and dining and flirting and fighting
We gather here, under a storyteller's moon.
