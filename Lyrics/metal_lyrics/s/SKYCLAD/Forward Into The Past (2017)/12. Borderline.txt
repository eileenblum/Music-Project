Those ghostly eyes burn in my mind
Black days hurting deep inside
So far I've been feeling my way blind
Along this borderline
Just wasting so much timeâ¦
Grave thoughts fill my waking hours
Bad nights clearly leave their scars
And outside the beast that devours
Is couched among the flowers
And loving all its power

Sometimes I feel it's alright
To close my eyes and keep on sleeping
Far from all the oceans where they ride
And all the problems that they bring

So do you look out in the morning
Past burnt out churches, children in the rain?
Can you believe all the anger, all the hatred
And do you believe that anyone is saved?

Sometimes I feel it's alright
To close my eyes and keep on sleeping
Far from the basements where they hide
And all the problems that they bring

Those ghostly eyes burn in my mind
Cold fears churning me inside
And so far I've been feeling my way blind
Along this borderline
Just wasting so much time
Still feeling my way blind
Along this borderline
