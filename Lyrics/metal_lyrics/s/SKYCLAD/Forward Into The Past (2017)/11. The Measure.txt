What you going to do when the problems mount up so high?
Parking your bags in the hallway, ready to fly?
What you going to do now your sugar fountain's run dry?
Wringing your hands and trying to work out why?
Never ever, ever fall in love, well this could be true
But you're tired of chasing rainbows, lost to heaven â who knows?
(Look for your saving grace)

The measure, slowly coming round now
The measure, they'll catch you if they can
The measure, shows you what you're worth now
The measure, the measure of a man

What your going to do when you're tired of bruising your pride?
Spin a coin, choose a black or white side?
What you going to do when they take you on that long ride?
Change your name, to save your worthless hide?
Never ever, ever even know yourself, well this could be true
You're tired of ringing numbers, all out of your tiny mind
(Fall onto your knees)

The measure, slowly coming round now
The measure, they'll catch you if they can
The measure, shows you what you're worth now
The measure, the measure of a man

Am I a lost 'cause? Am I so see through?
All for the man who lives his attitudes

The measure, slowly coming round now
The measure, they'll catch you if they can
The measure, shows you what you're worth now
The measure, the measure of a man

The measure, slowly coming round now
The measure, they'll catch you if they can
The measure, shows you what you're worth now
The measure, the measure of a man
