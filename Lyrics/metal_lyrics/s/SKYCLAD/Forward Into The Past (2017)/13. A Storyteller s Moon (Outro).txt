Wake up one and all, can't you hear the clock bird's call?
Time has stolen a march on us, yes, he makes fools of us all
We have to face the world now, pack up all your cares and moans
We can't shrug off our duties in the cold hard light of dawn
We danced the dance of intrigue and romanced the night o'happy hours
Of Bacchanalian merriment, to greet the morning star
Now with courage all renewed, so full of heart and hope that soon
Another time, another place, we'll meet again
Under a storyteller's moon


Thanks to vgoelwow for correcting track #6 lyrics.
