Now Meg she was a gypsy maid, her house was out of doors
She stood a tall as amazon, rare she was the queen of the moors

Her apples were tart blackberries, her currants pods o'broom
Her wine was the dew of the wild white rose, her book a churchyard tomb
Her brothers were the craggy hills, her sisters larchen trees
Alone with her great family, she did as she did please
Brave Meg she was a gypsy fair, she lived all out of doors
She wore an old red blanket cloak, she came and she went did the queen of the moors

No breakfast has she many a morn, no dinner many a noon
Instead of supper she would stare, full hard against the moon
But every morn with woodbine fresh, she made her garlanding
And every night the dark glen yew she wove, and she would sing
Now Meg she was a gypsy maid, her house was out of doors
She stood a tall as amazon, rare she was the queen of the moors

Brave Meg she was a gypsy fair, she lived all out of doors
She wore an old red blanket cloak, she came and she went did the queen of the moors

Meg she was a gypsy maid, her house was out of doors
She stood a tall as amazon, rare she was the queen of the moors

Meg she was a gypsy fair, she lived all out of doors
She wore an old red blanket cloak, she came and she went did the queen of the moors
Rare she was the queen of the moors
