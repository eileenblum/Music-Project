She came looking for position in answer to our need
And she was a pretty flower fair as any in the field
She burst into the room and we both did feel the rush
Had young Rome in tow but we knew he'd get the push
It wasn't very long 'til we found ourselves alone
And the business was forgotten as acquaintances were known
And then the morning after, she didn't give a damn
Sure it's better to be hung for a sheep as for a lamb
In answer to concerns she said she'd like to take a chance
So she hung up and we resumed the horizontal dance

So listen all good company, it's a cautionary tale
It's sure to make you split your sides, weep into your ale
Oh the perils and risks we take when mixing work and play
And then when we are all exposed there's a heavy price to pay

And then some short time later, when we were in a haze
Our company decided on a parting of the ways
And then my good companions sought to put me in a fix
To add insult onto injury with the dirtiest of tricks
With mischief and sharp practice in the drawing of the straws
The vote was rigged and it was me to show her the door
And when it was all over, one question she did pose,
Was I a disappointment in the other of my roles?
So it would seem that just desserts were handed all around
And another fledgling romance came crashing to the ground

So listen all good company, it's a cautionary tale
It's sure to make you split your sides, weep into your ale
Oh the perils and risks we take when mixing work and play
And then when we are all exposed there's a heavy price to pay
There's a heavy price to pay. Yes, there's a heavy price to pay.
