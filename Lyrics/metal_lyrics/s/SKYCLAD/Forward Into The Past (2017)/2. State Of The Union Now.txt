The condition of the people and our national priorities
Get broadcast across the country like a speech from royalty
Speech, want and fear are the freedoms that we're fighting for
The pursuit of happiness of course and who could want for anymore?
Yes, the nation's in a state and so step up and take a bow
That's the state of the union, state of the union now

Well just across the water, well they're thinking that they've got it made
'Cause they had a vote and everything and everything was all explained
Regulation, immigration is what caused them to complain
But they're looking to the government to make it all great again
Well you need to know just who it is, that's in control and how
That's the state of the union, state of the union now

Do we ask you to serve?
Do we get what we deserve?
Do we ask you to die?
Do we ask you to lie, over and over again?
Sell it to me, sell it to me, sell it to me now
Sell it to me, sell it to me, sell it to me now
Tell it to me, tell it to me, tell it to me now
Tell it to me, tell it to me, tell itâ¦

So what could be worse than a xenophobic, sociopath?
Well the answer's one with power and the willingness to attack
Well they're looking to the hard man to update them with the facts
And they're looking to their glorious and patriotic past
It's just the case of "us and them" and we're not going to back down
That's the state of the union, the state of the union now.
