After years of reckless living, for a century or more
With a few who lived the good life, being paid by the poor
Now they're fiddling while the forest bur, soaring through the poisoned skies
Surfing in the plastic seas, we're adding our voices to the rising
Chorus of concern, striking chords of alarm
The drums of discontent, keep banging on and on
It's still the same old story, a resources grab and go
A fight for territory, to maintain the status quo

Now they say that a change is coming, while we're basking in the sun
And the temperature is rising, so there's not much getting done
Yes they say that change is coming, while we look the other way
The rest of our life is hurting, in a world in disarray

Keep checking the vital signs, of the sea and land and air
But all you need is eyes, cos it's happening everywhere
Well the animals could be marched into the creationist's mobile zoo
As if this could protect them all, as if this could prevent the fall
Of man from his position as custodian of Earth
Will our watch be remembered for anything of worth?
As we look to new horizons, new worlds to colonize
Will we learn the lessons or dismiss it all as lies?
Now they say that change is coming and it's not some fantasy
Cos the evidence is mounting and it's there for all to see
Yes they say that change is coming and it's not conspiracy
No it's not just "snake oil science" but a new harsh reality

They say that a change is coming, while we're basking in the sun
And the temperature is rising, so there's not much getting done
Yes they say that change is coming, while we look the other way
The rest of our life is hurting, in a world in disarray
Yes, they say that a change is coming
Yes, they say that a change is coming.
