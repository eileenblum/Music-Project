As long as the earth is turning
as long as the fire's burning
for the beauty that I'm yearning I won't hide
as long as the years are going
as long as your mind is flowin'
as I'm standing talking I won't hide
As long as the time is runnin'
and there is birth and dying
the quests I find I search
As long as the sun is shinin'
as long as the birds are flying
as a war continues I won't hide
as long as your god won't clear out
as long for him you doubt
as I don't believe you I won't hide
