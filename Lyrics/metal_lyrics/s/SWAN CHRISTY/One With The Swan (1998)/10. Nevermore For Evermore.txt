Search inside your own head
search the things that you said
promised me a new life
now you leave me to die
I won't cry for my life I'll survive
Remember all the fed
I was caught in a web
I see you're the same
I'm hurt till I die
Now I'm here all alone
Don't know where to go
I know I'll survive
I'm strong I won't die
