Can you say for once the truth
I'm here believing you
I'm no stranger up to you
we're the same remember
I need your own voice
so this is your choice
can you speak or you'll hide
hide in the shadows away from me
Now the world is cryin'on
can you stay or you'll be gone
for this moment I will wait
you believe this is your fate
I seek for you, I seek for you
Just once you'll trust someone
who loves you
you believe that he cares for you
and wants you
Looking all the days turning on new ways
believe in my word
