While the days go by
a cold wind feeling in me
I saw things I never believed
my passion destroys me
Don't hurt again when you transcend
follow the road you want
don't trust no one
you can reach to the sun
just follow the road you want
Walking all by myself
in a road of pain
can't find a man to talk
all I do is walk
