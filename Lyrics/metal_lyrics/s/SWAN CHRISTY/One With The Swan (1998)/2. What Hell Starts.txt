The crowd shouted burn
Die, die
the priest shouted die
If you are a witch
you can save me from the pain
If you are a witch
you can take me from the grave
If you are a witch
you can keep away the flames
If you are a witch
you can save your own self
NO - NO
I am innocent
You see
I have blue eyes
If I were a witch
I would throw them to the pit
I love my life, God is my witness
I have no magic spells to help myself
so religion crucifies me
