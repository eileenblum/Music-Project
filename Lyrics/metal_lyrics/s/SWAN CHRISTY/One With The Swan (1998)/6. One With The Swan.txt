I saw all my days all of my ways and I know
if we should care only for good it will show
Everyday a war will continue
and people will die in the fields
Anyway the guest of evil
will spread terror in all
I know I will die
my future is dark but I still believe
You think matter will bring to you joy
this is why you steal
Everyday a war will continue
and people will die in the fields
Anyway the guest of evil
will spread terror in all
Only way is to kneel and pray
so kneel, so kneel
and pray and pray
for the good to be saved
