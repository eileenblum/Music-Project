Watch at the sky the sun sets
and we both want to cry
for the same reasons

You know I have to go now
It's the last time you see me
I'll go to hell
I don't think I'll return

For the reasons you know
and for my country I'll go to war
I hope you pray for me
so my soul will be free

Time goes by so quickly
I don't want to leave you here
cold and alone
