One man sold his life to darkness
darkness took his son
it took his son
search for your son
He died from the grace
it's how thinks our race
he cried from his grave
my father you're my slave
The man thinks what he should do
live or die too
he asks a solution
my god a solution for me
Live from your lies
hear children cry
for now lets wait
Some day you'll pay
