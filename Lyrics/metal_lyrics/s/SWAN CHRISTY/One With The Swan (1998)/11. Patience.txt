Have you ever been alone
have they ever don't understand
you believe you can make it
better hope than believe it
Till someday I'm gonna leave it
only memories of me
you laugh but believe me
I'm dying can you see
Now that all my hopes are gone
I don't want to believe no more
they say after the rain comes sun
but someone took the light of my one
I stay now alive but my dream is dead
what else can I expect than my punishment
Patience
