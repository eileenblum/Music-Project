Something else to say
No excuses what it's like
Life is so strange every night to sleep wide awake

Yearning for a change I close my eyes
One stair at the time
Loneliness my only friend

Taking a walk far away from here
Standing frozen behind my fear
Hiding in your lie

I look straight into your eyes
Like when I believed you once
No one to blame but you
Coldness stains you

No one to hold No one to carry this burden for me
No one there just me and my hate

Taking a walk far away from here
Standing frozen behind my fear
Hiding in your lie

Taking a walk far away from here
Standing frozen behind my fear
Hiding in your lie
