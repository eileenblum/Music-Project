Through this nothingness I see your face
Craving for truth
Rain colours the sky above you
I'll paint it blue, I touch your name
And feel the pain of loss

Take me away with your eyes of may
My everything is nothing, drowning in your haze
Time and again memories do fail
In this room of silence we lay

Waiting for a new day
A touch of faith - Face so pale
Forever cries little demon inside
Through the flames of rage I dive
With myself I drown in this pain

Take me away with your eyes of may
My everything is nothing, drowning in your haze
Time and again memories do fail
In this room of silence we lay

In your world I hear you
In your world I'll set you free
Pieces will fall, wither and die
I gave you only the shame
I see the world through cold blue eyes
In your eyes of may
