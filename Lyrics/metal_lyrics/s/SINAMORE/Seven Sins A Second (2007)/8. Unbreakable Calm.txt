This is silence
It's more than we can cry about. We may die about.
One word in this silence.
Would it drown us both in a lie?

I lay down and purify my thoughts.
To make it through this day.
I hear you walking away.

Just one word in this silence.
Would it drown us both in a lie?

Salvation from this world.
I suffer the joy with you.
Empty halls wait for your scream.

I want you to find me
In furious season of war
I want you to fight me
In this dangerous, unbreakable calm

Come, grab these arms
Force us both go down
Into sea to soak with decaying seed
Smoke blinds our eyes
Cold is the flame feeding the embers

I want you to find me
In furious season of war
I want you to fight me
In this dangerous, unbreakable calm
