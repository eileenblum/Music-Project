I open the door and see the shadows covering this place
The dreams sheltered in white sheet
I Feel the fire in vein it's killing me again (and again)

You hide the price in a twisted mind
In silence there are no words to anyone
You fail to ignore me
You fail to approve yourself
The game that you play is the last that will fail

I'm still standing
Waiting the savior of change in first dying day
Unspeakable silence it may follow through the end
