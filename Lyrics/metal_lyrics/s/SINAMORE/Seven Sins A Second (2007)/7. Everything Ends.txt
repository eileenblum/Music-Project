So fell from a day another gracious race of man
Crashing straight to the ground
Making a sound so cold
And leaving behind the marks of a dreamworld

On your face final disgrace, I'll force you down to obey
I can bury your wasted soul in grave to the lear I used to lay

Crush me and waste the seed in yet another dimension of lie
Come hold me the sea as I drown
Kill me with no regret I'm not a saint wearing the devils veil
Through the night I hear your silent cry

Hide - You will find
The pieces of this life-line, you tear down
Corrosed by the tears that made us apart
Fight all your life behind the border of fire
Burn you dreams and become one with the fear

There are many things I can never find
I'm not weak, I just don't care
There are many things that I can never find
There are many things that I can never hide
Maybe tomorrow shows the reason to go on
I'm not weak, I don't care
Hands all in red painting the view of silence
