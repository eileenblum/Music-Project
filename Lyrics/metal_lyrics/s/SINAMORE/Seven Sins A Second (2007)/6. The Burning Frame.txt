After I made this fall I don't know
Where I am, where I belong
Too many questions
I escape time just to see the life reform
Without signs of hope

I see the frames are burning
Bright enough to see right through
Seven sins a second
These walls are burning to the ground

Coming down with violence
Blood is the fuel - I need to proceed
It won't let me go - It won't stop bleeding
My body's rejecting the control of sword
The mind is dead by the lies
For pride I'm standing

I see the frames are burning
Bright enough to see right through
Seven sins a second
These walls are burning to the ground
Carving out another crime
