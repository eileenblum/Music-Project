It was you that I found from ashore
No longer breathing - Soaking the end
With no shame, without any single tear
Still feelin' that I had fallen again

Why the silence gets so loud
Do you think it's hiding the crime
I see how fear lives in it's eyes

Only broken shield to hide
Should I think; that I came to the end

Dreams are made to be failed

Crawl - I saw you cross the line
This way was too easy to find, to let you go
Fall - I saw you facing the light
It makes this night so bright - You are gone

Should I think; we came to the end

Crawl - I saw you cross the line
This way was too easy to find, to let you go
Fall - I saw you facing the light
It makes this night so bright - You are gone
