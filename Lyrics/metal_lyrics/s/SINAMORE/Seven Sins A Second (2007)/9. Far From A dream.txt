You crushed into my life without a word
Never said I need you
Two souls in this madness make no sense
Can you see - you drag me down

Your love is a fraud where joy lays dead
Never felt so lonely
A killing spree towards yourself
Design to numb your pain

I'm dying to face tomorrow
I won't deny those things I've done
All the things that made you cry
I'm not afraid to lose you
The story's to tell you it's my life
If it's meaningless - Inhale this life away

This life is a game with taste like hell
And you make it so painless
I'm afraid to lose my mind and desire
I feel you

I'm dying to face tomorrow
I won't deny those things I've done
All the things that made you cry
I'm not afraid to loose you
The story's to tell you it's my life
If it's meaningless - Inhale this life away

I'm dying to face tomorrow
I won't deny those things I've done
All the things that made you cry
I'm not afraid to loose you
The story's to tell you it's my life
If it's meaningless - Inhale this life away
