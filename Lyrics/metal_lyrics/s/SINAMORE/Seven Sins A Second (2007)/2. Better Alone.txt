Wish you could kill me every day
Still you are keeping me alive
By feeding the grain of self-destruction

If I reach the red line just in time
Could you push a needle through my soul
Final statement: Better off alone.

I see you running back to your cave
Guess you are hiding from your sentence
Could you even invite me in

I want you to know I don't need you to save me from this world
I want you to know I'll haunt you

All the light turns dark
I stop breathing yea the pain stays where it was
Walls getting closer

As the sight grows dim
Start a fire to see the guilt walk right in
I want you to see me

Riddle of this all lives in you
Resign oneself to one's fate: Find the way to easiest hell
Padon behind the door turn the key for solution
Pull the trigger for the sake of friend

All the light turns dark
I stop breathing yet the pain stays where it was
Walls getting closer

As the sight grows dim
Start a fire to see the guilt walk right in
I want you to see me
