Every day a mouner's day
Behind these walls of lies
Suicide - I still love her

All comes down in crimson rain
The pain is growing inside
I know I still feel for her

Yearning for lost and quiet scenes
Yearning for your light in this time
In time of sorrow

From cradle to grave I'm counting the days
I'll reach the hand of hope
Every time I feel hollow

With myself I wallow in pain
Finally sealing the scars on my face
All forever stained by glorious darkness

With myself I wallow in pain
Finally sealing the scars on my face
All forever stained by glorious darkness
