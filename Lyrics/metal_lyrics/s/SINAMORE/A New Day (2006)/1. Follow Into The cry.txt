All these years I've been alone
Yearning for a change to my life
Like abandoned child

I face the voidness of this so called life
With all fears inside

And the time won't leave behind
Any shattered tears
You look into my eyes
The darkness faces the light

I face the voidness of this so called life
With all fears inside

I follow my fears, I cry
Empty downhearted soul
For so long in darkness I have dwelled
I follow my fears, I cry
Roaming alone all day
