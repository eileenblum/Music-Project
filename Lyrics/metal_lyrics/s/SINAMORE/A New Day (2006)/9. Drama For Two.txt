Like center page; I read through your eyes again
Your love is like a gun
With your lies, burning way through fire again

Dark walk I roam; hiding in your shadow as you are
Re-created way of pain, fight against the fears you gave me - You are

Forever loveless kingdom. Your face hurts like a scar
The pain that you sow make me go too far.
In your dreams heaven is flooded with the sin.
The truth is that I have lost you deep within.

Still in my dreams we both die

Dark walk I roam; hiding in your shadow as you are
Re-created way of pain, fight against the fears you gave me - You are

Dark walk I roam; hiding in your shadow as you are
Re-created way of pain, fight against the fears you gave me - You are
