The pain is growing deep inside
Far so long it breaks your heart

Once more feel the burning flame
Be my light mine through this rain
Keep the demons away

Tears are fading with cold rain
And with love I staunch my pain
Hold me Darling in your arms

Burning lust now turns to hate
Be my sunrise of last day
See the love moon rising

I'm falling into your arms - Eternal sleep
Once more feel the burning flame
Like the crimson leaf
I'm falling into your arms - Eternal sleep
Once more feel the burning flame
Now it's time for me
