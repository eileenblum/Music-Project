Walking on the edge all pain within
Nothing matters to me now
You are the one no one else to blame
Nothing matters to me now
Create a sound that's so divine I feel your pain

I follow you to the other side
Nothing matters to me now
I swept all away from yesterday
Nothing matters to me now
I wake the evil so divine - I feel your pain

My fallen dreams - I see your face in me
My fallen dreams - I see

On your face I see now only fear
All your life is now in disappear
I wake the evil so divine - I feel your pain

My fallen dreams - I see your face in me
My fallen dreams - I see your face in me

My fallen dreams - I see your face in me
My fallen dreams - I see your face in me
My fallen dreams - I see

All my life is now in disappear
