In love for hate, lost in greed
The ocean of evil is too deep
Another day will turn into the night
It's so cold in that sense where's the angel on her knees
To Pray the god for a way into the light

Together we go crawling in lust of pain
In life all is rage - We are sleeping away
Blood on our arms; God will bleed again
In true all seems grey - We are dying away

Dreams are broken all have been lies
The Story of our life is done and buried in grave
The Reason why the angels cry
Is all those demons on her side
They cry 'till we are gone

Together we go crawling in lust of pain
In life all is rage - We are sleeping away
Blood on our arms; God will bleed again
In true all seems grey - We are dying away

Together we go crawling in lust of pain
In life all is rage - We are sleeping away
Blood on our arms; God will bleed again
In true all seems grey - We are dying away

Cold feelin' rain falling down on skin
Tears of our pain breaks the ice so thin
Forever we go reaching to the light
All we would say - Aikanaan Kaikki Kuolemme Pois
