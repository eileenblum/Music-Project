Give me your hand - this round is for my pain
Let it all lay dead and erased, 'cause everything is nothing
The words once said, are dripping down by the dampness in rainfall
That drowns our lives in lies

Crying echoes are calling my name
I'm walking through the field of needles - I'm not painless
Drowning deeper into your thoughts
You throw your arms on me so tight
You make me feel alive

My rain - unleash this pain that's making my life so gray
Fading darkness on your side
My rain - the shade of yours is dancing on the cradles edge
Unknown faces in the night

My rain - unleash this pain that's making my life so gray
Fading darkness on your side
My rain - the shade of yours is dancing on the cradles edge
Unknown faces in the night

Close your eyes
