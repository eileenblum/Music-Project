Monster inside is hiding the crime - Slowly falling from grace
Nothing new; Everything's so fine
Hope you finally forgive me for all my sins that I've done
In the throes of passion I make you believe

The broken wings of the angel
I see how it falls through the shadows into the cradle

Once little death came dancing to me smiling behind the gloom
Nothing new; Everything is so fine
A Shadow falls on my grave and the rain is breaking the ground
Once awaken flies into the unknown

Pieces will fall, wither and die
I gave you nothing - Only bitter shame
Forever cries little demon inside - I'm broken
The art of regret

Pieces will fall, wither and die
I gave you nothing - Only bitter shame
Forever cries little demon inside - I'm broken
The art of regret
