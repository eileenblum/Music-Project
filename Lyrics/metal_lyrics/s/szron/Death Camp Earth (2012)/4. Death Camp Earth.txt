Living mass of human waste swarming beneath
our eternal temples made of the bones of the dead worlds
all they do is beg for mercy all they care for is
what we take from them We are the blade the Devil's sword
of devastation He strikes the blade down on the necks of the gods
and leaders holocausts and atrocities was crimes and
slaughter this is what we are and by Satan we'll forever be!
all our needs we throw to the sake let them burn with
the smell of burnt meat all our deeds for the glory of Satan
we shall lead all of you to the furnace
