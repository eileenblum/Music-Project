piece by piece I reduce my existence on this fucking planet
intoxicating the wind tormenting the flesh its supposed the
great values and virtues falling deeper into insignificance
into the all - nothing Minus ultra its blaze diminishing
into blackness deep there lurks Satan scraping off all the
masks from from the flesh ripping the mind into shreds
insanity! self induced a narrow path for the chosen few of
the Devil of the Lord of all Darkness the self - reduced to
a shard of Thine Shadow sharp, lethal its point pierce the
lifes of all in the despised light of day they call life we
kill all there is in sight
