every day I walk the paths the humans do hidden in the flesh...
yet I am not here anymore I already ascended to the Blackness...
I am pleased to cast my sight on them though eventually
and all the time I see them walking their paths pathetic...
I smile beneath a thousand masks at their insignificance
with so much confidence in what they have been taught with
their certainties of the uncertainties their bodies smell of
animals that they in fact are slaves to the genes, obedient
to instincts brainless mass in the wheels of pointlessness so
unaware of what lurks beneath the world they call theirs but
the evils, aeons old, are never asleep they come wandering
the earth sometimes haunting this realm for the reasons
unfathomed, twisting the minds of mortals entering their
thoughts with the whispers of a thousand spiders scratching
the inside of the skull with their legs swarming inside they
devour all that binds to the laws of life and replace it 
with a vortex of Darkness this is the way to the eternal
black void of insanity this is the moment that a dark god is
born
