hanging stretched by the limbs on the chains forgen from
earthly ores, betwixt the highest peaks of humanity, the
hateful flesh violently shudders off both divine and mundane
laws with contempt spitting at all that was written in the
books of wals of the semites and was ever preached and
taught by all the flesh that followed the inner beast in
search of a master's whip apocalypse stroke home nullifying
god god of the flesh flesh of god the voice dried up in
ravaged throat every breath like razor blades intake of the
foul air that makes all things grow the disgusting exhaust
fumes of life yet the throat releases the blackest curses in
the violent torrent of blasphemies calling up the storms of
Nothingness the unheavenly blizzards to shake and trample
the pillars of this earthly domain (of man) The Powers
unleash the scythers heads fall At last the final
devastation has come!
