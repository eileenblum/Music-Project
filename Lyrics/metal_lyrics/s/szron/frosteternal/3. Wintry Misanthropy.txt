With delight I watch it all fade...
...Those bare hands reaching for the sky
To catch the dying light

As now, the sun is gone, far away
Breaths are spread across the land
To shake of them, who still stand
Down towards the rotting bottoms

Behold the world, greatest graves of them all
Hear humidity turning to frost with cracks
That acknowledge you all, that it's all over (now)

Dusks have become eternal darkness
And thus the shadows wander
Searching for human prey
They can't resist anymore the thirst
To possess the warmth of their blood

...And the dripping sound of it coming
Slowly passing beneath the ground
Finally the shadows grow inside you
And with eyes you caress the sky,
Bringer of relief

Outbrake of frost, embracing
Yet, the pounding under the surface remains
Endlessly... awaiting...
