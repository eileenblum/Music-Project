Drifting, in the bleak light of the sun
Towards places unseen
In the morning mists... and through their veil
I can barely sense, what hides beyond
But still I do wander in this cold
...Never to reach... to feel...
All the life is gone here... on these fields
Once so green... on the fields
By the forests... both endless
And lifeless
The sun touches the treetops
It'll never set... thought it'll never rise higher...
...To give life again on these lands
I can see this world growing old
(I can see the world)... cold
