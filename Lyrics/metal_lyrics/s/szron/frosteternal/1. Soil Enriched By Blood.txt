The moon is gone tonight
As we gather in the woods
The creatures of frost appear
And pacts are sealed with blood

The fires still burnt
In the cold morning breeze
And our shields shone bright...

When the horns sang for war
The enemy ran with fear
While our hordes attacked

Many brave men have died
And snow covered their bodies
...But against us they can't prevail
Blood enriched by soil...
...To raise new warriors proud
And to bring victories so great
Then we would (finally) get rid of christians
