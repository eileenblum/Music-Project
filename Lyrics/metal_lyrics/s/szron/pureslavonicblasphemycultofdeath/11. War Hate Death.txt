Out from the caves
Unleashed beasts of hate
Under the bloodred nightsky -
Lusting for carnage and... death
Possessed
- By hate
- Possessed!
Obsessed
- With warlust
- Obsessed!
Warriors
- Of the conqueror
- Attack!
War - hate - death
Crushing your skulls
Tormenting the weak
Hate towards all life
War against Christ!
Under the banners
Of ultimate warlords
The battles
Were fought and wan!
