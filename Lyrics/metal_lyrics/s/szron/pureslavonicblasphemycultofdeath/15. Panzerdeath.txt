The ancients call
- A sign for war
Horror spreads wings
Like a deadly fog
Gaschambers are fed
With last breaths
The crusaders return
- Reconquering life
Unholy divisions
Of panzerdeath storm!
Steel and flesh
- A marriage through hate
Tormenting of man,
Raping the suffering whores
Wrath and stench of blood
Legding the undead -
The gods of endless war
Unbereable pains are
Cast upon the Earth
Blitzkrieg of sadism and perversion
Antichristian guerilla
- Antihuman propaganda
Terroristic warfare
- Burning temples
Total genocides
- cleansed is impurity
MAss graves overflowing,
Yet the holocausts
Are still to come...
