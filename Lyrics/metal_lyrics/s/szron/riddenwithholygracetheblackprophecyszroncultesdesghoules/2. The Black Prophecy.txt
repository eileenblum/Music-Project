[performed by Szron]We are the vessels carrying inside the eternal black
the black, that endarkens even
your fearful yet calming thoughts
of the wrath of the most ferocious gods
and palpable hell and its sadistical torments

It is really not the worst fate
we shall bring upon yous
pathetic creatures
slaves to animal instincts
procreation, consumption, defecation
a disgrace
yet amusing puppets
created by some laughable god(s)

...We are coming

The tentacles of the gruesome evil
stretching out from the worlds beyond
evil, that satan is just a small shard of

Evil...

Clutching life
and strangling it
slowly and deliberately
savouring it coming away

Perhaps you never realised
perhaps you never learned
perhaps you never will

The sovereignty of that part of the energy
an opposite consciousness
opposite to all that makes it work for you
how could you imbeciles think of it being
just a warped part of the creator of your universe?

We, the chosen ones,
are only cast here
as its prophets
to announce it coming
and awaken the servants
at its table for the final
feast
