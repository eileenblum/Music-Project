the strenght is not in numbers
it lies in firmness of the spirit
the confines of Arisktocracy
dead monuments
of the race of Satan
the black light that is never to be seen
by the lesser folk
the power born to devour its children
in the triumphant blaze in extremis
we rejoice in hate and despair
wreaking destruction upon the world
unholy messengers of the Void
and its Black Lord
