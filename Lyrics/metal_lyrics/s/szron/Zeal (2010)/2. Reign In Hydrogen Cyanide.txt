we worship you
the One who rides the cloud of ashes
blown by freezing necrogales
above the black metropolies
of krematories
Thou art the Lord
and Thine is the Power 
the Kingdom and the Glory
vast dead desert 
monolithic tomb of the world
great creation of Nothingness
where under we necrolive
savouring death and torture
a reward
from the Master of the Gaschamber Labirynth
