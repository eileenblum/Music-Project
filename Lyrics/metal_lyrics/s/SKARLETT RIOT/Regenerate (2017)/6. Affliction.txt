Colours fade to grey
Darkness takes right over me
Feeding me misery, why can't you see
How this is infecting me
But here I stand, fighting for another day
I will not run, from who I have become

I cannot erase, I cannot disguise, I can't visualize
This cancer crawling through my skin
Crawling deep within me
It's haunting me, possessing me
I cannot see this cancer, crawling through my skin
Crawling deep within me

This world is fading away
It's a fight for survival
There's so much left to learn
But I keep running, running out of time
Before it's too late
Stand your ground
Stand up for your rights, you won't take me
You won't take me, not this time
Not this time

Colours fade to grey
Darkness takes right over me
I will not run, from who I have become
From who I have become

I cannot erase, I cannot disguise, I can't visualize
This cancer crawling through my skin
Crawling deep within me
It's haunting me, possessing me
I cannot see this cancer, crawling through my skin
Crawling deep within me

There's poison in my veins
There's sickness in my blood
I can't feel anything, anymore
This affliction in me, is corrupting you
I can't feel anything, anymore

There's poison in my veins
There's sickness in my blood
This weakness in me, is corrupting you
There's poison in my veins
There's sickness in my blood
This weakness in me, is corrupting you
