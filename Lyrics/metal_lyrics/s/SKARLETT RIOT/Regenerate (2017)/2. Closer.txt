This is real, they're crawling in
My skin
I cried for help, but no-one came
There's nowhere to escape
There's no time we're out of luck
I tried, I feel so cold
I'm falling down, in the pouring rain, I pray

They tear skin
They pull me down
Rip me apart
They tear my skin
They pull me down

No, it's to late to turn back now
It's getting closer
Is this the end of all we know?
If we give up we're gonna drown
It's getting closer
Is this the end of all we know?

Let's reshape this world
We're dying slowly fading
We need some guidance, a sense of direction
It's so dark, so deadly
We do we go from here?
Let's change our ways, despite the pain
Light the flame
Stay alive, don't be afraid
Light the flame
Stay alive, don't be afraid

No, it's to late to turn back now
It's getting closer
Is this the end of all we know?
If we give up we're gonna drown
It's getting closer
Is this the end of all we know?
Is this the end of all we know?

Light the flame
It's getting closer to the edge
Light the flame
And we can turn this all around
Light the flame
It's getting closer to the edge
Light the flame
And we can turn this all around

No, it's to late to turn back now
It's getting closer
Is this the end of all we know?
If we give up we're gonna drown
It's getting closer
Is this the end of all we know?
