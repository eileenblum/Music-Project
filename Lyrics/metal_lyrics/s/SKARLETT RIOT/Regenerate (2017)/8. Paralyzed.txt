This is how I feel
None of this seems real
I'm trapped inside this spinning wheel
With nowhere to run or hide
I lye here all alone
I cannot see, them wrap there hands
Around my neck, they smother me
I won't forget
I won't forget, you

I can't do this on my own
I suffocate, I slowly drown
I'm paranoid
I keep crying out for help
I suffocate, I slowly drown
I'm paranoid
I'm paralyzed

I stare into nothing
My mind begins to wonder
Wide awake at night
Wide awake at night
They are deep within me
Taking over me
I can't think straight
I can't shut them out no more
Please let me be

I can't do this on my own
I suffocate, I slowly drown
I'm paranoid
I keep crying out for help
I suffocate, I slowly drown
I'm paranoid
I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed

I can't hear a sound
I plummet to the ground
My soul is screaming, stay alive

I can't do this on my own
I suffocate, I slowly drown
I'm paranoid
I keep crying out for help
I suffocate
I'm paralyzed
