Throw me to the wolves
Why don't you beat me black and blue?
Make me suffer until I'm weak
Show me how I can bleed
Strike me when I'm down
Til I hit the ground
Drowning in my tears, to make this disappear

I won't give up until you
Break me, bury me alive
Take me down
I will not run, you will not
Break me, bury me alive
I will not run just to survive
Break me
Break me

You make me feel so sick
You're such a psycho hypocrite
Free me from these chains
Why have you imprisoned me
You kept me locked inside a cage
Made me feel I had no escape
I won't give up in desperation
I won't be your fool
No, I won't be that

Break me, bury me alive
Take me down
I will not run, you will not
Break me, bury me alive
I will not run just to survive
I will not run to stay alive
Break me
Break me

When will this stop
When will this end
You keep on pushing me, I won't give in

(Break)
Break me, bury me alive
Take me down
I will not run, you will not
Break me, bury me alive
Take me down
I will not run just to survive
Break me
Break me
Break me
