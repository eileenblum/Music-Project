I am lost and I am broken
Full of hatred and despair
All that's left in this disturbed memory
Is how you left me standing there
In the cold, in the dark
So alone, such a black heart
Now all I know is pain and anger
How you left me there lying dead
It was us against the world
Now I fight alone

I hope you choke, I hope you scream
I'll make you pay, why can't you see
You better keep your distance, stay away from me
I hope you choke, I hope you scream
I'll make you pay, why can't you see
You make me sick

Get out my head, get out my bed
I can't stand to see you here again
Ripped apart, deep down within
The unbearable pain that you put me in
This is real, you've made it clear
You ran away to save your skin
I do not care, you were never there
I do not care, you were never there
Save your breath, save yourself
You are sickening, sickening

I hope you choke, I hope you scream
I'll make you pay, why can't you see
You better keep your distance, stay away from me
I hope you choke, I hope you scream
I'll make you pay, why can't you see
You make me sick

You fucked this up for both of us
Now I stand alone
Did you even love me?
I see your face it haunts me
You walked out, out of the blue
Now you're all alone
All I did was love you
Did you even love me?
You fucked this up for both of us
Now I stand alone
Did you even love me?
I see your face it haunts me
It haunts me
It haunts me

I hope you choke, I hope you scream
I'll make you pay, why can't you see
You better keep your distance, stay away from me
I hope you choke, I hope you scream
I'll make you pay, why can't you see
You make me sick
