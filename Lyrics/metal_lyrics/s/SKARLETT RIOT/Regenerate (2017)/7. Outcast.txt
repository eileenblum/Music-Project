Something isn't right
Nothing feels the same
Everyone around me is a different shade of grey
What happened to our passion?
What happened to out souls?
We're ghosts inside this shell
Can we feel nothing here at all?
I'm just a defect

Where do we go from here?
Back up we are out of time
It's over, you better get running
You better get running
Where do we go from here?
Back up we are out of time
You better get running
Run for your life

Look at this mess we've made
Have some self control
Take hold of what is right
Or we'll be nothing here at all
Our choices make us human
Yet we act like animals
Destroying what we built here
Just to feel more powerful
I'm just an outcast, a defect

Where do we go from here?
Back up we are out of time
It's over, you better get running
You better get running
Where do we go from here?
Back up we are out of time
You better get running
Run for your life

I'm not a part of this
This is not who I am
I will not watch this world get burnt into ground
I'm not a part of this
This is not who I am
I will not watch this world get burnt into ground

Where do we go from here?
Back up we are out of time
It's over, you better get running
You better get running
Where do we go from here?
Back up we are out of time
You better get running
Run for your life
