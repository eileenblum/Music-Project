We've got a lot to learn from our mistakes
Why are we prisoners of our past
Like shattered glass
We are broken, broken
Well sticks and stones, will not break our bones
Come on and try and knock us off our feet
Go on and bring us down, you will never defeat us

We'll make it out alive this time
Let the shadows fall
We'll escape the storm, some how
Stand or fall
We won't give up no, not this time
We won't stay calm
We'll make it out alive
We'll make it out this time
Stand or fall

Don't look back, we're gonna leave this town
You made us strong when we were weak
Throw us all your negativity
Who are you to make us fell so small
Come on and say it, to my face
You're such a coward, a disgrace

We won't hold back no more, ever again
This time we ain't listening

We'll make it out alive this time
Let the shadows fall
We'll escape the storm, some how
Stand or fall
We won't give up no, not this time
We won't stay calm
We'll make it out alive
We'll make it out this time
Stand or fall

We won't hold back no more, ever again
This time we ain't listening

We'll make it out alive this time
Let the shadows fall
We'll escape the storm, some how
Stand or fall
We won't give up no, not this time
We won't stay calm
We'll make it out alive
We'll make it out this time
Stand or fall
