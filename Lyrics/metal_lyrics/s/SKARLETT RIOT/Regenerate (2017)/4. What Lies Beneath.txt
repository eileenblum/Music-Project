Is this the end
When the darkness is creeping in
I'm too tired to fake it, too tired to pretend
You're too afraid to speak your mind
Terrified to step out of line
Those mechanic minds, always think alike
Come closer, I dare you

You better believe me
The unbearable suffering
Every time that I break down
You can't see, inside me
You better believe me
The unbearable suffering
Every time that I break down
You can't see, you better believe me

I have no fear
So don't shatter my hopes and dreams
Why can't we fight for what we truly believe
No one knows what lies beneath
Why do you judge what you cannot see
You're so ignorant and so naive
Stay the hell away from me
Come closer, I dare you

You better believe me
The unbearable suffering
Every time that I break down
You can't see, inside me
You better believe me
The unbearable suffering
Every time that I break down
You can't see, you better believe me

I dare you, get closer
Try and drag me down
Get closer, I dare you
Try and drag me down

You better believe me
The unbearable suffering
Every time that I break down
You can't see, inside me
You better believe me
The unbearable suffering
Every time that I break down
You can't see, you better believe me

You better believe me
The unbearable suffering
Every time that I break down
You can't see, inside me
You better believe me
I won't put up with this shit anymore
