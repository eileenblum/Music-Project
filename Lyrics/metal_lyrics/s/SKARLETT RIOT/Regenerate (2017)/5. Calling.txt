I need you to know I learnt from my mistakes
I took it all for granted, I let you down
I'm sorry for the things I said
I admit that I'm not perfect, if it's all the same
Well one thing I know, I miss you so
I'm hurting more than you will ever know
Tore us apart I wouldn't let you go
Why did I walk away

Why can't you hear me calling
I'm calling out to you
Come back to me I'm falling down
I'm calling out to you
Calling out to you

As these days pass by, well I don't half regret
Walking away from you
You deserve so much more than I can truly give
I won't hold you back no more
I wish you the best, I truly do
Not a day goes by, when I don't think of you
How cold it feels, without you there
Why did I walk away

Why can't you hear me calling
I'm calling out to you
Come back to me I'm falling down
I'm calling out to you
Why can't you hear me calling
I'm calling out to you
Come back to me I'm falling down
I'm calling out, calling out to you
Calling out to you
Calling out to you

I'm calling
Calling out

Why can't you hear me calling
I'm calling out to you
Come back to me I'm falling down
I'm calling out to you
Why can't you hear me calling
I'm calling out to you
Come back to me I'm falling down
I'm calling out, calling out to you
