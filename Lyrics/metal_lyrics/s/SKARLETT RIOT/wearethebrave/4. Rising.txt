I saw it coming now
When I looked into your eyes
You knew I wouldn't last
In this cruel world, you can't deny
They pulled me down
And dragged me round like a puppet
On the string now
Controlled by you, made out a fool

Like a phoenix up above
Rising from the flames
I'll be back again
I feel much stronger now
You won't know how
To shoot me down again
These wounds have healed with time
But they scar for life
I won't be hurt again
Like a phoenix up above
Rising from the flames
I'll be back again,
I'll be back again
I'll be back again

You've got a lot of nerve
To attack me with your venom
You've got a lot to learn
You're not so shy when you're alone
I'll get revenge
I'm not as shy as I once was
This world is better off
Without people like you
Oh am I too cruel?
Oh am I too cruel?

Like a phoenix up above
Rising from the flames
I'll be back again
I feel much stronger now
You won't know how
To shoot me down again
These wounds have healed with time
But they scar for life
I won't be hurt again
Like a phoenix up above
Rising from the flames
I'll be back again,
I'll be back again
I'll be back again

You'll get what you deserve
I'll get my revenge, revenge!
You're poisonous mouth, won't hurt me now
I'm immune to your curse and all your wickedness
All your wickedness

Like a phoenix up above
Rising from the flames
I'll be back again
I feel much stronger now
You won't know how
To shoot me down again
These wounds have healed with time
But they scar for life
I won't be hurt again
Like a phoenix up above
Rising from the flames
I'll be back again,
I'll be back again
I'll be back again
I'll be back again
I'll be back again
