We are the brave
We are the saviours
We live to protect and stand as one
You won't bring us down
You won't get inside us
We will light up this battle ground
This wall will cave in
We'll never give in
We'll rise to the top and you'll stay down
I won't surrender to your commands
I won't turn back, I won't turn back

Whoa, you won't divide us
Let it go now, come and try and shoot us down
Whoa, you won't divide us
Let it go now, you won't divide us
You won't divide us
You won't divide us
You won't divide us

I've met people like you before
Putting your lives above us
It's not a game, this see through pain
Don't gamble what you can't afford
The pressure is crawling in
?
I won't take much more of this
I won't take much more of this
You're so full of shit
I'm so sick of it

Whoa, you won't divide us
Let it go now, come and try and shoot us down
Whoa, you won't divide us
Let it go now, you won't divide us
You won't divide us
Come and try and shoot us down
You won't divide us
Yeah

Whoa, you won't divide us
Let it go now, come and try and shoot us down
Whoa, you won't divide us
Let it go now, you won't divide us
You won't divide us
You won't divide us
You won't divide us
You won't divide us
