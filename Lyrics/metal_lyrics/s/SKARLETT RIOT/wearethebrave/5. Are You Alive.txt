Strangers pass you by, faces you once knew
Living in this lonely world, your only friend is you
You walk the streets alone, watching the world pass by
Ignorance is all you knew, It's time to open your eyes
Open your eyes

Are you alive?
How can you live like this?
Give us a sign
Can you hear us at all?
I've got a question, so listen to me
Answer it wisely, don't make me repeat
Are you alive?
Are you alive?
Are you alive?

Vanity is all you know, take a look around
Live your life, don't waste your time
Pretending to be who you're not
Don't judge what you don't know, listen to what we say
Together we can push away the hate, and all of this pain
All of this pain

Are you alive?
How can you live like this?
Give us a sign
Can you hear us at all?
I've got a question, so listen to me
Answer it wisely, don't make me repeat
Are you alive?
Are you alive?
Are you alive?

Are you alive?
How can you live like this?
Give us a sign
Can you hear us at all?
I've got a question, so listen to me
Answer it wisely, don't make me repeat
Are you alive?
Are you alive?
Are you alive?
