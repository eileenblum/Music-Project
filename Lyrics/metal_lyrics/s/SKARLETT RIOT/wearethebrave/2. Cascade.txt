What are you waiting for?
Time won't stand still for you
The hands on the clock keep ticking
Why be so insecure?
Who cares what they might say
Life's short don't throw it away

Like sand cascading through an hourglass
There's no time to spare, no time to spare
Like sand cascading through an hourglass
This time I won't give in, I won't give in

Don't take what you have for granted
Never wish for more
Take a step back for a minute and look around you
We're living in one world
Searching for the right path
Life's short don't fuck it up now

Like sand cascading through an hourglass
There's no time to spare, no time to spare
Like sand cascading through an hourglass
This time I won't give in, I won't give in

One chance, one chance is all we have
One chance, one chance is all we have
One chance, one chance is all we have
One chance, one chance is all we have
All we have
All we have
All we have

Like sand cascading through an hourglass
There's no time to spare, no time to spare
Like sand cascading through an hourglass
This time I won't give in, I won't give in

One chance, one chance is all we have
One chance, one chance is all we have
One chance, one chance is all we have
One chance, one chance is all we have
