It's a race against time
On your marks, get set, let's go
Make the move and question
Are you really living your life?
Days go by so make a change
There's no need to feel this way
Trapped and broken inside
Struggling to sleep at night

Oh
Wake up, wake up
Stand up, stand up
Can we feel something, cause I can't waste another day
What are you waiting for?
Wake up, wake up
Stand up, stand up
Can we feel something, cause I can't waste another day
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

When the world comes closing in
Rotating against you
You feel you have no purpose
To be here, to be here
There's a path for all of us
But have you chose the wrong road?
Well turn around and take a step back
Through another door
Through another door

Wake up, wake up
Stand up, stand up
Can we feel something, cause I can't waste another day
What are you waiting for?
Wake up, wake up
Stand up, stand up
Can we feel something, cause I can't waste another day
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Let's make a difference in our lives
We all get lost sometimes
Stand tall, together we will rise
Now it's time to change
Let's make a difference in our lives
We all get lost sometimes
Stand tall, together we will rise
Together we will rise
Together we will rise

Wake up, wake up
Stand up, stand up
Can we feel something, cause I can't waste another day
What are you waiting for?
Wake up, wake up
Stand up, stand up
Can we feel something, cause I can't waste another day
What are you waiting for?
Wake up, wake up
Stand up, stand up
Wake up, wake up
Stand up, stand up
Wake up
