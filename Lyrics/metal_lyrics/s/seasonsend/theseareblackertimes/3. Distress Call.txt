These are blacker times

These days will fall down
Even now I seem to drown
When the world falls down
Will you catch me?

These days are hard to live
These words are hard to find
The wine is hard to taste
With thorns in my mind
I've betrayed myself again
A life gone up in flames
It must be better this way
We will wake up one day
Watch me fall whilst I weep
