I cry for rebirth and strength inside of you,
After all the summers die,
Hail storms surround me...

So misunderstood,
I cry for rebirth.
Unsullied yet raped,
Usurpers of heaven.

Why can't you feel me die?

My soul is turning black - Elysium's torn apart.
I feel I'm slipping back - Be still my bleeding heart.
My soul is turning black - A lake where black swans swim.
I feel I'm slipping back - Within this life I care not...

Sleeping in the shadow's,
Eyes that I abhor,
I just can't cry...
Anymore.

My life is turning black - I feel I'm slipping back.
I feel I'm slipping back - Be still my bleeding heart.
A lake where black swans swim - In a lake where black swans swim.
Within this life I cannot win - In this life I just can't win.

Why can't you feel me die?
