I promise you serenity,
That we will never hold,
Your life reflects eternity,
As I weep this love of old.

I see my child in your eyes
I see the mirror never lies
In scattered fragments on the floor
I see the self I knew before.

At pain's side I now reside
Safe again my eleventh bride
This skin I'll cast away no more
But rot in rage as I did before.

"Hold you close, protect your soul
Shun the sinners, from me they stole
My inner sense of right and wrong
To my beliefs you shall belong.
Learn from me, you evil child
My blessed church you've now defiled
In disregard I watch you grow
A life from me you'll never know."

All I ever wished for has been washed away,
Now, as I leave you with my last embrace,
A love beyond everything will dominate,
My child won't look back so unable to face...
...The Past

Too starved to feed
Your every need
Believe my plead
To make me bleed.

Believe in me...
...believe in me.

I promise you everything...
I cry just to think of you.
