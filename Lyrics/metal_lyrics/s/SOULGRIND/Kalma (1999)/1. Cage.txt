Throughout the illusions of life
Mindsweep of everlasting
The good and evil, is where it dwells
Of so pale wisdom over rated
Soul polution and destruction
are those they call solutions
Marked chaos for the slime crusade
inside the twilight of inner revenge
You see the ghosts ...freedom
Now let me go ...freedom
Do I believe? ....freedom
No, let me go
father sin, father delight
I insist on winning, I have won before
Thrill me with unspoken wisdom of bizarre
cage is in the crooked overdose of love
How the man of god 
Can feel the pain and be one
How the dead shall speak for the wholehearted
When there is none
My voice is my god my mind is my weapon
Tell me you holy man of twisted mind
Is the voice you hear still around
When our unbaptised times arrive
Can you hear the screams of your weak divine
