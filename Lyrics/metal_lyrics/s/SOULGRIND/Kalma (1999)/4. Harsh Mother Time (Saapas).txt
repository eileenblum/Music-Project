The young men of the clan slid out of their sins
Tied on the tree on snow frozen silver-hard
Word is death for the falsehearted
God is in steel and blood is running black
Harsh Mother Time yelled
Wellcome o'dreadful ones
Long now I have watched for you
Harsh Mother Time howled
Her voice rang out 
from death's night
From under tree
Under pine
From the forest's empty depths

"Life cares about the morrow,
Mana conjures up the past
The grim way down to Tuoni
Life harsher than the death"
As men so proud yelled fire to the Gods
Bleed for the motherland
The battle axe is ringing over these murmuring rivers, 
Over these unbaptised lands
As men so proud yelled fire to the Gods
Bleed for the motherland
She walked towards what she heard
She obeyd what her eyes saw
She went where her mind bade her
And she came to the seashore
The great mind's estuary
Where god is man
