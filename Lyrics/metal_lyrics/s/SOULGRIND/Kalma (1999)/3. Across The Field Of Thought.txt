Dying matters whitter for the minding thought
Love, hate, birth, death
Mirrors I bleed among
Through lust through pain molded ,united
Nothingness only dust seeded
Blank soul breed
Into the pit of forbidden
choaking breath by breath
Sweet emotions of solid dark
Light has weight, nevermore
meaningless wonder dustwar
Across the field of thought
Old man scarves creatures
Molds them into emotions
Wice is he ,only he knows
But more is and more were ,evermore
My wisdom flys beyond
The gates of golden lakes
The dark waves of pleasure
The light for the evermore
Nevermore
