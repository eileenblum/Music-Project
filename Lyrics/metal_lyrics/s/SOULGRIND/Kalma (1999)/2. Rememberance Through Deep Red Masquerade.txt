Shade shivers riot through my veins
Shattered memories of lust divine
When red turns black and god is me
Holding down the light of life
Blades wisdom of bizarre running wild
Thousands of stars float inside 
Life melts molds into me wildside
Power, when blood spills deep
Brave runs the sky so red and high
Sweet emotions of reborn twilight
Rememberance through masquerade
Rise again the graceful death
Bloodlust hellspawn glidence
I am the truth the evidence
