I am, your horned
God of desire and destruction
Pleasure king of pain
I am the ride to the mountain of bizarre ways
Wings darkened lustful moarn
black rainbow
Come to the beginning
As I shiver your brain and mold it into mine
The blood is black for the marked ones
The souls fed with molded flesh of cross
The culture underworld rapid fire
The sign is truth and truth is me
I am the one I am the god I am the king of bizarre 
I am the one I am the god slavery is yours 
Bizarre ways of love divine
My life's on your hands
Welcome to the goatride
My heart and soul to unite
Pleasures of unknown
Welcome to the goatride
Feel my pain my beloved one
The steel and coldness of me
I am your brain you loved one
Brothers of pain will us unite
Prepare the goat for the meal
No more vivid daydreams
