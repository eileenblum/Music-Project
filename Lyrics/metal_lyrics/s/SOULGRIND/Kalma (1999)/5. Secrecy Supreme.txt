Our deeds our mind through the thousands years
None of those jehovian lies as cross fades
We hold the key of sign the lightning of life
As we ride the years again and again
Marked chaos of the crusade is to come
We hold the key of secrecy supreme
Mighty ways of skies above
hen the day and night unite
For the strong the life howls ( ei ekassa )
As the truth of our times ( ei ekassa )
Warriors hear the whisper of wind
When you ride through the skies
You are the ones, ones to die
And the heart of pagan fire
None of these borders, where the sky bleeds red
Will be praised by the unnamed gods
Our minds our souls will be the ones
The ones who rule after the time has come
When the fire is ice, it is time
To revial, secrecy supreme

Gods
Pride
Pagan 
Fire
Ride
Among
Us
