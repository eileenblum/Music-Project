Slowly my mind whitters through the pain
Floating among the mist
Collapsing, rambling through the gates
Into the place, where none lives
Where flowers grow black
Where the frost is eternal
I see myself upon the grim smile
The past hunting and future escaping
What was shall not be
Forever shall I thicken this belief
[Tanja:]
Grey shades of love
Darkest is the path unknown
Where flowers grow black
Where the frost is eternal
Grey shades of love
Darker is the path unknown
Where the life stands still
Is the death smiling, laughing
Lost is the will to stand tall
The soul blackened love lost
Lowered is the shield of bravery
And all because of the one
Love united to the pain
Lost and now all is gone
And To the death shall I ride
Through the frost, through the stones, 
through the gates of neverending rain
