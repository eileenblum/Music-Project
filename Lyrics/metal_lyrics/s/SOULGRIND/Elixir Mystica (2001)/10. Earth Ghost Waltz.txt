Unspoken were the words
When smile and croocked pain unite
Together they are the joy
Skinned through ultimate overdose
O'my mother who bore me
It is better if I flee
Better I go from these lands
Go to Kalma's grove
Unspoken were the words
When smile and croocked pain unite
Still gentle and so beautiful
Chained with the path of purity
Through the stone
My divine
Until the frolic cries
Chain me
My divine
Into the winter of the time
O'my mother who bore me
It is better if I flee
Better I go to Tuonela's yards
Where Earth-Ghost rises from the earth
