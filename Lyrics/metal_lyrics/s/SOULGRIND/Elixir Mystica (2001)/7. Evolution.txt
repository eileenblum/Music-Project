Stoned hills sermon to the skies
Cradle of heavenly cry
Seasons pass in rapid fierce
As one stands tall
As the ashes land grim chaos
The dark passage step one
Search for the barer for dark lust
To darken an angel to breed
I am the evolution
The de
Where I can fuck an angel
I am the creator
New pain, new joy
The season, the life, the dawn
I am in the revolution
Where the black is the pure
Where I can fuck an angel
I am the evolution
I am in the revolution
I am the creator, the holy one
Through my hands
Begins Sin to beauty, to love
To bowe to sacrifice worlds
For me for black 
Nocturnal majestic twilight
Serenity never 
Shades the brave
Now the revenge is truth
And the truth is mine
Enter into the gardens of eden
Sour seed bleeding black blood
Breaking the circle of innocence
As blood flys the ancient howl for freedom
Once angel, now pierced
As red floats between her tighs
The one is now in all
The new kingdom is to conquer
