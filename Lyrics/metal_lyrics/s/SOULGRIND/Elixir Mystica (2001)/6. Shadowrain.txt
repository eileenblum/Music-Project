Wizardous razorblades shadowed
Cutting the edge of time
leading me back 
back to the flames
My bodily shell,
slowly eroding
Circulating through my every, vessel
Shall I stand up 
and enter the circle
I struck the worm with my sword
The lizard slid in the rock
Fire spurted from the blade's path
The stone flew in two
I killed the smiling man
With my sword of flery edge
The flower of all christendom
The lizard slid in the rock
Shadowrain
Deep in the soul and crawling inside
Into the pain
God shall bleed tonite
[Tanja:]
Sweet sickening lullabies
Of the fate undivine
Feel the fire inside you
Sealing the wounds you bleed
Sweet sickening lullabies
Seductive, glittering, destiny
