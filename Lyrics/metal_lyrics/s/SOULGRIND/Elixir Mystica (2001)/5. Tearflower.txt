To forest I yelled
Through forest I lived
All living I respected
Thy respected what I was
Why didn't you leave me alone
To stand proud on my own 
But a murderer you made out of me
With the hand of your god on your cross
The death was me, revenge so sweet
With fire in my eyes thunder of the skies
I ran with the thousand flames
With the heart of growling bears
The greatest is
Darkness circle breed
Smallest is
Son. Moon Golden field
Empty is the universe. True winter alone is
emptiness. Unknown, frozen stilness
Thus we came
Thus we went
Where we spent the most time of ours
