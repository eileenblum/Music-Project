My blade shines as your sun
I am the man, only god
I fade, but still am, strongly
I feed the pale, with shadows of my fate
Black Stone March... Rage
For the forests of souls so divided
The rain of blood is to you to unite
My blade, shine of the messiah 
Among shadows are the demons of your desire
Through the gates of the golden area
The dark hollowed faces crawl
With the might of darkened sorrow
Through the Black Stone March
Endless stars of purity
See how it conquers
Your mind, soul, body
Through the sign of ending
Endless stars of purity
Darkness, my wild beauty
