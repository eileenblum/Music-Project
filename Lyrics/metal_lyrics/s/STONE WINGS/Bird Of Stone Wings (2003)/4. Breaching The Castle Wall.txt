[Lyrics: Beau Dyer.]
[Music: Stuart Prickett.]

Like a madman
Who beats a dead horse
I have wasted centuries
Looking for something
That doesn't exist

But no more
I have cut out my fucking eyes

I have searched until I fell
But there were no ivory towers
Only this unyielding stone wall

Like the carrion crow
Who bewails the dead sheep
I have wasted centuries
Sowing shut the eyes of the blind

But no more
For I have breached the castle wall.
