The last hand has been dealt
In this game of cards played with jokers
And the hand? The hand I took with me
Though it left a crimson trail
So follow if you will.

The last stand has been made,
Made into something
That no longer resembles a stand
Of myself? I stood until my legs gave way
Though none were approaching.

The last nut has been cracked
At this table I built for myself
And the nut? Has become a dagger
It was not what it was cracked up to be
So cut the cards.
