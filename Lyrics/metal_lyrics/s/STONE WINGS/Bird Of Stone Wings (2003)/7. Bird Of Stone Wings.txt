[Lyrics: Jamie Marsh.]
[Music: Stuart Prickett, Beau Dyer, Hamish Gould.]

Assemble savage machines
With erstwhile morbidity
Allow thee certain substance that I adore
Kiss my blood compassionately

So alone within leviathan's flood
Exotic world that lies within
Transcendence reflected in anti-life
Orgasm of sin's mutilated promise

Loathing life's charming fury
Infernal secrets riddled with glee
Sing to them, elixir obtained forever
Handled with rising madness

Unspeakable misery bleeds
The fires of earth 'till its rebirth
Granted silence through the dark
But cursed from the entrance above

The stars masturbate jealously
With wings of blissful gifts
Where sleeping shadows wake
And pseudo midnight lies

Covered in lunacy, the sower of destinies
Prostitute the carvings, the souls
Painful cuts through the mirror
Calling the sought after highs

I crucifier of planets, iris of pain
Dead star of stone, in hooves of fire
Their undying waltz
Please divest my wings of hate

Black laced eucharist, blue agaves
Wall of humankind's latent image
Festival of death for all to see
Weavers serenade speaking in tongues

Treacherous intimacy within stone wings.
