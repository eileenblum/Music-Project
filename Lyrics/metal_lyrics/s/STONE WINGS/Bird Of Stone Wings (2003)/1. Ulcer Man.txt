[I: Beast]

Man without law
His sulfur kingdom of the blind
Kill them all, their miserable lives
Slaughter of the innocence
Prodigal father exudes grace

[II: Blood And Roses]

Diabolical domain
Cruel with intentions of madness
Harvest the spirits of the dead
Dripping with blood filled tears
Dead man who walks eternal is alone
His endless beauty cut to ribbons
Ritual desire, blissful games won

[III: Diseased]

Disgustingly deformed birth
Sickness and disease he gives
The haunting scarlet formed
Mutant cunts, rotten faces
Amputation of the soul
No mouths to speak
Gifts of torture welcomed
Emotional chaos, parallax views
Death upon the earth given pleasure

[IV: Vanity]

His vanity vile, the egotist unequalled
Mirror of the beast
Chronicles of Mort have begun
Dynasty of the master
Torturer of a thousand generations comes
You're going to die

[V: Death]

Fear in gods children exposed
Evaporating life, walking sick
Wounds calling for self destruction
Deadly shadow of the killing spree
Feed me, taste me
Destroy his memories, now dead
Children of the dark born

[VI: Ulcer Man]

You walk behind
Dead inside and falling
Silence now found
Beast of the apocalypse
Tears of man obsessed
