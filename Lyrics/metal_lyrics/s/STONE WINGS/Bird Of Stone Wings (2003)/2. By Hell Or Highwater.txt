[Lyrics: Beau Dyer.]
[Music: Stuart Prickett.]

Arrived at last but soon to part
An envenomed arrow healed mine heart
Chase did I nymphs 'neath sullied tree
Bound by aesthetic ideology

Angel faced yet devil wrought
Not of worth yet dearly bought
Surprise in the western hills
Lake of sand to drink your fill

Iron shod yet light as air
Lost all 'twas dear without a care
By hell or highwater it will be done
By blazing moon, reflective sun

The darkened music that I see
Mortally wounded finally free
Sink beneath the twofold depths
For they giveth life yet stealeth death.
