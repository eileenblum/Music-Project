[Lyrics: Stuart Prickett.]
[Music: Stuart Prickett.]

Within storm filled skies
That darken my dreamland
My night eyes stare
I witness the downtrodden

In halls of sorrow the passionless mingle
Clad in life's despair all around is dying

Vast oceans of grief call my name
Rivers of sorrow, chasms of hate
Forbidden realms to conquest
The quest eternal

In darkening fields I run
Through the fabled land of night's domain
Kingdom of divine reverence dying
Its putrid air caresses me
And the lunar mountains darken...

Onwards I tread through unworn paths of night
The gnarled woods greet my eyes, an unreal dreamscape
I embark on my quest to save my dreamland
The final light of its existence is fading

The lunar mountains beckon me forward
The final truth is there for me to find
They speak to me in my dreams
Now my own reality.
