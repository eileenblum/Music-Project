Rule behind a mask of revelations
Truths denied, keep the world in duality
Earth trapped in a massive scheme
Caught deep inside within distorted dreams
Blur the sight of those who try to see

All that you believe was made to deceive you
Waves of confusion are flowing to control and withhold

[Chorus:]
New sight, watch how all things unfold
Endeavours of the ones who remain in control
Insight comes with a new worldview
And gateways will open anew

Fuel the flame, reclaim the inner fire
(Alpha and Omega) Erase, replace distorted views

We stand before apparent ends and beginnings
but nothing ever seems to change

Herds inside a maze of vast deception
Fools abide in this false reality
It is never what it seems
Beneath the surface of apparent themes
Burns the light of world wide deceit

All that you believe was made to deceive you
Waves of confusion are flowing to control and withhold

[Chorus]

Fuel the flame, reclaim the inner fire
(Alpha and Omega) Erase, replace distorted views

[Lead: Kjellgren]
[Lead: Nilsson]

Signs of the coming completion,
unwinding the coil as the serpent slowly swallows its tail
And behind the course of historical events stand the grand illuminators
Biding their time while watching worlds fall

Plans that face completion, an agenda of tyranny
Process of depletion with the Alpha Omega untied

[Lead: Nilsson]

Unknown shadows behind the light,
they're starting to emerge into sight now

[Chorus]
