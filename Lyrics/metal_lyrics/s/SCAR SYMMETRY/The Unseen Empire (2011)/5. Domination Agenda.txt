Come storms of dawning revolutions
And sow the seed that will destroy
The waters deep conceal monumental depth
Yet hides the vastness from your eyes

[Pre-chorus:]
This goes deeper than you know
Further and deeper the secrets flow
Be prepared to walk alone
Care not of consequence

[Chorus:]
Down the never ending pathways where the secrets flow
Down the everlasting spiral of the dreams they hold
You're finding a world where the domination agenda charges forth
Down the never ending passage of the secrets untold

Come forth in silent retribution
Strike from within the mental void
A starless sky will keep you buried in doubt
Apparent emptiness deceive the eyes

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Veiled in disguise, secrets hide deep inside our minds
Avoid the gaze of our eyes

[Lead: Nilsson]

New paths paved to re-educate generations
The divine quest to block all illuminati ideology
Deep inside secrets hide in disguise

Down never ending gateways where the secrets flow
Down never ending spirals of the dreams that they hold

Down the never ending pathways where the secrets flow
Down the everlasting spiral of the dreams they hold
You're finding a world where the domination agenda charges forth
Down the never ending passage of the secrets untold
