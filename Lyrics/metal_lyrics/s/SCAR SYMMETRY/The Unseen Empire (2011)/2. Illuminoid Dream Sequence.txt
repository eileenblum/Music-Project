Time stops inside the realms of wonder, roam with thoughts in flight
Visions flow down from another realm
A mind hypnotized while sinking under, breaking ties that bind
Thinking all's been said and done

Come, now step inside and enter our forgotten dominion
Experience all, become one of our portals into your world

Abruptly bliss then fell asunder, joy replaced with fright
In encounter with a force insane
Of worlds they spoke, devoid of life
Where every being present soar unborn, brooding out of sight

Gods without eyes drinking from your feeble mind, a thirst divine
Drain mankind and we will be reborn, replacing all human life

Come, you stepped inside and entered our forgotten dominion
Experience all, become one of our portals into your world

[Lead:Nilsson]

Skies set ablaze, the sight remains of dying worlds
Fear not the fate that follows, it has just begun

[Lead:Nilsson]

Come, you stepped inside and entered our forgotten dominion
Experience all, become one of our portals into your world
