Black nobility plan the extinction, eradication through conspiracy
It's there for all to see, the guidestones of their creed
The mass extinction phase

Burnt buried truth
Dividing to rule this earth on the skewed wings of false adoration
Truth, it is buried deep in dissent
Lies came to be the means to their end
Fractures of the world open wide
The blind shall lead the blind

[Chorus:]
And the light benign of soul and heart
Lies cradled in fear
They alternate the dreams of man
To embrace what will unfold

Strange monument
Engraved with the words that display our imminent grand decimation
Truth, it is buried deep in dissent
Lies came to be the means to their end
Fractures of the world open wide
Rotting from inside

[Chorus]

These words are carved in stone, there for all the world to see
No fate or destiny to call our own

[Lead: Nilsson]

These words are carved in stone, there for all the world to see
Thereâs no fate or destiny to call our own

[Lead: Nilsson]

[Lead: Kjellgren]

Feed on our fears
Soon time to erase all who reject the new world's machinations
Truth, it is buried deep in dissent
Lies came to be the means to their end
Fractures of the world open wide
Decimate mankind

[Chorus]

These words are carved in stone, there for all the world to see
No fate or destiny to call our own
