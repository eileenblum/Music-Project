This is year zero, all we knew has died
the mutiny came so sudden, killing yesterday

Thoughts that forced discordance away,
once more an era is fading
Whatever dreams we're reaching to claim
decides the path we are taking

Gone forever, we are done with worldviews mechanical
(None shall) None shall ever be a slave to thoughts inside their heads

Mind is the master, Morphogenesis
This structure remained untrodden, a new reality

Gone forever, we are done with worldviews mechanical
(None shall) None shall ever be a slave to thoughts inside their heads

Gone forever, we are done with worldviews mechanical
(None shall) None shall ever be a slave to thoughts inside their heads

Bleeding through all spheres
all our thoughts, all our fears gaining life
soul, mind, heart, feeding starts now
rising from ashen dust
through our sins, karmic cost
measured souls
weigh our hearts, judge our thoughts - no

Thoughts that forced discordance away,
once more an era is fading
Whatever dreams we're reaching to claim
decides the path we are taking

Gone forever, we are done with worldviews mechanical
(None shall) None shall ever be a slave to thoughts inside their heads

Gone forever, we are done with worldviews mechanical
(None shall) None shall ever be a slave to thoughts inside their heads
