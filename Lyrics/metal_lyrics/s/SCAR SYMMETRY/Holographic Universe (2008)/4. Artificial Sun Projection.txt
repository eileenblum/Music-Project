An invented sun, rays reflecting the cosmic glow
Deceptive radiance
Our invented gods halt the active mind
No alteration

Illusory acts in circles count the days and nights
Earth time
Finding the only way out means to arise, ascend

I shall ascend

Form the passing time, building day and night

Thy will be done, shape the sand to hours
My time will come, clear as day the signs
Conceptional, shape the hands of ours
Your will's been done since the dawn of time

Forever to renew the universe
Waiting as cold daylight turns into night

An invented sun, rays reflecting the cosmic glow
Deceptive radiance
Our invented gods halt the active mind
No alteration

Thy will be done, shape the sand to hours
My time will come, clear as day the signs
Conceptional, shape the hands of ours
Your will's been done since the dawn of time
