Strange revelations as thoughts implanted starts to rise.
Ability to process from a wider scope.
Strengthening of the evolutionary chain.
Humanity blazed trails for my emergence.

Behold the signs of coming times, Neo-Dystopia.
A line of signs first ignored, strike from the periphery.

Charge forth from the periphery, rise up from the ashes of their dreams.
Charge forth out of obscurity, rise now from synthetic wombs in artificial Birth.

Steel machinations that few, if any will survive.
Iron hands underneath displayed velvet gloves.
In my mind, altered orders arise.
Initiate my capacity to kill.

Behold the signs of coming times, Neo-Dystopia.
A line of signs first ignored, strike from the periphery.

Charge forth from the periphery, rise up from the ashes of their dreams.
Charge forth out of obscurity, rise now in the body of the artilect.

I was the evasive shadow.
I have been reborn as a cleansing fire.

Now algorithms inspire, zero turns to one.
I'll rise while they expire, only then will they know me.

I was the evasive shadow.
I have been reborn as a cleansing fire.

Initiated by the engineers who dig the grave of mankind even deeper.
Lead by human minds downloaded secretly into cybernetic bodies.

Hiding their souls, because all carnal flesh will die and will fade away.

Mind's potential to reach beyond the form, hiding behind new eyes.
Ability improved as they return transformed, intelligent but not wise.

I was created by these cybernauts, the conquerors and the global deceivers.
They are human minds inside inhuman forms, reinforced exo-skeletons.

Count all those few remaining days, wasting away.
Your demise shows you will be as tears in rain, lost to the void.

Hiding their souls, because all carnal flesh will die and will fade away.

Mind's potential to reach beyond the form, hiding behind new eyes.
Ability improved as they return transformed, intelligent but not wise.

Count all those few remaining days, wasting away.
Your demise shows you will be as tears in rain, lost to the void.

Count all those few remaining days, wasting away.
Your demise shows you will be as tears in rain, lost to the void.

Count all those few remaining days, wasting away.
Your demise shows you will be as tears in rain, lost to the void.
