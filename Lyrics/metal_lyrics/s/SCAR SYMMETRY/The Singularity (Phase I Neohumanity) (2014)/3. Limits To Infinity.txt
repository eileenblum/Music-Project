With faith you receive deceit
Parts of a fractured whole
Numbers of false equations
That the masses will obey

There is an exit that's kept unknown
For the ones unworthy of the elite
A plan to abandon earth
As we're colonizing another world

World unknown
Beyond this charred place where you were born
As below
So above is the phrase that you seek

Each cell holds a universe within
Fed by a million suns
Expand outwards on repeat
One object holds the key to all

THERE ARE LIMITS TO INFINITY
IN THE RESTRICTED LEMNISCATE
THERE ARE BODIES INFINITE
OUTSIDE THIS EARTHLY DOME

Eradication of the void
We know
Nothing is nothing in this vibrant world

Unveil words of the elite
That seek to gain control
The masters reach ascension
While the slaves must face decay

This is the time when the conquerors of deep space
Reaches out to infinity
And so the unfortunate remain
Feeding upon their own despair

World unknown
Beyond this charred place where you were born
As below
So above is the phrase that you seek

Each cell holds a universe within
Fed by a million suns
Expand outwards on repeat
One object holds the key to all

THERE ARE LIMITS TO INFINITY
IN THE RESTRICTED LEMNISCATE
THERE ARE BODIES INFINITE
OUTSIDE THIS EARTHLY DOME

Soon the day will come
Destruction of the meek
Is imminent
Their programmed fear ensures we will
Be reborn as gods

Culture infected
No venom detected
Agenda erected no charge
Vaccines that promote disease

Tyrants elected
Survivors selected
The dead resurrected to rise
As we merge with the machines

LIMITS TO INFINITY

Fed by a million suns
Expand outwards on repeat
One object holds the key to all

THERE ARE LIMITS TO INFINITY
IN THE RESTRICTED LEMNISCATE
THERE ARE BODIES INFINITE
OUTSIDE THIS EARTHLY DOME

THERE ARE LIMITS TO INFINITY
IN THE RESTRICTED LEMNISCATE
THERE ARE BODIES INFINITE
OUTSIDE THIS EARTHLY DOME

Hiding a new home
