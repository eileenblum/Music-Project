An elevated Neohuman saw the World.
Mesmerized, immortalized to inherit Planet Earth to dominate.
A strange Equation planted deep within its Mind.
Cybernaut Signals shiver through the Spine.

Forward, begin the Transformation Phase.
The Self-infused to Non-Protein-Based new Carrier.

Tear down all that may become A Hinder.
Pave the Way for A new Insight.

Time holds A thin Disguise to veil its Flow.
Seeking to conceal the End in Sight.
Deliver the Truth that Seeds of Hope...
...slowly become Seeds of Death.

Through Calculation it was spawned into this World.
Analyzed and Prophesized as the Gateway to Rebirth, eternal Life.
A Revelation of A Monumental Kind.
Modified, you will never have to die.

A Network-Based Meta-Intelligence that will survive...
...independent upon the Environment.

Stare as Constructs of the old Ways wither.
Washed away to the Afterlife.

Time holds A thin Disguise to veil its Flow.
Seeking to conceal the End in Sight.
Deliver the Truth that Seeds of Hope...
...slowly become Seeds of Death.

Accumulation of A rising Fear within, shattering the Noosphere in Descent.
Out of this complex World came but one relentless Creed: Change is bound to the Course of Time.

Bitter Loss to be found, by our Creations phased out.
Watch this Global State advance to be born anew.

Those who favor Death, that's what they will receive.
If they oppose our Dream to merge and become part Machine.

Omnicide: The Space and Time-Bound will never survive.

Course taken as we download certain Minds, aching to become Nano-Tech Gods.
Form chosen, behold Cell-sized Nano-Bots sculpting away Features of Mankind.

Bitter Loss to be found, by our Creations phased out.
As this Global State advance to rebirth.
(At every Night the Sun becomes undone, but with the Darkness gone, again it will merge.)
Bitter Loss to be found, by our Creations phased out.
As this Global State advance to rebirth.

Celebrate as all our past Ways wither, lead the Way to an Age of Light.

Time holds A thin Disguise to veil its Flow.
Seeking to conceal the End in Sight.
Deliverance when the Seeds of Hope...
...never become Seeds of Death.
