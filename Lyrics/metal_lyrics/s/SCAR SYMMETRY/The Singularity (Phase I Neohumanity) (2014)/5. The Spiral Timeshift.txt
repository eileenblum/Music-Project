Inner Revolution, response mechanical thundering Opposition to all new Paradigms.

At first denied! 
At first denied and then opposed with Fervor.
Resist subsequently, accepted as being Self-evident. 

No One can avoid A thing whose Time has come.
Emergence of an Idea tear Worldviews apart.
At first we criticize and then we idolize.
Invasive Technology drawn like Moths to Flame.

Behold the Mighty fall down towards Failure and with the End in Sight they discover.
Somewhere along the Road they have lost their Cause, their Souls... their Souls.
Oh, how the Mighty fall down the Spiral.

Caught in Imitation, our Hearts irrational.
Reign above all, then to dissolve...
...in their Downfall others will take their Place.

At first denied! 
At first denied and then opposed with Fervor.
Resist subsequently, accepted as being true in every Sense.

Behold the Mighty fall down towards Failure and with the End in Sight they discover.
Somewhere along the Road they have lost their Cause, their Souls... their Souls.
Oh, how the Mighty fall down the Spiral.

(Time-shifting Rhyme spirals on and on)
Across this wide Terrain we kill everything, including Ourselves.
(Time-shifting Rhyme spirals on)
Like Moths to the Flame we're drawn, our Wings ablaze in the Midst of our Flight.

Weigh my Heart and see, weight of my Burden.
Humans plagued by programmed Sins through Prayers unanswered.
I will become the Divine.

Embrace Temptation to mutate, recreate my Being. 
My Soul mechanized, ultimate Perfection achieved.

No One can avoid A thing whose Time has come.
Emergence of an Idea tear Worldviews apart.
At first we criticize and then we idolize.
Invasive Technology drawn like Moths to Flame.

Yet all the Mighty fall down towards Failure and with the End in Sight they discover.
Somewhere along the Road they have lost their Cause, their Souls.
Oh, how the Mighty fall down the Spiral.

I choose transformation to mutate, recreate my Being.
Bring modification to erase and replace my Essence now.
