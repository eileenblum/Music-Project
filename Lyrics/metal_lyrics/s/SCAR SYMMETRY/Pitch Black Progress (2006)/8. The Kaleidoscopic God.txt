[Lyrics: H. Ohlsson]

The lifeless worlds come alive
Gathered here both low and high
Show me sights I dreamt at night
I shall return with the dreaming tide

As above, so below
Microcosm is macrocosm
Anything I visualize
Takes place for real

The formless takes the shape I want
I am the decoder of wavelengths
Unobserved it is but nothing
But the potential for everything

As above, so below
Microcosm is macrocosm
Anything I visualize
Takes place for real

Stray into the silence
Stray into my soul
Stray beyond the shallow entombment
Fate - forms a complex kaleidoscope

Planets interact within my head
Universes moved with the will
Anything I imagine occurs
Manifestation is a fact

Stray into the silence
Stray into my soul
Stray beyond the shallow entombment
Fate - forms a complex kaleidoscope

Stray into the silence
Stray into my soul

[Solo: J. Kjellgren]

The outside appears to move
But never really does
The mind is in movement
Unknowing, unaware
Earth appears in my head

Does the rules of manifestation apply
At such a dense place
In such soulless waste

Travel forth light-years away
Beyond the form of night and day
Kaleidoscopic shapes at play
Colours sparkle in every way

[Solos: J. Kjellgren, P. Nilsson, J. Kjellgren, P. Nilsson]

As above, so below
Microcosm is macrocosm
Anything I visualize
Takes place for real

Stray into the silence
Stray into my soul
Stray beyond the shallow entombment
Fate - forms a complex kaleidoscope

Stray into the silence
Stray into my soul
Stray beyond the shallow entombment
Fate - forms a complex kaleidoscope

The outside appears to move
But never really does
Earth appears in my head
Does the rules of manifestation apply?
