[Music: P. Nilsson]
[Lyrics: H. Ohlsson]

I transcend my earthly form
Through some questions never asked before
Question the need to be a machine
That responds automatically

Some words will trigger certain acts
Just one of the commandments we have learnt
Some acts will trigger certain states
I think it's time to alter the game

I'm changing
You're changing
We're changing from within

Deviate from the form of nothing
Deviate from the norm to something
Deviate from the form of nothing
I deviate, farewell to the tribe

I receive clues that lead me
To answers never seen before
And find the final piece
In the puzzle of reality

Some words will trigger certain acts
Belief in limitations we have learnt
Some acts will trigger certain states
I'm taking back what I gave away

I'm changing
You're changing
We're changing from within

Deviate from the form of nothing
Deviate from the norm to something
Deviate from the form of nothing
I deviate, farewell to the tribe

Soul volcano
Now erupting
Lava swallows
What used to be
Soul tsunami
Overflowing
Overriding
Reality

[Solos: P. Nilsson, J. Kjellgren]

Soul volcano
Now erupting
Lava swallows
What used to be
Soul tsunami
Overflowing
Overriding
Reality

Deviate from the form of nothing
Deviate from the norm to something
Deviate from the form of nothing
I deviate, farewell to the tribe
