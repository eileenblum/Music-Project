[Music: J. Kjellgren &amp; C. Alvestam]
[Lyrics: H. Ohlsson]

Behold essence of unearthly
Holographic entity
Shape shifting being within me
Defying the eyes

I emerge from within
Cold-blooded design
Rising terror
Towards mankind

Retaliator
Retaliation's coming
Retaliator
Inter-dimensional

Beyond five sense reality
Reptilian frequency
Temples and shrines that you see here
Were built in my name

I shall bring the end
To all of your kind
Faithful servants
Prepare to be devoured

Retaliator
Retaliation's coming
Retaliator
Inter-dimensional
Prime desecrator
Fall to the new world order
Death generator
Servants and fiends alike

[Solo: P. Nilsson]

Your prevailing reality defines me
As any folklore being

[Solo: J. Kjellgren]

Prime desecrator
Fall to the new world order
Death generator
Servants and fiends alike

Your revelation or your damnation
Either way I bring you death

Prime desecrator
Fall to the new world order
Death generator
Servants and fiends alike
