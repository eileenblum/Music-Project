I am the conscious soul
Supreme awareness
The serpent rising, following the spine

Nothing has really changed
No nothing's really new
Everything is still the same
But I see in different ways

Flesh and spirit
Obscure alliance pass unseen
Soul in zenith
Unharmed it stares into the sun

With death as guiding star
I am transcendence
Within the rising I see the fall

Nothing has really changed
No nothing's really new
Everything is still the same
But I see in different ways

Flesh and spirit
Obscure alliance pass unseen
Soul in zenith
Unharmed it stares into the sun

[Solo]

The empire within swirls and changes
Never stagnant, ever morphing
Aligned with the unseen

Flesh and spirit
Obscure alliance pass unseen
Soul in zenith
Unharmed it stares into the sun
Worlds in hiding
Obscure alliance of the planes
Still abiding
Unbound in every phase
