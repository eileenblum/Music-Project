The path before you
Never coming to a halt
It stretches endlessly
From here into the unknown
Looking back
You barely see through the fog
What you were once, you are no more

Each moment unique
None exactly the same
Defied, denied to live
And exist like this again
Now you will see you are reborn
Arrive, arise to your new world
As this one dies
Forever death will embrace everything

At dusk arrives
The dark night of the soul
Waiting to crush
Every stone left unturned
As you enter
Go at least with this certainty
You will emerge at dawn transformed

Each moment unique
None exactly the same
Defied, denied to live
And exist like this again
Now you will see you are reborn
Arrive, arise to your new world
As this one dies
Forever death will embrace everything

All things end, none survives
Every form must fade away

[Solo]

All things end, changing shape
Waking to life again

[Solo]

Each moment unique
None exactly the same
Defied, denied to live
And exist like this again
Now you will see you are reborn
Arrive, arise to your new world
As this one dies
Forever death will embrace everything
