Through portals of silvery bliss
Exit the flesh, leaving all of this
I travel within, my eyes remain closed
To this body I am but a host
Disconnecting from the body
Behold creation reversed
Internal eyes are opening
The material sphere bursts

Nothing is, nothing becomes
End and beginning unites
Nothing was, nothing will be
Time and space collides
In the eleventh sphere

Awaiting to find it all

I begin an abstract communication
In this eerie civilization
Those who guard these doors
Lie in wait for the aeon of whores
Rejected aspects of our beings
Shunned to this obscure dimension
I am all that I hate
I am everything in this place

Nothing is, nothing becomes
End and beginning unites
Nothing was, nothing will be
Time and space collides
Nothing is, nothing becomes
Nothing was, nothing will be
In the eleventh sphere

Inside this void
A continuum beyond time
Here's no truth, here's no lies
Its darkness brings light
To all those led astray
Now I go, now I leave
Returning to the flesh

[Solo]

Nothing is, nothing becomes
End and beginning unites
Nothing was, nothing will be
Time and space collides
Nothing is, nothing becomes
Nothing was, nothing will be
In the eleventh sphere

Awaiting to find it all
