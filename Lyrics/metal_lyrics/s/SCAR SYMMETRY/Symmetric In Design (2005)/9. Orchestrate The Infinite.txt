Affecting all of universe with my mind
Through my will
Solar systems live and die
Omnipotence in a world of limits
Omniscient, stars will fall
On my command

But those who live within this world
Find ways to label me
Godhood or devilry

Collision as a spark of me entered flesh
Still I keep the ability to form
Until the day I leave my cage
I design this world in my image

What I create I can destroy
Stars fall on my command
Tomorrow's in my hand

I'm the grand orchestrator
In finite form and the infinite design
Beyond wings and horns I am
In wordless thought
Orchestrate the infinite

With focus on the things
Certain to face death
My essence will elude you 'til you die
Omnipotence has no beginning
Omniscience has no end
It can't be grasped

But those who live within this world
Find ways to label me
Godhood or devilry

I'm the grand orchestrator
In finite form and the infinite design
Beyond wings and horns I am
In wordless thought
Orchestrate the infinite
No horns and no crown of thorns
Will fit on me

On a field where the judgment
And all the pain you feel
Can no longer reach you
In the silence existing
Between your every thoughts
That is where I'll meet you

But those who live within this world
Find ways to label me
Godhood or devilry

I'm the grand orchestrator
In finite form and the infinite design
Beyond wings and horns I am
In wordless thought
Orchestrate the infinite
No horns and no crown of thorns
Will fit on me
