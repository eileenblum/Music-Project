The scars form a pattern
Symmetric in design
For each and every conflict
A mark you will find
Wounds have opened bleeding
From the magic of your words
But now this phase is over
I'm done with all this hurt

I shall walk alone

I will hide, keep the pain inside
I shall not return
To the outside world again
I will leave, crawl into the depths
Facing this world no more

The scars upon my body
A testament of abuse
Withdrawn into my dominion
Another life I choose
Inside my realm of comfort
I feed upon the pain
I drink the liquid cancer
That keeps the mind insane

I shall walk alone

I will hide, keep the pain inside
I shall not return
To the outside world again
I will leave, crawl into the depths
Facing this world no more

That phase is through, it's over now
No one can reach my dominion
Inside my mind I make the rules
Abandon sanity and discover truth

[Solo]

I will hide, keep the pain inside
I shall not return
To the outside world again
I will leave, crawl into the depths
Facing this world no more
