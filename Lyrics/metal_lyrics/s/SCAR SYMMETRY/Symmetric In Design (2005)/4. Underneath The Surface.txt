Judging by the outside
No one sees the inner plague
Managing to spread your infestation
Through what you do and say

Underneath your surface
Hides another face
Underneath that false smile
Contempt lies buried

Close your eyes
And enter another state of mind
An internal center awaits inside
Murder your desire by escaping time
In the dying embers, resurrect the fire

Every word you utter, calculated hate
From within you're withering
In your own contempt
Judging by the outside
No one sees the inner plague
Managing to spread your infestation
Through what you do and say

Close your eyes
And enter another state of mind
An internal center awaits inside
Murder your desire by escaping time
In the dying embers, resurrect the fire

[Solo]

Close your eyes
And enter another state of mind
An internal center awaits inside
Murder your desire by escaping time
In the dying embers, resurrect the fire
