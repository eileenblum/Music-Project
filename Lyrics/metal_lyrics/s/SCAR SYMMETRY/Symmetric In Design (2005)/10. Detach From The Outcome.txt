The drug is in, invades within
The third eye is opening
Dimethyltryptamine and harmine
Natural secretions of the mind

Ingestion, convulsion
Enlightenment, bliss

Awake I dream this joyous scene
Immersed in the sacred plant
It speaks the word I haven't heard
Since before my birth

Everything comes alive
I hear the voice of the stars
You must detach from the outcome
I hear the voice of the earth

I reflect, just imitate
The one inside the mirror
A gentle touch, then a rush
When I step inside the glass

Colliding, dissolving
Remembering, bliss

Everything comes alive
I hear the voice of the stars
You must detach from the outcome
I hear a voice everywhere

[Solo]

Colliding, dissolving
Enlightenment, bliss

I hear the voice of the sun
I hear the voice of the stars
I hear the voice of the earth
I hear a voice everywhere
