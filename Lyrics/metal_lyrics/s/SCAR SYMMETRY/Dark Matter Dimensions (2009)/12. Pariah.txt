[Bonus track]

Here's the invasive tide preparing to unfold
Spawn of a cosmic serenade designed to phase out
Insights filtered down, introducing new inventions
Found where it can't be found, restrictions are gone

A fragment that the silence shed
It spoke of life in all things dead

Caught behind the mundane world, a pariah introduced
From inside it realigns space and time

Forced out of space and time, this essence put on hold
Behind man's mental barricades it starts to break out
And the night will drown in the light of new intentions
Sent to the burial ground, restrictions are gone

A fragment that the silence shed
It spoke of life in all things dead

Caught behind the mundane world, a pariah introduced
From inside it realigns space and time

Some will chase horizons endlessly
Aim to catch their shadows
Yet to reach all horizons in there escape
Means to succumb internally

One by one the visions descend
One by one, means to an end

Viewed as a senseless rhyme to energize the soul
Wielding illuminating blades within and without
Insights filtered down, introducing new inventions
Found where it can't be found, restrictions are gone

A fragment that the silence shed
It spoke of life in all things dead

Caught behind the mundane world, a pariah introduced
From inside it realigns space and time
A pariah to the world will divide the false from truth
From inside it realigns space and time
