Inexplicably altered continuum, strange activity
Magnetic fields of fractured aeons fall exponentially

All life modified

Unseen light from deep within it's felt
Come undone or prosper, time will tell

Undone, now see the light hail from a different sun
Waveforms increase as to light up the mind

Now begin to cave in, the stellar movement of the stars
Caving in to begin this fate affecting human life

Insight comes alive

Deep inside the mind and heart it's held
Unbegun we face a rising plague

Undone, now see the light hail from a different sun
Waveforms increase as to light up the mind

Now begin to cave in, the stellar movement of the stars
Caving in to begin this fate affecting human life
Radiating light
The polar shift is here
Radiant strain arise
To matter, space and time

Come undone, will it all be gone
Something rose from the undertow
2012, now we all see what it holds
A void allowing a world to seep through

Undone, now see the light hail from a different sun
Waveforms increase as to light up the mind

Now begin to cave in, the stellar movement of the stars
Caving in to begin this fate affecting human life
Radiating light
From which there's no escape
Radiant strain arise
Illuminate the mind
