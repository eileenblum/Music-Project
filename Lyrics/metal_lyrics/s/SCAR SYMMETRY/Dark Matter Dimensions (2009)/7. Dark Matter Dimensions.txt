Curves of rotation explained
Moving spiral galaxies
Detection through the caused reactions
Indirectly found

Find deep within an unseen soul
Unveil its confined rays
Hiding beneath material spheres
Revealed by new cosmology these ghost-like ways

Visible matter restrained
Holding clusters of galaxies
Dimensions far beyond our senses
Massive worlds obscured

Find deep within an unseen soul
Unveil its confined rays
Hiding beneath material spheres
Revealed by new cosmology these ghost-like ways

A venture into untraceable zones
Dark energy, along with spirit part of components unknown
Realities of relativity

And now the seeds for growth are sown, reaching for days to come
See this brand new world rise from the ground
As the need for knowledge flows through the catharsis of thought
Ask a question and the answer will be born

Multi-dimensions contained
In dark matter and dark energy
Dimensions kept in separation
Creation rests assured

Find deep within an unseen soul
Unveil its confined rays
Hiding beneath material spheres
Revealed by new cosmology these ghost-like ways

A venture into untraceable zones
Dark energy, along with spirit part of components unknown
Realities of relativity
