Sent to leave the Sun for Mercury
Venus is traced through the light
Leading this grand ascendancy
Through the spheres, infused with potency
Instincts will show the direction
Sealed in such vast supremacy

Uncaring, non-fearing
Entering a world of flesh and bone

Go face the fears of the unknown
Into the ascension chamber
Go, animate the flesh and bones
Life instantaneous

I awake, wrapped in mortality
Senses of fear and delight
Sealing the gate of ecstasy

Uncaring, non-fearing
Entering a world of flesh and bone

Go face the fears of the unknown
Into the ascension chamber
Go, animate the flesh and bones
Life instantaneous

Seal the gate of ascendancy
Linear count unfolds my fate

Linear time duration
Counts towards the end
Lifetimes smothered by death
Fear of the vast unknown

Sent to leave the Sun for Mercury
Venus is traced through the light
Leading this grand ascendancy
Through the spheres, infused with potency
Instincts will show the direction
Sealed in such vast supremacy

Uncaring, non-fearing
Entering a world of flesh and bone

Go face the fears of the unknown
Into the ascension chamber
Go, animate the flesh and bones
Life instantaneous
Go face the fears of the unknown
Into the ascension chamber
Go, animate the flesh and bones
Life instantaneous
