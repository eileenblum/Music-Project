Formative age, pulse of the primal rhythm
Raw state of ambient truth
Physical fate caught by a ravenous need
Duality on the earth-plane

Plans made in the minds shadow
Celestial life to be shut down
Intent of anti-cosmic nature seeks to pave its way

Paving the way
Seek to claim

Deep inside the human heart,
Aspects of ourselves are shunned
To become the mental scavengers
So the process starts,
Come rejoice in fallen stars,
Aim to tear the world apart
Drain the consciousness of humanity
Mankind astray, lured to the mental chasm
Soul bait, resisted by few
Cynical state, sprung from the oblivious seed
Infinity-halted, restrained

Paving the way
Seek to claim
Summoned by solemn oaths

Once again changes feed the progress of the world

Deep inside the human heart,
Aspects of ourselves are shunned
To become the mental scavengers
So the process starts,
Come rejoice in fallen stars,
Aim to tear the world apart
Drain the consciousness of humanity

All of the world is our prey to slay
The conceptual barriers of our minds
All of the world must obey and hail
Opposition in thought is denied

Once again changes feed the progress of the world

Deep inside the human heart,
Aspects of ourselves are shunned
To become the mental scavengers
So the process starts,
Come rejoice in fallen stars,
Aim to tear the world apart
Drain the consciousness of humanity

All of the world is our prey to slay
The conceptual barriers of our minds
All of the world must obey and hail
Opposition in thought is denied
