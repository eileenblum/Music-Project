We're formed to read events, apply certain ways
Our visions buried to the light of day
What if the clues we lost are here and can be found
We'll soon find out they're just one thought away

(Birth) Born unaware we view the sun as one with the earth
(Of Form) Forms entwined, a single entity

Justification of disrespectful means
For an outcome will affect and restrain the original dream

Take a look at the trail behind you, this is terrain you know
It might reappear again
Now you stare at the path before you, so tell me what is shown
Decipher eternity

(Rise) Right from the start we are obliged to solve and decode
(It morphs) Creation's labyrinth, it morphs eternally

Justification of disrespectful means
For an outcome will affect and restrain the original dream

Take a look at the trail behind you, this is terrain you know
It might reappear again
Now you stare at the path before you, so tell me what is shown
Decipher eternity

And the terrain shall reappear, repeat the test
Viewed as a problem or challenge, determines what's to come

We're formed to read events, apply certain ways
We'll soon find out they're just one thought away

Justification of disrespectful means
For an outcome will affect and restrain the original dream

Take a look at the trail behind you, this is terrain you know
It might reappear again
Now you stare at the path before you, so tell me what is shown
Decipher eternity
