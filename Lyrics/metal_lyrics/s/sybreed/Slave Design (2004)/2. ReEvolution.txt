The machine has failed to victimized, to broke us on our knees
And no longer we hear their poisoned words of fear
Corporate rape is ending now, we leave our chains and rise
We fuck the system

Liberation revive our freedom
Re-evolution is near, the time has come for us

Masses on march, we want to retake our destiny
To break the government lies
We stand the fire of oppression and move unchained

The system collapse below the pressure of insurgence
Anger solidified by the years will lead our steps

No more submission for our mind
No more constrain and rights denied
We clear our future now

Liberation revive our freedom
Re-evolution is near, the time has come for us
