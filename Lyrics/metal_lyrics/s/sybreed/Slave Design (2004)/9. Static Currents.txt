Walking among idiot people, I can feel their inanity like a spasm
Running into my head
I'm on my way, opposed to your common sense
I don't give a fuck about your hollow words

I turn my back, to all your lies, to the fuckin' strain
Breakin'this shape of scorn

So get away stupid asshole, I won't follow you in cold static currents

In reverse of usual trend, I kick your ass and standing proud
Hey man, I don't care about what I'm supposed to be
I'm on my way, opposed to your common sense
I don't give a fuck about your hollow words

I turn my back, to all your lies, to the fuckin' strain
Breakin'the shape of scorn

So get away stupid asshole, I won't follow you in cold static currents

Don't hesitate to ignore me, I don't need your fuckin'lie
Don't need control, I just need to find my path, to stay awake
So I'll never go back, I will keep straight on track

I'm tired of your vanity, tired of waiting for a sign
So you can stay rotting here
I don't give shit of your rules
Prepare yourself, I'm coming now
