Discard the strain of mortality, reset and display anger sequences
Improve your connectivities, conceived in reverse of your neural patterns of hate

A mass of coalescent material, your mind is weapon to control
Your eyes now see the flesh in pure design
So pull the trigger of dissidence, and focuse your soul
Cryogenic fluids to irrigate your skin

[Repeat first verse]

Delete the pain, divide your mind
Clench your teeth and stand, overload
Don't need to except, don't need to know
The ride will end in fuckin'blood

A violent wave expanding directionless, you crush the structure
Charged to the maximum capacity

[Repeat fisrt verse]

So pull the trigger of dissidence, and focuse your soul
Cryogenic fluids to irrigate your skin
Don't need to except, don't need to know
The ride will end in fuckin'blood

No time to moralize, no time criticize, just time to fight and win... or die
