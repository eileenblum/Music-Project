Circonstances seem so fool: it's what I think about
As the morning come on a new fuckin' day
Exactly the same as the day before
The day before you leave the place
To go thousand miles away from me

I fall so down, in a pool of memories
Drowned deep into my regrets and suffering

[Chorus:]
Tell me why I have to stay alone to face this fuckin' pain
I guess you've tried, but nothing replace the emptiness
Now you're gone, there's only tears that now remain into my heart
I will exchange my soul just to see you one more time

And I can see the gun, shinning so bright
I can feel the hole
The shadows covering your eyes as your body die
The blood sheded on the floor, and this vision makes me sick
I couldn't excepted this will end in tears

I fall so down, in a pool of memories
Drowned deep into my regrets and suffering

[Chorus]

I am to condamned to realize, to stand alone with my weakness and fears
Reality fall to pieces, my mind is bleeding, I've lost the will to live now

Why?... god... destruction... salvation... destruction

I am to condamned to realize, to stand alone with my weakness and fears
Reality fall to pieces, my mind is bleeding, I've lost the will to live

[Chorus]
