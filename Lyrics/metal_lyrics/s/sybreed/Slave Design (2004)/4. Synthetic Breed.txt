Born into a sea of megabits, we now define a datatronic
Symbiosis for the new times to come: new, perfect machines
Of pain, next step to human slavery, plasticity and effective control
For laborious mass who turn the screw, obediente

We are here to light the way, the ministry of your decay
Disrupting all compromise, you will follow the line

We are the seed of neural damage, deficient technology

Tool of cynism and cruelty, a disease to inflict you severe injuries
We are made to constrain, to regulate current entries, to distorded
Perception of reality, so we delete the useless norm and recomposed the truth
To preserve your inept piece of mind

We are here to light the way, the ministry of your decay
Disrupting all compromise, you will follow the line

A pure halo of cold lies, we are breeding inside your mind
As puppet's strings, we govern, immune and deaf to morality
A surge to cure dissidence, we bring patterns of salvation
Recreate the truth, immoralized: a strong pressure of authority

Connected to all, re-wired to every brain facilities
The strain of security will lead your steps into this world
