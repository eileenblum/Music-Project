We're drown in pure suffering
Collapsing into decay
All things now turn to ashes and dust
We 're falling down

We desappear now, our existence will end, so vain
This is the last second we share, we 're burning... fast

Our tears are solidified
In the breath of vanity
We've lost all chance to exit,
We have no place to hide

We desappear now, our existence will end, so vain
This is the last second we share, we 're burning...

There's no more love, there's no more pain, no more reason to remain
The flames will clear all delusion here, confused, we watch the world's demise
There's no more love, there's no more pain, no more reason to remain
The flames will clear all delusion here...

The sky is turning
To cold obsidian light
The flashligth of destruction has rised
To burst our eyes

We desappear now, our existence will end, so vain
This is the last second we share, we 're burning...

There's no more love, there's no more pain, no more reason to remain
The flames will clear all delusion here, confused, we watch the world's demise
There's no more love, there's no more pain, no more reason to remain
The flames will clear all delusion here, next day will never come

We'll never see the future
We succumb, our hollow lives
Turn to negative scan of flesh, distorded

There's no more love, there's no more pain, no more reason to remain
The flames will clear all delusion here, confused, we watch the world's demise
There's no more love, there's no more pain, no more reason to remain
The flames will clear all delusion here, next day will never come
