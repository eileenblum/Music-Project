I speak the tongue of god in nine cold millimeters
Systematic and blind, I'm the relentless nerve of war
That bring the truth of pain and lead everyone to brand new devasted times

I draw the ruins of future: dislocated bodies, face down, praying their lord
Of randomized insanity
Consummed in gazoline, they build the church of their own demise

Humanity will fall on his knees
Follow the savior, see the flesh divine
I'm am the new messiah: a christic pose to clear the way

I taste the blood, the sordid smell of human filth
And emerge from the desert of reality

Rotating gears to dominate, ressurected now for judgement day, to purge your sin

Burn! Innocence is lost, all faith is gone
And now you deserve to extinct
Nailed to the cross, you're punished for your lies

I draw the ruins of future: dislocated bodies, face down, praying their lord
Of randomized inanity
Consummed in gazoline, they build the curch of their own demise

Repent!
