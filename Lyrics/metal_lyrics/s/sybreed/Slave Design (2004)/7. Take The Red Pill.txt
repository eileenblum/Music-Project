Reality is a game you cannot win, so you feel betrayed, so fool again
Nothing is real, nothing is true, and the way seems to be so hard
And long, so long
Do you hear this pulse, machinery running through your veins, into your mind
Right here, right now, see the scorn behind your perfect slave design

Take the red pill, feel the blast flowing in your mouth
Fatalistic comatose, necrosis is feeding the patterns of lies x2

All is connected, the world is a shape to hide the truth from your eyes
Privacy denied, regulated thought, can you accept control of all?
Now visualize: you are a sparkle of life, desentized
You have to break the walls that encaged your soul so deep inside

Take the red pill, feel the blast flowing in your mouth
Fatalistic comatose, necrosis is feeding the patterns of lies

A dysfonction to curve your perception
Blindfolded mind now open wide
A detonating charge of disbelief
Don't trust anyone, don't fear to decide

Take the red pill, feel the blast flowing in your mouth
Fatalistic comatose, necrosis is feeding the patterns of lies x2

.... lies!
