I used to struggle to change it all
To get rid of my misery
I used to believe it should be easy
To end all suffering

It always looks the same:
A ghastly place for pigs and mundane depravity
We support blasphemy and bless hypocrisy
To finally vote for destruction

Empires keep on falling
No one can stop
The earth to keep on turning by the way
No need to try to fight it
Just wait and see
The virtuous liars won't forever win

I ran full circle then realized
It was much better to take a seat
And watch this gruesome tragedy
With all its torment freaks

It always looks the same:
A ghastly place for pigs and mundane depravity
We support blasphemy and bless hypocrisy
To finally vote for destruction

Empires keep on falling
No one can stop
The earth to keep on turning by the way
No need to try to fight it
Just wait and see
The virtuous liars won't forever win

No matter our will-power or might
We have no mean to define the very course of fate
It's nothing but delusion:
No one can change what lies inside
No one can purge
The wrong side of mankind

We support blasphemy and bless hypocrisy
To finally vote for destruction

Empires keep on falling
No one can stop
The earth to keep on turning by the way
No need to try to fight it
Just wait and see
The virtuous liars are destined to die as well
Here lies the fairness of this life
