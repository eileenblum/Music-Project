[Japanese edition bonus track]

Your skin is such a perfect lie
I never get enough
Of your sweet, deceptive delight
It burns me like a wound

I know you re never truly here
No matter what I see
Your voice is nothing but a dirge
Celebrating downfall and sin

Stunned and cold, whether I hate or adore
Your glorious body, I can t escape from lust and vanity
Crimson doll delivering plastic love
Giving mercy killing
Please consume me with your kiss
Don t set me free

You re like a frozen shade of black
I couldn't tear apart
Helpless, I want to ruin you
To penetrate you deep inside

[Repeat second verse and chorus]

Sometimes I try to break loose from you
To slip out of your grasp
But pure devotion to flesh and pain
Is a lasting poison

I know I cannot run away from you
I keep drowning inside your eyes
I hope I ll never find a way to cure
My jaded heart from your scarlet smile

Your fragrance is all but innocent
I can t defy your cruel yet erotic touch

[Repeat chorus]
