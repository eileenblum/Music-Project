I want to crush this world
Drenched in blood I'll rejoice
I'm prone to destroy all what is standing in my way
For I could confront the Creator itself

I'm not here to give in charity
When hate is such a delicacy
I can't help thinking with a grin
Of your spine smashed under my feet

Why on earth should I restrain my inborn violence?
When I see them all looking for absurd excuses
To murder and slay, longing for senseless massacres
I won't try to hide such a radiant foolishness

I want to crush this world
Drenched in blood I'll rejoice
I'm prone to destroy all what is standing in my way
For I could confront the Creator itself

Why should I engage in this masquerade?
I don't wish to fuck around
And accept to face the worst of myself
Yes, I am Ultraviolence
