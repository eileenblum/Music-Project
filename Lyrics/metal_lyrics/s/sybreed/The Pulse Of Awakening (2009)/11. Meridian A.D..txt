We believe to be eternal until we face the point of no return
All state of grace is transient
All shall die and turn to ashes and dust
Desacralized, desensitized
We chasing the light just wishing to live a little more
It's like a hole inside our chest
A clear cut bleeding, always open wide

To reach the apex of life is to walk in a vale of tears
Heavens still remain out of sight wherever we watch
To reach the apex of life is to walk in a vale of tears
We shine to finally dissolve in oblivion and be absolved through death

We've looked for strength through joy
Deprivation is all what we get
We've kept on trying to reach the stars
And deny mortality

We rise to better fall, condemned to rust and crumble for centuries
To behold the leftovers of our dreams now turn to smoking ruins

We ride the whirlwind of doom
A gigantic storm
Of cataclysmic and catastrophic proportions

It's like a hole inside our chest
A clear cut bleeding, always open wide

To reach the apex of life is to walk in a vale of tears
Heavens still remain out of sight wherever we watch
To reach the apex of life is to walk in a vale of tears
We shine to finally dissolve in oblivion and be absolved through death

Death
