All what you stand for
This secure fortress of faithful convictions
Inspire me to disbelief
So full of yourself, you stare at me and say:

"Hey you killjoy, go away
Spare me your objections
Stop playing devil's advocate
Please leave me in peace now, for heavens sake
Hey you killjoy, go away
Spare me your objections
Stop playing devil's advocate
Please leave me in peace now, for heavens sake"

You know what's right or wrong
Jumping to conclusions, so likely to condemn
And take a single wise word for eternal truth
That's why you'll always say:

"Hey you killjoy, go away
Spare me your objections
Stop playing devil's advocate
Please leave me in peace now, for heavens sake
Hey you killjoy, go away
Spare me your objections
Stop playing devil's advocate
Please leave me in peace now, for heavens sake"

I just look for something you'll never grasp
A world neither black nor white, a wider definition
For nothing is downright pure or completely dark
Like myriads of variations for every shade of grey

Once I question your dual pattern
You can but whisper,
"Don't challenge me because I am the righteous one"
And try to conceal your confusion
You wish I'd walk away
So that your small, manicheist world would always stay the same

Your second-rate creed is such a dismay

"Hey you killjoy, go away
Spare me your objections
Stop playing devil's advocate
Please leave me in peace now, for heavens sake
Hey you killjoy, go away
Spare me your objections
Stop playing devil's advocate
Please leave me in peace now, for heavens sake"
