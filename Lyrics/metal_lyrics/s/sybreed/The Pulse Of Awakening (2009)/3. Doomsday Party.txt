Doomsday party is starting out

Silhouettes flicking in dead lights
Ten thousand degrees Fahrenheit
We burst in solid centigrade
Heat transfer amplified

Kinetic figures all around
Dangerous girls in overdrive
Blood pressure widening our eyes
Ecstatic, polarized

Watch now, the sun i s fading away
And still the skyline is glowing in bright white
Let's drown in such an assembly
Let's yell until it all turn to black
(Doomsday party is starting out)

Testing endurance to defy the low performance
We deny all body failure, aiming high
Our breath intensified

And this is how we realize the tragic prize of wasting time
It doesn't make sense if we die
And we'll know in the end if we truly lived
And this is how we realize the tragic prize of wasting time
It doesn't make sense if we die
And we'll know in the end if we truly lived

We stop all motion for a while and bleed just to feel alive
Like a wave submerging us, we fall and shiver,
The welkin starts to ignite
And we know it won't last forever, it's nothing but a lie
A frail substitute for joy
Still, we want to define the line where life and death unite
Where night and day intertwine

We love and hate on fast forward
The momentum is getting wrong
Adrenaline is gasoline
The taste of dust is getting strong

Watch now, the sun is fa ding away
And still the skyline is glowing in bright white
Let's drown in such an assembly
Let's yell until it all turn to black
(Doomsday party is starting out)

And this is how we realize the tragic prize of wasting time
It doesn't make sense if we die
And we'll know in the end if we truly lived
And this is how we realize the tragic prize of wasting time
It doesn't make sense if we die
And we'll know in the end if we truly live
