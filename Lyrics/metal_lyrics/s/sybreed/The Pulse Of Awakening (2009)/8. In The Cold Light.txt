I just close my eyes, and wait until the very end
To face this dreadful day
Hiding in this room and submerged by the glowing dawn
I can feel but regrets

I wish I could change it all, all the mistakes I've made
But I can't just forget the bitter taste of shame
I wish I were strong enough to deaden all the pain
Yet I can but descend and consume in despair

In the cold light
In the cold light of the day
In the cold light
In the cold light of the day my life is such a letdown
In the cold light
In the cold light
In the cold light of the day
