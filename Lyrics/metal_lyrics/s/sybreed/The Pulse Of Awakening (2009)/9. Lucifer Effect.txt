Disillusioned yet fascinated
With bitter cruelty you deny the sanctity of flesh
Urging me to destroy
You say it's not a question of trust, the strongest don't lie
No matter if I have to bleed my own kind, it's all right

Like Lucifer rising from the ashes of grace
The downfall of the sun
My heart is frozen
Like Lucifer rising from the ashes of grace
The downfall of the sun
My wings are burning down

Oh doppelganger, I hear you in my head whispering
"What a joke! Their so-called faith and beliefs are but filth
Give up all tolerance
They loath lust and depravity but ignore their own sins
When zeitgeist extols raw pandemonium
Bring them hell"

Like Lucifer rising from the ashes of grace
The downfall of the sun
My heart is frozen
Like Lucifer rising from the ashes of grace
The downfall of the sun
My wings are burning down

"Prepare yourself to be deceived
By those you entrust your very dreams or darkest fears
To be double crossed"

There is no place for hope in your world
You love to deride my sustained endeavour to find a way
To stand still

Like Lucifer rising from the ashes of grace
The downfall of the sun
My heart is frozen
Like Lucifer rising from the ashes of grace
The downfall of the sun
My wings are burning down
