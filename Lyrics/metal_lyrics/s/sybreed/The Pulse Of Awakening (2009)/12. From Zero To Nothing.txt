Day after day, recurring self-acting gestures
I can but feel this repetition and stand benumbed
I cannot run away
My existence in dissolution
How could I break this steady cycle to rise instead into light again

I have been waiting for the day when I could sort it out
But nothing ever changes
I'm wasting my own life
I am going from zero to nothing
I have been waiting for the day when I could sort it out
But nothing ever changes
I'm wasting my own life
And becoming what I have sworn to never be

When there is no way out
All just become insignificant
I can't breath
I can't sleep
Am I dead
No more faith
No more hopes
No more dreams

I have been waiting for the day when I could sort it out
But nothing ever changes
I'm wasting my own life
I am going from zero to nothing
I have been waiting for the day when I could sort i t out
But nothing ever changes
I'm wasting my own life
And becoming what I have sworn to never be
