There was no light, I couldn't find my very way
A dire frustration was all I could feel in my chest
For there was no joy in every moment I could spend
How could I reckon I trapped myself into a cage of misery?

My so called strength had to be shattered
My beliefs were but a lie
It is so convenient to tint it all in deep tones of black
To live in fear is but meaningless
I shall face the source of my hopelessness
I just crave for suffering

[Chorus:]
I can see for the first time
And feel freed from the pain
Redeemed and disengaged
Oblivion is a just reward,
A final slumber to end the divide
And awaken purified

Why should I try to sustain such a barren state
When my whole condition is tantamount to emptiness?
I wish I could hide from this grim picture in my head
Yet I am locked up inside the maze of endless excruciation

I reach the height of isolation
There's no need to revise or suspend the decision
For I discern but one conclusion
This gruesome existence has become an affliction I can't withstand

My beliefs were but a lie
It is so convenient to tint it all in deep tones of black
To live in fear is but meaningless
I shall face the source of my hopelessness
I just crave for suffering

[Chorus:]
I can see for the first time
And feel freed from the pain
Redeemed and disengaged
Oblivion is a just reward,
A final slumber to end the divide
And awaken purified
