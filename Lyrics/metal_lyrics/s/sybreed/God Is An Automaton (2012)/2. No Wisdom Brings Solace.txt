I've tried to fight pessimism
To look for an explanation to the prime weakness we seem to convey: A strong drive to destroy ourselves
All statements have turned out to conduct to a maze of suspect justifications
Encased between hermetic walls of incertitude

Axioms appear so contrived
And science, the paragon of devious crafts
I struggle to assimilate this fact: No wisdom brings solace

I start to realize the limitations of my attempt to truly understand the misery of men
The more I look inside, the more I'm prone to deride the basis of every creed: To know is to be saved

I'm lost, standing at the crossroads with no mean to decide on a better course
No choice appears convenient, no pathway predominates
Unsure to ever escape my posture of inflexible disbelief
I decide but to abandon this hunt for significance

Axioms appear so contrived
And science, the paragon of devious crafts
I struggle to assimilate this fact: No wisdom brings solace

I start to realize the limitations of my attempt to truly understand the misery of men
The more I look inside, the more I'm prone to deride the basis of every creed: To know is to be

Nothing is true, nothing is eternal, there's no reward for steadfast belief
In a flawed system of assumption but a breakdown of cognition gears
To deprave the core of all knowledge and confer it the arrays of faith
Is to increase the prospect of oversight and absurdity

I start to realize the limitations of my attempt to truly understand the misery of men
The more I look inside, the more I'm prone to deride the basis of every creed: + To know is to be saved
