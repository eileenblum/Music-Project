We we're blind and we couldn't conceive the color of blood
This crimson flood soaking the ground
We stare in shock as the world unveils its true features to us
You then exclaim "where is God now?"

You ask me "why do we forever feed on pain
And act like mindless fiends programmed for boundless rage?
The carnage never cease, the poison is never drained
For this, should we blame the maker of everything divine?"

The virtuous dies as well as the sinful one
Death strikes all life, blind in its random ways

In essence, we contradict the conception of a watchful shaper
And still we consider being observed and closely monitored

Primitive we remain
We were devised to enjoy trials
The choice has never been ours
We are inclined to violence

You ask me "why do we forever feed on pain
And act like mindless fiends programmed for boundless rage?
The carnage never cease, the poison is never drained
For this, should we blame the maker of everything divine?"
You ask me "why do we forever feed on pain (forever feed on pain)
And act like mindless fiends programmed for boundless rage? (Programmed for boundless rage)
The carnage never cease, the poison is never drained (The poison is never drained)
For this, should we blame the maker of everything divine?" (Divine)
