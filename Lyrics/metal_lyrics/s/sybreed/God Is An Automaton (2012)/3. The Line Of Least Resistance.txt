Prevaricator
There is no substance into your soul save pretense and disrespect
Obscene exposure
You trick your peers into sympathy using counterfeit emotions

You believe no one can see through your disguise
Yet you make me want to turn my back on your pathetic treachery

[Chorus:]
Always choosing the easiest path
You seek to prevail with no sacrifice
Ready to walk over everyone
You reek of conceit and sickening pride

Pretentious fraudster
You deem yourself worthy of reverence, ever craving to be praised

[Repeat second verse and chorus]

You strive to deny your foolishness through delusions of great achievement
Trying to decrease your misery with blazing lies and random masquerades

[Repeat second verse and chorus]
