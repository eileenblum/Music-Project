All hail your deceit
You, lord of all shattered hopes whispering words of fear

Termination is salvation
None of us is safe within your hands
Redemption with a bullet
You're the prophet of limitless debasement

Here comes the accuser obscuring the sky, intoxicating the soul
The serpent conspiring to engulf the world into the blackest light

Ouroborean seduction of foreknown doom
You are death sovereign

Termination is salvation
None of us is safe within your hands
Redemption with a bullet
You're the prophet of limitless debasement

Here comes the accuser obscuring the sky, intoxicating the soul
The serpent conspiring to engulf the world into the blackest light

We fall for your lies
We embrace nothingness
And decline as we can't stand the weight of our guilt

Children of Despair, perdition is in our flesh
As we run towards fate

Termination is salvation
None of us is safe within your hands
Redemption with a bullet
You're the prophet of limitless debasement

Here comes the accuser obscuring the sky, intoxicating the soul
The serpent conspiring to engulf the world into the blackest light
