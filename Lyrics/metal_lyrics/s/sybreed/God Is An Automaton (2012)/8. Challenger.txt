Face down, this the way you taught me to abide
Down on my knees, I was just another servile bitch
I realized I was a whore begging for security
And such a coward, Iâd never have asked to be set free

Please tell me why should I disregard all the lies and become everything I despise
If I can't find a meaning to this fearful life, i'll become the enemy of mankind

What did you conjecture to arise from the ashes of my broken self?
An obedient drone just easy to bind?
Iâm but the demon youâve devised

Tremble, you bastards, I represent all that you dread
Itâs so futile to think you can still control me
Iâve nothing to lose for you have tainted everything I prized
Whatever you try, revenge is mine

[Repeat chorus]

I shall wipe this burden out
Victorious I will stand above the mundane shame youâve forcefully trained me in
Iâll concede nothing and never forget all your deeds and cruelty
Retribution is on the way, turning the war youâve started into pure defeat
