I desecrate, predisposed to always re-engage
I deprecate, charing my words with bitterness and comdemn

I'll never let your insignificance, your substandard ego
Subverting my resolve and dedication
I'll never take on your indecision and have no backbone
I forever choose destruction and bliss

I'm disinclined to ever salute a defeat
To surrender or adopt a desolated stance, I'll prevail

I'll never let your insignificance, your substandard ego
Subverting my resolve and dedication
I'll never take on your indecision and have no backbone
I forever choose destruction and bliss

Why should I submit to your taste for mediocrity when I crave for the most exquisite form of transcendence?
Why should I give up on my needs of brutality when I yearn for an existence freed from all restricting bounds?

I refuse to spend my precious time here trying to abide

I'll never let your insignificance, your substandard ego
Subverting my resolve and dedication
I'll never take on your indecision and have no backbone
I forever choose destruction and bliss
