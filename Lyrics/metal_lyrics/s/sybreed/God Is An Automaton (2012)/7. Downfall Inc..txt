To walk among the human herd
To see the mark of our degeneration
Stagnant and dazed, we but relent
To break the strain of our self-enforcing schemes
Now our future is tantamount to past
A dead-end race with a leaning for despise
Immobolism: our final goal
With corrupt bodies free to assume all control 

To confuse truth and judgment
To observe the world with blinded eyes
To coronate intolerance
We only swallow changeless lies

We seem so eager to dissent
Yet through inaction we approve each restraint
We keep on begging "please govern us"
Freedom's abridged, utopia is distrust

To confuse truth and judgment
To observe the world with blinded eyes
To coronate intolerance
We only swallow changeless lies

We are condemned to fail and to ruin our very lives
To endure through denial
We could let the world burn and watch each other die
Consternation made us unconcerned
With enforced discipline we but forfeit our very pride
We require low sustenance: to be kept entertained, to feel secure and feed
Deprivation is our single fear

To confuse truth and judgment
To observe the world with blinded eyes
To coronate intolerance
We only swallow changeless lies

How can we feel betrayed when we yield in front of any sign of change?
We keep on running away
We are far too scared to ever become self-contained
