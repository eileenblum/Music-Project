We're confined behind invisible barricades
A glyphic shroud of glorified lies

Kali Yuga
And we slowly turn into cowards
The excess of truth isolates us

Forsaken, dismayed
We were told to mask the void inside our disabled hearts in subtle ways
Substitute faceless
We're dissolved into a sea of gray, constrained to settle for decay

Evolving careless on treacherous heights
We weaver between detachment and fear

Kali Yuga
And we slowly turn into cowards
The excess of truth isolates us

Invalid notions dominate our will and judgment
We now become the waste of this world

Forsaken, dismayed
We were told to mask the void inside our disabled hearts in subtle ways
Substitute faceless
We're dissolved into a sea of gray, constrained to settle for decay

"Surrender to the cold obliteration of your ego"
Constantly forced to seclusion, we are bound with cruel precision

Kali Yuga
And we slowly turn into cowards
The excess of truth isolates us

Forsaken, dismayed
We were told to mask the void inside our disabled hearts in subtle ways
Substitute faceless
We're dissolved into a sea of gray, constrained to settle for decay
