Mutilate me, hurt me now
You've cut your wings to justify my guiltiness
We're all slave of some sadistic obsession
You put this needle in my head, a needle called "pain"

Let me hate you, I'll never save you from yourself
Hold me, destroy me, tomorrow will never be the same

You reveal the worst:
My inclination to forgive every sin
I 'm enabled to avoiding stare at your halo of desperation

Malevolent love, it's all you are
There's no redemption in your humiliating smile
You drain the life outside, your grace is a lie
You put your seal in my flesh so deep within

Let me hate you, I'll never save you from yourself
Hold me, destroy me, tomorrow will never be the same
Let me hate you, I'll never save you from yourself
Break me, constrain me, like an angel falling on burning grounds

There's no rest in your lethal embrace
Surrounded by your disdain
There's nothing more I can hope from you
In this hell on earth, I've already sold my soul

Let me end this dead-end game

You've corrupted me step by step
Like a worm, you're devouring me to the core
I wish to die in your deadly arms,
Exquisite devil in disguise
