I separate darkness and light, reorganise primordial chaos at will
Reconstructing galaxies pulsing to the rhythm of my thought
I gather the collision course of thousand exploding stars
Those soon collapse on themselves into a massive discharge of cosmic pulse

[Chorus:]
I'm gazing trough the universe
Constraining waves of light
I touch the core of stellar mass
And I am now reborn
I contemplate the face of god
Reflecting my own soul
I'm standing in orbital phase and become eternal
Inertial I'm floating now, compressing gravity
I'm moving in the perfect sphere of the creation divine

Like a supernova waiting for the final implosion
Coalescent and irradiate, I can see the spectrum of reality
I reactivate atomic movement and collect photons into my hands
Bursting like millions of suns to illuminate my path for centuries

I melt my flesh with all matter
I melt my mind with all mankind

[Chorus]

...eternal!
