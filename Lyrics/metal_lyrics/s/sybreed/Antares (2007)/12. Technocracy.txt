[Japanese bonus track]

How can we live this slow demise?
How can we live and deny it?
Ecstatic lies explode our minds
The age of technocracy

Relentless rules improved to increased control
Brutal enforcement to break disorder
They bring the string of full security
A world of disabused norms

How can we live this slow demise?
How can we live and deny it?
Ecstatic lies explode our minds
The age of technocracy

Were docile dogs, obedient
Apathy growing, serialized
A concrete tool for slavery
Collapsing in psychosis, they're spreading genocide
Perfect unit of mass-corruption
There's no way to protest, there's no way to escape

Regulated delusion as logical solution

How can we live this slow demise?
How can we live and deny it?
Ecstatic lies explode our minds
The age of technocracy

We are standing so blind, just watching the ground so afraid
Disconnected inside we're bleeding the poison of distress
Love is lost forever, could we shine again?
Pain is breeding together, together we remain defenseless
Fears keep us so hollow, could we find a way?
We wish to break the walls we built around ourselves

We're falling down
We're falling down
We're falling down again
We're falling down
We're falling down
We're falling far from grace again
again
