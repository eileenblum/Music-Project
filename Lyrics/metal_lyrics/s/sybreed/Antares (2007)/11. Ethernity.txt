This cold morning is like a consecration
A procession of souls that will never end
The time of remembrance and disillusions
Shall dry the liquid pain running in my veins

[Chorus:]
Drain my blood and drown me in the sun,
forever cured and sanctified
Now reborn, we cross the Rubicon,
Eternity will blend our minds in one

I close my eyes and shiver in resurrection
Standing on this ground of awakening
I float into the light of revelation
"Expire, and thus revive in the purest form"

[Chorus]

I watch the sky and prey for my deliverance
An endless whisper to find redemption
To breath the fire of all creation, divine, purified

"Ad Aeternam... Gloria"
