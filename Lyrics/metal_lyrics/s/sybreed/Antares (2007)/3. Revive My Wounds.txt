I don't need your scornful reply, I'm sick of your constant denial
Don't want to face your immorality
Irritated by your selfish smile, I cannot stand your bitter hate
Your presence is a pain

[Pre-chorus:]
Hurt
my soul with all your fucking lies

[Chorus]
I'm searching for redemption
I wish I could find an answer
Words are perfect deceivers
They revive my wounds forever

A black star moving around a pole of raw negativity
Like void never fulfilled
The wage of sins is to fall
In self-destructive schemes

I feel so numb, I feel so cold, your vain, delusive heresy
Makes me nonexistent and dead inside
I would rather disappear, or shed my blood onto the ground
Than having to face your sheer vanity

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

I taste my anger, reacting to preserve my mind
I left your twisted, pervert world behind
Control is over, no more tainted promises
My eyes are open wide

[Chorus]
