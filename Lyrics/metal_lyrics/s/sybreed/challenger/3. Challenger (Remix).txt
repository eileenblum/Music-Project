[feat. Voician]A meaning to this fearf...
To this fearf...
To this fearful life

Iâll concede nothing

[Chorus:]
Explain me why
Should disregard all the lies
And become everything I despise
If I can't find
A meaning to this fearf...
To this fearf...
To this fearful life

This the way you taught me to abide
I was just another servile bitch
I realized I was a whore
And such a coward

I shall wipe this burden out
Victorious I will stand
Above the mundane shame
You've forcefully trained me in
I'll concede nothing
And never forget all your deeds and cruelty

[Chorus:]
Explain my why should I disregard all the lies
And become everything I despise
If I can't find
A meaning to this fearf...

What did you conjecture to arise
From the ashes of my broken self?
An obedient drone just easy to bind?
I'm but the demon you've devised
And such a coward

I shall wipe this burden out
Victorious I will stand
Above the mundane shame
You've forcefully trained me in
I'll concede nothing
And never forget all your deeds and cruelty

[Chorus:]
Explain my why should I disregard all the lies
And become everything I despise
If I can't find...
A meaning to this fearf...

[Chorus:]
Explain my why should I disregard all the lies
And become everything I despise
If I can't find
A meaning to this fearf...
