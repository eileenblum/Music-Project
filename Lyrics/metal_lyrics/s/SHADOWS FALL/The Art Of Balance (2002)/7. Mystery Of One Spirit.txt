Inspiration is the light of the mind
Revelation the meaning behind
Clouds of sacred incense allow us to rise
Cast away all our earthly ties

Without a veil of tears

Journey Of the Magi Cascading

Fulfillment of our mind your cowardice

Is fuel for this deception your vanity

destruction of your soul

Cannot defend lies without end
I'll smash you trend living to be free

Cannot defend lies without end
I will pretend NO MORE!

Smashing through the doors of perception

Realization of a world beyond the tangible

Ancestral wisdom.  Timeless Inspiration

The Mystery of one spirit

I create the light I create the darkness
Author alike of prosperity and woe
Their god is but a symptom of their power
Another tool they use to dominate and conquer
