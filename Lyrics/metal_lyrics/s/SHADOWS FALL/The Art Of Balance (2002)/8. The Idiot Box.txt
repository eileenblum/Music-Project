Staring forward with vacant eyes

Imagination Cannot survive

Misinformation and compromise

These televised conditioned lies

Create a system of belief
Heartless purveyors of deceit

Seems clear to me you've never known me
Doubt everything you've never shown me

Images flash by in waves
What to buy and what you'll save
All the products that you never craved
you've become another slave

All the lies that you told
I will not be bought or sold
I won't fit into your mold
I will not be bought or sold
RISE! And break away from the system
RISE! And crush the voices in your head RISE!
I want back what you stole from ME!
