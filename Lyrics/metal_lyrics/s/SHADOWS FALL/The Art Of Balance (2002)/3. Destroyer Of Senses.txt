The sweet taste of self destruction
Insecurity wash away the memories

I keep on falling off
I keep on falling off

The agents of change have dissolved!
Into the fabric of our very existence

I keep on falling off of this straight and narrow line
The calm embrace of a sedated mind

Giver of life
Destroyer of senses
I INVOKE!
I INVOKE!
The sweet taste of self destruction

[x2]
Giver of life
Destroyer of senses
I INVOKE!

The sweet taste of self destruction
Insecurity wash away the memories

[x2]
I keep on falling off of this straight and narrow line
The calm embrace of a sedated mind
