Here I go again
A vicious Cycle without end
Seeking distance for security
A desperate act to remain free
A balance point cannot be found
This whole thing will come crashing down
Down! Down!
My fear will drag you down
Into this world that I create
Your love for me has sealed your fate
Down! Down!
My fear will drag you down
Can I trust in what I feel?
Praying that this time it's real
Feel the strain!
All this times been spent in vain MY SHAME!
open wounds that still remain DECAY!
As my faith is stripped away YOU'LL STRAY!
The final price I have to pay

Digger in deeper still
The hollowness I yearn to fill
The story always ends the same
The cycle soon begins again

Stepping outside the circle!
