A fire burns in Babylon a spark will soon ignite
Burning flame of Jah light a fire that will purify
Wipe away the city's lies reducing fortunes into ash
Tear apart your useless mask
Nowhere left for you to hide
Damned for your foolish pride
Chant down Babylon Chant down Babylon

Revelations time is now
Your world will crumble to the ground
Final judgement now has come this is Armageddon

A eulogy for the modern man enslaved and devoured
By the strength of it's demands
A eulogy for the modern man hide your head and cower
Or be struck down where you stand

To advance in truth and rights
To advance in love and light
The path of righteousness is leading
The songs of I and I are pleading
In the grace pf Mt. Zion
With the strength of a lion
All barriers shall be broken
All heart alight and open
A fire burns in Babylon your world will burn
A fire burns in Babylon you world is burning down
