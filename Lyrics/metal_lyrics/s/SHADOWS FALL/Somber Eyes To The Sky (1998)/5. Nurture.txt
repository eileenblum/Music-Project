With Longing I recall
Yearning for a caress hollow and empty, 
Unsheltered by the pain of the rest
Not without justification, torn down for my compassion
Free formed in emptiness
Have I been cheated? 
Has all I have worked for been stolen away by disregarding what I most Yearned for?
Relinquished all I deserve
Fearing not for suffering, is my home and pain my native tongue?
Loss and rejection are my family
Nurture
You are not the reason for my weakness
Lost I hold you to blame for fearing love
For my failure...accompany disaster and inherit the pain
Torn down for my compassion now I stand alone
Not sympathy just understanding I am shown
Too far gone now, my thoughts are wise
All alone because your taken so far
A graceful end to life
But its not over
Disguised in a full mask of truth
Those old words are denied
With longing I recall 
Yearning for a caress hollow and empty, unsheltered by the pain of the rest
Not without justifcation, torn down for my compassion, free formed in emptiness
Repent what I feel
Mourn disguised..as life's seas are paralyzed.
