Took a walk down my life today
Broken and empty roads are paved with regrets and guilt I have made
Crushing what bits of hope remain
Do you want to believe what I believe?
I don't remember how to eat, sleep or breathe
Trapped inside this state of decay
You can't tell me that I don't want to stay
I know my pain...burn the faces beyond
Kill me long before I wake
Take me to my sleep I wait
Stifle my breath with every scream
I don't know when I lost my dreams
All my hopes, all my desires now extinguished in my wills fire. 
It is gone and I no longer care
Come with me and some hate I'll share
You see no pain in my eyes, that is just my clever disguise
I will not cry to you, 
You will not see the truth
Took a walk down my life today
Broken and empty roads are paved with the regrets and guilt I have made
crushing what bits of hope remain
Do you want to believe what I believe?
I don't remember how to eat sleep or breathe
Trapped inside this state of decay
You can't tell me that I don't want to stay
Suffering...lifeless age....face the pain...life's sweet suffering
