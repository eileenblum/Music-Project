You will never give the power
To the powerless
Your ideal has grown
Far beyond your control

Can you ever find yourself again?
Your vision's distorting
Knowing it will never end
Can't see through your eyes

Can you imagine what is only
One step away?
The potential is waiting
Just beyond your grasp

Can you ever find yourself again?
Your vision's distorting
Knowing it will never end
Can you keep fighting on and on?

This false me will burn
In effigy
This false me will burn
In effigy

It's so easy to relax
And watch from afar
It's so easy to give in
To this complacence

Can you ever find yourself again?
Your vision's distorting
Knowing it will never end
Can't see through your eyes
