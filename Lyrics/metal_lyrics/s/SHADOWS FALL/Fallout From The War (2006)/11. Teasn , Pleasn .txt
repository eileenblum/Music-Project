[originally by Dangerous Toys]Wake up my lover, shaker her off like a stick
Hung over, tired and shaky, head two feet thick
Half past noon I got up out of bed
Ran to the freezer to cool off my head

Now I see the vision, seeing is believing

Teas'n, pleas'n, run for the door
Teas'n, pleas'n, she wants more

Woke up again in a stranger's bed
Heard her honey's voice, I knew I was dead
Lovers under the covers, shakin' in the shock
Blink of my eyes, been stabbed, hung or shot
Any kind of reason, feelin' for the feelin'

Teas'n, pleas'n, run for the door
Teas'n, pleas'n, she wants more
Teas'n, pleas'n, yeah, give the dog a bone
Teas'n, pleas'n, roll over baby, hang up the phone

Gee, Mister, I didn't know she was your wife
Hey, a-let's just shake on it and call it even eh!
Man, I think I got the wrong house

I don't even make my rules
That's why I'm usually the fool
I never even had no school yeah!
Hey sugar! Don't ya think I'm cool!
