Unleashed upon the shores (rain of terror)
The latent power unveiled
A cruel reminder (of our weakness)
Of our vulnerability
We will rebuild
We will rise
We will rebuild
We will survive
Survive
Inner strength will always (never falter)
Overpower your neglect
Turn your back on us (the abandoned)
And we will rise alone
Stranded and forgotten
A blind eye turns away
Another failure for the fool
Submerge the image
The spirit shines through the deepest of waters
