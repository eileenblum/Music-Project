Spit your words with fury
Tear your way beneath the skin
Infecting with doubt
A useless web you spin
What is it you hope to gain from this?
Nothing
What is it you hope to prove with this?
Nothing
Hidden away from view
You start your fires
The child who became king
Of the jackals and the liars
Breaking you fingers
Silence your voice
Breaking your fingers
You've made your choice
Words cannot be weapons
If they leave no mark
Pathetic attack
With no bite and all bark
