[originally by Leeway]Sat down confessed it with a full report 
Dashed it out but he couldn't take it 
Had to drop dime, through a partner in crime 
Got away without serving his time 

Snitches get stiches 
The thread on your cheek must itch 
Snitches get stiches 
You got yours you son of a bitch 

The mark of the squealer 
Too soft to be the dealer 
And nothing can heal you 
Mark of the squealer 
The mark of the squeal 

I'm out on a mission 
To catch a stool pigeon
