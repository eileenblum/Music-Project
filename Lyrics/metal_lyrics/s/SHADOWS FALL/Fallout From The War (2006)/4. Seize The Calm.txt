The shimmer of understanding
Grasping to maintain
The cold touch of chaos
Are you in control?
On the edge, how did it come to this?
As we stare into the abyss
This world will only be
A pleasant lie or bitter truth
Somewhere buried deep within
Is a light that forever shines
On the edge, how did it come to this?
As we stare into the abyss
On the edge, on the precipice
As we stare into the abyss
Seize the calm
It holds more than life
Fading
Falling
Weightless and shameless
