Smashing, always forward
Leave nothing in your path
Shortsighted and indifferent
To what lies ahead
Reckless abandon (chasing your tail)
Blinding ambition (you learn to fail)
Winning a race
No one else began
No rest for the wicked
Winter calls again
Crawling, gagging (chasing your tail)
Battered, bleeding (you learn to fail)
Rip it up and tear it out
It weighs heavy on my soul
Confront the stranger
Staring back at you
Twisted reflection
In the looking glass
Tear it out
How could you let it fall?
The strain of climb leaves you empty
