Choking in the grip of suspicion
Trapped beneath the sword of absolution
Escape is impossible
Indulge yourself in ignorance
Blocking out the sun, turning in the breeze
Hung high above in a noose of sympathy
What has become?
The seeds I've sown
Still haunting me endlessly
Escape is impossible
Indulge yourself in ignorance
What has become?
The seeds I've sown
Still haunting me endlessly
Thy will be done
All I've been shown
Is still haunting me endlessly
Choking in the grip of suspicion
Trapped beneath the sword of absolution
Through the souls of ages
This deceitful elevation
Collapsing into rages
From corrupted meditations
Indulge in the pleasures of the fallen
Give yourself away
