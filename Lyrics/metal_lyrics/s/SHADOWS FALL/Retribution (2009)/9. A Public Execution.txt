The end
Spent my whole life dreaming
Waiting for the end
My end
Gave myself no reason
For the violence in my hands

Fuck the dreams I'm holding onto
Fuck the path that lies ahead
Fuck your ego
Fuck your comfort
Fuck it all until it's dead

Fuck it all [x4]

The time has come
For you to pay
For all you've done
Our public execution
Violence has come
Until this revolution
You will pay with your blood

Feel the failure
It's easy for you to run
Screaming
Staring at the power of the god

Fuck the wings that lie before us
Fuck the bloodbath has began
Fuck excuses
Fuck denial
Fuck it all until it's dead

Fuck it all [x4]

The time has come
For you to pay
For all you've done
Our public execution
Violence has come
Until this revolution
You will pay with your blood

Your time has expired
Destroying your empire
Your time has expired
Destroying your empire

Fuck the wings that lie before us
Fuck the bloodbath has began
Fuck excuses
Fuck denial
Fuck it all until it's dead

Fuck it all [x4]

The time has come
For you to pay
For all you've done
Our public execution
Violence has come
Until this revolution
You will pay with your blood

Your time has expired
Destroying your empire
