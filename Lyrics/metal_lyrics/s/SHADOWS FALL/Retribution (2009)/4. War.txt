Until the philosophy
That holds one
Race superior
And another inferior
Is finally and
Permanently discredited
And abandoned
There will be...

War!
In the east
War in the west
War!
Up north
And in the south
Prepare for war!

Until the color of a man's skin
Is no more significant
Then the color of his eye
There will be war...
There will be war...

War!
In the east
War in the west
War!
Up north
And in the south
Prepare for war!

Prepare for war!
Prepare for war!

And until that day
The world will not know peace
We will fight if necessary
And win this war...
And win this war...

Prepare for war!
