Slave to your seduction
Open myself to sweet destruction
Pray for your affection
Still I welcome this rejection

Tear it down
Into ruins
It comes around
The taste of fear

When I see your face it haunts me
The cold embrace, deceiving
Surrounded by misery

It's become to easy
For someone like you to lie
Always searching
For a better way to say goodbye

It's so hard to listen
The hateful words you've always written
All the lives you taken
All the people you've forsaken

It's become so easy
For someone like you to lie
Always searching
For a better way to say goodbye
The taste of fear
The only thing that gets you high
With no regrets I will let this feeling die
