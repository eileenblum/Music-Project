The blood drips from your nose
With every lie you told
And with all you took from me
You're beggingfor insanity

Thought I died in my sleep last night
It's just wishful thinking
The pain build behind my eyes
So I will just keep on drinking

No wrong or right
Just wasting your life

Fading into sleep
The patterns all repeat
As you hide inside your lies
Inside your lies! My demise!

Something you'll never know
A secret left untold
I'd rather let you down
Then ever let you go!

The darkness never seems to stop
It's constantly creeping
No more light, no more lies
Deeper into hell I'm sinking

No wrong or right
Just wasting your life

Fading into sleep
The patterns all repeat
As you hide inside your lies
Inside your lies! My demise!

As we wash the blood away
Day breaks on another day

Wasting your life
No wrong or right, fading into sleep
