Embrace the end
As we descend
Deeper into the fire

The pain that you feel
The nightmare is reeling you in

Grasping, crawling, clinging to life
Holding on to illusions
Tearing, feeding, tasting the blood
As you savor the killing

Welcome, welcome to the apocalypse
A twisted smile upon the Devil's lips

Strike out the sun
Winter's begun
Bringing the death of desire

Shatter the seal
The horsemen of doom ride again

Grasping, crawling, clinging to life
Holding on to illusions
Tearing, feeding, tasting the blood
As you savor the killing

Welcome, welcome to the apocalypse
A twisted smile upon the Devil's lips

Embracing
Embrace annihilation
Embracing
Embrace annihilation
