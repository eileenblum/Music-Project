The dream inside of me
Is a death inside of you
You're redemption was being diffrent
We last way too late
That your laugh was always fake
It bends until it breaks
Illusions we've forsaken

A vision still remains
Of a world that lost and can't be saved
It's a chance we have to take
Our only chances are the ones we create

Waiting for this day to come
Thought I'd be left for dead
But the light still shines ahead
The whole world has come undone
Though we will carry on
Until your ways are dead and gone

The answers can't be seen
And hatred's all you've had
Living lie for the tangling
See through all the lies
Destroy your last disguise
Defend to survive
Refuse to compromise

Way to replace the pain
And make a stake we're all the same
Escape comprehend leave behind
And follow it till the echo dies

Waiting for this day to come
Thought I'd be left for dead
But the light still shines ahead
The whole world has come undone
Though we will carry on
Until your ways are dead and gone

The dream inside of me
Is a death inside of you
You're redemption was being diffrent
We last way too late
That your laugh was always fake
It bends until it breaks
And mends you dream forsaken

A vision still remains
Of a world that lost and can't be saved
Escape comprehend leave behind
And follow it till the echo dies

Waiting for this day to come
Thought I'd be left for dead
But the light still shines ahead
The whole world has come undone
Though we will carry on
Until your ways are dead and gone
