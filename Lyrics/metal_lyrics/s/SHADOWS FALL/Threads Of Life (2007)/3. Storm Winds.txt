Fighting to control my mind. But tragedy is all I find!
The panic builds up from deep within the subconscious mind.
Always thought that the pain would end with the passage of time.
No matter how many layers deep you try to hide yourself.
They will crack and peal away to reveal something else.
From the past we must break free. Come to terms with all that tortures me.
Tragic memories invade. Let the storm winds wash them all away.
I will be the only one who is left to decide.
There will be no more that is left for compromise.
Break away from the curse of man's original sin. Turn away as you stay hidden behind a twisted grin.
Tragic memories invade.
Let the storm winds wash them all away. Purified I stand before the flames.
As the ashes cover yesterday.
Imprisoned by actions of the past. No use holding on.
