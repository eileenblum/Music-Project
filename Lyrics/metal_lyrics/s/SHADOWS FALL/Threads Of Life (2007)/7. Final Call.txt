Seeing it all. Heeding the call. Lost! Without hoping to be found.
A willing exile, I turn away.
Rather face the endless silence. Than the hopeless and fear of today.
The ashes choke the sky.
Death's swift hand in disguise. Awaiting the final call. No use hesitating.
ARE WE. Fearful of how dark it's grown.
The emptiness surrounds. WILL NOT BELIEVE. Refuse to think I'm on my own.
Who will be CAST OUT?
Trust in the lies that held you bound. Their twisted values lead you astray.
They disgrace the world with violence.
Leaving bitterness despair and decay
