Soon a darkened Pyramid will rise. Their will be no escaping from the all seeing eye.
Lost In Blindness. Serving shielded masters still unknown. Chaos is their goal.
Corrupt you heart and soul.
The air is getting thin. Will you give in? All the voices of the lost and forgotten.
Still lay in their graves  they've been silenced for their thoughts.
Lost in blindness.
This history is written in their blood. Chaos is their goal. Corrupt you heart and soul.
The air is getting thin. Will you give in? Burning the lives and the pride of innocents.
Tearing down all that we built!
