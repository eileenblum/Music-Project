I'd never leave you.
But fate has come to silence me.
Darkness is all I see.
I can not reach you.
And soon the earth will cover me.
It's become so hard to breathe.

Darkness is all that I see.  Forever is waiting.
The final steps you're taking.
Will soon be buried in the sand. All the battles. They say we won.
They leave another thousand lives undone.
Another thousand lives undone. Forever is waiting. The final steps your taking.
Will soon be buried in the sand.
You're gone, But not forgot. Another hero lost. The sorrow builds with every passing.
All the lessons that you taught.
And all the light  you brought. Lives on in the eyes of your son.
