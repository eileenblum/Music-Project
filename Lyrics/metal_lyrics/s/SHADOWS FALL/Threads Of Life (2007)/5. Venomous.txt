I only wanted to. Kill the pain and sorrow. Instead I buried you.
And killed the happiness in me.
Can you hear the laughter. Coming from my grave? Suddenly it seems to me.
That I am my own worst enemy.
We can never hope to breathe. In this misery. Full speed with blinders on.
Never stopped to see the horror.
I think you always knew. I'd drag you down to hell with me.
Suddenly it seems to me. That I am my own worst enemy.
We can never hope to breathe. Tangled in this misery. Think of all I've said and done.
All the fights I thought I won.
Another scar for the chosen son. The ungodly one. How can I.
Purge this venom from my veins?
Your sweetest suicide. Drags you in and flips that switch. As you fade away.
With the breath of every hit.
