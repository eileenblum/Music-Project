Reflecting on this life. Through the eyes of ancients. The wisdom of beyond.
CHANT! Chant them down.
DOWN! Into nothing. This power screams out from within. Like the tree's that struggle towards the sun.
Once again in due season we are reborn. Strike down the heathen. THIS MUST END.
Swaying deeply in rhythm with the winds. There are eternal lessons within it's pulse.

Raising their false banners of hope. Lies everlasting. Fighting to save their self interest.
DREAP UPRISING. An End to it all. DREAP UPRISING. Watch as they fall
