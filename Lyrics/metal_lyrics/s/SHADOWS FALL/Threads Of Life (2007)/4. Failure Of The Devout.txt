I am the heir of a damned kingdom. Born into a legacy of regret.
Searching for the promise of salvation.
Overwhelmed by the tides of our despair. Been pulled deep into chasm.
By the grip of our desire.
THE GRIP OF OUR DESIRE. Must escape the weight of this depression.
The choices that lead you to dismay.
Who would save those who condemn themselves? CRIPPLE! Cripple your own savior.
The failure, The failure of the devout.
Set in motion by final sacrifice. Change begun in the name of righteousness.
Infiltrated by greed, lust, and hatred.
Once more corrupted by the hands of man. Been pulled deep into chasm.

By the grip of our desire. Must escape the weight of this depression.
The choices that lead you to dismay.
The handsome mask of the devil. The lure of the cross! Of the dark!
You violate the sacred with your greed.
Prey upon people's misery and needs.
With your greed, With your greed, With your greed!
I am the heir of this damned kingdom.
Born into a life of regret. Searching for a promise. That's no longer kept.
