Intimidation, I stand before you now.
Hold my ground, you won't strike me down.
A validation of all the blood I spilled, survived of my will,
There's nothing to say,
Yourself you have betrayed,
We must try to seize the day,
All the world will hear you,
Our voices can't be bound,
All the world will hear you,
Redemption in the power of the sound,
Interpretation,
Of all the thoughts I shared,
Draw you near,
Creating all your fear.
A brand new nation.
For those who persevere.
The future is so clear.
