Guilt will twist the blade
Everyday the knife cuts deeper
How much more of this can you take
Your fake smile fades
Your public face has cracked and broken
Cannot run and hide from your mistakes
Your time is running out
This life of fear and doubt
Its not worth defending
The guilt is never ending
Judge not
Before you judge yourself
Regret
The only thing you felt
Too late
It's too late to save your soul
How far
Will you let it go
Your fate
Is not in your control
Too late
Its too late to save your soul
Your hollow words will never be enough
Haunted in the truth
The innocent paid for your actions
Always seem to crush the ones you love
Hide in your excuse
It strangles like a noose
Its not worth defending
The guilt is never ending
Judge not
Before you judge yourself
Regret
The only thing you felt
Too late
its too late to save your soul
Try to run and hide
Until the day
Until the day you die
All your foolish pride
It wont help you survive
Until the day you die
its not worth defending
The guilt is never ending
Judge not
Before you judge yourself
Regret
The only thing you felt
Too late
Its too late to save yourself
How far
Will you let it go
Your fate
Is not in your control
Too late
Its too late to save your soul
Try to run and hide
Until the day
Until the day you die
All your foolish pride
It wont help you survive
Until the day you die
