There is a darkness to the world
Too blind to see
You can't believe
That your way of life is dying
Strike at the heart of the machine
Dispel the poison
Kill the thieves
The walls of Babylon are falling
So leave me out on my own
Out here where I belong
Believing all you burned will live again
We're free and standing strong
Tear down the unknown
Standing on our own
Your system will be overthrown
Your world ground into dust
Bodies covered in ash
Cities burned to the ground
Your walls fall down
So leave me out on my own
Out here where I belong
Believing all you burned will live again
We're free and standing strong
