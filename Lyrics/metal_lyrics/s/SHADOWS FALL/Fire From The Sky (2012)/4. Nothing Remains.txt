Cannot find a reason why
Stop your life while you get high
Refuse to move refuse to try
Close your eyes and wait to die
All our heroes
Will burn
Burned in the fire
And now nothing remains
Through these swollen eyes
And this clouded mind
Time to face another day alone
(On your own)
You've been down this road before
The warning signs that you just ignored
You're on your own
Wrapped within the rings of smoke
With every ragged breath you choked
The only way you can cope
Forget the dreams forget the hope
Through these swollen eyes
And this clouded mind
Time to face another day alone
(On your own)
How long has it been
When will it ever end
Stumbling along until we die
(Until we die)
All our heroes
Burned in the fire
Nothing remains
Kill for just one night of rest
No matter how hard you resist
It digs it's claws into your soul
The demon never lets you go
Through these swollen eyes
And this clouded mind
Time to face another day alone
(On your own)
How long has it been
Will it ever end
Stumbling along until we die
(Until we die)
