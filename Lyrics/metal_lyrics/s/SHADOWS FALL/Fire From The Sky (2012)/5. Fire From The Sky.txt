Red sun at day break
Burns and blinds the eyes
And though our bodies ache
We march on or we die
Silence of space
Is torn by cries
Another hopeless world
Prepares to die
Are those the eyes of god
That burn so bright
Or the hands of death
Reaching through the night
The shadows creep
Darker than dead of night
Nowhere to hide
Your hunted by the light
Crushed by the weight
Of our own demise
Torn apart by gravity
Our world will not survive
Are those the eyes of god
That burn so bright
Or the hands of death
Reaching through the night
Death comes swiftly from above
Fire from the sky
The universe has come undone
Fire from the sky
It's own destruction fuels
A stars hunger to consume
Laying silently in its path
Planets await thy doom
Solar flared ignite the sky
And twist the atmosphere
Death is inching closer
Kill the light awaken fear
There's nowhere to run
There's nowhere left to hide
We are hunted by the light
Death comes swiftly from above
Universes come undone
There's nowhere left to hide
Are those the eyes of god
That burn so bright
Or the hands of death
Reaching through the night
Death comes swiftly from above
Fire from the sky
The universe has come undone
Fire from the sky
