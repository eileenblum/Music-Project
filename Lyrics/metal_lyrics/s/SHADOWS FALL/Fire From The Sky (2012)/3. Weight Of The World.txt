Haunted
By the life you wanted
Trapped by the hands of time
The end is near
And the end is what you fear
Fading
Hell is right here waiting
In the silence of your mind
Through your hide
Cannot kill the ghost inside
Are we born to bleed
The world consumes you
Can't breathe
Suffering
The world consumes you
These dreams dies before my eyes
Our futures lost and left to die
Running deep into the night
Abandoning the fight
As you flee
Turn your back on your beliefs
Chaos breathes life into the fire
Consumed by your desire
To save yourself
Save yourself and no one else
Are we born to bleed
The world consumes you
These dreams have died before my eyes
Our futures lost and left to die
It seems there nowhere left to die
Our futures lost and left to die
The panic will begin
It never seems to end
Trapped inside
How long will this torture last
The walls are closing in
You've given up again
The weight of the world crushes you into dust
These dreams have died before my eyes
Our futures lost and left to die
It seems there's nowhere left to hide
Our future in nothing
