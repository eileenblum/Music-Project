The night keeps reaching on and on
Kill the sun bury the dawn
A race begins that no one ever seems to win
The line remains unbroken
Smashing the doors wide open
All of my fears are blown away
My eyes are blinded
By the ice and snow
I walk the edge
(I walk the edge)
Just to feel alive
Lost in the endless night
I walk the edge till the end of time
I walk the edge
(I walk the edge)
Just to feel alive
Still trapped between the lines
I walk the edge till the end of time
I walk the edge
I walk the edge
