Depression breeds like rats
And turns your soul to black
You no longer care that you feel nothing
Bow down
And serve your master
Bow down
Your life is mine
Will you survive the day
Or will you disappear and fade away
Heard all you have to say
Lost within the grey
Your will has disappeared
Breath in the soulless air
An undead memory that's slowly fading
Bow down
Your life means nothing
Bow down
Your lost within
Will you survive the day
Or will you disappear and fade away
Same lies told another way
Lost within the grey
You sacrificed all that kept you strong
Changed your mind the minute things went wrong
Turned away from what you created
Bowed your head and served the ones you hated
I thought I knew you well
Now only time will tell
Will you survive the day
Or will you disappear and fade away
Heard all you had to say
Lost within the grey
You're lost
You're lost
