As the axe comes crashing down
Dragging us beneath the ground
Abandoned here you're gone without a sound

All you've taken, all you've said
Still hear your voice inside my head
Beaten, broken down and left for dead

Leave me to die
No more denial
No more restraint
No more conscience
And I will seal your fate

So close your eyes
And live in the unknown
Forsaken by the world
Your life has turned to stone

Balance of your mind decays
Only flesh and bone remains
The fire of the afterlife awaits

No more denial
No more restraint
No more conscience
And I will seal your fate

Just close your eyes again
There's no escape
Just close your eyes again
Your life is mine to take

So close your eyes (so close your eyes)
And live in the unknown
Forsaken by the world
Your life has turned to stone

There's no escape

Just close your eyes again
And I will seal your fate

So close your eyes
And live in the unknown

Surrender your free will
Your life has turned to stone

There's no escaping this!

So close your eyes (so close your eyes)
And live in the unknown (the unknown)
Forsaken by the world
Your life has turned to stone

There's no escape
