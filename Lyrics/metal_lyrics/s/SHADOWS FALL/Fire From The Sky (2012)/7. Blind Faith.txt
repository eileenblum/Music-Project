Unleash confusion
Hid every single trace
For everyone they kill
Ten more will take its place
Begin a never ending race
Every turn you change your face
Things are never what they seem
Thought that you were closing in
Lose your ground begin again
An endless cycle your trapped within
Cant believe
Conformity
Is enslaving me
Believing was your first mistake
Never asking questions
Deceiving but you learned too late
Bleed us dry and say were free
Buying everything they showed
No more questions do as your told
Revolution came and went
The walls are closing in
You'll pay the price for others sins
I cant believe
Conformity
Is enslaving me
Believing was your first mistake
Never asking questions
Deceiving but you learn too late
Bleed us dry and say were free
Conformity
Is enslaving me
Fight to be free
Believing was your first mistake
Never asking questions
Deceiving but you learn too late
Bleed us dry and say were free
