They've been living
Off the salt that's in your tears
Thriving on our suffering
For all these years
Reprogram our conscience
Twisted thoughts infect our mind
Tear apart our senses
Leave us paralyzed and blind
Abandoned and forgotten
We're standing on our own
Unite and rise together
And we will take control
System corrupted
That is feeding on itself
You divide and conquer
We find true wealth
The children of the after thought
The ones you left behind
Your neglect has built our strength
And through it all we will survive
Abandoned and forgotten
Shatter our faith and trust
You've taken everything
It never seems to be enough
You've taken everything...
Lost
Lost
Generation left for dead
Faith
Faith
No more faith no more trust
Lies Lies
Deft everything you said
Die Die
Through it all we will survive
No more compromise
Shatter our faith and trust
You've taken everything
It never seems to be enough
No more compromise
And through it all
We will survive
