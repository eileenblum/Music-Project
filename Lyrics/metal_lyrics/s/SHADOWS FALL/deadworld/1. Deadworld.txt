Drowning yourself in a world of lies 
Wandering lost, until the ego dies 
Perceptions been tainted by your lack of free will 
We have become what we once most feared 

The brilliance of the light's been dulled to grey 
Denying our souls of the most noble truths 
Trapped within and blined by youth 

[Chorus:]
We must end this wicked game 
Mourning a dead world 
Empty life of relentless shame 
Mourning a dead world 
See through what's been taught to you 
Mourning a dead world 
Breathe in life and seek the truth 
Mourning a dead world 

As progress paves the forest and paints the sky 
Cities rise like caner, rive of life is dry 
Spirits of ancients will then awake a rise 
The seal is broken, final sign of our demise 

[Repeat chorus]

Awake and rise 
Redemption fires 
Burn the lies 
Redemption fires
