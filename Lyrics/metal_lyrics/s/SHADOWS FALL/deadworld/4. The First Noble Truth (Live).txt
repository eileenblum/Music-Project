As reality washes away the faded memories of daylight
This is my escape
Realization of my mind's own deceit
Perception slips away

Lulled into a fools paradise
Words mislead again
The agony of imaginary sins and fears
Truth of suffering

Buried dreams that shadow me, I feel it's all been wasted (Dreams that shatter me)
Break my dreams to free my soul because I won't even notice (Dreams to free my soul)

Disintegration of the ego with what this mind creates
False idea of self
The cessation of continuity and becoming
True enlightenment

Buried dreams that shadow me, I feel it's all been wasted (Dreams that shatter me)
Break my dreams to free my soul because I won't even notice (Dreams to free my soul)
Someone free me from heaven torn asunder
Full of empty promises to be there if I wonder (Alone and wandering)

Will not remain enslaved
This world's transparency
I see right through
I walk alone

As reality washes away the faded memories of daylight
This is my escape
Realization of my mind's own deceit
Perception Slips away

Buried dreams that shadow me, I feel it's all been wasted (Dreams that shatter me)
Break my dreams to free my soul because I won't even notice (Dreams to free my soul)
Someone free me from heaven torn asunder
Full of empty promises to be there if I wonder (Alone and wandering)

Extinction of thirst
Extinction of desire
Extinction of hatred
Extinction of illusion
This is absolute.
