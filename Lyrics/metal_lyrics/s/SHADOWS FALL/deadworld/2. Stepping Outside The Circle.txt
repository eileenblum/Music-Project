Here I go again
A vicious cycle without end
Seeking distance for security
A desperate act to remain free

A balance point cannot be found
This whole thing will come crashing down
Down! Down!
My fear will drag you down
Into this world that i create
Your love for me has sealed your fate

Down! Down!
My fear will drag you down
Can I trust in what i feel?
Praying that this time it's real

[Chorus:]
Feel the strain!
All this times been spent in vain, MY SHAME!
open wounds that still remain, DECAY!
As my faith is stripped away, YOU'LL STRAY!
The final price I have to pay

Digging in deeper still
The hollowness I yearn to fill
The story always ends the same
The cycle soon begins again

Stepping outside the circle!
