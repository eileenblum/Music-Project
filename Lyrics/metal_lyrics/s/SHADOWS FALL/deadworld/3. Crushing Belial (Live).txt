First strike of the creation
Shakes the earth at its very core
Pangea shattered, humanity is scattered
Separation for evermore

Eternal conflict, waged since the dawn of time
A delicate balance waits. This evil seems to be undermined
As the battle lines are drawn, and the kingdoms choosing sides
Concealed from his light. Abandon all that unifies.

Been fooled so long by the lies of this unholy adversary
Flee the lies

The Godhead has been split, exiled by mankind
Although we're out of reach, His message transcending time
As the battle lines are drawn, and the kingdoms choosing sides
Concealed from his light. Abandon all that unifies.

Been fooled so long by the lies of this unholy adversary

How can we free this world? It soon will melt away
As we await the wrath, of a God Betrayed
How can we save this world? It soon will melt away
As we await the wrath, of a God Betrayed 

Rise stand take over, we are crushing Belial
Rise stand take over, we are crushing Belial

Alone I am feeling caught within it's wind
When I noticed all hope is lost and blown away

Never knowing what may come
Never showing what's been done
Never knowing what may come
Never showing what's been done

Realized potential so long in denial
Cast off this shadow, escaping Belial
Redemption of the forgotten
Redemption of the forgotten

How can we free this world? It soon will melt away
As we await the wrath, of a God Betrayed
How can we save this world? It soon will melt away
As we await the wrath, of a God Betrayed 

Rise stand take over, we are crushing Belial
Rise stand take over, we are crushing Belial
