When you never know
Is when it's always there,
It seemed so clear...

The slightest touch
To catch the breath,
It turns it all around

Single path that I can see,
Emptiness devours me

Enlightened by the cold.
It overcomes the torment.
(What if I could bring you back?)
Enlightened by the cold

Enough to burn through walls
Built on anguish
Can I be revived?

Let it hit with force
Strong enough to blind.
The numbness heals.

My worth is only defined
By the next disaster
