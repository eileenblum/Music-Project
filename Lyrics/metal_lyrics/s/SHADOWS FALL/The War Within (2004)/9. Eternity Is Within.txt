Man has programmed himself to die
A death wish has been ingrained
Almost with our first breath
We are taught to expect our last

Science has done its best to choke off
The true instincts of mankind
Death is impatient and thoughtless
Mortality is a disease of the mind

Embrace the gifts before you
Paradise is underfoot
Eternity is within

Lost site of the bounty before us
Boundless resource of pleasure and plenty
Living for an intangible
In a future clouded with doubt

One step forward is one step
deeper into the grave

Breathe... breath of life
