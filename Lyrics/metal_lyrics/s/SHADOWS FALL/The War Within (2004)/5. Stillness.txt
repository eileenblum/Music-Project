Impermanence is always swift
Treasures of this world are fleeting
Our eyes blinded from the gift
Within the way there lies the meaning

All natures are pure
All appearances are empty

Shrouded in sensation and delusion
Consumed within unknowns
Shrouded in sensation and delusion
All will collapse and fall

All wisdom is treasured
All wealth is a shadow

Inexpressible in words
Embrace the stillness
Endless source, Eternal bliss

Absence of the mind is liberation
