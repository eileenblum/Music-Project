Where has it all gone?
Have all of the words escaped?

Inspiration on demand
Emotions all displaced

'And I will wander endlessly
Seeking all the answers that I let slip
through my fingers.
I will wander endlessly
Seeking all the answers that
I let slip and fall away.'

Turn it all around
It melts into sound
(unfolding... ever growing)

Torn from my rest
Though I still fight to stay.
The images dissolve
As the day invades

A second to react
The mind too slow to act
(unfolding... ever growing)

Drown the voices of restraint
Make them choke to silence

Incinerate the ropes
And embrace the hope
(unfolding... ever growing)

Splintering the doors
Free the mind to soar
(unfolding... ever growing)

Turn it all around
It melts into sound
