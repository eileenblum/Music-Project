Scream out against the glass
The sound reflected unable to escape
Desperate to connect
Lashing out at words that fail to appear

Bound In Silence
The Failure Of Sound (never learned)

Instinct urges on
As the mind creates its own obstacles
Waging internal war
Between the objects and the abstract

Eloquence of the inner voice
The poetry of the condemned
A stream of consciousness
Never to be understood
