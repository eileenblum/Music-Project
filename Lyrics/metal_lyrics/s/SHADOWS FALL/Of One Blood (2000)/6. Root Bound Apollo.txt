Stagnation, motionless air
A shroud cast over understanding
Gasping to inhale the manna of life
But still you decay
So wake up and strengthen what you have
Before it dies completely
I am the first, I am the last
I am the living one
fury of a God encaged in
Human self doubt
Power to create burns within all
All Jah children
I am the first until this day unseen
And I search for this light within me
As you turn toward the sky
Script of thousand lies, and in judgement you,
Burn, Fir burn them.
Burn, Fire burn them.
Stagnation, motionless air
A shroud cast over understanding
Gasping to inhale the manna of life
But still you decay
So wake up and strengthen what you have
Before it dies completely
I am the first, I am the last
I am the living one
fury of a God encaged in
Human self doubt
Power to create burns within all
All Jah children
Burn, Fir burn them.
Burn, Fire burn them.
The comfort for which you yearn
I find within myself, I and I
Now summon forth this hailstorm
Of blood and ash
In judgement this fire forever will burn
In judgement shall fire burn.
