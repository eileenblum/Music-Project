Toppling building blocks
At the base of all mankind
Redirection of evolution
Electromagnetic control of the mind
Arising from technology
Creation, new entity
Mankind, forever be
Bound, and gagged
A new breed of control
Manipulation of space and time
Warped perception dictating action
Sick delusion they're divine
Arising from technology
Creation, a new entity
Mankind, forever be
Bound, and gagged
Mechanically possessed, placed under control
They keep us marching
Mechanically possessed, placed under control
They keep us marching
A conspiracy unwinds
As the government denies
Lost children pays the price
Suffocated by their lies
Arising from technology
Creation, a new entity
Mankind forever be
Bound, and gagged
Toppling the building blocks
At the base of all mankind
Redirection of evolution
Electromagnetic control of the mind
Arising from technology
Creation, a new entity
Mankind, Forever be
Bound, and gagged
Mechanically possessed, placed under control
They keep us marching on
What did they hope to find
What did they hope to gain
What did they hope to find
And what has become
They kept us bound and gagged
