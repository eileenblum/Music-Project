Anticipation of a reward so pleasing
Inhibitions ensnaring me like shackles
Unrelenting urge to quench, to grtify
All consuming senses of the primitive
And I remain, drenched in the excess of every movement
Serenity in this repetition
Within the peace of this meditation
Convergence of spirit and the physical
Achievement of pure integration
No longer distort the true expression of the soul
And I remain, drenched in the excess of every movement
Serenity of this repetition
Forever be searching foward
Nothing remains left behind
Forever be clawing foward
Continuance of my line
Writhing with virility
Instinct to perpetuate
Divert mortality
Extend my soul beyond
Anticipation of a reward so pleasing
Inhibitions ensnaring me like shackles
Unrelenting urge to quench, to gratify
All consuming senses of the primitive
And I remain, drenched in the excess of every movement
Serenity of this repetition
Forever be searchign foward
Nothing remains left behind
Forever clawing foward
Continuance of my life
