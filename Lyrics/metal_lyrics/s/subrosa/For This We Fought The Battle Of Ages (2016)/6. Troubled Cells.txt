There, beyond the windowsill
Lies the child that we all dread
An affront to our ease and our lassitude
A thorn in our side
How soon will she die?

Now every road I take, no matter how far
Leads me back here again, convicted by your smile
And every waking dream, and every wasted hour
Seems veined with a disease that I cannot escape

Soft music plays on the gramophone
A fire in the grate, arm around your wifeâs waist
Warms your crocodile tears
As you think of the child under the cellar stairs
When will she disappear?

If thereâs no way through for you, thereâs no way through for me
I refuse the cool gardens, I reject my honored seat
If thereâs no way through for you, thereâs no way through for me
I donât need the golden banners, I donât need the vain embrace

Now, every road I take, no matter how far
Leads me back here, convicted by your smile
All is veined with a disease that I cannot escape
For troubled cells do not a healthy body make

There is no greater good if youâre trodden underfoot â
There is no greater good.
Paradise is a lie if we have to burn you at the stake to get inside
Paradise is a lie if youâre not by my side
