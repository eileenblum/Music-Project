Revealing love to be a test tube of untidy sludge
Is the greatest triumph of the modern era
Evolution belies this unfortunate defect
Weâre smoothing out the gross chaos of biology

Antithesis to precision
A threat to order and reason
Inverse of numbers

The fruits of the heart are a useless and troublesome thing
A waste of time, thief of quota and peace of mind
Rapture is such an inefficient emotion
With the surgical arts, weâll free them from their foolish hearts

To feel is the enemy
To be a dead tomb is a mercy

Hanno combattuto la battaglia della loro vita per questo
Per essere fatti a pezzi, per venire ridotti al nulla

The time has come to take someone, anyone
Courtship is no more than a menu of flesh and blood
Weâre interchangeable as dung at the city dump â
A city laid waste, where everythingâs been decided for us

So get a ticket
Erase all difference
Undo the burden of identity (your body is not your own)
