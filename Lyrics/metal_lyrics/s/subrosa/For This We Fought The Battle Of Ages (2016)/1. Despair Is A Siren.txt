Let down a rope
I know there is another world
In their geometry
Is a straight line to a living death

The earth is shifting like a plate
My skin doesnât fit anymore
Iâm hanging by the noose of their lamp cord
I see the bars of the cage

Like paper dolls weâre linked here
Homesick for chains
In their gilded whalebones
We gasp and wilt away

The earth is shifting like a plate
My skin doesnât fit anymore
Iâm writhing in the flame of their ghost lights
I see the bars of the cage

Despair is a siren calling through the night
The earth wraps itself in a shroud
I curse my fate, I curse my free will

In you, I see the glass towers coming down
In you, I see something that died in me fester and ignite

Iâm not sleeping in glass chambers
Whoâs the dead one now?
My stand lives on in gas chambers
Whoâs the dead one now?
