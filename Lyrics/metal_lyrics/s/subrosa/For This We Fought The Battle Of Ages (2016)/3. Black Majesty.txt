Isnât it good to be acquainted with darkness,
To caress it gently, to slit its throat, 
To know the hidden pockets, caves and grottos of the mirrored landscape,
To catch a glimpse of black majesty, 
To know thereâs more horror to this existence than anyone could ever know,
Standing in the shadow of our own?

Isnât it beautiful 
To know exquisite remorse,
To see the truth that drives men fleeing into early graves,
To be wise, to dream every day of a great escape, of a Houdini blade?

We love the taste of false perfection â the more the lies, the more we laud.

Isnât it beautiful to live and die alone, to carve a path out of unyielding stone between the crushing narrow divide of the war of two tribes steeped in a hate so narrow and deep it leaves two inches of earth on either side to save you from the final breath-taking fall into a deep hush â a silence so profound that your ears run and melt with the deafening sound?
