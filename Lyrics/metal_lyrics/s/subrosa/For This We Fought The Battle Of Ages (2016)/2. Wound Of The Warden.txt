The wound of the warden
From cradle to the grave
The senseless apprehension
Of freedomâs wily ways

I know one day theyâll be grateful
I know one day theyâll worship me

Choice is too precious
To be wasted on vermin
Thatâs how weâll keep them
Sheltered, fetal, fed and glutted

The sweet drug of anesthesia
Hell is easy to find
And I know that in time theyâll be glad I kept them blind

I will save you, I will absolve you
I will spare you, I will rob you
Iâll take upon me the canker of knowledge
Iâll take upon me the fetid price of glory

How great it is, the transcendent goodness
The self-assurance of the pure

Suffering eases at the gates
And laughter ceases at the gates
Someone above you always knows better than you
Thereâs something comforting in the stranglehold of a shepherdâs crook

How great it is, the transcendent goodness
The self-assurance of the pure
Not one misstep, not one mistake
All calculated for our sake
Like children weâll step into the fire
