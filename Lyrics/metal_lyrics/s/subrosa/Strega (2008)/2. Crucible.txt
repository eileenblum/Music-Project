WeÂ´ll scour the ghettosFor the trash of the earthPut em on the frontlineThey won't be missed Step into my crucibleWarm yourself in my crucibleBurn and die in my crucible We'll bribe their grieving familiesWith the fat of the landSpread distorted visionsTill they eat from our hand The victims of the system Are the first to be servedTo propagate that systemThey're meat in our mill Cast into the futile battle In the caste system Of feudal lordsCrying from theBottom of the pileIn the voice of a number We're paragons of virtueAnd you are the sameWhen you die in our turnstileWe'll protect your name
