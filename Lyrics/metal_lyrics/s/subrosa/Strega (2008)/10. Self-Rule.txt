Self-RuleFixed bayonets in the crisp autumn airAnd I have to wonder why I don't even careScarlet epaulets and well-oiled hair I invade the nations of the poorBut I can't fight my own battles, can't find a cureI'll make them feel my rod till they can't take anymore A cry of war is heard throughout the landBut all I have self-blame on handI'll crush their kingdom with a fistful of sand I'll subject you to horrorI'll subject you cause I can't rule myselfI  rule a nationI  rule a nation but can't rule myself Fixed bayonets in the crisp autumn airAnd I have to wonder why I don't even careI have to wonder why I don't even care
