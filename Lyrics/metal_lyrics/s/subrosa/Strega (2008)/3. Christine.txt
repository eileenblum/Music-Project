Whispers on the back porchThe don't want you anymoreHe beat you till were rawThen he took something more Christine At school the girls call you a whoreYour lunch money on the floorBut they look you up and down You found that you were weakAt forgiving enemiesSo much darkness in that roomNo one gets you, no one could Never giving inNever again
