I know a path in the woodsDon't be afraid; they're only shadowsIt's safer here when there's two I thought I heard her callingI thought I saw her falling(I swear I saw her falling) You look so levely in the shadowsI've forgotten why I ever angeredI see your eyes in the shallows Her reflection lies in dirty waterAnd now her body's like an angelNow her body's like an angelAnd now I know I'll never anger
