HeÂ´s a long way from homeAnd the shots cut him him downI saw it in a dream I had last night I saw the shots cut him downAnd smoke all aroundAnd his broken body lying in the sand Though I know that my son died for a new dayAnd for all the millions that would pass this wayIf God himself should knock on my doorI'd turn him away, say I ain't got no more to give Well, the prince keeps us downSteals our money for his crownAnd the lies he tells us never go away In the darkest nightWe had to stand up and fightIt was that or die forever on our knees The day he left for war,Silhouetted against the door, I had to look away and hide my face for shame.
