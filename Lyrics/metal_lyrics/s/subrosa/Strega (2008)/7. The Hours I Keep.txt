Oh motherOh fatherYou gave me liefYou gave me death Oh motherOh fatherYou loved me wellYou canÂ´t help me now There is no escape Dark water all aroundOn the broken bridgeRevere is bound A dead-end mazeDark passagewaysSynapse collapseReality break It's morningTwelve hours of sleepYou won't believe the hours I keep A veil is placed before my eyesI can't see myselfI can't see their lies I'm buried in this bag of skinWith sham circuitryWhere do I begin? Oh motherOh fatherYou gave me lifeYou gave me death
