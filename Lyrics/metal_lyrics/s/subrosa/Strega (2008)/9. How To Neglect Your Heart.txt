The laugh at meIÂ´m all aloneThe question meIn jagged tones The try to tell me what's trueAnd what's not trueAs if they knewAs if they knew They tell me how to feelThey tell me what I'm worthThey tell me how I failedAll in their own words The tell me how to loveAnd how to get alongPassion's all rightAs long as it's not too strong Here's how you play the gameHere's how you play your partHere's how you go alongHere's how to neglect your heart Fixed lifeLike the starsNever movingNever far
