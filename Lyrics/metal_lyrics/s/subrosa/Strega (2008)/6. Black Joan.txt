Out on the quay Trash for the dayI've got a feelingI can't explain Is it my futureBuried in my past?All that I know isIt might just last Black Joan This begging life keepsOn dragging me downI'm sick of small changeI'm sick of this town Gotta find a new wayTo make things rightGotta write my own story;It begin's tonight. Black Joan I hear my train a-cominBlack wheels like thunder rollinWon't you help me pack my backs?I'm leavin and I'm not comin back.  DissatisfactionPlagued me all longBut I never felt my lackTill I heard your song.
