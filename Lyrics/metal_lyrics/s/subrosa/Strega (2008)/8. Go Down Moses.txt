When Isreal was in Egypt's landLet me people goOppressed so hard the could not standLet my people go Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt's landTell old Pharaoh, let my people go So Moses went to Egypt's landLet my people goTo make old Pharaoh understandLet my people goThus spake the Lord, bold Moses said, Let my people goIf not, I'll strike your firstborn deadLet my people go
