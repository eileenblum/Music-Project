It's been 18 years in this prison cellSeparated from my best friendHe lives out in the men's wingI send him pictures in my head. How long must I suffer, Lord?How much can I take?How long must I languish, Lord,Before they come take me away,Take me away? Gonna get free,Gonna get free tonight. I send the blueprints from my thoughtsAnd we plan our escape.We ain't goin' nowhere without our friends,So we tell them all the date. Bessy's got the sledgehammerAnd Marvin's got the screw.Sally's got the heart of the guard,She knows just what to do. Gonna get free,Gonna get free tonight. We make our way in the moonlight,It helps us on our way,By the time they find our empty beds,We're 18 miles away,18 miles away. Hold me tight.Hold me tight tonight.
