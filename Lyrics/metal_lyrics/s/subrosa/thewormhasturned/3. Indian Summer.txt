MidnightHarvest moonWe'll catch the coachNot a moment too soon,My love. let's fly away from here. Autumn blushYour first touchIndian summer begins at dusk, My love.Our love will never die,Our love will never die. Winter paleKilling frostThe doctor says prepare for loss, My love.Let's fly away from here. Steel ground,Fresh grave,They laid us together, we'll make our way, My love.Our love will never die.
