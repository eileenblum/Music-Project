Flailing under the auspices of a broken kingdomStuttering up the stairs of a broken houseThe golden mansionThe hanging boudoirThe flowers, thick and heavy. Blown away by rusting debrisIn the belly of the gutted towerRapunzel dies today, Rapunzel dies Cinched tight by her own hairGolden self-destruct, miles long,Neverending, neverending. Passes over your skin soft as angel's breath Help me. Help me. Help me. I found myself choking on golden stardustComing up from my gutMy innermost nucleusBut then I realizedI was choking on the ashes of a dead sun. Help me. Help me. Help me.
