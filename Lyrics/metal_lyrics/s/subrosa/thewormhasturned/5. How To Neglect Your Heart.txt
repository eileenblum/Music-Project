They laugh at me, I'm all aloneThey question me in jagged tones They try to tell me what's trueAnd what's not trueAs if they knew, as if they knew They tell me how to feelThey tell me what I'm worthThey tell me how I've failedAll in their own words They tell me how to love and how to get alongPassion's all right as long as it's not too strong Here's how you play the gameHere's how you play your partHere's how you go alongHere's how to neglect your heart Fixed lifeLike the starsNever moving, never far
