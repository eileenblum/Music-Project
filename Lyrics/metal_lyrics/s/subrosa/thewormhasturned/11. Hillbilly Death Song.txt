Oh, it's good to die when you don't want to live no moreIt's good to die when you don't want to live no more When the happy moments of your life seem like tiny isolated islandsAnd the pieces of your soul are reaching up and choking you like liquid violence Oh, it's good to die when you don't want to live no more(Yee haw!)
