10 a.m. and I'm drunk againBitter cognac, sweet reliefI held your mother before she floated awaySweet baby skin Broken window latchYour nail lash, your warm fleshThe only way I'll ever love is by force I'm asleep in the chasm. The only way I'll ever love is by forceI run from hell through golden aloeEverything moves so slowWhen all your lovers leave you
