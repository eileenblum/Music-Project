Fixed bayonets in the crisp autumn airAnd I have to wonder why I don't even careScarlet epaulets and well-oiled hairI have to wonder, really have to wonder I invade the nations of the poorBut I can't fight my own battles, can't find a cureI'll make them feel my rod till they can't take anymoreCan't find a cure, can't find a cure A cry of war is heard throughout the landBut all I have is self-blame on handI'll crush their kingdom with a fistful of sandSelf-blame on hand, self-blame on hand. I'll subject you to horrorI'll subject you cause I can't rule myselfI rule a nationI rule a nation but I can't rule myself Fixed bayonets in the crisp autumn airAnd I have to wonder why I don't even careI have to wonder why I don't even careI have to wonder, really have to wonder
