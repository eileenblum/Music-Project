I took the safe road, I took the easy roadIt looked so safe and comfortingThere wasn't any trouble as far as I could see. Avoided the twisty road,Avoided the unknown,My daddy said that was the devil's wayAnd God don't work in mystery noways. Though I keep on trying to believe that there's an end to all this painI just keep moving on, I can't stop to think too long, oh no.Though I keep on trying to believe that there's a way to be set freeI just keep losin' hold of the things that once gave me relief. Got married in the winter, gave birth in the summerIn five years' time I had five young onesBut there was something missing, there was something wrong. One day my husband came back from townSaid honey, you better sit downThere's been another woman for all this timeShe's my one true love, can't get her from my mind Now I break my back from crack of dawnIt's midnight when I get homeThere never seems to be enough to eatAnd I listen to my children cry themselves to sleep. Though I keep on trying to believe that there's an end to all this painI just keep moving on, I can't stop to think too long, oh no.Though I keep on trying to believe that there's an end to all this painI just look in the mirror and I know I only have myself to blame. I took the safe road, I took the easy roadBut I learned there is no safety thereYou gotta push against the current to get somewhere.
