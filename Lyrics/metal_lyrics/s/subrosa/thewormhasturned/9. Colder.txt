Look how far I've come todayI feel I could go forever this wayMy back is strong, my legs are longMy coat is warm, my shoes not worn. But it grows colder, colder still.It grows cold, it grows cold, it grows colder, colder. I mark my day on the widow's walkI watch the sea, hear the sailors talk;I pined away on my deathbed,Can you blame me for the things I did? You grew colder, colder still.You grew cold, you grew cold, you grew colder (your memory),You grew cold, you grew cold, you grew colder, colder. I broke the trust I had with you;I broke your heart, I wasn't true.I denied myself of pretty things;I lied to myself to go on breathing. I grew colder, colder still;I grew cold, I grew cold, I grew colder, colder still,I grew cold, I grew cold, I grew cold, I grew cold, I grew cold ...
