Donât tread the path of the enlightened
Donât swallow their sugared seeds of poison
Their Daâath leads to that black moonrise
Where the bodies stack up to the rafters

We touch the planets yet weâre no closer to the heavens
We gaze at the stars from our pig trough
We map the silver depths of the ocean
While we bathe in the blood of the hated

Spare me from your kingdom

Born without a coin in my mouth
I still crawl toward the sun
Hands in the cracks of the walls of your mind
I dismantle your thoughts

Eating grapes in dens of steel
Buffing that old carnage wheel
Sitting safe on marble thrones
Perched atop levees of bones
