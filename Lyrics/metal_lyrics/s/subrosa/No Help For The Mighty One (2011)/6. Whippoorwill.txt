Oh, my Sallyâs done gone
And itâs all my fault
Oh, my Sallyâs done gone
I never listened to a word she said

The purple hills
Seem to call out her name
Like the whippoorwill
I didnât listen to the warning she gave

I know thereâs no turning back

She tried to share
All her worries with me
But I was bowed down with care
I didnât see the trap I was in

One look in her eyes
Full of knowledge and pain
Oh, my pack of lies
Melted fast as my alibis

I know thereâs no turning back
And one day Iâll be like a bird in flight
Floating over this valley so wide
And one day Iâll be like a bird in flight
Floating over this desert so wide
