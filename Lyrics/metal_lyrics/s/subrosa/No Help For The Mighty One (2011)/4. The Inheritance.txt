Subgenus lace
A chain-linked fate
The bees fly North
They can feel the hangman coming

Millions of machines
Never before seen
Unstitched, unraveling
Laid to rest in a dying world

Oh sister/brother, weâre all burning high
I see white dust against the sky
This genocide rivals Dachau
In its endless march of victims

They say the meek
Shall inherit the earth
But all I see are the helpless
Crushed by the wheel of man

They look away
They hide their face
Black market backwash
You see, in this world, money kills

Weâre in the shadow of a dying world
