Mountains swallow you

I separated myself from the earth
I separated myself from the sky
I separated myself from the crowd
Then I separated myself into two selves

O Lord

Then I turned myself against myself
I waged a war within myself
I turned myself against myself
I waged a war against myself

Thereâs no help for the mighty ones now
