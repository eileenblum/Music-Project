Walk just behind me
In my shadow
Walk just behind me
Never stray

The sun is setting
Mountains on fire
Weâre so alone here
Donât go far

Sing a lullaby, sleep now
Itâs just a dream, sleep now
This canât be real, sleep now

The starlight marks
The path of the fearful
The ice caves glitter
In the dark

Theyâre coming fast now
Blood on the snow
He holds her hand
Shuts her lifeless eyes

Itâs just a dream, sleep now
This canât be real, sleep now
The cold invites, sleep now

Open wide the gates
Horns sound from the bay
Open wide the gates
Donât look back in vain

You are like a swan
Trapped in ice
Beautiful, strong
And now Iâm alone

This canât be real, sleep now
The cold invites, sleep now
Iâve found my peace, sleep now
