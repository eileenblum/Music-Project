No one ever sees the puppet strings
No one ever sees the dark country
I know youâre coming for me now
I feel you coming for me now

No one ever feels
The heavy weight of lies revealed
No one ever feels
The burning towns, the burning fields

I know youâre coming for me now
I feel you coming for me now
I see that black horse coming now
I know youâre coming for me now
