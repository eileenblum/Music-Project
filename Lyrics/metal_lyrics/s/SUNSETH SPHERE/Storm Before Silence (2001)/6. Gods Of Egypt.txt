Rolls of papyrus
Turn to dust at the touch of my hand 
Dust falls to sand
Sand of the ancient Egyptian land
I see a storm
As darkness fills the empty sky
See thousands cry
They slowly crawl in the mud of Nile
Seth is thirsty for revenge
Pain of his wounds brings the end
Pours rain of melting diamonds
On the people's praying hands
And ash falls on the burning mown land
I have a look
How the gods left their land
They've left their people alone 
In those evil hands
Seth is still thirsty
He wants to kill
People fall to earth with
Faces hidden in their hands
Dust is thrown into the wind
