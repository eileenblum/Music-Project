[by Monika Gyebnar]

[Female:]

Open the door
You'll see the light
Beyond the stars
Life after light
Behind each breath 
Hides an exhale
Born with the sun 
Die with a fail
Open your eyes 
You'll see the shrouds
As water falls 
Up to the clouds
Roam the hard road
Climb to the peak
Fly with the light 
And fall down weak

[Male:]

Life is a flashlight between two moments
Handful of pale sand amongst the dunes
Life is the chaos inside the order
Life is a false note amongst the tunes
