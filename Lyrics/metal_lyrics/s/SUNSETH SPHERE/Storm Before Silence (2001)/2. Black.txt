[by Monika Gyebnar]

Black is the color of your contradiction
Black is the color of your forgotten dreams
Black is the color of your eyes' reflection
Black is the color of your enormous means
When you're leaving
You leave a black world behind
When you're crying
You cry black tears of your mind
Black is the color of all your lost emotions
Black is the color of the book that you have closed
Black is the color of your dangerous illusions
Black is the color of the end you miss the most
