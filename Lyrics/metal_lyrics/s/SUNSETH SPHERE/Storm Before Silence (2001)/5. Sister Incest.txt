[by Monika Gyebnar]

I'm the mother of my brother 
I'm the sister of my son
I'm the lover of my father
Our veins are filled with God of Sun
Dynasty's based on our sin 
Shadows penetrate my mind
We are the heirs of falling dim
Our blood will mark eternal time
Dark brown sunset, close my eyes,
With warm beams pet my disguise!
My soul drifts through a thousand years;
I'm flying cross incestuous realms 
Oblivion took my past
Wars behind but peace at last 
Pain and bloodstains in my dreams
I cry the world what all this means
My sweet son: my hopeless sin
Useless fate I'm fallen in
No chance, in vain you dig the sand
Without a vault I'm yet transcend.
