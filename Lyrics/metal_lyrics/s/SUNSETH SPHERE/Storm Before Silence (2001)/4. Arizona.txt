[by Monika Gyebnar]

No harm no pain
No deeds in vain 
No need to teach a bird to fly 
No stairway up to reach the sky 
I've opened up my senses 
To a world that hides inside 
Closed behind my eyelids 
And lives only at night 
Draw my dreams into the wind 
Throw my words into the sea 
Mix my voice into the snow 
Melt my eyes with the lightning 
To find the peace of mind
