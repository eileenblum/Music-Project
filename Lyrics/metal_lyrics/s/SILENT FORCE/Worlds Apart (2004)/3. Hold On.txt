Lead us into this world so cold
The sign of the gods are within your own

Are you searching for impossible dreams?
Can you believe in what your eyes have been seeing?
(Seeing is believing)

Here in the now, you'll use what you're told
But never give up like the ones who've grown so old

If you're searching for impossible dreams
There is always someone made to believe that you

Hold on, you can hold on to the people you believe in
And never let them go
Hold on, hold on to the feelings that you're feeling
Hold on and never let them go

Have you ever felt the world just bring you down
Death comes by fast, that you'll never leave this ground

If you're searching for impossible dreams
That you'll never let the others deceive you
There is always someone made to believe that you

Hold on, you can hold on to the people you believe in
And never let them go
Hold on, hold on to the feelings that you're feeling
Hold on and never let them go

Have you ever felt the world just bring you down
Never leave the ground
Have you ever felt your dreams take you away
Take you away

Hold on, you can hold on to the people you believe in
And never let them go
Hold on, hold on to the feelings that you're feeling
Hold on and never let them go
