Are you the one to break me?
And did you come from nowhere?
Tell me how you'll take me
Will you take me elsewhere?
Do you think you're clever?
Sneaking up behind me
I believe you're evil
Do you think that I can see?

A thousand hearts that you have sewn
Covering your body head to toe

Death comes in disguise (and fades away)
Wears a mask that's enticing you
Death comes in disguise (and fades away)
Masquerading for you to view

She wreaks extinction
As she glides into a room
Well, there's no suspicion
As we're blinded to the gloom
And my hands are shaking
Dripping wet with apathy
Never looking over
She's come, she's after me

A thousand hearts that you have sewn
Covering your body head to toe

Death comes in disguise (and fades away)
Wears a mask that's enticing you
Death comes in disguise (and fades away)
Masquerading for you to view

[Instrumental: Ode to Joy]

Death comes in disguise (and fades away)
Wears a mask that's enticing you
Death comes in disguise (and fades away)
Masquerading for you to view
Death comes in disguise (and fades away)
Wears a mask that's enticing you
Death comes in disguise (and fades away)
Masquerading for you to view
