[Clayton C. Cooper's Intro: "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"]

Only the child sleeps with a conscience that is clear
Closes his eyes, drifting away without a fear
The innocent mind, I envy all that's pure
Grace his young years, within him is the man

Was he chosen
Chose to be within my life
Chose to be here in my life

Spread your wings, little man
Grab the sun, the hopes and dreams
Of everyone lies in your arms
Spread your wings, little man
Embrace the love that sends you on your way

My promise to you is that I'll do the best I can
Protect you from harm, but there's only so much I can do
You'll be left without a weight upon your shoulders
Oh how I wish that I could save you from this cold world

Are we the chosen?
The chosen ones placed in your life
Chose to guide you through your life

Spread your wings, little man
Grab the sun, the hopes and dreams
Of everyone lies in your arms
Spread your wings, little man
Embrace the love that sends you on your way

Oh, every day the world seems new
When I take one look at you
A feeling comes from deep, it brings a smile
You know when I'm falling
Picks me up and takes it all away
Spread your wings, little man

Spread your wings, little man
Grab the sun, the hopes and dreams
Of everyone lies in your arms
Spread your wings, little man
Embrace the love that sends you on your way

Come on, spread your wings - Spread your wings, little man
All your hopes and dreams
Come on, spread your wings
All your hopes and dreams
Come on, spread your wings
Embrace the love that sends you on your way
