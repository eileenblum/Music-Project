The ones who were lost
Have become all our heroes
For those who are left
Left here behind

Believing they'd return
The morning that they woke
Not knowing that it would be
The last time they had spoke

To the ones who left behind
The many tears we cried with them in mind
To the ones who left behind
So many tears were cried from all mankind

They cannot try and tell
Was the name of religion?
That drove them to do
What they have done

No one heard God's voice
Interpretations blind
Promised everlasting joy
Because of life sublime

To the ones who left behind
Many people stand with you today
To the ones who left behind
United we will stand and make them pay

The cowards could not face us eye to eye
A slow and painful death that they should die

Did it sooth their emptiness
And rid them of their pain
Will they try to take more lives?
All in their god's name

To the ones who left behind
Many people stand with you today
To the ones who left behind
United we will stand and make them pay

To the ones who left behind
Many people stand with you today
To the ones who left behind
United we will stand and make them pay

On September 11th, 2001, 3,047 people died during the terrorist attacks on New York, Washington DC and Pennsylvania.
More than 3,251 children lost a parent that day... and they say it was all in the name of their god.
