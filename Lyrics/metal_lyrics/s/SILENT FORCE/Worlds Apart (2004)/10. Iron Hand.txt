In the fields lush with gold
The sweat runneth over her body
Close her eyes as she wonders why she feels
Like she's rotting

She knows there's something better
He always slammed the door
And now the tears fall, they fall to the floor
He thinks he's something better
Than anyone can hate
Believes a man this could make

With an iron hand, he rules the land
A dark brutal fist that condemned her
The sands in time that rule the mind
How can I keep her safe, and alive

The legends tell of beloved sin
The altar of sacred hearts lost deep within
The sun will shine in her eyes
That's open wide, like a mirror

The strips are cut with leather
Deepens her wounds much more
The sadness so deep the tears never fall
Now forced to choose his future
Between the love and hate
He's still the man that's been holding her fate

With an iron hand, he rules the land
A dark brutal fist that condemned her
The sands in time that rule the mind
How can I keep her safe, and alive

Holy Father, I confess
For her love, which I profess
Holy Father, there's no sin
Without my throne, can I live?

If he were gone, and I would reign
No longer would we feel the pain
But how can I deceive the throne
That holds my flesh and bone

The tears rolling down her face
The blood is spilled from her body

There is a day that I will pray
That sends the hand embracing her his way
My thoughts cannot touch her, I fear for her life
The blood, the pain that's in his heart, I cannot tell a lie

With an iron hand, he rules the land
A dark brutal fist that condemned her
The sands in time that rule the mind
How can I keep her safe, and alive

With an iron hand, he rules the land
A dark brutal fist that condemned her
The sands in time that rule the mind
How can I keep her safe?
