Blinded with such fury
The clouds deceive the truth, judge and jury
Run for cover thinking of excuses
Wrath of God prevails upon the useless

With a prayer, a power works through lucid nights
The payment of, the payment of,
The chance we took to ride the storm

Now... we... ride the storm
Washing the blood from our hands
Now... we... ride the storm
Forced by the blood on our hands

A tempest he delivers
Did he leave us here, all us sinners?
Hearts are free and clear among the children
Tell me why they suffer, take us with them

With a prayer, a power works through lucid nights
The payment of, the payment of,
Divided where we took the storm

Now... we... ride the storm
Washing the blood from our hands
Now... we... ride the storm
Forced by the blood on our hands

God's destructive path that leads mankind to destroy
What mother Earth has given us to live in peace and joy

The time is now... we... ride the storm
Washing the blood from our hands
Now... we... ride the storm
Forced by the blood on our hands
