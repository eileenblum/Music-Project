I'm entertained by the tales from shadows
Shot of life in a blinding light
Whispering through the ghostly windows
Telling me that there is no fright

They are the ghosts of warriors and kings
Who faded in to darkness

Shadows know of forgotten words
And the treasures that the words reveal
Reveals the path to powers
All the wisdom is much too real

The kings tell of lost empires
The heroes talk of beasts they've slain
The warriors speak of battles
The memories that remain

No one, no one lives forever
Hope we'll die together
Justify yourself before the end
No one, no one lives forever
Know we'll die together
Justify yourself on Judgement Day before God

I wish to join them in the shadows
Hear the stories of the days gone by
Come alive each and every evening
Blackened, shaped by a moon in the sky

Up from the ground, they come from the past
The phantoms' lives are frightening

Shadows know of forgotten words
And the treasures that the words reveal
Reveals the path to powers
All the wisdom is much too real

The kings tell of lost empires
The heroes talk of beasts they've slain
The warriors speak of battles
The memories that remain

No one, no one lives forever
Hope we'll die together
Justify yourself before the end
No one, no one lives forever
Know we'll die together
Justify yourself on Judgement Day before God

No one, no one lives forever
Hope we'll die together
Justify yourself before the end
No one, no one lives forever
Know we'll die together
Justify yourself on Judgement Day before God

I know we'll die together
No one lives forever
