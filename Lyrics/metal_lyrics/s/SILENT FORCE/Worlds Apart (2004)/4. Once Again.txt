So nice to meet you, the pleasure's mine
Not very often I'm feeling left behind
Don't speak the language as many do
The sound takes me far

Fighting the silence of chosen sanctity
A choice I made alone
Am I misled by the selfish blinding need
My dreams all meet again
Once again
Once again

The star is burning but the flame is gone
I'll take a new look as I'm hanging on
As the world keeps turning, the faith is gone
The crimes of my age

Fighting the silence of chosen sanctity
A choice I made alone
Am I misled by the selfish blinding need
My dreams all meet again
Once again
Once again

Fighting the silence of chosen sanctity
A choice I made alone
Am I misled by the selfish blinding need
My dreams all meet again

Fighting the silence of chosen sanctity
A choice I made alone
Am I misled by the selfish blinding need
My dreams all meet again
Once again
Oh, once again
