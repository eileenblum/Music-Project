A little closer, just look in my eyes
Start noticing all of the signs
Such deep affliction, you want to know why?
I'm changing face all of the time

You'd throw away all that's dear and needing
I've been through times like this before
Walk in a circle that sweats with meaning
I've hit the wall and the door

A new line I've found I'm piercing
The needle slips to the floor
The rush I feel gives me mercy
The lifeless vein flows no more

There's a light at the end of the tunnel
Draws me in close to its eye
Holding on to the signs of reflection
Whisper the words as I die
Of a heart attack

A tightness stretching my chest as you speak
The words seem to sound like a mess
Why did you think you could change what I am?
Powers you think you possess

Don't throw away all that's close and meaning
We've been through times like this before
The pressure builds as it reeks of needing
The hate you scream kills me more

A new line I've found I'm piercing
The needle slips to the floor
The rush I feel gives me mercy
The lifeless vein flows no more

There's a light at the end of the tunnel
Draws me in close to its eye
Holding on to the signs of reflection
Whisper the words as I die
Of a heart attack
Of a heart attack

[Instrumental: Can-Can]

There's a light at the end of the tunnel
Draws me in close to its eye
Holding on to the signs of reflection
Whisper the words as I die
There's a light at the end of the tunnel
Draws me in close to its eye
Holding on to the signs of reflection
Whisper the words as I die
Of a heart attack
Of a heart attack
