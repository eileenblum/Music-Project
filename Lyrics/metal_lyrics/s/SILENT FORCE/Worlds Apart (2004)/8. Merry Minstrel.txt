The minstrel sat upon the edge
Of the brightly lighted stage
Every member of the court was there
From the beggar to Arch-Mage

They crowded in to hear the fabled
Magic of the man
And whispered as they waited for him
To stand up and strike up the band

Donned in sacred Moses sleeves
And sporting a leprechaun hat
He struck a chord upon his flute
They all stood and thanked him for that
Play on you merry minstrel, fly high

He looked upon their haggard faces
Carved with pain and grief
And when he laughed "It's not so bad"
They stared at him in disbelief

He knew he was a happier man
Than they ever would be
He took their pain into himself
As he set their spirits free

Donned in sacred Moses sleeves
And sporting a leprechaun hat
He struck a chord upon his flute
They all stood and thanked him for that
Play on you merry minstrel, fly high
Fly high, fly high

Merry minstrel, dance and sing
Living in the lonely world of smiles that you bring
Merry minstrel, dance and sing
Living in the lonely world of smiles that you bring
Merry minstrel, dance and sing
Living in the lonely world of smiles that you bring
