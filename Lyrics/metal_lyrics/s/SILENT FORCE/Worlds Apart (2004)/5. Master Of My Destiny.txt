The days of my indecision
Has brought me the ways of concern
Your message is building the walls around me

I'm trying my best not to fall
And trouble the people who care
Beside me, behind me they stand
The better the man, the better I am

Elevating my sense of control
Preparing my heart and my thoughts as I'm told
If I had the time to hear it all
I could fly away

Master of my destiny
Tell me how could I be bound to be
Master of my destiny
I'm not bound to feel what's set for me
Is it heaven or hell?

Many a time I have listened to you
Like the ones I let walk over me
The pressure keeps building up over and over

The times I've walked out that back door
With thoughts that I'll never return
What if I never return?
The lesser the man, the lesser I am

Elevating my sense of control
Preparing my heart and my thoughts as I'm told
If I had the time to hear it all
I could fly away

Master of my destiny
How could I be blind, so you can be
Master of my destiny
Am I bound to be what's set for me?
Master of my destiny
Master of my destiny
Is it heaven or hell?

All the years are not forgotten
His mind within is old
In a world that's far beyond his youth
Come the praises now, bestowed upon
The graces of a gentleman

Master of my destiny
Master of my destiny
Master of my destiny
Tell me how could I be bound to be
Master of my destiny
I'm not bound to feel what's set for me
Master of my destiny
Master of my destiny
Is is heaven or hell?
Heaven or hell?
