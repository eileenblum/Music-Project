Push me, push me, you gotta be my enemy
Push me, push me, you gotta think twice
It gets dangerous, it gets serious
Kick me, kick me, you wanna provoke me
Kick me, beat me, better think twice
It's getting dangerous when push comes to shove

Who wants to defeat, who wants to fall
That's why I'm still standing right now
There's no escape, there's no way out

I'm standing till the end
I was born to be a fighter
I'm standing till the end
I was born to be a fighter

I'm so mean, I'm so bad
Got no soul as a matter of fact
Got no mercy, got no sympathy
So you want my pride, you want my blood
You gotta let go, gotta give it a shot
Got no mercy when push comes to shove

Who wants to defeat, who wants to fall
That's why I'm still standing right now
There's no escape, there's no way out

I'm standing till the end
I was born to be a fighter
I'm standing till the end
I was born to be a fighter

Who wants to defeat, who wants to fall
That's why I'm still standing right now
There's no escape, there's no way out, right now

I'm standing till the end
I was born to be a fighter
I'm standing till the end
I was born to be a fighter
