You take things for granted
No compromise, no integrity
No understanding
No room for sympathy

You're half way there you gotta be cold as ice
You're half way there you gotta be cold as ice

Like the kiss of death
Cold as ice, don't look left or right
You gotta be bad, you gotta be mean
You gotta be dangerous like the kiss of death

No sense for justice
Your will, your way, your property
Don't care for nothing
Nothing but you - that's your philosophy
Your mind is twisted
For sure I know, you disagree
You're one great pretender, you're one of that kind

You don't  need to feel too much
Need no human touch
You need a heart of stone
Be cold as ice

Like the kiss of death
Cold as ice, don't look left or right
You gotta be bad, you gotta be mean
You gotta be dangerous like the kiss of death
Be cold as ice - like a fatal touch
Be cold as ice - need a heart of stone, need no soul
You gotta be dangerous like the kiss of death

Cold as ice, don't look left or right
You gotta be bad, you gotta be mean
You gotta be dangerous like the kiss of death
Cold as ice, don't look left or right
You gotta be bad, you gotta be mean
You gotta be dangerous like the kiss of death
Be cold as ice - like a fatal touch
Be cold as ice - need a heart of stone, need no soul
You gotta be dangerous like the kiss of death
