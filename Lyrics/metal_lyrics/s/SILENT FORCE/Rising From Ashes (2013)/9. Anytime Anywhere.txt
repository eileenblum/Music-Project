Another kiss goodbye and I'll be waiting
The days are passing by way too fast
From time to time I'm watching over you
And I will be there, 'cause you are my soul
You're my heart and soul

If you need somebody
I'll come running to you, anytime anywhere
If you need somebody
I will be there for you anytime, anywhere
I'll come running, anytime anywhere

Back on the street, back to my memories
Hearts beat, time's my only enemy
From time to time I"m watching over you
And I will be there, 'cause you are my soul
You're my heart and soul

If you need somebody
I'll come running to you, anytime anywhere
If you need somebody
I will be there for you anytime, anywhere
I'll come running, anytime anywhere

I wake up sometimes and I can see you smile
I feel alright, I can carry on until the next time
I will see you again

If you need somebody
I'll come running to you, anytime anywhere
If you need somebody
I will be there for you anytime, anywhere
If you need somebody
I'll come running to you, anytime anywhere
If you need somebody
I will be there for you anytime, anywhere
I"ll come running, anytime anywhere
