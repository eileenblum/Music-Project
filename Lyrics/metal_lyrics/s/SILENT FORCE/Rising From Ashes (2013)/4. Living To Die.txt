Johnny never learned to read or write
But he wouldn't tell
Though he was a close friend of mine
I didn't know him too well
Jimmy was a millionaire, he didn't need to tell
I saw him just from time to time, but this is over

But then in the end we are all the same
We're dust in the wind
Dust to dust and ashes to ashes

Living to die, raise to fall
Born to this world, to the unknown
The unpredictable
Living, but why - but why we die
Living, but why - but why we die

Julie was kind of ugly, not exactly smart
She never really had some money
But she was giving from her heart
Kelly was drop-dead gorgeous, she was one in a million
She was the darling of fortune, she was daddy's girl

But then in the end we are all the same
We're dust in the wind
Dust to dust and ashes to ashes

Living to die, raise to fall
Born to this world, to the unknown
The unpredictable
Living, but why - but why we die
Living, but why - but why we die

Living to die, raise to fall
Born to this world, to the unknown
The unpredictable
Living to die, raise to fall
Born to this world, to the unknown
The unpredictable
Living, but why - but why we die
Living, but why - but why we die
