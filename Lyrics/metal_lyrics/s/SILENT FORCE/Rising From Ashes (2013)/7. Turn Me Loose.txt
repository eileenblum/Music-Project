Sarah tell me why just can't you see
Sarah you put a spell on me
Sarah why don't you set me free
Sarah there's a hole inside of me
Sarah you got me on my knees
Sarah I need to find a remedy, but where to find it

Turn me loose if you don't need my love
If you don't need my love and affection
Turn me loose 'cause I can't handle a heart of stone
Your heart of stone, turn me loose

Sarah there's a need inside of me
Sarah I ask you please
Sarah please just let me be
Sarah need a shot of gasoline
Sarah one shot is all I need
Sarah I need to find a remedy, but where to find it

Turn me loose if you don't need my love
If you don't need my love and affection
Turn me loose 'cause I can't handle a heart of stone
Your heart of stone, turn me loose
Turn me loose if you don't need my love
If you don't need my love and affection
Turn me loose 'cause I can't handle a heart of stone
Your heart of stone

Turn me loose if you don't need my love
If you don't need my love and affection
Turn me loose 'cause I can't handle a heart of stone
Your heart of stone, turn me loose
Turn me loose if you don't need my love
If you don't need my love and affection
Turn me loose 'cause I can't handle a heart of stone
Your heart of stone, turn me loose
