Anger was rising, revenge will be mine
I use my one day's immortality
A storm will be raging for the rest of their time
They'll meet my anger, my interactability
Don't give a damn 'bout how they will end
They gave a damn about me
I'll take this mission into my hands
I will reward them for putting me down

Vengeance is my consolation
Vengeance is mine, bring them down

I might be a killer but I take the blame in this game
Wicked game
They started the thriller, I'm caught in their wicked game
Wicked game

As soon as I'm out, as soon I'm away
Justice will punish your cruelty
Ain't got a plan but you can be sure
I won't stop until they drop, that's guaranteed
Don't give a damn 'bout how they will end
They gave a damn about me
I'll take this mission into my hands
I will reward them for putting me down

Vengeance is my consolation
Vengeance is mine, bring them down

I might be a killer but I take the blame in this game
Wicked game
They started the thriller, I'm caught in their wicked game
Wicked game

Wicked game
I might be a killer but I take the blame in this game
Wicked game
They started the thriller, I'm caught in their wicked game
Wicked game
