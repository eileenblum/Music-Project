Different race, different line
We're all the same, we're so unlucky
I envy you, you envy me
What you achieve is what you make
But you gotta try

You're not alive when you don't touch the fire
Before you try to run you must learn to crawl
You must go down to rise up high and higher
You must learn to crawl before you run

You think that God has made a plan for you
Whatever happens is just fate
I tell you there is so much more in you
So please don't wait, that's a big mistake
But you gotta try

You're not alive when you don't touch the fire
Before you try to run you must learn to crawl
You must go down to rise up high and higher
You must learn to crawl before you run
You gotta learn to crawl before you run

You gotta crawl before you walk
You will be baptized by fire
You gotta win, you gotta lose
You will be baptized by fire
Become alive

Before you try to run you must learn to crawl
Before you try to run you must learn to crawl
You gotta learn to crawl
You gotta learn to run
You gotta learn to risk
You gotta learn to lose
You gotta learn to crawl
You gotta learn to run
You gotta learn to risk
You gotta learn to lose
