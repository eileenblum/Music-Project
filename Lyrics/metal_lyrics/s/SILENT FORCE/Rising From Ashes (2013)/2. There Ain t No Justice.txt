You're just another number
Nobody knows your name
You are invisible
Just a link in a chain
You're the gofer of the others
The one who's always there
You're never invited, nobody cares

You stand in the rain
You're left on the island
But you play the game
'Cause you're not born to win

Cry or just get over it
But there's no justice in the world
Cry or you just live with it
But there's no justice in the world

Born to win, born to lose, luck or destiny
Who knows the answer, well it ain't me
No one cares, no one sees
'Cause nobody wants to see
It doesn't matter, that's the way it is

You stand in the rain, you're left on the island
But you play the game, 'cause you're not born to win

Cry or just get over it
But there's no justice in the world
Cry or you just live with it
But there's no justice in the world

Cry or just get over it
But there's no justice in the world
Cry or you just live with it
But there's no justice in the world
