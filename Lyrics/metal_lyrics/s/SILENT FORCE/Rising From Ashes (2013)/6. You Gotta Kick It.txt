You look into the mirror
You look into this face
But you don't like what you see
Another sleepless night
You're fed up with your life
A little change is all you need
And so you're ready and willing
You're striving for a goal
You have the best intentions
But it's a struggle, a battle against your inner beast
It's hard to get a grip, it's hard to walk the line

You gotta kick it, rock it - it is your life, your life
You gotta kick it, rock it - it is your life, your life
Get up and spare me your excuses
You gotta kick it now

I heard it all before, can't count it anymore
Tomorrow will be the day
And your mind is quite made up, tomorrow is yesterday
But the best plans go astray
And so you're ready and willing, you're striving for a goal
You have the best intentions
But it's a struggle, a battle against your inner beast
But you always lose the battle

It's easy come, it's easy go
Thoughts easy come, thoughts easy go

You gotta kick it, rock it - it is your life, your life
You gotta kick it, rock it - it is your life, your life
Get up and spare me your excuses
You gotta kick it now
It is your life - it is your life

You gotta kick it, rock it - it is your life, your life
You gotta kick it, rock it - it is your life, your life
You gotta kick it, rock it - it is your life, your life
You gotta kick it, rock it - you gotta kick it now
