Life is full of changes
It's a rollercoaster ride
So many signs but you can't face them
It takes time to make things right
I never meant to hurt somebody's feelings
I wanna be a friend and not a foe
I know it's to find the right direction
I know it's hard to find the way

Back in the circle of trust
I know, you know
Sometimes you gotta learn to adjust
Hold on, stay tough
Try to stay in the circle of trust

You're sorry when it's too late
Another foolish mistake
You promise things get better
You just have to find the right way
I never meant to hurt somebody
I am a foolish soul who makes mistakes
It's hard to find the right direction
You gotta try to find the way

Back in the circle of trust
I know, you know
Sometimes you gotta learn to adjust
Hold on, stay tough
Try to stay in the circle of trust

One man one soul
Ain't enough for a lifetime
Be good be wise
You gotta walk the line

Back in the circle of trust
I know, you know
Sometimes you gotta learn to adjust
Hold on, stay tough
Try to stay in the circle of trust
Have a little trust........
