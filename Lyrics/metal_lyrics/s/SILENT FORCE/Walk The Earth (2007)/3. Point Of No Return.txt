When you're backed into a corner
When you feel that you are standing there alone
What's the point of even trying
When you know that you will never make it home

You've crossed the line you've really messed up
You took the risk you're in an unknown place
A wrong decision that went too far
You're feeling lost you're in disgrace

[Ref.]

You're at the point of no return (point of no return)
You're at the point of all you're suffering (point of all you're suffering)
You're at the point of no return

When you feel the pressure building
Weighing heavy on your mind and on your soul
That is when you need to think straight
It's the time when you should never lose control

When you finally wake up, you cry a tear that shakes up
The inner workings of your twisted mind
Is it someone who will hold you? Oh someone who will scold you
Someone who will talk sense into your life
When your dreams have failed you, oh the world moves on without you
Is there anyone that you can turn to now?
When you finally wake, up, you cry a tear that shakes up
The inner workings of your twisted mind

[Ref.]
