I find that all it takes,
A strike to start the fire,
I find that all it takes is just a strike to start the fire
I stand there mesmerized,
Right before his eyes
I stand there mesmerized by all the beauty and the death,
Beauty and the death

[Chorus:]
We are running through the fire
As it's lighting up the sky
We are running through the fire
Please don't ask me why

If I died within,
Within your arms
If I died within your arms
I don't think I would care
Oh, will I wait until,
Until the ash on earth
Will I wait until the ash on earth
Will crush my stare, my stare...

[Chorus]

Side by side we fight till the end
An alliance we have to defend
Side by side we fight till the end
An alliance we have to defend

[Chorus]
