Bleeding, you've opened up a wound
This is just what I wanted you to know, I've paid my dues
Leaving, the only way to know
If I can stand upon my feet, it's been so long ago

Free, this is my intention
I shout, from the highest mountain

My independence day, this is the only way
I will never hide again
All my dreams were through
You know this isn't about you
I will never run and hide again

Breathing, there's something in the air
I'd blame it on the rain it was someone else's affair
Believe me, when I say it's getting old
The desperate way you look at me, you look into my soul
I want you to know, I've nothing to show
When a beauty was a mistress I'm a slave deep down below

Free, this is my intention
I shout, from the highest mountain
