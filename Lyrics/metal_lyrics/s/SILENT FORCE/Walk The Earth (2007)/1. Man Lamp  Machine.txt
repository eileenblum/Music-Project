When I'm driving down the road
I want to feel the speed
I push my machine to the max,
This is what I need
My fingers gripping, grip so tight,
My foot is to the floor
My blood is racing through my veins,
This is my reward

Test my fate by living on the edge (on the edge)
And if I die I die just like so many others

[Chorus]
Man and machine -
I can't hide my need for speed, I'm the man
Man and machine -
And I'll try fast as can be

My heart is beating with such might
I feel it might explode
Throwing caution to the wind
It flattens down the road
The sirens screaming, scream so loud,
I laugh and sing along
The engine makes a noise so sweet,
As sweet as any sound

I feel my hair is standing on its edge (on its edge)
I lose control just around the bend

[Chorus]

Tires squealing, ripping metal,
It's over in seconds,
It was so orchestral
My body now is beaten and battered,
As fast as it could be
Was all that had mattered

[Solo]

Man and machine -
I can't hide my need for speed, I'm the man
Man and machine -
If I die don't cry for me, I'm the man
Man and machine -
Oh, we're as one, man and machine

Man and machine...
