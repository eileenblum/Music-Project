I stand at the edge of myself and my health
The gravity of the situation shows itself
I can never stay focused the voice deep inside
It's screaming to me
I have not failed to run and hide

Goodbye to you, goodbye my ghost
(Goodbye to you my ghost)
Goodbye to you, goodbye my ghost
(Goodbye to you my ghost)

Have you every felt crazy
Like someone you didn't know?
Now that you're questioning yourself down to the bones
Overwhelmed by the life we lead and demons we have shown

As I sit and stare, it's a statement of my mind
Release me, as I close my eyes
I'm drifting through the time
I can see you breath as I can feel your death

The memory of you will fade away
I hope forever
