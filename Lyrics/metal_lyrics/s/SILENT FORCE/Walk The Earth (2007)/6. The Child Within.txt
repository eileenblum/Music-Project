Always searching for something, always searching for clues
Always searching for something else like the child that I out grew

I'm afraid to find, I never will return
I, I'll hope I'll see, just how it used to be

I wish for the past to be there for me like it was

Searching for the child within
A moment in time
Searching for the child within
A child with nothing to hide

All the visions my mind could see
Did they ever come true?
All the visions my mind created, was it something I out grew?
