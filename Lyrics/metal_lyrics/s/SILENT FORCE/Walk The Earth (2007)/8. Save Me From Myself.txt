I'm talking to myself at times the words aren't clear
Another voice will say to me what I wish not to fear
That's why I try to make believe, the future no mistakes
The edge of burning wasted fire, the warmth there is no trace

How did it finally come to this?
How did I wish us figure of shadows?
I've opened the door to show a secret deep within

Someone save me from myself
Someone save me from the darkness that's within
Someone save me from myself
And with the darkness so profound, will I survive?

This is the fight I wish would end
I know it's up to me
And finally I would be content
The changes no more I would see
This is the man that I would be
Forever till the end
Why am I digging in so deep?
Will I ever be my own friend?

Why did it finally come to this?
Why did I wish us figure of shadows?
I've opened the door to show a secret deep within

Someone save me from myself
Someone save me from the darkness that's within
Someone save me from myself
And with the darkness so profound, will I survive?

I feel my days are numbers
It is a number you can't change
When is my day of reckoning?
You have to wait like all the rest
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
You are the one they always blame
How can I save my dignity?
Someone to save me from myself

Someone save me from myself
Someone save me from the darkness that's within
Someone save me from myself
And with the darkness so profound, will I survive?

Will I survive?
