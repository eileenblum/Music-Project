He sees the two in the corner, not easy to explain 
What the other is thinking, you know it's always in vein 

Don't you know that when the other wrong 
Someone always tells them so 

And that it doesn't matter 
What they're trying to say 

The blind leading the blind 
No wonder nothing else gets done 
They're in each other's way 

They always seem to be leaders a political mess 
When all the votes have been counted 
Oh, there's one that's thumping his chest 

Don't you know the winner walks away 
The loser somehow gets to play 

The blind leading the blind 
No wonder nothing else gets done 
They're in each other's way 
The blind leading the blind 
It's a reason there's so many dead 
They're dying everyday 

We all stand here, opinions in our minds 
They're tying up our hands and cover up our eyes 
We shake our heads dismayed when they play that song 
Then they drape the flag upon the caskets when they fall 

It's no wonder nothing else gets done 
They're in each other's 
In each other's way!
