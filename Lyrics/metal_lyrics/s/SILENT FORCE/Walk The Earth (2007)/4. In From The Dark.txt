A place there was light
A place that was free from the dark
A place that would show; all that was hidden in time
An idea so real an idea of what to say
Idea thats placing us all in the path from which we are stray

[PRE CHORUS]
We cannot be what we are with no one to tell us how
We cannot be what we are with no one to tell us where we are.
Oh tell us where we are

[CHORUS]
In from the dark in from the cold outside in from the dark ill step into the light
In from the dark!

[VERSE]
A new day is breaking
The hazing that lives on the street
This is my chance to end a chance to end all the tears that I weep
Have I forgotten? forgotten to tell it again
As I was watching myself from the mirror of defeat I got lost in the head

[PRE CHORUS]
In from the dark in from the cold outside in from the dark ill step into the light
In from the dark!

[CHORUS]
In from the dark in from the cold outside
In from the dark I'll step into the light
In from the dark!

[SOLO]

[CHORUS]
In from the dark in from the cold outside
In from the dark I'll step into the light

In from the dark in from the cold outside
In from the dark I'll step into the light

In from the dark
(in from dark!)
In from the cold outside
(in from the cold!)
In from the dark I'll step into the light
(step into the light, into the light!)
