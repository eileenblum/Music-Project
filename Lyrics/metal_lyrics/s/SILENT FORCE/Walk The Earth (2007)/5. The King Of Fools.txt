It happens to the best,
This he cannot change
But most of all was
His intentions weren't that strange
He says he's only human, no one ever knows
It's what he means to say
At night before he starts the show

He can't change his past, no one ever can
Tomorrow no one knows his name
He thinks he is the man

[Chorus:]
He's the king of fools
The master of one
As he stands there all alone
He's the king of fools
The master of one
He's not a man of virtue,
He's not a man at all

He sets a bad example
Does he think he's right?
Trying to escape his past
He isn't worth the fight
The devil made him do it!
This is what he says
Always doing stupid things
Is how he makes his way

He can't change his past, no one ever can
Tomorrow no one knows his name
He thinks he is the man

[Chorus]

He can't wait, he's in a fog
His mind is almost gone, is he afraid?
Oh, does he know just what it is that's wrong

[Chorus]
