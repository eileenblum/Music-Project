[Beyrodt / Cooper]

He awakes, lying on a table
Bright lights, burning my eyes
Staring face, of a man in a dark cloud
Informing me of the ever profound

I asked, the question
His voice confirms
What happened before ?

Who knows, who lies
Who knows that I am still alive ?

Two to sin, and one to die
This is where the problem lies
The cycle of the hands,
On the clock will circle two more times
( Despite a plea of grand )

New Experiment
Playing God, with a twist of fate
New Experiment,
It's all in the new experiment
Cheated into to a certain fate

The ones who have past
Will be brought back in
Only to be sent,
Back up the hill again
For the last time,
It appears to be sure
Regardless of the scene
Nothing is pure,

I asked, the question,
Am I the first one ?
Or were there ones before ?
They told me, no worries,
I'm the one who opened up the door ?

One to die and two sin
This is where it all begins,
Spinning thoughts
That is in my head,
Many things are left unsaid,

New Experiment
Playing God, with a twist of fate
New Experiment,
It's all in the new experiment
Cheated into to a certain fate
