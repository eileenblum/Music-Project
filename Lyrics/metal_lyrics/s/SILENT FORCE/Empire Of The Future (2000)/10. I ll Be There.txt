[Beyrodt / Cooper / Werno]

If I could see this through,
so much to say,
Here in a place I don't know
If I'll get away,

I walk a line today,
Wide, but blind
You know it was somewhat,
of my design

In my mind, I'll be there
Comes a time,
a time for us to share
In my mind, I'll be there
comes a time,
a time for us to share
a time for us to share
someday

How can I leave you this way,
a place so alone,
If I could see you,
there's a world unknown,

If my heart says,
watch the time,
You know it brings to mind
a certain rhyme,
All alone today, I 
I wipe the tear,
think of the world away
our world so near,

In my mind, I'll be there
Comes a time,
a time for us to share
In my mind, I'll be there
comes a time,
a time for us to share
a time for us to share
someday
