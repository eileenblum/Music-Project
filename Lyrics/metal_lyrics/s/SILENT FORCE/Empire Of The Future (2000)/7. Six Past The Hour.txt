[Beyrodt / Bormann / Cooper]

Walk through the dark
I'm finding no simple way out,
A way had appeared
no time for a scream or a shout,
Here is my shadow
it seems, who didn't believe
I've given up looking 
look for the place of reprieve,

Watching through the glass
I see the thoughts will bring me to :

Six past the hour
The bells they did ring
They chime on Six past the hour 
The thoughts they would bring,
They will bring me
The point of no return, return, return

Walk in the door
I see the flickering flame
A look in his eyes
Told me he's thinking the same
Seconds before it seems
A lifetime had passed

Watching through the glass
I see the pane it has to see

Six past the hour
The bells they did ring
They chime on Six past the hour 
The thoughts they would bring,
They will bring me
The point of no return, return, return

He'll see the blood
In his eyes as he nears
Seconds will pass
as he trembles with fear

Six past the hour
The bells they did ring
They chime on Six past the hour 
The thoughts they would bring,
They will bring me
The point of no return, return, return
