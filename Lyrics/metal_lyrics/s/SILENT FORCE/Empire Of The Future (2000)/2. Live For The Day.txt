[Beyrodt / Cooper]

Grant a wish that I can come and claim
Simple reasons that are not hard to obtain,
Thinking back on what I have not done (What little to show)

There was a time when I know I was lost
Could it be here again at every cost
If they had walked beside all of these men
No way no innocence will stand in the end,

Facing the fine line of life, Live for the day
Looking for a break in the time of the one,
I'll take on, Live for the day,

Through the doors I'll walk the longest aisle,
Kneel before the man, the man who reconciles
Offense against the one who takes my place (How far can I go?)

There was a time, when I looked far ahead
Could it be here this day or am I mislead?
If they had walked in the shoes of all the men
There is no innocence to grab in the end

Facing the fine line of life, Live for the day
Looking for a break in the time of the one,
I'll take on, Live for the day,

Live today, live today, standing in the light
undescribed, undescribed, it is all so undescribed
Innocence, innocence, where is all the the innocence

Standing in the light of daytime
Stand in the light of day (repeated)

Facing the fine line of life, Live for the day
Looking for a break in the time of the one,
I'll take on, Live for the day,
