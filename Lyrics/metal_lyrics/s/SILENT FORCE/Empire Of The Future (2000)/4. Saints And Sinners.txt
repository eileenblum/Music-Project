[Beyrodt / Cooper]

Storming in they rush in through the door
(They knew I was there)
Take me in, in silence will be sworn (Should I be there)?
Charges brought against mankind, was it everyone?
That played a game with lives not theirs
Now it's all been done before

It's the eyes that make the soul worth living
The verdict was laid with no control, if you believe

Saints and sinners, who is different?
Saints and sinners who's the gifted?
God is our judge and jury my friend
It is his choice who makes it in
Saints and sinners who is different?
God is our judge and jury to all
Heaven awaits for those who are called

They found me guilty in the first degree (Sent to death row)
Lay my face within the hands of my priest (Same one did show)
Tears roll down my cheeks, I think, of the life unlived
Extinction now becomes my fate even when he lives again,

It's the eyes that make the soul worth living
The verdict was laid with no control, if you believe

Saints and sinners, who is different?
Saints and sinners who's the gifted?
God is our judge and jury my friend
It is his choice who makes it in
Saints and sinners who is different?
God is our judge and jury to all
Heaven awaits for those who are called

Living and breathing
and seeing and praying
For it is the very last time
There is no way escaping
Stand at the firing line

Saints and sinners, who is different?
Saints and sinners who's the gifted?
God is our judge and jury my friend
It is his choice who makes it in
Saints and sinners who is different?
God is our judge and jury to all
Heaven awaits for those who are called
