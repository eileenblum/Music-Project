[Beyrodt / Cooper]

Did you see the light?
Pounding forces of the night
I don't want to die
There is no reason why

Trust and I'll take the pain
someone must show me now
Trust and I'll take the pain
Someone must show me now

Don't Ask Me Tell Me Why

Ascend the mountain as a whole
They shoot with no control
Our leader is shook with fear
No reason why we're here

Caught in mid breath
the bullet took my heart out
I heard the sound so clear
I've seen the face
Of the man who took my life
There was a look of fear
On his Face

Trust and I'll take the pain
someone must show me now
Trust and I'll take the pain
Someone must show me now

Don't Ask Me Tell Me Why
