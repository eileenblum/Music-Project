[Beyrodt / Cooper / Hilgers]

Escape, confines run into night
Tense whispers from nearby 
A life lost in my eyes
Drak image of a smile

Fraying at the edges in my mind
Reflections in the mirror

One time so I can feel it again,
The touch as my angel 
is mending my wings
One time so I can feel it again
Mending my broken wings

Changes, the meadow green to brown
Bare becomes the ground
As if this world was void
of all my love unvoiced

Playing at the borders
trapped in time
reflections disappearing

One time so I can feel it again,
The touch as my angel 
is mending my wings
One time so I can feel it again
Mending my broken wings

I wonder if they're missing me
can it be ignored ?
Take my hand please lift me up
This is my reward

Cannot take the blame
Cannot cary shame

One time so I can feel it again,
The touch as my angel 
is mending my wings
One time so I can feel it again
Mending my broken wings
