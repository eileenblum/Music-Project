From a distant shadow 
I stepped out to the light
Amazed by shapes before me
Tried with all my might 
Focus on whets happening
I think I might be dead
Is this what I've wanted
I had a choice instead,

Why is this fascination so real?
Where had it all began
When was the first time that I thought I could feel?
I would give a damn

Hear me calling
Come and take me there
See me falling
Take my life, it's fair

Journey of a lifetime
To die and so its said
Tell me why it's amazing
Have I been mislead?

I've focused on the ending
Always what's ahead?
For seconds I am thinking
Moments lift to dread

Since this fascination is real
Blinded by my plan
No attention to the people who feel
They all give a damn
