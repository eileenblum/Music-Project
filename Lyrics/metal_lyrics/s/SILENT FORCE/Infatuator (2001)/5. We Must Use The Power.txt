In the mouths of Hungry children
Still they have hope in thier minds
Whispering amongst the others
What is left to leave behind
We can feel, like we have been blessed
Lucky to have roofs over our heads 
Now, I have seen a light
Now, Let us do what's right,...

We must use our power
We all have inside
We must use the power
Help man to survive
We must use the power
This is something we must do
We must use the power
Someday it might be you
Listen to your heart, to your heart

Ever wonder what will happen
If you would lose, what you have
Will the people come to help you
Or leave you stranded with no plan
That is when you'll find out who true friends are
Thier the ones who'll be there when you're down

Now, I have seen a light
Now, Let us do what's right,...

We must use our power
We all have inside
We must use the power
Help man to survive
We must use the power
This is something we must do
We must use the power
Someday it might be you
Listen to your heart, to your hear
