One night I thought I saw him walk outside my window
But I know It's in my head
Deepest recess of a mind that warped with memories
Likes to keep things left unsaid 
If I ask of you
Try and help me see what's true
I'll Close the book and walk away 

Last time I saw him, he was walking out the door 
Always think he will return
I am not the only one, I know there is much more
Believe that someday we will see him

When it happens, you wish if there was some more time
Many words you should have said
Breath the breaths I take, I feel that I commit crimes
Because it should have been me dead

And if I ask of you? Tell me if you think its true
The answer might not just be wrong 

Last time I saw him, he was walking out the door 
Always think he will return
I am not the only one, I know there is much more
Believe that someday we will see him
