Chaos is raining tonight 
They feel a fight out in the cold
Abused, and not know the truth
Is he the one that will destroy you? 
Take-you down-and cut-you with-his knife
The blood flows
Fight-him back-one way-you can survive
Your fate awaits
Flesh-will rip-and bones-will crush tonight
The blood flows
Crowds-will scream-and if-you win this fight

You know, He does not care about you
And many lives he'll change
He'll change
Here in the hands of the Blade

The masses, they're calling him Blade
Cause of the vicious ways he kills
Waits for the gate to explode
Thirsting for victim's blood spills over

Take-you down-and cut-you with-his knife
The blood flows
Fight-him back-one way-you can survive
Your fate awaits
Flesh-will rip-and bones-will crush tonight
The blood flows
Crowds-will scream-and if-you win this fight

He does not care about you
And many lives he'll change
He'll change
Here in the hands of the blade

Deep in the night, where a blind man can see
The blade sitting alone, playing his memories
