Beyond the stars - endless cosmic void
Incantations - seek the ancient race

Down below
Within the bowels of the earth
Way up high
Lurking in the darkened sky

A constant wail beneath the shattered world
Lures the sleeping evil, lifeless dreams the ancient one
In his cold wet tomb, where mankind will find its doom

Ruins underneath the waves
Once a home to greater life
Forgotten names, encrypted rite
Unspeakable and vile

Levitation into a higher life
When all man's hopes will die
Eerie descending tonight
Dimensions now open wide

A silent whisper from
Blackest ocean depths
The dreamless one wails
From his cyclopian realm
Demon of the deep!
Lay to rest the human spawn!

"Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn!"
Unleashing tentacle embrace
Feast on the human sacrifice!
