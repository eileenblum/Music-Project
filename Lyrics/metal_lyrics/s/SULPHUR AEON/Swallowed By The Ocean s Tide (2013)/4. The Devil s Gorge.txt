Shun the swamp, shun the dark
Don't walk astray
The friar's lanterns flickering lights
Will lead you off your way

The souls of the departed
At night they haunt the moor
Wail like wraiths in the woods
Sepulchral chant obscure

The devil's gorge, fathomless black pit
The devil's gorge, sanctum God forbid

Mires of no life, dwellers with no soul
Tumble through the white dead trees
Towards the baneful hole

Morass of lurking horrors
Place that must not be
Cries of anguish echo
Horrors unforeseen

The devil's gorge, fathomless black pit
The devil's gorge, sanctum God forbid

The gaping orifice reveals the pathway to the womb
Stare into the abyss and it gazes into you

Skin as pale as moonlight
Teeth as sharp as diamond shards
Creatures from beyond
Blackest minds and vilest hearts

Shuddering you turn away
Too late to close your eyes
A glimpse into sheer direness
Unleash your own demise

The devil's gorge, fathomless black pit
The devil's gorge, sanctum God forbid
