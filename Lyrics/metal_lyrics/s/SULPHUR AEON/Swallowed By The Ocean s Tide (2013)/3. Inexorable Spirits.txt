Seven they are, unknown to man
Neither heaven knows nor earth
In darkness they lurk beyond
And beneath dimension's gates

They are falling like rain
Rising like smoke from the ground
Conquering the towers
And strongholds of mankind
Still unknown to man and god
Yet trampling their cities to dust

Consummate the rites
Foundations of chaos align
Seven impure spirits rise

Idra, intruding through their heads
Namtar, intruding through their hearts
Utuk, intruding through their brows
Alal, intruding through their chests

They are falling like rain
Rising like smoke from the ground
Conquering the towers
And strongholds of mankind
Still unknown to man and god
Yet trampling their cities to dust

Inexorable spirits of doom

They are falling like rain
Rising like smoke from the ground
Conquering the towers
And strongholds of mankind
Still unknown to man and god
Yet trampling their cities to dust

Gigim, grasping through their bowels
Telal, taking their hands
Uruku, ghosts of the dead, drinking their blood
