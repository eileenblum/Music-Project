Setting the pitchblack sails
Onward into the unknown
Across the ocean of souls
Where creeping chaos dwells
To forbidden shores
I set my course
Under a starless sky

As the clouds disperse
Unveiling the unexpressible
Evocation of the ancients
The sea shall be my altar
I call thy names
Liberate me from sanity

Where black ships sail
Eerie sound the waves
Voices from the deep
Guide me into the abyss

With the black ships I will sail
On the darkest of all paths
The oceans shall consume my soul
As creeping chaos I'll be reborn
Traveler between the worlds
Of dream and death forever more

Where black ships sail
Eerie sound the waves
Voices from the deep
Long forgotten songs
As if drowning sirens call
