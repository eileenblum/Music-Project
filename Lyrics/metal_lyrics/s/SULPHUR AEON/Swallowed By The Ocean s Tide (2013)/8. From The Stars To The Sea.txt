cephalopodian race
enslaving amorphous life
kozmik konquerors
from the stars to the sea

beyond the frontiers of space
wormholes engorging time
secrets entombed beneath the stars
locked in dimensions of dread

cephalopodian race
enslaved amorphous life
kozmik konquerors
from the stars to the sea

within the minds of the unsane
out of the mouths of the undead
sailing the atmospheric waves
to conquer silurian soil

tentacles to slay the gods
tentacles to rule them all

tyrants from the infinite coldness of space
tyrants from the abyss of the deepest sea

tentacles to rise again
tentacles to build HIS realm
tentacles to rise again

cephalopodian race
enslaved amorphous life
kozmik konquerors
from the stars to the sea

sunken into ancient depths
silently ruling the palaeozoic sea
mollusced spawn from above
dreaming down in the deep
