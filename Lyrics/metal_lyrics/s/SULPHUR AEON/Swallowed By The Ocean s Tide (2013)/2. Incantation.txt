From the stars above
From the sea below

I am calling upon thee
The ones who were before
The ones who will rise once more

Hear me, guardian of the gate
Teeming being Yog Sototh
Let me know his time to rise

Spawn of Yuggoth, emerge from cosmos
Abhorrent beings from the stars
Bearing aeons of sulphur and chaos
Feasting on earth, leaving scars

Hear me, fearless one, pharaoh of black
I summon thy name: Nyarlathotep
Crawling chaos emerging

Soul of old ones, the ultimate gods
Allegory and symbols of chaos
Cosmic knowledge implanted in our hearts
Writhing in death, evolving all wars

Starspawn awake, builder of his shrine
His nautic temple's architects
Drown our future, this planet is thine
Crush humankind like insects

Hear me, oh titan of the sea
Great Cthulhu, dreamer in the deep
Rise from thine aqueous grave

Cthulhu rising from R'lyeh
Marking the return of the great old ones
