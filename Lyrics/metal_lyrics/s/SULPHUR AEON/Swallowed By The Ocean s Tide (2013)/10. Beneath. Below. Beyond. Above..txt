no spawn so fierce as of those who sleeo
deep withing their watery resting place
no weapon would harm their skin
no man shall be left on what has once been theirs

the trial of time congregates in ancient spores
wisdom of the ages, forgotten and entombed

not to be witnessed by any mortal's eye
chaos drips from every step of the time

beneath. below. beyond. above.
the fusion of dimensions ignites
when sulphur rapes the atmosphere
our crimes resound in bleeding skies

caressed by fouling arms
aroused by tentacle kiss
bestowed upon mankind
the inheritance of those
who lurk beyond the doors
of space and time

not to be witnessed by any mortal's eye
chaos drips from every step of time

beneath. below. beyond. above.
the fusion of dimensions ignites
when sulphur rapes the atmosphere
our crimes resound in bleeding skies

ascending from the sea
descending from the sky
arranging the lines of chaos
levitating - coming adrift from beyond

beheath. below. beyond. above.
the fusion of dimensions ignites
when sulphur rapes the atmosphere
our crimes resound in bleeding skies

chaos, destruction
seizing mankind

evil, disturbance
rising up high
