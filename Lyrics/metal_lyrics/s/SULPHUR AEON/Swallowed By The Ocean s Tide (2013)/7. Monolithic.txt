Buried under a shroud of ice
In undead sleep they dwell
Waiting for their time to rise
Unseen, untouched, unclean

Monolithic ascension, strongholds of the unknown
Impaling the sky
Nameless architecture, monuments in black
From the deepest of all depths

Frozen temples, defying the claws of time
Cryptic choirs
Echoing winds, in unearthly tongues
Again they shall be

The stench of death and decay
Arousing their hunger
Emerging from their icy tomb
By night they come...

Buried under a shroud of ice
In undead sleep they dwell

Those who were before
Subterranean creatures
Crawling through the shadows
From unlight they arise...
Once again... they will reign
In Inferno
