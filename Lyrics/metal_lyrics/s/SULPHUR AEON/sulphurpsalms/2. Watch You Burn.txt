Emerging from the shadows
Like a burning swarm
A radiant pulsating force
Like a shrapnel blast
Crushing everyone and everything
Whatever'll dare to stand in our way

We - will bow to no one
We - came to dominate
Once unleashed
Feast upon your fall
We - will bow to no one
We - came to dominate
Once unleashed
We'll watch you burn

Out of smuldering ruins
Like a stream of lava
Deepest shade ov black
Like the cleansing fire
Spreading our deadly seed
Watch you burn - watch you bleed

From the ashes we will rise
Stronger than before
Sowing the seeds of your downfall
Spitting in the face of your hypocrisy

We - will bow to no one
We - came to dominate
Once unleashed
Feast upon your fall

If you're illuminated - we are conflagration
No retreat, no surrender!
We are the legion that pounds you into dust
