Legion we are
Touched by the hoof ov Goat
Legion I am
I am the countergod

Legion in my veins - a serpent my spine
Poisoned fangs pierced my skin
Kissed the lips of madness
Swallowed by a magma ocean
Burning all - fleshmade sin
I march on the Ikaroian path
As feathers burn
Impaled by redemption scent

Legion we are
Touched by the hoof ov Goat
Legion I am
I am the countergod

Vermin in my entrails - a landmine my heart
A sinful voice - breathing seductively
Mesmerized by forbidden fruits
Downward spiral stream
Into unhallowed ground
Blackest Promethean ascension
Born reverse
Illuminated by soular eclipse

Come forth - my demons!
Come forth - once again!
Arise - for you are my salvation
...for I will sin again
Come forth - my weakness!
Come forth - my end!
Arise - stronger thou art
...'cause you're my only release!

Touched by the hoof ov Goat
Legion I am
I am the countergod

Legion we are
Touched by the hoof ov Goat
Legion I am
I am the countergod
