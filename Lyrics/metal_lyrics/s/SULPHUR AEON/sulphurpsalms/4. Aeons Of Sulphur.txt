Awaiting the void
The space of nothing
Aspiring - the ancient chaos
Breathing, slumbering obscure

An immortal strive to revive what dwells beneath
A sigh of grief to greet the ancients in the deep

From astral tombs - they rise
From starless skies - they descend

I whisper their names so that they may hear
I expose my body so that they may see
I call forth their names so that they may speak

In seas of lava we shall perish
To be reborn .. in aeons of sulphur
In oceans of blood we shall drown
To die again .. in aeons of sulphur

A pounding impulse to suffocate life
Vital minds collapse in an urge to kill
Reversed evolution pulsating through their veins
Consumed by darkness - Immortal ancient beast
