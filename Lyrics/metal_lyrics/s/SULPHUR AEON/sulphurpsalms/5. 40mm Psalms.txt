No one sees with sewn up eyes
Born dead and buried alive
Wormlike their crawling
Just feeding the dogs
Just feeding the gods

Swarm of flies - swarm of lies
On a decomposing planet

Bloodshed - extinction
And the worst is yet to come
Downfall of the golden age
And the worst is yet to come...
40mm psalms!

Bloodred fields of devastation
WAR - VERBUM DIMISSUM
CUSTODIAT ARCANUM

Fallen and broken - we all shall drown
Fallen and broken - in this stinking pit

How does it feel
To cut your own throat?
AC-130s approaching - the face of god
40mm psalms - the saviour has returned!

No one sees with sewn up eyes
Born dead and buried alive
Wormlike their crawling
Just feeding the dogs
Just feeding the gods

Torn out spines
Bullet hole modification
Scattered limbs
The ultimate abomination
Falling and crawling
Annihilation divine
This is the answer to all your prayers!
