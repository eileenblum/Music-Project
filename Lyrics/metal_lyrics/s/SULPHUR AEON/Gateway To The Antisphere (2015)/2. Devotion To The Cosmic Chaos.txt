Enshrined within endless oceans of sand
Memories are vivid beneath desert soil
Ancient realms in the crypts down below

Kitab al azif, scriptures of blasphemy!

Neither time nor man dares to explore
Encoffination in glass and golden wood
Eternal hybernation in luminous crypts

Devotion to the cosmic chaos
In deathless prayer the elder gods
Devoured lies the gateway
Portal to the nameless depths

Thus spoke Alhazred:
Profanate their shrines!
Unbind the obscure!
Enlighten the insane!

Ageless decay breathes forward
The pestilent winds

Virulent visions tear this weak soul apart 
Viciously reaping the minds of the mad 
Aeons bleed chaos from the pores of egypt
