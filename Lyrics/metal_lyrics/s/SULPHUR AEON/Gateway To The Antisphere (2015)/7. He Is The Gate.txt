Oh yog-sothoth - thou act the gate
Oh yog-sothoth - unite once again with your kin

Amidst the thrall of cosmic darkness
Malicious emission of this universe
Blasphemy - mockery of life and death
Heir to azathoth, the mad and blind

Descending from the nothingness
The black void that surrounds us

Descendant of chaos
That thrives among the stars
For he is the gate!
A sigil without name
A foundation of wrath
For he is the gate!
Alas! Let it be heard
Throughout the worlds
For he is the gate!

Space and time - Frontiers to be taken
In a whirling, tumbling universe
Slumbering gods shall awaken
As cosmic seed disperse...

Yog-sothoth!
Y'ai 'ng'ngath - yog-sothoth
H'ee-l'geb - f'ai throdog
Uaaah!

Iridescent perversion, breeding slime
Nuclear abhorrence, tentacles entwine
Bringing forth the sunless dawn
Awakening the slumbering spawn

For he is the gate!

Descendant of chaos
That thrives among the stars
For he is the gate!
A sigil without name
A foundation of wrath
For he is the gate!
Alas! Let it be heard
Throughout the worlds
For he is the gate
