Enlightment lies beyond the horizon
Heading north, into the cold dead waste
Seeking the ones akin to the gods
Riding the waves to obsidian shores

Above the desolate plateau of leng
Wings of leather guide an abhorrent ride
In the glare of the moon's pale flame
The shantak haunts the dismal night

Past nameless mysterious isles
Not dared to be spoken of
Vile howels crack the calm of the night
Far north, into the darkness

Freezing cold, inquanok in sight

Above the desolate plateau of leng
Wings of leather guide an abhorrent ride
In the glare of the moon's pale flame
The shantak haunts the dismal night

In robes of silk the masked priest strides
His wisdom tells of lunar beasts
Of horns and hooves concealed from sight
And night gaunts their royal feast

Under the dome, into the vaults of zin
As sacrifice to the gift of death and escape
In pitch-black darkness, eyes forbidding sight
Abadon the haunting ruins of ancient sarkomand

Summoning calls, return to the isle
ghoulish uproar and moonbeats collide

Above the desolate plateau of leng
Faceless demons on membrane-winged flight
In the glare of the moon's pale flame
The night guants impale the silent skies

Onwards... towards kadath!
Onwards... towards kadath!
... towards kadath!
