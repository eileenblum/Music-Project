Aeonborn entities thrusting
Through dimensional cervixes
Conceiving the blighting children
Of the cosmic throne

Within the chaoswomb
The nucleus of the universe

Wafting in galactic fog
Swathed in celestail dust
Azathoth - cosmic thrall
Cthulhu - Abysshex

Azathoth - cosmic thrall
Cthulhu - Abysshex

As they descend from the stars
Azathoth demands
as they ascend from the sea
Cthulhu commands

Fallen stars speak of their children
Plunging into antediluvian seas
With the effulgence of aeons
Into the tenebrous bowels of earth

Wafting in galactic fog
Swathed in celestial dust
Azathoth - cosmic thrall
Cthulhu - Abysshex

As they descend from the stars
Azathoth demands
As they ascend from the sea
Cthulhu commands

Ominous chimes herald their coming
Somitogenesis of the outer gods
Strange ululation preceed their birth
Communion of the great old ones

Pestilential spawn from galaxies afar
Chaospawn descends from the stars
Breeding in the void
As chaospawn descends...
