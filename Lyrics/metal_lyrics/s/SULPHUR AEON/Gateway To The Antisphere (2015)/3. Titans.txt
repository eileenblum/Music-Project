...Arising like titans
Cyclopean walls
Liquid mountains
Tower upon the surface

Ascending from below
Where all light is extinct
Down in the caverns
In grottos and crypts

Darkness dwells
In the oceanic depths
Swarming with life
From the coldness of space

Titans rise
Harrowing sight
Titans rise
Inversion of light

Roaring unearthly sequence
Heralding HIS return
Breaking through the vacuum
Drowning our world

As old gods reclaim their throne
Swallowing us all

Discovered be forgotten cites
Horrors undisclosed to man
Scolding summonings at night
Titans conjured to rise again

Fathomless waters
Abyss bears abyss
The sleeper awakens
Exhaling his wrath

Titans rise
Harrowing sight
Titans rise
Inversion of light

Titans rise
Crescendo of power

Divulged be their names
So that they may elevate...
