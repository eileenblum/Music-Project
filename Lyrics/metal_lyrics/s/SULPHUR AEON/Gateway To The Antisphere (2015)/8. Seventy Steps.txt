Seventy steps, downward the spiral
Into the fiery crypts, dreamlands ahead
Seven hundred steps, further down
to the gates of deeper slumber

Seek knowledge in the forests
Find answers among fur and claws
Seek knowledge by the priest
Find answers carved in stone

Ravished by black wings

Seventy steps, downward the spiral
Into the fiery crypts, dreamlands ahead
Seven hundred steps, further down
To the gates of deeper slumber

Strange harbours hide strange sailors
Unknown oars strike unknown waters
Black galley's stench-ridden corridors
With purple sails set on lunar course

Witness the moon beast procession
Seek knowledge in Nyarlathotep
Witness the vile conquest of claws
Seek knowledge on the isle of oriab

Ngranek reveals the countenance
A vision of the outer gods
Night gaunts summoned from darkness
Disturbing this moment of clarity

Seventy steps, downward the spiral
Death lies behind - enlightenment ahead
Seven hundred steps, further down

Unbound from the burden of life
Onward to celephais...
