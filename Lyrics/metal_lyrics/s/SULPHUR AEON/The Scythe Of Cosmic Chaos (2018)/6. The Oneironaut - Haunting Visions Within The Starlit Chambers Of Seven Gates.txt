Amidst the deserts of Roba El Khaliyeh,
Beneath the fallen towers of Irem,
In titan caverns
Underneath the desert sand
There dwelleth I'thakuah
The primordial witch.

Antediluvian
Wisdom and madness,
Maniacal rancour
Within ancient black eyes

Mock her guise,
Flee from her curse!

Oneironaut!
Kneel before the seven gates.
Choose your vessel,
The soul leaves the flesh.
Oneironaut!
Kneel before the seven gates.
Choose your vessel,
And enter the gate.
Oneironaut...

Into the heart of the maze
Along the leftmost walls
Lieth the grand starlit chamber of seven gates
A dome painted in blue, pigmented with lapis lazuli
Bejeweled constellations of stars
Among the night sky

Oneironaut!
Travel through the seven gates.
The act of lucid dreaming
Is revealed.
Oneironaut!
Traveler in time and space
Choose your vessel and
Open the gate!

The first portal
Is leading to the Plateau of Leng,
Whilst the second portal
Leads to the City of Heights...
The third portal
Opens to sunken R'lyeh...
Travel to Yuggoth
By entering the fourth...
The fifth gate
Opens to sunken Atlantis...
Enter unknown Kadath
Through the sixth gate,
And the seventh
Leads to the Temple of Albion.

Oneironaut!
Travel through the seven gates!
Oneironaut!
Enter the gate!
