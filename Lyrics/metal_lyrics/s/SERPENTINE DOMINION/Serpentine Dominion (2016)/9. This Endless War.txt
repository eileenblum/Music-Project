Stand on the threshold of existence
Stare into the throat of death
Murderous intentions seeking to overtake
And exterminate human life
No longer frozen by fear
No more wasted tears. This is revenge
This is redemption to this endless war
We are processed then segregated voices
Are silenced and infiltrated the end to all
Pacification. We must escape
We will fight. We will die
We will rise in this endless war 
Destroy their web of lies
In this endless war
We crawl back to life on hands and knees
Experimentation as the skies bleed
The tidal wave of death storms unleash
We must escape
We will fight we will die, we will rise
In this endless war
Destroy their web of lies
In this endless war
Decimate the darkness
That once blinded our eyes
Now we will fight we will die
We will rise in this endless war
Destroy the system we will never give in
Tear down the system
In death we live again tear down
Destroy tear down
Destroy enslaved no more
Begin this endless war
