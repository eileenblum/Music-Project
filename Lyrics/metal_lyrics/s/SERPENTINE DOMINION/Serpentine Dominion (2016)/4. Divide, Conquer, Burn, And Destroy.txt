Divide, conquer, burn destroy
Testing, prodding, burning, injections
Suffocate us with your morbid intentions
Slowly weakening from all the lies
Where is your justice when the innocent die
Divide, conquer, burn destroy
We are the caged, unknowingly kept
Lusting to harness the chemicals, black breath
Beast of machines created to purge and decimate carcinogenic streams that annihilate
Your morbid intentions deployed
Divide, conquer, burn and destroy
No worth for life, just a means to employ
Divide, conquer, burn and destroy
Chemically inflicted rigor mortis takes hold
Figures still clinging to the last of their souls
Heavy black sludge heaves from the depths of life
Is the variable as the dominant detest
Your morbid intentions deployed
Divide, conquer, burn and destroy
No worth for life, just a means to employ
Divide, conquer, burn and destroy
Where is your justice when the innocent die
No worth for life, just a means to employ
Divide, conquer, burn, destroy
Silent screams gasping chocking pleading
Merciless
Pitiless
Soulless
Heartless
Tear it down
Burn it down
Tear it down
Burn it to the ground
