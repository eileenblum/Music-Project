A firestorm reigns down over the earth
Nuclear winter starts to choke and suffocate
Thousands of huddled masses
Looking to the skies through cold darkness
What's left of humanity groans
Holding onto the seeds of discontent
Will the truth erase us
There was nothing left not even remains
After the hailstorm of the burning winds
Flames no need for shackles and chains
When the will to live no longer remains
Blood fills the lungs
Serenade of heaving and convulsions no hope
Within these eyes, what shall we reap?
What shall we reap, whom shall we fear
When the essence of life soon disappears
Bury the weak, suffer the strong
On the brink of devastation
Breaking the will humanity
Decaying society
Bury the weak
Suffer the strong
On the brink of devastation
Sever the substance
Diabolical trance
Watching, waiting, serving our time shackled to
This smoldering earth lifeless gaze
Seeking a sliver of hope will the truth erase us
These arms of death
Shall suffer, bleed me
Until our will to fight is completely destroyed
What shall we reap?
What shall we reap? whom shall we fear
When the essence of life soon disappears
Bury the weak, suffer the strong
On the brink of devastation
