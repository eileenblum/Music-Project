Under the darkness of night
The horizons burning with their eyes
Watching and waiting the tension is building
Calculated indoctrination, iron cross
Jagged edges cover flesh in crimson bands
Icons that serve to enslave the minds of the feeble
Force-fed these poisonous lies
Deaf to the suffering cries
Staring into the blankness
The horde will unleash destruction
Jagged cross legions of the new world order
Bred to hate, consumed by greed and power
At the barbed wire gates enclosing the flesh
Into a concentration slow death
Stench rising from the remains
Rivers of vomit and waste seeping from the ground
Below demented and scared
Severed from the heart and no love lost
Jagged cross legions of the new world order
Bred to hate, consumed by greed and power
Injustice, interrogation destroying this generation
Jagged cross legions of the new world order
Far below the heavens
Earth is burning in the char of disdain
Will we suffer from the vile agenda
Of this world domination
When time has brought an end to the darkness
The slain shall be the hunter of souls
Smite them, strike them
Until the breath ceases to escape
Kill the hope within them all
Twisted in torment writhe and purge
Kill the hope within them all, kill the hope
Kill the hope within them all, break the wall
Drain the soul. Kill the hope within them all. Kill.
