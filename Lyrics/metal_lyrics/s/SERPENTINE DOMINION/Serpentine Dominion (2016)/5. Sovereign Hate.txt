Civilization on the brink of collapse 
A power struggle hid from the population 
Sterilization of the minds who submit warfare
Blends with misinformation
Consumed in the flames can we escape
Subtle messages in icons
To state we are no longer blind in democracyâs hold
The vision beholds the ritual
Under the gaze of the all-seeing eye
Consumed by the greed we cannot escape
Pulling all the strings
A nation of constant struggle
Orders to burn, deface, destroy, kingdoms
Reduced to rubble. 
Provider, master, and slave
Sealed in this sovereign hate
Mislead by all of you create
Sealed in this sovereign hate
This sovereign hate
Illusions of safety dependent on the design
As the sheep are led to the slaughter an effigy
Of death on mankind
Martyrs
Predetermined existence 
 martyrs
Apathetic resistance
Martyrs
Self destruction through submission
Traitors leads us to our damnation 
Provider, master and slave sealed in this sovereign hate
Mislead by all you create
Sealed in this sovereign hate
Deceived to manipulate
Sealed in this sovereign hate
This sovereign hate
We are slaves, we are all slaves
Trapped in this sovereign hate
This sovereign hate
