They blotted out the sun.
Under the haze of war torn skies.
Plotting fingers like knives searing cauterized resistance.
Caught in the crossfire, bound and gagged broken spirits of men forlorn manipulation of the masses.
The resistance is seething and burning.
All eyes revealed
Through tongues it will spread like plaque
Vanquished unto thee
With your life you shall make amends
Anguished unto thee
The rule of lies will come to an end
Vanquished unto thee
This pain will be avenged
From the ashes of cities.
The cries of the desperate remain propaganda. 
Attempts to numb and hinder the resistance is seething and burning.
All eyes revealed
Through tongues it will spread like plaque
Vanquished unto thee
With your life you shall make amends
Anguished unto thee
The rules of lies will come to an end
Vanquished unto thee
There will be revenge.
Turn a blind eye
How soon you will stare face to face with those neglected
Wallow in what you create
No longer crushing souls
No longer caged in lies
No longer apathetic
There will be revenge
