You were the ones that we believed
Betrayed and deceived
Fooled by all we see
No more
Betrayed by all the lies
All hope and faith die
Sever all of our ties
No more
Traitors
Betray the ones who trust
Deceivers
No more
Suffer this sickness
For intolerance
Plague the innocent
No more
Traitors
Betray the ones who trust
Deceivers
This must end
Why must we suffer why must we die when in the end
Vengeance prevails

Consume them. Vengeance
Destroy them. Vengeance
Atonement. Vengeance
Unleash the vengeance in me

Eradicate. Vengeance
And deface. Vengeance
Deliverance. Vengeance
Unleash the vengeance in me

Atonement will force its wrath upon thee

Consume them. Vengeance
Destroy them.Vengeance
Atonement. Vengeance
Unleash the vengeance in me
Eradicate. Vengeance
And deface. Vengeance
Deliverance. Vengeance
Unleash the vengeance in me
Unleash the vengeance in me

Bled through humanity
Shatter their vanity
No more
