All that's left is death and ashes
Terror walks free
The balance of the Hells has shifted
Fury unleashed

Pulled far into the deepest circle
Fight through the pain
No amount of torture will break us
Cast of these chains

And join the fight

And I will blacken out your sun
Feeding on your fear
Spilling all your blood

The Fates have not forsaken me
Again I will be strong
Again will be free

I 
Will never die
This world is mine
Soon I will break through the storm

Burn
Ignite the earth
Forge a new world
Rise from the ashes reborn

Primal rage powering my body
Hellfire spreads
This is the saga of foretold doom
Global sudden death

Now Judgment Day is brought before us
Show your true might
Unleash inferno in your soul
The Fires of Life

[Solo: Parker]

Take your life
Sacrifice
Blood is pouring from the sky

Darkness falls
Heroes rise
Surrounded by death

Prophesy 
Stars and moon
Nothing can prevent your doom

Through the flames
Through the fire
We'll tear down these walls

And rise again

Hell poised to spill forth
Great machines of war
The old world will burn
You and all your kind 
are doomed 

I 
Will never die
This world is mine
Soon I will break through the storm

Burn
Ignite the earth
Forge a new world
Rise from the ashes reborn

Reborn
