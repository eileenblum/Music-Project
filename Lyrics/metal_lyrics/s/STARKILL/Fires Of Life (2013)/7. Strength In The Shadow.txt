See the arrows fly
Overhead
Hear the steel clash
as men fall dead

Show no mercy
They must die
Charge into their ranks
This is our fight

It is time to go to war
Can't you see that we must go now?
Forces are depleted
We arise and go to war
It's our only cnance; Now go
We won't be defeated

Bleeding wounds
Are aching like fire
But the siege goes on
I will not tire

Hellish fire spreads
'Cross the land
All the foes are vanquished
By my hand

I find strength in the shadow
Darkness is the true path
You will kneel down before me
And feel my wrath
[x2]

[Solo: Charlie]
[Solo: Parker]

I find strength in the shadow
Darkness is the true path
You will kneel down before me
And feel my wrath
[x2]
