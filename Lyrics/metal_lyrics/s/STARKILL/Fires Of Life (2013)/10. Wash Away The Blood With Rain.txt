Gather all my strength
Face the truth
Face the fear

Haunting in my dreams
Disclosure is near

Curse these tainted lands
Wrapped in sorrow
Wrapped in pain

Pure adrenaline
Ignites my soul aflame

Harness the power
And unleash what's inside
All who oppose me will be torn down and die

Harness the power
And bend it to your will
Power of evil is hungry for the kill

Battle raging
Ripping tearing
Witness what I have become
Conquer enemies
Surrounding
Consecrate me in their blood

Thunder roaring
Lives are fading
Bodies piling in the night
Surrender
Is not an option
We must fight

They outnumber us
We resist
We are strong
Stars shine overhead
We'll fight all night long

Fellow men are killed
Anger builds
I press on

I show no restraint
And destroy them all

Harness the power
And unleash what's inside
All who oppose me will be torn down and die

Harness the power
And bend it to your will
Power of evil is hungry for the kill

Emerge from the smoke
Corrupt, I am born again
Torment makes you cnoke
Black flames swallow everything

[Solo: Parker]

They outnumber us
We resist
We are strong
Stars shine overhead
We'll fight all night long

Fellow men are killed
Anger builds
I press on

I show no restraint
And destroy them all

War is fading
Fire's dying
Kingdom safe
The battle's done

Feel the life
Drain from my body
Now I die
But I have won

Broken spears
And bodies burning
No reminders
Of the pain

Thunderclouds
Are looming over
Wash away
The blood with rain
