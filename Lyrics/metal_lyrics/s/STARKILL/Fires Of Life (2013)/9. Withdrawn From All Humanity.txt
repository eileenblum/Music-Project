Withdrawn from all humanity
Beyond the mortal plane
My sustenance draws heavily
On corpses I have slain

Silently I glare
Throughout my blood-soaked hall
Your valor I shall crush
Your spirit I shall maul

Honor serves you wrong
Transient glory fades
Stare into my eyes
Mortal masquerade

Your presence is not welcome
This labyrinth I claim
Weakened by your prudence
Return from whence you came

Sword raised in fear
Silently you cower
Drenched in blood behind my grasp
Your carcass I devour

Honor serves you wrong
Transient glory fades
Stare into my eyes
Mortal masquerade

[Solo: Parker]

The pulsing evil in my heart
Yearns for blood
That which you have
Shall be mine
A chrysalis of ice
Surrounds you
Space and time
Melt away

Drifting through
The grey in-between
Unending madness
Rots your core
Honor serves you wrong
Transient glory fades
Stare into my eyes
Mortal masquerade

I am the force that you fear
I am the night

Trapped in my lair, you are done
I take your life
