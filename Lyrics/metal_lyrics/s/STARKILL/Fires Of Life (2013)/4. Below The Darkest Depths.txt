Feel 
The esoteric force
The sky begins to bleed

Trapped
You must go forth
The vastness of the sea

Waves
Begin to crash
And blind you in your tracks

Down
Below the darkest depths
A mythic force attacks

Pulled into the freezing darkness
Fear inside your veins
A power that you cannot see
Has torn you from your reigns
Terror now embraces
And absorbs your every scream
Drowning in the blackness
You can feel your body leave
(x2)

Wake
And open up your eyes
Descend into the void

Wave
Of demons now approach
Everything destroyed

Run
Try to run away
Escape the blackened hoard

Kill
They've come to take your life
Defend with shield and sword

Stand against them
Do not give in
Combat fearless
You must 

Fight till death
[x5]

[Solo: Parker]

Stand against them
Do not give in
Combat fearless
You must fight till death

Pulled into the freezing darkness
Fear inside your veins
A power that you cannot see
Has torn you from your reigns
Terror now embraces
And absorbs your every scream
Drowning in the blackness
You can feel your body leave
[x2]
