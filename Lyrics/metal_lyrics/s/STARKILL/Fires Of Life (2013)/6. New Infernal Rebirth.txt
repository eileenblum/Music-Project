Buried in the sands 
Twisted power warped and wounded 
Tortured, bloody 
Confined in a coffin of lies 

Held in Chaos' hands 
Death and Darkness racing forward 
Scorching each and every mortal spirit they find 

[Solo: Parker] 

Rising towards the sky 
Winds of Old unleashed forever 
Struggling for power 
at the ends of the earth 

Sanguinary lust 
Claim the throne of ancient glory 
Launching the assault 
A new infernal rebirth 

[Solo: Parker]

Broken at last are the chains 
The venerable vehemence freed 
Blood of the tainted fallen 
Spills into the pools of sanctity 

Centuries covered in shadow 
Long has the truth been denied 
Ready to charge into victory 
Face your attacker; Tonight they die 
[x2]

Rise forth 
Spread the new reign of fire 

Rituals of awful power 
Entwined with blood of the past 
Stripping away at the purity 
Thunder shall rule at last
