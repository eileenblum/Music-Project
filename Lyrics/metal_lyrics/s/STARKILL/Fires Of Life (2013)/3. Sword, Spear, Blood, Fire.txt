The enemy progresses
Darkness invades the skies
We unleash devastation
No one lives; all shall die

The gods
Want to take our lives tonight
But we
Will not go without a fight

The Heavens scream
The earth quakes
We carry onward without fear

Go forth
Into the calamity
Fight back
Rewriting your destiny
Attack
Feel the thunder, flame, and fire
We won't stop
Till they're dead

Go
Forth
And attack
Drive the enemy's force back

Sword
Spear
Blood and fire
We will defend our empire

[Solo: Charlie]
[Solo: Parker]

I will be the source of your extinction
I will flood your hearts with terror and contempt
I will make you wish this day had never come
Laughing as you beg for death

Your greatest fears will be unleashed
The innocent will know eternal suffering
And all creation shall tremble
Before the darkness that will consume your world

My brothers of the sword!
We stand here staring Death in the face
The battle is not over so long as we still have strength
And strength, we have

I see the fire that burns within you
I see the fire that will spread fear among our foes
I see the fire that will bring our enemies to ashes
And our names to glory!

[Solo: Parker]

Fight
Kill them all
Fight with honor
Do not fall
Die
Take their heads
Don't stop
Till they all are dead
[x2]

Go
Forth
And attack
Drive the enemy's force back

Sword
Spear
Blood and fire
We will defend our empire

Fight
Rise
Kill them all
Fight with honor, do not fall

Die
Now
Take their heads
Don't stop till they all are dead
