The dark clouds disperse
Moonlight shows the way
Carnage roaring near
Bloody disarray

He stares in victims' eyes
No hope to evade
Mangled split apart
His bloodthirst sealed their fate

Stalking his prey
You can't escape
Your fate

Chased by his blade
You shall be slain 
By fate

Spawn of fiendish kin
He hunts eternally
His heart is black as night
Destroy humanity

Mortal he is not
No wounds can cause him pain
With every man struck down
He furthers his domain 

Stalking his prey
You can't escape
Your fate

Chased by his blade
You shall be slain 
By fate

Turns his blade upon you
It's impossible to 
try and outrun his attack
Face your death in the eyes
You have met your demise
Now there is no turning back

He will not stop until
Everyone has been killed
Death and hatred he commands
Every night he wanders
Stalks his prey as hunter 
Human corpses he demands

He will kill all
You can't escape
You shall soon fall
Accept your fate

[Solo: Parker]

He will kill all
You can't escape
You shall soon fall
Accept your fate

Stalking his prey
You can't escape
Chased by his blade
You shall be slain 
By fate
