Ravaging
The land of men
Mouth of Hell wide open

Dive below
Into the fire
As lakes of venom burn

Raise up your swords
This is our battle
This is our day
In this harsh world
We fear no foe, death, nor pain
[x2]

Age of toil
And age of steel
Fight alongside your brother

The skv is red
With blood tonight
No mercy upon one another

Raise up your swords
This is our battle
This is our day
In this harsh world
We fear no foe, death, nor pain
[x2]

No!

The sun turns black
Earth sinks into the sea
The hot stars down
From Heaven are whirled

Fierce grows the steam
And the life-feeding flame
Till fire leaps high
About Heaven itself

[Solo: Charlie]
[Solo: Parker]

Raise up your swords
This is our battle
This is our day
In this harsh world
We tear no foe, death, nor pain
[x2]
