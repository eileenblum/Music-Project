I am the anguish in your mind
Whispering heresy into your ears
With the full armor of Darkness
Ride into battle as Hell's cavaliers

Wings of fire
Burning death
Hold them down
Consume the flesh

Bleeding souls
Death of divine
The Heavens scream in anguish
In my war against the light

Fire
Cast down from Hell
Wipes away
Those who are weak

Fire 
Cast down from Hell
Burns with hatred
Forged in my apostasy 

[Solo: Parker]

Death is all I find sacred
Sacrifice
Merciless
Eternal war

Nothing is free from my terror
Eternal torment impaled through your heart

Wings of fire
Burning death
Hold them down
Consume the flesh

Bleeding souls
Death of divine
The Heavens scream in anguish
In my war against the light

The wind blows strong 
Into my sails
And carries me with pride

Charge ahead
With bravery
And both eyes open wide

Here I stand among the ashes
I alone the surviving flame
Turn my back upon the world
I want all to crush beneath my pain

Fire
Cast down from Hell
Wipes away
Those who are weak

Fire 
Cast down from Hell
Burns with hatred
Forged in my apostasy
