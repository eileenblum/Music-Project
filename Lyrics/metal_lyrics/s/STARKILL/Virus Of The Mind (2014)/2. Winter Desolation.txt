The shadow's reach grows
And strengthens my desperation
The stars, so faint and gone
No power left to change our path

Reflections start to fade
The passing of every second
Makes me question my faith
Am I damned to walk alone?

Abandoned
Forsaken
Lost in the frozen air
Wait to be
Awakened
From cold despair

Endlessly
I carry through the storm
I search to find my fate
Forever alone

Tears of time are falling
From frozen winter souls
I search to find my fate
Forever alone

The world has turned into ice
But my fire still is burning
And even if I die
I'll chase you down again in death

Embrace these darker days
For light is just an illusion
I've allied with the cold
And found the light within

Too long I've been
In winter desolation
I'm surrounded by frozen, bloody dreams
I won't wither
Away before all these lies
Time has changed me
And now at last I am to change time

[Dual solo]

[Solo: Parker]

Death
Distress
My soul
Won't rest
Embrace
Hate My faith
Won't wait
I'll carry through the storm

Endlessly
I carry through the storm
I search to find my fate
Forever alone
