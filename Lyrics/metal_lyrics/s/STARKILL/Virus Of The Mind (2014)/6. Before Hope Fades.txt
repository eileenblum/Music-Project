I saw it in dreams
The skies and earth were raging
And I was caught between
When you came

I followed through the night
A captive with no other choice
Soon I'll close my eyes
Forever

I cried out but you weren't there
Stranded hopeless in the depths of my despair

I'm not afraid to die
The siren's song is calling
But I'm not bound and I
Will follow

I've seen the distant shores
And though I know not where you lead
Carry me away
Forever

I cried out but you weren't there
Stranded hopeless in the depths of my despair
But in your shadow I found light
I will make it through this time

The emptiness takes everything
And starts to fade my memories
But if I listen, I still hear
The whisper that's calling all these years
Not afraid to lose my life
Not afraid to sacrifice
I don't care how long it takes
I will die before hope fades

[Solo: Parker]

I cried out but you weren't there
Stranded hopeless in the depths of my despair
But in your shadow I found light
I will make it through this time
