Ascend
Skyward
Climb the spiral into fate

A new
Chapter
Forms
As daylight dies and breaks

We test
Our power
Against your broken faith

Lies have been made
Clear
Itâs time to raise the stakes

Break
Free before itâs too
Late
Thereâs no time left to
Waste
We will not be
Erased

Ascend skyward

Break
All who stand in the
Way
We wonât be lead
Astray
The world is ours to
Take

Ascend skyward

Connection heaven and hell
Iâll make a name for myself

A gateway through space and time
To make this universe mine
Break
All who stand in the
Way
We wonât be lead
Astray
The world is ours to
Take
Now the stakes have been
Raised

Connection Heaven and hell
To make a name for myself
A gateway through space and time
To make this universe mine

Ascend skyward

Break
All who stand in the
Way
We wonât be lead
Astray
The world is ours to
Take

Ascend skyward
Go!

[Solo: Parker]
Ascend skyward!
