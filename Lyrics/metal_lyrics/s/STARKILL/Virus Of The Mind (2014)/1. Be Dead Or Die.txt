Exploding
I am fire
My only purpose is to take you down

There's nothing
That can save you
I'm gonna take your life from you

I give you
Just one option
And that's to fucking die

Your time is
Running out now
You might as well just take your

Life
Or I will end your life
I wanna watch you die
And see death in your eyes
So say your goodbyes
This is the end of the ride
This is the end of the line
So be dead... or die!

[Solo: Parker]

I want you to be dead
Existence erased
Nothing left of you
Not a single trace

Nowhere left to run
Got you in my sights
Now the end is here
Make your final choice
Now be dead or die!
