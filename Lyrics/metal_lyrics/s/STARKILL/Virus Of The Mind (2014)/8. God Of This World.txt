I shall destroy you
And bring you to naught
This is the era of the serpent
Already kindled
Is this fire on Earth
Fight for the world as my servants

Rise!
Rise!

Rise now, god of this world
You shall be most high
Rise now, god of this world
Rise!

[Solo: Parker]

I shall smite the earth with a curse
Enemies to ashes on the soles of my feet
Shedding blood as long as it takes
To cease this engine of grief

All eyes are open to the rights of Man
We will do away
With your artificial scaffolding
And bring forth new day

Here at last we shall be free
The Almighty hath not built here for his envy
Will not strike us hence
Here we may reign secure
And in my choice
To reign is worth ambition through hell
