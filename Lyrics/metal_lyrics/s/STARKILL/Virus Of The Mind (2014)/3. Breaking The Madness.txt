Another day
Another chance to watch my universe decay
The shadows of the past claw at me
As time warps my mind
So many questions left with answers still to find
But I will search until I die

The silence breaks
Death is upon me, there's no time to wait
I will not rest
Until I find
The reason for my life

Madness permeates
Into my body and my mind, it starts to break
Bit there is fucking nothing left to take
Nothing to feel
Trapped in the labyrinth, losing sight of what is real
So hard to tell which way to go

Lost in the nightmare, lost in the cold
Who is an ally?
Who is a foe?
This isn't the world I thought I knew
Death and betrayal are that is true

[Solo: Parker]

I know that it is not too late
To make it out of the unknown

I know that I can find a way
To break the madness in my soul

The silence breaks
Death is upon me, there's no time to wait
I will not rest
Until I find
The reason for my life
