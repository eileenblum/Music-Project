This is the ending
A battle of gods for the fate of the earth
Death is impending
So offer your soul and discover your worth

Fire and lightning
And ice are colliding on this tragic day
All of the fighting
You'll never be the same

Fly
Fight
Discover
Tonight

That we were meant
For so much more
Reveal the secrets
Open the door

Titans awoken
Burning the skies in the world they clash
Harmony broken
Humanity reduced to nothing but ash

Convergence calling
Storms are begging to brew
Evil wind falling
Our genocide overdue

This is the ending
This is it, can't you see?
No use defending
What will be will be

Everything's changed
As the stars realign
Nothing's the same
As humanity fades and dies
