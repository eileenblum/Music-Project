Here we are at last
Millennia passed
And nothing's changed
At all

They're still in control
A plague upon my soul
It's all so strange
And wrong

A world pushed by fear
Accepts the lies they hear
You are part of their plan
Just puppets in their hands

Time is running out
But if you learn to doubt
Maybe hope remains...

We've run ourselves into the ground
You had your lives to live
Your knowledge you could give
And yet you choose to die
Why?

Infection spreading all around
A virus of the mind
A destroyer of lives
I'm begging to you try
And survive

You ignore the truth
Your mind's are polluted
And you slow progress
There is nothing brave
In accepting insane
Lies without evidence

A world pushed by fear
Accepts the lies they hear
You are part of their plan
Just puppets in their hands

Time is running out
But if you learn to doubt
Maybe hope remains...

[Solo: Parker]

We've run ourselves into the ground
You had your lives to live
Your knowledge you could give
And yet you choose to die
Why?

Infection spreading all around
A virus of the mind
A destroyer of lives
I'm begging to you try
And survive
