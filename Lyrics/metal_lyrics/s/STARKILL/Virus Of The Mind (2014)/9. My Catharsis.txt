Total darkness
Absolution
Final calling
Revolution

Now you see me
Persecution
Now you're bleeding
Execution

Your death
My catharsis
This will be my sacrifice
(Sacrifice)

[Solo: Parker]

Perpetuating war
Accepting blindness no more
Can't look me in the eyes
'Cause you know I'll be your demise
No light can reach my heart
The shadows have left their mark

You hear me in the night
You're lost and running out of time

[Solo: Parker]

See the madness
Growing stronger
Sunlight fading
Night grow longer

I am reborn
Transformation
Total hatred
No salvation

Your death
My catharsis
This will be my sacrifice
(Sacrifice)

The blazing stars ignite the way
Follow the path and don't be led astray
No longer doubting in my eyes
Now is the hour of my greatest sacrifice
