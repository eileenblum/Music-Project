Time will come and go
Ancient ones will soon reap what chaos has sown
Shut the eye of faith
Walk comfort of reason's embrace

Stifled and silenced
You have forgotten what your true purpose is
Sadness dwells in me
Waters of death carry me to destiny

Sailing into destiny
Immortal I will be

I've felt the fear of death
The reason for my quest
We'll carry on
We will not die!

"Sailing across
Waters of death
Eternal glory
We will find"

I've seen it in my dreams
The gods are cursing me
And they are warning me
That it is my time

We're gonna take 'em down
Nothing can stop us now
We'll carry on
We will not die

[Solo: Tony]

[Solo: Parker]

Sailing into destiny
Immortal I will be
