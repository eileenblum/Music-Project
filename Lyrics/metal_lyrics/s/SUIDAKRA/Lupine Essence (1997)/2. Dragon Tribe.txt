[Music &amp; Lyrics by Suidakra]

Another dry mornin'
A summon song awakes
The tribe of the dragon
So desolate...

He lurks on the hill with outstretched wings
Watching for every false step

The dragon tribe... Delusion of delight

The little ones look up
Dazed of the might
The envy in their eyes
See the all - mighty flight

Grab a slice darkness
When time is ripe
The envy in their eyes
See the all - mighty fight
