[Music &amp; Lyrics by Suidakra]

I felt asleep, with the raising moon
Found myself born anew

All my grief and all my pain
Turns into glee (in another dream)
Low whispering voices say
Everything is a dream

So sheltering dreams keep me alive
I try to leave, I try to hide
Can't they hear my silent cry
I cannot breathe in their light

But a low voice whispers to me
Nothing's as it seems to be
