[Music &amp; Lyrics by Suidakra]

That is not dead
which can eternal lie
yet with strage aeons
even death may lie
H.P. Lovecraft

I bewail my destiny
a foible of mine
but her voice tortures my mind

I yearn for her bosom
I fear her sway
my eternal blemish
is her embrace

She whispers : chose a realm -
these two are the preferred ones:
Hell - where your soul reduces to ashes
Heaven - where you?ll be drowned
