Drown the last discord
To afford a sense of satisfaction
Dissecting the past
To avoid yourself
For a next injection
Of a faked life

My vision's demise

Confusing images
Of lust and frustration
A collapse of taste
And imagination

Where's the matter
Of being enslaved
Life was his prison
The moments his grave

My mind is caught but gone astray
In a white noise melody

Dazed by the reflecting stars
But chased by the changes which never come

Cry for the moon
Shed a tear
For what you've become

Lament and croon
Of all your fears
For all changes undone

Hollow words
Of a broken mind
Curse your mind
For a mental burn out

For me I am
The cause and witness
With reflecting eyes
A harlequin of sadness

Drown the last discord
To afford a sense of satisfaction
Dissecting the past
To avoid yourself
For a next injection
Of a faked life

For a last injection
Of my faked life
