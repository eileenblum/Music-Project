No prophet of doom
For a world in decline
Separate my will from my dead

No legend of fate
For the flight of time
But a lost horizon beneath my feet

I am here but absent
A mask behind my face
Time passes by
Leaving faint and hollow days

At strife with my fate
I try to roll my stone
Up to a mount of higher gains

Where's the void
I'm spinning around
Fate itself amounts it all
To the same thing

Lost in the toils of life
Content and depraved
Another phantom rises
To fill the void with lies

I can hear the voices gather
A roundelay of decadence
Increase to battle cries

Lost in a void of lies
And darkness rises

In the end of all craving
There's no golden age
For misery and hope severs a thin line
That strives for the unknown truth and lie combines
To reveal the final cost

Rise to fall again
Bound in changes
The burden of life
Is to curse the ages unborn
Born to plough
A lonely furrow
There's no ground
I'm forced to be bound

Might and darkness
Mourning in silence
Careworn souls
Are falling through time

Blind and mindless
Longing for guidance
Careworn souls
Are caught in their mind
