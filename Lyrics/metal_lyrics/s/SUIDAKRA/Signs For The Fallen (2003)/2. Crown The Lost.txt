True belief in fiction
Dominate the weak
Free to choose the way of death
Fall on your knees and creep

Die with no remorse
Blind to different views
For all your reasons
To die for and to kill
Ain't strong enough
To be in a lifetime fulfilled

Paralysed and broken
Cries out of the dust
Out of new-born ruins
Shrouded under pain and tears
Crown the lost
Enthrone the dead
Run in circles
Through the curse of revenge
Do you see that matters change?

If there's a god - out there
A cause of chaos - and beauty
If we stand face to grace - naked and bare
Like a beast of pain and cruelty

If there's a higher state - anywhere
I am the ground:
What is a tree without roots
No more than a thought without any doubts

True belief in fiction
Dominate the weak
Free to choose the way of death
One last breath for the divinity

Die with no remorse
Blind to different views
If there's a way to seek
Fall on your knees and creep
