On wings as black as madness' veil
A spark bursts
Into flames of wasting rage
Trembling voices spread the word
Revenge!

Strength and honour
Will guide me through
Darker days
And noble ways
Prevail to lead
Through darker hours
Of strength and honour

An error in the web of fate
Aftershock
A curse, a prayer bears the storm
Afterlife

Oh vengeance will be mine
Oh a memory in a thoughtless time

Limbs that turn in secret signs
Whip the night - and seek their prayer
And a voice of steel
Calling so bright and so cold
Peeling rotten souls - out of their flesh

Hate break loose!
Free my soul
Death is no more when
Peace is forged in bleeding fire

Breeding winter of the heart
Grim blood roars in feathered veins
Leaves me to fading reign of ashes
Crowed with soil and pain

A cry of war, beyond the grave
Trails of gore lead my way
For a crimson leaf we paid
In countless thorns
And a new age is born
