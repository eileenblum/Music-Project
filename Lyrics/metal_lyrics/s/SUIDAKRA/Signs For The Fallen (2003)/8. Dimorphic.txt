To heal the state of dimness
I cast the blame
To the burden of life
It's perpetuation - all the same

To unfold the splendour
And within the stain
To replicate myself
I succeed to fail

Lies and chains
Are a part of the machine
Perception changes
To fall apart from me

Like a hydra in a maze
Decisions are doomed to fail
Demented and depraved
I bite our own trail

Our tellural ground - infested
Even disease - lay wasted
No place for wonders - insatiate
Child of fire - kin of fate

Now swallow the light
Oblivion has the clearest conscience
Take all your fright
For serenity is a life sentence
