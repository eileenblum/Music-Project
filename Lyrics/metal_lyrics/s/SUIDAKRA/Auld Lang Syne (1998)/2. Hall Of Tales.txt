[Music &amp; Lyrics by Suidakra]

There's darkness everywhere in the hall of time
but a low glowing fire shines on lonly silhouettes
nigh colums of chilliads with runes of fate
scalds , bards and minstrels stare into the flames

Their lonly voices soar into the silence
like a glint into the feeble light
some runes start to shine in silvery letters
forgotten stories of ruins and ne`er ending blight:

Far away from now in sunken times
a fair young maiden followed the wind
a will - o`- the - wisp led her astray
into a vale of bleakness and grief
Thousands of men - struck the marching tune
so they died and she greets seeding tears
and waiting for harvest

Far away from now in sunken times
a travelling lad followed an old path
his thoughts stray constantly to the sky
where elfs and wyverns fly
his colleen by his side with so bright eyes
shillelagh won`t ever fly again

Far away from now in sunken times
an old bard sung with the wind
the trees on an old path told him
of a place his thoughts still long for
A hall of ancient wisdom and lore
in the eclipse of abandoned time:

There`s darkness ...
