[Music &amp; Lyrics by Suidakra]

For thousand aeons
abiding the time
so silent and mute
the wind murmurs a tale

The wise of yore
evoked the spirits
to see the arcanum
but ay they failed

A witness of wyverns
elfs and sylvan glory
a petrified story of
... ancient realms

[Lead: Arkadius]

Thy mind of stone
a secret that accelerates
The tides of time
awaken by moonlight
when a bard reminds a tale

A fresh gale defeats my enchanted mind
farewell to my delight
but when the moon rises again
in my dreams , I will fight

Oh can you see the dancing shadows ? 
the fairy - ring right there behind the trees ?
close your eyes ...
