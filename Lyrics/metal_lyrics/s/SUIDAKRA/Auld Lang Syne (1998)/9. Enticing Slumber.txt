[Music by Suidakra, Lyrics by Uwe S.]

Emperious Mountains
breathing pure frost
Icewinds in pale crowns
woodays into the...

Melancolic realms
cradle of soulless horde
Howling in league with them
a pact sealed wirh...

Nocturnal ways - don`t dare to follow
Carnal prey on untrodden path...

[Lead: Arkadius]

Eye to eye
surrounded by fear
Enduring their breath
eternal is the dark...

Swirling black
shapes in the unlight
Unfold empyrium
their traces are yours...
