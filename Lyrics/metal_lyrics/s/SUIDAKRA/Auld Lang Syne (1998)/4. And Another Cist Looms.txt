[Music &amp; Lyrics by Suidakra]

[Lead: Arkadius]

So I reel away to a vale
of cists in front of me
endless buried names of forlorn games
wilting I fall to the ground
unable to reach the gate
the stones on which he lain all knew his name

Fare you well my mother
I shall search your flames
in the four winds of the land
Fare you well my dear son
Never forget the end

I awake by moonlight
under a lorn tree
a forgotten might
forces me to the sea

By a lonly seashore
a fair young naiad beholds me
the spray whispers my name
I laud her embrace , my wild young sea

So In desperate longing I take my path
unable to turn around
a forgotten might lames my will
But in my dreams I can hear her voice
a flame in the dark
a forgotten might makes me chill

By a lonly tree
a fair maiden beholds me
Eyes of soil , a sylvan goddess
her beauty lames my forlorn heart
silently the stones whisper a name
I laud her embrace like a fuddled bard

So In desperate...

By a bleak ghastly champaign
a gibbous moon illuminates
staring eyes in the wind
burning like infernal blazes
I will never laud her cold embrace

But her flames calls my name
