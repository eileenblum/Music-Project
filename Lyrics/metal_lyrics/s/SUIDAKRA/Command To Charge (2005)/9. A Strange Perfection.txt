Oh this can't be me
Who's falling, who's drowning
Calling for direction
In this current of fiction

In a moment so true
Full of fading chances
When it comes to face my mind
I turn to go away

In this round of pleasure
I'm in the middle
Dazed by sorrow
Tricked by life

Stained by hate
I'm here for the fight
Creating my own right
Like fire creates the light

I'm rising to a strange perfection
- of inferior correction -
Clarity is the key to unlock the beast
- of cognition -
Fear the shades of my vision

I'm here within the lie
A slave of my own life
Societies dream failed for me
Now only the strong survive

I'm rising to a strange perfection
- of inferior correction -
Clarity is the key to unlock the beast

Stained by hate
I'm here for the taking
Creating my own right
Like fire creates the light

I'm rising to a strange perfection
- of inferior correction -
Clarity is the key to unlock the beast

Can anyone tell
On this zenith of mankind
If heaven or hell
Is just joyful thinking
