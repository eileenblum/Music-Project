If you take a modest look at us
You'll never see what we see
A tragedy that's still unseen
We will always do what we want to
It ain't a monophonic world
Never hear what we hear
Wartunes from a past decade
Try to dance to the sound of today

The future holds a silence yet
Do you dare take the next step?
Trapped in deaf frequencies
Better dance to the sound of today

The decibel dance demands bleeding feet
A broken neck, scarred back
Familiar voice with a decent tone
But the words we speak burn
Even more than the sun

There's a difference
Between what we say
And what you understand
In your own way

Just like you
We're not going with the flow
For the wild river
Is changing it's course
For no one knows

For ourselves and nothing more
That's what we are standing for
Don't you try to prove us wrong
This is the sound of today

The decibel dance demands bleeding feet
A broken neck, scarred back
Familiar voice with a decent tone
But the words we speak burn
Even more than the sun

Nothing exists
Until it's discovered and classified
Experience the whole as one
