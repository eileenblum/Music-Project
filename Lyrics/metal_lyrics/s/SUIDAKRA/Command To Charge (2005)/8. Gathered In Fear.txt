Distant is the time
Of which I speak
Open was my heart
On that wild day

For all has come to pass away
When the haze dares the wind
And the sand the rising tide
Just a castaway in your dream
All alone we're gathered in fear

Moments so precious in their pain
They rush through my heart
I was facing the end full of fear
And it tore a part of me

[A voice said]
Welcome to the night
To grief and sorrow
Where the fire of life shines so bright
And we crave for the morning

Farewell to the light
Where oblivion reigns
The streams of time

Peer through this cold haze
While it battles this gale
Where a moment so pale
Gives a glance over this maze
A glowing spark in the night
Just a castaway in your dreams
All alone we're gathered in fear

Moments so precious in their pain
They rush through my heart
I was facing the end full of fear
And it tore a part of me

[A voice said]
Welcome to the night
To grief and sorrow
Where the fire of life shines so bright
And we crave for the morning

Farewell to the light
Where oblivion reigns
The streams of time
