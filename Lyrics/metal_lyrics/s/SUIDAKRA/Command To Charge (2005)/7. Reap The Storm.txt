Still it stands
With roots anywhere
In the soil of time
At the bottom of my life

Accursed to suffer
Obliged to pain
I'm falling deeper

Imperious and final
I'll take you with me
When I hit the ground

There's no deeper consequence
No higher destiny

We walked this path so many times
Again and again
Oh I can't deny it

There's no deeper consequence
No higher destiny

In the end
It testifies my strength
My power to sustain this suffering

Die by my hand
For the sons you've killed before
I'm the scourge of thunder
The harvester of storms

Welcome the end
In an embrace of fire

In the end
It testifies my strength
My power to sustain this suffering

Accursed to suffer
Obliged to pain
I'm falling deeper

Imperious and final
I'll take you with me
When I hit the ground

There's no deeper consequence
No higher destiny

Still it stands
With roots anywhere
In the soil of time
At the bottom of my life

We walked this path so many times
Again and again
Oh I can't deny it

There's no darker seed
No brighter fate
Than the ways of time
In the circles of hate
