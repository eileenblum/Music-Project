I'm not the one who fell
But the final aim
Of what men can find
In loss of all betrayal
In loss of all self-denial - lost sight

Suffering so essential
An existential colossus
Of will and power

Feelings so depraved
A betrayed answer to all
Of sanity and devour

Join this - You'll miss everything
Even things you didn't know
Join the shadow-ring

I'm here above
I can see you creeping
Breathing, melting in my light

Can you feel the might
Of what men can reach?
You'll miss everything

I'm not the one who fell
But the final aim
Of what men can find
In loss of all betrayal
In loss of all self-denial - lost sight

Suffering so essential
An existential colossus
Of will and power

Join this - You'll miss everything
Even things you didn't know
Join the shadow-ring

I'm here above
I can see you creeping
Breathing, melting in my light

Where are you my forlorn one
Never found, never gone
A missing part to fulfill this all
Reaching out to the end and beyond

My second face (no mirror)
I've never seen it (no reflection)
No mirror, no reflection
I beg to see it

My vision is so clear
Will I ever reach it
No mirror, no reflection
Where are you?
