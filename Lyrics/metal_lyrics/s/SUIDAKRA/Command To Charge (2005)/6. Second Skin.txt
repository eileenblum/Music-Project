Hide the door
There's no place beyond
Who will follow
Until all is gone

Along the floor
Of carpet flames
There lies the truth
The silent name of all

Cold eyes staring
Into my innermost fears
Shadows glaring
Into sweet oblivion
A place so black
With shades of white

A stronghold where I can hide
Where all reins of life
- fall from my grasp -
This clarion call makes me shiver in fear
- it seals my curse -

The candle fades
In a lapse of light
It flickers bright
Denying the darkness

Will it ever change?

Weak and frail
Like wilting memories
We cry for the first light
And silently die in fear

Cold eyes staring
Into my innermost fears
Shadows glaring
Into sweet oblivion
A place so black
With shades of white

Where all reins of life
- fall from my grasp -
This clarion call makes me shiver in fear

The candle fades
In a lapse of light
It flickers bright
Denying the darkness
