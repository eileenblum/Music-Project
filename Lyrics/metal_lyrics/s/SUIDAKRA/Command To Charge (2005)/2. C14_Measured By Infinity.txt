Like a white desert
Crying out her noise
I see myself diving into the hills

I'll show you my toxic void
One step behind, I live my lie
The golden decade just passed by
Will I ever seize the day?

When infinity is left beyond all borders
And neither all nor nothing is gone
Who is there to guide my hand?

'Cos mine is always clenched in a fist
When it starts again I'll keep my eyes shut

When infinity is left beyond all borders
And neither all nor nothing is gone

What should I expect to come,
When my view is so obscured?
To join the essence
To set my soul free
To break down

Into my sea of dead passions
I see myself diving into the hills
Of a white desert

I'll show you my toxic void
One step behind, I live my lie
The golden decade just passed by
Will I ever seize the day?

When divinity refused to obey my order
In the end all and nothing was gone
Who was there to guide my hand?

'Cos mine is always clenched in a fist
When it starts again I'll keep my eyes shut

What should I expect to come,
When my view is so obscured?
To join the essence
To set my soul free
To break down
