Demons to some angels to other
Embrace the crimson nightwinged sea
Mortality we left behind
Pierced on a column of frozen blood

Brought forth by humble gliding fingers
We break the seal, inflame your soul
A needle waits for every pore
We can't escape this anymore

Blinded hollow eyes alone
Cast out so violently sweet
Can you see the fondling light
That howls within the veins of hell

Deities of pain we are
A chain of mortal fate
Bearing promises on skinless tongues

Deities of pain we are
A wrath you can't escape
Hearing promises but it won't change
The alliance

By chain and thorn we lead your path
Which you will crawl on bleeding knees
With fear and pain bare existence
Whatever might be left of you

Demons to some angels to other
Embrace the crimson nightwinged sea
Mortality we left behind
Pierced on a column of frozen blood

Deities of pain we are
A chain of mortal fate
Bearing promises on skinless tongues

Deities of pain we are
A wrath you can't escape
Hearing promises but it won't change
The alliance

And so eternally we lurk
In a faceless, breeding scenery
And wait for the spawn in your veins
A sore heart is to be strained
