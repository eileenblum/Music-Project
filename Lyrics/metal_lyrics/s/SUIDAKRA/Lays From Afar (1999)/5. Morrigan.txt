[Music &amp; Lyrics by Suidakra]

Once, on another weary day of mine
Just when the sun began to fondle mother earth
On a hill I stood to behold this crimson embrace
A stricken field to my feet (under bloody mist)
Myriad hollow staring eyes

Wrapped in red clouds
The corvine goddess appeared
Emptiness filled my mind
Fervid thoughts crawled suddenly into me...

Morrigan - three faced goddess dark and wild
For thee I`ll raise my sword and shield
Morrigan - grimest crow beneath the sky
May the eyes of thousands please thy raging greed

Come forth now grimest crow
Thou cry shall shatter earth and sky
...Like a shrieking carnyce...

In thy shadow I shall stand forevermore
I send thee hail and eternal troth...
Night descended and the stars within my eyes
Cleared my mind and aflamed my heart
I flee thy corvine ire

Morrigan - three faced goddes dark and wild
For thee they rose their swords and shields
Morrigan - grimest crow beneath the sky
May the eyes of thousands please thy raging greed - but not mine...
