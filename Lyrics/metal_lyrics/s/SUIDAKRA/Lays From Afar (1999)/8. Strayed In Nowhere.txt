[Music &amp; Lyrics by Suidakra]

The moon passed his realm oh many times
Restless he hied to the caress of the sea
Sylphlike lights in the dark with alluring voices
So many stars I`ve never seen

So I cursed each day
And it`s joyful sneer
And in nights of fear
I saw their darksome shapes of light

I hied with the wind
Won`t ever dree my weard
Endless width of splendour
But my thoughts stood dear

Strayed in nowhere
Some inner tide
Made me long afar
To an aim beyond all sight
(Is there no one to guide me)

Through this endless maze
Where are the stars and dales ?
Where is my way home ?
Oh where am I ?

Strayed in nowhere...

To and fro I went in my sleep
But each step brought me closer to my last
Standing stones glared at me with fathomless eyes
Assuring me that I am lost

Sylphlike lights in the dark with alluring voices
So many stars I`ve never seen
Each a one called me to rest
Until I hear the banshees lonely caoine
