[Music &amp; Lyrics by Suidakra]

Sudden the morn came
Slowly the curtain rose
Awe shone in his eyes
Another light was born to rove

With pinions of sorrow
On winds of despair
The beast appeared
Some say it would never go away

With eyes of morrow
On stars of guidance
He faced all fright
His way a neverending night

So he defied the lively waves
Betrayed himself
And the restless hieing winds

Strong is the blade of hatred
The desire of our desperate hope
The serpent of grief
Feeds virtue to it`s sateless breed

High aloft the dragon flies
The falcon has gone astray
So nigh but also far away

A cry above - the wyvern dies
Blind eyes have broken the oath
So far away but also close

The awaited even came
Slowly the curtain fell
Awe shone in his eyes
Another light still yearns to dwell

His eyes full of sorrow
And wounds of despair
Bled immortal dreams
Whispering of days of yore

The guise in the mirror
No more stars to guide
It`s the beast he feared
Now he knew it would never go away

So he defied the eternal rock
Buried himself
Into the everlasting flame

Strong is the blade of hatred
The desire of our desperate hope
The serpant of grief
Feeds virtue to it`s sateless breed

High aloft the dragon flies
The falcon has gone astray
So nigh but also far away

A cry above - the wyvern dies
Blind eyes have broken the oath
So far away but also close
