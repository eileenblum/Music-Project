Marching on to Dinas BrÃ¢n
The ravens called his name
Bearer of the Eagle Red
To Britain Macsen came

A dream of certain death
Unveiled to him one night
Incursion of the Scots and Picts
The onset to the fight

Possessed by battle lust he fell
For that day he would meet his end
But the dream did not reveal
The power of the grail of BrÃ¢n

The shards still held strength
Honouring his brave demise
The druids baptised him
Before he died

The shards of Pair Dadeni,

Restored and blessed again
The cauldron of Rebirth,
Immortalised through BrÃ¢n

The past no longer of concern
Only future you can effect
A single dream can make a change
Reshape the world and alter fate

The shards of Pair Dadeni,
Restored and blessed again
The cauldron of Rebirth,
Immortalised through BrÃ¢n

Magic shards restored his life
Miracle for all men to see
In his veins its power reigned
What about his guiding dreams?

Crowned King at Dinas BrÃ¢n
The ravens called his name
Bearer of the Dragon Red
In Britain Macsen stayed
