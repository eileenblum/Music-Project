Entering the dark stone hall
The inner sanctum

They felt an eerie presence
Something ancient, something strong
Black iron box in the darkness
Inside the niche across the hall

This was what they had to defend
This was where their master went
To seek the counsel of the living head
To seek the counsel of the baphomet

10.000 strong, they stormed the walls
To end the gruelling siege

To battle, murder and destroy
The last crusader keep
Defended by 300 knights
This was their final stand

10.000 souls had stormed the walls
The knights gave up the fight
Inside the crypt the head recalled
The story of his life...

Dark eyes surveyed them from inside
Terrible soul-searing sight
Eyes shimmering with ancient knowledge
Eyes filled with ancient pride

The head of a Roman Emperor
Adored with a laurel crown?

Or the face of a Celtic king
With runic Ogham carved?

This was what they had to defend
This was where their master went
To seek the counsel of the living head
To seek the counsel of the Baphomet

"10.000 souls had stormed the walls
The knights gave up the fight
Inside the crypt the head recalled
The story of his life..."
