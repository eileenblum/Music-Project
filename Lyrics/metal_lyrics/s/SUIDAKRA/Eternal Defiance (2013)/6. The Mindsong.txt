After the hunt in the heat of the day,
The Emperor rested from the gruelling chase
As he closed his eyes and gave in to his dreams
His mind took him over mountains and streams

To the fairest of islands ever known
Through the gates of a mighty keep
To an old king on an ivory throne
And a maiden on a golden seat

His closed eyes had never seen
A maiden more fair than She
As he kneeled beside her gilded chair
She softly sang into his ear,

"Emperor of Rome, you know I'm real
Let me love you beyond your dream.
Emperor of Rome, you know I'm real
Let me love you beyond your dream."

Alas right there and then
The emperor's sleep came to an end

"It's better to be alone", he thought,
"I have wars to wage, battles to fight
Love always leads to pain and loss."
But the maiden's song stuck in his mind

"Emperor of Rome, you know I'm real
If you love me you'll come to me."
"Emperor of Rome, you know I'm real
If you love me you'll come to me."

He searched the lands and gave in to his dream
His quest took him over mountains and streams

To the British islands he would roam
Through the gates of a towering keep
There sat an old king on an ivory throne
And a maiden on a golden seat

His open eyes had never seen
A maiden more fair than She
As he kneeled beside her gilded chair
He softly sang into her ear,

[2x]
"Empress of Rome, I knew you were real
Let me love you beyond my dreams."
"Empress of Rome, I knew you were real
Let me love you beyond my dreams."
