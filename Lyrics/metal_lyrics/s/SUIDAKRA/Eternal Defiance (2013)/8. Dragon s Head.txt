A clash of West and East

Bringing pain and misery

Calling forth his destiny
The balance of the world seems gone

At Aquileia his final stand
Cursed with dreadful visions
Attacked with overwhelming force
Surrounded by eastern legions

The Battle of the Save
Why didn't he foresee?

Incursions into Gaul
His generals defeated
The enemy victorious

Executed for all to see
Finally his dreams made sense
Embracing his dark destiny

The Emperor is dead
Behold Penn Dragon
The Dragon's Head
