As ages went by
The dreaming head survived
Enclosed in a black shrine
Oracle for the mighty and high

Caught in a strange inner battle
A place beyond time
Its struggle within
Unapparent from without

Once all the power in the world was mine
All that's left is moribund flesh
And the power to keep my dreams alive
Plant ideas in someone's mind

My mind is trembling
My thoughts absorbed by the ancient stones
My spirit is willing
My dreams defiant past flesh and bone

All the choices in the world are mine
All that's left is drying flesh
And the power to make my mark in time
Plant ideas in someone's mind

My mind a whirl of visions
My thoughts absorbed by the ancient stones
My spirit is soaring
My dreams defiant past flesh and bone

As ages went by
The dreaming head survived
Enclosed in a black shrine
Oracle for the mighty and high

Heir to an ancient mystery
From a place beyond time
Its knowledge within
Unapparent from without

Once I went on a quest divine
When all i had was a legion of men
I sought and found eternal life
I conquered the world and made it mine

My mind is wide awake
My thoughts absorbed by the ancient stones
My spirit is exulting
My dreams defiant past flesh and bone

My mind a well of power
My thoughts absorbed by the ancient stones
My spirit undying
My dreams defiant past flesh and bone

But knowledge has to grow in time
All that's left is lost days past
The things I've done and left undone
A dreaming head under a dawn sky

As ages went by
The dreaming head survived
Enclosed in a black shrine
Oracle for the mighty and high

Cursed with immortality
In a place beyond time
Its dreams within
Unapparent from without
