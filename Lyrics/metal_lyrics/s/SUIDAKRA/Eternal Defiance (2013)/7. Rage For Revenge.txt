Seven lengthy years ago
Crowned king on British soil
Ruler of the western throne
Commanding Britain, Spain and Gaul

At Helen's side he ruled the realm
Raising castles, building roads
Until one day the message came
Of his banishment from Rome

His title stripped, allies gone
They murdered and destroyed them all
No longer emperor of the west
Disgrace he never would accept

Under the Eagle Macsen left
To die or triumph over Gaul
Under the Dragon he'd return
Retaliate and conquer Rome

A Celtic army Macsen raised
To march and take the throne

To join him in his wrath for Rome
A Celtic army Macsen raised
To march and take the throne
To aid him in his rage for revenge

Sons of Eudav crushed the gates
Dragon army entered Rome
Emperor caught and slain
Magnus Maximus sat on the Throne

Macsen's rage had died in blood
Reflecting on his throne he sat
Since everything that he had touched
Was now forever changed...

His title stripped, allies gone
They murdered and destroyed them all
No longer emperor of the west
Disgrace he never would accept

Under the Eagle Macsen left
To die or triumph over Gaul
Under the Dragon he returned
Retaliate and conquer Rome

A Celtic army Macsen raised
To march and take the throne
To join him in his wrath for Rome
To aid him in his rage for revenge
