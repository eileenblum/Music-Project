One day in Fall
I headed to the coast
My back to the wind,
My hairs flowed almost
Like the waves on the sea
My eyes strayed, free...

Carry me over, carry me over
Into the distance, far far away
Carry me over, carry me over
Thinkin' back of the good old times when we heard
The distant call

No warm farewell,
No wishings to be back soon
The nights were too cold,
So we dreamed of better days
Better than today
My eyes strayed, free...

Long ago on a foreign shore
We heard a call as from the gale
Many died in the cold embrace o' the sea
On dead winds we sailed
