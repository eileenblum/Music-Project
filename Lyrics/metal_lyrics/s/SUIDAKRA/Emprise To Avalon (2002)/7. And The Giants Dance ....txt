[Music by Arkadius]

Through the unnatural silence rose a moan,
As if from the very Earth itself.
As it rose in volume it also rose in pitch,
Until it was clear that it issued from the
Standing stones of Salisbury plain.
Inoxarably the sounds crescendoed into the
Shrieking wail of the druids.
While they turned to stone...
