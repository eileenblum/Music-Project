[Music by Arkadius, Marcel, Lars &amp; Lyric by Marcel]

[Arthur:]
I am the boar
I took the head of bran
Which kept the land so secure
So hunt the godless
Heathen host
And dignity improves our valor

Rise all you honest warriors
Close the lines - fight with one hand
Life is short and memories`ll last
Fate itself cast us into war

Years and tears of war have passed
Camelot grew out of blood
Truth and virtue reign side by side
The night passed into light
But not in my mind...

[Medrawt:]
I am the shadow of discord
The void of lust
Unaware begot in sin
The nameless lord of distrust

The shades`ll grow stronger
Tainting all your joyful minds
A coward creeping enemy
Silently strikes you blind

Arthur:
Dark Lord of Orkney, scourge of lot
My song of doom is also thine
Caliburn`s my strength, Gwynhwyvar my shield
My fate and task lays beyond time
