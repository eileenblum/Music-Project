[Music by Arkadius, Marcel, Lars &amp; Lyric by Marcel]

[Myrddin:]
Now the seal is broken
which captured all misery
while dark hands of fate
fulfilled the augury

The script of this tragedy
Now lies in my hands
I read the lines, realize the signs
how the story ends

The High King is dead
struck by his vision
greater than men
It`ll spread out through time... an eternal rhyme
- sic transit gloria mundi -

A challenge between darkness and light
Medraut and his clansmen of terror
A discordant soul burnt the seed
with voices of blight

Take my hand I`ll be your guide
On the battlefield of wrath
Read my mind IÂ´ll show you the light
Birth of a vision sealed by your death

I am Taliesin
with swordlike words
the rhyme for reason
and truth against the world

[Solo: Arkadius]

I am Merlin
a fiction
with chanting spells
a herold of fate

I am Myrddin
the link to reality
a sage, a wizard
an everlasting mystery

A threefold existence in a darkane time
I am now and forever
A futile persistance between me and life
Lasting since auld lang syne...
