Watch, watch, the dark book is yearning
Look now, Fomorians are crying
Days filled with peril are waiting
I'll bury the book with my druid

Watch, watch, your people are fleeing
Go now, your race is defeated
Days filled with peril are waiting
Or stay here and love me, brave druid

Once your allegiance is given
Your life-force forever shall feed me
But while you refuse my seduction
Your servant till death I must be

Watch, watch, the demons are reigning
Look now, Fomorians are feasting
Days filled with hate are waiting
I'll help you take vengeance, brave druid

We'll capture their foul evil essence
With dark spells we'll put them to rest
Beyond the waves their souls will be sent
A black book of power we'll craft

Watch, watch, the demons are waning
Look now, Fomorians are fading
Days filled with bliss are waiting
Without hate you'll succumb, my brave druid

Once your allegiance is given
Your life-force forever shall feed me
No longer do you refuse my seduction
My servant till death you must be

Sleep now, your strength is depleting
My oath is no longer binding
Die, die, your life-force is failing
I'll mourn your demise, my brave druid

Watch, watch, the dark book is yearning
Look now, Fomorians are crying
Days filled with peril are waiting
I'll bury the book with my druid

Watch, watch, the dark book is yearning
Look now, Fomorians are crying
Days filled with peril are waiting
Stay here and love me, brave druid
