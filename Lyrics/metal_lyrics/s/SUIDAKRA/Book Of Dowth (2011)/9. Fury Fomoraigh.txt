When the truth dies
The end draws near
And all will fall

When the truth dies
The race of men
Has come and gone

A twisted race of ancient evil,
Wicked and depraved

A race of demons
From beneath the waves
No longer lies in wait

Enslaving, Conquering, destroying,
Laying waste to the lands

Now that the book is opened
The last Nemedian's spell is broken

The last Nemedian druid's spell
That erased them from earth's memory well
The last Nemedian druid's spell
That bound them in his book of black

Our time has come!

The race of man has come and gone,
Has run its course
The sun's declining into dusk
Nocturnal chants proclaim remorse

Enslaving, Conquering, destroying,
Fury Fomoraigh

When the truth dies
The end draws near
And all will fall

When the truth dies
The race of men
Has come and gone

Just look into my burning eyes
And see what they have seen
In the past and in the future
Behold this dark horrific dream

Now that the book is opened
The last Nemedian's spell is broken

The last Nemedian druid's spell
That bound them in his book of black

A twisted race of ancient evil,
Wicked and depraved
A race of demons from beneath the waves
No longer lies in wait
The myriad futures will unfold
A nightmare of fomorian hordes

When the truth dies
The end draws near
And all will fall

When the truth dies
The race of men
Has come and gone

And the truth dies
The end is here
Fury Fomoraigh!
