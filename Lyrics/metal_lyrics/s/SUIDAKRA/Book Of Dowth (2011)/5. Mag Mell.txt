Their ancient souls have fought in vain
Now death and glory lead their way
The bloody plain of pillars crossed
To the west they will set sail

Forever young and strong,
Forever free from earthly law,
Without grief and sorrow,
In Mag Mell theyÂ´ll remain

The demons within are now without
With roars of triumph they move out
Into the realm of eternal bliss
To the otherworld where they shall live

Their evil ways will wither and decay
Vanished from memory, without a trace
Without sorrow nor pain,
To "Tobar Segais"

Yet where the stream of knowledge flows
A sixth salmon will swim forth
No longer will they live a lie
Their human guise will fade, fade and die

Forever young and strong,
Forever free from earthly law,
Without grief and sorrow,
In Mag Mell theyÂ´ll remain
