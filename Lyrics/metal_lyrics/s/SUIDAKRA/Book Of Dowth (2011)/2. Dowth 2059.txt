The fairy mound of darkness
The hidden shrine unbound
In the name of science
The book of black was found

Beneath the stone of seven suns
Unveiling that which lies beyond
The reach of eyes, the reach of ears,
What we wish to be and become

The book of Dowth is calling
It beckons me to look inside
The book of Dowth is yearning
To sow its seed into my mind

A secret spring of unknown tales
Of heroes, queens and ancient lore
Of knowledge passed on
From stars to stones

The deed is done
Blackened pages
Wither before my gaze
A black fog rises
Evoking memories from distant times
I see history unfold
Dark shadows reach out and scar my mind

The book of Dowth is calling
It beckons me to look inside
The book of Dowth is yearning
To sow its seed into my mind

My soul spirals into a darkness
Deeper and blacker
Than any I have ever known
Beyond my inner limit
Beyond the secrets of the stones

The deed is done
Blackened pages
Wither before my gaze
A black fog rises
Evoking memories from distant times
I see history unfold
Dark shadows reach out and scar my mind

The book of Dowth is calling
It beckons me to look inside
The book of Dowth is yearning
To sow its seed into my mind

I see the serpent's return to Erin
Cenn cruach, the lord of the mound
I see the distant future
Ravens screaming over blood

Excavation, desecration,
Lebor Dubhadh unbound
Dowth 2059
