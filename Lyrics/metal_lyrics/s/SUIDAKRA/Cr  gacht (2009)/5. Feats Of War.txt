I bid thee welcome,
Valorous one
I scried your arrival
And know what must be done

So swear your allegiance
And you may remain
I will give you my guidance
For a year and a day

Now enter my fortress
And stand by my side
I've never before
Met a warrior so proud

Swear your allegiance
And you may remain
I will give you my guidance
For a year and a day

Oh brave young Cuchulainn
Day by day you learn more
Such courage and such vigour
I train and I teach you all feats of war

Come let me show you
Crafts of battle lore
Sword-edge and shield rim
The grand deeds of war

Swear your allegiance
And you may remain
I give you all my guidance
For a year and a day

Oh brave young Cuchulainn
Day by day you learn more
Such strength and such honour
I train and I teach you all feats of war

Now there's only one skill left
Most terrible of all
Barbed spear, Gae Bolg
The deadliest feat to call

You've sworn your allegiance
And you have remained
I gave you all my guidance
For a year and a day

So now I will have nothing
To teach you no more
Such courage and vigour
Strength and such honour
All heroes shall hear
Of your deeds of war

The only champion
Improved to perfection
The greatest warrior you are
For now you have learned
All my feats of war

Now you have learned
All my feats of war
