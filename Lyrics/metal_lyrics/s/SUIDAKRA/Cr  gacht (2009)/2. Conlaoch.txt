I am history turned into legend
I am victory and fire, the future and desire
I am triumph and honour
I am memory turned into myth
I am Conlaoch

On the streams of time I ride
My fate unveiled before my eyes
Suffering neither rebirth nor demise
Death's peace will never be mine

While my soul soars high
Amazed I glimpse my life pass by
Forever proud and ever free
I heed the call of the Daoine Sidhe

I am history turned into legend
I am victory and fire, the future and desire
I am triumph and honour
I am memory turned into myth
I am Conlaoch

As I lay slain upon the sacred shore
Leaving behind my body
From this empty shell to dimensions unknown
I still hear my father's grievous roar

"I am Cuchulainn
Beside the raging sea I'm left to moan
Sorrow I am for I brought down my only son
A raven I see above the stone"

For ages now I watch and learn
As history transpires
Man's greatest curse is to long
For what he can never acquire
For ages now I watch and learn
As destiny unveils
Man's greatest virtue to aspire
To chase his dream and make it real

I am history turned into legend
I am victory and fire, the future and desire
I am triumph and honour
I am memory turned into myth
I am Conlaoch

And while my soul soars high
By geasa no longer bound
I answer the call
Of the masters of the mounds

I am heir of DÃºn Dealgan
And thus my death was brought about
