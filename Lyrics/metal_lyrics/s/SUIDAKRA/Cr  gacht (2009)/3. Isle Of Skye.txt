To the Land Of Shadows once he came
Young warrior of Erin
With valour, honour and strength
Cuchulainn was his name

To win the heart of fair Emer
The Plain Of Ill-luck he crossed
To search for knowledge of war

The Perilous Glen he traversed
Then guided by Lugh, one fatherly hand
His scorched path he followed to the
... Isle Of Skye

Yonder,
The scholars were gathered
Among them Ferdiad,
The Firbolg who was his friend:
"Welcome Hound of Culan,
I hope you'll stay by our side
Beyond the Bridge Of Leaps,
ScÃ¡thach's stronghold you'll find on the
... Isle Of Skye

All by yourself you must stride
Not challenge fate with false pride
Beware of the bridge to reach the far side

All by yourself be your own guide
To make the Salmon leap up high
ScÃ¡thach you'll find on the Isle of Skye"

CrÃ³gacht!

Three times over Cuchulainn tried and failed
And at the fourth attempt he finally prevailed

To the Land Of Shadows once he came
Young warrior of Erin
With valour, honour and strength
Cuchulainn was his name

Yonder,
The scholars were gathered
Among them Ferdiad,
the Firbolg who was his friend:
"Welcome Hound of Culan,
I hope you'll stay by our side

Beyond the Bridge Of Leaps,
ScÃ¡thach's stronghold you'll find on the
... Isle Of Skye"

To win the heart of fair Emer
The Plain Of Ill-luck he crossed
To search for knowledge of war

The Perilous Glen he traversed
Then guided by Lugh, one fatherly hand
His scorched path he followed to the
... Isle Of Skye

But little did the hero know
What tragedy upon him
Fate would one day bestow...
