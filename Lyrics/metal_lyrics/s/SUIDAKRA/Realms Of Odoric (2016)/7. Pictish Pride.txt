A dark force grows deep in the woods
Foreshadowing impending doom
Invaders from the eastern lands
We shall never bow to them

Our homesteads burn, we must unite
The pictish drums resound
We paint our skin with battle-runes
To fight the dark force in the woods

One tribe, one mind
We stand and fight
We live or die
For pictish pride

Now a dark force rules the pictish tribes
Too many of our kin have died
Invaders from the eastern lands
Dishonored we must bow to them

One tribe, one mind
We stand and fight
We live or die
For pictish pride

One tribe, one mind
Enslaved we fight
We live or die
For pisces-ra

One tribe, one mind
We sacrifice
For pisces-ra
