My end began
Now seven years ago
You left me for the eastern war
Why did you have to go?

Time is moving ever forward
I can't imagine where you've been
Past is forged with each decision
I can't conceive the things you've seen

All those nights spent wondering
Wouls I see you once again?
All those days of longing
To be with you again

My end began
Now seven years ago
You left me for the eastern war
Will you ever see your son?

My love, we finally meet again
But how to make you understand
That whatever my decisions
I will lose you in the end

You're not how I remember
No emotions in your stare
Light has vanished from your eyes
It's like I am not even there

However short our time together
I will enjoy it and belong
I want to live life to the fullest
For I've waited much too long

My mind keeps dwelling on the future
Oh how to make you comprehend
That whatever my decisions
I always lose you in the end

No matter all the things we went through
No matter how hard that it's been
No matter all the things we've lost
We'll make it worth it in the end

I will keep looking for the answer
I will try and try again
There must be another way
Even if time and space must end...

No matter all the things we went through
No matter how hard that it's been
No matter all the things we've lost
We'll make it worth it in the end

Even if time and space must end
I'll be forever by your side
Life has no meaning without death
My love
Everyone must die...
