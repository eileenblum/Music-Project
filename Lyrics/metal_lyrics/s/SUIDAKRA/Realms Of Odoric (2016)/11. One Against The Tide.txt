Defending the realm against the hordes
Born from tales and ancient lore
Defying the tide with pitch black blade
Out of the mists a brave one came

By his command our soldiers charged
Hurling themselves at the enemy's heart
Across the sacred moors they flowed
Taking the shape of the trident of old

Leading his men into the maws of death
He himself was head of the attack
Behind him, the living trident roared
Born from tales and ancient lore

Born from tales and ancient lore

Defending the realm against the hordes
Born from tales and ancient lore
Defying the tide with pitch black blade
Out of the mists a brave one came

No dread left of maiming his own men
When the last of the cimbric soldiers fell
No reason to hold back the boiling rage
Leaving battered bodies in his wake

Wielding his blackened serpent sword
Radiating a sacred force
Mowing down waves of savage picts
Burning green fire from within

Burning green fire from within

Defending the realm against the hordes
Born from tales and ancient lore
Defying the tide with pitch black blade
Out of the mists a brave one came

Bearing the serpent mark of old
Out of the war a legend rose
Ending the hordes with a final blow
Into the mists the brave one strode

One strong rock to break the tide
Commiting the ultimate sacrifice
Only his shattered helm remains
We peay for his return one day
