In the dark woods
In the dead of night
The hunter's horde is stalking

In the dark woods
In the dead of night
The hunter's horde is out for blood

Crawling, stumbling in the shadows
A fallen legion's last few men
Swallowed up by savage woods
Wading through the gates of hell

Dodging hails of silent arrows
Facing overhelming odds
Chased by ruthless pictish fiends
Striking at them from the dark

In the dark woods
In the dead of night
The hunter's horde is stalking...

In the dark woods
In the dead of night
The hunter's horde is out for blood!

Preying on the wounded soldiers
Picking victims one by one
Hunting them like frightened creatures
Answering the hunter's call

In the dark woods
In the dead of night
can you hear, the hunter's calling!

In the dark woods
In the dead of night
The hunter's calling out for blood!

Escape towards the coming dawn
To the great Darcanian wall
At the edge of the dark hell
Where redemption awaits us all

In the dark woods
In the dead of night
can you hear, the hunter's calling!

In the dark woods
In the dead of night
The hunter's calling out for blood!

Crawling, stumbling from the shadows
A fallen legion's last few men
Emerging from the wildwood
Returning from the gates of hell

Prey turns into predator
Only instinct drives them forth
Reborn more beast than man
They survived the hunter's call

In the dark woods
In the dead of night...
