A lifetime spent in battle
Dedicated to his men
Commander of the royal guard
Each day could be his last

A good man shaped by warfare
Devoted to the realm
Commander of the Kaduzar
Each day he welcomes death

Lion Of Darcania
Warrior with no match
Born to protect our emperor
Our people and our land

The lion Of Darcania
A warrior with no match
The lion of Darcania
The hero known as Drackx

Defeated by the eastern horde
The empire has fallen
He failed to protect the realm
And still he welcomes death

Lion Of Darcania
Warrior with no match
Determined to put an end to war
Avenger of the realm

The lion Of Darcania
A warrior with no match
The lion of Darcania
The hero known as Drackx

That day he swore a solemn oath
A vow upon his blood stained sword
To leave behind his pain and doubt
Command the guard one final time

Darcanian phalanx!
Shiled and spear raised high!

That day he swore a solemn oath
A vow upon his blood stained sword
To break the enemy's battle lines
Defend the realm one final time
