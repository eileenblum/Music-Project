Standing tall on Ankrath's walls
An inward journey begins
There is clarity in solitude
My strength and spirit soars

Ancient wisdom
Born from deep within my bones
Marching on with sole defiance
Ever forward unto dawn...

Oh, how to shape our destiny
And choose for ill or good
Oh, how to end this tyranny
Without becoming a tyrant myself?

This life is but a spiral path
The serpent lurks inside
A road towards eternity
The future is the past

Standing at this dim threshold
An inward river flows
There is honesty in solitude
My strength and spirit calls

Ancient power
Born from deep within this sword
Marching on with sole defiance
Ever forward into war...

Oh, how to earn eternity
This torment to endure
Oh, how to face this evil horde
Without turning to evil myself?

This life is but a spiral path
The serpent lurks inside
A road towards eternity
The future is the past

Oh, how to deceive mortality
This sacrifice and doom
Oh, how to end this wrathful god
Without becoming godlike myself
