Our father's sacrifice in vain
Our burning city lost in flames
Our funeral pyre lights the sky
Our blood must never, ever dry

Oh, can you hear the clashing swords?
The battle cries and horns of war?
The stench of death is in the air
Invading our ancestral lands...

No time to mourn our fallen kin
The slaughter of the innocents
And tough our clan may not remain
The blood of battle warms our veins

A war is raging in our home
No time to cry, no time to mourn
We'll honour our glorious past
We'll fight to the very, very last

Our father's sacrifice in vain
Our burning city lost in flames
Our funeral pyre lights the sky
Our blood must never, ever dry

Oh, can you hear the clashing swords?
The battle cries and horns of war?
We'll guard our city and defend
Dauntless we will face this threat

Our sacrifice won't be in vain
It's better to die than live as slaves
And even though our end is nigh
We'll throw ourselves into the fight

No time to mourn our fallen kin
The slaughter of the innocents
Our broken hearts will never mend
But dauntless we will face our end

Our father's sacrifice in vain
Our burning city lost in flames
Our funeral pyre lights the sky
Our blood must never, ever dry
