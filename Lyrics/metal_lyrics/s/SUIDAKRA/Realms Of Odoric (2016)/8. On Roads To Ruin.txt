The final conflict is at hand
My way of life comes to an end
Embracing darkness to survive
Emrace the night to stay alive

Carried off...
Into slavery
No hopes, no dreams...
Just death and fear

Becoming darkness to survive
Become the wolf to stay alive
I'll live or die... in hate and pain
In the end... only ruins will remain

On roads to ruin

The final conflict is at hand...
My way of life comes to an end
Emrace the night to stay alive
Embracing darkness to survive

Carried off...
Into slavery
No hopes, no dreams...
Just death and fear

Become the wolf to stay alive
Becoming darkness to survive
I'll live or die... in hate and pain
In the end... only ruins will remain

I'll live or die in vain...
Only ruins remain
