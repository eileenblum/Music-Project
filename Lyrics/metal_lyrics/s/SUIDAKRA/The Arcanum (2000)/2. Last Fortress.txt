[Music &amp; Lyrics by Suidakra]

A petrified spell
here where the stormwinds yell
the crown of the reef and the land it defies

High and statly
the claw of the sea
reach for the stars to distant skies

Rising worlds behind my closed eyes
a kingdom an island in an ocean of decay
falling through ages my curse and delight
to escape for a while the bleak neon light

Taste of life is bitter sometimes
so take your heart
and your mind to bury it somewhere
tear your soul apart

sometimes when the main is roaring
hear them moan to fall awake
fighting with persistant power
the joy of someone is the otherones sake
