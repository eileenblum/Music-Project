[Music &amp; Lyrics by Suidakra]

Enter the circle
Banish all fright - of the night
Shadows whirl around
Hunting and chasing the remained light

Fall into the darkness
Severed of reality
Sable spirits dance around
Laughing at your velleity

They arouse all secret fears
The innermost blemish
Another phantom born in light
Changes to the other side

And through a maze
Of howling images
Through times of old
Lies the arcanum unfold

Attacked by discord
Which devours your heart
Crawl in despair
To follow the light

Aberrant mind
Paralysed by fear
Another soul is struck
With the burden of sight

Seasons of fire and ice
Rise from the past into life
Companions of reality
Guardian of our time
Memories of misery
Shall be our sword and shield

[Lead: Arkadius]
