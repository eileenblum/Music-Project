[Music &amp; Lyrics by Suidakra]

Time changes
while we forge our fate
passing the gates

We set fire
betrayed our past
in the Illusion that nothing will last

[Chorus...]
See, the night is alight
with our stateless flames
we killed our gods
buried their names

Thousands of years
filled up our lore
while we`re marching through
the gates of nevermore

A heir to the crown roams all alone
the blade of enlightment banished the shades
lost in a maze, in a dreamless embrace
oblivion - the tomb of our three fates

All glittering wonders are finally shrouded
lying wasted under a brocken spell
our gods at the sky only fire and rock
all beauty must die - wecome to hell

[Chorus]
