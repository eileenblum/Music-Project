[Music &amp; Lyrics by Suidakra]

Fear his words
creating worlds
for now and ever a living memory

Holding the crown
he reigns all alone
one man, one will but no destiny

Straight through the memories of woe
into the fields of buried glee
here the wilting dreams below
source and ending of this story

Fall down to your knees to adore the lie
Fill the power and right to reign in violence
time and failure have sharpened our mind
disarmed and voicless it finally has to rest in silence

Hear the tales of thousands and one death
of revange and wreath
see the veils which cover our mind
silently making us blind

Silentium est aurum
step back to where it once began
silentium est aurum
the adornment in our requiem

So die in lies...

He`s creeping through the dephts of living
holding out until the end
no remorse and no forgiving
all he learned is to pretend
