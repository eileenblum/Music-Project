[Music &amp; Lyrics by Suidakra]

See the winter is coming
Falling leaves dance to a silent tune
I`ll take their hands I`ll make them stand
When they`re all alone
Years passed and the dawn of light
Spread through time to leave tales behind

The Queen of witches
Gathered the wisdom
For a year and a day
Gwion takes care of the cauldron

The spell is broken
Flown into the youth
They`re hunting and chasing
Through the hills and braes

The queen of witches
swallowed the young lad
So in year and a day
Taliesin the wise rose from the dead

[Chorus:]
Praise the one who breaks the circle
The one who dyes all grey away
Laud the army of dwarves and elves
Companions for the final day

Now see the man in legends veiled
A wise, a brave, of fortune hailed
Now hear the man and his flaming rhyme
Divinely anthems for glorious times

The king of mortal
And the source of wisdom
For a year and a day
Taliesin`s the guard of the cauldron

[Chorus]
