[Music &amp; Lyrics by Suidakra]

Somewhere in time along the trace
Of decay to a darker land
Exchange the mystery with human tragedy
A regal path to an dead end

Streams of fire from the eldest time
They merge right here
To pour the seeds of Death

Their sight and breath
An anthem to the kill
To finally pass the crown
To the emptiness

Oh here it lies, veiled in madness
On the edge of sanitys precipice
Oh here they fly, on shadow wings
Eternity echoes of their cries

Worship the tempest
Feel the rapture of almightness
To burn out and fall
For their triumphal call

Here is the darkest creature
Reality ever beared
Full of hate and wrath
An herold of death

For the dragonbreed
Has grown in ashes
They bear the evil seeds
To fulefill the curs
...To ravage the earth
