Don't crucify yourself for what you have become
Because the one who is without sin shall throw the first stone
I always said - I never had these bad intentions
that I'm what I am and what you see right now
it's not an illusion
Your identity makes you stronger
and what you believe - this may come to live
Another perfect day to save the world
This is what we're fighting for?
Another perfect day to save the world
This is who I am
Can you even bare the disgrace
Falls like grey shades from my eyes
The weight on my shoulders becomes grievous
Like a thousand stones

So this is who you are - nothing further to say
You're coming my way - nothing can stop me anyway
Hold on
I always said I never felt this way
That we're trying to remain
I cast a stone at everything single way
But we're trying to remain - remain strong

Can you even bare the disgrace
Falls like grey shades from my eyes
The weight on my shoulders becomes grievous
And every breath you take, and every word you said
This is just meaningless by now
Never fucking tried to realize this is me - you're fighting against
Over and over - again and again - this is me - you're fighting against

Hold on
I always said I never felt this way
That we're trying to remain
I cast a stone at everything single way
But we're trying to remain - remain strong

Blinded by your lights - close my eyes
