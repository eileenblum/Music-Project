Hopefully you choke on all the words you told me
Just don't forget where you came from
Cause it's a long way home
You think you re better than the rest
I thought you were my inspiration

But with time comes insight and clarity
You've made a mess of my own
Your confession is worthless by now
Now listen to me shut your fucking mouth
You've made a mess of my own
This time it comes to an end

And there is no excuse for what you have done
You left me broken when I just needed someone
When everything is needless
And just comes with a price
So why should I believe in you
You've made all mistakes twice

Who is the one to blame?
It's not me - you fucking peace of shit
I will burn it down
Burn it to the fucking ground
It feels like you want to crown yourself by your foolish actions
Leave everything behind, your glasshouse will fall into a thousand pieces
Burn this city down to the ground
Burn it to the ground
Burn this city down

And there is no excuse for what you have done
You left me broken when I just needed someone
When everything is needless
And just comes with a price
So why should I believe in you
You've made all mistakes twice
I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel
I don't wanna take this anymore
For tonight, For tonight

The downfall of me is the downfall of you
