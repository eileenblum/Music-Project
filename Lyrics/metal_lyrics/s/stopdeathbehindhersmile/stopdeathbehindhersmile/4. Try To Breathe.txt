Can't hold me back, I'm living in a nightmare on my own
You're lying - you're lying to me
I hope you realize your absolute failure
You're lying - you're lying to me
You cant behold on what you've said
For the first time in my life - For the first time it feels all right
Everything you ever said is a lie and becomes meaningless

And this is for the first time, when everything feels all right
When everything is said and just done - well nothing can stop me
When everything is said and just done - I'm not gonna stay

I feel, I feel like there's no turning back
I feel, I feel like there's no turning back
I feel, I feel like there's no turning back
There is no turning back

You're lying - you're lying to me
I hope you realize your absolute failure.
You're lying - you're lying to me
You cant behold on what you've said

My hands are tied
And I try to breathe
My hands are tied
And I just fucking try to breathe
In and out - In and out
Through my lungs - I try to breathe in and out
I try to fucking breathe

Place your hands where I can see them
Cause I don't want your knife in my back

For the first time in my life - For the first time it feels all right
I feel, I feel like there's no turning back
I feel, I feel like there's no turning back
I feel, I feel like there's no turning back
There is no turning back - no
There is no turning back from here
