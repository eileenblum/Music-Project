You can stare at the sky
And hope someone comes falling down
To grant you a wish
But this ain't happening to you
this ain't happening to you..

You can not dream of a better world in your hands
You can not dream of all the things you just want them to be
I can't see right through your eyes anymore
but can I see and feel the regrets in their heads?

Ref. These are the words,
These are the words we trusted in
but it was just a waste of time
these are the lies, these are the lies
you told us so..
but everything - everything ends tonight

and while all the colors fade away
and all the ashes become grey
we are the once who stand up front
we are the living hope for some
heart beats faster as time's running out
to you with open arms
These are the words - but it was just a waste of time

what you want from me..
what do you want from me
I can't see what you want from me
and I'm falling faster
and I'm falling faster than before
I can't see the light from down here, from down here
and I'm falling faster
and I'm falling faster than before
bring me aside - bring me aside
I am falling down
and I'm falling faster
and I'm falling faster than before
bring me aside - bring me aside
I am falling down

Ref. These are the words,
These are the words we trusted in
but it was just a waste of time
these are the lies, these are the lies
you told us so
but everything - everything ends tonight
