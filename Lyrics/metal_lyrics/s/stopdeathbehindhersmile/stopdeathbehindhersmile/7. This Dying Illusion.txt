[feat. Sven Beichel By Bury My Regrets]I can't back up and I can't fall asleep by now
All I've done and all I've seen
This decision I've made I can't refrain
Can't close my eyes in front of you now
I can't refuse, dreams make me fall apart
I can't refuse, cause you're fucking out of my mind
Let me out, this illusion falls apart
like I am bleeding, on and on I can't go on
but this ain't in time

And maybe I'm dreaming and maybe this ain't so real
to feel you by my side
could you just say I am what you deserve
I wanna be by your side I wanna just stay with you tonight
And you're making this feel like I am just a single moment of your fucking life
Alight this single moment

what do you thing makes you better than me
what do you thing you can't tell me those lies..
I ain't what you want..
This ship is going down
bleed it out I can't refuse on my own
I can't find what you're searching for in your life
That s what all dreams are made for
But you can't run for your life

This ain't more than imagination to you
You get blinded by the lights of your impression
That's where you become a fool

And maybe I'm dreaming and maybe this ain't so real
to feel you by my side
could you just say I am what you deserve
I wanna be by your side I wanna just stay with you tonight
And you're making this feel like
A am just a single moment of your life
And I can finally see where we will be
Dreaming on for you to say my final words

When I'm dreaming of you then I see the better side
When I'm seeing you I can finally breathe in deep
