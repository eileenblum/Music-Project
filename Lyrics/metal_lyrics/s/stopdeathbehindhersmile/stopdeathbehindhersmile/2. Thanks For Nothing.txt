And I'm trying, I'm trying so hard.
How could you sleep at night
with those pictures on your mind.
I can not find the reason to just try
I can not find the reason to just try

Don't u feel betrayed by your selfish actions

Ref. And I'm trying, I'm trying so hard
How could you sleep at night
With those pictures on your mind
I do, I do thank you for nothing at all
I do, I do thank you for nothing at all

When the curtain falls it's not me
Being judged by your missing empathy
This is leading nowhere by now
You should have listened to my prayers somehow

You are who you are, guided by decisions you've made.
Choose by your heart not by their expectations,
They don't know how to feel alive

And when everyone is jumping the bridge, is it you going first?
Because it's me - laughin' my ass off, when you hit the ground

I will live a live you're never able to pass, you're never able to pass.
Don't you feel betrayed?

Ref. And I'm trying, I'm trying so hard
How could you sleep at night
With those pictures on your mind
I do, I do thank you for nothing at all
I do, I do thank you for nothing at all

Thank you for nothing, for nothing at all - no
This is my deepest wish - This is my deepest wish
