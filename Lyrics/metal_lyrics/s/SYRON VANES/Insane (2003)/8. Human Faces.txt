Black and empty skies.
Reflects the modern ground.
Just where anxious voices.
Makes a distant sound.
Nature out of time.
Crying deep inside.
Wounded by the faith.
In a better world.

Human faces.
Looking sad.
Human faces.
Feels so bad.
Human faces.
I donât know why.
Human faces.
Shrunk by the fact that theyâre gonna die.

Tears are falling down.
Peoples burned out skin.
Occupied by the race.
Nobody wins.
Empty eyes are staring.
At their equal sign.
âCaused by the nature.
Of our selfish minds.

Human faces.
Looking sad.
Human faces.
Feels so bad.
Human faces.
I donât know why.
Human faces.
Shrunk by the fact that theyâre gonna die.

Desperate hearts crying out loud.
Shattered dreams created by the crowd.
Lost emotions are never coming back.
Masses of terrorized souls.
Only believes in the truth of the dead.
