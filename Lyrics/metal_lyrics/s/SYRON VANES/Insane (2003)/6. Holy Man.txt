I ainât right about the truth.
Talking âbout some substitute.
Listen to what I have to say.
Move in my direction.
Believe in my protection.
Come on join the big parade.

I wanna show you love.
I wanna give you all.
Youâve got to pray for the holy man.

I have told a million lies.
Talked about the heavens rise.
Everybody praise my words.
Not a single one complain.
Whoâs the one thatâs insane.
Come on join the big charade.

I wanna show you love.
I wanna give you all.
Youâve got to pray for the holy man.
