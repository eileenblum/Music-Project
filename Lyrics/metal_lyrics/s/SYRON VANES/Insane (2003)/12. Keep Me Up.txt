Sexy dress gonna take you around the world.
Sexy bodies gonna do me so Iâve heard.
Over and over again, canât get enough.
Didnât know that you could be so rough.

Iâve got something I  wanna say.
Hey baby canât you stay.

Get on top, keep me up.
Whatever you wanna do Iâll do it to.

Wanna see you down sitting on my face.
Some say that itâs a big disgrace.
And when you put your hand where it belong.
It feels so good it canât be wrong.

Iâve got something I  wanna say.
Hey baby canât you stay.

Get on top, keep me up.
Whatever you wanna do Iâll do it to.

They call me a bad boy.
They call me dangerous to.
