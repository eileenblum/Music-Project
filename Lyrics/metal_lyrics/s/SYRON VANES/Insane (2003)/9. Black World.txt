Iâve been asleep all my life.
Ainât asking for much, havenât felt the knife.
Iâve never been inspired by the rich.
Donât give a damned âbout the common leach.

Had no communication.
Never made a creation.
Lacked imagination.
Iâm no big sensation.

Donât understand who is it for.
I am lost in a black world.

Dreaming about simplicity.
Talking about humanity.

Had no communication.
Never made a creation.
Lacked imagination.
Iâm no big sensation.
