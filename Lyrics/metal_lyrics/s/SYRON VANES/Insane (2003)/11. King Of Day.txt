Never cried, only lied.
Just been a mean kind of man.
No rules, just cruel.
Iâve got this wonderful kind of twang.

Ainât got no sympathy.

Donât mess, confess that things are going my way.
So sad, to bad I ainât gonna change.
I am all the day.

The holy sky is turning grey.
Thatâs why Iâm going to be the king of day.

Never chance to lose that is the way I like to live.
Donât cry just try, thatâs what I believe.
Donât need society.

The holy sky is turning grey.
Thatâs why Iâm going to be the king of day.

No command is my obey.
Bad religion is my pray.
Thereâs no price for me to pay.
Thereâs no need to kill the day.
The holy sky is turning grey.

Thatâs why Iâm going to be the king of day.
