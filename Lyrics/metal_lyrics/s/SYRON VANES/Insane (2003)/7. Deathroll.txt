Enemies track you down anywhere.
Thereâs no sleep until sacrifice.
Memories about the times gone by.
Reflects the fear thatâs in your eyes.

Deathroll.
Itâs got to be.
Deathroll.
Insanity.
Deathroll.
It has to be.
Deathroll.
Emergency.

Miseries hang on to your soul.
Praying hard doesnât seems to heal.
Humanity is no sacred thing.
only chains is for real.

Deathroll.
Itâs got to be.
Deathroll.
Insanity.
Deathroll.
It has to be.
Deathroll.
Emergency.

Crossing fire bit by bit.
Denying feels no sweat.
Did I try to lift the sky.
Canât explain why itâs still alive.

Deathroll.
Itâs got to be.
Deathroll.
Insanity.
Deathroll.
It has to be.
Deathroll.
Emergency.
