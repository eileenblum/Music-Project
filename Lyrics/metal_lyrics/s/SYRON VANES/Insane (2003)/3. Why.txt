Floating around in places.
Beyond the wildest dreams.
Donât follow the same old traces.
Leave it to the memories.

Stretch for the way to freedom.
Wipe out the angry tears.
Not good just leave âem.
Need another hundred years.

Donât wanna cry again.
Donât need to try again.
Take away the pain.
Turn on a new light and never ever wonder.

Why do we need to try.
Until we fade and die.
Why canât we live in another space and time.

Climb to the higher mountains.
Show the way to go.
Reach for life perfection.
Stay away from anything low.

Donât wanna cry again.
Donât need to try again.
Take away the pain.
Turn on a new light and never ever wonder.

Why do we need to try.
Until we fade and die.
Why canât we live in another space and time.

Donât wanna cry again.
Donât need to try again.
Take away the pain.
Turn on a new light and never ever wonder.

Why do we need to try.
Until we fade and die.
Why canât we live in another space and time.
