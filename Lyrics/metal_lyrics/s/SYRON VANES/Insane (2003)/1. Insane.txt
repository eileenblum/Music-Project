You better answer, donât put me on hold.
Tell me is it true now, the things Iâve been told.
Now will they frame us or will they understand.
You better stop now things going out of hands.

I could try just to get it right.
Wonât give up,  not without a fight.
I donât know why I canât explain.
Show you my heart, show you my pain.

Itâs insane.

Break out of this mess, stop playing this game.
Just let it go now âcause itâs a burning shame.
Itâs like a tide gate Iâm  not coming through.
Iâm still running to get through to you.

I could try just to get it right.
Wonât give up,  not without a fight.
I donât know why I canât explain.
Show you my heart, show you my pain.
Itâs insane.
Itâs insane.
Itâs insane.
Itâs insane.
âcause itâs insane.
I could try itâs insane.
Wonât give up, itâs insane
Donât know why.
