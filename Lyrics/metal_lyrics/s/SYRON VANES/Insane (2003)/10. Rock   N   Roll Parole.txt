I can make the devil turn back.
âCause in the ringside we are all dressed black.
And my behavior isnât always the best.
Donât ever listen to your request.

I am out for a day or two.
That is why Iâm coming after you.
Iâm going in with a death spin.
It doesnât matter if I lose or win.

Out, on rockânâroll parole.
Out, on rockânâroll parole.

There is nothing you can do.
Take cover thatâs my advice to you.
One night is all I ever need.
Then Iâll rock you, hold on to your creed.

I am out for a day or two.
That is why Iâm coming after you.
Iâm going in with a death spin.
It doesnât matter if I lose or win.

Out, on rockânâroll parole.
Out, on rockânâroll parole.

I left my conscious behind.
And I left a trace that is easy to find.

I am out for a day or two.
That is why Iâm coming after you.
Iâm going in with a death spin.
It doesnât matter if I lose or win.

Out, on rockânâroll parole.
Out, on rockânâroll parole.
