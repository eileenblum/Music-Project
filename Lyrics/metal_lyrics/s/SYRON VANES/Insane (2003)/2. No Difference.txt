Ainât feeling anything.
I know Iâm not blind.
I donât hear a thing.
Thereâs no answer to find.

No one wants to know.
It makes no difference.
No one seems to care.
It makes no difference.

Aint feeling no shame.
Iâm not that shy.
Ainât nobody to blame.
Thereâs no wondering why.

No one wants to know.
It makes no difference.
No one seems to care.
It makes no difference.

No difference
