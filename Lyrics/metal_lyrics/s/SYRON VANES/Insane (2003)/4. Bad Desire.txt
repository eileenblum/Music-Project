Override âcause the lightning strikes.
And Iâm the one who knows what everybody likes.
Mean born guy performs the dance of death.
Repulsive act so just hold your breath.

Iâve got this bad desire
When Iâm aiming higher.
And when I aim and fire.
Iâve got this bad desire.

Donât you try to tie me down.
One mistake and I will blow this town.
So put up or shut up.
âcause failure is not on my map.

Iâve got this bad desire.
When Iâm aiming higher.
And when I aim and fire.
Iâve got this bad desire.

Bad desire.
Iâve got this bad desire.
Bad desire.
