No way out and no way in.
Searching for a time full of sin.
Lifeâs no good so far away.
Walking the night to another day.

Full of rage and full of pain.
Compromising driving me insane.
Danger is my kind of game.
Win or lose doesnât seems the same.

Ainât feeling strong.
 Thereâs something wrong.
Judged overhead.
No reason to kill the dead.

Strapped up in chains, whipped by the rain.
Burned by the sun, nowhere to run.
No guarantee no place to be.
Faith just crashed as a part of me.

Ainât feeling strong.
 Thereâs something wrong.
Judged overhead.
No reason to kill the dead.
