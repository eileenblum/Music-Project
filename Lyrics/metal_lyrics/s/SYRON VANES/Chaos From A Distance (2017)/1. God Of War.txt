The light is deadly,
The sky opens up.
Darkness settles over the heroes who fight.

Out on the fire,
Into the hell.
Combat the legion and defend your rights. 

The writing's on the wall.
Unholy child will fall.
The scream of the devil
Echoes through flesh and blood.

[2x]
God of war.
Across the battlefield.

Take cover from the crossfire,
Don't become a victim of the guardian of evil.
Reclaim the power from the holy ghost.
Spread your wings like the freedom of an eagle.

The writing's on the wall.
Unholy child will fall.
The scream of the devil
Echoes through flesh and blood.

God of war.
Across the battlefield.
On the ride of death.
God of war.
Across the battlefield.
Let the hated take the last breath.

In for the kill.
Pain and despair will clash into the night.
Sing the battle hymn, stand ready in line.
Don't fear the enemy, head for the light.

The writing's on the wall.
Unholy child will fall.
The scream of the devil
Echoes through flesh and blood.

God of war.
Across the battlefield.
God of war.
Across the battlefield.
On the ride of death.
Let the hated take the last breath.

God of war.
Across the battlefield.
Across the battlefield.
God of war.
Across the battlefield.
Let the hated take the last breath.
