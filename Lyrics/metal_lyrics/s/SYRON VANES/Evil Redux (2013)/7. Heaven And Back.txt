IÂ´ve spread my wings  across the universe.
Watching the world collide, for better or for worse.
Walked into red fire on the way to Babylon.
Fighting my demonÂ´s while crossing the midnight sun.

Riding on the lost track.
Signing of the contract.
Hear the bells ringing.
The voices of angels calling.

IÂ´ve been to heaven and back
Crossing the sky in the blink of an eye.
IÂ´ve been to heaven and back.
Breaking into the speed of the light.

Waiting to throw the final wrecking ball.
Time to face the master, the writings on the wall.
Standing in the middle of a minefield.
Watching the hole in the sky dissolve my shield.

Riding on the lost track.
Signing of the contract.
Hear the bells ringing.
The voices of angels calling.

IÂ´ve been to heaven and back
Crossing the sky in the blink of an eye.
IÂ´ve been to heaven and back.
Breaking into the speed of the light.

Distant light shining above my head.
Black clouds building up to honor  the dead.
IÂ´ve been to heaven and back
Crossing the sky in the blink of an eye.

IÂ´ve been to heaven and back.
Breaking into the speed of the light.  II
