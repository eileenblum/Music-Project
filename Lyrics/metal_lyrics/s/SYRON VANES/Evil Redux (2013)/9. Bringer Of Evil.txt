Donât know where to go, lost in the middle of nowhere.
Donât wanna get back to the land of hate.
I saw the dark and felt the heat never lost my soul down there.
I wont go back I donât belong there.

Take me to a place where I am safe from hell.
Where I can live a life of love.
âcause down there is a fire and itâll keep on burning.
As long as mankind  believing.

Killing, ripping with the edge of the knife.
Kill his brother in a war.
Killing, ripping with the edge of the knife.
Kill his brother in a war.

I donât believe the voice of evil.
No donât listen to it.
I donât believe the voice of evil.
No donât listen to -

Bringer of evil.

I pray for another life, I hate the other side.
Never sell my soul to an evil man.
âcause down there is a fire and itâll keep on burning.
As long as mankind believing.

Killing, ripping with the edge of the knife.
Kill his brother in a war.
Killing, ripping with the edge of the knife.
Kill his brother .

I donât believe.
No I donât believe.
Bringer of evil.
