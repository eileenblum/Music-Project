Dark angel spellâs youâre name in blood.
Let the flames begin to burn your wings.
The devil rideâs besides telling you.
The story about the ruler of kings.

Self destruction.
Chain reaction.
Dissatisfaction.
Blood attraction.

Cry for the Hellion child.
Sympathy made of  steel.

No fire heals your stone cold heart.
Show no mercy only hate.
Thereâs a bomb exploding in your soul.
Donât need much to detonate.

Self destruction.
Chain reaction.
Dissatisfaction.
Blood attraction.

Feel the magic of the devilâs breath.
A tragic hero of sudden death.
Ride between heaven and hell.
Hear the sound of the ringerâs bell.

Cry for the Hellion child.
Cry for the Hellion child.
Sympathy made of  steel.
Cry for the Hellion child.
Power is the driving wheel.
Cry for the Hellion child.
Do you know if heâs for real.
Cry for the Hellion child.
Hellion child.
