This kind of place wasnât meant  for me, am I just paying a fee.
Another day, another life, another anything as far as I can see.
This case this time is it fiction or reality.
Give me a reason to believe , walking the night like a zombie.

Youâll never gonna stand a chance.
Being in a state of trance.
This is me, can you hear my voice.
Iâm gonna give you this last choice.

Race me to hell.
Or raise me to heaven.

With sinister mind and evil pride, wonât be a next time.
Itâs all a game , are you ready to lose. Are you ready for the next crime?
Preventing chaos, taking the oath a little late you see.
Iâve got all the demons by my side. There will never be another me.

Youâll never gonna stand a chance.
Being in a state of trance.
This is me, can you hear my voice.
Iâm gonna give you this last choice.

Race me to hell.
Or raise me to heaven.

All illusions.
No more options.
Black confusions.
Hot pollutions. 

Race me to hell.
Or raise me to heaven.
