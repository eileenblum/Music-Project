Where is the promised protection? weâve got no place to hide.
Hope slowly fading away, crying voices subdivide.
Into the darkest places, trying to facing our fears.
Thousand hearts are bleeding, living souls to disappear.

Save for your last breath, evil power is here to stay.
Prepare for your own death, time has come for the judgment day.

Look into your eyes, watch the flames begin.
Weâre gonna pay the price, fire burning on your skin.

Shadows of a broken dream.

Our destiny is written, by the master of pain.
Dark forces create illusions, locked up in ball and chain.

Save for your last breath, evil power is here to stay.
Prepare for your own death, time has come for the judgement day.

Look into your eyes, watch the flames begin.
Weâre gonna pay the price, fire burning on your skin.
Walk in the land of dust.
Thereâs no god we could trust.

Look into your eyes, watch the flames begin.
Weâre gonna pay the price, fire burning on your skin.

Shadows of a broken dream.
