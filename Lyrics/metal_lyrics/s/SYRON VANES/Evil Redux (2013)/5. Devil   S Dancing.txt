Like a moonstruck maniac prowling through the night.
Gonna give yourself a heart attack, running fast into the twilight.
Getting closer to this mythical place where no one ever survived.
Iâm standing on the road to hell, show me the way out of this spell.

Iâm burning learning Iâm the vital force of my evil belief.
Screaming, gleaming  sending you straight in to the pit of fire.
Feel the devilâs pounce, hear the  blasting echo bounce.

Devilâs dancing
When he reach his goal possessing your soul.
Devilâs dancing.
When you falling down.

Ever thought about the other side, must be a crazy ride.
If your heart becomes cold as ice, must be from all those lies.

Burning learning Iâm the vital force of my evil belief.
Screaming, gleaming  sending you straight in to the pit of fire.
Feel the devilâs pounce, hear the  blasting echo bounce.

Devilâs dancing.
Devilâs dancing.
Until you fall behind.
Devilâs dancing.
Heâs twisting your mind.
Devilâs dancing.
Reaching for you and all the others to.

The monster in your mind canât live unless  itâs fed by tyrant dreams.
Misprinted lies embrace the truth make believe in silent screams.

Devilâs dancing.
Devilâs dancing.
Canât you tell.
Devilâs dancing.
Canât you tell youâre on your way to hell.
