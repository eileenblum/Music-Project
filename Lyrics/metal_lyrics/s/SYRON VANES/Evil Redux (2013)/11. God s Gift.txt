Demonâs inside my head.
Whispers or voices itâs so hard to tell.
Take everything step by step.
Or soon start running straight to hell.

Iâm still inside this prison of mine.
Wandering around oh so blind.
I canât find the peace in my soul.
Deep down into the hole.

Godâs gift.
To mankind.
Godâs gift.
What did he have in mind.
Godâs gift.
So refined.

So hard to ease the pain.
Canât hold on Iâm losing my grip.
Tomorrow always looking grey.
Need to jump my abandon ship.

Iâm still inside this prison of mine.
Wandering around oh so blind.
I canât find the peace in my soul.
Deep down into the hole.

Godâs gift.
Left it all behind.
Godâs gift.
What did he have in mind.
Godâs gift.
So refined.
Godâs gift.
Prison of mine.

Black clouds in dark skies, hiding the sun.
Deep down  into dust, look in to the barrel of the gun.

[Chorus]
