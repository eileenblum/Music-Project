Staring at the concrete wall.
Burning shadows show the end of it all.
Fire over the land of death.
Pain and sorrow before the last breath.

The sign of the cross are defeated.
Evil is coming our way.
Sanctuary has been mistreated.
Who is going to pay?

This is the end of the world.
Hell is waiting for you.
This is the end of the world.
ThereÂ´s nothing you can do.

The ground is shaking by the blast.
Erase all the memories from the past.
Tears are running from the crying face.
Welcome to the last day of human race.

The sign of the cross are defeated.
Evil is coming our way.
Sanctuary has been mistreated.
Who is going to pay?

This is the end of the world.
Hell is waiting for you.
This is the end of the world.
Hear the cries, feel the pain

Who is going to pay?

This is the end of the world.
Hell is waiting for you.
This is the end of the world.
ThereÂ´s nothing you can do.
This is the end of the world.
Do you know itÂ´s the end of the world.
This is the end of the world.  
Who is going to pay?

This is the end of the world.
Doomed to dance with the devil.
This is the end of the world.  
Hear the cries, feel the pain.
