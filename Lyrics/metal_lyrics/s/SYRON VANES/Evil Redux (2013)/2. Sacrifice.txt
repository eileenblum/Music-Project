Down below heat rise and melt the ground.
Chaos reigns across the fields, hear the roaring sound.
Red fire burning, flames reach for the sky.
Thunder breaks the silence, when good and bad collide.

Rivers of blood across the nations.
All hell is breaking loose.
Unleash the final revelation.
Hear the destiny call.

Sacrifice.
Under the black sun.
Sacrifice.
Darkness is here to stay.
Sacrifice.
Forget the second coming.
Sacrifice.
Get down on your knees and pray.

Lightning strikes, crashing on the battlefield.
Say your prayer one by one, faith is already sealed.
Waiting for the messenger. Heâs got the news about death.
The ghost is leading the way, time to take the last breath.

Rivers of blood across the nations.
All hell is breaking loose.
Unleash the final revelation.
Hear the destiny call.

Sacrifice.
Under the black sun.
Sacrifice.
Darkness is here to stay.
Sacrifice.
Forget the second coming.
Sacrifice.
Get down on your knees and pray.
