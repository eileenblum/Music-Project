If you see me coming riding on the wind, run as fast as you can.
I am more than your master, one of a kind, a ruler since the age of man.
Made of stone and acid in my blood I know heaven can wait.
I need your fuel to my fire I just want it all, make me feel so great.

Hey child you never walk free, donât have what it takes.
Hey wild you will never find the key, a victim of all mistakes.
I am the first and you are the last.

King of it all
King of it all.
Power never seen.
King of it all.
King of it all.

Thereâs no sign of weakness never lose control. The perfect snake in the grass.
What if youâre dead Iâm not losing my head. Iâm not made of glass.
Give the beast some action let creature out, screaming out for thrills.
Like a killing machine ramming into steel, showing of some skills.

Hey child you never walk free, donât have what it takes.
Hey wild you will never find the key, a victim of all mistakes.
I am the first and you are the last.

King of it all
Iâm the king of it.
King of it all.
Power never seen.
King of it all.
Feel the pain.
King of it all.
I am the.
King of it all
King of it all.
