To stay or walk away.
And that decision, come some day.
Detonation will kill us all.
Hear the sound of the bells last call.

In my own mind I live in some kind, of place with grace, pride and glory.
Realities, not by my side. The truth will hurt you inside.

Befouled city.
Try to keep the faith.
Fly away.
Spread your wings and fly, into the night.

Walk in a flyblown world.

Danger is all around.
Safe places are nowhere to be found.

Close your eyes and you will see a universe in ecstasy.
Show me the way, donât disobey. This world will give you hell to pay.

Befouled city.
Try to keep the faith.
Fly away.
Spread your wings and fly, into the night.

Befouled city.
Try to keep the faith.
Fly away.
Spread your wings and fly, into the night.

Walk in a flyblown world.
