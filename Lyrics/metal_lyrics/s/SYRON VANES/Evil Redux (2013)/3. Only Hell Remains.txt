Awake with thousand dreams of pain.
Walking in a state of trance, ready to break the chain.
Remake tear down those walls of stone.
Call for the new king, creator must be dethroned.

Watch the angels falling from the  skies.
Crash in the dust of the brave.
Walk the land of endless cries.
Following the laws of destruction, after reduction.

Only hell remains.

Array the soldiers of revolution.
Hear voices screaming loud, calling for retribution.
Repay faces with all the tears.
Hear thunder roar echoes never disappear.

Watch the angels falling from the  skies.
Crash in the dust of the brave.
Walk the land of endless cries.
Following the laws of destruction, after reduction.

Hear him call your name, in an evil way.
Youâre the one to be sacrificed.
The whispering voice, obey to pray.
Before getting burned by eternal flame.

Escape the force of the devilâs cloud.
Lightning strikes among the crowd.
The wings of vengeance blows across.
The road of fire to the last cross.

Watch the angels falling from the  skies.
Crash in the dust of the brave.
Walk the land of endless cries.
Following the laws of destruction, after reduction.
Only hell remains.
