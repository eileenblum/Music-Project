In the night out of sight, Iâm moving around spellbound
I am a hooligan get me if you can
Iâm a nightmare beware, Iâm dynamite love to fight
Iâm cold as ice a rolling dice stop me no one can

Iâm a human gun
I hunt for fun
If you see me run
When itâs getting dark
âcos I love the dark

Run away if you can
Run away if you can
Run away if you can
Run away if you can

Iâm on the road power load, Iâm a racing car and a star
Iâm on fire in the sky I will never die
I got the force break all laws, Iâm a hurricane and a crazy train
I got no fear but I donât care stop me no one can

Iâm a human gun
I hunt for fun
If you see me run
When itâs getting dark
âcos I love the dark

Run away if you can
Run away if you can
Run away if you can
Run away if you can

In the night out of sight, Iâm moving around spellbound
I am a hooligan get me if you can
Iâm a nightmare beware, Iâm dynamite love to fight
Iâm cold as ice a rolling dice stop me no one can

Run away if you can
