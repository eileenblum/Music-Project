I have lived a life full of emptiness and pain
But Iâve searched for a little happiness
Iâve traveled on the seven seas to find the secret key
Which can open up the gates in my mind

When I see my life in the mirror on the wall
When I see my life in the mirror on the wall

Even if she love me I ainât ready for her yet
Her love came so quick that I got scared
Iâve tried to find the answers to the questions in my mind
But I canât well maybe I am blind

When I see my life in the mirror on the wall
When I see my life in the mirror on the wall I realize

Iâm so young Iâm running wild
Iâm so young Iâm running wild
Iâm so young Iâm running wild. Running wild

But when my youth is over and gone with the wind
Iâll be standing in a desert deep and wide
Iâve traveled on the seven seas to find the secret key
Which could have opened up the gates in my mind

When I see my life in the mirror on the wall
When I see my life in the mirror on the wall

Iâm so young Iâm running wild
Iâm so young Iâm running wild
Iâm so young Iâm running wild. Running wild
