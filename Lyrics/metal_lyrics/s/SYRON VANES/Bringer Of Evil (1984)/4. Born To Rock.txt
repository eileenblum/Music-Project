She moves real fast sheâs on the run
She takes every chance âcos she wanna dance
Here she comes open your gates 
She wants power every hour

If she says turn it up
You must turn it up
âtil her brain explodes sheâs

Born to rock night and day
Born to rock her life away
Born to rock night and day
Born to rock

Sheâs always out on the hunt
Sheâll never find enough for her mind

If she says turn it up
You must turn it up
âtil her brain explodes sheâs

Born to rock night and day
Born to rock her life away
Born to rock night and day
Born to rock

Sheâll never stop to love rock`nÂ´roll
She canât live without it

If she says turn it up
You must turn it up
âtil her brain explodes sheâs

Born to rock night and day
Born to rock her life away
Born to rock night and day
Born to rock
Born to rock
Born to rock
Born to rock
Born to rock
