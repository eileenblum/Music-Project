A princess is crying out in the night
Sheâs a winner alone in the dark
Yes locked in by her father the lord of the night
Sheâs never seen the sun with her eyes

Help, help her out,help her out

I wish that someone can help her escape
But itâs hard yes I know âcos Iâve tried
The only way there is to help her escape
Is to call upon the wizard in the forest

Help, help her out

Sheâs been crying for ages
Sheâs been crying for far to long
Sheâs been crying for ages
Sheâs been crying for far to long

This wizard knows the story and the secret of this child
Who was born at the castle twenty years ago
In the cellar at the mighty castle on the hill
Lives a girl alone in the dark
Her only crime is that sheâs the daughter of the lord
Who loves the dark more than this child

Help, help her out

Sheâs been crying for ages
Sheâs been crying for far to long
Sheâs been crying for ages
Sheâs been crying for far to long
