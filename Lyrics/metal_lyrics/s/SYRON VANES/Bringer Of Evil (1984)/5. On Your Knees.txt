Donât you try to fool me itâs impossible you see
Even if I act so nice I am cold as ice
If I get you by my side you can never hide
Donât you try to be brave You gonna be my slave, be my slave

My will will be your command do you understand
When you hear me call on the floor youâll fall
Do as I say, do as I say get down

Get down on your knees  on your knees
Get down on your knees  on your knees
Get down on your knees  on your knees
Get down on your knees  on your knees

Everything to me youâll give and I let you live
Open up your eyes try to realize
If I get you by my side you can never hide
Donât you try to be brave you gonna be my slave

Do as I say, do as I say get down
Donât you try to fool me itâs impossible you see
Even if I act so nice I am cold as ice
If I get you by my side you can never hide
Donât you try to be brave You gonna be my slave
Do as I say, do as I say get down

Get down on your knees  on your knees
Get down on your knees  on your knees
Get down on your knees  on your knees
Get down on your knees  on your knees
