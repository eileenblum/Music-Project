I donât know where to go lost in the middle of nowhere
I donât wanna get back to the land of hate
I saw the dark and felt the heat I nearly lost my soul down there
I wonât go back I donât belong there
Take me to a place where I am safe from hell
Where I can live a life of love
Down there is a fire and itâll keep on burning
As long as mankind believe on

Killing ripping with the edge of a knife
And kill his brother in a war

I donât believe the voice of evil I donât listen to it
I donât believe the voice of evil I donât listen to 

A bringer of evil

I pray for love and life I hate the other side
Iâll never sell my soul to the evil man
Down there is a fire and itâll keep on burning
As long as mankind believe on

Killing ripping with the edge of a knife
And kill his brother in a rotten war

I donât believe
A bringer of evil
