Loud and clear screaming guitars an audience thatâs wild
It isnât easy to be there if youâre old or hate the sound
But it must go on all through the night âtil your ears starts to bleed
We show no mercy just play on so come on shout it out

Canât resist the sound of metal
Canât resist it at all
Canât resist the sound of metal
Canât resist it at all

The flashlights on the stage is lightning up the hall 
But donât close your eyes youâll miss the point where the fireworks go of
On your feet bang your head this music makes you high
All together here it comes come on shout it out

Canât resist the sound of metal
Canât resist it at all
Canât resist the sound of metal
Canât resist it at all
Canât resist the sound of metal
Canât resist it at all
Canât resist the sound of metal
Canât resist it at all

Loud and clear screaming guitars an audience thatâs wild
It isnât easy to be there if youâre old or hate the sound
But it must go on all through the night âtil your ears starts to bleed
We show no mercy just play on so come on shout it out
Canât resist it at all
