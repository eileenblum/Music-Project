I always thought that you cared for me.
And I allways thought you were my lover and allied.

So in our darkest nights, somehow Iâve seen a light.
And in our hardest fights, somehow I seen a light.
Shining bright and it makes me wonder why.

Love and hate, come together
Love and hate, tear us apart
Love and hate, come together
Love and hate

Even if we often argue and scream.
There is always something there that keeps us very close.

So in our darkest nights, somehow Iâve seen a light.
And in our hardest fights, somehow I seen a light.
Shining bright and it makes me wonder why.

Love and hate, come together
Love and hate, tear us apart
Love and hate, come together
Love and hate

Tell me why must love and hate almost tear us apart, tell me why.

I always thought that you cared for me.
And I always thought you were my lover and allied.

Tell me why must love and hate almost tear us apart, tell me why

Love and hate, come together
Love and hate, tear us apart
Love and hate, come together
Love and hate
Love and hate, come together
Love and hate, tear us apart
Love and hate, come together
Love and hate
