I have been looking for you, where have you been for the last three days.
Well, maybe you thought that I would forget everything that you said.

Iâm ready anytime, yeah I am ready anytime

So you better open your gates and let me in, I want you tonight
Cos you know what I like and only you can make me burn

Come on

Give me all your love donât say no, give me everything
Yeah, give me all your love donât say no, give me everything

Cause Iâm

Back for more, back for more, give me everything, back for more

I canât get enough of you, I loose control, you drive me wild.
I donât care if you tell me that I am too much for you anyway.

Come on, give me all your love donât say no, give me everything
Yeah, give me all your love donât say no, give me everything

Cause Iâm

Back for more, back for more, give me everything, back for more

[Solo]

Cause Iâm ready anytime

I have been looking for you, where have you been for the last three days.
Well, maybe you thought that I, would forget everything that you said

But I am

Back for more, back for more, give me everything, back for more
Back for more, back for more, give me everything, back for more
Back for more
