You had a dream of glory, a dream of victory.
But you never got that far, never became a star.

Get up I canât stand see you lying there, knocked out by the way things are.
You got to stand up, cos thereâs no time to loose you must carry on.
Try again why give up that easy, one day things will go your way.
Thatâs right tomorrow thereâs another day so keep on anyway.

But not a word of what I said, made its way into your head.
No the glory in your eyes, made you blind for my advice.

You had a dream of glory, a dream of victory.
But you never got that far, never became a star.

I know that you are afraid of reality, you think that lifeâs a dance on roses.
Wake up try to see thereâs another life. Thatâs your only hope.

But not a word of what I said, made its way into your head.
No the glory in your eyes, made you blind for my advice.

You had a dream of glory, a dream of victory.
But you never got that far, never became a star.

Found a letter in your bed, but when I found it you were already dead.
It tried to explain the way youâve acted, but it made no sense to me.

You had a dream of glory, a dream of victory.
But you never got that far, never became a star.

Get up I canât stand see you lying there, knocked out by the way things are.
You got to stand up, cos thereâs no time to loose you must carry on.

You had a dream of glory, a dream of victory
But you never got that far, never became a star
You had a dream of glory, a dream of victory
But you never got that far, never became a star
