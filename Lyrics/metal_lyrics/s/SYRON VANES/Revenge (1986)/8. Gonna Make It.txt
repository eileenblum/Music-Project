Look into my eyes and tell me what youâll see,
I know that youâll see me standing on a stage and scream.
Yeah I always had this dream, Iâm reaching for the top, 
Iâm not gonna stop, cos Iâve promised to my self.

That Iâll fight every night just to make it right.
That Iâll fight every night just to make it right.
Iâll sin, just to win, Iâll take and Iâll break. 

Iâm gonna make it make it to the top, gonna make it
Iâm gonna make it make it to the top, gonna make it
Iâm gonna make it make it to the top, gonna make it
Iâm gonna make it make it to the top, gonna make it

I know it could be hard, but Iâve made up my mind.
You may call me blind, but I am sure that I survive.
I know Iâll take great chance and maybe I fail.
End up in jail and disappear in trance.

But Iâll fight every night just to make it right.
Yeah Iâll fight every night just to make it right.
Iâll sin, just to win, Iâll take and Iâll break.

So you better watch out. Donât stand in my way.
