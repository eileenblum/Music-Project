Here we come step aside, thereâs nowhere to hide. 
We are the crew whoâll deliver all to you. 
Weâll turn it up till it roars, make you pray for more,.
But youâll get enough cos we love it loud and play it rough.

When danger fills the air, stranger just beware.
When danger fills the air, stranger we are here so you better beware

Revenge, now we are back watch out for our attack
Revenge, now we are back rocking with the pack

When playing live in your town, donât you turn us down.
When we do our show we would like you all to go 
crazy in the night.hear you screaming, allright, 
and then like a rocket in the sky weâre gonna blast and make you high.

When danger fills the air, stranger just beware.
When danger fills the air, stranger we are here so you better beware

Revenge, now we are back watch out for our attack
Revenge, now we are back rocking with the pack
Now we are back, rocking with the pack.

Here we come step aside, thereâs nowhere to hide. 
We are the crew whoâll deliver all to you. 
Weâll turn it up till it roars, make you pray for more, 
but youâll get enough cos we love it loud and play it rough.

When danger fills the air, stranger just beware.
When danger fills the air, stranger we are here so you better beware

Revenge, now we are back watch out for our attack
Revenge, now we are back rocking with the pack
Revenge, now we are back watch out for our attack
