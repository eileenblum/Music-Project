When youâre out to have a ball, rocknâroll can give you all.
If youâre feeling down and out, just do as I do stand up scream and shout.
You know, living should be just for fun, make a change and get out on the run.
Out on the run.

Here we come, move your ass, get ready for the metal mass. 
On your feet, feel the heat.
Canât you see we are hotâ¦ yeah fire we got.

People say that Iâm a fool, but I donât care I think Iâm cool.
And they say that I am bad, but Iâll keep on to make them mad.
They say that Iâll end in hell, but I think theyâll do just as well, just as well.

Here we come move your ass, get ready for the mass.
On your feet feel the heat the rhythm and the heat.
Open youâre eyes, realize our music ainât like ice, 
no its not it is hot it is everything we got.

When youâre out to have a ball rocknâroll can give you all,
If youâre feeling down and out, just do as I do stand up scream and shout.
You know, living should be just for fun, so make change, 
and get out on the run, out on the run.

Here we come, move your ass, get ready for the metal mass 
on your feet, feel the heat
Canât you see we are hotâ¦ yeah fire we got.
