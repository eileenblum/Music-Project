Let me tell you a tale of conspiracy
The frightening intrigues and ways born of an ancient rift
A golden pact, a sustained wrath, an oath
"Worship our Gods forever"
Pharaoh and priests are talking greed
But who's gonna pay for this?
I curse you now with a thousand griefs

Corruption Within... And fate has it all
... The strings have stopped to play the chords
... Harmony is a force of the past
... Corruption within me

The death of our society
has come from the whispers and waves of a crack of the whip
A sudden drought of existence ground, a failure

"Live our life forever"
Unchained and free... or so you think
Look at the price of this
You're paying back with a thousand griefs

Corruption Within... And fate has it all
... The strings have stopped to play the chords
... Harmony is a force of the past
... Corruption within me

... I curse you now with a thousand griefs

Corruption Within... And fate has it all
... The strings have stopped to play the chords
... Harmony is a force of the past
... Corruption within me (Corruption)
