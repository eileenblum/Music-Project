Off the shores of another land
Looming dark against the sky
Stands a tower of blackest stone
That outlasts time itself
Eyes behold this evil and malevolent monument
For it has claimed so many tortured souls
Wiped out in vain
The will of fate fulfilled its rage
Ends a decade, a forgotten page

-Dark Tower-
Your kingdom come - An heir is born
We will follow and your force will grow

Fear the eye of the hurricane
Latent power still unseen
Emerging from the sacred throne
That the child king sits upon
That leader rules over this malevolent monument
For his reign has taken a mighty dreadful toll
Forging your chains

The ruins we've made in enemies' land
Women we've raped, tortured, enslaved

-Dark Tower-
Your kingdom come - A crown of thorns
We will follow, destruction will flow

Decayed remains of heroes' grave
Martyrs insane, courageous, brave

-Dark Tower-
Your kingdom come - Your blazon is worn
We will follow the flag of sorrow
(Your kingdom come)
