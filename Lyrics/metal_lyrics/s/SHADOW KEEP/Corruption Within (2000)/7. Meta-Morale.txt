Welcome to the pride of our super-bio-crystal
Please just take a seat, you'll need one...
You have been chosen to host our new agent
And hold the flame of the principle
That will guide humanity from now on
You ask me to smile and find a reason to accept your grime
Become a guinea pig and be part of the crime...

Enter your new master (the Meta-Morale)
A reality you can't escape
Conflicts * Seizure * Meta-Morale
Enter your new master (the Meta-Morale)
There's no way around, no way out of the pressure
Conflicts * Seizure * Meta-Morale

These walls define the sides of a physical realm of treachery
I'm locked inside a cage made of strifes
I can't remember the smells and the textures
Or even the name I'm known by
Their damn cure has left little alive

But I'll keep hoping for me that the poison inside
Succeed to destroy me, releasing my mind...

Enter your new master (the Meta-Morale)
A reality you can't escape
Conflicts * Seizure * Meta-Morale
Enter your new master (the Meta-Morale)
There's no way around, no way out of the pressure
Conflicts * Seizure * Meta-Morale

"Just a little sacrifice"
These words are worth a thousand lies

Enter your new master (the Meta-Morale)
A reality you can't escape
Conflicts * Seizure * Meta-Morale
Enter your new master (the Meta-Morale)
There's no way around, no way out of the pressure
Conflicts * Seizure * Meta-Morale
