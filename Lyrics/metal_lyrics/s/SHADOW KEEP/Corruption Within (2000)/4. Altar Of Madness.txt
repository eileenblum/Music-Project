Do you realise you've come to me
To ask a favour... a favour
I need your raison-d'Ãºtre
To create the vision... arrest my decision
A life for a life
Flesh for blood - Flesh for blood
I feel the shame spreading in your veins
All is so confused, you thought you were immune

Come closer to the altar I promise
It won't endeavour to devour you
Don't turn away, don't hold your breath
Your mission... repel the repulsion
A life for a lie
Slay the goat - Slay the goat

As you watch blood stains stretching along the drain
The Being seems amused of your misfortune

The altar of madness has become a part of you
A pit of darkness for all humanity in you
The elder of madness wants you to share his views
A world of sadness... His world of sadness

As you watch blood stains running along the drain
The Being seems amused of your misfortune

The altar of madness has become a part of you
A pit of darkness for all humanity in you
The elder of madness wants you to share his views
A world of sadness obscure the sky above you
