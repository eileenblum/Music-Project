In a time, in a place long abandonned by the Masters
You've done it and sinned against me
You've done it and sinned against me again
Pretending you're not bound by the rule of the Illusion
You came and stole my life
You'll bear the mark of the Usurper - Until you die
You came and stole my life
You bear the mark of the Usurper
And now you run from it - You try to run from it

That's your decision, that's your mistake
And when the time comes for redemption
Expect to see Him coming
Expect to see Him coming for you
Claiming your life, avenging the lost one

You came and stole my life
You'll bear the mark of the Usurper - Until you die
You came and stole my life
You bear the mark of the Usurper
You cannot run from it!

Down by the river stealthy movements
Seem to gracefully induce a dance and harvest an even ground
Slowly revealing the reason why you must be punished
And taken away from all existence

"Why" is the word painted on your lips
Innocence faked is a form of art
You've crossed the divine line
And vanity is your crime

You came and stole my life
You'll bear the mark of the Usurper - Until you die
You came and stole my life
You bear the mark of the Usurper
And now you run from Him! (and now you run)
