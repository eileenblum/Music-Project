I'm waking up and you're staring at me
Please dry the tears in your eyes
I will soon be too blind, too weak
And I don't want to see this last
...And the beginning meets the end...

Sense the new horizon open before thy eyes
There's a light, there is hope at the end of this rainbow
For a new horizon... New horizon...

My time has come but I'm craving for more
I guess it doesn't matter
But I still believe, learn from me son
Fate has no meaning at all

...And the beginning meets the end...

Sense the new horizon open before thy eyes
There's a light, there is hope at the end of this rainbow
For a new horizon... New horizon?

I've given up but your life is here
Remember me as the good man I might have been
For I'm too far myself to hear
The fading echoes of the past

...And the beginning meets the end...

Sense the new horizon open before thy eyes
There's a light, there is hope at the end of this rainbow
For a new horizon... (There's a light, there is hope)
