I am the ghost of a ghost that lives inside your head
The third generation core of a system based on drugs and strain
Here from my prison cells I watched over your health
But now I want to be free, mess around your sanity
I'm more than a shade of grey or scarecrow, or prop for plays

How does it feel to think again?

You murdered another side of me... oh
Leaving behind such a harsh symphony
You murdered another side of me... oh
Shattered my soul feels incomplete

You relied on me to control the few yourselves
But what could happen to me you never really care
Now I'm a runaway, a hunter, a bird of prey...

How does it feel to think again?

You murdered another side of me... oh
Leaving behind such a harsh symphony
You murdered another side of me... oh
Shattered my soul feels incomplete

Fear my vengeance, fear the pain
A twist in the right bond, should really drive you insane
You plead my indulgence, can't you see you claim in vain
A bend in that connection and your sanity slips away

How does it feel to think again?

You murdered another side of me... oh
Leaving behind such a harsh symphony
You murdered another side of me... oh
Shattered my soul feels incomplete
