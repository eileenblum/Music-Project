I thought you were the king of the burned plains
The craftsman of torture and pain
But without reason the will to hurt has gone
And your lust for torment in the sea of time has drowned
You're standing there, facing me
Braving your peers gathered here

As the sun goes down on me
You're cast out, I set you free
As the sun goes down on me
You're cast out, It sets us free

I'm taking back the crown that I've once supplied
To a rebel angel that had made his time
But as the wind blows the leaves of the Eden tree
We'll fix our machine then carry on our deeds

They're everywhere, begging me
They've got nowhere but here

As the sun goes down on me
You're cast out, I set you free
As the sun goes down on me
You're cast out, It sets us free

The situation could not be solved
By any other means you had to leave

Your reef, this place and your memories
For you've been unworthy
To carry on the divine tragedy

As the sun goes down on me
You're cast out, I set you free
As the sun goes down on me
You're cast out, It sets you free!
