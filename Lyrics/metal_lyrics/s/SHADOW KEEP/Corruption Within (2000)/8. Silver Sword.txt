I faked so many times
For the sake of peace in our life
When you prayed at night, so did I
I was so blind, no more am I
Remember the fights you had
With everyone, about everything
I didn't know what side to be on
No, I didn't betray you
I just didn't follow you
On the path along whose way
You have shaped your truth...

The Silver Sword

Once again you are the white knight
And I am the black sheep
A mind you can't understand
But forests need different trees

Tolerance is a word you don't know
And when you look into my eyes
You only see the perfect me
The one you want me to be
The one who'd share your views
But here I stand and disagree
So your anger burst to defend your truth...

The Silver Sword

Once again you are the white knight
And I am the black sheep
A mind you can't understand
But forests need different trees
You'd swear you are the right one
'cause as the angel speaks to you
Your speech must be in some ways
The one and only truth...

Once again you are the white knight
And I am the black sheep
(But forests need different trees)
