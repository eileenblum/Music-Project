In the depth of your mind
The paradox of your loneliness awaits for a sign
And the shadows of pain in circle around you
The ritual has begun
They seem so far away but unconscious and willingness
Have merged and become one and left you in this state
It's rather late to wonder if it was what you want
The endless gate is open now... waiting for you

Inner Sanctum will be your new home
Relieved from the weight of the world
Inner Sanctum a peace of mind
Where you'll live free away from sorrow

Are you sure you're alive
In full control of your intentional psycho-suicide
Be a shadow of pain by you, because of you
For the matter's not theirs to decide

They seem so far away but unconscious and willingness
Have merged and become one and left you in this state
It's rather late to wonder if it was what you want
The endless gate is open now... waiting for you

Inner Sanctum will be your new home
Relieved from the weight of the world
Inner Sanctum a peace of mind
Where you'll live free away from sorrow

Who keep us away from the truth and in the darkness manipulate
The innocents that we are materialising their own game
The privilege, the wonder wrapping around the masquerade
Shatter the gate and what's behind... appears to you

Inner Sanctum will be your new home
Relieved from the weight of the world
Inner Sanctum a peace of mind
Where you'll live free away from sorrow
