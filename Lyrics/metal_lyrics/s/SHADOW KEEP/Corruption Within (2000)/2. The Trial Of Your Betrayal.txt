I remember the time long gone by
When we were sharing a misery
What devastated all the grounds
The sea of love had spared some time
Oh a lake of sadness is now filling the space
Oh the lake of sadness is now within the stare

With your eyes you forced you way in and invest me
Then followed the hollow of your sweet white lies
Until now you were the one I care about
But the trial of your betrayal has now come

The myth in every dream is always made of silence
And that's the part you couldn't stand
You spoiled the magic, scratched the paint
The masterpiece is full of stains

Oh can't you see you never needed me?
Oh and did you ever only respect me?

With your eyes you forced you way in and invest me
Then followed the hollow of your sweet white lies
Until now you were the one I care about
But the trial of your betrayal has now come
