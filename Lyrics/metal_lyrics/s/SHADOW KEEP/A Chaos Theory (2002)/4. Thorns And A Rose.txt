How was Christ, who is God, able to be born and to die
When he is for all eternity?" Jean-Claude Carriere

A God is no more than a man who grew older than old
His heart filled with sadness as the truth is unfold
If there can only be one, then this one must be me
I'm the new messiah so bow down to me

Good and Evil appeal to me, I'm both thorns and rose
Good and Evil rule inside me like a two-headed God
