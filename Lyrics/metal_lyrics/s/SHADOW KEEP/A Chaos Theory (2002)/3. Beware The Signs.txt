We may gain a great deal of understanding about the universe
If we can learn to see it more as a self-organized system
And less as a machine" Lee Smolin

Am I the reaper of the light or a phantom in your dream?
I plant the seeds into the ground but the harvest is your deed
Am I an angel of the night or the demon in your dream?
I bring you knowledge in true light, I am a part of the machine

Am I an angel of the night?
... am I an angel of the light?
