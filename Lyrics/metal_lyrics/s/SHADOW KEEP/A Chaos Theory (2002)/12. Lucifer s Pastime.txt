You must become an ignorant man again
And see the sun again with an ignorant eye
And see it clearly in the idea of it" Wallace Stevens

We feed our own sorrow at the fountain of time
We search our own tomorrow in the eyes of the sky
To decipher is Lucifer's Pastime - Temptation

Is this what life should be all about?
A trail of tears until it's over
The power goes where the power dies...
In the perfect silence of a Chaos Theory
