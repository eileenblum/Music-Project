Given for one instant an intelligence which could
Comprehend all the forces by which Nature is animated,
Nothing would be uncertain and the future, like the past,
Would be present to its eyes" Marquis de Laplace

Seasons cycle, in full circle
A subtle kiss of frost
Burns my lips, a numb of cold
Hibernation - maybe forever

Distress - We're doomed
No shelter No sanctuary
Our lifes depend on a Chaos Theory
Destress - Resume
To a normal day sequence
Your feeble life depends on a Chaos Theory
