There are no human struggle more noble than the one
Through which we set out to break the chains and go forward
In the vehicles of understanding" Giordano Bruno

The holy war has just begun
A holy war has just begun

An illusion so real
I had to dedicate my life
To make you see through, break the ice
You know - There are dangers for you and me
We're making waves, they don't like it

The holy war has just begun
And they are fighting for their principles
