People who appeal to fixed conceptions of necessity,
Contingency, and possibility are simply confused"
Roberto M. Unger

I swear I never meant to hurt
I respect innocence
Virgin minds call for freedom
I merely opened the door

I failed my life and I failed others
If only they'd washed away my words...
