When we reject the siren song of false sources,
We become free to seek solutions to questions of
Morals and meanings in the proper place -
Within ourselves" Stephen Jay Gould

The clock is ticking backwards for me now
Evolution has no meaning when the change inside
Is a metamorphosis so deep your world falls apart
Do I belong, do I belong here? It's obsessing me

No love - No life - No understanding
I'm lost - I die - Will I rise from the ashes?
