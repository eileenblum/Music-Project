Men cannot conceive that things occur by chance...
... they have a holy terror of chance" Umberto Eco

We have enough of your madman's intuitions
That hide the truth behind the curtains
We can believe in what we see and Gods we grew up with
But your black hole paradise leads us to a dead end road

Fear and loathing: the result of a chain
Reaction - the lightning strikes again
Fear and loathing: the reward for the change
You brought - the lightning strikes again
