The main problem philosophy faces at the present time
Is how to have knowledge without faith" Paola Brancaleoni

It's hard to follow someone with a vision so extreme
The words come out of my mouth but the meaning is beyond me
The sinner will throw the first stone, with force until you bleed

I trust no one so why believe in you
I trust no one to show me the way
I trust no one but I'll believe in you
I trust no one - I trust no one... but you!
