Because of the infinite multitude of simple substances,
There are, as it were, just as many different universes,
Which are, nevertheless, only perspectives on a single one"
G.W. Leibniz

There are 2 worlds and 2 worlds only
But the plane between them counts as 1
From the sides, dim and twice as many...
Mark my words 8 and 8 and 1 will be
The magic number, 17

Whatever these words may mean, the omen is upon us
The gypsy read our blood red dusk
