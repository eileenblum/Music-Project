I saw you stumble out from the social slaughter house, oppression's progeny, you lift your head and plead for mercy. Rocks began as building blocks until they turned to throwing stones; a monolith of dominance we set atop your plinth of bones.[1]

Place your hands to the pulse of this city, keep your ear to the ground, hear him gasp, "I can't breathe, I can't breathe."[12]
