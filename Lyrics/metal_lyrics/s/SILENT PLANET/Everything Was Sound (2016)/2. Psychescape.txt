I sank down the plane of delusion
It's vast expanses mocked my advances, and bid me,
âOh fragile mind, you will learn how to fracture.â
Scrawled across the walls the suffering saint cries out,
âIs it madness to retreat from the myopic gaze[1] that holds us captive?â[2]

Follow me, I'll take you to the edge of reason
Fall with me[3], we'll make a home in our delusion
I split my mind[4] ten thousand times, but in every world there's no exit
No exit.[5]

No madness in a dream[6] - no walls surround me to keep me safe
The straight line you draw for me:
So perfect, so pure.
Untie me from reality
When every word is falling from your mouth, don't let it become your escape.

Make an escape from the monolith[7]; scale the lies of material despondency
I waited on the tracks of reason, but my train of thought it never came, it never came.[8]

The straight line you draw for me:
So perfect, so pure; so perfect, so pure.

I'd change the world but I can't change myself.
I saw you shout at the shadows.[9]
I'd change the world but I'm chained to myself.
Define paranoia[10]

Follow me, I'll take you to the edge of reason
Fall with meâ¦ but could the lips of God grace a withered fruit?[11][12]
