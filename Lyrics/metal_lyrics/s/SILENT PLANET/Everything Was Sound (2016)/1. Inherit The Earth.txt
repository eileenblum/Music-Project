After the fire, after the rain [1]
After the sacred kissed the profane -
When you came and left again
Such a captivating pain
After that night I left my comfort
To find where your body lies
I'd wander upon this grave then fall...
I'd fall inside

I searched the clearing for that spark
Hands sifted through the ash -
Knowing what we felt was real
But some delusions never pass. [2]
So I took shelter in the woods
With the naked shaking trees:
Deciduous, fraternal twins
We're both wilted, stem and leaf
Then the mist turned sleet into snow;
My senses shook numb, I've nothing to show
But a rain â stained book that once contained
My literary charades:
New blots of ink, archetypal shapes and shades
Bleed through each and every page. [3]
And I ask myself:
What's the weight of my life on the scales of eternity?

We inherit the earth, [4] we inherit the war
I inhabit the wound, I dwell in the harm
Oh how far we fall: [5] We're casualties of time
Oh how far we fall: Begin to forgive existence

Retreat back from reaching trees
When a frigid shadow climbs inside of me [6] -
That specter of recompense -
It's a sound I've heard ever since

Amidst the endless mortal strife
And the constantly dying light [7]
The truth we felt from the start:
"How can I hold myself together when everything falls apart?"

We inherit the earth, we inherit the war
I inhabit the wound, I dwell in the harm
Oh how far we fall: We're casualties of time
Oh how far we fall: Forgive existence

I wandered upon the alter of human intervention [8]
An exhibition of erudition
Find me here, Son of Man. [9]
How far we fall...
