Respective perspectives worshiping directives - blindly killing for our dogma,[1] until our sons meet in the garden.[2] Torches scald the night sky; the youth rise up and set their elders to the gallows.[3] Fire in the lighthouse: All our advances, a spark away from
conflagration.

In the night I saw you fall, oh wicked star,[4] illuminate our hate, show us who we really are.

Books were burned away - only swords remained.[5] The prophets died for peace, stabbed by preying priests. As the wise man said I'll keep my heart and lose my head.[6] Without a neck how can I sink with a millstone to the bottom of the sea?[7] The bottom of the sea - and
Iâm finding the violence - it looks like me.

Singing songs of life when all we know is death.[8] A world of orphans[9] left empty-handed. If loveâs a sin Iâll become a heretic.

Recurring intervention:[10] Framing the narrative to cleanse our tainted conscience.[11]
Harvesting destruction: Reaping the sow from weapons planted in the soil.[12]

Terrified little son, encumbered by your sword, you can hide your fear but wonât shed the sheer weight of your own humanity - humanity. You can face me towards the mountains[13] where I meet our Motherâs gaze.[14] Too blinded by this hatred to recognize your brotherâs
face.[15]

Singing songs of life when all we know is death. A world of orphans left empty-handed.

Iâll collapse - head parting from my weary shoulders - seeds of life spilling from my palms.[16] Subverting love[17] will take hold in this hateful soil; my blood is the water. Inshallah, Shalom. Love will take hold.
