"I am autonomous," You told Father
First immortal, but now fleeting
All creation reveals me about this said time, called death, cursed the reverse
All we bought was brokenness -
That shelter of illusion

You see me see You splitting myself even
There is me, forgiving nothing, manic then depressive - hopelessly sinking
Sister Moon, Brother Sun eclipsed one another, forgiving one another

Tides receding

Death ran away then life flooded in world
This I am: Imbalanced, beautifully so
Hands connected, perhaps...
Then dead reflections saw You
I did, didn't I?

I didn't, did I?
You saw reflections dead then
Perhaps, connected hands...
So beautifully Imbalanced: Am I this world?
In flooded life then away ran Death

Receding tides

Another one forgiving, another one eclipsed, Sun Brother, Moon Sister
Sinking helplessly - depressive then manic, nothing forgiving me is there even myself, splitting? You see me see You

Illusion of shelter: That brokenness was bought, "we all reverse the cursed death called time," said this about me
Reveals creation, all - fleeting, now, but immortal. First
Father told you, "Autonomous am I."
