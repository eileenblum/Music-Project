All the world was a dream I couldn't shake - in a midnight reverie of which I'll never wakeÂ¹ - that started mundane enough with an incessant tapping on the windowpane separating me from the storm.

Where inside I sat, me the loathsome fool,Â² with my head cocked sideways in confusion as my looking glassÂ³ became a two-way mirror and you can watch me hide from everything on this living sphere. But don't you dare darken my doorstep,â´ stranger - never a step
more. No, no, Nevermore!âµ You see, I have this reoccurring dream where we snuck past scores of slumbering guards and fixed that rustic iron key to that lock to set you free. "I would bring you liberty!" Where in reality I'm a coward. I'm collateral matter swayed by
banalities of time and space. I'm a name without a face.â¶

My trepidation reached threshold and my terror turned to madness - when I awoke I was swinging at shrouded silhouettes and stumbled out the door where my anger was extinguished by this downpour. Compelled, void of volition, my steps propelled through this chronic storm,
where there in the clearing - throughout the gaps in the trees - dark smoke flickered from fire illuminating my unease. Like clockwork, seven sistersâ· turned together in a circle, autonomy abandoned, they moved singular and perpetual around a dark blue flame where I
heard you call my name: "I am the fire that is never quenched, and I am the river that will not run dry."

When I slept in that garden,â¸ Lord did you see me as I was dreaming?

This is the end of everything. We'll lose our divisions and forget our names:[ix] the precipice of eternity. I caught fire, I caught fire, I caught fire and you'll watch me burn.
