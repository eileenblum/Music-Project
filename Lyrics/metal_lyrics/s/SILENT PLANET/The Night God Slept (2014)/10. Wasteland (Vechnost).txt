[feat. Nathan Mead]We "won the War" Â¹; we made a temple to thieves enshrining the great criminal who promised heaven without God Â².
If we had sight to seem, to see the seven seas could cease to be or freeze in me. We'd shake this sudden sundering and subsequently cross the strait Â³ and traverse the wastes â´. We'll beat your rifles to shovels âµ and dig a proper grave for our sons who saw the
end of God â¶: Wasteland. the flag will fall with the wall we built â·: Wasteland.
Apostate to the State, Witness to the Dead â¸: For you know only a heap of broken Image â¹ and when you rid this earth of God we shall shelter Him underground Â¹â°.
Fall into the coldest wastes of wastes of humanity - darkening circles fed by deepening graves. "Death solves all problems Â¹Â¹," your heart is a statistic Â¹Â². No mother, no resistance... but still she precludes the grave.
They saw the end of God: Wasteland. The flag will fall with the walls we built: Wasteland.

Â² Joseph Stalin defied the spirit of Marxism-Leninism by taking on a persona of god-like qualities -- promising prosperity to his followers while exiling, executing, and starving large portions of his country.
