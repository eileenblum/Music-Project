[feat. Sean McCulloch]Creation creates a void. My hand held to the glare of this burnt impasse; Â¹ yours, necessarily on the other side of some sickly metaxis. Â² You're caught in stasis, matched with mine. Quantify time with meter and rhyme to calculate a way to prove that you are alive.
Isolated, trapped between, a picture of you now stained on the street. Oh mother, teach me how to die.
In your shadow I saw to a distant future; your life was only a nominal fee. Signing the sound of silence, signaling the end. They took your life, mother, as a pretense to pretend. The hand that feeds us sat you down.
Covered my eyes, thrusted the styli, retraced the timeline to call it suicide. Â³ Will you wait for me? Death was the chorus - our lives frames in refrain. Softly we sing notes better sung by our dead. I'd rather sleep and see you soon than die alone in the wake of
this nuclear catastrophe. We were made to create, â´ you spoke us out of nothing. âµ Out of the chaos we caused, naked we came, shadows we leave.
Salt of the Earth: â¶ Preserve their songs, Light of World: â· Burn out the shadows. Infinite echoes of stifled screams - the abyss you created will ever stare back into me. â¸
Will you wait for me?

[Â¹ Our young protagonist finds her mother's shadow burned onto the ground by the intense heat emitted upon detonation.

Â³ Historians in favor of the American nuclear action feel that the bombing was justified in light of atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese armies. Also, many theorize that less human lives were lost by taking nuclear action instead of a full-scale invasion of
Tokyo.
