The barren wastes, bearing down on me.Â¹ Cracks in the clouds leave me wondering: Did the oceans dry out and return to the sky, for a privileged perspective of our final goodbye?

Pretend it's a house of peace while she's buried underneath. You built your Father's house over my mother's grave.Â²

Bodies - a mass grave collapse the concave floor. These sanctimonious steeples will meet us in the dirt. Because the earth is trembling,Â³ if only we had eyes to see it shake. Ignorant until we expire.

When the ocean fills our veins and the soil becomes my bones:â´ Maybe we'll fall asleep tonight to the madness in the melody poured out for slaves.

We were dressed in potential now we're draped in sorrow.
Our race is a bloodstain spattered on a profane political campaign - manifest your destiny. Stripes and stars comprise my prison bars - the cost of liberty.âµ

Maybe we'll fall asleep tonight to the madness in the melody poured out for slaves. Maybe this storm is a perfect score for wretched bodies washed ashore, poured out for me.â¶

The life I loved looking up at me: saplings struck like daggers hemorrhaging streams as the breath of my people return to the groundâ· so forests can once more abound.

The suffering cross that overcame,â¸ the name of Love made concurrent with shame.

This melody - I thought it familiar it sounds like your heartbeat keeping time,â¹ then you turn and remind me that this pain has a purpose. And maybe we'll fall asleep tonight.
