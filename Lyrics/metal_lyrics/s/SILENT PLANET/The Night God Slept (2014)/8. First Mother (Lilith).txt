[feat. Rory Rodriguez]Awake, awake your eyes - or forever fallen. Â¹ Sister, can you see me through the boundaries of this garden? Â² When every man will take your voice, every God will fate your end. Â³ You planted paradox in the center of our humanity; my ambivalent proclivity for
insufficiency.
Should I sleep or should I die alone? Life to death or flesh to decompose. You captured me.
I'm awakened by a fate that screams: "You will bear the weight to give this world a beating heart that never ends."
Now bring me a love that will live and die by my every word I speak. Won't you lie in this bed that we have made? â´
I must become something more than this.
Should I sleep or should I die alone? Life to death or flesh to decompose. You've captured me.
Should I sleep or should I die alone? Life to death or flesh to decompose.
You've captured me.
