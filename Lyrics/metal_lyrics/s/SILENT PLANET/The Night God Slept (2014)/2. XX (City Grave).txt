This injustice renders my thoughts ineffectual. Forgive me, Lover, and forget my sullen face. Privilege brings us to this place of human currencies. (We) buried our sisters in a glass display, only to evaporate to a toxic skyline â underneath we sell off the bodies.

My body became a graveyard where they buried thirsty souls. Show me your righteous leader; Iâll show you the bullet holes. The preacher Â¹ with the parched tongue and the âGodâ that he controls: âShake off the sin! Shake off the sin!â And spit out your cacophony of lies.

Iâll climb through your screen and bleed out the image you left in me. Â²

But God, are you man? Then how do you see me? From where you sit up in heaven Â³, looking down on my hell. My body chokes back.
âI have nothing to draw with and the well is deep â where can I get living water?â â´

Enslaved in the âLand of the Freeâ âµ â my prison is our wedding bed where you left me for dead. Youâll leave us for dead. Apathy was our anchor to a digital sea â¶ where you drown in the comfort of our complicity.

Can Love save me? Will Your wrath avenge us? â·
