Faceless bodies, abstracted and dissected
Torrid tongues tasting blood to cure their curse
Opression is their language

Shifting shades, illusions in the desert
The Twilight of the Idols is at hand

In the quiet, youâll hear us cry out
To the stars I plead my case
Yet the heavens seem quiescent
Entropy: perforate my senses
Devolving from dust into dust

But you wonât relent until our every desert is filled with water

And His love came down!
O Cristo Domine Jesu
And His love came down!
O Cristo Domine Jesu
And it rescued me!
O Cristo Domine Jesu
And I believe
I believe
