The Sound and the Fury, the spaces between
All our distinctions you cast to the sea
Lord, how can this be?
How can this be?

Iâve been waiting on inspiration
He must be gasping in his dreams
Cold air turns to condensation
And itâs bursting out at the seams

If I were Pilate Iâd sever my steady hands
From ten feet high and six feet down
Did you witness our exchange
As Judas sold his home for a grave?
For a grave

Though we continued to sink down
I saw your face trickle through my once-jaded glass
Not removing but filling all the...
Subdivided spaces between
I held that phantasm at closest scrutiny
To ensure that this was you instead of me

Everything is quiet, subsequently alive:
All this created and perpetually divine
Behold, you make all things anew
Die among us so we may die for you
Everything is quiet, subsequently alive
All this created and perpetually divine
Behold, you make all things anew
Reside among us so we may live for you
How can this be, Lord, how can this be?

Silence O Israel, see the light
Wait for the sound
Chaos of the Cosmos
You wonât relent until we have faces
Chaos of the Cosmos
From every tide, endlessly you emerge

Make us whole
(Make us whole)
Piece our body to our puzzled soul
Guide our feet so we can wander no more
(Make us whole)
Let it be so - Christ Inshallah
Oh, Incarnation, make us whole!

Neither height nor depth could separate us from your Son
Neither life nor death could stand between what youâve begun
As we expire we lift our eyes to you
Come wind, come weather
Churches in prison praising through the walls
You preach petricore as the elect were meant for
We lost our lives, you took this war
You settled the score, oh you settled the score
"Binding the broken, giving sight to the blind,"
Instilling the host of life
