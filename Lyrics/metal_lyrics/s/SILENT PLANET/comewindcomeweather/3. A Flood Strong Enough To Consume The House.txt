Oh my offspring, oh fragile one:
I lay on the altar
When will my reaping end?
When will my reaping end?

You plunged your blade into the horizon
To let it bleed out visceral hues of red for the last time

Such capacity for inhumanity!
Taking in that weâll never again begin
Diverge to a static rot
And if you, oh Lord, reside upon this serene seafloor
Iâm compelled to implore
Did you sink, or did you simply abide in my deep?

Out of nothing, but something, you came
And itâll reap the sow of this tableau tonight
Guards paradoxically living under lock and key
I must rescind my sentience, the nescience I extol
The antithesis of life, that sickness unto death
I must rescind my sentience: the sickness that I know

Faith is to fate, a pale horse to its rider
It is we who are free
No longer captive to your coercive control
I must rescind my sentience: the sickness that I know

Father, I...
I know our margins have widened
But could there be space for a fool to wander this earth,
To ink our name in the blood of a martyr on your footstool?
No boundaries or borders
âI should have been a pair of rugged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas"
But first tell me: Did you see through my opacity?

Innocent, I do not assent to the unrelenting tide
Thereâs blood staining these waters
Evaporated to circle the sky
Innocent, I do not assent to the unrelenting tide
My bloodâs staining your waters
Evaporated to circle the sky
No, âI am a man of unclean lipsâ
Iâll welcome that coal to send away my sin
