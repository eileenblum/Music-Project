I knew one truth, and that truth was the sea.
Cold and knowing, it saw the coward in me.
And as the stain of epochs lines my tongue,
I choked heavy on the past, too numb to speak back.

We're each abandoned by the hands of time
That set us down to sail circles 1 across a straight line.
Sister moon, are we all that's left?
Just a silent satellite and the sigh of flesh. 2

Come down!
And rest your lunar head on my breast,
Listen to the terror tear at my chest.
Our masts in tatters, oars shattered,
Feel free to pull me back to the vast, unforgiving mass.

Should we call this art
My falling apart?
The tangents of an imbalanced heart.
As matter multiplied,
I divide...
But I digress
The deprivation is taking effect.

You said if I stood against my darkness,
Not all of me would die. 3
But all I see on the surface is a shadow
And it occurs to me this could mean suicide.

When you went quiet 4
I turned to silence, 5
Seven sisters 6 draw me back across the moor. 7
Could you still love me in my leaving?
Would you remember me by the moments we forgot?

And as the waves slapped at my raft,
I cursed the fate â like our vows,
They broke at the bow.
Flanked by the mist
I inhaled the breath of existence...
Then you called me for one last time:

"I am the wind â the Be and the Still.
I am the Depths, the Immeasurable Will."
And when I awoke in that Garden,
Lord, did you see me as I was dreaming?

I locked eyes with the storm,
The sky sank down to receive the fury of the sea.
The abolition of my being, 8
The precipice of eternity. 9

Incandescence burst through the black,
The veil was torn 10 as the void collapsed.
The rains will subside.
Be my eyes, 11
Show me hope in the maw of the night.

Our fractured pasts fall into one,
A dozen stars 12 collide as a perpetual sun. 13
And as we disintegrate,
Will you be the
Fire that burns in my lungs?

Breathe me in.
Watch me burn.
Come breath me in.
Breathe me in.
You'll watch me burn.
