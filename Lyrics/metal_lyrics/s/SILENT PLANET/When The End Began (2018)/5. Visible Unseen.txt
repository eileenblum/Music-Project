Speak to me in a language only lovers can understand.
Dance with me in a rhythm only lovers can comprehend.
One fist gripping defiance, other cradling the sacred inside of our hands 1: Pariah.

It's the pain of becoming 2 confronting what stirs within.
I wanted to show you apocalypse 3 so you could see just how this ends as it begins.

No place to rest your head 4,
no respite for an anathema.
Banished for the sin of honesty from the citadel of little hidden hells. 5

Pyroglyphic: I saw Your face inside the fire.
Monolithic: A dominance that dictates desire. 6
Ultimatum: Dual damnations dichotomize me.
Suffocation: Crushed beneath holy hypocrisy.

This isn't love. This is escape.

Exiled into the night,
left to navigate a world that negates our needs:
The Visible Unseen. 7

You're the weight I'll always carry through a world so cold.
You'll never walk alone.
We will find a place to lay our heavy heads.
These lonely roads will always lead you home. 8

Am I only flawed when I am alive?
Only your child if I live denied?
I ask of you, Benevolence, was I made just to be broken? 9

Our faith became a silver shield â insulated from compassion. 10
Praising the prosperity, 11
repressing their identity. 12

I'll show you hell is a place â
it's in the secrets we keep.
Oh, Godâ¦ How those secrets keep me.

This isn't love. This is escape.
This isn't love. This is escape.

Coerced conformity fixed on the dust in their eye.
Forest fires rage in mine. 13

I never thought to askâ¦
When you said she was asleep did you hear my disbelief? 14
The bitter irony, that I wait for God as she dies beside me.

You're the weight I'll always carry through a world so cold.
You'll never walk alone.
We will find a place to lay our heavy heads.
These lonely roads will always lead you home.

We found our place in the disconnect of neglect.
I know these lonely roads will always lead you home.
Until our paths converge give me eyes to see The Visible Unseen.
These lonely roads will always lead you home. 15

Speak to me in a language only lovers can understand.
One fist gripping defiance, other cradling the sacred inside of our hands.
