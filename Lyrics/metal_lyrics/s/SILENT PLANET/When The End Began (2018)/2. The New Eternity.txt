Mother tell me, why do the waters make us sick? 1
Who bleeds the heavens making the clouds rain pestilence? 2
Dropping fever, 3 like manna from the morning sky; 4
Gather your children and hold them as they die. 5

Panic humming in the palm of my hand
Silent vectors injected with the curse of man. 6
Bodies dissected, heartbeats redirected. 7
The past was dead. 8 Why did we resurrect it? 9

Strange fruit 10 grows on the vine 11
Of humankind.
Beneath a bright synthetic sky
I saw the future die.

A web of wires in our mind
Weaves an empire down our spine. 12
I fear we've sealed our fate.
There's no escape
There's no escape: The New Eternity.

Strange fruit is growing on the vine
Beneath a bright synthetic sky.
I fear we've sealed our fate.
There's no escape
There's no escape: The New Eternity.

Germinating extinction. 13

The people unite when you dose 14 them with fearâ¦ 15
Relinquish their will, let their objections disappear.
Crowds galvanized by vapid words 16
And septic slurs 17,
Utterly transfixed 18
By the fiction of the "greater good." 19

Estranged in this age 20
We set sail to the stars;
Return to the earth still unaware of who we are. 21
We've come too far.
We've come too far.
We've come too far
It's all I know.
The darkness didn't die,
No, we brought it home. 22

I sowed a secret deep in the earth, but despite the world it grew
I knew all things could be made new.
All things will be made new. 23

A web of wires in our mind
Weaves an empire down our spine.
I fear we've sealed our fate.
There's no escape
There's no escape: The New Eternity.

Strange fruit is growing on the vine
Beneath a bright synthetic sky.
I fear we've sealed our fate.
There's no escape
There's no escape: The New Eternity.

Cross the Great Divide and see
Light and Dark collide in me.
Shake the shroud of secrecy, 24
Uproot the grim hegemony. 25
