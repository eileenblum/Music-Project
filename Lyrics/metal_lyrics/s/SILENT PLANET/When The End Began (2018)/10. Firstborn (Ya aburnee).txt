You bury me.

Glass clouds shed their autumn skin
Kiss the mourning stems as they bow to the wind;
Heads hung like wartime mothers
As the congregants struggle to console one another.

We're bandaged together, soothing the surcease.
Huddled inside the fog â beneath the barren trees. 1
Budding youth, unfettered by absolutes:
Do branches wither first when there's blood on the roots?

Can you stretch a moment into a thousand?
"Away from the quiet collapse of it all." 2

I know the
Know who knows you,
I see the
See who sees you.

I'll follow you into forever. 3

I memorized your pain,
I put my thoughts inside your name.
Little Light, can't you see?
You're supposed to be the one who buried me.

I tried to stop the flood.
I tried to pull you from the tide;
Now you paint the sky with distant fire.

The room lay quiet, sowing silence
Watching lifelines stream through wilting arteries.
Dreams crash with awe behind your roving eyes. 4
How I envy the calm that occupies your mind.

Drifting just above the flatline
That keeps your thoughts displaced from mine.
I can't divert the current,
I divide and wash ashore.

I'll try to write you to rest
Plant you inside my prose. 5
Yet my resolve,
Does it shake beneath a four-foot casket shadow.

The ink has spilled across the page,
Shaping surviving sun to shade. 6
Valleys and peaks, in grief,
Descend into a ceaseless sleep.

See how the night unfolds
Constellations welcome you home. 7
Adrift in the river beyond our memories...
You bury me.

I memorized your pain,
I put my thoughts inside your name.
Little Light, can't you see?
You're supposed to be the one who buried me.

I tried to stop the flood.
I tried to pull you from the tide;
Now you paint the sky with distant fire.

I memorized your pain,
(I memorized your pain)
I put my thoughts inside your name.
Little Light, can't you see?
(can't you see?)
You're supposed to be the one who buried me.

I tried to stop the flood.
I tried to pull you from the tide;
Now you paint the sky with distant fire.
