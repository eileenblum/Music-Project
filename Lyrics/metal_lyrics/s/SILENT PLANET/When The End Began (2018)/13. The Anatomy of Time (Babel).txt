Certain was the fear trembling in your father's chest
Encountering the ancients 1 in a graveyard for those who never rest.
"Even the wind lay still," 2 as time revealed the fools we are.

Quiet monoliths appear,
Suspended in the air. 3
Solemn in their countenance, impervious to fear.

Marveling at the symmetry that binds and brings us here
Separating threads of space, distinctions disappear.

Take all of your answers
Throw them in the flames.
I'll keep the questions,
I'll take the rain. 4

Defend all your doctrines
Those lies you had sworn.
I'll wander through the night,
I'll sleep in the storm.

I'll follow you to the end.
I'll weather the world.
I'll sleep 5 in the storm.

I'll follow you to the end...
Where time has no beginning.

I pulled the past apart
Future's unraveled with its plans.
To my chagrin the answers
Felt hollow in my hands.

Adorned with memories that form the tapestry of life.
Collective accounts of consciousness from virtue to vice.

"Where are you now?"
My voice echoed in that canyon.
I turned to find you lynched,
Choking with abandon.

The scope of time, at first profuse,
Now twisted to the shape of a noose.
We wanted see forever,
But instead we saw the truth.

Species of the nightmare, 6
People of the dream: 7
Language is your prison, 8 but also the key.
Confront the heart of fear;
Behold the shape of destiny.

Spinning in the circles, 9 waltz with the sun.
"There's no time, many turn to one." 10

Take all of your answers
Throw them in the flames.
I'll keep the questions,
I'll take the rain.

Defend all your doctrines
Those lies you had sworn.
I'll wander through the night,
I'll sleep in the storm.

I'll follow you to the end.
I'll weather the world.
(I'll sleep in the storm.)

I'll follow you to the end.
I'll weather the world.
Where time has no beginning.

Blinded by shadow of what we've seen
Empty in our depths of understanding.
Burdened with the weight of paradox,
I fear we have been sentenced to be free. 11
