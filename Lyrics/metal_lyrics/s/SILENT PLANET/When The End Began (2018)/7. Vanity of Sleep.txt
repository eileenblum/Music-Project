This is a love affair
With consumer despair 1,
An emptiness I can call my ownâ¦ 2
An arbitrary
Sanctuary 3
Where we deposit prayers to a dispensable god. 4

Welcome to the end stage age 5
Where joy is a pill and love's a prescription.
Vaccinated with an outward suspicion,
Isolation became our pre-existing condition. 6

Manifested drudge of my mass-manufactured consentâ¦ 7
But there's a gaping hole in my consciousness:
A deep that cries out to deep. 8

This is a love affair
With consumer despair,
An emptiness I can call my own:
An antidote for mystery,
Our indifference is deafening.

There's a presence here 10
It stirs inside the static
Dissonance of discontent that refused to relent.

I built a home overlooking a graveyard to remind myself I'm still alive.
Yet you see a flaw still abides as I witness an ending that I can't contrive.

We watched a golden array
Of a casket parade
As wealth makes it's final display
To the ground.
I found it strange
That even in this place
Death became
Such a gainful exchange.

Give me something to hold,
Give me something that bleeds.
I'll scour the earth for my identity. 11
Is there a cure for a sick society? 12

So rich in this world, so in debt to ourselves.
The network of life in such a disconnect. 13
How many times must we die this death?

Annihilation is all we are.
Desolation is everything I know.

All we are is all we love 14 and everything I know is destructible.
Artificial heart, obsidian soul: Encircled by dreams that are combustible. 15

We trade the Garden for Cities 16, the Tree for a Tower 17,
Surrendered our faith, became addicted to power.
I know that hope grows inside of the Wound 18
And I know progress is empty 19
I must Be Consumed 20

So I'll dig through these masks 'til I find my face;
Separate from the false pretense I embraced. 21
It kills me to know that you'll never find peace.
You can have all the world but you'll never be free. 22

Tear the stitches sewn across my existence.
Cut me out from this nothingness.

Dusk will come and lay to rest our fleeting, fading, silhouettes. 23
