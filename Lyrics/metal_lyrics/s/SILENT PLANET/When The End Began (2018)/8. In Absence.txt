Find me in the silence, tell me where I've been.
The air is growing colder, the clouds are caving in.

I lost the sound of your voice in the winter sun.
I dreamed that dawn would wake us, but morning never comes.

I watched you go away.
I watched the colors fade.

I can't bear the pain of losing yesterday to a world of grey.

I found you in the shadows following a ghost.
I thought you felt my presence, but we were still alone.

Where do you turn when the corners of the room run from you?
And how it burns to be a memory lost in a mind you never knew.

I watched you go away.
I watched the colors fade.

I can't bear the pain of losing yesterday to a world of grey.

My fading sunset, swaying precarious in the sand.
Every grain a lingering moment, slipping through the cracks in my hand.

Disintegrating in the predawn light:
A memory eroded by time.
I'll turn with your reversing clock and describe the color when you can't see the sunrise.

I watched you go away.
I watched the colors fade.

I can't bear the pain of losing yesterday to a world of grey. 1
