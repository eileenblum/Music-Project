tired to watch out for my lost feelings once I had
(my mind was lost anywhere in other dimensions)
tired to think about all my mistakes I have made
(time is not moving, the time is creeping, it makes me sick)
once I've done all for you but now I have enough
(when will I have my time to sleep for a while)

flowing tears - I can't see the light
will somebody catch me - if I fall
kiss my lost time good night
because the black bird is calling

my mind was lost anywhere in other dimensions
(now break this peace destroying all my memories)
time is not moving, the time is creeping, it makes me sick
(I know I can't remake all the things I loose)
when will I have my time to sleep for a while
(I would live this lost moments I choose)

so my heart is standing still
if I can't feel the tenderness
without your love inside of me
I would leave this world in loneliness
