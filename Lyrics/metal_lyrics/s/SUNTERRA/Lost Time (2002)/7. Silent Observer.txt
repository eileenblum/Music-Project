I observe I inspect
to satisfy my delight
you can't hide your thoughts from me
(I'm everywhere)
I lie next to you during you fall asleep
I examine my sweetest puppet
take your soul suck my breath
nest me inside your thoughts
you can't run away from me
(I'm everywhere)
love to play with your live It's so easy to see
(you'll never find out)
but you will never know my sweetest puppet
(so your way of live is certain)

I'm the leader of your mind
you're the perfect sacrifice
never rest and never stop
to have a pleasure with you
I'm the leader of your mind
you're the perfect sacrifice
never rest and never stop
I'm the silent observer

ich nehme dir den atem
und dann deine seele
ich raub' dir die gedanken
denn ich bin uberall
und spiele mit deinem leben
