are you able to feel my pain
have I ever seen the light in my life
I can't remember the days once I felt
felt the fear and lost control
I have never seen lovely people
only war we make to all of us
only hate and destruction of every life
I don't want to live here any more

my body is a prison
I can't feel I can't see
show me the way out
I want to feel I want to see

my life is not what it used to be live in sadness
spending time with waiting waiting for an end for the light

there is no chance for me to live
praying all the time for changing things
but nobody have ever heard this words from me
I am forever damned
see the angels flying away
take my soul with them on their way
but none of them takes care for it
none of them have heard my painful screams
