a time ago my friend you are gone
there's no chance to turn back time
my unspoken words you've never heard
take your last ride and wait for me
I can see you there from far away
and I'm waiting to speak the unspoken words

you're inside - never forget you
so much time - we've spend
my lost soul - no pain
helping hands - protecting you

there are many words I've never said
and that's the reason I feel so sad
I'm so sorry for things I did
and I hope that you will forgive

don't worry about what happened before
I am here for you and will forgive

when my time arrives
I will follow you
into another world
a place without pain and sorrow
