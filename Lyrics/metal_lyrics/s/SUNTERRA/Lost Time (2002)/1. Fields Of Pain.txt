the sun has woken me up
ray of sunlight burned my eyes
I stood up and looked around
wide fields without an end
I walked through and turned around
the same fields started to burn
bloodstained earth under my feet
I heard the screams of hundred men

see us going down-face the fear
crawling along this fields of pain
we're on the brink of disaster
where fireballs want to catch us

I closed my tired eyes again
hoped that this dream would be gone
woke up with tears in my eyes
back in my time and dimension
but I felt myself so cold
I took a look into the mirror
my own reflection dissolved
and spoke by the voice of another
