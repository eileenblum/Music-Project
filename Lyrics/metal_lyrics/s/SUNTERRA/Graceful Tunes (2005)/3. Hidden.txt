The sound of ringing bells
Disturbs our peaceful sleep,
The ancient ghosts will wake up,
If someone spells the old words.
Silently the gates had opened
And spat out army of soulless wraiths.
We live in the night hidden from mankind,
Identify us by our eyes.
Inside the forest we are waiting,
Armed only with immortal will.
For the fight between the nations
Of destruction and of life.
Grow very fond of human race,
We are the bearer of light.
We live in the night hidden from mankind,
Identify us by our eyes.
