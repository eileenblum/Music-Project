Late at night I can hear
Whispering behind the wall
Suddenly my girl comes in
Looks like a Black-rubber-doll
She holds the whip in her hand,
Now I can't do stupid things,
I go down on my knees -
Quid est libertas?
With a smile on her face
But strictness in her voice
I can taste my sweat
I don't have any choice
She holds the whip in her hand,
Now I can't do stupid things,
I go down on my knees -
Quid est libertas?
Hey girl - I'm not your slave!
I will gag you that's true
Show you how I imagine
What you should do
I hold the whip in my hand,
Now you can't do stupid things,
My lovely black rubber doll -
Meum est libertas!
Odisse!
Die Menschen lieben von Natur aus die Freiheit
Und hassen den Zustand der Knechtschaft.
