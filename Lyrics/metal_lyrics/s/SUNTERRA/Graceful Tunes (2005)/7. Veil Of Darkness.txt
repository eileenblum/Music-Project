Waiting for, the rising moon in my Lunarium,
A stormy night, the wind is hunting clouds.
While all around me the fairies waiting are,
Sitting on the trees with their soulless look.
While all around me the fairies waiting are,
Sitting on the trees with their soulless look.
I'm so paralyzed by the spirit of the light,
That I perceive without moving my eyes.
The veil of darkness is falling over us,
I hunt with the wind through the forest,
The strength of Luna bans the water,
And bans us by her rising every night.
I dive into the lake of passion and trance
While my body doesn't move from its place.
The veil of darkness is falling over us,
I hunt with the wind through the forest,
The strength of Luna bans the water,
And bans us by her rising every night.
