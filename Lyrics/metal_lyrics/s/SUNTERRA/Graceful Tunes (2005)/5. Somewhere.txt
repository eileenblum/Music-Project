Walking with hope inside,
Illusions fade away,
Through the colors of the night,
Miles and miles along this way.
When I was born, my star was worried looking down.
Now in this universe lights turned off.
Like a lonesome wolf I wander around in my isolation.
What would I give for a soulful friend!
Somewhere under the stars there is a creature like me.
Many loves have crossed my way, all unique shooting stars,
And they have fallen from the sky, tonight.
I passed the lonely darkness bare,
And dared into the lion's lair.
What would I have given for a loving friend!
But what about the world today and all the people on their way.
Can't you see, that we need each other to live.
No matter, if the sky turns grey, there comes a time you will say,
Finally my dream comes true.
Somewhere under the stars there is a creature like me.
