Far away in a Northern landscape, governed by rocks,
There's a dark body of water, surrounded by a forest,
Seeming bottomless, sunken trees drift in it,
Misty haze rises from the water, fills up the air.
Every dusk I move to this place, my destiny,
To look there after my drowned love, long ago
Because on the bottom of this pond, my darling stays,
And dreams the everlasting Dream of Eternity.
Don't go too close ashore -
Or else my darling reaches for you,
And draws you downwards to himself and
Never lets you go.
At this place we made love for the first time,
And in this pond you had to give your life,
Directed by destiny, I dive into this water,
To the bottom of it, till I can see his pale face.
Don't go too close ashore -
Or else my darling reaches for you,
And draws you downwards to himself and
Never lets you go.
