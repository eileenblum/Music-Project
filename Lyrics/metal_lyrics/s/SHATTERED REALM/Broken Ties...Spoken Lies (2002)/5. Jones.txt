From the time our friendship ended you were so involved.
In what was going on in my life.
But you can't fathom all that you have done.
Welcome to your demise.
How can you live with yourself?
Well I won't let you live with yourself.
This is the last straw.
Two faced bitch half stepping punk.
Ya you sure did get a rise out of me.
Now I'm making it my mission in life to take away the air you breathe.
Now you must face me and die.
How can you live with you yourself?
Well I won't let you live with yourself.
This is the last straw.
