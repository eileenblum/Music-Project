This time you've pushed me too far.
No turning back, now it's time to put up or shut up.
You were warned but you ignored.
Now you're going to get what you deserve so just watch your back.
You'll never get the best of me.
Never. I'll never rest until you bleed.
Never. You'll never get the best of me, Never.
You can't beat me.
You can't stop me.
You won't kill me, I'm eternal.
