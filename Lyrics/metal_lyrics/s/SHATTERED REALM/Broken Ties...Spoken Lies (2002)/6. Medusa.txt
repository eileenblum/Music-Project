Forcing myself to go on is futile.
I'll never surpass your standards.
To say I miss you is a misinterpretation.
That would mean I would have let you go.
Life equals loss.
I accpet it.
I'm only seeking a way out.
From all these years I spent alone.
One look from you turn me to stone.
I thought forever was real.
But the wounds won't heal.
