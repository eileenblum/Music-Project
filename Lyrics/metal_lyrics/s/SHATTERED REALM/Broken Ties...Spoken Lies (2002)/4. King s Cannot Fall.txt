Watch you as you fall down from heaven like so many dead angels.
Time tore the power from your wings.
Lurk in the shadows as your every move is watched.
Dawning the regime of a new king.
I'm more than god more than the devil.
Kings cannot fall.
With a ready fist clenched at my side.
Kings cannot fall.
I'm more than god more than the devil.
Kings cannot fall.
We make the rules that you live by.
Kings cannot fall.
In the pain of my hand.
We can't fall kings cannot fall.
