Seek revenge on those who've done you wrong.
The crown will stay where it belongs.
Conquer all your enemies, make them suffer.
You will never kill us all.
Tear apart the ones who hold us down.
Rise above, forever stand your ground.
Conquer all your enemies, make them suffer.
You will never kill us all.
This is a way you cannot win.
