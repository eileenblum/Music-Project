Demons calling baptized in your blood.
Angels falling baptized in your blood.
In your blood hence creating an enemy of the world.
Overcome with hatred crucified by words.
I looked back on an age of ruin vile as thy name.
There's only one way to go from here forced back to a world of pain.
There was a time emotions died.
Demons awakened.
There was a time before my, demons awakened.
Reborn from the ashes overcome with visions of the blackest dawn.
Risen from the ashes only just begun to be destroyed.
Good as dead to you and I.
I am master and slave.
Spoken lies broken ties now you must die.
Evil coming back for me.
Chaos and nothing can save.
