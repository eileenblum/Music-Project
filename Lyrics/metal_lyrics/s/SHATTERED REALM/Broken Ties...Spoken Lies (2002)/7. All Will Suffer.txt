As the days go by I watched you die.
All of my life you've been there for me.
I thought you would never be gone.
Until it all came crashing down.
And I stood in disbelief.
To the day you'll come again.
To the heavens from beneath.
I could never face you.
After where you've been.
Penance on the highest level.
To be dead again.
No escape.
Why has thou forsaken me god?
Through my vengeance.
All will suffer.
You took the life.
I avenge it.
In my memory.
You shall live on.
I never felt so much pain as the days I watched you die.
