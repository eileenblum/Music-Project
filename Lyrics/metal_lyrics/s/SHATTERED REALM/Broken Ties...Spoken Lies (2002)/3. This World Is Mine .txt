Look in my eyes tell me what you see.
A broken down man from the misery and defeat.
But I'll die to protect what's mine.
And that's something you're afraid of.
This world is mine, You can't trust anyone.
This world is mine, nowhere left to run.
This world is mine, can't trust anyone.
This world is mine, no way out.
Your first mistake pay with your life.
No second chance the games are over.
I'm taking all that you possess.
Elitist in the truest form you can't beat me.
This world is mine, you can't trust anyone.
This world is mine, nowhere left to run.
This world is mine, can't trust anyone.
This world is mine, no way out.
This world is mine crippled ship in the path of the storm.
Breath of sin in the path of the righteous.
Your acts won't go unpunished because this world is mine.
Bring the world back down.
