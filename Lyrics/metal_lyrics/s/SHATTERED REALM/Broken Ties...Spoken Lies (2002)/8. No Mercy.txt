For what's it's worth your life is meaningless.
You think you're hard but you'll never ever step to this.
Disrespect all that I hold true.
Now I bestow on you.
Pain eternal suffering misery and hatred everlasting vengeance.
Vengeance for what you have done.
Under my reign.
Retribution.
You will then be.
Shown no mercy.
And you will face the hand of doom.
