Hear my voice, hear my words
Never forget my face
Now it's time to feel the pain
and be put in your place
Never considered the backlash
of your own twisted words
You won't have to live with this mistake
You crossed the wrong path
Sent to meet your maker
Last chances don't exist
Rejected and banished
Redeem yourself from this
It's your turn
Your sheer disrespect of my trust and my faith
This one mistake I made will never repeat itself
There's no redemption for your treachery
No redemption it's your turn
And you meet your end - Meet your maker now!
