You never impressed me!

You're the new disgrace
New kids out to prove
Never earned a thing
WE DON'T NEED YOU

NEVER LEARNED ANYTHING
WHEN YOU'RE HANDED EVERYTHING

No more
excuses or complaints
Those silver
spoons are bound to rust one day

ONE
DAY

Swallow your pride and face the truth
It's time to shine but you're too dull
You'll never be anything

WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
