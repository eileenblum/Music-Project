From my closest friend to enemy
It's been years since you were a part
of something that matters
Everything you once spoke out on
Took a stand, fell through
I just can't believe I wasted
all my trust on you
Not even half of what you once
were to me
Useless

From my closest friend to enemy
Turn coat

You don't have a fucking clue
Never thought things would get to this
Me and you coming to blows
Your world in ruins, your dead to me

Never have a clue to how far you've fallen
