Fallen friends, live forever
Gone but not FORGOTTEN
We carry on in your name
Fallen friends live forever

We carry your memory
'til the day WE MEET AGAIN
In our hearts in our minds
fallen friends live forever
Not one day passes by
when you're not by my side
No matter where I'm at
you're always on my mind
Some people come and go
and never meant anything
We stand out we stand tall
loved by none hated by all

When I look back to the
times we had
Fighting and losing our
fucking minds
Good times and bad we stood
side by side
Life ain't the same but we
gotta try..
FOREVER FAMILY
