You choke this world upon a massive grove of lies
false pretenses and broken promises collide
I've seen you play the fool just one too many times
Theres no gold for you at the end of this rainbow

I abhour your wretched ways
You're the serpent in eden
You're poison to all who can't
see past that crooked smile
I see through the games
I know where you're weak
I've heard all the tales
You can't fool me again
with a kiss and the lame
Promise of a forever

The devil in disguise
your beauty is wearing thin
The world will see through you
and you will have nothing..

I hope you drown in your own oceans of deceit
They'll be no mourning or thoughts of remorse
