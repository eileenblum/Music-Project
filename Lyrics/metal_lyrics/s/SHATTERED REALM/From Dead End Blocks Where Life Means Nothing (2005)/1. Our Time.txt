We came here to take the fucking world
No one dared to stand in our way
YOU CAN'T STOP US
Nothing ever fucking will
THIS IS OUR TIME
Going to tear this place apart

NOTHING IN OUR WAY...

We been battling up hill for far too fucking long
Had our mind set on the crown
and took this fucking world
Can't confine us any longer
Nothing in our way
Our destiny in our hands
Nothing in our way
