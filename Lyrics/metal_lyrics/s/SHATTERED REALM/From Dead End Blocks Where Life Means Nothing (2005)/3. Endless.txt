No More Blood
Resurrection from the dead
Destined to regain hope
Taken back all that is owed
from this decayed void
against all odds
Bent but never broken
against all odds
We're always down but never out
Never out, no lost blood
Taking back, no more blood
Endless casualties, no tears for the weak
Endless
