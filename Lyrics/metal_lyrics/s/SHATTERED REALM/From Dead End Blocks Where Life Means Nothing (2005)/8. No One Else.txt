You lack the courage to live your life disciplined
falling behind the human race more and more
I know the way I live you despise
At least I know I'm not scared to get by
this world tears me apart
but I won't let your ways keep me down
I've been down that road before, I've seen where it ends
I lead the life I lead for me- No One Else
No One can turn me which way to turn
I'll turn the other way just out of spite
I know the way I live you despise
At least I know I'm not scared to get by
this world tears me apart
But I won't let your ways keep me down
I've been down that road before, I've seen where it ends
I lead the life I lead for me- No One Else
I will not back down... Back down to No One.
