I will not rest until you are six feet fucking deep

By the time I'm through with you
you'll embrace the gates of hell
For all the misery I'll
exact my due revenge

Thought you could hide
but never for long
Can't hide your sins
You are condemned
Your fates decided
Sentenced to death
Law of the land
..never again!

Innocence stolen
Family in ruins
Dead as her dreams
Her life just began

The blood still fresh
Crimson red stained
Marked on your soul
Dead man standing

Revenge
for all the pain

By the time you taste the flames
you'll be torn limb from limb
Forced the sorrow and
drown in your own agony
