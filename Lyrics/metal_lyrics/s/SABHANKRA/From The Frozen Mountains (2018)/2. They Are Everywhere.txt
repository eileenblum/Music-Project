Your mercy led us here
This was not the route to follow
I don't care about the rules
You brought us to our end
That thing, out there, somewhere
Growing fast to taste our flesh
This damn tracker shows nothing
I don't know which way to choose
They are everywhere!
They devour our bright future,
They are everywhere!
I'm about to drown in sweat,
They are everywhere!
I will have one chance
As fire overcomes the acid
I'll be far away as the growns meet the space
This nightmare
I had found myself in
Won't let me be myself again
It pings inside my head
How to get rid of my visions?
They are everywhere!
It pings inside my head
They are everywhere!
I feel it in my head,
They are everywhere!
