He stands in the night
Faces his army
You are to die
Your souls will live!
He waits 'til moon falls
All curse the sunrise
He lifts his dark sword
Screams as he drops
Die!
An army of death
Marches through the gates
Towers won't hold out
City will burn
Soldiers run away
For their lives now
Women raped and men impaled
Screams of children
Crying for their loss
Gates are crushed and
The fog is coming down
Fear and sorrow
Rules the lands now
Crushed under the fist of the new reign!
He stands in the night
Faces his army
You are to die
Your souls will live!
He waits 'til moon falls
All curse the sunrise
He lifts his dark sword
Screams as he drops
Die!
An army of death
Marches through the gates
Towers won't hold out
City will burn
Soldiers run away
For their lives now
Women raped and men impaled
Screams of children
Crying for their loss
Gates are crushed and
The fog is coming down
Crushed under the fist of the new reign!
Crushed under the fist of the new reign!
Crushed under the fist of the new reign!
Crushed under the fist of the new reign!
