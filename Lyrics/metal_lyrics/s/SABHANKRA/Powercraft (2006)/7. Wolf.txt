Evil attacked the village, everyone's died
Mothers love can't endure, children cried
Only the one survived, a little boy
Shall drown in swamp, he is loosing blood

Beloved wolf please feed me, I'm so hungry
Give me fresh meat, I have to eat
No pleasure anymore, all will be done
When I grow up, I'll be the one

Evil heard that the boy is alive,
Sent the warrior to end his life
Is it easy to take the life
From the body of chosen one

Wolf carried him to towards the shore
Sheltered him in their caves
Brings fourth young, just ten boys
Fertiled lowland sheltered all
When they grow up they went out
Found then girls and they got married
Seven settled down the mountain
And wolf shows the way... She carried...
