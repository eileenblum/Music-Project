All is red, the sky, the sea and the time
All is dead, our memories of this crime
Could rain, could it erase the pain
The sky is darkened
The sun is hiding behind the mountain

Dropping tears for a new dawn
We'll never see the sun
So hard to breath, welcome to death
All hopes are gone

My hands are covered of blood
Tears and blood became a river
Shores of Death are crying for their fate
Death and pain and sand...
This is our sorrowland
How tasty is being the ruler
Arise from your throne through the sky
Watch your back, enemy is waiting the dawn

Mastering the arth of power is not easy at all...
