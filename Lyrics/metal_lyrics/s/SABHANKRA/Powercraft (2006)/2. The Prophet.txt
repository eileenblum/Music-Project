The newborn child will bring the end
All will watch the burning land
Believing me, I'm saying truth
Listen to my words, its the prophet

Destruction and pain
The curse will reign
There would be one way
All shall pay

The death is coming by sea
Prepare yourself, see what eyes see
Shores of hell - burning in pain
Run for battle, prepare your spear

I feel the winds of conquer

I pray for the rain
I cray for the domain
