There stands a piece of heaven
There stands the gift of god
The conqueror of miracles...

They poured cannons of freatness
The vessels sailed on earth
The conqueror of miracles was consented
By the city of tulips

And then there was silence, leave all your arms
Heal your sores , restore your ground

There builded a palace for the memory of war
In this great cathedral of Hagia-Sophia
The tulips of heaven... sprouted from the ground

And then there was silence, leave all your arms
Geal your sores, restore your ground
And then there was violence for us all
Take your swords, die and crawl
