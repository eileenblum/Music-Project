A hope inside, damaging your heat,
No one can stop, bring the wrath

Is it a curse, fear of reverse
Always in your mind,
All is written in these verses
Take out your sword and grind
Fell the power deep inside
Trust yourself, stay upright
Ride your horse and fight

Ride beyond the horizon
Bring the winter from mountains high
Don't wait for tomorrow
Cause tomorrow never comes
