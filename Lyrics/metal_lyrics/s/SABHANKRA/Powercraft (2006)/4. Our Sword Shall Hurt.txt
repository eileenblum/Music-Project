A land over mountains, ready to unite
It shall be ours after this fight
We shall shorten distances so hard to see
We shall save our brothers, so glad to hear

Warriors in the way of truth, let'em blow the horn
Let'em ride for worlds future, for the unborn

Our sword shall hurt, endless lands are ours
Land shall suck your blood, and shall spit for wrath
