Upon the ones his curse shall be
He spoke to me
The words gained meaning when they are spoken
He gave my mission
And my duty gained worth on their preconception

The pandemonium we live in
shall be breached
By the authority I have been given
To demolish the corruption
That takes shelter in our progression

The last breath given
Death gains meaning when it opens a door to a new life
Reward waits me on the other side
My duty has come to an end

My blood must spill
Again and again I must kill
