For days and nights we carried our flag
Higher than skies and brighter than suns
But you don't know you are not the one
The one who will suffer

Be sure there is no place to hide and to run
I will be the one who lightens our side , iâll burn you alive !

There is no place to hide , there is no place to run
Iâll burn you alive !
