A great battle awaits the kingdom
For a better future , for a peaceful life
Slavery wonât be our fate

Our broken chains will cover the ground
Round the chains flowers will grow
Mother Nature will welcome our sons
When we unchain our sons darkened fate
Let blood refresh their world

Our Kingdom Shall Rise !

Draw your swords, victory is near
Face your death without fear

Father we will follow your way
Your dream â i will guard
From now there is nothing to say
And there is no doubt
Our kingdom Shall Rise !
