At least for me - it's the decisive day
This is the day of our great fight
I will find your sheltered, lost, hidden cave
No ray of light will be your guide

I'll break your bones
I'll cut your throat
I'll crush your head
(But) you won't be dead

Tonight you'll suffer

Your life is mine, your soul is mine
When pain is yours heavens are mine
