Raise your head high,
Just look around and see the light
Raise your head high,
Find the truth inside your heart
Raise your head high,
Release your hate and feel your might
Raise your head high,
The way you'll walk - honor shall guide

Just ride forward,
Follow the light

Raise your head high,
Just look around and see the light
Raise your head high,
Find the truth inside your heart
Raise your head high,
Release your hate and feel your might
Raise your head high,
The way you'll walk honor shall guide

Widen your sight,
Follow the light
