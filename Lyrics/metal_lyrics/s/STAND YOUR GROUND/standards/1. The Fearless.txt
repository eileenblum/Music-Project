You're so proud
They're just like you
They turned their backs on everything you do
You're so proud
They're just like you
Your motives crush everything you knew

You made one mistake
You never thought I would learn of what you've done
You said you'd turn things around
But all you've done is turn your back
It's time now
Step forward from the crowd
Become a man without fear
Regardless of the consequences
Because I am courageous
I am fearless
When this place crumbles and falls
I'll be waiting right here
When this place crumbles and falls
And comes crashing on you
It's time now
Step forward from the crowd
Become a man without fear
Regardless of the consequences
Because I am courageous

Severed ties between truth and lies
Stay away from me and my life
White lies lead you to oblivion
White lies lead you to destruction

Impaling the backs of the ones you love
Cross the horizon without looking back
With your cold shoulder turned toward us
You make your way into the black
It's time now
Step forward from the crowd
Become a man without fear
Regardless of the consequences
Because I am courageous
I am courageous

I am fearless
