Give it back
The time you've taken from me
I gave you all I could
But you didn't give it back

When you crave control
Bound by guilt all alone
This place is not your own

I can't believe I listened to a word you said
A change of time
A change of mind
You change your mind and face

Blind faith
A blank page
We're all trapped inside this cage

Was it for the pleasure of watching us squirm
What did you expect to gain?
Did you think that you could take what is mine with no retribution or blame?

Betrayer / deceiver

A victim of consequence and a second chance
Where is your self-respect?
This is where trust meets insecurity
To blur the lines between

[2x]
Honesty isn't a virtue
It's a rarity
It must have passed you by

Was it for the pleasure of watching us squirm
What did you expect to gain?
Did you think that you could take what is mine with no retribution or blame?

Betrayer / deceiver

[2x]
This is a call out
We are calling you out

We are calling you out

Was it for the pleasure of watching us squirm
What did you expect to gain?
Did you think that you could take what is mine with no retribution or blame?

Driven by guilt and loneliness
You'll always be alone
Cut off from love and friendship is right where you belong
