The pressure builds.
in the end we'll die alone.
there's no polish for our lost luster.
we're exhausted. we're sold out.
bare your teeth like the lion you are.
send your fire for we deserve to burn.
you built these walls, only to see us ruin the foundation you laid.
and for what? for what?
where were you when i prayed so selfishly?
where were you when i slept so recklessly? where were you?
still i keep routines and I'll never understand why.
sitting complacently, god bless this mess I've made.
I've failed.
no medication. no professional opinion.
I've failed.
bring me to your arms. warm my cold heart.
