without a glimmer of hope in our eyes,
we'll continue to live in darkness
with no ounce of salvation, stagnant we will stay
i'm content with being stagnant, i'm content to stay in hell
i'll quit looking for the answers. they'll all find me
please let the sun shine tomorrow. please let my demons be.
i (am not a martyr) i (won't be an example)
don't let the sun go down on my head
i can't handle another year like
this with all this weight on my shoulders, i don't know how long i can stand.
i won't be the catalyst to my end.
