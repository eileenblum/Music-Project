I'm sorry I've been a terrible excuse for a seed that you planted.
I've been given the world on a silver spoon and i choked on it all.
now I'm choking on my final words.
I'm choking. I'm still choking.
why did my sun refuse to shine?
why did eyes refuse to see that what you gave was more than enough for me?
this is a life no one chose for me. this is 21 years of living.
21 years of failure and pain. i need a new beginning.
here comes my renaissance
is this what you wanted?
because I'll run, I'll run till there's nothing left.
I'll keep swimming without my breath.
I'll fall into your arms.
i know you'll wait for your prodigal son.
