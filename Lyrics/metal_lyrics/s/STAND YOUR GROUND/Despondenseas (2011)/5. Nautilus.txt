born into silver. caressed in gold.
living without rigor.
I've bitten the hand that once fed my growing appetite
my insatiable lust for living my life
i can't seem to break these chains from my calloused hands
this crown on my head. feverishly i await my fall
and with regret comes the holy ghost of loneliness
with my eyes clouded over and no sky above,
I'll reach out to nothing and find nothing in return
I'll reach out. I'll find nothing.
constantly i spit in the face of open arms
only to watch them continue to hold
I'll forget my past and just move on, move on
still smoke fills my lungs still I'm drowning in regret 
still regret drowns me
this is for my own life. this one's mine.
i will be the spark to ignite this forest.
i am my own
