I can't believe what that week did to me
our adult hearts.
you're teenage mind.
the road to hell we traveled is the road you've yet to leave.
self destruction sure has its perks.
look at all you've lost.
i hope your ears still bleed.
you're dust to us all. i hope you're ears still bleed.
you're forgotten.
i can't say you never meant anything to me.
i can't say you never will.
as the whiskey drowned you, i still held out my hand.
you looked up and laughed and said you never needed me.
from now on you will be spit in my mouth.
keep swimming, keep sinking
you can't feel that alive if you're that dead inside.
tip your bartender leave me be
