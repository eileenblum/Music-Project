not one single breath could lead me astray
turn your green eyes to me and tell me i'm safe
because for too long
i've lived for the day
that you'll play noble martyr out of my way
this is new ground. this ends right now
this ends with me peeling your eyes back so you can see
what good is left in this race that we claim?
who then do we turn to with lives untamed?
we are the bastard child of morality
we pray and we pray to reclaim our sanity.
three cheers for the absence of purity
let's see if our footprints match our tattered feet
if this is your life, leave me be
cynical as you are, set me free
i won't be your whipping boy
i won't be your shelter
dear whoever reads this letter, just know the selfish part of me caused this hurt
