to a dead generation
to an over zealous few
there's no piss
running through your veins you all see right through
this red, white, and green
an attempt to rape what once was free
still we follow blindly, into a grand hypocrisy
where is your voice?
where is your fire?
content to stay the same,
we've lost all desire
where is our marquee? our bright lights?
day in, day out, we're still invisible  
find the strength to burn your torch
stay awake. stay the course.
it's all just begun.
we'll all spill scarlet the same,
only we'll not stand and cower.
i stand and pledge allegiance to a myriad of lies.
