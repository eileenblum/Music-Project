i refuse to stay on my knees rotting for nothing
with every ounce of strength and every promise made,
I'm in hell.
i'm still bitter and this seat is where i'll stay.
here's to opportunity that came and went.
I know it's small. I know it's not worth the hours spent.
There's a godless desolation in the golden state.
thanks to you i dream no more.
i pray to the sky that you become a product of your damnation.
i could sit and beg for days on end
leaving me nowhere to go.
i'd rather see your skin crawl.
i just hope you too are left with nothing at all.
and to my satisfaction, you're still face down.
