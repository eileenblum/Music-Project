These are the pieces of my dreams set in motion
These are the prospects for which man strives
The fragments fall around synchronically
And the vision of ascension becomes reality

As the veil of night shrouds the light of day
As sleep fights away all the consciousness in me
Sporadic neurons fire in such a way
Painting portraits in my mind that no one else can see

These are all sounds of sleep coming back to catch me
These are my memories taking hold of everything
Watching and waiting
In anticipation for my chance to sink or swim
I will stop at nothing to realize my dreams
Resonating in front of me
Discover aspects of life that bring to light all you can achieve

These are the inspirations
Shining light on what life could be
Guided by the suns of insight
Burning for eternity

Eternity
