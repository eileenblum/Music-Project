We came here striving for meaning
I swore that I could bring that back to you
Now weâre striving for anything
For anything

We came here searching for purpose
Something in which our hearts could confide
We found it inside ourselves, the reason why

This is our greatest love, a fire burning within
Between our dreams and our nightmares lies our passion

We have a mission far greater than ourselves
Yearning to bring new life to our home
Reciprocating everything we have learned
Envisioning our destiny

As ancient architects moved the heavens and the earth
As mother loves a child, weâve given birth
Oh and the faces writhe like deadly plagues have been called
Deadly plagues have been called

This is happening
A consequence, a side we didnât see

With everything we have learned, we wonât lose our way

Oh, this is no dream; itâs made of pure reality
And now I know this is where Iâm meant to be
