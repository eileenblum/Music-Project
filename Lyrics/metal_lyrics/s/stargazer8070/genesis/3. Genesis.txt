Breathe

I have witnessed what you have become
And yet you still doubt yourself

Your disposition
Is your greatest quality
You've achieved the state of mind
Into the realm that was thought to be divine

Open your eyes you have arrived at your genesis
Open your eyes you have arrived at your genesis

The flame's burning brighter than you ever knew
Your creation has awakened
Your creation has awakened
A flowing spring of aspirations
The planets have aligned
Take me home

In this amalgamation of all our lives
Not yet our destination

You take to the skies
For in this new world
You are something more

Open your eyes
You have arrived
At your genesis

This is what you came for
Growing, being, we shall call this
