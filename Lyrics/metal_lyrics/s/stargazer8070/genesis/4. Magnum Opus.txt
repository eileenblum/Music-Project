Our thoughts, they reciprocate convictions
Like a convict awaiting incarceration

Standing before the eyes of judgment
As the gavel falls

What is this world?
He can taste the glory

Imprisoned in his own head, striving for an opportunity
Trapped in a case of fears, mechanized by affliction
Make your peace and break free

Trapped in a case of fears, swallowed by speculation
Make your peace and break free

All comes full circle
You shall receive exactly what you need
You fulfill the prophecy

Pour out your heart, your soul
Into this piece of us

We will make a sacrifice
That out lasts flesh and blood

The only truth lies in the strides,
In the strides you take
(Take from me my everything)
And the moves you make
(Before I learn anything)

Legends never die
