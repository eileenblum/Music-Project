By the stars, I'll find a way
These constellations, are maps to guide me
Anywhere in my mind

We look to the heavens but gravitate towards this celestial body
A man can only dream, he maintains his ideals
But my eyes cannot perceive these possibilities
Manifesting right in front of me

And this is only the beginning
This is the new order of the ages

I swear I'll be the one, who escapes from relativity
My designs will become tangible
And through my curiosity unveil
My discovery
My discovery

As I slip through wormholes
A vernacular plane of existence
I now control space and time

By the stars, I'll find a way
These constellations are maps to guide me
Anywhere in my mind

Pushing back boundaries set by the gods
Wandering further and further from safety
Just yesterday we wouldn't dare stray from home
And now we're waving back lightyears away

Pushing back boundaries set by the gods
Wandering further and further from safety
Just yesterday we wouldn't dare stray from home
And now we're waving back lightyears away

Away

Now were waving back lightyears away

Away
