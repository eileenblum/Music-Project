[Tobit]
It brought me a sunset
It brought me all beauty and pain
Unbreakable times of glory
Nights of despair in the rain
It brought me so close to my skies
With clouds where I could fly
A love so pure and filled with dreams
Besides a giant sad
tree, why?

[HighLord]
You will live the paradise as you wish
And there it will remain

[Spirit of Nature]
You fear of your life
You fear all of us
And you don't want to live again

[HighLord]
You see storms facing the sunlight
As a brother daring each other

[Tobit]
It brought me the light blinding my eyes
Forever I am lost inside

[Tobit]
The sun and the moon
The stars and the seas
Through the years the same
Beautiful brightness to me
Trees covered by snow
Rivers going down to the seas
They're just pieces
Of our eternal journey
