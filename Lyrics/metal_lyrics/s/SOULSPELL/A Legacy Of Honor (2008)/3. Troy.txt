[Tobit]
Listen to me sons of Troy
ItÂ´s time to be great
To make our names remain

Empires are forged by war
By the Honor of gods
By and army of one million men

[Achilles]
A thousand ships of war
Sailing away leave behind
His wives, his pride

[Hermes]
Here thereÂ´s no young man dying
The war is not behind
The Unbreakable walls of Troy

[Samael]
Pride, just fight your own hopeless pride
Drowned in your own sea of wine

[Achilles]
I will not kill you
Far from the eyes of the crowd
YouÂ´ll roam without your eyes forever

[Hermes]
Here thereÂ´s no young man dying
The war is not behind
The Unbreakable walls of Troy

[Judith]
Threatened by my land
I want to leave with you
LetÂ´s drink to peace while we can
'Cause this blessed morning will curse us
We were not fair

[Samael]
Pride, just fight your own hopeless pride
Drowned in your own sea of wine

[Judith]
A gift without a name to know
An Arrow destroying a god, a legend
ThereÂ´s no victory in a battle
Where a Hero closes his eyes
So as you and me

[Samael, Achilles]
Pride, just fight your own hopeless pride
Drowned in your own sea of wine

[Achilles]
Pride...
