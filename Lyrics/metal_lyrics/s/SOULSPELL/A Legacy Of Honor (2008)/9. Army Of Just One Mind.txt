[Samael]
Once you followed your own star
But there's just a red moon remaining in your sky
Under the white you wrote it all in black

Planting the roses
Digging the cove of your own funeral
Smiling they shot you

[Hermes]
Their light will shine on
And their defeat
The enemies will never know

[Tobit]
My faith can't move the Mountain
But you can't use it to hold my fear
Don't your dare to wake up my wildest side
Now face my army of just one mind

[Samael]
You taught it how to trust in you
Now it welcomes the death
Brought by your daddy's heart
Dream is all reality gave to me

[Hermes]
There's still hope remaining even in a war
And victory is just a trick to choose
Those who will kneel and lose

[Tobit]
My faith can't move the Mountain
But you can't use it to hold my fear
Don't your dare to wake up my wildest side
Now face my army of just one mind
