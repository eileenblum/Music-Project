[Arlim]
Twisted Mind

[Tobit]
Redeemer, take me away
You know my fears, my forsaken destiny
Free-will, fire calls
I pledge you my mind
The oath of infidels

[Hobb]
What they hide in their words
A traced horizon that wonÂ´t be fair
Stand up and face all the evil
Make the stones on your way be your guide

[Tobit]
On and on IÂ´m Searching for the unknown
The unnamed old times of my mind
That I lived ages ago
Like a crown outside a kingdom
Democracy without freedom
My life is a secret to me

Great walls, thereÂ´s no way out
My own blood betrayed me
At Arges River I was lost, I died
ThatÂ´s why I canÂ´t see myself on this mirror

[Hobb]
Think twice
DonÂ´t treat the suicide like your buried pain
From inside
You feel blamed souls wonÂ´t reign

[Tobit]
On and on IÂ´m searching for the unknown...
