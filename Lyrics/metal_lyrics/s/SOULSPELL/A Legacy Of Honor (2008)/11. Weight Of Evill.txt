[Tobit]
Wings take me anywhere
FoolÂ´s the one who dares to face me
But what is the meaning of these screams?
Nailed to the core of time

[High Lord]
Try to search in your deepest dreams
First try to understand what you mean

[Tobit]
I will have to leave behind
Many things that I enjoy
Why can't life and death be as sweet as before?

[Samael]
Where do you think you were born?
And what kind of hope you keep?
Soon you'll come back

[High Lord]
Try to search in your deepest dreams
First try to understand what you mean

[Judith]
Don't let the weight of devil be
A stone over your dreams

[Tobit]
I will have to leave behind
Many things that I enjoy
Why can't life and death be as sweet as before?
