[Tobit]
Warnings rumble in my head
But few moments ago we prayed
Uncertain world far away, they say
At the end of their lies there's a life
I cannot choose the right door
You cannot change my choice
Even if you could, your wouldn't know
How to get your hands over my fate

[Judith]
A little too far you came to play a game
But here fake rules will drown the truth
Never dare the dark tides of the sea alone

[Hobb]
Roaming in my domains
I feel your scent of rats
No one else but you, they say
Could find the wasteland

[Judith]
A little too far you came to play a game
But here fake rules will drown the truth
Never dare the dark tides of the sea alone

[Tobit]
Even if you could, you wouldn't know
How to get your hands over my fate

[Judith]
A little too far you came to play a game
But here fake rules will drown the truth
Never dare the dark tides of the sea alone
A little too far you came to stay
Brought your faith and lost your sense
Through the way
Now give me some reason to play
Your game
