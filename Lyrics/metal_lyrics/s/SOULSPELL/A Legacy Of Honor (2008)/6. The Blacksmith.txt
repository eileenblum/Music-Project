[Tobit]
A deal defining the rules of a kingdom
Feel the words and so many souls
Flying away

[Hermes]
You are a king so you have
The power to move a man
Now lead your mind to control your heart
ThereÂ´s no excuse

His Kingdom was clear in this courage
Not trapped on a Cross
Defending those who deserve a place
In the Kingdom of all men

[Samael]
Burning my hope IÂ´ll live again

[Hermes]
Oh Lord! Who has claim? WhoÂ´s the only one?
DonÂ´t say your prayers in vain.Be Jerusalem!

[Tobit]
If you canÂ´t understand my own traditions
This time just a brave heart wonÂ´t be enough to you.

[Hermes]
His Kingdom was clear in this courage
Not trapped on a Cross
Defending those who deserve a place
In the Kingdom

Oh Lord! Who has claim? WhoÂ´s the only one?
DonÂ´t say your prayers in vain. Be Jerusalem!

[Tobit]
Our faith is forged by our courage
The holy one is the one
