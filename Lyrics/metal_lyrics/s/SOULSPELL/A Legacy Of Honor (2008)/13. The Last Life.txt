[Tobit]
A wine forgotten for ages
Degraded by time
A storm of the prayers
Takes me home
Throught this labyrinth of lies
That holds me inside
A guilty without a crime

Flying ove strange clouds I go on
Lost images I see
Why do they all point at me?

Somehow we know
ThereÂ´s only one open doo
Inviting us but retrieving its price
We believe and fight
But some truth remains untold
Maybe weÂ´re just living
The first of our last lives

[Samael]
More than a judgement on heaven
A divine mistake
The one and the last
How can he blame you this way?
Betrayed principles of God
Throw it in the abyss of your dreams

[Solo: Pontes/Cardillo]

[Samael]
Finally you came to our home
Few instants have Brought you here
You believed them so many times before
Divine justice, can you trust this?

[Judith]
And all wishes gone
You never opened yourself this way
Surrounded by demons
Became an angel and weÂ´ll meet again

[Haamiah]
Welcome my friend to the city of gods
Drink the water from those
Who are glorious
Look back at the times
When you were notorious
And come to understand
The dreams you couldnÂ´t reach

[Solo: Amendola]

[Samael]
You faked to be mine
You flew away
IÂ´m not as fool as you wished

You dreamed to be free
We made a deal
United weÂ´ll stand

You canÂ´t kill me
The supreme power
His time will soon arise

WhatÂ´s Happening in there?
The bells that I fear
I curse you and I shall return soon

[Tobit]
Peace for all
Harmony will reign now
Years and years of suffering
I throw away from me

Somehow we know
ThereÂ´s only one open door
Inviting us but retrieving its price
We believe and fight
But some truth remains untold
Maybe weÂ´re just living
The first of our last lives
