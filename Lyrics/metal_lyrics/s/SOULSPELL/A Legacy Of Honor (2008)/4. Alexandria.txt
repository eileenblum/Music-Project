[Haamiah]
Born three hunderd years
Before Christ in Macedonia
Another myth that spred his name
Throught the unknown east

Warriors marching restlessly
Our dreams were fed by our glories
Foresseing a new, a vast world
A nation opened to all

[Arlim]
Alexander the Great reached all
The lands he could touch with his own hands
Dreamed about a world of free men
The freest man ever lived

[Haamiah]
Persians striking at the crack of dawn
Two hundred fifty thousand men
But even with less than a quarter of them
WeÂ´ll enter into Babylon

Pharaoh in Egypt
Our dreams will feed our glories
Dreaming the menÂ´s biggest dream
A nation opened to all

[Arlim]
Alexander the Great reached all
The lands he could touch with his own hands
Dreamed about a world of free men
The freest man ever lived

[Judith]
Loved by all
Royal blood
Beware of those
Who Think too much

[Haamiah]
Alexander the Great reached all
The lands he could touch with his own hands
Dreamed about a world of free men
HeÂ´s built a whole nation...

[Arlim]
...to all
