[Tobit]
Magic to change the world
We are so proud of our contributions
That we forget to say......
The magic words
Finally I found what you mean
When you pointed me that signs
I'm real and there's nothing to fear

[HighLord]
Your enchantment
Is not your beauty
Neighter your possessions
Just give a piece of you

[Tobit]
Past lives tormenting me
With sag wings
I've crossed all these seas
Waiting for this day

[Judith]
I've been waiting for you
Since I lost you that day
I'm waiting you
And forever I will stay
I'm waiting you
On and on and on...

[Tobit]
Visions os many ages ago
That opened my mind once more
To undestand the signs
Our soul is our spell

[Tobit]
Unbound of all that doubts
I can stand here at night
To count the stars again
Those same stars

[HighLord]
Your enchantment
Is not your beauty
Neighter your possessions
Just give a piece of you

[Judith]
I'm waiting you
On and on and on...

[Tobit]
Visions os many ages ago
That opened my mind once more
To undestand the signs
Our soul is our spell
