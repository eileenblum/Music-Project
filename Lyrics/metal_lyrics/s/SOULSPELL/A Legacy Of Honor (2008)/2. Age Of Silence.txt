[Tobit]
Point me the way, give me a Straight line
Right to the times IÂ´ve lost
Give me one reason to fight for your treasure
Living behind your lies

[Arlim]
Let yourself go

[Hermes]
Come back and think, your time wonÂ´t be over
While thereÂ´s still answers to search

[Arlim]
Let yourself go

[Hermes]
Oh this choir of angels would be
More than just figures standing on your wall

[Tobit]
We live in silence and hope
All the reflection are blurred
And your crimes sound like poetry
Memories hard to keep inside me

[Samael]
Gone with the tide, your minutes, your life
A desperate faith you fake
Be my guest, donÂ´t run away
ThereÂ´re so many things to learn

[Arlim]
Let Yourself go

[Hermes]
Cold doubts warming you
The sands you walk on will echo soon

[Tobit]
We live in silence and hope

[Amon]
Poor surprises blow this battle
Warriors inspired by your fall
Leave them behind, become a legend of fire
Face your fears, face them with pride
The pain is your gold
Carved names at stones
The pain is your face
The great Rasmses age

[Hermes]
Hold on to your sword, lead them again
To make the sands you walk on rumble strong

[Tobit]
We live in silence and hope
All the reflections are blurred
And your crimes sound like poetry
The mesmerizes me
We live in silence and hope
All the reflections are blurred
And your crimes sound like poetry
Memories hard to keep inside me

[Samael]
DonÂ´t let it flow
