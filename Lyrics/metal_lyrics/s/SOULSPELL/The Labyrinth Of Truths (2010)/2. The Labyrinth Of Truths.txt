[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
Time can fill the void that keeps me away
From healing my mind of going insane

[Centaur - Raphael Dantas]
Don't look for something you don't want to face
You would call an answer what we call a chance

[Choir]
Into the labyrinth of truths

[Haamiah - MaurÃ­cio Del Bianco]
Into the labyrinth of truths

[Olaff - GermÃ¡n Pascual]
No good will
Nor good faith

[Samael - Nando Fernandes]
No wisdom can break the spell

[Olaff - GermÃ¡n Pascual]
No wisdom can break the spell

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
Heroes may pass but Lord I don't care
They live here inside our heads
Feelings may change, there's no one to blame
But we'll be forever the same

[Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
First time I saw him I could not avoid
Worrying about the outcome of Tobit's final choice

[Tobit - Leandro CaÃ§oilo]
There's no guilt in a war, like no victory with no test

[Tobit - Leandro CaÃ§oilo + Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
Together we'll get through this never-ending quest

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
Answers from a new world, my spirit won't last

[Hollow - Carlos Zema]
Come, you must come, you are now my guest!

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
Heroes may passâ¦

[Padyal - Jefferson Albert]
Oaahhh..

[Amaranth - Gui Antonioli]
You must be tough
The beast will bluff

[Samael - Nando Fernandes]
You three must learn
Ohhâ¦Your mouths I will shut

[Hollow - Carlos Zema]
I smell you, You are weak
You are an easy prey to beat

[Amaranth - Gui Antonioli]
Why do you care?
Inside Hollow's lair

[Samael - Nando Fernandes]
Hollow!

[Hollow - Carlos Zema]
I've got souls to feed
Your end is about to come
So prepare to die
That's what you'll learn

[The Ripper - Alex Voorhees]
There are labyrinth's cells
You won't live to cell
Dungeons of hell
Where lost souls dwell
They will hunt you until the end of time
You're dead, my friend
Dark lord of fear
You must soon return
Forgive you humble servant's curse

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
Dark creatures' souls from a lost sea
Paintings unknown, but already seen
If that is what you want, that's what I'll dare
I will face your nightmare

[Hollow - Carlos Zema]
Your nightmare!

[Haamiah - MaurÃ­cio Del Bianco]
A gray disloyal paradise
What a sweet way to die!

[Arlim - Tito Falaschi]
You were lost, you were bound
Now you're free, now you're found

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
Heroes may pass but Lord I don't care
They live here inside our heads
Feelings may change, there's no one to blame
But we shall be always the same
Heroes may passâ¦
You can never deny who you are
You can never deny who you were
You can never deny who we'll be
