[Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
Something is different
But I didn't know
I haven't felt this way
Since a long time ago

[Toryn - Lucas Martins]
My heart stood still
And I wasn't prepared
I should case this thrill
Feelings can be unfair

[Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
Eternally adrift
Life plays tricks on us
Weak and always lost
But the way your river flows
You'll never know

[Toryn - Lucas Martins]
I was sure at our one and only glance
Our souls are so close
But my hope makes no sense

[Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
Irony has given me a cruel fate to bear
Somehow deep inside I know
In the end you will be there

[Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
Eternally adrift

[Toryn - Lucas Martins]
We're adrift

[Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
Life plays tricks on us

[Judith - Daisa Munhoz and Toryn - Lucas Martins]
Weak and always lost
But the way your river flows

[Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
You'll never know

[Judith - Daisa and Toryn - Lucas Martins]
Eternally adrift...

[Toryn - Lucas Martins]
You'll never know
