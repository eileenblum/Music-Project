[Tobit - Leandro CaÃ§oilo]
Time may wash whole ages away
But some fates will remain

[Choir]
Time may wash whole ages away
But some fates will remain

[Amaranth - Gui Antonioli]
You'll not decide or agree
Imposed on you it will be
In a dream inside a dream you'll stare
At the fountain of your own despair

[Arlim - Tito Falaschi]
How long will your realm of lies last?
Follow me and repent the sins from your past
Maybe this time you won't regret
Living among lies is hard to stand

[Amon - Iuri Sanson]
Trade you sword
No matter how divine
It won't be worth a dime
No!

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
Why are the stars so hard to comprehend?

[Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
Until the end

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
They seem like inspiration for us to live again

[Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
For some reason I let ot flow within my dreams
Eternally
And life seems to whiter in me

[Amaranth - Gui Antonioli]
Here a moment is like an age for you
There would be no hope and nothing you could do
There are reasons I could point you
Gargoyles, servants, slaves, all of them too

[Arlim - Tito Falaschi]
Maybe this time you won't regret
Living among lies is hard to stand

[Amon - Iuri Sanson]
Redeemer is lost
Fairness never thought
Here you will crawl

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
Why are the stars so hard to comprehend?

[Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
Until the end

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
They seem like inspiration for us to live again

[Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
For some reason I let ot flow within my dreams
Eternally
And life seems to whiter in me

[Haamiah - MaurÃ­cio Del Bianco]
Touched by pain you are
A deep battle of time

[Choir]
On and on, on and on, on and on hell's guardian

[Haamiah - MaurÃ­cio Del Bianco]
You never thought how far
You imagination could fly

[Solo - Roland Grapow]

[Tobit - Leandro CaÃ§oilo]
Perhaps you were born to walk alone
Your life is quite different from the lives of everyone
We both know, some memories can be strong
You're in my dreams
To you I belong

[Solo - Roland Grapow]

[Amon - Iuri Sanson]
Give away your sword
No matter how divine
It won't be worth a dime
Oh no!

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
Why are the stars so hard to comprehend?...

[Samael - Nando Fernandes]
Why are the stars so hard to comprehend?
To live again

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
I cry out loud: "The king rests on the stars"
