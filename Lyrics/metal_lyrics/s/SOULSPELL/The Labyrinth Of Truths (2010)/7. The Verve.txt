[Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
There are worse enemies
Than all you face while you live
Life goes by faster than you wish
But that, my son, is needless to say

[Frederic - Rafael Gubert]
I'll care 'bout you endlessly
Just like we used to play innocently
But it's needless to say

[Frederic - Rafael Gubert]
Verve has left me

[Hollow - Carlos Zema]
Your fear feeds my soul

[Frederic - Rafael Gubert]
May I live again?

[Hollow - Carlos Zema]
Pointless to strggle

[Frederic - Rafael Gubert]
verve has left me

[Hollow - Carlos Zema]
Your existence will never last

[Frederic - Rafael Gubert]
May I live again?

[Hollow - Carlos Zema]
Timo you'll be next

[Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
I'd give my heart to ease your pain
Retentless is your dedtiny
It's happening again

[Hollow - Carlos Zema]
It's happening again
Judith, you'd better pray

[Frederic - Rafael Gubert]
Verve has left me ...

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
To the land of light
Left no pain behind
Blessed us with your smile
Judgment is divine
I can't help but trusting you in His hands

[Frederic - Rafael Gubert]
Humanity is the absence of all colors
A tiny little grain in puzzle of flesh
No human being was ever conscious
Not at all
Finding joy in their blindness

[Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
Finding joy in their blindness

[Frederic - Rafael Gubert]
They'll remain untold
Timo, our paths will soon cross again
All I ask you now is to be brave
Farewell, my friend
I leave in peace

[Frederic - Rafael Gubert]
Verve has left me ...

[Hollow - Carlos Zema]
Oh, Timo you'll be next
You will never last
You will be the next
Come on!
