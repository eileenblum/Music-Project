[Haamiah - MaurÃ­cio Del Bianco]
I'm so lost
Inside this cage of mine
I'm bound to time ...

[The Conscience - Zak Stevens]
Now you're lost and I'm here
I won't hide
Sometimes you neglect me
But I say I'm still on your side
Even if you no longer believe it

[The Insanity - Jon Oliva]
Don't fear my pale exile
You will not regret
What you deserve, you get
There's just no grant
In the labyrinth of life
Just step inside and realize
Conscience, my friend, is nothing
But a bare weaker's prize

[Haamiah - MaurÃ­cio Del Bianco]
The black hole has
Shuffed your cards
In profound infinity
Look up and face your life
It's harsh just the same for me

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
Will he try and chase his light?
Will he choose the right door?
Could he crumble or fly?
Withstand of fall?

[The Conscience - Zak Stevens]
You will not succeed, it's useless to try

[The Insanity - Jon Oliva]
For you a whole new world
Awaits here inside

[Haamiah - MaurÃ­cio Del Bianco]
Where can I hide?

[The Conscience - Zak Stevens]
The angels have taken you far too high

[Haamiah - MaurÃ­cio Del Bianco]
Oh, where's my mind?

[The Insanity - Jon Oliva]
For so long I've been waiting
But now here comes the time!

"Listen to me from deep down inside
I'm the madness
That just will not die
With no regrets of what I do to you
Before the night is over
You'll be crawling to me"

Don't chase your light
Just open up these doors
And leave yourself aside
Into the madness hall

[The Conscience - Zak Stevens]
Now chase your light
Just open this door
And make yourself fly
In the inner sense hall

[The Insanity - Jon Oliva]
There is no way
To escape my control
I'll take care of your soul
My power will never end
Very soon you'll understand

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
He'll leave his greatest
Wishes behind
Wip out his thoughts
And feelings inside

[Haamiah - MaurÃ­cio Del Bianco]
It's time to me to comprehend
All that I've seen was just the trend
And I have learned that in the end
My endless life will not expand

Throught the eyes of the beholder
I see my friends are growing older
I fell the world upon my shoulders
Such as my heart just growing colder
