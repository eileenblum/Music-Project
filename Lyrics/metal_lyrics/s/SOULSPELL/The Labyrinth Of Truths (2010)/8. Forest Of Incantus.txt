[Voices of Incantus - Dan Rubin]
Who dares to enter my calm domains?
I hear my little friends' complaints
Turn back while there's still some life in you
Or I will force you myself
Feel nature's revenge against men

[Voices of Incantus - Dan Rubin + Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
A greet to beauty, a greet to the beast
It's nice to welcome you here at my feast
Over the deserts will flourish my leaves
In deep deception you must live

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore]
Endless seconds, a brief eternity
I will not surrender to your trees

[Toryn - Lucas Martins]
A river that flows down-up
Straight to your mind
An old talking tree
Your thoughts are not blind
The closer you are to the truth of Amon
The further you get yourself from home

Why fo you think we might understand?
Human life worth less than ants
What is essential in life, anyway?
Whole mankind will just fade away

[Voices of Incantus - Dan Rubin + Judith - Daisa Munhoz]
A greet to beauty, a greet to the beast
It's nice to welcome you here at my feast
Over the deserts will flourish my leaves
In deep deception you must live

[Timo - MÃ¡rio Pastore + Arlim - Tito Falaschi]
I'm falling downâ¦
