[Arlim - Tito Falaschi]
The words have been spoken
The hymn of fire
The alliance can't be broken
Try to decipher the signs
Look out!

[Padyal - Jefferson Albert]
Loyalty is the price
We offer eternal life
In a superior race

[The Hope - Edu Falaschi]
You will find
Deep down inside you mind
I am someone who cares

[Diary - Manuela Saggioro]
You must not read me
With the eyes God gave you
Dark knowledge may bring light or chaos
From its dead roots

[Padyal - Jefferson Albert]
Circumscribe your desires
Virtue rules your mind
Mysteries you will defy
Abnegation
Supreme sensation
Secrets will arise

[The Hope - Edu Falaschi]
You will findâ¦

[Diary - Manuela Saggioro]
You must not read meâ¦

[Olaff - GermÃ¡n Pascual]
No truth can be shaped
By the foolishness of men

You don't have to live
How they tell you to

All your foolish pride
Just makes you a fool

[Diary - Manuela Saggioro]
You must read between the lines
Magic will within me lies

[Ollaf - GermÃ¡n Pascual]
You must search
The oldest tree on earth

[Diary - Manuela Saggioro]
I will not lie
All their chances will die
Even in disguise
They will find
There's no mercy to claim
You will be betrayed
Into the darknest place
You'll never be the same

[The Hope - Edu Falaschi]
You don't have to live
Just how they tell'em to

[Dairy - Manuela Saggioro]
It's shining in your eyes

[The Hope - Edu Falaschi]
All your pride
Just makes you a fool

[Dairy - Manuela Saggioro]
Temptations will show you the truth

[The Hope - Edu Falaschi]
Timo you don't have to go

[Dairy - Manuela Saggioro]
So strange and so below

[The Hope - Edu Falaschi]
You just can't wait

[The Hope - Edu Falaschi + Dairy - Manuela]
As evil flows

[The Hope - Edu Falaschi]
Find a way back
I'll be with you

[Arlim - Tito Falaschi]
No!
