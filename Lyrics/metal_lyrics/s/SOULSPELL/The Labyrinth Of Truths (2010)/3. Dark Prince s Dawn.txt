[Solo - Demian]

[Timo - Pastore]
I never felt this way before
In a cold and dark moon
A sunflower's been torn

[Samael - Nando]
Angels of fright
You can't stand up right
In front of my reality
Can you feel me?

[Tobit - CaÃ§oilo]
Knight of a hell chess
A strange uninvited
Fierceful and merciless
He's the king of all lies
Samael's defeat may not
Be enough to allow
The dark prince's dawn

[Centaur - Dantas]
You're disguise, you gave up the fight
You're the prince of shame
Against the army of day and light
We were betrayed
Listen to the pounding
Our future is calling
Don't let a liar decide
Your tomb's glory and height

[Tobit - CaÃ§oilo]
Demons and angels will fight
Kings or barbarians they will all die

[Timo - Pastore]
How could I truly believe?
Opinionless in silence I've been

[Tobit - CaÃ§oilo]
Knight of a hell chess
A stranger uninvited ...

[Amaranth - Gui]
Lay down your guard
If you have an empty heart
You will

[Solo - Demian]

[Amaranth - Gui]
Praise the new dark Lord
Pay the N.P. toll
Let demons' symphonies begin
United are our sins

[Centaur - Dantas]
There's no dream you won't get
And you won't regret
Play it loud like hell

[Haamiah - Del Bianco]
There's no meaning of life
Neither right nor wrong
There's no meaning of life
Just give it the value you want

[Timo - Pastore]
Inside your cries you will find home
In your hard times there will be hope
And there will be hope

[Haamiah - Del Bianco]
And there will be hope

[Amaranth - Gui]
Praise the new dark Lord ...

[Tobit - CaÃ§oilo]
Knight of a hell chess
A stranger uninvited
Fierce and forgiveless
He's might!

[Tobit - CaÃ§oilo]
Knight of a hell chess
A stranger uninvited ...

[Solo - Demian]

[Samael - Nando]
You're nothing but pawns
And your king to me bows
Trust me, I will never allow
