[GUITAR - PAGOTTO]

[SAMAEL â¢ FERNANDES]
Although you are right
We'll remain untold
Indiscernible
The phantom has come
From an obscure birth
A fragile echo of fire
A son of a man shall arise
An institution of lies
Hidden in a shelter of cries
No enemy will ever find
Centuries of men will try in vain
To discover again
What has not been told yet
In this land
