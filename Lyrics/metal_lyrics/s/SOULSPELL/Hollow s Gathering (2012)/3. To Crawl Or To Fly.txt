[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
Our ideals aren't the same
After a while
I don't even know my name
I'm not free to got
Neither free to stay
I'm not welcome here
And lm running late

[LIVY â¢ SMITH]
All you've got is taking you there
Where they want
But they realty don't care
Maybe emptiness is not fear
It might well be
A weapon over here

[WAYNA â¢ SOMERVILLE]
What is the right way to go?
Oh god, i must try
Decisions i've taken before
But time showed me
I wasn't right
To crawl or to fly

[THE TALKING DIARY â¢ SAGGIORO]
Are the falcon's kind words
More deadly
Than the serpent's sincere bite?
Is the beauty of gold
Enough to make us all go blind?

[SOLO â¢ MAGIONI, FELDMAN]

[WAYNA â¢ SOMERVILLE]
What is the right way to go?
Oh god, i must try
Derisions i've taken before
But time showed me
I wasn't right

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
To crawl or to fly

[LIVY â¢ SMITH / WAYNA â¢ SOMERVILLE]
What is the right way to go?
Oh god, i must try

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
Oh god i must try

[LIVY â¢ SMITH / WAYNA â¢ SOMERVILLE]
Decisions i've taken before
But time showed me
I wasn't right

[WAYNA â¢ SOMERVILLE]
To crawl or to fly
