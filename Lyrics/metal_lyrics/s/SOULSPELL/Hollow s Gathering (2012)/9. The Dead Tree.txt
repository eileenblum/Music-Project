[ARLIM â¢ T. FALASCHI]
I sensed you coming my way
Time is running out
Just trust my wisdom and what i say

[THE HOLY DEAD TREE â¢ RIPPER]
Depth is the key
Lower you go less you will be
Infinity
Your faith clouds what you believe

[Solo - Lambert]

[THE HOLY DEAD TREE â¢ RIPPER]
You must evolve to reach your past
Looking forward you're going back
Your future lies in azkaban
But you don't need a magic wand
Just let my words touch your sins
Your best friend is your enemy
Where despair takes your sight and hearing
Sun reflects the truth
That is beneath you

[THE HOLY DEAD TREE â¢ RIPPER]
You'll have the choice
Free will locks it all up
You must leave now
All kindness is rotten

[TIMO'S MYSTICAL BODY â¢ CAMPOS]
You must evolve to reach your past
Looking forward you're going back
Your future lies in azkaban
But you don't need a magic wand
Just let my words touch your sins
Your best friend is your enemy
Where despair takes your sight and hearing
Sun reflects the truth
That is beneath you

[Solo - Amendola]

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
Now you have
The enchanted words
The holy dead tree is gone
You're once again on your own
When you enter the gates
You won't be the same
Very close to your heart
Dark feelings to tame
Hollow awaits

[TIMO'S MYSTICAL BODY â¢ CAMPOS]
You leave me in shadows but
My weakness is my strength
Birds ate the only crumbs
Of hope from my way

[TIMO'S MYSTICAL BODY â¢ CAMPOS]
You must evolve to reach your past
Looking forward you're going back
Your future lies in azkaban
But you don't need a magic wand
Just let my words touch your sins
Your best friend is your enemy
Where despair takes your sight and hearing
Sun reflects the truth
That is beneath you
