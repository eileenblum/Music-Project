[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
Am i dreaming or am i alive?
The devil was my last sight
At the end of this line
I see something i can't understand
And i feel there's no time to waste
I must prevent my son's disgrace

[CHARON â¢ VESCERA]
How dare you look me in the eye?
You are no more than ashes, void of life
But i own you appreciation
This is your lucky day
Just make a wish

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
Let me guide him forever
Is a sole drop enough to change the tide?

[Solo - Lambert]

[CHARON â¢ VESCERA]
You are standing right between the poles
Both attract you, now you go for one
Either way you lose, you know
How could you wish
Something for him, not for you?

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
Let me guide him forever
Is a sole drop enough to change our lives?

[CHARON â¢ VESCERA]
There was only a right choice
And you did well
Time has come
Don't waste a drop and chang the tide

[Solo - Lambert]
