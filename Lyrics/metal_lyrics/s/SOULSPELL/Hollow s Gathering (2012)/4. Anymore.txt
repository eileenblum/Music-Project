[THE TALKING DIARY â¢ SAGGIORO]
I don't wanna hear anymore
You must learn to face your core
I don't wanna fight, no more
From now on you are alone

[THE TALKING DIARY â¢ SAGGIORO / JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
Ahh...

[THE TALKING DIARY â¢ SAGGIORO]
Everything i know is locked
Those whispers in your ears are lost
Please don't tear me out
I beg you
She said we were bound
I believed it was true
But forever she's gone
If you lose your purpose of life
If no flame bums inside
Nothing can satisfy your thirst
And your prayers
Will never be heard

[THE TALKING DIARY â¢ SAGGIORO / JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
Ahh...

[Solo - Lambert]

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
I look at the door
And see a light never seen before
My soul mate is not the same anymore
I feel him but he is not here
Who are you my dear?
Is there nothing to fear?
