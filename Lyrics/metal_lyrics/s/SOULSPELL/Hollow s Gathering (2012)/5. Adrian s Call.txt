We're born
As we chose to live
We find out who we will be
Why should i believe in
These nonsense words of humanity?

Life is not a choice
It's fate, suits you well
All must come to witness
The final duel

[TIMO â¢ PASTORE]
We're bom
As we chose to live
We find out who we'll be
Why should i believe
These nonsense words of humanity?

Oh yeah
Humanity
