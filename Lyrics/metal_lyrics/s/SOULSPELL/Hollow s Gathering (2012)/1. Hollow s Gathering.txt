[SYBIL â¢ ISHITANI]
Hear my call, wise human beings
You have no clue at all
Trust can bring no glory for your dreams
You can't avoid your fall

[Solo - Erba, Laguna]

[Choir]
We came from far at hollow's command
The age of men has come to an end

[HOLLOW â¢ ZEMA]
Someone has disturbed my reign
No matter what's your race
You will certainly regret
Demons, angels or men

[THE APPRENTICE â¢ EMEKA]
All armies are marching on
Don't think it won't rumble your ground
You don't need a flag to stand for

[Choir]
Every drop flows to the sea

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
Flows to the see

[Choir]
Like those inside hollow's gathering

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
No one will reach paradise

[TOBIT â¢ CACOILO]
By stomping on daisies of life

[Choir]
Of hollow's garden

[PADYAL â¢ ALBERT]
All members were hand picked
To our wicked fraternity
No principle can buy you in
And leaving is not an alternative

[THE APPRENTICE â¢ EMEKA]
All armies are marching on
Don't think it won't rumble your ground
You don't need a flag to stand for

[Choir]
Every drop flows to the sea

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
Flows to the see

[Choir]
Like those inside hollow's gathering

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
No one will reach paradise

[TOBIT â¢ CACOILO]
By stomping on daisies of life

[Choir]
Of hollow's garden

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
Time is just a prison for the human beings
The good ones have evil inside like you and i

[SYBIL â¢ ISHITANI]
An unpredictable sin - a fragile agony
An ancient infinity
Mankind will never be free
You've always searched for the core of the unknown
It's not easy to learn
What's the right way to turn back

[TIMO â¢ PASTORE]
Time as i know it
Doesn't hurt
Wipes out my memories
My body is gone
I lie down and died

[Solo - erba]

[AMON â¢ SANSON]
History erased forever
All is gone
Life has no way out
From my fountain
Timeless destiny will rise
From the unknown
No spell could bring back
The reign of amon

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
The reign of amon is gone

[HOLLOW â¢ ZEMA]
There's nothing to ask
Whole world is lost

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
But my world is not yours

[Hell's choir]
We came from far
At hollow's command
The age of men
Has come to an end

[AMON â¢ SANSON]
Weâll all pay for our crimes

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
Time has come

[AMON â¢ SANSON]
'cause you released hollow's time

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
We won't survive

[PADYAL â¢ ALBERT]
Mankind will lose all pride

[TIMO â¢ PASTORE]
Things will change
I'm not the same

[Choir]
Demons arise!
