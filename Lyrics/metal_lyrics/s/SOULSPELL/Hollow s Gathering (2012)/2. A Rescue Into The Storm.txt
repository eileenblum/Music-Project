[TORYN â¢ MARTINS]
Something seems wrong tonight
Above the rumbling skies cry
The magic moon has hidden her light

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
I wish we could rest and see once again
Those green meadows in a quiet night

[SAMAEL â¢ FERNANDES / DEMON'S CHOIR]
Soon weâll be together
There's no need to worry
Faces of a new world
Will welcome judy at home

[JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
I always knew how i would end
Now it's true
Death took my hand

[SAMAEL â¢ FERNANDES / DEMON'S CHOIR]
Soon we'll be together
There's no need to worry
Faces of a new world
Will welcome judy at home
She will never be free
She lies
Lies dead here

[PADYAL â¢ ALBERT]
We come to rescue you from the storm
You enter the new world the way you're bom
Get rid of the chalice's lies
Let us be your guide
A thunder of silence
Within the black box
We're above all science
No one will ever cross

[Solo - pagotto]

[SAMAEL â¢ FERNANDES / JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
Soon we'll be together
There's no need to worry
Faces of a new world
Will welcome judy at home

[SAMAEL â¢ FERNANDES / JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ TOBIT â¢ CACOILO / ARLIM â¢ T. FALASCHI]
Soon we'll be together
There's no need to worry
Faces of a new world
Will welcomejudi at home
She will never
She lies
Lies dead here

[SAMAEL â¢ FERNANDES]
A rescue into the storm
