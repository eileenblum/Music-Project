[BANNETH â¢ BAYLEY]
Brave stranger
I will not let you pass
You don't have the courage
To overcome this
Just prepare to die

The slightest
I will turn you down
Like a thousand knights
Who are silenced now
I remember them
Cursed and blessed
No one fought to the end

[TIMO'S MYSTICAL BODY â¢ CAMPOS]
How can i leave my beloved ones
In these gray days we won't forget
Solitude will reign anyway
I will end my quest

[ARLIM â¢ T. FALASCHI]
He can't reach the tree
All the knowledge
Must remain here
Your game is bound to fail
His will must not prevail
Above it all

[BANNETH â¢ BAYLEY]
Does he know the secret of the wood?
His heart beats louder than it should
Is this illusion or for real?
Do i surrender to his appeal?

[TIMO'S MYSTICAL BODY â¢ CAMPOS]
Fear now bums my chest
Iâm so close but i wonât last
I could not even say farewell
My life ends fast

[BANNETH â¢ BAYLEY / JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
The keeper's game
I will listen to your claim
The legacy is true
Left all to you

[BANNETH â¢ BAYLEY]
It's true

[ARLIM â¢ T. FALASCHI]
No!

[Solo - Magioni. T. Falaschi]

[BANNETH â¢ BAYLEY / JUDITH â¢ MUNHOZ]
The keeper's game
I will listen to your claim
The legacy is true
Left all to you
