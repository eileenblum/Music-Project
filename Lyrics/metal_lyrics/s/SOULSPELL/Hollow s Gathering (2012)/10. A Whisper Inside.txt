[WAYNA â¢ SOMMERVILLE]
It comes from above
It comes with no goal
It comes from unknown old waves

[YARED â¢ SOUZA]
A breath brings you down
A breath to go on
A breath takes you with the wind

[WAYNA â¢ SOMMERVILLE / YARED â¢ SOUZA]
When it comes
You don't have to bleed

[WAYNA â¢ SOMMERVILLE]
It just goes

[YARED â¢ SOUZA]
God can't you ease my pain?

[WAYNA â¢ SOMMERVILLE]
God can't you ease my pain? oh...

[YARED â¢ SOUZA]
In circles we remain the same

[WAYNA â¢ SOMMERVILLE / YARED â¢ SOUZA]
God can't you trust me again?
Feelings i have them to share
When it comes
You don't have to bleed
It just goes with the wind

[WAYNA â¢ SOMMERVILLE]
From the ashes you can wash
Your grief and tears away

[WAYNA â¢ SOMMERVILLE / YARED â¢ SOUZA]
Recall your purpose of life
Let your flame burning inside

[YARED â¢ SOUZA]
Reborn from all this rot

We're not the same, not anymore

[YARED â¢ SOUZA]
There's nothing left to fear

[WAYNA â¢ SOMMERVILLE]
I'll hear you once more

[YARED â¢ SOUZA]
We are bound forever

[WAYNA â¢ SOMMERVILLE]
The whispers inside you

[WAYNA â¢ SOMMERVILLE / YARED â¢ SOUZA]
The whispers inside you

Heleno Vale â Drums
