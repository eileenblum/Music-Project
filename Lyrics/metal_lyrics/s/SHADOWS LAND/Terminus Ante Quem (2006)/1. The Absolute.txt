[Music and Lyrics: Aro]

Let's say, it will happen that way
Or that it has happened
I've got stabbed
with a blade making sense
Prickly tooth revealing the truth
Let say, it will reveal that truth
That it has already happened
Waving space, cold walls
let say that cold blackness, the fog of acute impressions
That it was that way, and there is such place
the absolute.
