[Music and Lyrics: Aro]

I explain to myself - too much drugs?
Maybe I'm sick?
I close my eyes and the darkness becomes the eternity,
I feel "your" world going away,
this moment like a fly on a shit, rotting bodies, everlasting scream,
I feel the stench of human existence
And God is late for the meeting
I see myself slashing my flatmate's artery,
I go further, faster, I run, I feel relief,
warmth is going through my backbone the washing- machine is spin-drying,
the hum of everyday news on the radio, a head in my hands....
I keep it and see it in harmony with my emotions,
suddenly so calm at the moment
The eternity is so blessed
And God is still late for the meeting...
