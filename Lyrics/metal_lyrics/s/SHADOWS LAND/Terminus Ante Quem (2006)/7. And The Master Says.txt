[Music: Aro / Lyrics: J Nerexo]

when I woke up
I closed my eyes just for a moment
And this moment lasts until now
Come!
I'll lead you into the darkness
You'll see it through my eyes and don't be afraid
I write with a demon's hand
Do you understand it?
Human language is unreal to me
once I saw a mirror
I shot at it
I got to know the scraps of my life
I'll cut Demon, when the time comes for black arts
I know it must hurt
I got a gift-mind's purification, though it's not life's one
And the master says-"you waited for life-now wait for death"
