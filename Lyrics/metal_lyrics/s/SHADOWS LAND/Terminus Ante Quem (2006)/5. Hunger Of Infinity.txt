[Music and Lyrics: Aro]

I want to contain the whole world
to become micro cosmos
I'm like a factory of thoughts
I'm just with myself
with my word, my power and energy as a man
as a demon, as a God, as Baphomet's symbol
a seed in all this commotion
Atum, Itmu,
creator of omnithing, father of all Gods
I'm just with myself
with my word, my power and energy as a man
as a demon, as a God, as Baphomet's symbol

it's becoming tighter
I want to feed my mind with freedom
let myself to rapacious leanings, trigger off manifesto of social traces
leave my body, fly into oblivion.
