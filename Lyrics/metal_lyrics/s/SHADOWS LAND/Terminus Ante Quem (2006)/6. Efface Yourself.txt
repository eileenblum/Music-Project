[Music and Lyrics: Aro]

Bow to me faithfully
Build the church
And I will give you hope
I'll lead you through the path of my existence
I'll lead you as a creator of hope
let's join into couples, let's create power
let's generate a new being
let's create half-god, half-man
The legend of the great
let the day come
The day when all dominant and powerful will reign again and rule where the first set their steps
The time of the contemporary has come to an end, efface yourself
this species is rotting from the inside, I give you the choice
don't be stupid!
They will grant you existence but efface yourself
