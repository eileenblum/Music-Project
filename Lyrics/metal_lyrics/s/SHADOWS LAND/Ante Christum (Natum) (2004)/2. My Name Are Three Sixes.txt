[Music and Lyrics: Aro]

Live is a beast
The beast in my head
My name are three sixes...
I'll wait till I'm born...
I'll meet the beast
Life is a dimension
My dimension..
Where will I meet it?
That's not what I desire...
These thoughts, what thoughts?
Kill!
Physically I'm non-existent!
Re and Ka are my guides..
Body joint with oblivion!
Well...
I've got what I want...
I'm back...!
