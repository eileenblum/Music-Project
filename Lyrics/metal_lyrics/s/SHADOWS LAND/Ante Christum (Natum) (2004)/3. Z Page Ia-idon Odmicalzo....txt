[Music and Lyrics: Aro]

I'm from nowhere, my soul ...
The priest in the darkest hour
Hear my voice
Hear me
Dark sound stole in my soul again
Fucking cinders
Do you feel being of reign
Free words ...

This Kingdom locked in one body
From nowhere ...
... but crown by my soul
Soul by a Priest in the darkest hour
Hear my voice
Hear me !!!
Dark scream stole in my soul again ...
... "Z PAGE IA- IDON ODMICALZO,
LAP EMNA, Z TRIAN SONF,
OD TABA QUI- IN Z LAINSI... "
