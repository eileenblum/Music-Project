[Music and Lyrics: Mayhem]

The bloody history from the
Past deceased humans now
Forgotten. An age of
Legends and fear a time now
So distant.
Pagan fears:
The past is alive.
The past is alive.
Woeful people with pale faces
Staring obsessed at the moon
Some memories will never go away
And they will forever be here.
