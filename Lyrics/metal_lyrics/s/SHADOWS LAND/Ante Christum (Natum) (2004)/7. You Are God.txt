[Music and Lyrics: Aro]

You are god...
Relax !
...being about structure raised to reign
You are human...
Sober
Creating, striding, in rest,
With imagination
Without imagination for god
Machine, behind the mist,  reigning
Brotherly till sick
Rotting
Devoted in wedge looked
Forgive lamb!
I forgive!
I am god
Relax
I devour only your interior!
