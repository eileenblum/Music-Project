[Music and Lyrics: Aro]

Diabolic glance
Paralysis my body
Diabolic glance
Dark to pieces my interior
Diabolic glance
Dark at ages
Diabolic glance
Death...
Dead glance
Coolness to embrace
My body
Dead glance
I'm it which to give me this life
Dead glance
I'm it with...
Diabolic glance...
I'm dead...
Master myself
Master Darks
Master asleep
Asleep at ages
