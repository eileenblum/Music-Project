[Music: Aro / Lyrics: Don]

Through the wind, through the rustle of shrub
In the mist of setting sun
In the mist...
Burning in blood of flower rapture lips
Silence of silent in dark water of night
Silence of silent...
In dark sides, in bush of graves
Depth of dream and enormity of thirst
Depth of dream...
Their spirits sink in poison worlds
In bag of longing in old tombs of mildew
Smell of Pain
