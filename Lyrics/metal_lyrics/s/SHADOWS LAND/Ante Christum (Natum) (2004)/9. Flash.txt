[Music and Lyrics: Aro]

Pity mind,
Filth was enaculated
State zero-enlightening,
Realization, moment of expire,
Request about next miserable
Existence!!!
Constainnt your minde,
Tighten up circle of slave.
Illusion!!! No!!!
Gleam your life...
Let this moment writes
Visions demonic look was given...
Audience goes on,
Words of truth were casted
Demon of relief!!!
State zero...
Free of my mind somewhere in
Galactic peace...
