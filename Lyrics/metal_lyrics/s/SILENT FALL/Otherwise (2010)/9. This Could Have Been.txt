This could have been a normal day
As I live hundreds one all year long
A case lost in the old calendar
That you're crossing everyday

This could have taken another way
But destiny never prevents
You just have to be on time
For the rendez-vous of your life

But this feeling is out of time
Taking you away in a wonderful dance
Full of forms and of colours
That you'll never be able to describe

Beyond my dreams
There is the place where you've carried me
Far from the sun
Behind the stars
Boarding for the everlasting flight
Gimme your hand
On the Highway to eternity
Look in my eyes
See what I see
Your love has changed the world around me

Do you still want a time machine?
Be as a god and all rebuild
You could be master of the Earth
All change as you will
But if one thing had been altered
Consequences may be disastrous
If I were you I wouldn't take the risk
