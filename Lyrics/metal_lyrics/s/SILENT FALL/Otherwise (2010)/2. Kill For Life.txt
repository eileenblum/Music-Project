I'm writing these lines but I don't know why
Maybe to clear my mind
I've seen too many atrocities
Supported too many lies

Am I a puppet who must just act
These concepts are not mine
Immersed in this barbarity
I see what's bad or right

Are we god to lake lives?
We just have to press a trigger
But do we feel better after that
For them injuries, for me scars
Hidden behind their desks
Enough with a word or a click
They use us Io defend their deals
Nothing but expendable

Kill for life
Survival instincts and orders, I am a blind
Do or die
The Court-martial or my last humanity act
Keep them alive
My brain has some thoughts, but lost control of my arms
Do or die

Who are we for those hidden leaders,
The number of a file?
Money has become their only goal
Their reason to survive

The media under their control
But not the Volunteers
Those few people who do their best
To save so many lives
