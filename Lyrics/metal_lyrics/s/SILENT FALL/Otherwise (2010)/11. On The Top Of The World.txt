The road is long
Obstacles you'll have to climb
This voice inside your head
Telling you to carry on
Disillusion will be part of your days
Despair may spread like a wildfire
It's time to fight
Climb the steps one by one
To reach the goal of your life
Get up again and walk on the straight line
And one day you will be the number one
Welcome to the story of life
In this world you won't be spared
You will have to keep standing
And to face them without fear
But your mind will be unfailing
Because you have this will
Just go forward and trust in you
The goal is so close

Would you be the same
If everything was easy
You build yourself everyday
Despite the ordeals on the path
So never surrender
And keep the fire going
The maze has an exit
That you will have to find

Never surrender, never forget
The fire, burns in your veins

All the bad things in your life are now gone from your mind
You are in this world on this day and we read in your eyes

That your work was not done in vain despite the scars on the road
We'll always remain that you'll carry on, and until the end you will be the one
