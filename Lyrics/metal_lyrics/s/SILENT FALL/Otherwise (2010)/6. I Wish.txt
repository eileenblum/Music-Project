I'm walking in the streets
Around me there are no souls
Everything seems to sleep
In this life I want (to) leave
I'm walking in the streets escaping to my fears
Why is no one able to look at me?
I can see the gladness in their eyes full of fantasy
I would give everything to have a piece of this dream
And I wish a world where someone would
Take care of me
Giving me some love and a reason to live
Where the people could look in my eyes
Without scorn or hatred
Dreams can be true you just have to believe
so I wish

I'm walking in the streets avoiding the walkers
Lost in thoughts they can't see a child who's suffering
I'm walking in the streets but I have the feeling
My life is a tunnel without an exit sign

I'm walking in this world which didn't adopt me
One soul among a crowd, however so lonely
I'm walking all alone on the way straight ahead
Leaving the past behind, now it's time to react

And I'll run to their world full of fantasy
Even if I have to climb some hills
And one day I'll find my own destiny
Until this day I won't stop to believe, I will wish
