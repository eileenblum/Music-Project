They say I am insane
Synapses dead inside my head
Enclosed between these walls
I am a the king without my crown
Voices are calling me
Visions of life they can't see
They think they know the truth
Mythomany, riot a rule

If only they could know how they are wrong
I am not the only one in prison
Dreams can build a better world
But not a Dreamworld

Who is the fool?
I see them destroy their own reign
Life is a gift they can't understand
Will they lead us to the end of human race?
Outside my cell there are another... fools
I hear, the other's laughs
I think that they understand too
Craziness is a force
That is our advantage on you
My neurons are boiling
The straightjackets around my arms
Dementia and Rabies
The diagnosis may be this one

Who is the fool?
I see them destroy their own reign
Life is a gift they can't understand
Will they lead us to the end of human race?
Outside my cell there are another... fools

It's just a difference in point of view
A question never asked 'cause we fear the truth
But answer me: For you, who is the fool?
Humanity is not able to realize
Instead of finding some culprits
We should all try to change our own minds
