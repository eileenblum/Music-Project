One ace of spades out of my hand
Just enough to give them
The feeling to be lost
They try to understand
The cards are waltzing before one's eyes

Here comes the finishing stroke
They remain speechless
Clappings, Congratulations
Under my cloak I am alone
World of secrets I can't reveal
My life is hell
My name gives them some dreams

But my nightmares are still real
World of secrets that I must keep

Enclosed in a deep part of my mind
Or one day the illusion will end

Magic would die

I read their spirits as a book
Manipulation
The other side of the mirror
May be deceptive
Agility, Diversion, they fall into the trap

The solution is close

A magician should not be trusted
