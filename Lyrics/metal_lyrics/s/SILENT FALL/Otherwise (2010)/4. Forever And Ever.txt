Everyday it's around us but we are blinded
Unable to open our eyes and to see the truth
Among us there are many millions of forgotten souls

We are supposed to, but who follows the rules?
Whatever your colour's skin
You're able to fly

Born in depth of time
We're all brothers
In the same pantomime
Forever
So change your mind
We'll live together
United as one
And ever...

We dream of a world without violence and fear but are we able
To erase what's inside our minds? We still have the time
Anyone's smile can crumble your life
A colour can change someone, but that's the colour of your heart
