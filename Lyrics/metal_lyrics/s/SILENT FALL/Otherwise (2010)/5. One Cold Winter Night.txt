Throwing my dreams out of my mind
The dusk has come on me without a sign
The last ray of the sun has left my heart

For so long I've kept my angers hidden to the eyes of the world
And even if tomorrow everything will be gone
Tonight I just need to unwind
My heart is cold tonight
A desert made of snow and ice
Even the hottest blaze
Could not render my darkest sights
My heart is dead tonight
The storm destroyed my paradise
The will to hate someone
Just for one night

I had not been angry for so long
But tonight my beliefs are dead
Enclosed in a grave made of despair
The dawn will come, my fury will end
But until the world awakes
My rage will carry on
