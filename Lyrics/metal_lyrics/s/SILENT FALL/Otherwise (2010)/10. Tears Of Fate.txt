Everyone has already dreamed
We could change everything
As if the point of no return
Had never been reached
But there's one rule no one can break
Even the masters of Hell
The fourth dimension will ever be a straight line

Just one way
Don't gaze what is behind
Your solace
Will not be in the past
In the future, just believe
Time will be your best cure

Tears of Fate
'Cause the past has gone
Without letting a chance of return
Look ahead now
Better time will come
What is done is done
You don't have to cry
These tears of Fate

Thousands of destinies
That events everyday build
Is your own path as heavenly
As your buried wish?
Don't be afraid of your mistakes

They are a part of human race
Just learn of them and next time don't do it again

Do you still want a time machine?
Be as a god and all rebuild
You could be master of the Earth
All change as you will
But if one thing had been altered
Consequences may be disastrous
If I were you I wouldn't take the risk
