I need to get more speed
I need to feel the heat inside my mind
I like to go real fast
I like to make it last 'cause I'm a victory

Bare my demon seed
I kiss the cross
I take the creed
A little bit of substance abuse
I've got nothing to lose

Tie me down, strap me in
No back seat driver gonna poke my skin
I've got nitrous oxide on my brain
The vicious fucker's gonna keep me sane
Cause I'm never gonna give up
Even on the day I die

Speed kills
Gotta get my thrills
No one's gonna slow me down
From where I'm going
Speed kills
Gotta get my thrills
No one's gonna slow me down
From where I'm going

You love your heroin
You never learn, my friend
It's eating you alive
Infesting your mind
I tried to tell you once
You wouldn't listen to me
You wouldn't listen to me
You wouldn't listen to me

Bare my demon seed
I kiss the cross
I take the creed
A little bit of substance abuse
I've got nothing to lose

Tie me down, strap me in
No back seat driver gonna poke my skin
I've got nitrous oxide on my brain
The vicious fucker's gonna keep me sane
Cause I'm never gonna give up
Even on the day I die

Speed kills
Gotta get my thrills
No one's gonna slow me down
From where I'm going
Speed kills
Gotta get my thrills
No one's gonna slow me down
From where I'm going

Speed kills
Speed kills
Speed kills
Speed kills
