Here I am in this place
I climb the walls
And wallow in the waste
Of all the human race

I realize in a different time
We could have changed
But now it's all behind
Written in a rhyme
On some forgotten page

All the world will keep no turning
All the while our backs are burning
All the seasons come and leave us
Institution of our learning light

Now you life's on the line
So raise your voice to their kind
And watch them kill every day
Like dust is blowing away
Everyday, everyday

I used to believe all they were saying
I used to believe all of the lies
But now I can see that all that they're saying
They're only lies, they're only lies

I used to believe all they were saying
I used to believe all of the lies
But now I can see all that they're saying
They're only lies, they're only lies
