Hey you, what are you doing
I can see you in the mirror
But I can't make out your face
Hey you, what are you doing
Pumping rocket fuel with a hype
Through outer space

There's a place where we're going
Chrystal meth is my calling
Come with me, it's okay
It's alright now, baby
Up for seven days
Now we're monsters
Now we're going crazy

I'm back in Los Angeles
Cured my need for real good speed
Running with the pack, I'm on a mission
Selfdestructing me
No more loneliness to feed
Misery loves company
And I really love you
Need you, want you baby, can't you see

There's a place where we're going
Chrystal meth is my calling
Come with me, it's okay
It's alright now, baby
Up for seven days
Now we're monsters
Now we're going crazy

Come with me
It's alright now, baby
Come with me
It's okay now, baby
