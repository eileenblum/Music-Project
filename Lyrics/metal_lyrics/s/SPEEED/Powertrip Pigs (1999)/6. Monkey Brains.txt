I will rule your world
I will give you everything
Tell you what to do
Tell you how to feel the pain
You don't need to know
This is your reality
Monkey see, monkey do
This is what is left of you

Monkey brains
Out on the field
Out on the landscape

Soldiers in a dirt war
A gallery of red
A picture says a thousand words
Yet none of them are said
Silence fills this void
Like some familiar voice
The essence of the chaos
I can almost taste

Monkey brains
Monkey brains and blood stains
Out on the field
Out on the landscape

Stand up, sit down
Stand up, sit down
Stand up, sit down
Stand up, sit down
