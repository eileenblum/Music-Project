So cool, so nice, so pure, so right
Your life, their gun, our fight
Raping all our freedom
Trying to be a man

Power trip pigs
Get off my dick
You're running us into the ground
Just to get your kicks
Power trip pigs
You make me sick
Murderers and rapists rule this town

One brain, one cell, one thought
From Hell, to serve, protect
No rights, respect, your shield
Their voice, your fate, their choice
So go buy a gun

Power trip pigs
Get off my dick
You're running us into the ground
Just to get your kicks
Power trip pigs
You make me sick
Murderers and rapists rule this town
