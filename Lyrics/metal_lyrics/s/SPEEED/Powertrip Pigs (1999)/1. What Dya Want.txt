Always taking and you're never giving
You're a Succubus
Because you're always receiving
You peck and peck, tearing apart my soul
You drop me down into a six foot hole
Fear is driving me, lust is draining me
Taking every essence of my soul
Digging me in, taking me whole

What dya want
What dya want
What do you want from me
What dya want
What dya want
What do you want from me

Always censoring my mindset
Motives with your artful thinking
And your narcissist ways
Mental games are so clever and clean
This cage is tight and crystal clear
Sex, greed, another fix is what you need
Just keep pushing, it'll be okay
Another day, some other way

What dya want
What dya want
What do you want from me
What dya want
What dya want
What do you want from me
