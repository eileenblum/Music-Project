I am a number
I am a slave
Social insurance
They own my grave

Corporate witches
Sowing my stitches
Spreading their magic
They're Satan's bitches

Tag me, bag me
Nail me to the wall
The old men are laughing
They're killing us all
Money and power has gone to my head
Spending the future, we're better of dead

That's why I smoke marijuana
Spit on government piranhas
I dwell in the concrete jungle
Watching the animals fumble

Corporate witches
Sowing my stitches
Spreading their magic
They're Satan's bitches

Tag me, bag me
Nail me to the wall
The old men are laughing
They're killing us all
Money and power, they're fucking my head
Spending the future, we're better of dead
That's what I said

Corporate witches
Sowing my stitches
Spreading their magic
They're Satan's bitches

Tag me, bag me
Nail me to the wall
The old men are laughing
They're killing us all
Money and power, they're fucking my head
Spending the future, we're better of dead
That's what I said
Fucked with my head
