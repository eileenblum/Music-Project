Step right up and join the free world
Paradise in the garden for you girl
Sign your flesh on the dotted line
This is once in a lifetime
I am the serpent
I've got an apple for you
In New York city
Take a bite out of me

Welcome to Chinatown
You work for me
A dollar a day, you give your soul away
Welcome to Chinatown
You work for me
A dollar a day, you give your soul away

Slithering across the sea
On waves of misery
Shackled to the debt
Bought and sold and yet
Your soul is sublet to the city
Come drink the venom
We'll never let them take you home alive
You have to somehow survive this hell

In Chinatown
You work for me
A dollar a day, you give your soul away
Welcome to Chinatown
You work for me
A dollar a day, you give your soul away

You used to be so pure
Like a flower in its pre-floral stage
But you chose to ride the snake
Onto your grave
Like so many others

Welcome to Chinatown
Welcome to Chinatown
Welcome
Welcome
