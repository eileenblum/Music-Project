Load, shoot, kill, do it again
Load, shoot, kill,
Load, shoot, kill, that's what I said
Load, shoot, kill

Buried alive, your life is denied
You had to kill the children
Cause you never ask why
Did you do it for money
Did you taste the blood
When you watched them die

All you zombies follow
All you brainwashed I bought

Back to the front
You fucking slaves
Take your shovels and dig your graves
Give your life for the killing machines
Hell just locked you in this dream

No way out
No way out
Out of your mind
Out of your soul
Take what you learn
Bring it back home
Kids kill kids for the money machine
Sucking it up with corporate greed

All you zombies follow
All you brainwashed I bought
All you braindead

All you zombies follow
All you brainwashed I bought

I've been hearing these voices for so long
Kill it again, kill it again
Still I hear these voices through the wall
Kill it again, kill it again
