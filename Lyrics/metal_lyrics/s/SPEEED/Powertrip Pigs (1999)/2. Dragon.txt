March out of your mind
Ready to fight
Kicking some face and teeth
Fall, fall out of place
You'll get a taste
Of what I can deliver to you

Heaven, Earth and man
Earth, blood and sky
They'll kill you if they can
Hail to Dragon

War, so you wanna war
Greed, guts and gore
What you're looking for
Four triggers and a crew
Take you for a ride
Goon squads coming
So you better try to hide
Better try to hide
Better try to hide

Heaven, Earth and man
Earth, blood and sky
They'll kill you if they can

I can feel it in my head
See my devil's come to play
Can't you feel it in my head
The devil's come to play

Heaven, Earth and man
Earth, blood and sky
They'll kill you if they can

I can feel it in my head
My devil's come to play
Can't you feel it in my head
The devil's come to play
