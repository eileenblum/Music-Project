Bleak shades become familiar
Within a cavernous haze
Eyes wide but lifeless
Billows of smoke decay

Free, yet held in place
Bound by veins

No winds can disconnect
Severed from the outside
Roots swell and seep
And drain life from everything

Behold, a change
All consuming
Dead skin, dead flesh
Earthly womb

[Chorus]
Deathly haze so thick
Coiling the air
Once stood a hollow man, once stood a ghost
Beyond the resurrected

Now the blood that pulses through me has been replaced
Eyes sink into this vast land and ocean

[Solo: Middleton]

Forced through the Earth's shell

I can't see the sky anymore
I can't see what's dragging me down

[Chorus]
Deathly haze so thick
Coiling the air
Once stood a hollow man, once stood a ghost
Beyond the resurrected
