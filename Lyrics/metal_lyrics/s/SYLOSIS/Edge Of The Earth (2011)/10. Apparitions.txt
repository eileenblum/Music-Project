How quick the seasons changeThe leaves turned from green to greyA flickering apparition hovers aboveSo familiar, yet so distantPreserved in age, icy hands support a somber faceLike a curse of immortalityFather time mocks meThrough grave and tombPast valley and precipiceEmerges the ghost of retributionThe horizon burns, set light by kin and bloodA snake amongst us, has soured this soilSometimes I hope you aren't looking down on me, to witness what I've becomeThrough time you will see what blinds youBeholder of all lightTurn back the stoneTo your slumber returnSuspended on a tide of obscurityA wraith missing a crownIt almost feels like time is standing stillYet somehow time has drained me of my youthThe years I've waited have all but slipped awayTorn from meFather time forever mocks me [Solo]I have become, I have become, powerless, power-lessI have become, I have become, so emotionlessThrough time you will see what blinds youBeholder of all lightTurn back the stoneTo your slumber return
