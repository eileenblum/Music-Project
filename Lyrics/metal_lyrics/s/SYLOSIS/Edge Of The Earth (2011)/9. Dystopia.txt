A wave of lightTears through the eyeAs the taste of bitter destructionSwells the tongueBaron EarthSwen with seeds of wrathEngulfed in tragedyBy purveyors of corruption and greedOn suffering they feedFlock to the heavensIn swells of despairCrawling towards your bitter endTurn away from the SunThat's severed the night from dayWhen all lie, steal and cheatIt means nothing in a world of deceit...And without wordsThe black hearts of manWill teach us to fearBy the force of their handWhen rivers flood and break their banksTides turn, storm rollsWhen skies ignite with rain like fireTides turn, storm rollsWhen mortal men barter for peaceBeware he who bears the mark of the beastFollowing blind men,To their gravesDeath greets you,With a suffocating embrace...And without wordsThe black hearts of manWill teach us to fearBy the force of their hand
