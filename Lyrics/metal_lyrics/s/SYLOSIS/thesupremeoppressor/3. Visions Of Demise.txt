Wake up to what ends your existence
And through these eyes you'll see your end
Through these eyes you'll see your end

Terrified, future so uncertain
Realise, that we've hit the bottom
Behind the shadows are boundaries beyond our sight
The final sunset descending into the shades of night
Worlds crumble

Terrified, future so uncertain
Realise, that we've hit the bottom
So see a wasteland of pure catastrophe
A lump inside the throat, we face the enemy

Sky burns to dust waking the chaos
Light turns to dusk
Blessing of death received

[Solo]

Face this nightmare
Kill this demon
Smash all cowards and rise to power

Eyes upon the fallen
We climb over the bodies
Design is from the maker
The games of the creator

The icy calling of those ascending in this,
Their final hour

(The final sunset)
(Descending)
(The final sunset)

Worlds crumble and vanish from sight
Worlds crumble and vanish from sight

And through these eyes you'll see your end

And through these eyes you'll see your end!
