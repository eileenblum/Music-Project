Fall into this nightmare we've built
Ripping ourselves from within
With a desperate cry
With the taste of sweat on my tongue

(Blind!)
Blind from this state that we're in
Blinded like moths to the flame
With a desperate cry
With the taste of fears we create

Failure!

Oh! [Solo]

Learn!
Driven by what we achieve
Draining ourselves from within
And a desperate cry
From the promise of starting again

Die!
Broken from where we have failed
Never returning again
With a desperate cry
With the sense of a life thrown away

In this fire we burn
Back to the light we return

I hear the dying screams
I sense the end is near
With a final exhalation
My soul is reborn in fire

This fire will burn
In this fire we'll burn
A sense of life is thrown away
We learn to fall and run away

A sense of life is thrown away
In this fire we'll burn

In this fire we burn
Back to the light we return
