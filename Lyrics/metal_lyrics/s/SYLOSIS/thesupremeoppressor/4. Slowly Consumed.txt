Fear engulfs the seeps from the stars
Into the essence of man
Taking it's form the nightmare begins
Void of life and slowly consumed

We sleep, but for how long?

Cherished hope has wasted away
Until all that remains
Is a shell, a dull mass of grey

But still we fight
We fight for existence
Preservation and survival

And if we fail, what will be our end?
Close your eyes and pretend

There was once a way we could hide
Leave ourselves far behind
Until this will drain us no more
We'll reclaim what is ours

We sleep, but for how long?

We fight for existence
Preservation and survival

A final whispered breath...
It leaves you now

And if we fail what will be our end?
Close your eyes (close your eyes) and pretend (and pretend)

Close your eyes (those eyes) and pretend

[Solo]

A final whispered breath
It leaves you now
Ascend... Return to us

A final whispered breath...
It leaves you now
Ascend forever and return to us

A final whispered breath...
It leaves you now

We fight for existence
Preservation and survival
