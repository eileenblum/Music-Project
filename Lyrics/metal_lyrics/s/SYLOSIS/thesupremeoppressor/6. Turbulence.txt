We close our eyes waiting for change
Hoping in vain for respite
This tired life wearing us thin
Draining the light from my heart
Draining the light from my heart

What unites us tears us apart

We close our eyes praying for change
Silence from those in the sky
This tired life wearing us thin
Draining the light from my heart

Forcing my hand I have no choice but to fight
Deception
Thoughts in my head I can no longer control
Turbulence

Rising!
Up to this precipice
Falling, faster, into oblivion

We close our eyes, waiting for day
Hoping in vain for the sun
This tired sky scorches the earth
Draining the light from our hearts
Forcing my hand I have no choice but to fight

Deception
Thoughts in my head I can no longer control
Turbulence

Rising!
Up to this precipice
Falling, faster, into oblivion

Rising!
Up to this precipice
Falling, faster, into oblivion

Slowly lower your hands
There is no choice for us now
But to admit defeat
Concende to the power

[Solo]

Rising
Up to this precipice
Falling, faster, into oblivion

Rising!
Up to this precipice
Falling, faster, into obivion
