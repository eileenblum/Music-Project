Standing on a platform to speak with a forked tongue
How spit drips with irony
Yet you're so righteous in your mind
I see the blackness inside your heart
Seething, your rage is without an ounce
Of meaning or coherence

Despised

Remove your mask
You're fooling no-one now
So close to your demise
Your time is running out

You're craving adulation, you wonder what is wrong
The eyes staring back at you are apathetic to a liar
I see your pretence begin to fade
Seething, your rage is without an ounce
Of meaning or coherence

Despised

Remove your mask
You're foolin no-one now
So close to your demise
Your time is running out

Removed of dignity and now
The sense of worth begins to fade
Sickening vanity and now
No sense of purpose will remain

How will you find your way?

So began this [?]
Lost in failure
Devoid of passion
You sealed your own fate

So began this
Lost in failure
Devoid of passion
You sealed your own fate

And so it ends...

All!
Your!
Lives!!

And so it ends!

[Solo]

I can see
See the blackness inside your heart
Seething, your rage is driven by madness

Go!

I see your pretence,
Perish before me
Cowardly vermin,
Devoid of glory!

Removed of dignity and now
The sense of worth begins to fade
Sickening vanity and now
No sense of purpose will remain

Remain!
