Venom lingers upon your tongue
Spreading deception like air into our lungs
You're bound by the fire that burns us all to dust
If light is our salvation there's nothing left to trust

Casting the shadows

Poisoned ethics disguised by a smile
Drop the blindfold in front of your eyes
Run from the lighting, your fists will tell no tales

Your ignorance and deceit
Will see that no one else prevails

This, this will unveil
This will reveal
This will cast our sights

Seeking, I'm waiting
For something
To shed some light
Seeking, I'm waiting
For something
To leave behind

This, this will unveil
This will reveal
This will clear our eyes

Casting the shadows
