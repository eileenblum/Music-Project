Memory is the sadness we keep
Eternity is an endless sleep
In the light of remorse
We will let the pain run its course
This will be our desire burns right though your soul
The only way we know

Rivers run just to wash deceit
The ground will break to swallow us whole
Watch their eyes as they tell their lies
As the stars tear the skies apart
This will be our desire burns right through your soul
The only way we know

It is all we have left as we watch the sun set and never forget
This will be our desire burns right though your soul
The only way we know
