You chose the light
I took the dark
And in your pain I suffered
The day is done
But what is left
Our tome is out and they are counting
They still regret their every moves

Empty souls
Endless Woes
Every thought will drag you...

As is above and is below
The clouds roll on
The land will stir
We grasp the rope
And we are the bait
We both will lose for it's our fate
You cling to a life you can't obtain

Empty souls
Endless Woes
Every thought will drag you under

Mark this fucking words

Unveiling a tragic life
A means to an end an end of your time

We will learn by the way we lose
Our lives are like empty graves
Not a glimpse of hope left
