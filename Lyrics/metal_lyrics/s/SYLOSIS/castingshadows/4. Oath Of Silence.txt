Shamed by the weak and cast down in disgust
A shell of a broken man without trust
Preaching upon open ears of the deaf
Depraved words uttered beneath your cold breath

Killing what is left of the embers of youth
Scraping and clawing for a whisper of truth
Sewing our mouths shut as nothing escapes
Love and grace is a display of a man you once were

But unlike the hand of Midas what you touch will turn to shit 
Blood will flow between us and the ground will shake until you repent your sins
But unlike the hand of Midas what you touch will turn to shit
Burn this fucking saviour until you see the damage you have caused

The touch of cold skin and the embrace of life
In darkness dwells secrets in a holy disguise
Nothing will soothe you, old hands will turn numb
Silence will not speak
