New light breaks the sky
Echoing through the dawn
Keep your eyes fixed ahead
Days pass with every tide

As the crow flies
Walk on the wind
Everything will unfold
There is nothing left for me
The life we wanted does not exist
We're numb to the core

Slipping further down

There was nothing to guide me
I've searched through and through
By the time you read this I will be gone
Just follow the path I've laid out for you

We're living a lie
When nothing is tangible
We'll be dead inside
We weren't made for these times

When they come for you
There will be no pity
No hesitations
When they come for you
Don't give in easily

When this world crumbles
You will endure the everlasting emptiness
Alone
