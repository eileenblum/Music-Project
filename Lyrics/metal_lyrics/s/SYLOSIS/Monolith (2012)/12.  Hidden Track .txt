I will be watching you until I look faint
Out of the light out of harms way
I cannot hear you breathing but I can feel the warmth
If you carry on sleeping, you would not dream at all
Keep the door closed, I should never of forced your hand
Stay inside and remain as lonely as I am

And if you cannot speak just give me a sign
And if you cannot move I can read your eyes 
I cannot hear you breathing but I can feel the warmth
If you carry on sleeping, you would not dream at all
Keep the door closed, I should never of forced your hand
Stay inside and remain as lonely as I am
I cannot find you.
