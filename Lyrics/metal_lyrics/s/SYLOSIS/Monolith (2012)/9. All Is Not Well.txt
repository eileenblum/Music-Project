Concede to the ways of the world
Tragedy and prevailing woe
For every fabrication
There is a truth you will never know
Fell their spies
Crawling under your skin
When the wind screams
All is not well

Forbid the sins
And watch the heart grow with desire

Wise men become kings
Or so they would have you believe
One manâs failure is another manâs glory
Feel their spies
Crawling under your skin
When the sky bleeds
All is not well

Forbid the sins
And watch the heart grow with desire

And nothing will change
Flood it all and keep it away
When the days grow colder
And the colour fades
Nothing will change
Nothing will change

Free us
From season upon season of misery
This is misanthropy
This is the world I see

Free us from season upon season of misery
This is the penalty
This is the price Iâve paid

This is the world I see

And nothing will change
Flood it all and keep it away
When the days grow colder
And the colour fades
Nothing will change
Until this season ends
