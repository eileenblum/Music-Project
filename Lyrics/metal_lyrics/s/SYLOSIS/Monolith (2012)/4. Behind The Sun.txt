In years to come
Everything will crumble
Within your palms
It is all an illusion
How could you be so blind
In years to come
The skies will conspire against you
Say farewell to the beacon that shines
It has left you behind
I've seen the sun
Burn out beyond its years

In years to come
Everyone will turn on you
Within an instant you're on your own
How could you have been so blind
They will leave you behind

I've seen the sun
Burn out beyond its years
As time peels away
I found the truth was safe
I don't owe a thing to this world
This world belongs to me

I am beyond death
Time has taken its toll
A vision so clearly tangible
Reality draws to a halt

Why look for an answer
If you refuse to let go
You're living a lie

I've seen the sun
Burn out beyond its years
As time peels away
I found the truth was safe
I don't belong to this world
This world belongs to me.
