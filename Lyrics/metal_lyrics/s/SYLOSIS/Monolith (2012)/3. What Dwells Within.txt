Biding Time
For what as felt like centuries
Dead ends in front of me
The sting of reality strikes down

And still you keep it in

The weakness you hide
Consumes your life
Carry the weight down to your grave
And wait for Death's hand

Paralysed and waiting endlessly
Is it something I will never find
A thirst never to be satisfied

I watched you take the strain

The weakness you hide
Consumes your life
Like a search that never ends
Your existence is unexplained

It ignites the flame inside
What makes you feel alive again
Is to understand what it means to die

Is it something I will never find
A thirst never to be satisfied

Winds arch over me
And waves crash down to drown everything

Is it something I will never find
A thirst never to be satisfied

It ignites the flame inside
What makes you feel alive again
Is it to understand what it means to die
