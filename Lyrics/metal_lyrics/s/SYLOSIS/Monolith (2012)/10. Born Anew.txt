Perceive new life
A third eye
Phantom limb
Cut out your heart
To wash away the stain
I see everything
For I am the seas
I am the sky
I am the sun

And I will pull you in
To show you new lies
To open your eyes
It's all falling to pieces
Beneath your feet

Life is pain
Defined by a lie
Exist to defy
If I'm heading that far down
I'm taking you with me
I am the seas
I am the sky
I am the sun

And I will pull you in
To show you new lies
To open your eyes
It's all falling to pieces
Beneath your feetÂ 
Â 
I am the seas
I am the sky
I am the sun
Clouding your judgement
Your obsessions will eat away at you
The blind leading the blind
Into a convergence of fools
