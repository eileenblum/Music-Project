Tired eyes
Shocked into a daze
The monolith rose from the ground
And the sky was red
Like the soil in my grave
The earth shook with the tides
And caused storms through endless seas
Tell the gods to gather their clouds
To amend this broken dream

Dead to the world
Cast a silent revolt
The slaughtered black sheep
No hope comes as I dream of light
I clench my fists as I sleep
I've lived a thousand lives
Seen horrors through a thousand lies
Dig deeper
Through clawed hands you'll find
No end in sight

I'm so tired yet sleep is no redeemer
When every breath hurts I'll breathe even deeper
