Give in to endless deceit
Skeletal face
Crooked mouth

I once felt the life in you
Through clenched hands ripped apart

Eternally out of reach
A separationÂ 
A dying vine

Death was but a dream
But how quickly dreams become reality

Denied

Drained of all belief
Planting a seed of weakness within
When there's nothing left to bleed
It will start again

Is there no end?
Never awaken from this dream

Denied

Souls upon souls
No way to transcend
Eternal gloom
If this is truly life then make it end

Nothing can turn back time
Nothing, nothing can keep you alive

Wherever you are
Know I will carry this always
A reminder of pain
I know I'll see your ghost again

I still feel those cold silences
Broken by your footsteps

Nothing can turn back time
Nothing, nothing can keep you alive
