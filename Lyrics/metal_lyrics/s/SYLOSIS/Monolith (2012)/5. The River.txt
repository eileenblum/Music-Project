A silhouette in the light
A face hidden beneath a bone veil
The winds sound a distant voice
A wolf in sheep's clothing
A martyr beneath a mirror

Every whisper I hear
Every breath down the back of my neck
Senses can be fooled so easily
But this runs deeper
This is in my bones

Counting down the days
Dragging out the weight
Blurred lines evade the light
A wolf in sheep's clothing
A martyr's disguise

Every whisper I hear
Every breath down the back of my neck
Senses can be fooled so easily
But this runs deeper
This is in my bones

I could have sworn you lay in the ground
In my sight
Yet so far out of reach

Take this misery
Drown it with my memories
So they can never be found
Follow the river down
To where the waves break

I just watched the waters rise
And take a life
