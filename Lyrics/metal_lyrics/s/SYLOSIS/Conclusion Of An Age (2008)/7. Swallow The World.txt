Inside I Pray for sleep that never comes
How long before this night is over? It swallows me whole...
I've reached the end, with no solution
So easy to forget hope inside of me
I've lost control of all in my destiny
And to fail and falter shall be the death of me
Search far and wide for a spark of inspiration
So long I stared into the blackness and swallowed the world
The end of time, there's no tomorrow
So easy to ignore 'til the final hour
I'll take control of all in my destiny
And to fail and falter shall be the death of me
And these dark days will bathe in black all that is pure inside
Before I face the hour, the sun will set
Cold whispers in my ear 'This is not the end'
End of all that I know... eternal silence
All I have in this life will perish in flames
Feeding on my life's blood
Aching, I beg for mercy
This is more than I can take (how much will you take away?)
This is more that i can bare
So now I fall endlessly
Hope is lost, longing for sleep
To take a breath and finally see the horrors that destroy me
A dying promise of endless pain Will take you to your grave
And these dark days will bathe in black all that is pure inside
Before i face the hour, the sun will set
Cold whispers in my ear 'This is not the end'
End of all that I know... eternal silence
All I have in this life will perish in flames
