I begin descent into a world ...to another domain
Where the anguished screams and fires will fill the air
And the burning stench of sulphur asphyxiates
Where nothing is for certain, where no-one can be safe
Forced Into Fire
Struck down as I prepare to take this final step
May my reflection fade as I wash away what is left of this life
To endure is all I can attempt
Damnation everlasting
Where sentenced souls imprisoned will not repent
And there is no darker way to face this decline
Than where I am right now, The end of time
Forced Into Fire
Struck down as I prepare to take this final step
May my reflection fade as I wash away what is left of this life
Is this all that's left? Is this all that I am?
Escape from this bitter end... that only thought remains, aspire to contend
Wander blindly into the night... hope to receive a sign will I survive?
Struck down as I prepare to take this final step
May my reflection fade as I wash away what is left of this life
Forced Into Fire
