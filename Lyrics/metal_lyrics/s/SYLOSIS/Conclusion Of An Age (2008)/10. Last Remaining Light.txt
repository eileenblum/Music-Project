We wander in the maze of a thousand lost creations
Feel the streams of the coming failure and gaze upon the sky
And how did it come to this... lack of perception? Or just plain ignorance
Forging fires spreading fear into the wild,
The scorched earth will be the womb of bastard child
And the earth will devastate man to the core
The day the legacy of human is no more
Nightmares begin to surface and crash upon the walls
Hear the screams of the fallen saviours, they have no place to hide
And how did it come to this... lack of perception? Or just plain ignorance
Forging fires spreading fear into the wild
The scorched earth will be the womb of bastard child
And the earth will devastate man to the core
The day the legacy of human is no more
No force greater than destiny
Watching your world as it implodes
As the promise of hope is no longer in sight
What is the last remaining light?
Forever damned
Wander the earth
And the horizon's promise remains within our hearts
