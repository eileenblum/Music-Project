Atrocities before our eyes
This crumbling world now lies gasping for air
And is sickens me to think we will not grow old and die
Before we face extinction... human demise
As we face the end of days... as the lifeline drifts away
We're left to face impending immense decay
The strength of oceans, the blinding light
The cosmic forces revealing their might
Aeons in slumber awake the rage
Eradication closing in... conclusion of an age
And with our future in this state
Alliances are broken... friendships will turn to hate
And it sickens me to think we will not survive this day
Pushed far beyond the edge of sanity
As we fade the odds of death
As the hope dissolves away
We're left to face the sorrow eternally
The strength of oceans, the blinding light
The cosmic forces revealing their might
Aeons in slumber awake the rage
Eradication closing in... conclusion of an age
War... this war erases history
Watching as we fall apart
Witness catastrophe spread like deadly disease
Eradication closing in... conclusion of an age
