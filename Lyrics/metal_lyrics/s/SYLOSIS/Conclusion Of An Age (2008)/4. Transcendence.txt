Inside we continue to search for thoughts
Beliefs filling the void
There is nothing but a resolute
Craving  for comfort in powers beyond our control
And the journey begins for thoughts
Beliefs filling the void
There is nothing but an empty heart
Craving for solace amidst the fray
It wont be long until we are lost
His blood be on us and on our children
Will you justify?
Nations in an eternal war for thoughts
Beliefs centuries old
You are merely but a breath away
Lost in the moment in taking a life
In the name of your God
For thoughts...beliefs cleansing the earth
Who are you to criticise?
You fight for nothing but a lie
It wont be long til the parody falls
It wont be long until we are lost
His blood be on us and our children
Will you testify?
Blood is split for centuries
Lawlessness, mobocracy
Pestilence, anarchy
All in the name of powers that be
All hypocrisy
It wont be long til the parody falls
It wont be long until we are lost
