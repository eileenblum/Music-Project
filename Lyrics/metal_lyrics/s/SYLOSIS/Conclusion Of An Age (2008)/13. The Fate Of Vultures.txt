[Bonus Track]You lie with every inch of your skin
And stumble on a road that you've been treading for so long
I pity your perfection, but still
Was it ever going anyway but hideously wrong

Your perception of what matters is just so distorted
Years of lying to yourself has left you easy prey
Your inflictions upon those who matter most to you
Leave a bitter taste of failure, alone you'll stay

I have no cares
For a person that will take and never give
You'll pay the price for all you've done
So shall we all alight our god

Deny with every inch of your skin
Imprisoned by the lies that you brought yourself upon
I pity your perfection, but still
Was it ever more than anything but vanity within

Your perception of what matters is just so distorted
Years of always wanting more when you had everything
Your obsession over shit that matters most to you
Left you with nothing at all alone you'll stay

You pay the price for what you've done
So shall we all alight our god

Now realise your on your own, and soon you'll stay alone
I have no cares for a person that will take and never give
