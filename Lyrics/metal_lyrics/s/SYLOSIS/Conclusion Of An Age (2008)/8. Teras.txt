Look at the world bestowed unto our children
Their lives are over before they have begun
The weak lost in temptations of the flesh
We see the will of tyrants gaining strength
Fear in control... the screams are everywhere
Now hear the sound of millions running scared
We're crushed by the weight of the burden on our shoulders
Relentless pressure to bridge this great divide
The weak lost in the chasms of despair
We see the nations crumbling to ash
Fear in control... the screams are everywhere
Now hear the sound of millions running scared
Horrors so dark, this is no nightmare...this is real
This is the end of life... the end of life we know
Impossible to see a way for is to survive
Awakening to fury... the fury of the death
Relentless fire consuming everyone
