War will reign supreme
With the iron fist prevailing, destroying dreams of peace
And innocence will suffer all in the name of wealth
Transform this world of ours into a living hell
Rivers of blood will wash away hope of a better life
The stained humanity
And the child with the vision in this mind makes a transformation to a martyr
Opportunities have passed him by the fight to bring his nation power
War will reign supreme
With the compromises failing, this conflict sickens me
The innocent will suffer, because of a sacred text
Transform this world of ours into a living hell
Thrown to the lions, a small price to pay
In the eyes of pigs who wallow in authority
Their only vision a circus of decay
In the disguise of our salvation they lead us to our graves
