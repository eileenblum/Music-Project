Every dream is now on and the same... inspiration remains just a memory
Such a tragedy to see the day when every blessing seems to go to waste
So when did we think that the world owes us any more than we deserve?
Sickening to see us lose our way, drifting down a road of endless pain
When promise has withered inside
There is no future, no better life for mankind
Where's the truth when we've nothing to say? Push it all aside, find a better way
Such a tragedy to see the day when every blessing seems to go to waste
When promise has withered inside, there is no future... no better life
With nothing we wither inside... the earth will swallow what's left of us
To escape ...you'll find no way
Witness the end of days
The sky rips open, to light will blind us all
Oceans will rise, erasing all we know
And now the silence is everlasting
Rebirth of promise through devastation
So we failed and we lost the world... it was nothing more than we deserved
Sickening to see us lose our way
Nothing learned by our own mistakes... now it's too late
When promise has withered inside, there is no future... no better life
With nothing we wither inside... the earth will swallow what's left of us
