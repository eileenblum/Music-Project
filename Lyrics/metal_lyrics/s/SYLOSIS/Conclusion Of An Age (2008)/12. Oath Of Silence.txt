Shamed by the weak and cast down in disgust
A shell of a broken man without trust
Preaching upon open ears of the deaf
Depraved words uttered beneath your cold breathe
Killing what's left of the embers of youth
Scraping and clawing for a whisper of truth
Sewing our mouths shut as nothing escapes
Love and grave is a display of a man you once were

But unlike the hand of Midas
What you touch with turn to shit
Blood will flow between us
And the ground will shake until you repent your sins

The touch of cold skin and the embrace of life
In darkness dwells secrets in a holy disguise
Nothing will soothe you, old hands will turn numb
Silence will not speak

But unlike the hand of Midas
What you touch will turn to shit
Burn this fucking saviour
Until you see the damage you cause

Faces mean nothing when nothing is left
Lust will now turn you from reason to rape
Falling from grace is the beckoning sin
Sharing the pain is a means to an end

Is this your saving grace
Just leave our sins to pass away
