Hordes thrown into chaos with nowhere to be safe
You'll push aside your fellow man in hope of your escape
There is no light to see beyond the blackest skyline
First the sound approaches, then the lightning strikes
Lie to yourself to mask the fears of the unknown
Punish yourself until you've nowhere to call home
Ans somewhere inside lies a shadow of the creature you hide
The end is now progress, a fatal last mistake
You left behind your fellow man and now have no escape
There is no light to see beyond the blackest skyline
First the sound approaches, then the lightning strikes
Lie to yourself and never see the thing you are
Punish yourself until your failure is a scar
And somewhere inside lies the creature you hide
Destroying yourselves to purify
To rebuild we must first destroy
Now the earth has no foundation
Bodies tumble into the black abyss
They hear the sound of wings
Teeth are gnashing... God?
There is no light to see beyond the blackest skyline
Foundations shake beneath the shallows
As the Gods rain down on us
And somewhere inside lies a shadow of the creature you hide
Destroying yourselves to purify
