Fall from the darkness
and swallow a choking breath
winds howl and scream
and tear the scorched earth
Scatter the ashes
lower the casket
forever in turmoil
buried beneath the broken soil

Cast me into desolation
I'll find my path again
torn into pieces
yet each step guides me back
the fires are built
and promise a change that will be repaid
there was no mercy for you or I
so the earth will be set ablaze

Blood for blood
surrender or don't
but forgiveness is a lie to behold

Submission
relinquish all your fears and give in
the pain floods in as you inhale
Submission
relinquish all your hurt
and begin to denounce this cruel world

When the sound of the burning fires awake you
stir and come to
smoke fills the sky and clouds
and coves the frozen moon
sever the growing distance between us
and guide me to align
worlds apart yet I fell the pulse
like a severed vein

blood for blood
surrender or don't
but forgiveness is a myth to behold

No atonement
or sins to be absolved
There is no redemption
within this life
