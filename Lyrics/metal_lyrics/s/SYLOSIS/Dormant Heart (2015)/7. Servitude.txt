Chains break yet the line
Pushes onwards
Dust in the cogs has no effect or
Purpose
What little remorse we have suffers,
Depletes
To weak to know who you are

Resounding cries
And I fear this wretch is whole

Day breaks yet the sunâs dissipated
Iron manacles rattle the cages
Debt paid in full to the lords
The fiends, the foes, the dogs
They know who you are

Resounding cries
And I fear this wretch is whole

Inhaling its own tail
The cycle repeats

They want to see people burn
And watch their faces turn
Inflicting their pain upon
Everyone that breathes
Under the sun

Days blur into one
When the curtain drops
To obscure
The end to the hell thatâs begun
