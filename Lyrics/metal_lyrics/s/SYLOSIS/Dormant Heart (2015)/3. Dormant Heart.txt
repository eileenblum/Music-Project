Burst out of negation and discern
Enough to see your halo fall
To silence your words
To strangle your breath
To bring an end to it all
Hidden in the shadows
Dormant hearts now beating
Crept into the light
Tell the hangman the guilty have arrived

A kingdom so perfectly wretched
I hope their hands cling to your soul

The moon beheld the flames
Yet the scorched skies bore no change
The sound of the funeral bell now rings

Beyond the horizon
Hands of stone claw at the throat
Constricting life
Butting heads
Ushering an eon
Omens cast out in place of wisdom
Open minds must choose a side
Tell the hangman I have arrived

A kingdom so perfectly wretched
I hope their hands cling to your soul

Awaken and remove the veil

The dust wont settle
So keep pushing on
Pray for your soul to keep
For in hell youâll have no prayers to reap

By breaking the silence we give in to them, to them
Like lambs to the slaughter unaware
Walking into the eye of the storm

And when the worldâs asleep
Point the finger at me
Unleash the dogs and set them astray
To ensure your safety
But for now we have won
But at what cost
But at what cost
We are lost
