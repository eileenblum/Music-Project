I walk out blindly
On the frozen sea
Where the light has failed

Clutch to beams
That sting to touch
Where the lies took you

Maybe moths need a path
Maybe the flames are all they have

Failed to rescue
Damaged wings
It's the same old sin
To repeat
Failed to rescue
I can see
That a line is drawn
At our feet

Burrowed beneath
Fill our dark hole, making leaves
Clutch the roots, and sleep
Crawl into the Earth,
To the land where the light has failed

Maybe moths need a path
Maybe the flames are all they have
Don't want to see you belie

Failed to rescue
Damaged wings
It's the same old sin
To repeat
Failed to rescue
I can see
That a line is drawn
At our feet

Is this is how you repay me?
You kept me whole
Then silenced my thoughts

How can I repay you?
A canopy of horror drowned in this sorrow

And if you cross my mind again,
I'll curse you out
Enveloping you, a swarm
And you die alone
