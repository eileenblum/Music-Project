Remove your crown
Self appointed king
Master of deceit
Dragged bodies through
The streets
Stones to throw
Heavy cross to bear
Face behind a mask
Facing a silent collapse

Oh preacher
Tell your flock they
Donât stand tall
The higher the structure
You build
The further it falls

Concealed poison on lips
Of lovers
Theyâll bring us to our knees
Shake the earth eternally
Condemn the broken
Accept the weak
Now whose turn is it to turn
The other cheek

Oh preacher
Tell your flock they donât stand
Tall
The higher the structure
You build
The further it falls

If ever you need light
Step into the dark and
Look behind

Oh preacher
Tell your flock they
Shall not fall
Turn away
Hide your face
Hide your face so they canât
See past your lying eyes

Oh preacher
Tell your flock they
Donât stand tall
The higher the structure
You build
The further it falls
