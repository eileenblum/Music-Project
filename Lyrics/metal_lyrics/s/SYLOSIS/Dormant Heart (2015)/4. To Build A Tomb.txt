Watch as the banks break
Flooding the land into
The earthâs heart
Fear creeps in
The stones are set with
Blood and lust

And the shadows bring what
Your despise
They move like snakes entwining
Ulcers within

War of words
Spoken in handshakes
Behind locked doors
Tongues that twist and bend
Dragging us all to our end

And the skies turn black
And the poison seeds donât grow
With riches they line
Their pockets
Yet unpick the seams again

Brick by brick
Youâre closing yourself in
To build upon blood and sand
Is to build a tomb

The candles burn
The snake has spoken
Watch as they rise through
The cracks
Eyes widen as the iris turns black

Face the beckoning
The winds of change are a myth
The meek shall inherit the earth
When their bodies are set adrift

Sever the roots
That run deep and feed
Crown of thorns for
Your majesty
Failed
Mortal
Thwarted
King

To build on blood and sand
Is to build a tomb
