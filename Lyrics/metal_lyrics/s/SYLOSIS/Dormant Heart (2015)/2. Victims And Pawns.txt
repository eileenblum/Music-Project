Poisonous minds corrupt
Those within reach
Innocent souls moulded by complete
Misery
I am alone
Watching it all unfold
An absence of faith yet I canât
Remove these shackles from
My throat

They will creep into
Your thoughts
Deconstruct your moral code
They will bend and they will break
Every law to feed their cause
Bleeding you dry leaving
Nothing behind
So they can march to the
Dying heartbeat

Cowards and fiends align
Reshaped, transmogrified
Noose tied
Bound hands and feet
Coveted eyes to ultimately deceive
Iâm coming undone
Splitting at the seems
The blindfold so tight
Around your ears
It drowns out a
Thousand fucking screams

They will creep into
Your thoughts
Rip apart your values
Offering the sacrificial lamb
To appease your fellow man

How many times can you
Take the strain
Return to your feet
Endure it all again
Blessed with the honesty
Of a thief
Iâm waiting
How many times can you
Lie through your teeth
To be human is to sin
And in death is honour
For all men

Closed eyes see past the
Misguiding light
Take a breath to absorb
The darkness in life

Pulling in two directions
Two minds yield unto corruption
How many times can you
Take the strain
Return to your feet
Endure it all again
Blessed with the honesty
Of a thief
Iâm waiting
How many times can you
Lie through your teeth
To be human is to sin
And in death is honour
For no man
