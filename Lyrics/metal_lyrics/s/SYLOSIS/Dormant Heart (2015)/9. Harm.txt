Endure the paths unaligned
Idle hands create idols
And shrines
The devil makes use of those
Who squander their time

Keep your enemies close
Surrounded by sinners
And ghosts
Eyes to the ground
Whispers arise from the heart
Of the hive

The heart of darkness
Bleeds only for one
And for one it serves
It burns black coal
Through veins
The flesh
The bone

By raising your voice
You will invite death
Stay close to the swarm
And you will come to no harm
By raising your voice
You will give us away
Stay close to the swarm
And you will come to no harm

Forgotten yet ostracised
Moving beneath
The darkest of skies
Riding the mist concealed
Hidden in plain sight

Keep your enemies close
Surrounded by sinners
And ghosts
Eyes to the ground
Whispers arise from the heart
Of the hive

The heart of darkness
Bleeds only for one
And for one it serves
It burns black coal
Through veins
The flesh
The bone

By raising your voice
You will invite death
Stay close to the swarm
And you will come to no harm
By raising your voice
You will give us away
Stay close to the swarm
And you will come to no harm

Deafened by the sirens
And wounded souls

Bound down
They hear the voices
They will drown out
All remnants of us
Bound down
They hear the voices
They will drown out
All remnants of us

How can you feel safe out here

By raising your voice
You will invite death
Stay close to the swarm
And you will come to no harm
By raising your voice
You will give us away
Stay close to the swarm
And you will come to no harm
