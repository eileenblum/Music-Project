Faint shadows emerge
Restricting and contorting
Controlling from behind
The veil of the usurper
Praying for the weak
Preying on the innocent
Prophets and idols replacing men
Isolate the infection before
It spreads

Born on our own
Severing the ancestry
Die on our own
Defeat the bloodline

Born without direction
Born without prejudice
Pulled into line
Forever enslaved
Corrupted
Mistrusted
Erect the gallows
Upon the pentagram
And let the bastards hang
And tradition can die with them

Born on our own
Severing the ancestry
Die on our own
Defeat the bloodline

Let the bastards hang and
Tradition can die with them

Outstretch your palms
To receive your communion of lies
Fall to your knees and repent

Your failure we claim as ours
Ruler in the sky
Strike down with
Arrows unbound
Youâve made your altar so
Bow down

Stains of dissolution
The blind follow the mislead
To gallows then graves
In sickness and death

Augment this world of lies
Everything is a choice
And not a birthright
