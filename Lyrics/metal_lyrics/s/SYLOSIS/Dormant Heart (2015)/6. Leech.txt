Acid slaver burns through bone
Dissected and reanimated
Lips are sewn
Stitched to mute the outcome
Block the exit wounds

See through the face of degradation
Beyond what hides on the surface
Numb the ache
Dull the light and sound
Itâs dragging me down

This isnât war
For this is silent
Your pointe teeth
Left leeches marks in me
And I can feel it burning
Forever under my skin

Dissected into a thousand pieces
Corroding from the inside
Piercing the flesh
And burrowed deep
A host forever asleep

See through the face of degradation
Beyond what hides on the surface
Numb the ache
Dull the light and sound
Itâs dragging me down

This isnât war
For this is silent
Your pointe teeth
Left leeches marks in me
And I can feel it burning
Forever under my skin

The remnants of your soul depart

The cold frost of winter soothes the sting
Forever the leech is king
