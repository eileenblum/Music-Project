Have you ever felt that pain?
Kissesâ gentle violence?
Bursting out of shameâ¦
Oh dear! My will disappears
In mist that I surrender toâ¦

I canât forget what I have tasted,
With no regrets for what weâve made.
That kiss was more than Iâd expected,
That secret lore is now observed.
Der Aphel aus Goldâ¦

Will God forsake? No need to scold.
It was mistake. It has been told.
Who loved he knows what does it cost,
What is the pain, what is the loss.
Der Aphel aus Goldâ¦

With constellations blinded eyes,
I stare into the skies at nights,
I pray the Tyrant - no one hearsâ¦
Iâve paid too much for what we didâ¦

Drowning in the night with you, dreaming to fly with you.
Drowning in the night to fly in dreams.

What once was sweet has bitter taste,
Its nasty sense - it still elates.
I isolate myself in wold.
In haste to live my soul was sold.
Der Aphel aus Goldâ¦
