Raked out from the snow that day
The girl that was missing on the eve of that day.
Perfectly frozen her body was laid,
Itâs seemed like the death's saved her beauty that day.

Sheâs learned to love to hate â
Everything dies, passes away.

Withered beauty, crystallized eyes are covered with snow,
Frozen from inside - no sign of life.

Her inner pain,
Her hurted soul,
Her wasted time
For the life she doesnât know!

I grieve for the things
That were lost being loved.
Will the hate help me to
Strike them out of my heart?

Her roomâs left in a state as she just has been gone.
Diary left on her bed is alone:
âI feel the shame not for the wrong things Iâve done,
But for the right things that should have been doneâ.

And you will taste the life â
Only at a time itâs fading away.

Standing on edge, crossing the line, the one fleeting thought
Changes your mind, rescues your life.

Her misty life,
Was ended up
When her will to live
Was strong enough butâ¦

I think this day
I did not commit suicide
Is more epochal than
my birthday in my life.

Her feet slipped off the cliff,
When sheâs turned to go.
Whirling in the deadly spin
She fell in the hugs of snow.
