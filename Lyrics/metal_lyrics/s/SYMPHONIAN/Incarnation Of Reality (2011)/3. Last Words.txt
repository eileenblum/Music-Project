I feel the emptiness that never leaves me
Unless I hear weird chants in my mind,
Thy calming words that I believe in.
I am obeyed by voice that sings.

Waking up from hollow dream,
What you see?
Shattered mind without a thought.
Seek after meâ¦

Living in a delusive realm,
All youâve seen
Had been told you by that voice
In your dreamsâ¦

Nothing but hope keeps me alive,
Soothing my agony that I canât survive.
Desperate cry is wondering darkness,
Everything is empty inside.

I see the light is fading in shadow.
Covered with lies is the shine of my heart.
In place, where the feelings are dead, there is nothing to wait,
When cold darkness embraced my life in thy grace.

That night I looked outside from my window
and Iâd seen the huge raindrops were falling down from the black clouds.
I realized how much I missed youâ¦

A sudden shadow passed near by me,
and finally I realized
I would have never been so close to you again!
Iâll be with you ... again!

Weary soul is lost,
âCause you have gone.
Itâs an emptiness
And everythingâs forgotten.

My heart was ruined,
My faith was ruined,
I canât believe thisâ¦ oh!
I can believe this notâ¦
