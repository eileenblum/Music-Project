I spent my whole life on seeking for your soul.
And once like a sunbeam through the mist of my dream
Youâve come to me.

I dwell on the verge
Of both worlds and cry
The same way as you,
My grief is the light.

Your soul Â³n darkness and sadness awaits.
While I'm trying to solve this quest of death, life and faith.

From reign of the darkness,
Lend wings me to fly.
At dawn I go down
At dusk I revive.

â Ascetic life I choose. Death is the only truth! I wish youâre aliveâ¦
â Just follow my lightâ¦

â Why do you have to go? Still I donât know. Donât put me aside!
â Iâm pure as a light.

â Don't run away! It's not a game to play! Please, stay in my sight!
â Forgive me, my Light!

â Show me the path, my soul never rests enlightening my mind.
â Go onward my lightâ¦

I had explored the secret depths of divine science,
My eyes have seen the sharpest verges of both worlds.
Approaching the mysteries of skies Iâm always trying
To reach the furthest point on a path of a soulâ¦
