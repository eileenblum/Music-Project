"This is not meant to bring you joy. This is not meant to give you any solace. This is the cold, ugly truth of what happens when we put off our rose-tinted glasses, or when they are violently ripped off our noses. May you find peace with this state of mind one day. May you embrace this pain and allow it to make you stronger. May this teach you how to turn this poison into an antidote."

Cold cuts through my fingers
As I drag them over the surface
Punish them as I
Disturb the still waters
With one light touch I
Wrinkle all existence
Distort all future
Destroy all quiet
Send waves of confusion
Through these waters
Of life
Even the gentlest stroke
Causes harm
There's thunder afar
What have I become
