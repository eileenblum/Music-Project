Thoroughly cleansing nights
Poisoning souls
Daft in ashes, scorn
The airy eventful
In trance delusions of
Forgotten promises
Alone, the unknown
Or drawn in solitary tombs

He has gathered enough knowledge
To cope with the pain
To understand all the nightmares
He is cherishing
And even if he
He will drown
In this sea of suffering
He will know that it hasn't been all in vain

Truly, emerges one with the sea
On tidal waves of grief
And the shore
His dreams will wait for him
To embrace
To despair
And only then
Then he will know
That he had lost
All his pain
All dreams
The naked grief
