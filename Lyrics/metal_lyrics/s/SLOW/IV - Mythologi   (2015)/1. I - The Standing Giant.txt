Infinite skies
Blue, grey, green, dark
Colouring the auroras
A gift from Her, again

Gaze upon the colossus
A giant wearing the Earth
As GaÃ¯a left him alone
He glances, still

Thoughts and sorrows embalmed his mind
One purpose, one lost battle
But he stands proud, chained
Used to his eternal fatigue

And he stands
And he wears
And he stands
And he wears
