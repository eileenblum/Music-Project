Father - Grant me not warning
Father - We could fly away
From feathers of the greatest bird
From wax of the brightest candle

Oh Sun! Everlasting shining star
Why did you betray me
Oh Sun! Oh I wish the clouds were mine
I wish we'd never met

My time is done
And I keep on falling
My time is done
And I fall again
