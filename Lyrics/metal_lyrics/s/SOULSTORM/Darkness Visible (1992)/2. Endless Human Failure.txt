Blind painting walls white
Refuse deny the hurt inside
Reveal exposing inner self
Caught up in this grind

Weak so eager to play
Waste now left to contradict
Endless constant sickening greed
So material acquire every want

I see the weak
Futile attempts
Resisting within
Deny the hurt

Create building fears of weakness
Close shut the mind to recrimination
Realize cornered into hopelessness
Force learn to walk on paint

Drown in warped repressions
Strain becomes unbearable
Nothing left but weakness
Condemned to struggle helplessly
