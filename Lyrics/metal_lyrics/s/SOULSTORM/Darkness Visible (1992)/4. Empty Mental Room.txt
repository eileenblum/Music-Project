Hiding inside
Behind strained walls
Faceless life
Control is now gone

Your world turns gray

Faceless
I have become
Faceless
Your control is gone
Frozen body lifeless
Hopeless
Your hopes are gone

Your world turns black

Faceless
You have become
Hopeless
All your hope is gone

Lifeblood will drain
Stripping away my soul

Your world is dead

Faceless
All has become
Hopeless
