Penetrate this barricade
Caustic feelings dissipate
Smothered by the burning
All compassion drains

Crawling is unforgettable
Humiliate my sympathy
Crawling is unforgettable
(The) need to escape
So painfully aware
Crawling is unbearable
Recede into fragility
Damage becomes irreparable
Need to escape
&gt;From this stranglehold

Reveal the pain of damaged walls
Once so secure now let me fall

Crawling is unforgivable
Reinforce my humanity
Crawling is unforgivable
Inner wounds now bleed
