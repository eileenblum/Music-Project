Breathe you in (and) suffocate

Regression comes easily
Feelings torn indifferently
Taken with calm hopelessness
And images of burning

Swallowed by depression
Memories remain clear
Lost within the suffering
Numbed by perfect gain

You can't breathe... suffocate

Through fire walk with me
The burning is impossible
Recollection brings misery
Confusion breeds fear

Separation becomes painful
Anxieties have manifest
Emotions become dispensable
Weakness brings me back
Again
