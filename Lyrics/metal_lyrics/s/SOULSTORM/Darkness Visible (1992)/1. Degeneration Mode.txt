Phobocide of a fragile mind
Unable to deal with strife
Submission to hopelessness
Questioning where it all went wrong

Over the years degenerate
Fall deep into absorbing pain

So much damage has been done
Long for understanding

(With) intimidation the past reveals
The fragmentation of forgotten wounds
Resentments never heal
So much trust misplaced in you

Submerged in black pain

And now we come full circle
Seething with contempt
Coarsened by fear
Undercurrent draws out
Containment breeds this behaviour
Penetrating consciousness
Relapse into primitive
Callous actions no regrets

So much damage done
Understanding never comes
