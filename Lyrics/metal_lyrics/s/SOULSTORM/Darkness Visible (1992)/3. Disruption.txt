Tearing within
Suffocating bloodspill
Hurts to be like this
To be caught in between
Feeling like emptiness
(A) darkening inside
Shattered by indifference
Nothing left to hold

Questioning this barricade
Holding back the reason
Solitude is threatening
Time to face the truth
Scrape up what is left
Desensitized within
Hopelessness remains inside
Damage beyond repair

Feeling within
The leaving within, (now) bleeding again
Feeling the emptiness
Darkening inside
Shattered by indifference
Covered with scars
Emasculated by circumstance
Glorify the degradation
Sick of suffering
Damaged but not to care
