Fear (of) the insecure
Threatening to stop
Disillusioned
Too easy to crush
All colors fade (away)
Helpless in this broken thought
Can't get enough
Dependence now controls

Suffocate
The crash will involve
One who has been crushed
Helpless in broken thought
Incapable of trust
Escape to habit
Running doesn't solve
Can't get enough
The pain begs for more

Now as if not there
Agreement has dissolved
Too east to crush
Dependence now controls
