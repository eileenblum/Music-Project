it seems like we're all being swept under one big carpet an embarrassing secret that they hide from. we wonder about impoverished areas and cannot understand the anger, frustration and hopelessness. the needs of these communities are ignored as we sit barricaded in our homes hoping not to be the next target of unfocused rage. i don't have any solutions to the problems but maybe that's the issue: what if we all got together and took control of our lives and our communities?
