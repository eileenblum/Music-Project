we have overstepped our boundaries. we poison each other and the very earth we walk upon. victimizers of the innocent impose misery on non-humyn beings. but our selfishness will return, our legacy will come to an end, our greed will fuck us all and proper balance will be restored. the earth is not ours, we are of the earth.
