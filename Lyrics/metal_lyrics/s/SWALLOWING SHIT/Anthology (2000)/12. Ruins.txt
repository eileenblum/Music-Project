rotting hatred in the face of progress. your remains ember but do not die. your ugliness, your decaying traditions. it's a waste of existence that you cling to. your ugliness, your decaying traditions. it's a waste of existence that you cling to. an oppressive dominating value system that fucks us all into submission. we condemn. we suppress. institutionalized hatred of womankind, our language, our culture, our media, ourselves.
