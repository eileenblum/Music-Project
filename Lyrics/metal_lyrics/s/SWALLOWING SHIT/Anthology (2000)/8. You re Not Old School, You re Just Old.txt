capitalism has created class division for a very important reason: the privileged white race (yes, you) will always benefit from racial oppression for as long as injustice exists. you have opportunity and i do not and i feel stuck somewhere between two cultures, aware of mine, a participant of yours. the existing establishment must be removed by force. we cannot co-exist while our brothers and sisters suffer under a bloodthirsty system driving a stake through our dreams.
