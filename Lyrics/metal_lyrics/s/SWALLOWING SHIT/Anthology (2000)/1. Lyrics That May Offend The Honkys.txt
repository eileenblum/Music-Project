bloodthirsty thugs trained to serve the rich protected by gun and badge, and a racist culture of poverty maintained by intimidation and force. we are not disadvantaged. we are targeted for destruction. violence and theft is the result of a system which steals from the poor, non-hetero, non-white and anybody else who threatens the rich. community policing is a fucking lie.
