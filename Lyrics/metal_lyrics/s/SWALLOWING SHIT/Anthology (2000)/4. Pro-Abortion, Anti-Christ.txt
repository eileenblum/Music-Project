reproductive freedom: a womyn's right a) to live free from the threat of sexual harassment or violence, b) to obtain safe and effective contraception, c) to unrestricted access to abortion. pro-choice poses a threat to the state because it places power and dignity back into the hands of womyn. wimmin must be free from oppression based on sex, race, class, sexual orientation and/or physical ability which means: abortion without apology! the religious right must be crushed and every law governing the right to choose must be repealed now.
