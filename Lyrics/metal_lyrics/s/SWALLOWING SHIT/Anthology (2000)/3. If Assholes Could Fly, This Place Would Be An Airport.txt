we greeted you with smiles, you greeted us with lies. we agreed to learn your tongue, you took more, you took our voice. we shared with you this land, you took more than you needed. you shared with us your way of life, and robbed us of ours. whose delusions brought us this madness? whose voice unleashed the rifles and gas? do n't tell me that time heals all wounds.
