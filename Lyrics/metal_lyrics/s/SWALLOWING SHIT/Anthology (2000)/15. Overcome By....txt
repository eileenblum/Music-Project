from high on the godly throne of your conservative morality, your truth is waived in front of me. you shake your righteous head and centuries of intolerance continue as we pave your streets of gold. but don't you feel just a little to blame? to reverse and to remove you. to force you to feel what you never have. to change your fearful ways. to open your eyes to what you've caused. the effigy of your savior, the murderer of this land: i reject what i've been told. your truth cannot save me. fuck your god, set mine free.
