North against South
Between magnetic fields
In bipolar disorder is a figurine misplaced
I am Faithless I am No-One
With no soul belonging nowhere
I'm just longing to stay right here
I am Atheist
I am None

The world seems like an overflowing hour glass
With nothing to drink from but the sand of time

BEYOND ALL FEAR
BEYOND ALL FEAR
NOMAD ON NO MAN'S LAND

NOMAD ON NO MAN'S LAND

Everywhere it's the same old song
Kaikkialla soi sama virsi
Is there a cure for this disease
Onko lÃ¤Ã¤kettÃ¤ tuohon tautiin
The answer is clear
Vastaus on ilmiselvÃ¤
Time is the antibiodic of death
Aika on kuoleman antibiootti

BEYOND ALL FEAR
BEYOND ALL FEAR
NOMAD ON NO MAN'S LAND

NOMAD ON NO MAN'S LAND

Me against myself
Between magnetic fields
In bipolar disorder
I'm a figurine misplaced
