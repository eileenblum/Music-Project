Cutting or scratching, they scar the same
The angle is off, the edges are soft, the mark remains
I know I'm bitter and full of rage
You would be too, what I've been through
Knowledge is a difficult age

So decide
Tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide
Tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see...
Not long for this world!

Carving or biting, we bleed for keeps
Out of control, into the cold, hell repeats
God, I'm starving, spreading me thin
Buying a story, my soul is for sale
Trust is such an arrogant thing

So decide
Tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide
Tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see...
Not long for this world!
Not long for this world!

I KNOW THE SHIT YOU EAT
There's nothing mellow in the
DRAMA YOU LIVE AND BREATHE
You like your secrets to be
KEPT IN THE FAMILY
You don't get credit for your
RARE GOOD BEHAVIOR, GO BE A SAVIOR
You don't seem to get what I'm saying...
And I'm sick and tired of explaining!
GOODNIGHT, GOODBYE, GOOD LUCK
There's nothing worse than a
GHOUL MANIFESTO, I'M NOT IMPRESSED THOUGH

The greatest conclusion that I ever had
Was when I woke up and said, "That's enough!"
Living never felt so bad
You don't accept it, and I don't care
Bury yourself above all your guilt
When you're ready it'll be there

So decide
Tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide
Tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see...
Not long for this world!
Not long for this world!
Not long for this world!

I was not long for this world...
I was not long for this world...

I was not long for this world!
I was not long for this world!
I was not long for this world!
I was not long for this world!
