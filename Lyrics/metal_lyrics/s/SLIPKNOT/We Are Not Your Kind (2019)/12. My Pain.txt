Pain
She loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free to feel all of my pain

I'm your friend
And I'm your shade
Do what you want
Just remember it's for love

I'm your wall
And I'm your rock
Don't run away
Don't forget it's only love

I'm your chain
And I'm your lock
There's no escape
Just as long as I say... love

I'm your death
And I'm your cold
You end with me
Remember: this was never love
(Love, love, love, love)

I'll take this
(Love, love, love, love)
And I'll take that
(Love, love, love, love)
I'll take you too
(Love, love, love)
You can never give too much

Pain
She loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free
Pain

Pain
She loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free to feel all of my pain

I've always felt love this way for you
