I wept! When I realized
There were no more demons left to conquer
An opportunity to show my feelings
With skin so thick you'd swear it was armor
A penitentiary that only lets the oxygen out
I wasn't ready for a version of the truth to get out
I'm getting desperate, I wouldn't want to fester
In another bad dream, I am a man of extremes

I found the flesh and I'm liking it
I'll put an end to all your fucking psychobabble
We eat the meat 'cause the meat had a soul
We take their lives 'cause to hurt makes us whole

I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story, take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan, the one who kills your world

Keeping up appearances with acts of attrition
It doesn't matter 'cause I know you'll never listen
Before, you knew it when you saw it
Now you say you never knew it, it was all a big conspiracy
We come together when the hands of pain let go
Is there anybody left to fill this hole?
This shit will never wash off
Give yourself a medal, I swear I fucking give up

We're nothing special, just an accidental tweak of the freak
An evolution of the kennel in the fetish you seek
There's still the part of me that's dying in a dumpster
The one who rose is a motherfucking monster

I've seen the future, and it's simply burning!
I wasn't put here to be so discerning!
You want the world to be dissatisfied?!
You don't care, so why the fuck should I?
Fuck, should I sell myself to stay alive?

I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story, take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan, the one who kills...
The one who kills your world!

Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything

Tell me all about it
I'd love to hear it
The way I ruin everything I touch
I never thought I'd get to say I'm sorry
But then again I think you ask too much

Too white 2B black
Too black 2B blue
Too sick 2B me
Too fucked 2B you
I only wonder if I'll live to see the end of the road
It always gets me nowhere

I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story, take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan, the one who kills your world

Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
I am the orphan, the one who kills...
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
I am the orphan, the one who kills...

Yeah-hahahaha...
