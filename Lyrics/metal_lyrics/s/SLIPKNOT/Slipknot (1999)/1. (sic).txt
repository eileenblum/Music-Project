Enemy - Show me what you wanna be 
I can handle anything 
Even if I can't handle you 
Readily - Either way it better be 
Don't you fuckin' pity me 
Get up, get off... 
What the hell am I sayin'? 
I don't know about malevolent 
Sure as hell decadent 
I want somebody to step up, step off 
Walls! Let me fall! Fuck you all! 
Get a grip, don't let me slip 'til I drop the ball 

I - I want it all! 
Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it 
You're goin' down, this is a war! 

Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind? 
You're leavin' me suspect, I'm leavin' you grotesque 
Feels like a burn from which you never learn 
Cause and effect, you jealous ass 
Press your face against the glass - suffer 

I want it all! 
Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it 
You're goin' down, this is a war! 
I've just begun 
It's about that time 
Gotta get mine 

You can't kill me 
Cuz I'm already inside you 

Sick
