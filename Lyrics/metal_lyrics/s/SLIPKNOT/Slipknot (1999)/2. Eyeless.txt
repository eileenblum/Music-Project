Insane - Am I the only muthafucker with a brain? 
I'm hearing voices but all they do is complain 
How many times have you wanted to kill 
Everything and everyone - Say you'll do it but never will 

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 

I am my Father's son 
He's a phantom, a mystery and that leaves me 
Nothing! 
How many times have you wanted to die? 
It's too late for me. All you have to do is get rid of me! 

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 

It's all in your head 
It's all in my head 
It's all in your head 

I tried - You lied to me for so long 
Everywhere I go, there's a sense of it 
Freak on my antics and give me a choice 
Doesn't matter if I give a shit 
It's shit that you gave me 

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 

It's all in your head 
It's all in my head 
It's all in your head 

Do you wanna feel pain? Takin' my name in vain 
Caring never felt so lame inside 
Anybody else got pride? Do you wanna take my life? 
Maybe I'll reverse my ride 
Who the hell are you? Fuck you! 
Better suck it up cuz you bled through 
Better get away from me 
Stay the fuck away from me! 

I feel safe - Seems your saved 

Look me in my brand new eye
