[Special Edition bonus track]

My friends are all hurting from moments and regrets and charity laced with a lie
And still we keep hoping, to fix all the defects and strengthen these seminal ties
We go on together for better or worse, our history is to real to hate
Now and forever we stay until morning, and promise to fight for our fate

'Til we die
'Til we die

The start of the journey is every bit worth it, I can let you down anymore
The sky is still clearing, we're never afraid and the consequence opens the door
I've never stopped trying, I've never stopped feeling like family is much more than blood
Don't go on without me, the piece that I represent complements each and every one

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've acheived has allowed us to win

'Til we die
'Til we die

My last true confession will open your eyes, I've never know trust like the nine
Let it be spoken, let it be screamed, they'll never ever take us alive

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've acheived has allowed us to win

Carry on
Carry on

We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to deny
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to deny

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've acheived has allowed us to win

Carry on
Carry on

We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to deny

'Til we die
'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've acheived has allowed us to win
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to deny
