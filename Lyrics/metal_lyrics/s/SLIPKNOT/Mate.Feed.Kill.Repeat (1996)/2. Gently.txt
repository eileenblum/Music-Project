Gently my mind escapes into the relaxing mode of pleasure
A pleasure that will take my mind off the reality of my life
My past life
Life as I know it now
And whatever may come it slowly disappears
to somewhere in the back of my mind
It will remain there 'til I wish to retrieve it

Yes I will stay here for awhile for I need the break
A break from the prisons of life
and everything that lay in the palm of life's hands, life's hands

This moment's incredible
It's out of this world
Too bad I must always leave it
But that's life

That's life
THAT'S LIFE
THAT'S LIFE
THAT'S LIFE
THAT'S LIFE!
