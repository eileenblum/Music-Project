[Lyrics differ from the same-titled song off of the album "Slipknot" (1999)]

Pain - Made to order
Pain - Made to order
Pain - Made to order
Pain

Slippin', slappin', scattin' on my back
Tryin' to relax
Thinkin' about the facts of the cracks runnin'
Through the pack
Division of thought about the
War to be fought
For tryin' to mend the ranks
Still I get no thanks

They say they mean no disrespect
But dis is in effect
I take to heart the part
I play every day
Uniformed is one thing
Stupid is another
Keep runnin' your mouth but
Don't call me brother

But I'm tryin' to find someone
On my side
Cuz bangin' heads all the time starts to grind
At my gear and at my will
But persistent I am still so when
One insubordinate fucker tries to test me

Blow to the head
An entrail rend
Guts on the floor
But you want more
Shows you the strength
Of the tenth rank
Pain's the only way to
Teach kids these days

Opened your eyes
You've realized
Talk back to me
Your punk-ass dies!

Only one of us walks away! [x4]

I'm all you'll know
Where will you go
Valhalla's gone
With your soul

Only one of us walks away! [x2]
Only one of us walks away! (Walks the fuck away!) [x2]
