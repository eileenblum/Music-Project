[differs from 1999 version]

(Tattered and torn)
That's where my soul is worn
(Tattered and torn)
That's when i was born
(Tattered and torn)
I broke away from me
(Tattered and torn)
I knocked me to my knees

(Tattered and torn)
I drink my own cells
(Tattered and torn)
A decomposing well
(Tattered and torn)
Roaches in my head
(Tattered and torn)
I become the living dead

Tattered and torn

Tearing myself apart
from the things that make me hurt
