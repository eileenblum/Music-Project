[Corey Taylor whispering]
Talking to myself.. Ahh..

[Incomprehensible]

Gently my mind escapes to a relaxing world of pleasure
A pleasure that'll take my mind off the reality of my life
My past life... Life as I know it now
And whatever may come it slowly disappears
To somewhere in the back of my mind
IT WILL REMAIN THERE - UNTIL I WISH TO RETRIEVE IT

YEAH - YEAH - YEAH - YEAH - YEAH - YEAH

Yes I will stay here for awhile for I need the break
A break from the prisons of life
And everything that lay in the palm of life's hands, life's hands

This moment's incredible
It's out of this world
Too bad I must always leave it
But that's life

THAT'S LIFE (YEAH) THAT'S LIFE (YEAH) THAT'S LIFE (YEAH)

THAT'S LIFE! YES!

YES - YES - YES

AAHH YES!
