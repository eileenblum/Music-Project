Relax... it's over, you belong to me, I fill your mouth with dirt
Relax... it's over, you can never leave
I take your second digit with me... Love...

You are... my first, I can barely breath
I find you fascinating
You are... my favorite, lay you down to sleep
It's all that I can do to stop... Love...

So blue... so broken, paper doll decays
I haven't left you yet
So cold... subversive, your eyes are full of bleach
Tomorrow, I will go away again... Love...

YOU ARE MINE, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MINE, I CAN TEAR YOU APART
I CAN RECOMBINE YOU
ALL I WANT IS TO COVET YOU ALL
YOU BELONG TO ME
I WILL KILL YOU TO LOVE YOU. (LOVE)
