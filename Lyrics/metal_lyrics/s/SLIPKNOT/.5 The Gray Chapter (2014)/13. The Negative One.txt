Fire and Caffeine- a lot of Nicotine- Iâm going to burn so I better tell you everything
The Competition- The Superstition- Never mind âcause youâre never going to give in
Itâs a Crisis, just how you like it- the same drama in a different disguise
Iâm bound to walk with a target on my back- At least Iâm ready for another attack
The Lord Of Lies/The Morning Star/You Had To Be Set Free
Opposing Sides/Your Choices Are/The Negative One and Me

Svengali- why are we the enemies? I never follow and I never make apologies
Your dementias are gonna getcha- because your walls canât support each other
Settle for the Cynical- youâre so political
Youâre getting ready âcause the first move is critical
Reciprocity- somebodyâs listening- what did we learn from our time in captivity?
The Lord Of Lies/The Morning Star/You Had To Be Set Free
Opposing Sides/Your Choices Are/The Negative One and Me
The Negative One and me
I Hope You Live/To See The Day/When Your World Goes Up In Flames
And As You Die/You See My Face/Youâre The Only One To Blame

The Prescient/The Nascent/The Quotient (THEY ALL WILL FALL)
The Cystic/Symbolic/Condition (SYSTEMIC)
Egregious/Replete With/These Lesions (CONTAMINATE)
Succumb To/The Selfish/Creation (YOUR FAILURE)

No Accountability- Divisibility- I point a finger but itâs always looking back at me
The Centipedeâs pulling on the mechanism- Unearthing scars of the cataclysm
When the Innocent- Begin to circumvent- The color fades but the picture is vibrant
What do you believe? Does it matter now? Turn away- The killer is disavowed
The Lord Of Lies/The Morning Star/You Had To Be Set Free
Opposing Sides/Your Choices Are/The Negative One and Me
The Negative One and Me
I Hope You Live/To See The Day/When Your World Goes Up In Flames
And As You Die/You See My Face/Youâre The Only One To Blame
The Lord Of Lies/The Morning Star/You Had To Be Set Free
Opposing Sides/Your Choices Are
The Negative One
The Negative One
The Negative One
The Negative One and Me
