Letâs skip all the histrionics â Not again, not another excuse
The epidemic is codependent â Biting off more than your mouth can chew
Donât forget to convalesce your secrets â I donât want to be a man today
For all you know, Iâm the silver in the bullet
I am the trigger that will make you all obey
Iâm going to make you cry tonight â Iâm going to make you hate me

Inside all my flaws again (I canât let go)
In spite of you, Iâm lost again (I still donât know)
Disguises show me â What am I if I am only?
The status-quo is not a punishmentâ¦but now it feels like home

Your association finds you guilty â Starting with end of the day
Black and white is such a fascist feeling â Right or wrong and nothing to say
The last good bipeds cleaning up the fingerprints â unappreciated medical fiends
Confiscate another classic inbred â Fuck it all â Light the acetylene
No other choice, I canât explain â Life keeps taking things away
Inside all my flaws again (I canât let go)
In spite of you, Iâm lost again (I still donât know)
Disguises show me â What am I if I am only?
The status-quo is not a punishmentâ¦but now it feels like home

The futureâs here, Iâm past my prime
When the evidence came, I committed the crime
Can you stand on your faith with your feet on the bible?
Who could ask for a better disciple?
Whatâs the point? Iâm not sure I can
Iâll never dig another grave, Iâm afraid of what Iâll find
If it hurts, then youâre too old. Iâll take your shit and give you fucking gold
Iâm going to make you cry tonight â I need you to hate me

Inside all my flaws again (I canât let go)
In spite of you, Iâm lost again (I still donât know)
Disguises show me â What am I if I am only?
The status-quo is not a punishmentâ¦
But now it feels like homeâ¦
But now it feels like homeâ¦
