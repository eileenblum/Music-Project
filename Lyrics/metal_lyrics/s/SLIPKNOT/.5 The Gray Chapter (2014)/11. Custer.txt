RISE
Half alive and stark-raving free and maligned for
Encroaching on the purpose of this commercial-free interruptionâ¦
Due to the prolific nature of this statement, listener aggression is advised.

Itâs strange; whenever I see a gun, I think about just how petty you are
And it blows my fucking mind â It blows my fucking mind
These days, I never seem to get enough.
Iâm tired of this â I want to go home
Donât waste my fucking time â Donât waste my fucking time
Because anything exceptional gets crushed by common people
With jealousy and ignorance and all their common evils
This planet isnât special â collections made of clay
Iâm waiting for the punishment I know is on my way

Cut â Cut â Cut me up and Fuck â Fuck â Fuck me up
CUT â CUT â CUT ME UP AND FUCK â FUCK â FUCK ME UP!
Irreverence is my disease â Itâs second hand but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity!

Somewhere on a toilet wall, I read the words
âYou FORM A LINE to FORMALIZE the FORMER LIESâ
And I finally saw the truth
Something so profound and it was sitting there, surrounded by
The garbage and the stains â another victim of the refuse
Now Iâve been saying this for years but you donât comprehend it
I fight hell and I fight fear because I understand it
Androgyny and insults â You try so hard to be difficult
You want to win the war? Know what youâre fighting for!

Cut â Cut â Cut me up and Fuck â Fuck â Fuck me up
CUT â CUT â CUT ME UP AND FUCK â FUCK â FUCK ME UP!
Irreverence is my disease â Itâs second hand but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity!
With angel eyes and demon seeds â Youâre missing what you really need
When all is said and done, you see
The last man standing gets no pity!

Cut â Cut â Cut me up and Fuck â Fuck â Fuck me up
CUT â CUT â CUT ME UP AND FUCK â FUCK â FUCK ME UP!
