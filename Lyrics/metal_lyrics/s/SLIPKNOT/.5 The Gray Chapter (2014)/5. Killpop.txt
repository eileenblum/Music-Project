Sheâs sticking needles in her skin
I turn with an ugly grin
Her canvas doesnât leave a lot, to fantasy
But her piece of mind canât stay inside the lines
Itâs so confusing, the methods that sheâs using
She knows she shouldnât leave a mark that I can see
Will she ever find one million of kind?
Itâs cold and lonely, but thatâs because she told me
Lost inside her dirty world, no one hurts this pretty girl but her

Oh, sheâs beautiful
A little better than a man deserves
Oh, Iâm not insane
Please tell me she wonât changeâ¦

MAYBE I SHOULD LET HER GOâ¦BUT ONLY WHEN SHE LOVES ME
HOW CAN I JUST LET HER GO? NOT UNTIL SHE LOVES ME

Sheâs drowning in herself again. My God, what a lovely sinâ¦
I guess thereâs nothing left to do, but have my way
She can feel itâs right so she doesnât close her eyes
She smiles and answers â it doesnât seem to matter.
Lost inside my dirty head, something tells me Iâm the one whoâs kept.

Oh, so volatile
A little better than a man defiled.
Oh, I need the pain
Please tell me she wonât changeâ¦

MAYBE I SHOULD LET HER GOâ¦BUT ONLY WHEN SHE LOVES ME
HOW CAN I JUST LET HER GO? NOT UNTIL SHE LOVES ME

We were meant to be together. Now die and fucking love me.
We were meant to hurt each other. Now die and fucking love me.
Die and fucking love meâ¦
Die and fucking love meâ¦
Die and fucking love meâ¦
