Itâs been years since anyone could be a friend
Itâs the fear the kills the feeling in the end
Can we face it? Can we shape it? Can we really die?
If rain is what you wantâ¦all you have to do is close your eyes
Just close your eyesâ¦

I am watching resurrection start to crawl
Is there any chance in hell? Any chance at all?
Do we need it? Do we see it? Is it really there?
If rain is what you wantâ¦then take your seats, enjoy the fall
Enjoy the fallâ¦

The only thing deeper than my last breath
The only thing darker than my last death
IS THE PANIC â THE STATIC â IâVE COME BACK FROM THE DEAD
BUT MY CITIESâ¦.WILL NEVER SLEEP AGAIN

In these diamonds, weâre left with colored glass
As pressure take its toll, we learn to last
But you canât break my heart
As long as I can be myself, Iâll never fall apart
And you canât take me in
If Iâm not broken, break me down
So I will never feel alone again

The only thing deeper than my last breath
The only thing darker than my last death
IS THE PANIC â THE STATIC â IâVE COME BACK FROM THE DEAD
BUT MY CITIESâ¦.WILL NEVER SLEEP AGAIN
MY CITIESâ¦.WILL NEVER SLEEP AGAIN
MY CITIESâ¦.WILL NEVER SLEEP AGAIN
MY CITIESâ¦.WILL NEVER SLEEP AGAIN
MY CITIESâ¦.WILL NEVER SLEEP AGAIN
