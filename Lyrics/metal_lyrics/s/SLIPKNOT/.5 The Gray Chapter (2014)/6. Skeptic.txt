Only when the fates â Commiserate - Do we get a little taste as unique
The Libertine â Know what I mean? Hiroshima on a Sunday
You had a gift â You were a gift â But thereâs always a goddamn catch
Blessing and a curse â You made it work â The Universe seems so much smaller
(Legend) Bastard (Best Friend) Why? Why do the limits have to realign?
(Hero) Martyr (Mystery) God â He was the best of us

The world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you

Never be the same â I want the blame â To be assigned to the guiltiest one
It canât be done â Because the son â Was the victim they arrested
Iâm so fuckinâ pissed â At all of this â You got to know that you are sorely missed
Miracles are real. They help you heal. They make you feel like things will get better.
(Father) Brother (Scapegoat) Why? Why did we only get this time?
(Fighter) Icon (Skeptic) God â Stop taking the best of us

I wonât let you disappear. I will keep your soul alive if I canât have you here.
History may have its share of lunatics and starsâ¦
But the world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you
The world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you

SKEPTIC [6x]

Where am I supposed to begin? Iâm killing for the karma again
Feed the meter in the machine â Believing itâs the way to be seen
GONE â Are we alone? GONE â Are we alone?
GONE â Are we alone? GONE â Weâre not alone

I canât let you disappear. I will keep your soul alive if I canât have you here.
We were meant to be Kings.
Rule the masses, run the risks, and keep our systems clean
History may have its share of lunatics and starsâ¦
But the world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you
The world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you
The World â Will never see â Another crazy motherfucker like you
Like you! Like you! Likeâ¦.You
