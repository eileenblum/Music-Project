Come on overâ¦come ungluedâ¦
Itâs not easy to see all of you
Help yourselves. Help is on the way
Well thereâs nothing to lose so now I have something to say
Maybe we can all recognize a moment of silence
Maybe we can all finally agree on the same point of view
A long time ago we believedâ¦and we were united
So the last thing on Earth I am ready to do is sayâ¦
Goodbye

A long time ago we discovered that nothing could stop us
This hasnât torn us apart so nothing ever will
How can we know where we are if the sun is behind us?
But this moment will show us the rest of our lives
No one is going to save us this time
No one can know what weâre feelingâ¦
So donâtâ even try
