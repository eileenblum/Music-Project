Undo these chains, my friend. Iâll show you the rage Iâve hidden.
Perish the Sacrament. Swallow, but nothingâs forgiven.
You and I canât decide which of us was taken for granted.
Make amendsâ¦ some of us are destined to be outlived.

Step inside/ See The Devil In I
Too many times, weâve let it come to this
Step inside/ See The Devil In I
Youâll realize Iâm not your Devil anymore

Under the words of men, something is tempting the father.
Where is your will, my friend? Insatiates never even bother.
You and I, wrong or right, traded a lie for the leverage.
In between the lens in light, youâre not what you seem.

Step inside/ See The Devil In I
Too many times, weâve let it come to this
Step inside/ See The Devil In I
Youâll realize Iâm not your Devilâ¦
Iâm Not Your Devil Anymore

Your Station- Is Abandoned- Fool You âcause I know what youâve done
Sensation- Deprivation- You shouldâve burned when you turned on everyone

So Step inside/ See The Devil In I
Too many times, weâve let it come to this
Step inside/ See The Devil In I
Oh, when all thatâs left does not make sense
Step inside/ See The Devil In I
I know youâll find your answers in the end
Step inside/ See The Devil In I
Youâll realize Iâm not your Devilâ¦ anymore

So Step inside/ See The Devil In I
See The Devil In I 
See The Devil In I
