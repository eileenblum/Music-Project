I donât seem to care today. I mirror what I love with what I hate.
Empty ways can cloud your eyes. I only know because I tried.
So come with meâ¦come with meâ¦
Letâs meet our contestants! Thereâs no better time to play the game!
I donât want to give it away! Underneath the citadels
Buried deep with your guilt and regrets
Leading in the dark, everything is wonderful
I donât care â I donât want to forget
Why is it a crime? Itâs none of your business
I prefer to be in hell by myself
Turn the other cheek and tell it to somebody who
Refuses to forgive, when nothing was taken

No one else survives â Iâve seen you live, now watch me die
But we donât see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes â Alone in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all

Hidden in the rubble, everybodyâs got a story to tell
What do I need? Eliminate the possible
All thatâs left is a man in a cell
Maybe Iâm wrong, maybe a decision is
The better way to go, the better way to be
Iâve got my demons â Go get your own
Save another number â Donât forget to hate me

No one else survives â Iâve seen you live, now watch me die
But we donât see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes â Alone in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all

No one else survives â Iâve seen you live, now watch me die
But we donât see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes â Alone in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all
The one that kills the least still kills us all
The one that kills the least still kills us ALL!
