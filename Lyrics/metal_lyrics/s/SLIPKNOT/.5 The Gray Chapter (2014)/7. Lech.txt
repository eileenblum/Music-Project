I know why Judas wept, motherfucker!

The fires burn on the summit, shining a light on the ones Iâve killed
Survivorâs guilt, undetermined â I could murder the world in all the blood Iâve spilled

Banishment â Sequestered and conquered
To hell with your intelligence â just figure out your common sense

No one is bulletproof

Iâll eat the skins of my brothers â the alabaster bones will make a perfect wall
Can I fill in the cracks of these feelings?
With every terrible piece or maybe nothing at all?

Selfishness â Take credit for everything
What more could you ask for?
And does it matter anymore?

No one is bulletproof

Can you feel the cold? Fortune never favors the old
Tired of defending myself â Go complain to somebody elseâ¦.somebody else

The monsters in your madness are the voices in your head
Theyâre scratching at your windows as you hide beneath the bed
You live like fucking heathens so youâll die like pagan gods
In between the poisons and the pure
Contagions and the cure
NINE â FOR â SURE

I got a bone thatâs dead inside of me
Itâs a rotting sick that I donât need
Feel free to vent your denigration
I canât believe Iâm saying this
Iâll live with my regrets. Iâll die by my decisions.
Iâm not your fucking superstar - Keep it close â youâre going way too far

NO ONE IS BULLETPROOF!
