[Verse 1]
The ghosts have killed enough
Familiar haunts have had enough
Too much thought will give you doubt
And now they found you
It's safer in an encage
They can tell you what to say
All your dreams come with a price, so they own you
But what did you expect?
Was it too much to protect?
Did you understand they had selfish intentions?
And they were pulling you in opposite directions

[Chorus]
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
We are the override
We are the override

[Verse 2]
The dead don't know, the dead are lonely
A fascination phase
When this mercy execution says it's over
You follow as preferred
Now their plans are un-detoured
Who can bring them in to sew the seed?
It's over
Even hate starts out as love
Sometimes when it's all you want
Maybe satisfaction will take you for granted
And all this hope is the emotion you abandoned

[Chorus]
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
We are the override
We are the override

[Verse 3]
You clawed out from nothing and I sent you back
Floor to the pedal and lock what you act[?]
Covered in sores - you cannot be the one
You are the answer to why we have risen
You are not the way
You are judged to being afraid
You are simple and unchanged
We believe you should give up
Give up
Give up
God and his mercy will take you for granted
When all that's left is a life you abandoned

[Chorus]
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
We are the override
We are the override

[Outro]
Give up [9x]
