When you said you were lost
I couldn't help but feel
Like I had to find you

And rescue you
From the shadows that took you,
Lest you be consumed.

I don't need to be found,
These shadows are my blanket.
I'm wrapped up safe and sound.

I don't need your love
To guide my way home.
I'll be fine on my own.

This is not the way.
We can use our love to heal us both
I promise, I promise.

This is not the way.
We could have bliss if we wanted
If not for being foolish.

We could use our love to heal us both
I promise, I promise.

Why won't you let me in?
Your gaze leaves me cold,
I want to feel your warmth.

I'll hold you at arms length
As long as I need to,
'til I'm left well alone.

Why do you hide away?
Away from all that could be,
Away from all that is?

I'm not fit to love,
I'll only go and drag you down
Into the shadows where I lay.

This is not the way.
We can use our love to heal us both
I promise, I promise.

This is not the way.
We could have bliss if we wanted
If not for being foolish

We could use our love to heal us both
I promise, I promise.

Let me go,
Let me go,
Let me go,
I'm learning how to love.

Why won't you listen to me?
We could pass this fractal exam.
Why won't you listen to me?
We could bloom together.
