I toe the line between the innocent and the guilty.
I tread the space not met between the light or the dark.
This path of the everyman.

I am society's backbone in times of need;
And times of caution, and times of hunger
For something more than fortune and fame: I seek enlightenment.
I denounce myself.

I am the blue collar worker. Nine to five; satisfied with all his worth.
I am the arrogant fuck, staring down at his empire.
It's never enough.
To bring us back to step one, erase everything down to zero, level off the playing field
May be seen as anarchy by some, but this discomfort is your freedom.
It's your freedom

I am Caesar and you are my slaves.
I am normality infected.
I seek to be the plague; infecting innocent cells with my impurities and sins.

To be truly free, to be truly right, to be truly pure: we must be reborn.
To be truly wrong, to be truly cursed, to be too far gone: we must bring forth the the storm.
We must.
