[I. The Wanderer]

Seven days and Seven nights
Of bitter, frenzied, dreamless sleep.
Convulsions grip my weakened frame,
Awakening in cold sweats

'Til I bring you back
I shall not rest, I shall not fold.
I'll use my love to guide me home.
Your eyes, like beacons, guide my way
To the castle in the sky.

So I tread hallowed ground,
Violate these sacred lands with my presence;
There is an evil in the air.

I shall not rest, I shall not fold.
I'll use my love to guide me home.
Your eyes, like beacons guide my way
To the castle in the sky.

[II. The Colossi]

[Instrumental]

[III. Betrayal Of The Wanderer]

My love, if only you'd return
So that I may gaze upon your eyes
One last time.

So I bury you beneath the sun.
Goodbye my love..
For my sins I've doomed us both
To this castle in the sky.
