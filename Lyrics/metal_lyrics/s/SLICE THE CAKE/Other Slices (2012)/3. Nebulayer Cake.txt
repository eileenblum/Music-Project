The apex approaches,
A fleeting zenith of our collective creation.
Time goes unnoticed
As if like sand through our toes, each grain containing years.

And still we tread onwards,
Blissfully unaware of our temporal codification.

Our paradoxical nature unfurls
Revealing a map of the stars.
Together we can reconcile and create a triumvirate;
Our manifestations reaching to heaven.

A nebulous plane, time is no longer of essence.

Synchronistic movements behind the scenes
Urge us to weave a greater tapestry.
We sow the seeds of our very creation,
Growing brighter and stronger as they feed.

Our seeds they sprout into trees,
Our branches ancient and ageless.
Our leaves, they feed on our energy
And in return, we feed on them.

And still we tread onwards,
Blissfully unaware of our temporal codification.

As one, we grow.
As one, we bloom.
In this nebulayer cake.
