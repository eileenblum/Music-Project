A schism appears
My identity fragments, leaving glimpses
In its wake of who I could've been and might yet be
Through the grey I see myself illuminate

I see a Siren in my dreams
She sings to me, her voice angelic
She brings to me glimpses of perfection
A previous life, idealised lies?
It's all the same to me.

And when all is said and done
Her voice still echoes in my ears
A ringing sound I cannot bury

Yet I feel torn by her ever present guiding hands
Do I reject this world and substitute my hatred for her love?

This schism it heals
A state of unity approaches
I yearn for transcendence
She shows me the door but I lack the key

She tells me stories
She tells me tales
She sings me songs of love
And songs of loss

She draws me to the water
And I wade in
Content to let the ocean
Take me where it will

I gaze upon her spirit
I see a face
It took all this time to realize
This face is mine

You look so familiar
