From whence you came shall you return
From the flames from which you were born.
The deception in your rotten hearts
Dooming the young to mental castration.

Led like sheep through a series of malignant trials and tests,
Leaving the meek amongst the flock to rot.
Fed with sanitised gruel 'til they can sense nothing but your stagnation.

And still there's no refuge, the cogs keep on turning,
Nothing to halt the march of this cancerous machine,
Save for you and me.

Our love is not enough to change the world
Or destroy the tumor at its source.

Throwing caution to the wind,
Poisoning all that's sacred,
Feasting on the souls of the young,
You pray on the weak with false illumination.

Mis-diagnosis with nebulous sicknesses
Serves to leave our ruined minds in fits of hypochondria .
How can we grow? How can we see?
How can we find a truth that's relevant with misdirection prevelant in all there is?

With these constraints we're nothing more than slaves.
Bound and gagged and beat 'til we submit.
The burden lays on us to collectively be the change we want to see.

Throwing caution to the wind,
Poisoning all that's sacred,
Feasting on the souls of the young,
You pray on the weak with false illumination.

At the expense of intuition
You loose the dogs of war.
They bay for blood.
