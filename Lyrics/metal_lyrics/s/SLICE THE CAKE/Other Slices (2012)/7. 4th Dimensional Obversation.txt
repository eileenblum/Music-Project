Space-time contorts and degenerates,
Cosmic fabric unwoven.
Perception of time disappears,
Dripping through my fingers into effervescent territories

They gaze at me through slitted eyes,
Hooded flesh, shadowed scales.
All hail our reptilian overlords
For they are here!!!

Chosen by the lizards
For ascension.
You will never leave
This state of 4th dimensional observation.

It's begun!
Trans-dimensional ascendance
Into 4th dimensional observation.
