For our tolerance, you respond with brutality
Trampled underfoot for a fucking pittance
To dig the graves for an industry that in its greed will eat itself.

And with itself, shall it take many lives within its wake.
So heinous, this trail of putridity.

Can no-one see them? Promethean in their gleeful exploitation,
Using the fire of the Gods for conceited motivations.

Down with the veils, its time for the truth to be revealed
Lest you be seen for the venomous harpies that you are.
Sell your soul for a taste of the fool's gold, screaming like a stuck pig when deprived
Symbiotic with eternal sin, poison of the liar coursing in your veins.

You will speak no more.

Empires fall with the rising of the sun
And kings shall die at the behest of their sons.
Laid to rest with the best of intentions
The best laid plains, they fall by the wayside.

Despair not in the waning of the moon,
For the night is darkest just before the dawn.
Dictators rise, but empires fall
With the rising of the new sun.
