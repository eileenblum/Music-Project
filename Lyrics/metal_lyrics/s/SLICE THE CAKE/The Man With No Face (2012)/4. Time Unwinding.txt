You rape our minds with your indoctrination
Filling our heads with needless information.
Suffocating under the weight of ceaseless bloated refuse.
We guzzle on your wretched seed 'til we can see no more
And hear no less than the tepid gruel you decided was our food

24 hours of unrest and unease
A thousand channels of this spiritual disease.

We will feed 'til the ground is barren.
We will drink 'til the stills are empty.
We will suckle 'til you ache,
And we shall not be sated.

We shall leech like the parasitic entity, we appear to be.
Vampyrically draining the life from whatever we see fit.

We grow queasy as we consume, fattened from a diet of your noxious fumes.

And once we've eaten 'til nothing's left
We shall grow starving, bloated and weak.
We shall grow sickly from the inside out
As our organs cease to exist.

Rotting away to nothing
The wretched carcass leaves no mark of grandiosity
No signs of what was once a monument to our consumation.

And with reckless abandon we hurtle forward.

We stand transfixed on the precipice of being,
A choice between two worlds, we stand unsure of time's unwinding.

We stand transfixed on time's unwinding,
We stand transfixed on time's unwinding.
