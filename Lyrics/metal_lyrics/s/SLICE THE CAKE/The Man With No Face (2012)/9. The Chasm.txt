I know there's something more
That lies beyond my reach;
An ethereal whole that beckons
Me to percieve the bigger picture.

But still I cannot leap
Across the chasm that lies before me
For the gap seems all to big.
I know it only takes a single step
But I cannot find the strength.

If only I could break
These chains that bind in place
A restless soul in search of truth.

If I could only break
This self-destructive
Trail of self-deception.

So I shall make amends.
I shall make my peace.
I will forgive all those
Who I feel have wronged me.

For without forgiveness
Comes a life of pain;
Self-imposed chains
Born of petty grudges.

I will forgive you
I will forgive myself.

And so I fall into the arms of peace and tranquility.
