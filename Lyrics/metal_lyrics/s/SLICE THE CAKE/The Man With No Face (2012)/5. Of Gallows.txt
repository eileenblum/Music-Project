It grows so stilted, this rift of seperation.
It lies through its teeth, the 6th degree of prophecy.
And all along, this felt so pure, just tell me what went wrong?
Why did we cease to nourish life, leaving only barren wastes?

An outdated paradigm exists in the rift between change and stagnation.
Plaguing my dreams with apocalyptic signs of the necrotic ones stalking me

Relentlessly.
Feasting on the old ways.

Time runs short for this ticking time bomb of malcontent.
Threatening to gluttonously implode and swallow everything we've worked for.

We cannot sustain ourselves, we feast until there's nothing left.
We reap the punishment as we cannibalise ourselves.
We cannot live much more, 'til we find sustenance.
Withering away to nothing with the setting of the sun.

If you will not listen, then walk me to the gallows.
One last time I see you, as you walking from the gallows .

This masquerade cannot compare wordless glances, faceless stares
Cast down in purgatorial retribution.
Here we will rot eternally, our flesh stagnating syncronously
The stench of death will fill our lungs forever.

As you walk me to the gallows.

For me to hang.

I kiss so sweetly, your fetid lips.
I kiss goodbye, all that I'll miss.
As the noose is placed around my neck, I gaze into your eyes

If you will not listen, then walk me to the gallows.
One last time I see you, as you walking from the gallows.
