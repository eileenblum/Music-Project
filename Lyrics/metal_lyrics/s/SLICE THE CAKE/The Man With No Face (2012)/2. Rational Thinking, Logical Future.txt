So here we find ourselves again...
Standing on the edge of a precipice
The marriage of man and machine
An odious testament to our
Fearlessness and our arrogance.

No longer reliant on human fragility,
Now the facility for biomechnic
Synthetic replacement is all we need,

But there's a catch...

In exchange for your humility and empathy,
Comes immortality, death becomes a fallacy;
Human essence reduced to mere plasticity
In this rational thinking, logical future.

And all that is left is to shovel the shit.
And all that is left is to shovel the shit.

So what will become of this race,
On the precipice as the singularity encroaches?
Will we retain our humanity for the sake of integrity
Or will it be washed a way, smothered by the wrath of mother earth?

In this rational thinking, logical future?
