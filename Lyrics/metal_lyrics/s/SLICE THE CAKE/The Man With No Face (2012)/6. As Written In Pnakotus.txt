The ever open mouth
Endless impossibilities
Spiralling Fractal Geometry
Assaulted with terrifying images
Enslavement of the soul by malevolent entities
Expressionist states of inter-dimensional transience
Omnipresent perception of time and space
Dissociated States of Awareness
Kinetic displays of ethereal bioluminescence
Gifted and cursed with otherworldly knowledge
Crystalline walkways into a personal hell

Sublime entities of unexplainable origin, elucidate a fractured mind.
Conjoined in visions of extra-dimensional consequence,
The ramifications become all too clear.

As I sink into the sands of Pnakotus
