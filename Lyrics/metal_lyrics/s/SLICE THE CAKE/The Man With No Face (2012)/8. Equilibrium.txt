All is not well in this conjugal state of stalemate interdependence
Fragile mirror-image hanging on a knife-edge; a microcosmic indecency.
A new kind of metafiction, to recreate the bigger picture
Given the kiss of death before it had its chance to breathe

And breathe it shall.

I bear witness to the monolith of self-evident cowardice,
born and bred of infallibility, is human nature not the culprit?
Unanimous in our contempt of the regressive sense of intuitive momentum,
we abandon all common reason to adapt to being poisoned,

So we shall breathe smoke, collective in our pursuit of self-destruction.

Who propagates the seeds of discontent in the hearts of men?
For fertile soil bears no grudge against the flowering of beauty.
A state of equilibrium must be unearthed,
Lest the scales tip all too far and bury the diamonds in the rough.
