I enter darkened waters.
I lose my body beneath the waves, seeing visions of what could've been.

It's so strange...â¨
I see my body floating before me,
a strange and empty vessel, tied down but weightless.

The tides take me away.

Take me away...

I have been here before.

Yes, I have...

Oh, I have been here before.

Sewn from void to form.

Sewn from shell to shell.

I prayed the night might take meâ¨

and so it did.
