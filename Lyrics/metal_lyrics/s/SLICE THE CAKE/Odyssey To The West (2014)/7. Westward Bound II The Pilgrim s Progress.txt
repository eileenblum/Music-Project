Westward bound,
I've seen the light of day.
The paintings on the walls of inner caves only appear where the light can't reach.

O', what a blessing that my shadow follows me.

I choose.

I choose where the light gets in;
an image mirroring my very being upon the canvas

that is the earth we tread,
that is the soil on which we step.â¨

And would you think me to be wrong as I speak to you?
It's been too long since I have seen your face.â¨
Would you think me to be wrong as I speak these truths to you?

Then stay your tongue, lest I cut it where you stand,
O', vile and sordid lech,â¨
your tongue so laced with barbs and filth that it could blight the very earth

and sicken us all beyond repair.
â¨
O', Lecherous One!
Stay your tongue lest I cut it where you stand.â¨
Don't think for a second that you'd be spared!

And would you think me to be wrong as I speak to you?â¨
And would you think me to be wrong as I speak these truths to you?â¨

O', how they've long laid dormant,
so hidden, occult, and buried neath your cinders.â¨

"And this won't be the last of it.

Heed my words,
O', Pilgrim.
This won't be the last of it."

Silence,â¨
O', Lecherous and Vile One!â¨
I condemn you to a never-ending quiet.â¨ â¨

Silence,
O', Unholy and Perverse One!â¨
I condemn thee to ageless damnation.â¨ â¨

O', be silent,â¨ De-sanctifier, Pillager!â¨
I condemn thee to speak no more.â¨
â¨
Quiet,â¨
O', Unenviable, Cursed one!â¨
I must travel westward bound.
