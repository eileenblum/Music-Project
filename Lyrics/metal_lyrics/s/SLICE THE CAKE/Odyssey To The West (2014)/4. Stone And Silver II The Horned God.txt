And so as darkness fell on the first of days and the skyline opened wide.

The Heavens in their oblique majesty did speak of an old and holy grove.â¨

Enumerate in starlit forms how the trees came to speak in tongues

and what it is they say through a conduit of horned form.

"O', lowly Pilgrim!
How dare thee have the gall to seek
my graven image, stead and swift among the grass and leaves?"â¨ â¨

Know not of malice,â¨
O', benefactor!â¨
Know no pretense at my side!â¨
â¨
"Know not of where it is you came from,
Know, Pilgrim,
know of these three things:â¨
â¨
The Sword that is not a Swordâ¨
The Sound that is not a Soundâ¨
The Face that is not a Faceâ¨
â¨
These boons, I give to thee,
O', Pilgrim
to light the way home!"
