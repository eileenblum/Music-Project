Spent the day catching stars out of the sky back into your heart. And every time that I close my eyes an angel dies in silence. Because these tears are so hard to see through because this rain makes it so hard to see you. Thoughts so cherished they flew off with the wind, to an empty hand that never touched such warm skin. I never want to feel again. I never want to hear those words again, and in our hearts the reasons why, blue skies never burned so bright, and if this was one last time save me a goodbye
