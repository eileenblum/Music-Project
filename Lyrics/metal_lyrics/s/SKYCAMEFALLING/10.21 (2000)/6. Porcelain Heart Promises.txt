How beautiful the way the sun sets. As we stared up at the same sky, and swore that for an eternity that the stars would collide. I can reach the sky, but I still can't touch your heart. Can we dream of tomorrow when we can't even get through today? As forever fades away I will carry these blades on paper cut hands. I'll cross my heart in hopes that I would die. Throught a plethora of screams, they can't hear my cries. In these echoes of silence, I can hear the angels sing, yearning for forgiveness, and the healing of broken wings with hearts on fire. I'm praying for the clouds to hold me in its embrace. I am trying to stand on these broken legs. Reflecting on memories I have so yearned to erase. Tears run for so long that I have gotten used to the taste.
