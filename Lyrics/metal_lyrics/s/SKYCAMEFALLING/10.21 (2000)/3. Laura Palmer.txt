For hours I tried to outrun the sun, tried to speak with a mouthful of blood. But still I'm choking on your tears, still I'm choking on you tears. Words slowly fall of my tongue, maybe I never tried, hard enough, all these times. The air seems so damn still today when emptiness is all we have to fill the vacancies. You lied when you said it would all be okay. You lied when you said tomorrow is merely another day away. When the sun never rises wherever you are, you begin to lose track of the stars.
