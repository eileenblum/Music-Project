So where were you when one heart became two? When three words became more than you could chew? And there is no way we can make amends when all this comes to its bitter end. Because sewn words untangle with time. These sand-castles we so carefully built. The waves crash in. Washes them all back to sea, watch them crumble. This bed of nails I lay to rest. And like the albatross I await the wind to help me soar above the clouds, but on this still day I sit waiting patiently with my memories. Still it goes on pouring down. And I watch the earth fall apart slowly collapse around you, with my head in my hands I let my tears run. Because giving in was always easier than letting go. My ruin was losing you.
