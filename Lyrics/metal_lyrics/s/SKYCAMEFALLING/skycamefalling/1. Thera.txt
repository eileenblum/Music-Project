I need you now
I'm stranded in memories so rescue me
(I need you)
So close your eyes and forget tonight
Losing to your weighted eyelids, deadened I am falling back like lead
In time we can watch the sun rise and we can leave this all behind and drive
Let's have a drink to anything tonight
You are perfect just the way you are
I'm losing to your weighted eyelids, so we can watch this town come down
Your perfect so rescue me
Deadened I am falling back like lead, because we all bleed inside the lines
I need you more than ever before I'm stranded in my memories
It's been so damn long just hold on, I'll be waiting here
