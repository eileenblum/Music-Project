Drowning with you
We just sleep like dead weigts in water and I'm drowning with you
Sending them out, floathing back to shore
Cause where there's black there always blue
Shears were made to cut right through
You can feel it in you
And we all die here beautiful
Find space to pull the needles through
They'll never find me in here asleep
Sending them out around us
They will never find me
