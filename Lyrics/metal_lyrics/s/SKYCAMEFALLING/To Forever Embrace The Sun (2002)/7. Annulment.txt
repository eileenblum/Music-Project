I can smell your rotting flesh, but the bloods still on your hands.
You put yourself up on the cross that you bear and i drive this nail into
your hands, and then you'll burn for what you did to her. The vernal
equinox feasting on this blood. To scorn my eyes....

Thanks to ekt0m0rf for correcting track #2 lyrics.
