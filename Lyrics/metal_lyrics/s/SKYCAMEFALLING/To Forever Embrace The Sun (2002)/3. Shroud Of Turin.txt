Open our arms up to the terrifying skies and accept the deceitfull
antidote. Spit in the face of mother nature for we have burned her
beautiful cedar. We have become the gods, to destroy ourselves.
No longer are the virtues sacred since the dawning of biological intrusion,
the science of execution has taken flight and the repercussions will cut
our throats. Like sediment poured into a flaming sea, our ideologies
doom us to blasphemy. We shall rever the vile antecedent, our righteous
throne is forever burning eden.
