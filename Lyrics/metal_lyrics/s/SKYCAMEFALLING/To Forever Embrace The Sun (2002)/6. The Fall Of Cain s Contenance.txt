last night i dreamt of her jaundice discolorations and how she sheltered
me from damnation. I beleived you, i tore those chords for you. But
still you slice at my wrists to watch me bleed and to drown in your sea
of misfortune. The bleedings never ending. My veins will spill blood red
to feel your touch again (so i tore your hands from me becuase yours
were coverd in shame). And i cant feel and you cant speak, you keep
asking for answers when all i can give you are memories. It tears clean.
I pay for all my sins.
