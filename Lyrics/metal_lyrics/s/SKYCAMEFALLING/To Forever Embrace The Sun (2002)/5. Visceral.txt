I wish i could tear your eyes out. You have belittled her with your
insecurities, it reeks on your breath. Put on that grin. This is the day
that the dreams died, as you shatted her soul that lies inside. As the
echoes rape the blessed this is the massacre, that we bear with
civilization. Inside her frail voice whispers, her reassurance, it
withers away. And that smile you've stapled to your face, is tripping
her whole life away. And i swear... you should die for that, you should
pay for that. You wont identify me...
