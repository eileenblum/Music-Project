The sky came falling down on me today, your terms and definitions scrape
the flesh. Thorns in my palms. The text that scars and keeps my faith
so intact, your terms and definitions burn holes through my naked back.
Slit my throat, slit my writs and drive this nail straight through my
throat. These scars on my wrists are for you.
