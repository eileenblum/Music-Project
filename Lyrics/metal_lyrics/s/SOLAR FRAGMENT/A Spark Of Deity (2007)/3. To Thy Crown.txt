So here I am after all these lies This could be innocence, I have been so blind since the day I saw you sitting by his side But will you cover all your tears and the secrets we shared?  My king, now hear me speak (don't you look at me this way) with passion and belief (he might guess the play) I will be serving you everlastingly  Nevermore I'll cross the line Nevermore I will fight I am the last to destroy all your blessed life So I let go off your hand and obey to Thy crown  The second day that I am on the run the rain is getting stronger let the flood begin Upon the water, reflections reviving my memories  And as I wander torn in pain I hear you whispering my name Knight of mine, don't you depart!  Nevermore I'll cross the line ...  Devotion and dishonour!  Restinction means to lose her If I had one wish I'd choose another life for us no kingdom in between  A torrent raging wild your face seems to rush by So I will go down and we unite one last time  Nevermore I'll cross the line ...
