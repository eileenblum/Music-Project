I have written this to calm your trembling hands Know that our bond of affection prevails my early end Outrage they did blame me for and I guess they are right So tragic might be one's destiny when fate and guilt decide  All of these colours are fading into gray Nameless faces, they watch me pass away  So long, I'll wait for you and it tears my soul in two Like all my broken dreams I'm dying This pain I'm going through will bring me back to you When time has come we are united  To the fairest I bowed my head By a sinner it is raised instead I knew Thee well, more than I thought  No fears were harming the bliss of our time I will pay now for my crime  I hear the hangman call (don't be afraid, we will meet again) In the course of my duty I open the door  So long, I'll wait for you...  Don't lose your heart Just know I'll be waiting for you in the dark  So long, I'll wait for you...  I fade away
