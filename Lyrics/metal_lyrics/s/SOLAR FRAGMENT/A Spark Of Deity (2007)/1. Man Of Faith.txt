Torn by a lie and defeated 
by life I despaired 
Every single hope was dashed 
between the wheels of my chair 
Now I revive! The sand beneath my feet: 
This is my miracle, this is my release 

Here I am, a man of faith 
it was my destiny to come to this place 
And I know my part: I will meet my fate 
I will struggle till I see the island's heart  Each of us was brought here for a purpose 
each of us is at the island's service 
The numbers cannot stop me 
from facing Hatch and Rock 
Call me hunter or scarface or just call me Locke 

Here I am, a man of faith 
it was my destiny to come to this place 
And I know my part: I will meet my fate 
I will struggle till I see the island's heart 

(4 8 15 16 23 42 sum up, press "execute") 
Yes, I looked right into the eyes of the island 

(4 8 15 16 23 42 - you are doomed) 
and what I saw was beautiful and  you better trust your visions, 
follow your siren! 
Repent your sins to me! 

Now I revive! 
The sand beneath my feet: 
This is my miracle, this is my release 

Here I am, a man of faith 
it was my destiny to come to this place 
And I know my part: I will meet my fate 
I will struggle till I see the island's heart
