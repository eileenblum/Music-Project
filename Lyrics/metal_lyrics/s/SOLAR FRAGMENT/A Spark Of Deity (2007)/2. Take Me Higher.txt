The death of the Taurus has brought us here Minos has taken revenge We fear to die in exile but I know there is still a chance for us to go above the sea, my son, don't touch the waves, don't near the sun Watch out!  Hear my words: follow the clouds! But in his days of levity the boy is not aware at all Father, save me your words come, let us fly like birds and  Take me higher on wings we are leaving on wings we arise Shore so dire I'm longing for freedom The price for it will soon be payed  So the tragic is foretold the wax will melt beneath the burning sun My invention, is it safe? Nature can't be replicated! The claws of wind, at once they reap the young man falls into the sea My fault!  It's too late but now I see the blaze in the sky would have posed no threat if we had chosen the night instead  Take me higher on wings we are leaving on wings we arise Shore so dire I'm longing for freedom The price for it will soon be payed
