Dawning veils the barren land 
another cheerless day has fallen down 
and will prevail until the end 

A haze of misery is crawling from the ground 
Soon the countryside in gray is drowned 
All fortune-tellers, they speak of an everlasting night 
Yet there is hope on our side  Through the mist we are shining 
Behold the spark of deity! 
And by the colours of that star 
our light will spread afar 
across the lakes and the hills 
fear no fire, just burn! 

And when the clouds tear apart 
you will see my face 
will hear my voice 
we came to bring 
infernal noise  Don't ask a single time what this is for 
Just open up your mind and look 
into the fragment of the sun! 
It has begun! 

Through the mist we are shining... 

Inside the core of the light you will find just a melody 
But once you've discovered the power in it 
you will be free 

Through the mist we are shining...
