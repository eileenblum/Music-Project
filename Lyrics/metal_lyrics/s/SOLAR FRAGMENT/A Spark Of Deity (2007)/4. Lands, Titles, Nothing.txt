Lord, we have come this far 
but the next move will decide 
whether there was sense at all 
in this sacrifice of life 
Silent terror 
They are scared, in grief alone 
Innocence was stained with blood 
for a country they once owned 

Independence, 
your greatest desire 
Is it worth to fight for 
even though your spirit tires? 
Foretime decisions 
were all made selfishly 
What good is that damned crown for 
if it's earned deceivingly? 

Your heart is free 
Come, have the courage 
to follow me  Tonight we touch the sky 
from anguish we rise 
Nobility no longer reigns 

Standing petrified 
in the shadows of my throne 
What have I done to those 
who trusted in my plight? 
I feel ashamed for my betrayal 
and my theft of what they 
all were struggling for

Cursed father! 
My hate will die with you! 
If only I had recognized 
the trap we fell into 
Rage and vengeance, 
in sorrow both are drowned 
So now it's up to me 
to lead them on battlegrounds  Your heart is free... 

Tonight we touch the sky 
from anguish we rise 
Nobility no longer reigns 
Defiance of endless tyranny 
You have bled with Wallace 
now bleed with me 

And on this field 
they stand outnumbered 
Rain is falling, distant thunder 
And with a roar they start to run 
A dream's fulfilled, a new life has begun 

Your heart is free... 

Tonight we touch the sky...
