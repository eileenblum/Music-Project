Underneath the mountainside lies a maze of brashly stones, dark and freezing cold  Its secret yet is covered well and unseen are most creatures dwelling in pain - so they say Root and tendril twist their way through long forgotten halls Noone's ever dared to cross before  Memorize your turns, my lad in case you understand what I am trying to commend Light is hope and on hope you depend  Spying through the darkness: unresting eyes When I turn aroundthey vanish all at once out of sight Still prepared to attackas they await the fading of light  Clinging to his oil-lamp hardhe moves on for hours till he gets sight of an underground-lake,so calm In its center stands amirror coated with thick grimes So it is done, unveil the myth of time  Blind with curiosity he's heading for the isle across that narrow bridge, a wile The sea engulfs and extinguishes the light  Spying through the darkness...  Memorize your turns, my lad...  Crying for salvation, efforts in vain Insanity! I'm surrounded by the hands of endless night No creatures attack, noone beholds I'm surrounded by the hands of endless night No creatures attack, noone beholds the fading of light!
