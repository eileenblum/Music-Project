I have a special gift for you
A life of power, owned by few
For the good side you will strive
But in the end youâll fight the light

Crawling through your veins
There is Jedi blood
Itâs your skill to see the future
Like one sees the past
Reckless and self-assured
There is so much you must learn
Wonât you come and take the course
Apprentice of the Force?

Inside the circle, yet all alone
Only grief as you leave your mother behind
Inside the circle, youâre on your own
Bound to the prophecy

And as the slave becomes the padawan
A black cloud of nightmares
Keeps torturing his heart
I swear I will not fail
Rage to those who cross my way
And so he screamed out at the stars
Vengeance is mine

Inside the circle, yet all alone
Only grief as a friend and father has died
Inside the circle, youâre on your own
Bound to the prophecy

After all, I face the fact
That everyone I love is dead
Save you, my queen, my love, my bride
But through the mist
I feel her pain of giving birth
And I cannot find a way
Itâs out of sight
Where is the Force to save her life?

Why does the council show you no trust?
Cursed be their ignorance
And I can only pray youâll find your way
Give in to your anger
It makes you wise
Only through me she will survive
Come now, Vader, walk with me

Inside the circle, yet all alone
Now sheâs gone
And heâs slowly drifting away
Inside the circle, youâre on your own
Bound to the prophecy

Inside the circle, yet all alone
All is lost
And heâs slowly drifting away
Inside the circle, youâre on your own
Bound to the prophecy
