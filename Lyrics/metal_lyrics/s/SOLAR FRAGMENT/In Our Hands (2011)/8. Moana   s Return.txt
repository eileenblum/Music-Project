Stories tell of magic realms
That are buried underground
Once upon a time
There was a girl wearing the crown
Although she lived in bliss and love
There was a longing for the earth above
For daylight and stars

And so she climbed up high
To pass the secret gate
Blinded by sunlight her memories fade
And no one has ever since seen her again
They say her spirit survived

This is the story of Moanaâs return

Where am I now?
Why did you lead me here?
Those rotten walls
They scare me, they make me feel
That Iâve been here for a long, long time
But who is the guard of this hidden shrine?

I am the pan, your servant, your friend
I am as old as the trees and the wind
And I know you will
Remember your name
Then I shall take you afar

So carry me down

This is the story of Moanaâs return
(to) where fairies still live
And the moon never dies
Where thrones in golden light are waiting
This is the tale of her rise and her fall

In the shelter of comforting night
You shall be questioned
Till your spirit revives
And Iâll be there to guide you through
What are you waiting for, girl?
Just get it done

One: do recover the key from the toad
Two: get the dagger, but donât touch the fruit
And three: spill the blood of a poor little boy

So carry me down

This is the story of Moanaâs returnâ¦

The distance is fading
The breathing gets low
(and she falls)
Nobody else in this place
But her and the faun

This is the story of Moanaâs return
(to) where fairies still live
And the moon never dies
Where thrones in golden light are waiting
This is the tale
Remember the tale
This is the tale
Of her rise and her fall
