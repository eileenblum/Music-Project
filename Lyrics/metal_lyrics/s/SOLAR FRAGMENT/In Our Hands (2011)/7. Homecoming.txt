Standing on a sunlit deck
His quest is done, his vow fulfilled
Now there is nothing left to trouble his mind
Still he is shaking
Heâs getting back to where his life
Once was awakened
Grief and doubt will dissolve
In the air and now

I see them running down the peer
Towards their father
For he shall never leave
His loved ones ever after

Hear me now, I will be there
Eleven years from now, I swear

Iâm heading home
All these yearâs Iâve been wrong
I reached for the stars losing sight of the sun
But now that the final journeyâs almost done
My sorrows are washed away
And drowned in the bliss of my homecoming

Wearing the charm from his true love
(you will never be alone)
Bonded they are by the silver moon
That shines among the stars
Set the course
Leave yearning far behind us
May God have taken care of those I left behind

Oh Lord, please guide me to find them alive
Iâd give me soul, make any sacrifice

Hear me nowâ¦

Iâm heading homeâ¦

He is surely hasting
Time he ainât wasting
Speaks the mother to comfort her child
Who dreams beyond horizon far

Hear me nowâ¦

Iâm heading homeâ¦
