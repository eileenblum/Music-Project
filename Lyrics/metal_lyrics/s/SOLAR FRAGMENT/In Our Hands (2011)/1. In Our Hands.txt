The Spark of Deity ignites in our hands

Down in the land of sighs
This superficial life keeps going on
Will it ever end (will it ever end)?
My will, my testament
Is to destroy the land
Let terror reign
Spoke the moribund
(when his day had come)

But thereâs a legend
Ablaze the sky will descend
And fire will rain
So all who wear a soulless face
Will be released from the haze

Itâs five strokes of fate
Of pain and loss and misery
Thatâs the number of the stones that I will break
I will bring justice to the world
Once and for all
You all go with me when I die

I spent my life protecting you
You just brought me agony
No, I canât take it anymore
A nationâs sought to spoil my life
Why now you all will die

The Spark of Deity ignites in our hands
Itâs burning from within to brighten up the land
Defeat the twilight so that day and night revive
Can you feel the sunrise in your heart?

But as they carry out the task
Itâs the keeperâs son
Who can embrace the Spark
His will is strong and he is trying to take
His dead fatherâs place
Now itâs up to him

Caught up in a nightmare
His past is falling in oblivion
Oh, itâs drowning in the fog
So, itâs a race against the time
Restore the light divine

The Spark of Deity ignites in our handsâ¦

(I donât regret to be the slayer of my kind)

This is the last chance
We face the razorâs edge now
Despite all hopelessness
The bearer will not slow down
Reverse the horror of the kingâs revenge

Still heâs marching on and on
To reignite the flames
Stumbling through a field of ghosts
Until the stones
Bring day and night again

Thereâs no shelter, no encouragement
Itâs a burden and heâs out there all alone
Thereâs no shelter
There is no choice but going on
Or all the world will end
(thatâs my testament)

But thereâs a legend
Ablaze the sky will descend
And fire will rain
So all who wear a soulless face
Restart the human race

The Spark of Deity ignites in our handsâ¦
