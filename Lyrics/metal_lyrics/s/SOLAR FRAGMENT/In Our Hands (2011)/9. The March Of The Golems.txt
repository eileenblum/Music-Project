Wake up and follow me
Your rise is the start of my mastery
Unshaped, a scorn of man
Four thousand soldiers are at my command

Right from the shadow
Comes the flaming eyes
Their faces lifeless and vacant they stand
These are the warriors of an ancient time
Made of stone and clay
They will smash down the land

So they march till the end of all time
No one can ever stop them by steel or fire
You disbelievers, bow to me
Iâm forcing the town to its knees
And claim what has always been mine

The earth is shaking
Forsaken lands we will leave
As we walk to the scene
They were mistaken
For every self-pleasing laugh
Theyâll be torn apart

I have the power
For I wear the lordshipâs ring
These eyes, the tyrantâs eyes
A crucial part of his fake regime

I have the power
For I wear the lordshipâs sword
My plan, a perfect plan
Not yet, but soon the throne is mine

So they march till the end of all timeâ¦

And they scream, and they cry
For all their houses are stamped to dust
Those woods grow nevermore
But if they beg, if they pray
I shall be merciful and spare their lives
âcause Iâm a noble man
