I donât want to hear your stupid song
About the fisherman
Who sailed towards his ruin
For the one he loved
Cut that crap!

Welcome to the real world
Of sweat and blood and beer
Keep living in your shiny fairytale

I donât want to hear your fucking song
About the sailorâs wife
Who drowned herself in grief
As well as in the ocean

In your stories we are free
Endless skies above an endless spree
But if you ever came with me
Iâd show you freedom at the raging sea

We are the sons of the darkness
No, we donât care for deliverance
Thereâs no Fiddlerâs Green
We have ransacked and murdered
And raped in between
And I tell you now
There is nothing more
Than a cold and lonesome grave offshore

We shall be fighting side by side
And we will never hide
If you cross one of us
We strike back with the whole damn crew

Our ships may sink right to the ground
But we will never drown
We will float down below
And stab you in the back, my friend

I donât wear no feathered hat
I have both my eyes
But no wooden leg
The saber is not mine, but I wonât regret
To punch you in the face
With my bare fist instead

We are the sons of the darknessâ¦

Navigate me with the light of the stars
Donât you let me fall apart
Hoist the sails
Theyâre calling for me
Come hell or high water
The wind and the sea

Whatever you may think of me
What made me be this way
The truth is itâs a whole lifetime
Of solitude and pain

I lost my home, I lost my love
In sorrow I did roam
Well, actually my wifeâs a whore
She cursed me out of town

We are the sons of darkness
And we wonât turn away
Weâre sailing miles and miles
To prey on your silver and your life

We are the sons of the darknessâ¦
