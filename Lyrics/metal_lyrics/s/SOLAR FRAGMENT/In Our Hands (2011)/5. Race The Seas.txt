In this maze of green and white
In a forest dark and wild
In have been before or will I be?
I lost my sense of time

Three years I roamed in hell alone
I felt like dying but I canât
Suddenly there is a distant voice from outside
So close the book again
And risk a flash of light

I have to race the seas to regain my honor
To be worthy of loving you, my bride

I wonder is there a place left on earth
Or is it gone since Iâve turned the key?
Only your picture will keep me sane
I can see the prints of your feet on the beach
But at every spot
They are leading away from me
And I fear that with a splashing wave
They are drawn back to the sea

I have to race the seasâ¦

And then the tide will rise again
But youâre out of sight
So for a while Iâll rest here by the shore
Until my future will recur

Now you are stuck under the same old star
And there is no way out, believe me
I have tried them all
So sit down, letâs have that whiskey without jar
It seems like yesterday
That Iâve seen your final fate

Thereâs a trap somewhere around
Better watch your step
Donât be brave just let her down
You will drown
And when the lightning strikes you and you die
My precognitions fade
And I see you in another life

I have to race the seasâ¦

And then the tide will rise againâ¦
