Salvation: A merciless hand
from below holding the melancholy of
a million strangled souls Part, melancholy

So warm and glorious
embraced in a black mass
a mass which holds
the pain of oppression Part, oppression

I'll reach out for that salvation hand
and accept its shinig blessing
so that I can bear their pain and longing Part, longing
