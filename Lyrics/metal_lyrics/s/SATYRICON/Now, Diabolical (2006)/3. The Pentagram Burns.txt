Hellbent and raw
Armed to the core
Walks with the wind
Determined and strong
Inherit his laws
Adopt and obey

[Chorus:]
Rise my friend - march to war
Time is up - shadows dance
Fight my friend - tyrants pull
Time is up - burn the world

Driven by sin
Let the scavengers loose
Power from hell
Siege and advance
Silence the foe
Fire and smoke

[Chorus]

From the slumber arise
Triumphant Beast of forgotten times
The Pentagram Burns
And the clock strikes the hour
The Final Hour
