Freedom, urge, faith - and deeper he falls
Hatred, rage, fear - the stronger denial
Anger, heat, lust - the higher he climbs

[Chorus:]
Slave - the shackles are off
Act - Do it your way
Horns - the abyss ascends
Now gather the earth
It's the coming of the Dark Lord
All tribes unite
This is the rite of our cross

Viewing, judging, killing - A formula known
Fading, paling, rotting - A story too old

[Chorus]

Wielding, might, just - Now throw me the fight
Glowing, thriving, winning - The truth will be told

[Chorus]
