A bitter blow - A darkened maze
Can take you down
A fearless man - A shattered spirit
Will immerse in misery

Come see it - Come feel it
It is here
Come see it - Come feel it
It's alive

Delirium - Out of bounds
Delirium - Dying inside
Delirium - Left to wither
Delirium - Infernal Majesty

Count me in
(Let's) ride the storm
(And) fend them off
Set Me Free

A source of light - A tower call
Can lead the way
A scent of blood - A lust for life
Will take you home
A broken mind - A Fiery soul
Will stand the pain
A tightened fist - A will divine
Can break the chain

Come see it - Come feel it
It is here
Come see it - Come feel it
It's alive

Delirium - Out of bounds
Delirium - Dying inside
Delirium - Left to wither
Delirium - Infernal Majesty

Count me in
(Let's) ride the storm
(And) fend them off
Set Me Free
