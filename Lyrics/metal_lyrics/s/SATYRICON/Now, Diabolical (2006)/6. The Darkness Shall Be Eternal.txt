They've come into this sphere
With (their) natural born fire
To spread and protect new found truth
No man is man more noble the the cause he fights (for)

From the heavens
From the abyss
From the depths of man
From the mind
From the heart
From the soul

In the day and hour of depression
Fate is on our side
The twilight is soon over
And heads are turned northwards
Behind the wall of sleep is and always was

From the heavens
From the abyss
From the depths of man
From the mind
From the heart
From the soul

The will to win and timeless strength
Holy holy union made in hell
No dark force for you to overcome

From the heavens
From the abyss
From the depths of man
