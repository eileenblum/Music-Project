This is Armageddon

"And I looked, and behold a pale horse
And his name that sat on him was death
And Hell followed him, and power was given
Unto them over the fourth part of the world

To kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death
And with the beasts of the Earth."

And then again "I saw and beheld, a black horse,
And he that sat on him had a scythe, and a crown
Was given unto him and he went forth conquering, and to conquer
And there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black
A sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood

And the stars of heaven fell unto the Earth
Even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs
When she is shaken of a mighty wind, and the heavens
Departed as a scroll when it is rolled together
And every mountain and island were moved out of their places."
Almighty mountains and rocks, I beg you fall on them

For the great day of wrath is coming,
And who shall be able to stand?
