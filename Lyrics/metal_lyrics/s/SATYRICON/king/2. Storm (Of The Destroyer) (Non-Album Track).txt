Overture of evil
Aggressive force
Stamp of authority
The world is his stage
Always rise when down
Never bow to doubt
Pain is temporary
Pride is forever

The Destroyer

Resisting fire
Firm as a rock
Smelling fear
Unleash the storm
(If) they lust for death
Give them death
What they want
Is what you'll give
