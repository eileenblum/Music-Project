She's roaming free
Tucked with a lifeline
She's haunting me
Rocked by the netherworld

Consciously comes to me
Down on her knees
Painfully she moans indeed
Rapidly aggressively
Daggers shine and daggers kill

Nightfall (the nights that gods can't undo)
Chaos Alive (looking for the faith I had)
Demonic (their faith brings me another battle)
The Wolfpack

Your path is lit
Look for the alpha
Drugged to the bone
In the devils grip

Consciously comes to me
Down on her knees
Painfully she moans indeed
Rapidly aggressively
Daggers shine and daggers kill

Nightfall (the nights that gods can't undo)
Chaos Alive (looking for the faith I had)
Demonic (their faith brings me another battle)
The Wolfpack

Warcraft of the witch
Ceremonial ritual
This is the dream
That came to follow me

Nightfall (the nights that gods can't undo)
Chaos Alive (looking for the faith I had)
Demonic (their faith brings me another battle)
The Wolfpack
