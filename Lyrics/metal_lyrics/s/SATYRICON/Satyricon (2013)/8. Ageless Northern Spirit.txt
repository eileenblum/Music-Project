The winds
Sing their song
And I listen
They always sing
For those who listen

The lonely dark
Morning haze
Mountains who speak
Of time before time
Scattered snow
Hold the fort!

Winter - wake me
Fire - burn me
Fearless with horns
Ageless northern spirit

Faint cries from ocean birds
Rays of light down the valley
Tore me out of my rhythm
Listen...

Winter - wake me
Fire - burn me
Fearless with horns
Ageless northern spirit

Introspective and grateful

Winter - wake me
Fire - burn me
Fearless with horns
Ageless northern spirit

To the front!
Stand up!
With heart
Tuned in
Ageless northern spirit
