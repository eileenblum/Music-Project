In darkness
Underneath
The above
Swordbearer
Son of a tornado
He lies in the slumber of (dark) clouds

Born by a thought
He flies through the thunder of wars
Swirling
Ripping

Ultimate destroyer
Unspeakable avenger
Walker upon the wind
Hunting, piercing
(The) ultimate, roaring
Walker upon the wind

Son of a tornado
He lies in the slumber of (dark) clouds
Mourned, feared, adored
Accursed one, torn one, marked one

Ultimate destroyer
Unspeakable avenger
Walker upon the wind
Hunting, piercing
(The) ultimate, roaring
Walker upon the wind
