I gave you a sign
with my bare hands
from the underworld
I drove you around
with no remorse
and now IÂ´m dead to you
You saw my head spin
with your own eyes
IÂ´m not immortal
itÂ´s broken you down
and torn you apart
and now IÂ´m dead
Find me
take me
to the void. To the crooked nest
to Nekrohaven
The bestial screams
a life devoted
to the occult
the flickering lights
my dream came true
and now IÂ´m dead
Find me
take me
to the void. To the crooked nest
to Nekrohaven
Now all men weep
in my bare hands
Â´cause the lion
no longer roars
and now IÂ´m dead

Find me
take me
to the void. To the crooked nest
to Nekrohaven
