Take me down to the core
Of the innermost deep within (myself)
Show me and help me capture
The seed of my existance
And understanding of my purpose

Guide me in grasping the nerve
Of my own melody
Golden star
Shining light
With power to dissolve

The most scattered mind
Into a state of contentment

Hunter, warrior
Crawls his way through the universe
Hunter, warrior
The stage is yours
I can no longer rule

Who made who...

A few naked trees in an open field?
Or something with a higher purpose
And sense of being

Dance with me
And try moving
To my rhythm
You and I...
We can move together, together

Hunter, warrior
Crawls his way through the universe
Hunter, warrior
The stage is yours
I can no longer rule

Make the world spin and heads bow
Know that devotion is our daily bread

Faitful ye, hear me now
The golden star is here

Hunter, warrior
Crawls his way through the universe

I must carry this torch with him
Bring us all together to the finish line
