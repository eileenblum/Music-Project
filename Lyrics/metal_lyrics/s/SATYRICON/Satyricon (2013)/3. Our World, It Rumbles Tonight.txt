Smoke
Across the night sky
Tears the black open
Glows
Towards the earthbound
Breaks the light down

This moon
This moon
This night
This night
This sign
This sign
That symbolizes to me what must be done

Shadows that mirror and nurture the spirit

[2x]
My world crumbled
Your world
A star
Our world, it rumbles tonight

No mask
Pure will
One hand
One blade

Shadows
Sink

Summon the unwanted
And gather for a (final) journey

My world crumbled
Your world
A star
Our world, it rumbles tonight
