Without beginning, without end (our lifeblood)
the road for the spiritual outlaw is never ending
and so is the hunt for all those answers
the devil may hold your truth, what a fucking relief it would be (to know)
blue-cold and the grim truth stands before you (all you ever wanted?)
Descend and fly away to another day, another night
sleep forever or serve to justify
The brand that you wear speak of what you are made of
It leaves you like an open book for everyone to read
Is this it, is this what you wanted?
The eye of the rest on your back
To be a part of the masterplan is the only way to spiritual hell
drink to that and never forget where you came from
cause there's no such thing as a one way ticket to hell
what a fucking relief that is
Descend and fly away to another day, another night
sleep forever or serve to justify
