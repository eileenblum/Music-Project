Satyr

To all of you who has been writing to us without getting an answer, all we
Can say is that we appreciate your support, still though for us it is a
Choice between spending our time being creative or drowning in mail. The
Choice is pretty clear! One can still write if wanted, but letters will not
Be answered.

We know that are a lot of losers within the Black Metal Scene who talk a lot
Of shit, due to their envy, lack of intelligence, need to be someone and also
Being aware of themselves being losers. And if any of you losers should read
This and find these words provoking or stupid feel free to meet us in battle.
We shall Piss on your graves, kill your women, rape your daughters and
Torture your soul until eternity ends.

"Du er Kristen, Det er feilen med deg"
