He wander the fields of death... In eternity wandering our own path
Which has been the quest of immortality
Yet to conquer for me, but dreams shall not be torn

He is spirit
He is stone
And he is immortality
The king of the shadowthrone

And even the conqueror (of death)
Fell as a stone from the mountain
And time led to destruction
Once he left, he knew then in the past
That the seeds should be worthless
Spirit rise from your rest and return for them

I am spirit
I am stone
And I am immortal
