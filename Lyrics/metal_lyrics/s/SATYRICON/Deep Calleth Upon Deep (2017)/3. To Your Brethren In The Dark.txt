Forgotten days, forgotten thoughts
in the hour of chaos
pass the torch to your brethren in the dark

forever torn, forever gone
through the mirror, of despair
pass the torch to your brethren in the dark

Tomorrows dream, tomorrows gleam
its the burden in sorrow
pass the torch to your brethren in the dark

October sky, October leafs
and the silence, of nightfall
pass the torch to your brethren in the dark

These stories, distant and untold
These stories, of a world long gone
gone

To your brethren in the dark

Nocturnal light, nocturnal cold
on the mountain, now star it
pass the torch to your brethren in the dark

Eternal flight, Eternal void
with the spirit of chaos
pass the torch to your brethren in the dark

These stories, distant, and untold
these stories, of a world long gone
