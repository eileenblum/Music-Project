Through time, to the waters below
My song, for the silence above

The spirit of promise, on the table of stone
Under my skinâall the life you have ever lived

Seal the law
and pierce through the haze of time
The Ghost of Rome

No life lost behind that veilâjust the death of broken hearts
The Ghost of Rome

At night, in the temple we lost
One throne for the kingdom forlorn

The waves of NorthâNo tail broken it is
Over the wallâVeins rush from hate never trapped

Seal the law
and pierce through the haze of time
The Ghost of Rome

No life lost behind that veilâjust the death of broken hearts
The Ghost of Rome

Through time, to the waters below

The spirit of promise, on the table of stone
Under my skinâall the life you have ever lived

Seal the law
and pierce through the haze of time
The Ghost of Rome

No life lost behind that veilâjust the death of broken hearts
The Ghost of Rome
