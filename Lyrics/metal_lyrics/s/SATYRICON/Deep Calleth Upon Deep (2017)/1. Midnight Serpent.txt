Fire danceâin the morning sun
Altars burnâwe celebrate

God of no godsâI'm slave of none
I pledge to fightâyour cause is mine

Againstâthe against
From soul to soulâI speak to you
God of no godsâI'm slave of none
I pledge to fightâyour cause is mine

Withered leaves fall
towards frozen grounds
Coiling, twist and turn
Midnight Serpent
do you fear my heart

Blazing fire roar
against the blackened sky
Floating, hell and moor
Midnight Serpent
do you hear my cry

Tundra sweptâin my longing mind
Mortal windsâthe towers kneel
Sunrise never came

Withered leaves fall
towards frozen grounds
Coiling, twist and turn
Midnight Serpent
do you fear my heart

Blazing fire roar
against the blackened sky
Floating, hell and moor
Midnight Serpent
do you hear my cry

Againstâthe against
Soul to soul

Call of the wild
Coast to coast

Onboard the vessels
we all know will get rocked
And yet with shame sail forward
hoping that none shall see
It's demise

Face of morbidiy
spotted through the keyhole
Unlocked by the persecuted
who wants nothing but the sunlit meadows

Liberate, extirpate, pull up by the root
Let another song reverberate
Above the winds, soaring
Turn to the sun and let the cloak drop to the ground

Sunrise never came
It's cold again...
