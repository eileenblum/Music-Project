Hear the call
Hear the winds
Hear the trumpets
Hear the hooves

Trample
and the earth shakes
Broken
with a cursed fate

Lonely
when the night wakes
Naked
and the waves break
Leviathan
The seabed rumbles
Heads bow mourning it's the Burial Rite

Sound of fear
Sound of fortune
Beast of pain
Beast of hunger
Leviathanâlet's hear the Burial Rite!

Lonely
when the night wakes
Naked
and the waves break
Leviathan
The seabed rumbles
Heads bow mourning it's the Burial Rite

World of storms
World of promise
Trail of death
Trail of sorrow
Deep
down
there
Now

Lonely
when the night wakes
Naked
and the waves break
Leviathan
The seabed rumbles

Lurking deep
In the soul of man

Naked
and the waves break
Leviathan
The seabed rumbles

âHow shall the Burial Rite be read?
The solemn song be sungâ?

Trample
and the earth shakes
Broken
with a cursed fate
It's the Burial Rite
