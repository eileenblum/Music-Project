Memories burning in your brain
As you mentally die
Always right or wrong in your deeds, real...
...Belief wasn't your why

Feel your bare thought boiling in pain and
Making your dream no more
Now all this drifting through life is
Faking you to a slow decline
That will
Finish your helpless soul off
(Remember, your disgrace is the strength of another...)

You were tempted to share your remorse
Or to pray for the end
But on the road to your conclusion
Your path steeply descends

Now, giving yourself up to despair, you...
...Feel consumed by the time
Past no longer tortures your eyes, but
All I see is no lack of
Sadness
Coldness towards your own life

You did never look for freedom
Tied to the schemes of humanity
And your frailties are easy to see
But regarding all my wisdom
In front of this sad reality
No more my life is scaring me...

...And the solitude in its cold embrace
Is silently touching you
Your nerves need frustration...
...An instrument of torture, so pure
Now almost mortal
The oblivion's coils you're in
Another star dying away
The umpteenth sign on my...
...Skin
