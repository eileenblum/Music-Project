...And I thought I had always
Always watched ahead
...Though I had walked by the steps of a man
Who knows. Perfectly himself...
Looking on, how the sun rises
And dies within a day
But did I sincerely see
What I am, anyway?

Losing my glance in the vacuum
After so many whys
Finally realized I was wrong... (I know I was wrong)

In my haunted mind I feel
The doubt of existence growing
And surrounded with a dying tomorrow
A vain breath of life crawling
I get closer to nothing
To my enemy's hands
All is covered with an obscure cloak in which
My lifeless answers stand

But someday I'll understand
And see beyond your eyes
I'll know my truth by my awareness
Rediscovering my rise
No more light in my tired mind
No more strength in my arms
No existence bars opposed to our being
Just the satisfied thirst for living

Indeed I'll never know myself
In spite of my strong will
...And yet I thought I had walked so long...
