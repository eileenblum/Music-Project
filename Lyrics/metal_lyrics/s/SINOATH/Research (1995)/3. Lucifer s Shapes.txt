Reflection soon
Puts before you
A thousand questions
Temptation and sin
Just what a human being
Condemns through his eyes (but man judges man...)

Giving our life a sense
Why do we go so low?
Perhaps our thoughts, so intense
Make our weakness grow

Always so strong
And unfailing among
The asperities of life
But so weak in front of
What is unknown
Feeble but conscious
'cause to yield is to want
And the desire is all
For those who surrender
Parallel concepts
Touching eachother
In the sound of a silent echo...

A drop of instinct
In the rationality
Of an inner ocean
Or a sharp reflection
Lost in the passion (of a real life)

A derived choice
Or a suffocated voice
Influence our mind?
But without freedom
Just on your own
Are you sure to condemn what's wrong...
