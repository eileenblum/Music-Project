Faith ways
Faith. What's faith? You'll never know it.
'cause your soul is worn out (by sin)
It just closed your eyes since you did mistake
now infinity is waiting about

You're alone walking in a lake of tears
A breath of pain wraps around you and your blames
Lonely is the existance of your being
Of your nature, of your faith, of your name

How many will fall down
Down from the crying wall
All empty souls coming out
Out from their prison-world (no world)

Kissed by death you'll see just the dark
A veil of deceit that covers your eyes
Once you held out your hands, selling your conscience
To those ones who filled your mind with lies

Slowly raped by sententious commands
In this 'inferno' punishment for you is done
Sadly fading now your inner light dies
Roaming endlessly, your destiny is gone

Feel your life as it's starting to die
The truth is not what you've created
this false consciousness is an easier way
To hide yourself from what you just can't find

Snake shaped knife in your heart
Deep inside by the wings of doubt (remember)
Sin just closed your eyes since you did mistake
Now infinity is waiting about

...And the oppressive fear of knowing nothing
Ruthlessly turns into a certainty
A new kind of knowledge will rise
From the bottom of your enslaved soul now screaming:
...(no return)
