The sound of a desperate desire
A call from your own, frozen inside
Primitive, uncontrolled instinct
A wilder need standing by your side
Look at yourself, man. Trapped in your wishes
Reason doesn't act anymore
Only a primordial, corporal necessity
Strong as will in your thoughts

This truth mirrors the lies
You always try to deny
To your conscious mind...

Tough this extreme appetite
Natural outburst of sensations
Express your attitude in your lust
A concrete form of all your passions
Far from every ill-disposed outline
Just as pure as semplicity
Free as only man can be without
His morbid objectivity

Victim of an oppressing innocence
Your unhurt soul starts to bleed
As you realise you're powerless in front of
This reflection of your being

This truth mirrors the lies
You just cannot deny
To your conscious mind
To the whole mankind

This truth mirrors the lies
You just cannot deny
To your pale, conscious mind!
