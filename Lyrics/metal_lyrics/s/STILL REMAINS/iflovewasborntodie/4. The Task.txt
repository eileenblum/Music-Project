It is ongoing. I will never cease to give you my love. There are so many 
outside who try to intrude and disrupt. Will you cast your magic dust on 
them? Will they breathe it into their lungs? Will you show them your mercy 
if they give you thier hearts? My mission won't fail. I will not look 
astray. You won't sell out to me. You've got me hooked on your line. Keep 
pulling in toward you, that I won't turn away or blink. My love for you is a 
prison, my devotion is sealed away to tight. My mission won't fail. I will 
not look astray.My love for you is a prison, my devotion is sealed away to 
tight.
