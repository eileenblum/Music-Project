When I wake up, I want to see you. I need to hear you. I want to live your 
life. In my day. I fail to see. I fail to seek the one who gives life. I've 
looked away from your grace. You've been waiting at the gates. I'm running 
you're standing still. It's been so long since I've been here. It's time to 
come back again. It's time to make correction. Slain to the past. Recovery 
(ressurect me) undeserving. You love me still. You're love, I love. I've run 
away 1,000 times. I've run away for the last time. And I'm alone with 
bleedind and broken hands. It's been so long since I've seen your love. I'm 
running you're standing still. It's been so long since I've been here.
