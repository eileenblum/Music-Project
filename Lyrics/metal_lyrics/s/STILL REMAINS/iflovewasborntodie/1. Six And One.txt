I recall the words from your lips, your foot against my back. The stairs 
against my chest. I remember your footsteps behind me and the rest I've 
forgotten. 60 seconds to die-60 seconds to say my last goodbye. There's a 
time for remorse, there's a time for dying. You have no control, this is my 
time to live. 60 seconds to die-60 seconds to say my last goodbye. 1,000 
corners have coressed these tears. 1,000 tears have comforted these cheeks. 
Even under words I said nothing. I've laced my lips with wire to keep the 
words from your ears. So that the words I bleed arn't heard. So that the 
blood speak is unattainable. Let's sit down and talk about you and I. You 
were a child and I was one also. But when it comes to down to discussing the 
times I've got one thing on my mind. 60 seconds to die-60 seconds to say my 
last goodbye.
