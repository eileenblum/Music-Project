If love was this door, then I've slammed it in your face, ran out to the 
balcony and jumped to the ground. I've sponged the place in gasoline before 
igniting the foundation and burning it to ashes. If love was a plane, then 
I've flown it to the highest point, only to let it come crashing down to the 
Earth. Fasten your seatbelts, we're going down, we're going down now. If 
love was a child, then I've scolded him to no end. He's been filled with 
nothing inside. Until the day when bullets filled the emptiness inside him. 
From his own gun, from his own hands. Love became the pill that stopped his 
shakes. He's never crossed a man's face so hard. Love became the pill that 
put him under, he's never scratched a man's heart so deep. If love was born 
to die. Then I've buried him six feet under. If love was born to die then 
I've buried him six feet under. If love was a child, then I've scolded him 
to no end. He's been filled with nothing inside. Until the day when bullets 
filled the emptiness inside him. If you take the one and minus Him by 2, 
you've got the end of the world, before it's even begun. Although I've 
murded his heart, I can revive him with my own two hands.
