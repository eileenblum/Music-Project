Rays of light that pierce through leaves fall on our skin. We are allowed. 
We look skyward. His hands are glorious, maker of all. We are attached, to 
His every work. Wind, moves through our hair. Oh God, we feel Your spirit 
shining down on us. You're so beautiful. One chance to live this life. One 
chance to sacrifice. This treasure is wonderful. How could they be so numb. 
Rays of light that pierce through leaves fall on our bodies. We are allowed, 
we are skyborn. His hands are strong, Maker Of All. We attached to His every 
work. How could they be so dead not to love this. How could they love greed 
and not want his? How could they be so dead not to want this? How could they 
be so empty not to love this...not to love this precious life.
