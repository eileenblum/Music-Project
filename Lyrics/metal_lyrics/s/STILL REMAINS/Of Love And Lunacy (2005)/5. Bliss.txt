Feel the fire of our hearts, feel the flame of our desire
Alone we will find you, but alone we are
We are desperate for guidance,
We are looking for your direction
We are desperate for guidance
We are looking for your direction

Open our ears
You're almost like a shotgun ringing out with no objection
Open our ears
You're almost like a shotgun ringing out with no objection
Show us how to move like you do
We're moving now, we're moving now
Starve us so we will have this hunger
Let us look till we can look no more
Alone we are searching, but alone we are
Open our ears
You're almost like a shotgun ringin' out with no objection
Open our ears
You're almost like a shotgun ringin' out with no objection

Show us how to move like you do
We're moving now, we're moving now
Open our ears
You're almost like a shotgun ringing out with no objection
Open our ears
You're almost like a shotgun ringing out with no objection
Show us how to move
