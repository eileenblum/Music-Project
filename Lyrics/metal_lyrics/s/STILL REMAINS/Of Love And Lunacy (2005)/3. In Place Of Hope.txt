Farewell, farewell
Parting is such sweet sorrow
It's time to go now and I don't know if there will be tomorrow
It's her time to be the best she'll be forever, when she feels it
The pain she couldn't avoid... If only she could breathe
Let the little child run, run away
Let the little child fly, fly away
I wish I could kiss her cheek and tell her that I love her
It's not realistic in this life but maybe the other
I know these secrets
Sheâs been waiting for so long, but sheâll always just be gone
Let the little child run, run away
Let the little child fly, fly away
Might you have been my blood relation?
I will always think of you
I can't wait to meet you face to face
Face... to... face
Sheâs been waiting for so long, but sheâll always just be gone
It's her time be the best she'll be forever, when she feels it
The pain she couldn't avoid
If only she could breathe

Let the little child run, run away
Let the little child fly, fly away

Eternity comes within
For she'll always be the same
