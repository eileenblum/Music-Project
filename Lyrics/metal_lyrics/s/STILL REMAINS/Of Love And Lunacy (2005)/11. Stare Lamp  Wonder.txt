Through this window, I see my vision is crystal clear
It won't be long now
Never tainted
It won't be long now
Always crystal
The darkest night
I used to feel alive
Could we believe it?
Could they believe it?
I could feel the twisting in the wells of my inner self
Could we believe it?
Could they believe it?
It won't be long now... Never tainted... Always crystal
If seeing is believing, then this heart has never been beating
You should have let me live at least for one more day
Instead the silence takes me in vain
Everything you choose to say
Your piercing gaze
It rips my soul away
The darkest night
I used to feel alive
Could we believe it?
Could they believe it?
I could feel the twisting in the wells of my inner self
Could we believe it?
Could I believe it?

You should have let me live at least for one more day
Instead the silence takes me in vain

Through this window
I see my vision is crystal clear
It won't be long now
Never tainted
It won't be long now
Always crystal

If seeing is believing
Then this heart has never been beating

You should have let me live at least for one more day
Instead the silence takes me in vain

You should have let me live in vain
Just stare and wonder when I'm gone
Just stare and wonder why... You should have let me live
It won't be long nownever tainted always crystal
Just stare and wonder when I'm gone
Just stare and wonder why
