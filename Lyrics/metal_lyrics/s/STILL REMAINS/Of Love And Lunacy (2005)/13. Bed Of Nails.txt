Four words
Just give me someplace
Just put some burden on for a lifetime

Lay me down on a bed of nails
I need to suffer for a while
no pillow to rest my head
no blankets that won't distress
My guns with no regret
I'm ready and waiting

When I rise
When I rise you will be asleep tonight
When the morning comes I'll be yours
I'll be yours to your eyes

When you were right here you expected to see me alive
When you were right here you expected to see me alive

Four words
Just give me someplace
Just put some burden on for a lifetime
Lay me down on a bed of nails
I need to suffer for a while

When I rise
When I rise you will be asleep tonight
When the morning comes I'll be yours
I'll be yours to your eyes

For the first time in my life I finally fall into ruins
With the feeling whatsoever would have to sit down
It feels right

When I rise
When I rise you will be asleep tonight
When the morning comes I'll be yours
I'll be yours
I'll be yours (to your eyes
I'll be yours)
