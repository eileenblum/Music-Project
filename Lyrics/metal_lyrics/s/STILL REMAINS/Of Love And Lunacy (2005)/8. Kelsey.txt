He's held me for ransom for far too long
I don't care how much it hurts
I'll find the way to escape
Point his weapon straight at my head
The sooner you pull the trigger, the sooner I soak it all in
Take it from my steps
Take it from my words
Strip the images from my mind
Take the need to see to see from my eyes
I'll keep my foundation
I'll keep the tears
I'll share the bloodshed that you gave up for me
My hands have been bound for far too long
I don't care about the pain, I'll find the way to escape
If you
Point his weapon straight at my head
The sooner you pull the trigger , the sooner I soak it all in

Take it from my steps
Take it from my words
Strip the images from my mind
Take the need to see from my eyes
I'll keep my foundation
I'll keep the tears
I'll share the bloodshed that you gave up for me

Resist the torture of the millions
The downfall of an age
The fuel of our skin
The end of something beautiful
