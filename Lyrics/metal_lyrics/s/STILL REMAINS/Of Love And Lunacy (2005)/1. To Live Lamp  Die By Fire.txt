We've burned this city and it's coming down
Pack your bags, we leave at dawn
We move in cycles, the story is always the same
We take who we can with us, and then we get out
Burn. We watch it burn right before our eyes
There's no turning back now
Burn. We watch it burn right before our eyes
There's no turning back now
Fall to your knees and ask yourself
"Will we ever make it home?"
The question that remains will be lifted to the heavens
We've burned this city and it's crumbling
Grab your things we're leaving now
Onto the next one, I swear it's always the same
We take who we can with us and leave the rest in shame.
Shame Shame

Burn We watch it burn right before our eyes
There's no turning back now
Burn We watch it burn right before our eyes
There's no turning back now

We take who we can with us and leave the rest in shame
We take who we can with us and leave the rest in shame
Shame. Shame. Shame
