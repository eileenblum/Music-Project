Quite... Warm...
Unable to speak a single word
These white walls are taking me
Saying the words we mean to no one (we mean to no one)
It's the best way to kill the adolescent (the adolescent)
Familiar, restless, bleeding, constant
I've given my eyes away to darkness and locked all of the entrances
While visions of angels dance in my mind
Saying the words we mean to no one (we mean to no one)
It's the best way to kill the adolescent (the adolescent)
This world is a thief to our eyes
This world is a thief in disguise
If sight is lacking, take mine
If sight is lacking take my eyes
I can hear them calling
I can see them reaching out
They're speaking my name
They're pleading with my heart
I can hear them calling
I can see them reaching out
They're speaking my name
They're pleading with my heart

These white walls are taking me
These white walls are taking me
Familiar, restless, bleeding, constant
Saying the words we mean to no one (we mean to no one)
It's the best way to kill the adolescent (the adolescent)
I can hear them calling
I can see them reaching out
They're speaking my name
They're pleading with my heart
I can hear them calling
I can see them reaching out
They're speaking my name
They're pleading with my heart
