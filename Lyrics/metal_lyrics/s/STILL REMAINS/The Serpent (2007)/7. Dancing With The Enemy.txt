You look back, over your shoulder,
To see what could have been.
Do you want to see what used to be?
Someone you called friend?

Dance with me my enemy,
To finish what was lost.

These sheets we're wearing...
Perfect for the occasion.
This is where we dance tonight,
All that you have to do is keep what you held onto,
This is where we dance, tonight, tonight, tonight.

Voices talking, he said, she said,
I don't care about that.
This sensitive silence, between you and I,
I'll be the one to break it.

These sheets we're wearing...
Perfect for the occasion.
This is where we dance tonight,
All that you have to do is keep what you held onto,
This is where we dance, tonight, tonight, tonight.

Dance with me,
To Finish what was lost.
(finish what was lost)

Dance with me,
To Finish what was lost.
(Finish what was lost)

What was lost, (Lost)

These sheets we're wearing...
Perfect for the occasion.
This is where we dance tonight,
All that you have to do is keep what you held onto,
This is where we dance, tonight, tonight, tonight
