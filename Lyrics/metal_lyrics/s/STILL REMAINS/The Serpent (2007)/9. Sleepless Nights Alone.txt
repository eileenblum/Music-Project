At the end of all the earth
I find you here alone
At the forefront of my heart
And the butterflies
That tried to bring you life
Have died and gone away

Oh we are apart and I am lost
So while she sleeps, she dreams
We spend another sleepless night alone

You're so flirtatious with loneliness
And time just lingers on
We'll never become one
Forgot me, love
I've tried to bring you home
But I've died and gone away

Even if forever never comes
You're the only one
Who makes me come undone
