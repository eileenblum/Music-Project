Burn the candle down to the end!
In darkness I can't find a reason to pretend!
Make me see things that I don't want to see!
Images of someone, who I used to be!

This empty room is my companion.
My empty heart gives me compassion.

You gave all I have
And I'll never ask for anything from you.
You gave all I have
And I never wanted more.

Looking down, shards of glass beneath your skin!
I can't stand to see it. A mirror takes my sin!
Hold my head close to your heart!
I can hear it beating. Is this where it all starts?

Show me your scars!
Show me your scars!

This empty room is my companion.
My empty heart gives me compassion.

You gave all I have
And I'll never ask for anything from you.
You gave all I have
And I never wanted more.
You gave all I have
And I'll never ask for anything, anything from you.
You gave all I have
And I never wanted more.

Show me your scars!
Show me your scars!
