Hello
It's Been Another 2 years now
Since They've Put You away
Seasons Come and seasons go
As we cross our paths alone
and i just want you to know

I hope you disappear again
Wrong for now is wrong for then
Ahhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhh
theres hope this time you stay away
For all the beauty of today

Ohh.How
We keep meeting like this
Just like when i was a child
Weeks and months and years go by
as i was waiting here
and you still cant hold yourself together
Noo

I hope you disappear again
Wrong for now is wrong for then
Ahhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhh
The power of running away from you
Something now iv got to do
Ahhhhhhh

I hope you disappear again

[Guitar Solo + Drums]

The things you put before my eyes
Nothing far that don't disguise

I hope you disappear again
Wrong for now is wrong for then
Ahhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhh
