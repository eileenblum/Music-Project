Watching for you,
Conceived with no eyes.
Listen for the voice.
Plant within me, eyes that open.
Leading where I walk.

I feel I know you well,
If I were you I'd wait

[Chorus:]
Until someone moves or cares,
Stay captive.
Keep yourself there,
Wait for love. [x2]

I see everything,
Every move I make,
Painted before you.
Stall your move,
Heart that lingers.
I only move for you.

I feel I know you well,
If I were you I'd wait

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

Wait for love.

Until someone moves or cares,
Wait for love. [x4]
