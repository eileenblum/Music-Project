Found in your sheets, dead in your sleep.
I watch you drain as you're reaching for me.
No photographs left in the path.
No one will ask...where you've gone. Covered under rain and thunder.
Wash away the stains that I've created.
And I feel your heartbeat fail...
Oh, I am your worst nightmare.
No one will hear you scream
