Wishing someone would break my legs
A burden too heavy to bear
I've tasted the lips of the ancients
and witnessed the fall of hope, Hope
Like saviors to the planet we have risen
Taking out anyone in our path
Infiltrate the heart of the enemy
As they suck the stream of life
From the decapitation of jenova
To the drowning of aeris
Don't come even a little bit closer
Or I'll show you what this ultimate weapon is capable of.
Infecting, Infecting our soldiers
Petty experiments solely to find
The strongest breed of chaos
To further corrupt our world failed
