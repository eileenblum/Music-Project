Destroyed at birth
Crooked bloodline
Destined to be a failure
The moment I was dropped from your tree

Another unknown man
I could hear his voice
From the bedroom
You've tainted my fathers eyes.

A night for my brother
He was just a lonely child
I was chased back to sleep by your naked fists

Another discarded letter to you

Dear mother, now you know how it feels
I look back and I can't believe that it's real
Bound to grow up alone
so I could teach myself
How to never be like you
