The morning star appeared to feed on the weak of heart.
Pulled through the onslaught of struggle.
You won't find me here. You won't find me here.

Seek to devour there is a war in my head seeping out
There is a war.

Seeking. Fearing nothing but shadows...
...left from a whisper...

Prince of all pretensions chasing the sound of mind
Slipped through the cracks of intention.
You won't find me near. You won't find me near.

Seek to devour. There is a war in my head seeping out.

This is a war for no one else to see.
Fighting so we can be free.
Let go of your inhibitions.
This is a war!

Eye to the sightless eye. Face to the blistered face.
Bore to broken. Weak to the weakened man to crippled man.

This is a war for no one else to see.
Fighting so we can be free.
Let go of your inhibitions.
This is a war.

At long last... this chapter has come to an end.
We won't forget the memories. The starless nights up above.
...And the warmth of a summer fire.
Now that fire is burning our cities down
I can hear the echoes of our brothers
Screaming from the rooftops.

This is a war for no one else to see.
Fighting so we can be free.
Let go of your inhibitions.
This is a war for no one else to see.
Release your inhibitions.
This is a war.
