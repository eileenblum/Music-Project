Feeding off carcass left behind.
Telling all who have ears to hear it.
Feeding off carcass left behind.
Telling all who have ears to hear it.

Yet they stand behind their Faith.
You think you're found the answer?
You will be eaten alive.
Carry yourself all self righteous.
Only the meek will survive.

We hold the key.
And we are keeping secrets to empower.

I let myself go.
I won't go back to that place.
I will never let you go.
Never.

Lie yourself out.
Take away from me.
Tell your fabricated tale.
Cheat me how you will.

Somehow, some way
I'll take anything you throw at me.
He is but a wolf in sheep's clothing
And he will devour the kill.

I let myself go.
I won't go back to that place.
I will never let you go.
Never.

Building a wall of fire to hide face down, engulfed in flames.
There is a snake who will whisper sweet nothings into your ears my son
Turning temptations into litigations
Cleaver endeavors be done.

My sacred vow... this I swear
I will never surrender to the one that hunts you.
We hold the key.
We hold the secrets that empower you over destiny, over enemy,
Keeping secrets, holding vows, savor the moment.
Never surrender.

Lie. Keep this a secret.
Take. Keep this a secret from you.
Tell. Keep this a secret.
Cheat. Keep this a secret from you.
