Awake
This lack of sleep is killing me
Running from myself armed to the teeth
In a dream I become the hunted, stalked by my own hand
There is a candle burning from both ends
Put me down. Someone put me under. Say goodbye to validity

Awake until our final day
Until a black sun rises up
A blood red tide will sweep us all away

There is no end in sight
Until I walk this cold earth alone
This absent sleep is cutting deep, it's killing me
Searching for an end to exhaustion armed to the teeth
In a dream I can't recall what never was
The peace I never held. The comfort of silence

Awake until our final day
Until a black sun rises up
A blood red tide will sweep us all away

Vigilance eating it's way through like acid. Nothing will stand
Sinking lower and lower.. Everything turns black..
And my sight is lost
