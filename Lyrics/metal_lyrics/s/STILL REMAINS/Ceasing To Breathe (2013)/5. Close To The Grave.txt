In a blanket of ashes
Buried the willing after surrender
We had no choice
You lie in the bed that you make

Fleeing
Leading
Grieving
Leaving
See through and feeble
False
Misleading
Following after you
Leaving me through

Oh, your machine heartbeat is failing
Oh, your machine heartbeat's cold

Fear the sight
A shadow close to the grave
Heartless congregation
A shadow split your soul in two

Bow down
Bow down
Bow down to the face of coin
Bow down
Bow down
Bow down assume the vagrant
Your world is a hole
You'll never climb out of
I can hear your children grieving

Surrender in a field of corpses
You live a world that you burn
Chasing
Racing
Capture
Enslaving
Pray on the feeble
Like minded enraging
A dark hole swallows you
Just as you open your eyes

[2x]
Cover your head
Cheat to win
Uncover your face
Remove your skin

In your final day your children are grieving
The truth was burned away
A shadow split your soul in two
Closer to the grave

In your final day
The truth was burned away
A shadow
Closer to the grave
