In and out of consciousness
This vision comes to me again and again
A light without a flame

Embrace the end
Embrace the end of a needle

Cure sight and march
Another hallucination
Cure the night that fell within
Mislead by an aberration

Yesterday is gone
To fire to flame
Yesterday is gone
To fire to flame

All in all you watched me crawl from the ground
From fire from flame
Feasting on the eyes of another
The same eyes to see
Eyes to heal, eyes to burn

A prophecy came to me
Where torment is washed away
Focus clearly swallowed the edge of disaster
Walking on the edge of disaster

Cure sight and march
Another hallucination
Cure the night that fell within
Mislead by an aberration

Finally awake from a distance
Always loved you from a distance
Getting closer to your embraces
Becoming paralyzed in you

Take me with you on the edge of a needle
Take me with you on the edge of a needle

Take me with you
Take me with you
Take me with you
Take me with you
