Bare your teeth sneering smiling smirking
Bare witness to the old made new
To the walking sleepless death approaching silent

Innocent eyes fascinated
Fixated statues
Beneath the stone a sacred flow waiting and dormant

Awakened a burning light with claw and crown
Lie manifesting
The wings of angels crumble to the earth
Scatter the pieces as a child's treasure
O' searing anomaly with vampire's hunger craving helpless

Sink your teeth into me
I can see the spirit in your eyes and the passion undisguised
Take all of me
Bare your teeth
Inhale the life right out of me to fill your empty sea
Take all of me
Take all of me
Bare your teeth

The wings of angels crumble to the earth
Scatter the pieces as a child's treasure
O' searing anomaly with vampire's hunger

Sink your teeth into me
I can see the spirit in your eyes and the passion undisguised
Take all of me
Bare your teeth
Inhale the life right out of me to fill your empty sea
Take all of me
Take all of me

Take all of me
Take all of me

You will know the poison is moving through you quickly and you will know
When the fever sets in
When the fever sets in

Once you've turned there's no looking back
I lay myself before you where you can

Sink your teeth into me
I can see the spirit in your eyes and the passion undisguised
Take all of me
Bare your teeth
Inhale the life right out of me to fill your empty sea
Take all of me
Bare your teeth
