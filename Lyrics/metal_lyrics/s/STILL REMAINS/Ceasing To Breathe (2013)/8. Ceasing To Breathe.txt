Ceasing to breathe as you first appear
Set my heart ablaze
Gasping for breath
The coming of ages is finally upon me

There's nothing in this world that could pry you away
The innocence you hold brings me to my knees

Your touch, your love...
Every waking moment longing just to hold you near
Your touch, your love...
This search for your embrace
Desperation for your touch

Ceasing to breathe
Parting the seas for your coming arrival
Something within me
Fierce and relentless
Life itself dissipates

Your touch, your love...
Every waking moment longing just to hold you near
Your touch, your love...
This search for your embrace
Desperation for your touch

There is a place where two beating hearts connect and you will find me there
Where I am waiting for you
Follow the river of tears to where I am
This bottomless devotion and endless adulation...

I could spend forever in this place
We made it something so real

There's nothing in this world that could pry you away
The innocence you hold brings me to my knees

Your touch, your love...
Every waking moment longing just to hold you near
Your touch, your love...
This search for your embrace
Desperation for your touch
Your love...
