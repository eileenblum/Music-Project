You bring the cancer in every direction.
The snake from below will rise up and put you down.
Down, down.

Listen, an instance today.
Death beyond reason. Dismay.
Breathing a fire free of desire.
You're leading a thieving parade.

With what angst do you lead your pursuit?
With what angst do you lead?
Back down.
What you ingest and what you devour is only what you make it.

Seek me out in your silence.
Hold your tongue or be silent
Or you forever will be hopeless in despair.

Your home is a crippled caress.
Playing, enraging detest.
Your destination beyond devastation.
Your only strength your weakness.

On what grounds are you pointing your finger?
On what grounds you rebuke?

Mock. Pray.
Hurt. Pray.
Cut. Pray.
Lash. Pray.

Seek me out in your silence.
Hold your tongue or be silent
Or you forever will be hopeless in despair.
Hopeless in despair.

Death is but a vulture preying on your flesh.
Wake to the sound of your own voice screaming yourself out of bed.
Death is but a vulture preying on your flesh.
Wake to the sound of your own voice screaming yourself out of bed.

Seek me out in your silence.
Seek me out in shadows.
Hold your tongue or be silent.
Seek me out in your silence.
Seek me out in shadows.
Hold your tongue or be silent
Or you forever will be hopeless in despair.
Hopeless in despair.
Hopeless in despair.
Hopeless in despair.
