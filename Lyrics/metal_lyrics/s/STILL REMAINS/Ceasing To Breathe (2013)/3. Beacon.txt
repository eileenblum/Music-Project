Free yourself. Release.
Don't conform. Refuse.
You can breathe new life inside yourself.
Run into the looming storm.

A sun will rise and a brand new day is born.
The evening breathes a setting sun to sleep.

Walk. A lantern within.

Shine straight down below.
You can breathe new life inside yourself.
And run into the looming storm.

A sun will rise and a brand new day is born.
The evening breathes a setting sun to sleep.

We will finish what we have started.
We won't become one of the departed ones
And fall.

We won't become one of the departed and fall.

Writhing in darkness.
Writhing in chaos.

We will finish what we have started.
We won't become one of the departed ones.
We will finish what we have started.
We won't become one of the departed ones.
