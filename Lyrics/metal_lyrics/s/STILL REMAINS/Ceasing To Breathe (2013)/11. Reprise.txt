Watched you come so far.
Shined like a blackened star.
Watched you get torn apart with the teeth of a broken heart.
A widow dressed in black spins her web.

We watched you rise. Fall.
We rise together and fall for the better.
Live. Die.
Live for each other and die for another.
Reprise.

Watched her crawl so far.
Held her in his arms.
She'd broken their hearts and broken their minds.
Her venom ate through their lives.

Rise. Fall.
We rise together and fall for the better.
Live. Die.
Live for each other and die for another.

Contemptuous. Sardonic.
Let her be a widow dressed in black.

She will not face you.
She will not face you.
She will not face you.
She will not...

She will not face you.
She will not face you.
She will not face you.
She will not face you.

Go hungry for ruin.
Tangled in evil.
Ever so fearless, this blackened priestess.
Deceitful Sorceress.
Blinded by her own shroud.
She was always too proud.
The king with no master reigns in disaster.
Reigns in disaster.

Rise. Fall.
We rise together and fall for the better.
Live. Die.
Live for each other and die for another.

Rise. Fall.
We rise together and fall for the better.
Live. Die.
Live for each other and die for another.

Watched her crawl so far.
She will not face you.
Let her be a widow dressed in black.
Let her poison another fellow.
She broke their hearts and minds.
Watched her crawl so far.
