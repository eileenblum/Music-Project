Mystical powers grabs your neck 
The Lord of light shall rise again 
From a cold and dark sphere, 
known as bright and love eternal 
Hide behind the word of god 
Slice the flesh with heavens sword 
Meet the demon of all demons, 
from above in the dark enigma 

Believe in God or you will die 
Torture is my very friend 
Side by side we all shall walk 
towards heaven, nailed by god 
Enigma Grotesque 
You will never see a common sphere 
without God and me 

In the light divine, 
forever lay to rot 
You'll have eternal life 
as the slaughter of your faith 
Come and drink with me 
your wine is sour 
and you'll be pleased with me 
you cannot fool me...to believe or die 

I am the story told 
and I am the untold 
It's written down by man 
It's written, but not true 
My place is peacefully 
for the brainwashed, not for me 
Pain is forever peace 
I shall be the one...who takes command 

Enigma grotesque 
You will never see, a common sphere 
without God and me
