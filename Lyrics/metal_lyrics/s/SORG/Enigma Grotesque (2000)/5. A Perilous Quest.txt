Our burden is great 
Hopes of mankind been carried away 
Hope is in truly tiny, 
like snow on a damp summers day 

Behold the Hoarwell 
The river of the troll falls, 
of the northern moores 

Far beyond the trollshaws 
The darkness arises 
On icy fellwinds 
On a damp summers day 

The price of the nine is abroad 
The Witchking, the warden of the north 

Here lies our perilous path 
In veils of destiny...entwined 

At dawn, through the realms of ice we walk 
Like thieves at nightstalk 
Into the dragons Den, the iron fortress 
To complete our perilous quest
