Let me dream now, let my life be the thing 
Life with meaning, let me hope so I can live 
Let me see now, the storm you ride through me 
The Sight within 
Let me trust so I can see 

Lock me under, deep...I wonder 
Healing, feeling 
Children's voice, makes new noises 
Don't break their choices to be heard 

Let me see 
the storm you ride through me 

Let me see now, the storm you ride through me 
The sight within, let me trust so I can see 
Let me be now, let your life be my thing 
The life with meaning 
Let me be so I can breath 

Let me see 
the storm you ride through me 
Children's voices makes new noises 
Don't break their choises to be heard 

Lock me under, deep...I wonder...
