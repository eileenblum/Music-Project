Take my hand and walk with me 
Into the bridge of eternity 
With my soul my body dies painfully 
Help me now or not the mourning of... 

Tears and sadness withers away 
To arise from it's sleep 
And carry out the human burials 
Reincarnation of the flesh, torn away from it's womb 

Reconstructed existence of the darkness 
Intense destruction of an ancient time 
Plagues and suffering tearing through the soil 
What's unbegan is now to become reality 

The sky turns black above me 
To Form a portal to oblivion 
Locusts rising from the earth 
Oceans boiling in blood
