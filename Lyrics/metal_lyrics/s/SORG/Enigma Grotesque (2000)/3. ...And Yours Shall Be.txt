Through pain I became 
Servants make way 
Make way all gods 
Look at me, now learn to fly 

With my flesh my ravens came 
With my tears I drowned the flames of love 
With my will came evil lust 
And I shall cover the sun...eternally 

Carved by the claws of the unholy beast 
Divine scars, thy blood is black 
Serpents, hear me now 
Blow your winds, consume the earth 
Through pain I was made to rule 

Kneel now, and I'll spear your life 
Flow through the gate into my realm 
Be one, serve me 
No one else, only me 

Now I'm strong enough to walk above your realm 
Come with me, and Yours shall be mine...
