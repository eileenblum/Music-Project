I see them coming 
I feel their wrath 
My throne is falling 
Cold demonical eyes impales me 
Like gigantic needles through my skin 

I will die in the chambers of oblivion, 
Tears flows out of my eyes 

In the chambers of oblivion 
I'll die 
Tears flows out of my eyes 
As I step into eternity...eternally 

Hypocrites calls upon my gate 
They've conquered my flesh 
Blood dribbles from my ears, 
As the emperor speaks to me: 
"We haven't forget your sins, 
From our lives in obscurity we'll have our vengeance, 
a new kingdom shall be born, 
created by us who you've pushed away, 
your testament is written..." 

Help me... 

Supreme below
