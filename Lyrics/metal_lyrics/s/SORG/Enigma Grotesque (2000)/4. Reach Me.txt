Please me 
Reach me 
Be the sun for a while 
To forgive the cloud 
Who made you fall for a while 
You'll learn how to climb 

Would you fly again, would you fly again 
Would you cry again 

Please me 
Reach me 
Be my sun 
You'll learn how to climb 

"How does it feel when the dark haunts you, 
when the tears you cry dries in, 
when the spring that made promises 
broke your golden dreams" 

Would you fly again 
Could you try again 
Would you cry again 
Could you try again
