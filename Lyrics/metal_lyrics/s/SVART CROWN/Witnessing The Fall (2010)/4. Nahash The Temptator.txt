Searching the sense of light
Climbing the mountains of knowledge
Where sit the different secrets of men

Cursed, banish ans shameless
Trough the chasm where the earth is born
Captor and brieber are my names

Over, and over I push to the fault
Standing, awaiting your fall

Toxic alienation
Ways of perdition
Axis of daviance
I deliver the psycho

I found the truth at the bottom of darkness
The black light is in my hand

Forbidden, forbidden are the fruits of thy garden
Rotten are the entrails of Sacred
The word, the flesh, the essence
The dark stain... I inject the venom called revolt

Blinded by this lie, you, sinner
Awaiting a final absolution
It's time to know its true nature
Take the power of truth, the unowable way
Nahash mecharete mitsade ah'ere dÃ©reh

I would be held in front of you
Elected by you
Corrupted by the doubt
With an instinct of betrayal

The foretold judgement
Divine anger
The final redemption is nothing

I no longer expect
Anything from the one
Who betrayed me

I will spit on your morals
I will turn toward
This other light and denied your name
