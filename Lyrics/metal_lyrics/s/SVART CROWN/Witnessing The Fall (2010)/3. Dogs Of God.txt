Become my slave
Worship me like I deserve
Pray, slaye, pray
Bow down to my feet

Slave
Serve me as a submissive bitch
Revere your master
I am superior and you're just a shit
Your life reduced to venerate
The honor due to my rank

Dust before greatness and superiority
You belong to me

Educated, blasted, I develop
Your own self-denial
I'm the perfection, learn to deserve me

Hear all my orders
Your debasement is my pleasure
I'm your opium
The lack witch your demand.
The final worship

Embrace the huge

Call me the master of all
Call me the all

Dogs of God

Beg for your life
Beg for your pain

Without you I'm nothing
A lost idol
