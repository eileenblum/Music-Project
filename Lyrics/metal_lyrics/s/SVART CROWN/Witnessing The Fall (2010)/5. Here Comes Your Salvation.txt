Chosen for the sin that consumes you
In search of endless pleasure
Our sanctuary of lust open to you

This quest leads your life
Your obsession keeps growing
Now your spell is fixed

Enter, enter in the circle of supplices
Nothing will never be the same

Contemplate these faces deformed by the desire and fear
All the bodies in convulsion, broken by pain

Dominated
I penetrated you as an animal
The suffocating smell of your fear
Mixed to filth and hatred
I threw on you all disease which lives in me

Humbled and cleansed
I see your groans of shame
You lost all dignity

This quest leads your life
Your obsession keeps growing
Now your spell is fixed

Blasted
I penetrated you as an animal
The suffocating smell of your fear
Mixed to filth and hatred
I threw on you all disease which lives in me

Broken
I penetrated you as an animal
The suffocating smell of your fear
Mixed to filth and hatred
I threw on you all disease which lives in me
