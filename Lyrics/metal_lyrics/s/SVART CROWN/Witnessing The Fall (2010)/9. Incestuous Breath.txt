Born in a squirt of a mother whore
Left, the liquid redeemer
Trembling in a pool of blood, kneaded by fear
The sin is on me, the sin is on me
Purifies the son

And breath this incestuous sin

Impure, impure child
Son of perdition
Eyes injected of hate
Veiled and burning

Impure, impure child
Son of perdition
The color is black
Impossible to pacify

Here I am, the servant, the shame
The bastard in this corrupted life
The unborn, the plague
The squirt of rage
