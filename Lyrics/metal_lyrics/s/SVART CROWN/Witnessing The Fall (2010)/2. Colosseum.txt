An hostile sun overhangs
The shadow of lie
Open your scars
The bloodthirsty crowd
Executioner of your last hours
Judge of your end, banish your faith
A spit of hatred, hold your breath.

The refusal

Colosseum. Sanctuary of your end.

The fire begins, to consume you.
The stench of your body
Burning until your blood turns black

You will rot as a slaughtered pig waiting for a sign
Behold the human realm decadent

Redemption and purity
Salvation and martyr
We shall disable your eyes, blinded by this faith

The supreme sacrifice.
Delivered to the beasts
Blasted and cursed
For eternity

You will rot as a slaughtered pig waiting for a sign
Behold the human realm decadent
