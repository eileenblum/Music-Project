Scars of Jesus Christ make it the blame of child
Make it the blame of god
Wound of laceration before crucifixion
Make it the blame of son of god

The way of penitence do in silence
The crown is fixing on the head of the king

Into his eyes, I see the lies, I see the pain
Before his kindness I see the madness to control human race
Before his tears, I hear his scream like a pig
Spit on his faith lance on it be humanity reject his reign

A long pain for a judgment, heaven tear's flow on his head
Many blown deform your face your corpse live but yours soul his dead
On your crosses you pray in vain
Nobody listen your pain
You wait a sign and crawl comes you dream fall in mains
