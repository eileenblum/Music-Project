Alone in a catacomb , slave of the time
Surround by the putrescence and a pack of rats
The skull fixing on a side show your destiny
The night wake up the death and take your breeve

You are shut away for ever
The time represent your last hours
The flame unlight your coffin
Pray your safety is nothing

You perish in catacomb
Noboby see your tomb
You perish in catacomb
Nobody see your fucking tomb
