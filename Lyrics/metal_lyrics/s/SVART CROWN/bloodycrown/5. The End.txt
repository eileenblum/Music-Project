When the ground way out under your foot
When the night not will the moon
When the sun burn your chair without death
You are proch of the end

World funeral, coming soon with apocalypse
World of disease bring the smell of death

I cry
Emptiness is cause of murder
World died
Death take the smell of flower

A world of madness a part of humanity is the final
Way of darkness drive mens to the abyss for endless
