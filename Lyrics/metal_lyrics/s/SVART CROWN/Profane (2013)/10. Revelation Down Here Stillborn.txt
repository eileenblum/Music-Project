Down here undead

Swarm of error
Reveals a veiled sky and pierced
Withdrawn
Withdrawn to the source where the light never end

Descent of terror
The call was heard, denied and rejected
Return
Return to an exile for eternity

All that remains
Source of end

Abscess devours as a cancer

Awaiting the erode
The time of salvation
Awaiting the erode
The purge or the infection

Cut the plague limb

Awaiting the erode
The time of salvation
Awaiting the erode
The purge or the infection

Here and now
Will be demise
Lost and rejected
Face drowned to our sins

Swarm of error
Reveals a veiled sky and pierced
Withdrawn
Withdrawn to the source where the light never end

Our become is our enemy
Our nature is our enemy

Our nature
