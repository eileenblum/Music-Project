Astray, reclushed in the blur of mind
Searching the weakness
The disease of souls
Infects what makes you a man

Blackest wounds are deep open
Dignity's rape, down on her knees
Dying hopes forms the leather
Flogging the skin
In an absence of salvation

As the plague among rats
Crawling underground
Leaving the corpse moaning in sewers
No one quits the life surrounded

Miasma rising among the crowd
Until the last breath, close to dying

A colourless pit as way for the end, nothing for reward
The mind removes a step beyond the light
Lef the worthless to the fire,
and the soul to the void
