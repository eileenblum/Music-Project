Prayer
Purge
Salvia

Free
Fall in a place
Straight forward
Without outline
Flee deep inside me
I can't open my eyes

Burning as a fever
Facing the light which reveals
The details of... Carnage

Lost 
Through these vapors
Nothing is real
Reign a silence
Oozing disease

Burning as a fever
Facing the light which reveals
The details of... Carnage

Prayer
Purge
Saliva

Free
Fall in a place

Straight forward
Without outline

Flee deep inside me
I can't open my eyes
Burning as a fever

Facing the light which reveals
The details of... Carnage

Hands down
Feel nothing
Clear sightedness and confusion
No memory, no future

Purge the repugnant blood
Tear of its own descent
Plunged into darkness
