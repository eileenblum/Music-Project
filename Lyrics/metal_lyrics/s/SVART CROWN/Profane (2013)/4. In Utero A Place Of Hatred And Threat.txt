Repent

Infested with heresy
A desperate cruelty
An accomplice of the depths
In the heart of its bad
Drain
Pull this cancer out of his womb

Monozygotic twins
Born from the same cell
Two fetuses
A place of hatred and threat
Fueled by the red line of madness

Dominant and dominated
Possessed desecrate
Everything petrified
In the heart of its bad
Drain
Pull this cancer out of his womb

Skin studded of burns
Skin studded of scars
Crush butts on a gray flesh
Spit these nails
Over and over again
To purify his tummy

Vice who lived from intrauterine life
Who devours the last hope of life

It's on me
It's on me

Keep the dead devil in his belly

It's on me
It's on me

Infected
Poisoning the water
Infiltrated
The liquid of life

Infested / Rejected
Infiltrated / Impregnated

Infected
Poisoning the water
Infiltrated
The liquid of life

Deliver / Invoker
Revocate the bastard son
