Face on the ground
Eyes on the scar
Taste of the wound
Murder

Skin overpassed
Blood on the glass
Knife oversized
Butcher

Health for the young
Strength of a prong
Deep in a throat
Fiding your savior
Savior

Mentally
I lost every conscience

Therapy of flesh is running on

Mortals
I'm leaving your ground

God told me that I could
The gift of pain is leading my soul

Threat - Keep - Fuck
Rape - Kill - Cut
Laugh - Scream - Hug
Watch - Smile - Burn

Pleasure makes me glowing

Mortals
I'm leaving your ground

The gift of pain is leading my soul

Guilty
Contempling the agony
The flesh is feeding me
The flesh is killing me

Guilty
Sacrifice from a fury
Strength of a prong
Deep in the throat
Fiding your savior
Savior

Guilty
Contempling the agony
The flesh is feeding me
The flesh is killing me

Guilty
Sacrifice from a fury
The flesh is feeding me
The flesh is killing me
