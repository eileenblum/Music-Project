Blackened by the fire of genes
Two pupils split rotten
Drowned in blood
Used in pasture
To our divine creators

This shit in the lungs
Reminds me of the source and origin

Piss in the nostrils
And grime in the throat
Fruit of holy abjection

Completely emptied
Glory to the foolproof architect

There's no god, there's no men, there's no world

Ugly trophy
Blind genitor
Contemplate your own creation

Amen

Innoxculate the poison: beginning
Intoxicate the liquid of life

Emasculated
Horrifying reality

The root, the gallow, the chasm

Bringer of misery

Gensis architect
