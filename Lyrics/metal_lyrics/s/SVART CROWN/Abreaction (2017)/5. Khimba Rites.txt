Trance 
Shadow
Fear
Tears on your face

Abandoned by the night
Wild punishment
Rite of passage

Falling with the snake
To confront this hostile world
This hostile world

Khimba
Suspended time
Khimba
Protect the tribe

Khimba
The progenies
The white clay

Die, die, my son
Share to be reborn
Meet this new life
Becoming the brother,
The father,
A leader

Falling with the snake
To confront this hostile world

Khimba rites

[2x]
I hear the ancient
Who show me the path
Plunging into my symbolic death
I feel the power
The secret poison
The suffering incise in my flesh
