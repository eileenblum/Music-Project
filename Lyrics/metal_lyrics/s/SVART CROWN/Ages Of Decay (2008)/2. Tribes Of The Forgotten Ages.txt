Swarms of deadly claws will blackened the land
The world will become a fucking grave
Feeding their unspeakable reign
Tribes of the forgotten ages

Drenched in madness of forgotten ages
Lived a horde
Heartless faithless
Drawing their strength in inhumanity

Primitive
Barbarism
Hybrid
Seeds
Starving for flesh spreading disease and pain

Cannibals dismembering their preys in frenetic screams
Bestiality fornicating, growling beside their ripped victims
They march conquering and devastating, raping the earth
Where no life will never dwell again

Abject believes people soon will rise
Craving to end their slavish fate

Deviant rites
Fallen idols

Swarms of deadly claws will blackened the land
The world will become a fucking grave
Feeding their unspeakable reign
Tribes of the forgotten ages
