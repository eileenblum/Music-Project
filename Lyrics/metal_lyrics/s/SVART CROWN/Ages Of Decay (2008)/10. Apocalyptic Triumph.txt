And heaven becomes earth's takes
Burning of virtue leads to despair
Final cataclysm on everything

It's time for suffering and chaos
As impressive as evil
This fire mountain, shewed by corpses
Leads all life, lead all life to nothing

Painful scream echoes, like a morbid chair
This macabre ensemble plays it most destructive tunes

It's the end of a world convicted to oblivion
It's the end of a world drench in fear
Now begin the relentless
Reign! Now begin the relentless

Reign of apocalyptic triumph!

The final battle is over
Brutal implacable
Now begins the relentless
Reign of the apocalyptic triumph

The final battle is over
The final battle brutal implacable

Apocalyptic triumph!
