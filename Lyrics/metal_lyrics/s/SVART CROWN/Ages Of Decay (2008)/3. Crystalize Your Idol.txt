As night falls over the land
A Stygian fog slowly threads
The bright moon rises to lightened
The insane march of the undeads

Feel, hear
This summoning lamentation
See, fear
The corruption of the flesh

Serve, swear
Allegiance to the idols
Dead, soul
Never find the final rest

The spirit is viciously enslaved
As the body sleeps underground
Death becomes almost alive

Feel, hear
This summoning lamentation
See, fear
The corruption of the flesh

Serve, swear
Allegiance to the idols
Dead, soul
Never find the final rest

Rotten corpses exhumed to serve
Holy idols crystallize in death

Open the gates, open for me
Open the gates, the realm of death... waits for me
