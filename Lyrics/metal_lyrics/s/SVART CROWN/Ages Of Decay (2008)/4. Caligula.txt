Blessed by all the unconscious priests while betraying this own blood
Hail to the new emperor, let's sculpt the throne of hate
The enemies of this unavoidable rise
By this madness, soon will be condemned

Tyrannic power, serve his will or die !
Fulfill these insane designs, blinded by the fear
Blinded by the fear !
Born, from his wrath deviant destiny
Maniac progent, incestual reign

Prisoner of his urges and vices, slaughtering decay
Domination ends !

Blessed by all the unconscious priests while betraying this own blood
Hail to the new emperor, let's sculpt the throne of hate
The enemies of this unavoidable rise
By this madness, soon will be condemned

Whispers into the dark
The blades are shining in his back

Their last bow became a murder
But until he'll took his last breath

His dreadful aura will surround them all

Caligula!
