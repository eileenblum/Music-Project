Under a blackened sun
Thousand of crows foretell
The beginning of the new era
Plague takes her dominion
And black hordes survey a world divided
The deadly harvest has begun
Hell is unleashing on earth

Funeral procession instead of mass
The god of perdition has forgotten you

Under a blackened sun
Thousand of crows foretell
The beginning of the new era
Plague takes her dominion
And black hordes survey a world divided
The deadly harvest has begun

Contemplate your scattered brothers
Screaming in their slow agony
The Prophecy; the mark of Lucifer

Under a blackened sun
Thousand of crows foretell
The beginning of the new era
Plague takes her pestilential rising
