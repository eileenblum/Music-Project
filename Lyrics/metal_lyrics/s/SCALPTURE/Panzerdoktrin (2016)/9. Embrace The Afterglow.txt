At dusk there sits the widowed wife
And gaze across the oceans tide
Drifting on the afterlife
Her youngest daughter by her side

Across the sea her husband lies
Tears well up while memories fly
A setting sun, a hope that dies
As she speaks her last goodbye

The father,
The married man,
The beloved son
The bestest friend

For the dead we lament
Is given this monument
So memories won't fade to black
Devoted to those
Who never come back

At dawn they launched another wave
In which the man was washed away
In this storm he found his grave
He lived and fought and died that day

And as the wife lies down and cries
Oh the sadness, oh the woe
Sun shines into tear-clogged eyes
And reflects the afterglow

The father,
The married man,
The beloved son
The bestest friend

For the dead we lament
Is given this monument
So memories won't fade to black
Devoted to those
Who never come back

In distant fields
The poppies blow
Beneath the crosses
Row on row
And in this sorrow
I embrace the afterglow
...I embrace the afterglow
