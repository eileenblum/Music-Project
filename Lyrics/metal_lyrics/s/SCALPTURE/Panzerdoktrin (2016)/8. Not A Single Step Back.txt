Go!
Resist or to die
The order is clear
No advantage for them after here

In difficulties
And under attack
We don't ever go
A single step back
Not a single step back!

A border to keep
A frontline to hold
Brace yourself, reload and then go

In difficulties
And under attack
We don't ever go
A single step back

And as a thousand suns burn down
We'd be never overthrown
And to the cannons last one breath
Not one step back!

Brace yourself, reload and then go

In difficulties
And under attack
We don't ever go
A single step back

Not a single step back
