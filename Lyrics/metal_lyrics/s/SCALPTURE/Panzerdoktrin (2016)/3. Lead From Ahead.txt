Leading
In the eye of the storm
Control
Operate and reform

One of many
But always the first
Whenever it burns
Wherever it bursts

Action framework
Clarified
Go ahead
Take the sides
Combined forces
Infantry
Adversaries
On their knees

Pressure
Exerted and increased
Barrage
That never ceased

High speed movement
On killing ground
Devastating
Mortar sound

Action framework
Clarified
Go ahead
Take the sides
Combined forces
Infantry
Adversaries
On their knees
