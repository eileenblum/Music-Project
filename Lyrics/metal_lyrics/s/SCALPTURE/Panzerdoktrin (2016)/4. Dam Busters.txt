England's finest
The airborne elite
A seasoned band of airmen
The best of their breed
Experienced in dogfight
They kept their air space clean
Chosen for a higher task
Squadron 617

Dam Busters, air raider, coming for you
Le Deluge, vient apres nous

Lancaster Bombers
Turning the tide
Approaching hostile coastline
In low-level flight

Aiming at the dams
Terrorise the Hun
Unleash the Moral Bombing,
âTallboysâ sing their song

Dam Busters, night bomber, coming for you
Le Deluge, vient apres nous

Some never returned
Blood of England's blood
Honoured as a Dam Buster
And after us the Flood...
