Superior in range
Known for their persistence
Tank howitzers charge
Deadly from the distance

A rolling thunder
Of death in the air
Everyone though not in sight is
Baptised in despair

The howitzers start singing
Their repetitious lay
A penetrating cannon anthem
Baptism in flames

Salvos from the back
A pouring steel rain
Tank howitzers charge
Until everything is plane

A rolling thunder
Of death in the air
Everyone though not in sight is
Baptised in despair

The howitzers keep singing
Their repetitious lay
A penetrating cannon anthem
Paving way

The howitzers keep singing
'Til everyone is dead
The howitzers repeating
'Til the horizons are flat...

Another round
Another chant
Howitzer-Choir
Panzerhaubitzen...
Feuer!
