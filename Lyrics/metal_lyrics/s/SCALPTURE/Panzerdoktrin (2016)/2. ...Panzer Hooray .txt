Hooray!
Four men inside an armoured heart
A pack of big cats four
Approaching iron carnivores

One eyed beasts endued with steel
Killer naturally born
Take the bull by its horns!

Vibrant are the predetors
On their hunting ground
Chase the prey and hunt it down

All-devouring overeater
Nothing's left alive
As these Huntresses arrive

Riding through the freezing cold
Or through the scorching day
Gaining the initiative
Death on its way

Big cats roam the battlefield
Once more into the fray
Snap to Attention!
Panzer Hooray!

Following a Doctrine
Of a fast and vivid war
In which movement is a law

Tanks create a driven hunt
Cats extend their claws
Wildcats never withdraw

Riding through the freezing cold
Or through the scorching day
Gaining the initiative

Eath on its way
Big cats roam the battlefield
Once more into the fray
Snap to Attention!
Panzer Hooray!
