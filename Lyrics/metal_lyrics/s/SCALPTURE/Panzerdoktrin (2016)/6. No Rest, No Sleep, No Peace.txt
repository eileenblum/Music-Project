An armoured skin
A frightful swarm
A Panzerarmy

Sowed the wind
Now rides the storm
Forward Division

The sound of engines
And smell of benzine
War beyond comprehension

A stamping horde
A constant threat
Sowed the wind

Be the Anvil
Reap the storm
Resist the hammer head

Tensions growing
A war ongoing
Tank tracks glowing
A storm is blowing

No rest,
No sleep,
No peace!

An armoured skin
A frightful swarm
A Panzerarmy

Sowed the wind
Now rides the storm
Forward Division

Vacated trenches
Shattered defences
The storm enhances
This storm is endless

No rest,
No sleep,
No fucking peace!
