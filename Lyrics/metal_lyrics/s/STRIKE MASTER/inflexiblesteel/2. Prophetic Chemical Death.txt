[Music: Camou/Chavez, lyrics: Camou]

Peaceful here nothing but death,
chemical anemia terminated their...
...Experimental demise, science denies
another went wrong a man expired for a dime.
A bloody diarrhea it's the first
station to a painful death
Shocking confusion, twelve month somnolence,
our body is our jail and radiation our climate.

Blood runs read down your nose and your threat
Liquid brains flow from ears to the floor
Dying heart, dying eyes, mind collapse
There is no emergency procedure
in case of this toxical spill!!!

[Chorus:]
Erasing the trace of life
Prophetic chemical death!!!

No sense to run; run for your life,
now that the chemical has spread in the place
Don't be afraid just stay away,
now you're contagious you can kill everyone
Now realize you have been set,
to be the white mouse a substance consumes
Something's for sure, you will die in the lab.
No one has to know that is the mess fucked you up

Reach on the phone; tell wife that you love,
to kiss the children from your last goodnight
A life of work, flushed in a blink,
not even level price is ready for this
Fucking get ready for a big funeral,
every award will be buried with you
Wish you were home with your family and dog,
now you lay dying as a government whore

[Chorus:]
Erasing the trace of life
Prophetic chemical death!!!
