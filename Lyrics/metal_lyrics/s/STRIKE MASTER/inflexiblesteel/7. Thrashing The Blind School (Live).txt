senseless violence brains slammed in the floor 
a restless persecution, to brutalize on the reflexive answer 
never to mess with 
blessed with madness malnourished soldier. Made to order maddening 
repressive rerquisition to march in the line. Kill at pro death will 

winged agressor rockoning at midnight. Armed with a .50 caliber 
broke glass, lone night, a midnight dancer. Lock and load prepare 
cross the line you will receive some fire. Full combat awaits 
hellish units, long haired drunk men. Guns and alcohol 

Talking with sadism my name is violence! 
dreaming with death and i'm thrashing the blind school 
thrashing the blind school 

cyclonic striker to crash into heaves, negative revenge 
unblessed bible, have sex on the altar, do you really give a fuck 
nightmare chasing on a high speed hell race. I only live to die 
serve yourself, the dinner is set with a corpse and blood red wine 

Talking with sadism my name is violence! 
dreaming with death and i'm thrashing the blind school 
thrashing the blind school 

a close reflection to a bombed sponge mind, 
brain infection and a mass perversion, 
my war is based on my self education, 
atrocity comes to be my self salvation 

to reactivate the guillotine redemption 
deaf ears to diplomatic conversation 
to still some throats it is my presentation 
genocide you all have invitation 

thrashing the blind school!
