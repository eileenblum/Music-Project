[Music: Camou/Chavez, lyrics: Camou]

Hello my name is Jesus
I'm singing no to save your soul
I'm living in a room mad of steel
Pure filth and disgrace of this life
With one hand i hold the fork with my food
With the other the knife ti defend it
There is no one to tell me I'm doing wrong
I live for Judas Priest and not for Jesus Christ!!!

[Chorus:]
Fuck authority!
Fuck your standard ways!
Fuck fancy people!
Go die through life's decay!
Just dare to fuck around here
It'll only end up with your own demise
Street's way of living
Pure Mexican Steel to the core!!!

Hello my name is Jesus

Fuck fancy people!
Go die through life's decay!
Just dare to fuck around here
It'll only end up with your own demise
Street's way of living
Pure Mexican Steel to the core!!!

I am the dirty messiah
Messiah of the damned on the street
Thousands like me live in darkness
Just wait, we will come all over you

[Chorus:]
Fuck authority!
Fuck your standard ways!
Fuck fancy people!
Go die through life's decay!
Just dare to fuck around here
It'll only end up with your own demise
Street's way of living
Pure Mexican Steel to the core!!!
