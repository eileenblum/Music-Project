[Music: Camou/Chavez, lyrics: Camou]

Revengeful bellicosity is the new dawn
for true ones, mandatory honor war
Hygienic extermination to prevail forever,
an honor measure to be taken.

Iron horse, thunder belt, the new sky rider
with a thousands tons of heavy metal
The hardest steel is forged on the hottest fire,
the Omen's prophecy reveal

Phoenix-like thrash metal resurrection,
from ashes it comes back to life
The clean sweep operation now that the house
is dirty no weak one shall be left alive
A kingdom of vicious metal madmen
rising up again on earth
A legacy of heavy war and mighty metal,
an axeman and a beast to reign

[Chorus:]
Unmerciful invisible and inflexible
Metal crusade
Metal, hell, thrashing attack
Mortal embrace
Inflexible steel, pullback and attack
Inflexible steel, pullback and attack

Sanctuary of glory rising warriors
death &amp; blood before dishonor
Metal institution, not a prostitution
our creed represent our way:
Die by the edge of our mighty class steel,
fall into the pits of doom
Die by the edge of our mighty class steel,
fall into the pits of doom

[Chorus:]
Unmerciful invisible and inflexible
Metal crusade
Metal, hell, thrashing attack
Mortal embrace
Inflexible steel, pullback and attack
Inflexible steel, pullback and attack

[Solo: Kenny Powel]
