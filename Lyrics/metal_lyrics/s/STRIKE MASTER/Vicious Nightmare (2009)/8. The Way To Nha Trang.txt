Sailing up the river, M16 in hand.
Special force commando for a mission classified
Captain on a mission out to drown in hell,
a killer sent to nail a killer to cease insanity
Napalm served for breakfast, give me some room to breathe,
the "death cards" will let
Charlie know who kicked his ass for real
No worries my children, you're safe flying with me, the air-cav will
beach party because Charlie don't surf!
It's the PBR street gang! On a hairy way Nha Trang
Walk around the jungle, searching for a mango,
you'll only get a tiger making you want out that tango
Playmates from the heavens,
a shame we cannot have them,
we'll tear the stage off for the pleasure of their flesh together
After prostitution, girls for gasoline,
a woman will get killed for routine service M-60
Mr. Clean gets killed first, secondly the chief;
the chef will later get his head off cut by Co. Kurtz
Is the PBR street gang!
On a hairy way to Nha Trang

Finally the end of the river all right
Call for the wair strike if I'm not back in time
Fucked up philosophy and pagan sacrifice
PBR PBR! Almighty ready and standing by! [2x]
