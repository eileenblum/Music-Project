It's like to get beaten already inside the mortgage
Horrific procession of terminal life
Outrageous memorial to a self confessed failure
Seething with anger force clearing proceeds
Torture it's at hand to adapt more on decay
No more evolution only retrocede
A junky for violence a primitive being
No available  option is a sentence for life
Reaching the limit we are out of control we are the anti poser patrol 
Forging our lives into steel in a fight even the death is gona die

Violent Reinvindication, Violent Reinvindication

Salvation i've found in a cold steel attack
The gear and the ammo i prepare for the time
Prime enemy is here so no feelings to be
I'm self programmed just to survive
Pre assigned mercenary to a pitiless performance
Compensative justice as a gateway of life
Cold blooded executer
Life comes to an end in the most brutal way
Reaching the limit we are out of control we are the anti poser patrol
Forging our lives into steel in a fight even the death is gona die

Violent Reinvindication, Violent Reinvindication
Violent Reinvindication, Violent Reinvindication

I am a psychotic frenetic; i wish you all could have the same throat
To kill you with only just one slice, Excuse me while i kill the sky

Firing fists of metal, fighting for infinity, Fuelled by hatred honor,
Wins of steel rise eternally
Firing fists of metal, fighting for infinity, Fuelled by hatred honor,
Wins of steel rise eternally

Salvation i've found in a cold steel attack
The gear and the ammo i prepare for the time
Prime enemy is here so no feelings to be
I'm self programmed just to survive

Violent Reinvindication, Violent Reinvindication
