Blinded by the slaughter and ingestion of flesh
Fractured soul and the morals are left
Searching for life in a wide open stab
Peace I have found in the screaming human lambs
Butcher is my name executions to play
Quick kill or torture im smiling my fortune
In a world living wars I fight personal wars
Inhate putrid city in the state of no control
Sweet the execution of a child molesting priest
The absolute solution based on hammers smashing skulls
Acid enema! To the brain free for all
Suicide Street walk with no charge after night
Fractured skull just to start warming up reality, assassin to achieve nuclear personality
Blood cum and urine in the bed of innocence
Mutilated thoughts to transform in bizarre
Wrath explodes in horrific maniac homicide
The humanity to enjoy on its own cannibal feast
Room of eternal waiting closes claustrophobe
Morally decayed and depression comes along
Wrath to be realesed in perversion on and on
On and on and on and on and on and on and on
Sexualized violence and sweet fantasies
50/50 evil angel human thrash machine
Sense of peace, sense of war and incrementing justiice fight
For the right or the wrong blood will set the engine to run
Abstraction in absurd is what towards my violence
The mind possessing virus involuntary acquired
Acid enema! To the brain free for all
Suicide Street walk with no charge after night
Fractured skull just to start warming uo reality, assassin to achieve nuclear personality
Blood cum and urine in the bed of innocence
Mutilated thoughts to transform in bizarre
Wrath explored in horrific maniac homicide
The humanity to enjoy on its own cannibal feast
