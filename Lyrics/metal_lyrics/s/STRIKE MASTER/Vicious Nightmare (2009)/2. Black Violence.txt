This is a time for payback, retribution and judgment
Violence represented as it is
Like the obscene piranha swimming circles in your toilet
Waiting up to rip your balls
A grown up human screaming for a ripped burnt piece of his spirit
Rising up it self with wrath
It is the implacable hyperactive just like my grandma used to say:
Its worse than to spit in the face of God!
Thrashing has got no boundaries the mission it's to fuck it all
There is no sense to let live none
Apocalypse is not far from this, this crime is done and sentence has come
Merciless judge to pull the strings
Betrayer's temple has been thorn apart a liar is hanged for public shame
O how I laugh his poor disgrace
Execytir's will is here to stay: a hatred vision takes its place
It comes to be the kill to kill

You are death while you live as you die
Let the unholy celebrations of Neron begin tonight

Black violence
Nitro revenge
Violence cause we live for it
Nitro revenge

A vision is leading now among for those who have stood in the fight
The fortune age is all at hand
To finalize the opposite is just to wait for him to flip
The final stockade leaves no chance
Material fortunes or the ethic never to be mixed together
The balance has never been balanced
Every step we took in life has made the noose to strangle tight
We all suicide with joy for life

You are death while you live as you die
Let the unholy celebrations of Neron begin tonight

[Solo]

Black violence
Nitro revenge
Violence cause we live for it
Nitro revenge

Hear the voice laughing hard as you
crash into the wall of power
No mercy shown in this feast of
breaking punishment
No mercy shown in this feast of
breaking punishment
There's no choice in the struggle just
submitted peace to fire
The domination turns to terminating violence
The domination turns to terminating violence
Black violence
Forevermore recharged
Sail the seas of fire, flaming waves
crushing conscience
Ripped apart lies, no mercy for the false days
Rapid fire fights, completing rampage service
Heaven to judge crimes
or Hell to make 'em look nice

You are death while you live as you die
Let the unholy celebration of Neron begin tonight
Black violence
