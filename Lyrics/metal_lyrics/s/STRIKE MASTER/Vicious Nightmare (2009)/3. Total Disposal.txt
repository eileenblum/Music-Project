This aint a love song once again
And we are neither searching for peace
It's a provocative piece of mind
A call forth authenticity
There is no wrong violence it's about perspective
And some of us use it to heal
There's no one to tell us what's wrong or what's right
Metal is on our side and you all shall die

Total disposal, violent death
Vicious attack in day light
Ample termination, chambered hate
A thousand sun's fire revenge

Let's face it! Our nature no longer exists
Programation it's all that it is
Prevailing exists in the fists
To fight the fight and resist
A permanently strangling string
The future sealed decadence
You hear the life block doing ring
And we die, die, die

Combative! A warrior life to being
Loyalty and honor to feed
Put up to fight with 15
My sacrifice is victory
A triggered psycho on spree
The Neanderthal is here to feed
Forcing a rock to the chest
Unleash the force to the past

An irreversible crime to heal
Is the perversion of time
Progressive corruption of violence and sex
Nothing to do and all shall do
The mass is infected and brainwashed to follow
Like cattle they lead themselves killed
Authentic and strong is the way to survive
Jungle law now, smash or be shmashed
