Politically, and unguided missile
Fragmental, to drill on craniums
Unlimited, I like it endless
Screams and running, slaughterhouse
Just pissed off like and old screaming grandpa
In the idea of my word is the law!
Maybe useless in the day of today
Straight dry hate purely shoots to your brain
Miraculous dreaming on premonition
Many things that never shall be named
In the end only one stand the vision
Shining steel metalized hero freaks!!
Lock and load aim and shoot to the cranium
Break the tow smile the hell of your face
Let revenge take the air off the internal
Suffocate to achieve freedom breath!
Ready to fight the fight, eye of steel, attack
Ready to fight the fight, eye of steel, attack
Ready to fight the fight, eye of steel, attack
Ready to fight the fight, eye of steel, attack
Rush! On your way metalheads glory rests in the top of the hill
Shine! On your sword to the sun let all know victory stays with us
Ready to fight the fight, eye of steel, attack
Ready to fight the fight, eye of steel, attack
