Rush, our passion for speed, the fast death on wheels
Collisions of rage. Raw, risquÃ© genocide 
Speed sacrifice, adrenaline overdose

Insure all your bones now the nitro is flowing
And then assume you are dead
Step on the pedal till you are a thunder 
And the no brake till the end

Booze in mayhemic amounts, bourbon and beer
My liverâs been stabbed, crash the party is over
Severe brain concussions, to coma and then dead

Insure all your bones now the nitro is flowing
And then assume you are dead
Step on the pedal till you are a thunder 
And the no brake till the end

Steel reborn from steel I am the phoenix of velocity
No matter what then happens it will crush your brains out
Warriors of the road youâll see death speeding down your way
And when it comes youâll be a fucking poser slaughtered

Insure all your bones now the nitro is flowing
And then assume you are dead
Step on the pedal till you are a thunder 
And the no brake till the end
