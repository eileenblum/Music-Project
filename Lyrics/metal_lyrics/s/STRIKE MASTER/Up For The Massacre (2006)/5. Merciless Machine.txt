Off with their heads is the final command
Boots on their skulls till they crack on the ground
Riots of hate in the blackest of days
Death in the air - no way to escape!
Is the pest is the priest as the beast
Following madness crusaders of hate
Misanthropic carnage we are not afraid
Rise from below - saying the untrue!
Brutal carnage from the rising depths of hell
Mechanic feelings reprogrammed to destroy
Infernal wisdom incapacity to love

Once and for all - spit on their trought!
Rotten breeze onslaughting eyes into the mist
Drilling deep in an old dirty dream
Breaking free in a reign made of lies, heres to control

MERCILESS MACHINE

Cuted throat kicked head until dawn
To supervise your obligated suicide
Exhuming horrors from a cemetry of septic flesh
To die is the way - the way to survive
Smashing pressure makes your vision disappear
Unholy passion tears compassion out of me
No other massacre is compared to my game
Upcoming disgrace - knocking your door
Full charged engine never stoping marching forward
Blind immolator seeking life to obliterate
Cold smell of putrefaction saturate your lungs
Making it real - atrocious remains!
Unavoidable unceasing carnage confirmed
Psychotic wishful watis for you out in the night
Worm-eaten bodies floating in a sea of blood
Fear the return of the MERCILESS MACHINE

ARGHH this is it is my will my legacy
To bring you terror every way I can support
To supervise your obligated suicide
Becoming insane - I laugh while you die!

MERCILESS MACHINE!
