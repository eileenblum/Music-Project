We drink, then crawl the wall â and throw up all our guts 
We laugh, and curse, the cross â am I not a son of god?
Late night, red eyes, my vice â live fast but never die

A Jack, a John, a Jim? â why not the three of them
Remorse is for the weak â we live in discontrol
A knife, of shinning steel! â to slice on my own arm

Acid for blood
Acid for blood
Acid for blood

Arrange revenge tonight â a strike not to forget
One voice, broke bones, I won â strangulation on the ground
Corrupt the peace in violence â In an eternal mosh

Erase my trace in life â survival is in game
Confess the crimes you did â youâre nearer from the death
Embrace your fatal end- redemption never ends

Auto destructive solutions â the choice is life or death
Mission executed â to die under the metal blade 

Acid for blood
Acid for blood
Acid for blood
