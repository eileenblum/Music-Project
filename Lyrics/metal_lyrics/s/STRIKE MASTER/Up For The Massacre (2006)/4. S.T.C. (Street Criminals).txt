Rsentful, to hold a grudge against society
To dominate and to surrender their mass
Resist, the most repulsive of lifestyles
one day all will fall under their rusty guillotine
abused, till nothing is left to be exploited
train a mindless soildier of fortune
regret, when murders come to arise
better stay alert for the'll come to desecrate

The number on your arms will make you tough
the drugs into your veins became you god
to beat yourself with bigger guys than you
aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrhahahahahahahahahaha

your criminal violence awakes
your name in the streets will remain
respected thrashing hunter in the hood
aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrhahahahahahahahahaha

choose this way become your boss and die
blood for blood its time to say goodbye

aggressions against racist anti latins
the hood is ours and ours until we die
the brothers can go down but we will fight
aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrhahahahahahahahahaha

choose this way become your boss and die
blood for blood its time to say goodbye
STC - street criminals - STC - street criminals

Never had a father maybe never will,
and if I had a father is he whom I will kill
Never had a mother and maybe never will,
and if i had a mother is she whom I will kill
