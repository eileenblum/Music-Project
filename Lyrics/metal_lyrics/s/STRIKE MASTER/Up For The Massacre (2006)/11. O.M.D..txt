[Bonus Track]Look for the news of our fate in my face
I'm so tired from my repulsion
to this world of decadence
Government created a nanorobotic virus
like a brain eating bacteria
That shall come to take our lives
Control overcomes over
minds already fallen
To the monotonous stupidity of
the vice of non sense living
A pray to ask for death and a
fully charged revolver
it will take me just a drink
to get the vice of non sense killing

[Chorus:]
I will submerge you into a nightmare
A realistic vision of life and death...

Black was the night 'till
turned red from a fight
And i knew i had a right to
clean sweep rampage against anyone
The slut and the blood and
the crashed car scene
The cult and the gang will
party hard with sacrifice
The kids have cocaine and
the sluts only twelve
The liquor store is open 24 hours a day
Our world is just sinking
in poverty and misery
Come on have a taste you'll see
the are worst things than death

[Chorus:]
I will submerge you into a nightmare
A realistic vision of life and death...

[Chorus:]
I will submerge you into a nightmare
A realistic vision of life and death...
