Things are turning for the worst
Death is what killed our unborn child
We don't chose or day of birth, neither choose our way of dying
Escaping from reality to fade in to oblivion

Things are turning for the worst
Worse than casket needs a corpse
DisillusionÂ´s automatic, massive graves grow systematic
Fighting against nature not to be another helpless outcast

Death, death will be what killÂ´s us
Death, death will be what killÂ´s us
Death, death will be what killÂ´s us
Death, death will be what killÂ´s us

Things are turning to an end
Delivering a good looking corpse
Accepting finalization, taking it as compensation
We were dead since our very embryonic transformation!
