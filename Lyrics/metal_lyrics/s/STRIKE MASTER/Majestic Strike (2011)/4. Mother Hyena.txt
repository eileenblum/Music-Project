Mother hyena
Burn the teddy bear
Soulless progenitor
Suffocate a life in a rush for a hush

Dark assassination
Heinous execution
Better find a bag for little angel's suffocation

Surrender to the void
Perform a vicious outburst
The only way to keep it quiet is to squeeze the life out from it

Family... will have.. a little box funeral
Media... will cover... on a genius headline
Guardian angel... has failed on a protective task
Baby and his mother hyena, public light infanticide

Public light, infanticide, on a bag, dumped in the river

In the darkest night
With the pipe on crack
There's no chance, for a little one to have the right

The right to a decent death
To a peaceful fadeout end
Brutality will take over a life on parent's hand

After an illusion
a surrealist illusion
Reality will terrify and guilt will finally dominate

Family... will have.. a little box funeral
Media... will cover... on a genius headline
Guardian angel... has failed on a protective task
Baby and his mother hyena, public light infanticide

On a cloudy summer night
Suffocation of life
Heavens can only cry
Obscuration of life
Maternal murderer
tears of the coroner
Parental evidence
The smell of putrescence

Family... will have.. a little box funeral
Media... will cover... on a genius headline
Guardian angel... has failed on a protective task
Baby and his mother hyena, public light infanticide

Public light, infanticide, on a bag, dumped in the river
