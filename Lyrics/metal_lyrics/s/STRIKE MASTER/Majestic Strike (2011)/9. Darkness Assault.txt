I imagine myself existing free, living in a place I'm not forced to my destiny
Floating endlessly into immense space, turned into a precious rock no oneÂ´s meant to see it's bright
Here it comes again, fade out the lights, sharpen the knife and lock off every awful thought
Violent fantasies! Torture scenarios, humiliation and shame turn my mind in black

And it has no name, a rush of confusion, dreaming while being wake and living while being asleep
Dangerous to myself, and worse to my environment no oneÂ´s to know what my plan it shall finally be
Yes I love weapons, and strength to resist, only thing scary is subconscious is turning real
Don't be alarmed, it's only depression but try not being surprised IÂ´ve already doomed my life

On a strange movie film, no day and no night, heavy breath smell the smoke from the engine of life
Something went wrong, unknown to us all, factory of horror is working with no control
Now how to stop? Ideas anyone? Brutality doomed us to practice the worst of crimes
Blood retribution and vengeances all, same rules for anyone slaughtering innocent one

Our final stage or it just began? The actual formula is dooming our life away
Dust on the rifle, dust on the past, dusty remembrances to tell us we fucked our chance
I imagine myself existing free, living in a place I'm not forced to my destiny
Floating endlessly into immense space, turned into a precious rock no oneÂ´s meant to see its bright
