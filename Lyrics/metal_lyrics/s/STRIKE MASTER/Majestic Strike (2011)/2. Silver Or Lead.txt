So you think you are way to cool for school?
Singing about death chaos and violence youÂ´ve never lived
Let me put your ass in to the ground
A dirty ground of power, death and money never prophesied 
Favelas, barrios and warzones 
We improved our death fields that can make them look like Disneyland
Not a pride but our sad reality
Just come by and let me say "mi casa es su casa" brother 

Mexicans don't need singing about radiation
Nuclear mutation or toxic sickness bullshit
Our methods go more personal and much romantic
Fuck you up with a machete and an AK 47

It's silver or lead!
Tons of money or tons of bullets
silver or lead
Once got used get disposed 

Cousin Nacho riding in the mountains 
Doing sort of things making baby Jesus cry
Once inside there is not a way out
Not only heÂ´ll pay but his whole family Â´ll get mummified
15 men commando break in nightclub
All the bills are free you can ask for any liquor glass
Just hold on, nothings free in this life
If they like your girl she will get ceremonially abused

We all still can fight em down!
