...welcome the wastelands

We have been ending up by destroying our inner part
Believing in nothing but our selfish suicidal art
The corrsion that we built
False romance to be willed
Our life is filled with redemption and guilt

We keep on trying to control each other's hand
No matter what or if we drown we do not aim to understand
The devil's advocate
Is what we procreate
So shut the fuck up (or) do you hesitate?

Don't you ever feel?
Life is a game and there is nothing about it to be real...
The story has begun...
It's a struggle to survive, an element full of lies,
It's a war that can't be won

...the permanent crackdown

We want progression, in the same way devastation
To maintain our own power, only others to devour
Keep on fighting for freedom
And killing for wisdom
'cause we don't care if it's dead-end-run

We love each other, don't fear murdering our own brother
Just have eyes for our own interest and nevermind to re-infest
Mankind's vicious circle
The morbid world-recycle
The downward spiral of the human guideline

I will just lose myself somehow...
Drown myself in regrets
'cause you are the devils in disguise
For someone I have bet

I don't want to feel so real, feel so real again
Just loose myself, just drown myself and silence will remain
