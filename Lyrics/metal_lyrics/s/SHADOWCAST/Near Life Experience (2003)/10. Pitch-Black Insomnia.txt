Hold on - as I am coming along
Watch out - see me taking the throne
'cause there is something that I have to proclaim
The trigger-substance to drive you insane

Someone has to come to push my fate away
Someone has to feel my breath and my betray
Love humbles mankind, but hate will make us strong
And now you return where you belong

So here is starts right now - you're feeling so alone
Nothing more to know - we are taking it on
The poetry of war - just things to ignore
The mirror of despair - the smell of pain right in the air

Can you hear me - laughing at you?
Can you feel me - despising you?
You keep on trying to escape from the chain
But you don't know that there is no way out of pain!

You are always yearning to get another chance
Forever and never it's a fading dance
You are always grasping to control what you commence
But things have gone their ways...

Someone has to lie to kill the truth inside
Someone has to die to spill blood in a tide
Love humbles mankind, but hate will make us strong
And I don't care when you're gone

I can see you crying - all hope having gone
I can see you lying - and you don't know what you've done
I can see you grasping - but things have gone their ways
