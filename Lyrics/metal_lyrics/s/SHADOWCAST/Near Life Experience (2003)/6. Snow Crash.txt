The end is yet to come...
Distingue your memories before they're gone
The end is yet to come...
But then everything turned out to be wrong

We were meant to speak in highly different tongues
To enable our diversity, to enable being social ones
Back at the birth of man, back at the birth of speech
To discover excitement, to disorder and to teach

It's the 23rd century and there's a newly sworn enemy
Coming from behind and turning you to blind
A steady-state of a binary presentation
A hate-progression of a coming termination

Did you reveal your scars and human signs?
Your mind keeps turning, this is not real
Did you re-heal your wounds and sweet-caress?
I am the virus in you and I am going to steal

It's a snow crash - inside of your head
A ponderous oblivion, a force to be fed
It's like a mental destruction - turn of 180 degrees
Dementia is coming, don't you agree?

It's a snow crash - inside of your brain
Heading towards your mind and falling like rain
It's like a war inside - when all our thoughts collide
'cause you've been erased even though you're alive

Metaverse, the virtual desire
A fictive world with all dreams that you admired
But now there's revenge, the fall of Babylon
An Infokalypse erasing what was going on
Don't you believe, don't you retrieve?
It's the disorder of the word and the rising of grief
A stroke of excitement and of permanent delusion
A paradise lost in fucking horrendous confusion

Take my breath away
And knowledge will always stay...
Take my breath away
And no one will ever stay...
