When I sit down and think about all aims in life
When I walk out and breath in all that's being derived
When my eyes start sensing among the things to come
Then I wonder why I often keep on going wrong

If I supposed there was some kind of outer form
If I opposed all dogmas being inside the norm
If I kept telling that everything seems like a lie
Then I could say that I'm - feeling alive!

When I raise up my hand reaching out for some good
When I try to compete and don't feel understood
When my mind keeps trembling of some inner fear
Then I wonder if our end could be anyway near

If I chose to reject from all the things yet to come
If I instead let go all moods that made me overcome
If I never felt some regrets and if I never let loose
Then I could say that there are still things - I have to chose

Come closer, step further and listen to me
There's no solution but a suggestion, the key?
I don't have a message, there's no instruction
To handle yourself and to prevent destruction

And I know it's an experience that you chose every time
Collecting thoughts and being so amused
Take it all away
Impressions will always stay

Don't want to take it back
Science evolving
Progression dissolving
