Which ways do you chose, which ones to abuse?
Come along, make me stronger and taste no longer
When moments are gone, when moments turn to stone
I'll be the one to carry on...

Which ways to accuse, which ones for fair use
The ignorance drop down of a joyless stardom
When moments are gone, when moments turn to stone
I'll be the one who takes it all...

I have to go, to feel inside the pain is real
I know, I never choose to go
You have to know, I'm dead inside, seems poisoned light
I know, I'll be leaving now

I wonder where we will go?
I wonder why we might know - it's forever
And there is no way going back again for now...

So if you try to take it on
So if you try to leave it all - forever
I will not drown

There are ways we wonder, there are rays we encounter
There are things we say and we find in any way
Antisense behaviour, tearing saviour
Harvesting - the bleak seed raver

Hear me calling, see me falling in vain
See me asking for answers, when I cry out in pain
Start to leave all behind, try to fold and unwind
And you'll see if there is more to remind
