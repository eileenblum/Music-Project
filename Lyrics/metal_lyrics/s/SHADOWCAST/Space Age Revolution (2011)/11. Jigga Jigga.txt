Jigga Jigga!
Welcome to the main arena!

I've always been a party pleaser
There's not a doubt
I've checked all the ladies out!
I'm the lirycal teaser
Addicted to the massive crowd
Yeah!

If you love me or you hate me
I don't give a damn
If you're really think you're ready
So let me see your hands
Everybody knows
we've got a floorfiller
I'm on the mic driller
Here's the bass killer
Yeah

Full of light
From distant flame
There's sunlight fading
Autumn leaves in the rain
If you call I will be there

Close to the age!
Watch how we mix it up!
