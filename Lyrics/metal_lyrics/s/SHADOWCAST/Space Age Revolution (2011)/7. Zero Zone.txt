Welcome to my world
Where am I?
Emptiness surrounds me
Who am I?
Does anybody care?
What is time?
Is it just a feeling?
Digging deeper than I dare
Tattoo the skin to behold for the moment
Build up a plan to know you are there
Pictures reveal the truth of a lifetime
But I can't tell any "where" any "when"

Recall: there's a shadow above you
Giving you a reason to live
Fragments of time burning your mind
Kill all memories left behind

[Chorus:]
Spinning around and around and around
All these things inside my head
You don't know how it feels to be down on your knees
Cause it feels just slightly mad
(This is the change of my belief, Zero zone)

Capture the minute
Fight for the moment
Its seems like dementia is just another word
Remember suggestions don't forget some impressions
I am losing the control over things I just heard
What a small word, Haven't we just met?
Or am I the next soul you Want to collect?
Do I know you? Do I know you well?
I Just can't remember, sorry I can't tell

Recall: there's a shadow above you
Giving you a reason to live
Fragments of time burning your mind
Kill all memories left behind

[Chorus:]
Spinning around and around and around
All these things inside my head
You don't know how it feels to be down on your knees
Cause it feels just slightly mad
Talk to me now on my way into oblivion
You don't know how it feels to be down on your knees
Cause it feels just slightly mad

I wanna feel all these chances that keep me real
I wanna feel all these memories that have been sealed

[Chorus:]
Spinning around and around and around
All these things inside my head
You don't know how it feels to be down on your knees
Cause it feels just slightly mad
Talk to me now on my way into oblivion
You don't know how it feels to be down on your knees
Cause it feels just slightly mad
