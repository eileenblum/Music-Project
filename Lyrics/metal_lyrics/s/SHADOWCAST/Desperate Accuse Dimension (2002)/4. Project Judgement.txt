We are forsaken - in a world of pain
Roads have been taken - to indulge yourself in vain

Hellcome to our realm where you'll abandon
All your mortal visions of a peaceful life
Far beyond your imagination
Far beyond all temptation
Come &amp; your soul will taste the foul flavour
Of an eternity so close
Today's gonna never end at all
'cause at the river lethe nobody cares

Settle down to suffer as you never did
To procreate &amp; suffocate
Extinguished by your own hands in heaven
Hidden from the earthly light
Get closer, leave the past behind
The present will remain at zero-speed
Today's gonna never end at all
'cause at the river lethe nobody cares

Only pain, no salvation
No harmony, no sympathy

Enter a new dimension of fear
Without forgiveness or compromise
This is the place of final judgement
Where your worst nightmares will become true

So lose your faith
A new possession of your dreams
Sounds of redemption will caress you
In bitter sweet dissection
