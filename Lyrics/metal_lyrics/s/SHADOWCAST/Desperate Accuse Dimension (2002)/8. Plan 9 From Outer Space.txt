Psycho structures
Virtual death
Distorted visions
A paranoid soul

Bleeding hopes
&amp; morbid echoes
Mental suicide
Just spiritual advice?

How would it be to have a dagger close by side?
How would it be to carve all pain away - in just one slide?
Behold the past - in your mind
Behold the future - in your eyes
Plan 9 from outer space - your recreation

Endless fever
Elemental shades
Dancing moonlight
Black sunshine

Visual deconstruction
Killing spree
Endless life?
Eternal despair!

Look what you are now
Look what you've become
A wreck of liberation
A soul of disintegration
