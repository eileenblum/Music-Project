Everything is tentatively, everything's venally
How disgusting &amp; lifeless, how morbid &amp; tasteless
Dying is carried out in thrusts and parts
Automatic redemption, seasons of killing art
Searching the answer somewhere in nowhere

Glamour is the land, where you'll never live
Out of your mind, out of endless sight
15 minutes of fame is what you'd like to receive
Within your sense, within unreachable delight

I use the terror of the new to buy - emptiness in you
The quantity of nothing's what you will have to go through

Everything's a number, reduction ad absurdum
Strangulation of the individual's mask
The natural person being torn to the minimum
Control of thoughts, control of every task

You're bound to empty promises and false hope so curled
Man is a ware like anything else in this world

Is it water, where we will drown?
Emptiness is our burden crown
Unwilling to lose it all
We'll slide down the surface of things

Zero existence

Shattered glass &amp; venomous dreams
We are starting the overture to screams
