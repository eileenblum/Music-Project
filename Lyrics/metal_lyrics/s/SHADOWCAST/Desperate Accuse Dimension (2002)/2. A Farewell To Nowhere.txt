Descending into the hardest region
Of a glittering past, of a metallic season
Transformation of my darkest cave
The inner-perspective, a slightly tempted wave

Walking through life like a remote person
Without direction, without any action
I want you to rescue me from all the pain
My golden shining tears are drowned by rain

Come &amp; show me the farewell to nowhere
Come &amp; lead me to a highway of tries
Come beware me from a farewell to blindness
Come &amp; save us (from) a reflection of lies

Don't you care where we go?
Don't you care why we fall down?
Is there anything more to know?
Who's the one to blame &amp; drown?

Nothing remaining, nothing maintaining
All bitterness, all bloodshed, all aiming, all youth
Reality endulges our silver-painted mind
Blaming a scapegoat's easier than the truth

How long does it take until we will brake?
Courage in the moment of downfall - awake!
The last fair deal has just been made
The trigger to cleansing was pulled right &amp; straight

A garden where hope has died
A place where all mankind cried
In a moment of clarity my senses are aware
Nothing worth to keep it up, nothing here to beware
