Drifting further down beyond the spiral
Agony is leading me across this
Viral platelet-activated mask
Mentally executing all this dormant side
Wiping out the coldness in one fucking slide -
All this would be a bitter task

What will it be when all turns neon &amp; black
When we tumble down &amp; the walls will crack
So where is your master, your idol, your guide
The hybrid tech Messiah's gonna crush &amp; collide

Having seen the scenes through fragile memories
Never will forget the so-called prophecies
That should fulfill one day, some time
Velvet filth devours the jungle of perception
All that remains will be a cold deception
Blinding me &amp; you with warmth

You try to hide in welkin velvet
Where you seek forgiveness, painful honesty
The dreams you dread recovered in your mind
So face your destiny 'cause you cannot rewind

The tasteless wonders, the sky-high deep
Screams you'll remember in your dead-end-sleep
Generations have failed again
The struggle - for survival - a stupid aim

Save the last dance for the morning
After all has been erased
There's a shadow without warning
All our thoughts have been defaced
