Intoxicated in the hidden breathless zone
Where ears are lead by poisoned mint &amp; sweet-harsh tone
Someone telling us to believe in the unknown
All our aims are executed to an obscure crown

Religion &amp; progression - two contraries by now
The perdition city - a perfect word somehow
Keeping on trying to reverse all hidden truth
Time's gonna tell about the lies inside your mouth

So if you try to take my hand, I'll seduce you &amp; you might understand
So if you try to take my hand, find a now god, seek a peaceful end

Desperate accuse dimension
Black label force dillusion
Liquid soul dimension
The pain commitment surgery

Enigmatic is the shadow that rises in the night
For centuries you tried to take advantage of your might
Ridiculous the way of being so prominent wise
The white dove shall be prosecuted for your alibis

Stigmatising god &amp; all his followers so blind
The consequences are the failures of your fucking mind
Ignorance &amp; vengeance - the product of your seed
Peace, love &amp; forgiveness - the thing that's gonna bleed
