Frameshift-mutating vengeance throughout this dying time
Tragedies exalted, elegies are no crime
A silver-glass-projection - of ideology
A fever-caused injection - of stupidity

What if I chose to cease all killing style?
Drowning faith at death's door for a while
Beyond this bitter option
There's no salvation now

With a smile...

Contempt of spawning sorrow, but in the end it's fear
Conspiracies implanted, everything's so near
Exploring unknown regions, never seen before
Entangled here in after, tormented to the core

Seeing...the unseen
Hearing...the unheard

Regain access to the tree of life
Your first choice into another future
An enigma of shadows
A legacy of shame
A mirror of night's glamour
An infernal horde of pain

I am the pain inside when our feelings collide
In all redemption
In all rejection
