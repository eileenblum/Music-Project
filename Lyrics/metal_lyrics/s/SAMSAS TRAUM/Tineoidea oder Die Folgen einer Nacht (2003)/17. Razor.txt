From the inside
To the outside,
Rippin',
Drag-drop-drippin',
Sippin' peace.
She's the one
Reflecting skin and nerves,
Hand versus heart,
Precious bloody finger-prints,
Silent works of art.

Razor.
Like a mirror.
Slashing dreams.
26 mouths opening
Their pale lips and
Unleashing shimmering streams.
Razor.
Be my mirror.
Drown my dreams.
26 mouths opening
Their pale lips and
Unfolding all my screams.

There's nothing left to build upon.
There's nothing left to suffer from.
There's really nothing more to come.
End it fucking NOW.
There's nothing left to build upon.
There's nothing left to suffer from.
There's really nothing more to come.
May it all end NOW.

From the inside
To the outside,
Rumblin',
Slightly crumbling,
Mumbling, cutting fees.
I will never find you
Even though your always there
Even if I cut myself
Every-fucking-where.
