[MIIME side project]

I do know by any means
That my cat does not like beans
And I also know for sure
That my cat dislikes "The Cure".

Cause she's a cold-wave-kitty,
Chewing bubblegum.
She grew up in Notre Dame
And as a cold-wave-pussy
She's got the groove.
Klitty-Kitties just know how to move.

Pay one dollar to witness how a regular sized cat
Destroys your house in less than five minutes.

Yeah, I only know one thing:
If my cat starts to sing,
Man, I tell you, that's no lie,
You will kiss your goddamn hard-rock-ass "Good Bye".

PicketyPucketyPum,
Come out and show your bum.
Sticky fingers in my pocket,
Rusty lightbulps in your sockets.
PicketyPucketyPuck,
Today you had bad luck.
The cold-wave-cats are here to stay,
And you're shitfaced like fuck.
