[MIIME side project]

There is nothing left to say,
Tear my heart out, it's o.k.,
Cause I don't feel anything.
It's all unreal.
Everything.

I have so much love to share.
Pull me under, I don't care.
Cause I don't feel anything.
It's all unreal.
Everything.

I don't have the strength to do
Things the way you want me to.
But I promise when I'm done,
I will be another one.
Cause I don't feel anything.
It stays unreal.
Everything.
