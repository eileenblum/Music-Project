[MIIME side project]

And she waves me "Goody Bye"
Where the marshmallows fly.
Deeper and deeper, the lilies still weep
Below the vast oceans, my secrets to keep.
She drowns in the waters of my wishing-well,
With fading eyes she whispered gently:
"I'll see you in hell."

And the mermaid still cries
As the whales in the skies
Spread their wings neither
For Venus nor Mars,
The moon, hush, hush, silently
Covers her scars
With milky-white liquid,
The fairies are gone
To guide her tiptoed through the abyss:
"What have I done?"

Once, now and then,
At least for a little while,
I'll taste the absinth from her oval lips,
Not knowing I killed her again.
Once, now and then,
At least for a thousand cuts,
I'll drink the saltwater from her shiny breasts,
Denying I killed her again.

And the princess will die
With a weakening sigh.
She lies embedded on crystals and sand,
She holds my heart tightly in her tiny hand.
The wind's blowing strong
But our patience grew older,
Peacefully smiling she cried:
"We have grown colder."
