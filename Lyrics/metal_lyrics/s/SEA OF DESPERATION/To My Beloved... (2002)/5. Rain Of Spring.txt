I smell the rain of spring
It brings me part of rest
Sometimes I loose my mind
And rain return me to the sanity

The day is gone
And bitter regrets are come
Of choice,of love,of all
Arise again...

Tonight the sky above
Violet and dark
I see the things that coming
Things will become
There's nothing to be in joy
I feel dark drops
I close my eyes

The darkside of spirit rose
To call of moon
I see bad dreams my paranoya blooms
In place of unlight
My inner force awake
Nocturnity, I'm to itself condemned
