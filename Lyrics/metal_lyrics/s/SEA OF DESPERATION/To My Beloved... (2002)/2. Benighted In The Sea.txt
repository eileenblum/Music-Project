The sea is vast
I drift through dismal scapes
Melancholia
Paint black my prostrate soul
Others died
Shall I?
In clouded autumn day
Beyond the eath

And sun drowned down
I seized by strange sence
It never rise again
Then night descends
And spread the ghost moonlight
The star-flecked sky.....demise

I close my eyes
And feel the dark inside
Eviscerating me
