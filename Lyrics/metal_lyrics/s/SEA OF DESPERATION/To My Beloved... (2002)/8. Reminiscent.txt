[bonus track]

The chamber
Of mind
Full of pictures all you left
You're gone
Im trembling
Trying to reach the end
My heart is broken
And my soul
Is falling down
Such night
Never ends
Clairvoyant's crying loud

I damned these skies
Cause you are gone
Despair blind me
And myeyes possessed by night

At the final
I saw the shape
The one who was with sword
Another was
In dress of heaven
Black shape avert me from white
Im nothing...
I flow
With the river of forlorn
Where are you?
My love
I tired to wait and wait.....

I damned this night
Cause we both are gone
Insane
Bedazzled me
My eyes possessed by dark
