[In 44 BC, Caesar was assassinated by senators who opposed Caesar's assumption of absolute power and wanted to restore constitutional government. Initially it was thought that a new republic will emerge from the chaos that followed. But in the aftermath a Second Triumvirate, consisting of Caesar's designated heir, Octavian, and his former supporters, Mark Antony and Lepidus, took power. However, this alliance soon descended into a struggle for dominance. Lepidus was exiled, and when Octavian defeated Antony and Cleopatra of Egypt at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, he became the undisputed ruler of Rome.]

Now a new age dawns
The Republicâs time is ending
The people fear the end draws near

Listen friends and hear my tale
Of power and of betrayal
The stage is set the world will never forget

Where legends dwell and myths are born
In the aftermath when the world is torn

Listen friends and hear my tale
Listen all!
Welcome to the show...
