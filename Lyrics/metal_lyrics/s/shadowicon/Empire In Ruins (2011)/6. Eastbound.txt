[After the battle, a new arrangement was made between the members of the Second Triumvirate: while Octavian returned to Rome, Antony went on to govern the east. Lepidus went on to govern Hispania and the province of Africa. The triumvirate's enemies were subjected to proscription including Mark Antony's archenemy Cicero who was killed on December 7 43 BC.]

Now the battle has been won 
I shall remain in the East 
Far and near, high and clear,
The winners will write history

So much death under the sun
So many brothers deceased
In Egypt I shall go from here
To write my own history

The alliance formed - my lover you shall be

No fate I want, no world; no world without you (no faith no world without you)
Such lovely fantasy full of mystery (mystery)
When Fortune smiles, no escape without you (no faith no world without you)
This is the deepest secret nobody knows

Wind and rain, the bone chill of cold,
The prophecy of the Old

What you keep saying - you still propose
Is to finally crush all my foes
In Egypt where my soul shall dwell
Until my last dying breath in hell

The alliance formed - let history be judge

[CHORUS]

An alliance doomed - let history be judge

No fate I want, no world; no world without you (no faith no world without you)
Such lovely fantasy full of misery (misery)
When thereâs no end, no escape without you (no faith no world without you)
Weâll lie forgotten in the sands of time
