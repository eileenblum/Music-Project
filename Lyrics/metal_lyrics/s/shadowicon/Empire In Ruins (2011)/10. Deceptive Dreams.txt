[The political consequences of this battle were far-reaching. After Mark Antony lost his fleet, his army, which had been equal to that of Octavian, deserted in large numbers. Under cover of darkness some 19 Legions and 12,000 cavalry fled before Antony was able to engage Octavian in a land battle. Despite a victory at Alexandria on July 31, 30 BC, more of Mark Antony's armies deserted, leaving him with insufficient forces to fight Octavian. Mark Antony then fled from the battle. Thus, Octavian's victory at the Battle of Actium gave him sole and uncontested control of the Roman Mediterranean and he became "Augustus Caesar" and the "first citizen" of Rome.]

Running â on the road to nowhere
Time is - passing on
Now that â all hope is gone and
The end will be violent
So little time, my agony

Now the dark creeps in
Soon I will sleep
For all eternity

Somewhere out there (there)
Lie all our dreams (dreams)
Once enchanted
Now deceptive
Drifting through dark
The change in seasons
Give me reasons
For this treason

Darkness â covers these lands
Silence â the end is near
Something â hides in (the) shadow
Someone breaths and waits
Forgotten life, a mercy of night

Now the dark creeps in
Soon I will sleep
For all eternity

[CHORUS]

Now the dark creeps in
Soon I will sleep
For all eternity

[CHORUS]
