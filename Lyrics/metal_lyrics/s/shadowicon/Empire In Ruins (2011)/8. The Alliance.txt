[The Caesarians Octavian (Caesar's principal, though not sole, heir), Mark Antony, and Marcus Lepidus under the Second Triumvirate had stepped in to fill the power vacuum caused by Julius Caesar's assassination. After the Triumvirate had defeated Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus at the Battle of Philippi (42 BC) and Lepidus was expelled from the Triumvirate (36 BC), Octavian and Antony were left as the two most powerful men in the Roman world. For a time, Rome saw peace. Antony had been having an affair with the queen of Egypt, Cleopatra. When Cleopatra received word that Rome had declared war, Antony threw his support to Egypt. Immediately, the Senate stripped Antony of all his official power and labelled him as an outlaw and a traitor. Octavian summoned all of his legions, numbered at almost 200,000 Roman legionaries. Cleopatra and Antony did the same, assembling roughly the same number in mixed heavy Roman and light Egyptian infantry. The stage was set for the largest conflict the Roman world had ever seen.]

The queen of sand, the chosen one,
Goddess on earth, sent from above.
The queen of kings, a tear of Ra,
An ocean princess.

A man of arms, a legionnaire, a fool in love,
â¦blinded by the light.
A destiny â united; a passion â unrevealed
All it took was one look intoâ¦

Her eyes.
Two saints gone astray.
A sign sent from the sky,
A moment, caught in time.

Two souls, one mind - the alliance!
A bond of life - the alliance!

A trail of tears, a pact of death,
Sworn enemies, becoming friends.
Against the world, on a path of dreams,
Towards a dead end.

A change in course of time, a point of no return,
Against the rest of the world!  
A unity â unbreakable.
One voice.

The lies,
Repeating once again.
When dreams come to life,
United till the end.

[CHORUS]
