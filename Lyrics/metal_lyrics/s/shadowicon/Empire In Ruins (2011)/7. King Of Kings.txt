[Caesarion, was born in Egypt in 47 BC and was the son of Julius Caesar. Cleopatra VII hoped that her son would eventually succeed his father as the head of the Roman Republic as well as Egypt. 
During the tense period of time leading up to the final conflict between Mark Antony and Octavian (future Emperor Augustus), Antony, who at that time shared control of the Republic in a triumvirate with Octavian and Lepidus, granted various eastern lands and titles to Caesarion and to his own three children with Cleopatra (in 34 BC). Caesarion was proclaimed "King of Kings." Most threatening to Octavian (whose claim to power was based on his status as Julius Caesar's grandnephew and adopted son), Antony declared Caesarion to be Caesar's true son and heir.]

A new life conceived by Sand and Steel,
Uniting former foes against their will.
Son of the goddess, the "King of the Kings",
The ruler of the dawn is here.

Arise from the desert, my dearest son,
Sit by me on a golden throne.
Merge the great nations of East and West
These lands are all for you to own.

Heir to the throne, all the legions of Rome, 
My heart sees divinity in you.
Bright eyes see, what night conceals - the secrets of a man.
Carry out my hidden plan - youâre blood bound to these lands.
Scheme so mysterious, eager for the fray;
Itâs written in the sand. 

Stand out against all odds
The dawn of a new day has begun.
Royal blood streams through your own veins, 
Great deeds are yet to be done.

[CHORUS]
