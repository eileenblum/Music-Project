[Cleopatra's son by Caesar, Caesarion, was proclaimed pharaoh by the Egyptians, but Octavian had already won. Caesarion was captured and executed, his fate reportedly sealed by Octavian's phrase: "Two Caesars are one too many." This ended not just the Hellenistic line of Egyptian pharaohs, but the line of all Egyptian pharaohs. The Egyptian empire â once mighty and powerful â fell. Nothing but a shadow of its former glory it remained nothing but an empire in ruinsâ¦]

In secret I - now rule my land
In secret now - I command the damned

In the halls of our fathers
We shall meet again
In the halls of our fathers
We shall remain insane...

Another day is dawning,
Another sunrise coming
To mark the fall of all
Come, come, come and hear thy call

The starless sky dims this night, (this night tonight)
And the moon is left alone to shine in vain, (to shine in pain)
From the far away I can hear the rain drawing nearer.

Can feel the end of my reign.

On this night
Will you fight?
Will our world burn bright?
Immortal
Forever
Now that we are free

As faith tosses coins in the air, turning hope into despair
For the shadows see it all and they rarely forget,
Near the borders of insanity
We will find our immortality

[CHORUS]

And now I stand alone,
No one to take me home
Even death will not wait
All is gone, let me rage against my fate.

All we do not see
Lost and forgotten yet immortal forever

See the end of the sons of Ra.

[CHORUS]

Alone we walk this path,
of death and of decay
Alone we contemplate,
our faith and our betrayal
And as our life transcends,
to another realm
Itâs hard to let it go;
So hard to let it go!
I can see that
this is now the end
... the end
â¦the end

In our blindness we move forward
Clinging to the lies weâve harboured
Never could admit mistakes
Despite the fears, what it takes
Is there someone who can tell me
How this future came to be?
And as the worlds now fall apart
My visions fade away in dark
Each escape that Iâve taken
Never sleep yet never waken
Can this question last forever?
Hidden dreams itâs now or never
This is the end, the end, the end
