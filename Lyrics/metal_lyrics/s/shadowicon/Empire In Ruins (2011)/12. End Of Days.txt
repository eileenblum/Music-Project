[That very day; Cleopatra committed suicide. His children by Cleopatra were spared. The ancient sources, particularly the Roman ones, are in general agreement that Cleopatra killed herself by inducing an asp to bite her. The oldest source is Strabo, who was alive at the time of the event, and might even have been in Alexandria. He says that there are two stories: that she applied a toxic ointment, or that she was bitten by an asp. The site of their tomb or tombs is uncertain, but may lie near the temple of Taposiris Magna in Alexandria.]

Now that everything is lost
Everything I held dear 
All gone in the madness of this world
Donât let me fall apart
Don't let me live a lie

Kiss my lips and poison my heart
Whisper your love and poison my soul
Anubis be my guide tonight
Let my thoughts run out of line
So we can start this show tonight

Drums pounding in the distance
Heralding the end of days
A whisper of a warning,
They grow louder every day
They bring the nightmare thatâs at bay
My final act
My betrayal

My ancestors in the past
Have foreseen a future that would last
So Fathers where are you now
Iâm just wondering why

There are drums in the distance
Heralding the end of days
A whisper of a warning,
They grow louder every day
There will be no new dawn
For me a child of (the) Gods
Now the drums are beating faster
âItâs coming now, Itâs coming nowâ they warn

There comes a time when you decide
A time to make a sacrifice
And pay the final price in blood
So sacred and divine

Is there glory in such an act?
Endless death or eternal fame
And as the final curtain falls 
Iâm just wondering why

There were drums in the distance
Heralding the end of days
A whisper of a warning,
They grow louder every day
There will be no new dawn
For I was child of (the) Gods
Father please come get me now
And take me to a better place
Yes there were drums in the distance						
Heralding the end of days
Come and see my final act
Of despair and of regret
Wonât see a brand new dawn
For I was child of (the) Gods
All for this day, this twisted glory
Still Iâm wondering why

There were drums in the distance				
Heralding the end of days
A whisper of a warning,
They grow louder every day
There will be no new dawn
For I was child of (the) Gods
Father please come get me now
And take me to a better place
Yes there were drums in the distance		 
Heralding the end of days
Come and see my final act
Of despair and of regret 
Wonât see a brand new dawn
For I was child of (the) Gods
All for this day, this twisted glory
Still Iâm wondering why

Canât hear it, canât see it, canât feel it, canât hide it
Donât need this damnation
When all I sought was salvation
Canât hear it, canât see it, canât feel it, canât hide it
Donât need forgotten glory
Still canât help but wonder why

Have the Gods forsaken,
Have the Gods forsaken me?
Have the Gods forgotten,
Have the Gods forgotten me?

In a life itâs hardest to know which bridges to burn and which ones to cross
All these paths can surely make one scream when it all seems like a dream
Somewhere out there there is truth and there are lies, all well hidden in disguise
For what follows ends in my goodbye, still canât help but wonder why
