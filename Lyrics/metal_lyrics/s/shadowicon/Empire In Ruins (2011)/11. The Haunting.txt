[With no other refuge to escape to, Antony committed suicide by stabbing himself with his sword in the mistaken belief that Cleopatra had already done so (30 BC). When he found out that Cleopatra was still alive, his friends brought him to Cleopatra's monument in which she was hiding, and he died in her arms.]

Itâs been a long, long time since I slept in peace, so calm
Now only a shadow remains
You asked me once if I can conquer the great blue sky
In silence I can hear your cries

Sometimes I just wish that I could turn back the time and just give it all up

My heart lies in utter darkness now
So ignorant and blind
Beaten in my own game
Over and over again
I canât stop but wondering
What would be if I were free from her spell

Some days I just wish that I could turn back the time and start from anew

Now I walk alone in shame full of misery and pain
As I contemplate my final plan
All these echoes from the past in time they shall pass
As I free myself from this hell

Once a general, now a fool
I shall leave this world now...

Some days I just wish that I could turn back the time and just give it all up

[CHORUS]

Once a general, now a fool
I shall leave this world now...
Once a general, now a fool
I shall leave this world now...

Past the White Rock, past the Land of Dream,
I shall walk the Elysian Fields
Kept my soul clean, kept my soul pure,
A prayer of my soul.
