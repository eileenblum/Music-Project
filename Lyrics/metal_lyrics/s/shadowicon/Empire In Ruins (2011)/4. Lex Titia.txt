[The Second Triumvirate is the name historians give to the official political alliance of Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus (later known as Augustus), Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, and Mark Antony, formed on 26 November 43 BC with the enactment of the Lex Titia, the adoption of which marked the end of the Roman Republic. The Triumvirate existed for two five-year terms, covering the period 43 BC â 33 BC. The Lex Titia was a Roman law passed on November 27, 43 BC, that granted triumvirates the right to rule for a period of five years. It is commonly known as the law that formalized and legalized the second triumvirate of Octavian, Mark Antony and Lepidus (the first triumvirate had existed outside of the law).]

People of Rome behold,
There is something important, that has to be told:
Lex Titia â the new law of Rome.
Rise of the trinity - a new chapter has begun.

Three's company
Prepared to rule the world
Three's company
They conquer with the sword

Rotten within,
Just layers of â¦ sin! 
Our republic is no more!
Dictators side by side, governing our days, 
But they donât care about us.
Forced control of our land, our homes, our lives,
What will we become?!

Whatever will happen, whatever will come
Nothing else matters, just glory of Rome.
Three's company - prepared to rule the world
Three's company - they conquered with the sword
Whatever will happen, whatever will come
Nothing else matters, just glory of Rome.

[CHORUS]
