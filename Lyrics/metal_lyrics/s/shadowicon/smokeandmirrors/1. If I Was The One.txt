[Verse #1:]
I am a liar in a distant empty place.
Nowhere to hide, in all this vacant space.
I am a cheat, a bastard and a king of fools.
I must be the only one who knows the truth.

[Bridge #1:]
Tell me your secrets, Iâll tell you mine.
Make me believe that you see through the lies.
Give me the strength to open my eyes!

[Chorus #1:]
If I was the oneâ¦
If I was the one who knows.
The future I could foresee;
I would be free!

[Verse #2:]
I may be here; at least my body is.
But (my) heart I left behind these walls!
You haven't built a cage so strong
To hold my will imprisoned!

[Chorus #2:]
If I was the oneâ¦
If I was the one who knows.
My eyes would see beneath;
I would believe!

[Bridge #3:]
I'm not a saint â¦ I know.
I've paid for my sins so many times before!
What lies beneath but is above?

[Chorus #3:]
If I was the oneâ¦
If I was the one who knows.
The future I could foresee;
I would be free!
My eyes would see beneath,
I could believe!
