[Verse #1:]
I look at pictures of a world that was
My memories fading on this cold, lonely day
No gleam of light just darkness all around
Iâm hurt and broken, trying to ... to escape ... from this lie!

[Verse #2:]
Now I dream of a better world, but I feel I dream of dreams
When Iâm awake I sit back and see the world staring back at me
I don't want to laugh and cry, don't like to question why
And the shards of the mirror reflect a phantom with no respect.

[Chorus #1:]
This is my only plea:
âTo leave me on my own; to fade away from all I seeâ
To shatter in debris.

[Verse #3:]
Wild thoughts both dark and deep, my madness I will keep
Night after night I will set you free as long as you believe in me.

[Bridge#3:]
Mirror, Mirror on the wall
Will I fall and burn tonight?

[Chorus #2:]
This is my only plea:
âTo leave me on my own; to fade away from all I seeâ
To shatter in debris.

[Verse #4 (Interlude Verse):]
A world of destruction
A world of war and hate
A world that kills us all
And makes us want to die!

[Chorus #3/1:]
This is my only plea:
âTo leave me on my own; to fade away from all I seeâ
To shatter in debris.

[Chorus #3/2 (Modulation):]
This is my plea...
This is my plea...
