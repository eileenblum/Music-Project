[Verse #1:]
Not a day like any other, they
Tried to warn me, make me walk away.
Said I was lost, I was going astray.
Throwing vain, empty words my way.

This road is mine to take,
I may shiver but I will never break.

[Bridge #1:]
Thereâs something else in store.
To dream within a dream,
I'm never giving in.

[Chorus #1:]
Shadow's holding me.
Keeping company
As I stand on
The edge of a ledge
I am going down,
Release my thorns and crown.
To meet you underground
In madness that remains.

[Verse #2:]
Not a day like any other day.
Quietly left with nothing to say
At the edge you can hear no noise,
The silence is louder than your voice.

Only this and nothing more
This moment I have been waiting for.

[Bridge #2:]
Thereâs someone down, I see.
Believe me dear I know,
You're waiting there for me.

[Chorus #2:]
Shadow's holding me.
Keeping company
As I stand on
The edge of a ledge
I am going down,
Release my thorns and crown.
To meet you underground
In madness that remains.

[Chorus #3:]
Shadow follows me.
My last company
As I leap from the edge
I am free.
Iâm falling down,
Free from fear and doubt.
To meet you underground
In madness that remains.

Only madness now remains.
