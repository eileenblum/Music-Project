[Verse #1:]
Iâve reached for dreams into a childâs heart,
Itâs innocence.
It feels as I am the last one,
That cannot feel.
Too much Iâve given away,
I let myself bleed.
Iâve been picturing that day
That all begun.

Now I see through a mirror, darkly!

[Bridge  #1:]
Help me, help me, get it out!
Get it, take it out of sight!!

[Chorus #1:]
Iâll step into your dreams,
Iâll find out where youâve been.
Iâll make you wish you were
Already dead.
Iâll be the one that scares,
The one that doesnât end!
Iâll climb deep down inside
And make you cry!

[Verse #2:]
Try to look straight into my eyes.
Does your reflection lie?
A replica of a person you once were,
just before we met.
Do you feel that thing inside,
That runs through your head?
Were the thoughts you once had,
Not yours to have?

Now I see through a mirror, darkly!

[Chorus #2:]
Iâll step into your dreams,
Iâll find out where youâve been.
Iâll make you wish you were
Already dead.
Iâll be the one that scares,
The one that doesnât end!
Iâll climb deep down inside
And make you cry!

Now I see through a mirror, darkly!

[Chorus #3:]
Iâll step into your dreams,
Iâll find out where youâve been.
Iâll make you wish you were
Already dead.
Iâll be the one that scares,
The one that doesnât end!
Iâll climb deep down inside
And make you cry!
