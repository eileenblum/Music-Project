[Intro:]
In front of your eyes,
Hidden right in front of your eyes.
(The) beauty of a rose
So uniquely disguised.

[Verse #1:]
Only candlelight
And scattered voices in the night.
Always from the back of mind,
Looking for someone to find â¦ you!

[Bridge #1:]
Release you from that place, restore your grace.
But the one who tamed your heart has never left your side.

[Verse #2:]
Eyes are blind, the essence is not theirs to find.
You've made her your own,
The rose is now one of a kind.

[Bridge #2:]
Take another breathâ¦
The one who tamed your heart is never out of sight.

[Chorus #1:]
Look all the stars are smiling,
You know that there's, someone there, thatâs watching over you.
When every soul is leaving,
Remember now, youâre not alone. Iâm staying here with you.

[Bridge #3:]
Take another breath, live another day.
The one who tamed your heart is never out of sight.

[Chorus #2:]
Look all the stars are smiling,
You know that there's, someone there, thatâs watching over you.
When every soul is leaving,
Remember now, youâre not alone. Iâm staying here with you.

[Chorus #3 (Modulation):]
Staying here with you ... Iâm staying here with you.
Staying here with you ... Iâm staying here with you.
