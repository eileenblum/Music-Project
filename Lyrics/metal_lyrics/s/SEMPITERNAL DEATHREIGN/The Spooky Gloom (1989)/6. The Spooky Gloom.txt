Harassed by the gloaming
Darkened skies are coming
Invaders from above descend
Descending from another land
Haze creates a spooky gloom
Participate your fuckin' doom
The wound of darkness open bleeds
A talisman is what you need

Face the creatures of the night
Beyond your wildest thoughts of mind
Born out of a darkful ass
Intensively You're horrified
Beyond the air you can't see through
Another world of gloomy doom
Permanent In memory
Never no more fantasy

In the fog
You have no sight
The spooky gloom
There is no more
Your fear has died
Is crawling around you
