The urge to all your needs
The cause to all your deeds
Why within your soul
Your sick thoughts are to grow?

Superficial cubism
Mentally in extremist
Immersed in sarcasm
Dear god, what is this we're goin' through?
Nauseous to oneself and each other
In philosophic fantatism
The source of social sadism
And ideal place for
Creep-o-rama
Creep-o-rama
The devil in your all
Your size in bad stands tall
Drifted from the sane
Your trip to hell's arranged

Tremendous hole
Take this life
Crawl it deep
End the vice
To be free
Them and me
Eternally
