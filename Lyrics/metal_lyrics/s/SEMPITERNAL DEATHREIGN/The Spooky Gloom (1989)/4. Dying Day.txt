On my dying bed
I'm thinking about the life I had
My children are crying around
Hoping I won't fall asleep

I'm wondering how it'll be
I'll close my eyes soon probably
Anxious for a god or something like that
Stop crying, I'm not dead yet

Horror imaginations
Running through my mind
Panice exaltations
Of their worst kind

As I vomit blood
My brain starts to die
View then from above
Ice cold as I lie
