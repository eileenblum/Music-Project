Dead outta ground
Horrible sound
New life they have found
Storming through the city
Awoken morning
Dead for many years, are we now unburied

Resurrection cemetery
For second life
Resurrection cemetery
Resurrection cemetery
For flesh they strife
Resurrection cemetery

Buried in the deep
Risen from their sleep
Be pleased to meet the creeps
Storming through the city
Awoken dawn
Destined to be a zombie

Resurrection cemetery
For second life
Resurrection cemetery
Resurrection
For flesh they strife
Resurrection cemetery
