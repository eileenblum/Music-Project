What ever happened to Celtic Frost?
Is it true that they got lost
in the pandemonium
Never to be seen again
Tom Warrior fell from a tree in cherry orchard
Martin Ain drowned in a cold lake
Reed St. Mark went to Mega Therion
and remains there 'till this day
Tom Warrior is waiting for the emperor's return
Martin Ain's trapped in the circle of tyrants
Reed St. mark was blinded in the crypt of rays
where he remains 'till this day
