I can't believe you ever thought I even gave a shit for everyone
except my friends and family
Go and ask me bout the world, yeah I could give a fuck
you want to make things right, well go ahead, just don't ask me.
save the fish, save the trees, save the air
Well what about the children?
Mother natures come to frag our fuckin ass
you cared too late for a lost cause

GREEN PEACE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BLACK WAR

BLACK WAR I can't fuckin wait
burning plastic hate
choppin the trees down
black war, black war marching towards the breakdown

You tell me things I say are, violent, mean and wrong
you really think I'm violent
why don't I show you just
how violent I can be
Against your right to even have a place
to show your face
it don't take balls to walk and talk the edge that's fucking straight
you say everything we do is gonna hurt our mother earth
toxic waste and oil spills also did our mother birth
Mother natures come to frag our fucking ass
you cared to late for a lost cause

GREEN PEACE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BLACK WAR
BLACK WAR I can't fuckin wait
burning plastic hate
choppin the trees down
black war, black war marching towards the breakdown

hey, hey, hey pollution ain't gonna go away
don't free Willy I say kill him today
