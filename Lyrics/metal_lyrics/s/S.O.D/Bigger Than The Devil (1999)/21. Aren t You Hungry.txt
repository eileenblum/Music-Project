[M.O.D. cover]

Sitting in my kitchen stuffed from having ate
what should I do now, with what's left on my plate
maybe I should save it, but nah, I got the cash
think I'll take the easy way and throw it in the trash

USA for you okay, what a fucking scam
charity begins at home what about our land
America has problems that's what should come first
don't look to us for charity to feed and quench your thirst

aren't you hungry? are you still hungry?

looking for a free buffet, in an alley on the way
to your meeting at A.A., losers lunch is on today
chicken, finger lickin' good, mashed potatoes, gravy too!
razzberry dressing, yum! Don't you wish that you had some?

I think of people starving do you think I care?
let them all die hungry so I can breathe their air
