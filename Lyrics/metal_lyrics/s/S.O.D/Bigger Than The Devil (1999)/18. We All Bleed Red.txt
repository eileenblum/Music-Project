People divided by color or creed
won't unite to fight the powers supreme
division &amp; hypocrisy the governmental seed
freedom has a price, no, freedom isn't free
no longer can we hide in our private prison cells
we must socialize to live together well
understand, communicate,
we're practically the same
different style models of the basic human frame.

when done and said
it's in the head
we all bleed red... we all bleed red

unite! to find a better way
unite! together we'll have a say
we gotta fight together
we gotta bleed together
if need be, die together, together

when done and said
it's in the head
we all bleed red... we all bleed red

mosh...

Chinese people tinkering with nukes and human rights
Pakistan and India, your dots are so alike
the fucking English monarchy, just can't bear the sight
of their little princess Di impaled on Dodi's might

America the melting pot of nationalities
Polacks hate the Greeks who hate the Lebanese
Christian killing Protestants in the name of Christ
Israel and Palestine both think they are right

Muslims who hate everyone there's no time for you
Buddhist seeking higher grounds wake the fuck up too
people are so ignorant, why can't they understand
we all bleed red, we're all one man, we all bleed red
