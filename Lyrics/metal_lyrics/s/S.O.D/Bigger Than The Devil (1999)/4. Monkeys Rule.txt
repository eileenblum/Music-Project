I don't want this world to be like planet of the apes
who the hell put you in charge,
you only make mistakes
blow it up and tear it down
then let the apes start over?
why don't someone speak for me,
is my name fucking rover?

don't wanna go in the forbidden zone
never knowing anything outside of your home
finally realize that's there's no escape
get your filthy, stinking paws of me you damn dirty apes

most people I see are less human then an ape
cranking babies out, like factories of hate
I hate it when I have to wake up from my fantasy

where everybody works and pays taxes just like me

don't wanna go in the forbidden zone
never knowing anything outside of your home
finally realize that's there's no escape
get your filthy, stinking paws of me you damn dirty apes

lock them in a cage like a monkey in a zoo
stare at me and laugh, but I am telling you the truth
lock them in a cage like a monkey in a zoo
We'll see who laughs last the day when monkeys rise to rule
