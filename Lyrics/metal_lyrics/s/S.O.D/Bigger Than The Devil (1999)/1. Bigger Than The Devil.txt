It's been so long
since I became the undead
spreading my stain on the world
from all the slaves I've bled

carve a swastika into your head
dance around a fire wearing goat skin legs
the cult of personality none shall resist
I'm bigger than then the devil combined with Schindler's list!

You won't pay for your sins
I'll absolute every one of them
so offer your soul for Sgt. D. to claim you
cloven hoof is with your tail between your legs
Beelzebub you're through.

carve a swastika into your head
dance around a fire wearing goat skin legs
the cult of personality none shall resist
I'm bigger than then the devil combined with Schindler's list!

yes I'm bigger than Christ and his cross
yes I'm bigger than Buddha he's lost
yes I'm bigger than Allah and his lot
yes I'm bigger than the devil, his disciples and flock

I'll take you to suffer
where there's no redemption
so offer your soul for Sgt. D. to claim you
cloven hoof is with your tail between your legs
Beelzebub you're through.
