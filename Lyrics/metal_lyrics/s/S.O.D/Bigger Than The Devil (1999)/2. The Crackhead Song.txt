The governments got a deal for you
take a puff, bring along a friend too
a deal you'll make until you die
the marriage made in hell
the glass dick you won't deny

savior self not me

thanks to crack you can get a blow job for a buck
VCR with remote if you have good luck
you can find most anything at a bargain price
courtesy of the crack heads who roam your streets at night

savior self not me

thanks to crack you can't keep a nickel in your car
doors are locked windows are shut and everything's alarmed
we've become the prisoner our home a prison cell
the time has come to pay the rent and sent you back to hell

savior self not me

crackhead, crackhead burning bright, gasoline in insta-light
sold me my own stereo throw the match and watch'em glow
think you smart your almost dead, now your baked outside instead
no more brainless mindless gumbo frying deep inside that head

savior self not me

save yourself, save yourself
stop the madness save yourself
go blow your brains out with a gun
try it out, it's loads of fun... it's not like I'm recommending it, though
