I saw a pro-file sticker just other day
another fool who has no right to procreate
elbows bumping, tempers growing
veins bulge in my neck and eyes
we're just a bunch of animals
that fuck to survive... we gotta

make room, make room
spread the fuck right out
make room, make room
for the hand of doom
I built a wall around myself, form a world that's on the brink
there's a problem with my armor
cause there's just too many chinks

cyanide the water supply, take a drink and watch'em die
release ebola in the air, swell and bleed out everywhere
sarin gas for you to smell, take a train ride, next stop hell

a y2k census and we're all filled up
like a thick head of beer overflowing it's cup
a culling of humans, a matter of space
like herd management for the human race.

line'em up against the wall, aim &amp; fire, send in more
dynamite, hand grenades, cold Guyanin lemonade
Judas Priest pumpin' loud, pump your shot gut, listen-POW!
poisoned, stabbed, mass contusion, chop'em burn'em fuck it - NUKE'em
fuckin nuke'em

there's too many people
too many mouths to feed
what is the solution?
when billions need to eat
there's not enough space
nowhere to put our waste

with a little salt and pepper
how do you think we'll taste?
