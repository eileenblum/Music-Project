the tension in the air is so thick you can slice it
the general attitude is just a prelude to war
the strategy you plan must be concise &amp; decisive
the army you command must be ready to die, for

the moment of truth is finally here
it's better that you make a stand, war is near
hold your ground, never plead, They'd rather
die on their feet than live on their knees

steel and flesh clash in battle, blood stains the fields
bodies burst, limbs are severed still they don't yield
3000,000 adversaries dressed in their best
300 Spartans stand as one they're not so impressed

the moment of truth is finally here
it's better that you make a stand, war is near
hold your ground, never plead, They'd rather
die on their feet than live on their knees
Go! Fight! Fuck! Kill
Spartans!
We may not live beyond this day
the hot gates stand for all to see
Once we were destined to be kings
Unconquered Spartan men were we
