assholes and opinions, everyone's a saint
I say don't discriminate
let's increase the hate
manipulating governments,
the t. V. is their tool
God is saying just be praying
everything is cool
preachers praying on their flock
mounting them on holy cock
shove a bull whip up your ass
call it art, I have to laugh
our world is run by power hungry,
selfish, greedy pricks

they want us to divide,
unite and turn the tide

kill, kill, kill
kill the assholes! kill all the assholes!
we're gonna rise, unite and turn the tide
join in the fight, kill the assholes tonight!

politicians, looking to get their pecker piped
Jesus freaks killing in the name of human rights
ozone decay, what's the fucking deal
looking for a meteor in your unhappy meal
space ships, aliens, titanic sinks again
peace in the middle east
when will the madness end?
our world is run by power hungry, selfish greedy pricks

they want us to divide, unite and turn the tide

kill, kill, kill
kill the assholes! kill all the assholes!
we're gonna rise, unite and turn the tide
join in the fight, kill the assholes tonight!

when the toilet is full you flush down the waste
and our toilet is full and is floating in space
we're human waste floating in space
human waste
