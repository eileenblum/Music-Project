It's Friday night the moon is full I'm looking for a sacrifice
My leather coat with painted goat is armor for my quest
Blood will run into my chalice fitting for unholy deeds
The cross is turned, hells unbound
Fire burns your churches down

All praise Satan... prince immortal
All praise Satan... blood and torment

The wolves are singing now
The howling beckoning
Their most unholy song
Invoke the sacrifice
A heart heard beating loud
Will beat its very last
A slit throat, life spills out
I fill my chalice now... evil is in

Sunday's here the time has come to put away the leather coat
By ten o clock I'll be in bed dreaming of my evil deeds
When day breaks the morning light
Wakes me from my deepest dreams
To be the slave who works all day sweeping up at Burger King

All praise Satan... prince immortal
All praise Satan... blood and torment

Evil, hell, Satan, goat, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun
