You see them in the front
At every fuckin' show
Fist banging maniacs
With heads that move so slow
Who wants to see a fist
Right in their fucking face
They should learn to mosh
Or leave the fuckin' place

[CHORUS]
Fist Banging Mania
Fist Banging Mania
Fist Banging Mania
Fist Banging Mania

[MOSH PART]
You know that they mean well
But it still makes you frown
Why can't they really thrash
And put their fist bangs down
Save that fist bang shit
For bands like MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e
Or when you come see us
We'll dive on top of you

[CHORUS]
