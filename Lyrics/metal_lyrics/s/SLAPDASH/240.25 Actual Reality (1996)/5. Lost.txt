Am I growing Dumb
Or just getting old
Am I getting numb 
Or just growing up
Do I speak because I've been told
Or was I told to shut up
Am I doing my best
Or am I just losing my mind
Am I here at the god's behest
Or do I walk amongst the blind

Will I find that there's still time
Or will time still be running out

Life's a game
Life's a game 
It's a shame
It's a shame
No one to blame
No one to blame
When you're falling down

Roll the dice
Roll the dice
Play it nice
Play it nice
You'll pay the price
You'll pay the price
You've lost your crown

I'm low on hope
My faith, soon gone
I feel no love
I've lost control
I cannot cope
It won't be long
'Til I've lost it all

Do I see it all
Or just what you choose to show me
How can I trust in you
After all the lies you've told me
Should I forgive and forget
Or live to regret that I forgive thee
How could I want for your love
Why should I hope for your love
Knowing that your love would kill me
Knowing that your love would kill me

Will I find that there's still time
Or will time still be running out

You can't win
You can't win
Life's a sin
Life's a sin
An once you're in
An once you're in
There's no way out

Got control
Got control
It'll rape your soul
Rape your soul
Your life unfolds
Life unfolds
So full of doubt

I'm low on hope
Life's a game
Roll the dice...
I'm low on hope
Have I lost it all
