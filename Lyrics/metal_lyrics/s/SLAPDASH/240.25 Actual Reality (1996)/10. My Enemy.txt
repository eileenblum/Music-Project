I try to see clear, regret, can I be saved, oh fuck it

Forcing myself to face another day
Forcing myself to face another day
Trying hard to keep myself alive
How can it be
Breeding my enemy
How can I be the one that drains myself out

I am the one

Losing my mind
Choosing my life

The face in the mirror wants me dead
The face in my mirror mimics to 
The voices
The voices in my head
My enemy I
I my enemy

The mirror stares back with an evil grin
I'm quite sure that he will never leave

How can it be
Breeding my enemy
How can I be the one that drains myself out

Am I to blame
Confront myself

How can it be
Breeding my enemy
How can I be the one that drains myself out

Am I the one

Losing my mind
Choosing my life

The face in the mirror wants me dead
The face in my mirror mimics to 
The voices
The voices in my head
My enemy I
I my enemy

A different world, one of love and peace
Refuse to whore for corporate industries

The face in the mirror wants me dead
The face in my mirror mimics to 
The voices
The voices in my head
My enemy I
I my enemy
