A frantic journey in your soul
Protect your mind with fear
You're so good, you know it all
Which makes your conscience clear
Regressive feelings run through you
Your final hour is here
Eternal rest screams out its call
A silent sleep is near

The words you said has left me dead
Possessive
I'm bound to fail

Too late-I'm bound to
Deviate- I'm bound to
Can't relate-I'm bound to
I'm bound to hate!

Regressive feelings run through you
Your final hour is near
Eternal rest screams out its call
A fearless journey in your soul
Protect your mind with fear
You're so good, you know it all
Which makes your conscience clear

The words you said has left me dead
Possessive
I'm bound to fail

Too late

A fearless journey in your soul
Protect your mind with fear
You're so good, yeah
Which makes your fucking conscience 
Crystal  clear

Too late-I'm bound to
Deviate- I'm bound to
Can't relate-I'm bound to

Too late
