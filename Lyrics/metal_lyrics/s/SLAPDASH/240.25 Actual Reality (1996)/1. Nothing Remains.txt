Ain't done much about nothing
I can't face all of this rage
It Fills me up, left to drown
From inside
A wish to hide

Why am I sent here 
Where nothing remains
Am I sent here 
Where nothing remains

The truth I cannot bend or break
Is the one I cannot understand
What I cannot mend or fake
I can't comprehend
Comprehend

I can't face all my fears
I ain't the same no more
The one you thought you knew
Has slowly died
The truth you told me was all and a lie

Why am I sent here 
Where nothing remains
Am I sent here 
Where nothing remains

The truth I cannot bend or break
Is the one I cannot understand
What I cannot mend or fake
I can't comprehend

Why am I here 
Nothing remains
Nothing at all
Nothing at all
