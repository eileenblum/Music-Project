Morning sun sets another day
Lights up my world ten shades of gray
I find no strength Iâve lost it all
No one's around when I take the fall

Day by day all moulded gray
It's all the same not much to say
You spoke to me with silver tongue
Spoke of times to come as past begun
Tope my soul with velvet lies
Then buried trust under pale bruised skies

Iâm on my own
I can't count anymore on you
Iâm on my own
All the lies that you told Iâve seen through

I can't take another day
All the colors turned to gray

Iâm leaving everything behind
Iâm so fed up there's nothing more to find

Walls closing in on who I used to be
Within my mind rage roaming free
Insomniac state of inebriety
Turned my back on whatâs sanity

Iâm on my own...

I can't take another day
All the colors turned to gray
Iâm on my own leaving everything behind
So fed up there's nothing more to...find

Iâm leaving everything behind...

Iâm on my own
I can't count anymore on you
Iâm on my own
all my doubts has come true
Iâm on my own
I can't count anymore on you
Iâm on my own
all the lies that you told Iâve seen through
