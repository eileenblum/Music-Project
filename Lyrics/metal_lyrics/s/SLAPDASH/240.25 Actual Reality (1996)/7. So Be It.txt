Welcome to this human hell
Where justice won't be served
Join me in a world gone mad
If you have got the nerve

Like a time bomb 
The world set to explode

Do you feel that you are lost
Do you feel alone
You share this world with billions of people
But really, who do you know
...No one

No regret, passing on the blame
Nothings left, passing on the shame
So be it, no regret, so be it

Attracted by all the violence
That feeds your empty brain
Introduces you to reality
Your pleasure turns to pain

Like a time bomb 
The world set to explode

Welcome to this 
If you have got the nerve

I dare you

No regret, passing on the blame
Nothings left, passing on the shame
Realize, reality won't go away
Suffer it, there's no other way
So be it, no regret, so be it

Do you feel that you are lost
But really, who do you know
...No one
No regret
Passing on
