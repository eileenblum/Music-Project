I hear you, I feel you
Inside my scattered brain
I felt to pure, so cleansed out
But I can't remove the stains
Remove the stains

I'm walking, so blindly
On through life's minefield
So naked, all stripped down
Without a protecting shield
Soulless

I smell you, I taste you
Even though you're not around
I'm soulless but so strong
And no one knows just what I've found
Just what I've found

Can't see the true meaning
Of human sacrifice
Can't take the strain to put up with all my own lies

Why can't I see, you're all around
No use to look, cuz you cant be found
Why can't I see, you cant be found
Why can't I see, you're all around
Soulless

I fear you, I feel you
Inside my battered brain
I felt to pure, so cleansed out
But I can't remove the stains
Remove the stains

I'm walking so blindly
Soulless
