A dead man walks through his life
As hypnotized, starts to see through
What used to be, blindfolded eyes
Lost images comes to numb mind

Stops dead halt and rechecks his view
And suddenly everything seems new
Slowly yet but with steady pace
A life in black turns a darker blue

Born again, as an old man
Realize all time was spent
Born again, old man
Dead man

A dead man stand alone
As mesmerized, then he turns around
He drops his noose from his hand
And starts to walk, a newborn member of the humankind

Dependence gone
Once out of hand
New born self control
Trust in his own mind
Dependence gone

A dead man walks through his life
As hypnotized, starts to see through
What used to be, blindfolded eyes
Stops dead halt and rechecks his view
And suddenly everything seems new

Born again
Dependence gone
