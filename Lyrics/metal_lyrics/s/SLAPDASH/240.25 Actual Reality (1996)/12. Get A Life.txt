Don't you blame me
Look to yourself first
A creation fades
You bite the hand that feeds you
And spit in my face

Give up on yourself
Give up on yourself and all
Give up on yourself

If I cannot help you
Then which way will you turn
I've offered you my open hand
I'm the only bridge that you have not burned

Losing control
You are
Losing control
Over something you've never had
So get yourself a ... life

Don't you 
Come fucking look to me
Cause you're in need
You've stabbed the ones
That truly did believe in you
Just to watch 'em bleed

Give up on yourself
Give up on yourself and all
Give up on yourself

If I cannot help you
Losing control
You are
Losing control
Over something you've never had
So get yourself a ... life
Control, something you've never had
Controlled, So get a fucking life

No wonder
That you look as half-past dead
Hypodermic scars
You've turned into a shadow figure
The poisons left its mark

Losing control
You are
Get a fucking life
Bitch
