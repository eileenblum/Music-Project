You live a life of make pretense
But you just can't see
You live a lie until the end
You did as you was told
So easy to see
What they've done to bring you down

You can't ignore 
The facts of whats wrong or right
So what's your life about

Follow
From the Cradle
Follow
To the grave

Your cries wont help you now
Cuz for all these years the lies they told
Stuck like glue to your mind
Read 'em, heard 'em, until they became 
The voice of truth
Try to see what they do to fool
You around

You can't ignore

Follow

You can't ignore 
The facts of what's wrong or right
You can't ignore 
You can't give in
The facts of what's wrong or right
Wrong or right
Anymore

Follow
From the Cradle
To the grave
Follow

There's leaders and followers 
I follow not
