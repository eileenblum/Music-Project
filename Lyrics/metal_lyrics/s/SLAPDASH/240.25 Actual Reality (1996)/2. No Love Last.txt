Just as words are nothing worth
When kept unspoken
All love given was gone lost and left
Crippled and broken

Crippled and broken

All love given gone to waste
All tears shed turned to liquid hate
All feelings lost their taste
'cause no love, no love lasts

No love
No love left
No love (love)
No love lost

Truth hurts and time heals slow
I'll cry unseen
All love given gone lost only alive
Within a dream

Within a dream

No love
No love left
No love (love)
No love lost

(each drop served soothes the pain
I'm done with crying
each glass emptied fills my brain of memories
of my self-denying)

No love, no love, no love, no love

(shiny happy people slowly killing me
don't they know
that a pot on the shoulder don't mean shit
when a person's lost at sea...)

No love, no love, no love, no love
