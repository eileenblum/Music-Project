In a dying town 
across the endless sea of sand 
death awaits the followers too blind to see 
The interloper. The chosen one 
Crucify them in the dust 
Their time has come 

In his eyes/in his hands 
Relentless in the hunt 
the deathless one will bury them all 

Betrayer on cloven hoof 
Like an iron fist 
he will bring the hammer down 
Their voices rise and fall 
One above them all 
Their eyes pierce through the shadows 
rank with hate and fear 

The world is moving on 
back into the sea 
Bound for the setting sun 
none left to speak 
There in the failing light 
the bodies left behind 
Set sail through tides of sand 
if only in my mind
