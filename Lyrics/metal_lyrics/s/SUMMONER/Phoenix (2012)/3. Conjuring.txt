Sands shifting under feet 
Luring siren's call 
Cast down from skies 
Conjuring 

Within the shadows of the mountain 
Past the great divide 
Melds time and space 

Beyond horizons 
where the black swans lie 
A tempest rises 
bringing endless night 

What the tide brings 
A dark change 
A new doom has come
