Winged Hessians ride 
through the outer realms 
past the ancient fjords 
where elders wait 

Sky riders ascend 
up the misty mountain 
to the fire breather 
Awaken at last 

The alter brought down 
Ancient rites silenced 
The order of the moon 
A time to rise 

Dormant spirit in black 
break free of sleep 
return to reign once more 
Take back your throne
