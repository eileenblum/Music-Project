Dead Moon rising 
Open floodgates 
Come down in waves 
Everlasting night, the end of days. 

Echoes in silence radiate and fall like rays of fire 

Harvest of fire 
lights up a starless sky 
Dead moons rising 
sets eyes ablaze with burning light 
We watched the towers fall 
Within the shadows 
among the ruins 
secrets held behind the vale
