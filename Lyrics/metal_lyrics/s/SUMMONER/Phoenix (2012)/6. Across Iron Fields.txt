Sun burns my soul 

Through the iron fields 
where the sand meets sky 
A vast stretch of nothingness 
All that's left behind 
Then in blinding light 
a horizon reveals 
peaks rising to the sky 
Our fate is sealed 

Through the Iron Fields 
over desert sands 
we march to the sea 
leave behind the sun 

There in the distance 
where the land meets sea 
hear voices on the wind 
cry out to me 

There on distant shore 
I am whole again 
The journey to the sea 
has led me and left here
