Voices carry in the night 
Winter's chill 
has eased its grip 
I'm lying still 
with old ghosts 
while cool breeze passes over me 

I watched the dead sun set 
under a burning sky 
High above it all I see 
my time pass by 
Now in the emptiness 
the last fading light 
Darkness consuming me 
as it all goes black 

Let the Light In
