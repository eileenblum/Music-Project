Down from the hill 
that washed away 
a foreign wind 

Up from below 
drawn into sky 
crawling over land 
Reclaimer 

The Sea no longer guides on 
Weathered eyes look to the sky 

These barren lands 
once buried deep 
below the tide 

Now desert sea 
descend to dust 
Return to Earth again 

Red sun black sky 
Surrender to the void 
burning to my soul
