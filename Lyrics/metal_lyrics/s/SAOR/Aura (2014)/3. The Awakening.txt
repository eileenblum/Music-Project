To truly understand the essence of antiquity
Learn the lore of the land
Become the atavist
Embark on a journey
Through the aeons of time

Ã¨irich!

Like the druid
And wanderers of old
Follow the celestial compass
Towards the ether
And beyond the illusion of God

Ã¨irich!

O, reignite the flame
Sacred fire of ancient ways
And forge an iron will
Within your heart and soul
This age will rot and decay
But stay focussed
Do not stray
From the overgrown path
Your forefathers once tread
