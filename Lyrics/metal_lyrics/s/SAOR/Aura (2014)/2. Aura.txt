I see there woods, and I see there thickets,
I see there the fair and most fertile of meadows;
I see there the deer on the ground in the corries
Hiding in mantles of mist.

Lofty mountains and resplendent ledges,
There dwell my own folk, kind folk of honour.
Light is my step as I leap up to meet them;
'Tis with pleasure I'll stay there a while.
