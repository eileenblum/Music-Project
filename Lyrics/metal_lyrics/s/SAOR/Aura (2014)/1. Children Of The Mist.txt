We've been searching for answers in a distant place
We've discovered lost wisdom in a long forgotten age
We are heathens re-born
Sons and daughters of valour and lore
We are the haunters of woods, glens, lochs and shores

Our blood runs through the veins of this sacred earth
We are bound to this ancient land

Like rampant lions we'll roar and break free from these chains
We will never surrender to this age of degeneracy
With pride as our weapon and honour as our shield
We will never be enslaved, we shall never yield!
