As the ocean swallows the sun
Shadows appear on the horizon
White headed peaks crowned by the dying light
Mark the funeral of day and the birth of the night

I begin my ascent
Towards the pillars of the earth

As I stumble along this meandering path
The bitter wind sweeps aside waves of mist
Perched on the throne of the mountain
I now gaze out onto the desolate plain
As I let my thoughts swim amongst aurora's light

Tonight I have conquered the stars
