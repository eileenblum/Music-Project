Buried in this soil
Are roots that go deep
Like scars etched in the earth
Ancient wounds, a reminder
Of a distant age
When the heart of the mountain
Pounded in every proud mans chest
Of forgotten oath
When blood and honour
Spoke to every true man's soul

"Scotia's thistle guards the grave
Where repose her dauntless brave
Never yet the foot of a slave
Has trod the wilds of Scotia" *

Never forget
Their sacrifice

[* Verse from the poem "Scotia's Thistle" by Henry Scott Riddell]
