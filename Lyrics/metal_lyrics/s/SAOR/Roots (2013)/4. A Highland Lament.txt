We are sorrow's children
Torn from Alba's womb
A reflection of fallen martyrs
The lifeblood of this land

We are the mountains of heather
And the desolate moorland below
Aurora and darkness
The pathos of the afterglow

We are the forsaken
Ancient echoes in the breeze
The fallen leaves of autumn
Withering away
