Lords of fighters, king of the field
There is no stopping, see him and yield

[CHORUS:]
No price to pay but death [x2]
See him raging, 'til your last breath
No price to pay but death

Master of spear, axe, sword and mace
If you'll survive, it's by his grace

The only price is death [x2]

His domain the width and the length
To which he can his war tools extend

[CHORUS]

No one is equal, he is supreme
Lord of chaos, his wrath is extreme

[CHORUS]
