The path we follow, no matter how
In the dark it shall be, we'll never bow
Faith at our side, we stand tall
No senses count, pride above all

[CHORUS:]
I.........foresee
A path in the dark
It's.......to me
Like the sky to the lark
You...........should see
To the moon we........bark

Roads will be found, by you and us
You'll need to pray, don't know what to seek
We'll make you prey, you'll never stand tall
Senses don't count, faith above all

[CHORUS]

[REPEAT VERSE II]

[CHORUS]
