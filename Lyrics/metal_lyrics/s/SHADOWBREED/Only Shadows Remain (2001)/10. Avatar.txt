Lords of fighters, king of the field
There is no stopping, see him and yield

No price to pay but death
No price to pay but death
See him raging, 'til your last breath
No price to pay but death

Master of spear, axe, sword and mace
If you'll survive, it's by his grace

The only price is death
The only price is death

His domain the width and the length
To which he can his war tools extend

No price to pay but death
No price to pay but death
See him raging, 'til your last breath
No price to pay but death

No one is equal, he is supreme
Lord of chaos, his wrath is extreme

No price to pay but death
No price to pay but death
See him raging, 'til your last breath
No price to pay but death
