a seared red sea
dead history is
delivered and divided
in the line of the nile
pythagorean egypt
raised the house
of hades and the dead
opened the book
in sinai sin is a
golden nature
a liminal animal
existing in exile
for forty years
the desert rests
listen silent
let the letters tell
