She's hidden her babies away

Their soft, gummy smiles
won't be gilding the menu

The deer fly, the sand fly
the tsetse can't find them

The goon from the Stasi
is left far behind them

Their delicate derma
won't witness a ray

She's hidden her babies away

She's hidden her babies away

No "Raindrops on roses"
"Whiskers on kittens"

They refuse to be blinded
by Rubens or Poussin

They'll hardly be boarding
the 12:10 to Tucson

Is she shaking them hard
in dry run cabaret?

She's hidden her babies away

Ho,Ho,watenay
Ho,Ho,watenay
Ho,Ho,watenay
I'm closing in
I'm closing in

She's hidden her babies away

And why bring them out
with no shelter on offer

The nurseries and creches
are heaving with lush lice

Bubonic, blue-blankets,
run ragged with church mice

The Havana has died
in the clam-shell ashtray

She's hidden her babies away

She's hidden her babies away

From posed, high,
pelvic bridges

Pearly bone
mountain ridges

No hiccupy silence
to finger their traces

No colicky moon
shines bright pain
on their faces

She has slipped
through the dark
like a mother moray

She's hidden her babies away

Ho,Ho,watenay
Ho,Ho,watenay
Ho,Ho,watenay
I'm closing in
I'm closing in

I've come searching,
from far and away

A r-e-a-c-h-i-n-g,L-o-n-g-A-r-m-e-d
vet ape
feeling hard
for a breech birth

I gaze up at the night
at the asterisk's blazing,

till they straighten,
and like tiny spines,
fall to earth

I bite down on this,
as I dance
and I pray

She's hidden her babies away
