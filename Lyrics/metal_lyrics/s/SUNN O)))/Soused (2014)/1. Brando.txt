Ah, The Wide Missouri

Dwellers on the bluff

Across The Wide Missouri

Never enough
No
Never enough

Whip-poor-will
Whip-poor-will

Scissoring high in the trees

A beating would do me a world of good
Sneakin' by
Sneakin' by

I am down on my knees

A beating would do me a world of good

I took it from Saxon

I took it from Dad

I took it from Fat Johnny Friendly

From 3 vigilantes

I took if for Wild One
And the for my sin

I took it from Lizabeth again and again
