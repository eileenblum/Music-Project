Red, blade points
knife the air

All night
he sees it

Constellating
his thought

Acne on
a leper

Red, blade points
disappear

Sets
it's blackness
glistening

Curling
and winding
through
grip mangled
fingers

Bristling
and
glittering

No
Nothing else
lingers

Gleam away
little brute
Gleam away

Gleam away
little brute
Gleam away

As if,
after waving
Capon claws
over ashes,

A single
talon
should
lower-

and silently
plow,

he carves
the ghost
mascot
the length
of his skin

Stilettoed
without
interruption

The body
including
the face

On a bed
in the dark,

without 
interruption

He imagines
he feels it
tugging and
cinching,

hears it
rustling and
rising,

the naked
intaglio-

lifting free
of its flesh,

silently prowling
from window to
window

There is
No Nothing
else

There is
No Nothing
else

Flip
was a charmer
and so
was I

Zip
was a devil
and so
was I

Can't afford,
but bescumber,
our spunk-stiffened
-tresses

as we stroll
in the glut
trimmed
in frilly
and furs

Tell us
apart,
we can never
die

Tell us
apart,
we can never
die

Fluffed
and the
fluffer,
fluffing
goodbye

Arm and arm
Arm and arm

in our feathers
and blood

Choo-Choo
Choo-Choo,
Mama

Cursing
the rummy
cluck

Choo-Choo
Choo-Choo,
Mama

How
do you lose
your luck?

Choo-Choo
Choo-Choo,
Mama,

In the dark
lopping off
all interruption,

How
do you lose
your luck?

How
do you lose
your luck?

Red, blade points
knife the air

All night
he sees it

Constellating
his thought

Acne on
a leper
