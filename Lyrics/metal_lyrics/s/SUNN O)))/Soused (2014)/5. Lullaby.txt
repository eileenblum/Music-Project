Tonight

my assistant
will pass among
you

His cap
will be empty

Hey non-e
non-e

The most intimate
personal choices
and requests
central to your
personal dignity
will be sung

Hey non-e
non-e

Why don't minstrels
go from house
to house
howling songs
the way they
used to?

In vain I
bind another
foot

In vain
and now
the other
foot

LULLABY

You can tell

My sweet
little darling

My comfort
and joy

LULLABY

You can tell

In beauty
surpassing
are prince's
of Troy

Some are born
to it

You can tell

Some are made
to do it

Some allowed

When I

Hey non-e

Why don't painters
paint their cloudy
spines
chiaroscuro
the way they
used to?

In vain I
douse
another lamp

In vain
and now
another lamp
