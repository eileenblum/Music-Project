nanksyaty ayur balam smrtih

[Translation:]
Sukadeva Gosvami said: Then, O King, religion, truthfulness, cleanliness, tolerance, mercy,
duration of life, physical strength and memory will all diminish day by day because of the
powerful influence of the age of Kali.

[SB 12.2.2]

vittam eva kalau nrnam
janmacara-gunodayah
dharma-nyaya-vyavasthayam
karanam balam eva hi

[Translation]
In Kali-yuga, wealth alone will be considered the sign of a manâs good birth,
proper behavior and fine qualities. And law and justice will be applied only on
the basis of oneâs power.

[SB 12.2.3]

mayaiva vyavaharike
stritve pumstve ca hi ratir
vipratve sutram eva hi

[Translation]
Men and women will live together merely because of superficial attraction,
and success in business will depend on deceit. Womanliness and manliness
will be judged according to oneâs expertise in sex, and a man will be known
as a brahmana just by his wearing a thread.

[SB 12.2.4]

A personâs spiritual position will be ascertained merely according to external symbols,
and on that same basis people will change from one spiritual order to the next.
A personâs propriety will be seriously questioned if he does not earn a good living.
And one who is very clever at juggling words will be considered a learned scholar.

sadhutve dambha eva tu
svikara eva codvahe
snanam eva prasadhanam

accepted as virtue. Marriage will be arranged simply by verbal agreement,
and a person will think he is fit to appear in public if he has merely taken a bath.

[SB 12.2.6]

dure vary-ayanam tirtham
lavanyam kesa-dharanam
udaram-bharata svarthah
satyatve dharstyam eva hi

daksyam kutumba-bharanam
yaso ârthe dharma-sevanam

[Translation]
A sacred place will be taken to consist of no more than a reservoir of water
located at a distance, and beauty will be thought to depend on oneâs hairstyle.
Filling the belly will become the goal of life, and one who is audacious will be
accepted as truthful. He who can maintain a family will be regarded as an expert man,
and the principles of religion will be observed only for the sake of reputation.

[SB 12.2.7]

[Translation]
By the time the age of Kali ends, the bodies of all creatures will be greatly reduced
in size, and the religious principles of followers of varnasrama will be ruined.
The path of the Vedas will be completely forgotten in human society,
and so-called religion will be mostly atheistic. The kings will mostly be thieves,
the occupations of men will be stealing, lying and needless violence,
and all the social classes will be reduced to the lowest level of sudras.
Cows will be like goats, spiritual hermitages will be no different from mundane houses,
and family ties will extend no further than the immediate bonds of marriage.
Most plants and herbs will be tiny, and all trees will appear like dwarf sami trees.
Clouds will be full of lightning, homes will be devoid of piety,
and all human beings will have become like asses.
At that time, the Supreme Personality of Godhead will appear on the earth.
Acting with the power of pure spiritual goodness, He will rescue eternal religion.

Lord Kalki, the Lord of the universe, will mount His swift horse Devadatta and,
sword in hand, travel over the earth exhibiting His eight mystic opulences and eight special
qualities of Godhead. Displaying His unequaled effulgence and riding with great speed,
He will kill by the millions those thieves who have dared dress as kings.
