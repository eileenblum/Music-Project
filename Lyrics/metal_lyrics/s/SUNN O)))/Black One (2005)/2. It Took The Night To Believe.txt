perverted within a viewing
standing alone
it took the night to believe
the beacon lingers
come to grasp
to the edge of orion
repeatedly defiling the wind's daughter
cry yourself to ash
what is destroyed by fire
a perfect silhouette
dialates full
the withering egg
unurished
cloak thyself
in salutations of crescent eye

vibrate
believe
vibrate
defile
vibrate
believe
vibrate
defile
