Vowing to never rest 
despite strenuous effort 
Her head split into 11 pieces 
Her two arms shattered into pieces 
Amitabha came to her aid 
and appointed her thousand arms 
an immortal 
Shown in a white flowing robe 
a water jar and willow branch 
in her hands 
The daughter of the cruel king 
The tree misfortunes to come 
she allowed herself to die 
at the hand of an executioner 
But his axe shattered into a thousand of pieces 
The sword shattered too 
The arrows all weared off 
It is because of this 
Yanluo the king of hell sent her back to 
prevent the utter destruction of his realm 
Standing atop of a dragon 
Sending pearl of light
