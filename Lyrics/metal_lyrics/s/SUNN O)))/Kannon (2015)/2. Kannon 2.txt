Suffering of the people as they are 
Suffering of the people as they fall ill 
She caused death 
The tiger who feasted 
Forgotten 
Led her hellish realm of dead  
She played such music 
Flowers blossomed 
And turned hell 
Into paradise 
She played such music 
Flowers blossomed 
Forgotten 
Led her hellish realm of dead 
She caused death 
The tiger who feasted
