Whispering soft words into her ear
Stroking her neck telling her sweet words

Gently stroking her vagina wet
While she moans I fell like spewing

I kiss her neck, say she's a whore
While forcing my arm into her cunt
Slowly I reach fore my knife and smile
Time to die

Screaming crying,
Fighting to get free
I slit her throat
While squeezing my seed
I slice the bowel open
Rip, tear, slice the organs
Feeding on her ovaries

Sucking her uterus clean
Kiss her goodbye
Wha ha ha ha.......

Well fed and enjoyed
He disembowels her
Sitting in her remains crying
Wondering what went wrong

Interior guts and gore
Around limbs and arms
Slippery bloody and messy
Scratch ones head in a thought

A moment of silence
Your world of sorrow
Is my addiction
And they say I am deranged?
