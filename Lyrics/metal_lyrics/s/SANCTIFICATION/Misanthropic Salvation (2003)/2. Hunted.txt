DEAD!
Always hunted always followed
Hunted always hunted
Ghost in the nights
Lurking in the dark
Hiding always following me

Feel something near

Running away, feeling so afraid
Something in the unknown
A sweep of cold air passes beside of me
My skin curves as i freeze

As like time stopped

Whispering so quiet, I can't hear
The voice come close I can hear

Feel the knife, cut the spine
Blood's pouring down, this is real!

In the darkest tunnel
Hunted by the unknown
As i run in the darkness
Scared for my life
I fall upon my knees
As he hovers over me
As he drinks my blood
And the circle is completed
