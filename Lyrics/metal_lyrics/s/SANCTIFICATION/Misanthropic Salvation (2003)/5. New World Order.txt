Armed with darkness
The way of the dark order
Blood shall be spilled

We the sanctified ones
Ruler of the new world
As you speak we create
In triumph we slowly rise

Dark is the path to oblivion
With pure hate we strike
No one can tear the wall we built
Bond of human blood

BLOOD AND SOUL!

You and your pathetic ones
Shall bow before us
Kneel your parasites
Kneel for masters
See the flame burn
See our blood boil
Feel our wrath
So kneel or be burned
Hail the new world order
And you'll be spared.
