Torture my soul in hell
I bring you despair and pain

Feel the wrath of god!
From darkness I'll rise

Steal my fate, suffer my hate

You will crawl you will beg
I will take what is rightfully yours...

Follow me in my war
Into the darkness we dwell
Be with me, stand by me
Upon my throne I will rise
Follow me in my war
Into our torment we dwell
Hate me fear me
I am immortal I am god!
