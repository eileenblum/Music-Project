The pain is so unspeakable
It consumes my soul
It is tormenting me every day
The suffering
The endless suffering
Is eating me
Eating me alive from the inside

From the enchanting forest of pain
My soul will forever remain
In torment my body is consumed by fire
In hatred in sorrow in confusion I live

In emptiness in fulfilment in destruction
Living dying it is the same

Life is about a simple dream
Don't know if you are awake or asleep
The world of fiction and reality
Are so blended together as if to be the same

Life is like a never ending disease
An incurable disease
That seems to be burying me
From the inside and soul
