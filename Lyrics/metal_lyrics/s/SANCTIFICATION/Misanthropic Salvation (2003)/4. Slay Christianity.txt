I am the sun, I am the night, 
I am the fire
I am the one with the desire

Feel the wrath of our lord
Feel the wrath of our pain
The pain that you have caused us
In two thousand years
Feel the pain burn in flames
As we slay christianity

Jehova you whore, lord of lies
HellFuck Mary, full of grace
Here comes the lord
The lord of flies
Beelzebub's my name
Feel the pain
