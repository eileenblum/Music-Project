Every day is the same
Sun goes up and sun goes down
Nothing is happening
Days go by, years go by

I despise human life
I despise their delight
I despise their vitality
For there pleasure in life

The are no pleasures
There are no delights
And there's no vitality
There is only emptiness

Fear my salvation
In darkness my temptation

Lightning embracing
And hating is facing

I despise human life
I despise their delight
I despise their vitality
For there pleasure in life

The are no pleasures
There are no delights
And there's no vitality
There are only pain

No more feeling, no more pain
All is quiet, all is sane
