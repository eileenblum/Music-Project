Fire upon my soul
Restless I've been waiting

Pain divine as i was told to believe
in their falsehood
As he said in the book of lies
"You want my fall because your thoughts isn't god's but of humanity"

So shall you follow a false god
Of believe in yourself as god
Believe the lies
Or deceive that god

One with the eternal lies of the mind
Your faith lays in your own hands
