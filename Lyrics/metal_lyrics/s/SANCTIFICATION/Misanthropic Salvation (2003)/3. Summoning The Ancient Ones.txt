I am the servant of flesh
We are the ones that you call
I am the master of evil
I am the way it should be
CHILD you have come for me
SON for who's father to be
If not me, who let you free
Who gave you the will to live

RISE the ancient ones
HEAR ME for i am yours now!

Oh lord of demons 
I summon you
Oh bringer of light
The fallen one, come forth!

As clouds are gather
Lightning strikes beside me
My eyes turn upon the hillside

Reveal the underworld for me
Oh ancient ones, from the mist

A shadow figure
Appears to be forming
it looks to be
Half beast Half man
MASTER!
