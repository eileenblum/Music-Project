Crawl upon the walls of death
Feeble-minded ones
Your disciples fallen now
They are the week ones
Crawl into our parlour of love
You the fooled one
Come into our chamber of fire
Welcome to hell!

You are now welcome back
You misguided tortured soul
As the powers enchant your veins
You'll become one with us
Paid with the lust of the world
Filled with pleasures sites
In domain of the underworld
One with darkness you're now

Crawl upon the walls of death
Feeble-minded ones
Your disciples fallen now
They are the week ones
Crawl into our parlour of hate
You the fooled one
Come into our chamber of fire
Welcome back into our domains!

As torn as the world may seem
As hatred builds
As pain converted to hate
As hate becomes like love
And boils you're BLOOD!

Crawl upon the walls of death
Feeble-minded ones
Your disciples fallen now
They are the week ones
Crawl into our parlour of pain
You the fooled one
In eternity we shall rule!

Love's hate pain's hate
With hate we rule the world
From Darkness we rise
Into the world of Christ

Behead the false on
Burn the house of god
Desecrate his word
For he no longer rules!

You are now welcome back
You misguided tortured soul
As the powers enchant your veins
You'll become one with us
Paid with the lust of the world
Filled with pleasures sites
In domain of the underworld
One with darkness you're now

With blood we shall arise
Army of darkness 
Feed upon Christians souls
As we create

As it was ment!
