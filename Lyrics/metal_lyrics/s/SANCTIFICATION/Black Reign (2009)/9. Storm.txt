Storm !

Feel the storm of agony, cloaked in blood they came
The undead swarm for victory
An endless war was meant to be
Their armours shook in measured beats
ALL HAIL THEE VICTORIOUS !

Axes smeared in blood
The war has just begun
Painful you'll see
Join us and you'll be free

My axe held high, in the sky, hold the line
Blood spilled, darkness conquer all
Drown them in their blood divine
My hatred let free

Axes smeared in blood
The war has just begun
Painful you'll see
Join us and you'll be free

Feel the storm of agony, cloaked in blood they came
The undead swarm for victory
An endless war was meant to be
Their armours shook in measured beats
ALL HAIL THEE VICTORIOUS !

Storm !
