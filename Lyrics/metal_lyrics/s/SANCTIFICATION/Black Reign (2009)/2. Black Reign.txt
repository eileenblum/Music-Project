Here we come
I smashing their heads
Feel the whiff of blood,
churches are burning.
I warm my hands in the flames of the church, I inhale! Inhale the smell of the guts and I just can't stop laughing, Behold the place they call hell.

They scream, we laugh, domination!
Heretic, agitation!

Deep in the bodies of christians the maggots are growing, eating the flesh of the christian hypocrisy.

Chaos, a fact, celebration
Antichrist act, salvation

We are the Ghouls, from the cesspools, Founders of pain, gods we become.

We will bring black reign, life won't be the same here we come again, We will bring black reign.

World domination we seek, of global domination we speak, global domination complete, global domination complete.

WE WILL BRING BLACK REIGN! WE WILL BRING BLACK REIGN!

I smashing their heads
Feel the whiff of blood,
churches are burning.
I warm my hands in the flames of the church, I inhale! Inhale the smell of the guts and I just can't stop laughing, Behold the place they call hell.
