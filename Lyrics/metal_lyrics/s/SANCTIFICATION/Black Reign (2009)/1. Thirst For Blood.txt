I woke up form a terrible dream, a dream full of guts, pain and blood, I didn't let the dream behind now i feel the thirst for blood, i don't want to do, but know what i need. i need that feeling, when i make someone bleed, i need to see blood, pumping from a vein, i need to see someone in terrible pain.

Blood is the ecstasy, blood is just what i need, make someone feel the pain, feel the anger, blood is the ecstasy, blood is just what i need, make someone feel the pain, feel the anger.

Blood is the pumping, people screaming. I thirst for blood, my fury, my anger grows out of control over my thirst for blood.

Hunted by inner feeling... Haunted!
Am i Dreaming?
Convulsions, my soul is bleeding
Perception, my soul is pleading

Blood is the ecstasy, blood is just what i need, make someone feel the pain, feel the anger, blood is the ecstasy, blood is just what i need, make someone feel the pain, feel the anger.
And my thirst for blood.

I Woke up from a terrible dream.
A Dream full of guts, pain and blood.
I didn't left the dream behind
Now i feel the thirst for blood
