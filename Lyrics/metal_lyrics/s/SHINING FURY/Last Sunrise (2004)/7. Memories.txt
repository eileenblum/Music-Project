Forgive my words, sorry
I remember your shining tears

You've hurt my face...doesn't matter
'cause the biggest bleed is in my soul

Oh, i will live with your anger
Oh, i will live with my cry

Standing in my room, I see your eyes
And I hear again, the echo of your voice

Please, kiss my lips, just one more time
Tell me now that It's only a bad dream

Oh, I will live with your anger
God, I will live with my cry
Oh, I will live with the pain into my heart

Oh, I just will live
Into the darkness I'll walk
Lookin' for my love to you

I've lost myself, when I've lost you
And my life is empty without you

Deep in my memories, I will cry for me
'cause the sadness is my only friend

Oh, I will live with my sorrow
God, I will live with my pain
Oh, I will live with the rain into my heart

Oh, I just will live
Into the darkness I'll walk
Lookin' for my love to you

Oh, I just will live
Into the darkness I'll walk
Lookin' for my love to you

Oh, you must know that this song is for you
Only for you, and for me
Oh, I will give you the answer to my lies
Please call my name...
And I'll be there

Oh, I just will live
Into the darkness I'll walk
Lookin' for my love to you

Oh, I just will live
Into the darkness I'll walk
Lookin' for my love to you
