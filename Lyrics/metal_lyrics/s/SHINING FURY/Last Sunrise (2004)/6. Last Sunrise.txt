I shoot up on the blue skies
Where you can't see my wake
You know that I'm not your best friend
'cause my fly is your end

You can't escape from me
I am coming
You can't escape from me

Reachin' my glance to sunrise
I feel the size of world
Now I can twist my airplane
'cause I'll break off your life

You can't escape from me
I am coming
You can't escape from manhunt

I am the lord of this war
'cause I've the justice by my side
I am the judge of your soul
That will sweep up all the things unclean
