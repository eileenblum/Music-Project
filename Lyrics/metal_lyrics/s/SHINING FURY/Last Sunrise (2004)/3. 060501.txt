Lord 'o' mine listen to me
I wanna sell my revenge at you
Take my hands, help me to raise
So I'll can stand up in front of you

All my life is a denial
And you'll the reason of my sighs
Sin 'o' mine spectre of my spite
Spin inside me under the moonlight

Fallin' down in reality
I see the power of your will
Feelin' your touch upon my skin
I'll found a reason for leer at you

All my life is a denial
And you'll the reason of my sighs
Sin 'o' mine spectre of my spite
Spin inside me under the moonlight

Memories of past, get out of my head
Ash of my, pain burst all my brain

Pull off the mud of my troubles,
Get me the strength to survive
I'll feel the cool of this fire
So you'll can feel all my cry

All my life is a denial
And you'll the reason of my sighs
Sin 'o' mine spectre of my spite
Spin inside me under the moonlight

Memories of past, get out of my head
Ash of my, pain burst all my brain

Pull off the mud of my troubles,
Get me the strength to survive
I'll feel the cool of this fire
So you'll can feel all my cry
