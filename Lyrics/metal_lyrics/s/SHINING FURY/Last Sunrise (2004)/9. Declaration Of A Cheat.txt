Hi stranger white,
Tell me now what are you doin' here,
Show me why our sky now is fallin' down

Now our words turn over the hell
'cause your intentions are underhands

You're like a whore
'cause your smile are for all the people
But your cheat will make fat only your end

Now our words turn over the hell
'cause your intentions are underhands

I see the haze in your eyes
In this harsh winter time
In your mind I have seen my home

Now our words turn over the hell
'cause your intentions are underhands
