I don't believe that in this world
I've found a reason to reload my strength and my soul too

I must believe in heaven
I cannot breath to die again
One more time
I don't want to be tired and sad

Crazy time I can't stop the speed of my life
I won't to complete in this race
I raise my arms and I join my hands to the sky, I'll pray

Watchin' in the mirror
I can see my face and all my pain
Deep in my eyes

Lookin' now my shoulders
I can feel the sorrows of my life
Deep in mind

I can't maintain that in this life
I've found a little hope to smile
I've seen the frames of my brain

Now stop to drink, to fallin' down
I will revise forever my compassion and my mistakes

I must believe in heaven
I cannot breath to die again
One more time
I don't want to be tired and sad

Crazy time I can't stop the speed of my life
I won't to complete in this race
I raise my arms and I join my hands to the sky, I'll pray

Watchin' in the mirror
I can see my face and all my pain
Deep in my eyes

Lookin' now my shoulders
I can feel the sorrows of my life
Deep in mind

Crazy time I can't stop the speed of my life
I won't to complete in this race
I raise my arms and I join my hands to the sky, I'll pray

Watchin' in the mirror
I can see my face and all my pain
Deep in my eyes

Lookin' now my shoulders
I can feel the sorrows of my life
Deep in mind
