Today, I will die in a lane, so
Someone will betray me
Fuck you, everyone cry for me?

I'm not a dreamer...

Help, nobody comes to help me
My destiny is lost
Lost, leave me from this black game

Today, I'm shouting for a help
They were threatening me with the lights
The lights, I've seen even my death
Dressed up my sneers

Help, nobody comes to help me
My destiny is lost
Lost, leave me from this black game

Be quiet! not say "It's alright"
Go away! now leave alone

Go away! you are my worst nightmare
Let me go! I don't wanna be your toy
Go away! I feel your dirty sweat
Help me god! what a stupid, he does not exist

Be quiet! not say "It's alright"
Go away! now leave alone

Go away! you are my worst nightmare
Let me go! I don't wanna be your toy
Go away! I feel your dirty sweat
Help me god! what a stupid, he does not exist

Now calm down nothing will go wrong
It's alright, just don't shout
Good yes, no cry, no scream

Be quiet! not say "It's alright"
Go away! now leave alone

Go away! you are my worst nightmare
Let me go! I don't wanna be your toy
Go away! I feel your dirty sweat
Help me god! what a stupid, he's not with me!
