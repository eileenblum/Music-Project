Lookin' for memories I've spent all my life
Searchin' for you I'll been crazy
Now that I've found you, you'll stop doing smile
'cause I'll be starving for your soul

I'll give you only a reason for cry
Just wanna crash only your mind
So you'll ask someone a way to escape
But my revenge in a fearful pain

Run for your life, for survive!
Run for your life!

Oh, shine in this time
Oh, shine 'cause you are mine

Lookin' for memories I've spent all my life
Searchin' for you I'll been crazy
Now that I've found you, you'll stop doing smile
'cause I'll be starving for your soul

I'll give you only a reason for cry
Just wanna crash only your mind
So you'll ask someone a way to escape
But my revenge in a fearful pain

Run for your life, for survive!
Run for your life!

Oh, shine in this time
Oh, shine 'cause you are mine
