Good morning! I am awake now
I see my body in the mirror
In the bedroom that i have put up (on)
My ceiling well, in my home

I feel the heat of the sun's ray
I feel the touch of the silky sheet, now
I need to close my eyes for sleep
One more time, once again

I am awake, I'm inside the night
I'm alone in this long starry night

I feel the squeeze of my sleep
I don't want look my life with my eyes
It's like a sweet symphony
That have blaze up my place in the hell

Sleepin' in the arms of the evil
I see my body in the eye of flames, now
I feel the smell of the devil
In my nose, in my soul

I feel the depth of my coma
I feel the breath of my dirty hangman
I fell the smell of my flesh that burn
In flames of my death

I am awake, I'm inside the night
I'm alone in this long starry night

I feel the squeeze of my sleep
I don't want look my life with my eyes
It's like a sweet symphony
That have blaze up my place in the hell

I cannot move my legs are tired and heavy
My mouth is dry and in a low voice I'll cry

I am awake, I'm inside the night
I'm alone in this long starry night

I feel the squeeze of my sleep
I don't want look my life with my eyes
It's like a sweet symphony
That have blaze up my place in the hell

There's no time farewell
