Sending a mail you can revel with me
Surfin' my net you can talkin' about our lives, so,
Tell me again, what is a real love for you?

I don't know why, my heart burns in fire,
My blazing mind now is darker than night:
Her eyes will be my new light

Watching her smile, can you dream for all time?
Do you think that she could understand why?
I feel that without her face I can go crazy and mad, but,
One question for you, why is this love so unreal

I don't know why, my heart burns in fire,
My blazing mind now is darker than night:
Her eyes will be my new light

Why is this love so unreal?

I don't know why, my heart burns in fire,
My blazing mind now is darker than night:
Her eyes will be my new light

Tell me why, my heart burns in fire,
My shining mind now is darker than night:
Her smile will be my new light
