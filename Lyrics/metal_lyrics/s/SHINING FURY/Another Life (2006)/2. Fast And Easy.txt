Welcome to my night!
Welcome to my easy vices:
Cigarettes, beer, sex; anything else?

Wanna you to start?
Wanna you stir up yourself?
Yes I know...
We can stop even the time!

My car could be all that you can desire:
Wanna you try?

Speed's flame; drive fast! Looking for the end of line.
Drive fast, more fast; looking for the end of a secret denied.

Music, sounds and light;
No! I can't turn off my mind...
I'm the master of this trilling game... yeah

Can you feel the wind?
Can you feel the smell of excited life?
We've no time to think of die!!!
Yeah...

Real life, is that all you can give me;
Play with me, with my dreams! Try to believe...

I can feel the fever screaming in my head!!

Speed's flame; drive fast!
Looking for the end of line.
Drive fast, more fast;
Looking for the end of a secret denied.

Real life, is that all you can give me;
Play with me, with my dreams! Try to believe...

Driving fast I feel the wind that I've needed
Looking back I can see nothing that I've needed
Stay with me... we must to run!!!
