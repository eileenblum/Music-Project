I'm blow away by the sleep
I can't carry on my trip
Also I have much way in front of me "four o' clock"
Is it the hour of the memories
Facing my past I know! I'll be defeat

I see again that tired eyes
They make me trouble!!!
They are inside myself.
Away! I would rush off from this picture... now!
I put back all my pain
Tired by loneliness I cry.

Facing my past, still I've realized
I can't carry on! Away...

I can't believe, I am mad!
This is only my past.
I must watch forward
'Cause I'm not fool.
Answers? No!
I don't need excuse to my mistakes (now)
This story is closed;
More I can't hear my heart.

Five years ago, I know, are many,
I've dedicate my life at you;
I'm castaway in sorrow,
Pain and sorrow
'Cause, I know, that I can't see-you again!
My love... you!!! ...forever.
