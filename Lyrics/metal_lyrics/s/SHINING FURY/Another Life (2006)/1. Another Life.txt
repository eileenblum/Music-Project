Tell me why you are lookin' for fame
If your soul is get out from nowhere
Tell me why you are lookin' for fun now
Your mind is not clear.

You are goin' to deceive your head
But you also can't betray your kin
You cannot cheat forever
Until the end

I'm the choice that you can pick up
But I don't want to force you.
You can believe in tomorrow
You must believe in a good life
You can believe in a woman
Because she can give you a child
Because she can love a long life
Only with you!!

Please.
Try... leave your sorrow far from you one, two again...

Yeah, I got to tell you one thing:
You've breathe only half of the air
But now you can stand up and
Smile one more time
Yeah!

Rise up from your pain, because you are born, born to be free
Climb every highest top, fighting and wanting your way!

Why don't you wanna understand?
Why your head is hardest than diamond?
Why don't you wanna think?
Are you only a looser?

I'm gonna throw away my time
Time that is very precious

Look and stand up, right here, right now
Are you a man?

I'm the amazing choice that you can brave
But I don't wanna face you
You can believe in tomorrow
You must believe in a good life
You can believe in a woman
Because she can give you a child
Because she can love a long life
Only with you!!!

Rise up from your pain, because you are born, born to be free
Climb every highest top, fighting and wanting your way!
