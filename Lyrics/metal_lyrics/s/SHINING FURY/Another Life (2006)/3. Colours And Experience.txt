Forever I'll seek myself
Always I've lost my way
Remember I am a stronger man
That have seen the true face of this stranger death.

I am ready to live
Deep down reality;
I am not fool, still I've realized:
You must bleed to take a new breath
That will speak around the lies;
Come on' can-you listen to me now?

Please leave your trouble behind,
Between the stars of the night
Where the darkness are full of dry tears!
Forget your pain of this world and believe!

Feel the salvation of God,
It's like a great sun that shines;
Come back at home with me:
Smile one more time and survive...

Tell me what do you think?
Why your eyes are so grey?
Just tell me that your soul is still white,
'Cause I wanna save you from this bad, black life!

Please leave your trouble behind,
Between the stars of the night
Where the darkness are full of dry tears!
Forget your pain of this world and believe!

Feel the salvation of God,
It's like a great sun that shines;
Come back at home with me:
Smile one more time and survive...
