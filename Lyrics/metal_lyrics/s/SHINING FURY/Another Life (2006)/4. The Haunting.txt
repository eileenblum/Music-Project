Hey, don't you care? Run away,
Don't you feel my shadow on you?
Try to escape, far from me;
Deep down the bottom of your fear...

Just, bore the ground, smell the air!
Dead or alive for me it's the same...
Breath and bleed. High damage;
Enjoy me like a little white mouse...

Run away take this way without lies,
Here this cold wind 'til the end of your life...
Your time as come! Choose your destiny!
How would you die?

Easy, like a tale; easy maybe slow
Easy, it's the way; easy maybe slow.
