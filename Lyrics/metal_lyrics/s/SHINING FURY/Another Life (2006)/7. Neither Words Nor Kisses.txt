I wanderer in the city
Through dirty and nastiness
Looking for twenty dollars, passing by the night

I wanna take a woman
I wanna touch that she can give to me
I wanna pay this woman, without saying a word

I'm sure of this decision
I like this beautiful world
Tonight I want to try that: can you buy the happiness?
Yeah sure! I wanna smell her
I wanna pump up her tonight!
No love, no word, nor kisses
Pleasure and nastiness for me!!!
Just for me!!!

Take me now without remorse
Spread your mouth and make me enjoy
Twenty minutes then bye bye...
Another face deep in my mind...

Good drugs and seven whisky
Now my brain is going to explodes!
My eyes are spinning quickly
But I would start again!
Yeah sure! I wanna smell her
I wanna pump up her tonight!
No love, no word, nor kisses
Pleasure and nastiness for me!!!
Just for me!!!

Give what you want.
Give what I want...
