Try, you know... It's really right
Fine: now can you feel the flavour of the blood?

[Devil:]
Take the knife with your left hand
Lookin' for the courage to rape-off one more life!

The hell's flame burns deep down in your eyes

[Devil:]
Far from you get the chains of love!

[Angel:]
Stop! You can't destroy him!
Now leave the evil;
You must resist!

[Angel:]
You are the lord of your life...

[Devil:]
Forgot the goodness of your kind!

[Angel:]
Respect your heart and believe every night...

[Devil:]
Come on with me!

Get out!
You're only tiresome
And you...
Kill now this man!
And take! That's your glory!
