Smilin' I've seen your greatest dream
Tonight I can be like a fire
Still I can kiss your lips with my black soul
To feel your life deep down my heart

Takin' your hands into my hands
I can look for my salvation
Tell me yes! Please do you feel the heart bit o' mine
For you, I can make now a new

World, light, stay together
With you, now, I can fly

I've said please but you don't understand
I've said please, but you are go away
Tonight I'll cry
Tonight I'll can only die here
'Cause my life is full of shit

Give me sorrow - take my blood away

Give me sorrow - take my blood away

I run away because I'm searchin'
For a new place where I'll can die
I don't wanna get out my heart down on fire
I must see again your smile!!!
