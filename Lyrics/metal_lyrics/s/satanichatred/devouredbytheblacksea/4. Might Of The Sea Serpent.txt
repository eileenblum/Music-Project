The moon is drowning
In a starless black night
Restless, ominously shining bright
The sea below an empty dark sky
Hear the whispers of the depths

Jormungandr! Hydra! Leviathan! Tiamat!

Dark goddess of the oceans and seas
Born in the primordial creation
Inner chaos, hate, she screams
From fading dreams of immortality

Wriggling serpent awakes and rises
Screaming endless blasphemies
With her eyes burning hateful red
Might of the sea serpent

And the dark blue painted waves
She orchestrates in scornful ways
Heading off to shores and all that's land
Soon to fill with poison and turn to sand

So hide in your petty houses
Inside your cities so bleak
For an unknown evil shall rise
From the depths of the sea
And devour all life
