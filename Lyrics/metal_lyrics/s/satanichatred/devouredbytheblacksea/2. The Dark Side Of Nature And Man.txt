Shadows lurking deep below
Beneath the water oh so cold
A glimpse of madness
The dirge of my dying mind

The darkness I follow
The wind telling me the way
With morbid whispers comes madness
Am I really insane?

Does death bring suffering
Or does it bring peace
I must not fall asleep
Or it will come to me

I escaped the flesh prison
I can no longer die
For I am not what I was
I'm but an eternal lie

I am the guardian
We open the gate
Embrace the dark side
Of nature and man
A mind truly insane

It is that, that never really was
It is something that should never be
It is inside
And it can never die
