Countless sleepless nights I've spent
Seeking the nocturnal writings lost
To find the knowledge of the ancient ones
The curse of thousand drowned souls
Left screaming for eternity
At the bottom of the black sea

To forge my path in arcane beauty
So wisdom guides me through this mortal plane
Lost in the endless black abyss
A human made from dust and wind

Serpent arises from the waves
Revealing the blasphemous essence
Of this dream we call reality
Showing us (the) way to eternity

The secrets of creation
Darkest spells of the abyss
A corruption that stirs deep within
Drowned in black waters
You shall never swim

Voices of the night
Reveal secrets of the sea
Centuries of wisdom
Locked beneath the silence
Lie the creatures you can't see
