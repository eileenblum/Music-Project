You feel its presence
Heed the call

Let the sea drown you
Touch its black heart
Let the waves wash you
The water clearing your mind

Heed the call
Let the sea take you

To her still beating heart
Buried deep beneath the lifeless sand
Lies the melancholy, sadness
And the wisdom of this land

Heed the call
Your celestial throne is waiting

Drown yourself in the midnight stars
The night slowly devouring you
Eternity enchanted in your eyes
Fading into quiet dark oblivion

Heed the call
Let the purification begin

Wash away the lies
And end our lives
To a new beginning
To all that is us
And to all there'll ever be

Drown

Heed the call of the deep
