in unremembered dreams tonight
the reflecting silver light
on the waters oh so cold and calm
drink the lake of tears in which you drown

open the gates to eternity in silence
to vast dimensions where aeons are a second
this abandoned cold throne of needles
your forever last terrestrial home

but even when destroyed
your soul will be forever bound
by the dark and evil spirits
created by your own fears

so slit your throat and cut your wrists
carve my name deep into your skin
paint me with your blood
and kiss me with your pale lips
before you drift away
