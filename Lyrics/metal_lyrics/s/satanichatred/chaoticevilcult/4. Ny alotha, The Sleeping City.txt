where there's only sleep
the drowned god awaits
calling forth my name
slowly draining my sanity

lone silence in the caves of old
as I travel through the dark and cold
feeding on the spirit of grotesque shrines 
in the deserted city of the dead

deep underwater I swim
through ruins old as time
I shiver in this freezing cold
now heavy fog surrounds me

depths with nightmares all around me
faceless yelling, screaming my name
but his voice I follow in this endless night
the unsleeping one expects me

where only mad things walk
I lay dreaming endless nightmares
sleeping as I fall into madness
in ny'alotha the sleeping city
