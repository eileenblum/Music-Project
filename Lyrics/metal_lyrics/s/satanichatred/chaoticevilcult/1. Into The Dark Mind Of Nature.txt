follow the darkness
the creeping all consuming shadow

follow the rivers
frozen from our fears cold

enter the dark mind of nature

follow the winds' whispers
shadowy voices speaking of eternal sleep

follow the depths
the darkness lurking down below

enter the dark mind of nature

Into the dark mind of nature
the grandeur of yet another dying sun
