I may be young, but I've got nerve
Nerve enough to say the things that need be heard
I want to save the world
One soul at a time
And I won't stop at the drop of a dime
I won't stop

Soil your carpet, and the carpet you'll clean
As she reaps her sweet revenge upon our scene
Mother nature is handing 'em out
She's ringing hell's bells, bells?! Ah, hell
She's waited on us for so long and now she's happening

Open your eyes, reset the standard
Hold high yourself above the filth
Cause karma's coming around

The end is near, and in clear view
And will be until we change the things we do
We need to work for love, and join in hands
And defend what we hold so grand
I've got a list of demands
And I will see them through

Soil your carpet, and the carpet you'll clean
As she reaps her sweet revenge upon our scene
Mother nature is handing 'em out
She's ringing hell's bells, bells?! Ah hell
She's waited on us for so long and now she's happening

Open your eyes, reset the standard
Hold high yourself above the filth
Breathe in new life, sheep seek your shepherd
Govern this grace we've all been dealt
Cause karma's coming around

And we're all just parasites
And the earth gives back in spite
Of all the hurt that we bring her
You'd think we'd treat her better if we actually knew her
Yea we're all just parasites
We're all just parasites

The kink in the design
Was perfect in design
The parasite

Yea, I'm awaiting the coming of new age
As I sift through the sands of the times
(Sift back to the day when the bells first chimed)
And yea I'm being broken of the "thought to be so"
Life's the reason, we're the rhythm, I'm the rhyme
And the voice of the times
And I will

Open your eyes, reset the standard
Hold high yourself above the filth
Breathe in new life, sheep seek your shepherd
Govern this grace we've all been dealt
Cause karma's coming around!

And we're all just parasites
(We're all just parasites)
Yea, we're all just parasites
We're all just parasites
We're all just parasites
We're all just parasites
