There's something in the way you held your head
And the light silhouetting the sight
Something's gotta give in this image
For the beauty's ensuring soar eyes and
No one ever knows who will
No one ever knows who won't
No one ever knows who will and who won't

We're practicing the art of wasting away
In the brace of each others arms
Under the sun, my lover and me
What a picture in my wallet this would be
It's all that I need

There's something in the air in which you stand
And the aroma that passes in the wind
Something's gotta give in this image
For the beauty's ensuring my end and
No one ever knows, but i've been dying to tell you
No one ever knows, it keeps me dying to tell you
No one ever knows who will and who won't

We're practicing the art of wasting away
In the brace of each others arms
Under the sun, my lover and me
What a picture in my wallet this would be
It's all that I need
It's all that I need
It's all that I need

She's all that I need
She's all that I need
She's all that I need
You're all that I need
You're all that I need

We're practicing the art of wasting away
In the brace of each others arms
Je suis, my lover and me
What a picture in my wallet this would be

We're practicing the art of wasting away
In the brace of each others arms
Under the sun, my lover and me
What a picture in my wallet this would be
It's all that I need
It's all that I need
It's all that I need
