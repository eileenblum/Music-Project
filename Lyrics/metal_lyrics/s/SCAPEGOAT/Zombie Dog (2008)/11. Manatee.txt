In a perfect world
All people would agree
That given the circumstance we better start to believe
We all are just running
From something we'd never foresee
The ending of humanity, yea

In a perfect world
All people would agree
That given the circumstance
We better get the fuck on our feet
Because we all are just running from something
Something we could never foresee
The ending of humanity
We'll be swimming with the manatee

Our faiths have torn this world apart
We've been misguided, misdirected, misinformed by those elected
And now it's time to take a stand abroad
Praise Jesus, praise Buddha, praise Allah, praise God

Well I'm making amends with myself
To better discern myself
For the better of my own health
I'm learning to love myself
While digging up the dirt I've been dealt

Cause we all are just running from something,
Something we could never foresee
The ending of humanity
We'll be swimming with the manatee

Black or white
Yellow, red
We're the same
It's time to dust off them water wings

Black or white
Yellow, red
We're the same
It's time to dust off them water wings

Well I'm making amends with myself
To be discern myself
I'm making amends with with myself
For the better of my own health

Well I'm making amends with myself
I'm making amends with myself
I'm making amends with myself
I'm making amends with myself

for the better of everyone's health
(I will face myself)
It's best we amend with ourselves

In a perfect world all people would agree
That given the circumstance we better begin to believe
Cause we all are just running from something
Something we'd never foresee
The ending of humanity
(Where you gonna run?
What you gonna do?
Where you gonna turn?
When are we gonna learn?)
We'll be swimming with the manatee
In a perfect world we'll be
(Where you gonna run?
What you gonna do?
Where you gonna turn?
When are we gonna learn?
You better begin to believe it baby)
In a perfect world we'll be
In a perfect world we'll be
You and me in eternity
