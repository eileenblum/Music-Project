And oh what a day it was
Sun shining, blinding through the trees
Enough to bring my ego to it's knees

Then along she came
Through the sun and the rain
Through the thick of the fog
Through my fear and my pain
She was a true messenger from God
She was, showing me a sign
Wanting me to keep hope alive she said

'Plant a seed
Watch the magic ensue
Let it blossom be it loved
By something higher above
Let it be known to others that it's yours and your own
As you bathe in the light of the glory that's bestown'

And let the rest roll off with the rest of the run off
Just let the rest roll off with the rest of the run off
Just let the rest roll off with the rest of the run off
Just let the rest roll off with the rest of the run off, she said

And oh was it a dream or not
It hasn't as of yet lost its buzz
Never the less it was what it was

And I know that she came
Through the sun and the rain
Through the thick of the fog
Through my fear and my pain
She was a true messenger from God
She was, showing me a sign
Wanting me to keep hope alive
And so I fight
The fucking whore of the earth
Trying to drag me down, down, down
The devil's playground

'Plant a seed
Watch the magic ensue
Let it blossom be it loved
By something higher above
Let it be known to others that it's yours and your own
As you bathe in the light of the glory that's bestown'

And let the rest roll off with the rest of the run off
(I'm bathing in your light)
Just let the rest roll off with the rest of the run off
Just let the rest roll off with the rest of the run off
(I'm bathing in your light)
Just let the rest roll off with the rest of the run off

In the back of my mind
I let it unwind

God please give me a sign
Adonai be the skip within my stride
For when the whole world sees black and white
Adonai, I see your light

I see your light
I see your light

So through the dark I fight

Oh God
I'm going out of my brain
This world is fucked or I'm fucking insane
Am I insane?!

The fucking whore of the earth
Trying to drag me down, down, down
(The devil's playground)

'Plant a seed
Watch the magic ensue
Let it blossom be it loved
By something higher above
Let it be known to others that it's yours and your own
As you bathe in the light of the glory that's bestown'

And let the rest roll off with the rest of the run off
(I'm bathing in your light)
Just let the rest roll off with the rest of the run off
Just let the rest roll off with the rest of the run off
(I'm bathing in your light)
Just let the rest roll off with the rest of the run off, she said

She said
She said
