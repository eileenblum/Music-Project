Well never fear my dear
Stay right here
Close to me
Veer yourself away from the windows

I've got my shotgun,
Bring on the dead ones
And my wrath will soon ensue
They were never meant to walk
Will we make it out alive?
God, give me the strength and the nerve
To pop a zombie's head like a zombie deserves

Well the whole world turned upside down
When the zombies rose forth from the ground
Now the whole world continues round
With the zombies

So glow, glow, glow
In the shower of shameless pride
Cleanse as he would have cleansed
God give me the strength and the nerve
To pop a zombie's head like a zombie deserves

I've got my shotgun, and she goes boom
God give me the strength and the nerve
To pop a zombie's head like a zombie deserves

Well the whole world turned upside down
When the zombies rose forth from the ground
Now the whole world continues round
With the zombies

So glow, glow, glowing the shower of shameless pride
Cleanse as he would have cleansed
God give me the strength and the nerve
To pop a zombie's head like a zombie deserves

I've got my shotgun, and she goes boom
Boom

Well the whole world turned upside down
When the zombies rose forth from the ground
Now the whole world continues round
With the zombies

Well they rose forth from the ground
And they turned this whole world upside down
And now thy wrath be spread abound
With the zombies

Well the whole world turned upside down
Yea the whole world turned upside down
Now the whole world is upside down
In a brand new way
