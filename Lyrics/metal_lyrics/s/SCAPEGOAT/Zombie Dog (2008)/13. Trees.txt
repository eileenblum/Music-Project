Well so long's been the day since I braced a tree
Since I, tried to conquer something bigger than me
For I thought
That I could never go back
Yet here I stand in the midst of them
Learning what it means to be a child again
And I know
It's not too late to go back

And won't that be the day?
When we molecularly meltdown the walls we once held raised
And suddenly, suddenly we're climbing trees
Limber are our members like the children that we use to be
When you say play
When you say play

Well my joints don't hurt when they normally would
And my knees are doing things that I never thought that they could
They're going back in time
Empowered by the memories, of me as a youngin running through the trees
And i know, it's not too late to go back
Cause I'm back now

And wont that be the day?
When we atomically breakdown the walls we once held raised
And suddenly, suddenly we're climbing trees
Limber are our members like the children that we use to be
When you say play
When you say play
It's time for us to play, oh
It's time for us to play

Well times are dire and I think it's time we found a way
To bring our inner children back from where they've gone astray
For life is short and sure to expire
It's time we spread love instead of spreading the fire
Yea times are dire, I'll say it again
To truly change the world, we need to change the way we're living
For life is short and I think it's time we found a way
To kick our shoes off and play

And wont that be the day?
When we molecularly meltdown the walls we once held raised
(Walls we once held raised)
And suddenly, suddenly we're climbing trees
Limber are our members like the children that we use to be
When you say play
When you say play

Well I'll be everything that you want me to be
(Well I'm a child in your eyes)
And I'll give my life to humanity
(I am always in your eyes)
I'll make my way to the top of the tallest of trees
Spreadin seeds, spreadin seeds, spreadin seeds, spreadin seeds

So make me only in to what you want me to be
And I will spread the truth from the top of the tallest tree
When you say play
When you say play
When you say play
