These days are deranged
We're zombies to the system
Like monkeys in a cage
Cause these days when all we are, are rats in a maze
I'm sick of just a cookie, I want some fucking cake

And I said 'Hey! What a thought?!'
I know it might sound crazy but I think the magic in this world is away
No doubt I'm claiming that the magic in this world is stolen away with age
And I know it to be due in part to society

I'm finding it criminal that the magic in this world
Has long been jarred up in a bag
And stolen away with age
Just a little bit criminal
As the thief is disguised through the money and the lies til we find
We're being stolen away with age

(We're stolen away)
(We're stolen away)
We're stolen away
When black and white replaces grey
(We're stolen away)
And the child within is lead astray

And I said 'Hey! what a thought?!'
I know it might sound crazy but I think the magic in this world is away
(No doubt I'm claiming that the magic has long been chained)
No doubt I'm claiming that the magic in this world is stolen away with age
And I know it to be due in part to society

I'm finding it criminal that the magic in this world
Has long been jarred up in a bag
And stolen away with age
Just a little bit criminal
As the thief is disguised through the money and the lies til we find
We're being stolen away

We're stolen away
We're stolen away

We're stolen away
We're stolen away
We're stolen away
We're stolen away

And I said 'Hey! what a thought?!'
'Hey! what a thought?!'
I know it might sound crazy
'Hey! what a thought?!'
We're stolen away with age
And I know it to be due in part to society

I'm finding it criminal that the magic in this world
Has long been jarred up in a bag
And stolen away with age
Just a little bit criminal
As the thief is disguised through the money and the lies till we find
We're being stolen away
