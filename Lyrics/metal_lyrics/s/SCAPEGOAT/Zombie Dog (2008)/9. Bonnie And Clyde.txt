Our story starts with a boy
Who finds himself in a girl
Outdone, outgunned, on the run without a care in the world
See they had justification
In believing freedom is free

Or so they thought
I guess they must have been mistaken
When they figured freedom couldn't be bought

I think I'm at it again
Cause it feels like
It seems like everyone's eyes are burning a hole in my confidence
And paranoia's at an all time high, as my chest gets tight
FYI, in the midst of a panic attack it's harder to breathe

So from what were they running
And to whom was there crime
You can call it as it lies, for the truth will be disguised over time
Some may say it was nothing, some may say they were strange

Or so they thought
I guess they must have been mistaken
When they figured freedom couldn't be bought

I think I'm at it again
Cause it feels like
It seems like everyone's eyes are burning a hole in my confidence
And paranoia's at an all time high, as my chest gets tight
FYI, in the midst of a panic attack it's harder to breathe

Oh yea it's harder to breathe
It's harder to breathe

I'll cross your T's if you dot my I's
I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine back until the day that we die
We made a pact that they wont take us alive so let's die
Die like Bonnie and Clyde

So throw me a bone
I would die for the world if the world would have it so

They'll probably knock us off
They'd never let us go
So when you find me dead
With a bullet in my head and a note
Be it known I wasn't alone

I think I'm at it again
Cause it feels like
It seems like everyone's eyes are burning a hole in my confidence
And paranoia's at an all time high, as my chest gets tight
FYI, in the midst of a panic attack it's harder to breathe

I'll cross your T's if you dot my I's
I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine back until the day that we die
We made a pact that they wont take us alive so let's die, oh die
Die like Bonnie and Clyde
