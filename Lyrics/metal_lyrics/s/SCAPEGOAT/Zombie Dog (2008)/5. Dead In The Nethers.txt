Slowly, suddenly
I'm slowly slipping through the cracks of life
(He said what?)
I'm slowly slipping through the cracks of life
(He said what?)
I'm fucking dying in the cracks of life!
(You're fucking joking right?)

The system
It fucks you
Don't believe what the media tells you
And it's always the same in the morning

Slowly, suddenly
I'm slowly slipping through the cracks of life
(He said what?)
I'm slowly slipping through the cracks of life
(He said what?)
I'm fucking dying in the cracks of life!
(You're fucking joking right?)

The system
It fucks you
Disregard what the television tells you
Population control in the morning

Well I'll right my wrongs
With a new kind of song
Never forgetting what I have
A pen and a pad, a pen and a pad is all that I have
And I'll write my words,
With the tone of the absurd
Never forgetting what i have
A pen and a pad, a pen and a pad these weapons I have

What you choose to move
Or be let moved
Will be the tune we play to you

Well I'm a servant of God
I'm on a mission and I will not be stopped
I'm moving in full swing, not knowing where I'm going
Questioning everything
I have

These weapons i have
These weapons i have
These weapons i have

A dark path through which the future is left unsure
I'm at war

Slowly, suddenly
(He said what?)
Slowly, suddenly
(He said what?)
I'm fucking dying in it slowly
(He said what?)
I'm in the cracks of life
(You're fucking joking right?)
