Our story's been shelved away
And I'm locked inside
Between the depths of page
I now age

But as the river bends bending til it's destined end
This is what he said
And if we never speak again
I will pretend
Cause I've got the imaginative
Along with the creative
Said along with the creative

(I toss and turn)
And I cannot get you out of my dreams
(You fill my mind)
Despite my every try
(Is this for real?)
I'm lost within the seams
(So wrong, so right)
Of a lie

But as the river bends bending till it's destined end
We can only bend so far before we break
And when the waves refuse to break
Then the ground will surely shake
And quake, that it did on that day

And if we never speak again
I will pretend
Cause I've got the imaginative
Along with the creative
Said along with the creative

Along with the creative
Alone with my creative
I'm stepping back to redefine what I'm created for
What I'm created for

For all the things we have lost
(I'm stepping back to redefine what I'm created for)
It seems that nothing worth having comes without it's cost
(I'm living life through the eyes of a creator)
And I'm coming to find
(I'm stepping back to redefine what I'm created for)
The power of my mind
A conscious state of mind

And if we never speak again
I will pretend
(Whatever I want, we're all one in the end)
Cause I've got the imaginative
Along with the creative
Said along with the creative

And so it comes to be
I've created a world in which you're right here next to me
Where all things, all thought transcends reality
I've created a world to which the world will never see
