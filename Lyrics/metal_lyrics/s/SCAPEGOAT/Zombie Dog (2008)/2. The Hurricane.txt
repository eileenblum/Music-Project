Stride forth as you would in last days
It's time to wake up, get up and get out
Or get the fuck out my way
Yea I'm hell bent on a mission
I'm steadfast for a cure
I aim to shake the beasts foundation
To it's very core
I'm coming for ya, that whore
To make a change

Question authority
Question the government
Question all you assume to be true
We made our money off the towers we tombed
We made our money off our land on the moon
Question the government
I want some fucking proof
I want the God damn truth
Was there ever a man on the moon?

Come on baby tell me come on

Hey you down below
You may not have a stage but you have stone
So let us be your rock, to rock and roll
And dance the way you do
Dance the way you do

Change your ways
Question authority
Question the government
Become a staple for your peers through the end of days
Question all you assume to be true
Cause these days they send you to the gallows for questioning
(We made our money off the towers we tombed)
(We made our money off our land on the moon)
(Question the government)
I want some fucking proof
I want the God damn truth
Was there ever a man on the moon?

R.!
F.!
I.!
D.!
Chips in every single person that you see
Overtaxed, overworked, underpaid
Now we're tagged with a radio frequency
It's time to wake up and smell the shit
(We're not that far off)
We're neck deep in it

Let us be your rock, to rock and roll
And dance the way you do
Dance the way you do

Their lies were formed to slowly eat at you
The bugs under my skin are on the creeping again
Join in hands or let us remain
An accomplice in the shadows of our government's gain

Change your ways
Question authority
Question the government
Become a staple for your peers through the end of days
Question all you assume to be true
Cause these days they send you to the gallows for questioning
(We made our money off the towers we tombed)
(We made our money off our land on the moon)
(Question the government)
I want some fucking proof
I want the God damn truth
Was there ever a man on the moon?

Was there ever a man on the moon?
Was there ever a man on the moon?
