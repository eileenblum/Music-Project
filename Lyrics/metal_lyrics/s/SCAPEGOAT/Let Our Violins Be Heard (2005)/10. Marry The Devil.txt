Wise men say
Be careful what you wish for
The truth would surely shame
The branding of your name

Stranger unknown
In the back of a Cadillac
Heâs dressed in black
From his toes to his head
Prospective collusion apparent
In the words that he said
She said
Sign your soul to me
And I will set you free

Carry on given weight through the hopeless times
They come a dime of a dozen
In cornucopias of many kinds

But it's all right
Iâm gonna take this money
Turn it around times ten
And start a brand new life with you

You say you wanna get married
I donât buy it
How could an angel marry the devil?
I won't buy it
No I won't buy it

Their came a time
When the constants became unstable
Then came a rise were the questions of many sorts
What do I do?
What is my next move to get back to you?
To get back to the heaven that I once knew
She will be the only heaven you will ever see
Because you signed your soul to me
Is your love for this girl really worth all eternity?

You say you wanna get married
I donât buy it
How could an angel marry the devil?
I wonât buy it
No I wonât buy it

Hear the growl
In the lowest of rumble
Scream the tremors of past wished
Shouldâve never wished this
Iâll take my cues from the wise in the next life

So do you wanna get married?
I donât buy it
How could an angel marry the devil?
I wonât buy it..
