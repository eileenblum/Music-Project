Weâve got our fingers crossed
Weâve got his very best friends in on the job
We the people are the people
And as people we will have our way
Weâre doing away with this sharp
Unorthodox
Ir-rhythm
Damning our streams

Give me this way out
Cause Iâm being run over
By an eighteen wheeler with sorry
Written on the side
My life inside a broken straw

Let go of the railing
Give up, give up, come down

Please give me this way out
Cause my cup has long runneth over
And a flat line reading would
Surely do me right
My life inside a broken straw

And beneath me
Is the water Iâll never reach
A cleansing not known to me
Well I stand up to breathe
My legs cripple, knees give in
And I cave in..
Iâm caving in

I never wanted to be nothing more than unhappy
Iâll wear this stereotype like a crown
And inherit the world as a king
Fucking rock star

Let go of the railing
Preferably before your last words
Your last breath
The subjects dropped and Iâm killing you
Se la vie
We soon will see
Your bed in hell will reek of me
With your tail between your legs

Kill me
Kill me and see what Iâm made of
Crucify me and make me a king
Let the killing begin
Cause nobody ever wants to die
In vein
Give me a reason to be remembered
Your alter is fading
As will you

You are my reason to be remembered
Crucify me
Make me a king

I never wanted to be nothing more than unhappy
And now Iâm the spokes jack ass
Iâll wear this stereotype like a crown
And inherit the world as a king
Fucking rock star

Let go of the railing
Preferably before your last words
Your last breath
The subjects dropped and Iâm killing you
Se la vie, we soon will see
Your bed in hell will reek of me
With your tail between your legs
Kill me
