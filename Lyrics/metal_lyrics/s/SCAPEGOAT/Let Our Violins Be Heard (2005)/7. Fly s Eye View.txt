Solace in the shape of a night
A night which dines upon iridescent light
A flyâs eye view will do me fine
To sort the matter

I couldnât creep around her climb
A fishhook tongue at feeding time
I felt the way it feels
For her to hook your collar

Its high school
Sheâs curious
Youâre grounded
I let you live her lie
This gift which I have given you
Would be no gift if I had chose to fight the lie

It's high school
She's curious
You're grounded

The love you have the body you embrace
Would be no gift if I had chose to fight the lie..

Sheâs coming through
Picture perfect

This gift which I have given you
She who you hold to highest heights
Would be no gift if I had chose to fight the lie
