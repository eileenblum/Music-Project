Sore
Sore cunt from a career of self-serve
What the hell have you done to yourself?
What the fuck have you done to everyone else?
Face the jury

Buoyantly
Vividly
Rendering every pocket blistering
Youâve found a way to displace the shame
To misplace the same weight
Gift wrapped in disease

Shotgun in a muzzle
Shotgun silenced..
Sealed in a graphic
Sealed in silence

Pivotal as choice is
In your hands
Have you not any shame?
How could you blame the world?
How could you place any fault?
Reflective surfaces show
Who holds responsibility for it all

Iâll never accept who you are
Monster's not word enough
What you are
Words canât say
Alive and well to my dismay
Dismay brought from a conveyor of self-serve

Look what Youâve done to yourself
Fuck you and what Youâve done to yourself
Have you not any shame?
How could you blame the world?
How could you place any fault?
Reflective surfaces show
Who holds responsibility for it all

Iâll never accept who you are
Monster's not word enough
Never accept who you are
What you are
Words canât say
Alive and well to my dismay
What you are
I canât say
What you need?
Iâll shove a splintering stake up your cunt

We've all made mistakes
With room for more mistakes to make..

No I will never be a monster..

Iâll never accept who you are
Monsters not word enough
What you are
Monsters not word enough..
