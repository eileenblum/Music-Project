Walk and roll with the punches
Iâll keep on walking

The future awaits my reply
Move forward or turn my back
On the healing hand of time
I feel fine, same sick back again and Iâm fine
Our hearts will mend in time
Our hearts remain entwined
By the healing hand of time
By the healing hand of time

Legs tire the first thoughts that enter myself
Are of the stress that I felt
I hadn't had my fix
And her parents had a wearing on me
So I stalled my walking
Bitching and moaning
Wasting the time of a life
Walking hand in hand with my beautiful future wife

Reflect and reframe
Day from night

Youâre hiding Iâm seeking
Erroneously screaming olly olly oxon free
If you'd have it be
Iâd walk my life away
In the streets of downtown Washington D.C.

I'll keep on walking
Walk and roll with the punches

Museums, high ceilings &amp; the brightest of lights
Breath short
Rising panic as the room contorts
Into the jaws of a lion of an anxious sort
Stalling my walking
Bitching and moaning
Wasting the time of my life
Delving in the interest of my beautiful future wife

Well here's your breath of air
Hereâs your dying cure
Hereâs your sign of hope (all hope is gone)
This song's my cure

(Behind the blindfold)
Youâre hiding Iâm seeking
Erroneously screaming olly olly oxon free
If you'd have it be
Iâd walk my life away
In the streets of downtown Washington D.C.
Just so you could see
A newer me
And what this boy has grown up to be

Time spent remembering
Every time Iâm face to face with it
I wish I couldn't remember
I wish I couldn't remember the wonderful times
Same sick bounce back again and Iâm
Same sick bounce back again and I'm fine

From the trees of Athens
To the capital you call your home
I will be there to guide you
Beside you
Our ever-loving spirits divide to new wholes

(Behind the blind fold)
Youâre hiding Iâm seeking
Erroneously screaming, singing for you, olly olly oxon free
If you'd have it be
Iâd walk my life away in the streets of downtown Washington D.C.
Just so you could see
A newer me
And what this boy has grown up to be

If it's love we can make it work..
If it's love
Let it work
