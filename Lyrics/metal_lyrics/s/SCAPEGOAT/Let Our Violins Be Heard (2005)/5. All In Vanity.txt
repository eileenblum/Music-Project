When being cautious
With the process
We devote what we can
While we try to withstand the simple at hand
We leave our selves open
Through voluntarily going to the depths of the deepest and the darkest of oceans
Just to say we left our mark in the conquest
Its fucked

But Iâve long since left the camp
And I often wish ill again
It seems that life has got me by the heels again
Just to drop me on my ass
Impeaching all dependency
In a quiet place between substance and loss
I threw away our love in a coin toss
And all of this time it seems
We were just falling apart, apart
While I grew into a part of you

So many things that I wanted to see
That I strived to be
In time you couldnât spend with me
I walked around like I was running it all
I ran it all so carelessly
Iâll give you something in return for nothing
My love is built
Unconditionally

Well I still I wanna be something
I still wanna be something
I still wanna be something for nothing more

Negating human nature
In a quiet place between triumph and loss
I threw away our love in a coin toss
Bring the years and inform the clergy
I made it this far without you
And all of this time it seems
We were just falling apart, apart
Well I grew into a part of you..

Bring the years and inform the clergy
I made it this far without you
And all of this time it seems
We were just falling apart, apart
Well I grew into a part of you

In your head when you sleep with him
In your head when you sleep with him
Iâll be in your bed when you sleep with him
In your fucking bed
