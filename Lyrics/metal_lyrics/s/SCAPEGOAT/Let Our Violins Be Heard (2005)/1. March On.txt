The country is FUCKED
Weâve got a maniac running the lines
Writing the headlines
Keeping the fire burning
Incessantly fanning the flames
Flames of fear, the end of the world is near
Lets try and tax their tips
The average waiter of $2.13
Our supply has fallen short of demand
And we need more bullets for M16s
To shred through the dead weight
Their lives expense we could not anticipate
And I hope this weighs on your shoulders
Cuz my back breaks
With every innocent life they take

What have we now but a 747 of loads
And the president counting down as these nations explode
5,4,3,2,1
Standby for the war of our worlds has begun

March
March on
Storm the gates of this abomiment
And free the liar of his cause
March (what do we do?)
March on (to the sound of a drum)
Let freedom ring from desert to mountain top
And the sound of the ring I will degrade with every word that I sing

Iâll piss upon with every word that I sing
Shredding through deadweight
For in their sleep they cannot anticipate
My words heavy as boulders
As they roll off my tongue to your ear, am I hurting your shoulders?

5,4
Enough with the numbers, fuck it
Iâm ready for war

March (what do we do?)
March on (to the sound of a drum)
Storm the gates of this abomiment
And free the liar of his cause
March (what do we do?)
March on (to the sound of a drum)
Let freedom ring from desert to mountain top
And the sound of the ring I will degrade with every word that I sing

And three cheers for the cause
Saddle up cause Iâm ready for war
Saddle up cause Iâm ready for war
Pray that the power of God eludes you
Or let the power consume you
And burn with every last cent that youâve earned
The money youâve made off the lives that you put in the grave

We're all pawns in the game
March
March On..
And the cavalry's ready
