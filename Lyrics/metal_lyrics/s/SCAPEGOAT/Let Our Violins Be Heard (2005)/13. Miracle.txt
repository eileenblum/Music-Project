When a song
A song can touch a nation
Doesnât that say something?
Isnât that a miracle?

When a mother
Can womb a child
Doesnât that say something?
Isnât that a miracle?

Doesnât that say something?
Do I hear a miracle
Chiming in our ears?
Please discuss
The commune

And the loving from a woman
Does that not have merit?
Can that not be credible?
Credible as fathers
Dying for their sons
Sons dying for their fathers
Doesnât that scream something at all?
Doesn't that scream something at all?

This love is a ride
Weâve tied ourselves down
For the time of our lives
Biding our time to die
If you missed me youâd write me
Loved me youâd call
Gave a fuck at all
Youâd be there
Wouldnât that be something?
That would be a miracle
As honest as you were with you and I

I canât wish this away
As honest as you were
I canât wish this away
Who are you?

Coexistent we are
To coexist I need you
Who are you?
Coexistent we are
Coexistent we are
If youâre the sun
Iâm the moon
For without you
I hold no light to keep ground visible in night
Iâve come the darkest of moons
Iâve come the newest of moons
And Iâll wait for you to shine again
Iâm dying for your shine

If you missed me youâd write me
Loved me youâd call
Gave a fuck at all
Youâd be there
Wouldnât that be something?
That would be a miracle
As honest as you were with you and I

And I swear this songâs not negative
For these years have only grown into my open gaping love for you
And these words would never lie
As honest as you were with you and I
As honest as you were with you and I

If you missed me you'd write me
Loved me you'd call
Gave a fuck at all
You'd be there
Wouldn't that be something?
That would be a miracle
