Increasing volume calls for decrease in gain
He said
Ports screaming

A never knowing coming turning event
Cyclical as the life Iâve spent
A life spent in thought of the time that has passed
The time that has passed leaves me bathing in regret of the past
And Iâve paid
My penance

Life in the hair of instabilities main he stood
A bitter dead

You mother fuckers wanna hate on your makers
Youâve ripped your roots right out of the ground
Youâve walked around too long just to piss on my lawn
We are an army
Hitting your car head on

Well Iâm drawing the line
Heâs drawing the line
Fuck drawing the line

For no longer
Will our waivers
Be washed away

Slow as our wind might blow
We row
This boat has turned into a ghost ship
And my corpse is rotting, rotting, rotting, rotting, rotting away
Sheâs rotting away
Rotting, rotting, rotting, rotting, rotting away

She's rotting away

Stomach what you are not
Breathe with the difference of earth
Believe in a mind like mine
Stomach continual pills
Swallow me
Stomach me
Savor me
Continual pills

Reflect on pity (poison, what's poison?)
Learn its true means (know poison)
Choke on my dick in the thick of a gun click
Iâm rotting away

Slow as our wind might blow we row
This boat has turned into a ghost ship
And my corpse is rotting, rotting, rotting, rotting, rotting away
Sheâs rotting away
Rotting, rotting, rotting, rotting, rotting away

Rivers will flow to the appropriate homes
Nails will find the appropriate wrists
Rivers will flow
Rivers will flow
Rivers will flow from my wrists like wine
