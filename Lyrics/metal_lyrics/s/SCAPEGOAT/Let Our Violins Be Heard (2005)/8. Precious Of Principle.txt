Iâm here to tell you
That I want you to know
That left in your wake
This is the boat I now row
A boat that was built on the most precious of principle
As trite as Iâm true
In all that I do
I row forward for you..

As I have my fault
So have you yours
Your affection found sanction at
Inconsistencies door
And through blaming myself
Iâve found Iâm worth so much more
A kingdom less throne unto my own
I row forward alone
For you

As trite as Iâm true
I never thought that re-remembering me
Would mean remembering you
Iâm tragically left concave
From a love that could be a best seller
From a love that could be one of the best

A chromatic indulgence
An atomic release
A peace, a voice to further
The chrysalis inside
The love I have inside
But Iâve seen her face behind
Every wall we climbed
And these mistakes are the waves that I now ride
That I must ride
To the crash

As trite as Iâm true
I never thought that re-remembering me
Would mean remembering you
Iâm tragically left concave
From a love that could be a best seller
From a love that could be one of the best
From a love that could be a best seller
From a love that could rise above the rest

Can we run?
Resetting the stage
Thatâs what you came for
Resetting the stage
Now get what you came for
Go and run and get what you came for
Now did you get what you came for?

As trite as Iâm true..
