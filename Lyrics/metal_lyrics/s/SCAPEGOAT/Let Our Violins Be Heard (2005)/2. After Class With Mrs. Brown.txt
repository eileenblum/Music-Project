Impertently marked
The deign and the weary now
Govern my exult
Govern my heart, my mind, my body
The weight on my soul

Making love to her will always be
A frictional engrave to sought to not remember

Streaming real time
Closed screening in wait for what dreams may come
For what dreams often bring
A time when what I did was right
Before a calm resign
Between the girl and boy
Post mourning the most
Beautiful of days, weeks, months, years, lives

Making love to her will always be
A frictional engrave to sought to not remember
And word on the street is
That sheâs got a lot of love to give
Everything a boy could want in a girl

What are the odds of living it again?
Iâve got to become one with what Iâve been missing
It's long past been youâll never live it again
You want what you lost
You want what you brought to its end
Odds
The odds to live it again
Odds
What are the odds to live it again?

What am I running from lord?
Iâve got to find a way
Back into my mother's womb
That girl meant everything to me
My mother
My lover
My family

Over and over again
Without hesitation I will run
Over and over again
So go back to the one you love
What am I running from lord?
Wilt as Iâll wilt lord

Making love to her will always be
A frictional engrave to sought to not remember
And word on the street is
That sheâs got a lot of love to give
Everything a boy could want in a girl

Making love to her..
Its long past been youâll never live it again
