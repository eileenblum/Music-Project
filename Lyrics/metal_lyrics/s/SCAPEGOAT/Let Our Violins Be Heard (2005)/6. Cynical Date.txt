What a cynical date
I should have had you at the door
A door frame the barely stands today
Merely given a taste
And my hands are on the verge of breaking
From two years to this very day

Over come by you
And the limits are now limitless
And broken hearts will only keep us to the ground
And Iâm sorry if my compliments hurt you
But knowing this hurts even more
I guess youâll have to tape my mouth shut girl?
Beautiful

I feel the need to express the explosive emission
From a nuclear reactant chest
With a heart that is pumping the pending problem
You keep indulgence at bay
Indulgence takes me away
Makes room for replacement
Sets new pace to an old race
To become one with the better half
Of loves bittersweet
Bittersweet love

And as the waves collide
I collide

Over come by you
And the limits are now limitless
And broken hearts will only keep us to the ground
And Iâm sorry if my compliments hurt you
But knowing this hurts even more
I guess youâll have to tape my mouth shut girl?
Beautiful..

If you do not wish for these words
Why do you happily sit there and take them?
I promise the choice is yours
And Iâm not willing to make you take them
You love them
Girl

In life as in death I will always love you
Will always love you..

Bittersweet love..
I love you
I swear that I love you

And as the waves collide
I collide

Over come by you
And the limits are now limitless
And broken hearts will only keep us to the ground
And Iâm sorry if my compliments hurt you
But knowing this hurts even more
I guess youâll have to tape my mouth shut girl?
