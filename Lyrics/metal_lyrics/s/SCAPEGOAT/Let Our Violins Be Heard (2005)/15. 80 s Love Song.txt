I love you
In a promise
Open and always in every situation
No rhyme or reason
The reason sheâs leaving need not be given
For sheâs given more than any should
Given a lifetime
Given more than any should

Love
What a premise

Come one
Come all
Come again
Fellow ladies and gentlemen
I need your utmost attention
You wanted the story on how the story begins
But I tell you matter not with the beginning
But rather with the ending
For the end will set the story

The story of a young man
A nice working lad
Trying to get back what he never really had
He was waiting on his tax return
Taxes aside
Money couldnât save his life

He was hopeless
And left to die
All alone in the darkest of basements
In the blink of an eye
He went down

He was hopeless..

Girl you know its true
I once held care for you
But that lies neither here nor there but with the wind
Cause I tried so fucking hard to help you
Drop your guard
Just to build it higher than mountains in the end

He lashed out in denial and slander
She was always a bitch
Pussyâs always pussy
No matter what the label
Every meat will have its grade

And Iâm lost in the meaning of my own words
You reaffirmed what it meant to feel abandonment
And yet you flood the banks of my establishment
And Iâve been thinking this relationship over
Over and over, its clear to me now thereâs no us and weâre over

Hold the banks with what life you have left
Hold the banks with your lives
He lashed out in denial and uncouth words

What is denial?
Iâm not in denial
This is denial
This is slander

She was always a bitch
Pussyâs always pussy
No matter what the label
Every meat will have its grade
She was always a bitch

Fuck it

It may be wrong but it's my only way of dealing with it
Iâll say what I want
Until the cow comes home
Sheâs never coming back..
Sheâs gone

And now heâs looking for something
Real
Alive
Breathing

And now heâs starving for someone
And now heâs dying to find himself
Heâs in the field and yet the cow will never follow him home
And heâll say what he wants
Because sheâs never coming back..
And Iâm heading home
