Sinking in the eyes of an angel
I fight to rise above
Iâm swimming in an angelâs love
A midnight conversation lover
I bother not with the surface
For in her sea I find my purpose

I don't care
At all

And I know we will find our way
Guide us through
Your angel eyes will do

I wish that we could fall in love
But youâve got your wings to lift you
From the fear the fall

Iâm lost in time with this angel
The people watch this band
But Iâll take my chance in a new one-night stand
I stare at her with conviction
Convinced she is the one
I will not take my love and run

And I know we will find our way
Guide us through
Your angel eyes will do

I wish that we could fall in love
But youâve got your wings to lift you
From the fear the fall
Come down to me and disregard your wings
For when the angel falls in love my heart sings

When speaking of angels
The devil was the most powerful angel of all..

I wish that we could fall in love
But youâve got your wings to lift you
From the fear the fall
Come down to me and disregard your wings
For when the angel falls in love my heart sings

And I know we will find our way
Guide us through
Your angel eyes will do
