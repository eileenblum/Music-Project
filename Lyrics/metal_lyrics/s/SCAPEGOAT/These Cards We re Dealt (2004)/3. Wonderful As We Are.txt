Parched as we are and the sand still blows
The same as before same as before
The storm could even storm
Bird ever sing
Cat make a call that's my life
Inside a broken straw
Then I thought I saw an angel
I swear in all her glory
I thought I saw an angel
Wave in a break, grain against grain
Everything and all that's my life
Inside a broken straw in all whom I've lusted
Completion couldn't find a moon that always wanes
As long as the sand blows the same
Can we wane?
Weightless, stressors retreating, floating
Against all gravity
Inward onto abandon, weighting in all this gravity
Selfless beautiful angel, weighting all this gravity
