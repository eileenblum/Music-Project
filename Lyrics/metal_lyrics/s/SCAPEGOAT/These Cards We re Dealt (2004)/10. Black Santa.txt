Fuck the world &amp; every friend I ever had
For after falling in their arms
They just fucked me in the ass
But in a way we paved the way
We've dropped our pants and touched our toes away
We've sacrificed our means to disagree
So fuck what's real
And forget what's not
Cuz when it all is said &amp; done
Being fucked is what you've got
But friends will always be there when you're standing face to face
But when you're backs in view, they're sure to fuck you too
Were all just a whore who will flake away &amp; I'm sure to dissipate,
but mark my words my ghost will fuck you
We all will just as soon dissipate
Fuck family, fuck friends, fuck love, and fuck this band
Fuck it all, to its ends, well fuck each other over till we can no longer stand.
