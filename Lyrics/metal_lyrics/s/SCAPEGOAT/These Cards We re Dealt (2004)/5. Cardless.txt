Lay your cards down
Lets fight a war where the weapons equal fact
Put your ace down
Your smooth persona contradicts the way you act
He's not the only one, you've got a jack up your sleeve
He maybe the king of kings but you're the queen of thieves
You wanted to be heard I want to be heard too
On a post traumatic cruise with the God in you
I'll see your first bet I'll raise the heat thru truth and pressure;
rise Lets let the cat out,
we could make billions building kingdoms based on lies
&amp; of all these things you draw a line when a moment collapses into a year
of famine who are you to hold my hand?
You're looking to be hurt (news flash)
I wont be hurting you I've bailed on this ride
There never was a God in you.
