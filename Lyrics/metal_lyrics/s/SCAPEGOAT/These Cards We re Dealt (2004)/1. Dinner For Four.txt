Pull the curtain,
Bring wall paper,
down Like the burn of the oven
A note which knows no sound
One gram short of a pound
And all that jazz
On sky beams, or on cat walks, its all green to me
In short your growing into silence
A voice that cant be heard 20/20
But I am blind leave what you think behind
With half a distance of a distance
You will never arrive in short
You're growing into silence a bed which you have made
I will continue to support you
You think you cannot be out smarted
While you fuck me I'll keep my enemies close
While I fuck you too
Tension that comes from every direction
A pull without a release
It's good to know you feel the need to contract
Upon the very words in which I failed to react
For this is why I cannot let this bitterness lie
Virtue is my enemy with the devil at my side
He sits upon my shoulder, as I sit upon your words
Awaiting this consumption brings my level down to yours
When an eye is milked for all its worth
How can you ask why the weak must cry?
We've seen too much in this holocaust
We've unintentionally, internally brought upon us, actuality
Bringing us down to earth
