I've choked on the guilt, but you'll choke on me, my taste, &amp; all whom I've tasted words, deepest of deep from neck to my toes in this current that flows from a lie these are the reasons of how and why that I found order I'm tuning into the transmission radiating from you it comes clear thru static what once was emphatic is a negative twelfth step recovering addict I'll twist your knife inside this open wound Heart, weighed best like lead A dove that grew wings just to be pronounced dead by a boy Not a man but a boy A no merit critic that yearns to decree &amp; dictate her order Wrong enough on record, right enough in the heart I never thought an infantry could tear us apart If I'm dead to you now, wait till I fuck her &amp; I will talk a witness at hand Without defense, a witness without a witnessing stand I've choked on the guilt but you'll choke on me in her, you'll choke on me in her.
