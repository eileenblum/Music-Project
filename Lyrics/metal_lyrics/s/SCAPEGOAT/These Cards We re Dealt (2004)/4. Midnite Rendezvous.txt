Meet me by the watered rail
By the pier, I wait here I try to find myself
But I find myself inside of you
When I feel you, circum succumbing, surrounding me.
Become extinguished, no more burn enveloping on me
This I know, when I cum in you
So long since I've been, surrounded by you
It feels like I can't breathe
This coming release, on my skin &amp; under me, on sheets,
Disgust replace thee, I'm not wanted in this space, this place
Can't stand the thought of, of me inside you
It feels like I can't breathe
Everything you ever said was a lie
Everything we ever did was a lie
You live your life with the motive,
to be caught by the gullible eye.
