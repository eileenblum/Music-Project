I creep to the window and what do I find?
But two bodies in my bed with a body unlike mine,
His body's unlike mine thru crime
A window without light that burns
A bulb into the night my soiled eyes
They close you'll steal yourself a fairy tailers time
You'll find a way to keep a love like mine
Silk is smooth
But not as smooth as you it doesn't hook like you
It doesn't fuck like you do
Rub me down, and lay beside and practice giving in a dance we do
A dance we do, a dance a dance that I win
You'll steal yourself a fairy tailers time
You'll find a way to keep a love like mine
I hope I find the bridge we built and burn it down
Lord knows I've carried this weight by myself
By myself thru stories told
We space between the cast &amp; mold we ran the train on honesty
And left what left be honesty left untold rub me down
On your knees, practice giving in a dance we do
A dance that I win
It feels like we're making everything and nothing at all
