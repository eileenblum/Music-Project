To sit high in stomachs, to tend to nauseate am I rubbing off on you does it make you rubber, I'm on the bounce back, and I humbly denounce me, myself, and you On a playground, I take a snapshot of her tag sticking out By the water, I fell in love with the girl whose tag stood stout I am the liquor lining stomachs I cause butterflies, do my feet feel good on you? Or does it make you less than I'm no greater or equal to, the fractionate second that my fist connects with you A greater than digit with a negative sign Flipped over and divided by the opposite side I'm greater than your mouth gaping open With my dick in my hand Fractional ferocity Iron cast of fist is born Cannot sleep an hour more When vehemence boils remedy And never again will I be the garnered &amp; she's got everything to offer &amp; this I see when her eyes shine thru mine &amp; I ask her what she sees in me &amp; she answers softly this love can't be defined.
