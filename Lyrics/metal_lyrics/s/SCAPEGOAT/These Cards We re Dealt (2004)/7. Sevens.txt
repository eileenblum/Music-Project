that very man on the corner with sign in his hands has lost his whole as the six to a twelve year old, I became that very man with the hole faster than wind, you'll leave your mark I'm on the incline with seven feet your seven fucks away from innocence cigarette burns should adorn my arms I've broken crosses into x's another covenant means little in the moment I swear when I came here that I hated you but now I love you I'm seven drinks away from sober yet you will shine blessed with not a whole, I have not a whole, I have but a hole seven leaves, seven drinks, seven down, drown and sink, crown of thorns, rigid streets, habits on leave, I'm in hell.
