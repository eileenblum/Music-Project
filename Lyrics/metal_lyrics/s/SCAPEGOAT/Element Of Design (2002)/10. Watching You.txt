I watch my back
But still you linger
Not caring about a word I say
Nothing changes
and I grow weaker
Afraid of my feelings
And still you want me to stay
I watch my back
But still you linger
You're my back up
I know no other way
But if I grew up
And learned how to leave you
Would you love me more
Out of jealousy

So just tear
Me down
And break
Me down
Just take this all away

Its just the right time
To make it easier
It's the right time for now
If I just let it go
I might be sad
But it's the right time for now

Watch my back
And still you take away
You want my eyes on you, so you can grow
Not caring
If my heart just breaks
If you had one too
Your love would show
I wanna let you know
Just what you mean to me
You're so sweet and I can not describe
The anger I get
When you give back the love I gave
So now I'm dying
And I still hold your hand

So just tear
Me down
Just break
Away
Get your filthy paws off of me

God please, take me back
Rewind time, for I'm ruined now
for I wish, I was young
With a heart that's not ruined now

I rub my eyes, on edge of sleep
But this dream has become reality,
I neither want to wake up nor stay asleep,
But no longer will I push away memories
