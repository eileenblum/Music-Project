Blind by a veil self-implied,
My morals inside
Succumbing self abuse,
I slowly transform into you,
Hard to abstain from a high, for with it you fly,
In a leaf or on a bed
Abstinence has left me dead,

How do I ever turn around
When I'm broken, and livid, light headed
On the road to hell
And God is all I have

Touch my head,
Make me numb,
Make me see,
With this gift,
I'm not dead,
I will see

Again I wake with regret,
I've grown to detest
My actions like the night before,
Where rest is found on a floor,
Eyes glazed once again,
This veil is laced in
To lies your telling me,
I eat them for prosperity
