I felt so cold
when through me
she went

so though you're gone
your presence resides in me
till I can show you that I'm something tonight
is there a way to cut these corners?
until I know I'll give it all I've got

throw me away
cuz its cold outside
so throw me away

ice sharp as knives
is spread through my neck
I thrive and I feed
on your kiss
which I live

despite myself control
I can't keep my hands off of you
and even if I tried
I don't think it would last very long
so I'm searching through my heart
I'm finding where you stay
so I can separate myself
and tear you away
