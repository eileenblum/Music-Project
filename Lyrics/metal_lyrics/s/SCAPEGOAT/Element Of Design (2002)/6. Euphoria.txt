Bathed in moon light
this water on your skin makes you beautiful tonight
and I'm drawn in
by the reflection in your eyes

But what I feel I forfeit when I pretend you're right
because everything in your wish is my will too
but it's an itch I cannot reach
that underlying fear that with you in my life
I will never be but a
dove...
with no wings...
I fall...
from your tree...

And you don't know
please don't leave me alone
for I will love you more
more and more each day

So reach for me
just reach for me

And I don't know
what had me at first
it must have been your smile
or that look in your eyes
so go...
and burn me again...
but just know...
that I might not be here...
waiting...

And you don't know
please don't leave me alone
for I will love you more
more and more each day

Oh hurt,
it seems we were meant to be
oh pain,
you are my soul mate

Why can't I just be happy
why can't I just be free
happy and free

Because you're my love
and I am hooked
so hear my cry
and kiss me today
