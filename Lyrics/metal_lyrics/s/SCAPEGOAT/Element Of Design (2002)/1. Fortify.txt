the smell of piss and shame
gives new life to this lifeless place
but there's something about the stench and these walls
my head cocks back and my cells respond
and though recoiled, I may be
this place always relived in memory
could you ever conceive this by looking at me
you stupid bitches couldn't see through these clothes

Think of me...
An Element...
Of design...

but still your tone is sharp
and your words can cut like a knife
so here I am, please cut me down again
I am the one who will get up once more
fortified by what you want from me

tingled deep through finger tips
your touch reminds me of this place
but there's something about your aura and your skin
your head cocks back and your nose turns up at me
and so I try to break away
from this hell that you call life
you could never conceive these things by looking at me
you stupid bitches couldn't see through this skin

I'll change never change my mind
of who I am inside
fall away from
and taste what I am
