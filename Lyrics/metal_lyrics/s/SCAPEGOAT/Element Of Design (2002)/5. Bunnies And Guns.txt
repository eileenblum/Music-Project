to be is better than not to be
but to indulge in oneself
is a crime I won't commit
commit me

if to be means living a life of blind complacency
than I am not to be the one lifting my life away
when I have better things to do so lets fight

another life awaits in front of you
where your guns will never ever do
so what will you prove
without your loot
and I'll play the bunny just for you
but your guns will never ever do
so how will you prove
without your boot
