So come clean
because above all I want you to be honest with me
&amp; in the end nobody wants to be lied to
but my hopes are restored when you say you still love me
but I know you couldn't love for your life

But still he gives it all he's got
because his name is child and its written in blood
that you can fight it all you want
but if there's something that this world doesn't have
its a thing called love

&amp; its clear
that you could care less about others
because in the end you always come out on top
yet my faith is renewed when you say you still love me
but I know you couldn't love for your life

But still he gives it all he's got
because this nameless child is written in blood
and you can fight it all you want
but if there's something that you don't know
its a thing called love

But this gift
personified like it's alive itself
because after all this work you know it bleeds with me
and all bets are off when you say you don't love me
but I know you couldn't love for a gun to your head
