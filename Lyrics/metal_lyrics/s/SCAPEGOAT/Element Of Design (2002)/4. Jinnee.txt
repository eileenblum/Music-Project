this heart that you once knew
this heart has since been sold
and when karma came around
it hit your heart ten fold
and now I feel on higher plain
I'm looking down on you

I've got you around my finger
mother always makes things better
and I'm not better anymore

my confidence is high
and my nose for once turns up
your spitting out excuses
but your speech is yet abrupt
and there she is
she's like the wind
she comes and goes
leaving me breathless

this rabbit hole gets deeper
I'm losing grip with finger
well I'm not better anymore

I won't absorb you anymore
