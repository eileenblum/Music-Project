you said I was something new
something you've never known before
and you have forced me to let go
and you're not worth one of my tears

and still it's sad that you can't see all this
stained are the papers that I slave over for you
so just stay, in your four walls
don't blot my tear just let me drown and stay out of mine

and now I turn my back
and I refuse to look in your eyes
and in time it all will fade away
and I'll wipe this tear off my cheek

and I will wipe
this tear off my cheek
and I wont drown
in these useless tears
