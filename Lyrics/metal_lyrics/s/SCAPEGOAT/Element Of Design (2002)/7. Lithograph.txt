times have changed
and acceptance should come of all things naturally
because I am sick of dealing with your view
of my reality

to those girls
with bleeding eyes
whom pull on me
like moon to the tides

you make me see things
aren't easily divided

to those girls
which I despise
you can't see through me
with your piercing eyes

never again will I change
to be part of your augmented society
