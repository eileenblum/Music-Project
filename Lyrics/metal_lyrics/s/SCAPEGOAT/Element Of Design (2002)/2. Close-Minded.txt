You feel more
secluded from me today
yet I feel more
excluded by what you say

So cut me out more
because I am more now

You step in
to rest your simple case
but I know I'm not ready
for that smack in my face

So cut me out more
because I am more now

But then I will hit you back
because I'm back and I learned from the sting
when you slapped my face
but get back and you'll learn too
when I hit you back
because I'm back and I learned from the sting
when you slapped my face

Because I am more now
