Downward spiral
I thought the worst had passed me by
but I can't go on
in this cycle I know too well

So fly......away.....
and I'll kill you before I kill myself to be......
free

Long discussions
I tell you how I feel
but still you sit there waiting
eyes are cold, and your heart is black
but still he walks slowly
the same rhythm of feet on floor
just to kill me softly
but I'll kill you before I kill myself

So fly......away.......
and I'll take you before I take myself and be......
free

One more romance
one more hate unto my heart
until I stick this through him
and I'm covered in his blood
and I hope they both die
a painful death which I deserve
cuz I'm always wrong
so myself,... so ya know I'll be free

Hate is such a strong word
yet it seems to perfectly describe my feelings towards you
