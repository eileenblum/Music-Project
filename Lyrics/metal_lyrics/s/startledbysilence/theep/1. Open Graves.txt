Their throat is an open grave.
With their tongues, they keep deceiving.
Snake venom drips from their lips.
Their mouths are full of bitterness.

Weâre falling on our knees,
because the path of peace, we have not known. (Have not known)

Their feet are swift to shed blood,
destruction and misery are on their path.
The fallen, the risen, the found and the missing.

Weâre falling on our knees,
because the path of peace, we have not known. (Have not known)
