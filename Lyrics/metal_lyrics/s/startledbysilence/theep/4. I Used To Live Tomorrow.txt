I am losing the way.
I keep looking back.
I canât move forward, petrified.
It is the voice inside my head.

Never try running back in time.
Donât ever reset, rewind.
Yesterday was another day.
Whatâs now is here to stay. (Here to stay)

Dawn is breaking over the valley of shadows, the shadow of death.
Done fighting the fight, the sun sets, now I stand in lasting light.
Been digging a hole, then buried it all, haunting memories forever perished.

Never try running back in time.
Donât ever reset, rewind.
Yesterday was another day.
Whatâs now is here to stay. (Here to stay)

Sometimes I think about the past and fall apart inside,
and why it feels so hard to leave it all behind.

Haunting memories forever perished.
Haunting.

Never try running back in time.
Donât ever reset, rewind.
Yesterday was another day.
Whatâs now is here to stay. (Here to stay)
