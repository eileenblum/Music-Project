My Ship âs almost sinking,
in the ocean of misery.
Oh let my heart be still
like you calmed the sea.

The rising water has reached my neck.
These waves are about to cover me.
I am sinking down, I am sinking down.
Black depths are touching my feet,
my eyes, they cannot see.

We fight this war together,
our victory will be forever (forever)

Donât let the deep sea swallow me,
or the grave close its mouth on me.
Lead me to still waters, lead me to still waters.
A place to sew these sails,
need to be given,
a safe haven.

We fight this war together,
our victory will be forever (forever)

My ship âs almost sinking,
In the ocean of misery.
Oh let my heart be still
like you calmed the sea.
