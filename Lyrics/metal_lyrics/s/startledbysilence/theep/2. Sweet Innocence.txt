You were my flower,
together weâd bloom.
Iâll hope Iâll meet you,
Iâll meet you soon.

Sweet innocence.
Where did you go?
We were lovers once,
but lies tore us apart.
(Tore us apart)

Swallowing my pride,
leaving old ways behind.
A new start.
A pure heart.

Sweet innocence.
Where did you go?
We were lovers once,
but lies tore us apart.
(Tore us apart)

I am a seeker of truth.

Sweet innocence!
Where did you go?
We were lovers once,
but lies tore us apart.
(Tore us apart)
