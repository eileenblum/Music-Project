I am your worst nightmare,
The one who loves despair.
Come on and let these lies
Keep you from closing your eyes.

Darling now sleep.
Don't cry, don't weep!

So do not fear, for I am with you.
I'll be the light in your darkest night.

Evil is creeping in,
A wolf in sheep's clothing.
Come on and let these lies
Keep you from closing your eyes.

So do not fear, for I am with you.
I'll be the light in your darkest night.
