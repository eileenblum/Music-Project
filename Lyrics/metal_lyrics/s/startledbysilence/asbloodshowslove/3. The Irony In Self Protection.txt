I wanted to be loved,
For how great I am.
I am still fighting for my pride,
For what I have done.
Why would you clear my tracks?
When you're the basis for action.

I am afraid it will crash and burn,
I know I am in deep.
I know I'm slowly failing,
But still I'll climb up myself.

I refuse to fullfill your desires,
Because my plans will take you higher.

I have always tried to live life by myself.
I don't want you to solve,
I don't want you to fix this shit.
Let my troubles be mine,
My depths are my challenges.

I am afraid it will crash and burn,
I know I am in deep.
I know I'm slowly failing,
But still I'll climb up myself.

Are you falling or is it flying?
Are you burning or igniting?
What is the meaning of your trust,
When you ignore my biggest promise.
