You took the wrong turn,
The worst path to choose.
Stuck on the crossing.
A narrow border between life and death.

This is your life falling to the ground
Into a million shattered pieces.
Dry bones are all there's left,
for empty promises never last.

One man stood up to rescue you,
Struggled to open the door.
The small chance he had: at least he tried,
His blood is on your hands.

This is your life falling to the ground
Into a million shattered pieces.
Dry bones are all there's left,
for empty promises never last.

I can see a dead end coming in your way
Are you sure you're here to stay?

What were you thinking?
The panic cut off your limbs.
It cost him his life,
His blood wasted for you.

This is your life falling to the ground
Into a million shattered pieces.
Dry bones are all there's left,
for empty promises never last.
