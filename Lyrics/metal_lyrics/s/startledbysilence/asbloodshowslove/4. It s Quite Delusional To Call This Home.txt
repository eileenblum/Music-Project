When will this house become a home?
When will you stop wandering alone?
You've got a place to lay your head,
But do you ever really rest?
Though you've got a place to lay your head.

I'm coming home in your arms.
I find freedom in your scars.

I am trapped in this place,
Searching for a solid base.
Will you hear my call,
And help me break down this wall.

I'm coming home in your arms.
I find freedom in your scars.

Now keep your eyes shut,
Like you keep your doors locked!
