Blood in the water
Sharks chomping at the bit.
False brethren of the code
Have sunken lower than shit.
Self-proclaimed worldly masters,
Charted our demise,
Strayed us from our course.
You fuckers I despise.
I hate the sea and everything in it.
Blown your wind into our sail,
Then set fire to our mirth.
Left shipwrecked upon the rocks,
Whilst you reveled in your worth.
Your empires will turn to ashes,
At these hands you'll die.
The Biggest mistake you've ever
Made was leaving us alive.
I hate the sea.
Fuck you.
