Damn girl, what's your deal?
We were just tryin' to cop a feel
Seems ya got beat with an ugly stick
And those thighs are lookin' pretty thick
Your genetics didn't bless you
So its booze to the rescue!
Your hotness level just got toggled
Embrace the power of beer goggles

Its an age old technique
For in between the sheets
Refill our empty cups
Blood alcohol level up!

[Chorus]

You got what it takes to fuck some whales?
Man the harpoons! Let's bag some tail!

Wouldn't fuck ya with someone else's dick
Ladies, we could have our pick
But thanks to liquid sense destroyers
We're equal opportunity employers
Even your goddamn rolls have rolls
Before we put it in yar holes
We'll find a toilet so we can yack
Then pound ya with our monster sacks
Bump and grind like you're a perfect ten
You think it'll last, but think again
Kick ya to the curb and hit the road
Shotgun some cans for a quick reload
Keep tellin' yourself personality matters
As last call quickly descends
Hazy judgments become our friends
