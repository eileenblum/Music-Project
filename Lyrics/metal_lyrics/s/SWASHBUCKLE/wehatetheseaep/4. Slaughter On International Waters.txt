Gathering from the corners of the Earth
In Miami, the bravest ship made berth
Their sights were set on paradise
High time to get that beer on ice
Pile in to your tiny staterooms
Assume that you will meet your doom
Fuck the silly safety lesson
Tasty buffets and cold ones beckon!

[Chorus]

Grab the dudes, its time for a cruise!
With kickin' tunes and bitchin' booze!
Now witness a massive slaughter
Out on international waters

It would be the party of our lifetime
So good it would feel like crime
Swaying to the motion of the tides
We were in for one hell of a ride
Titties poppin' out on deck
Massive mounds to turn our necks
Familiar faces from port to starboard
Pure, unfiltered fun occurred
Bottles were rocked off the shelves
Act after act all gave 'em hell
Inside the hull, beneath the stars
The fans and bands dried up the bars

No where to run, no where to hide
A place where heros and zeros collide
The wildest four days of all our lives
A miracle every soul survived
