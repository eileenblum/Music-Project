Taking to the sails at dawn
Ravage the seven seas
Yo ho, Yo ho, this Pirates life for me
We'll slit your throat, you'll walk the plank
The sharks are all you'll see
Yo ho, Yo ho, 'cause Pirates we all be

Reaching Port Town by dusk
The jolly roger flying high
Caught in a fairwinds sky
We've come to rape and pillage â 
And plunder the village

Too the tavern we'll march
Alcohol surrounds â The true commodore of the seas
Rum and ale, to corrupt our black hearts
Through bloodshot eyes we'll claim our prize
Wenches and whores and gold gallore
We'll call this rusty shanty 'home'
for but one night, come morn â we'll roam
Across the seas, to the horizon's edge

Avast ye!
Hornswaglin' swashbucklers!
Buccaneers of the Spanish Main
The scourge of all scallywags
Swimming in doubloons â Yet still marooned
On some godforsaken island

Drink Up

Nothin' left to do but bury in sand
Bury our hope â upon Cap'n's demand
Treasure in a chest â Marked with an 'X'
Sail into the golden sunset
In a world of map drawn lines â 
True paradise defined
Yo ho, Yo ho, in this Pirates life of mine

[Lyrics: Commodore RedRum &amp; Admiral No Beard]
