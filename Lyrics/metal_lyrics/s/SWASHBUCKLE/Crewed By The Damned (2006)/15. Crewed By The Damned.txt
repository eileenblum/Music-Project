[Lyrics: RedRum]

Under the curse we sail the seas
In this goddamned pirates life we lead
Plunder Plunder â Chests of Wonder
Buried deep within the sand
Pillage Pillage â Raid the Village
Fire the cannon's and make a stand

We are...
Crewed by the Damned!
All hopes lost
Crewed by the Damned!

Moonlight pears through all out fears
Exposing bleached white bone
Wooden Legs and Emptied Kegs
We sail into the black unknown
We may never again see sight of land
In this pirates tale so grand

We are...
Crewed by the Damned!
All hopes lost
Crewed by the Damned!
