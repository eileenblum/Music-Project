[Lyrics: Nobeard]

Mutiny on the bound
Gather the crew around
Tie the traitor's hands
You'll have no time think
As we watch you sink
Boots filled with sand

Walk the Plank!
High Fives! Plank Dives!

Treason is the reason
That you're gonna die!

High Fives! Plank Dives!

The depths of the ocean
Is where your carcass lies!
