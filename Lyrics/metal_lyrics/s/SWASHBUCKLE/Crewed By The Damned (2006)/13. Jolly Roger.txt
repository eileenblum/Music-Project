[Lyrics: Rowin' Joe Po]

We be the nomads of the sea
We fight and pilfer because we are free
Sailing through tempests fueled by our greed
To obtain thy treasure 'tis the key

Royal Soldiers should beware
Seeing our flag flying through the air
Swinging aboard to raid your boat
Try to stop us and we'll slit your throat
All townsfolk should heed these words
Fear the Jolly Roger!

Grog and booty, they mean the most
When we have them, we love to boast
But ale and wenches do come close
Land Ahoy! In the crow's nest I spot the coast
