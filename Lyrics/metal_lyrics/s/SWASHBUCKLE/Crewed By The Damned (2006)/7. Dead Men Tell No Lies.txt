[Lyrics: RedRum]

Batten down the hatches men
We've been through hell and back again
Traitors â seen 'em come and go
No scars, no gold, no pride to show
The price to pay for mutiny
Is somewhat certain death
For you to see

Dead men tell no lies

Betrayers of the code must know
Seeds of vengeance will soon be sown
We'll gather round will all our loot
And tie a cannon to your boots

Dead men tell no lies
