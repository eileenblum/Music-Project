The enemy ships are within our sights.
War on high seas, prepare for blood tonight.
Fire the cannons to breach their hulls, we'll kill them and claim the gold, ATTACK!!
we attack in the night!
Scour the ships in search for treasure.
Thrashing and slashing, your death is our pleasure.
With blood on our swords and our ales raised to the sky, now you ships are are burned, our black flag flying high.
