A major payoff we cannot afford.
We live only for the gold we hoard.
Hunted down by English lords.
Spending life at the end of a sword.
Live to loot, now die in yar boots!
Kill the brethren of the coast and to our corpses they shall roast.
The royal navy's on the loose,
Sail into hell and back to the noose!
There's no stopping 'til we're dead,
And these seas run bloody red.
The royal navy's on the loose,
Sail into hell and back to the noose!
Tell me why we grind death's gears,
Tending to treasures of yesteryears.
Are rubies and pearls,
Like falling stars,
Enough to warrant these endless scars?
Live to loot, now die in yar boots!
Kill the brethren of the coast and to our corpses they shall roast.
Back to the noose!
Nowhere to turn but back to the noose!
Tells us world, are you all scared?
You'd better fucking come prepared.
Choose a side, don't be afraid,
Draw the line that digs your grave, the floor is your, brave gallants, all.
Break the chains and heed the call.
The choice is yours, now no mistakes.
From here on out it's take, take, take!!!
