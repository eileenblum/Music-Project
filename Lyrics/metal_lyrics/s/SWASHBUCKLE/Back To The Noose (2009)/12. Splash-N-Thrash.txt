The time hath come for you to take a dive, into shark infested waters, try to stay alive.
This be the only way for ye to join our crew, death or piracy, what will ye choose?
Brave the circling jaws of death to survive.
Kill the sea beasts, then yar cash flow will thrive.
Revered and feared among the oceans blue.
Sail and thrash, the pirates life for you!
Take a splash, it's time to thrash.
We steal all the cash.
Let's all splash while we thrash.
Stomp and mosh this piratical bash!
Cruise the seas with we the pirates thee.
Plundering inland, along the coast we be.
In it for the wenches and doubloons.
Our swords slash as we set fire to pontoons.
Take no prisoners, dead men tell no lies.
Black hearts race fast every chance we get to die.
So raise yar ales and sails, it's time to have some fun.
When you party with the pirates, the mayhem's never done.
