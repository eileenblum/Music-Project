All aboard!

Swim for it.
We stole your shit.
Satchels thick.
Throats now slit.
No doubloons?
Leave them marooned.
Checks and charges?
What be this garbage?

Pearls and lace. Make no waste
Rum for taste. Loot with haste.

Party boat, party boat, party boat.
Vacation at the sea.
You've sailed uncharted waters.
Now you'll cease to be.
Party boat, party boat, party boat.
Nowhere near the land.
By the time they find you,
you'll have died by our hands.
CRUISE SHIP TERROR!

No survivors.
Set it afire.
A burning mast.
Now avast.
Our hull's full with valuables.
We'll sail away to loot more pay.

Take the woman.
Leave them frantic.
We are Swashbuckle.
We sunk the Titanic.

Party boat, party boat, party boat.
Vacation at the sea.
You've sailed uncharted waters.
Now you'll cease to be.
Party boat, party boat, party boat.
Nowhere near the land.
By the time they find you,
you'll have died by our hands.
CRUISE SHIP TERROR!

Yo ho! Yo ho! Yo ho! Yo ho!
Yo ho! Yo ho! Yo ho! Yo ho!
Yo ho! Yo ho! Yo ho! Yo ho!
Yo ho! Yo ho! Yo ho! Yo ho!
