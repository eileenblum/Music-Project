Around and down 'n down Who it drowns you'll never know.
So thrash about this oceanic mosh, chug some rum and get really sloshed.
Stomp on if ye privy to explore.
Us pirates three will open the floor.
Pump yar hooks in this circular beast, for the centrifugal force will never cease.
The bigger it gets, the higher the deaths!
To Davy Jones' locker with no regrets!
Ye slammed the hardest and that's what counts, to conquer the whirlpit, be a king of the mount!
To smash through sun or cloud, our heavy metal shreds aloud!
Feel the urge for a moshing fit?
Can ye survive...
THE WHIRLPIT!!!
