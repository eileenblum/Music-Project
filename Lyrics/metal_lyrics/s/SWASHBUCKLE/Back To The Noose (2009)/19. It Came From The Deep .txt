The foul stench of death looms in the air as we encroach on the uncharted seas.
Braving the maelstrom,
Poseidon displeased.
Waves of rain wash o're the deck as wind tear apart the towering sails.
Out of the water comes a beast from hell.
Sailing the seas, disturbing it's sleep.
Surface to slaughter.
Hell it's unleashed.
Total destruction, on the sea floor it creeps.
Awaiting the bloodbath,
IT CAME FROM THE DEEP!!
A race to survive this harbinger of death, maneuver through the deadly drink.
Tentacles thrashing, we've started to sink, crushing the bow with gargantuan weight.
Bludgeoning the crew with all too much haste,
To wet it's gullet, our blood it must taste!
With eyes like the size of massive moons it foresees or impending doom.
A world afire, seas dried like land.
Armageddon!
The end at hand!
Sailing the seas, disturbing it's sleep.
Swimming for vengeance, our deaths it shall reap
Upon the ocean's floor it steadily creeps, to reign hell on earth,
IT CAME FROM THE DEEP!
With the head of a shark and the body of a squid.
The colossus' attack came from beneath.
Blood on the deck and flesh in its teeth.
Abandon ship, for we cannot win!
Ruthless and vicious, to kill us with ease.
Bloodthirsty tyrant claims mankind a disease.
With eyes like the size of massive moons it foresees or impending doom.
A world afire, seas dried like land.
Armageddon!
The end at hand!
You pirates ruined my nap!
The world'll pay, because of your crap
I will feast upon this human race and bring devastation to this place!
This planet I will devour and make make this your final hour.
Eternity in these watery crypts, fear my name:
SHARKTOPUSCALYPSE!!!
