The taste of victory takes on it's hold.
Round 'n round the world of splendid gold.
A euphoric state, suspended bliss.
Blackened out of one's consciousness.
Grog box,
Grog box,
Grog box,
Ale in a wooden box.
From the tap, happiness comes pouring out,
From the drink we can't do without.
Rips the feeling from all our minds, and slowly halts the march of time.
Grog box,
Grog box,
Grog box, piracy on tab.
Pass the grog, pass the gin, we'll grin as we remove their skin.
Pass the grog, pass the gin, we'll grin as we indulge in sin.
