A sea of goods just await to escape, into the hands of those who pillage and rape.
Throw the sails upon the wind and bury the treasure for the next of kin.
No prey,
No pay,
No gold today!
The pitiful ones we rob and raid are the renewable resource from witch we take pay.
If they didn't exist upon the sea, then our pirate lives would cease to be.
No pray,
No pay,
No gold today!
Could it be?
Can't you see?
This pirates life was meant to be!!!
