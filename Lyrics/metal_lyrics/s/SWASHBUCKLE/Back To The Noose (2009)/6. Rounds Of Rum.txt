Mellifluous melodies and timely honored hymns,
Golden rounds of rum to fill us to the fuckin' brim.
Anticipated anthems one longs to yell aloud.
So chant the chorus loud and clear among the weary crowd...
Let fly the air of introversion and release the treasured tunes!
Decorous ditties and jeering jawns upon each moon!
Arias so exalting when hummed they make us proud.
So chant the chorus loud and clear among the weary crowd...
Rallying requiems so exquisite in design,
Nocturnes of our victories penned in endless rhyme
Sonorous sonatas that cast a sprightly shroud.
So chant the chorus loud and clear among the weary crowd...
Rounds of rum for all to drink, pints of booze surround!
Rounds for all to sink, down them by the pound!
Measures complimented by the drowning flow ale.
Refrains of every stirring song to wake the epic tale.
And when the final note is breathed and silence is allowed.
So chant the chorus loud and clear among the weary crowd...
