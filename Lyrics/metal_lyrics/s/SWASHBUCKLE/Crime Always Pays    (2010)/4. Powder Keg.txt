[Music â Nobeard, Lyrics â RedRum]

Peace, dormancy notwithstanding
Your diplomacy's too demanding
Outbursts of total war
Now you're drowned to the sea floor

Stocked barrels of black powder
To blow up things way fucking louder
Busting caps across the ocean
Splinters fly, chaos set in motion

[Chorus]
Lift our cups!
Blow shit up!
Drink 'em down!
Make 'em drown!

Territorial dominance askew
Internal conflict seeping through
Analogies drawn upon the walls
Forged from every strife and squall

These circumventive stalemates
Feed our venal crew of reprobates
The genesis of a corrupted creed
Sparkling at the heart of want and need
