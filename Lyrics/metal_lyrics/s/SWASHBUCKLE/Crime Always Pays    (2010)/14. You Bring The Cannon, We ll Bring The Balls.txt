[Music â Nobeard, Lyrics â RedRum / Nobeard]

Over trivial matters, wars are fought
Absconding with things we never bought
Keeping true to the code, our faith's decree
Fighting 'til death while the cowards flee

[Chorus]
You bring the cannon, we'll bring the balls
Gonna smash these heads into the Goddamned walls!
'Neath the glooming moon or glowing sun
Gonna rage the faces off of everyone!

Cavil down if you'd like
You're just another match to strike
Demur over mere scruples?
Meet a bullet between your pupils!
Pacified fools, rejoice!
We're here to make your choice
Fret not the end of days
Dote upon rational gaze

Life washes clean of all regrets
Death looms in every silhouette
A world of slaughter
A world of tears
A word of wisdom
In a world of fear
A mind of misery
A mind of disillusion
A moment of clarity
In a mind of confusion
As all mistakes awake
Shaky concentration breaks
Unreality begins to flood
Lingering on drops of blood
Reckless sentiments
Shade in diagrams of spite
All we need is fire
For this revelry to ignite
