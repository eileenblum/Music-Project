[Music â Nobeard / RedRum, Lyrics â Nobeard]

There's a feeling of dread in the air once we draw near
Throughout every tavern, cove and town we've instilled the fear
No place to hide whilst still alive, we'll hunt ye down
Nothing is safe as we make haste just to see you drown

Your power of ale is destined to fail with no chance to prevail
So cower in your mail as the winds grace our sails, we'll drag you to hell

[Chorus]
As lightning cracks the sky, you're out of time
Thunder bellows loud, now you must die
On a quest for blood, we'll leave you ripped and torn
Your death awaits with no glorious fate
For we are the storm

With the slash of our sabers and a will to kill, heads will roll
We'll take your life, then your wife, and horde the loot we stole
No chance of survival, you're in denial, its all true
The pirates three will ruin your life then run you through

So you think you can drink while your shit don't stink
And try to hang with the happy little boozers
Well we got news for you, and it's always been true
You're just another worthless fucking loser
With praise of the hammer and your face all in paint
Do you really believe you're a warrior now?
The only battle you've seen is on a computer screen,
If confrontation strikes, you hide like a coward

We'll put you in your place and leave you with disgrace
Steal your life like a band of crooks
So fuck the hammer and all its pathetic glamor
Now's the time for you to  hail to the hook!
