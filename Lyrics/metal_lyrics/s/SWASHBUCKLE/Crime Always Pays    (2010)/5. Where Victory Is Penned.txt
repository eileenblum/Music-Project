[Music â Nobeard, Lyrics â RedRum]

A power that words cannot express
Washes over in waves of excess
Struck from a purely angelic medium
With a voice that makes the soul go numb
A complexion white as ivory's glow
Flawless locks that dance and fucking flow
An incandescent gaze that topples men
The jeweled eyed jilter gleams again
Softly sing the vales of perfection
Masters of illusion and misdirection
Like chasing dreams never caught before
To conquer wisdom never brought ashore

Jealous was the sun that day
To be outshined in every way
Beauty one cannot comprehend
This is where victory is penned

Their magic goes without question
And quickly turns into obsession
Glorious battles won on sea and ground
Yet this triumph's far more profound
There's more here than meets the eye
Beneath her glistening shell, lay lies
Unfortunate events draw near
As tragedy blazes new frontiers
The clouded mist of a midnight tryst
Billows forth in the lovers' midst
Emotions pinned against a wall
Buoyed hopes are sure to fall
Heirlooms scattered amongst a room
Decaying blooms construct her tomb
Communication falters fast
Nonimmune to every spell she casts

The water runs red with malice
Let us furnish our floating palace
With the carrions of so-called "friends"
This is where victory is penned

To expect nil and be just rewarded
In a place where goddesses are courted
Deserves a victory lap sailed 'round the world
And still-beating hearts of every goetic girl
She is the sober intoxication
Of a pointless destination
A tangible personification
Of a fiery misinterpretation
Peal away her finest lineaments
What remains is euphonic torment
Know that barking up her ember's tree
Will be only furthered into a memory

Broken traces of disgrace
Brings new meaning to this place
Vibes in the minds that will not mend
This is where victory is penned
