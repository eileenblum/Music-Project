[Music â Nobeard, Lyrics â RedRum]

You stuff your face
Hoping never to be lean
For fear of what shall be
Untipping scales, low fat cuisine
You cook up the dough
But the calories don't bestow
The girth that might be right
To enjoy the spoils of your sailor sights

[Chorus]
Why can't we grab some grub?!
Some grub to clog our veins!
Nourishment â deep inside of you!
We know that gluttony's not wrong!

So fill your plates and bowls!
And sup a hearty stew
Down the gullet to your bulbous arse
A pirate's body looks good on you!

Never, ever believe
All your meals were wasted
'Cause you'll never know
How good a pirate's life has tasted

So many people have drawn veils over their eyes
Afraid. Afraid of what they might see
As did those who kept hidden inside
Afraid. Afraid of what they might be

Surf-n-Turf! For Piratical Girth!
