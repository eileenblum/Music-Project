Why -Do you do the things that make you lie?
Cry - It does not excuse all the lies
Fate - God led you to this place to see
See -That you will never get to me
No one can get to me
Feel -All the hate that will make me feel
Touch -The power that made you reveal
Pain - And the facade of who you see
See -That you'll never get to me
No one can get to me
Dire routine passion show
No one will ever know
Can you cure me?
Can you see?
The broken path that gets to me
You can't cure me now you must see
You have created the society
No one can get to me
