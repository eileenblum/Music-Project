Nothing
Nothing for me
Nothing for you
Nothing
Nothing to see
Nothing to do
Nothing
Nothing to give
Nothing to prove
Nothing
Nothing to see
Nothing to lose
Nothing for me
Nothing for you
Nothing to see
Nothing to do
You can't be what you want to be
Nothing
Nothing to hide
Nothing to steal
Nothing
Nothing to care
Nothing to feel
Nothing
Nothing but want
Nothing but need
Nothing
Nothing but hate
You want to feed
Nothing for me
Nothing for you
Nothing to see
Nothing to do
You can't be what you want to be
Look what you've become
You're the only one
That is left to inside
Alone and don't deny
You can't be what you want to be
