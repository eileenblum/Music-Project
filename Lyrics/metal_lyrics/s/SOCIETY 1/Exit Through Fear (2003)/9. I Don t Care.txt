I will not listen to you
Don't ever tell me what you want me to do
Don't want to listen to your lies
Now here's the one thing that might be a surprise
I don't care
Nothing you do or say will make me care today
I don't care
I'll always do just what I want
This is something that I love and always flaunt
Now theirs something to decide
Will you care about the ones who fucken lied?
I don't care
Nothing you do or say will make me care today
I don't care
How can I care?
How can I care?
When no one cares for me?
How can I care?
How can I care?
What's there to do?
I hate you and what you are to me
I see the filth in your eyes
Cheat and just lie then deny
It's what you need to be
Keeping the rock dream alive
I don't care
Nothing you do or say will make me care today
I don't care
