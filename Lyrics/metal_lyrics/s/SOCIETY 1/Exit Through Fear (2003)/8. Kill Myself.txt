Look at what I have done
Look at what I've become
The power of my name
Has driven me insane
Don't know what else to say
There's nothing left to say
Time to make this go away
I want to kill myself inside of you
So when I die you'll feel what you put me through
I can't live with you here
Wanting me it's all for fear
Don't know what else to say
There's nothing left to say
I'd die to make this go away
I want to kill myself inside of you
So when I die you'll feel what you put me through
Looking at me
What do you see?
Someone you want
Something to be
Worship me now
Wondering how
You can become the only one
I want to kill myself inside of you
So when I die you'll feel what you put me through
