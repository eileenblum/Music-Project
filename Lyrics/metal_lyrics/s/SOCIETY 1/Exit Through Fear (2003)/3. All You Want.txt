Want you
Need you
To be you
Keep you
To see you
Touch you
To feel you
Love you
I am the one you want
What do you want?
Want me
Need me
To use me
Be me
To touch me
Feel me
To lose me
Love me
I am the one you want
What do you want?
Watch it all fall down
So far away
How'd this come to be?
It is not around
Were did it go?
It can not be found
Will I ever know?
Watch it all fall down
Down
Down
Down
Go down
I am the one you want
What do you want?
