How did it feel to fuck a god?
One of the many worshipping cock facade
Did it give the power you believed?
Did your friends confirm all that you need?
Preach it now with such respect
Years later and it's still in effect
Hold it dear close to your soul
Now come closer so my message can be told
Feel - every one of them
Fuck - everyone of them
Touch -everyone of them
Because Everyone Dies
Break - every one of them
Suck - everyone of them
Kill - everyone of them
Because Everyone Dies
It's all a part of the game
You say it proud with no shame
Brag about it all the time
Exception to the rules, so divine
Now it's done it's all you have
The one time in your life that you could grasp
The only thing that ever filled the hole
So fuck on you have no soul
Feel - every one of them
Fuck - everyone of them
Touch -everyone of them
Because Everyone Dies
Break - every one of them
Suck - everyone of them
Kill - everyone of them
Because Everyone Dies
I will take you
Then will break you
Push you into all that I do
Die
It makes me feel so fucking sick
To think of his filthy dick
But it starts to hurt me more
When I think you are a whore
Little girl so loose and wrecked
How many did that man infect?
Could you give him anymore?
Than what you gave you little whore
You're all the same that's what you're for
Kill everyone of them
Fuck - Fuck - Fuck
Because Everyone Dies
Kill - Kill - Kill
Because Everyone Dies
Feel - every one of them
Fuck - everyone of them
Touch -everyone of them
Because Everyone Dies
Break - every one of them
Suck - everyone of them
Kill - everyone of them
Because Everyone Dies
I will take you
Then will break you
Push you into all that I do
