You talk to me you talk to my eyes
You talk to me while in your disguise
You say the things that I want to hear
You never say it too clear
It doesn't matter because when you leave
You'll think about the ways to deceive
Forget about the things you believe
Remember lies you conceived
Lie - you live a lie
A fucking lie, your life's a lie
Then their are all the promises they make
Devotion and their word is so fake
Ever-changing and inconsistent
True self so distant
Are you really even in there?
Does it matter do you even care?
Ego grown you now believe
But you're the one that's deceived
Lie - you live a lie
A fucking lie, your life's a lie
Liar - Liar -You lie
Nothing matters but for you to cover the lie
Can't explain your reasons so you just have to deny
Think of all the people that now know
that you're full of shit
All the pieces of your life will never fit
Lie to me
Make me see
All that truth
You believe
I was led
Lies were fed
Nothing left
Truth is dead
Lie - you live a lie
A fucking lie, your life's a lie
