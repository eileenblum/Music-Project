Let it in-Let it in-Yes, let it in
Its not a sin so let it in and let's begin
To feel it all without a wall no need to stall
I'll make the call hear me call I'll make the call
Calling to all the ones who want to be re-defined
Fornicate -Fornicate Yes Fornicate
Fornicate -Fornicate Yes Fornicate
And Concentrate -Concentrate -Concentrate
Now Contemplate -Contemplate -Contemplate
All of the things that you can't understand or define
Does it feel? Does it feel? Yes does it feel?
So unreal, how does it feel? When you heal
from the pain of who you are and what you've done
Its just begun, just begun, just begun
There you go you're on your way take it on
Grab a hold, walk the path, Its never done
Farther in, farther in, your so far in
Now lets begin, lets begin, lets begin
To take what we want and take it from all those who lie
Fornicate -Fornicate Yes Fornicate
Fornicate -Fornicate Yes Fornicate
And Concentrate -Concentrate Concentrate
Now Contemplate -Contemplate -Contemplate
All of the things that you can't understand or define
