Darkest dreams
Reflecting views of insanity
Tormenting me
Horror I see and more I bleed
More pain I feel
This sleep will last for eternity
Haunting me
For me there will be no relief

Drowning in deep terror within
Through eyes of lunatic I see
Knowing that this will cause my death
Slowly dying inside my head

Somewhere at endless cemetery
Upon the grave what is open
Last moments before eternity
Writing on stone is my name
Visions of death
