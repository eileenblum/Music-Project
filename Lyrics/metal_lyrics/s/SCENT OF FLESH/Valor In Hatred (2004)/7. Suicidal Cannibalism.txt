Forgive me not
I don't deserve it
I will not ask for it
For what I am
Servant of Darkness
These sins I will pay for

Stains of blood in torn skin
Caused by the lunatic living within
Laughing at the darkness
More it becomes perverted and merciless
Deadly sin in my flesh
Without it there's nothing but emptiness
Damnation so tempting
Soon it is my turn to die suffering

Unspeakable form of sadism
Suicidal Cannibalism

All my victims pray to die
Slowly they get eaten alive
And so will I
Halfeaten I masticate
My own flesh I eat to the death
Slowly I die
