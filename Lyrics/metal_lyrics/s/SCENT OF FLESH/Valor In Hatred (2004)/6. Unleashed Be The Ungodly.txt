Living for mutilation
My birth was desecration
Obsessed to your death
There's no other meaning
In my morbid life
Vile need for killing

Cut their throats
Crush their bones
Pleasures of being your pain
Insane of hate I reign
Through the deep moments of anger
Existence of insanity
I doom to damnation
Bloodstained domination
Obsessing to decapitation

Face the hours of darkness
Restless is hatred deep within
More I become repentless
And unleashed be the ungodly
