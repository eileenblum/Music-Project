Wake up
And feel the flames
Burning your cursed flesh
Embraced by hellfire
Veins full of boiling blood
Wrath of the demongod
Realm of the one who fell
Unearthly darkness
Flaming eternity
Pain beyond anything
Ultimate suffering

Grim afterlife in terror
Sins burn away forever
Worse than nothing can be
Endless insanity

Agony that no one can bear
Everlasting atrocity
Your immortal soul it will tear
Through all years of eternity

The Last Awakening
