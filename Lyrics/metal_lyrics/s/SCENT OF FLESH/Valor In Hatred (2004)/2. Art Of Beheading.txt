And their last day became
And I'm the one to blame
Again there are hundreds
They will all lose their heads
Those who I despise
I kill
Even wars will end
But killing never will
Malicious nature of mankind
Longer grows the line of rotting corpses behind

Prisoners of war
Waiting for decapitation
With a blade I slay the enemy
Sacrifice for my vile domination
Silent are the victims of insanity

Headless rotting bodies
Scavengers circling
None shall live
The art of beheading
