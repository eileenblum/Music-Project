Born of hatred
Creation of darkest lunacy
Flesh of the dead
Blood of those who died in agony
Endless bloodshed
What has been done through eternity
Triumph of death completes
And more darkens my morbid soul

Sacrifice for my needs
Malicious infinity
Circle of dark beliefs
Rise in atrocity

Elder prophecies
Written in flesh of the demigod
Strength in chaos
Eternal rain of the blood
From the veins of innocent
Dark soul rising
From the realm where was never light
End is coming
Among the ones who are waiting for death
You will die

And I shall take a form
As blackhearted berserk
And walk above you all
And watch you when you fall
