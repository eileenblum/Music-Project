Memories that once remembered
Drowned into the sea of madness
No sign's of humanity
Never ending atrocity

I can see the fear in your eyes
Mindless cruelty
Feel the hate deep inside
Growing day by day

Live with the pain what you cannot void
Tearing mind apart
Slashing to pieces your body your soul
You cannot run or hide

Painting pictures to the walls
Birth from horror sight's
Feel's that painting's come alive
Trick of human mind

I am the only one to blame
Because of me someone will die again
It is my way of life to be your pain

Witness
My
Madness
