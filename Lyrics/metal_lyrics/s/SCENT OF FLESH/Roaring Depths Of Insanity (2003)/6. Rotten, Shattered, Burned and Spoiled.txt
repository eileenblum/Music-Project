Like a fire
from the depths of underworld
I shall rise between life and death
I march with my hordes, my servants from deep
to world beyond with those who no more breath
Unleash our wrath, in blood they shall drown
even my death can not slow me down

Hunger of the beast
Smell of blood fills empty mind
Rotten, shattered, burned and spoiled
Sadistic pleasures
In me they grow and darken my soul
Predator?s sight, eyes once so bright
Projecting only darkness
and see new Era
Enormous are piles of corpses
They?re been dismembered
Their flesh putrifies
and still they are alive

Devastation
No mercy for the damned
Victims of mortification
Soon they shall get slayed
Scavengers
Fly upon the horrorfields
Piles of bones and rotting flesh
My unborn servants feast
Behold world as it becomes desert

Eternal pain and darkness
No hope to be released
Endless are days of torment
Forever they suffer deceased
