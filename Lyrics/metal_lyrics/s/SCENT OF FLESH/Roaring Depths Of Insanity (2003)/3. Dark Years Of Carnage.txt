Behold with me
New tragic dawn
Another day of bloodshed
Once again on the bloodstained earth
Slayers we are, merciless
Rule with the force, eternal war
Tools of the pain, deep to your flesh

Thousands are they
Like lambs to the slaughter
Flesh ripping, bones crushing
Blood floods the field we stand
Throats open, heads falling
Make them bleed, make them cry
Let they suffer before they die
Make them die

These years are gone
For new years to come
Dark years of carnage

Through the times, through the wars, vicious hordes
Seek for blood in thousand battlefields
Demonized, wrath within
Ride into another massacre
Genocide, lunacy
Impure we stride
Through the times, through wars, seek for blood
Dishonoured destructors, messengers of the death
