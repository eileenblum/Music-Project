Pool of blood reflects my image
I see my face and hatred in it
Deep inside me I fear what I am
Wrath in my mind keeps me killing again

Kill for insane pervertion
Reign in violent perfection
Embrace damnation

Mindless I cause your death
With a smile I cut off your head
And see your blood on walls
It's your name what death calls

Anger that can be never beared
Dominates in atrocity
Unleashed superiority
Instrument of devastation
Obsessed to slaughter

Come to me
More souls to be released
And darkness grows stronger in me
Laughing I wash myself in blood
And darkness shall rise from me
