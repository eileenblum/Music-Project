Profound is the pain from which is born deliverance
Long is the path which leads to the light
And you march alone ...
Wash your hands in the blood
Of the lamb
Lick your wound
Learn to love your punishment
This stern eye you fear
This condemning finger pointed at you
Make them both part of your self
Make one out of two
And remember
Regret is a worm born from your jealousy
Someone lives on in the depths of your heart
Fight your deepest feelings
Deny your own existence
It never heals, it never heals
Opposing darkness to obscurity
Doesn't lead anywhere
Shine if you want to be
Profound is the pain from which is born deliverance
Long is the path which leads to the light ...
