So it's now the moment
We were all waiting for
So that is the reason
We're all gathered here
All those years looking at the sky
For a sign
All those eyes gleaming in the night
To lead the way
Remember the gate you got in
Do not forget the place you came from
Soul's migration
To the land of milk and honey
Trust your visions
Exodus
Exit - the world
Enter - the desert
Don't look back to your burning house
Don't need it anymore
'cause we're going home
Mercury flows around the desert sand
As astral blood runs into God's veins
Remember the gate you got in
Do not
forget the place you came from
Exodus
Exit - the world
Enter - the desert
Don't look back to your burning house
Don't need it anymore
'cause we're going home
Mercury flows around the desert sand
As astral blood runs into God's veins
