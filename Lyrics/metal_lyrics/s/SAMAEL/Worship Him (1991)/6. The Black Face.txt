The day the sun will lose its brightness
The day the earth has spat out all its innards
The day the rivers and streams have inundated our cities
The day the life itself will be the worst of all punishments

The earth will shake
The earth will burn
The skies will rumble
The moon will turn

We'll discover his secret side
We'll worship the black face
Egoistic people will pray to their bored gods
Ecstatic crowds will break into the hymns of the black moon

Everyone will be judged

Everybody will be punished
Only the children of the rebellious angel will be saved
While the worshippers of the stinking pig
Victims of ignorance and naivity
Will remain prisoners of the carnal form
And forever rot in that cursed pit
That has become of earth
