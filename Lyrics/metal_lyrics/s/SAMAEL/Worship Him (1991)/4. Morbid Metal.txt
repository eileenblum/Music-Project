Born from the depth of my brain
Born in the night of the times
Born by the nothingness

Born by bloody massacres
Born by massive executions
Born by millions of deaths

Ancestral prediction
Medieval prophecy
Secular institution

In eternal blasphemy
Morbid metal

Born by malefic oaths
Born by secret conspirations
Born by infame rituals

Morbid metal
