The golden age of the sorcery has passed
The necromancers' cloud of darkness
Hangs over the ancient kingdom
Only some cursed book can allow you
To find your lost powers again
And to join with the powerful force of death
So install you inside the magic circle and implore

Belf, son of Belf,
Who's got brass feet, iron heel
Belf, son of Belf,
Give me the power to kill at distance

Accept all orders orders of your superiors
Obey them fool
Raise all their vows and then realize yours
Then you will be invulnerable
Ignorant souls
Realize your morbid wishes

Belf, son of Belf,
Who's got brass feet, iron heel
Belf, son of Belf,

Give me the power to kill at distance

Your brain's on fire
Fulfill a crime you must
Hecat watches over the accomplishment of the crime
Trust him 'cause no law
Can transgress ten thousand years
Of knowledge kept by the sorcerers

Belf, son of Belf,
Who's got brass feet, iron heel
Belf, son of Belf,
Give me the power to kill at distance
