I am the envoy of the son of the dawn
A slave to the star of the morning
I am here to prepare the coming of our lord
To overthrow the thesis of Metatron
To contradict the resurrection of pig
See the ones that will rise - will die
And I'll torment their souls
Beyond the Styx and Acheron
Beyond the kingdom of Hades
I am the envoy of the son of the dawn
A slave to the star of the morning
See in me our ideal
See in me our new god
