He is life, He is death
He is virtue, He is vire

He is the flame of reason
He is the verbe of our thoughts

He is the justice of our trials
He is the gallows of the infidels

He is the fire of vengeance
He is the blade of revenge

He is the executioner's axe
He is the hangman's rope

He is the fall of the kingdom of ignorance
He is the end of the reign of intolerance

He is the torch of our hope
He is the reason of our existence
