Man!
Inexorably you come to me
Each instant you're closer to me
I am death
Do you know where I'll lead you?
Are you sure
That your life will go on endlessly...
Endlessly?

Into misfortune
Into eternal pain

Man!
You're condemned to die
You're condemned to join me
And this certainty haunts you from your birth on
Me, your death, I tell you
Man, you cannot withstand
Man, you're trapped
Man, you must choose
You've chosen
I'll lead you
Close to the lord of the dark powers

No rest

No end
No shelter

No escape
No respite
No sleep

No dreams... eternally...
