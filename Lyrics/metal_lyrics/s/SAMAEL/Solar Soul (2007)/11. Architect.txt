[Bonus Track]

Designing the plan that will be read and explained before anyone undertakes anything
Knowing how to work with volumes and lightning, with force and resistance
Re-arranging the foundation, transforming the construction
Outside the frame another frame
As waves modulate till the end
A sound, a light
Visions building their own means
Meanwhile they construct their own road
A will, a way
Calculating the distances, estimating the length
Predicting difficulties and providing facilities yeah
To capture a concept in a few strokes
To outline the project with a few words
Materialization of thought, pursuit of ideas
Understanding of space, unity of the whole
Designing the plan that will be read and explained before anyone undertakes anything
Outside the frame another frame
As waves modulate till the end
A sound, a light
Visions building their own means
Meanwhile they construct their own road
A will, a way
Knowing how to work with volumes and lightning, with force and resistance
Outside the frame another frame
As waves modulate till the end
A sound, a light
Visions building their own means
Meanwhile they construct their own road
A will, a way
