Starting at the right place, the right time
Growing strong, growing high
Piercing through the roof and standing a new ground
Growing strong, growing high
Crowned and enthroned making history
Rising above honour and victory
Pushing the top way higher
The horizon gets wider
Living a whole life every single day
Walking on golden way

Starting at the right place,the right time
Growing strong,growing high
Crowned and enthroned making history
Rising above honour and victory
Pushing the top way higher
The horizon gets wider
Living a whole life every single day
Walking on golden way

Pushing the top way higher
Pushing the top way higher
Pushing the top way higher
Pushing the top way higher
