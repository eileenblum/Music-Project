Traveling at the speed of light
shining bright out of the darkest night
a chain of events meshed in a present
surfing on the waves
echoing the past
what traveled for ages
will be read at last

I guess something in me knew more than I could understand
maybe all that I waited for was waiting for me

Everything that I wish
is a wish from above
pulling the strings
controlling the path
the vibrations
and variations

Magic is the moment where you are what you wanted to be
surrounded by all those and all that you were dreaming of

Hey! hey! hey!
Now one with the force
that is governing life
Hey! hey! hey!
In love with the world
and full of energy (x2)

Everything that I wish
is a wish from above

Hey! hey! hey!
Now one with the force
that is governing life
Hey! hey! hey!
In love with the world
and full of energy [x2]
