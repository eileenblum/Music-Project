On the rise, galvanized
on the way to the top every day that we drop
is a seed that we plant for the life that we want
it'll grow on our backs to keep us on the track
for if we wanna shine, we will need discipline
we're eager to learn and ready for our turn

Above the sky at the top of the world
close than we ever thought we could be
higher and higher heart filled with desire
perfect self-control with a sword as a soul

On the rise! With spirit of conquest
on the rise! On our way to be the best

On the rise, energized
breathing in gradually and rising to the source
breathing out steadily and capturing the force
Unified, electrified
ruling over nature of mankind
by having constancy and real peace of mind

Above the sky at the top of the world
closer than we ever thought we could be
beyond our most daring dreams
further than we ever thought we could go

Higher and higher heart filled with desire
perfect self-control with a sword as a soul
faster and faster, will sharp as a sabre
cutting through anything that's standing in our way

On the rise! With spirit of conquest
on the rise! On our way to be the best

Wider and wider filled up with power

On the rise! With spirit of conquest
on the rise! on our way to be the best

On the rise! With spirit of conquest
on the rise! On our way to be the best
