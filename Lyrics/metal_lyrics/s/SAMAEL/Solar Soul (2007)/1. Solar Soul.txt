Go if you want to know
what's behind those hills
Run if you want to catch
what's waiting there for you
Walk through another door
...on another floor
Learn how to get across
if you want to come through

Look for the missing link
between your dreams
and reality
find it, it is the key

Push aside yesterday
push aside tomorrow
the only time is now
what we got is today

One nation-generation
Connecting people in a collective mind

Emergence - Renaissance
The world is in your hands donât let it slip away

Ask and you're gonna get
wait and you'll see
lives more than we think
and way more than they say
yes we do believe
there's no ending to
what we've started once
it will go on and on

Team up with the best
trust in providence
...it will favour
your undertakings

Push aside yesterday
push aside tomorrow
the only time is now
what we got is today

One nation-generation
Connecting people in a collective mind

Emergence - Renaissance
the world is in your hands donât let it slip away
