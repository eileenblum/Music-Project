Silent screams sucking space out of a desert place
armies of wingless angels come crashing down
god's firework may entertain one side of his race
but surely those who die are, too, sons of his own

Bravery turns to slavery
war is the queen of inversion
lion's heart to hyena's horde
eagle's pride to vulture's prey

A blast lifts you in the air
enter the Valkyrie's new ride
thunder and lightning across your sky
now join the Valkyrie's new ride...ride!

It takes more than a shout for a tyrant to get down
face on the ground, dragged through the mud
he's still haunting the heart of Babylon

Bravery turns to slavery
war is the queen of inversion
lion's heart to hyena's horde
eagle's pride to vulture's prey

A blast lifts you in the air
enter the Valkyrie's new ride
thunder and lightning across your sky
now join the Valkyrie's new ride...ride!...fly high!

Action not reflection
questioning ain't obeying
questioning ain't obeying

a blast lifts you in the air
enter the Valkyrie's new ride
thunder and lightning across your sky
now join the Valkyrie's new ride...ride!...fly high!...ad infinitum!
