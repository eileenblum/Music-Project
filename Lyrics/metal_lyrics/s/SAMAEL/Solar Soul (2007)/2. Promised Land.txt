Opening the circle avoiding the loop
linking patterns in a single group
expending our lives further than this world
widening our views, focusing our thoughts

Weightlessness of an unlocked mind
gliding above the world of thoughts
bypassing second-hand visions
aiming at the core of existence
ascertaining horizons
summarizing abstractions
constructing new foundations
with freshly found explanations

The quest is never-ending
but you keep on growing
paradise is at hand
you're born in, you're born with
but still searching for it
in your head is the promised land

Reaching greatness mirrored inside what's left unpeeled
extending knowledge to frontiers of understanding
converting doubt and hate into love and faith
ascending from within, accessing our realm

The quest is never-ending
but you keep on growing
paradise is at hand
you're born in, you're born with
but still searching for it
in your head is the promised land

Converting doubt and hate into love and faith

The quest is never-ending
but you keep on growing
paradise is at hand
you're born in, you're born with
but still searching for it
in your head is the promised land
