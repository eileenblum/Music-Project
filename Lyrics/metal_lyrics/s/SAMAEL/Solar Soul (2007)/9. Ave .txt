Paramount to every new start,
past is the fuel we'll burn to go on
fire in the head and peace in the heart
cores of our souls are ready to take on

Ave! Gloria! With you all around the world
Ave! Fortuna! The gold is calling for gold

On...yeah! On an ever rising goal...
reinforcing our plan multiplying the links
self-improvement, sempiternal growth
money's magnet diamonds and platinum
paving our roads and cementing the chinks

Tantamount to the art of climbing,
life is a trek that takes us higher
Panoramic view of understanding
Coalescence of spirit and matter

Ave! Gloria! With you all around the world
Ave! Fortuna! The gold is calling for gold

Isn't more a bit less on a different scale
add a step to the top and the top you've known
will come the bottom of a brand new stair
now marching on...yeah!

On...yeah! on an ever rising goal...
reinforcing our plan multiplying the links
self-improvement, sempiternal growth
money's magnet diamonds and platinum
paving our roads and cementing the chinks
