Not embedded in stone but engraved in our hearts
not written in a book but alive in our souls
behind the veil of life, beyond the look of eyes
fragmented in light but united in us

Alliance, alliance

Been around the world searching for something new
but much of what we've learned we already knew
in every country, in every city
the responsibility of our hegemony

Alliance - A contract of brotherhood
Alliance - An ark of flesh and blood

Wherever you go, wherever you stand
we'll never be apart, you'll never be alone
always by your side 'till the sun will be gone

Been around the world searching for something new
but much of what we've learned we already knew
in every spring, in every morning
you'll find the seed of upcoming glories

Wherever you go, wherever you stand
we'll never be apart, you'll never be alone
always by your side 'till the sun will be gone

Alliance - A contract of brotherhood
Alliance - An ark of flesh and blood
