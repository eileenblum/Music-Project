While so many will have to pay,
for just one man to stand his way,
we're something no one denies.
Primacy of one over others.

Is there nothing else 'cept consciousness?
We never want to make him real.
Haven't we all inside of us?
What makes a man what they won?

I wish that I could take you by the hand.
Lead you through blurry views
and give you access to your own self.

Between a seizure and nothing,
there are plenty of ways to be.
Life is full of differences
and so should be society.

Hope is a fuel we get for free.
Life, it demands security.
So why are those two always used
as if they were power tools?

I wish that I could take you by the hand.
Lead you through blurry views
and give you access to your own self.

Sleeping with eyes wide open,
while someone else is getting in charge.
To lead the way
in his own way.

I wish that I could take you by the hand.
Lead you through blurry views
and give you access to your own self.

I wish that I could take you by the hand.
Lead you through blurry views
and give you access to your own self.
