A moment in time independent from the rest
a platform disconnected from formal ground
a life inside the life inconsequential but real
a parallel universe optional to this one

Wondering who can tell the truth
too far to one side takes you to the other side
I can tell you 'bout my own truth
too far one way takes you the other way

And I slip inside
a world in stand-by while life goes on
stop is a start in suspended time
whatever has been left behind
keep on feeding the suspended time

A possibility explored but not developed
a visited fantasy excluded from history
a personal snapshot or a private play
an alternative nest of living memory

Wondering who can tell the truth
too far to one side takes you to the other side
I can tell you 'bout my own truth
too far one way takes you the other way

And I slip inside
a world in stand-by while life goes on
stop is a start in suspended time
whatever has been left behind
keep on feeding the suspended time

A hyphen between you and I
between here and there
between in and out
between up and down

A world in stand-by while life goes on
stop is a start in suspended time
whatever has been left behind
keep on feeding the suspended time
