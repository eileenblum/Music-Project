September's sun welcomes you home
you've followed the road leading to new Rome
sky is open wide like father's arms
ship's sinking in your mother's tears

Dreaming of fortune as many before
having it all planned in the back of your mind
ready for some change, taking the challenge
of making today the steps of tomorrow

Ever rising hope's catching all the souls
taking them away on a trip far from home
in a big city, in a foreign land
learning life again
walking on the western ground

Souvenirs have their own language
distances aren't what they seem

When you're on your own you're never alone
phantoms of the past are still haunting the place
luck and success are paving the way
engaged in that path there's no turning back

Ever rising hope's catching all the souls
taking them away on a trip far from home
in a big city, in a foreign land
learning life again
walking on the western ground
