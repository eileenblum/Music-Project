I TOOK A LONG TRIP
AND NOW BACK AGAIN
TO THE POINT WHERE I BEGAN
AND EVERYTHING I LEFT BEHIND
FOLLOWED ME, PRECEDED ME
SOUVENIRS ARE PATIENT, THEY ONLY KNOW
THE LASSITUDE THEY PROVIDE

FEEDING THE VOID WITH EMPTINESS
IT TOOK ME TIME TO UNDERSTAND
IT WAS ALWAYS HERE, DEEP INSIDE
ALWAYS THERE, FAR AWAY
THE SHINING KINGDOM

I TOOK A LONG TRIP TO LEAVE MYSELF
TO SEARCH FOR ANOTHER ME ELSEWHERE
I HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING
I JUST FORGOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR
I DID FORGET WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR
I'VE BEEN LOST

FEEDING THE VOID WITH EMPTINESS
IT TOOK ME TIME TO UNDERSTAND
IT WAS ALWAYS HERE, DEEP INSIDE
ALWAYS THERE, FAR AWAY
THE SHINING KINGDOM
