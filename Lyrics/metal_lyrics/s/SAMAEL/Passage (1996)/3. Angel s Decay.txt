YOU KNOW MY FRIEND
I'VE BEEN WALKING ON A REALLY STRANGE PATH LATELY
I'M SO GLAD YOU WERE NOT THERE
TO SEE MY FALL, TO SEE ME PASSNING ON
MY WOUND SO DEEP
MY VEINS OPEN WIDE
LETTING FLOW MY DISTRESS
LETTING FLOW MY REQUESTS
LISTEN MY FRIEND
AS NO ONE WANTED TO HEAR I'M TELLING YOU NOW
SO WEAK WAS MY HOPE
SO COLD THE WORLD AROUND
SO STRONG THE CALLS
MY PAIN INVITED ECHOES TO MY PAIN ANGUISH
COILED IN THE GUT LIKE A STARVING WORM
FALLEN, BETWEEN...
I SLIDE DOWN THE HOLE AT THE CENTER OF MY SOUL
I'VE GIVEN UP, I'VE GIVEN UP, LARVAE ROTS
FOR I LET THE ANGEL RISE...
