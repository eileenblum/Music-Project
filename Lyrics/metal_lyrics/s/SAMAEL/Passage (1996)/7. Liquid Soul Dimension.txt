FAR FROM MY KINGDOM
GOLDEN DREAMS, TRANQUIL PEACE
FAR FROM ME, PORNOGRAPHIC SMILES
FAR IS YOUR WORLD
LOST IN A SEA OF NOTHINGNESS
A PASSED UTOPIA, A BANISHED LIE
LAND, OF INFINITE SPACES
SUNS, OF INTERIOR LIGHTS
DANCES OF THE ABSURD AND THE REAL
LIQUID SOUL DIMENSION
THE FORCE IS AROUND AND THE FORCE IS INSIDE
I SWALLOW THE LIGHT AND THE LIGHT SWALLOWS ME
I DON'T EXIST ANYMORE BUT I FEEL AS I AM
BUT I FEEL AS I AM...
FAR INTO THE INNER UNIVERSE
DETACHED, FREE AND SUBMISSIVE
FROM UP ON MY THRONE
I COMMAND, I OBEY
