THROUGH AGES, THROUGH HISTORY
THROUGH CIVILIZATIONS, THROUGH SOCIETIES
TAKING MAN AS A HOUSE
WE'VE TRAVELED A LONG LONG WAY TO BE HERE NOW
BACK THEN, WE LEFT OUR VIRTUAL LAND
TO COME DOWN ON THE ELECTRIC FIELD
OF CHOSEN HUMAN MINDS
WHERE WE UNITE FOR BEST OR THE WORST
WE'RE THE ONES WHO CAME BEFORE
AND THE ONE YOU KNEEL BEFORE
FOR WE'RE THOSE WHO ARE NO MORE
WE CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD
AS WE ARE UNDERSTANDING
GUIDED BY THE WIND, WE COME TO YOUR PLACE
READING YOUR WISHES AND HIDDEN DESIRES
DRESSING YOUR DREAMS OF COLORS AND SOUNDS
BEWARE OF YOURSELF, 'CAUSE YOU'LL GET WHAT YOU WANT
WE'RE THE ONES WHO CAME BEFORE
AND THE ONE YOU KNEEL BEFORE
FOR WE'RE THOSE WHO ARE NO MORE
