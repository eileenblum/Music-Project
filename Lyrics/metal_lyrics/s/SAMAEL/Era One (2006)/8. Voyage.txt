On the road, in the air
Across the sea, across the land
Going
Everywhere, meeting everyone
Around the globe, around your head
Across
Your soul, all through your brain
Meeting everyone, going everywhere...

Blessed are the travelers, those who belong nowhere...
On the road again

Traveling further than my thoughts can go...
On the road again
Searching,
Finding
Forgetting, remembering
How it goes...
Different cultures,
Different traditions
Different languages, different approaches
Of the
World...
World within our eyes, confronted by the outside...
On the road
Again
Far - of destination, constant vacation...
On the road again

Searching, finding
Forgetting, remembering
How it goes...
Introspective
Trip
Initiative voyages
All along...
On the road, in the air
Across the
Sea, across the land
Going everywhere, meeting everyone
Around the globe,
Around your head
Across your soul, all through your brain
Meeting
Everyone, going everywhere...
