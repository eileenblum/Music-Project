No limits
Landing in the air
Traveling upstairs
Staying on the surface

Living on my own trace
Paint the night with fluo rays
Give the colours
Of our days
Feel the beat's rhythmic sound
Hear the music to which we're
Bound
The move of your mouth
Speak the language of my will
Rope formed
By the notes sealing the dance of our sex
Pictures flashing in our minds

There we search and here we find
And we glow and we shine
We feel good,
We feel fine...
