Underneath the world built by reason
Lay the foundations of a different
Perception
Putting light on a brand new horizon
Remodeling our own
Life's conception
Opening views of another dimension
Revealing a home of
Outstanding proportions
Radiating from one's own reflection
Energy's
Nucleus height density concentration
Feeling incomplete before the meeting

While the rest of me wants to gather

Sociability, sensibility
Clear out charm of world illusions

Philanthropy to felicity, so why can't we live with one another
Dissolved,
Diluted, restored and regrouped
Waiting for crystallization
Reunion of
Different principles
Leading to cohesion and different conclusions
Fundamental
And perennial
The law of movement intersideral
One small
Step, one giant step,
Independent and connected
Thought-
Omnipotence giving the access
To your own soul, to other galaxies
At
Your own depth, reality
Subject to hazard
Susceptibility
Emotionally, physically
Bound and tied

Understanding before standing
Always digging your views a
Little deeper
Vision and dream accorded with one another

Giving an answer to all you wonder
Sun on your soul is significant to your
Own environment
See through the night
With an open mind
Catch up whit the light, your way you'll find
Feeling
Incomplete before the meeting
While the rest of me wants to gather

Sociability, sensibility
Clear out charm of world illusions
Philanthropy
To felicity, so why can't we live with one another
Dissolved, diluted,
Restored and regrouped
Waiting for crystallization
Reunion of different
Principles leading to cohesion and different conclusions
