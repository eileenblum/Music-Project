Diamonds drops covering your breasts
Diamonds drop covering your sex

Rain to river, sparkling matter
Flowing, falling
Rain to river, always
Richer
Holding, expanding
Moving on, dancing 'round
Carried by the
Wind of change

In the cadence of romace bringing you another chance

Moving on, dancing 'round
Carried by the wind of change

On and on life goes on, 'till somebody new will come...
