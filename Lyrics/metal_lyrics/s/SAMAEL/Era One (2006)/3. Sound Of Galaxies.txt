The sound of galaxies playing the music of our lives
The notes we strike
Reasoned in time and space
Silent symphony waiting to be heard
Musical
Aura holding unseen worlds...

The sound of galaxies playing the music of our lives
The numbers we
Married, equations formulas
A mute language of the universe
Mathematical
Resonance the thought of matter...
