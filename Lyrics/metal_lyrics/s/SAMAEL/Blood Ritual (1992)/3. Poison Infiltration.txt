[To Catherine Deshayes (La Voisine)]

Slow and painful death
Subtle and dangerous attack
- Brook of scorn
- Stream of anger
- River of hate

Poison infiltrate society

Rich and poor
Noblemen and beggars
Everyone has the key

Personal vengeance or
Crime of passion
Cyanide remain eternal

Mixture prepared in sombre conspirations
Everywhere it slips poison sows confusion

Neither the wheel, nor stake
Can stop his ravages
Neither the wheel, nor stake
Will calm people's hate

Vicious and intelligent death
Certain and long degradation

Poison infiltrate society

Execrable beverage or refined wine
No matter the administered dose
Nobody can be immunized
