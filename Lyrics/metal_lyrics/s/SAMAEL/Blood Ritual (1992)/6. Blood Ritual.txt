Life, where suffering is the only satisfaction
Sadness of my nights without sleep
Anguish to be alone against all

Ritual of blood, where a human being
Gives his life for mine
Spills his blood for mine

Now I will be them and they will be mine
And we'll be one above your god

Blood ritual / Purification by the blood
Blood ritual / Total consecration

My spirit has dived into the infernal storm of evil
My soul is forever tormented
Take advantage of this jouvencal fluid
Deliver your soul from claws of ignorance

- Death is the only way to escape the misery of life
- Death is the only way to reach the supreme power

The caress of he blade on his skin
Is waking up my old cruel dreams

Look the so coveted liquid going out of his body
Look the sacred fluid spilling out of his wounds

Let your mind be impregnated
By this mad attraction
