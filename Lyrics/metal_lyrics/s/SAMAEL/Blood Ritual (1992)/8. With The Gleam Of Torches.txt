[the priest:]

- Everything's ready
- Go and get me fresh meat
- We're thirsty for sacred beverage
- Hurry up! I can't wait anymore

[the assembly:]

- Here she is the promised virgin!

[narration:]

Her nude body plays with the unstable shadows
Her long hair hides half her breasts, she rises her head
Her eyes are shining with the gleam of the torches

[the priest:]

- Look deep in my eyes, you little bitch
- Look at your death, she smiles at you

[priest reflection:]

Death opens her arms to you
You tremble and your body is wet
You haven't to be scared, you'll be saved
You'll suffer, you'll die, you'll be free

[the priest:]

I wish to hear her weep
I wish to hear her cry
I wish to hear her yell
Of disgust... of fear... of pain

[the priest with the crowd:]

We gonna take care of you...
