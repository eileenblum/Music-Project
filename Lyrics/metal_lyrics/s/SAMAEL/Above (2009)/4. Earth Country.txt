Earth country, earth country
All families listen to the elders
To learn what the eldest knows
Gathering information from the past
To recognize the future when it will come
Keeping their secret as a piece of their God's dream
A puzzling universe split through different minds
Collecting thoughts that has never been thought before
Mixing colors and race, for the great picture to be seen
Sowing the seed in everyone, for the seed to become a tree
For the tree to become wood, for that wood to be the land of our earth country
Too strong to fail, even through time of disgrace
Standing proud in the mess of all the afters
Sowing the seed in everyone, for the seed to become a tree
For the tree to become wood, for that wood to be the land of our earth country
Rise...rise
My people rise! Rise! Rise!
My people March! March! March!
My people March...
Earth country, earth country
All families listen to the elders
To learn what the eldest knows
Gathering information from the past
To recognize the future when it will come
Sowing the seed in everyone, for the seed to become a tree
For the tree to become wood, for that wood to be the land of our earth country
