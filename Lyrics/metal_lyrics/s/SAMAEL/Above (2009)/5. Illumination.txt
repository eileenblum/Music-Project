Imagination cannot be stop
Faster than the light we reach the top
Coordination of thought and will
Give us visions that we can almost feel
We can speculate on any conclusion
Leading our emotions to any destination
Can explorate from every sensation
A world is to be found through transformation
Just like a dream...stronger...stranger
Just like a dream...the strangest and strongest dream
Illumination at the end of the tunnel
Revealed a world behind every hell
It's sometime worth staying on your way
Keeping the faith strong and straight 'till the next day
Just like a dream...stronger...stranger
Just like a dream...the strangest and strongest dream
Dream...keep dreaming...dream...
Imagination cannot be stop
Faster than the light we reach the top
Coordination of thought and will
Give us visions that we can almost feel
Imagination will lead us to the top
It goes slow motion but never stops
Coordination of thought and will
Give us visions that we can almost feel
