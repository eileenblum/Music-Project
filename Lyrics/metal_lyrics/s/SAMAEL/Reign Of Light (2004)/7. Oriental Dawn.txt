On the roof of one thought
On the edge of one world
Smell the flavor of glory
Infused in people's hearts
Certified and glorified
Pushed to a higher high
Crossing desert in a second
With a single breath

Surrounded by the Nation - Demonized
Against domination - Struggling, creating, modeling another world
Courage and obedience - Sanctified
Theatracalization - Of the past, of life, of pain that never lasts...

The taste of earth and blood
Stir up the thirst of life
In the chaos of the masses
Lost in Nemesis
At the call of better times
That have been once promised
Respond to a better life
Of happiness and joy...

Surrounded by the Nation - Demonized
Against domination - Struggling, creating, modeling another world
Courage and obedience - Sanctified
Theatracalization - Of the past, of life, of pain that never lasts...

Surrounded by the Nation - Demonized
