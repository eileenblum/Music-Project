While our souls fly high above
Our bodies play their favorite games
We climb, we climb towards the light
Crawling on each other's skin
Crawling on each other's skin
We're reaching out to a higher ground
We're heading for a higher height
Down, down, down, yeah
I'm gonna take you higher baby
While our souls fly high above
Time's getting diluted
We feel at one with everything
We're alive
And we're crawling on each other's skin
The atmosphere is electrified
Our vibrations make it all so real
Cosmic pulses getting louder
Our hearts are beating harder
As I move, I move inside of you
We feel at one with everything
Rhythmic lightnings of our storm
Smooth, smooth I dance you deep
Arise your tears to grow our dreams
Far, far from here we go
To places we've never been, places we've never seen
We are one with everything
We're alive
We're reaching out to a higher ground
We're reaching for a higher height
Down, down, down yeah
I'm gonna take you higher baby
While our souls fly high above
Hearts speak aloud secrets never told
While our souls fly high above
Down here silent is the loudest scream
We move away to where we meet
Embrace the space that waits for time
Believe in us in you and me
Cross the line of what is known
We're one with everything
We're alive...
