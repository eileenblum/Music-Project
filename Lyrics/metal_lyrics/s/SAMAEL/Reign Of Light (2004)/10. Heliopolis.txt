Sometimes it's all within your very heart and soul
Reaching the universe known and unknown
Penetrating mysteries well hidden to the world
Delivering secrecies of sacred ecstacy
If you believe in your dreams it gives you the power
To transcend realities which are not of your own
Recalling what you where projecting what you'll be
Looking at the picture of your next step in life
Feel alive, feel so real
Feel like I'm born again
Ruling over my dreams
Exulting, entering
The world of miracles
Doors are open, bright days are calling
The better of the best has to be different
Each angle of your view presents a new horizon
Staring at where you go, not looking where you are
A symptom of vertigo says you're gonna go far
Feel alive, feel so real
Feel like I'm born again
Ruling over my dreams
Exulting, entering
The world of miracles
Doors are open, bright days are calling
Pleasure and delight extended in souvenirs
Searching and hunting lights of upcoming voyages
Osmosis and rapture emphasized in actions
Settling foundations of an ever-changing life
A simple expression of the force in control
Self-realization by melting differences
Encrypted messages that one reads in others
That all things at all times aspire to be justified
Feel alive, feel so real
Feel like I'm born again
Ruling over my dreams
Exulting, entering
The world of miracles
Doors are open, bright days are calling
Feel alive, feel so real
Feel like I'm born again
Ruling over my dreams
Exulting, entering
The world of miracles
Doors are open, bright days are calling
