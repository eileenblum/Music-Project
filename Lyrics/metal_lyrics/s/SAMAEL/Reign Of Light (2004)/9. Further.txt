Further on a long distant flight
Faster to a dream out of sight
I follow my prayer to the target of your heart
Your picture is in my mind and your mind is on my side

Further I am on my way
The sky is brighter, the stars are closer
My empire is made of fire
With desire, I'm burning away...

My speech is flowing, my thoughts crystal clear
The nadir of the real, the zenith of one dream
The universe recreated at the heart of my heart
A vision is revealed on the scree of my mind

Further I am on my way
The sky is brighter, the stars are closer
My empire is made of fire
With desire, I'm burning away...

Further on a long distant flight
Faster to a dream out of sight

We strip down our souls to see the beauty of our all
No end to an end but a start to a brand new start...

Further I am on my way
The sky is brighter, the stars are closer
My empire is made of fire
With desire, I'm burning away...
