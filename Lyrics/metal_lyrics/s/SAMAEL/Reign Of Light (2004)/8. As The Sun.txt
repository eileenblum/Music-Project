Focus on, optimize
Rearrange, reorganize
Define new borderline
See how bright, bright you can shine

Enlarge your horizon
Be your own weapon
Visualize your variations
Harmonize your vibrations
Expansion, concentration
Energy fluctuation
Extension, regeneration
Energetic pulsation
Travel in time/space
Meet your wonder face to face
Put the false in disgrace
And the truth will take its place

Fill your world with energy - Harmony and synergy
Fill your world with energy - Harmony and synergy

Explode formatted thoughts
Change references
Explore differences
Can be this, can be that, even can be both
Feel the heat all around when you hit it on and on
The dispatched universe that collapsed in your own
Feel the heat all around when you hit it on and on
The dispatched universe that collapsed in your own

Fill your world with energy - Harmony and synergy
Fill your world with energy - Harmony and synergy

Solemnly I arise
In a world that is mine
Radiantly I embrace
All the days of my life
Solemnly I arise
In a world that is mine
Radiantly I embrace
All the days of my life

Fill your world with energy - Harmony and synergy
Fill your world with energy - Harmony and synergy

Focus on, optimize
Rearrange, reorganize
Define new borderline
See how bright, bright you can shine
