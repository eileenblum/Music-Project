Sing the same song along the way
Keep focused throughout the day
Take a ride on your mantra
From your life, have an overall view
Simultaneously here and there
Be prepared for what is new
Put a light on a new world
Deep rooted in the past
Link your current thoughts
With the basis of your Dogma

On and on we keep growing inside
Hopefully for a long, long time
Side by side hope and remorse
Lead us to our realm Inch'Allah

Philosophically negentropic
Religiously entropic
The shelter of one thought is a jail for the mind
The shelter of one thought is a jail for the mind
Be aware of what you need
Be a temple of your own...

On and on we keep growing inside
Hopefully for a long, long time
Side by side hope and remorse
Lead us to our realm Inch'Allah

Put a light on a new world
Deep rooted in the past
Link your current thoughts
With the basis of your Dogma

On and on we keep growing inside
Hopefully for a long, long time
Side by side hope and remorse
Lead us to our realm Inch'Allah
