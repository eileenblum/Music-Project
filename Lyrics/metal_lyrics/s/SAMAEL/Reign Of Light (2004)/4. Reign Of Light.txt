Back on track
Hungry for life again
Strong in will
Built out of life and force
Trained and willing
Ready to take the world
And make it our own
Alive and kicking
Fighting for what we once dreamed
Having no doubt 'bout what's coming
Feeling mature and dead real
At every crossing a new thrill

Shout it loud and proud
I'm the hyper star
Shining on your life
Keeping you from falling
Back to your own start
World is at your door
What are you waiting for
Yesterday at your back
Now take a step forward
You're your own way

Keep rolling
Don't ever let yourself drown
Keep the good vibe going
You'll never miss a thing
You're in
Come on and rise...
Free your soul
Catch the dream
Where we all shine...
Stand as you are
And let it begin
The reign of light

Free and young
Happy to be what you believe
To be is the way to be happy
More money, more lovers...
Spiritual vacuum
Takes satisfaction away
Leaving you with bitterness
To get what you want
Without having the fun of it

Keep rolling
Don't ever let yourself drown
Keep the good vibe going
You'll never miss a thing
You're in
Come on and rise...
Free your soul
Catch the dream
Where we all shine...
Stand as you are
And let it begin
The reign of light

Shout it loud and proud
I'm the hyper star
Shining on your life
Keeping you from falling
Back to your own start

Keep rolling
Don't ever let yourself drown
Keep the good vibe going
You'll never miss a thing
You're in
Come on and rise...
Free your soul
Catch the dream
Where we all shine...
Stand as you are
And let it begin
The reign of light
