The truth behind the truth, is the monster we abhor
The light behind the lightâ¦ is black

Black march, black crowd, black tide
Black sun, black light, black matter
Black square, black cross, black soul

Through all the shades of grey
Black is the new white
It is the time, it is the day of
Black supremacy

We create now our future past
When we look back, black history
It started slow, it's coming fast
Black supremacy

All colors resumed
All colors consumed
Un-colorful - all powerful

Black ink, black paint, black skin
Black moon, black sky, black hole,
Black candle, black magic, black power

Through all the shades of grey
Black is the new white
It is the time, it is the day of
Black supremacy

We create now our future past
When we look back, black history
It started slow, it's coming fast
Black supremacy

Going darker and darker and darker now we kill
Digging deeper and deeper and deeper our dream is real

Through all the shades of grey
Black is the new white
It is the time, it is the day of
Black supremacy

We create now our future past
When we look back, black history
It started slow, it's coming fast
Black supremacy
Black supremacy
Black supremacy
