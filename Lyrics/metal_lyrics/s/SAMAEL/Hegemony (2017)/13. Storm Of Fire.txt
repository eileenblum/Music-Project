Take your time, find your way
Take a deep breath and get high, get high, high on power
Eyes closed to see the world behind the world
Welcome the space, become the force
Spread your wings, leave your nest
All changes are for the best

Fire, fire, storm of fire
Create and destroy beyond all scope
High, high, high on power
Nullify the end, bloom over the top

Train of thoughts, chain of events
On your path, explore and conquer
Assimilate all that you fear
Always is now, everywhere is here

No turning back
Global attack
Hit and score with all your might

Break the lock
Push your luck
Take a chance in full daylight

Fire, fire, storm of fire
Create and destroy beyond all scope
High, high, high on power
Nullify the end, bloom over the top

Silence, darkness
Dissolution and emptiness
There's nothing, nothing left

There's nothing, nothing but power
Solve-coagula

Take your time, find your way
Take a deep breath...
Fire, fire, storm of fire
Create and destroy beyond all scope
High, high, high on power
Nullify the end, bloom over the top
