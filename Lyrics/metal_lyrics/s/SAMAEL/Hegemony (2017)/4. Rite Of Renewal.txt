The end stops here... your life starts now!
All that we want is to go higher than high
For us the sun shines brighter than bright

All spring of our lives mourn what we left behind
A new cycle ends, it's time to say goodbye
Don't you know how I feel?
Joy and pain are both real
Two roads in parallel
With one that leads to hell

Tabula rasa
Rite of renewal
The past is cleansed and the future is bright
Life has no rival

The dream we dream is now a fact

All that we want is to go higher than high
For us the sun shines brighter than bright

When the morning comes we should forget the night
Resurrection happens through a rite of I renewal

Don't you know how I feel?
Joy and pain are both real
Two roads in parallel
With one that leads to hell

Tabula rasa
Rite of renewal
The past is cleansed and the future is bright
Life has no rival
Rite of renewal

All spring of our lives mourn what we left behind
A cycle ends, it's time to say goodbye

Tabula rasa
Rite of renewal
The past is cleansed and the future is bright
Life has no rival
Rite of renewal
