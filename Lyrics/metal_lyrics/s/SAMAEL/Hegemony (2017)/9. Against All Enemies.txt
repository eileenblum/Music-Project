The fog of confusion is melting away
With a clear mind life's a freeway

Dreams are the meat of reality
We are our own goal, we are our victory
We are our own goal, we are our victory

Against doubt â circumspection
Against certitude â introspection
Our vision rules over stubbornness
With iron will, we crush our every weakness

Triumph is within us
We are one with ourselves
Against all enemies

We are our own goal, we are our victory

Against God there's science
Against evil â common sense
Against obsession â diversity
Against division â unity

Triumph is within us
We are one with ourselves
Against all enemies
Against all enemies

Against intolerance â experience
Against violence â self reliance
Against violence â self reliance

Dreams are the meat of reality

We are victory
Against all enemies
Against all enemies

With iron will, we crush our every weakness
With iron will, we crush our every weakness
