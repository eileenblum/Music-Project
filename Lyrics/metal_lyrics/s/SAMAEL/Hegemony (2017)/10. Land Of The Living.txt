Wild, wild we push borders again
Even if there is nothing to gain

Wide, wide we stretch the horizon
We move ever further without reason

End is something we anticipate
We are willing to participate
And the union is reactivated
Into the future we've precipitated

High, we stand above the abyss
Fixed by a past of pain and bliss

There
In the land of the living
The end never lasts
Here
In the land of the living
Where death is encompassed

Run but the road is round
Like in a roundabout that never gives out

Hold, tales have to be told
Silence turns to gold while the story goes through another run

Far on the main road, on the highway
We master the game that we love to play

Wide, wide we stretch the horizon
We move ever further without reason

Ride, ride we need to go further
Our place is on the front line forever...and ever

There
In the land of the living
The end never lasts
Here
In the land of the living
Where death is encompassed

Run but the road is round
Like in a roundabout that never gives out

Hold, tales have to be told
Silence turns to gold while the story goes through another run

High, we stand above the abyss
Fixed by a past of pain and bliss

There
In the land of the living
The end never lasts
Here
In the land of the living
Where death is encompassed

There
In the land of the living
The end never lasts
Here
In the land of the living
Where death is encompassed
