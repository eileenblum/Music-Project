Justice, for the ones left behind
Fairness for those who have no choice
Justice, for the ones who cannot hide
I stand for those without a voice

On muddy path
On steep slope
On golden road
To diamond hall
I climb the stairs to the city top
I bury the dream that wants me to fall

Black fire
Red fire
Savior
And destroyer

Down in the pit of memory
Almighty crown of victory
The four points of the horizon
Aren't wide enough for my vision

I spread my wings across the Universe
Here's no center, no high or low
All that exists has its reverse
Peace is a trillion megaton blow

Angel of wrath
Angel of wrath

Black fire
Red fire
Savior
And destroyer

On muddy path
On steep slope
On golden road
To diamond hall
I climb the stairs to the city top
I bury the dream that wants me to fall

I spread my wings across the Universe
Here's no center, no high or low
All that exists has its reverse
Peace is a trillion megaton blow

Black fire
Red fire
Savior
And destroyer

Black fire
Red fire
Savior
And destroyer
