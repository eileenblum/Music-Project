Marching on the path of glory
Making our way with every step we take
Ghosts of elders as company
The spirit of time in all that we make

Stronger than ever before
Our power is growing forever more

We are the future
Now we start our venture

World domination
The final victory
We rule over nations
Establish supremacy

World domination
The final victory
We rule over nations
It's our hegemony
It's our hegemony

The earth is our country
All the roads lead to us
We reign over our destiny
There is no stopping, no truce

Boundaries are forced to give way
Levels are flattened, this is a new day

World domination
The final victory
We rule over nations
It's our hegemony
We, we are the future
Now we start our venture
We, we are the future
Now we start our venture

Stronger than ever before
Our power is growing forever more

World domination
The final victory
We rule over nations
Establish supremacy

World domination
It's our hegemony
We rule over nations
It's our hegemony
It's our hegemony
