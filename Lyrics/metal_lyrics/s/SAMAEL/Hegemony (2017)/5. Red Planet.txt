Red, it is time for action
Time for us to play our part
If we unite what's divided
We tighten the social knot
Now is the moment to destroy
All that tears us apart
Not all the problems can be solved
With a gunshot

Union, the path of globality
Reason, the crown of humanity

Red planet, red sky
This world ends in a blast
Red planet, red sky
We're one people at last, at last

Finally we found a way
To resolve the argument around which we revolve
Our global quest for harmony
Is the pinnacle of our society
Yes, in each other we trust
And we do what we must
Red dust under our feet
We're blessed to be cursed, we enlist to resist

Union, the path of globality
Reason, the crown of humanity

Red planet, red sky
This world ends in a blast
Red planet, red sky
We're one people at last

We want more

Currently we inherit privileges
That once were attributed to the elite
Certainly we become better
Than they ever were
Right, to do whatever we want
Pride, we are who we wanted to be
Wide, there are no more borders
Once we're together

Red planet, red sky
This world ends in a blast
Red planet, red sky
We're one people at last

Red planet, red sky
This world ends in a blast
Red planet, red sky
We're one people at last

Red planet, red sky
One people, one people at last
