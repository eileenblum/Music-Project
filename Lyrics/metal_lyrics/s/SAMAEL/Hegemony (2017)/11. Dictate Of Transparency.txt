It's a bit late to try and escape
The world of today has a new shape

Drown in the fever of control
Freely in that trend we enroll

No more place for conviction
All that's real is abstraction

Practically numb to novelties
Incarcerated in civilities

It's no longer the Stasi's lunacy
The dictate of transparency
It's our current reality
A mutation of democracy

Our lives open to scrutiny
The dictate of transparency
Our move on screen for all to see
We dream of the time we were free

Have we ever been free?
Have we ever been free?

We find ourselves on the front line
Not knowing where to draw the line
Free in a jail we don't perceive
Ruled in a way we can't conceive

It's no longer the Stasi's lunacy
The dictate of transparency
Our move on screen for all to see
We dream of the time we were free
Have we ever been free?
Have we ever been free?

Want to be heard - want to be seen
Riot - fire

We gave away privacy...

When all our life is on display
What else have we got to give away?
From the obvious to the obscene
Want to be heard, want to be seen

All is senseless without witness...

It's no longer the Stasi's lunacy
The dictate of transparency
It's our current reality
A mutation of democracy

Our lives open to scrutiny
The dictate of transparency
Our move on screen for all to see
We dream of the time we were free
