What is forced by violence
Isn't supported by evidence
We refuse to validate
What we cannot duplicate

Check reliability
Faith has no credibility
Beliefs aren't to be trusted
Only what's proven should be accepted

Spot the fake don't be a fool, sort things out carefully
Fact or belief, truth is a fight not a relief

Stream of un-channeled thoughts, a perfect way for nonsense junk
Not all what's written down is worth something

How does that fit the world we're living in?
How, how
How does that fit the world we're living in?
How, how

Empiricism is a school
Not a dogma, not a rule
A skeptic can be a fool
But a fool is just a fool

Check reliability
Faith has no credibility
Beliefs aren't to be trusted
Only what's proven should be accepted

Spot the fake don't be a fool, sort things out carefully
Fact or belief, truth is a fight not a relief

Stream of un-channeled thoughts, a perfect way for nonsense junk
Not all what's written down is worth something,., no!

Doubt is not calamity
When we question authority
Challenge the ideology
Accepted by majority

How does that fit the world we're living in?
How, how
How does that fit the world we're living in?
How, how

Spot the fake don't be a fool, sort things out carefully
Fact or belief, truth is a fight not a relief

Stream of un-channeled thoughts, a perfect way for nonsense junk
Not all what's written down is worth something... no!
