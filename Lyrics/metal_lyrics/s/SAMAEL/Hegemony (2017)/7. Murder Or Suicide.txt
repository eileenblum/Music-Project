It's safer for the weak to be narrow minded but

All the details you avoid, the attitudes you condemn

Barrier on the side of the road that guides you to your end
Wrapped inside your monologue you see no contradiction
What you pretend to stand for goes against your position

That's why

When you fly too high, when the circle is closed
You fall on the inside,
down to the other side If you force
your way too hard towards those you opposed
It is your choice to make, murder or suicide

Get out of that hole

Learn to think against yourself avoid pitfalls of analysis
You get drunk on your words; divergence is your nemesis
Verbal avalanches are the death of dialogue
Clarity is never reached and you turn into a demagogue

That's why

When you fly too high, when the circle is closed
You fall on the inside, down to the other side
If you force your way too hard towards those you opposed
It is your choice to make, murder or suicide

Get out!
When you fly too high, when the circle is closed
You fall on the inside,
down to the other side If you force
your way too hard towards those you opposed
It is your choice to make, murder or suicide

Get out, it's murder or suicide
