some say it's hard to get it all
but what I dreamed is what I am
I turned my eyes to see it all
to give you what you're looking for

come the force come the wind come the sun
into our ring

make me shine make me rain make clear water with blood
take me high burn me up and tear it all down
push me out throw in the ocean of love
make me one make me I
should I keep you in my wheel should I take you in my arms

if you want what I want
if you need what I am

come on let's be as one

if you want what I want
if you need what I am
come on take me home

step on it stay above I did spoil your life with light
to let you see what can be if our hearts ever collide

won't you give me a try won't you give me another chance
won't you give me a try won't you give me another chance

you're here when I'm there
I see you everywhere
you're cool you're special
you're calm and beautiful
you're a nine you're mine
and we got along at night

if you want what I want
if you need what I am
come on let's be as one

if you want what I want
if you need what I am
come on take me home

won't you give me a try won't you give me another chance
won't you give me a try won't you give me another chance
