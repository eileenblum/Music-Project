All hail, hail me back
feel my aim look through me now
come to me, fly in me
get on the top and throw it down my soul
I burn it all here comes the sun

Ask your goal to lead your dream
stay on the line speak the truth
walk my path bright and clear
I lead your soul I send you through
send a prayer to those who felt
Peace &amp; Love in der Welt
read me well between the lines
for I'm what I meant to be

forgive me now
forget me not
hold your fight
take that light
we don't need another war
let shine inside what we send you here

all I heal, heal me back
let heaven shine on all my sins
turn the wheel move your will
to where your wish is guided to
just wait for a while
till what you ask comes down your way

Ask your goal to lead your dream
stay on the line speak the truth
walk my path bright and clear
I lead your soul I send you through
send a prayer to those who felt
Peace &amp; Love in der Welt
read me well between the lines
for I'm what I meant to be

what I meant to be...
