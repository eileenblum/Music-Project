Reversed time climb up the side of mystery
holding tight the key to nowhereland the long time promise
at the beginning
the origin
aren't we supposed to be bound
aren't we prepared to re-cloned
the universe we imagine
the memory we left behind
the time we drain the time we kill
what's the need for a better life tell me

from where you are radiant star
light the way of those who search of those who stay
from where you are radiant star
light the way of those who search of those who pray here

spend a day to wonder
have a night to remember
beyond the pain that each day gives
rising the joy that you perceive
through blurry thoughts you do conceive
a strong passion that won't deceive
the force you own needs no shelter
nowhere should be the place that you fear
nowhere should be the place that you fear

from where you are radiant star
light the way of those who search of those who stay
from where you are radiant star
light the way of those who search of those who pray here
