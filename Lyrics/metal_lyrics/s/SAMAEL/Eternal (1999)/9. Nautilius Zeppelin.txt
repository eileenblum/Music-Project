let me glow, let me flow
let me grow in you heart
in your mind
in your soul
anywhere, anytime, anyhow
when you want, when you need, when you know
I will be there for you
I will be there with you

the sea navigable
the sky has no limits
for those who are able
for understanding what does fit
to the world they're heading for
to the life they're looking for
let me take you on board
let me sail you to the shore

to choose is sometime to lose they say
to lose what you haven't chosen but yes
I confess I want you all

welcome on board guide you on both sides
lighthouse in the fog I show you where you stand now

catch my aim from below
control let you drown
catch my aim from below
lose control let you drown...

wanna have sun in the winter
wanna have snow in the summer
wanna feel always better
wanna come a bit closer

we got on the top and we keep being more than we ever expected to be
yes that's exactly what I meant
yes that's exactly how I went
Aproche...

the sea navigable
the sky has no limits
for those who are able
for understanding what does fit
to the world they're heading for
to the life they're looking for
let me take you on board
let me sail you to the shore
