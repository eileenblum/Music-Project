life is a road life is a plan
life is a role life is more than it seems
enlightened delighted
confused or clear today is your day

there's world in a world outside
they're all the same when you stay inside

getting the news from here and there
blocking thoughts before they turn into lies
switching on switching off
when you're on your own you belong to yourself

and the night is alright
and your days get better and better in every way
just slip down your sleep to enlighten tomorrow
'till you go flashing up the sky

there's world in a outside
they're all the same when you stay inside

life is a road life is a plan
life is a role life is more than it seems
enlightened delighted
confused or clear today is your day
run around get over

and the night is alright
and your days get better and better in every way
just slip down your sleep to enlighten tomorrow
'till you go flashing up the sky
