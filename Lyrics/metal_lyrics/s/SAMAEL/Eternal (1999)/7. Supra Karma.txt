some stay some leave
some come some go
get on the air
and check your plan
if you do try you'll remember
the fine line no one denied
unsharing joy is a pain to release

One by one we all came around and we
danced around night and day
One by one we just play our round to
leave and drop another way

some stay some leave
some come some go
unsharing joy is a pain to release

One by one we all came around and we
danced around night and day
One by one we just play our round to
leave and drop another way

get on the air
and check your plan
get on the air
and make a wish
if you do try you'll remember

the heart is strong
and it keeps warm
what the distance
will never change

One by one we all came around and we
danced around night and day
One by one we just play our round to
leave and drop another way
