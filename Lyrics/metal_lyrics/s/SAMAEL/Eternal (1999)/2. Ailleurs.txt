take it down a little bit before we start
you meant to get the best
and to borrow the rest
carrying an omen to save your love and guest
be honest to your own self

develop your skills
be aware of the abyss
put your soul sky-high
got to see the light - got to see the light
that lights other lights
got to feel the sound - got to feel the sound
that comes over silence

read the shadow on the wall... keep an eye on our own!

got to socialize - got to socialize
your independence
bridges have to fall, bridges have to fall
if you wanna rise
clear your view from abnegation
wait the time of transition
stand... gather staff for war of reason

please get a grip when you explode
for some may be exposed
avoid the peace that she imposed
compress the past 'till it implodes
just play with what you won't control
games you lose are those you win
giving and taking a lesson to thrill
pull up your heart where it hasn't gone
pull up your heart where it hasn't gone

got to see the light - got to see the light
that lights other lights
got to feel the sound - got to feel the sound
that comes over silence

read the shadow on the wall... keep an eye on your own!

please get a grip when you explode
for some may be exposed
avoid the peace that she imposed
compress the past 'till it implodes
just play with what you won't control
games you lose are those you win
giving and taking a lesson to thrill
pull up your heart where it hasn't gone
pull up your heart where it hasn't gone

invited, guided, harmonised, organised,
terrorized by what is ailleurs
