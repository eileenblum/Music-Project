Born in a world of superstition
To live a life of submission
Raped by dogma forced into the mind
Iâve looked somewhere else for what was already mine

I am the antidote to the syndrome of God
I am the Antigod, the only hope that you got
I am the Antigod

Religion is a road above oneâs head,
Hiding the light and obscuring the way
Faith is alive when reason is dead,
Forget to live while waiting for âThe dayâ

I am the antidote to the syndrome of God
I am the Antigod, the only hope that you got

Chose investigation over resignation
And I will always be by your side

Morphing the truth into convenient lies
Feeding a fraud impossible to size
Grafting rules on common sense
Turning freedom into an offense

I am the antidote to the syndrome of God
I am the Antigod, the only hope that you got
I am the Antigod
I am the antidote
I am the Antigod
Deum De Deo, I am God!
