When money rules the game it diminishes life
It narrows perspective to a single line
If it is too much it is not enough
Whatever we earn, for more you still yearn

Weâre looking for satisfaction
Our world is stuffed with ambition
Everything we do, is done in excess
Weâre junkies addicted to success

All our emotions are rationalized
Weâre careful on what we capitalize
Rare rocks and precious metal
Our power grows, itâs natural

If faith has a use, itâs to let us believe
Righteousness is on our side
We got nothing to hide
Of our goal, of our lust
In Gold we trust

Weâre looking for satisfaction
Our world is stuffed with ambition
Everything we do, is done in excess
Weâre junkies addicted to success

If faith has a use, itâs to let us believe
Righteousness is on our side
We got nothing to hide
Of our goal, of our lust
In Gold we trust

Money, prosperity
Wealth has authority
