Make the most of every day sweet or sour
Enjoy the time that you got every minute every hour
Give all that you can give for thereâs no end in sight
Leave all that you want to leave in the embrace of mother night

Sometime the pain is so heavy it makes it hard to breathe
Feels like itâll never stop but something new is âbout to begin

Make the most of every day sweet or sour
Enjoy the time that you got every minute every hour
Give all that you can give for thereâs no end in sight
Leave all that you want to leave in the embrace of mother night

Sometime the pain is so heavy it makes it hard to breathe
Feels like itâll never stop but something new is âbout to begin

Donât fall asleep over your responsibilities
Stay awake donât turn away from life's duties

Sadness is happiness born dead
Sorrow is an unacknowledged joy

Tick-tock, wake up this time is what you got
Tap the beginning that you foresee
Tick-tock, wake up time to connect the dots
What youâre learning will set you free

Make the most of every day sweet or sour
Enjoy the time that you got every minute every hour
Give all that you can give for thereâs no end in sight
Leave all that you want to leave in the embrace of mother night
