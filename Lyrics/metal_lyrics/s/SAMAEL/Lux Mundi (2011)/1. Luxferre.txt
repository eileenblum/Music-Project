Itâs time for moving on as the past is too worn
Our life has just begun and a new day is born
No more prevarication, no more delay
I ainât gonna await my last breath to say

More light for the thoughts that I dig
More light in the places I stay
More light on the path that I walk

More light âround the questions that I bear
More light in the eyes that I see
More light in the light that I bring

My kingdom is from this world
I burn from the fire that I hold

Itâs a simplicity of utter complexity
Weâre holding the key to a life of wealth and luxury
Our body, our mind all the rest is so unreal
See knowledge is an ever-growing flame

More light for the thoughts that I dig
More light in the places I stay
More light on the path that I walk

More light âround the questions that I bear
More light in the eyes that I see
More light in the light that I bring

Turn it, turn it on
More lightâs what matters and after all what weâre all after
A better sight, a clearer view of whatâs about to come
Turn it, turn it now
Turn your eyes to the other side
Your temple is inside

More light for the thoughts that I dig
More light in the places I stay
More light on the path that I walk

More light âround the questions that I bear
More light in the eyes that I see
More light in the light that I bring

My kingdom is from this world
I burn from the fire that I hold
My kingdom is from this world
This new era will be brighter and bold
Brighter and bold
