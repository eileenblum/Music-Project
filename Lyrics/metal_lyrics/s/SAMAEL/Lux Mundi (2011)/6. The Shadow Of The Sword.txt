Listen!
This is a true story, based on reality
A mass of frenzy, a poison sold as remedy

They tell you knowledge is a curse but ignorance ainât bliss
They tell you love one another while waging war for peace

Delusion, fraud and deception
The foundation of religion

Is it that holy to decide to be nothing but a shadow of a man?
Trading life with death, mixing lies with hope and living in the shadow of the
sword

Middle age in the 21st century
Struggling to survive modernity
Trapped in a time of obscurantism
Where minds rely on archaism

Arrogance, wealth and violence
The trinity of monotheism

Is it that holy to decide to be nothing but a shadow of a man?
Trading life with death, mixing lies with hope and living in the shadow of the
sword
Is it that holy, tell me, to decide to be nothing more than a shadow of a man?
Trading life with death, mixing lies with hope and living in the shadow of the
sword

Arrogance, wealth and violence
The trinity of monotheism
Arrogance, wealth and violence
The trinity of monotheism

Is it that holy to decide to be nothing but a shadow of a man?
Trading life with death, mixing lies with hope and living in the shadow of the
sword
