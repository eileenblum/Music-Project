All that youâve never seen now you can feel
All that has yet never been now is for real

What was behind is now right in front of me
Iâm looking further than my eyes can see

All that youâve never seen now you can feel
All that has yet never been now is for real

Where the will is strong thereâll always be a way
The dream goes on forever and a day

Soul invictus â soul invictus

The Universeâs pulsing right under my skin
Iâm standing higher where the air is thin

No longer holding in we let it out
No more silent screams now we can shout

Where the will is strong thereâll always be a way
The dream goes on forever and a day

Soul invictus â soul invictus

What was behind is now right in front of me
But Iâm looking further than my eyes can see

Souls is growing - stretching endlessly
Now Iâm moving into Infinity
