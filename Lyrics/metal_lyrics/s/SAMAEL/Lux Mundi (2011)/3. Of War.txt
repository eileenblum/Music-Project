Anger - the force of the weak that tricks oneself but fools no one
Power - the force that absorbs without being overwhelmed

War the deeper scar of history
War the sanctification of tragedy

Peace â as crown of war is glory built upon misery
Terror â in a dead end finds its way out in the ecstasy of destruction

War the deeper scar of history
War the sanctification of tragedy
War the illusion of majesty
Why should we drink the poison before the remedy

Pride to die in combat â like all the other dead
All this to learn that - all nationsâ blood is running red
Pride to die in combat â like all the other dead
All this to learn that - all nationsâ blood is running red

War the deeper scar of history
War the sanctification of tragedy
War the illusion of majesty
Why should we drink the poison before the remedy
