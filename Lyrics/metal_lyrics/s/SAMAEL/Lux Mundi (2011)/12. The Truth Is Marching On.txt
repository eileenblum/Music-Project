Break!

Dream of domination is an invisible hand
Purpose on its own leading to inevitable end

Victors are the ones who shape reality
Past of mystery for future of prophecy

Break, break the chain!

The truth is marching on, it blows the lies away
The truth is marching on, and marching all the way

Once you zoom in, discrepancies stretch out
Unverifiable certitude should always arise doubt

A lie needs believers to be sustained
As power needs slaves to be maintained

Break, break the chain!

The truth is marching on, it blows the lies away
The truth is marching on, and marching all the way
The truth is marching on, it blows the lies away
The truth is marching on, and marching all the way

Inconsistencies believed on a false assumption
Breed affirmations repugnant to comprehension

Questions and wonders make one uneasy
Denial of our instinct hijacks our integrity

Break!
Break!

The truth is marching on, it blows the lies away
The truth is marching on, and marching all the way
The truth is marching on, it blows the lies away
The truth is marching on, and marching all the way
