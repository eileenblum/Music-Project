Call me SamaÃ«l
Billion years ago
I was already there
Waiting to exist

Call me SamaÃ«l
Billion years ago
When dream took a shape
To shape other dreams
I was already there waiting to exist

At the dawn of my time, the morning of my life
When nothing stood between me and infinity
Distractions were so few and wonders were legion
Now how much of that past reflects on tomorrow

Every noise, amplified
Every thought, deconstructed
Here machines rule supreme
You got the goal now get the scheme
Chasing above and hunting below

At the dawn of my time, the morning of my life
When nothing stood between me and infinity
Distractions were so few and wonders were legion
Now how much of that past reflects on tomorrow

Fishing in the deep, plunging into the dark
Waking from my sleep, looking for a spark

At the dawn of my time, the morning of my life
When nothing stood between me and infinity
Distractions were so few and wonders were legion
Now how much of that past reflects on tomorrow
