This earth is my country where everyone should be free
No more hypocrisy this worldâs falling into agony
Many tried and are still trying to lead you astray, make you feel small
They tell you not to worry that all is good and under control

Rules are made to be broken and thatâs only what they are for
Thereâs no one to bow before
Now let my people be!
We donât ever wanna hear âbout the joy of servility
Freedom is no tyranny
So let my people be!

No need for a scapegoat when your oppressor
Happens to be none other than you

Got the right not to conform
The right not to accept
The right to be and the right to live
A life thatâs real a life that is alive

Rules are made to be broken and thatâs only what they are for
Thereâs no one to bow before
Now let my people be!
We donât ever wanna hear âbout the joy of servility
Freedom is no tyranny
So let my people be!

Donât suck in when you should spit, donât give in when you should fight
Donât suck in when you should spit, donât give in when you should fight

Choose what feels right over whatâs said to be so
You wonât ever suffer
The contortions of a mind trying to make a circle square

This earth is my country where everyone should be free
No more hypocrisy this worldâs falling into agony
Many tried and are still trying to lead you astray, make you feel small
They tell you not to worry that all is good and under control

Rules are made to be broken and thatâs only what they are for
Thereâs no one to bow before
Now let my people be!
We donât ever wanna hear âbout the joy of servility
Freedom is no tyranny
So let my people be
