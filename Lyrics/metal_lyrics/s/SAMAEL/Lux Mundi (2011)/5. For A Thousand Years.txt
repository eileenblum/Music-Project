All that we shared, wasnât a lie
Weâll never have to say goodbye

The taste of eternity
Is wired to our memory

Reaching the end of a broken line â while the road is still fine
Longing to stay a little longer â when our time is over

Hey !
Forever at human scale is still not immortality
Breaking doors of heaven and hell and living for a thousand years
Yeah, living for a thousand years

No what we shared wasnât a lie
My love for you will never die

Dreaming away the unbearable â landing before the crash
When the word turns black and purple â memory is hard cash

Hey !
Forever at human scale is still not immortality
Breaking doors of heaven and hell and living for a thousand years

Suddenly the wind is blowing, fresh air is coming and weâre moving away
Our griefâs balanced with our joy, we sow on new soil, today is a new day

Are you with me?

Hey !
Forever at human scale is still not immortality
Breaking doors of heaven and hell and living for a thousand years
Yeah, living for a thousand years
