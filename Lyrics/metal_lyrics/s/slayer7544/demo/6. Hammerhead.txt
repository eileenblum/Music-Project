Look out behind you he is coming you can hear it for miles around
Look out behind you he is coming he's attracted by the sound
Everyone screaming, panic, splashing means the hammerhead is near
People are running from the danger falling blinded by their fear

Hammerhead keeps on swimming.
Hammerhead keep on taking those lives.
Hammerhead, king of the water.
Hammerhead.
In the deep death is lurking for the fools he is waiting.
He will wait until you stray and then he'll strike.
Hammerhead.

Somebody screams out Shark and the bather's blood runs cold.
Everyone rams, but one too slowly and the teeth of death take hold.
See the blood rising, water swirling as the killer takes his prey.
Screams of pain ring through the air as another life slips away.

Down on another beach are people playing games and having fun.
Some of them swimming in the sea and some are soaking up the sun.
None of them realise the danger that is lying there in wait.
None of them realise the danger until he strikes and it's too late.
