Wrapped up tight in blackest black no sense of place or time.
Feeling my way around a world where the sun has ceased to shine.
Something is moving in the dark, I stop and hold my breath.
Frozen as the terror strikes I prepare myself for death.
Blind terror.

Icy fingers round throat I struggle to break free
To no avail I kick and claw if only I could see
Satan's got a hold on me and now he won't let go.
Will I see this nightmare through perhaps I'll never know.
Blind terror

I listen to the sounds from all around me I try my best to find out where I am.
And then I feel an icy wind cut through me it chills my bones and bites my trembling hands
Then suddenly the wind's replaced by fire I hear a distant voice screaming my name.
There's no escape, the fire's all around me the heat is so intense I scream in pain it burns.
Black sky, Midday, Death stalks, I am prey no light can't see can you help me?
Blind terror.

Wrapped up tight in blackest black no sense of touch or sound.
My mind is searching for a hold as it spins round and round.
Suddenly my sight returns I am safe in bed it seems.
I realise that my ordeal was nothing but it dream.
Blind terror was all a crazy dream.
No longer alone in the darkness now that I can see
