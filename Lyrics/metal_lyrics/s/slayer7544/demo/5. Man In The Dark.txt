He stands in the gateway his eyes filled with fire
A lust for the dark life a killing desire.
Man in dark bring clown your blade take a life.
Man in the dark give vent to your blood lust tonight.

A seething black hatred that blots out the light.
He raises his arm and brings down a knife.
And cut them down they call it murder where I'm from.
Man in dark bring clown your blade take a life.
Man in the dark give vent to your blood lust tonight.

He watches the stragglers and creeps up behind.
His passion is hatred his hatred is blind
Man in dark bring clown your blade take a life.
Man in the dark give vent to your blood lust tonight.
