There is a hole within my life I've tried my best to mend.
And when you left I really thought I'd lost my only friend.
Now I know that I was wrong, there is no need to cry.
No matter how many tears I shed, I know love is a lie.

I didn't see the truth before. I was blinded by your light.
But now the winds of change have blown and brought me back my sight.
You hurt me for too many years why did you choose this game?
Now my eyes are open, I no longer feel the pain.

Feeling lonely, it was the only problem that I faced.
Okay, you left me, now I will find me someone to take your place.
Someone to take the place of you.

As hours and days turned into years I dreamed that you were there.
The feeling of an empty house was more than I could bear.
Now times have changed and I've learned to face the things I used to fear.
No more will I spend all my days just wishing you were here.
I've broken the chains that held use down I freed myself from you.
My love for you has died and now if s to start anew.
I'll find myself a brand new love and play it by the rules.
No more tears because now I know broken hearts are for fools
