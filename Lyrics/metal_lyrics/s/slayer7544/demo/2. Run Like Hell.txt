The sky grows it is night time in the forest the people sleep as the forest comes to life.
Something stirs there is movement in the twilight please beware there is danger in the night.
Nobody ever survived you better run for your life nothing can save you but speed, don't you be foolish I plead.
You didn't carry a gun, all I can tell you is run fast as a Jaguar at least you got to hide from the beast.

You're all alone as you wander through the darkness your sixth sense telling you there's something very wrong.
A few more steps and you hear something behind you should you turn around and look or should you run?
Run from the beast now.
Your mind is racing, your heart is pumping faster your legs are aching, your lungs are racked with pain.
Don't you stop now, you must escape the danger run like hell or you'll never run again run like hell.
