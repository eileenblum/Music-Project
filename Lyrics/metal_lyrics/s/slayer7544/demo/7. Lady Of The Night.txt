You came to me out of the night you were lonely and cold.
You said you would stay until daylight I could not let you go.
The impression you made on that night has stayed deep in my mind.
I thought I had found what had proved to be so hard to find.

Lady of the night-time come into my room I need you here to lift the gloom.
Please me in a way I've never known before Woman from the darkness take me I am yours.
I want you Dark lady.

Lady of the night-time stole my heart away I pray you're here with me to stay.
I've seen all I need to see to make me care Lady of the night please promise you'll be there.
When I need you Woman My lady of the night You haunt my night and days I need you. Woman I want you.

Darkness never was a friend to me before.
But since you came to me, I'm really not so sure.
No time can thrill me like the night-time can.
Lady of the night please take me for your man
Because I love you Lady of the night.
