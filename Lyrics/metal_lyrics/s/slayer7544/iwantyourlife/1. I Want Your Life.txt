You've taken me for everything I've got,
You tried to turn me into something I'm not.
You cheat me and you tell me lies.
Don't want your love I want your life.

My mind is twisted due to what you've done.
I doubt if you will see tomorrow's sun.
Don't know what made me take you for my wife.
Don't want your love I want your life.

You say you're sorry and you'll change your ways,
But only death can take this pain away.
Your pleas and promises won't change my mind.
Don't want you I want your life.
