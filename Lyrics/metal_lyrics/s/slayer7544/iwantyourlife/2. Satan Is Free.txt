The coven is meeting, the time is midnight.
The powers of darkness are out for a fight.
Asmodaeus and Lucifer wait for a sign.
Beelzebub grinning, he knows it is time.
You are going to learn or you are going to burn Satan is free.

The evil of Hades has finally emerged.
The Black Prince conducts while his imps play a dirge.
Love has been banished and hatred is king.
Beelzebub grinning as hell's angels sing.
You are going to learn or you are going to burn Satan is free.

There's nothing to stop them their evil is now.
The black hoards of Hades have taken a vow,
To nurture their evil where good used to be.
Satan is laughing, at last he is free
You are going to learn or you are going to burn Satan is free.
