A perfect place that we once called our own
Now lays in ruins after what we've become
You felt disgusted I thought you trusted me
But you made the tension become unbearable

I ask myself why - why do I still feel hurt inside
A perfect life - sacred vows
There was nothing sacred about us...

Itâs still consuming me and I am slipping away
The thought of you getting on puts me back in despair

So ask yourself why - why do you still feel wrong inside
Now that we are done
We are still the tormented ones...

Our eyes canât hide the demons buried deep inside
This time I wonât mind leaving everything behind

What have we done?
Where are we now?
