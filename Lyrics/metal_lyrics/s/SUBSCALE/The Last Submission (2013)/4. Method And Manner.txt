Our lives are sealed and kept unfulfilled
Through methods that keep us corrupted
The mindset that is feeding on attention and eating us alive

Depressive emotions and we keep pretending
While trying to help we destroy everything we touch

All the noise that keeps piercing
Our ears no longer will listen
Dreams we used to shape our lives have now imprisoned our minds
Left us with nothing and screaming in silence as we are falling apart

(You left us with nothing...now weâre falling apart)

We keep striving and hoping and lying
Till the moment when the roof caves in
All our hopes fly out the windows
Instincts got buried under wasted years

Depressive emotions and we keep pretending
While trying to help we destroy everything we touch

All the noise that keeps piercing
Our ears no longer will listen
Dreams we used to shape our lives have now imprisoned our minds
Left us with nothing and screaming in silence as we are falling apart

We are the ones who have tightened the ropes
We are the ones who imprisoned us all
We are the ones who have slayed our own kind
We are nothing....

We are the ones that are squeezing our necks
We are the ones who have lost all respect
We are the ones who will crumble and fall
We are the ones who will bury us all
Left us with nothing and screaming in silence falling apart...

(You left us with nothing...now weâre falling apart)

Depressive emotions and we keep pretending
While trying to help we destroy everything we touch
The constant feeling that weâre descending
Our instincts are fading but a part of us still feels alive

All the noise that keeps piercing
Our ears no longer will listen
Dreams we used to shape our lives have now imprisoned our minds
Left us with nothing and screaming in silence as we are falling apart
