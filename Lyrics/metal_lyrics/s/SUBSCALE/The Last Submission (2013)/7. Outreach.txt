âIt's getting hard to breathe
My blood is running thin
The taste is sickening
My chest is caving inâ

Mother...

âItâs getting hard to breathe
Iâm slowly giving inâ

You took the best of me and left me in ruins

Liar - You took your life for granted
Your eyes trade lies for compassion
âMy eyes are filled with deception
My eyes trade lies for compassionâ

It took your life away and left you in ruins

No - we werenât built to last
Weâre falling to pieces
No - we werenât built to rest
Weâre part of a vicious cycle

We are all just fucking liars - we were never built to last
We are all just fucking liars - we are never gonna last
Burning from inside - I feel so helpless now
Burning from inside - I feel so helpless now

No - we werenât built to last
Weâre falling to pieces
No - we werenât built to rest
Weâre part of a vicious cycle

It took the best of me
Now Iâm lying in ruins
You took the best of me
Now weâre lying in ruins
