And even if you are wrong it's undeniable
That every word we say just makes it worse
Did you think that we could have it all?
I've done nothing wrong

I just can't let it go
No I've done nothing wrong

"Greed has poisoned man's souls, has barricaded the world with hate
has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed
We think too much and we feel too little
we have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in..."

I'm falling - I am done
I see myself - I see everyone
This bareness is not what life's about

We are all just words with sanctions
We are kneeling - we are god

And even if you are wrong I'm still miserable
Every word you said just made it worse
Did you think that I would let it go?
I've done nothing wrong

"The machinery that gives abundance has left us in want
Our knowledge has made us cynical our cleverness hard and unkind
More than machinery we need humanity
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness..."

We falter - we are numb
In petty terms we cloak our lives
Limits are the fraud set by our minds

We are all just words with sanctions
We are falsely proud
We are kneeling - we are god

We are all just words with sanctions
We are falsely proud
We are kneeling â we are god

And even if you are wrong I'm still miserable
How far can our grasp reach if we are fictional?
So tell me what have we become
Are we so trivial?
We are so miserable...

And even if we are right there must be something more to this life
If weâre the construct where is the motherfucking architect?
