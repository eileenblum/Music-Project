âI am so tired and strung out day after day...
I have nothing left...
Lost all my faith now I'm right at the end...
They took it all away...â

These are the words of a desperate man not taking his last stand
So I swore to myself not to give up and fight - fight till my last breath

I will conquer the poisons inside me
I will unmask the face that keeps hiding
I will unveil...

wheels of time are catching on
The weight of the world keeps pulling me under

The wheels of time are catching on
As the weight of the world keeps pulling me under
All the scars that forge my skin
Remind me that I have so much to give

I will conquer the poisons inside me
I will unmask the face that keeps hiding
I will unveil

The wheels of time are catching on
As the weight of the world keeps pulling me under
All the scars that forge my skin
Remind me that I have so much more to give

The wheels of time are catching on
As the weight of the world keeps pulling me under
All the scars that forge my skin
I still have so much...
...so much more to give
