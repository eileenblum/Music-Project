"A lot of times the ability to see what's coming gives you the chance to do something...
We are sleepwalking through history and the consequences may be dire...
In a society which is predicated on competition...and the ruthless exploitation of one human being by another... the profiteering... the ruling ideology will very often justify that behavior to some fundamental and unalterable human nature"

This is our home...

The sun is slowly drowning
The fires are seeding black
The seas cover us with silence
Endless oceans wash our sins away

Time has proven our emptiness
The mist has covered our tracks
Life never meant anything
Just an echo from the past

If the act of violence is part of mankind we deserve the suffering
Since the age of man we have been acting like gods and the time has run out

This is our home...
The fires are seeding black
This is our home...
Endless oceans wash us away

Our sun is slowly drowning
The fires are seeding black
Our world is slowly dying
Endless oceans wash us all away...

All away...
