Here is my explanation
I'll bring chaos to your routine
What you love and hold sacred
Never meant anything
The fault you cast upon us
The guilt and burnt in scars
Pictures and memories
All taking sides now

All the turmoil...
All the tears...for nothing

Your smile so familiar
But it's so fucking wrong
To think that's all it takes
To turn my head and walk along
The road we've paved
With silence and regrets
Too many things that we hoped to forget

All the turmoil that we collected
All the tears...for nothing

(All those years...)

For so many years we've let our lives slide
Emotions we've bread
Barely kept us alive
If there ever was a point of no return
We've left it far behind
Our hopeless days and jaded nights

All the turmoil that we collected
All the tears you cashed in for nothing
All the turmoil that we collected
All the tears you cashed in for nothing

(All those years...for nothing)

I see a picture torn of what we once had
All the healing words that could have been said

I see a picture torn of what we once had
All the healing words that have never been said

All the turmoil that we collected over the years
All the tears you cashed in for nothing
All the merits that you hold dear (so dear)
All the fault you pushed upon us will never leave us
