This is not what I've hoped for...
This is not what I've longed for...

I choose to stay just a little while longer
In hope...
In hope of a change

Leaving me guilty for your own reactions
Making me feel smaller than I already am

Will you recognize what you have done?
Cutting the line, just to make it worse...
Can't you feel what I'm holding inside?
So come and take just one look through my eyes...

We are no longer what we used to be
Why did you turn your head when I needed you to see
You are no longer who you used to be
And now it feels like I'm drowning...
