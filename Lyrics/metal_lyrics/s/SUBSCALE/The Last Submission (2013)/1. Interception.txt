Wake up from your peaceful dream and be the first to see
That we are the ones who cast the shadow
When in reality weâve just built a vivid framework
We hide the reasons why weâre all crawling through life
So we mourn the loss we suffer
Our life is a tragedy and we are all just sitting ducks

Infinite raw subconscious
We lost sight of what is real
If you think you were given an option
Youâll be in for a rude awakening

The truth you once knew your mind will surely forget
One simple idea is spreading like a plague

Infinite raw subconscious
Crush the castle built on fear
Expand beyond every limitation
Itâs the only way to a true awakening

The truth you once knew your mind will surely forget
One simple idea is spreading like a plague
The truth you once knew your mind will surely forget

Your house of cards has finally come crashing down
So pick up the pieces and move beyond your mind
And leave your selfish life behind

The truth you once knew your mind will surely forget
One simple idea is spreading like a plague
The truth you once knew your mind will surely forget
One simple idea is spreading like a plague

Your house of cards came crashing down
Move beyond your mind and leave your life behind
