How far can we go?
Every step that we take brings us closer to the edge...
And now that we've reached the end there is no turning back

Every word, every breath, every dream that we had
Nothing but shadows every step of the way...
We are grasping at straws and fading away

We are sitting on shoulders of giants
We are playing gods amongst ourselves
We are disregarding the fear of perfection
We are just another mistake we made

...just another mistake we made
...just another mistake we made

We're just another mistake we made
We're just another mistake...

Our souls separate in silence and we slowly close our eyes
...as life passes us by
Our bodies turn to ashes and our loved ones into dust
...how could we be so blind

We are sitting on shoulders of giants
We are playing gods amongst ourselves
We are disregarding the fear of perfection
We are just another mistake we made

Our souls separate in silence and we slowly close our eyes
Our bodies turn to ashes and our loved ones into dust
How could we be so blind....be so blind...

We are sitting on shoulders of giants
We are playing gods amongst ourselves
We are disregarding the fear of perfection
We are just another mistake we made

...just another mistake we made
...just another mistake we made...another fucking mistake...

We are sitting on shoulders of giants
We are playing gods amongst ourselves
We are disregarding the fear of perfection
We are just another mistake we made...

We're just another mistake we made...
