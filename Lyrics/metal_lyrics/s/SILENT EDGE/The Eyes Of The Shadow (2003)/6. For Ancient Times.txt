Lying here for hundreds of years 
This Evil Force of Darkness on a quest to let them bleed
From out of his crypt he conquers without fear
Millions of souls revenge is what he seeks

And when the night has fallen 
You hear him calling out their names
You can hear his spirit talking:
"It will never be the same!"

He's walking through their dreams annihilating every light 
Until darkness is the only thing they can see 
Their minds will all be victimized and paralyzed
'Til they are too deaf and blind to hear and see 
The revelating sound and light which could set them free 

And when the night has fallen 
You hear him calling out their names
You can hear his spirit talking:
"It will never be the same!"

Children of an ancient time make no mistake your mind is mine
Revenge is what I seek your hearts will bleed
Surrender to the rage in me the force of immortality
Revenge is what I seek for ancient times

He's taking all their dreams annihilating every life
Until sadness is the only thing they can feel
Their minds will all be victimized and paralyzed
'Til they are too deaf and blind to hear and see
The revelating sound and light which could set them free

And when the night has fallen 
You hear him calling out their names
You can hear his spirit talking:
"It will never be the same!"

There he lies the king of darkness
He is crying bitter tears
Despite his evil force he is helpless 
To live a solitary life it's chaining him into eternity for ancient times
