I can remember I resisted temptations and traps you would fall into
For separate unity would you sacrifice your soul?
Between the lines and lies begging for answers for chances you never had
You show me your 'pure' energy you would sell for gold

Can't you feel the force?

You can't mirror your eyes can't reason your thoughts
I sense fear from my first impressions in your mind
For all of us uncover your eyes be free!
Beneath the edge of time and light
Chained to the masses just speaking your voiceless words 
The naked truth revealed: you will sell, I know, you will sell your soul 

Can't you feel the force?

Would you sacrifice your soul?
Would you sell your soul for gold?

Thrown into the sea drowning new wisdom 
Echo the answers your story your 'ancient rites'
Not even once did you try to listen to my call
Between the lines and lies
Seeing the future ignoring the sacred signs
You show me your true fantasies you would trade for gold

Can you feel the force?

Can you tell does darkness light this fantasy?
Beyond the line where the Silent Edge will shine
I can tell this path across reality is found by rebellion's force within 

Can you tell does darkness light this fantasy?
Beyond the line where the Silent Edge will shine
I can tell this path across reality is found by rebellion's force within

Would you sacrifice your soul?
Would you sell your soul for gold?
Would you sacrifice your soul?
Would you sell your soul for gold?
