[Lyrics by Emo Suripatty]
[Music by Emo Suripatty &amp; Minggus Gaspersz]

No smile no glance no love no hand
To silence the tears when they're falling
Grief it blinds this mind to find a way out of this legacy

Fear the rage in me
Force me to hide the innocence of the secret inside

Behind these eyes grief it sleeps
Waiting for the words unspoken
Breathing my mind
Thoughts unkind 'til it awakes
It's the Savage Symphony of my youth
It's the Savage Symphony

All victims of Medusa's sight
By a Nordic cold surrounded
And tortured lies twist, while dreams they die, all hope to illusion

Fear the rage in me
Force me to hide the innocence of the secret inside

Behind these eyes grief it sleeps
Waiting for the words unspoken
Breathing my mind
Thoughts unkind 'til it awakes
It's the Savage Symphony of my youth
It's the Savage Symphony

... inside ...

Behind these eyes grief it sleeps
Waiting for the words unspoken
Breathing my mind
Thoughts unkind 'til it awakes
It's the Savage Symphony of my youth
It's the Savage Symphony of my youth
It's the Savage Symphony
