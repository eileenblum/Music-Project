[Lyrics &amp; music by Emo Suripatty]

Old memories, cold and confusing 
Just empty words inside 
bitterness, the pain within 
Veil of tears grays her eyes, still ... 

Like a child, she watches and smiles:
"Face the moonlight in dreams with you" 
Now a man, strange feelings surround me 
It's the curse I feel cold within 

She tries to hold the candles 
Still she tries to hide behind a smile 
Her hand held to my head 
The warmth within her answer: 
"Your love can't burn alone ..."

Her beauty shines when she whispers:
"Please, say you understand"
Now I realize, from bright and silent skies
Dying days to me

I try to light the candles 
Still I try to hide behind a smile 
Her glance caressed my thoughts 
The pain within my answer: 
"I know, it's the curse I hold ..."

Whenever I believe my fantasy deceives me
And still I wonder why I feel a curse inside of me

Whenever I believe my fantasy deceives me
And still I wonder why I won't surrender to the curse I hold ...
