[Lyrics by Minggus Gaspersz]
[Music by Minggus Gaspersz &amp; Emo Suripatty]

In the devil's arena, rage and war are causing chaos
A deadly drama takes place before our eyes
We are crying sadly tears hopelessly in despair

On the wings of agony, greed will spread his wings of evil
To shade humanity from the purifying sun
We are living in a darkened world, honestly, do we care?

The loneliness we fear inside we tried to hide
Behind a smile of an innocent child
It's a tragedy that we refuse to see
The lost conscience of humanity

At the crossroads of forever we choose a violent path
Into the void we follow and learn the dance of death
Forever missing souls are crying of damnation
Blinded by misery waiting for salvation
It's a tragedy that we refuse to see
The lost conscience of humanity

On the wings of agony greed will spread his wings of evil
To shade humanity from the purifying sun
We are living in a darkened world, honestly, do we care?

The loneliness we fear inside we tried to hide
Behind a smile of an innocent child
It's a tragedy that we refuse to see
The lost conscience of humanity

It's a tragedy that we refuse to see
The lost conscience of humanity
