Another day a mortal scene
Will the Keeper find a place he needs to calm
Where his souls are free they feel as one
Silently he carries on to a place ... 

Full of faith yet so afraid
A tale yet it feels as the one like the one
He has seen before can't take no more
His mind reflects the future to a place where he belongs

Worlds align relief not closing in
The final stage no place to hide within
Through different eyes

Through different eyes they see the light
No unsolved mysteries
Through different eyes they feel
Untainted mortality

Anguish them who don't understand
Ignore the ones who try to make the Keeper live a lie or sin
In silence he battles on to fight not to right the wrong

World of lies relief is closing in
The final stage no faith to twist the sin
Through different eyes

Through different eyes they see the light
No unsolved mysteries
Through different eyes they feel
Untainted mortality

"The miracle you seek a treasure for the weak"
Replies from skies above twisted love for the immortal Creator

Through different eyes they see the light
No unsolved mysteries
Through different eyes they see the light
Untainted mortality
Through different eyes they see the light
Untainted mortality
