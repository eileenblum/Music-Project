[Lyrics by Emo Suripatty]
[Music by Minggus Gaspersz]

Now I can see clearly 
The fortune I have found
Never fades when falling down

It's a world supremacy
An inhuman day again
You will not believe my friend

Forced to feel free
Gathered wisdom around
Broke into pieces while burning down

The taste of loneliness
The power of the blind
You will never understand

Forced to feel free
Gathered wisdom around
Broke into pieces while burning down

So you created this whole world of hatred 
Now I know I was destined to find
The rebellion's force within ...
