[Lyrics by Minggus Gaspersz &amp; Willem Verwoert]
[Music by Emo Suripatty &amp; Minggus Gaspersz]

Into the void lonely and cold
Your tears created this sad world
This is the place for one that needs
Where broken hearts can bleed

Under a shaded moon
You're wandering around

Out of the ashes into the dark
I'll always guide you in peace and war
Now and forever it's you and I

Into the night together we fly
There may be no tomorrow
I'll give you warmth, without, you will die
Just close your lonely eyes

Under a shaded moon
You're wandering around

Out of the ashes into the dark
I'll always guide you in peace and war
Now and forever it's you and ...

Do you hear the angels sing?
When we make love on a golden wing
For every time that we've touched the sky
A shooting star passed by

Under a shaded moon
We're wandering around

Out of the ashes into the dark
I'll always guide you in peace and war
Now and forever it's you and ...

Do you hear the angels sing?
When we make love on a golden wing
For every time that we've touched the sky
A shooting star passed by

Do you hear the angels sing?
When we make love on a golden wing
For every time that we've touched the sky
A shooting star passed by

Out of the ashes into the dark
I'll always guide you in peace and war
Now and forever it's you and I
