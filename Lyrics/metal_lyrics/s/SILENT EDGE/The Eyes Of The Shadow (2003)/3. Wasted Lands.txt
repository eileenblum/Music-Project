[Lyrics by Minggus Gaspersz]
[Music by Minggus Gaspersz &amp; Emo Suripatty]

Far away beyond any man's imagination lies a wasted land scarred by battlefields
A remorseless warrior living in damnation standing in defense at the passageways
A crystal palace the temple of his soul lying in the shadow of his holy sword
No mercy only the chosen ones survive 
Cursed with being judge and jury over mortal lives

Through empty eyes he shows no emotion
But deep inside ... 

A naked child is crying in the darkness bruised and battered by his violent past
Lying on the ground without making any sound trying to understand this fake reality
Faded pictures what ever used to be lying in the shadow of all that is gone
No mercy only the chosen ones survive 
Cursed with being judge and jury over mortal lives

Through empty eyes he shows no emotion
Hiding the essence of his lonely soul

Captured by the demon's light he rides through eternal nights
His faith is sealed forever time Prince of Wasted Lands

Captured by the demon's light he rides through eternal nights
His faith is sealed forever time Prince of Wasted Lands

Far away beyond any man's imagination lies a wasted land scarred by battlefields
A remorseless warrior living in damnation standing in defense at the passageways
No mercy only the chosen ones survive 
Cursed with being judge and jury over mortal lives

Through empty eyes he shows no emotion
Hiding the essence of his fragile soul

Far away beyond any man's imagination lies a wasted land scarred by battlefields
Far away beyond any man's imagination lies a wasted land
