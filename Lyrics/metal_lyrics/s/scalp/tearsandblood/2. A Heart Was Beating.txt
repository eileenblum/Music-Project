I hear beats
I hear an ardent heart
Desired in dreams when touching your reflection
I sense your heat when in regret we part.
I heard beats but they leave e'en recollections.
I hear beats
The sounds of broken still
Anxiety's steps pursue my tired reason
They burn my soul and then embrace by chill
They tear my heart - to bits they smash my vision ...
