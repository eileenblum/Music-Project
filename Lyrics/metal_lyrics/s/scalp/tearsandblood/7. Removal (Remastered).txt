Winding way takes me to the river
Summer smell of pine wood.
Feeds and wakes my memory.
I already hear a waltz of meadow voices
My meeting will mean beginning...
I'm looking into the sky
And listening as the clouds speak
"We are so beautiful", they say to me
They are inviting me.
But I can't raise to you
"Get to know yourself, and you will raise.
I cry because I don't know guess
"We're you so you're we", they say to me.
So I wonderful cloud and I am eternal.
I remove into the distance by the will of the wind,
By the will of a free wind,
Which was born in space.
The beautiful birds arise before my face
I feel pride for my sense
And the world of Earth is before me.
Goodbye my beautiful friends
And my past love.
Yes I want to forget my dreams
And sorrowful screams ,
The beautiful birds arise before my eyes
I feel the pride for the aim.
My soul merge with NATURE...
Invisible threads wrap me up...
Goodbye my flowers and woods
And my past love...
