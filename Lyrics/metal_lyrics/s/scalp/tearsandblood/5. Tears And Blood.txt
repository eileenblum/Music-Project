Call the pain again inside my wound
Pour sea water and then I remember
Your ocean of feelings
Filled up with drops, up with drops
Of my tears and blood.
Tears and blood
Divide my soul and sky
Devotion and solitude
Are moved into my broken heart.
In drops of blood I see
Description of my destiny
I keep my self in quite
When looking into my eyes.
Passing through the cover of your universe
I'm breaking tenderness by traces of memory
Not come true dreams of mine
Are flying to ocean.
