Attend to the quiet dirge
It's the descant of life
With mourner I weep
The grief is plucking on the chords of his soul
As a tear is sailing on his pale skin
Through downcast eyes
The wells of water overflow
This cry a constant harmony
Oh god hear the verse of sorrow
Still the tones of the bleak
Solemn play in his ears forever
More cry turns to quiet dirge
All that's remaining
Is a downhearted silence
Earth to a repository
Of mourners turn
But the verse (of sorrow)
Still carries on
