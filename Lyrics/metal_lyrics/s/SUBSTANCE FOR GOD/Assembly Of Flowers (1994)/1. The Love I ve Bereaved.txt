Even a plaint ode couldn't recite
The feeling of a mourner who bereaved his love
And the golden mansion of the sky
Slowly withers
As I regard at the waves
Flowing from the serene oceans
And I shed a tear for thee
As on that disconsolate day
When I laid a thousand roses
On the white marble thy
I'm dressing the tomb with flowers
I will never cease crying (over You)
My tears are watering like the dew
From the leaves, when I recall at her
Wherever I You are I will always remember thee
Oh, how could I forget
The night is weaving the longing in my heart
My tears are
When I bereaved You my
Now a lonely star is lightning
In heaven for her memorial
