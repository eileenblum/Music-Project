All the things that my eyes saw
You will keep to see tomorrow
Through tears
Let me remove your tears

I enter to this life with a tear
And I depart with one
I didn't want to leave
But it's the will of god

It's the will of god
Lord !!!

I wither quicker than the rose
And I know that it's all over
And already past
You know and didn't say a thing
Why you invert our joy to a grievous

.. farewell
Is it the final farewell?

So let those I've loved
A will to keep living without me
While I'm lying on the bed
... on the bed of earth

But the days still elapse
The more, they're passing slower
Your place within my heart overgrow
Try to hold the memory of you
Worth tall keep undying

Oh, please outcry your tears
And bring back the smile
that was almost forgotten

Father !!!
Why, you didn't say
That I will never see

... never see them again

But I hope

That one heaven receives us
... receives us all

All the things that my eyes saw
You will keep to see tomorrow
Through tears

Let time remove your tears
Your tears !!!

So let those I've loved
A will to keep living without me
While I'm lying on the bed
... lying on the bed
of earth

How long shall these things be?
