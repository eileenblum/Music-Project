[Bonus Track]Woah-oah-oh, woah-oah-oh-oh
Woah-oah-oh, woah-oah-oh-oh

This time, I'm serious, this time
This time, I'm serious, this time it's serious
It's as bad as it looks, this hurts just like it should
The perfect place at the perfect time
Where I was yours and baby you were mine
You gave me something to believe in, but I'm not believing

Just run, (Just run),
You've won, I'm broken, it's done
Is this, (Is this),
Is this your idea of fun?
When dealing with the pro in breaking hearts
Just run (Just run),
Just run.

Woah-oah-oh, woah-oah-oh-oh
Woah-oah-oh, woah-oah-oh-oh

Does anybody else feel this way?
Does everybody else hurt the same?
I just have to go, (Go!)
Run away from this town!
Change my name of the grave from your burial ground!
I just want you to know (Know!)
I had to let you go!

Just run, (Just run),
You've won, I'm broken, it's done
Is this, (Is this),
Is this your idea of fun?
When dealing with the pro in breaking hearts
Just run (Just run),
Just run.
We were golden, but now we're broken
You're the artist of our destruction
We were golden, but now we're broken
You're the artist of our destruction
We were golden, but now we're broken
(Before you took the world from me, before you axe the wounds at sea)
You're the artist of our destruction
(With your hands around my neck, I don't have a heart worth breaking!)

I'll run, you've won, I'm broken, it's done
Is this, is this your idea of..

Just run, (Just run),
You've won, I'm broken, it's done
Is this, (Is this),
Is this your idea of fun?
When dealing with the pro in breaking hearts
Just run (Just run),
Just run.
Just run, (Just run),
You've won, (You've won!)
I'm broken, it's done
Is this, (Is this),
Is this your idea of fun?
When dealing with the pro in breaking hearts
Just run (Just run),
Just run.
