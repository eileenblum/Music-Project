Take me back to where we started
Let's erase every memory and make it so we never existed

These days will only end in shame
Did you ever believe we'd be this way?
Tearing down the structures that we made
I think we need to make a change

You can twist and turn me inside out
But you'll never stretch what I'm about
And everything you let slip
Is pushing forward to a repeat exit

Take back what we've done, we can start it all over

Take me back to where we started
Let's erase every memory and make it so we never existed

Looks like we've been here before
We're throwing punches, but we're missing all the marks
I say we need to take a second to analyze what we've been missing

Every time you cry
I try to hide it but a piece of me dies
Every time we try
We always end up at each others throats
I can't escape who I am

Take me back to where we started
Let's erase every memory and make it so we never existed

Don't try to hide all your demons inside
Let me see who you really are
Don't pretend everything's alright
We knew we were dead from the start
I don't expect you to understand
It's time to take my life in my own hands
I finally realize I need a fresh start
We were always meant to fall apart

We were always meant to fall apart

Take me back to where we started
Let's erase every memory and make it so we never existed

Every time you cry
I try to hide it but a piece of me dies
