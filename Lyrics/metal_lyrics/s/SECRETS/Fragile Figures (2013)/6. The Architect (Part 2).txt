You never trust in me, and it's bringing me down 
Don't put your faith in me, I might not let you down

Why can't you see?
I'm now the man I want to be
Why can't you see?
You're not the man I want to be

If I live my life like you want me to
Would you be proud of me?
If I could prove to you by living in your shoes
Could you be proud of me?

Footsteps aren't always meant to be followed
I have a life to live
And when I'm gone you'll only have yourself to blame

If I live my life like you want me to
Would you be proud of me?
If I could prove to you by living in your shoes
Could you be proud of me?
I don't have to sleep to live out my dreams 
I'm wide awake to the fact that you reject me

If I live my life like you want me to
Would you be proud of me?

Why could you never put your faith in me?
Allow me to dream

Footsteps aren't always meant to be followed

I've wasted life on these wasted years
Trying to be everything you want
Pride is such a loaded word

If I live my life like you want me to
Would you be proud of me
If I could prove to you by living in your shoes
Could you be proud of me
I don't have to sleep to live out my dreams 
I'm wide awake to the fact that you reject me
If I live my life like you want me to
Would you be proud of me?

Why can't you see?
You're not the man I want to be!
