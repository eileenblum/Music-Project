I feel so alone
On these vacant roads
My heart can only break so many times
Before I lose my faith in all mankind
These scars simply serve to remind me
Why I still pretend everything is all right

This world is dark but you are not alone
It's never too late for a fresh start, a new home
Nothing is set in stone

I hear these voices in my head
Over and over and over again
They keep telling me
You're better off dead

I'm giving up, I'm giving up on youÂ 

This world is dark but you are not alone
It's never too late for a fresh start, a new home
Nothing is set in stone

We are, we are the unforgiving
We are, we are the hopeless in love
Now that I need you, you're nowhere around

Everyone that I have loved is goneÂ 

This world is dark but you are not alone
It's never too late for a fresh start, a new home
Nothing is set in stone
