So here's my honest opinion
I think we're way past forgiveness
To make up now is a sin, so let me say it again
How could you expect a boy like me
To ever stand a chance against a girl like you?
But don't give up on me just yet

I thought I needed you
But no one needs someone who cant choose
Between true love, or just lustÂ 
I guess the worlds not enough

I remember all the days,Â 
Granted, grief and the pain lasted weeks
Hope seemed so out of reach
How could you expect a boy like me
To ever stand a chance against a girl like you?

I thought I needed you
But no one needs someone who cant choose
Between true love, or just lustÂ 
I guess the worlds not enough

You always looked better lying on your back
Than you did lying to my face

And I had your back against the wall
You lied through your teeth just to see me fall
So many countless days I spent calling your name
I feel nothing but shame

I thought I needed you
But no one needs someone who cant choose
Between true love, or a fuck
I guess the worlds not enough
