This heart is yours so take it as you please
but if you walk away, remember
I need that heart to breathe

I always try so hard to be her right
and all she does is fight the reasons why
the future always seemed so bright
I don't know why she fears the light

you always try to hide and cover up the hurt inside
but I see through your lies
you know i'm what you need and I need you to breathe
so wont you take

this heart is yours so take it as you please
but if you walk away, remember
I need that heart to breathe

oh, if you've seen what ive seen you should know
you'd know its not a good thing to let go
three years of constant devotion
are gone with our destructive emotions.
our love that once was lays in waste
but i still offer you

this heart is yours so take it as you please
but if you walk away, remember
I need that heart to breathe

I need you now more than you know, why wont you come home?
I need my heart to breathe

theres a part of me that still cant sleep at night
without you in my side
its getting harder and harder to berate
the farther and farther you get from me

this heart is yours so take it as you please
but if you walk away, remember
I need that heart to breathe
