We're the abandoned kids, we escape this life 
Through over counter prescriptions, and under counted addictions
We're begging for attention, but nobody listens
So ill slit my wrists and take these pills
To make them feel the way I feel

Take me away to a place that I know
A place I hide from the monster inside
Someone please provide me with a reason to live on

Hold out your hands, take it all in
This is now your mistake, so carry the burden

If only you could see
The toll this has taken on me
This is who I am, it's not who I wanted to be

Take me away to a place that I know
Someone please provide me with a reason to live on

Hold out your hands, take it all in
This is now your mistake, so carry the burden

Maybe if you would have loved me you'd still have me

Hold out your hands, take it all in
This is now your mistake, so carry the burden

This is who I am not who I wanted to be
