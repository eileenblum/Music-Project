We are the broken the haunted the bleedingÂ 
We are the children who's ears that you're feeding
We built this houseÂ with our blood sweat and tearsÂ 
It's a home for the lonely, so bring us your fears

You're not as hopeless as you think
You mean everything
Let music take away the pain
To be your infinite escape
You're not as hopeless as you think (the bond of unity)
Let music take away the pain

You lack the heart the soul the dreamÂ 
You lack the courage and everything between
Give up the act your tyranny won't get you in
Before you judge me you better think again

If we stand together, we can burn this motherfucker down

You're not as hopeless as you think
You mean everything
Let music take away the pain
To be your infinite escape
You're not as hopeless as you think (the bond of unity)
Let music take away the pain
To be your infinite escape

This world has taken so much from me butÂ 
I refuse to let it keep me down I'll always be free
These are my brothers, we have each other
And that's all I needÂ 

You're not as hopeless as you think
You mean everything
Let music take away the pain
To be your infinite escape
You're not as hopeless as you think (the bond of unity)
Let music take away the pain
To be your infinite escape
