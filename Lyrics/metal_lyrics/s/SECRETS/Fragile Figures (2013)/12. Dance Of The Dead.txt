[Bonus Track]I've broken my bones, sat there and listened for you
I keep on falling
I'm on the way down I hope you'll catch me soon,
I hope you'll catch me soon

Attention to love, to life, to all that's right
I'm wondering why you're letting me fall so far
From what I've chased my entire life

Through the darkest of nights, with no hope for a light
I bled for you (I bled for you)
When you were broken, alone and you needed me most
I bled for you (I bled for you)

So
Please give me one good reason I should keep believing in a goddamn thing when
This thing inside of me, I've never seen
It's telling me to give up, move on and forget my life
But in the end you'll see this is the difference between you and me

I've broken my bones, sat there and listened for you
I keep on falling
I'm on the way down I hope you'll catch me soon,
But you're not coming
I've broken my bones, sat there and listened for you
I keep on falling
I'm on the way down I hope you'll catch me soon,
I hope you'll catch me soon

Shut us out from more
Shut us out from more

I'll carry on, through the bitter days
I'll carry on, through this hell you pave
I try to stand tall, I try to stand tall
But it's so hard to live when there's nothing at all

It's never enough, should I give up now?
It's never enough, you shouldn't give up now
You drowned me alone, I'll carry on, carry on
You drowned me alone, I'll carry on, carry on

I've broken my bones, sat there and listened for you
I keep on falling
I'm on the way down I hope you'll catch me soon,
But you're not coming
I've broken my bones, sat there and listened for you
I keep on falling
I'm on the way down I hope you'll catch me soon,
I hope you'll catch me soon

We struggle at best, but keep wanting more.
You can't reach the top without feeling the floor.
We struggle at best, but keep wanting more.
You can't reach the top without feeling the floor.
We struggle at best, but keep wanting more.
You can't reach the top without feeling the floor.
Fuck!
You can't reach the top, you can't reach the top
You can't reach the top without feeling the floor
