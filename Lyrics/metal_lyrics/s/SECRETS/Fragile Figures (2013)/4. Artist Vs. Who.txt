I'm a mess, I confess
I'm happy to see this

It must be hard looking at yourself in the mirrorÂ 
When her reflection is no longer thereÂ 
I know it's hard to swallow like the pills that follow
When you see her standing next to me,
A better man than you'll ever be

Nothing looks right in your life
You were always meant to find broken dreams
So it seems maybe you should hide from this life
Don't you fight,Â you know you wont win this time
Just give up for the rest of us

I thought we were rid of youÂ 
And you can bet your ass I'm gonna see this through
I'm gonna haunt you
The sad thing is you think you've won

You can't run (fuck you) you'll pay for what you've done
You can't hide (fuck you) the wars already won

Nothing looks right in your life
You were always meant to find broken dreams
So it seems maybe you should hide from this life
Don't you fight,Â you know you wont win this time
Just give up for the rest of us

They say living well is a mans best revenge
But to a man who lives for nothing,Â 
I say to you, you'll feel my wrath

A coward sneaks to death, while the brave live on

Nothing looks right in your life
You were always meant to find broken dreams
So it seems maybe you should hide from this life
Don't you fight,Â you know you wont win this time
Just give up for the rest of us
