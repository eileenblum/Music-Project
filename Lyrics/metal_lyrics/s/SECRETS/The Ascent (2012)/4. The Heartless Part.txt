Honestly why donât you just run?
Make sure you cover your tracks
And hope my lies lose your scent
I think youâre better off making a swift escape
I think you should leave, and just stop loving me

You know my secret
Theres nothing to show
But nothing changes when you wake up tomorrow
Were you expecting a gentleman?
I'm not, Iâll end your life

I canât change Iâm built to stay the same
Maybe you should learn how to love a machine
Being young is all I know
Let the good times roll

Oh, you can take me anywhere you wanna go
Theres a love at home, but Iâm on the road
So no one needs to know
Lets kill all the lights
And what goes on now who fucking knows
Love is not a war its a god damn massacre

I canât change Iâm built to stay the same
Maybe you should learn how to love a machine
Being young is all I know
Let the good times roll

This is my last attempt to let you out of this place
Full of sex, lies, and sorrow
Embarrassed and destroyed
Your heart is my favorite toy
It wonât be beating tomorrow

Iâll watch you burn bitch.

I canât change Iâm built to stay the same
Maybe you should learn how to love a machine
Being young is all I know. Let the good times roll
