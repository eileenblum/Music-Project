I hate this monster inside me
My bodyâs breaking down
Iâm alone and I cant breathe
You wouldnât understand, no chance
Cause I feel so fucking dead

Take the last drink, the bottle's gone
Washed down my throat, Iâm full, but empty
Guess Iâm not the man that I wanna be
The barâs my only friend, and itâs killing me
Iâm not losing this fight, oh wait, I guess I just lost it last night
Guess Iâm not the man that I wanna be
The barâs my only friend and itâs killing me

Frail boy with a shallow mind
Iâm not quite sure that Iâm the type of guy
You should be hanging around
I tend to let people down

This is the last time getting high
Promises sound just like last night

I donât know anything anymore
Help me regain control

Iâve been dependent for so long
I need to leave
Iâve been dependent for so long
I need to live (again)

Take the last drink, the bottle's gone
Washed down my throat, Iâm full, but empty
Guess Iâm not the man that I wanna be
The barâs my only friend, and itâs killing me
Iâm not losing this fight, oh wait, I guess I just lost it last night
Guess Iâm not the man that I wanna be
The barâs my only friend and itâs killing me

Iâm drinking whisky like water
Cause water does nothing for me
Iâm full of pain I need it more
Iâm as empty as the whisky bottle on my floor

This is the end
I donât need this anymore
Taking control
Is finding strength to let it go

Iâm drinking whisky like water
Cause water does nothing for me
