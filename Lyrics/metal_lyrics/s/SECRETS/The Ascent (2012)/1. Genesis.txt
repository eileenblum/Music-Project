You think youâre better than everyone
But in the end youâre like a coward holding a gun
So keep running your dirty mouth
You still donât know, what youâre talking about
I used your hating
Turned it around to motivate me
Your words so condescending
But truth be told they keep me going

Iâll use analogies, and simple harmonies
To tell you youâre changing and its not a good thing
I only wish you knew the good inside of you
Could conquer the darkness and your heart could stop this

Abandoned, shattered alone
Your doubts are screaming at the top of their lungs
Ill pay no mind to their songs
Ill let you live an empty life all alone

Iâd love to see you try to stop me
You really think this is easy, right? (fuck)
Youâll never know
Cause youâll never even try this

Iâll use analogies, and simple harmonies
To tell you youâre changing and its not a good thing
I only wish you knew the good inside of you
Could conquer the darkness and your heart could stop this

Abandoned, shattered alone
Your doubts are screaming at the top of their lungs

Step by step
Youâre just a face
Step by step
You fade away

Iâll bring you hell
