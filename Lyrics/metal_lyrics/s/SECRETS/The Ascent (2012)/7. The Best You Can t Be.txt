Father my father, whyâd you run away from your boy?
It's a shame youâd rather play
When you had the perfect chance to stay

Itâs safe to say, you never cared anyway
But one day, youâll come running back (to me)
Iâm not the same, thats all I can say
So donât expect me to take you back

So if you donât want me
Then whyâd you plant your seed?
You could have raised an intelligent boy
One day youâll see
Now look at me, your abandoned seed
Iâve become an intelligent man, youâre the enemy

So, are you happy with yourself?
Youâre just a cowardice fiend
Addicted to things irrelevant
When I was the one you should have supplied your love into
I guess thatâs something you canât do
I guess it's easy to leave and harder to be a man
Of all of these things I need you to know I hate you dad

So if you donât want me
Then whyâd you plant your seed?
You could have raised an intelligent boy
One day youâll see
Now look at me, your abandoned seed
Iâve become an intelligent man, youâre the enemy

I waited so many years
But you always disappear
I'm sick of your lies
God damn I hope they eat you alive!

You wonât have much to love
And its all because you were my father
Now youâre the one that I donât trust

Father oh Father how could you leave me alone?

So if you donât want me
Then whyâd you plant your seed?
You could have raised an intelligent boy
One day youâll see
Now look at me, your abandoned seed
Iâve become an intelligent man, youâre the enemy

Father oh Father how could you leave me alone?
