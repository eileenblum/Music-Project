I take it back,
this time Iâm holding back, nothing.
Everyone, will see your colors.

I tried to turn the pages for a better way,
but you're still there,
like its yesterday, everyday.

See, where your chapter ends,
mine begins.
And to my friends beside me,
this is it.

Hold your ground,
they cannot bring us down.

Take shape to what life gives you,
learn how to bend not break.
Somehow it seems we lost you,
gone at the scene,
youâre torn at the seams.
Youâre a joke,
this punchlineâs about you.

You said you live for this,
it's clear that you donât.
We see right through it,
you're such a fucking joke.

Thanks to you,
we havenât made it by now.
Look at you,
just a failure now.

Take shape to what life gives you,
learn how to bend not break.
Somehow it seems we lost you,
gone at the scene,
youâre torn at the seams.
Youâre a joke,
this punchlineâs about you.

This is the path we choose,
you can't change us.
This is the path we choose,
we won't change

This is the path we choose,
you can't change us.
This is the road we paved,
we won't change.

I know, that we have something to prove.
And now, we all have nothing to lose.

Take shape to what life gives you,
learn how to bend not break.
Somehow it seems we lost you,
gone at the scene,
youâre torn at the seams.
Youâre a joke,
this punchlineâs about you.

Hereâs a toast to us,
we held our ground.
