What are you waiting for?
Why wonât you make a sound?
Boy donât you hold back
Son donât you slow down
Your family sings melodies
Why wonât you listen boy?
Your family sings melodies
Why wonât you listen boy?

Try to remember 
The guilt will never go
You already know
I'm not the first to say
The world is yours to hold
Why wont you fight?
Why wont you make this right?
Put up your fists
Take back your fucking life

Now is the time to get up 
And change your life

What are you waiting for?
Why wonât you make a sound?
Boy donât you hold back
Son donât you slow down
Your family sings melodies
Why wonât you listen boy?
Your family sings melodies
Why wonât you listen boy?

Full speed ahead
If you trip, lifeâs a bitch
So get up and do it again
I wouldnât say to leave your dreams at bay
Why wont you fight?
Why wont you make this right?
Put up your fists
Take back your fucking life

Now is the time to get up 
And change your life

What are you waiting for?
Why wonât you make a sound?
Boy donât you hold back
Son donât you slow down
Your family sings melodies
Why wonât you listen boy?
Your family sings melodies
Why wonât you listen boy?

This is in my bones
This is the only way I feel at home
I wont let go, it's all I know

Your family sings melodies
Why wonât you listen boy?
