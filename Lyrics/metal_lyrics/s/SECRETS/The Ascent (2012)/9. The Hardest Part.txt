This heart is yours (It will only beat for you)
My body too (My life for you)
Youâre the only one ill be kissinâ
Youâre the only one ill be missinâ

Oh my love, can you make any sense of this?
Its certain that I exist only to hold you so close
And if you break my bones, I wonât let go

Tell me what you want, ill do anything
Just to keep you in my arms
Leave me, be happy
But it tears my heart apart

This heart is yours (It will only beat for you)
My body too (My life for you)
Youâre the only one ill be kissinâ
Youâre the only one ill be missinâ
Youâll be my honey baby
And Iâll be your little machine
Youâre the only one ill be kissinâ
Youâre the only one ill be missinâ

Only you, youâre what I choose
And I can be alone in this case
But I donât mind, no I donât mind

Iâm your machine, ill work for you
If youâll be my queen, Iâll do what you need me to
Me and you will burn the whole world
This love massacre (so fuck all those other girls)

This heart is yours (It will only beat for you)
My body too (My life for you)
Youâre the only one ill be kissinâ
Youâre the only one ill be missinâ
Youâll be my honey baby
And Iâll be your little machine
Youâre the only one ill be kissinâ
Youâre the only one ill be missinâ

How can you just fucking go?
I put my faith in you

This heart is yours
My body too
Youâre the only one ill be kissinâ
Youâre the only one ill be missinâ

This heart is yours (It will only beat for you)
My body too (My life for you)
Youâre the only one ill be kissinâ
Youâre the only one ill be missinâ
Youâll be my honey baby
And Iâll be your little machine
Youâre the only one ill be kissinâ
Youâre the only one ill be missinâ
Youâll be my honey baby
