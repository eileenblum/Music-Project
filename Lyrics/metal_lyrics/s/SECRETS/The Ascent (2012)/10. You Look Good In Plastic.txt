I donât see me when i look in the mirror
Itâs someone else staring back at me
Iâm a ghost in a walking corpse
Who is haunted by who I canât be

This is all because of the Harryâs code
Itâs all I need to know
Your screams, are like music to my heartless being

Because Iâm making up my mind
For the lost time that I paid for (so close so far away)
You know my method isnât kind
But still ill find what I came for (what are you waiting for?)
Take out the enemy, get back my sanity
Brick wall defense, suspense is killing me
Cause everything I love is what I kill for
(look whoâs laughing now, so look whoâs laughing now)

I am your fate, Iâm your destruction
Iâll break the teeth right out of your mouth

I canât control this, but no one knows it
So this is how I let it all out

Brace yourself

Because Iâm making up my mind
For the lost time that I paid for (so close so far away)
You know my method isnât kind
But still ill find what I came for (what are you waiting for?)
Take out the enemy, get back my sanity
Brick wall defense, suspense is killing me
Cause everything I love is what I kill for
(look whoâs laughing now, so look whoâs laughing now)

This is your final hour, look what youâve done
Tied up in plastic, and thereâs nowhere to run
