Three can keep a secret,
if two of them are dead,
Iâll bury all the pages,
to keep my words unsaid.

Through thick or thin, Iâm holding it.
Loose lips sink our ships.
Lips are sewn shut

Hush baby donât tell,
lets keep this inside.
I got a secret,
I wont let it out this time.
Your grave gets deeper,
all the secrets you hide,
so let it out let it out,
but no one will hear your cries.

Iâll watch them fall,
come crawling out your mouth.
I want to save myself,
for the last few minutes.

Iâll tear this place apart with every intention,
of burning every bridge I ever stepped foot on.

Hush baby donât tell,
lets keep this inside.
I got a secret,
I wont let it out this time.
Your grave gets deeper,
all the secrets you hide,
so let it out let it out,
but no one will hear your cries.

I have these demons,
I keep them inside,
believe what you want,
but its probably a lie.
one makes it two,
two makes it three,
three makes a crowd so your coming with me.

Iâm sinking faster,
and its hard for me to breath.
My whole world crumbles before me,
as Iâm left here on my kneeâs.
