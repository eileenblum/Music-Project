Why won't you come out,
of hiding, lets get this straight.
Is it the passion thats been lacking,
what can we do.
I need some medicine,
to help me get inside of you.

We are nothing but sinking ships,
I canât save you cause Iâm falling into the ground.

Girl please come back from the place that you hide,
how about tonight?
I wanna see you lets get out of here.
Take back, take back my heart,
I donât mind.
Cause if you're not mine,
I see no point in even having one.

Take a look at me,
Iâm the one whoâs sinking and,
falling faster,
in a matter,
of seconds.

Break me,
youâll never, youâll never break me down.

Girl please come back from the place that you hide,
how about tonight?
I wanna see you lets get out of here.
Take back take back my heart,
I donât mind.
Cause if you're not mine,
I see no point in even having one.

Take back, take back my heart,
I donât mind.
(Why won't you stop this hiding)
(Why won't you come out baby?)
