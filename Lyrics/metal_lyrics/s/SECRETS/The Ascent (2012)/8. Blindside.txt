Iâll end this awkward silence
When I break apart your rib cage

You must be scared of your reflection in the mirror
Weâre so tired of all the lies, now our visionâs getting clearer

I wont lay victim to your betrayal and lies
Thatâs why I moved on but you just sit there and cry
Youâre the one who said that you were better than this
That we were holding you down
Like anchors to your ships
All you can say now
I just wish you would fucking grow up
All I can say now
I just wish that you would fucking give up!

All your money couldnât buy you respect
I dug the hole, you filled the grave with your last breath

You must be scared of your reflection in the mirror
Weâre so tired of all the lies, now our visionâs getting clearer
I donât see how you always run around
Never really caring who you gave a fuck about!
I'm sure that someday
Youâll be left with nothing but a suitcase of mistakes

Youâve burned the bridge that you stand on
And thereâs no way for you to hold on

How the fuck do you still have friends?
You can lie, to yourself, like it's fine
But now youâre dead, youâre dead to me!

Youâre looking pretty lonely and all of us feel sorry
But youâre gonna pay for all your mistakes
I wish this could have ended better
But you're just not that clever
So run along and go be fake

You must be scared of your reflection in the mirror
Weâre so tired of all the lies, now our visionâs getting clearer
I donât see how you always run around
Never really caring who you gave a fuck about!
I'm sure that someday
Youâll be left with nothing but a suitcase of mistakes
