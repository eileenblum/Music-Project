["Punk Goes Pop 5" compilation track][Chorus]
I donât know, where youâre going
Or when youâre coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I donât know, where youâre going
Just get your ass back home

We both knew this type of life didnât come with instructions
So Iâm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact
When you call and I donât even know what city Iâm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I donât recall
Itâs like my lifeâs on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldnât be long,
That was last November, now Decemberâs almost gone
Iâd apologize but I donât realize what Iâm doing wrong

[Chorus]
I donât know, where youâre going
Or when youâre coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I donât know, where youâre going
Just get your ass back home

And youâve been nothing but amazing
And I never take that for granted
Half of these birds would have flew the coop
But you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me,
Every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standing o âcause theyâd a just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we donât hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
Weâll just drive by and keep waving
Cause you and I above all that
Just let them wallow in it
Now they all choked up, yuck
Cause they be swallowing it

[Chorus]
I donât know, where youâre going
Or when youâre coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I donât know, where youâre going
Just get your ass back home

No one hold me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I keep doing this
Weâll be alright in the end
Trust that
We put the us in trust, baby
Aww, letâs go

I donât care what youâre after
As long as Iâm the one, no
I donât care why youâre leaving
Youâll miss me when youâre gone

[Chorus]
I donât know, where youâre going
Or when youâre coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I donât know, where youâre going
Just get your ass back home.
