[from "Renditions" EP]This isn't how it's supposed to be
This isn't how we're supposed to treat each other
Remember when we only had love for one another?
Now it's gone
Like leaves against the wind and weather
Life's teaching lessons and I've learned that I should never love another

Can we start saying the things that we used to say or go back to the way that we used to be?
So close together
No, never

This isn't how it's supposed to be
This isn't how we're supposed to treat each other
Remember when we only felt free?
Now all we feel is empty
The good feeling's gone
There's nothing left for us to hold on
Life's teaching lessons and I've learned that the best of you isn't best for me so what's best for us is to move on

Can we start saying the things that we used to say or go back to the way that we used to be?
So close together
No, never

This isn't how it's supposed to be
And this isn't how we're supposed to treat each other
Remember when we only felt free?
Now all we feel is empty
The good feeling's gone

Can we start saying the things that we used to say or go back to the way that we used to be?
So close together
No, never.
