I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
Pissed off at myself for what Iâve done
Iâve been down this path
Iâve felt the wrath of the sins from my past
It burns so deep
What Iâve done to you Iâll never escape
It burns so deep
Youâre everything Iâll never be

I need to open my eyes to see again to see the way I was back then
Gotta find my way, gotta find a way back again
Tear open my chest to dig around and tell me why Iâm such a mess
I got a fear that my heart got up and left

Oh Iâm somewhere drifting hanging out with regret
We're laughing making jokes of past things I did
I call apathy my one and only friend
Keep a distance I could be contagious

Iâm a little twisted and in dire need of assistance
I wonât quit these habits if I know I can't have it
Because, because Iâm sick, Iâm a dick
Iâm quick with my words
Draw on me you'll get hurt
Iâm scum, Iâm numb
There's nothing you can do to me that I haven't done

I need to open my eyes to see again to see the way I was back then
Gotta find my way, gotta find a way back again
Tear open my chest to dig around and tell me why Iâm such a mess
I got a fear that my heart got up and left

I am a shadow the hollowed out shell of a man that was
You're my mistake
You're my mistake
Iâm the villain
Of this metropolis
Iâll sink this ship
Iâll burn this bridge
Iâll end what little life we're in

I need to open my eyes to see again to see the way I was back then
Gotta find my way, gotta find a way back again
Tear open my chest to dig around and tell me why Iâm such a mess
I got a fear that my heart got up and left

Does it make sense to feel so spent?
Get this off my chest
Has the best of me came and went
Is this feeling passing? I keep asking
Is this temporary? Please be temporary

They say it gets better with time
Well it's been time enough and I want to live my life
I let you down now you've got me on hold
I just want to go home
