Just let it go...
Could you give me some time to think?
Another drink, I think that should suffice
Could you give me a moment, a moment between me and my vice
Just a taste to take away my thoughts and how I feel
Could you give me a moment?
This is my appeal
Iâm thinking short term the big pictureâs blurred, but living in the moment just hurts

Drunk days, drunk nights
Iâll be just fine, but you know thatâs not the case tonight
These things take time
Iâll be just fine
Every ounce weighs me down
I won't let myself drown

It's just a phase it will go away
It's not a phase it's here to stay
Iâm selling lies, but no ones buying, like I could quit anytime
This addictionâs got me stuck, but donât drop a line Iâll be just fine

I feel empty and alone
Hoping this bottle takes me home
I feel hopeless and afraid
While I drown my life away

Drunk days, drunk nights
Iâll be just fine, but you know thatâs not the case tonight
These things take time
Iâll be just fine
Every ounce weighs me down
I won't let myself drown

Let this go
Just let it go
