You're dodging each reflection
Mirrors haunt your soul, shake your bones
I think you're missing something darling leave that hole it's not your home
Of all the troubles that you worry over leave those thoughts alone

You keep losing grip on what you love
You hold tight, but it's never tight enough
You're losing everything
You'll earn the love you want when you learn to love yourself
You keep losing sight of what went wrong
It plays back, but the visions left you lost
You're losing everything
You'll earn the love you want when you learn to love yourself
Forgive me father
For I have sinned
I met the devil on my shoulder
Then I let him in
When no one could save me
He said he'd defend me
And with no sign from above
Could you fucking blame me
Iâm fighting myself
Iâm going crazy again
Iâm just so damn tired of your voice in my head
Slow down, slow down
This world will make you think it's all about what you see

You keep losing grip on what you love
You hold tight, but it's never tight enough
You're losing everything
You'll earn the love you want when you learn to love yourself
You keep losing sight of what went wrong
It plays back, but the visions left you lost
You're losing everything
You'll earn the love you want when you learn to love yourself

I wonder how long that you can go on believing you're a stranger
That you'll never belong in your own skin
I'm here to tell you you're far from nothing

You keep losing grip on what you love
You hold tight, but it's never tight enough
You're losing everything
You'll earn the love you want when you learn to love yourself
You keep losing sight of what went wrong
It plays back, but the visions left you lost
You're losing everything
You'll earn the love you want when you learn to love yourself
