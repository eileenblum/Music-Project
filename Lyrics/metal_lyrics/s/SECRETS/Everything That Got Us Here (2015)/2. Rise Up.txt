Hold on my mother said, donât give up on this
Go on my lover said, you were meant for this
This is all I have, this is all I know
I could never let it go, all my life itâs filled me up with hope
I wonât quit, this is my purpose
And even through the struggles and hard times itâs fucking worth it

You gotta rise up, rise up, rise up
You gotta fight it, fight it, fight it
You canât just follow, follow, follow
Greatness canât arise through typical lives

Itâs never easy to get what you want, step up your drive
Throw doubt aside when you fight for what you love
Your dreams are shot and thereâs a chance to give up
Donât give up, show your guts, show them what youâre made of
Overwhelmed by doubt, lifeâs currents wore me down
Losing what I need found
Iâm adrift, out of it, alone among the crowd

You gotta rise up, rise up, rise up
You gotta fight it, fight it, fight it
You canât just follow, follow, follow
Greatness canât arise through typical lives
You gotta rise up, rise up, rise up
You gotta fight it, fight it, fight it
You canât just follow, follow, follow
Greatness canât arise through typical lives

Hold on my mother said, donât give up on this
Go on my lover said, you were meant for this
Hold on my mother said, donât give up on this
Go on my lover said, you were meant for this

You gotta rise up, rise up, rise up
You gotta fight it, fight it, fight it
You canât just follow, follow, follow
Greatness canât arise through typical lives
You gotta rise up, rise up, rise up
You gotta fight it, fight it, fight it
You canât just follow, follow, follow
Greatness canât arise through typical lives
