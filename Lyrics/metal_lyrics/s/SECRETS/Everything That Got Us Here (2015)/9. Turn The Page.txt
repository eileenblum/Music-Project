Just sit back, just sit back and release all the pain
Let it go
Let them go, those thoughts of self disdain
Just sit back, just sit back and release all the pain
Every inch that sinks in those feelings go away
They say Iâm beautiful
They say Iâm young and free
But it's so hard to see when these tears burn so deep
How could they be so wrong?
Iâm so alone in my cave
Sitting with one foot on the ground and the other in my grave

Did we ever love properly?
Could this really be happening?
No one wants you to go away
Oh god, but you ended it anyway

You're too young to have felt that way
The chance to make it better is the chance you threw away
This went too far in the wrong way
Instead of tearing out the page you set the whole book ablaze
I hate this, I hate them
I want it to end
The voices in my head pretend that theyâre my friend
They promised they promised a light at the end
But I push deeper and into the darkness I descend
We never wanted you to go

Did we ever love properly?
Could this really be happening?
No one wants you to go away
Oh god, but you ended it anyway

So sit back relax and release all your pain
Sit back relax and release all your pain
Whispers the demon that haunts my brain
As darkness closes in I canât feel a thing
This darkness that hides my bloody angel wings

Did we ever love properly?
Could this really be happening?
No one wants you to go away
Oh god, but you ended it anyway
I spent my life behind the blinds
Content within the dark
Never exposed unto a light
Until the last beats from my heart
I spent my life behind the blinds
Content within the dark
Never exposed unto a light
Until the last beats from my heart
