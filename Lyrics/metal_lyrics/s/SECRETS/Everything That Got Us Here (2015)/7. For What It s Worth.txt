For what it's worth Iâm glad you stuck around
Even after I found out about what you've done
Now I got some questions rolling off my tongue
And I think your answers should be, well pretty fun
Last night I spied my pretty baby with a stranger more than a friend
It's fine, I'm fine
Answer the question, oh come on just cut the shit

You're fucking tongue tied
You keep tripping over every lie
Your alibis only buy you time
Til I cut this open, exposing the secrets you're holding
The shit you hide will catch up to you in time

You gave me all that I need to move on
Now all the love that I gave is withdrawn
I thought we built this structure safe and sound
Then you decided to tear it down
I canât keep up with how quick you give up
On the only one who would never give up on you

You're fucking tongue tied
You keep tripping over every lie
Your alibis only buy you time
Til I cut this open, exposing the secrets you're holding
The shit you hide will catch up to you in time

You gave me all that I need to move on
So thanks for all the wasted time
You're no longer on my mind
One thing before you go
There's something you should know
You're worse than living alone
Worth less than trash on the road
You'll never make anyone miss home

You're fucking tongue tied
You keep tripping over every lie
Your alibis only buy you time
Til I cut this open, exposing the secrets you're holding
The shit you hide will catch up to you in time
