Beneath charcoal skies my thoughts they roll and slowly fade with time
I thought I saw you near, called your name forgetting you'd never hear
My words resonate and dance among the void that filled your place
It's the little things that grow into the demons that haunt my days

This vacancy in my chest
Is burning through and the bliss and the will that I have left
You know that misery brings company thatâs not who I am
But if regret becomes hope then I will torment the masses

My last words echo over and over
Wish I could bring you back
My last words echo over and over
The past is the past wish I could forget

Passed on, but the past isn't gone
I carry all the wrong we've done
Each resentment like a stone
Guess what
I put your picture back up
It reminds me of what I should have said
Iâll make sure I donât forget

Off track
Without a map in my hand
I try to find my pride and define independence
Bow down to the sense of remorse
I need to stand my ground
To hold the weight of insanity

Agony is my reality

Agony is my reality
Step down stand and let me breathe
Agony is my reality

My last words echo over and over
Wish I could bring you back
My last words echo over and over
The past is the past wish I could forget

Lying in this half empty bed between barely alive and halfway to dead
Beat down broken and dragged through the mud
With one wing dipped in gold and the other in blood
I will never be whole

Lying in this half empty bed between barely alive and halfway to dead
Beat down broken and dragged through the mud
With one wing dipped in gold and the other in blood

My last words echo over and over
Wish I could bring you back
My last words echo over and over
The past is the past wish I could forget
