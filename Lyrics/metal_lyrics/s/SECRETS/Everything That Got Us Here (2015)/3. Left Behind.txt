I've been placed with the task of burning what I have left of any hope that I had
Avoiding hopelessness
He harder I try the further I fall into a hole that's too deep to climb up its walls
I can't break free

I got a feeling the world just left me behind
Every attempt that I make's not enough to get by
And there's no catching up this time

Oh, it costs enough to make your dreams go broke
Oh, this costs enough to make your dreams go broke

When will this end
When will I finally begin to push past all the problems I've been drowning in
I'm sick and tired of all the liars
They're telling me that life gets better
If I'd just pull myself together

I got a feeling the world just left me behind
Every attempt that I make's not enough to get by
And there's no catching up this time

Consistent let down, all the way down
Insistence won't help, that's what I've found
I got a feeling the world just left me behind
And there's no catching up this time

Oh, this costs enough to make your dreams go broke
Oh, this costs enough to make your dreams go broke
They're selling failures to me, purchase pending
I can't afford them, but I can't stop spending
Oh, this costs enough to make your dreams go broke

This life's got me down
I struggle just to find the solid ground
My thoughts are deceiving
I can't shake this feeling
I need a new beginning

I got a feeling the world just left me behind
Every attempt that I make's not enough to get by
And there's no catching up this time

Consistent let down, all the way down
Insistence won't help, that's what I've found
I got a feeling the world just left me behind
And there's no catching up this time

When will this end
When will I finally begin to push past all the problems I've been drowning in
