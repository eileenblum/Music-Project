I've been searching around for any way to figure out why you changed
Checking every drawer in my head and every fight that we've had
Just hoping to find something that guides you back, but I never find it

This oneâs for my heavy heart, it's hopelessly broken
This goes to the times I let my self down
I'll never get over them
Shout out cause I'm wasted and lonely
With no one to embrace me
I'm sick of being the one
The one with no one

Still wandering around for two weeks now
Stuck here still trying to figure it out
How could you go off and leave that way?
Just throw three years away
You stole the stars from my nights and blacked out the sun in my days
Now loves got me dizzy again and I canât get used to the spin

This oneâs for my heavy heart, it's hopelessly broken
This goes to the times I let my self down
I'll never get over them
Shout out cause I'm wasted and lonely
With no one to embrace me
I'm sick of being the one
The one with no one

Iâve done all that I can do to try and forget you
It's just something I can't do
It's become an issue
I donât want to miss you

This oneâs for my heavy heart, it's hopelessly broken
This goes to the times I let my self down
I'll never get over them
Shout out cause I'm wasted and lonely
With no one to embrace me
I'm sick of being the one
The one with no one
