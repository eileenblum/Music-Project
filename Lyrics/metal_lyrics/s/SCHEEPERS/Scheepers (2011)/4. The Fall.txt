I FEEL IT COMING
NO ONE WILL EVER HELP TO UNDERSTAND
SNAKES AND FLAMES
WALKING ON THE ASHES OF THE HOLY LAND

WHEREVER YOU WILL RUN
WHEREVER YOU WILL HIDE
THERE WILL BE NO MORE LIFE IN FEAR
EMBRACE THE DEVIL â AND DEAL WITH IT
IT MAKES ME WANNA DISAPPEAR

YOU BETTER WISH
I'M FALLEN â I'M BROKEN
AND I SAW IT ALL BEFORE
LIKE THE CHOSEN, TO BE BROKEN
AND I'M READY FOR THE FALL

AND I WILL RISE AGAIN
AND I WILL OPEN UP MY EYES AGAIN
TO REALIZE THE TRUTH
AND WASH AWAY MY BLOODY SINS

WHEREVER YOU WILL RUN
WHEREVER YOU WILL HIDE
THERE WILL BE NO MORE LIFE IN FEAR
EMBRACE THE DEVIL â AND DEAL WITH IT
IT MAKES ME WANNA DISAPPEAR

YOU BETTER WISH
I'M FALLEN â IâM BROKEN
AND I SAW IT ALL BEFORE
LIKE THE CHOSEN, TO BE BROKEN
AND IâM READY FOR THE FALL
