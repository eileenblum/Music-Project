I live on the exit every day of my life
It's a story with an open end
To live or to die

I'm riding the storm, I'm defeating the beast
I would rather prefer to be dead, than to be born
I know that I'm daring the death

Addicted to play with fire [2x]

My life is a  tap on the gamble and death
'Cause i don't wanna get old, it's a thrill
I don't care to die young
I smash every border and take every risk
Don't know any rules I'm an outlaw
Deep from the heart, i know that I'm daring the death

Addicted to play with fire [4x]

People say, that I'm insane
They call me the lord of the flame
But i am trapped and locked in his cage
I've tried, but i cannot escape

Addicted to play with fire [4x]
