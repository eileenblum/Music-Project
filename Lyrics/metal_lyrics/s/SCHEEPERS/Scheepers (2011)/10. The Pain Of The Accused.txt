I'VE BEEN TRYING ALL MY LIFE
TO PLEASE EVERYONE, TEASE EVERYONE.
NEVER THOUGHT MUCH OF WRONG PRIDE
I'VE HELPED EVERYONE, LOVED EVERYONE.
BUT THEN I'VE MADE A BIG MISTAKE AND NO ONE FORGAVE ME
I THOUGHT LIFE IS GIVE AND TAKE - IT'S A ONE WAY SOMETIMES

IT FEELS LIKE LIVING A BAD DREAM
THERE'S NO WAKING UP, NO WAKING UP
GUILTY CONSCIENCE IS EXTREME,
THE PAIN IS ALL I'VE GOT, ITâS ALL I'VE GOT
NO MATTER HOW MUCH I REGRET, I CANT TURN BACK THE TIME
ITâS NOT EASY TO FORGET, THIS LASTS ALL MY LIFE

I CAN'T ERASE WHAT I'VE DONE I MUST FACE THE TRUTH
THERE ARE NO EXCUSES - THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO DO
I JUST KEEP ON ASKING WHAT CAME OVER ME
BUT IN THE END IT'S NOT A NASTY CRIME

ALL THE MORAL HEROES, WHO HIDE THEIR FAULTS,
BY POINTING THEIR FINGERS ON ONE WHO GOT CAUGHT
ALL THIS FOOLISH HONOUR IN A WORLD FULL OF LIES,
IT'S STINKING UP TO HEAVEN, IT'S DIGNITY WHICH DIES
IT'S THE PAIN OF THE ACCUSED

HOW CAN ANYONE NOT ACCEPT AN APPOLOGIE?
IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE MADE A MISTAKE
BUT THIS PRIZE I HAVE TO PAY NOW - IS WAY TOO HIGH
ONE THING IS FOR SURE:
THERE'S GONNA BE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL
AND A NEW DAY WILL COME - IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD ONE!
