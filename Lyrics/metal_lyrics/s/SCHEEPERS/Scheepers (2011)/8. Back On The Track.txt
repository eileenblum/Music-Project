BACK ON THE TRACK - THERE'S NO LOOKING BACK
GOT RID OF THE MEMORIES - MEMORIES THAT TORE ME APART
SAVING MY HEART - I'M SAVING MY SOUL
CRUSHING THE ENEMY - MY WORST ENEMY IS ME

WE ALL SHOULD LEARN TO SHOVEL IN MONEY BRINGS NO LUCK AT ALL
TIME TO RETURN BACK TO THE BASIC

ERASE ALL THE SHIT
THERE'S NO NEED TO SUBMIT - LEARN TO LIVE YOUR LIFE
THERE'S SO MUCH YOU CAN DO
IT DROWSES IN YOU - TIME HAS COME TO RECALL

I'M TAKING MY TIME - THE PROSPECTS ARE FINE
JUST LISTEN TO MY HEART - IT NAVIGATES ME TO JOY
I'M BUSY ALL DAY BUT I'M DOING IT MY WAY
DEEP FROM WITHIN I FACE THE WORLD WITH A GRIN

LETâS BREAK NEW GROUNDS BUILT ON BENEVOLENCE - FREEDOM AND PEACE
START SOWING THE SEED - TO GATHER RICH HARVEST

ITâS TIME TO RETHINK
AND YOUR PROBLEMS WILL SHRINK - LIVE YOUR LIFE
YOU WILL FIND YOU CAN DO
ONLY GOOD THINGS TO YOU AND THE WORLD AROUND YOU
BACK ON THE TRACK

TIMELESS - I'M THE WINNER - LIVIN' FOR TODAY
SENSELESS - STOPPED TO WORRY - WASHED MY DOUBTS AWAY

ERASE ALL THE SHIT
THERE'S NO NEED TO SUBMIT - LEARN TO LIVE YOUR LIFE
THERE'S SO MUCH YOU CAN DO
IT DROWSES IN YOU - TIME HAS COME TO RECALL
IT'S TIME TO RETHINK
AND YOUR PROBLEMS WILL SHRINK - LIVE YOUR LIFE

BACK ON THE TRACK
BACK ON THE TRACK
BACK ON THE TRACK
