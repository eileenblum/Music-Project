[Scheepers]
I can't see the light instead
The black surrounded me
I woke up in a dark cell
No chance to disappear

[Ripper]
What started as my biggest day
Ended up in Armageddon
My path of destruction marked
My trace on where to head on

[Scheepers]
I raised my scorching look
The night when heroes died
I saw the screaming eagles fly

[Both]
Remission of sin - absolute limit
see the light within - absolute limit

[Ripper]
Ten thousand warriors
Heading outta space today

[Scheepers]
Battering to the ground
And all collisions failed

[Ripper]
No place to hide the truth this battle can't be won
Fight till the last man is outdone

[Both]
Remission of sin - absolute limit
see the light within - absolute limit

We ride the universe
A shining cross will rise
My vengeance has begun
Immortal sons will die

[Ripper]
I raised my scorching look
The night when heroes died

[Scheepers]
I saw the screaming eagles fly

[Both]
Remission of sin - absolute limit
see the light within - absolute limit
Remission of sin - absolute limit
see the light within - absolute limit

Remission of sin
