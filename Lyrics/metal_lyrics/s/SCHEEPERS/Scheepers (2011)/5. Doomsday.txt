I WALK BY MYSELF IN THE GUTTER OF MY LIFE
I SEE THE END OF THE WORLD
FROM THE AMBUSH CRAWLS THE BEAST IT REACHES OUT FOR ME
IT GRABS AND RIPS OUT MY HEART

IN MY DREAMS I FACE THE HORROR
EVERY NIGHT IT KEEPS COMING BACK
FANTASY OR SHEER REALITY
I CAN'T TELL IF I'M AWAKE OR ASLEEP
I JUST SEE THE BEAST APPEAR
AND A CERTAIN SOUND I HEAR
MAKES ME SHIVER MAKES ME COLD
START RUNNING BUT I'M GOING NOWHERE

NOW THAT I'M ASLEEP AGAIN I FEEL LIKE ON MY DOOMSDAY
THERE'S NO ONE TO TAKE MY SHRIFT I'M ALL ALONE
DOOMSDAY HAS COME

IN THE MORN I WAKE UP RADDLED
FULL OF SWEAT AND BLOODY CLAW MARKS
I CAN'T GET RID OF THIS HORROR SCENARIO
I SEE A SCAR RUNNING ACROSS MY CHEST
IS THAT COMPELLING EVIDENCE
WHERE IS THE REASON WHERE THE SENSE
IT JUGGLES WITH MY HEART
WHILE I'M SLEEPING IN THE DARK

NOW THAT I'M ASLEEP AGAIN I FEEL LIKE ON MY DOOMSDAY
THERE'S NO ONE TO TAKE MY SHRIFT Iâ ALL ALONE
DOOMSDAY HAS COME

I WALK BY MYSELF IN THE GUTTER OF MY LIFE
I SEE THE END OF THE WORLD
FROM THE AMBUSH CRAWLS THE BEAST IT REACHES OUT FOR ME
IT GRABS AND RIPS OUT MY HEART

NOW THAT I'M ASLEEP AGAIN I FEEL LIKE ON MY DOOMSDAY
THERE'S NO ONE TO TAKE MY SHRIFT I'M ALL ALONE
DOOMSDAY HAS COME
NOW THAT I'M ASLEEP AGAIN I FEEL LIKE ON MY DOOMSDAY
THERE'S NO ONE TO TAKE MY SHRIFT I'M ALL ALONE
DOOMSDAY HAS COME
