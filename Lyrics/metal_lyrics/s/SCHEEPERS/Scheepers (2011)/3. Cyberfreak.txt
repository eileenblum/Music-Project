I have an alias - 'cos I play safe
I stay anonymous - it makes me brave

And I pour my scorn on everyone
I am so harassed by jealousy
It is affecting my sanity

In the world wide web is my performance
In the world wide web I am a star
In the world wide web I find my girlfriends
Cause I am
A Cyberfreak

I get my music and films for free
Take it as a peccadillo my friend
It will not harm the industry

And I leech my porn
Five hundred Gigabyte 'til dawn
It's a pleasure for my hardware
I'll catch a virus on my software

In the world wide web is my performance
In the world wide web I am a star
In the world wide web I find my girlfriends
Cause I am
A Cyberfreak

Assigned by fixed IP - I'll find my ecstasy

In the world wide web is my performance
In the world wide web I am a star
In the world wide web I find my girlfriends
Cause I am
A Cyberfreak

In the world wide web is my performance
In the world wide web I am a star
In the world wide web I find my girlfriends
Cause I am
A Cyberfreak

Awkward, stupid, little Cyberfreak
