There's a force
Can you hear it?can you feel it?
I'm coming down, stronger than anything
In this world, raise your fists to the air
There is a feeling that we have to share

'Cause from my deepest heart, one thing i wanna do
I wanna say, I wanna say hello to you

Let me welcome you to the family
Heavy metal dynasty
let me welcome you, here's your family
Born to serve the century

In this world, there is one destination
A destination no one is ever able to escape
Raise hands to the sky, sink your head to the ground
Leave your worries just behind, no one can bring you down
'Cause from my deepest heart, one thing I wanna do
I wanna say, I wanna say hello to you

Let me welcome you to the family
Heavy metal dynasty
Let me welcome you, here's your family
Born to serve the century

A ten million helping us around the world in war
There's only one thing left forever

Let me welcome you to the family
Heavy metal dynasty
Let me welcome you, here's your family
Born to serve the century
