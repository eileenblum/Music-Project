We all see, all those millions who bleed
Got no chance to succeed, and there's world full of greed
Take your time, ask yourself for a rhyme
Share your number one time
What you'll get is a smile

with a sign of compassion, you lighten their pain
and no one can say your donation's in vain
see the sigh turning into a grin

in a time as the world gets united
open minds, sit together and talk
we align what the past devastated
our ears have learned how to listen

with a sign of compassion, you lighten their pain
and no one can say your donation's in vain
planet earth moves together as one

would you tell the world that the secret of freedom is peace
would you strengthen your love with some piece of mind
and walk through open border lines
we all can prove, it's not just a dream

We all see, all those millions who bleed
got no chance to succeed, and there's world full of greed

with a sign of compassion, you lighten their pain
and no one can say your donation's in vain
planet earth moves together as one
