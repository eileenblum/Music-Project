A time travel to the mid age
As people get locked without reason
Like animals trapped in a cage
In darkness demanding for freedom

There is no use just torture-tormention
Banned to amuse nobility

Demanding for justice
They're prisoners of insanity
Demanding for justice

Locked in the Dungeon
Locked in the Dungeon

As Cesar was ruling Rome
The slaves were abused for amusement
Trapped in the pleasure dome
Banned to compete with the lions

There is no use just torture-tormention
Banned to amuse nobility

Demanding for justice
They're prisoners of insanity
Demanding for justice

Locked in the Dungeon
Locked in the Dungeon

Demanding for justice
They're prisoners of insanity
Demanding for justice

Locked in the Dungeon
Locked in the Dungeon
