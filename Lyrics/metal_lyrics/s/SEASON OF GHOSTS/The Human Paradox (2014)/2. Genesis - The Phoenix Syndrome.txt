Looking at the sky above me
Fragrant leaves in my hand
Leaving the storm behind me
Once again I am awake!

Writhing alone in torment
Silence I could not escape
You told me you knew how I'll end
(But) I walked through your hate

Dreams I once believed to be distant
Talk to me
Embracing friends and foes
Now I go I know the way
Finally

Watch me rise above you
Smash this blinding illusion
And your lies
Un-creating sadness
Hear me when I tell you
I know better than believing
In madness
I am reborn, I am revolution!

Remember how you always told me
I'd fail I'd crawl
I played along
I know you fear to say you miss me
Now I've proved you wrong

Sometimes the weight feels heavy on the shoulders
Destiny
But when I think again
Everything's the way it was supposed
To be

Watch me rise above you
Smash this blinding illusion
And your lies
Un-creating sadness
Hear me when I tell you
I know better than believing
In madness
I am reborn, I am revolution!
