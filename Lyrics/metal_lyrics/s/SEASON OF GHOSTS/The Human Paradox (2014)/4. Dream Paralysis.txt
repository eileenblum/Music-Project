Night, insidious night
Stretching your mighty claws
Through eerie floodlights
Sight, oh hideous sight
And such a putrid smell
A glance into black hell
Light, mysterious light
Shadow eyes haunting me
Feeding on my sanity

Listen now wherever you are
I'm the soul that you will never take
('Cause) I am meant to stand in the light
Bloody hands remind me of battles I won
I'm the voice that you cannot erase
I'm the fighter you will not enslave
I know we connect in wicked ways
(But I'm) never coming back
It's freedom I crave

Night, oh devious night
Like a fly in spider's nest
Memory I detest
Flight, delirious flight
I dream in morning light
In sleep I am awake
Fright, invisible fright
I guess you thought you'd win
But I never gave myself in

Hey now, whoever you are
Do you still remember my cold blade?
Now I see why you came to me
It's the kind of fate I don't wish to escape
I'm the love that you cannot erase
The survivor you will not forget
Liberated from your wicked ways
Never looking back
It's freedom I crave

Leave the light on, breathe, breathe!

Listen now wherever you are
I'm the soul that you will never take
Now I see why you came to me
It's the kind of fate I don't wish to escape
I'm the love that you cannot erase
The survivor you will not forget
Liberated from your wicked ways
Never looking back
It's freedom I crave
