Isn't it funny
How we can't see beyond
Our hell?
Isn't it sad
That we only want
What we can't have?

And although we were born
In the kindest corner of the universe
We always end up living
Happiness in reverse

Wake now
Face yourself
Hurting each other
Our fears we dispel

Why can't the path
Be walked backwards?
Why can't my soul
Cease grieving?

And sometimes I want to cry
A nostalgic deluge
That drowns you in your sleep
No!
That babbles gently
Around your house
Glistening in the morning lightâ¦

Why is the sky calling my name?

Wake now
Face yourself
Hurting each other
Our fears we dispel
Stand above the lie
Living illusion
Our fate we deny
Seas of destiny
Velvet wave come
And take me away

All of my dreams of us
All of my hopes
Dissipate
Yet all of my love
For the world I unfold
Or is it too
Lateâ¦?
