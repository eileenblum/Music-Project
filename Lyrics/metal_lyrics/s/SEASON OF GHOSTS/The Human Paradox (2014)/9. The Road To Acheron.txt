I can see you through the lonely sky
As I begin my last journey
I can hear you through the silent clouds
And the swishing willow tears
I can feel you, your unblinking eye
My voice sinking to a whisper
I can smell you on the wings of fear
I sense you drawing near

Now I know why you came here
Now I know why I came here

I escape, I escape from your world
I sail away, sail away into destiny

Shadow ferryman pulling at the oars
(As) I swill down bitter water
To the sun I wave a last farewell
I expire, I leave no trace
My life dances truths I could not face
In the mist amid the sorrows
In the river that is without joy
My faults, they will dissolve

Now I know why you came here
Now I know why I came here

I escape, I escape from your world
As the air echoes all that you told me
I'm alive, I'm alive in your heart
I sail away, sail away into destinyâ¦
