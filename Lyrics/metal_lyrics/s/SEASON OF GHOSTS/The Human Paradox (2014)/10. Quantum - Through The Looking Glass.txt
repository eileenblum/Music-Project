Tunnel light, so bright
And tonight I'm a human satellite

See her drawing close
The life you chose before your eyes
And now you realize you can't go back
(But) sometimes there's a second chance
So which road will you take?
She asked and set my past alight
My memories

Wide space
A parallel, weird place
Familiar face

And she holds my hand
She knows I persevered, I fought
And dreams unmourned, buried beyond
She says there's a second chance
I delete your lies and horrors
Painful hindsight
And my soul ignites
In cosmic storm
And now I know which way to go

See her drawing close
The life you chose before your eyes
And now you realize you can't go back
(But) sometimes there's a second chance
So which road will you take?
She asked and set my past alight
My memories of love
And hate everything in-between
Left behind

And she holds my hand
She knows I persevered, I fought
And dreams unmourned, buried beyond
She says there's a second chance
I delete your lies and horrors
Painful hindsight
And my soul ignites
In cosmic storm
And now I know which way to go!
