I travel in time
I dwell in worlds beyond the beyond
I rise in flying embers
I'll still be here when you're gone
I know you're just a breath away
A state of mind, a breath away

Reality or fantasy
A fallacy or centuries
Of illusion
Arranged confusion

I'm a wanderer
I have always lived among you
Watching over you
I'm there when you think you're alone

I'm the shining wonder
The coincidence you want to see
I lifted you above the water
When you couldn't breathe
I know you're just a breath away
A state of mind, a breath away

Reality or fantasy
A fallacy or centuries
Of illusion
Arranged confusion

I'm a traveller
I walk in the gray of your dream-world
Shadow passenger
Armoured I'm in silver and gold
Hear me when I say
All the answers lie within you
Try to ignore the truth
But the truth cannot ignore you

I'm a traveller
Slipping through the cracks of your mind
Galaxy adventurer
Come and let me show you my world
Hear me when I say
You and me are in this together
Try to ignore the truth
But the truth shines on forever!
