Now, what will you do now?
Before you I stand
When you feel the end's near
Oh, I hear you calling my name
In vain

You always smile, you always hide
Your ugliness in sweet words
You sound alright
(But) there's something vile
A lie that suffocates me
Your glacial eyes behind your mask
You think I cannot read you
I made mistakes, I gave you trust
I studied life the hard way
And for a while
I thought you might
Embrace me for what I am
'Cause you always smile
You always hide
But your heart is black
You see no light.

Here, whatever you choose
Whatever you feel
Means nothing to us
Nothing we can't use to
Pull you from your heart and
The dreams that you made
For your life disappear
Our world is made of your tears and fears.

You saw me cry, you held my hand
And chuckled behind my back
You watched me fall
You heard me sigh
You thought it's intellect I lack
And deep inside I know you wish
You had the life that I have
'Cause the time is nigh
And now it's too late
But it's justice I give
Not hate

Things once colourful
Everything turns to gray
Collective madness
No lessons learnt at all
Selective blindness
And mouth shut
Waving your future goodbye-bye
Tell me you can change
Before life fades away

The only thing I ever wanted
Was a life with you
In peace

Shadows fall
The stars I call
Did you forget?
I remember it all
Crawling...
Calling...
Crawling...
Calling...
I'm coming to get you
Coming to get you

Shadows wake
Your smile so fake
The moon I take
The silence I break
Crawling...
Calling...
Crawling...
Calling...
I'm coming to get you
Coming to get you!

Here, whatever you choose
Whatever you feel
Means nothing to us
Nothing we can't use to
Pull you from your heart and
The dreams that you made
For your life disappear
Our world is made of your tears and fears.
