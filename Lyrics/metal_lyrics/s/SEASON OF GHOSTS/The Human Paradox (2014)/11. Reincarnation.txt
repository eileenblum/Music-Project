Finally, finally we meet
As the rain falls through unending time
Following, following your path
A hollow whisper lacerates my heart

Find me in forsaken dreams
When your spirit screams
Voiceless
Find me, call me and I'm here
Where you buried me alive
In your mind

Drawing empty circles
Never ending road

Many times I used to see you in a dream
Waking up and you were still there
Desperate believing
Time and time again
Losing something that I never really had.

Being with you is like coming home
Honey sweet, bitter on the tongue
Is it you? Is it really you I see?
Is it a ghost of my agony?

Hide me in your banished dreams
Amaranthine memories
Hide me, I'm the hand you left
In the place we met
Time and time again.

Follow me into the farthest sky
Follow me until the brightest star
Follow me into the farthest sky
Follow me until the brightest star

Find me in forsaken dreams
When your spirit screams
Voiceless
Find me, call me and I'm here
Where you buried me alive
In your mind

I don't wanna feel no more
I don't wanna hide no more
Do you?
And I don't wanna hear a thing
I regret nothing
Do you?
Look at me standing here
I have no pride or fear
Do you?
Hurtful illusion gash
I just wanna see it crash
Do you?
