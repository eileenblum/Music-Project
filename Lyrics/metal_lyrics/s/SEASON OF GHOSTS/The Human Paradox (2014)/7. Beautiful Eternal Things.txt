Remember
When we met
You said let's
Walk together
You said
Will you
Help me
Proud marble arcs
Streets of white stone
Now they're just a memory
Monuments of our hollow vanity

When the winds weep
For a fallen land
I think of you
What was it that separated us?
Does it really matter in the end?
To dust we'll return
(But) we created beautiful
Eternal things

Day and night
Our hearts entwined
What we built
Surpassed our existence
Remember
When we lost ourselves
In a storm of greed
What looked wise
In our eyes
Was meant to become our demise

When I bleed in your hands
And the earth sighs under your step
I remember why we lost
Acid rain melts my hair
Is there any meaning at all?
Yet I still believe
That we can save our soul

When the winds weep
For a fallen land
I think of you
What was it that separated us?
Does it really matter in the end?
To dust we'll return
We and our beautiful
Eternal things
