I want you to know
That nothing will be
The same anymore
I want you to know
That nothing will feel
The same anymore

I'm the hand that feeds
While my spirit screams
Like a barren tree
Habit's not a need
I have to break free
Habit's not a need

Through the holes
In my clothes
I see the world

Take a leap of faith
Fly in the unknown
You falter
There's no punishment
Only consequence
And wonder

And I want you to know
That even if you suffer all alone
There's nothing to fear
You only need the power to let go

I'm the hand that feeds
And my bones they creak
Like a barren tree
All those promises
Drowning in this mess
How can I forget?

In the middle of
The world I stand
Unbreakable
With a leap of faith
Create your own fate
Unshakable

Take a leap of faith
Fly in the unknown
You falter
There's no punishment
Only consequence
And wonder
