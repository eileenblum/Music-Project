I've been trying to tell the world
Things are OK, don't you worry
Out of fear that I'd lose control
I know no one would feel sorry

The truth is here
I see it clear

What a time
What a time
What a time to be alive!
All my tears
In a box
I send to the other side

Are you strong enough
To face what's about to come?
Tonight let us celebrate
'Cause we have nowhere to run
Tonight let us dream free
Of a world we might never see
Oh how I wish we got to live
Our life the other way around!

See, the world goes on without you
Don't resist, you're not allowed to
Now I'm holding hands with myself
I am my own saviour, break the spell

The future's here
I see it clear

What a time
What a time
What a time to be alive!
All my tears
In a box
I send to the other side

Are you strong enough
To face what's about to come?
Tonight let us celebrate
'Cause we have nowhere to run
Tonight let us dream free
(Of) a world we might never see
Oh how I wish we got to live
Our life the other way around!
