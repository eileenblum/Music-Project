You told me that's what life is about
But how it ends, is for me to decide
(As) everybody stared in disbelief
My tears were my only friend

Now I decide this is how the story ends
Cannot pretend I like what I see
Cannot help feeling sad
For all that is and was
And will never be
At least for me
Now I'm free

You told me it's all in my head
But I see through the walls of misery
I see truth for what it really is
I decide that's how the story ends!

Now I decide this is how the story ends
Cannot pretend I like what I see
Cannot help feeling sad
For all that is and was
And will never be
At least for me
Now I'm free

We are, we are
Like fire in the wind
We are, we are
Like fire in the windâ¦
