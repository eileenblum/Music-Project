I recall a time when we were allowed
To sleep tight, even for a while
But now I feel I don't belong
To this tragedy, oh no
Let me ask you this
Does happily ever after exist?

Tell me I'm not the only one
Tell me what you see
A little cloud in the unknown
A place to call home
Show me life without regret
Where I can rest my soul
Victim of a circumstance
I will be no more

I recall a time when our hearts were whole
And we planned ahead with our eyes so bright
But now I feel as if my life's
Got the best of me, oh no

Tell me I'm not the only one
Tell me what you see
A little cloud in the unknown
A place to call home
Show me life without regret
Where I can rest my soul
Victim of a circumstance
I will be no more

Life is so strange
