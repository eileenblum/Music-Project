Listen
I'm not a model child
I guess I'll never be
I speak my mind
I go against
The things you hold so dear

No fear only regret
I leave behind me now
'Cause you never really cared enough
To listen, listen

Listen
I'm not the perfect one
For you I'll never be
My words might hurt
But you will hear no lies from me
Your insecurities, social conformities
I couldn't care less
My mind is free and it's not pretty

No fear only regret
I leave behind me now
'Cause you never really cared enough
To listen, listen

You failed to see past
Your own image of the world
A world I never fit in
Goodbye

No fear only regret
I leave behind me now
'Cause you never really cared enough
To listen, listen
