To the corners of the earth
I have travelled just to find you
Through the universe we run
Like an asteroid around the sun

There are moments in our life
We can't describe
Looking for a way to find
Our way back
Are you still in there?
Are you still there now?

To the corners of the earth
I have travelled just to find you
Through the universe we run
Like an asteroid around the sun

Wipe your tears
Even if no one else can understand you
Choose your path
And never surrender again

Maybe you don't recognise
Your face no more
And you're weary of this fight
Alone
All my scars are mine
(Yet) somehow I'm still alive

Wipe your tears
All that we've lost beyond our comprehension
We release
And never surrender again

Wipe your tears
Even if no one else can understand you
Choose your path
And never surrender again
