I'm sorry I did not know
How to protect you from the hate
The fear piercing through your heart
I'm sorry I could not protect you
From the crushing wave of lies
That ravaged your soul leaving you
Breathless and bare

I am here
I am here now
I am here
I am here now

I could save everyone but you
I am almost human now

I'm sorry I did not know
How to protect you from the shame
Like poison running through your veins
I'm sorry I could not defend
Your sanity, your love for life
I didn't know your worth and left you
Crash and burn

I am here
I am here now
I am here
I am here now

I could save everyone but you
I am almost human now
