Impendent twilight falls
And covers everlasting plains
The night is breeding deep inside
Deserted and forgotten lands

I call to free horizon
Inhale the smouldering sky
I watch the traces of the dead
Their dreams repeat themselves
Before the morning comes

Again it's the recurrence
And it will have no end
Soon unfamiliar grey evening
Will give the power to the earth

The traces are lost and buried
On the roads in the beginning of the way

The dust will shine between the hills
Wild, savage malice is rising again
This is the outward show
Don't let it escape till dawn
It is darkness again, again silence, wind, sky

The dust will shine between the hills
The wind swept out their fear
This is the outward show
Don't let it escape till dawn
It is darkness again, again silence, wind, sky

And now the fear haunts me
Its power makes me run away
I follow traces of the dead
That spectral shine will light my way...
