Slow withering
Fragments of red agony
Quaint bacchanal
Unrestrained dance of disharmony

Ones, enveloped in flames
Spread to me their bloody hands
Thousands of corpses are crunching
Crunching under my feet
Winds are chanting
Their songs of sorrow and sadness
Incessant rains are feeding
Your mouldering body

Touch me
Breathe on me
With the cold breath of the night
The last warm days are gone
Soon the winter will come

Come and take me
I cannot stay anymore
Each day is like dying
In this abandoned world

Time has stopped
While this gloomy light of day seems to have no end
I hear, the sounds are shattering
and then they stifle into dense cotton-like fog
coming from the other side of the river
Its dark green waters carry empty coffins
opened for the dead to come
