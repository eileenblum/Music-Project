Approaching me from far away
And now it's here
Primal, brutal
Filled with the animal fear

Buried your days
Expend your strength
Look into past
And you will see
Here is my dream
She stands alone
Her light will grow
...with years

Here is my reality
I will be buried by myself
You ordered everything
But for your life it is too late
Tested by light
She will bear its absence
The skies will die
But your will never want this

Desire means dream
And dream shares no expense
she is alone
alone
Expend your strength
Look into past
And you will see
Here is my dream
She stands alone
Her light will grow
...with years

I remember the age
Of every my thought
It could be measured by the fear
That leaves in every nerve
And weakness means nothing, laziness, sleep
Its wind is getting tangled inside the sails
Of the giant branches of dullness

Its breath is calm
Its breath is tranquil
It looks around the alien reasons of life
Its breath is calm
Its breath is tranquil
And this will stay inside...
