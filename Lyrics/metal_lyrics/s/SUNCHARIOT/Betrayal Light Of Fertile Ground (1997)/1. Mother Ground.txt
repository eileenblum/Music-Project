Now when I need your silent calm
To which I permanently crave
So hide me from the light of day
And let the willow shed the tears at my grave

It's the return to the beginning throught the end...

O, Mother Ground
For I was yours forever
You are my strength
You are my faith

O, Mother Ground
Please, take your restless son
I feel your warmth
I feel your love

I am the tribe,
That riding through
The boundless steppes
Of southern sun

Burial mound
Forgotten home
Of those who tilled
The neverending lands

Carven leaves
An autumn choir
Sun goes down
Into this fertile soil
And I will go
Into your fertile soil...
