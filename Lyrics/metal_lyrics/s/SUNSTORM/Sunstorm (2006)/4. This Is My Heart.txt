Secret in a place that I call my own
I keep the keys to the doors that are open
I walk these halls with them all alone ...ohhh
Hidden from the cameras behind the scenes
I got a heart that's never been broken.
And here I stole my hopes on the dreams...ohhh

I worked this crime I did my time
I compromise every moment of a life
I keep my faith in who I am down deep inside

Cause this is my heart and no one knows where it goes
And it gets what it needs any answers to no one
This is my heart and it's got to be true
To where I believe anything's will come by me
Nobody but me.....

Who would like to think you are in control
You tell your friends i m just what you needed
I wrap and tab how to play that role ohhhh
Everybody thinks they are in command
You are in the world that kid is the power
I wrap and store how to keep their hand ..ooooh

I worked this crime I did my time
I compromise every moment of a life
I keep my faith in who I am down deep inside

Cause this is my heart and no one knows where it goes
And it gets what it needs any answers to no one
This is my heart and it's got to be true
To where I believe anything's will come by me
Nobody but me.....
