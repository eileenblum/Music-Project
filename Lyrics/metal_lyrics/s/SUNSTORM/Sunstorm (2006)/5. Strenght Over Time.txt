Strength over time
That's all I ask yet it's so rare
I look in your eyes and I see
The promise
The hope and the doubt
Can it endure, I've seen the flash
Heard the thunder
Will love be a nova tonight
Or burn through the years like a star?

I'm not looking for guarantees
I can't hold on to fantasies
But if there's someone
Who shares my dream
Send for me

Cause I seem to remember that

Time was, when true love was judged
On how well it weathered the tears
And time was, when love meant to trust
And romance was measured in years
And time was, when I was a fool
For the rush and thrill of the climb
But I believe, I believe, I believe
In strength over time

Stay with me
Sharing the wine of the moment
The power of two hearts as one
The wisdom to know when it's real

I'm not looking for guarantees
We've all been fools for nights like these
But if you're someone who shares my dream
Send for me

Cause I seem to remember that

Time was, when true love was judged
On how well it weathered the tears
And time was, when love meant to trust
And romance was measured in years
And time was, when I was a fool
For the rush and thrill of the climb
I believe, I believe, I believe
In strength over time

And time was, when I was a fool
For the rush and thrill of the climb
I believe, I believe, I believe

Time was, when true love was judged
On how well it weathered the tears
And time was, when love meant to trust
And romance was measured in years
And time was

Time was, when love meant to trust
And romance was measured in years

And time was
Strength over time
And time was
I believe, I believe

Time was
Strength over time
