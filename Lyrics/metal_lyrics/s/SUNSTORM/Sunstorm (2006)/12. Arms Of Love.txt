Can't sleep,
All the covers lying on the floor.
Can't keep,
This helpless feeling up inside no more.
I raise my head with an empty stare,
face another sunrise without you.
People around me, and nobody cares,
not like the way you do.

I think of you and I'm home again,
in the arms of love.
I count the miles, all alone again,
am I strong enough?

So hard,
I read your letters hear you on the phone.
Two hearts,
can't pretend that we are made of stone.
I won't take comfort from no one else,
an empty pillow beside me.
Alone in the darkness,
crying for help,
I reach for you endlessly.

I think of you and I'm home again,
in the arms of love.
I count the miles, all alone again,
am I strong enough, strong enough...
I face the rain and make it home again,
to the arms of love.

I guess it never gets easier,
the pain of living apart,
the risk of losing the love we share,
weighs heavy on a lonely heart.

I think of you and I'm home again,
in the arms of love.
I count the miles, all alone again,
am I strong enough, strong enough...

I face the rain and make it home again,
to the arms of love.
God bless the train that takes me home again,
to the arms of love,
arms of love.

And I'm home again,
in the arms of love.

I think of you and I'm home again,
in the arms of love.
