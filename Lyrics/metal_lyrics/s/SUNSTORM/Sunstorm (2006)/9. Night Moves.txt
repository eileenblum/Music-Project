Slippin' away
Silently we took the night
He pulled the shades
Locking out the neon lights

The room was dark
Our shadows danced in perfect time
But I held on
To what was for this moment mine

Were on the edge
Reaching the point of no return
Caught in a web, daring to touch
Is it the love of the danger
Or the danger of the love?

You know I'm not afraid of your night moves
You know I'm not afraid of your night moves
Dangerous games we play
But you know I'm not afraid

Secret ways
Always having to pretend
We play the game
Outraged innocence

Stealin' away
Silently into the night
Separate ways
Strangers in the morning light

Were on the edge
Reaching the point of no return
Going everywhere, daring to touch
Is it the love of the danger
Or the danger of the love?

You know I'm not afraid of your night moves
You know I'm not afraid of your night moves
Dangerous games we play
But you know I'm not afraid
