You don't remember me
I knew you way back when
the times were really tough,
We all needed a friend
Now, you hit the big time,
You're no longer a stranger
You walked away and never looked back
You were headed for danger, headed for danger

Fame and fortune - has made you change that's what they say
Fame and fortune - no one knows the price you pay
Fame and fortune - it's not everything its supposed to be
Fame and fortune - people see what they wanna see

You say the pressure gets so intense
The price of glory is at your own expense
You can't please everybody
You can't even please yourself
Now you've become what they made you
Now you're somebody else, somebody else

Fame and fortune - has made you change that's so they say
Fame and fortune - no one knows the price you pay
Fame and fortune - it has made you change in their eyes
Fame and fortune - brought you pain and sacrifice, pain and sacrifice

Fame and fortune - has made you change in their eyes
Fame and fortune - brought you pain and sacrifice
Fame and fortune - is it really worth the price
Fame and fortune - you got to fight for the right
Fame and fortune - shadows of reality
Fame and fortune - people see what they wanna see
