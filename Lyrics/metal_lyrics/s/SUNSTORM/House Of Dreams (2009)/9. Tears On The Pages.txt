I walk out of the lights
The crowd they keep callin'
After the curtain's down
Hear me cryin'
Another hotel
In some lonely town
Where I lay my head tonight

I keep trying
It's no use
I can't sleep
I'm missing you
I'm in too deep
So far away
But I can dream
And pray for the day

As I open your letter
I feel the ache
Of a heart that was
Left behind
As I'm writing these words
My hand starts to shake
So fly me courageous
'Till the tears
On the pages have dried

So where are you now
I wonder out loud
It's me and the moon tonight
Hear me cryin'
This life on the run
The call of the wild
It's breaking me up tonight

I ain't no lyin'
It's no use
I can't sleep
Without you here
I'm incomplete
So far away
I need you love
And pray for the day

Now there's tears on the pages
I feel the ache
As I read
In between the lines
As I reach for the words
My hands start to shake
So fly me courageous
Over faraway places
'Till the tears
On the pages have dried

I keep calling your name
It's no use
I can't sleep
I'm giving up my soul to keep
So far away
I need you love
And pray for the day

Now there's tears on the pages
I feel the ache
Of a heart
I have left behind
As I'm writing these words
My hand starts to shake
So fly me courageous
Over far away places
'Till the tears
On the pages have dried
