Take me to home to night
Don't even try to fight
The way that we are feeling inside, oh no,
Somebody to believe in,
Don't even need a reason,
We can make it last for more that one night.
So baby hold on tight,

I want your love, I need your touch
Why does it always mean so much
Together, forever, now,
But in the time won't change my mind
We love like all this love to find
Together, forever, now

Baby explain to see
That what you mean to me
Is something that my eyes just can't hide, noooo...
All that I need is you
Tell me if you feel it too
Want you put your heart next to mine
I'm always go on up and fight

I want your love, I need your touch
Why does it always mean so much
Together, forever, now,
But in the time won't change my mind
We love like all this hard to find
Together, forever, now
