You don't have to turn away
When I hold you anymore
I know it kills you to lie
Cause when we make love
You can't look into my eyes
No matter how
Desperately you try

Just save a place
In your heart for me
Then I won't feel so alone
Girl, save a place
In your heart for me
You might change your mind
You never know

Here in the dark
It's all so clear to me
And I find the courage
I need to leave, I do
Cause I lie awake helpless
To stop the pain you feel
And I always pray
For your soul to keep

Just save a place
In your heart for me
Then it won't be so hard
To let go
Girl, save a place
A place in your heart for me
You might change your mind
You never know

In a way I wish
There was another man
Then at least I have someone
Something to fight tonight
But just to give up
You know just how I am
I always believed that
You and me
Would make it alright

Just save a place
In your heart for me
Then it won't be so hard
To let go
Girl, save a place
In your heart for me
You might change your mind
You never know
