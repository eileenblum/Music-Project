I was always
Scared of you
But I could run
A little faster
Did you think
I'd get us through?
I lost the flame
You lost the fire

Tomorrow's a long way
From where we were
There's no point in crying
For yesterday

Now you're everything
Inside my house of dreams
But inside I know that
I have to let you go
Yeah, I always knew
You wanted to be free
What might have been
Inside my house of dreams

Do you have
What you desire
Have you found
The life you wanted
I will stand
And watch you fall
From a distance
I'll be watching

Tomorrow's a long way
From where we were
There's no point in crying
For yesterday

Now you're everything
Inside my house of dreams
But inside I know that
I have to let you go
Yeah, I always knew
You wanted to be free
What might have been
Inside my house of dreams
