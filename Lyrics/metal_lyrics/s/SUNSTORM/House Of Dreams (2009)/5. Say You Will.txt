Now I can barely
Understand it
Just how we came together
At this time
It all fell into place
As if we planned it
Like children
Dreaming up a storyline
A single heart
Just looking for a reason
The voice of reason
Looking for a rhyme

Now that you have spoken
From the heart
Say you will -- say you will
We're making every move
A work of art
Say you will -- say you will

We've heard so many worn
And dusty phrases
The book of love
Has nothing much to say
I press the autumn leaves
Between the pages
So I won't forget the way
I feel today
The feelings in my heart
May go unspoken
Still they're echoing
In every breath you take

Now that you have spoken
From the heart
Say you will -- say you will
We're making every move
A work of art
Say you will -- say you will

Give these arms the strenght
To lift you up
The faith
To pull you through
The grace
To help you over
here we are
With so much left to say
Still words get in our way
In our way

Now that you have spoken
From the heart
Say you will -- say you will
We're making every move
A work of art
Say you will -- say you will
