I've been told a story
Of just how love
Lives and dies
It only takes an instant
Just a moment to feel alive

Let the pain go
It's slipping out again
What you had is not enough

Don't give up
I can taste the freedom
In the air
Feel the magic everywhere
Don't give up
I believe the world
Begins tonight
It's Alright
Don't give up

I can see the sunset
Feel the moonlight
All around
But in the eyes of someone else
They just feel the emptyness
Too scared to feel alive

Don't surrender
Leave the past behind
What you had is not enough
No, no, no

Don't give up
I can taste the freedom
In the air
Feel the magic everywhere
Don't give up
I believe the world
Begins tonight
It's Alright
Don't give up

Let the pain go
It's slipping out again
What you had is not enough

Don't give up
I can taste the freedom
In the air
Feel the magic everywhere
Don't give up
I believe the world
Begins tonight
It's Alright
Don't give up
