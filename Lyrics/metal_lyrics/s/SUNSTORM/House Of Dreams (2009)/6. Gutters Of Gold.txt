The rain falls east
The rain falls west
It makes no difference
To the rain
It soaks the streets
Of our unrest
There is no shelter
From the pain

Who's gonna tally
Up the cost
How many innocent
Lives are lost
In the crossfire
Of the battles being waged

Don't be afraid
To take the heat
Tonight we're taking back
The street

London is
Burning with a fire
In the hold
Who'll control
These gutters of gold
Gutters of gold
What price survival
Tally up the latest toll
Blood will flow
In gutters of gold

You see the hate
In letters tall
Scrawled on the caves
Where cowards hide
Another tribe
On a cinder wall
How high upon the totem
Must you ride

Who's gonna rule this
Sacred ground
Who's gonna stop this
Clash of power
What's gonna make this
Frightened city stand as one

Don't be afraid
To take the heat
Tonight we're taking back
The street

Paris is
Burning with a fire
In the hold
Who will control
These gutters of gold
Gutters of gold
What price survival
Tally up the latest toll
Blood will flow
Heads will roll

These are the streets
of my childhood
Paved with my dreams
Of my youth
Most of its buildings
Are scorched out shells
Just like our hopes
Just like the truth

Chicago is
Burning with a fire
In the hold
Who'll control
These gutters of gold
Gutters of gold
What price survival
Tally up the latest toll
Who'll control
These gutters of gold
Gutters of gold

New York is burning
Belfast is burning
Moscow is burning
Gutters of gold
Gutters of gold
Miami's burning
Detroit is burning
L.A. is burning
Gutters of gold
Gutters of gold

These gutters of gold
These gutters of gold
These gutters of gold...
