Now is it time
for me to look inside
my heart tonight
I'm standing in line
another day another chance to fight
show me what it feels like
to breathe again
breathe again

I been fadding out
and another fade to hide
and I come to down
if I ever been alive
I been divided

as lonely days gone by
feels like I never broken free
question me why
I just need something to believe
show me what it feels like
to breathe again
breathe again

I been fadding out
and another fade to hide
and I come to down
if I ever been alive
i been divided

show me what it feels like
to breathe again
breathe again

I been fadding out
and another fade to hide
and I come to down
if I ever been alive
I been divided
