Broken hearts line the great white way
And I'm joining their ranks tonight
Old timers talk to invisible friends
And you're nowhere in sight
And then I'm lost in this feeling again
Well I'll be strong someday soon
But baby till then, oh

Pass me by when you're on the street
Don't look back walk on
And make sure our eyes don't meet
I don't know when I'll let you go
Don't look back walk on
And in time I'll let you know

Sitting all alone in a picture show
Well it looks just like us on the screen
It's your face in the crowd
Everywhere that I go, oh,
there's no escaping this dream
And when I'm lost in this feeling again
I'll be strong someday soon but baby till then

Pass me by when you're on the street
Don't look back walk on
And make sure our eyes don't meet
I don't know when I let you go
Don't look back walk on
And in time I'll let you know

Even the rain looks like tears in your eyes
Somehow the pain never dies

Pass me by when you're on the street
Don't look back walk on
And make sure our eyes don't meet
I don't know when I let you go
Don't look back walk on
And in time I'll let you know

Pass me by when you're on the street
Don't look back walk on
And make sure our eyes don't meet
I don't know when I let you go
Don't look back walk on
And in time I'll let you know
