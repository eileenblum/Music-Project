Watching and waiting
I been letting the time go by
Anticipating
Someday I'd see your eyes
Searching for someone
Cause I been alone so long
Thought there was no one
And then you came along

Now that I've found you
Gonna build my world around you
I gotta let you know I'm never gonna
Let you go

I found love
I found love tonight
I found love
I found love tonight

Winning and losing
In somebody else's game
Lying and using
It always feels the same
Loving and leaving
With everyone that I see
Still I go on believing
There's so much more love can be

Now that I've found you
Gonna build my world around you
I gotta let you know I'm never gonna
Let you go

I found love
I found love tonight
I found love
I found love tonight

I found love
I found love tonight
Everything is alright
I found love
I found love tonight
The minute I saw you
