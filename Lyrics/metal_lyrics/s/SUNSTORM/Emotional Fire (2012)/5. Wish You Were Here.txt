Girl, i'm reaching for you
I am calling out your name
I want to show you i have changed

For every time i've hurt you
A memory still echoes in my mind
But i have left that man behind

No matter how long
I'll pray you come back to me. i'll make you see
Through oceans of time
My heart will always believe

Now the rain falls from darkened skies
I hear your voice, but it's all in my mind
If one wish could come true tonight
I'd wish you were here by my side

I am a fool for dreaming
A fool for holding on
But the love i feel's so strong

I know i've been wrong, so baby come back to me
Can't you see?
I'll pay any price
Your place is right here with me

Now the rain falls from darkened skies
I hear your voice, but it's all in my mind
If one wish could come true tonight
I'd wish you were here by my side

Got to tell you how i feel
Can't you see that this is real?
Girl, this is once in a lifetime
Say the world and i'll be gone
But i can't carry on without your love

Now the rain falls from darkened skies
I hear your voice, but it's all in my mind
If one wish could come true tonight
I'd wish you were here by my side

Now the rain falls from darkened skies
I hear your voice, but it's all in my mind
If one wish could come true tonight
I'd wish you were here by my side

Girl, i'll be waiting for your touch
