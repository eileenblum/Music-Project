You seemed so right
You seemed so true
I thought i'd find my destiny
I thought that it was you

But you gave me nightmares
It felt like i've sailed the ship of fools
Now you're finally out of here
'cause you broke all the rules

I've had enough of empty promises
I've had enough of broken dreams
'cause we feel in love
But you broke my heart again
I'm torn in half

To you, our love
Was just a game
You told me it's my fault
But you were the one to blame

But you gave me nightmares
It felt like i've sailed the ship of fools
Now you're finally out of here
'cause you broke all the rules

I've had enough of empty promises
I've had enough of broken dreams
'cause we feel in love
But you broke my heart again
I'm torn in half

I've had enough of empty promises
I've had enough of broken dreams
'cause we feel in love
But you broke my heart again
I'm torn in half

You told me a millions lies
What's left of you is a not a sweet goodbye

I've had enough of empty promises
I've had enough of broken dreams
'cause we feel in love
But you broke my heart again
I'm torn in half

I've had enough of empty promises
I've had enough of broken dreams
'cause we feel in love
But you broke my heart again
I'm torn in half

'cause you are all i had
I'm torn. i'm torn apart
I'm torn in half
