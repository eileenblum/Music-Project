Look in the mirror now who do you see?
Is it the face that you once knew?
Can you recall the way you used to be?
Are you still trapped in yesterday?

Now you know
There's nothing you can do about it
You're on your own, there's no turning back
All alone
Reality comes crashing down
But you're still standing strong

The higher you rise
The harder you fall
There's no one to catch you
The higher you rise
Now your back's to the wall
Holding on to a dream
The higher you rise

Deep in the dead of the night
You pray for sleep
To find the answers in your dreams

Don't you know now;
There's no winners in this loosing game?
Still on your own
You can't turn back time
When it's gone
You're better off just let it go
No chance to even the score

The higher you rise
The harder you fall
There's no one to catch you
The higher you rise
Now your back's to the wall
Holding on to a dream
The higher you rise

The deeper the fall
And there's no one to save you
The higher you rise
You're risking it all
To keep the dream alive
The higher you rise

Still living a lie that no one believes anymore
Why won't you see?
Do you even care anymore?
Care anymore
Still you keep holding on

The higher you rise
The harder you fall
There's no one to catch you
The higher you rise
Now your back's to the wall
Holding on to a dream
The higher you rise
