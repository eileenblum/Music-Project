You gave up everything you've worked for
'cause times were getting tough
It didn't mean you were a loser
Just out of luck

You did the best you could
You rode the storm with pride
Another day maybe
Luck is by your side

I know it's all a question 'bout how you
Change your one track mind
It's sheer determination baby
Just hold on tight

Follow your heart
Follow your dreams tonight
I know we can make it if we try
So how about right now?
Follow your heart
Surrender your soul tonight
I know we can make it, you and i
So how about right now?

You have been suffering in silence
Your life has been full of fear
There's a light at the horizon
Yeah, hope is near

Your learned your lesson, girl
You changed your wicked ways
Your life has just begun
Don't throw it all away

Follow your heart
Follow your dreams tonight
I know we can make it if we try
So how about right now?
Follow your heart
Surrender your soul tonight
I know we can make it, you and i
So how about right now?

Just believe that you can
Change your world around
Someday you will find your way
So hold on tight
Follow your heart

It's sheer determination baby
Just hold on tight

Follow your heart
Follow your dreams tonight
I know we can make it if we try
So how about right now?
Follow your heart
Surrender your soul tonight
I know we can make it, you and i
So how about right now?
