So now you're back
So you've had your fun
And now you're coming' 'round again
Sure baby I should let you in
So you can let me down again
Well it doesn't really matter what
You say or do
You can tell me that you love me
But I know it ain't true

Cuz you wouldn't know love
If it knocked down your door
You wouldn't know it now
You never knew it before
If it fell in your hands from the
Heavens above
You wouldn't know love
No, you wouldn't know love

You say you've changed
Say you've done me wrong
But you won't do it anymore
No darling, I don't have to tell you
Where I heard that line before
Baby you'd say anything to get back
Into my heart
But when it comes to lovin', you don't
Even know where to start

Cuz you wouldn't know love
If it knocked down your door
You wouldn't know it now
You never knew it before
If it fell in your hands from the
Heavens above
You wouldn't know love
No, you wouldn't know love

Did you think I'd believe anything
That you'd say
Let you come back to me
Baby there's just no way
Baby I've had enough
You wouldn't know love

Cuz you wouldn't know love
If it knocked down your door
You wouldn't know it now
You never knew it before
If it fell in your hands from the
Heavens above
You wouldn't know love
No, you wouldn't know love

You wouldn't know love

Cuz you wouldn't know love
If it knocked down your door
You wouldn't know it now
You never knew it before
If it fell in your hands from the
Heavens above
You wouldn't know love
No, you wouldn't know love
