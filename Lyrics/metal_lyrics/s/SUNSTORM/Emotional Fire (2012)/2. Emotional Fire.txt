I can't wait until I see you baby
I can't wait 'till the night comes falling down
I gotta see you again, oh

And even if it couldn't be forever
I'd trade a lifetime for this night together
Hold on, hold on
My heart is burning with the heat of this

Emotional fire, every time I see you
I'm on fire, every time we touch
Can't you feel me burning with desire?
Baby feel the warm, give me some
Emotional fire, emotional fire

There's a feeling when I'm here beside you
Couldn't leave you and I wouldn't try to
Baby, I'd only need you again, oh

There ain't nothing that can break this fever
The love gets stronger, and the passion deeper
Hold on, hold on
I can't let go 'cause there's no stopping this

Emotional fire, every time I see you
I'm on fire, every time we touch
Can't you feel me burning with desire?
Baby feel the warm, give me some
Emotional fire, emotional fire

I can't wait until I see you baby
I can't wait 'till the night comes falling
Hold on, hold on
My heart is burning with the heat of this

Emotional fire, every time I see you
I'm on fire, every time we touch
Can't you feel me burning with desire?
Baby, feel the warm, give me some
Emotional fire, every time I see you
I'm on fire, every time we touch
Can't you feel me burning with desire?
Baby, feel the warm, give me some
Emotional fire
Emotional fire
