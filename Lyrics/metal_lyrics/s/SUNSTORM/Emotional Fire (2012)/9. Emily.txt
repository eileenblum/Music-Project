I fell in love, the first time i saw you
I could tell, there was no one else
Who could measure up?
To you, my love?
You showed me a world
That once was so distant to me, girl
A passion, a hunger, a feeling
It's once in a lifetime to me

After all those years i've tried
To get inside your precious mind
You are my everything
It's all that i want

Emily, i will always love you eternally
Emily, i can feel your heartbeat next to me
Oh, emily, there's no one else
Who is right for me
Oh girl, i can see
There is no doubt
That you are the one for me
Oh oh oh

It took us a while
It took us a time
To work things out
Our love is stronger now
Than it was before
And it will go on

After all those years i've tried
To get inside your precious mind
You are my everything
It's all that i want

Emily, i will always love you eternally
Emily, i can feel your heartbeat next to me
Oh, emily, there's no one else
Who is right for me
Oh girl, i can see
There is no doubt
That you are the one for me
Oh oh oh

Oh emily

Oh, baby
You are the one
You give me all i need
And the strength to carry on

After all those years i've tried
To get inside your precious mind
You are my everything
It's all that i want

Emily, i will always love you eternally
Emily, i can feel your heartbeat next to me
Oh, emily, there's no one else
Who is right for me
Oh girl, i can see
There is no doubt
That you are the one for me
Oh oh oh

Emily, i will always love you eternally
Emily, i can feel your heartbeat next to me
Oh, emily, there's no one else
Who is right for me
Oh girl, i can see
There is no doubt
That you are the one for me
Oh oh oh
