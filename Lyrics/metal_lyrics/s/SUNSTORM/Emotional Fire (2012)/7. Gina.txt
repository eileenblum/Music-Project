Nowhere to run, i know
She's got the best of me
The deed is done; heaven knows
She wants the rest of me

And it's much too late
I'm caught up in the fantasy
Oh, and there's no escape
My running' days are history

Gina, gina, girl i surrender
Gina, gina, i'm over my head
Gina, gina, say it's forever
Never been in love this way
Never been in love this way

I've been on the loose, so long
Love couldn't hold me down
The flame in you was so strong
Girl you turned my heart around

Now i'm losing' sleep
Can't get you out of my head
Think i'm in too deep
I'm a slave to every word that you said

Gina, gina, girl i surrender
Gina, gina, i'm over my head
Gina, gina, its forever
Never been in love this way
Never been in love this way
