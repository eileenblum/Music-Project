Late at night, sitting in my window
Killing time, waiting for your phone call
As i try to figure what is going on
All has changed but nothing's really different
We're the same but something is missing
Now we blame each other and it feels so wrong

Anything goes in war and love
Anything goes until it hurts

I need you to know that i want you to come back
So don't let your pride get in the way - we've come too far
Baby lay down your arms
So why can't you see that i'm waving a white flag
To give us a chance to work it out here and now
Lay down your arms

Here i am talking to your voice mail
I know you're in but you keep me hanging
Don't you think we owe it to ourselves to try?

And if you need time to think it over
Just give me a sign and you know i'll back away

I need you to know that i want you to come back
So don't let your pride get in the way - we've come too far
Baby lay down your arms
So why can't you see that i'm waving a white flag
To give us a chance to work it out - eye to eye, baby

I'm trying really hard but i can't get you off my mind
I'm doing what i can to carry on with my life
But the harder i try the clearer i see
I gotta get you back - it's the only thing i need
All i need - all i need

I need you to know that i want you to come back
So don't let your pride get in the way - we've come too far
Baby lay down your arms
So why can't you see that i'm waving a white flag
To give us a chance to work it out here and now
Lay down your arms
