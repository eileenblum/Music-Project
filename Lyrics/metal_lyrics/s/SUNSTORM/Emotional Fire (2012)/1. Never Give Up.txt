You wouldn't believe how much i miss you
The sound of your voice still echoes
Inside my lonely mind
I just couldn't see how far we drifted
'cause we were so close
But now we're oceans apart

I've searched the world to find
A way to make you mine
'cause i can't let go
But i can't hold on, anymore

Never give up, never give in
If you believe it, you can win
There are things that blind and control you
But don't let those thoughts get to you

Never give up, never give in
If you believe it, you can win
Let the hope and dreams seduce you
Let the force of life run through you
Never give up
Never give up

I've never been good with second chances
The taste of your kiss still sweetens
The tears we left behind

I wish that i could find
A way to turn back time
'cause i can't let go
But i can't hold on, anymore

Never give up, never give in
If you believe it, you can win
There are things that blind and control you
But don't let those thoughts get to you

Never give up, never give in
If you believe it, you can win
Let the hope and dreams seduce you
Let the force of life run through you
Never give up
Never give up

If is the way it's supposed to be
I shouldn't deny it
So why even fight it anymore?

Never give up, never give in
If you believe it, you can win
There are things that blind and control you
But don't let those thoughts get to you

Never give up
