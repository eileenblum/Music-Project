Here in the dark
I've given you everything
But i'm so afraid
Were caught in the deep blue sea

You have me so completely
Don't let this go

I can't love you more
I can't give enough
Here in the dark - you're breaking my heart
You're all i am

You're just hurting yourself
Don't question what's never been
You're dreaming away
You can't see forest for the trees

It's never been so beautiful
Take a look in my eyes

I can't love you more
I can't give enough
Here in the dark - you're breaking my heart
You're all i am
I can't take away
The pain from yesterday
'cos i couldn't see - how i could be free
Now, you're all i am

You have me so completely
Don't let this go

I can't love you more
I can't give enough
Here in the dark - you're breaking my heart
You're all i am
I can't take away
The pain from yesterday
'cos i couldn't see - how i could be free
Now, you're all i am

Now with arms open wide
You've got me for life

And if you could only see
You have all of me
