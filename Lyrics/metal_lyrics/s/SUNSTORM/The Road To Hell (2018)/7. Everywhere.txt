[Alessandro Del Vecchio, Joe Lynn Turner]

When I turn around
There's only emptiness
Your scent is haunting me
If I look away
There's nowhere I can lay
And shelter me from the pain

What if I gave you all I had
Would I still have you here?

Don't wanna face another day without you
It's much too hard for me to bare
Everything I need is all about you
Hear my answer prayer
I can feel you everywhere

If I walked away would I be able to breathe again
Pick up the pieces of this heart of mine

And if I gave you all I had of me
Would the heartache disappear

Don't wanna face another day without you
You know it's hard for me to bare oh no
Everything I need is all about you
Be my answer prayer
I can feel you everywhere

I'll walked through fire with the hope to carry on
Trying to find love again

Don't wanna face another day without you
It's much too hard for me to bare oh no
Everything I need is all about you
Be my answer prayer
I can feel you everywhere
