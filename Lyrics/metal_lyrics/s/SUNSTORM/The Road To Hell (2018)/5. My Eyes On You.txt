[Alessandro Del Vecchio, Pete Alpenborg, Joe Lynn Turner]

Nobody could believe
There was something hidden beneath
We could only care
To keep going on with our lives
I couldn't see the dark
Written between the lines
They blinded everyone
They paved a path to hell for us

We couldn't read the sign
Lost inside this shrine
We can only conceive
What we were taught to believe

You can run
You can hide,
There's nothing left that you could do
Trying to leave the past aside
Cannot escape my eyes on you

These writings on the walls
Were there for us to read
We had no time to resist
And fight the power in greed
Divide and misplaced
This shadow of live we live
There's no time to hesitate
Or fall down on your knees

We couldn't read the sign
Lost inside this shrine
We can only conceive
What we were taught to believe

You can run
You can hide,
There's nothing left that you could do
Trying to leave the past aside
Cannot escape my eyes on you

You can run
You can hide,
There's nothing left that you could do
Trying to leave the past aside
Cannot escape my eyes on you

A new beginning oh
We can't stop spinning

You can run
You can hide,
There's nothing left that you could do
Trying to leave the past aside
Cannot escape my eyes on you

You can run
You can hide,
There's nothing left that you could do
Trying to leave the past aside
Cannot escape my eyes on you
My eyes on you
My eyes on you
