[Alessandro Del Vecchio, Pete Alpenborg, Joe Lynn Turner]

I was a fool to lose my way
I was only living for today
A broken promise never lasts
Two heart are falling fast

I let it slip away
We break apart nobody wins
Together we can find a way
To forget the past and let the fire begin

Why don't we take another chance
Don't wanna lose our romance
Love lights the way with a shinning star
Follow me back to the state of the heart

I'll be the one to wipe your tears
To hold you close and let you near
The fear of losing you runs through my soul
I'll never let you go

I let it slip away
I keep thinking what it could have been
Together we can find a way
To forget the past and let the fire begin

Why don't we take another chance
Don't wanna lose our romance
Love lights the way with a shinning star
Follow me back to the state of the heart

Words can't last forever
Life is now or never
Happiness is so hard to find
Now is the time

Why don't we take another chance
Don't wanna lose our romance
Love lights the way with a shinning star
Follow me back to the state of the heart
The state of the heart
State of the heart
