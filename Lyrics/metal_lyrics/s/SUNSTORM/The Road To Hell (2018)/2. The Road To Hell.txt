[Alessandro Del Vecchio, SÃ¶ren Kornqvist]

All the bitter times I had
All the painful restless nights
Made me stronger, made me wise
Gave me a solid ground again

I wiped those tears alone
I walked without a goal
I said my prayers, I won my war

Walking back on the road to hell
Going through all my mistakes
Walking back on the road the hell
Touch the bottom if you really wanna live

All those silent words I heard
From the ones who let me down
And all those struggles in me
Gave me the strength to face the storm

I wiped those tears alone
I walked without a goal
I said my prayers, I won my war

Walking back on the road to hell
Going through all my mistakes
Walking back on the road the hell
Touch the bottom if you really wanna live
If you really wanna live
Walking back
Walking back
One by one

Touch the bottom
Touch the bottom bottom

Walking back on the road to hell
Going through all my mistakes
Walking back on the road the hell
Touch the bottom if you really wanna live

Looking back inside my soul
Going through everything I've lost
Walking back on the road to hell
Face your fears if you really wanna live
The road to hell
Looking back
One by one
