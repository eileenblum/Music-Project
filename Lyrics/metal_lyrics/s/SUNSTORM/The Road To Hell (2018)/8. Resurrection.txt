[Alessandro Del Vecchio, Simone Mularoni, Joe Lynn Turner]

In a world that falls everyday without values
It's better to recall the nature of mankind
Our fate can't predicted, can't change yesterday
We can win the race the masters of our time

The best is yet to come
We'll live faster than the speed of light

Ride away the moment now has come
We don't need to stay our journey has begun
Searching for the secret behind life
Down to the care, gonna rise up and fight
Resurrection
Resurrection

Trapped inside the walls they built all around us
And when the curtain falls we see the shadows of the past
Can't take my away life, won't set aside my dreams
Gonna find a way, there is no coming back

The best is yet to come
We'll live faster than the speed of light

Ride away the moment now has come
We don't need to stay our journey has begun
Searching for the secret behind life
Down to the care, gonna rise up and fight
Resurrection

Ride away the moment now has come
We don't need to stay our journey has begun
Searching for the secret behind life
Down to the care, gonna rise up and fight
Resurrection
Resurrection
Resurrection
There no time in back
