[Alessandro Del Vecchio, Joe Lynn Turner]

Footsteps in the distance
Not so far from here
Blood is running cold

Seems like our existence
Can slowly disappear

We're climbing down
From this circle of pain

Can you face the wind that's blowing
On this desperate land?
Can you turn your eyes to the sun
There's no hope and there's no wisdom
Nothing we can do
What's left in our future to come
Future to come

Across the pressing dark
The pain is tough to bare
You know we can't stand tall

Watch out, don't leave a mark
We're running out of air

We're climbing down
From this circle of pain

Can you face the wind that's blowing
On this desperate land?
Can you turn your eyes to the sun
There's no hope and there's no wisdom
Nothing we can do
What's left in our future to come
Future to come

Can you face the wind that's blowing
On this desperate land?
Can you turn your eyes to the sun
There's no hope and there's no wisdom
Nothing we can do
What's left in our future to come
Future to come
