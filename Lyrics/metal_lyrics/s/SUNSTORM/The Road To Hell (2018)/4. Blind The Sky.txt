[Alessandro Del Vecchio, Simone Mularoni, Joe Lynn Turner]

Reaching out to you
Wish we only knew
The spell they cast on us

We've been called to fight
There's no end in sight
Let's make a bond of trust

Where is our path to follow
Where's our shooting star
No way out is hard to swallow
Our freedom is attacked
There is no coming back

Tell me what's the price to pay
If you're trying to reach the sun
You'd better fly away
How could you remember and forget
We're walking on thin ice
Spread your wings and fly
We blind the sky

No time to think about it
It's harder to admit
We were fooled from the start

Run as fast as you can
There's a curse on you man
There's a beast in your heart

Where is our path to follow
Where's our shooting star
No way out is hard to swallow
Our freedom is attacked
There is no coming back

Tell me what's the price to pay
If you're trying to reach the sun
You'd better fly away
How could you remember and forget
We're walking on thin ice
Spread your wings and fly
We blind the sky

How can't we find salvation for us all
This road seems too long
How can we break down all these prison walls
With help from God above
We will be free to love

Tell me what's the price to pay
If you're trying to reach the sun
You'd better fly away
How could you remember and forget
We're walking on thin ice
Spread your wings and fly
We blind the sky

We blind the sky
