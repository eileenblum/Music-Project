[Alessandro Del Vecchio, SÃ¶ren Kornqvist, Daniel Palmqvist, Joe Lynn Turner]

Look all around
The children cry alone
Listen to that sound
Have our hearts turned to stone

Do you see what I see
Do you feel the pain inside
They cannot run free
Drowning in the tears they've cried

Falling on their knees
Their eyes too wet to see
What kind of future are we leaving

Blood runs cold
Jump on a rocky ledge
We gotta keep our life from falling down
We're living on the edge

How can we be so blind
We're running from the truth
The deals that we signed
Are stealing away their youth

Do you hear what I hear
Do you feel their despair
Their laughters disappeared
Lord listen to their prayers

Falling on their knees
Their eyes too wet to see
What kind of future are we leaving

Blood runs cold
Jump on a rocky ledge
We gotta keep our life from falling down
No control
Falling off the edge
We better turn this world around
We're living on the edge
Blood runs cold

Blood runs cold
Jump on a rocky ledge
We gotta keep our life from falling down
No control
Falling off the edge
We better turn this world around
We're living on the edge
We're living on the edge
