[Alessandro Del Vecchio, Simone Mularoni, Joe Lynn Turner]

I cannot overcome
the problems I see all around
In this empty world we live in, no
The shadows of the past didn't let us reach the light
We searched so long through darkness and despair

Face the sun
Don't let our lives fade away
Live to win
I'm not ready for judgement day

Can you hear me calling
We're crawling in the dark
How can I stop the fall and leave my mark
Can you hear me calling
Just a step away from falling down
We can disappear today without a sound
Hear me calling

Do you feel the same
Can you feel it coming down
The road is slipping under our feet
Where will we go?

Face the sun
Don't let our lives fade away
Live to win
I'm not ready for judgement day

Can you hear me calling
We're crawling in the dark
How can I stop the fall and leave my mark
Can you hear me calling
Just a step away from falling down
We can disappear today without a sound
Hear me calling
Hear me calling

Can you hear me calling
We're crawling in the dark
How can I stop the fall and leave my mark
Can you hear me calling
Just a step away from falling down
We can disappear today without a sound
Hear me calling
Can you hear me
Hear me calling
Can you hear me calling
