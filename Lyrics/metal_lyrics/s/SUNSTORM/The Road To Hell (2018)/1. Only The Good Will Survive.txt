[Alessandro Del Vecchio, Simone Mularoni, Joe Lynn Turner]

Keep the flame alive
Discover all you can
Feed your soul with the knowledge as you go
Be a better man
Hold your life in your hand
Try to stay strong and don't wast your time

Prove yourself you can do everything you want
Be the judge of your actions
Run beyond what you see

Only the good will survive
If we let this life shine
It's a gift we can't deny
Only the good will survive
Be a light inside the darkness
It's only up to you if the good will survive
Oh, will survive

Hold the vision close
Keep your sight clear
Let the wind fill your sails
Always speak the truth
Be the beauty in your soul
Let your heart be your guide

Prove yourself you can do everything you want
Be the judge of your actions
Run beyond what you see

Only the good will survive
If we let this life shine
It's a gift we can't deny
Only the good will survive
Be a light inside the darkness
It's only up to you if the good will survive

Only the good will survive
If we let this life shine
It's a gift we can't deny
Only the good will survive
Be a light inside the darkness
It's only up to you if the good will survive
Oh, will survive

Gift we can't deny
Let this shine
Only the good will survive
