[Alessandro Del Vecchio, Simone Mularoni, Joe Lynn Turner]

Things are changing fast
There's nothing far beyond
What is left of all the dreams we had
Can you hear the voice cry alone
This life has caught us to the bone

Why are we waiting
Fire we left here without hope
I can't believe
This is the future that we sought with all our soul
With all our soul

We're still fighting
Waiting for another sign
We're the fire burning bright
Still we fight
Keep on climbing
Try to reach a higher ground
'Til we see a new horizon in our sight

The misery of all mankind
Trouble all around
And no one seems to give a damn
I know we can change what we see
If we turn it around
We can be set free

Why are we waiting
Are we left here without hope
I can't believe
This is the future that we sought with all our soul

We're still fighting
Waiting for another sign
We're the fire burning bright
Still we fight
Keep on climbing
Try to reach a higher ground
'Til we see a new horizon in our sight

We're still fighting
Waiting for another sign
We're the fire burning bright
Still we fight
Keep on climbing
Try to reach a higher ground
'Til we see a new horizon in our sight

We're still fighting
