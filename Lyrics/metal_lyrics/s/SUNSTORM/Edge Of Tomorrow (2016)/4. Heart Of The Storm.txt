[Simone Mularoni, Alessandro Del Vecchio]

It's just too easy to run away from life
Instead of trying
Better cry than to pretend
You thought I'd walk at your command
at your command

You say I would surrender I say I won't forget
I tried to pass you by but you were eaten by regrets
I'd turn and walk away and pave my road to hell
I'd rather go 'cause how I know you will

I don't wanna say my last goodbye
I don't wanna hear another lie
I've been fighting for love
In the heart of the storm
Trying just to find my inner peace
I don't wanna break my soul for you
I've been fighting for love
In the heart of the storm
In the heart of the storm

I can't believe what you put me tomorrow
Instead of loving me
I won't deny I was weak and you were strong
Before we hit that wall
Hit that wall

You say I would surrender I say I won't forget
I tried to pass you by but you were eaten by regrets
I'd turn and walk away and pave my road to hell
I'd rather go 'cause now I know you well

I don't wanna say my last goodbye
I don't wanna hear another lie
I've been fighting for love
In the heart of the storm
Trying just to find my inner peace
I don't wanna break my soul for you
I've been fighting for love
In the heart of the storm

I don't wanna say my last goodbye
I don't wanna hear another lie
I've been fighting for love
In the heart of the storm
Trying just to find my inner peace
I don't wanna break my soul for you
I've been fighting for love
In the heart of the storm
In the heart of the storm
In the heart of the storm
