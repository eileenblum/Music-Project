[Simone Mularoni, Alessandro Del Vecchio]

All this silence is making me feel like I am the last man on earth
All that I feel can't find the way out
I'm here again, lost in vain

The bond that we had was a shelter to me
Feels like the rain is falling again
All that I had cannot be found
Here I stand nothing in my hands

I know the sun will shine again
But deep inside I have an empty space

When all the hopes are lost and our dreams are gone
Will we be there no matter what
When our lives won't cross and out soul won't be strong
Well there be nothing left to say
Well there be nothing left to say

I won't turn my back to the path that we paved
Like nothing ever touched me so deep
I'll keep on climbing the highest mountain
To get back to the man I used to be

I know I will rise again
But deep inside I'm torn between heaven and hell

When all the hopes are lost and our dreams are gone
Will we be there no matter what
When our lives won't cross and out soul won't be strong
Well there be nothing left to say

Candles in the wind,
The flames of love will touch our skin
We lost out soul in the fire,
I'll keep on flying higher

When all the hopes are lost and our dreams are gone
Will we be there no matter what
When our lives won't cross and out soul won't be strong
There be nothing left to say
There be nothing left to say
There be nothing left to say
