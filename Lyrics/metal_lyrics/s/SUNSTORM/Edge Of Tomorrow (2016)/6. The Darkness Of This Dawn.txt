[SÃ¶ren Kronqvist, Daniel Palmqvist, Alessandro Del Vecchio]

Once were friends, once we were one
Nothing could divide us
We didn't know that life could be so tough

How many nights we faced
Dreaming what would be our future to come
We never thought our battle could have started again

We left all our dreams behind that door
Why did we throw away the keys
Why am I here with all these words unspoken

You left me there out in the cold
Without a reason to go on
How could you leave the past outside
In the darkness of this dawn

Can I turn back all the time we lost
Can I keep this darkness out
Feel like something took away the best part of me

We left all our dreams behind that door
Why did we throw away the keys
Why am I here with all these words unspoken

You left me there out in the cold
Without a reason to go on
How could you leave the past outside
In the darkness of this dawn

You left me there out in the cold
Without a reason to go on
How could you leave the past outside
In the darkness of this dawn

You left me there out in the cold
Without a reason to go on
How could you leave the past outside
In the darkness of this dawn
