[SÃ¶ren Kronqvist, Daniel Palmqvist, Alessandro Del Vecchio]

Alone at night
Don't know anymore what's wrong or right
I know it ain't easy to stay away from you

No waiting by the door
No answer to my calls
I'm not afraid of walking without you by my side

I don't know where to go
I keep the door closed if you want more
I only have to pray
For the strength to carry on

I'm tangled in blue
I'm running away from what you put me through
I'm trapped in a lie
I'm not running the risk tonight
I'm tangled in blue

No reason to pretend
And hide what I'm looking for
I know the sun is shinning right behind that door

I don't know where to go
I keep the door closed if you want more
I only have to pray
For the strength to carry on

I'm tangled in blue
I'm running away from what you put me through
I'm trapped in a lie
I'm not running the risk tonight
I'm tangled in blue

I won't keep on dreaming of you to walk through my door
The sun will shine and I'll be free again

I'm tangled in blue
I'm running away from what you put me through
I'm trapped in a lie
I'm not running the risk tonight
I'm tangled in blue

Free again

I'm tangled in blue
I'm running away from what you put me through
I'm trapped in a lie
I'm not running the risk tonight
I'm tangled in blue

I'm tangled in blue

I'm tangled in blue
