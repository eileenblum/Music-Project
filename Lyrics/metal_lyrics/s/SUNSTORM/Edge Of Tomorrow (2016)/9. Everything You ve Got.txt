[SÃ¶ren Kronqvist, Daniel Palmqvist, Alessandro Del Vecchio]

If you're flying high, if you keep it tight
Never underestimate
The power of life, if there's no end in sight
Never build a castle of sand

Don't give up if you can't control
A stranger might chance your path
Don't try to hide your face in your hands
Nothing can beat you that far

Hold on there's a reason to go on

Stop pulling yourself down
Give me your best shot
If you don't know where you're going now
Give me everything you've got

Don't fool yourself with disguised words
About the way you are
Climb the mountain to the top
Prove yourself they're wrong

Hold on there's a reason to go on
If you hold your head up high
It's never time for a goodbye

Stop pulling yourself down
Give me your best shot
If you don't know where you're going now
Give me everything you've got

Stop pulling yourself down
Give me your best shot
If you don't know where you're going now
Give me everything you've got

Don't run, don't try the push yourself too far
Stay tough, life will try to bring you down
Don't run give yourself the time to fly
Always give me your best shot
Give me everything you've got

Hold on there's a reason to go on
If you hold your head up high
It's never time for a goodbye

Stop pulling yourself down
Give me your best shot
If you don't know where you're going now
Give me everything you've got

Stop pulling yourself down
Give me your best shot
If you don't know where you're going now
Give me everything you've got

Stop pulling yourself down
Give me your best shot
If you don't know where you're going now
Give me everything you've got

Stop pulling yourself down
Give me your best shot
If you don't know where you're going now
Give me everything you've got
