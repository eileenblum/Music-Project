[Simone Mularoni, Alessandro Del Vecchio]

You have no fear for tomorrow
You feel pain anger or sorrow
Never got time to hesitate
You just don't panic, you only celebrate

A bloodsucker ain't familiar
All is cool with the devil as your friend
Something's changed ain't this peculiar
Gotta stop this or it will never end

Don't hold me down
All you do is take me with you bring me to the ground
Don't run away
You burn the night and steal the sun
Nothing on your way
You hold me down
You hold me down

Nothing stops and nothings beats you
All I know is what you put me through
You can't control the darkness that's inside
You cannot help it to conquer and posses

A bloodsucker ain't familiar
All is cool with the devil as your friend
Something's changed ain't this peculiar
Gotta stop this or it will never end

Don't hold me down
All you do is take me with you bring me to the ground
Don't run away
You burn the night and steal the sun
Nothing on your way
You hold me down

Gotta stop this
Gotta stop this or this will never end

Don't hold me down
All you do is take me with you bring me to the ground
Don't run away
You burn the night and steal the sun
Nothing on your way
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
