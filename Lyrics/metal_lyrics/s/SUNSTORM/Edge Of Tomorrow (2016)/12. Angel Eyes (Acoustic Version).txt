[Alessandro Del Vecchio]

I was looking for shelter from the pain
Then I found you
Life sometimes is strange there's no peace for me
I wasn't looking for a change

Trouble all around
No place to be found
Take me there
This is more than I can bare

Our future's now
Can you reach my hand
I can't live alone
Would you take away
The tears and the pain
Why don't you stay angel eyes

I'd give you all I have
But my hands are empty now
You left me with my wounded heart

Trouble all around
No place to be found
Take me there
This is more than I can bare

Our future's now
Can you reach my hand
I can't live alone
Would you take away
The tears and the pain
Why don't you stay angel eyes

I cried your name in the loneliness of night
I prayed for you to be the one to be the light
I'll be waiting waiting for you
No matter what you chose to do

Our future's now
Can you reach my hand
I can't live alone
Would you take away
The tears and the pain
Why don't you stay angel eyes

Our future's now
Can you reach my hand
I can't live alone
Would you take away
The tears and the pain
Why don't you stay angel eyes
