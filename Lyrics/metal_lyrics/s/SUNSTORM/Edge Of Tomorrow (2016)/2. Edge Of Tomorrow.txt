[Simone Mularoni, Alessandro Del Vecchio]

A cannot sleep, I cannot find a way to carry on
Where are all my dreams? Is our future gone?
How can I dare to think of my life
If all my hopes are sharp as knife?

Fight for your life
Run for the passion in your soul
Hold on tight
We already paid our toll

We're all living on the edge of tomorrow
We've been trapped in your lies
You felt no sorrow
We're all praying not to stay anymore
On the edge of tomorrow

I shiver and shake, 'cause I can't live this way anymore
Where is my time? I'm lying on the floor
I don't wanna run the risk of falling down
Do you fear to lose your crown?

Run for your life
Fight for the passion in your soul
Hold on tight
We already paid our toll

We're all living on the edge of tomorrow
We've been trapped in your lies
You felt no sorrow
We're all praying not to stay anymore
On the edge of tomorrow

We're all living on the edge of tomorrow
We've been trapped in your lies
You felt no sorrow
We're all praying not to stay anymore
On the edge of tomorrow

We're all living on the edge of tomorrow
We've been trapped in your lies
You felt no sorrow
We're all praying not to stay anymore
On the edge of tomorrow
On the edge of tomorrow
Edge of tomorrow
