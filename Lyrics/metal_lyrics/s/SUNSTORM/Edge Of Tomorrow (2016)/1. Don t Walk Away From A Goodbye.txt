[Simone Mularoni, Alessandro Del Vecchio]

You're living in a spiral
The future seems so dark and cold
You're living in denial
If you're leaving all those words untold

Life's all around if you don't lose the faith in you
Open your soul to the world
What's pulling you, what's holding you down in hell
It's time to fly

Don't walk away from a goodbye
If someone's keeping you away from the light
That shines in your eyes
Just lock the past behind your back
There's more to life than just a feeling of regret
Don't walk away from a goodbye

You're trembling like a leaf
When winter's knocking from the north
Now you live your life in disbelief
What's the reason for this back and forth

Life's all around if you don't lose the faith in you
Open your soul to the world
What's pulling you, what's holding you down in hell
It's time to fly

Don't walk away from a goodbye
If someone's keeping you away from the light
That shines in your eyes
Just lock the past behind your back
There's more to life than just a feeling of regret
Don't walk away from a goodbye

Don't walk away from a goodbye
If someone's keeping you away from the light
That shines in your eyes
Just lock the past behind your back
There's more to life than just a feeling of regret
Don't walk away from a goodbye

Don't walk away from a goodbye
