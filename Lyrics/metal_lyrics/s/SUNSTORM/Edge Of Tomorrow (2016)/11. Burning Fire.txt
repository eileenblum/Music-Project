[SÃ¶ren Kronqvist, Daniel Palmqvist, Alessandro Del Vecchio]

How could I be so blind
While you were taking me down
How could you leave our past behind

I felt I could fly so high
Reality bringing me to the ground
I thought I could touch the sky

Give me a reason to forget
Even if I lost my smile
Tell me why my eyes are wet
And why I'd walk a thousand miles

I'll remember all the times we shared
Never thought you could be a liar
We were stronger than the flames
In our burning fire

I thought those eyes could never lie
Life's bringing to my knees
There's price every time I try

Give me a reason to forget
Even if I lost my smile
So tell me why my eyes are wet
And why I'd walk a thousand miles

I'll remember all the times we shared
Never thought you could be a liar
We were stronger than the flames
In our burning fire

I'll remember all the nights we had
I thought love could take you higher
We had nothing to be sad
In our burning fire

Never meant to let you go
Love's not forever now I know

I'll remember all the times we shared
Never thought you could be a liar
We were stronger than the flames
In our burning fire

I'll remember all the nights we had
I thought love could take you higher
We had nothing to be sad
In our burning fire

In our burning fire
