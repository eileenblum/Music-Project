[Jim Peterik]

I feel the shiver a chill in the night
A cold wind that cuts to the bone
Whenever the meaning gets lost in the words
We speak in a language unknown

We're desperately trying to keep up the front
We try to stay true but out heart's on the hunt
We've both got to face it
We're reaching the end of the road

Can you read between the tears
We've been holding back for years
We are strangers again
Struggling to keep love alive
Can you read between the lines
We are running out of time
We are so beaten down
Tired of living a lie
Oh, so lonely the sound of goodbye

We go through the motions of people in love
Visit places that we used to go
Searching for magic that's no longer there
Bravely we put on a show

I see a storm cloud that blocks out the sun
I see two people who used to be one
We've both got to face it
We're chasing a dream that has died

Can you read between the tears
We've been holding back for years
We are strangers again
Struggling to keep love alive
Can you read between the lines
We are running out of time
We are so beaten down
Tired of living a lie
Oh, so lonely the sound of goodbye

Lie to me cry to me
Deep inside you know that it's over
And though we don't know who
We're reaching for someone new

Can you read between the tears
We've been holding back for years
We are strangers again
Struggling to keep love alive
Can you read between the lines
We are running out of time
We are so beaten down
Tired of living a lie
Tired of living a lie

Oh, so lonely the sound of goodbye
