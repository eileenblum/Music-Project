weather turning towards a storm
broken down road continue on coexistence
imitating paradise unlike any seen moist
has been dancing crazy overcast ash grey
wording constantly pushing pulling pushes away
drew back a rusty knife guilt ladle pour
it understand i burn inside how to get out
of here how do you get out of this
natures revenge nature cage craving wonder
the worth of it scream at the top of your lungs
so many times tried not to wonder
