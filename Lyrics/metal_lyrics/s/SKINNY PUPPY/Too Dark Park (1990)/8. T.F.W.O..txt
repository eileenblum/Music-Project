treason trapping animal hide in the vision of
paradise two explains your head deranged time
spun web deluded of life wicked black witch lady
localize intelligentsia go write a book to cry in
face it lost that look survivals hard enough fading
fire climbing higher time to realize that I'm on
fire patience sun the lord looks over who
covers in the watchtower freeze arm scraping
inches the vein blind distracted the worshipping
metal point a scraping hole forever breaking
in out temper test bottom so vile
faded higher why you liar
