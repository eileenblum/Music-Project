dry wind chars human storm lies barren
wasted greed taints water thirst dream
the asphalt burial daylight meltdown long
gone death grabs at stillborn child another
low test pesticide not until they are dead
believe in words attaching dread no meaning
color world of different levels no chance
to rectify nightmare running races skyward
tower boil black water tea contagious
waste disposal growing blind faith a tragedy
propagate safe history
creatures running underground all the
cages rusted displaced food bowls empty now
fit for the licking faces form memory
blind faith stupidity races run secretly
blind faith a tragedy not until they are
dead stop breathing fleas attach themselves
biting bits of flesh consuming words
once hated words are shit contracting the disease
