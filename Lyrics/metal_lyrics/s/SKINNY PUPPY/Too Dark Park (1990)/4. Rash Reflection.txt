notice that phrase thorough vileness of his
delivery ninety seven cars and free love
kiss the masters feet poor soul searching
all this seen deeper stillness tranquility
eat the food drug passive response spoiled
putty in the masters hand all this seen
is obscure enough kiss the masters feet
sure that vision is a vagrant holiday
reflective silence chooses one stance hidden
behind throne of freedom in the field
of the black sheep all this seen is obscure
enough confess all the truth seekers see
for the first time cult grows from a
rolls Royce dream preach from the back of
a limosine feel the rash burn notice that
phrase through the vileness how sweet feel
the rash start to burn
