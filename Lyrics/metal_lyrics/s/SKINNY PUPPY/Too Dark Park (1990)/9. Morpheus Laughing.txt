an extreme solution no fossil fuel mimicking
exhaust rattles troublesome a madmans vast
direct iron grooved world primary state average
distance closer to the sun draws a comet nearer
to a complex distruction a spectre so violent
in its views lies impervious altitude has a tendency
under pressure to reveal its identity
gaping hole bright star penetration blindfold
reliance wrinkles in the cloth of time unity among
such a poor existence in this third world
resistanceshould be used civil disobedience
central pivot revolving heated combustion back
to the origin of it all all of it no unwarranted
fear courage shown the white line on the ball
we live on deserted streets hallucinated the
bursted species abnormal conditions deep sentiment
for repulsive power nations knows immense populace
ingenuity and progress never progressed out of the sun
all experiments prove not need the established
greed and pain inflicted on the animal model still nothing
no cure the ravaged instinct silent waking to a
chemical perversion wartime underground
imperfect plotting grows the seeds of time
