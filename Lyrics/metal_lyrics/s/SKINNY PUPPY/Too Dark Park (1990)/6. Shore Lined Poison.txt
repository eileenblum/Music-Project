trials administer tidal oil that suffocating
base the fire gold pouring mercury life
given river deformed in amongst patient
building raise an urgent call reformation
strike the picking miners claw kick my ass
waste the given gift the natural cure
in the age of reason gone bad morning in
between the cold stone ashes fall upon the
wretched chosen ones 100 megatons evaporate
those chosen vaporize case in point and
deserving it vaccinate all stranger than whispering
crushed velvet corpse grind awaiting
underneath mask unneeded decisions come
from one side of the brain insolent dented
fibres optic looks the world of growth
fleeting image ghost destruction t.v.screen
