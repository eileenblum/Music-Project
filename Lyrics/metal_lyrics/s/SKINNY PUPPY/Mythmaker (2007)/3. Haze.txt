Death feels like the butterfly
can't escape the scarred lie
Real relationships must die
Underneath a scarred lie

We globalize the others lies
We sanctify the great disguise

What if change gate
Don't watch it show your shape

Desperate in death
Death will tell them
Death will kill them
Death will tell

First everything must recede
Then all will tell us to fear
and hear the sullen respite clears
into a time never wanted here

We globalize the others lies
We sanctify the great disguise
We globalize the others lies
We sanctify the great disguise

Reach through a life's test own
Being the worm crawling through

Death feels like a butterfly
Can't escape the scarred lie
Real relationships must die
Underneath a scar

Now I'll break on tonight
I'll escape light light
I'll escape one tonight
Gravitate slice slice
On the voice I reunite it's nothing at all
Once divided other sticks all through the eyes of blue

Reach through a life's test own
Being the worm crawling through

I'll escape, one tonight
Gravitate slice slice
I'll escape, one tonight
Gravitate slice slice
