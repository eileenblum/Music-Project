A politician, a worm in a fist and a wish of admission
You were dickin' semination
In your words you're vile nation
This oil tug of war of promptness taking back (hollow point?)
there's nothing you peek undecided
Watching you as you talk burned

Ambiantz (given me a house too?)
Ambiantz (show you beam house?)
Ambiantz given up hope to me
Ambiantz giving up the bum of you seat

Cheeks burning, upon my breath is turning, your voice in my mind
Take what you can find on beeper
You wake up feeling blind

There all over the back of your employee
Ah my is my M.O
Our side your time this will be how
Ambiantz (given me a house too?)
Ambiantz (show you beam house?)

Your game gets up too dark hear up
(team nine in throw team number see?)

Give a spot on the back of a shark
Give a spot on my back of your back
Give a spot of my back on your head
Give the shark your brains out

Until a tester
Until a tester decease a leprosy, decease a leprosy
Take what you want, shake what you can
Beepers, you wake up beeping

Ambiantz (given me a house too?)
Ambiantz (show you beam house?)
Ambiantz given up hope to me
Ambiantz giving up the bum of you seat
Ambiantz (given me a house too?)

Ambiatnz Love is faces_________
Ambiatnz Is this what you wanted
