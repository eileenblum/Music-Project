Jesus wants to be ugli
Jesus wants to be ugli
Jesus wants to be ugli
Jesus wants to be ugli

Ugli, Ugli, Ugli

Some of the lies darken eyes
Way beyond our chemicals
Something wrong nothing learned
I need to feed a whole other hole
fantasize, clear the eyes
How they can all fit inside
Sacrifice sanctifies all the ugly chemical

All hail to the king
the rest of your life, life, life...
All hail to the king
The edge of your world

Jesus wants to be ugli
Jesus wants to be ugli
Jesus wants to be ugli
Jesus wants to be ugli

Ugli, Ugli, Ugli

Blurry eyed, clear these eyes
Count to nine a human soul
Ritual indispose
Stoke a mana listen to gods
Cannibalize terrorize
Take the ugli chemical

Jesus wants to be ugli
Jesus wants to be ugli
Jesus wants to be ugli
Jesus wants to be ugli

Ugli, Ugli, Ugli
