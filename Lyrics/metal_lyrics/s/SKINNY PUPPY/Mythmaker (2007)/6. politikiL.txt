Must be leading the lightning socket.
Read backwards are fucking our pocket.
None of this means so better not fuck it.
Chinese way; Capital Inside!
Who's been dropping shit lays talking.
Everyone smells your life when you walkin'
Lies all living on a piece of shit.

Domination termination dirties up a definition,
dirties up denom denom Drop won't make it up.
It is enough, it is enough, it is enough
A shimy shake 'nough 'nough Shimyshakin a century dirt dumb
It is enough, it is enough. In a vision submission is enough

Are you offered a suck!
Are you offered a suck!
Are you offered a suck!
Are you offered a suck!

A suck! A suck!

Must of been ticking a week or two vegan.
Fell apart words are talked for a legion.
Maybe not my mother says based on shit.
Shifting eyes I'll take you one fist.
Who's been talking in magic secret.
Getting in line with mind control mantra.
We are all eating on tomorrow's lies.

Domination termination dirties up a definition, dirties up if a bomb drop won't make it up.
It is enough, it is enough, it is enough
Bomb, These Mo-Fo, bomb, emission, bomb, remission, bomb, emission, bomb, remission, bomb, is enough, bomb
Don't elimination Denom Denom elimination

Are you offered a suck!
Are you offered a suck!
Are you offered a suck!
Are you offered a suck!

[This part has a hidden phrase into this censored verse. This is the message:]
LD won't release,
LD won't release,
LD won't release,

But you gonna get something dumb bitch!
But you gonna get something dumb bitch!
But you gonna get so banged, never said you won't
You ever get nothing in strobe light

But you gonna get something dumb bitch!
But you gonna get something dumb bitch!
But you gonna get so banged, never said you won't
You ever get nothing in strobe light

Are you offered a suck!
Are you offered a suck!
Are you offered a suck!
Are you offered a suck!

[Here's the hidden message underneath the last verse. There's a total of 3 layers of lyrics!:]
Are you over the side, over the side, over the side...
But you gonna get so sorry, But you gonna get so sorry
telling a vision, but you gonna get sorry
