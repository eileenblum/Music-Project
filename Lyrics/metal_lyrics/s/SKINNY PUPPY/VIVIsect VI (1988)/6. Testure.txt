in nervous convulsion crouches infant ape trembling in mothers shit
cage eyes tear less filled with contempt clinic mask experiment with
life and death smell lingering noxious mixed scent anxiety omnipotent doctor
grinds the cage door revealing loves primal instinct taken away the tiny
face terrified rant and rave smash your head against the cage vacuum
clicks on high conscious of the pain pass off as humane white coat seems
so clean most dirt bleached out of greed force the point of habit eyes burn
in a rabbit push the pain test button spines cut trip mucous inflection
more die. pills each day what goes around comes back stronger tap into
the brain break the skull again smash price research rat lab rent pain
in flesh more ill drug store sales sharpen the knife emphasis on money
new disease everyday end is seen and coming reseach turns it's back
to gain crush the spine genocide kitten drags its dead limb continuing
all suffering it will come back and win shock paralyse turn trauma
burns out the will to live the lying message 5 year genocide 1945 suicide
