(a dream) rest low tar spell fatigue vermin crawling in livid  gnaws
fasting on tic and a flea in vain again agro flight not taking fasting
on deception in the making turns two against three penny save a
penny worth crystal marble powder shot glass overflow dreams amaze me
time escapes me mirror shades what should be flight not taking rest
a bodies burning compose ears of rock guilty grey formaldehyde cripples
hound a wheelchair guilty grey a wheelchair hounds you asshole dead palsey
blue stupid thaw cuts the jaw hell piss fuck head rest pure acid hell
filthy word mutation laughing hound hereafter stupid clown you asshole
