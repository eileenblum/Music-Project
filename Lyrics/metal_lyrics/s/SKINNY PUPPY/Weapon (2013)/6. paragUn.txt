yeah .. were gonna all see
a truth born sayer or a weapon to deceive
turn of a switch if you think you still can dream
a calculated risk for all sheep while sleeping
i challenge you to take a hard look
at just what's creeping there behind their truth
a salivating, toothless, crooked root thanG
is sucking on and on gag gag

got knife back it up fight gottA find a reason to slice in
can't forget the piece of the pie
a poison we cant get away from
got a knife back a nation feel the class system closing in
like an abscess in the back of the neck
gottA keep the mind on intention

radiate feeling baked catch the high high
sure this season seems so clean
a filibuster dusting all the cesium leaves
a low grade dose of a rabbit up the sleeve
a card trick release from the pretty fuel fleas
i'm getting sick from the way we all look
in the face of annihilation under a jack boot
an ass ripping particle base disguise
take me back to times of black plague lies

radiate feeling baked catch the high high
make it up pass the buck .. fuck fuck
