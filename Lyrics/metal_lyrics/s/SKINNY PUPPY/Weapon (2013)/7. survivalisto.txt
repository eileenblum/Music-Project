serving, testing, armed race begun.
depleted, geranium, flower with power of sun.
complex, militant, woven ingrained us all.
time bomb, elegant, cast system gun[?].
I want a way out to get out fast

living grade, construct, feeds on reconstruction.
mercenary, contracts, nothing lay under the sun.
six gun, neighbors, watch villages slide.
unibombed, contracts, set the system on fire
I want a way out to get out fast
before it becomes too real,
they want a war in this futures mess

target faced with shadowed voice,
keeping massive overflow from sweeping it away

dipped cone, warhead, tripled atomic drones.
I want a way out to get out fast
before it becomes too real,
they want a war in this futures mess
extinction I think is for real

before it becomes too real,
