linger tasting rotten soil
within the baker's deadly toll
in the morning's dirty rash
the rush hours kissing ass
finger through the dirty things
inside and out of everything
skirmish on the outer edges
of every single body's mind
simmer on the holy scale
these vision makers only fail
the FEAR OF GOD ON HIGH

i've been out, so out of it
i've been hiding out
i've been hiding out of it
hiding so far out.

this been toasted walk upon
then giving up what we've become
all cinders on this rocky road
melted ice cream over load
jump the prison plan advised
we'll make you feel the jim jones' vibe
as if to drink their poison
somehow better than what we become
by vaporizing any of this wishful unsafe trip
catch the very essence draining
on this slowly sinking ship
moving on towards horizons
what's conceived will never be
i'm thinking of saying of anything
and clinging

i've been out, so out of it
i've been hiding out
i've been hiding out of it
hiding so far out.

find a way back out
what a way back out...
