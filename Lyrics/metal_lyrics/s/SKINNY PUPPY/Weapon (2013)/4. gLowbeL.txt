She'd twist, let it slip
And I might remember when
Cancer was a chance to connect the dots
She'd proceed on the dark then
millisievert REM attack on the dream of a bureaucrat
millimeters from the heart, ask for nothing, give nothing back
James Smith resurrect off the tip of another's tongue
mesmerize anytime
ghost with the ambient gun

Crack in the bed
Crack in the wall to see through
Crack in the smokeless vaporing
what is make believe

smell fresh odorless
smell Earth and the steam comes home
smell fresh odorless
there's a party there in there I swear I know

Crack in the bed
Crack in the wall to see through
Crack in the smokeless vaporing
what is like believing
Crack what is needed
Crack in the wall to see through
Crack smokeless vaporing
What is worth believing?

Crack
