silence the deadly golden cry out don't stay behind
stay up internal breakdown bloodflow drip from the eyes
incest the inner reason fast life lay in decline
sank back in fresh arrival face split with life so why
remorse a heartless soul senseless no apparent self control
since then cold uncaring accusations run wild
accelerate the heartbeat or so seen with their eyes
twisting with truth or fact a kind of story that lies
motion sickness is screaming stab cut retard my mind
tiresome a sacred leader sensations more than die
fortune is worshiped highly one day to pray then die
melting in fiery sand quick sink in false so high
over erase replace cancel the way a trial
