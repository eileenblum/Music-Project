A police state invents you
Give me your name
Your birth reconnects you
To a number and age
To see throught the mountain
Master and serf
A failed-state connects us

This is a criminal age [5x]

The threat aside us
Blow-back reblame
So we are the suspect
Again and again
A terrorist is suspect
A terrorist is blamed
We're the receivers
Living in a game

This is a criminal age [5x]
