(Dig it dig it)
Love cannot attach itself to binding ugliness
rot in silence to advise life
the point at hand indifference
resolving of each others needs dress it up in false kindness
create empathy
hungry lie beside name
your game
feelings feeling
sorry that I ever came dissolve taste sweet
nothing corporate
nothing illogical of own accord
with choice of politics
open your eyes to verify the life experience
practitioner of medicine belong until the end
bringing hope scars the point extend eternity

(Dig it dig it)
execute economic slave
(Dig it dig it)
fill it unearthly remains
(Dig it dig it)
freedom as an offering
(Dig it dig it) ask again

flesh and bone attach itself to ancient monuments
unsurpassed except for us unheard violence departure from the fragrant
ledge fallen magistrate give it back a claim to right value
ecstasy hungry live
decide name
your game
feelings feeling
sorry that I ever came sugar and water dissolves the taste sweet nothing

(Dig it dig it)
execute economic slave
(Dig it dig it)
fill it unearthly remains
(Dig it dig it)
freedom as an offering
(Dig it dig it) ask again

(D...Do ya hear that?
The music.
A band.
Do you hear it?
There's somebody here!)

(Halleluja)

boils bitten haggard pick
vomit kicking out
razor slide
black eye shroud
brain bespattered
jaw retaliate begrudgingly
precise as what it seems fear of claim upon the cyst
pent up carnal grin live decide name your game feelings feeling sorry that I ever came too far away game game

(Dig it dig it)
execute economic slave
(Dig it dig it)
fill it unearthly remains
(Dig it dig it)
freedom as an offering
(Dig it dig it)
ask again ask again ask again
