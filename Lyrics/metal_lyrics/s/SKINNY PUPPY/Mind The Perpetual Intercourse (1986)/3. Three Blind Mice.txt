fascists can you hear it has begun seen the devil the outlived symptom
under the scream impress again shadow ways to do and joins from
everywhere treats my fallen character with no respect to taking goals away taking it all in
diminutive drown to live the hope of anything obscene is so obscure
do it again installing precious policy do it again Bolshevik craze on pretty days do it again
three blind mice posture crumbling it has begun in part a life time decaying from
within maybe it was definitely watch her creeping in owner shape the credit or stipulate

 the wind visible all to see constantly
in reaping the harvest eating the grain so show you
it's gone everything I had sperima a strip away
do it again installing precious policy do it again Bolshevik craze on pretty days do it again the harvest
bromine bucket pile it has been done not double no one forever gone took and took within
a black ribbon
