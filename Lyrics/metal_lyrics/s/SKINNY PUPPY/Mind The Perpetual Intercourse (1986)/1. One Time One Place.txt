in the rain collapse cross out which way we'll go honest the ever last

while the wind attacks the past truth at times so shallow develop an attitude
more time decay relapse in fortify the self cutter inbred and forever more

what a way what a life these wonât protect me forever away
faith bleeding eyes conjure pain distant so distant blood life take away
cold the war fast forward owning self destruction and all achieve a missile
tests mortifying flash huddles 'round the radio tube console to control
alive saw the arm levels of toxic waste disgrace the intolerant
all that's been done built up for a future race that's never worn
faith from god meet the maker's face distant book in time forever hate
that's mine blown fuse shortens with man's progression decipher what's
relative legal beaurocrat push us with a tender finger whose politics are
those with an X man overcame further as you left him black/blind two gaping holes
undriven carnivore nature's regret of all things brutalized and can it be
that need no time/town what a way to let go desperate/faithblood make face visionary

vestulate at bestulate at bestulate at bestulate at best at best
that's all there is in a gleam halo all jaded weakness corruption
runs harmonious begin by extremes doorway extinction resist
repression is based on god for a length of time full of elemental powers
inbred and not brilliant no fortune could buy this power away
