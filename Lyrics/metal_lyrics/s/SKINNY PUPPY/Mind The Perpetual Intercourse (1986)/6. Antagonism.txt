flesh makes a stretch through the hoop again no faults nothing ever gained
livid fear, our time has come about what was believed now turned inside out
drastic hate, frantic air growing up while inching near a reason no throwing
back down in it's place cutting in with open space cancer in each new cell
rotting food left on the shelf

alive yet unaware asking do you really care
Nivek, rehgard with care witness our philosophy

melting features came to the light remains burn out comes rushing back again
cold claws lifeless abject hate power unleashed a vagrant mind in bits
grasping for warm embrace detest all views of place remember...

alive yet unaware asking do you really care alive alive

exiting crystal set view left below no truth now burning bright inside
absinthe grows cold open scar on the wall disregarded no bitter rotten
flames rip and follow break through never saw this inching near enough
fleeting, the image cracks ripping past the frame love's never came
wrapping the face dripping blade in love receding wrenching the image cell
who will decide what goals we set

alive yet unaware asking do you really care

listen as the hours pass back on the bridge again rebuild
nothing's quite the same slipped poison cancer central brain retracing
he steps so easily mislaid knife in my hand so don't you make demands
discorse at times or is it just in my mind

alive yet unaware asking do you really care
oh my god my god help me god help me
witness eyes eyes reveal witness eyes eyes quickening
