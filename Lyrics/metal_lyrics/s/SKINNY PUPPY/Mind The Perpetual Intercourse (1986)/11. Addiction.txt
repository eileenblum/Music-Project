desperate deranged talking in my sleep again eyes twitch
retain a sentimental something looked lorn and we burned and burned
I was a cinder body soul in my dreams breakdown amidst the mixtures
avoid addictive plea responding disillusion encrusted cruelty decribe
why nails enclose me eating so evenly there exists a lot of reasons
to support fatality abstience possessed hardly what you think it is
hearts beat positive provided there's progress ignorance does insist of
the right coffin took some food offered me can't see myself drank the
wine wished the feverish burst of terror breakdown amidst the
mixtures avoid addictive plea insist that nothing happened chilled
bloodless fatigue recharge with bitterness fanatics beckoning mistook
a look impassioned absorbed with clarity consciousness drifts away
discarded memory packaged shelf life bad display breakdown amidst
the mixtures avoid addictive plea excessive near romances comfort
is treachery so pound the nails in tight eyes screaming out of sight
against a grain like curtain unbearably alive
