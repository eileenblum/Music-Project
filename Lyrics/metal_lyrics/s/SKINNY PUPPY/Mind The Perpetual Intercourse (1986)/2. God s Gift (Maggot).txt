to a life left screaming cry this holy god mercury with no degree
early lies to blaspheme eye sky sky's the limit
deceiving in this darkened splay growing back at the invoid
you're bloody righteous declare the light wounding
forever judgment of his righteousness
certain man feel the pain falling back a name overture
gentle black we're falling down knives in the eyes maggots fill the brain
falling down falling power away reign rain atomic grin on the floor
in the pool of blood on lifeless grin
back to the bedroom with a grin where
the master walks down the phantoms
living out the miseries
it's hard to fathom walk to the bedroom come
it's hard to fathom
hot to give maggots
god gave maggots god gave maggots
god give maggots god gift maggots
I saw it heal the fate no less then back again
open wound in a splash on the side as backwash
god gave us maggots god gave us maggots
god gives maggots god gives maggots
isn't a way back the bedroom/grin
go scription away
devils missing ghostly remain
never win again no route winning
constellation of love/life
prize work prize work easier
god winning winning the genitals fading
black sunrise a coerce is the easy road to survive
lunatic ration your motion gone motion back again
moshe god gives maggots god gives maggots
god gives maggots
my friend maggot
life built
maggot
