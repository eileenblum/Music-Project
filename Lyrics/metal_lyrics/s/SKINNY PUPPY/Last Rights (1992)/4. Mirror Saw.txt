"Through the window, blowing in,  message ensured
walk within car passes terminal empty cracks started
showing through unlisted mystery a dead child was thrown
through a window wind opens windows carry promises true will unleash us
dogs bite flesh, biting, exposing,
freezing the soul, whirlwind blowing through the
crashes ceiling no fantasies gone ages ago
crashes through privacy gone ages ago
freezes hands, pale, lighter,
frozen paintings, illumination, illumination gone,
illumination, illumination gone, illumination not wrong,
sides heaving, chest boxed in, I will find the real
you/finally heal you, lighter, hand in smokes,
my treasures, there to know, I write a note,
tossed aside, tossed aside, shines through a
powder, baby the real you, blood shines through a powder,
reads the real you, love shines through a
powder, feel the real you, shines
through a powder, final curtain, what's become of me and you?"
