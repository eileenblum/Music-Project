"a leech, passing unseen, kicked in mouth, firm, will prove sex slave, all 
encomapsses high, gets you by, broken glass in a crystal blown problem room, 
and one day you will have no one to run to, sell the satisfyer, runs the 
genitals down, no sensation, promise your heart to the (slut who last) slept 
in your bed, in you head, in your head, where it must have some reason, all 
I said in you head, all I said, all I said, nowhere nowhere nowhere to run 
to nowhere nowhere nowhere to run to looking back, looking back looking 
back, one of two looks back, wonder which is real, and the naked arm that, 
you will see the truth so what, your gift is misused your gift is misused 
your gift is not used, not used at all when it is done you will have no one 
to run to no one to run to."
