level edge backs against the ledge no knives the stone hard eyes
without the longing or fear that it would disappear they cling on nuturing
never ending obsessions on the table lines needed walls cover tips the balance
don't touch me wiped out cornering mouthed the word money head
shake handshake out to get a long way from corrosion pushes closer
to the edge wired not connected peeling back plastic wrap tinted green
and all illusion existing caught up crossfire trading tall tales where
are you going where do you fail whats that mean back and forth side
by side loose knot weave keep it up altogether or whatever that means passing
underneath the trespass dont get to close mouth the word your money if I
fade I may and I want to fade away all that I do is pray that you will be
there too if this were trying to deceive some minds what the hell
do you got to say? altogether
