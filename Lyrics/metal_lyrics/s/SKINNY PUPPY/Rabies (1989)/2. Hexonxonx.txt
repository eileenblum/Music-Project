miles cable claws driller killer ripping holes tattered cloth stained
regaining the weather acid rains so sweet sweat streaks downpour
on humidity colder time talking hints watching tests the heat mangled meat
retaliate no blaming in future dreams could you have stopped it
from happening best left spectator spectacle time spaced fast paced
farther down all that trigger guaging cause kills at will melted prophets book
burning how undone written slurs the meaning the past they will repeat
hard to hit so unbeat melting prophets the past melting undone misted
fable role altogether mutating chains rattle happy to perform either
war or famine no where arid food growing warming trends a place passive
cows to feed the weak product waste give back nothing orders come in
make a million living things suffer hidden glad garbage body bag what
of that change that could save everything that paper shredder patent tender
puts us back in time again budgets that burst with oil crude gas in
purse no compassion common criminals seek asylum concrete pillow exxon dreams
hidden hiarchy no one in power taking blame
