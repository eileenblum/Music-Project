Trip along dusty road
Care denounce no overload
In as much as what's become
A sterile cracked up iceberg tomb
Mist on ash on murky shore
Now begin don't let it show
Answers even without feeling
No fulfilling close the door

Last call
Open bar
Never closing
Go beyond
Last call
Shallow pond
Slow descending
So slow to drown

Match the perfect DNA
Switch pretend at last to see
Consolations is a fee
Respectfully to never be
Symbolized simile
Put in words so simply
Ask direction
No correction
Map the course to end of way
Hypocrisy

Last call
Open bar
Slow deceiving
So reach beyond
Last call
A shallow pond
Slow descending
So slow to drown

[vocal manipulation]

You make believe

Last call
Open bar
Never closing
Reach beyond
Last call
Shallow pond
Slow descending
So slow to drown

Cast a wishful air
Walk among do seem to care
On the surface righteous air
Deliver on the right to share
Mesh the fine nucleic bond
Crawl between the chromosome
On the top of what's begun
A truthful generation burn

[vocal manipulation]

Last call
Open bar
Slow deceiving
Reach beyond
Last call
A shallow pond
Slow deceiving
So slow to drown
