Passing ghosts heres the host
Talk of nothing matters most
Urban fracture whats the matter
Only I am lost
Rip blade doomsday cut string
Way they go away
Die love
Icebreaker
Are words misused
Enough those shameless view
Icebreaker
Shall sail right through
Cold mirror
Gives icy clues
Notice shells ails the well
Smell of hell dosed phantoms will
Future answer does it matter
Deaths the only thrill
