Tarnish away
Tarnish

Simple test at best
All is nothing less
Run for more
I can't decide
Love in the grass
All is nothing less
Rather
You look me in the eye
Your face creeping in
Your caring thankless grin
Immobilize the second sin
Create the mood that's dark and grim

???
How I depart
Mood altered
Paradise is lost
Maskover
No one left in dark
Hide the trap
Caution
Deadline remark
???
Burns your skin
Known so long
Feels like the next of kin
???
How I depart
Deadline
Deadline remark

Rose hip
A shallow kiss chauvinistic go look inside
Whilst in the back a gold to lead to resurrect whats
Left to die
