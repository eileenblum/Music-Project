Torment a stench
One side inside
No doubt lost count
Brutalize the half red eyes
Decide which side whose side
You're in the middle of the fire
A scythe and smock is sharp so sharp

No conscience
Such confidence
Your crooked ear
So insincere
Your glue on smile
Your social style
Tyrants rule is such a fool

Superior good advice
It's so nice from you
Arguments so hideous
They're heaven sent
You can't repent
Words like ice cut and slice
Announce my demise
Christ why'd you die

No conscience
Such confidence
Your crooked ear
So insincere
Your glue on smile
Your social style
Tyrants rule is such a fool

Superior good advice
Blood red and arguments
Heaven sent torment my stench
Putrefy putrefy
Wise so wise you're not so wise
Shadow shadow shadow why
