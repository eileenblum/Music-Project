event width two path given pure force downs
turns the screw crawl in back

in term space a time to intrude
in term peace assuring a future

silence noise forming sound like silent noise
silent voice screaming hints retaliation

heinous plans in sides remain taking downs taking aim
filling curses two conditions back upon itself

pass it off as good intentions leaving marks hard to heal
reassisted retrogression leaving tracks path reveals
sample act reflected clears noticed thought while leaving hears
nuisance labels paranoia so stupid how perceived that way

silent claws shredding flaws hungers knawing
silent flaws forever laughter silence knows

shaman stands retreating all is over evermore smoke the
curse your creation back upon yourself

pushes distress closer to the edge one time cracks lights
the walls worry wasted hearing clouds up above the
chatter digging deep insider storms to find the inner
patience erasing shadowed gifted ruin haste retracing
promised news leaving statement meant as nothing
starving your words no excuses

silent truth asserts its proof like you abhor
