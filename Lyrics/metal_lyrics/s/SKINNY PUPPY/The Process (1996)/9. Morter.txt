killer in the morning scent of rain come on
fills the part put on me stranger ive been shown
less we love and know how were just morter filling holes
the glass eyed creature creaks the broken floors

teller lazy sky tales find your rate and pace
reinvent uniqueness adjust the outer face

planning pits diversions pusher rap downfall
take the crap sold as fact hallelujah clueless
the ship shine cellar albatross burned down find a way across
strangle hold albatross around my neck is sinking

psycho hymns too high the fee one step back to sanity

were all addicted anyway
