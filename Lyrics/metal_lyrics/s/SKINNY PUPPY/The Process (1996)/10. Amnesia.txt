for reasons untold born a body mass no excuse for
intolerable kick set in glass grasp a moment shattered

a lock on the door scraping demon trapped resides
starving for freedom all my strength to keep inside

tear it down

if I could move heaven or hell I would

to summon heads rush all perception void and meaningless
anti fathoms life in spite of it negate all feeling fractured
mocked deplore naming reverse remote viewing
empathic lesion surrounding the guilt cannot deny

tear it down a process to describe
whatever truth means nothing

when adding no results times a shallow digging through
the mud thrown out so expectable intentions not up front
and the shit that never faced reflects the sliver
looped a flaw rotates forever unresolved

tear it down
