good and evil does not exist(? CHRIST?)
fix the outcome overall playing into follow along
face the weak bland righteousness
deliver them or kill them dead
shorter now god
and the demise patience cries the burning cross

confessions alter bugger faith
moisten gland insert and taste

shorter nw a god lies rich
forced upon a sinners itch
kept a box locked in tight
slaves reward reserved in spite
drive across and burn incense

this is the god to save your soul
water burns holy
kill the faith inside of you
watch the killing starts
after you accept the part
to redirect your mind
whisper the name
all is not so black and white
