a lasting moment to hold onto with regret the scent of time
tried and tested I never noticed the phantoms of her mind
cresent moon im cutting through paste up warnings fill the sky
smoking embers I remember time and time again to try
to live I light to sink within her I think of light

time to blame to borrow from your past elapsed
collapsing

shes not insane
shes gone insane

and if the root of silence pulls me off and love is lost not
from my heart I sit upon this throne that throws me off

and she falls backward to the floor and forward to the back
she says elapses all my truth again shes the one I live for I live alone

burns inside horilbly she lifts me to the spirit burns
the darkest hours my corrupt brain is hurting
once again the door lies quiet left alone im thinking of her
sitting the burning clock of time
