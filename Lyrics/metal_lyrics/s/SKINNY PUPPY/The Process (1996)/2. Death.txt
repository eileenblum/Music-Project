holding his hands
dream the whole week
radiance hissing rodent speak
elective evil once started
shot struck home so it goes

inches towards flattened back
on all fours drawn and racked
doesn't mean a thing

nature perverts itself so it goes
so what the hell let it grow
regret so full of haste coming clear
piss in blood
no one should ever have to

cut assemble resembled
played out wording disturbing
quiet saying relaying
a message raising cain's revenge

got a few no fucking whacked house of cards dealing smack
crimson scolding driving told im never holding one thing
back credit full of nothing slither here one thing back
licking dogs no hook no song feeling high fantasize wonder
why suck them dry choppy waves take a dive

crash enable disabled
effect not carried no power in
quiet playing resaying never more never again

distort the monomaniac
delivering the blow
core rotten bone

distort the monomaniac
black mass held upon the radio
doesn't mean a thing

be it what or ever could
doesn't mean a thing
sinister creation doesn't mean a thing
evocation of the dead
moses forbidding it
doesn't mean a thing

worm like ticking art worth shit
we play upon the things we fear
the smell is foul where does it fit
screw yourself go screw yourself
no one should ever have to

how do you sleep when its still alive
never to deep take a look inside
