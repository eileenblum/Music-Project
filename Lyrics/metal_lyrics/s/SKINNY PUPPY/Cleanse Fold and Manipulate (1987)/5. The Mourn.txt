along the cracked in floors dripping on the floor hter
sits a doctor murder samurai hit numbers calling gave up all old eye
shy nose on the wall a cracking membrane turn the message those eyes
warn and pull out the young eye why arms creak wishing higher caught
the point whore introvert maybe she'll have a chance one day but the
world watches with heart rid her arms out rip her arms out rip out
