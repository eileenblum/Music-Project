live within four walls scrape insect infested dreams
cancer cornered worn accepting misery as a way of dealing within
this  complex fantasy which way or how to say is this ordinary terror force
the rain boiling over lifeless flame fear pays a healthy wage leaves its
trail in well planned pain crave whisper fall ride corrodes neglected
dream scalding of organs slowly rotting in the time to understand a body
degeneration reluctant soul search within a dying civilation fill
cracks with plaster hides all unbalanced things a shade to pale
of late features sunken in if all were to dissolve not to interpret literally
a mindless mat that minds itself void of expressing anything that
need be in order to believe then to substantiate by falling ungraciously
at the brother's feet used solely to defeat back around it gleams time
again terror nerves on edge no where safe to populate whose side to liberate
genocide applied with subtlety terror shadowed dream no chance
ending callous reign fear not rise up to stay the beast no moving
frozen are the meek
