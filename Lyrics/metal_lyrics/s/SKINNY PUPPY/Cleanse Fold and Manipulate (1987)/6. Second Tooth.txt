(not much need) distraught wake up in sweat
something is very different no water hot or cold walk out in the street
greet the morning gun battles needless no need to understand in
a foreign land with gun in hand killing is respected a way of showing
faith in a country's need to exercise death penalities where were you
now in the chair to burn twenty years ago killing red in nam who
is worse when war is far away not much for sympathy a number count
of casualties return so burned with nothing left to learn murder now invigorates
the unwashed bloody hands kill again let the family burn
do little to comfort anguishing no decision could ever warrant
this war is just a childrens game no pretending dead why? dear god whom
we project its useless killing children to satisfy the arms budgets
who walks right or left a child won't give a damn nations arise to reason
the conceptions threatened for economic steps is it time to shut down
and lay to rest the bomb that servant suicide object worshipped
like a god be there now blown clear the human race what use is there of
figures the wrote wordless statistic names and numbers now seem out
of place a paper representating life blowing down the street kill again
