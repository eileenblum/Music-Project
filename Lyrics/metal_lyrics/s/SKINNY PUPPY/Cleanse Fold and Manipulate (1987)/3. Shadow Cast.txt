magnified fear stares back the mirror reflect
depravity the shadow cast a feeling of ill harmony so crisp the famines
itch a withering shoreline tears of grey interspersed with withered fruit
her gloomy banquet of cheer heaven what a sweet pain douse the
ecstasy the imagination drained away perpetual reverie abruptly fade
heavens soothing some say tremulous hand jabs from behind sticks
in the back for all to see organs spilled leak of will void of secrecy
genuine tears delights the taste pain salts the bitter brew rich in guilt
to absorb the filth she worships a point of view scarce the thousand
remnants black charred flesh a victim screaming through heaven or
hell what's the difference one to believe in one to live in careful
balancing what's hell to heavens only flame
