lovers and legions i've seen your whore try not to reason forsaken i'm poor
fire nerves and dissension flying at a glare a ginger reaction whisper care
a hairpin decision falls against the brain
to formulate the anguish and alleviate the pain
the silence is warning soul search nothing can't regain reach for air
scenes of a cheap thrill summon an old ghost
the foremost and sterile suffering one lost to
face the potential for fantasy and flair forever and forgiving summon
me and dare they keep on the mainstream forging their demise while
playing with the hopeless not facing their own lies
the symptoms of recourse i've seen nothing
overspill far too frail.
