early one morning shattering life in the face
the finest creative loss of grace
out of heartshot with no hope meet the people try to cope
nod the head with distraction faces flirt for your reaction
with a grin over again start the day anothers whim
nice to nightmare she's a sleeping beast
lie the same dear anguish is your feast
frighten the peaceful powerless thought in the head
with decree attorney singe my dread
in the darkness know it well siege of face love to tell
how and why its indecision notice change by shapeshifting
from the real sacred seal rip with sex intelligent sneer
resist the useless aggravation kicked in teeth
the blankness created forms a wreath
slap the coffin hear no shout feel the courage seeping out
plunge the knife with no reason slash the name within season
slump retreat run again ride the pain going insane
very same morning shattering life in the face the finest creative
loss of grace find the truth far to down bring it up sense will drown
inside review sense elation can't regain the motivation
piercing probing is disturbing drove to me i'm not worth knowing
