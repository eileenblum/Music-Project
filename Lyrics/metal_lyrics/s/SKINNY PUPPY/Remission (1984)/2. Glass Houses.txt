sit in darkness understand what i am is what i am
overshadowed by assertion makes me certain
solemn ponder wander shake shaded with a doubt nightmare full of fear
solvent raining from the sky backlog danger hypnotize glass blown eyes
stain in drain on procreate fascinate me instigate care to here morbid
desert ice cream eyes so deceiving fraternize carefully
create vision fabricate smash to pieces watch and wait crash glass houses
hasten grasp calculate foreign object phornicate smash glass houses
misinterpret reprimand are you here myself demands
mediocre are you hearing headspace clearing
