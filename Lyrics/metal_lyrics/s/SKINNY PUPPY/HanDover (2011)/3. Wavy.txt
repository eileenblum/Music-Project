Living on and on
Within a shell
Of future war
Destructive home
Over here
The air is gone
Sold for songs
So faustian
The shortened seasons
Now have left
The dream now
Wicked shadows cast
The scenes left feeling
For the poor
Distressed
They comp a war
They start a war
[x8]
So slowly changing
Guns of wavy rainy
Sounds of radar
So slowly changing
And you'll find out
If this is so awful
So slowly changing
[x4]
So slowly changing
Guns of wavy rainy
Sounds of radar
So slowly changing
And you'll find out
If this is so awful
So slowly changing
