Freeze from a part all endings the same
Free from a part the part that's in the way
Boring they're bleeding beyond this fakeness
They think their inner lies suck it's a sign of something anyway
Let brain rise size no mesmerize disease
Aligned with the disguise
Doubt eyes in foreskin lies
What lines divides the inner suicides
Aligned with darkened skies
Aligned within the lies
Formless warning all eyes oversee
They're phoning in their warming trends to delegate the needs
Of a better state of mind to openly deceive
(That's not the mushroom hedge fund people living off the strawberry)
Froze from the start still life no breath such peaceful separation
Froze from the start still life no breath such peaceful separation
Making the seamless market make it up with fornication
Let brain wide sends a place to hide our lies
Black projects synthesize
Elements that recognize
The open eyes so eager now disguise
A new belief some laws and lies the system eyes
Seeing is believing what to see
Seeing what you're seeing doesn't seem to be the way to be
Seeing is believing what to see
Fleeing what you're seeing doesn't seem to be the way to be
