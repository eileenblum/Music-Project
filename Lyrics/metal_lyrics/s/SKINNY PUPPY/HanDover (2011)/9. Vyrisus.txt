A virus is a friendless sign that nothing can be swayed
A virus can deter the climb the body temp evades
In order to deny this state of timeless here to stay
The doctor is the occupant and the victim's in the grave
In order to insure the cure
We kill the host cook the toast
Carefully the climb what a time left to decline
Get up Get on The roof Get up Get up
Get up Get on With it
Pick up Pick on The Truth Pick up Pick up
Pick up Pick up On it
Light of days goes by by go bye bye go buy
Slippery the unwashed hands slithering away
The virus has become the mind now kill the host invade
In it find the first of last useful hints to fast to freeze
Cooking up the atmosphere to listen in and see
Get up Get on The roof Get up Get up
Get up Get on With it
Pick up Pick on The Truth Pick up Pick up
Pick up Pick up On it
Light of days goes by by go bye bye go buy
Why are we shooting out our only remedy
Stabbing at the center while tearing up the trees
Why do we need to mutter anything
Fighting inner demons from a vision faded screen
Get up Get on The roof Get up Get up
Get up Get on With it
Pick up Pick on The Truth Pick up Pick up
Pick up Pick up On it
