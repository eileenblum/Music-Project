Yeah yeah yeah
It's there can they feel it
It's there can they see it
Yeah yeah yeah
I woke up
The love is racing
Don't get
A time to be
You're gone
??
Get out
Drilling
??
Drown in
What it must believe in
What more
Unearth and see this
All the deeds
A treat what a way to be
Something
Of next to ??
??
Of ocean seas
Go on
Drilling
Not to begin
Knockout
Don't get up again
Clean up
Never clean that spill
??
Filtered swim
Cut their
Uncross their feet again
Suck it to suck it up again
Good night!
Feel my
You can feel me
You can feel me
Feel my
You can feel me
Keep it at your feet
Keep it up keep it up
(Feel my) Feel what you need
Unhealthy radiation on the back at the roller coaster
Going somewhere up and down
Facing left or right
What is -
Come across like it
Feel my sight
