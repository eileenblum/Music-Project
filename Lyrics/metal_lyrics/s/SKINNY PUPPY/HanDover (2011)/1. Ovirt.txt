We have found in past excuses
Shrinking hands extending service
Like some ill bought warranty
Selfish terms to suit the day
Before the shady last decision
Shameless squanders nose and vision
Off towards that well bought place
To spite the nose right in your face

Look inside that dirty hole
What is there left overthrown
Over there nothing is known
Another place to dig that hole

Mumbled like the clever clueless
Building moles to hills that throw off
What's inside that mighty mountain
Hollow is the core alive
Makeshift plans to take control of
You're the island no one flies to
Waiting for the understanding
Never coming to your land

Look inside your eyes behold
Back toward what's over sold
Over there is nothing grown
Over here is over gone

Whose been making feeling faking
All that stutters left beside
Churning fast stir the fat and
Kills you while its sleepless

Who knows who the thief is
His truth is in the secret
It's something you believe in

Come away and fall with me
Go away and falter
