Under a cave-in beaten
Educated and believes
Unload a gun the sun
Into the breach from which it came

Aside from writing walls up
Put on as if facts to see
Reactions cause deferral
From a passed on future's needs

Pissing on clocks uncertain
Heavy breathingâcan he breathe?
This test is way past stress points
Pushes buttonsâfull release

They change the world for certain
Meaning and false profits made
We're spending all the future
Future's never ours to see

Hang it up
(Spin with contented vision)
Back it out
(Put it back in its place)
Fade for what my black eyes colorize
Pack it up
(Stop losing opposition)
Shake it out
(Putting up with this place)
Stained, bloodied eyes red full of liesâcolorize

Fade out in one act
Overturning neverending dream
All coming caught up in
The moments we can never see

Aside from writing walls up (forever hating)
Put on as if facts to see (forever getting)
Reactions cause deferral (forever taking taking taking...)
From a passed on future's needs

Hang it up
(Spin with contented vision)
Back it out
(Put it back in its place)
Fade for what my black eyes colorize
Pack it up
(Stop losing opposition)
Shake it out
(Putting up with this place)
Stained, bloodied eyes red full of liesâcolorize

The party's lost a lot of cash and forest for the trees
They've made a mistake and I'm never older than my trees

Eyes gonna hate
Want want wanna wanna wake up
Wanna wanna wake up
Eyes don't hate what
Wanna wanna wake up
Wanna wake up
Wanna wanna wake up

Eyes gonna hate that (eyes don't hate what)
Wanna wanna wake up (wanna wanna wake up)
Eyes gonna hate that (wanna wake up)
Wanna wanna wake up (wanna wanna wake up)

Eyes don't fake that (eyes gonna that that)
Wanna want to make up (wanna wanna wake up)
Otherwise face it (wanna wake up)
Never... ever... (wanna wanna wake up)

Eyes don't fake that
Eyes gonna hate that
Wanna wake wake up
Wanna wanna wake up
