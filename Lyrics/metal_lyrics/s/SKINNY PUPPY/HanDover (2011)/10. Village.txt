Ask the tinfoil watching to answer back
Spinning the chemtrails like a knife in the back
This whole skys falling thing now you see underneath
You tortured me now I'm lying on my back
Floating rhythm EMF frying flying pan
I'm just an egg so ready to crack
Cooking from the inside yeah I'm ready to crack
All sides rape and pillage tripping in the village
Collapse collapse
All sides pay the lie cause it's happening now
Relax
Collapse collapse
Relax
Hook up the moonwalk
Angles sunlight
Maybe it couldn't be
Held together by a paperclip
In a calculated dream
You set me up
As if I cut my wrists
Eyes just couldn't see
To build a wreck upon this ship of busted broken dreams
You tortured me now I'm lying on my back
Floating rhythm EMF frying flying pan
I'm just an egg so ready to crack
Cooking from the inside yeah I'm ready to crack
All sides lying naked playing in the village
Collapse collapse
All sides make me laugh cause it's happening now
Relax
(I'm the delusion who fell through the crack
Like an ace in a deck)
