Hey ya wake up sleepy head bling bling to the game
Slacking over again what is given up instead of
A million miles of pain friend
I see ya in another dream
Warmest disconnect by keeping all eyes in the dark
Smiling pushing through it all in the pain hidden in the pain
Looking through the pain looking out again to see right through
My heart can't contain the missing fragments of memories
Shaken by the rain looking out to gain a point of view
My heart can't contain the missing fragments of memories
But I've seen right through
But I can't see you
Making my way he said
Disconnect your memories set to get an honest day free
But ever wash right dickheads at my words
It's crazy to see me as I threw my mass at glass in pain
Leaning through a window now he's let it go
So let it be
He's free
Freer than me
Freer than me
Freer than me
Warmest disconnect by keeping all eyes in the dark
Smiling pushing through it all
Hidden in the pain hidden in the pain
(warmest) looking through the pain looking out again to see right through
My heart can't contain the missing fragments of memories
(warmest) shaken by the rain looking out to gain a point of view
My heart can't contain the missing fragments of memories
(warmest) looking through the pain looking out again to see right through
My heart can't contain the missing fragments of memories
(warmest) shaken by the rain looking out to gain a point of view
Heart can't contain the missing fragments of memories
