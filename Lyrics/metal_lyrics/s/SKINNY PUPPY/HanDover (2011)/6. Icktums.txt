Burned in rates
The sea of hates
Our miss
Items charged, items charged
(More more more more more more)
(More more more and more more no more)
All the freak
(Piece of shit)
Piece of pipe
(Always the rich)
Noticed baby's dead
(Baby's dead)
Never said, never said
(No more, no more)
Market shined
As he speaks
Usury shift
Adjusted from the rape of man
(Rape of man)
Plastic card bait and switch
Inner demon selling souls
Cryptic lie, left alive
Buildings fall, watch them fall
(Down, down)
All the tricks
(Piece of shit)
In the books
(Always the rich)
Deep inside
(It seems fair)
A voice is screaming
(Take them down)
(No more no more no more no more)
Market slides
Deep inside
As he speaks
Something died
I'll say no money, worship nothing
Worship money, worship nothing
Worship money, worship nothing
Worship money, worship nothing
... Nothing, nothing, nothing
System's overloaded now
We're all involved in
We are nothing
(We're all involved in)
We are nothing
You got nothing
You got nothing
