neuwerld order pissing on a river on the way a long
tomorrow rancid waters picking up the remnants of a
flower in all of us exists the touch of deadly warming
global and trust we must distrust the owners of the
new world order what of the hour of the whole look
what you've been missing feed upon the fingers chew
the knuckle to the bone dig inside the crack beside
the pain that is a home live a distant second skin
whatever else that can fed upon the remnants of a life
that's never had he took a living thing and made a
copy of it an image put the finish on a life still
being made the secret twist invading mists the desert
once a forest can't see the forest for the death
within the tree inside the crack beside the pain that
is a home
