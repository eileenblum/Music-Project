Just looking for something is what to say keep looking
at nothing to go away you take my picture a portrait
prize behind my image your father's eyes just looking
for something NOW it looks like something from far
away inside the image grows and makes the shadow fade
behind the image posted on your wall a crack is hiding
fighting for it all just looking for something NOW
we've taken it somewhere from far away the voices echo
from yesterday behind the crack behind the image on
the wall I see you curled up tightly hiding from it
all just looking for something NOW
