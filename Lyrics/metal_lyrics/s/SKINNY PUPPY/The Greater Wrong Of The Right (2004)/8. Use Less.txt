are we alone mission complete to the unknown this is a
story this is so sorry all is a stone sunk in too deep
run out of air lung full of heavy it's feeling heavy
were we forewarned force it to break labor of hate who
are we fooling what are we doing pin it on time proof
in the meat time to consume does it concern me under a
flag free are we all completely use less are we are we
end is a known sick and alone pieces of dream meant as
a nice theme meant as a nice dream so pause at the end
cause the effect shorten the pain time for reflection
or to regret them
