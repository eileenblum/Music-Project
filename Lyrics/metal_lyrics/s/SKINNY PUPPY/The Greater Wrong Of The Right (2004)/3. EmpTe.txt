beat my head to wake up cause I feel as if I'm
sleeping past is in the heart and I am waiting for the
rhythm feed the holy jaws no saying pain is the answer
after all is gone the story leaves me feeling empty
and all alone it leaves me feeling emptE breathe we
are all animals inside free the spirit is alive to
guide us we're all alone and really feeling empty
we're all alone when all revenge falls apart taken a
step back from the start leaves me feeling empty IT
