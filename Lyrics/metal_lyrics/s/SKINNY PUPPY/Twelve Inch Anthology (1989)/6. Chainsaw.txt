forlorn lists true contempt destruct dripping
red is it time to come clean wash away
everything hold the frame still life focus
ones intent to not be noticed lost in lies
graceful charms losing touch with everyone
management terms and conditions waiting for
own in addition contract is raised
the worlds greatest mortuary self destruct
mechanism introvert overturn assasination
make from steel the ugly weapon killers
instinct from man to trigger peaceful time
direct potentia living through ones own
dimentia come on hold arms dissect division
caress duress invite delusion back moving
through the keyhole trust in keeping a value
judgement overthrown like a somnambulist
twisting and churning in retrospect management
inedible benign applicants crime to everlasting eternal peace
