torment a stench one side inside no doubt lost count
brutalize the half red eyes decide
which side whose side you're in the middle of the fire
a scythe and smock is sharp so sharp
no conscience such confidence a crooked ear so insincere
a glue on smile your social style tyrants rule is such a fool
superior good advice it's so nice from you
arguments so hideous they're heaven sent you can't repent
words like ice cut and slice announce my demise
christ why did you die
superior good advice blood red and arguments
heaven sent torment my stench putrefy putrefy
wise so wise you're not so wise
shadow shadow shadow shadow why?
