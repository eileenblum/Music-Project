A frenzied connection, a devious mind
A single impulse from a functional lie.
Aching together til death do us part.
Manufactured dead, aching, screaming.

Stains from the past, reaching out.
A warmth, a thirst, far greater than lust.
Of all that will be and all that once were
Manufactured dead, screaming, crying

Rage
A part of humanity long forgotten.
Stains
The ever flawless.

By his will or just by chance
Above or below, or just the past
Forever in greed, in sickened lust
Manufactured dead, aching, screaming.

We were the ones who went down below
Modern primates spreading our seeds
Forever in greed, in sickened lust
Forever we stand with no one to trust.

Pleading we stare at the fading sun
Feeding of the ones lost in our

Time
A part of humanity long forgotten.
Stains
The ever flawless.

Never to change
A twitch in existence
Forever in pain
For the sins you committed
A unique kind of breed
With unique kind of needs
Never the change
Never

And forever
You will regret.
The last impulse
Your last breath to change
A twitch in existence

A frenzied connection, a devious mind
A single impulse from a functional lie.
Aching together til death do us part.
Manufactured dead, aching, screaming.

Stains from the past, reaching out.
A warmth, a thirst, far greater than lust.
Of all that will be and all that once were
Manufactured dead, screaming, crying.
