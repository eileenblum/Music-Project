For far too long
I've been hiding under this mask
A grim face a collection of the dread.
All the feelings I've kept.
All the anger I've held.

Well everything's the same
Searching, hiding
Transparent in my sanity
The loss of all my vanity
Searching, hiding
Far beyond dead.

Keep the demon at bay, it's the only way
For me to keep my sanity near.
All the passion I've felt
All the hate I've retaliated
Be my bride

Well everything's the same
Searching, hiding
Transparent in my sanity
The loss of all my vanity
Searching, hiding
Far beyond dead.

Whatever life holds you and I will be one
Together in death awaiting the black sun
Whatever life holds you and I will be one
Together in death awaiting the black sun

I will be the one you really wanna hate

In time the shades will turn to full colour
Await in the wake of a dream
Embedded in the laughs of my mind
Await in the wake of a dream
In time the colours will turn pitch black
Awake from the wake of my dream
Blood red stains in my perfect mind
Lying dead in the wake of my dream

Burning the pages, feeling numb.
Body oh so cold
The mask is off, the demon is free.
Oh so cold

Well everything's the same
Searching, hiding
Transparent in my sanity
The loss of all my vanity
Searching, hiding
Far beyond dead.
