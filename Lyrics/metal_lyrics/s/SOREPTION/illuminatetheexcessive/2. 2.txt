So this is all I've seen
Another dreamless suffering
Shaking the abyss, trembling the dreamland
Burning the fundament of life

To all I've seen,
Repeat

To all I've seen,
Repeat

Turning the possible.
Into pitch black
I'll be forever, forever sedated
Medically dreaming of a life

A scar embedded between two worlds
A thin cut, bleeding, reeking
For all I've done
When the pain is gone
A thin cut, bleeding, reeking
When I hear the kingdom call
A thin cut, bleeding, reeking
A scar embedded between two worlds
A thin cut, bleeding, reeking

Paralyzed existence, a mentally absent void
Bleeding wounds for comfort, torment
Unity for the unique soul-less dreams.
When the dream is over, repeat
Paralyzed existence, a mentally absent void
Bleeding wounds for comfort, torment
Unity for the unique soul-less dreams.
When the dream is over, dying

Behold the fundament of evil inside
Behold the turning of the tide
Awake in a dream or dreaming awake
Get the right wrong and it's probably too late

To die once more, the warmth of the frost
The scars on your back for embracing lust

To all I've seen,
Repeat

To all I've seen,
Repeat

This is all I've seen
Another dreamless suffering
Shaking the abyss
Trembling the dreamland
Burning the fundament of life
