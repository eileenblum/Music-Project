Let this feeling never die
A slow goodbye
Let this feeling never die
Killing my will

A gentle void is growing inside me
Trying to beat the sands of time
My body cries with blood
With warmth to be free
A useless uncontrollable act

Finding the sense in time
Passion or lust
Finding the sense in time
Mind or heart

A gentle void is growing inside me
Trying to beat the sands of time
My body cries with blood
With warmth to be free
A useless uncontrollable act

An emptiness with historic proportions
Apathy
Without the one, the transparent feeding
An emptiness with historic proportions
Apathy
Without the one, the transparent feeding

Let this feeling never die
A slow goodbye
Let this feeling never die
Killing my will

Never to be never to feel
An absolute solution
Complete emptiness what I feel
Like I never lived
Just a thought away from you
Yet a lifetime away
You will never me
Yet a lifetime way

A silent being
A destructive
Silent being
A destructive
Silent being
A destructive
Silent being
A destructive

A gentle void is growing inside me
Trying to beat the sands of time
My body cries with blood
With warmth to be free
A useless uncontrollable act
