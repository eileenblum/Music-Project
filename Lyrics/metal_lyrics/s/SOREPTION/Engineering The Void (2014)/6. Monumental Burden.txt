I have always been right here.
Juggling the knives of hypocrisy
For each wound gathered, another vision shattered
Bathing in worldwide blasphemy
Entrench my thoughts, breathe me
A ritual for the heart, captivate me
Flail me with your words, build me U
and push me through the foundation of memory
Claw through the surface
Are you a follower or a servant?
A contract in blood
Are you the passive incarnate?
Teeth against stone, grinding, grinding
Digging through the soil, to bind me, bind me
The betrayal of a thousand, so weakening, weakening
The cry of millions. strengthen me
Reassembling the continental colossus
Forget the avatar of nations
Bury a new seed with burning efficiency
Mold your mind with singularity
Break free from the hive, with a focused smile
The grin in the earth opens
Black powder foams burst
From the imaginary to reality
In a second of doubt, you deserve it
Claw through the surface
Are you a follower or a servant?
A contract in blood
Are you the passive incarnate?
Teeth against stone, grinding, grinding
Digging through the soil, to bind me, bind me
The betrayal of a thousand, so weakening, weakening
The cry of millions. strengthen me
Teeth against stone, grinding, grinding
Digging through the soil, to bind me, bind me
The betrayal of a thousand, so weakening, weakening
The cry of millions. strengthen me
When the time was lost, you hold my back.
Whisper the words of the sleepers pact.
Awake, awake, I'll set you free.
Seethe in the churning reality.
Teeth against stone, grinding, grinding
Digging through the soil, to bind me, bind me
The betrayal of a thousand, so weakening, weakening
The cry of millions. strengthen me
Teeth against stone, grinding, grinding
Digging through the soil, to bind me, bind me
The betrayal of a thousand, so weakening, weakening
The cry of millions. strengthen me
