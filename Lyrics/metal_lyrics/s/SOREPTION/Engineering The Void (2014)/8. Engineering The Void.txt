To fight the fear, the fear to live.
Strangest is the one enclosed within
Perfectly faded from the grip of reality
Never trust a man with golden grin, he said
Never put yourself in the direction of the end times
Somewhere between
The matter and the void
You will find me
Enlightened and cold
Restrain yourself in twisted skin
The breath of survival is ever changing
Entrench yourself in moral fear
and wait for the glutton to reawaken
Somewhere between
The matter and the void
You will find me
Enlightened and cold
Somewhere between
The matter and the void
You will find me
Enlightened and cold
Hoarding the cries, never more
A poor man remission
Struck by lust
with a fanatics precision
So cold
Blackest of dreams, before the end
Running along with the deceitful night
We are the ones that, forcefully
chooses the path of righteous lunacy
Whether or not the end is upon us
Right beside the liar's tongue and demigods
The restless sphere of uncertainty
collides with rage, in utter turmoil
To fight the fear, the fear to live
Engineering the void
