Finding peace in this poisonous horde.
Another catch twenty-two.
A sadist's utopia.
Bleeding for more.
Resist the maelstrom.
Follow, obey, behave, repeat.
Pierce the hive.
Reawaken.
Resist the maelstrom.
Follow, obey, behave, repeat.
Pierce the hive.
Level with me.
A life never changing, monotonous,
you'll never be one of us.
Submerge beneath the virus,
join the never changing locust.
A life never changing, monotonous,
you'll never be one of us.
Submerge beneath the virus,
join the never changing locust.
Vile perception persists.
The destruction exists, yet lost in time.
Level with the structures
and I'll show you power infinite.
Resist the maelstrom.
Follow, obey, behave, repeat.
Pierce the hive.
Reawaken.
Resist the maelstrom.
Follow, obey, behave, repeat.
Pierce the hive.
Level with me.
A life never changing, monotonous,
you'll never be one of us.
Submerge beneath the virus,
join the never changing locust.
A life never changing, monotonous,
you'll never be one of us.
Submerge beneath the virus,
Join the locust.
The voices are set in motion
A dance in the eye of the storm
The perception is changing
a perpetual fiendish aura
Close your eyes, inhale
A mental enslavement for focus
Denial, for what once were
give me power infinite
When the masses demand simplicity
I'll tell you this you the explicitly
A life never changing, monotonous
You'll never be one of us
Go join the locust
