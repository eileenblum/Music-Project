I would tear you apart for the things you've done.
A few seconds from blackening white.
A bittersweet taste, a breath to reject.
A fit of rage vapors in regret.
We are, equally flawed equally sane.
I am you.
We are, equally flawed equally sane.
We seethe.
We are, equally flawed equally sane.
I am you.
We are, equally flawed equally sane.
W seethe.
The inherited duality.
That is all that is left for me.
Put me in a places besides demigods
or put me in your narrated reality.
We are, equally flawed equally sane.
I am you.
We are, equally flawed equally sane.
We seethe.
We are, equally flawed equally sane.
I am you.
We are, equally flawed equally sane.
We seethe.
Beneath the tremors, a moment of peace.
Twitching, distorting the rules of deceit.
Buried alive in shallow mind.
Digging deeper to reset time.
To escape I blame you.
Breaking apart from the web that surrounds you.
As an opposite I remain.
Finding peace in regret of your presence.
I would tear you apart for the things you've done.
A few seconds from blackening white.
A bittersweet taste, a breath to reject.
A fit of rage vapors in regret.
