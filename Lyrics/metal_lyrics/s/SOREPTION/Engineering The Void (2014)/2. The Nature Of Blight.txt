Just as treacherous, as deceitful as the man made veil
Always bothered reinstating the lines of lunacy
My words will always be inferior to you
In a man-made decaying continuum
I am the disease
Embodied
Moving ever closer to you
I am the disease
A perpetual hide and seek your every step is a choice to live
Strengthen your nerves, steady your flickering eye
And resist what was never meant to be
Among the putrid your are better off without company
I am the disease
Embodied
Moving ever closer to you
I am the disease
Concentrate and visualize what's inside the abyss
Lingering, breeding, multiplying, multiplying
Inhale to overcome, become, materialize, realize
There's no difference between the dead and the buried
Just as treacherous, as deceitful as the man made veil
Always bothered reinstating the lines of lunacy
My words will always be inferior to you
In a man-made decaying continuum
We are the disease
Embodied
Moving ever closer to you
You are the disease
Over time you will suppress me
A carnival for the diseased
Over time you will suppress me
In time you will see what leads to this
