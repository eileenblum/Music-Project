Don't say a word and submit to me
Your wronging's will never make it right
Keep them eyes shut and bleach your will
Resist the taste of carnage that you've built

An action in regret
Your despicable presence enrages me
You'll never forget

My unrighteous actions troubles me
I told you to never cross me

Don't say a word just breathe with me
Time took a lapse, unwillingly, finding me

Pushing out from your inner workings
Tainted by your lack of cries
The wound from my brand will last for a while

An action in regret
Your despicable presence enrages me
You'll never forget

My unrighteous actions troubles me
I told you to never cross me

Neglect, like a behemoth of mourning
Churning present time with the company of ages
Shape whatever pleases you
Turn it into laughter

Blood runs black with feeble lies
I'll never again take part in
A transparent suggestion

Soothing minds of the unknowing
Shape whatever pleases you
Turn it into laughter

Blood runs black with feeble lies
I'll never again take part in

[Solo]

Don't say a word and submit to me
Your present breaks where your reality lingers
When your foundation cracks and your mind is free
I'm not done, you haven't seen the last of me

Breaking the great narcissist
Stable mind for the empty shell
The shape of monumental emptiness
Fed with treason

Tremors (Ripples through the past)
Tremors (Reminds me of you)

[Solo]

Breaking the cycle (Replacing the jester) [12x]
