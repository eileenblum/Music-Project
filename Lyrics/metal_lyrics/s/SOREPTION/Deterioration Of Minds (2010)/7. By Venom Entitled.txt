Sever the cord between lust and realityA mental distortion, the worst by farSadistic protection of what you think is rightTo justify silence and fright Coward Corrupter A feeble heart so full of rust, a tainted soul built on self-digustNow behold what you created Between each moment, in every breath I takeA pulse morphing towards bittersweet screamsYes I will turn the tide, yes I will burn the bridges Just to see you chokeI will not falter. Embrace the embers, so close to reliefBearing the burden just to see you get burned An act so perfect and yet so vileSever the cords, live in denial Your name, entitled by the venom you spreadBy each scream, your twisted ego swells Silence Sever the cord between lust and realityA mental distortion, the worst by farSadistic protection of what you think is rightTo justify silence and fright Between each moment, in every breath I takeA pulse morphing towards bittersweet screamsYes I will turn the tide, yes I will burn the bridges Just to see you suffer An act so perfect and yet so vileSever the cords, live in denial I have watched your suffering and bled through youNow I am bleeding for two Your name, entitled by the venom you spreadBy each scream, your twisted ego swells
