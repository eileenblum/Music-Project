A feeble mind shrieking to be heard
In a world full of hypocrisy, primate-like stupidity
Crossing borders, learning all
Turning cries to pleading, hateful syndrome dead and gone

When I am all, the righteous only god

The world will shiver, learn their true call

Come here sit with quietly
I'll tell you how my world could be
But words change nothing, actions do
And so I sit here completely mute and lonely

Scorn

A perfect connection between the sane
If one fails, we all fail, unity to dim the pain
Suppression for the outside, the mind is free
Unfortunately I'm the one and all kneel to me

When I am all, the righteous only god

The world will shiver, learn their true call

Come here sit with quietly
I'll tell you how my world could be
But words change nothing, actions do
And so I sit here completely mute and lonely

Bent by the way of life, with me nothing is hard
Temptor of stupidity, your only lord
Bent by the way of life, with me nothing is hard
Temptor of stupidity, your only god

A feeble mind shrieking to be heard
In a world full of hypocrisy, primate-like stupidity
Crossing borders, learning all
Turning cries to pleading, hateful syndrome dead and gone

When I am all, the righteous only god

The world will shiver, learn their true call

Come here sit with quietly
I'll tell you how my world could be
But words change nothing, actions do
And so I sit here completely mute and lonely
