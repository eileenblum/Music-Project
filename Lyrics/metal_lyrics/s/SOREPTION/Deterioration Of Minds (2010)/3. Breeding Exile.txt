One last goodbyeThe final closure, the searing regret of countless wrongingsAn inner siege against the fears of pain, rages on, over and over againFor all that I built, for all that lost. Forever gone and forever forsaken The fear of lies, the fear of abandonmentCloses around me like a putrid diseaseAll the aggression melts with cries in vain Cutting inches, tearing skin from boneGrinding teeth to dim this mental feast Peeling skin to feel the dying pulse of a bleeding heartSeverPeeling skin to feel the dying pulse of a bleeding heartForever Dying perfect yet obsolete But on the other hand, I never got it Caught a glimpse of the seeds soaked in rainClinging together, longing to feel the painFor all that starts has an end you seeFor better or worse, I wanna hear you plead The fear of lies, the fear of abandonmentCloses around me like a putrid diseaseAll the aggression melts with cries in vain Cutting inches, tearing skin from boneGrinding teeth to dim this mentalThe fear of lies, the fear of abandonmentCloses around me like a putrid diseaseAll the aggression melts with cries in vain A torment so perfect, nearly divine An existence so feeble, and my god, it breedsClinging on top of the foundation of deceitAn existence so feeble, and my god, it breedsClinging on top of the foundation of deceit Cherish the pain and grant me new lifePunish me for every day I've lived as one of the deadCherish the pain and grant me new lifeBrand me, let everybody see what you've made of me
