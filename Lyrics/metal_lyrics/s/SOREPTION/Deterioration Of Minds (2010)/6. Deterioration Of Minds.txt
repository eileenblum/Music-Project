As it became peacefully colder
All that was will never be
The warmth of the welcoming black
All that was will never be

I don't wanna be a part of this
Obnoxious decay
Begging for pain to heal the words

Of my acts, so repulsive and vile
So repulsive and vile

Unclean, begin to rust for the final state of man
Rewind, rewind, rewind
So unclean, begin to rust for the 
Final final final final age

Time is killing us slower and slower
Deterioration of minds gets wider and wider
Time is killing us slower and slower
Deterioration of minds gets wider and wider

No more fuel for my mental disorder
Find me something new before I tear this
Miserable skin to pieces, a feast for me

In human harmony

A new sickness, a new madness
Too much for me to gnaw on
For all I know we're dying slow

Without even a thought about tomorrow

In this weakened state
Choosing eternal sleep
In this weakened moment
In realization

It becomes clear to me
All that was will never be
It becomes clear to me
All that was will never be

I don't wanna be a part of this
Obnoxious decay
Begging for pain to heal the words

Of my acts, so repulsive and vile
So repulsive and vile

Time is killing us slower and slower
Deterioration of minds gets wider and wider
Time is killing us slower and slower
Deterioration of minds gets wider and wider
