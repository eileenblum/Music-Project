Straight into the pathetic breach
Every breath one take grows into pulsing rage

Moving away to get closer to you
Aeons away yet within reach

Praying for peace, caressing the sane
"What ever did I do to deserve this aching!"

I'm sorry for this, still moving on
The hypocrite coward preserving duality

(What's left for me?)
Profound visions of self pity, what I see, what I feel, you never get it
See through my eyes and live my anxiety, burning, searing inside of me

Crack that shell around you
Show your bloated pale existence with demeaning precision

Rip that precious skin
Layer and layer to get closer to the filth within
With all the lies aside
Counting tears with burning pride
Now I finally found you

Laying on a solid foundation of nothing

Profound visions of self pity, what I see, what I feel, you never get it
See through my eyes and live my anxiety, burning, searing inside of me
Profound visions of self pity, what I see, what I feel, you never get it
See through my eyes and live my anxiety, burning, searing inside of me

Straight into the pathetic breach
Every breath one take grows into pulsing rage

Moving away to get closer to you
Aeons away yet within reach

Praying for peace, caressing the sane
"What ever did I do to deserve this aching!"

I'm sorry for this, still moving on
The hypocrite coward preserving duality
