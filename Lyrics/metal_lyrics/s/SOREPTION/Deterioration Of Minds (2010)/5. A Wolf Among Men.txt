Shove me aside, beating hard, lust perfect in timeShove me aside, breathing silently, lust, skin turn hard The rush, the taste, the moans in painThis act was never in vainThe lust, the warmth, the bleeding woundsA kiss, tainted and tamed The great grey angst, total emptyness, the sickening need for fleshUse me to whatever you may find suitable for the longing sane The rush, the taste, the moans in painThis act was never in vainThe lust, the warmth, the bleeding woundsA kiss, tainted and tamed I beg you for mercy and to think of this actAs a simple solution for my mental sweatThe gnawing thoughts, the twitching limbsAll bearable for a touch of rust within The last smell of livid flesh disappearsThe kiss from the grave that no one hearsThe game was forfeit she can see it clearHer soul, her warmth no longer here The last smell of livid flesh disappearsThe kiss from the grave that no one hearsThe game was forfeit I can see it clearMy soul, my warmth no longer here The great grey angst, total emptyness, the sickening need for fleshUse me to whatever you may find suitable for the longing sane The rush, the taste, the moans in painThis act was never in vainThe lust, the warmth, the bleeding woundsA kiss, tainted and tamed Perfecting the borders, I'm a dying breedDamn it, I was not alone in thisPerfecting the borders, I'm a dying breedDamn it, I was not alone in this
