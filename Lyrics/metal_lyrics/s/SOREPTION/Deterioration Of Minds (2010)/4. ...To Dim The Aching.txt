Destruction of my weak will
A new autumn to die

Forget your god, my friend
No place for holyness here

It's the dance of the fireflies
Two lives intertwine

For weeks to come

And months to follow
I'll be dead and gone, down and hollow

Feeding the past
It is her, I will follow
Straight down to her grave

A gallery of the insane

It's the dance of the fireflies
Two lives intertwine

A partial collapse in denial
Raping the burden from the constant fear
Twisting, turning time to dim the aching for a while

Rip me open for one final silent tear

Destruction of my weak will
A new autumn to die

Forget your god my friend
No place for holyness here
