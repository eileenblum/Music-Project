Selfishly searching my little piece of mind
Endlessly preaching ignoring the danger signs

I can see through your lies you're not fooling me
Listen now a word from the wise

Dying - Illusions of our dreams
Lying - Confusion of the seeds of evil

Lacking self-protection instinct
In to the flames you go
Your actions so distinctive your fears will show

I can see through your lies you're not fooling me
Listen now a word from the wise

Dying - Illusions of our dreams
Lying - Confusion of the seeds of evil
Dying - The truth and our beliefs
Lying - Unbelievers turn the world to chaos

I can see through your lies you're not fooling me
Listen now a word from the wise

Dying - Illusions of our dreams
Lying - Confusion of the seeds of evil
Dying - The truth and our beliefs
