Face to face with a world
Unsung heroes standing tall
Lost in a maze until they learn
They wait for a miracle

Break the curse of the seven seals
Give the people what they want
Numbness they only feel
No escape from this old routine

Rise or fall in this masquerade ball
I'm standing at the edge of dawn

Judah the lion's my name - unveiling the secrecy
Judah the lion's my name - the keeper of seven seals

Legions of the damned
They are marching side by side
The slaughter takes the lambs
Still they wait for a miracle

Riders from the sky
Endless source of all evil
No rules apply
Is this the war to end all wars

Rise or fall in this masquerade ball
I'm standing at the edge of dawn

Judah the lion's my name - unveiling the secrecy
Judah the lion's my name - the keeper of seven seals

Judah the lion's my name - Rise or fall in this masquerade ball
Judah the lion's my name - I'm standing at the edge of dawn
Judah the lion's my name - Face to face with a world
Judah the lion's my name - The keeper, the keeper of the seven seals...
