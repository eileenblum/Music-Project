Now you're spending your darkest hour
Light a candle of sorrow and shame
Gaze to the light you'll see blackened tower
There's no destiny no fortune no fame

Healer
Purify my soul
Believers
Send a message to all those forgotten souls

Now S.O.S is real
The lime has come to heal my soul
Now S.O.S is real
It's judgement day and the secrets unfold

I came to the dark begging for mercy
My bleeding wounds endlessly burn
My scars will prove my past is real
In weakness I thought that I've learned

Healer
Purify my soul
Believers
Send a message to all those forgotten souls

Now S.O.S is real
The time has come to heal my soul
Now S.O.S is real
It's judgement day and the secrets unfold

Gaze to the light and you'll see
There is no destiny no fortune and no fame

Healer
Purify my soul
Believers
Send a message to all those forgotten souls

Now S.O.S is real
The time has come to heal my soul
Now S.O.S is real
It's judgement day and the secrets unfold
