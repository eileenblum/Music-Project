I'm laying a puzzle on my mind
I can feel a revolution of ecstasy
Could it be my destiny

Is there someone who can help me out
I can't see the path yet it's in front of me
I cry out in agony

I'm a puppet on a string
Why don't you let me out
Just a puppet on a string
Like a newborn I race for my life

Imagination starts running wild
Pain inside is rising I am the fallen one
Last chance to hold the gun

Oh I wish there could be another way
Silent cries out but I fall to rise again
Wounds of life they still remain

I'm a puppet on a string
Why don't you set me free
Just a puppet on a string
Like a newborn I race for my life

I'm a puppet on a string
Why don't you let me out
Just a puppet on a string
Why don't you set me free

I'm a puppet on a string
Why don't you let me out
Just a puppet on a string
Like a newborn I race for my life
