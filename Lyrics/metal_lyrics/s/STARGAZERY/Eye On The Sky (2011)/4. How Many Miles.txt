Can you share this moment with me
Would you feel shame if I'm not I suppose to be
I will leave my past you all
Now I hear the piper's call...

Sometimes brick by brick I build my house of fear
Somehow I manage and dry these tears
Do I care what it costs
When I hear the piper's call

How many miles until I reach the Avalon
Is this the way I walked before
How many miles until I reach the Avalon
I'm not a stranger at all

Bright blue ocean reflects my inner peace
With very honest eyes I feel no fear
Do I care what it costs?
Now I hear the pipers call
How many miles until I reach the Avalon
Is this the way I walked before
How many miles until I reach the Avalon
I'm not a stranger at all

Still I'm burning still I'm moving
And wondering how long this way could be
Tables turning, I'm still learning
Mystified by fire yet my pain is real
I will leave my past you all now I hear the piper's call

Oh no is this the way I walked before
No no no no...
How many miles until I reach the Avalon
Is this the way I walked before
How many miles until I reach the Avalon
I'm not a stranger at all
