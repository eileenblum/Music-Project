Falling down like a house of cards
Position dangered this has gone too far
Malicious bullets fly
Across the darkened skies

Say no more
Count me out
I've had enough

You can't fly you've got no wings
You're the Jester of Kings
Rattle the chains and amuse the crowd
The court is closed I pull the strings
You're the Jester of Kings
Joy fills the crowd when you're gone

Falling joker you're out of luck
Deeds undone the judgement is tough
Evil intrigues shine
Across the darkened skies

Say no more
Count me out
I've had enough

You can't fly you've got no wings
You're the Jester of Kings
Rattle the chains and amuse the crowd
The court is closed I pull the strings
You're the Jester of Kings
Joy fills the crowd when you're gone

You're the fool
Yes you fool
How can you do this to me
You driving me to insanity...

You can't fly you've got no wings
You're the Jester of Kings
Rattle the chains and amuse the crowd
The court is closed I pull the strings
You're the Jester of Kings
Joy fills the crowd when you're gone
