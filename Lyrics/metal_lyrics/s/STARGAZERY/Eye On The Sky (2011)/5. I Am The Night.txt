Everybody's searching everybody's lying don't blame on me
It's all what I feel
Don't take it for granted
My life has been mistreated but I just want you

Now my soul is sealed
One thing in life that's guaranteed

Until I die - I'm the night without you
I am the night - I can't hold on my heart
Until I die - I'm the night in your deepest life
And I can't take your breath anymore

Stealer in the lowlife
Rival of the spotlight
That's what I am I'm doing what I can
Nothing's really over until we really screw it
Who's fooling who

Now my soul is sealed
One thing in life that's guaranteed

Until I die - I'm the night without you
I am the night - I can't hold on my heart
Until I die - I'm the night in your deepest life
And I can't take your breath anymore

Until I die - I'm the night without you
I am the night - I can't hold on my heart
Until I die - I'm the night in your deepest life
And I can't take your breath anymore

I am the night!
