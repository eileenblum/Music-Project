Sound of thunder and blinding lights
Woke me up in the middle of the night
And my heart is crying out loud

Thinking about which road to choose
And will I win or will I lose
My healer I need you now

Time has the answers but my patience's wearing thin
Am I asking right questions in this world of sin

Everytime I dream of you - It tears me apart
Everytime I dream of you - Too long I waited...
it has gone too far

Remember the times by the sea
Remember the times in between
My healer I need you now

I have heard you have a better life
Forget me not 'cause in my mind
You're the healer that brought me back to life

Time has the answers but my patience's wearing thin
Am I asking wrong questions in this world of sin

Everytime I dream of you - It tears me apart
Everytime I dream of you - Too long I waited...
it has gone too far

Future or the past - I waited too long
First or the last - Calling me so strong
Give up or fight - Balancing on the ledge
Hold on let go - Push me over the edge...and I'll be yours

Everytime I dream of you - It tears me apart
Everytime I dream of you - Too long I waited
Everytime I dream of you - No no no...
Everytime I dream of you - Too long I waited
Everytime I dream of you baby....
