Push the limits and the boundaries will fall
Take the step, stand proud &amp; tall

Never too late try
Just be who you are
Open your mind's eye
And follow your star...

Break away
Let the system take the blame
Keep your eye on the sky

Tame the land
unleash the nature within
No prisoners
Leave your bodies in sin

Never too late try
Just be who you are
Open your mind's eye
And follow your star...

Break away
Let the system take the blame
Keep your eye on the sky

Never too late try
Just be who you are
Open your mind's eye
And follow your star...

Break away
Let the system take the blame
Keep your eye on the sky
