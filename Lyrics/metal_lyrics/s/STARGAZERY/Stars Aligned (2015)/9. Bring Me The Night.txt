I don't live by the rules, the rules of reason
My heart will always tell me which path to choose

You can laugh
You can call me what you want
But I won't change my mind

Bring me the night
Hide my pain and protect me
Bring me the night
The light will hurt me
Cover me, shelter me

I've been hurt so many times, heard so many lies
But I still believe in love at first sight

You can laugh
You can call me what you want
But I won't change my mind

Bring me the night
Hide my pain and protect me
Bring me the night
The light will hurt me
Cover me, shelter me
