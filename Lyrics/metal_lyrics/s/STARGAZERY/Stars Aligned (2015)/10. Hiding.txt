Whenever I need you
You hide your face in the sand
And pretend you're not there

Making promises you're not going to keep
You're indifferent, you don't care

You don't know how much I've sacrificed
Burned in the fires of hell and left out in the cold

Everytime you're hiding
It's a crime and you do it again
Living a lie, you're hiding
No matter what I say, no matter what I do
You keep hiding

Tension is growing, I've had enough of your lies
Just get out of my life

I see all around me those judgmental eyes
But still I reach for the skies

You don't know how much I've sacrificed
Burned in the fires of hell and left out in the cold

Everytime you're hiding
It's a crime and you do it again
Living a lie, you're hiding
No matter what I say, no matter what I do
You keep hiding
