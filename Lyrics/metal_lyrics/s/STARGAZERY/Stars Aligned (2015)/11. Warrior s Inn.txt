Yet to come another bloody round
It's a real thing, ain't gonna loose
Something more I have to do
Like it or not, I'm a killing machine

Preachers can't help you
Your king will be dead
Don't get me wrong, my job is your head

This is what we do, one of us must fall
If killing is for fools, I'd rather die before dawn

And the Gods drink their wine, when they watch the soldiers die
We will meet, you and I, in the Warrior's Inn

My spirit flies high, blood burns my veins
Sword is my friend in this eternal chase
My name is terror, I'm chosen to kill
Yet feelin' lonely in this battlefield

This is what we do, one of us must fall
If killing is for fools, I'd rather die before dawn

And the Gods drink their wine, when they watch the soldiers die
We will meet, you and I, in the Warrior's Inn
