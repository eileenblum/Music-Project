Narrow-minded king of the crowd
We bow down to your feet

Tell us your stories, shout them out loud
Preach us 'till we bleed

Stretching the corners of your little world
Seems like undoable task

Bathing in the light of your self-indulgence
I just wanna rip off your mask

It's blinding my eyes
Dim the halo (blinding my eyes)
It lights up the sky
Dim the halo (lights up the sky)

Out of the blackness of your soul
Rises the veil of deceit
Spread across the universe
I just want to break free

It's blinding my eyes
Dim the halo (blinding my eyes)
It lights up the sky
Dim the halo (lights up the sky)
