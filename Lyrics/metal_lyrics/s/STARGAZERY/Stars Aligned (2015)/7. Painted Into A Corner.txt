I'm down, down in the dirt
It seems that the fool never learns

Time after time it's all the same
Day after day just the names will change

Painted into a corner
Set me free, free from this eternal dark
Painted into a corner
I wanna live, live and not fall apart

Like a bullet, bullet from a gun
My soul, restless soul, is on the run

Running wild in the arms of the night
Love and affection as my guiding lights

Painted into a corner
Set me free, free from this eternal dark
Painted into a corner
I wanna live, live and not fall apart
