Two ships in the night frozen in time
So unaware
On a collision course with a powerful force
Lead us into temptation

Pleasure and pain
Heaven and hell
Merging together as one

I cast a spell on you
Voodoo
I put a spell on you
Voodoo
You're under my charm

Wings of desire taking us higher
We're burning
Sharing the lust time turns to dust
Lead us into salvation

Sinners and saints
Fire and ice
Merging together as one

I cast a spell on
Voodoo
I put a spell on you
Voodoo
You're under my charm, I'll do you no harm

Burning up... Rising high...
I he heavens on lire
Giving in to the lust...
We're sharing the hours of desire
