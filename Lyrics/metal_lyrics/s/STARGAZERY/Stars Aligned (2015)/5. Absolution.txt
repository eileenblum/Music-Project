Resistance is futile
I just try to keep my head above the water

Postponed my future
Am I on the path that leads to the slaughter

Convicting myself
Tribulations in the fire
But until the end
My flame burns higher

God of fire and flames
Burn my sin, 'till the morning light
King of sun and the moon
Give me Absolution

Scaffolds of my life
Just can't take this weight of the world

Building a shrine
To the ones who answers all these voices unheard

Convicting myself
Tribulations in the fire
But until the end
My flame burn, higher

God of fire and flames
Burn my sin, 'till the morning light
King of sun and the moon
Give me Absolution

Queen of wind and the rain
Wash my sins until the morning light
Lady of fortune and fame
Give me Absolution

Learning, I am learning as I walk through the fire
Returning, I'm returning to crush all the liars
