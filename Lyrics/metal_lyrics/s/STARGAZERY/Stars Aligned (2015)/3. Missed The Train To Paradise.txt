Sorrow will burn my soul to the ground
(But) I still try to fight it
Glimmers of hope nowhere to be found
(But) I still try to reach it

Take me away to the place I feel safe again

I'm half dead and half alive
Lurking in the alleys of this lost and misplaced life
I missed the train to paradise
Left at the altar by this dark and vicious bride

Sentenced to lose everything I had
Regardless the wishes
Doing time in this prison so sad
Freedom is priceless

Take me away to the place I feel safe again

I'm half dead and half alive
Lurking in the alleys of this lost and misplaced life
I missed the train to paradise
Left at the altar by this dark and vicious bride

Convict me
Evict me from this life I've been living
I'm not the same anymore
