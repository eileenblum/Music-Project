After dark, my little friend, it's not easy to find a way
That leads you hack home again
No matter what the people say
It's better to live your life than just to fade away

You have cried so many times
And you've been told
Live and let die

She's an Angel of the Dawn
She is Starlight, She is the Bringer of Love
She's an Angel of the Dawn
And all The Stargazers are singing their song

Livin' now, livin' fast, thou the shadows of the past
Try to catch your soul
Lovers' home, infinity, gives the reason to hold a dream
And sail your ship home

You've been treated had too many times
Finally you have precious love to hide

She's an Angel of the Dawn
She is Starlight, She is the Bringer of Love
She's an Angel of the Dawn
And all The Stargazers are singing their song

See a star failing from the sky
Without your love it will fade away
Don't ever turn away
Eternal prey and she's forever yours
