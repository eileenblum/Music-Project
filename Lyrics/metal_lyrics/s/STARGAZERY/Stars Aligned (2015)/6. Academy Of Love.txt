Strange signs comin' in my feelings
Is it something I've never felt before

Is it the Grail for the Dreamer
Like water for the dying roses

The Castle of Loneliness breaks down
No hero needed

Academy Of Love
Wearing my soul with your love
Academy Of Love
Season of the dark fades away

I wish I could remember
The very first moment when we met
I couldn't resist the heaven
Though it's only the Hell to me

If somebody shows me how to love
Heavy heart will understand

Academy Of Love
Wearing my soul with your love
Academy Of Love
Season of the dark fades away
