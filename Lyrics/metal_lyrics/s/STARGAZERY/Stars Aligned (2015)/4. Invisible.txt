Victims of circumstances
Unable to choose
Born without any chances
Always bound to loose

Obey! This is the price you pay
This is the life you're forced to live

Stolen from the world of innocence
Frozen in time
No hope, the lack of confidence
Perfect victims of crime

They are the children, the children of the night
They're ghosts, they are invisible
They are the legions, the legions in the dark
They are ghosts, they are Invisible
