Little spider what will you do...
When no ones there for you......
My little spider I'm here for you
When no one cares about you....

I hear my spiders crawling
Dying beneath me
I hear my spiders crawling
Please God help me
Little spider...Please don't leave me
Little spider...Please don't leave me

Please don't hurt my little spider
I cannot live without her
Please don't keep my little spider
In her web...Deep inside you
Little spider
Little spider

I hear you crying but I can't find you
So please crawl out so I can see you
I know your dying but I can't find you
So please crawl out so I can save you

I hear my spiders crawling
Dying beneath me
I hear my spiders crawling
Please God help me
Little spider...Please don't leave me
Little spider...Please don't leave me
