Hate!   Go!

Haunted by hatred {Haunted by hatred}
Hating ever
I will I will get you
I will I will bury you

So I put you in your place
Down down
Beneath the living

Down down
Beneath the living

Hate!   Go!

Haunted by hatred
Never again
Nothing ever
I will I will hate you
I will I will bury you

So I put you in your place
Down down
Beneath the living

Down down
Beneath the living

Never again...nothing ever
