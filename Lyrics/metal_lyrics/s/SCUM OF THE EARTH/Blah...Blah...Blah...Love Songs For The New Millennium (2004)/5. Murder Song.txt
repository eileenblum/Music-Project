The God, The gun
The vasoline
You dirty pig I'm cuming inside you
The pain, The fear
The flash, The scream
You dirty whores I'll murder all of you

I monster living sin
I hate myself the way it slips in
Taste the black it's on my lips
So I can cum again again

Little death will run inside you
Little death will run inside you
Little death will run inside you
Little death will murder all of you...

Murders murders murders murder suicide
It will surely find you

Murders murders murders murder all of you

I devil done with you
I want the breath you hold inside you
Lust for trashy filthy whores
My love for sin the need for more

The God, The gun
The vasoline
You dirty pig I'm cuming inside you
The pain, The fear
The flash, The scream
You dirty whores I'll murder all of you

Murders murders murders murder suicide
It will surely find you

Murders murders murders murder all of you

Murder suicide, Murder suicide
Every single one of us the devils inside
Murder suicide, Murder suicide
Every single one of us are going to die

Murders murders murders murder all of you
