Say you love me, say you need me

Love is control
Fuck you can't let go
Love is control
Fuck you cause I said so
Hurt you gently and degrade you
You're the slave and don't forget it
Say you love me...Let your hell begin

The - devil - made me do it...

C'mon c'mon - the devil made me do it

How come
Every day I live
I want to die
Everything I love
I want to kill
Everyday I mix my
Hate with pills
Drown in alcohol

Yeah c'mon c'mon - the devil made me do it

Love is control
Fuck you, you can't let go
Love is control
Fuck you cause I said so
Hate is hurting and is growing
You're the victim I'm controlling
Say you love me...Let my hell begin

The - devil - made me do it...

C'mon c'mon - the devil made me do it

The - devil - made me do it...
