Bloodsuckinfreakshow

Yeah I hear those devil voices
I don't mind I'm in hell anyway
Yeah with the devil I'll be dancin'
With no god I don't even care

Ooh the devil wants me
Devil wants me
Ooh the devil wants me
Dance in the bloodsuckinfreakshow with me

I see the devils...
I see the devils...
I see the devils...
Bloodsuckinfreakshow

Well she's a bloodsuckinfreak
Dead and bloated cold and grey
Well she gets her dead on
700 miles away

Ooh the devil wants me
Devil wants me
Ooh the devil wants me
Dance in the bloodsuckinfreakshow with me
