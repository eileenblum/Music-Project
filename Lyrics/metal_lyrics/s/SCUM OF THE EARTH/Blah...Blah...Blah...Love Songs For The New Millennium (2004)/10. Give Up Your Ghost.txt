Give up your ghost don't be afraid
Little pain will go away
Give up your ghost don't be ashamed
Bite the barrel, pull the trigger

Goodbye to this cruel world, of mine
Hello to the better times

Give up your ghost don't be afraid
Little pain will go away
Give up your ghost don't be ashamed
Bite the barrel, pull the trigger

Don't claim the mess I left behind
Let the maggots choke on my mind
Don't look at me my son
Don't cry I'm finally happy...Dead

Goodbye to this cruel world of mine
Hello to the bullet in my mind

Give up your ghost don't be afraid
Little pain will go away
Give up your ghost don't be ashamed
Bite the barrel, pull the trigger

Don't scrape me from the floor oh Lord no
Let the maggots choke on my eyes
Don't take me to the other side oh Lord no
Let my soul die

Don't claim the mess I left behind
Let the maggots choke on my mind
Don't look at me my son
Don't cry I'm finally happy...Dead
