I am a righteous man, pain on my lips and flowers in my hand
Angel's breath can die and choke out any day
Bite your flesh, leave scars all over
Till my teeth are broken, tear your face wide open

The devil made me do it
Every day I want to fuckin' die
I mix my hate with alcohol now
Everything that I love I want to kill

The devil made me do it
Every day I want to fuckin' die
I mix my hate with alcohol now
Everything that I love I want to kill

The devil made me do it
The devil made me do it

I am the nothing's end, only empty, sick inside
Trigger trip or trick, tearing flesh, cutting in rough lines
Hate your face, your pain's not over
Till my hands are swollen and my fists are broken

The devil made me do it
Every day I want to fuckin' die
I mix my hate with alcohol now
Everything that I love I want to kill

The devil made me do it
Every day I want to fuckin' die
I mix my hate with alcohol now
Everything that I love I want to kill

The devil made me do it
The devil made me do it
The devil made me do it
The devil made me do it
The devil made me do it
