I see angels, faces cold and grey
Gods the enemy, hammering the nail
(Hell and lower)

Macabro expectaculo
Macabro expectaculo

Hate is all that's left of me
Hate is all I'm offering
Hell, hell
Hell, hell

Hate is all that's left of me
Hate is all I'm offering
Hell, hell, macabro
Hell, hell, expectaculo

Drive in the nail, feed my flesh to bone
Burn in my sin, feed my dirty soul
(Hell and lower)

Macabro expectaculo
Macabro expectaculo

(Hate) is all that's left of me
(Hate) is all I'm offering
Hell, hell
Hell, hell

(Hate) is all that's left of me
(Hate) is all I'm offering
Hell, hell, macabro
Hell, hell, expectaculo

(Hate) is all that's left of me
(Hate) is all I'm offering
Hate!
