Every single inch of me scream decisive hate
Bloody image of you, horror haunts my eyes
Bloodlust, victim is your name
Drop dead, turn me on again

Pleasure, pain, lust and suffering, god of pain, scream for me blasphemy
Victimized, body altering, lust and suffering
Deform the blade, victim 13, god of pain, scream for me agony
Terrorize, face up, sodomy, lust and suffering

I am the face of murder now
Blood in the place of the murdered now
I am the face of murder now
Buried and mine, I am monster now

Needles play your veins like the strings broken cherubs harp
Angels screaming in delight, faces inside out
Bloodlust, victim is your name
Drop dead, turn me on again

Deform the blade, victim 13, god of pain, scream for me agony
Terrorize, face up, sodomy, lust and suffering
Pleasure, pain, lust and suffering, god of death, scream for me blasphemy
Victimized body altering, lust and suffering

I am the face of murder now
Blood in the place of the murdered now
I am the face of murder now
Buried and mine, I am monster now

I am monster
I am monster

I am the face of murder now
Blood in the place of the murdered now
I am the face of murder now
Buried and mine, I am monster

I am the face of murder now
I am monster, I am monster
I am the face of murder now
I am monster, I am monster now
