As you lay beside me and stare into my eyes
I wonder if you're hollow behind that smile
Just like me
Just like me

As you lay here beside me in pieces, do you think I'm crazy?
If I put you back together, will you be who you were?
Just like me
Just like me, yeah

As I lay beside you and lie to get a smile
I always knew you were the devil in disguise
Just like me
Just like me

And I like her quiet like this and I wonder does she still love me?
If I put her back together, how do I make her crazy?
Just like me
Just like me
Just like me

As you lay here beside me in pieces, do you think I'm crazy?
If I put you back together, will you be who you were?
Just like me, ha-ha-ha-ha!

And I like her quiet like this and I wonder does she still love me?
If I put her back together, how do I make her uncrazy?
Just like me
Just like me, yeah
