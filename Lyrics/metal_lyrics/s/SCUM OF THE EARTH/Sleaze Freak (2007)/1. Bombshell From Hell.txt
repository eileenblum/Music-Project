Bombshell from hell
Devil woman slut, strut your lust
God sold his soul, put the devil on the cross
Blood of the whore, dead man's desire
Skin turns red and eyes to fire
Well, feed me lies, lap dance me dead
Tie me up and do it again
Tattooed thighs, no breath inside her
Spit my soul into the fire
Bombshell from hell, godless Jezebel
Bombshell from hell, got no soul to sell
Bombshell from hell, bombshell from hell
Nazi demon, nine lives, snake eyes
Got black leather wings, hustle under red lights
SS death stomp girls for hire
Strip club demon, this girls on fire
Well, beat me like
I'm already dead
Wrap your tail around my neck
Silver tongue pitchfork beside her
Spread your legs become desire
Bombshell from hell, godless Jezebel
Bombshell from hell, got no soul to sell
Bombshell from hell, bombshell from hell
Bombshell, bombshell from hell
Bombshell, bombshell from hell
