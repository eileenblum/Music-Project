Only the lonely hear the sounds of the dead
Only the lonely watch it burn until the end

Sounds of the dead

Welcome to the end of the world my friends
as the ghost trapped inside me comes alive

Only the lonely hear the sounds of the dead
Only the lonely watch it burn until the end

Watch it burn

... And we tip our hats to the living as we exit gracefully out of this freakshow ... And we go violently out ...

Only the lonely hear the sounds of the dead
Only the lonely watch it burn until the end
