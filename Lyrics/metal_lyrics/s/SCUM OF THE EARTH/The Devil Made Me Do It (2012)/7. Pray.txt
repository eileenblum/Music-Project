Stench of sin church of ghosts ,
as I descend I shatter all hope ...
Crucified by the tribe of the holy one
serenaded by the devil in the midnight sun
get down and Pray - Pray - Pray

Terrorize, Victimize, Crucified like Jesus Christ

Dead not a soul post apocalypse ghosts
unborn messiahs in the devils cult
We are the dead that never die
Sunsick and scarred blood lust in our eyes
get down and Pray - Pray - Pray

Terrorize, Victimize, Crucified like Jesus Christ
Get down get get down get down PRAY!
Get get down get crucified like Frankenstein

SATAN - SATAN

Terrorize, Victimize, Crucified like jesus christ
Get down get get down get down PRAY!
Get get down get crucified like Jesus Christ
