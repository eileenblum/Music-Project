Hiding in the me you'll never see
this empty gaze is all you'll reach
I close my eyes and disappear
hiding in the me you'll never see

As I descend I'm born again

As I descend I'm born again
As I descend
Born Again Masochist

Hands are creeping shadows
nails are bit away
Eyes are green and hollow
laughing as I fade away

As I descend I'm born again

As I descend I'm born again
As I descend
Born Again Masochist

Hiding in the part of me, the part of me you'll never see
Hiding in the part of me, the part of me you'll never reach

As I descend I'm born again
As I descend
Born Again Masochist
