When I open my eyes my reflection dies killing the GHOST ...

With nothing left inside too late for suicide I, I don't exist ...
I'm a soulless ghost and I roam this empty shell and I, I don't exist
when I open my eyes and I stare outside it makes me sick and I shut back down
Not even sickness inside no memories survive and I am the ghost

I'm a whisper from the dead
A ghost that never lived and I don't exist

When I open my eyes my reflection dies killing the GHOST

When darkness shines in my eyes until I'm blind I, I don't exist
No reflection remains in the end it's all the same and I, I don't exist
when I open my eyes my reflection dies my sickness subsides I'm less than alive
As I start to descend below the end of sin I am the ghost

I'm a whisper from the dead
A ghost that never lived and I don't exist

When I open my eyes my reflection dies killing the GHOST
