The devil made me do it, do it
Do it, do it
The devil made me do it, do it
Do it, do it
The devil made me do it, do it

The devil is my freak
Caress as fingers creep, do it
The devil is my whip
For your skeleton to grind against

Let's get creepy in the devil's freak show

The devil made me do it, do it
Do it, do it
The devil made me do it, do it
Do it, do it
The devil made me do it, do it

The devil is my fist
Let your skull rub against, do it
The devil is my flesh
Let your sin grind up against, do it

Let's get freaky in the devil's creep show

The devil made me do it, do it
Do it, do it
The devil made me do it, do it
Do it, do it
The devil made me do it, do it

Everybody's bump and grinding in the devil's freak show

Do it

The devil made me do it, do it
Do it, do it
The devil made me do it, do it
