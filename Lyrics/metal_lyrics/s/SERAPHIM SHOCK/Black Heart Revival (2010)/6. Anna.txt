MIDNIGHT LIKE ANIMALS
SOMETHING IN HER KISS FROM LONG AGO
SHE WHISPERS SOFTLY COME TO ME
LONGING IN HER EYES
TAKE ME NOW AND THEN WE'LL SPEAK OF LOVE

RED DRESS ON THE BALCONY SANTIAGO MOON
MY ANGELS SCENT ENVELOPS ME PULLS ME DEEP WITHIN
INVITE THE SCARS SHE'S SURE TO LEAVE THE DEMON LIVES AGAIN
NO CARE FOR WHAT TOMORROW BRINGS
WE ONLY WANTED THIS

SKIN TO SKIN
FACE TO FACE
FOREVER ONE
FOR YOU I WAIT

ANNA
