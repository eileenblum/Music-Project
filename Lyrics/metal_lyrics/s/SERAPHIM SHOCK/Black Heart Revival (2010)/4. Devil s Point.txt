OUT PAST OL LYDEN ROAD
OUT PAST THEM SKIN AND BONES
BLACK SUMMER 89'
SIX DEAD TWO SUICIDES

DON'T TELL YOUR MOMMA NOW THE THINGS YOU SAW TONIGHT
JUST TAKE MY HAND MY LOVE AND KISS YOUR LIGHT GOODBYE

CAUSE GOD AIN'T HERE TONIGHT
AND THAT CHILL CREEPS DOWN YOUR SPINE
SPIT ON US WE SPIT ON YOU
AT DEVILS POINT WE'LL BURY YOU

CAUSE GOD AIN'T HERE TONIGHT
AND I SEE FEAR IN YOUR EYES
SWEET DEATH EMBRACES YOU
DEVILS POINT WE'LL COME FOR YOU

GOT NOTHIN LEFT TO LOSE
GOT NOTHIN BUT PAIN FOR YOU
BATS CHAINS AND RAZOR BLADES
THIS TIME WE'LL MAKE EM PAY
