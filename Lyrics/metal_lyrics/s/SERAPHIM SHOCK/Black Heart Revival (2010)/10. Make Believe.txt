INTO THE BLACK RAIN COLD ABYSS
INTO THE BLACK SEA NO REGRETS
ONE CLICK AWAY FROM SOMETHING NEW TODAY

YOU'LL NEVER KNOW MY TOUCH AGAIN
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
GOODBYE TO ALL YOUR SELF DECEIT

THINGS ARE NEVER WHAT THEY SEEM TO BE
MAKE BELIEVE IT WASN'T REAL

A SMILE CAN'T HIDE AWAY THE PAIN
TODAY THE WORLD STOOD STILL AGAIN
I TAKE IT ALL BACK TAKE IT ALL

SO PUT ME ON YOUR TROPHY SHELF
THE ONE YOU USED FOR SHOW AND TELL
SO I COULD LOSE MYSELF IN YOU

THINGS ARE NEVER WHAT THEY SEEM TO BE
MAKE BELIEVE IT WASN'T REAL
