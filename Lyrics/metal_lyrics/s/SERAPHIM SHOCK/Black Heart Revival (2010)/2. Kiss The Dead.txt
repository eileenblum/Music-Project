WATCHED THOSE TEARS ROLL DOWN HER FACE
COULDN'T FEEL A THING
WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE FOR YOU
ONE LAST LOOK INTO HER EYES
SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND
GHOST IN LOVE WITH YESTERDAY
BUT YESTERDAY IS GONE

SO I KISS THE DEAD TONIGHT
HOLD MY COLD BLUE VALENTINE

UP THE OLD FAMILIAR STAIRS
HER PERFECT LETTER SAID
BURY ME IN SOMETHING ELEGANT
THERE SHE HANGS IN SUMMER BREEZE
FOREVER WE WILL BE
FROZEN THERE
SILENCE BURNS FOREVER BURNS INSIDE
