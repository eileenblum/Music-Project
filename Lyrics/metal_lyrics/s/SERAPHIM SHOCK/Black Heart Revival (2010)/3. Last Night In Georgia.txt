PRETTY BABY WHATCHA THINKIN
DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY BELIEVE
KNOW MY ANGEL DON'T ASK PERMISSION
DON'T NEED YOUR JESUS TO SPREAD MY WINGS

I CAN SMELL YOUR BLOOD OUT IN THE APRIL RAIN
SO HAPPY NEW YEAR HONEY

ME AND MARY'S LAST IN GEORGIA
GONNA BURN THIS PLACE TO THE GROUND
MOON IS FULL LET'S START THE KILLIN
DON'T THINK YOU'LL EVER REALLY KNOW WHAT IS REAL

WHEN YOUR DEMONS SEE YA BLEEDIN
DON'T WORRY BABY I'LL NEVER TELL
WHEN YOU'RE DREAMIN IT'S WHEN YOU SEE EM
YA KNOW IT ALL JUST STARTS WITH A SPELL
