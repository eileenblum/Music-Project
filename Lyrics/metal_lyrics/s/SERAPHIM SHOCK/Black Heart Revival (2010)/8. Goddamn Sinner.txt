I REMEMBER HALLOWEEN WAS EVERY FUCKIN DAY
REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID BACK THEN AND HOW WE'D NEVER CHANGE
WISH YOU COULD SEE YOURSELF PRAYIN FOR THE END
YOU HAVE NO ANSWERS STILL YOU NEVER HAD THEM THEN

AS THE YEARS THEY PASS YOU RIGHT ON BY
DARE YOU JUST TO LOOK ME IN THE EYE

CAUSE I'M YOUR GODDAMN SINNER
DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT YOU THINK
GODDAMN SINNER
MAKIN NO APOLOGIES

ARE YOU SO HAPPY NOW PLAYED IT ALL SO SAFE
DID YOU FIND THAT PERFECT LIFE THEY TOLD YOU STILL AWAITS
LIVIN LIFE THE WAY I CHOOSE ENVY IN YOUR EYES
SAD FOR ALL YOU FUCKIN SHEEP THAT BOUGHT THEIR PACK OF LIES
