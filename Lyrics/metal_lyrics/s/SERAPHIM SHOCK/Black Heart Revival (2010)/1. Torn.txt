AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
ONE TEAR ON THE SNOW A DEATH WISH TRUE
ALONE IN THE COLD IN THIS GARDEN WE DREAM
TONIGHT THIS BEGINS TONIGHT WE WILL BE

WAKE UP CAN YOU FEEL IT
RISE UP RISE UP
WAKE UP CAN YOU TASTE IT
TONIGHT WE TEAR THEM APART

THE PAIN OF ONE BREATH THE END OF YOUR TIME
THESE ANGELS THEY FALL THAT PAINT OUR DEMISE
THE HORROR WE LOVE THE BEAUTY WE BLEED
TONIGHT THIS BEGINS TONIGHT WE WILL BE
