Lying next to her
She's been this way for days
That bullet in her head
It's better off this way
Love letter to the girl
For all she's said and done
Her pretty little corpse
With her I'm still in

Halloween sex n vegas
We did it all
She was the one for me

I see it in her eyes
Lips so cold and blue
The dead still talk to me
Vegas hotel room
I couldn't let her leave
For all she's said and done
Her pretty little corpse
With her I'm still in
