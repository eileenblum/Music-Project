Thrown away for whatever's pc
Apple lie american scheme
Oh so equal in the eye of a god
Who never was to any of us
Not gonna take your phony white shame
Another day another mistake
Zombie masses spoon feed the scam
I'm pissin on your good guy badge

So who's on your side
The devil's on mine
I know ya hate me
White trash satan proud as can be

Say goodbye to the life that ya know
Say hello to the man down below
Scarin all you barbies and kens
Half redneck half livin dead
Try and keep me quiet in line
I'm payin back and takin what's mine
Give me porn pussy vegas and cash
Give me strippers booze tits and ass
