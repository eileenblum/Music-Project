You the dolls and a '57 chevy
Lookin sick on the strip gettin sexy
Murder spree 9 dead and 9 to go
Bring on the nightmare rock n roll

And when it all goes down down down
And when there's nothing left to kill

You... me... sin city

Goin to hell poppin pills spttin whiskey
Bonnie and clyde ain't got nuthin on us baby
Rollin dice with she devils in the neon
One more fuck one more card one more victim
