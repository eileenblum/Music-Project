She hides behind those eyes
The devil gave at birth
She talks to voices in her head
She laughs away the filth
The presents they all leave
The scars don't matter when you're dead

My evil one
My halloween girl
From dusk till dawn
My halloween girl

Little evil says
She's gonna be a star
It's all that film fortune and fame
She's dressed to kill tonight
I think it's time to play
And with their lives they're gonna pay
