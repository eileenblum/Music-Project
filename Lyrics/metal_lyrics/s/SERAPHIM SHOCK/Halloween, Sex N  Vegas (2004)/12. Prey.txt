In an angels eye
Where the shadows meet
In the pale moonlight
In a scarlet dream
Did you know too much
How it's so unreal
To your final breath
As the light spills cold mother mary says

Prey... prey... prey
You're everything I need

Crosses on the wall
Mothers rocking chair
Little helpless doll
Can you feel my stare
Think you know too much
Won't you moan for me my sweet young thing
Body soaked in sweat
As the light spills cold mother mary bleeds
