Waiting for the rain to come
To wash away what we've become
Screaming at the hypnotized
Who still believe in history's lies
On and on the sickness spreads
One generation to the next
Picket fence plastic life
The ghost machine we breed inside

Your future your meaning your vision
And when there is nothing
You will save yourselves

Happily ever after
Happily dead inside
Blindly wanting to believe in

Wasted jaded reason
Broken hopeless puppets
