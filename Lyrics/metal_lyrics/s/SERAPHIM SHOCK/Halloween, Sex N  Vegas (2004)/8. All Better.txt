If we smile we could all be the same
Lets pretend that we're all okay
Happy numbers in a bullshit world
Gotta gun follow me
We could make it all better... all better

Tell us all what to be what to think
Tell us all what to see what to dream
Can you take it just one more day
Gotta gun come and get it
We could make it all better... all better

Hey you
Are just like me
Do you hate do you hate
Everything you see
