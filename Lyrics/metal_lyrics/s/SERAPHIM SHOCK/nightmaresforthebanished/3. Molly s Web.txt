NOTHING'S REAL SAYS MOLLY
CRAWLS IN BED SO COLD
AND FAKE LESSONS FROM PROFESSOR
CIGARETTES FOR MR. HAYES
THROUGH THE TEARS AND RIBBONS
ALL THOSE SECRETS KEPT INSIDE
MOLLY'S WEB OF SADNESS
IN HER PALE BLUE EYES.

WELL ITS MUCH TOO LATE
SO SAVE THE LIES
DON'T SAY YOU'RE SORRY NOW
CAUSE IT NEVER MATTERED THEN

CAN YOU FEEL THEM BREATHING
DID YOU FIND YOURSELF TODAY
DON'T YOU FEEL SO PRETTY
WHEN YOU SEE WHAT YOU BETRAYED
SILENT AT THE WINDOW
WATCHED YOU GIVE THEM EVERYTHING
HOW SHE LOVES TO PLAY ME
MOLLY'S WEB IS GREEN

REMEMBER THE STAINS 
ON A CHRISTMAS GIFT
DID YOU TNINK OF ME
MOLLY SAYS

NEVER AGAIN
