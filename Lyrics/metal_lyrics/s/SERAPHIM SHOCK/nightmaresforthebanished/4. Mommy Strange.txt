DRINK THE DEVILS IN YOUR MIND
THEY'LL NEVER FIND
IT MAY BE JUST A PHASE
HIS PARENTS SAY
THE DOCTORS THEY JUST SMILE
WE BEAT THOSE LOVED
AND TRUST GOD'S WILL BE DONE
MY MOMMY STRANGE

PRIEST
THE VOICE KEEPS TELLING ME
YOU'RE OUT OF TIME
HEY SAY THAT I'M POSSESSED
WOLVES FILL THE SKY
NOW EDWARD'S HERE WITH US
WE BEAT THOSE LOVED
AND TRUST GOD'S WILL BE DONE
MY MOMMY STRANGE

CHAINS
SHAPE SHIFT
GOODBYE
