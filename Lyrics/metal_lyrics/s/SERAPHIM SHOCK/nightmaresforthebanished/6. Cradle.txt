FRANTIC BRIDE BLEEDING 
THE SEA HYPNOTIZED
A WORLD VOID OF MEANING
AN EMPRESS LIE
LOOK IN MY EYES
TELL ME WHAT DO YOU SEE
MY DEAR TWISTED MORTAL
COME MAKE ME BELIEVE

HIDE BEHIND DOCTRINES
AND GUILT RIDDEN SAINTS
LEGACY HORRORS AND MINISTRY SLAVES
TELL ME HOW LONG
WILL WE FEED THIS DISEASE
AS DOOM VISIONED CLOTH PLOTS
THE END TO OUR DREAM
A CRADLE OF FILTH
AND IT'S PUPPET STRINGS
I WILL HAVE NONE

ACCEPT, YE ARE GODS
ALL YE ANGELS OF LIGHT
THE CHRIST THAT YOU SEEK HAS
BETRAYED
THE ANSWERS YOU HOLD,
FOR THEY ROT DEEP INSIDE
ONLY THE MIRROR WILL SAVE
