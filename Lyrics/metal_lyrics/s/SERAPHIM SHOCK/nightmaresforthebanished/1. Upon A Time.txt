SO SORRY KIDS
STILL NOBODY HOME
HEY PREACHER MAN
IT'S TIME FOR THE SHOW
GOT HOLLOW WORDS
FOR A HOLLOW WORLD
THE CLOCK ON THE WALL SAYS
IT'S TIME FOR MY TURN

HEY MR. RED WHITE BLUE
THE PROPHET SAYS
THE JOKE'S ON YOU
THE FEW THE PROUD
THE DUMB THE BLIND
AN AGE OF FIRE
NO PLACE TO HIDE

MATCH ANYONE
GOTTA NAZI POPE
BETTER PRAY REAL HARD
FOR YOUR RELIC'S GHOST
THE CYCLES BEGUN
THE HOUR'S AT HAND
I'M THE FAIRYTALE
IN YOUR GODS PLAN

GONNA BEG
GONNA BLEED
GONNA BURN
DID YOU WISH UPON A TIME
