LITTLE GOTHIC
WON'T YOU MAKE ME CUM INSIDE
FISHNET STOCKINGS AND THAT
CROSS AROUND YOUR NECK
I THINK MOTHER WOULDN'T LIKE
WHAT MARY KNEW
AND SHE DID
LITTLE GOTHIC
GONNA PUT MY SPELL ON YOU

LITTLE GOTHIC
WON'T YOU KTNDLY GET UNDRESSED
IV'E GOT THE TOYS
THAT'LL MAKE THAT VELVET DRIP
I THINK MARY WOULDN'T LIKE
WHAT JESUS KNEW
AND HE DID
LITTLE GOTHIC
GONNA PUT MY SPELL ON YOU

IN DARKNESS I WILL COME AGAIN
TO HOLD YOU ONCE AGAIN
TO KISS YOUR WICKED SMILE

SEX ON BLOODSTAINED LIP'S
LIFELESS DOLL EYES TWITCH

MOONLIGHT UPON YOUR FACE
WOLFSBANE PEAR IN YOUR EYES
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE AMONGST THE DEAD
