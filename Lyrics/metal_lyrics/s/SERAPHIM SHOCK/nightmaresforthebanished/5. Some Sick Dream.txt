BENEATH THE WILLOW TREE
SHE BECKONS ME DEEP INSIDE
AN AUTUMN'S CHILL WITCHES SPELL
BY CANDLELIGHT LEDGENDS CRY

SO SAD THE GHOST
BEHIND HER PRECIOUS SMILE
SO SAD HER HAUNTED HEAD
BLOOD COVERS TIME
ON AND ON IT GOES
THE DEVILS PLAY
DRIFT AWAY

ALONE
SHE'S ALONE AGAIN
SCARLET RAIN
ALONE
SHE'S ALONE AGAIN
ROSES FADE

STARE INTO MY EYES FOREVER
LET ME TAKE YOU IN MY ARMS
DANCE WITH ME OUT IN THE GARDEN
WHERE TOMORROW NEVER COMES
FOLLOW ME INTO THE DARKNESS
WHERE THE NIGHTMARES NEVER FADE
WHISPER DREAMS MY FALLEN ANGEL
FROM WHICH YOU WILL NEVER WAKE

PLEASE STAY
