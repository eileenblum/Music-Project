This Blood Speaks Of Wisdom
This Blood In Which You Bathe
This Blood Speaks Of Ashes
This Blood Burnt Away

But In Time We Will Rise
In Time You Will Know

This Blood Speaks Of Passion
This Blood for Which We Rage
This Blood Speaks Of Promise
This Blood For Which You'll Pay

Raped
By Your Church
By Your Cross
By Your Gods
Revenge

Trust In The Eye That Guides You
Seek Not Their Hope
For In It Lies Despair
But Sear The Flesh
That Separates The Man
From Kingdoms Within
