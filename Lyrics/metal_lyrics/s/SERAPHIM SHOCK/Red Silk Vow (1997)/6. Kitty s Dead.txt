Once Upon A Time
I Lost My Way
Somewhere In The Blue
It's Just For The Day
I Can Watch You Cry
It Means Nothing Now
All Those Letters Sent
They Pale Somehow

And Ish
Kitty Kitty's Dead
Now I Can Dream
Kitty Kitty's Dead
Now I Don't Feel

It Was Never Me
It's Just Not Enough
Never What It Seems
Inside Me Now
What Did You Expect
For Your Memories
Drowning In Regret
You'll Never Know

Loves Will Die - Seasons Pass
Still It's You - I Will Haunt
