Annabell Sits At Her Window
Gazing At The Autumn Sky
Prays That Christ Will Come
And Save Her Soul
Drifting Out Into The Garden
Holding Close To Father's Shame
Fighting Back The Bitter Ages Song

Oh Annabell - When Will You See
There's Nothing Left Inside
At Dawn We Dream

Promises Of Love Forever
Hand And Hand Into The Fields
Curses Prey Upon A Heart So Young
Everything She's Ever Wanted
Clinging To His Velvet Lies
Anything To Take Away The Pain

On And On Into The Season
Waiting For His Serenade
Ghosts will Dance
for One Last Crimson Kiss
Cast Away Times Endless Circle
Haunting Statues In A Spell
Tears Of Blood Betrayed By Mornings Light
