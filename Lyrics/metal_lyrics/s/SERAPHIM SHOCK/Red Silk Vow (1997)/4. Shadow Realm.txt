Reflections Start To Lie
When The Mirror Knows Too Much
Yesterday Has Past
Tomorrow's Long Since Gone
Thirteen Years And Nothing's Changed
The Promises, They Died
Never Let Them See The Rage
You Left Me Wanting

Gifts, From Gods Below
The Strangers Biding Call
The Script Already Written
So Patiently We Wait
There's No Rainbow Here
These Words Are Never Mine
What's Choice For The Chosen
They Never Told Me

Why?

Know Now What You See
The Voice Behind The Veil
Confessions Will Deceive You
Within The Shadow Realm
Our Souls Split And Frayed
Through Thoughts That Transcend Time
Know Now Where You Stand
They'll Never Tell You

Why
