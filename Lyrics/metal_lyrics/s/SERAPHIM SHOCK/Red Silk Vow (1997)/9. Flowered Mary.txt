Clowns Are A Clappin,
So Little Time
Daddy Still Wonders
Mommy Still Cries
Doctrines Of Demons
Traditions At Stake
Portraits Expecting
Feeding My Slaves

Kiss And Tell
See You In Hell

Victims Of Dogma
Hey Where Ya Been
2000 And Counting
Lapping Their Sin
Begging For Your Stripes
Tore Out My Eyes
I'm Holding A secret
Kiddies Won't Find

See The Morning Star
See The Morning Star
Suffocate The Savior
Idol Voices Jingle Keys Insanity
Praise My Filth Nurse Imagination
Smites Round Pay Our Disease

We've Got Flowers For Mary
Je-Je-Jealous Jesus

Routine Rituals, Why Be At All?
Can't Take The Questions Nor The Pain
Momentary Precious, If I Could I Would
But Nothing Stayed The Same
Can You See, Can You Feel,
Don't You Know It's A Dream
I'm Your Damned Queen
