Emptiness Will Always Be
Into The Void Like All Before
Nothing Escapes This Hours Ash
These People Sleep A Dyer's Dream

Rise &amp; Resist

What Keeps Us Here To Walk The Line
Another Day Conditioned Slave
So Listen Well To What They Preach
As Figureheads Laugh In Your Face

And They Will Take
And Take
Until There Is Nothing

On And On The Game It Goes
Fragile Pawns In Heavens Play
Denial Rules Our History
Now Don't You Think,
Why Don't You Think

Let Us See Among Us
