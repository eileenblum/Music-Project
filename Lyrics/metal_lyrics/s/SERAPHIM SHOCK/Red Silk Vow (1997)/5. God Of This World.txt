Jesus And Me Been Playin' Some Chess
It Doesn't Matter Who Wins
Dimensional Fluxes Reality Twist
Bow At Your Alter Of Skin
So Many Pages, Too Many Lives
Soaked In The Blood Of The Church
Guise Of An Angel, Bringer Of Light
Let's Fuck And Suck Till It Hurts

My Hate - Our Eyes - Your Soul - Minion
God, I Am Your God Of This World
God, I Am Your God Of This

Notice Dillusion, Just Do What It Takes
We'll Give Ya Just What You Need
Slave To The Holy - Cycles Divine
Don't Think You'll Ever Be Free
