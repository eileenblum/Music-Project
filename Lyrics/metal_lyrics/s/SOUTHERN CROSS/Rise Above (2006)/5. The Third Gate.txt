[Music: Southern Cross, Lyrics: David Lizotte]

Can't this be over
Something's tearing me down
I never meant to leave you
But something's calling me, taking all of what I've found
Will I find a way

Now that I'm blinded, the light surrounds me
Shivering cold is freezing my eyes
This indecision has brought me to be
A fateless betrayer, a dying fool

All the pieces of what's left behind
Illusions, you're still waiting from time to time
I had to leave it all behind
And hear you one last time
Now and then, the third gate remains

Speechless, I am losing ground
Can't no longer wait to see them smile
Fearless, I return again
In another time, in another mind
I reborn again
