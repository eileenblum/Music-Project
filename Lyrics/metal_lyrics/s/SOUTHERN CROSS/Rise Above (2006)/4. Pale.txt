[Music: Southern Cross, Lyrics: David Lizotte]

Now I know I shouldn't have come here alone
When darkness falls right on me
Down here I am on my own
Bound with these chains
Help me get out of this place

No, I've got no relation
No political ambition
No need to be raped
Is there anything else I could do
To forget the pain that lies

Inside me, within me, escaping from this madness
I'm trying, but it's not quite so easy as it seems to be

Lying Harmless
Lost all my faith in life
Cold haze around me
Crying to crawl away

I'm craving, repenting what I have sworn to myself
Few minutes remaining before I catch my final breath
