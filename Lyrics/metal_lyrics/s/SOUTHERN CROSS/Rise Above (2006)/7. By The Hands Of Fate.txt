[Music: Southern Cross, Lyrics: David Lizotte]

I wanted you to know
We came from down below, a prison for our sanity
Don't let me answer
Tides of time will show you all you need to know

I hear it screaming deep down inside
It holds me, behaves me
It makes me see what I can't see
It grabs my soul, enslaves me

So many years I've been holding on
So many wasted, all alone
Confined to obey enemies devotion
No use to blame humanity
No use to praise divinities
I'm driven by the hand of fate

Nailed to my destiny
I've lost my sense of time
Fighting shadows off my mind
But they control my soul and spit on me

I can hardly remember when
The first time, my first crime
And those gods of hate
They're in my head instead of me
