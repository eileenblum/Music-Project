[Music: Southern Cross, Lyrics: David Lizotte]

Let hope remind me one last time
As I close my eyes
All this splendour by my side
Was crumbling down
I've heard a voice from behind
Wiped away I was broken down
There was only one thing left to do for now
Don't let me down

I don't deserve what's happening now
As the curtain falls
Don't feel sorry for it all
The truth is gone in the shifting sands
Torn appart he broke her down
There was only one thing left to do for now
Believe me

I never tried to reach the other side
A sad victim of my stormy fate
I never thought of leaving them behind
But now I m blamed for what I
Could never dare say
