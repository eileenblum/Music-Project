[Music: Southern Cross, Lyrics: David Lizotte]

For all you've done you should be blamed
For those nights of morbid evil dreams
Terrifying and bloody scenes
A gun in hand, aimed at your temple
And ready to shoot
You are running out of time
Running out of time

Flesh, the angel now is crying
Upon her knees and betrayed
Now you're gonna pay

Flair, the evil in the spotlight
While no one seems to care he may do it again
You're gonna pay
And you're running out of time

Hey! What do you think you were trying to do
How the hell could you figure it out
What if you couldn't even breathe by your own
Now! All I want is to shatter you down
I've been down on my knees all the way
Fuck you, it's too late now, you shall be damned

You re living for something you can only behold
Believing in a lie won't keep you alive
Since you've been trying to steal my own dream
I can t stand all alone, you're better off dead
