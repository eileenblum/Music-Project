[Music: Southern Cross, Lyrics: David Lizotte]

As time is fading, slowly running down
Something upsets me, the picture has grown
Those endless dreams replaying night and day
Those strings playing on and on
Where have they gone

And the leaves start to fall
And time is slowly drifting away
We're carried away by the fears
Of those who have lost control

There's got to be much more for us
We're falling far from grace
There still remains in every waking dawn
A fading sun

With every tear that falls
With each breath we take
Our sketches on the wall are no longer part of our fate
Hey! You! Center of our faith
Raise your hollow voice and make us take a stand

Is there a way to break out
And forget the time passing by
We're carried away by the fears
Of those who have lost control
