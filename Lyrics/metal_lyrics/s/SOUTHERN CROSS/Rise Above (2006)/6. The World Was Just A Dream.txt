[Music: Southern Cross, Lyrics: David Lizotte]

It might be real
It might be what I used to believe in
Every time I close my eyes
To get away from this misfortune all alone

This world was just a dream
We were living in together
This place where everything but time
Was put aside, was buried in oblivion
