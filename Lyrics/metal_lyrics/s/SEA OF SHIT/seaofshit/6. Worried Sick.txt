Alone, diseased, quarantined
In a constant state of sadness
Tendency to feel empty
Having trouble concentrating
Severe disinterest in everything
Always feeling restless
Loss of appetite
Always feeling helpless with no sense of time
Constantly consumed by death &amp; dying
Thoughts of suicide

Always feeling pain
Fear of going insane
I'm so fucking worried
