In spite the vast they want to control the world
Cut of the hands of those who breach the trust
In the mirror key the system starts to avail
It's merely a question of common sense
Monopolize - Just a drop in the ocean
Monopolize - Can we sell this world?
Monopolize - Brainwash complete
Monopolize - Who cares?
They have found a way to masquerade the lies
Remote controlled like worms and useless flies
Digging holes in the soil for our rebirth
A question of integrity and whipped up froth
Monopolize - Just a drop in the ocean
Monopolize - Can we sell this world?
Monopolize - Brainwash complete
Monopolize - Who cares?
Deep as the depths - Of forever we fall
Recycled as drones - Monopolized world
Deep as the depths - Of forever we fall
Recycled as drones - Monopolized world
Deep as the depths - Of forever we fall
Recycled as drones - Monopolized world
Monopolize - Just a drop in the ocean
Monopolize - Can we sell this world?
Monopolize - Brainwash complete
Monopolize - Who cares?
