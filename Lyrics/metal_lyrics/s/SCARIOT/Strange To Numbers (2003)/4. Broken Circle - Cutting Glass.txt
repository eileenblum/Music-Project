It feels like a dream, yet I am awake
Weak and shivering, ready to break
Nothing seems like it once did
Bleeding sorrow is how I became to be
Days feel like years - No one to wipe these bleeding tears
Falling to my knees, nearly to the ground
Screaming why? No answer to be found
Rising up, striking down, sorrow to me is bound
Broken circle - cutting glass
Laying down on broken glass
These feelings will never pass
You my love, where always there
I reach my arms out to pull you near
It's raining cutting glass - This pain will never pass
Self-inflicted bleeding heart - I will not survive...
Broken circle - cutting glass
Growing stronger, knowing the way
Passes through my flaming heart
Sweet mother of god what have I done
My eternal love is gone
Grasping the moment, crushing it down
Blood dripping guilt, my soul is covered in filth
What I would give to make wrong right
My bleeding heart feeds on my past
Longing and crying for your sweet embrace
I can't stand tall for what I did, so I lay my body to the ground
Self-destruction is what this is 
Breaking your heart is all I can see, with that I suffer endlessly
All you can meant to me and all you are 
Is now written in a single star
Shining down upon my face
Longing and crying for your sweet embrace
