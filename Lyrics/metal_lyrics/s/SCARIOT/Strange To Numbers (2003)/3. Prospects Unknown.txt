To obtain immortality - Enter the future unknown
Touch your desire, beyond the dreaming web
In this place where the world shines
For those who have laid down in death
Resting in this orb waiting for they god
A frozen deep - in endless sleep
The shadow effect fooled by their god
A frozen deep - in endless sleep
The shadow effect - now I am...
Here, in this sphere waiting for turn
Watched by the eyes of time
Stored away in their cryonic tomb
Time becomes meaningless
In this complex form of context
Really, who wants to live forever?
A frozen deep - in endless sleep
The shadow effect fooled by their god
A frozen deep - in endless sleep
The shadow effect - prospects unknown
Who are you to judge what I believe in?
Money talks and now the order has been placed for me
For over a 1000 years, waiting for someone to wake me up
Will I then be preserved? - An undefined error
For over a 1000 years, waiting for someone to wake me up
Will I then be preserved? An undefined error
Who could tell - Money well spent!
For over a 1000 years, waiting for someone to wake me up
Will I then be preserved? - An undefined error
For over a 1000 years, waiting for someone to wake me up
Will I then be preserved? An undefined error
Who could tell?
