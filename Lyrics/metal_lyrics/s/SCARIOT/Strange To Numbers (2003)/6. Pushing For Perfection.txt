In an endless pile of steel and glass
Things fall apart, the centre can't hold
Why? We ask, we are condemned by laws
Their gloried faces washed in blood at birth
Floating in a sea of filth - Put a spike in my vein
Floating in a sea of filth - Put a spike in my vein
Like roaring thunder, a minefield playground
Children ripped from their mother's womb
Dark death and shattered brains
Babies born by drug washed whores
Something fierce... Breathing in this pinion dark
Passing into nothingness . Something fierce...
Nature never blames, or condemns us for our acts
Like roaring thunder, a minefield playground
Children ripped from their mother's womb
Dark death and shattered brains
Babies born by drug washed whores
Something fierce... Beyond the last fall o man
Pushing for perfection - Something fierce
May reveal the painful truth - Thoughts of confusion
In all the dreams that lays before me
No sound as the leaves falls
In the eyes of the sleepless
Waxed as deadly as chill could kill
Floating in a sea of filth - Put a spike in my vein
Floating in a sea of filth - Put a spike in my vein
Like roaring thunder, a minefield playground
Children ripped from their mother's womb
Dark death and shattered brains
Babies born by drug washed whores...
