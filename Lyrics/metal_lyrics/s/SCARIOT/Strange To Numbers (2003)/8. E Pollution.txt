The days we know no longer exist
Defragmentation of the structures within
Who can peer deep inside the future?
All riddled in the code of conduct
Machines has become gods in this world
Rage is rising towards this soulless breed
Who makes past, present, and future blend
Controlling every single move, applying laws and rules
Machines has become gods in this world
Rage is rising towards this soulless breed
Systems overloaded, the world turns dark
Rivers flooding with blood
Electronic polution falls from the sky - The signs are all here...
Who am I in the system? - Who am I to stand in the way?
Who am I in the process? - A piece of the puzzle that toils to adapt
It feels like the future is here now - Realizing it was never gone
Just another screensaver - The signs are all here...
Black rain is falling - Loss of faith, in a dead end storm
Play your role in the system
The evolution of destructive instincts
World tension is building - A cold blade on the throat of mankind
Distance now increasing - As we enter narrow focus mode
Ctrl - alt - delete - the end of the cycle
Forced / quit / shutdown - strange loops take us into the mix
Past / present / future - controlled human factor
Distorted / mind / system - some sort of over lit neon expanse
Deconstruction...
Deconstruction...
Deconstruction...
