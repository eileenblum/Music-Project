I am the pain &amp; sorrow
I am the boundless joy
None have ever seen my face
Darkness is my name
I breathe in the silence
Your dream - a world of eternal dark
Tyranny hides in the air tonight
In your darkest dreams I haunt you
To steal your soul &amp; gloried heart
Under the midnight moonlight
Now behold - Your fear
Your soul now belongs to me
As you crawl in the soil
I steal your heart &amp; soul
A hole in my chest
Where the heart I search for shall be placed
Inside this shell your soul will grow me strong
Beneath my shadow - unbroken spirits
Leads the way to your shadow land
Under the midnight moonlight
I unleash my rage, leave all compassion behind
Drain the life from your weak human like form
Impelled by a twisted vengeance
A road rage from within
My future is here and it's not spanned by fools
Enter darkness sweet &amp; cold
I will haunt yuo down...
