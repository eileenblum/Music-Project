Born into the world with no intension at all
Casualities are set from the start
The roads to devastation are many
Will any lead to salvation?
Guided by sources of the "righteous"

An innocent child. Slowly being poisoned.
With all the convictions. Possessed by adults.

No perception of life the fat all
Prejudice seems the obvious way
How to find a right way?

Ultimately, we all develop from the filth
There's no righteous source
Man is too complex
Only death combine us

Born into the world with no intension at all
Casualities are set from the start
We can only hope for a better man
Forming humans

An innocent child. Slowly being poisoned.
With all the convictions. Possessed by adults.
