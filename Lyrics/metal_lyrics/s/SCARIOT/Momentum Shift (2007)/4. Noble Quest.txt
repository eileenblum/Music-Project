A destined pattern to the complex man
One single faith, to billions of individuals?

It makes no sense, I cannot gamble on the expected
Trapped in under the wings of mortality

Only the dead will know
What is right for you is wrong for me
The personal truth is many folded

Only the dead will know
Immortality would give life no sense
I don't care about death
It never cared about me

Your kingdom is not what I desire
Only death will be my relief
Why go somewhere against my will?

My path is clear. I don't need thy offer.
It simply doesn't appeal to me. I envy you out.

Only the dead will know
What is right for you is wrong for me
The personal truth is many folded

Only the dead will know
Immortality would give life no sense
I don't care about death
It makes no sense

I'm not guilty of any of your sins
I'm not asking much. I crave to the end.

Only the dead will know
What is right for you is wrong for me
The personal truth is many folded

Only the dead will know
Immortality would give life no sense
I don't care about death
It makes no sense
