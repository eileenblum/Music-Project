Bleeding leaves cover the ground
The day of the dying is here
Looking back with no repent

I'm leaving with a great sense of gratification
A lifetime filled with achievements
Can I ask for more?

There's no sadness in this room
My eyes reveal total peace
I don't need to exist forever
No need for salvation

Nothing to forever

Bleeding leaves cover the ground
The day of the dying is here
Looking back with no repent
Can I ask for more?

No need for salvation
My memories and deeds will remain
Mourn not, over my dead flesh
Nothing is forever...

Bleeding leaves cover the ground
The day of the dying is here
Looking back with no repent
I'm leaving with a great sense
