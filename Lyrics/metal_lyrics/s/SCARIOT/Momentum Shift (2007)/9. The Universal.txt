He gracefully speared my malleable young heart
With a spear of sulphur and his knowledge of the dark
There, in a split of a second - it all was gone
The moon, the stars and the majestic sun

Since then darkness has travelled with me
In this inner maze of confusion and greed
Sorrow is ever present, active in its mission
Behind me, nothing but a trail of friction

Days have slowly turned into years
Like I - once innocent - heve turned evil and fierce
But sometimes - in a glimpse - I recall what's gone
The moon, the stars and the majestic sun

Ever since, sadness has travelled with me
In this somber maze of confusion and greed
The everlasting state of darkness
The universal all-consuming shadow of life
