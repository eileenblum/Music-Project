They try to guide you. But, for what reason?
To please you or their own ego?
The truth is what you say
Stay focused and be the judge yourself
Someone will always try to convince

They know what's best for you. Who's the master of your mind?
And you're just giving it away
Follow a pattern is often walking a dead end street
Only to satisfy them

There's always a right turn. There's no one more righteous
There're only slaves of slaves
Mental products failed to succeed
Free your mind and feel a sense of life
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

They know what's best for you. Who's the master of your mind?
And you're just giving it away
Follow a pattern is often walking a dead end street
Only to satisfy them

A non-reversible downfall. Caused by the ego of man
Behold the process of madness
Futile attempts to heal. Too late to develop a cure
Too late for this sickening world

Into supreme controlled mass hypnosis
Leader of the human race?
To further devastation it leads us
No room for independent thinking
Feeding the hate and hasten our fall
A non-reversible downfall
