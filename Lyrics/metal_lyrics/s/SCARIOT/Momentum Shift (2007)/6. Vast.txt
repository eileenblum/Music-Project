I am a grain of sand on the shore
A shore of million shores

I am a grain of sand on the shore
A shore of million shores
Placed on planet Tellus
On this planet we stand tall

In a single solar system
One planet out of billions
What possible part do we have?
Where's the link?

I am insignificant
Fooled by emotions and this urge of importance
"But I must see my loved ones again"

Because you're emotional twisted mind says so?
Cause man plays a peculiar role in the universe?

What possible part - in this puzzle we are in - do we have?

I see no importance of the human race
Not even my own ego
I am but nothing. What's the link?
Who are you?

What possible part - in this puzzle we are in - do we have?
