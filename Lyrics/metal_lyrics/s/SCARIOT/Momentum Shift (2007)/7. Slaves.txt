What have you become?
Your mind has been distorted
Paralyzed you follow the masses 
Unable to stand on your own feet 
Your choices have already been made

How can you obey the ignorant?
They pollute your mind with own judgement
A never ending circle
Biuld you up. Tear you down. Rules to follow.

It's your eyes watching, but not your mouth talking
This anti human you try to be
How can it set you free?
