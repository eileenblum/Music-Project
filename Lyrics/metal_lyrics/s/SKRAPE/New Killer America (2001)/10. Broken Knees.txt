My eyes seem to see
What others never see
Something's building inside me
But it's not for real

You hate Rape me

Some way is how
My resurrection's now
So unable to breathe
With broken knee's

No cause for a scene
Cause no one's knees are clean
Such a killer inside me
I'll come for you

You hate Rape me
You hate Rape me

Some way is how
My resurrection's now
So unable to breathe
With broken knee's

Don't tell me I can't hate
You hate Rape me

You hate Rape me

I'll never hurry I'll never worry I walk on broken knee's
