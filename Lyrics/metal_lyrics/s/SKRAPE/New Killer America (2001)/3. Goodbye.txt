We say we know what we want so we do
Age of infusion we melt to the core

I tell you this time hey, goodbye
4 walls retracting, I cry

Goodbye!!

Body and soul I'm impressed we expose
Comfort yourself and ignore what you chose
Space out your bad dreams let this fuck you up

I tell you this time hey, goodbye
4 walls retracting, I cry

Goodbye!!

Son of a soul swingin' the meat scene
Given the goal breakin' the porn queen
Kickin' my hate black an white daydream
Over the bold givin' up the soul

I cry Goodbye
I cry Goodbye
Space out your bad dreams let this fuck you up
