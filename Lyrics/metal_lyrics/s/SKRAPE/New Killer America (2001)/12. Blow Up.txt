In time the truth will come
Your mind's blind and you won't come home

It's what you need to ignore
It's what you get in store
You can't explain
You won't be the same

I rage sometimes

Set up the blow up
Open your mind
See how I rage sometimes

Same sign the time will come
Break down clown you get high from some

It's what you need to ignore
It's what you get in store
You can't explain
You won't be the same

I rage sometimes

Set up the blow up
Open your mind
See how I rage sometimes

You can't ignore yourself
You can't ignore yourself
You can't ignore yourself
You can't ignore yourself

In time the truth will come
Your mind's blind and you won't come home

It's what you need to ignore
It's what you get in store
You can't explain
You won't be the same

I rage sometimes

Set up the blow up
Open your mind
See how I rage sometimes
