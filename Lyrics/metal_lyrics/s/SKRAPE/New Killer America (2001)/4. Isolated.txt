I feel no pain
I walk right through
A no where man
Learned from you

You get the one that you wished for you laugh to cry
I guess the one that you wished for has made you cry

I told you, some way
So quick to, rename
Isotated

My grip is good
I fall to stand
A smile that could
Screams out a plan

You get the one that you wished for you laugh to cry
I guess the one that you wished for has made you cry

I told you, someway
So quick to, rename
Your weary, no soul
So quick to, rename

I told you, some way
So quick to, rename
Isotated

Isolated
