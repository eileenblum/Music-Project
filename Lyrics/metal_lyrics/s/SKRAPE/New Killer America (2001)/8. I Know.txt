I'm not impressed out but it might seem to look that way to you
I can impress I can try to come off cool
And if you drag me into feeling like I'm tired of you
I wouldn't care even though it might seem to look that way

Don't tell me now I know
I'll figure it out on my own

I'm not in check but I don't show what I say to you
I never flinch never care I know I'm cool
And if you drag me into feeling like I'm tired of you
I wouldn't care even though your in front of me

Don't tell me now I know
I'll figure it out on my own

Don't you think You know you might
This offering My friends invite
Go ahead And face what's mine
The end of you I wash the slime

Don't tell me now I know
I'll figure it out on my own

Don't you think you could
Don't you think you might
