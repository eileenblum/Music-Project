Outside it's freezing
Inside it's cold
No one to keep me warm
My bones are old

All day the cold stays
And someday I won't wait

Some days are dismal
Other days to send
Snowflakes to save my face
I shed my skin

All day the cold stays
And someday I won't wait

Sunshine inject my mind warm me

I can't feel my hands

Sunshine inject my mind warm me

I sit around and watch the snow
I see the sun come out then go

I wish this really was not so
But falling down on the ice
Means it's melting slow

Sunshine inject my mind warm me
