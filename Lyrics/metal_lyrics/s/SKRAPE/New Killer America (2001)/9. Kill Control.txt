Over mind exposed
Down the tube it goes
Projects my sanity
Pass the point of pain
To decrease then gain
Image of my scene

I let you down for wasting my crown
I held out your charm an took all your pride
Put the rest in still
Charge my point an trip
Suck the passion free
My distress I crave
Be submissed be brave
Precondition so I see

I let you down for wasting my crown
I held out your charm an took all your pride
I took all your pride for wasting my crown
I held out your charm and I let you down

Kill It Control It

I let you down for wasting my crown
I held out your charm an took all your pride
I took all your pride for wasting my crown
I held out my crown cause I let you down

Kill It Control It
