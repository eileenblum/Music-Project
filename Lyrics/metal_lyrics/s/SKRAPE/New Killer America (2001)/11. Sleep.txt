Come to
I need to feel
You bore me too
When you sleep too long

Strange house
Same day
When you tickle my insides
Into my stream line

When will you fall upon your face?

Wake up
I dream for me
You must be high
Cause you dare me

Strange house
Same day
And I can't be

Something's inside me,
Something's inside

When will you fall upon your face?
