Image, of my soul
Confusing, made into something

I know the sea
I must throw it away
No one is safe 
In this sunlight today

So lets just pray
So lets just pray
So lets just pray
Together, together!

Pray, this will never let us down

Slowdown, let me shell you
Seldem, sells you

I know the sea
I must throw it away
No one is safe 
In this sunlight today

So lets just pray
So lets just pray
So lets just pray
Together, together!

Pray, this will never let us down

Never, let me down
Lets you down

Slowly I rise from my resting
Toying with myself and fall back glistening
Sweat is the taste when you leave me
And stuck in a wasteland of no more

No, No, No, No
What is this?
Was that the timer?
Or was I only sleeping?
