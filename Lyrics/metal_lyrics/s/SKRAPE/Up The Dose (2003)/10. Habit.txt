Stop messing with my level head
Im running away
Tried fixing you
Cant go it alone
It wasnt this way

It always on your mind
Always on rewind
Slow change, No decline
It shows, its always on your mind

Check my request, for caress
In comes a day
Tried fixing you
Cant go it alone
It wasnt this way

Its ok to be, Its ok to be free
To throw it away

It always on your mind
Always on rewind
Slow change, No decline
It shows, its always on your mind

And its total affection
Its total affection
I run you, to hate me
I run you!

It always on your mind
Always on rewind
Slow change, No decline
It shows, its always on your mind
