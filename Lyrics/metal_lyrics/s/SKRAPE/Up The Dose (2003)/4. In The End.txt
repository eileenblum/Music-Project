Dont you cut me down
Unsaid noise Ive found
You said you'd be cruel
Our conversation hurt you

As you speak, its obvious
But in the end, its all words

Speak the way you feel
But spoken words dont heal
You cant change this now
Ive learned that this is how

As you speak, its obvious
But in the end, its all words

We fall apart, we all fall apart
You fall apart, we all fall apart

I cant see the obvious
Cuz in the end, you know its all your turn
And nothing heals the words we live
But actions speak louder then words
