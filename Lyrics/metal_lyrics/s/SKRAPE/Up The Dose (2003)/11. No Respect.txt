####, Stupid, 12345678 Go!

Everyone really knows you
Secrets show to the real you
Impress us, still just hide
So extreme is the fakeness
So being me is the worthiness
Speak the words you deny

What you think Im so ashamed?
Cant tell that you still know my name
Things aint never gonna change
No repect I feel the same

So whats on for the masses?
Hanging close to the classes
All the while you just fry
This new revolation
A classic bending observation
Disrespect in your eyes

What you think Im so ashamed?
Cant tell that you still know my name
Things aint never gonna change
No repect I feel the same

So its true, I can feel its worth
I said what do you live for?
I was into it before
I scream no respect
Im not going to take it anymore

What you think Im so ashamed?
Cant tell that you still know my name
Things aint never gonna change
No repect I feel the same

No respect, No respect, No respect
I get no respect
