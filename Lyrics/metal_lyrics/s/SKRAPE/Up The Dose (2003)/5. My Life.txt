Hey Hey, #### you! and all the bitches made
Once again, I fit it in
And #### it up again
And you think what?
A motherfucker abusing rake
In the face of hate
I stay in shape, I push it to an escapade

There goes my life
And now it seems
That Im drowning
This is my life
And now it seems
That Im drowning

Respect, isnt something you get for free, From me
A generation left me floating independently
Now keep gain to what the industry showed me
The masterminds, they trusted you freely, today

There goes my life
And now it seems
That Im drowning
This is my life
And now it seems
That Im drowning

There goes my life
And now it seems
That Im drowning
This is my life
And now my dreams
Have been drowning
