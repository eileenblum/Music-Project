This fades into all that you say
Up in, its all mine
A virgin to the sound of today
We all shine

Stand up, Stretch Your mind
Were living in a summer song
Breakout, Dont taste fine
Were living in a summer song

This burns in my thoughts for today
A frame of mind
A picture in the sunlight and shade
Alive we live life

Stand up, Stretch Your mind
Were living in a summer song
Breakout, Dont taste fine
Were living in a summer song

Sunlight, Sunlight, 

Stand up, Stretch Your mind
Were living in a summer song
Breakout, Dont taste fine
Were living in a summer song

My summer song, My summer song, My summer song
