In the air my troubles are away
Only if just for this one day
Everyday is an afternoon clowns
Kings and Queens and we all
Get crowned, the change has fly
Leaving you left to try

Walking threw dark, she stumbles into the light
Bleaching out the backdrop her eyes steal the wait

She thinks the worlds so grey
Its right because its just that way
Lifes threw backdrops and collasel extremes
Your reactions make me want to
Want to scream, the change has fly
Leaving you left to try

Walking threw dark, she stumbles into the light
Bleaching out the backdrop her eyes steal the wait

Your headaches, Get up, Get up, Go

Walking threw dark, she stumbles into the light
Bleaching out the backdrop her eyes steal the wait

Your living, Alone
