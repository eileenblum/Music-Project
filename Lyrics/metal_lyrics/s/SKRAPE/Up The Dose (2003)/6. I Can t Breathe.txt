I cant breathe, when you suffocate me
Theres no thoughts, you just suffocate
Such twisted reasons, not so clear anymore
Give what we give, and then were screaming no more

Maybe, I cant stop calling, Im so true
And you've been doubting me all along
Maybe, I'll turn the shoulder, you'll know
Then you wont doubt me cold anymore

I cant think, when you complicate me
Theres no sound, you just complicate
Your self-expression makes this feel like before
Give what we give, and then were screaming no more

Maybe, I cant stop calling, Im so true
And you've been doubting me all along
Maybe, I'll turn the shoulder, you'll know
Then you wont doubt me cold anymore

I have been suffocating

Maybe, I cant stop calling, Im so true
And you've been doubting me all along
Maybe, I'll turn the shoulder, you'll know
Then you wont doubt me cold anymore

Maybe, Someday

I cant breathe
I cant breathe
I cant breathe
I cant breathe
When you suffocate me
