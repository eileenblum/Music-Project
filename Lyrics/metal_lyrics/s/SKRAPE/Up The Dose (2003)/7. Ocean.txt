I, Im driving the backroads
In my mind, the oceans cold
I, I cant wait on you
My time is now, and now that its true

If I cant find, find my way to the sand
Ill dream that I, I see sun on the waters edge

I, I will travel far
But my visions blurred, the suns in my eyes
I,Im driving the backroads
In my mind, the oceans cold

If I cant find, find my way to the sand
Ill dream that I, I see sun on the waters edge

Imagine the sunshines on your back
If time stood still, You know Id be back

If I cant find, find my way to the sand
Ill dream that I, I see sun on the waters edge

The oceans cold, The oceans cold
Im going away

Ill run away
Go a distance for
Ill run away, away

Ill run away
Go a distance for you
Ill run away, away for you
