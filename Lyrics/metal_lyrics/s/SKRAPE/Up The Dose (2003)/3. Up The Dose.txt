Give it back, Give it back, Give it back to me
Let it go, let it go, let it go threw me
I cant show you how there treating me
Here I come, Here I come, are you ready for me?

I want to forget just how you feel
This is what I need to make this real
Up the dose, you know I do
Up the dose, I will
Up the dose the never ending dose
And Ill get higher and higher

Break away, break away, break away from me
Im a feign, Im a feign, Im a feign to me
My reaction is whats keeping me
Dirty me, I can see, are you ready for me?

I want to forget just how you feel
This is what I need to make this real
Up the dose, you know I do
Up the dose, I will
Up the dose the never ending dose
And Ill get higher and higher

Up the dose the never ending dose
Higher and higher
Up the dose the never ending dose
Higher and higher
And Ill get higher and higher
Up the dose
