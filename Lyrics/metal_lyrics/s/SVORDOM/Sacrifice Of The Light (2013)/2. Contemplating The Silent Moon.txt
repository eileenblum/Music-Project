I'm falling and I'm crawling to another life, my darkest dream

see I'm falling down

all those sorrows smothered in silence won't be lost in time
I am bleeding now
you cant reach me now
I am already gone

all these tears pierce my heart, so far from the light
these wounds won't heal in time I'm smothering a silent cry
and I'm sitting here, contemplating the silent moon

my mind is getting darker, my heart is getting no stronger
I am giving myself away
please let go, don't beg me to stay
living a lie, I don't wanna live this lie

I don't wanna understand, I fear this reality

I don't wanna understand, I fear this reality
I choke myself in every breath I take
I will say goodbye to this life
I will say goodbye to this life
now I will close my eyes and fall asleep forever

all these tears pierce my heart, so far from the light
these wounds won't heal in time I'm smothering a silent cry
and I'm sitting here, contemplating the silent moon
