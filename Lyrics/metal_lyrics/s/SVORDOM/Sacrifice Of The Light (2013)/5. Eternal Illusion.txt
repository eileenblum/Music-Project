this sorrow comes to me at night
abandoned, lost and guilty I find, myself wandering aimlessly
there is no tomorrow for me, no sun shining for me
this is my last breath and while I'm fading away,
sinking down I feed myself of this

eternal illusion
eternal illusion
eternal illusion
eternal illusion

this sorrow comes to me at night
my only friend, the pain
is whispering my funeral song
the darkness stabs my soul, lost in desolation
while I walk this path of endless suffering

oh my eternal
oh my eternal
oh my eternal
eternal illusion

eternal illusion
eternal illusion
eternal illusion
oh my

eternal illusion
I'm fading away sinking down
I feed myself of this eternal illusion, illusion
my only friend the pain is whispering my funeral song
the darkness stabs my soul lost in desolation

eternal
eternal
eternal
illusion
