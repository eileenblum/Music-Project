for how long would you hide from yourself
in this empty mess, everything is overrated
what have I become?

try to forget it
try to regret it
we're all so done at this point
there's nothing left to do now
I cant breathe myself
I cant save myself
I'm a shame
hiding away from the light

for how long
can I hide from myself
sing to the moon all my pain
this sadness won't leave me alone
I depend on it

you can't forget what you said
you can't forget what you meant

try to forget it
try to regret it
we are all so done at this point
there's nothing left to do now
I cant breathe myself
I cant save myself
I'm a shame hiding away from the light
I have to destroy everything I make
I'm a shame hiding away from the light

I won't continue this way
pointless thoughts obscure my mind
everything fell apart and I cant face myself in this endless dark

what have I become I cant face myself ,everything fell apart

try to forget it
try to regret it
we are all so done at this point
there's nothing left to do now
I cant breathe myself
I cant save myself
I'm a shame hiding away from the light
I have to destroy everything I make
I'm a shame hiding away from the light

I won't continue this way pointless thoughts obscure my mind

try to forget it
try to regret it
we are all so done at this point
there's nothing left to do now
I have to destroy everything I make
I'm a shame hiding away from the sun

away, away, away from the sun
