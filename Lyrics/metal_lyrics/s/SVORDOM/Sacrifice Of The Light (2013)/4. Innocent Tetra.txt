tormenting whispers
are wandering to my head
can't find the light in everything I've said
soulless cries echoing in my mind
wishing I had something to find
but nothing seems to be right
I am the missing the piece
no one will ever find
I am the darkness who contaminates the light
I will never find my place to shine

see things, hear things calling
see things, hear things call me
see things, hear things calling
see things, hear things call me
see things, hear things calling
see things, hear things call me

well I've heard
tormenting whispers
wandering to my head
cant find the light
in everything I've said
soulless cries
echoing in my mind

everything is motionless
and I cant find the strength to go on
every place is too narrow for me
I cannot breathe
I cannot even speak
my mind is so out of reach
everything will disappear
nothing is real
this mirror won't show me anymore
I lost myself long ago
living upside down
is not easy to fit things right

see things, hear things calling
see things, hear things call me
see things, hear things calling
see things, hear things call me
see things, hear things calling
see things, hear things call me

everything is motionless
and I cant find the strength to go on
every place is too narrow for me
I cannot breathe
