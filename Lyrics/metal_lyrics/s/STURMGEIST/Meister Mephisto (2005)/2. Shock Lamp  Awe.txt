Get the hell out of here
We strike from the air
When Lucifer's at war
A people turns gore

Shock and awe
The Beast likes it raw
Do What Thou Wilt
Is the whole of their Law

You better not be here
We kill from the air
Satan's war on terror
The darkest night of horror

Shock and awe
The Beast likes it raw
Do What Thou Wilt
Is the whole of their Law

Shock &amp; Awe
[Repeat]

Medals for the dead
We honour your fall
A body bag for the blood you shed
Soldier, you gave it all

Shock &amp; Awe
[Repeat]

Medals for the dead
America honours your fall
A body bag for the blood you shed
Soldier, you gave it all

Shock &amp; Awe
[Repeat]

Whichever side you're on
It hurts to lose a son
Satan's war on terror
The darkest night of horror

Shock and awe
The Beast likes it raw
Do What Thou Wilt
Is the whole of their Law

Shock &amp; Awe
[Repeat]
