We ride towards the open West
Grave of the weak, Hell for the rest
A serpent's eye shines on the shaft of my Colt
Satan shoots you down with a burning bolt

A silver bullet screams avenging my brother
If you don't want to die go home to your mother
Grimmer than ugly more vicious than bad
Strife rules the land where God went mad

We ride towards the haunted West
Tomb of the meek, Hell for the rest
Where women are loose and gold abound
Death is the friend of the meanest band around

This is the desert where our legend began
A bottle of whisky for the life of a man
Grimmer than ugly more vicious than bad
Strife rules the land where God went mad

Whipping our horses on towards the West
End of the frail, Hell for the rest
When gold is the matter we are your men
Let Destiny settle if or when

Rivers of blood, churchyards of dust
We kill if we have to and die if we must
Grimmer than ugly more vicious than bad
Strife rules the land where God went mad

We ride towards the haunted West
Tomb of the meek, Hell for the rest
Where women are loose and gold abound
Death is the friend of the meanest band around

This is the desert where our legend began
A bottle of whisky for the life of a man
Grimmer than ugly more vicious than bad
Strife rules the land where God went mad
