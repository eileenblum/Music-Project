Killing for the hunt - hunting for the kill
Armed to the teeth with a wildcat's will

Killing for the hunt - hunting for the kill
Armed to the teeth with a wildcat's will
Survival of the fittest I have what it takes
To turn human beings into spiders and snakes

JÃ¤germeister JÃ¤germeister!
Nur eine grÃ¼ne Flasche
JÃ¤germeister JÃ¤germeister!
DaÃ ist meine Waffe!

Survival of the fittest I have what it takes
To turn human beings into spiders and snakes

In Schwarzwald I roam with a bottle in my pack
Hunting for hunters 'till the night falls black
Creep into my flask - see how much you can drink
A night out with me you're way too pissed to think

Killing for the hunt - hunting for the kill
Armed to the teeth with a wildcat's will

JÃ¤germeister JÃ¤germeister!
Nur eine grÃ¼ne Flasche
JÃ¤germeister JÃ¤germeister!
DaÃ ist meine Waffe!

Killing for the hunt... Killing for the hunt

The legendary cat in cape, hat and boots
Out to teach the hunters their bestial roots
Master and hunter I'll keep your party breath
Master and hunter, put your money on me
In the game of life and death

JÃ¤germeister JÃ¤germeister!
Nur eine grÃ¼ne Flasche
JÃ¤germeister JÃ¤germeister!
DaÃ ist meine Waffe!
