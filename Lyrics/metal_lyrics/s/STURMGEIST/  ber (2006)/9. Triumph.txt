Annihilate
The enemy
Gods of blood
Follow me

Black banner marble arch
A massive army up to march
Skulls to crush land to raid
Brothers attack victors invade

Soldiers of the nation
Answer Triumph's call
Without you we're nothing
With Triumph we're all

Might is right behead the snake
Evil beast a back to break
Gods of blood bless our war
We shall rule forever more

War awaits of soul and gun
Men march on towards the sun
Dawn of anger day of strife
Men march on go prove your life

Fight to conquer death without shame
Tribe of fire defend the flame
Hail the eagle lord of the sky
By Triumph win by Triumph die
