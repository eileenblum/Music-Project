Three years have I spent
Under the sea
Torpedoing the fleet
Of the enemy
I long for my Fraulein
And the gardens of Berlin
Commander has told me
We will win

Icebergs and whales
The Atlantic at night
I have seen the ocean
Away from the fight
Twelve ships have I pulled
Down into the deep
Leviathanâs hand
Had the widows weep

Our code has been cracked
They know where we are
A swarm of Allied mines
To wipe us off radar
Weâre twenty hungry boys
Set to burn or drown
Commander has told me
The only way is down
Nineteenfortythree
Fire is my destiny
Nineteenfortyfour
Weâre under total war
Nineteenfortyfive
Our last day alive
