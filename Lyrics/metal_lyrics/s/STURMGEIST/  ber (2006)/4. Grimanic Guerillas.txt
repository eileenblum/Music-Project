Grimanic Guerillas
Weâre back from the grave
Grimanic Guerillas
Come rolling like a wave
Grimanc Franc-tireurs
The young men that fell
Grimanic Marodeurs
Back from Royal Hell

Harry of Norway
Charlie of Sweden
Maggie of Denmark
Eliza of Eden

You rule our countries sceptre
In hand
You feed of your subjects and the
Fat of the land

Grimanic Guerillas
Weâre back from the grave
Grimanic Guerillas
Come rolling like a wave
Grimanc Franc-tireurs
The young men that fell
Grimanic Marodeurs
Back from Royal Hell

Harry of Norway
Charlie of Sweden
Maggie of Denmark
Eliza of Eden

We salute your Queens and
Illustrious Kings
We admire your castles and
Beautiful things

Weâre dead young men coming
Home from the war
Thereâs a party at your place open
The door
What do you mean you wonât
Let us in
Leave us in the cold because you
Didnât win

Grimanic Guerillas
Weâre back from the grave
Grimanic Guerillas
Come rolling like a wave
Grimanc Franc-tireurs
The young men that fell
Grimanic Marodeurs
Back from Royal Hell

You say we march
You say we all freeze
We say you starve
We say you walk out

Fathers under fire
The King never came
Remember us
We died in his name

Grimanic Guerillas
Weâre back from the grave
Grimanic Guerillas
Come rolling like a wave
Grimanc Franc-tireurs
The young men that fell
Grimanic Marodeurs
Back from Royal Hell
