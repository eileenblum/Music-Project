There is no place for me
In the land I loved
Fatherâs dead Motherâs gone
I will not come back

In every house they wait
For the guest that will not come
In every bed they wait
For the man who isnât home

Take it all make it yours
I have no more dreams
Love me now when Iâm gone
I wonât know how it ends

There is no place for me
In the land I loved
Fatherâs dead Motherâs gone
I will not go back
Little sister think of me
I tried to keep you safe
Fatherâs dead Motherâs gone
We wonât meet again

In every heart he is missed
The lover and the friend
In every warâs fire
The unknown soldierâs end

Little sister think of me
I tried to keep you safe
Fatherâs dead Motherâs gone
We wonât meet again

Bury me in the sea
Leave this world to the worms
Erase my name forget my face
We wonât meet again
