Aaaarrrghh!
New York London
Madrid Sharm el-Sheikh

Muhadjedin
You know who I mean
Killers for Allah
Our Achillesâ heel
Go down Hizbollah
Take what we feel
This is no crusade
We just want to kill

You shall greet the virgins
In the sky
In hellfire youâll die

Ready â charge!

Here comes Iron Hammer
Intervention from the sky
Here screams Iron Hammer
Wrath falling from up high

Here flies Iron Hammer
Intervention from the sky
Here goes Iron Hammer
Great Satan from up high

Your empire will fall
Our ways will prevail
Weâll free them all
Ayatollahs wail

The war you brought to us
We shall bring to you

Jihad in Tikrit
A target to delete
Terrorist attacks
All hellâs on your backs
Each man you behead
You shall pay with red
Each innocent you kill
Death to evil will
In hellfire youâll die
No need to tell you why

Fire at will!

Here comes Iron Hammer
Greet the virgins in the sky
Here screams Iron Hammer
In hellfire youâll die

Here comes Iron Hammer
Intervention from the sky
Here screams Iron Hammer
Great Satan from up high

Your empire shall fall
Our ways prevail
We shall free them all
Ayatollahs wail
