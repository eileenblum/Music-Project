Why did you do it
You bloody moron
Put an end to your problems
By killing innocents

Time cannot be turned
But shootings be averted
There is a way out of it
The gun is not that way

We could have protected you
If only you had asked
We could have saved you
But you chose destruction

Sturmgeist 89
Why did you do it

So you selfish bastard
In Hades or Valhalla
I'll iterate my question
Why did you do it

Now I'll be their villain
Sturmgeist 77
Because of your murders
The nine lives that you took

Natural selector
What a bunch of bull
Your victims were innocent
You chose them at random

This world is full of garbage
You didn't make it better
Never will a suicide
Resurrect the victims

We could have protected you
If only you had asked
We could have saved you
But you chose not to believe

Sturmgeist 89
Why did you do it

So you selfish bastard
In Hades or Valhalla
I'll demand an answer
Why did you do it

Sturmgeist 89
Why did you do it
