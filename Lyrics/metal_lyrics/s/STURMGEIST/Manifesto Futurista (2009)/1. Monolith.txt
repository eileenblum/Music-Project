Here is my anger
The beast within let loose
A tale of injustice
And revenge to be taken
Here is my anguish
The torment of rejection
Shivering nights
Loneliness and hatred

Fear has taken me
Ripped my back with hooks
There is one way to heal
To grow a skin of stone
Statues feel no pain
The misery of being
So have I been carved
By Destiny my master

Monolith - rise
When you fall I shall stand
Monolith - ascend
When you fail I stay strong

All this emotion
Caged in a corner
I let the fire rage
Ravaging its target
When help isn't there
You have to save yourself
Here is my desperation
The prey within let loose

Monolith - rise
When you fall I shall stand
Monolith - ascend
When you fail I stay strong

A sceptre of the Earth
A monument of will
I wish I could let go
Of the feelings that kill me
As a hermit I evolved
The alchemy of mind
Granite and not gold
That was what I got

Here is my anger
The beast within let loose
A tale of injustice
And revenge to be taken
Here is my anguish
The torment of rejection
Of nights shivering
Loneliness and hatred
