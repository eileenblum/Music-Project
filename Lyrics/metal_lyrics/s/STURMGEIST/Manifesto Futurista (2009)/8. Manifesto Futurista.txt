As the leader I beseech you
On behalf of the nation
Challenge coming glories
Break the records of the future

Your priests are engineers
Your churches built to speed
Make those motors cry
With the rage of our aeon

Manifesto futurista
Sempre piÃ¹ veloce
Movimento aggressivo
Insonnia febbrile

Racers chase the Ã¼berspeed
Along the road to victory
White peaks on the horizon
Will bow before the winner

In the stadium of progress
Cheering crowds go crazy
So great is your velocity
That even danger falls behind

Manifesto futurista
Sempre piÃ¹ veloce
Movimento aggressivo
Insonnia febbrile

Be faster than the others
Take us to the stars
We trust in your engines
The spearheads of our power

As the leader I address you
For the sake of our future
Make those motors scream
With the fury of our aeon
