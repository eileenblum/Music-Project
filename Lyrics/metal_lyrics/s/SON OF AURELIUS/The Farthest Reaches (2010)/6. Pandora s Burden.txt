A jar a box so harmless in appearance containing horrors unimaginable can't be dreamt up
By men all the secrets the power is what draws all to it
Not knowing, curious will be the cause of, our end, protected by an angel,
Molded by each of the gods we know not of her sorrow, her burden
All who venture quest for the prize this item box contains
Countless wars waged, over thousands sacrificing their bodies an endless sea of bones
Unsolved puzzles, one holds the answer a perfect beauty
Beauty bounded for all time.
