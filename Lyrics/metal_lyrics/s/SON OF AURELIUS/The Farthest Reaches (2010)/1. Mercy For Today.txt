[Music written by Cary Geare, words written by Josh Miller]

His name remembered forever a mortal man feared by a nation
His talents legendary, brilliant commander, unstoppable army
Sheath my blade and turn to walk away
Don't forget that I m doing you a favor
Let you live by showing mercy for today
This action goes against my behavior
Your hero your savior
Tactics unmatched, the father of strategy
Led his men to victory countless times
Against impossible odds, the sun will rise
Dawn will come, thousands armed and ready
Their blades reflecting light, as if to say this is the last day
Holding eager, awaiting command, endless sea of soldiers
Parted in the middle, ground is fresh, dew drops on grass
Sheath my blade and turn to walk away
Don't forget that I'm doing you a favor
Let you live by showing mercy for today
His action goes against my behavior
Your hero your savior
To all others known simply as
The destroyer killer of
Thousands victories and hundreds
Lost only once but great, were the casualties
Exiled for years, lead an army through the Alps
With great bizarre beasts
Epic in scale upon enemies he feasts
Gave birth to military, strategies great victories
Hannibal the general, took down the empire of Rome
Refused to be slain by, the hand of any foe
On his hand a ring, contains a poison
If the time should come, he would take his own life
The flesh may be dead, Legacy forever
Count the rings of Romans killed, life extinguished
Sheath my blade and turn and walk away
Don't forget that I m doing you a favor
Let you live by showing mercy for today
This action goes against my behavior
Your hero your savior
Hannibal is son of Carthage.
