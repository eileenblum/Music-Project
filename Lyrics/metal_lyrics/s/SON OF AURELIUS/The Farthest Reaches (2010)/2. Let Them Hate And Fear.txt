[Music written by Chase Fraser, words written by Josh Miller]

Son of a general, forced to accompany
Brought to witness atrocities such a young age
So much blood has been shed, twisted innocence slowly beginning to decay
Dressed as, a soldier only three years old
Gave birth, to my name destined to rule
Over Rome and all her children no foe rival shall stand in my way, assassinate the many conspiracies unfolding
They will learn of cruelty for enjoyment.
Perverse extravagance will lead to dismay
Admired by the masses tried to lead them all so well
Illness has plagued the mind soon it will all change
Banished, those who loved him condemned suicide
Deviant in nature, bodies intertwined
While they fuck and bleed and scream indeed to horrifying
Cesuras not enough and worshiped as a god
Beheaded statues, replacing it with his likeness
Rome is not enough the world must be his
A tyrant feared by millions, sacrifices thousands daily
Whoring out his siblings enjoying their pain
Mass public executions, imaginative creative
Taking pride, considered innovative
Accounts will label him completely deranged insane
Let them hate and fear me, for I will live forever
I am all men as I am no man therefore I am a god
His behavior really sickens, any that have ever witnessed
I will live forever, his name, live forever in infamy
His mind, and his thoughts are disgusting.
