Seeking the gift a hero must travel into the darkness
Facing the gorgon serpents atop of her head
Fire glowing, the last thing, any of us shall see.
Frozen forever none have defeated an endless
Labyrinth of soldiers, all different poses
As if they not know of her power
Cold lifeless stone this is different
Armed with a weapon given to, him by the gods
Cape makes him vanish so quick, sandals take flight
Shield as reflective as water at night
Now he must face her no turning back never staring
Directly at her reflection is harmless strike the
Witch black blood mists, the air
Serpents still slither hair, head hits the ground
Eyes, remain open so wide.
