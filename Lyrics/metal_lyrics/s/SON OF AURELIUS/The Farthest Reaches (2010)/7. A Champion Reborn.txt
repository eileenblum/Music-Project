[Music written by Cary Geare, words written by Josh Miller]

Taken bound and shackled
Sold as a fucking slave
Stripped of earthly belongings
Old how you should behave

Force to, trained to, kill other men
Just to entertain
Wealthy and rich, so called "royalty"
Taking pleasure in pain

Blood spilt, and set to appease, there gods
Weapons are stained, gruesome torture inflicted
Only the strong Remain

Masks worn, inject, fear in there hearts
Of Those worthless and meant to die
Never did they even have a chance

The mob loves witnessing death
Entertain them
All have paid to see, spilt blood what a sight
God and Cesar are pleased

Flesh cut, bones break, screams of the fallen with echo
The Colosseum pulses with applause
Glory for the last one standing

Mass graves await the rest
Freedom waits for the champion
Fallen fed to the beast
Slice down waves of, other warriors

Beast and giant alike
The one, the great, whole crowd chants his name
Victories are unmatched

Commodus, a champion re-born
Gladiator of Rome
