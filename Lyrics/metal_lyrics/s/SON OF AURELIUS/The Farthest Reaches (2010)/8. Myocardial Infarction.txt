[Music written by Max Zigman and Spencer Edwards, lyrics written by Josh Miller]

Blood supply
Interrupted
Arteries blocked
constricted
Oxygen shortage
Will soon be your end
Tightness, pressure, squeezing due to ischemia
Lack of blood oxygen supply
Pain in left arm
Loss of consciousness is ending you
Stress and physical exertion
Often the cause too much for the weak organ malfunction
The plasma
Abruptly the end comes
Cardiac arrest occurred
Shortness of breath and nausea
Vomiting
Anxiety
Palpitations
It's hard to stand
Confusion and fear as life ends.
