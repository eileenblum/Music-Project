A mind that's been stretched to newer frames
can never return to it's original state,
and in the sensation that you feel,
the one that comes and fades,
is a perfect greatness lying in wait.
Freedom from impulse
has never been required more
than it is in relation to the state we're in,
and it will take so much more
than progressive metal can hope to achieve
With all of its intention and spacey themes.
Please, come with me.
And I don't speak out of arrogance or failure to believe
in a collective conscious being
but when I see such a heavy focus on imagery
it takes me and sends me reeling
into a sadness deeper than the soundest sleep.
All I ask for is an unbiased listen,
and I will not pretend to be an authority
on anything I haven't studied
let alone felt or heard or seen.
If I have not been, I won't speak.
