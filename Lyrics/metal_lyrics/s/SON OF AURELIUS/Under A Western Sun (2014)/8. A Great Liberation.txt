Gazing aimlessly into the night
While the rest of us
Restless and wrestling with our thoughts
Attempt to flee the nest

And build our ruminations
On pillars of the mind
Whose strength will grant
Liberation from doubt and pain

Dismay will no longer be our name
Instead the phantom spends
It's pensive evenings in meditation
Besting temptations of fear and dread

Awake, without hesitation
And desperate to render some use in the day

Today, he speaks aloud

He speaks aloud
He speaks aloud to make sure he's breathing
