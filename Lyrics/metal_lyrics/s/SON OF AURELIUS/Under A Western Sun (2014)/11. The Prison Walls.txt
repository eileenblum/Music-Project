Fear becomes them and suits them well
as they flee from this new and abundant terror
that ravages the land with a flaming hand
and lays waste to any brave enough to face them.
With grinning visage, they embrace the horror of the ants beneath their feet and feed. Those trained to defend against such a horrendous act have led their men to higher elevations, and I am all that's left. I must find friends that are also as destitute to bring retribution to this mighty unknown and vicious enemy to every living soul.
We must destroy them, or in the struggle be destroyed.
Shaken by grief and void of all moral support, we've retreated and lost all that we've worked so hard to hold on to.
The wall has fallen.
A year has gone and we must take back what's ours.
We've sent a force larger than ever before, and we know
that they will drive them back beyond the walls.
After all was said and done, with 250,000 gone
to bring them down and claim our home,
less than 200 returned.
At least their loss helped ease the shortage of food
for the rest of us.
