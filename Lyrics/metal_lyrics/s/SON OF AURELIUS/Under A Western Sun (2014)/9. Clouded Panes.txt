[I.]

Beneath a distant sky
of a city deprived of day or night,
I try to find a reason for the rhymes
that echo in my mind
and speak to me of times
when we could get by with skinning our knees.
Whispered out reminders that cloud my memories
identify the line that divides
the horizon from the tide.
As my eyes begin to open
I am pulled inside and I am frightened.
Will I slip into the sea of life
before I realize that I have never been me?
Who am I? Is this life really even mine?
Only time will grant the wisdom I require
to know you as myself and be rid of your presence forever.

[II.]

Filling the void with stolen spoils of the unknown
to all but the ones most important.
I and all my kind will die as lies.
Birthed of a body born of the old earth and,
older now than ever, I know that I am empty.
