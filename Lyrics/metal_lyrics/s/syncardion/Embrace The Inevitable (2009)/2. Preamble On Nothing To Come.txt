Through our fear we can't be
It is here no more we
Nothing but, love for you
Leaves a cut, hate you too
Still unreal, this big gap
Needs to heal, wounds will scab

You, are the prototype
True, just a beautiful sight
I froze, you are the drug and the overdose
My, heart ablazed
Blind, for the masquerade

Heartfelt love brought a heart failure near
We supernovaad here
Pictures, smiles and fears
Make, your absence clear
Chase, a dream in which i am the smile on your face

Trying, to understand
Us, so that i might transcend
The spiteful passion in which we can't steer
We supernovaad here

Such beauty, that for a minute
Gone, in a split second
Preamble on nothing to come
You again in my view
Looks like it but she isn't you
Wish she was wish she died
Ith her your image inside my mind

Such beauty, that for a minute
Gone, in a split second
Preamble on nothing to come

Through our fear, we can't be
It is here, no more we
Nothing but, love for you
Leaves a cut, hate you too
Still unreal, this big gap
Needs to heal, wounds will scab
Preamble, on nothing
But still though, you make me...
