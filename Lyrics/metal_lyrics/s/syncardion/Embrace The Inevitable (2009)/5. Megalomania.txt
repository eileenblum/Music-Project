People, hear ye hear ye
I am great 'cause i am me
You surely must agree
I am i, so you can't be
The chosen one, behold me
Here is he who holds the key
To, and i guarantee
Everything as you will see
By the grace of me, you and your words, here exist
So i can only agree, on that i am,
When you call me a narcissistic solipsist

Into him i transform
Obviously he is my norm
For purpose i was born
For him i'll take on each storm
The mirror shows his form
The sight gets me really warm
Obscenely i perform love with him,
My hardest porn

I am the only mind that exists
Creating is part of my bliss
I feel pain you act pain
Not bounded by any law
I killed God, now we are Ra
Shining bright as Vega
The Alpha and Omega

Our being lacks a flaw
This self is spectacular
Never shall we withdraw
We are megalomania

By the grace of me, you and your words, here exist
So i can only agree, on that i am,
When you call me a narcissistic solipsist
So no worry when, as for i create your fear,
Over it, for the fun, i now kill you here
