First strike, flash blinds my eyes
Is this a prelude, of sinister light
No words to define, my life isn't mine
Hell lifts me up, nowhere to hide
They wanted me to fight,
But fear overtakes my limbs and troubles my sight

I thought i came prepared,
Cold sweat breaks out, never been this scared
All does feel so hollow, what cause do i follow
My mate takes a blow, is he next to join the endless row
Ass i press i feel the easy flow of death from his neck go

And there the snow turned red
Anonymous, we fight this lost fight,
For God and country we die
Anonymous, is the God we hail to,
He is absent on both sides
Anonymous, is the end of my life, a number in between lies
Anonymous, my duty will last as the past will trouble my mind

Straighten my head and point my gun
Trigger makes the bullet come
Speeds to somebody else's son
Makes a letter go out to his mom
Hereby we inform thy one
That number 666 is gone
We assume that you will overcome
A moment i think of all the fun
While telling, my own daughter and son
The bloodshed, has made their father numb
