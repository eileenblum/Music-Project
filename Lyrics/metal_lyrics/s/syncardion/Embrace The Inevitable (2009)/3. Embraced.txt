I brace myself, for i'm by disease embraced
Fearing, fleeing, i see, is a waste
For endmost days, because now i disavow
Feeling, seeing, being, existing here and now
I'm...far from the here and now
I'm...far from the here and
Now present time, i dread coming judgement day
Rebel, dispel, farewell to, this here where i can't stay

Death, scares me to death, for eternity i plea
Sour, unfairly i'm condemned, all goes on without me

Goodbye my love
You i won't see
My breath turns off
Until we meet
How when and where i feel complete
Please take good care
Life has an end

Here, with peace i'm embraced in our last hours
Where, wondrously, the sweet tastes more sweet, after the
Sour, is not the loss, the end that is me
Free, where as from dust i was made and dust i shall be
