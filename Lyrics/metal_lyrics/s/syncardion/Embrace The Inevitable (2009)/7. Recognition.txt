You are no more, gone is your core,
Never been so frail before
No more routine, what does me mean,
When i am for you unseen

Now i condemn my own life span,
Afraid if you die, i can
What can i give, i'm on a cliff,
Now that i feel i can't live

For you when all is gone
This passion turns to warfare
This time, i am blind, but aware of you
I see your apparition

You are no more, gone is your core,
Never been so frail before
No more routine, what does me mean,
When i am for you unseen
Now i condemn my own life span,

Afraid if you die, i can what can i give,
I'm on a cliff, now that i feel i can't live

Aaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!
Polarised
Beyond reason
This high treason

Never your smiling face
Never those dirty ways
Never ballet for two never who, i? no, you!
Never your endless grace
Never we can embrace
Never that thing you do
Never means this all is...through

My sorrow drowns the remembrance of you
I shouldn't also run out of breath
Grateful i am for the you that i knew
Your part in me i could keep from this death
For me, i breath in your infinite beauty
This time i can see and keep alive
What beauty deserves,
Recognition
