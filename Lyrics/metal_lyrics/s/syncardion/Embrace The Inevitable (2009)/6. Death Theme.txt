The regime that oppresses in struggle for the crown
Freedom of hart is being weighed down
Upholding of corruption through law
The free voice restricted by an iron claw

Tough, to fight against such power
On your own it will devour
Your strength. your will. this hour. your life
Settle, in fear and helpless anger
Starve for the big commander
Bring flowers to the power
And hail

The fight for existence between government jaws
Being what you are for another man's cause
In the blood red streets the rumour starts
There's another world behind this farce

Rebel, so many times you've warned her
For treason death becomes her
Your daughter's being slaughtered
Why hide?!
Pain, will bring you all together
Let pain fuel all that anger
A death-theme to the regime
You fight

Scream death to the power
That treats us as prowlers
They who take and devour life which is ours
Scream death to the power
That treats us as prowlers
That takes and devours the life which is ours

In the blood red streets the rumour starts
There's another world behind this farce
