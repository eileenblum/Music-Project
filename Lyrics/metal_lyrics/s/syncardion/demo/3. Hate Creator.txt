I see the pain youâre going through
You think that I donât belong here
Believe me I know, I see through you
I read your eyes, I smell your fear.

I sense the hate that burns in you
I know itâs there, Itâs my creation
Itâs not my goal to destroy you
I just donât care, Iâm feeding your frustration

I am the hate thatâs killing you
I know I am a thorn in your eye
I know itâs hell you damn me to
I am everything you deny

Despise, the sight of my being
Realize, youâre hate makes you weak
Being nice, while youâre inside is screaming
I rise and this tears your mask

Childish is your aversion
I see through it and break your mould
Grab your believes and let them fall
Iâll string you up, Iâll make the call

Oblivious you will drown self-awareness
Dependent on hate that I drug you with
Dislike me, It will show you the abyss
Maybe in death you can let it be

I am the hate you want
The thing you canât
The thing you can not live without

I am your rotten sight
The Anti-Christ
To be defined by wrong or right
