Painful, is the struck down freedom and faceless morality
A Big tool, which makes me numb
Chained mind, because of digestible standard that looks like a fallacy
They oppress, the truth that burns inside

It are my instincts that I left behind
They dispel all fears causing enlightenment of the mind

Assured, I talk the talk and walk the walk
Iâm no more, bound by fear
This is, a reckoning of self and soul
Now my sight, creates might that burns inside

Itâs hard to see through the artificial haze
Made by mankind obscuring the mind
The denial of power that burns inside
Has made so much victims but now is the time
To open my eyes
Open my mind

Fuck them
I am my own
Where I could
I did exclude
The void that held me down
Now I can see
Iâm free
To be
I feel it burning inside
