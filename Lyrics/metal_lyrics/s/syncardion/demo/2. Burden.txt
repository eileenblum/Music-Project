Shivering thoughts haunt my stripped off conscience
The brick wall around a memory steadily fragments
Uncontrolled visions make me feel tense
This must be the consequence, Of being fearful having confessions

Itâs Clear Fear You
I Fear Fear Me
My Fear Hear Me now

I walked away left my worries far behind
All this time they were buried there alive
Didnât take notice of the burden inside
Afraid of deeds in which I wasnât right, Straighten my back, no more I will hide

I Choose Choose You
Break Loose Choose Me
Cut Loose Hear Me now

I, Will dig in my history, To unfold the misery, Of my bottled up burden
There, I will tear down the wall, Take a look behind it all, My confessional
I, Shall pull them up again, All the way to the top again, Feel them for what they really are

I Choose Choose You
Break Loose Choose Me
Cut Loose Hear Me

I See See You
Itâs Me See Me
To Be Feel Free now 

Iâm breaking chains I will here face my lies
Throwing out all my bottled up restraint cries
At the end there will lay insight
There is light to be found in this fight, Face the fears of my life tonight
