What is this all ?
Who am I ?
Who are you ?
What do we live for ?

Where are we going to ?
Why are we here ?
Why do we feel ?
What do we feel ?

Why does it smell so cold ?
How do we know we exist ?
What is existing ?
Why is this road so mysterious ?

What are we fighting for ?
What is the point ?
Why are we so small in time ?
Why are we so small in space ?
Should we know it ?

Where is my land ?
Why do I feel so far away ?
What is far ?
What is close ?

Who can we trust ?
What can we trust ?
Why is autumn so deep ?
Why do I fall into winter chill ?

Why is spring flooding us with so much life within ?
Who does my soul belong to ?

Who is the one ?

Why does music feed our mind and heart ?
Why do these eyes kill me ?
Why do we love ?
Will we die without knowing ?

Is the meaning of my life in your eyes ?
Or is it in your heart ?
What are the answers ?
Is there one answer ?
