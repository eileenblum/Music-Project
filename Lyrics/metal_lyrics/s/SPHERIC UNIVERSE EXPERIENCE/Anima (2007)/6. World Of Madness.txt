Sleeping without a dream
Destruction of a brainstorming
You think that you are strong
But to this place you belong

A mind violation
A cruel recognition
My hands are trembling
My brain you're freezing

A heartbreaking decision
Makes you look so anxious
A choice or maybe a dilemma
You're alone in your amnesia

A mind violation
A cruel recognition
My hands are trembling
My brain you're freezing

When no words can explain
The deepest sensation
Which penetrates into your soul
And takes you away from your dreams
The only thing you can see
Is a world of madness....
A world of madness ...

If you blame me for needing you
I'll plead guilty for the rest of my life

If you tell me your feelings are true
I'd rather be stabbed by my hand

When no words can explain
The deepest sensation
Which penetrates into your soul
And takes you away from your dreams
The only thing you can see
Is a world of madness....
A world of madness ...
