Living, feeling, realizing
Clouds, nights and lights call
This rainy air I'm breathing
Is deeply forging my very soul

The eyes I got lost in, this voice I movingly hear
The doubtful and aching hope I hide
Those instinctive fears I'm helplessly carrying within
Quietly shape my true inside

Quest is on
I cannot die without knowing why
I feel the limit is not the sky

Day will come
Whatever the tears I'll have to shed
I must reach the peace in my head

The intimate need to find oneself
Fatally settles down in each conscious heart
The brainstorming search to find the meaning of life and death
Requires Science and Art

Quest is on
I cannot die without knowing why
I feel the limit is not the sky

Day will come
Whatever the tears I'll have to shed
I must reach the peace in my head

The night wind smelling that entered my brain
Is my greatest weapon against mental strain
All the elements gravitating around me
Deeply build what I am and what I will be

Quest is on
I cannot die without knowing why
Getting closer and closer
I feel the limit is not the sky

Day will come
Whatever the tears I'll have to shed
I must reach the peace in my head

Get high
