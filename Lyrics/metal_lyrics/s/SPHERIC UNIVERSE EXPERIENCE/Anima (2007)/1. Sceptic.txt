Crossing the rivers of a shadow land by night
Led by my eternal black desire
Around my sorrow, torches of wizards twist and fight
The night is falling and evil spirits rise up

Search â for pain , love â for pain
For the mistress and her mages

Why can I feel â Fears in your eyes
Take my hand I will see â your beauty in skies
Eternally â I will protect your night
âCause without you I'm mad of
Sceptic tears

Deep within the darkness of celestial legacy
I'm looking for the unknown Angel kiss
The Lords of madness have spelled my atrocity
The curse of sceptic reasons can be seen on my face

Why can I feel â Fears in your eyes
Take my hand I will see â your beauty in skies
Eternally â I will protect your night
âCause without you I'm mad of
Sceptic tears

So many tears â have been lasting so long
My soul burning in dreams
My heat is yours for infinity

Why can I feel â Fears in your eyes
Take my hand I will see â your beauty in skies
Eternally â I will protect your night
âCause I am mad
Of sceptic tears
