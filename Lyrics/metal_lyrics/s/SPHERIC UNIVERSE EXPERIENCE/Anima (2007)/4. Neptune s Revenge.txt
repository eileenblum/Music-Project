Darkness on the sea - a cyclone on a ship
Damned navigators â this faith you won't keep ...
Terror in the sky - lightning strikes the men
Who challenge my traps, my force and my brain!

âThe eye of the storm is my home
The shores of the stream are my bonesâ

Submerged by the waves - fallen into the abyss
My revenge is here and you can't escape it... (no escaping)

I am the sea
I have the power
I am the god
I'm your disaster

Fear! Pain! Harsh! Strain!

You can't see me
You have a master
You are alone
You taste my anger

Haze is dully lifting but it's almost the end
Of your mystical journey, now stare at my eyes
You can't control me â there is no compromise
The battle is over - got your ruins in my hands! (in my hands)
