Seing the world with a logical eye
Leading reflections about what, where and why for our destiny

Working hard on timespaces subjects
Can you reveal the darkest ending universe might expect?
Mankind is now weak against its own fate.

We're unconscious
Desperate by nature
We'll face our own tragedy

Soldier of science, product of evolution
Men's love for war like a self destruction

Humanity's death may come from your brain

We're unconscious
Desperate by nature
We'll face our own tragedy

Thundering inside your head, your vision doesn't see us dead
We all deserve to be blamed, but not ready to be six feet under.
Thundering inside your brain, your conscience see us like undead
We are dying by ourselves, but you possess a key,
The key we're hoping for.

Search deeply into your soul
Enough love and mercy
Your skills, your dignity
Should made us grow up
Don't be unforgiven...
Maybe you could save something else...

Thundering inside your head, your vision doesn't see us dead
We all deserve to be blamed, but not ready to be six feet under.
Thundering inside your brain, your conscience see us like undead
We are dying by ourselves, but you possess a key,
The key we're hoping for

The key we're hoping for
