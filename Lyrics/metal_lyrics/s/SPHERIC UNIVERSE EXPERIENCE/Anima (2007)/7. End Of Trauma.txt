Here I am for this observation
Unable to trust myself again
I have to take a ticket for passion
But all what happens is called pain

I don't want to remember
âCause all my life I've been loving her
But the only way to live
Is to turn the page again

It's a new beginning
The End Of Trauma
Life can go on rolling
No more tears or drama

Oh I'm not afraid
To live again
This is the end
Of my trauma

That great story has an ending
But this one is for her
There is âyouâ, there is âmeâ
But there will be no âusâ anymore

I gave you the time to forget your pride
I gave you the time to rebuild from the start
But time is not enough
And I won't lose myself in my heart

It's a new beginning
The End Of Trauma
Life can go on rolling
No more tears or drama

Oh I'm not afraid
To live again
This is the end
Of my trauma

This is the end of my trauma , and the beginning of yours
Of yours!

From resentment to revenge
There's only one step
I won't go this way
âCause now the game is over, âCause now the game is over

From dream to reality
There is just one night
I won't sleep anymore
âCause now the game is over, âCause now the game is over

It's a new beginning
The End Of Trauma
Life can go on rolling
No more tears or drama

Oh I'm not afraid
To live again
This is the end
Of my trauma
