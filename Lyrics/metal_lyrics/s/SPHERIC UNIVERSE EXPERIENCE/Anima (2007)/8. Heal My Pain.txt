Once again as far as I can see
It hurts my brain, my mind gets empty
Blinding rage, self recognition
Unable to lead my revolution

I'm sorry you don't make me laugh
I'm trying to follow my path
I'm starving, searching my freedom
Destroying this queenless kingdom

Heal My Pain , Pain

Heal my pain
Don't want to feel my soul leaving me
I'm your man
I won't forgive your lack of pity
Heal my pain
I'm your man

See me, feel me
Like you've never done before
Trust me, believe me
And now take care
When I say I choose to make you pay
Cause that's your turn to heal my pain

Not guilty of being your son
Forgive me but I'll get the job done
Life in sin must not frighten me
From my hand you don't deserve to escape

I'm sorry you don't understand
I'm trying to blow up the end
I'm starving searching a window
Destroying the most evil widow

When I say I'm cold, I'm mad
My blood is freezing
I decide to reach my oldest dream
I can kill
My remorses will be late
But I won't miss my target
If I choose to make you pay

Heal my pain
Don't want to feel my soul leaving me
I'm your man
I won't forgive your lack of pity
Heal my pain
