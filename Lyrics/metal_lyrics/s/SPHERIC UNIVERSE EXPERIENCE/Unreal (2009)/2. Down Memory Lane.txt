[Music by Fred Colombo, Lyrics by Franck Garcia]

When I am waling down the street
When I try to sleep at night
I think of this land under my feet
I don't see the light

I always feel I have been someone else before
The mysterious other life in me took its toll
I'm feeling music was making me strong and tall
Giving so much to so many people

Wanna be that other man again
Need to feel my mind not going insane
Wanna be that rock star again
And take a trip down Memory Lane

So many landscapes appear in my memory
My previous me has been around the World
Singing, blossoming and now haunting me
How live a life remembering a better one?

Wanna be that other man again
Need to feel my mind not going insane
Wanna be that rock star again
And take a trip down Memory Lane...
