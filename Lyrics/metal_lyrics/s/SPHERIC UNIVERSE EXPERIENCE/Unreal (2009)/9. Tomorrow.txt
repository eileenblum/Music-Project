[Music by Fred Colombo, Lyrics by Franck Garcia]

In my city surrounded by Mystery Of Forest..
Trees and murmurs and lights as far as I can see
In my World where the infinitely large coexists with the smallest
In my house dark truth comes even in bed and haunts me

Years of nightmares have ruined my heart, my brain and my will
To live another day and discover by myself
Wonders and tragedies have decided to appear to me still
As if I were their entry gate before realness

I swear no one, no one knows what it means, what it feels
To be assailed by the future, as soon as you fall asleep
No day is new, no wings to fly, no way to free my mind
Nothing I try, nothing I do can stop these incessant signs

Tomorrow... Please leave me alone
I don't want to chase you away
I just wanna live you on my own
And feel excited about a new day

Tomorrow will never lie to me
As it tells me its truth the night before
They say there's no telling,
What tomorrow will bring
But I cannot believe them anymore

I am so afraid to close my eyes
I'll see what will happen and how
So many tragic events I'll never prevent
These nightmares make me feel guilty and lament

No one can endure
Such nerve-racking experience
No surprise in my life, no way out, no cure
Only frightening nights which lead me to madness

Tomorrow... Please leave me alone
I don't want to chase you away
I just wanna live you on my own
And feel excited about a new day

Tomorrow will never lie to me
As it tells me its truth the night before
They say there's no telling,
What tomorrow will bring
But I cannot believe them anymore...
