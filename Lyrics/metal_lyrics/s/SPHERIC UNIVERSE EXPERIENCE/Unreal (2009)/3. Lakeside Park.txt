[Music by Fred Colombo, Lyrics by Franck Garcia]

These words are torturing my mind
I cannot see because I am blind
What did they do to your eyes?
To be so cruel with my life

They control your brain and your hands
But I don't want to hurt you
If like a blind puppet you dance
I have to stop and kill you

"Give me the force to kill,
Forgive me if you live."

Darkness is invading my life
Omnipresence of horror in the Lakeside Park

Fear prevents me from killing
And gives you a reason to hurt me
I cannot wait for the moment when I die
Will you survive? Or will I?

Anyway one of us will suffer
Because of the absence of the other
You are trying to do something
And we will die - Together in this field.

Darkness is invading my life
Omnipresence of horror in the Lakeside Park
Atrocities are filling your eyes
Omnipresence of hatred in the Lakeside Park

"We are standing together in the dark,
Remembering these moments we had."

If tonight is the end of my life
You will die!
If tonight is the end of my life
You will die!

"Give me the force to kill,
Forgive me if you live."

Darkness is invading my life
Omnipresence of horror in the Lakeside Park
Atrocities are filling your eyes
Omnipresence of hatred in the Lakeside Park
