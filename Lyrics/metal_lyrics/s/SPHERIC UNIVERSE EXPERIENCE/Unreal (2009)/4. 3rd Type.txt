[Music by Fred Colombo, Lyrics by John Drai and Franck Garcia]

New hope inside our minds
A constellation far behind
Explorers from another kind
They just realized what they found

"Among the stars and the Universe,
We are from planet Earth."

Communications established
Between the beauty and the beast
We're so different, but in a way
We have found something to say

Could we share the truth?
Could we share the light?
Could we live together with 3rd type?
Do you feel the power?
Do you see the answer?
A dream of one nation with no fight.

live for giving
Live for sharing
It's our destiny.
Give all for free
Share it smiling
For eternity.

Free your mind now
There's no more law
Just you and Human
You have to go
Another echo
Believe in your way!

Could we share the truth?
Could we share the light?
Could we live together with 3rd type?
Do you feel the power?
Do you see the answer?
A dream of one nation with no fight.

beyond differences
Beyond all beliefs
Beyond galaxies and satellites
We Can Share The Truth
We Can Share The Light
We Can Live Together With 3rd Type...
