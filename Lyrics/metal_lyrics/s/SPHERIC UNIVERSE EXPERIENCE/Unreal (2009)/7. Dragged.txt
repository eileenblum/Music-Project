[Music &amp; lyrics by Franck Garcia]

He was my other soul
He spoke the other words
He defied Mother Earth
He feared nothing at all

One day I felt half empty
As I sensed him disappear
I still don't know why
His craft never came back

Dark sea mist brought a blank
My Twin fell without a trace
Sensations like a blood link
My brother fell into space

I thought our destinies were one
Inseparable, indivisible..
Now compelled to speak to no one
Inexplicable, Invisible.

He decided to challenge the lies
He decided to know through his eyes
(No matter how high..)
My twin got dragged above the sky
My half got dragged above the why
My blood got dragged above the cry
Emptiness - called him back.
Something bellow earth and water
Dragged by brother - down under...

"I am left alone
A helpless frightened half soul
What the hell happened to my beloved brother?"

My mind is now alone with itself
Eaten away by questions and fear
Could he know? Should I have known?
Why does no one know?

I feel the Triangle calling me
I need to get closer to him
Regardless of danger and fear
My love was as deep as the sea
That took him away from me

He decided to challenge the lies
He decided to know through his eyes
(No matter how high..)
My twin got dragged above the sky
My half got dragged above the why
My blood got dragged above the cry
Emptiness - called him back.
Something bellow earth and water
Dragged by brother - down under...
