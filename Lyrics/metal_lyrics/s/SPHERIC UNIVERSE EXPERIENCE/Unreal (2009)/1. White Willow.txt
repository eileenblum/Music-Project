[Music by Fred Colombo, Lyrics by John Drai and Franck Garcia]

In this dark, mystical night
She was driving on this road
She and the car began to fight
She died all alone in the cold

Only her spirit's still alive
And here on Earth she's got a mission
A ghost appearance for a while
Now we are all under her protection

"See me, feel me, help me, trust me
watch me, take me, save me, trust me!"

can't you see my shadow?
Can't you feel my pain?
I am the White Willow
And I will try to save your life

Come into my light
Stay and you will find
The death is so bright
Stay into my mind

Can't you see my shadow?
Can't you feel my pain?
I am the White Willow
And I will try to save your life...
