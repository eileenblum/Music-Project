[Music by Fred Colombo, Lyrics by Franck Garcia]

So many seasons since darkness stole her forever
So few reasons to suddenly fall into the never
I asked myself - Where The Hell could I find her?
Or catch any glimpse whatsoever?

Then
She came one night
But I did not see, I just felt her
I need her light

I feel the soul of my kindred spirit
As though she was trying to get my mind at ease
So close and yet so far away
Come to me, please..

(Oh my Ghost..)

Your soul is lost
Somewhere in never ending black
Whatever the cost
I will not miss your next comeback

I was so afraid that time also kills my memory of you
But now I know lost souls remain somewhere, because..

You came one night
But I did not see, I just felt you
I need your light

I feel the soul of my kindred spirit
As though she was trying to get my mind at ease
So close and yet so far away
Come to me, please..

Just give me one kiss
Your shadow stays in front of me
A Godsent from above
My love
Just give me your lips
Your eyes show eternity
A light behind the gate

Of fate...
