We say hello, a smile and goodbye
A drop of tears in the ocean,
Now I'm sad to see you cry
I feel the bad taste of temptation.
Your face always in my mind
And your name whispered by the wind
You're everywhere, everytime
But you're not with me.

My sweet love, I'm falling
In your eyes, the treasure is given
Your wings reflect your beauty,
A diamond on this buterrfly.

I sing a song for you today
And I stare at you now, yeah.
I try to think my words could break
The space between us.

Is there a sign of hope
In this world, I don't even know ?
Disconection, revelation,
Echoes of the stars.
But in this Spheric Universe
Love is inVerse...

The blood of love, the meaning of this day
Dressing the wounds of life
Unhoped for and relighted,
The flame revives

Terrific dread lets me thunderstuck
Face up with the unknown
But the fate is winning on your own faith
Now this is my pain.

Then you are my constellation
You are shining more and more
There's a voice in my head
I will never be afraid

Is there a sign of hope
In this world, I don't even know ?
Disconection, revelation,
Echoes of the stars.
But in this Spheric Universe
Love is inVerse...
