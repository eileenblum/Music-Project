[music: V. BenaÃ¯m, lyrics: F. Colombo]

Like a futuristic city
Scattered with hundreds of lights
The burning box seems to be
In an endless creation process tonight

All these things from outside
Are about to blow up inside

Images filled with noise and cries
So scaring to look in the eyes

So many sounds are going through my mind
So many ways too hard to find
Feelings, worlds, visions and chains
Are meeting in that cerebral strain

On its hard and long road
Leading to a priceless serenity
There are obstacles and heavy loads
That it will have to fight and carry

Is that box as solid as it seems?
Is it able to bear such saturation?

All these things it has inside
Are about to blow up outside

I'm afraid of losing myself
In the complex paths of my brain

So many sounds are going through my mind
So many ways too hard to find
Notes, words, pleasures and pain
Are meeting in my saturated brain

Tell me
How to contain
All in one brain

Help me
Alleviate
Me and my fate

Who has the key
To make what's full
Become empty

Where is the light
That would make what's heavy
Preciously light
