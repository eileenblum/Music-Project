Lost in the celestial vault
My curious, frightened, bewitched eyes
Breathing that wind so cold
Fall into night sky...

Looking for mystery now
Within this dark and immense image
Wondering how
Universe nature can be so strange...

Energy sparkling 'round me
I feel full of dreams to fulfil
Moonlight awakens instincts
If I loose myself you will find me...

Let your heart and your soul
Follow me in that mysterious trip...

Energy sparkling 'round me
I feel full of dreams to fulfil
Moonlight awakens instincts
If you lose yourself I will find you...
