[Part I: Solitude.]

Watch her dance
As ashadow through the mirror
Sand Lady disappeared with wind

Empty eyes
In an unknown land we are standing
In screaming pain we will dance too

I cannot see beyond the sunrise
I cannot feel my tears when I cry
I cannot hear my scream when you die
Blinded by fear, frightened by light

Look around you, nothing remains
Only traces of cerebral strain
Through the mirror there's nothing there
Through the reason voice of despair

No one can live forever more
Infected by victims desires
Blind conscience leads the babies' cries

Blind conscience leads the babies' cries

Calling (the one who's never come)
Crying (for what you've never done)
Falling (in love with whom you know)
Bleeding (your spirit full of blood)

There's a secret door
Close your eyes and you will see what you did
These voices which echo in your mind aggravate your sorrow
Now you're just one, your hands stained with blood, your eyes stained with horror

Calling (the one who's never come)
Crying (for what you've never done)
Falling (in love with whom you know)
Bleeding (your spirit full of blood)

[Part 2: Reminiscence.]

Liberty scream
Is what I need
To stop the visions that haunt my dreams

Is it fiction or
Reality
I wonder why I cannot sleep with it

Through the silence
Of a winter night
I'm walking alone on the way that watches her dying

Reminisnences
Consume my mind
Where the winds blow is where I'll die

Where the winds blow is where all the things that existed go
