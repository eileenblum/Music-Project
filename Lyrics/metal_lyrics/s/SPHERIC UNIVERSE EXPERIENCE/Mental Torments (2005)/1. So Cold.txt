[music: F. Colombo / V. BenaÃ¯m, lyrics: J. Drai]

The cold breath in this winter night
Head in sky you see our satellite
You'd like to be a bird for a flight
And you want to share your thoughts with the light

Without force, courage and ideas
Across the bridge, you see her reflect
And you wonder what it is
She's the moon and you have to protect

"As these boats which glide over the ocean
Everynight, close to the sea, the moon gets under way
And her brightness follows her, like a quiet net
Where the blue stars gets caught one by one"

So cold, into the sea
The Sun chased by the Moon
So cold, it's hard to be
Alone this afternoon

From here you see the moonlight
Some people talk about the darkside
Over there appears the earthlight
But you'd rather discover hidden side

"It was, in a brownnight
On the yellowed steeple
The Moon
Like a dot on an i"

So cold, into the sea
The Sun chased by the Moon
So cold, it's hard to be
Alone this afternoon
