[Lyrics by Franck Garcia]

We used we would be together
To live this gift was a beautiful favour
But I need to forget that all
She is the trigger of my fall

She was mine whether I like it or not
It was fine - the pleasure was really hot
But in my dreams she revives
and in my nightmares, damn, she dies

Those fatal rings unchain my wrists
Causing the start of all my twists
I cry...

You nailed my heart to the cross
If I don't know the road to chaos
The gravedigger is waiting for me
You nail my hear to the cross
If I cannot see the fullmoon gloss
The deathbringer is waiting for me

Now I no long hear her wonderful voice
My legs are walking of the bloody choice
If I cant heal my frictions
I can do very bad actions

She offered me the silver key of love
But she didn't know she would fly above
It's too late - I heard the bell
Behind the door, there is my hell

Those fatal rings unchain my wrists
Causing the start of all my twists
I cry...

You nailed my heart to the cross
If I don't know the road to chaos
The gravedigger is waiting for me
You nail my hear to the cross
If I cannot see the fullmoon gloss
The deathbringer is waiting for me

Behind the door, there is my hell!
Why did she break each of my own actions?
Why such a punishment?
This is my judgement?
Trying to escape
Trying to escape this mess
Trying to escape that stress
Trying to escape this mess
Trying to escape that stress
Trying to escape... trying to escape...

You nailed my heart to the cross
If I don't know the road to chaos
The gravedigger is waiting for me
