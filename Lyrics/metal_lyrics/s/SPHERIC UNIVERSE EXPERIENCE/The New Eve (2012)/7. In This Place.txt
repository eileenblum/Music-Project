[Lyrics by John Drai]

Beat!
Appeared in a fractioned time
In empty space in black and white

Earth!
nature and opportunities
For all the species livin' in

Abnormal precarity,
Savagery and poverty
We've lost the balance!

"Preserve our home" as they say
This is the last chance we have
We've lost the balance!

In this place
I feel power of eternity
A long race
For us all and everybody! Everybody!

Water...
Is cleaning us form all our sins
But lacks for lots of our fellows

Fire...
Is burning deep inside our souls
But destroys lands of our hopes

Abnormal precarity,
Savagery and poverty
We've lost the balance!

"Preserve our home" as they say
This is the last chance we have
We've lost the balance!

In this place
I feel power of eternity
A long race
For us all and everybody! Everybody!
