[Lyrics by Fred Colombo]

Hey Girls!
Girls of the newest century
Could you please tell me
Who you want to be?
Hey Ladies!
Granddaughters of the oldest centuries
Do you know where you're going?
Tell me...

Hey miss two thousand eleven
Did you ever wonder if your grandmothers
Would be proud of you?
Hey miss two thousand dollars
You should be wary of the world
you're living in - you're getting lost in
You're getting spoiled

Television - internet
Weight loss - shopping
Office - make-up - magazines
Family - movies

Age-old values being forgotten
New harmful social vices
New pleasures coming from nowhere
Following prophets of appearance

Mother nature
Has created
The beautiful Venus
Her role is sacred
please nature's avatar
Don't forget who you are

Mother nature
Has created
The beautiful Venus
Her role is sacred
