[Lyrics by Vince Benaim]

Words
Of war remain
In my mind for respect
Scar
On your great face I will carve
I think you understand!

Born - dead - I'm living in Hell!
I'm demon of your brain!
Rise - fight - you're going to die!
So please shut up and get away!

I don't think you can realize
That situation where we live in fight!
I don't think we can realize
Now it's for you to close your mouth!
So shut up!

Lie
You live with lies
I see it in your eyes!
Now I can decide
If you shall live or die!

Born - dead - I'm living in Hell!
I'm demon of your brain!
Rise - fight - you're going to die!
So please shut up and get away!

I don't think you can realize
That situation where we live in fight!
I don't think we can realize
Now it's for you to close your mouth!
So shut up!

Please,
Don't fuck with me,
I think you know I'm not joking!
Cause
You know you'll scream
For everything,
For all the fucking bullshit!

Born - dead - I'm living in Hell!
I'm demon of your brain!
Rise - fight - you're going to die!
So please shut up and get away!

I don't think you can realize
That situation where we live in fight!
I don't think we can realize
Now it's for you to close your mouth!
So shut up!
