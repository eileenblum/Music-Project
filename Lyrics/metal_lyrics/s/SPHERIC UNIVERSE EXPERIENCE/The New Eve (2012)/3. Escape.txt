[Lyrics by Fred Colombo]

Make sure you still remember
The way back to the border
Between pixels and true things
Between clicking and living

Thousand of friends
Fake wink - it stinks

Look at your words for a second
More often typed than spoken
Your face has become blank
It doesn't display the smileys you bang,
Bang! Bang! Bang!

Thousand of friends
Fake wink - it stinks

Now open your human eyes
To the divine charm of real life,
Don't forget stage no. 1
Press ESCape, while it is still time!

You are the hero
No rules to follow
In your cyber show
Through the screen window

Feel free to die!
Next time you will retry!

Now open your human eyes
To the divine charm of real life,
Don't forget stage no. 1
Press ESCape, while it is still time!

The easy fantasy of virtual world
Is taking you
Because your grey, gloomy real world
Is no fun, no fun to you!

You defeat armies every night
You drive faster than speed of light
You climb all the sacred mountains
You have absolutely no chains

Thousand of friends
Fake wink - it stinks
Online emotions
Isolement expansion

Now open your human eyes
To the divine charm of real life,
Don't forget stage no. 1
Press ESCape, while it is still time!

The easy fantasy of virtual world
Is taking you
Because your grey, gloomy real world
Is no fun, no fun to you!
