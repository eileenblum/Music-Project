[Lyrics by Vince BenaÃ¯m]

Slave of my passion
Of your soul and your aura
focus my attention
on this world that suits me
Blinded by my luck
in some illusion mirror
I was unable to see...

I used to think
That sorrow wouldn't be easy

In my dreams I paint
Your white archangel face
In my dark spirit
Nothing has been erased

I cannot survive to a life without you
I'm trying to live with this sorrow life too
Now for me it's time to burn alone and die
Your hands are linked to this
This day I died !

I used to think
That sorrow wouldn't be easy

I will not resist
To this pain caused by my tears
In memories of our heart sink
By waves of the seas

I cannot survive to a life without you
I'm trying to live with this sorrow life too
Now for me it's time to burn alone and die
Your hands are linked to this
This day I died !

I used to think
That sorrow wouldn't be easy
Life without you led me
To insanity

I used to think
That sorrow wouldn't be easy...
Wouldn't be easy...
Wouldn't be easy...
