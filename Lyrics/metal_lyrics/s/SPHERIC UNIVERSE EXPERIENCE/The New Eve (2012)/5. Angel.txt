[Lyrics by John Drai]

Yesterday I was alone,
Gloomy and cold,
Living for myself...

I met you...
And my world has changed
In a brighter day

You were the rainbow
In this grey sky
The light above me
That gave me a sign...
That gave me a sign

Angel,
You are my angel
Fly on my shoulders
When I am sad and blue
Angel,
You fill my heart with joy
Thank you for being here in my life!

Each day of out lives,
Our feelings grow
A full passion of love

I'll be by your side
Wherever you are
Wherever you go...

Our ways crossed
Like lines in the sand
Erasing memories
Of our previous lives...
Of our previous lives!

Angel,
You are my angel
Fly on my shoulders
When I am sad and blue
Angel,
You fill my heart with joy
Thank you for being here in my life!

You were the rainbow
In this grey sky
The light above me
That gave me a sign...
That gave me a sign!

Angel,
You are my angel
Fly on my shoulders
When I am sad and blue
Angel,
You fill my heart with joy
Thank you for being here in my life!
