[Lyrics by Fred Colombo]

"Mirror, mirror on the wall..
Who's the greatest of them all?"

They love to you
Everything they can do
They love to show off
It makes them feel so tough

Nevermind the consequence
Only their present times makes sense
The sweet "Me-myself-and-I"
"Me-myself-and-I" lifestyle!

Your attention please!
Give it all to me!
My great self deserves the best!
Won't help no one else!
Have no family
Won't help anyone but me!

Oh sure it's so much easier
To only focus on my own views
Who cares about the others
It's all about me,
All about self-abuse!

Prisoners of themselves
Blinkered attitude at its best
In their one-man show
Pathetically living alone

Nevermind collateral damage
As long as they are satisfied
The selfish "me-myself-and-I"
"Me-myself-an-I" lifestyle!

Your attention please!
Give it all to me!
My great self deserves the best!
Won't help no one else!
Have no family
Won't help anyone but me!

Oh sure it's so much easier
To only focus on my own views
Who cares about the others
It's all about me,
All about self-abuse!

They are causing
The contamination of human beings
The worst example for the kids
Injecting bad seeds
Centuries of evolution
To finally fall back
To the law of the jungle
Oh yes they like that!

Nevermind the consequence
Only their present times makes sense
The sweet "Me-myself-and-I"
"Me-myself-and-I" lifestyle!
Your attention please!
Give it all to me!
My great self deserves the best!
Won't help no one else!
Have no family
Won't help anyone but me!

Oh sure it's so much easier
To only focus on my own views
Who cares about the others!
It's all about me, all about self-abuse!
