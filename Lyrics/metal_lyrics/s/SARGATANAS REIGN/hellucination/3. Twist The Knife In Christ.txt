[Music: Sargatanas Reign, Lyrics: C. LagerstrÃ¶m]

Incisive noise from attacking bombers start
Blistering explosions tears the sky apart
A mighty display of unholy wrath and tyranny
Unleashed in the form of fire upon the enemy
Massive clouds of dust adorn the enlightened sky
As we into unholy battle fearlessly fly

We shall fill our cups with your filthy blood
And drink it as we strangle your useless god

Your army shall sustain heavy losses as we begin to slay
We shall utterly destroy those who cross our way

We shall fill our cups with your filthy blood
And drink it as we strangle your useless god

Crucified you shall hang as a useless whore
Your useless soul shall forever burn as a monument to war
We shall erase your name from the book of history
And purify this earth with the death of Christianity
