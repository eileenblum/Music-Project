[Music: Sargatanas Reign, Lyrics: Morgan Steinmeyer HÃ¥kansson]

Somethings burning with flames like stormy seas of the sun
Somethings woken and burned a thousand with its yawn

Something flames trough us all its the age of fire
Blood and ashes of before

Somethings growing as does its ablaze
Somethings near so burn with it

Follow the fire amons desire

The marquis of hell I am
The no infernal legions I command
The death of your god demand

Somethings burning with flames like stormy seas of the sun
Somethings woken and burned a thousand with its yawn
