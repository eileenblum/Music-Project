[Music: Sargatanas Reign, Lyrics: Marcus Lundberg]

A web of horror, blood and fear is closing in on you
You have been chosen to achieve his craving for absolute power

As you feel the flames, licking you as the devil
And chains with meat hooks tear your skin apart
Devotees of an ancient evil approaches
And it thrives on torture, blood and killing thee

Flames of hate controls your temptation
Despair and damnation brings hellucination

I see the smoke of your blistering body rising
And you will burn, just see â¦cause hell will rise with me
If you play with demons - their plaything you'll be
For a cause with higher power - just come and play with me!

Flames of hate controls your temptation
Despair and damnation brought hellucination
