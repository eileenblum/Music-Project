[Music: Sargatanas Reign, Lyrics: Morgan Steinmeyer Hï¿½kansson]

Somethingï¿½s burning with flames like stormy seas of the sun
Somethingï¿½s woken and burned a thousand with its yawn

Something flames trough us all itï¿½s the age of fire
Blood and ashes of before

Somethingï¿½s growing as does its ablaze
Somethingï¿½s near so burn with it

Follow the fire amons desire

The marquis of hell I am
The no infernal legions I command
The death of your god demand

Somethingï¿½s burning with flames like stormy seas of the sun
Somethingï¿½s woken and burned a thousand with its yawn
