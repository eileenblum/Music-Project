[Music: Sargatanas Reign, Lyrics: C. Lagerstrï¿½m]

A thrilling set of emotions
Awakes my slumbering need
Come be my feeble victim
Let me make you bleed

You enlight my flickering fire
This day will be your last
Your life shall be reduced
To a forgotten thing of the past

Killing Spree Supreme
Desires will not be subdued
Let me hear you scream
Killing Spree Supreme

I possess a mind of perversion
And this I will express
As I tear your body apart
And unite you with your death
