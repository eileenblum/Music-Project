[Music: Sargatanas Reign, Lyrics: Niklas Samuelsson]

Can you see, when it is needed
When higher powers fall
You can stop the agony and the despair
Fight the life of those without hope

Euthanasia, Last Resort
The Final Word Is Yours
Life or Death, Which Shall It Be

Moral standards and Christian beliefs
Prohibits this relief, this blessing
When no medication will help
Then you have to make a stand
Life or death, which shall it be
