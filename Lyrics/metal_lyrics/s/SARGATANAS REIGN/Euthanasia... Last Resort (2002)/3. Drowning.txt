[Music: Sargatanas Reign, Lyrics: Niklas Samuelsson]

I wonder if my dreams can kill me,
Every night the dream is the sameï¿½
Blood covers me and I die without hope,
The intense smell of fear reeks from my wounds,
As I bleed towards my death

Drowning In Dreams of Blood,
Hate Overpowers My Fear,
Iï¿½ll Fight Till My Last Breath Is Drawn,
Instruments of Death,
Are At My Command.

This war has become my life,
My soul has long gone away,
All that is left is me, and my suffering,
The time has comeï¿½
I will lose it allï¿½

The sights I've seen can make you blind,
A fear so intense, a life so meaningless,
Orders without Humanity, Dreams without hope,
The means do no longer justify the end,
It must end, or I will end it my selfï¿½
