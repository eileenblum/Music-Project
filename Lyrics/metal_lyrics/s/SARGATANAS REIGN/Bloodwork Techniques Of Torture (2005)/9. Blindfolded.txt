An atmosphere of deadly pain
Extinguish the fire that drives my soul
Slow apathy is spreading through my brain
Redeeming me as death takes hold

Blindfolded by suicidal thoughts;
The wolfleader is now the stalkedâ¦

Intentions of torture tingle my spine,
Primal feeding on the multitudes of death
A dead body lying next to mine
Primitive instinct â a passion for flesh

Blindfolded by suicidal thoughts
The wolfleader is now the stalkedâ¦

[Lead: Marcus Lundberg]

Blindfolded by suicidal thoughts;
The wolfleader is now the stalkedâ¦

Hour by hour, the strings snaps inside
Reason upset into examine my death
Length of a second to take my own life
Time growing shorter with every regret

Blindfolded by suicidal thoughts;
The wolfleader is now the stalkedâ¦
