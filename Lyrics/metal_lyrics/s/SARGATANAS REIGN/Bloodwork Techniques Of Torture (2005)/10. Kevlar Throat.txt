[Lead: Marcus Lundberg]

This isnât a way to be a martyr, to manifest my pain
Maybe itâs one of lifeâs great demands, to go down the drain
No one told me it would be self-destructive just to care
One thing this fucking world will never be is; fair

See the light in the end of the pipe
Enter the realms of suicide paradise
Dead is the value of your name
The vanity of living is your pain

Canât hold the rage when the truth is shed
Mission naÃ¯ve; saving a world thatâs already dead
Consumed democracy returns a socialist regime
Political correctness, makes you see what to believe
Religion, media, politics streamingâ¦
Schizoid world orders screaming!

See the light in the end of the pipe
Enter the realms of suicide paradise
Dead is the value of your name
The vanity of living is your pain

[Lead: Marcus Lundberg]

A perception of incompetence; the blind leading insanity
Exhausted by frustrations, it leads to complete anarchy
Insecurity for social hierarchy drives reason to extremes
All thatâs left of value; is to die a painful death, it seems
Religion, media, politics streamingâ¦
Schizoid world orders screaming!
