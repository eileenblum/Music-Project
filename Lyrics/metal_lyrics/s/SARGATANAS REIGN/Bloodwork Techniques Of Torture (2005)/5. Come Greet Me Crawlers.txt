An emotional devastation
For you to swallow
Slide down the walls of fury
To reach deep down inside

Come greet me crawlers,
Come hail me swallowers

Grasp and claw for your being
Feel the dirt become you
Lay yourself down in my world
Slowly turn your eyes away

Reap the fearless empty
Empty for life eternally
Your pain is not yours
Itâs just for you to hold

Come greet me crawlers,
Come hail me swallowers

[Lead: Marcus Lundberg]

Come greet me crawlers,
Come hail me swallowers

Grasp and claw for your being
Feel the dirt become you
Lay yourself down in my world
Slowly turn your eyes away
