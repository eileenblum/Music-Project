Ruled by emotions, clouded perception
Emotionless perspective doesnât exist
All these feelings burning inside
Getting hold on me, takes control
This world isâ¦
Faceless, blind, ruthless, cold

Regain control, logical revolution
Thoughts collide, escalation
Next level of painâ¦comes alive

[Lead: Kristoffer Andersson / Marcus Lundberg]

Self-inflicted torture of the mind
Physical lies, deeds of the flesh
Cancer fed feelings dressed in black
Cancer fed thought feel the tumours grow
This world isâ¦
Faceless, blind, ruthless, cold

Regain control, logical chaos
Evaluate euphoria, decrease
Next level of lies, dormant, calm

Breathing diseases walking upright
Death of all mankind is my religion
Acts of fools echoes in the past and paints the future
No hope for me, my mind is blank
This world isâ¦
Faceless, blind, ruthless, cold

Regain control, logical evolution
Next level of painâ¦ comes alive
