Chosen as my tender victim
Twisting by the pain inflicting
Bestial appetites to sate,
As flesh and steel I mate

Twist the blade
&amp; blood is pouring from the torso
Twist the blade; the sliver man I am

I wanna feel your body breaking
When the life from you Iâm taking
You were an easy prey
Under my genial blade
Living out a life of decadence
Without any thought of consequence
So be it on our headstone
Which cut deep down to the bone

Chosen as my tender victim
Twisting by the pain inflicting
Bestial appetites to sate,
As flesh and steel I mate

Twist the blade
&amp; blood is pouring from the torso
Twist the blade; the sliver man I am

I wanna feel your body breaking
When the life from you Iâm taking
You were an easy prey
Under my genial blade
