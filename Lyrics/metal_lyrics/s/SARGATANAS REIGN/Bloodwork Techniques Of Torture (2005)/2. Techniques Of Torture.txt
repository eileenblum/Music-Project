Kissing your smooth blue lips correct
With my hands tight around your neck
Your eyes once so bright now dead
Staring blindly in your head

Techniques of torture;
Tyranny total supremacy

[Lead: Marcus Lundberg]

Profanation of a body so divine
Mistreating it as it was mine
Humiliation of your empty soul
Piercing your mind no self control

Techniques of torture;
Tyranny total supremacy

Blood drenched in violent acts
Ripping your skin and burning flesh
Rape murder becomes art in slavery
And your labour gives me supremacy

Techniques of torture;
Tyranny total supremacy
