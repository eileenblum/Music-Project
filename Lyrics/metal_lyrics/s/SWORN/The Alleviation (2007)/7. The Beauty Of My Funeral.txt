[Music: C. KjÃ¸rsvik, Lyrics: A. Engebretsen]

The weeping of my name
The moanings of a bleeding widow
Void between the sighs
Asphyxiates me in pain
The Ashen Shore
Bereavement over death
Speaks a truth
A blend of mirth
A blatant lie
Across the wind
My supremacy
To your blur
The Ashen Shore
Bereavement over death
Speaks a truth
A blend of mirth
Cruelty burns a flame
Buries me in strength
The beauty there's contained
Flickers over my pain
Death shores upon
Scream of its power
Shores are dark
It kills the light
