[Music: C. KjÃ¸rsvik, Lyrics: T. Knapstad]

Withered symbols of decay I beheld
Their lifeless shapes omens of things to come
Withered symbols of decay I beheld
They were the past, they were the future
The lament of the black sea, I heareth
And tears of silver, I cried
Thus the Argentine streams, I heareth
And tears of silver, I cried
Frostvenom - chilled mind
Searing thoughts - blinded by lust
All statues in the gardens of decadence
Forever bound by the vines of midwinter
Embrace thy bastard Elysium
Embrace thy corrupted heart
