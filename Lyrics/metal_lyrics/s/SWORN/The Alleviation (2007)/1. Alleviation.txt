[Music: C. KjÃ¸rsvik, Lyrics: L. Herland &amp; T. Klungland]

Darkness captivates my mind
I can smell the thriving apprehension
I hear voices crying for the cruelty behind
But I can't stop what's already done
Drifting away, it's such a distant past
It's all turning black, black at last
This darkened power has drained me of pain
Left with anger and hatred I shall rot
It tortured me until my soul burst
Into a raging, accursed fiend
Drifting away, it's such a distant past
It's all turning black, black at last
Trying to break loose from this state of mind
What am I becoming? What have I become?
No mercy for whom standing before me
I'll exploit your screams of life (hunger)
By shattering your dreams of eternal life
I'm simply getting stronger
Drifting away, it's such a distant past
It's all turning black at last
