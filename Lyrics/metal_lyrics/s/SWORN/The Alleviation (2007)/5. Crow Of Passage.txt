[Music: C. KjÃ¸rsvik, Lyrics: T. Klungland]

All who lay their eyes upon me
Shall forever jarrow
I am invisible, though I can be seen
For I'm the passing that pulls you down
Dreadfully I am left to wander
Upon the remains of my kin
Walking alone as the blackest of shadows
Ancient and lethal, constant and depraved
Over misty mountains
Enclosed in the mourning
From the thousands of souls
That I have put to rest
This is my curse
The eternal damnation
I am the dark wanderer
The crow of passage
Illness is my undying color
The blood in my veins is black as death
Roaming this land of sinister fright
I convey malice, the supremacy of night
This is my curse, the eternal damnation
I am the dark wanderer, the crow of passage
