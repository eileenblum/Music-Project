[Music: C. KjÃ¸rsvik, Lyrics: T. Klungland]

I am the hostile image
Your violent misery
I am the one who shall
Set your soul ablaze
In these flames I shall
Force through this cosmic haze
This third ruin (from the fire)
Has just become a mere illusion
I see the seasons rise and fall
For the tower in the middle is rising tall
With a black, surrounding wall
Float towards the sky and see the holy light
A madness surrounds you
As you feel your wings melt
Soiling the clean earth of your kind as you fall
I am the seeker of vengeance
I am the spiritual force of vivid visions
Your final destination
The ultimate damnation
This is where your kind
Have slumbered for decades
In this kingdom of crowned vultures
I reclaim the essence of evil
I will forever despise your kind
I am the umpire and you are mine
