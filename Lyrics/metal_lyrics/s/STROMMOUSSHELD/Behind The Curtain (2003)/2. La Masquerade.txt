Small... dark room
Walls! Painted in shadows
Shapes in [deca]dance
Importunately are smiling

In this silent world live my red painted thoughts
Sounds! Silent sounds...
Sounds! Tormenting sounds...

There must be out of here
Exit from this plane
I hear the voices behind the wall
This must be a masquerade!

In this shining world lives my despaired soul
Sounds! Silent sounds...
Sounds! Tormenting sounds...

There must be out of here
Exit from this plane
I hear the voices behind the wall
This must be a masquerade
