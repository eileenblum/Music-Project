Do I have my own star?
The star that shines forever
in this lost space, in this microcosmos' shit

Isolated from every sun
Desolated in every kind
of heaven

Behind the Curtain
Someday I'll burn my memories
And this is my answer
There is no director
Anywhere...

That star that shines forever
in this lost space, in this microcosmos' shit
Isolated from every
Desolated in every kind
of HEAVEN
