Solar scream when night turns off
as the hot flowers' splendour

Warm liquid oxygen is getting brighter
and my heavy breath reaches the end
Never stop is only one of fables
I've just wanted to leave my souvenir

behind each mask are hidden eyes of fear

It might be only my another schizm, because
boundary between java &amp; dream disappeared a long time ago
Behind us million miles of transgalactical trip
But we are standing now at the beginning of
transcendental route...

Deformated masks in hellborn porno-smile
hide torment and pain

Warm liquid oxygen is getting brighter
and my heavy breath reaches the end
Never stop is only one of fables
I've just wanted to leave my souvenir

Hallucinations, phatamorganas
And where is my oasis?
