Feeling like I've always been here
Living forever and ever
Didn't choose the time and space
-I'm fallen your honour!

I - temporary file, as day and night
Larva and butterfly!
I'm robber of time, retoric one
Reason and progeny
Temporary file, as day and night
Larva and butterfly!
I'm robber of time, retoric one
Reason and progeny...

Six billions rotten skin
It's unique collective
I spend my life running away,
Finding myself

I can't recognize my face
And I've never wanted to do it
My enthrophy grows
The body fades away

Day after day, night after night
I was there and you were there
Day after day, night after night
Expending the time, braking the time
I! Larva and butterfly! Reason and progeny!
Larva and butterfly! Reason and progeny!

The perception of time and the meaning of time
We are getting old, we are getting wise

Yes... Night after night (the meaning of time)
I was there and you were there (we are getting wise)
Day after day, night after night we are getting old
Expending the time, braking the time...
