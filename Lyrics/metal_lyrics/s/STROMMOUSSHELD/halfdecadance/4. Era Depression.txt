In tormenting depression
Hidden in the empty space
I'm enduring forever
In this tiresome place

Bleeding memories of thunder
Persecuted by a sky
Still waiting for a storm
Let dream turns into real life

Rising nostalgia, yearning to fly
Souvenir from the last call
Of damnation's bell

Forever alone in the lightful apathia
I am discovering black materia
Of depression
