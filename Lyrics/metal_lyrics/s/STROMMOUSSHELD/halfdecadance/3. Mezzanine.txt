In the point between two main points
Step by step through transision stage
All is one - the boundless dream
Crossed sometimes by the falling leaf

Looking for a better time, better place to understand
Live your life, fing your aim
Distant star will lead your way

Time stops. Digression. Mezzanine.
Mind grows. Transgression. Mezzanine.

In the land between sky and sea
Everything is dead indeed
Open heart, read the codes - subconscious is always hope
Throw away heavy bonds, that's your sun on the horison!
Live your life, find your aim
Distant star will show you the way

Time stops. Digression. Mezzanine.
Mind grows. Transgression. Mezzanine.
