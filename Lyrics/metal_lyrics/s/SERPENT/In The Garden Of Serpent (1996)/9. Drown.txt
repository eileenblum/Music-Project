The sea turns the endless tide open up my mind so wide the giant ocean shivers
black dolphins leave thousands tracks awake the ghosts of sunken ships drowned
sailors on virgin trips i can't feel anything no more my helpless body drifts
ashore i role into unconsciousness in brighten lights i'm getting dressed a
choir of dying as i sink struggle no more don't even think now i hear my faith
now calls and i drown in the beauty of it all do you do you love the midnight
sea i saw the sea and sea saw me strange brothers wave good bye same blood
same tears same death as i.
