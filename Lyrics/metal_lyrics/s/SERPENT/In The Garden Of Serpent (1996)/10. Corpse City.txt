Can't tell the difference between dark or light signs and smells of the
invisible night blood and rust in the palm of my hand i focus corpse city
wasteland in the blackness of my slivery soul things they're burried and
things i stole the rain is soft dark crystal tears I've been waiting for too
many years dogs fight for pride they die for pride insane storm rides the
skyline eye of storm string and divine roof top horizon of deat hand dirt
we've murdered and killed the earth dogs fight for pride they die for pride
dogs fight for pride the loser's corpse is pushed aside the concrete anguish
inside scream i breathe stinking subway steam a bitter heart fills my my days
am i condemned to feel this way.
