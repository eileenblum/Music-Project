Welcome to where everything is as lovely as a dream welcome to where you and i
row gently down the stream slide into this chilled our land let the smoke you
high release yourself to the unknown world close your tired vacant eyes too
stoned to walk you dream away and fly with the flow feel your spine melt down
like wax and swim with your soul floating in the shivering light fell the balm
of feelings heal walk on clouds of unborn thoughts in the sky of unreal move
yourself like dancing fire to rhythms never heard down to the ground hear the
river of worlds you're wild and beautiful i can see the stars in your eyes
promise me you'll follow me say at least you'll try.
