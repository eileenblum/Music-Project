I'm slowly sinking into sweet state of decadence i hear the bottom calling me
singing in mysterious ways the world and reality forever left behind I'm the
one with forbidden pleasures turning off my mind nothing really matters in the
universe of frozen space relax me into the groove show me my right place
pulsating particles in my eyes riding on the wave of hate i gotta slow down
and forget ready to explode please save my head nothing ever changes in the
universe of frozen space relax me into the groove show me my right place.
