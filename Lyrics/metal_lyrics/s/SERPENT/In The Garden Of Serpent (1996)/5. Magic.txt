Alchemists and magicians reverse sailors of river styx poets and musicians
decadent subconscious travellers soldiers fall fade and die like stars in the
universe of oblivion no one enslaved escapes jealosy and delightful hatred of
being lizard snake god human eyes lizard insect of disguise naked mothers
embraced children in womb like poses soft child eyes fly in this prison of
loyable arms it's strange how needles can ejaculate hoarse power into pierced
burning vains and cause earthquakes and eruptions in the other parts of this
planet.
