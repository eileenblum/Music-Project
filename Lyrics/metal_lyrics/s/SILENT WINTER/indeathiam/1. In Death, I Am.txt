I was born to die
Often question why
New day, new life
Fate doomed to die

Hollow reflection
Weary and broken
Hope scorned with passion
Hallowed thy name

Faceless in grief
Seeping cold tears
Aching cold heart
No longer feels

In death, I am
Sorrow no more
In death rejoice
Freed misery

For the last time
Hold frail being
Savour my last
My final words

In death, I am
Sorrow no more
In death rejoice
Freed misery
