Loveless world - dissolution
Words unspoken - disregarded
Withered dreams - revelations
Scars unhealing - echoed despair

Fallen from grace
I was summoned to the fire
The flames beckoned me

Through the ash I walked
No more fear, no more lies
Silhouette to the sky
The rain soothed me

My soul leaves
Condemned shell it flees
Through howling winds
My spirit did fly

The clash of thunder
My new pulse
I swept through the forests
My breath raised the leaves

I stood in the streams
Felt the rush of water
It flowed through me
New blood found

By the waves
I flew the tides
To distant shores
Where sad soles lay
