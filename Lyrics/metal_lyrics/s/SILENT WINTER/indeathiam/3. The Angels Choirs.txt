Lonely man
Hollow shell
Black my heart
Veiled in rage

Spirit torn
Angel cold
Seek solace
Cursed I am

I heard angels choirs
I heard them call to me
I stand alone
The sky opens for me

I heard angels choirs
I heard them call to me
I look to the sky
I saw hope but turned away

To myself a stranger
No hope from within me
Isolated, alone
How did this all begin?

As I sit here solemn
In darkened thought forever
Reflecting on years gone
My black wings draped around me
