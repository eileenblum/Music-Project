Holding you tightly
Fall into me
Lover of darkness
Shadow of the night

In this river
Drowning entwined
My tears for you
Our hearts brought doom

No sleep for my sadness
I wait o so lonely
My dreams cast away
Solemn in the night

Crown of my desire
My heart upon your tide
Her voice sung to me
Silent like a lost whisper

I seek no answers
For her lust was mine
Her voice of the fallen
In the midnight air

Crown of my desire
My heart upon your tide
Her voice sung to me
Silent like a lost whisper

In our blackened faith
The storm was ours
As the world died with us

The blinding of the light
The warmth felt inside
As the world died with us
