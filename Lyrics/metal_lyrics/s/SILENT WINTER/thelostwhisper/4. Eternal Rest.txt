Hide myself away
Wait eternal rest
I have been swept away
Heaven called to me

The sun has died on me
The holy will not cry
My pale and frozen face
So weak and lonely

Like a fallen angel
Your black wings embraced me
And held me in my moment of shame

I remembered when
You would save my sole
My faith died in you
Where is my God now?

In this silence
In death I wait
Sorrow never ending
Haunting forevermore
