I waited so cold and sorrowful
My life imprisoned by my frailty
I embraced the pain
For the last time

In this cold slumber
The angels mourned for me
From their light of heaven
On this winters night
I watched her despair
As the bells tolled for me

Embrace me as I die tonight
The light has gone from my eyes

In this cold slumber
The angels mourned for me
From their light of heaven
Let her ethereal sail
Surrender her pain
As the dream sails came for me

Pray for me
I will rise
Tears me apart

I dream of you
I pray for you
Tears me apart

She waited under the midnight moon
But never would I rise again
Let heaven watch over her in its sacred keep

My body a sad valley
Its soul would roam no more
Never the light would touch me again
