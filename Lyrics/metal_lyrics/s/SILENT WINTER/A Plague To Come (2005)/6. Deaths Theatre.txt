Alone I grace the darkness
A grey world before me
I closed my eyes to see light
In old memories
I danced with the shadows
Visions I held so dear
The curse of time
Bathing in tears of yesteryear
Life to deaths theatre
Lonliness its theme
It pulls you under
The pain inside
Demons within
My bloodied mind
My minds growing to darker ways
Do I see reality anymore
Could it all be dreams
I pray for this
My world is coming down
Shattered by self hate
I point a finger to blame
Hang my head in a cowards shame
Nowhere is safe
Death will reach us all
There is no survival
The end is upon me
