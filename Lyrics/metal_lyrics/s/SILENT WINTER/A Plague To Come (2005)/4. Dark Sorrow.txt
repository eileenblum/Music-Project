No one can restrain me
I will let my fury be
Unleash what's been inside
All you weak will subside
I am your dark sorrow
I'm what makes you sick
You are the anger in my veins
You make me want the vengeance I'm owed
Expect no remorse
No more feelings inside
To all I hated
I shall watch you slain
I went beyond hope
No reason to hold on
Scattered ashes
On this last days light
Slowly drowning
Forlorn souls
Light fades away
A sick world
Cold and grey
Screams of suffering
