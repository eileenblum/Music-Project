I waited in the shadows
Here I did remain
A black sleep through your land
Hidden by screams of pain
A Plague to come
A curse for everyman
In my fury relentless
I watched your empire fall
There is no light
Your soul is black
The nightmares you cry
The suffering inside
All hope is lost
Cold tears fill your eyes
The nightmares you cry
The suffering inside
A fever of despair
Untold misery
Through my anger
Your life in rin
I pledge to you
Eternal longing
A heart of black
A cold stone
In your arms
In your tears
I brought forward your pain
In your cries
In your screams
Echoed my eternal despair
