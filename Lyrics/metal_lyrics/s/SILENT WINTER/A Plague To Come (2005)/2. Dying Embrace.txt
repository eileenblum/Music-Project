A dying embrace
Holds me dear
Its sold caress
In blackened tears
Closed my eyes to the world
Love has gone
Outcast I become
Fallen from grace
He waits in the wasteland
Eternal Darkness
Enslaved by loathing
A ray of light
A glimmer of hope
Time stands still
For the emotionless one
Do you hear the screams?
God of nothingness
Drowned by the plagues
God of nothingness
Do you hear their screams?
God of nothingness
Bringer of the plagues
