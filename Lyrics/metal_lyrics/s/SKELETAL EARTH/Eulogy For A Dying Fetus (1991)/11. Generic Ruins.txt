Something sweet
Something pure
Something unique
Sweptout doors
Wrapped n trends
Clenched in fashion
Cloned to no end
And it's catchin'
Put on your uniform
Spoiled likeness
Like you're born just for this
Your lips are brown from sucking up
To the peers you've found
Bland proportion
Provoked vomit
Join the crowd
You have done it
Open eyes cannot bear it
No surprise - you're all generic
My world - pitch black
Outta the ruins
I'm never comin' back
Generic ruins
Never! - No!
