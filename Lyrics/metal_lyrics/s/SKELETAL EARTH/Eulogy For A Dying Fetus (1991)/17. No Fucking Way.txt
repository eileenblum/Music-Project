I'm so confused
Don't know what to do
Should I take a chance and face the consequence?
Or should I lay back and die without the satisfaction of giving it a try?
No way, I'll get off my ass, make it happen for myself!
No way I'll let the chance pass by me again!
No way! No way! No fucking way!
I can't sit idle, to me it's suicidal, 'cause time is a disease which feeds on my incentive
Gotta take some chances
Without the "maybe's", what's the point in living?
If actions speak louder than words, it's time they started screaming
No way I'll let the chance pass by me again!
No way! No way! No fucking way!
