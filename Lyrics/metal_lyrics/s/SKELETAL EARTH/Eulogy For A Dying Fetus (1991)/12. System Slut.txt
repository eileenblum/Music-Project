Up and down the ladder
Never a secure spot
Sucking for that identity
Same old slut
Paint your best face
Your sole reliance
You're a little worn
Crawling to the business giants
Kiss ass and lie to the man with a tie
Big bucks rolling in
But you're still beneath them
Can't put a pretty face to the grindstone
Knees hit the floor
Dignity's gone
Grab the money train
Fuel with greed
System slut goes down
System slut is skin deep
System slut
