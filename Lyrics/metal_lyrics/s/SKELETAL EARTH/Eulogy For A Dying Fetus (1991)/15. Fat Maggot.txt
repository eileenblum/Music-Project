Shovel that coal - gotta make a profit
Fuck acid rain - I hate fish anyway
Beef up production - too much competition
I wanna buy half the nation by the middle of the next week
Profit! Profit! Profit!
I don't care if all resources are consumed
We'll try another industry
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
I don't care
Raping the Earth for selfish profit
Feed me! Feed me!
I wanna reproduce like a parasite
I'll feed until I starve my host food
The world may be dying but I'm living comfortable
Leeching Mother Earth makes a profitable company
