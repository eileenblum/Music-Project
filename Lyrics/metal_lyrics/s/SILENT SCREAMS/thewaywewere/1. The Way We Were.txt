I never thought I'd get so lost in my mind 

These thoughts I have 
They keep me buried 
Bury me in a hole 
And I feel like we're not the way we used to be 

Crushed by the weight of this life 
We're destroyed by what creates us 
This failure hangs heavy like a crown of thorns 
I can't hold on 

So we've forgotten to hold on 
Stay stronger, burn brighter, live today and fuck the future 
To what we left in the dust 
Stay stronger, burn brighter, live today and fuck the future 
So take me back to the world I left behind 
To the way we were 
Everything happens for a reason 
Well these reasons are all my own 

Maybe I've come undone 
Or maybe I'm just giving up 
I will rise, I will fight 
Leave you beaten, broken 
Left in the dirt 

Think I'll lay here (with the sun) 
With the sun on me 

These thoughts I have 
They keep me buried 
Bury me in a hole 
And I feel like we're not the way we used to be 
Yeah 

What do you do when this all feels pointless? 
I know (I know) 
The sun hides behind a sleeping moon 
And I know, I know 
My hope will return 

So stare into the eyes of your reflection 
And live your life 
Do you feel like you've missed out on everything? 
You're lost and hungry 
For a taste of something you can never reach 
You'll never reach 

I need to feel happiness 
I need to feel happiness 
I need to feel like the way we were 

I need to feel happiness 
I need to feel happiness 
I need to feel like the way we once were 

Memories won't last forever
But I'll hold this in my heart 
Memories won't last forever 
But I'll hold this in my heart
