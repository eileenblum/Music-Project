Day in day out
We all walk the fine line
Between heaven and hell
Cherish the time you have
Although it be gone tomorrow
Guiding light
Hope for now
Have I seen all Iâm meant to see?
Or is there so much more
Is it all downhill from here? Is it all?
If I hang on just a little longer
How much longer
Iâm losing my grip
Weâre just echoes in the storm
Though lost, unheard, weâll never be alone
Right now Iâm at the edge of the rope
Iâm holding on to stop from snapping the bone
Hold me up and I know
Iâve been here before
This place feels the same
The noose is still warm
I thought this darkness had gone
It never really left at all
Itâs hard looking in from the outside
When everything feels wrong
Iâm not the same anymore
So wrap me up in all my regret and bury me beneath the leaves
Maybe then I will be at peace
I donât ever think but I can hope
It got easier it gets easier
I donât ever think but I can hope
It gets easier
Hope for now
