We lose the ones we love
We all feel alone sometimes, we all feel so low
We breathe, we love, we hurt we burn
It lives inside me this deep repressed cycle
Only suppressed for so long
Now it's tearing from my skin
Is this acceptance or are we just too misguided to see
We can't be saved we're just bodies for graves?
We can't be saved, but I refuse to believe
I know I'm more than blood and fucking bone
But I'll still hold inside the fact that I'm falling apart
We lose the ones we love and soon we'll be the ones lost to the loved
Am I supposed to move on like its nothing?
I can't, I just can't
It's not the aching in my bones that leaves me breathless
That leaves me powerless
It's the knowing that I'll never see you again
The emptiness
It's the jump that shakes me awake
But I have nothing left to dream
For its all been taken away from me
We all live on promises tomorrow can't keep
Nothing to say that words could explain
I try to tell myself I don't feel anything
Now I have nothing left to feel
Now I have nothing
I can't be alone
Taken from me, time moves on as we breathe a new normal
Til' we become one with the nothing
Face down in the dark
The truth is I miss you so much
Nothings' the same
I need to move on
I'm sorry, am I supposed to move on?
