If we stop and take a look at our lives
Weâve been living in a shade of grey
I need some colour I need some clarity
How could it have got to this?
Stretched out and worn thin
Falling faster so pick it up
Now is the time to repent now is the time
I lie awake at night dreaming of a better future
What seems impossible is getting ever closer
Some things never change
And some things never stay the same
Some things never change
Now is the time to repent now is the time to
Who is to blame?
For everything is wrong and Iâm desperate for answers
A shell, a shell of myself
This washed out complexion
I am empty I am nothing
