Everything lost, everything overcome
Pushing it all away,
Before the worry and the doubt sets in
We had the time to plan yet we've got so much more to prove
I never thought this could be how it was
Time after time we hold our own
How can something I've wanted for so long, feel so wrong?
It feels so fucking wrong
Yet this fading light
Can only flicker for so long
We were cut so deep but the wound would not bleed
We were meant to carry, we were meant to carry on
Breathing new life into
We were meant to carry, we were meant to carry on
Looking out to sea
The clouds were black and we felt the rain in our hands
We only suffer until we overcome
Can I keep up, will I be good enough?
When failures' on the tip of my tongue
The darkness surrounds us
There's no air we're drowning
Bounded by blood
Starting over and nothing ever could make me look back
Scars don't heal but the wound now is sealed
We were meant to carry, we were meant to carry on
Breathing new life into these empty lungs
And now's my time
This is my chance, go
