Death kiss
Sick to the stomach with worry and distress
Inevitability at its finest
The clock is ticking until we disappear
Iâve never been so scared in my whole life

Death kiss, death kiss
Stains everyone and everything
And I know itâs not gonna be allright
But there isnât a fucking thing I can do

I canât make sense of anything
What the fuck am I even here for?
We work so hard to ensure our future
To have it fall apart
Separate. Iâll separate myself

Severed and lost
Right from the moment we are brought into this world

We are desstined to exprire
Thatâs not your life youâre living
This is your slowly dying

Death kiss,
Stains everyone and everything
And no one is safe
