This space you left it keeps on haunting
Your hopes and your dreams
Buried deep beneath my feet
With nothing left but your memories
Nothing left
Is it wrong to feel disconnected?
To shut down since you disappeared
Itâs taken the last of me to feel whole
To feel whole again
Save your words Iâm not broken Iâm not broken
This sadness disappears and I feel so empty
As times wasting away
Still I feel so fucking empty
So close to home and I canât feel a thing
Your body is drifting away and still no tears
I feel my heart beating
There is nothing inside of me
No beating heart, no emotions
I canât I donât feel anything
