Take this fate and make it mine
Take this and make it mine...

Hand of god has failed you,
Dealt you the wrong hand...

My heart has already died but my fucking rage keeps me alive
Chaos surrounding me, as I fall from grace

Loveless

Chaos surrounding me, as I fall from grace...
As I fall from grace, I feel this wasting all away,
I can feel the shame
Burning strong inside of me,
Just take it all away, just take the pain away..
This is the end
What would you know about loyalty?
I am dying in this darkness.....
