This town holds the souls of the broken,
Your trapped in a cell called misery...
I won't live like this
Stay true to yourself
I wont live like this...

Be all you can be it means nothing to me,
I try to be the best that I can be....
These are just memories,
They can be forgotten
This war in your heart is not hopeless

When your heart beats let your true self form,
Are you hopeless? Has weakness consumed you?
Let yourself go, Don't ever look back,
Does it scare you? The idea of freedom?
Just bury hope
