Just skies above and dirt below,
Your history will never be known...
Failed and defeated
Everyday I get this sinking feeling,
And I wish for so much more....

This nightmare feels so endless,
I don't think I can make it out
I have spent my years trying to be something I'm not...
Please pull me to safety
I don't think I can make it out and I'm stuck in this dead town

Time is all we have and its not on my side
There is nothing for me here, Give me a reason to hold on..
I don't belong, I'm not you....
I am suffocating in your perfect world
Never make someone a priority when you are just an option
For all the times I did what's right, I wasted myself on you...

I never felt so alone,
I have never felt so low,
I never felt so alone,
I have never felt so low..
And I just keep on sinking into the depths of my soul
