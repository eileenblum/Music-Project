It feels like you're so far away and I am empty without you,
We can never be safe again...
Set my heart on this, Pull me up
Chose this life, I can not keeping holding on..

I try to be the best I can for myself,
In the end you wont be there for me
You wont be there for me
Again and again I sacrifice myself for you, What can I do?
Everything around me is falling apart and I feel so empty
But one day everything will be different

This time things will change..
Everything that makes you smile makes me fucking sick,
Everything we had is dead...
I hope you die alone...
You are fucking worthless, I will bury you....
