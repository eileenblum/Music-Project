when it rains, it fucking pours
and as far as I can see, there is no sun...

this is no way to live,
this is not what I call a life.
but I'll keep climbing until I see the sun
this is no way to live,
this is not what I call home,
but I'll keep climbing until I see the sun.

I did this to myself,
and I'll never know,
I have nothing left

I did this to myself...

another day goes by,
but I'll keep climbing until see the sun..
until I see myself, until I find myself

I count the days that we spent,
you changed my life forever and I'll never forget..

waiting for better days,
I'm waiting for better days...

I'll still savour these days,
and I'll never forget,
I'll still savour these days...

when it rains

(I'm waiting for better days)
