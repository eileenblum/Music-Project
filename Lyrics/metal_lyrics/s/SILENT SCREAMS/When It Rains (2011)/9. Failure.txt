No ones going to save you
Your on your own...

You don't know what I've fucking been through....

Your never going to forget me...
If there's a heaven then why am I still dying here?
I am staring into the headlights ready to be set free...
I cannot find the strength to carry on
You mean nothing to me, Your dead to me
You dream but nothing comes of it...
You just fucking dream....

And when day breaks, I'll choose to savour
That state of faith, I wont drag myself down
I will not die on this ground
This is not where I am going to die
There's more to this
