What difference does a day make, for you and me?
What difference does a day make?
I can barely take the weight and taken for granted,
Hold yourself together, Hold fast
I wont lay down..
Time has lost all meaning, has lost its meaning..
Please believe when I say, I need you...
We are all alone
Your better off wasting away, I'll pick up the pieces
Pick yourself back off the ground,
This is not forever...
I know this is not forever...
