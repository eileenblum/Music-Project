Looking back into this mirror,
I see the life, I could have taken.
I see a hopeless soul, so full of hope

You raise me up, Raise me to die
You raise me up, You promise me the world

And through it all, this ship sails on

No direction, No direction

Lost, I am so fucking lost

And I haven't said a word in days,
I just keep it in my heart.
And I haven't said a word in days,
Those sleepless nights keep repeating...

These sleepless nights, are just endless
Alone
