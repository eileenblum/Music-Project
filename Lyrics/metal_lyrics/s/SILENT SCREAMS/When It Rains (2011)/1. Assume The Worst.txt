This is from the heart,
Your not who you used to be
This weight in my chest, is dragging me deeper, I cant breathe.
I don't want to exist..

So I lay here, silent and thinking, do you even care?
I will wipe my hands clean of you
Shared the air in your lungs for nothing
One day things will be easier...
Searching, Search yourself...
The stars will not align for you
This weight across my chest, it don't carry itself
I cant breathe, your not who you used to be
The stars will not align for you
Everything you are, is nothing...
