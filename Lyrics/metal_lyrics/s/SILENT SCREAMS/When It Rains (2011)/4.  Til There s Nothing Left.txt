And now I'm broken in your eyes,
Just see me again...
Its not the way its suppose to be
Your structures falling apart at the seams,
You will be nothing more than a memory....

I walk this road alone...
I carry these memories that you ruined for me,
I cannot sleep..
Everything in your life has led you to this,
I'm dreaming and my dreams are repeating....
And I have always been held accountable for things I have not done,
No we don't,
We don't have any strength to carry on....
We don't have any strength to carry home?
To carry on...
To carry home?.
I walk this road alone...
