Alone when I wake up
I hear deceitful screams
Coming from a distant land
I run through the silent kingdom
Stained by my scornful mind

A dreadful melody of eternity
Is calling me from my frights

The idle crypt opens its doors
Showing the true colors of oblivion
Soon I'll spread my nightly wings
And finally reach the world
Beckoning my shapeless desires

After the fall of my reason
To the hands of my own will

Withdraw the mask on my face
Reality is soft on my flesh
Walking for the very first time
Toward the sinister grounds from the past

Divine rupture of creation
Past the fates soon to be broke
