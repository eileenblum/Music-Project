Dead in a lost universe
Eyes close, looking in vain
Your howl will never be heard
The hope of a better future in smoke

The echo of your spirit will fall through the ages
Burned by the flames, you're the only one to blame

[Chorus:]
Satirical portrait of mankind
and its potential for self-destruction
In a world without any diseases
and no past, but a future that can't see
The shades of dusk

Feel the sadness of this aimless life for sale
Lay down for the relief of your pain

[Chorus]

The greed of this bliss is killing all your glimpse of a pure reality
Force to watch the world crumble at your feet
Wondering the end of your suffering
