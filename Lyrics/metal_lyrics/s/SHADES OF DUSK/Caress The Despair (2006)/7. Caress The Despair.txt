Your smile paints on these filthy hands
Across the path of forgiveness
By your side, confusion stands
Children born in unconsciousness

They are running through a forbidden land

Killing my pride,
forced to live among those who lied
Hiding my pain when I get used to smile

A river flows down your body
Sinking all your moments of clarity
Climb the stairs up to your fantasy
Your bones start to sing a sweet melody

As your brain screams its symphony
Please play the part of the one who's lost
Leave those who crawl toward the disgust
And let them sleep on a cold cloak of chaos

Thou shall caress the despair
