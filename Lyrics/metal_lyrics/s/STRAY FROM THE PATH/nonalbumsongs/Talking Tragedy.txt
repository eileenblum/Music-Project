we felt the weight, we felt the pain
please wake up, please remember your name
another day, another update
this shits insane, broken bones, all alone, no!

one dead twelve wounded on the interstate
in a back brace and a metal plate
helicopter straight to the ICU
still canât believe its true, be strong pull through.

so many fans, friends, support and love
eleven one nine one five, so thankful youâre alive
TGI till we die, this never meant so much more,
let me tell you what we stand for

if you fall weâll pick you up,
weâre there for you, cause youâd be there for us

it could have been us sharing that bus,
donât move, donât speak, just blink if youâre okay
first response is on its way
whats his condition? simple? critical?
please tell me that its fixable.

so many fans, friends, support and love
eleven one nine one five so thankful youâre alive
TGI till we die, this never meant so much more

lemme tell ya what we stand for

if you fall weâll pick you up,
weâre there for you, cause youâd be there for us

lines frozen in time
suspended in one place
bound and held together
forever, another legend lives on

this song I leave for you from me
another legend lives on
