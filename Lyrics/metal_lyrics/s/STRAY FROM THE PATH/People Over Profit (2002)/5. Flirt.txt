Undermine my heart 
Don't play with my 
Emotions 
Don't play with my heart 
I waited for you until 
Until that day 
That day when my heart 
Turned to stone 
Release my heart 
Release my heart from your 
Release my heart 
Release my heart from your 
Cruel touch 
That day when my 
When my heart turned to stone
