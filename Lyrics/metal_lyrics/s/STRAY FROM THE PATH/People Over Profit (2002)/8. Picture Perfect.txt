I know this whore named democracy 
She'll spread her legs for the highest bidder 
She's about to be fucked to death 
By a multinational demi-god 
I know this this preacher named capitalism 
He speaks off bliss through competition 
He hides a boy, with secrets to tell 
The boy's name, third world 
I know the fucker named neo liberalist 
Handcuffed and gaggeding the back of my caddie 
There's a brick on the gas, 
And about a mile off open road 
About a mile of open road, 
Before the ocean side cliff 
That awaits his arrival 
They! 

Will! 

All! 

Meet! 

Their! 

Demise! 

The smiles collapse when the camera's turn off!
