These words enchant our spirits 
Lighten our hearts 
Never let it die 
Pass it on, pass this on 
I'll never let it die 
We must preserve this spirit 
It's the only thing that can set us free 
From all our worries, let it be 
An emotional release for the ones who need it most 
We're looking for a non-violent solution 
And i hope we all find one 
It brings a tear to my eye, 
When i hear another life thrown away 
Let this spirit live on 
Ill never let it die
