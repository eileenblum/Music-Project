Everything about you 
Defies me. 
Irrational intolerance 
Please for unity 
Meaning less 
As you choose your 
Sides so strategically 
Don't point your finger at me 
You're the one that 
Makes us hate this 
I await the day you feel 
The loneliness i live in 
And when you reach out 
To me in friendship 
Don't mistake my kindness for weakness
