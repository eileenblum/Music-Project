A cover up of the highest scale, they're never caught
The silence is deafening, yeah, it'sâforeverâbought
Word from theâtop, paid to shut up andâtake it
Blame the victims 'cause it's easy to believe that they faked it
A home for abuse in the church of lies
A garden of Eden around a house of ruined lives
A man of the cloth with the choir in his bed
Three thousand strong, but all fucked up in the head

There's a place in hell for bastards like you
There's a place in hell for the bastards like you
There's a place in hell for bastards like you
There's a place in hell for the bastards like you

The power of Christ compels you

Sick fucks in a position of trust
Stakeout by the playground
Waiting for the bus
Three from the pope
Should be swinging from a rope
Six year sentence, out in three with the first vote
The power of Christ compels you
To carry out your evil obsession
The power of Christ compels you
No god will ever hear your confession
Yeah

Violate then escape
They keep you safe within their walls
You can hide in the house of God
But what happens when the fucking cross falls?

What happens when the fucking cross falls?

There's a place in hell for bastards like you
There's a place in hell, you motherfucker

There's a place in hell for bastards like you
There's a place in hell for the bastards like you
There's a place in hell for bastards like you
There's a place in hell for the bastards like you
