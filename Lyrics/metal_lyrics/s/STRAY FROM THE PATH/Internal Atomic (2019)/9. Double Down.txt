[feat. Matt Honeycutt][Matt Honeycutt, Drew York, Both:]
Turmoil
Don't believe their hate
Causing chaos, forced to reap the pain
This nation bleeds, we're sowing theâseeds
Unifyâwhat destroyed theâfucking dream
We told you to getâout, but now you can't leave
No, no
We told you to get out, but now you can't leave

I will never lose sleep
Counting sheep, how 'bout you?
Swing and a miss, where's your follow-through?
Dropping like flies, we don't hide
You know where to find me
Locked away with a lot to say
Empty threats, no price to pay
Try to skew my view
We got eyes on
You know where to find me

You and I are not the same
We'll never let you be a part of our reality
You and I are not the same
We'll never let you be a part of our reality

SS
So shook
Can't take a hint
Can't take a left hook
Double down, motherfucker, I'll be back around
You know where to find me
Picked last in gym class
Keys to the green room, you ain't got a pass
Your pack is getting thin, pissing in the wind
You know where to find me

I'll bring a mic
I'll bring a mic
I'll bring a mic to a gunfight
I'll bring a mic
I'll bring a mic
I'll bring a mic to a gunfight

You and I are not the same
We'll never let you be a part of our reality
You and I are not the same
We'll never let you be a part of our reality
Never

[Matt Honeycutt:]
Teaching
Damage
War zone
In America
Hostile
Past the point of this pointless bullshit

[Matt Honeycutt, Drew York, Both:]
We told you to get out, but now you can't leave
No, no
We told you to get out, but now you can't leave
