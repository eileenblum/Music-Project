The innocent are truly guilty
Complacency is criminal, this shit is not subliminal
The failures in yourâfaceâwhen your eyesâclose
All you know is tunnel vision,âthey don't go where the dark goes
High horses, of course it's easy living where the grass grows
Thoughts and prayers get us nowhere, so fuck what you heard
Actions speak louder than words

How real is your real world?
(You get lost in it, you fail victim to the cause of it)
How real is your real world?
(Two sides polarized social suicide)
How real is your real world?
(You get lost in it, you fail victim to the cause of it)
How real is your real world?
(What's left for the rest of us, huh?)

I watched the earth burn slow
I walked the ground where nothing grows
Everything is nothing, nothing's all they know
Everyone should be your brother but your care is a cover
So put the money where the mouth goes
Thoughts and prayers
Get us nowhere
Fuck what you heard
Actions speak louder than words

How real is your real world?
(You get lost in it, you fail victim to the cause of it)
How real is your real world?
(Two sides polarized social suicide)
How real is your real world?
(You get lost in it, you fail victim to the cause of it)
How real is your real world?
(What's left for the rest of us?)

When there's a knock on the door
Will you answer or ignore?
It starts with you and ends with more
The choice is yours

Change the world
Change the world
Change the world
Change the world
Change the world
