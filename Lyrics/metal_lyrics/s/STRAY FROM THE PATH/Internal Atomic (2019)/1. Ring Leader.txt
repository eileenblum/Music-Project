Thinking like everyone else is not really thinking
Thinking like everyone else is not really thinking
Thinkingâlikeâeveryone else isânot really thinking
Thinking like everyone elseâis not really thinking
Thinking like everyone else is not really thinking
Thinking like everyone else is not really thinking

Fall in line
You obey (You obey)
What they say, they say, they say
Out of time
You can't see the signs
When the blind lead the blind
Smoke out the hives
Let 'em burn, let 'em burn (Burn)
You walk the line
Mimic every word and every turn
Just an echo, echo
You should let go, let go
Imitation is flattery
But this is a tragedy

Have you lost your goddamn mind?
Straitjacket, hypnotized
Have you lost your goddamn mind?
Straitjacket, hypnotized, yeah
Have you lost your goddamn mind?
Straitjacket, hypnotized
Have you lost your goddamn mind?
Straitjacket, hypnotized

Latching on like a leech (Like a leech)
But you don't practice what you preach (What you preach)
Desperate disciples riding the coattail
Dragged through the dirt trail
Dead in the water, lambs to the slaughter
Follow the pack, handed the future from the palm reader
Lost in the swarm, drinking Kool-Aid from the cult leader
Thinking like everyone else is not really thinking
This ship is sinking

Have you lost your goddamn mind?
Straitjacket, hypnotized
Have you lost your goddamn mind?
Straitjacket, hypnotized, yeah
Have you lost your goddamn mind?
Straitjacket, hypnotized
Have you lost your goddamn mind?
Straitjacket, hypnotized

When you're born in this world, you're given a ticket to the freakshow
And when you're born in America, you're given a front row seat

The circus is nothing without the clown
We gave them a stage but we can tear it down

Tear it down
Thinking like everyone else is not really thinking
Thinking like everyone else is not really thinking

Have you lost your goddamn mind?
Straitjacket, hypnotized
Have you lost your goddamn mind?
Straitjacket, hypnotized, yeah

Straitjacket, hypnotized
Have you lost your goddamn mind?
Straitjacket, hypnotized
