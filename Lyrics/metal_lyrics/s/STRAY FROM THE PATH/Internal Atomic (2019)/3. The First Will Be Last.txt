Listen
Hollow words are hollow points
Noise suppression
You don't hear them bang in the night
Apathy is yourâfavoriteâweapon
The color ranâfrom your face
As the blood leftâyour body
Do you know what you've done?
Motherfucker, you should ask somebody

What goes around comes around
When a hand reaches out, you don't reach back
What goes around comes around
The last will be first and the first will be last

The last, first
The first, last
The last, first
The first, last

Look at you now, sound asleep in belly of the beast
Living lavish, the streets run savage
Can't smell the smoke in the breeze
Back to reality (Back to reality)
Hold your apology
Do you know what you've done?
Motherfucker, you should ask somebody

What goes around comes around
When a hand reaches out, you don't reach back
What goes around comes around
The last will be first and the first will be last
What goes around comes around
How could you see this shit and not react?
What goes around comes around
The last will be first and the first will be last
Last

How could you see this shit and not react?
Let me show you suffering

No coward is king
Let me show you suffering
No coward is king
Let me show you suffering

What goes around comes around
When a hand reaches out, you don't reach back
What goes around comes around
The last will be first and the first will be last
The last will be first and the first will be last
The last will be first and the first will be last
