Grace is overworked and she's just about to break down
Showed up late, now the bossâisâfucking let down
Treatedâlike the trash that she's paidâto throw out
Another check skipped by a punk kid with a big mouth
She's sent home, three kids in a townhouse
Bills are overdue, she's never gonna cash out
Daddy skipped town, so she carries the weight
Tell me, who's gonna put food on their plates?

You don't give a goddamn
You've got blood on your hands
You don't give a goddamn
Why can't you just understand?

My cover's not my story
Not everything's so black and white
Black and white
My cover's not my story
My cover's not my story
Not everything's so black and white

"Mary, come inside," Mom and Dad always say
"Don't talk to the neighbors, stay away, stay away
They can't relate to us 'cause they don't pray like us"
Anyway, just go about your life, don't inherit the hate
Now Mary's 25, she grew up
Something's screwed up
Mom don't wanna talk and Dad already blew up
Can't come home, the locks are changed
All because Mary wakes up next to Kate

You don't give a goddamn
You've got blood on your hands
You don't give a goddamn
Why can't you just understand?

My cover's not my story
Not everything's so black and white
Black and white
My cover's not my story
My cover's not my story
Not everything's so black and white, yeah

(My cover's not my story
My cover's not my story)
(My cover's not my story
My cover's not my story)

Turn the page before you burn the book
Take back the life you took
There's more beneath the surface

There's more beneath the surface
There's more beneath the surface
There's more beneath the surface
