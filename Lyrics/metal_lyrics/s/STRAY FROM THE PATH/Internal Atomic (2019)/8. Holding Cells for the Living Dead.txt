Stop shaking
The medication isn't taking
My pulse is racing as symphonies of screams down the corridors
Andâtheâsqueak of theâstretcher on linoleum floors fill theâair with panic
This place is for the savage
A holding cell for the living hells
The drugged and the damaged
I can't hear another empty answer
We need a doctor in the room
She's gone too soon
She's gone too soon

She used to save me from the monsters underneath my bed
How can I save her from the one that's in her head?

A chemical imbalance
No diagnosis
Up the dosage
Up the dosage
Your mood is always swinging
Answer, the phone keeps ringing
It's crossed my mind at least a dozen times
That one day I'll find you hanging from the ceiling, yeah
One day I'll find you hanging from the ceiling

She's gone too soon

She used to save me from the monsters underneath my bed
How can I save her from the one that's in her head?

In her darkest days
I still carry all the weight
She tried to smile today
But everyone looked away
She tried to change her face
But she still feels the same

Stop shaking
Stop shaking
Stop shaking
Stop shaking

Stop shaking
Stop shaking
Stop shaking
Stop shaking
Stop shaking
Stop shaking
Stop shaking
Stop shaking
Stop shaking
