Fire walk with me
Yeah, yeah

I see my father's shadow
My soul is critical
My gut, my gravestone
Fire walk with me
I've talked with ghosts of old
The end to my end is my control
The future's in my bones
Fire walk with me
My hero is my victim
My angle in the system
Messiahs, slave drivers, pensions, prisons
Come on, fire walk with me
Run up, my hand is steady, come test me
From the ground up
Build a bridge, we'll burn it up
Fire walk with me

Fire walk with me
The end to my end is my control
The future's in my bones
Build a bridge, we'll burn it up, come on, yeah
Fire walk with me
Fire walk with me
The end to my end is my control
The future's in my bones
Build a bridge, we'll burn it up
Fire walk with me

(Yeah, yeah)
My fingers feel the fractures
My prophecy, my rapture
The knife that cuts the cancer
Fire walk with me
My fear is not my master
My darkness is my lantern
The question is the answer
Can you fire walk with me?

They can't catch us if we run
They can't catch us if we run
They can't catch us if we run
We don't answer to anyone

We don't answer to anyone
We don't answer to anyone

The end to my end is my control
The future's in my bones (My bones)
The end to my end is my control
The future's in my bones
Fire walk with me
