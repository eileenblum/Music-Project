[feat. Brendan Murphy]I always knew that you'd draw first blood
You take but you don't give
I tried toâliveâand let live,âbut you grew too fat
So nowâI have to cut the head off the tick
Get a grip before you slip on your stepping stones
I see the shiver in your bones
You know the fall is fast
A snake in the grass
Smoke and mirrors, pull the trigger
You're the driver, I'm the car crash

And you'll never see it coming
And you'll never see it coming

Kickback
Feel the kickback
Feel the, feel the
Feel the kickback
Feel the kickback
Feel the kickback
Feel the, feel the
Feel the kickback
Time to cash your reality check
'Cause you're talking out the side of your neck
You let your soul slip through the cracks
Ah, feel the kickback

I don't stress the self-obsessed
Can't get the feeling off your chest
Your head gets bigger by the second
But you know you're only second at best
Dearly departed
This was over before it even started
You know the fall is fast
Another snake in the grass, motherfucker
Smoke and mirrors, pull the trigger
You're the driver, I'm the car crash

And you'll never see it coming
And you'll never see it coming

Kickback
Feel the kickback
Feel the, feel the
Feel the kickback
Feel the kickback
Feel the kickback
Feel the, feel the
Feel the kickback
Time to cash your reality check
'Cause you're talking out the side of your neck
You let your soul slip through the cracks
Ah, feel the kickback

[Brendan Murphy:]
A cure collected from the ears of the immune
Like an insect clinging to an empty vein
With nowhere left to spread your plague
Return to the dirt from which you came
So spare me your sickness
If the venom hangs from hollow fangs
Uncommon extinction
As the swarm goes unsustained

"It's not your fault
It's just who you are"
Bullshit
