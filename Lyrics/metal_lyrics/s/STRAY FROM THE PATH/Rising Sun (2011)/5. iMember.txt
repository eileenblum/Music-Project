And when you're gone we'll hang a black flag
With a lighthouse shining

Nobody should have to settle for this
This is not how it's supposed to be
In one ear and out of the other
This is not how it's supposed to be

Now easy does it, because the kids love it
This is where thoughts go to die
Make no mistake there is nothing the same between you and I

I would never call it jealousy 
Because what you have is not what we came here to need
I would call it sympathy 
Because what you do is a tragedy

You've been given a stage and you choose to use it to pass through a phase
Brainless and mindless like you've been drinking and someone slipped you a bad drug
Stuck on life support and I'm right by your side and I'll pull the plug
I'm right by your side, I'll pull the plug on your shit

And when you're gone we'll hang a black flag
With a lighthouse shining

This is where it ends
I'm sick of all the secrets you've been keeping
And all the kids you've been deceiving
Make no mistake, there is nothing the same between you and I

You, you're just an image for a show
You're just a gimmick with no goals and your intentions are terrible
There's no soul

So lean on your crutch because it must be too hard for you to stand
Spineless and arrogant. Must be hard for you to stand
So ride it out because I know it will be over soon
I won't swallow my pride, and pat the backs of who I despise
I swear this will be over soon

And when you're gone we'll hang a black flag
With a lighthouse shining
