You want a war? Meet the militia
Won't stand around and watch the rich get richer
You ask for more? Here's the big picture
Genocide while the sick get sicker

They say that armies can come in ones and twos
Well I got three friends that want to meet you
Forfeit is not an option in this fight
While my five fingers are clenched this tight

To all my comrades, to my complacent friends
To all those living imprisoned lives until the end
We have each other, this band of brothers
We'll live our lives cause we'll never have another

Enough is enough when you got no one to trust
No more innocent victims in the world that we live in
If we take command I know that we can
Break the system

I never thought that we'd all be in this position
So we sit and wait as we watch and listen
It's time to step up, step up, step up and go the distance
I said get up get up and tear it down

It won't stop it won't it won't stop
We won't stop we won't we won't stop

You want a war? Meet the militia
Won't stand around to watch the rich get richer
We won't stop we won't we won't stop
You ask for more? Here's the big picture
Genocide while the sick get sicker
It won't stop it won't it won't stop

Enough is enough when you got no one to trust
No more innocent victims in the world that we live in
If we take command I know that we can 
Break the system

I know that you and I will meet on the front line
Singing I'm not afraid anymore
I know you and I will meet on the front line
Because this is what we're fighting for

Enough is enough when you got no one to trust
And I can say I'm not afraid anymore
You're on the front line
Wake up
