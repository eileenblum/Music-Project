When I was nineteen I saw my girlfriend get beaten
She had black and blues that revealed the mistreatment
Feeling trapped in hell when you want to escape
Itâs crazy in her eyes itâs a common place

Remember that night there was that fight and I heard those screams from upstairs
Man we were only in our teenage years and fucking alcohol already abused us
It was too much
Bloody mary breakfast, dinner and lunch
Done turning water to wine
You should have never crossed her line
Done turning water to wine
You did this for the last time

This dare I say some might call a family
Run on tears and half-hearted apologies
And forgiveness only given from fear

These common events roll off ice-cold shoulders
Like water on wax
No sweat off your back
But it digs like a thorn in your side
Paralyze paralyzed
I bet a part of you died
I tried so hard to steal the fear from your eyes
Paralyze paralyzed
Felt like a part of me died

Remember the night, the ambulance and the fight?
Tell us what happened there
Weâre in the E.R. and youâre still keeping secrets
We see that gash on your brow
The blood, it was too much
Maryâs bloody cause sheâs drinking too much
Done turning water to wine
You should have never crossed her line
Done turning water to wine
You did this for the last time

When I was nineteen I saw my girlfriend get beaten
She had black and blues that revealed the mistreatment
Feeling trapped in hell when you want to escape
Itâs crazy in her eyes itâs a common place

Too afraid to show your scars
But girl you deserve an applause
No better time than now to stand tall stand strong
Stand tall stand strong
Stand tall stand strong
