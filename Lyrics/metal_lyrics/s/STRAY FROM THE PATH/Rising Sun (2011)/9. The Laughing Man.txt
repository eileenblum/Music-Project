Itâs a trap
And I feel like Iâm under attack
Should I speak the words I mean or should I just hold back?
With so much negativity,
How can you really see the best of me?
â¦And whoâs to blame when blaming is the recipe
A mix of misery and apathy
This is a trap
And I should have seen it coming

â..And thatâs the trouble, you canât ever find a place thatâs peaceful because
there isnât any. You may think there is, but once you get there when youâre not
looking theyâll sneak up and write âFuck Youâ right under your noseâ¦â
[the catcher in the rye]

This is a trap
I feel set up like Iâm under attack
This is a trap
Should I say what I mean
Or should I just hold back?
Youâre the unwanted ones
Youâre the unwanted ones
Misery - Apathy

Today can be the first day of your life
Donât shoot me down just to put us in the same place
Today can be the first day of your life
Wake up today and give this world a new face
Today can be the first day of your life
Today can be the first day of your life
