We are the light that guides you home
The light is always darkest before the dawn

This is the rising sun
It hangs from up above
Blinding the children from the darknesses they've come to love
This is the rising sun
Forget the things you loved
Find the reason and the will to rise above

This is who we are
Screaming out
This is the year of the rising sun

We are the light that guides you home
