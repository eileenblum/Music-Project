If the whole world revolves around you
Then what happens to me,
What about me?
If youâre not content with the ones you loved
What happens to me,
What about me?

Hearts pumping, hearts pumping
Do you know that our heartâs still beating?
Hearts pumping, hearts pumping
Would you know if we even stopped breathing?

How does it feel to reach your goals,
Funded by another
How could you bankrupt the ones
Who put you up while they went under

I refuse to believe
That these material things
Will be enough to feed
Your hungering incessant greed.

Itâs never enough
Itâs never enough for you

Hearts pumping, hearts pumping
Do you know that our heartâs still beating?
Hearts pumping, hearts pumping
Would you know if we even stopped breathing?

So blind that even couldnât make you see
The wealth I need lies within my family

If the whole world revolves around you
Then what happens to me,
What about me?
If youâre not content with the ones you loved
What happens to me,
What about me?

All the money in the world canât buy you a home
All the diamonds in the world and youâre still alone
