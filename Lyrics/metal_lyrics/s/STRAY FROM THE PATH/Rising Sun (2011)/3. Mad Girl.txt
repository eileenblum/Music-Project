You know I've got so much to say
But I'm infected, and youâre the new disease of today
You try and seize the day but your infected,
Youâre the new disease of today
What do you know about relationships?
It's been awhile and I just cant handle this.
Faking smiles, breaking promises,
Somethings wrong and I just cant balance it.
I try and feel the same but in my dreams your all that I see.
You keep her safe but you keep her from me
This is not what I want, this is not what I need.
You know that I know that we're infected
She's still mine she belongs to me 
This is not what I want, this is not what I need. 
You know that I know that we're infected.
I drink too much just to fall asleep, 
Cause in my dreams youâre all I see.
No matter what you did or who fucked 
I'd go through hell for you no matter.
I'd go through hell for you no matter what,
This is not what I want this is not what I need,
No matter what you did or who you fucked,
This is not what I want this is not what I need,
I'd go through hell for you no matter what,
This is not what I want this is not what I need.
No matter what you did or who you fucked 
I'd go through hell for you no matter what.
This isn't over this isn't over
Theres something left in me
This isn't over this isn't over
And I hope you feel the same
I'll show you no love
