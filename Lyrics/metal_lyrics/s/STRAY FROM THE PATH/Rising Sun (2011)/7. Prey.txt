You claim to be this false identity
But I can only see a villain, an enemy
Get off your knees, it shouldn't matter if you believed
Spit down the throat of the man that made you
and laugh in the face of the man that saved you.

Break the needle from it's eye, Did you think that you would pass through?
You fucking know!
Separate the blood from it's lover and the romance dies too.

I see you laugh when you pray
I see no virtue in the words that you say
I've questioned your faith for days and days
Born again but you can't be saved

You spread the word because you think that you must
living by the words "In God We Trust"
But we don't trust you

You can cash your checks from the good book
so you can buy yourself a crown
Just sign your name on the cross and turn it upside down

Liars, Thieves, Villains, Enemies

Set your wings that have carried you this far to flames

Spit down the throat of the man that made you
and laugh in the face of the man that saved you

Break the needle from it's eye, Did you think that you would pass through?
You fucking know!
Separate the blood from it's lover and the romance dies too.

If that white light would shine brighter
Than I'd love to watch you burn
