When there was a sickness, there was a cure
Right outside on the streets at the record store
There once were heros that we looked up to
We never thought that we would do the things that they'd do

Their presence is long gone
Disconnected from the world that we grew up on
Nothing will ever make as much of an impact
When you hear these words will they make you react

When there was a sickness, there was a cure
Right outside on the streets at the record store
There once were heros that we looked up to
We never thought that we would do the things that they'd do

'Cause if this world is all about digital lives
I can say that I'm ready to die
One time, when you need to be saved
With a kick and a push you can get away
One time, when you need to be saved
You can go and get lost in a mixtape

'Cause if this world is all about digital lives
I can say that I'm ready to die

Since we can't live in yesterday
Say goodbye to the past as the world turns grey
Since we can't live in yesterday
We can look to the future but it's all the same
This generation has gone up in flames
Because with all hope gone there is no cause for a change
We know it's inside us all and the world has made it harder
To latch onto the sound of being set free

Disconnected from the world that we grew up on
Bring it back to the streets
