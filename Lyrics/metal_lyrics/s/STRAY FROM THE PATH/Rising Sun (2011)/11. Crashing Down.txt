Burning bridges connect me to this city
Street lights go out I'm lost but I'm free
There's a pain in my heart on this lonely road
Wherever I wake up I'll have to call it home

I can't pretend that I am something that I am not
But the life that I had chose is all that I got
And I feel alive

I'm never there and I'm sorry I'm not
Don't listen to them when they say I forgot
When I left it wasn't goodbye
I'm still here I never left your side

Familiar streets I can't find them now
A different city, a different town
Sing the songs of it crashing down
Wishing I was Long Island bound
But I've lost my way back to these unfamiliar grounds
Sing the songs of it crashing down

Burning bridges connect me to this city
Street lights go out I'm lost but I'm free
There's a pain in my heart on this lonely road
Wherever I wake up I'll have to call it home

I can't pretend that I am something that I am not
But the life that I had chose is all that I got
... And I feel alive

So let's all sing songs of it crashing down
Wishing I was Long Island bound
