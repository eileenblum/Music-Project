You had us fooled from the start.
Give it up, give it up we finally know who you are
You had us fooled from the start.
Give it up, give it up
No one wanted you here,
and no one fucking cared.

You've burned every bridge we built,
but you managed to gain your ground.
Hope you got what you came here for,
I hope you're satisfied with getting left behind.

Looks like your mouth got the best of you,
fraudulent intentions got the best of you
Looks like your mouth got the best of you,
fraudulent intentions got you nowhere fast
Looks like your mouth got the best of you,
give it up you fake mother fucker.

If it was me we would have left you there,
that shits no dice get the fuck out of here.
If it was up to me we would have left you there.
Fuck you.

This is my favorite part,
this is where you fall apart, downward
downward from here

You had us fooled from the start.
Give it up, give it up we finally know who you are
You had us fooled from the start.
Give it up, give it up
Looks like your mouth got the best of you,
fraudulent intentions got you nowhere fast
Looks like your mouth got the best of you,
give it up you fake mother fucker.

You've had it coming to you
I hope you're satisfied with getting left behind.
You've had it coming to you
I hope you're satisfied

Give it up, give it up, give it up
You've had it coming for you,
You've had it coming.
