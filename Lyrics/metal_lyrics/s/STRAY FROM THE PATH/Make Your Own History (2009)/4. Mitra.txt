I've become so detached from the things that were once so important to me,
brick walls in the road trying hard to remember,
but never asking to forget.
And I ask you help me never to forget
and when you ask my brother if he knows my name
I assure you that the answer will be you know "I don't think we ever met."

It's time to let go,
bury the past 
but not to forget the times that we had
but I can look back at everything we've done back then
let go..
I've done all that I can.

Now when I reach our you run to your nearest haven
when I look into your eyes I almost feel embarrassed.

I've done all that I could,
but you're ripping things away
so weak and so powerful
so content with the lies you say.

But I don't know if its the feeling of defeat
that is stinging my heart.
Or is it the void inside of me that is asking to be filled.
I never thought that I could feel this way before
and now I find myself never asking to forget

It's time to let go,
bury the past 
but not to forget the times that we had
good lives when you know there's nothing left to hold
Let go I've done all that I can.

So weak so powerful
So content with the lies you say.
