You've been waiting so long to find it in yourself that you have nothing.
You've been trying to find yourself through the years 
From the start to the finish line.
And I can say I have been honest with you,
but you're not gonna listen,
you don't ever listen.

Make your own, make your own history,
leave behind your legacy.
Make your own, make your own
Make your own history
leave behind, leave behind your legacy.

Blindly following footsteps before you know it.
Traveled closer to your own death.
Through the years you've misplaced identities.
A hybrid of lies and apologies,
think for yourself.
Prove to everyone that your life means something,
do you want to be alive?

Make your own, make your own history,
leave behind your legacy.
Make your own, make your own
Make your own history
leave behind, leave behind your legacy.

Stop trying to be something that you're not.
Start thinking with your heart and focus on what you got.
Make your mark on the world, 
Because the only lives that count are the ones that make an impact.

To live a life is to be profound,
pick yourself up get your feet off the ground,
no use for everything to be handed to you,
the higher the better it doesn't matter what you do.

Make your own history.
Make your own history.
Make your own history.
Make your own history.
Make your own history.
Make your own.
