So come on, come on, come on,
this is a social let down,
these are the things that I've been dying to say.
these are the things that have been ending one minute at a time.
If misery loves company, then maybe I'll just sleep alone.

Hey Hey
Hey Hey Manipulator
Hey Hey

I'll keep you in mind.
These are some of the things I've been dying to say.
If misery loves company, then maybe I'll just sleep alone.
If misery loves company, you can find me in a crowded room.

In the years I've spent alive, I'm finding hope and disappointment, 
nobody wins this race, high hopes will only hurt you.  
So when the word and everyone in it, turns their back on your, 
that's when you'll know, that's when you'll fucking know 
that you've got the word in the palm of your hand.

It goes Fuck my life,
I said fuck my life and this misery,
Fuck my life, singing fuck my life,
I'm not sleeping alone.
