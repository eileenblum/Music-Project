Yeah!

To all our fallen comrades,
you've played a part in this.
To all our fallen comrades
don't you forget the day we started this.

Close your eyes as it starts to fade,
do you regret the changes that we made?
I hope you find some comfort while you're at home.
I don't blame you,
I don't hold a grudge on you,
I will not look down upon you,
and I won't hold you down.
I swear we'll never forget your names.

To all our fallen comrades,
you've played a part in this.
To all our fallen comrades
don't you forget the day we started this.

Leaving this all behind and starting over.
Leaving this all behind and starting over.
Breaking this chain of strength, starting over,
this is what we chose.
The changes that we made,
these roads become our home away from home.
Always away from home.
Always away from home.

I swear I'll never forget your name,
I swear we'll never forget your name
We've brought this further than we ever thought we could.
We've brought this further than we ever thought we could.
