When that one thing that you wanted,
becomes the reason your falling,
remember nothing worth having comes easy,
So find a reason in you.

When that one thing that you wanted,
becomes the reason your falling,
remember nothing worth having comes easy,
So find a reason in you.
Turn it up!

So keep your head in the game, 
no need for shallow obscenities,
shine through misfortunes and memories,
When you feel like you've just had enough,
shit gets rough, don't give up,
stop feeling like you're failing.

When that one thing that you wanted,
becomes the reason you're falling.
I'll shine through misfortunes and memories,
