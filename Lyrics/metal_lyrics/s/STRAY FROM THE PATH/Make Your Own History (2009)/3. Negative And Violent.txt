How easy is it to go through life disregarding everything.
Thoughtlessness flows in a time where wrong is right.
Yeah I'm gonna prove you wrong,
let me tell you about your flaws, I know them all
staring at the screen not saying what you mean
there's gotta be more to life than complaining
there's gotta be more that you can offer.
Let me tell you about your flaws.

Everyone is all the same, everyone you know.
Hiding. Watching. Waiting.
You've built this anger because you don't want to put any effort 
into saying something worth saying.

Negative and violent, we're all so important.

Let me tell you about your flaws, I see them all.
Everyone is all the same, everyone you know.
Hiding. Watching. Waiting.
There's gotta be more to life than complaining

Negative and violent
Negative and violent
Negative and violent
Negative and violent
We're all so important
