Keep driving them up as much as you can
and we'll keep driving them off 
just as long as the cash flow keeps moving
 makes no difference to them anyway.

You're reaching records at a rapid pace
and you've brought heartlessness at an all time high.
This cute little tease that you have going on
I bet all seems like a joke to you.

Giving us hope for a little bit of time
just to go flip on our lives again.
Giving us hope for a little bit of time
just to go flip on our lives again.

They continue to ignore the fact that these are our lives.
But through thick and thin you won't keep us down.
They continue to ignore the fact that these are our lives.
But through thick and thin you won't keep me down.
Three digits later need to fill it again
from our cards to their hands that are covered in their sin.

I hope it fills the hole where your heart was
so we can stop seeing right through you,
so we can stop seeing right through you.
Keep driving them up as much as you can
Keep driving them up as much as you can
Keep driving them up as much as you can
Keep driving them up as much as you can
