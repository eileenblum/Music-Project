What gives you the right to think that you can come and save me?
Picture perfect world, I picture violence in disguise.
I'll save my breath for something real as you look towards the sky,
pray forgiveness this ends tonight.

I've been awake for 40 days and 40 nights and I just can't stop dreaming
I've been awake for 40 days and 40 nights and I just can't stop dreaming
Restless I found your weakness.
Restless I found your weakness.

I can tell that you have been under his control.
Making subtle movements being oppressed inside your home.
Wearing this mask to hide yourself from the world.
Falling short, pray forgiveness.

I am a demon so deliver me from this.
From this, I'm in.
I am a demon so deliver me from this.
From this, I'm in.
From this moment on, I see a world shattered and cold,
I see the problems, I see the broken homes.

And it's all starting to get old,
all this good news is bad news just waiting to unfold.
And it's all starting to get old,
all this good news is so old.

I'm not listening.
We're not listening.
I'm not listening.
We're not listening.

We all will die alone.
I've been awake for 40 days and 40 nights and I just can't stop dreaming
I've been awake for 40 days and 40 nights and I'm so
Restless I found your weakness.
Restless I found your weakness.

I am a demon so deliver me from this.
I am a demon so deliver me
from this very moment
from this very moment
I am a demon so deliver me from this.
I see the problems.
I see the broken homes.
Restless, I found your weakness
