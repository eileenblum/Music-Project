Where will I be in ten years?
Not where I thought that's for sure
What made me think, I knew it all
Uncompromising, twenty-something
What mattered became, what doesn't matter anymore
Where will I be in ten years?
Not where I thought that's for sure
What made me think, I knew it all
Some jaded old man
Will nothing matter when death is knocking at my door?

(And he will surely come
And he will surely come)

Death won't wait and regret doesn't suit me well
I fully admit I've become what I've always hated
Death won't wait, but I'll tell you I thought it did
I never thought I'd be struggling, fighting to the-
Death won't wait, jaded or not
All that matters is a change with the best intentions
Death won't wait, in this revolutionary state
Where I can't seem to break down misconceptions

These eyes have seen the world
And it will always be a part of me
I've had time to stop and think
And it's left me here still questioning

Where will I be in ten years?
Not where I thought that's for sure
What made me think, I knew it all
Uncompromising, twenty-something
What mattered became, what doesn't matter anymore

Where will I be in ten years?
Not where I thought that's for sure
What made me think, I knew it all
Some jaded old man
Will nothing matter when death is at my door?

No more, no more, no more, no more
When death comes knocking at my door
No more, no more, no more, no more
What mattered became what doesn't matter anymore

And he will surely come

These eyes have seen the world
And it will always be a part of me
I've had time to stop and think
And it's left me here still questioning

No more, no more, no more, no more
When death comes knocking at my door
No more, no more, no more, no more
What mattered became what doesn't matter anymore

No more, no more
No more, no more
When death comes knocking at my door
No more, no more
What mattered became what doesn't matter anymore
