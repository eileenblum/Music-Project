[feat. Jason Aalon Butler Of Letlive]We were the best of friends
But you don't need me in the end
You fooled me once, that won't be happening again
We were the best of friends
She's playing games with your head
She fooled you twice, I'll never see my friend again

We were the best of friends
But you don't need me in the end
You fooled me once, that won't be happening again
We were the best of friends
She's playing games with your head
She fooled you twice, I'll never see my friend again
We were the best of friends
But you don't need me in the end
You fooled me once, that won't be happening again
We were the best of friends
She's playing games with your head
She fooled you twice, I'll never see my friend again

Like the skin of a snake, you shed my friend
My fingers they ache, but I still press send
I know you're alone yet you still won't pick up your phone
You're lost in this world looking around for your backbone

Flashing back to the times where we spent
Every hour of every day, where nothing got in our way (in our way)
Flashing back, I wonder what those times even meant
Every hour of every day and now you don't have much to say

I know you're so alone
I know you're so alone

We were the best of friends
But you don't need me in the end
You fooled me once, that won't be happening again
We were the best of friends
She's playing games with your head
She fooled you twice, I'll never see my friend again
We were the best of friends
But you don't need me in the end
You fooled me once, that won't be happening again
We were the best of friends
She's playing games with your head
She fooled you twice, I'll never see my friend again

("Yo Jay, when was the last time you talked to him?"
"To be honest I couldn't even tell you, it's been a minute. I bet you he's caught up with homegirl"
"It's such a shame too, because that girl treats him like shit"
"You know what, Drew, you're right")

You're a leaf in the fall, I've watched it change
Into something you've always hated, that filled you with rage
But I see that it isn't you, this person I kinda know
I hope that you fade away as fast as the wind blows
And she's the queen of hearts, with an ace up her sleeve
And you gave her a diamond kid, because she made you believe

Flashing back to the times where we spent
Every hour of every day, where nothing got in our way (in our way)
Flashing back, I wonder what those times even meant
Every hour of every day and now you don't have much to say

We were the best of friends
But you don't need me in the end
We were the best of friends (you were my nigga)
She's playing games with your head
We were the best of friends
Fuck!
But you don't need me in the end
OK, OK
We were the best of friends
She's playing games with your head
