Start moving your feet, don't just run your mouth
Recognition is weighing you down
(Without a doubt) You're always skipping a beat with no sound
It's so hard keeping up, keeping up with the crowd
Start moving your feet (moving your feet), and don't just run your mouth
(without a doubt) just skipping a beat with no sound
It's so hard keeping up, keeping up with the crowd

And now I'm stuck here wondering how you think it's fine
To put your heart into something for such a short time
Smiles, cheers and high fives, I'm surprised
It's enough in life just to get by
Notoriety is your motivation
High society crumbles with no foundation
(Be prepared) In a country that cries wolf, faking the heart
There hides a beast and he will tear you apart

Post that pic with a hashtag
You wanna get mentioned because you need the attention
And you can repost this, 'cause I don't give a shit
If you got something to say, well you can tag me in it
Post that pic with a hashtag
You wanna get mentioned because you need the attention
And you can repost this, but do you give a shit?
No matter what they say, we know you'll follow it
So follow this, come on

Start moving your feet, don't just run your mouth
Recognition is weighing you down
(Without a doubt) You're always skipping a beat with no sound
It's so hard keeping up, keeping up with the crowd
Start moving your feet (moving your feet), and don't just run your mouth
(without a doubt) just skipping a beat with no sound
It's so hard keeping up with the crowd

Now you're facing the changes while everyone is complaining
Your time is nothing but wasted, I hope it tears you apart
Running for cover like everyone and their mother
But in the end you will suffer, so was the flag worth your heart?
Was the flag worth your heart?

In a country that cries that wolf, faking the heart
There lies a beast and he will tear you apart
In a country that cries that wolf, faking the heart
There lies a beast and he will tear you apart
In a country that cries that wolf, faking the heart
There lies a beast and he will tear you apart
I hope he tears you apart

Don't look, don't look, don't look this wolf in the eyes
You're just a sheep like the others
Running for cover like everyone and their mother
Don't look this wolf in the eyes
You're just a sheep like the others
Running for cover, run for cover

Start moving your feet, don't just run your mouth
Recognition is weighing you down
(Without a doubt) You're always skipping a beat with no sound
It's so hard keeping up, keeping up with the crowd
Start moving your feet (moving your feet), and don't just run your mouth
(without a doubt) just skipping a beat with no sound
It's so hard keeping up, keeping up with the crowd
