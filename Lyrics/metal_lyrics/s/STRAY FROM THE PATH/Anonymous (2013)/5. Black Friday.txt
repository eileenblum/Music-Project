There is something in the air I can tell that it's not right
Tonight anything goes after midnight
Watch your back
The world has lost control
Cars full of people who would sell their soul
As they gather far and wide like a cattle
Armed with their wallets, loaded guns for a battle
Look out
I'm still waiting for he world to see
What this life is supposed to mean

You can't buy me I'm not for sale (I'm not for sale)
Money won't buy a heart of gold
They're fresh out
They were free with self control
You can't buy me I'm not for sale (I'm not for sale)
Money won't buy a heart of gold
They're fresh out
They were free with self control

Is there anybody out there?
Does anybody care?
Is there anybody out there?

I would rather have nothing than this
I would rather have nothing than miss (have nothing)
what I really care for, what I'd die for
Rip out my hair for, mothers cry for
Appreciation for the shit you've got
Appreciated is what you're not
I won't be bought

You can't buy me I'm not for sale (I'm not for sale)
Money won't buy a heart of gold
They're fresh out
They were free with self control
You can't buy me I'm not for sale (I'm not for sale)
Money won't buy a heart of gold
They're fresh out
They were free with self control

It goes ,it goes
One for the money
Two for the money
Forget about the Third world
They ain't hungry
Four closed homes
Five missed payments on
Six loans
The dumbest people with the smartest phones
(The dumbest people with the smartest phones, haha)

I fear
Scared that you won't
Next year
You're still ungrateful
It will
I bet that it will
(Be worse) Be worse

Let me express what I'm thankful for
I'm twenty-five, full of pride
Surrounded by the ones I love

I fear
Scared that you won't
Next year
You're still ungrateful
It will
I bet that it will
(Be worse) Be worse

You should all be shameful for
shopping lines, stolen lives
You're still my material whore

American Greed
Too many people buying too many things
They don't even need, they're just following lead
American Greed
Too many people buying too many things
They don't fucking need, it's just American Greed

Everything must go
Tonight, tonight
The world's lost control
Tonight, tonight
Anything goes
Tonight, tonight
We won't be bought or sold
Tonight, tonight
