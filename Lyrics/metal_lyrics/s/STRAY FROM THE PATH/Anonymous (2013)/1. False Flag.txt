Red, White and Blue won't look out for you
F E A R you listening?
Land of the free? Where is our liberty?
F E A R you listening?
Red, White and Blue won't look out for you
F E A R you listening?
Land of the free? where is our liberty?

We the people just wanna feel safe
By destroying ourselves and everything in our way
We the people live in fear and faith
While we struggle to get by on a minimum wage
We the people just wanna feel safe
By destroying ourselves and everything in our way
We the people live in fear and don't wanna break the chains
we're enslaved by our ignorant ways

We are... we are, we are hopeless, the only ones to blame
feeding on the wounds, living off the remains
We are lab rats, for a routine test
Turning the wheel, doing what we do best
We are hopeless, the only ones to blame
Scared to death and so conveniently tamed
So stay calm, don't wanna rattle the cage
Don't wanna wake up the snake, he hasn't eaten in days

The TV screen is spreading disease
Check your head
Before you know it, you bought their scheme
Now you're dead
We are programmed, mindless role-players
Be aware
I spill my guts for you and I'll spell it out for you

We the people just wanna feel safe
By destroying ourselves and everything in our way
We the people live in fear and faith
While we struggle to get by on a minimum wage

F E A R you listening?

F E A R you listening?
Land of the free? where is our liberty?

This just in
so don't touch that dial, this is not your regularly scheduled program
(We are under attack)
The suits and ties are full of lies, they don't have our back
(We are under attack)

So lock your doors and hammer nails in the boards
cover your windows baby, here comes the storm
Here comes the storm

The TV screen is spreading disease
Check your head
Before you know it, you bought their scheme
Now you're dead
We are programmed, mindless role-players
Be aware
I spill my guts for you and I'll spell it out for you
