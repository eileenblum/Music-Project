It's time, it's time to say good bye
I'm not staying here, I'm not staying
While you're waiting, I'm gonna live my life
You've built this prison and the clock is ticking

We're all dying?
No, we're already dead
I haven't breathed since the first time you said,
"I'm gonna change (I'm gonna change), I'm gonna change for good"
But every time we talk I still hear you say,
"I know that I'm better"
Yeah, well that's not enough, you say,
"I'll try to be better"
Yeah, well show me what's up
Because the clock is ticking, it's ticking today
Coming closer and closer to throwing your life away

I've escaped this prison
Now the clock's hands are mine
I've escaped this prison
I can see the sun rise

It's time to say goodbye
I'm not staying here, I'm not staying
While you're waiting, I'm gonna live my life
You've built this prison and the clock is ticking
It's time, it's time to say good bye
I'm not staying here, I'm not staying
While you're waiting, I'm gonna live my life
You've built this prison and the clock is ticking

Yeah I'm doing fine
Doing fine like I walked on land mine
I wanna scream like the day I was born
Gonna start making changes, I'm not sorry anymore (I'm not sorry)
And Yeah I've failed before
But you can see me die trying, never scared of being poor
Never bent for the rich, never gave a shit
When will you listen to this?
You sorry son of a... aah fuck it

You say you have all you need
But you're losing it all
And I refuse to be the one
That's gonna watch you fall

I've escaped this prison
Now the clock's hands are mine
I've escaped this prison
I can see the sun rise

Are we all dying?
No, we're already dead
Are we all dying?
No, we're already dead
I haven't breathed since the first time you said,
Are we all dying?
No, we're already dead
Are we all dying?
No, we're already dead

Right? Come on

It's time, it's time to say good bye
I'm not staying
It's time, it's time to live your life
'Cause the world's not waiting
