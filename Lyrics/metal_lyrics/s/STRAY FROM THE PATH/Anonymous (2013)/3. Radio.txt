[feat. Jesse Barnett Of Stick To Your Guns]So go on and be what they told you to be
they didnât have faith in me
And now Iâm ending up on the radio
So go on, go on and be what they told you to be
They didnât have faith in me
And now Iâm ending up on the radio

I saw you laughing when I chose my path
Just some young punk kid always skipping class
I know thatâs what you thought, what you bought but you got it wrong
Look at me now Iâm still singing the same songs
Family wants to talk like they know whatâs best
Outdated wisdom Iâm not at all impressed
I see clear intentions to make me feel less
Iâve only just begun to get this off my chest

I did it, I've made it
Iâm a rolling stone and you hate it
Admit it, you're fading
You've missed your train and Iâm the one that youâre blaming
So go on and be what they told you to be
They didn't have faith in me
And now I'm ending up on the radio

I did it, I've made it
Iâm a rolling stone and you hate it
Admit it, you're fading
You've missed your train and Iâm the one that youâre blaming
But I'm ending up on the radio

So go on and be what they told you to be
they didnât have faith in me
And now Iâm ending up on the radio
So go on, go on and be what they told you to be
they didnât have faith in me
And now Iâm ending up on the radio

Now Iâm laughing, hahaha!
So out of gas on the verge of breaking down
close to crashing on the side of the road
You'll never get out of this town
Coming clean suppose to be behind me
Out of touch so you judge me blindly
Here we are, here we stand the new breed of success
Feeling good because itâs finally off my chest


I did it, I've made it
Iâm a rolling stone and you hate it
Admit it, you're fading
You've missed your train and Iâm the one that youâre blaming
So go on and be what they told you to be
They didn't have faith in me
And now I'm ending up on the radio

Get up, get up!

You think your lifeâs a hit song
No one is singing along
You think your lifeâs a hit song
No one is singing along
You think your lifeâs a hit song
No one is singing along
You think your lifeâs a hit song
No one, no one is singing along
