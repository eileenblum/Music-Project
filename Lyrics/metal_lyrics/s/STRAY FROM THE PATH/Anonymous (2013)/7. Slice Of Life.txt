You've masked all meaning with some pros
You're caught
I don't even think you know, we've got the evidence concrete
You're sinking with cement on your feet

It must be lonely on the ocean floor
It must be lonely on the ocean floor

There's no separation when you're all on board
Blending in the shadows while the sun is blinding
Leaving an open mind on shore
It makes me think (it makes me think), what other secrets you're hiding
Striving to be the unapproachable
The king on a dead throne of lies
Preaching and speaking with no proof of the truth to the youth
With impressionable eyes

Be afraid, be very afraid

Be afraid, be very afraid
And you should fear me (fear me)
No telling what I'll do, 'cause I know the real you
And now you're drowning
You have no sense of yourself in the sea of lost identity

With an army behind you, there's power inside you
But when you're alone, I bet you're not so hard
With an army behind you, there's power inside you
But when you're alone, I bet you're not so hard

You've masked all meaning with some pros
You're caught
I don't even think you know, we've got the evidence concrete
You're sinking with cement on your feet

It must be lonely on the ocean floor
It must be lonely on the ocean floor

You jump ship real quick to stay ahead of the trend
You tell yourself you like it but we know you pretend
So down to earth, closer to the hardcore
It must be lonely on the ocean floor

It must be lonely
It must be lonely on the ocean floor
(It must be lonely)
It must be lonely on the ocean floor
(It must be lonely)
It must be lonely on the ocean floor
(It must be lonely)
It must be lonely on the ocean floor
It must be lonely
It must be lonely

With an army behind you, there's power inside you
But when you're alone, I bet you're not so hard
With an army behind you, there's power inside you
But when you're alone, I bet you're not so hard

It must be lonely on the ocean floor
