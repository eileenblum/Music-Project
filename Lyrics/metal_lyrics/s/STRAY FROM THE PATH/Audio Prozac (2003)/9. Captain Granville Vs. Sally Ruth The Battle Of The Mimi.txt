We were promised weapons of untold horror.
Where did they go?
Or were they ever even there.
Maybe this wasn't about weapons.
Maybe this was about something else.
Maybe they died for darker skies.
Maybe they died for the rich to get richer.
Maybe they died for bigger cars and lower prices.
You are killing us all.
