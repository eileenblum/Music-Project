The ultimate act of divinity as well as man's greatest contribution.
To society is doubtedly consumerism made more convenient.
So mold your truth for us.
Pretty shapes; appealing; accessible; consumable,
A wonderful commodity.
Feed us your hand made sculptures, all of us. Let's lineup at the trough.
Mass mastication. Grow fat.
Eat, work, sleep, work, buy, and work.
(When all of the sudden I just didn't feel like breathing anymore)
What a wonderful death we are born into.
