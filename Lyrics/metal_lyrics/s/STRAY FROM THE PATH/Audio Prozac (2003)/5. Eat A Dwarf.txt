Riddled by your actions.
Vexed by your words.
Pleased by your wounds.
Your screams will not be heard.
I'll be smiling when you die.
My teeth will gleam when I break your seams.
I bestow upon you the knife from my back.
Grotesque images invading my dreams.
Unaware of their cause still I act upon them.
My heart was been broken for the last time.
