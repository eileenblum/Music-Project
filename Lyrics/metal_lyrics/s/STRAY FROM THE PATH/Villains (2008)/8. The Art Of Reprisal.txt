Burn this building down.
Do it now, do it now.
Fighting for our people 
That never see the truth.

So who's the big shot now?
So who's the big shot now?
I see.
I see the dream it's right.
I see the dream.

We see people in the streets chasing the dream.
We never had a clue,
So what the fuck can we do?
I see the dream, it's right.
I see the dream, it's right in front of me.
I see the dream it's fucking gold.
Oh God.
Oh God damn me.
Oh God damn me.
Oh God damn me:  the art of reprisal.
Oh God damn me.
Oh God damn me.
Oh God damn me:  the art of reprisal.
