Dedicate my life to my fucking work.
Tonight is my night.
Tonight I got myself a knife.
And I'm fine.
Paycheck to paycheck, 
And I'm fine.
I said baby let's do it all over again.
I said baby let's do it all over again.

Tonight is my night.
Tonight is your night.
Tonight is the night where the wolves come out and dance.
Right now I feel so God damn rock n' roll.

I'm getting closer.
I'm getting closer.
I'm getting closer.
I'm getting closer.
Closer.
Closer.
Closer.
