I'm sorry for these high expectations.
I'm sorry for these exchanging of words,
I have no feelings. 
I'm running out.

It's the changing of the times.
It's about time to change your life--
And it's only getting worse.
And it's only getting worse.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
I owe you everything.
I showed you everything.
So dry your fucking eyes cause 
God won't save you tonight.
So dry those pretty fucking eyes
cause I'll give you something to believe in.

Who's your savior?
Who's your savior?
Who's your savior?
