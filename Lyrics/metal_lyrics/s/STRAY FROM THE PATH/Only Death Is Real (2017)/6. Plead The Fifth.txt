Man, you can't fix stupid
I tried to hear you out, you just fucking blew it
Man, you can't fix stupid
Now I think I'm gonna lose it
Yeah I'm gonna fucking lose
Shut your mouth, I'm done with you
Pointing fingers, I'm flip one right back at you
Shut your mouth, I'm done with you
Yeah you're done and the world moves on without you
Point and look, their beliefs come from a different book
Scared and shook about all the lives you think they took
False pride, worldwide
Incidents on every front page and every headline
Take a second, identify the message
Over a hundred hate crimes post-election, yup!
Ladies and gentlemen, the court is now in session
We raise red flags, while we pledge the one in question
911 â this is not a test, propaganda pushes terror as a threat
Shut your mouth, I'm done with you
Pointing fingers, I'm flip one right back at you
Shut your mouth, I'm done with you
Yeah you're done and the world moves on without you
False Evidence Appearing Real (FEAR)
Set up the green screen and put a Muslim at the scene
We always take what we want
Yeah we rob and steal
Every village we bomb, it's just part of the deal
Welcome to the melting pot, motherfucker
If you don't like it, then get the fuck out
It's written like a script
While the country pleads the fifth
Yeah, it's written and it's fixed
While the country pleads the fifth
911 â this is not a test, propaganda pushes terror as a threat
Man, you can't fix stupid
I tried to hear you out, you just fucking blew it
Man, you can't fix stupid
Now I think I'm gonna lose it
Yeah I'm gonna fucking lose
Shut your mouth, I'm done with you
Pointing fingers, I'm flip one right back at you
Shut your mouth, I'm done with you
Yeah you're done and the world moves on without you
