[feat. Keith Buckley]Strange fiction
My life's a plot so twist with me
Strange fiction
Nothing more than a tragedy
Strange fiction
I just exist in a memory
Strange fiction
My life's a plot so just twist with me
One step forward, ten steps back
First in line on the wrong train track
Life's a sad story I'll never learn
Turn the page? I'd rather watch it burn
Another dead end, always in trouble
It's like I got the wrong pieces to a fucking puzzle
Dead to the world, go get a shovel
It's like I got the wrong pieces to a fucking puzzle
Strange fiction
My life's a plot so twist with me
Strange fiction
Nothing more than a tragedy
Strange fiction
I just exist in a memory
Strange fiction
My life's a plot so just twist with me
Elapsed in judgement â elapsed in time
Have I become a myth in your mind?
Stuck on hold â nobody calls
Was it fucking worth it after all?
Another dead end, always in trouble
It's like I got the wrong pieces to a fucking puzzle
Dead to the world, go get a shovel
It's like I got the wrong pieces to a fucking puzzle
You know my name, not my story
You've heard what I've done, in all of its glory
So dance with me for a day and you'll finally see
All that I know is fucking misery
You wanna run with the wolves?
You better learn how to track that blood, boy
I see you clutching your pearls
Go back inside, this is not your hunt
Go on. Pray for yourself. Go on. Pray or our sins
Go on. Pray for the world. Go on.
Tell your god you found it all means nothing
