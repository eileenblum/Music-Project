"Greatest country in the world"
What the fuck do you mean?
"Greatest country in the world"
Agree to disagree
Fabric won't define me (no fuck that)
March behind it, blindly (won't be doing that)
Grab hold that flag pole, grip tight and squeeze
Wave that flag, that was made overseas
The loudest in the room
Leads us to our doom
Self-determined to self-destruct
Unaware of your damage, you close-minded fuck
"Greatest country in the world"
What the fuck do you mean?
"Greatest country in the world"
Agree to disagree
The first step in solving a problem is knowing there is one
(Lord knows there is one)
Taught to take pride in shit that's not yours
How could you hate someone that you've never met before?
The loudest in the room
Leads us to our doom
Self-determined to self-destruct
Unaware of your damage, you close-minded fuck
Join or die? I won't pick a side
Won't lay down my life for an invisible line
Join or die? I won't pick a side
Pledge no allegiance
