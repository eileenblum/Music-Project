Everything has its price
But the price is wrong bitch
The future was written on a cashed check
Like there's nothing to lose on an all in bet
Fear and loathing, so fucking sadistic
Play the people like a game, they're a fucking statistic
Born to lose, bound to fall
A dog running in circles never catches his tail
Rob the poor to feed the rich and push that agenda
'Cause you're Donnie's bitch
Everything has a price
But the price is wrong bitch
Slash the funs like a cut throat, ear to ear
A blind person in the car and you let them steer?
So you know where we're going? What's the ETA?
Downhill with the brakes cut, lead the way
1600 Penn, with a smile on your face
Rolling into the room like you own the place
Fake it 'til you make it, don't earn it, just take it
A promise to our youth and we just watched you fucking break it
Money makes the world go around
Money makes the world burn down
The union of our wealth and state has our future looking fucking great!
Climbing your way to the top
But the higher you climb, the further you drop
Everything has a price
But the price is wrong bitch
