I can't believe the news, I can't catch my breath
A phone call and a message no one expects
I don't want to believe it but I know it's true
I'm still holding onto what's left of you
Now I know
You don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
It's nights like these that remind me that we're all temporary
Thoughts in my head keep passing
I got no answers for the questions I'm asking
Why does death touch the ones that keep us grounded?
I'm up to my neck in scum, fucking surrounded
'Cause when I wake up and I see who's around
Reality sets in, it makes me wanna drown
I live in a world with pieces of shit
They walk scot-free, I'm fucking sick of it
It's nights like these that remind me that we're all temporary
Why does death touch the once that keep us grounded?
Up to my neck in scum, fucking surrounded
They always take the guru
It should have been you
Now you're gone with the wind, everything is still
I'll stay here forever to watch what you've built
