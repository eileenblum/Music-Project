[feat. Bryan Garris]Down for life
Three strikes, it's 25 to life
Mandatory minimum, never forgiven 'em, we're killing 'em
Public defender, might as well surrender
Doesn't matter for the first time offender
In and out like a homemade shank
Take 'em back to the maximum security bank
Post the bail, cut the deal
Another brick in the wall, another spoke in the wheel
They always come back for more
Get your stamp on the way out the door
'Cause the shit show never ends
Thank you, come again
What you gonna do?
There's no choice when they come for you
They got it twisted like licorice
A quick fix like a nail to a crucifix
Lock you up 'til it makes you sick
Then call it complicated like arithmetic
They gave you a number when they took your name
He's your go to jail card, it's a fucking game
They don't skip a beat, they line 'em up and list 'em
That's just the rhythm of the system
Just when you think you're out, they pull me back in
'Cause when it comes to getting better, don't know where to begin
The reality is you will never be free
You're sentenced to life
Lights out, motherfucker
They always come back for more
Get your stamp on the way out the door
'Cause the shit show never ends
Thank you, come again
