Itâs only a lie if you believe

Now and again
These things have to fall apart
Iâll say it again
These things have to fall apart

I was your cure and you were my disease
I was saving you but you were killing me
Are you sure?
This is what I see
My dreams, your plans, history
Broken teeth and a glass jaw
You always wanted more
Iâll say it again, Iâve said it before
Pack your shit, yo, thereâs the door
And take your fucking ...with you

Now and again
These things have to fall apart
Iâll say it again
These things have to fall apart

Face me when you leave
The only memory is you against me
I should have seen this coming
But I thought that you were bluffing
Now Iâm fucked and Iâm stuck
Turning nothing into something

Face me when you leave
The only memory is you against me

Itâs only a lie if you believe

Now and again
These things have to fall apart
Iâll say it again
These things have to fall apart

Face me when you leave
The only memory is you against me
I should have seen this coming
But I thought that you were bluffing
Now Iâm fucked and Iâm stuck
Turning nothing into something
I was your cure and you were my disease
I was saving you but you were killing me

Itâs only a lie if you believe
