Hey predator, what do you say?
Did you land a girl half your age?
Hey predator, what do you say?
The tables are turned, now youâre the prey

Taking out the trash
Leave it on the front porch step
Thought you were God
Bitch youâre just a lost prophet
And Iâll stop dropping names
When you stop using fame
To prey on pretty little girls like a sick fucking game
What can you pull with the leverage you got?
Youâre in the limelight now, but the cameraâs flashing for your mugshot
Smile, blue ribbon for the P.I.G.
Take him out to the slaughterhouse, itâs time for you to D.I.E.

Hey predator, what do you say?
Did you land a girl half your age?
Hey predator, what do you say?
The tables are turned, now youâre the prey

Write a rhyme not a pick-up line, punk
Give me that pen
I donât want to hear a verse about you and a girl
And how she is your new best friend
Oh, how itâs âhard to handleâ the heat from your scandal
Couldnât wait for an 18^th candle, now Iâm going to make you an example
Itâs crazy how sympathetic people are with your ways
You should have been a lawyer, âcause you can talk for days
Smile, blue ribbon for the P.I.G.
Take him out to the slaughterhouse, itâs time for you to D.I.E.

Canât hide in your brick house, pussy
D.I.E.P.I.G.
