[Additional lyric production by Jesse Barnett]How can you justify
All the lives you fucked up?
Show me the âtruthâ
And Iâll show you the cover up
Sick to my stomach
Sick of the lies
âCause everything you touch
Curls up and dies

Strong arming weak minds
Tell me, how can you sleep at night, alright?
Pretty well, Iâm sure; trust me, youâll get your turn
Before you watch the world burn

Your profit, my coffin
Whatâs left for the rest of us?
Your profit, my coffin
Sick, dead, and dumb, but itâs okay, âcause
Your profit, my coffin
Whatâs left for the rest of us?
Your profit, my coffin
A sacrifice for the new gods

Planting caskets, like seeds
Laid to waste with the worms, the weeds
White lies on the labels we read
Fine print felons, down with the dying breed

Your profit, my coffin
Whatâs left for the rest of us?
Your profit, my coffin
Sick, dead, and dumb, but itâs okay, âcause
Your profit, my coffin
Whatâs left for the rest of us?
Your profit, my coffin
A sacrifice for the new gods

Helpless â crucified
Tell me, how can you justify?
A sacrifice for the new gods
Whatâs left for the rest of us?

Your profit, my coffin
Whatâs left for the rest of us?
Your profit, my coffin
Sick, dead, and dumb, but itâs okay, âcause
Your profit, my coffin
Whatâs left for the rest of us?
Your profit, my coffin
A sacrifice for the new gods
