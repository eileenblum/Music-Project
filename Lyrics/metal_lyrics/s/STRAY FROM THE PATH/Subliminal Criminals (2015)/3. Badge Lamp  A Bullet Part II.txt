[Additional lyric production by Jesse Barnett]So which side are you walking on?
It may not be about race, but it is about color
May have most of them fooled, but not me motherfucker
How can the filth clean up the streets?
Fuck a blue uniform, it donât mean nothing to me
Trained to never trust us
So where the fuck is the justice?
Trigger happy lunatics walking a beat
When you wonât do what they say, then they turn up the heat

Which side are you walking on?
(Which side? Tell me which side)
Trained to never trust us
So where the fuck is the justice?
Which side are you walking on?
(Which side? Tell me which side)
Trained to never trust us
Fuck them, no justice

Red hands on a white man dressed in blue
The streets are looking like Germany in â42
Stop and frisk, donât resist, Iâll tell you why:
They still want to see the lead fly
Scared to death, theyâre not scared to shoot, itâs true
There ainât no such thing as time for the blue
Itâs not about race, but itâs about color
May have most of them fooled, but not me motherfucker

Which side are you walking on?
(Which side? Tell me which side)
Trained to never trust us
So where the fuck is the justice?
Which side are you walking on?
(Which side? Tell me which side)
Trained to never trust us
Fuck them, no justice

Break down the control
Or everybodyâs catching bullet holes

Trained to never trust us
So where the fuck is the justice?
Trained to never trust us
So where the fuck is the justice?
Fuck them no justice

Which side are you walking on?
Which side, tell me which side?
Which side are you walking on?
Which side, tell me which side?
