broadcasted from a room that's full of it 
pushing weight, white coats are selling shit
you get lost in it,
you fall victim to the cause of it
you're the reason they make money from it 
campaign of fear from year to year
but i don't think we're seeing crystal clear
filled with doubt as you cover your mouth.
stay inside, don't go out

outbreak! subliminal criminals fuck this system

pandemonium, a modern dose of phobia,
up in a house medications got a hold of ya.

face your fate, section 8
out snake the pusher 
the elite got you hooked in a chemical state
cancer causing capital
the people turned to animals
the poison is the antidote

lab coat killer, hundred dollar biller
automatically ill, bank roll filler
