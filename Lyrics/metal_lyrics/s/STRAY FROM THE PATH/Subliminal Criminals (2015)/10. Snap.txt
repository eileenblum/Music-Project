Canât stop an American psycho
Snap

Iâm a clock puncher
The shut-up-and-take-orders type motherfucker
Iâm a time cruncher
And Iâm wasting my life
Was a determined man
Now I just wanna stick my head in a ceiling fan
But I see Heaven burning
In the bottom of a gas can

Iâm a nervous wreck
Watch me snap

Do you think my life can get any worse?
Go ahead and take a fucking shot

Canât stop an American psycho
