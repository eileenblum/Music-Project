Tick tick, watch the time bomb click
I came prepared with gun powder and a few red sticks
I see drug lord money
Crooked, quick, and cunning
Yeah, stealing from the people with government funding
Regulate the game, thereâs no fundamental change
Nothing can stop it, their hands in your pockets

Running the same race
Always in last place
Nothing can stop it
Their hands in your pockets

Spreading the interest, unavoidable sickness
Bending us over, our entire existence
âYou can buy a home todayâ
âSign up for a loan,â they say
Just so you can watch the banks
Take your whole life away
The vicious cycle never seems to change
Nothing can stop it, their hands in your pockets

The 1% is out, Iâve got a gun in their mouth
You wrote a check you canât cash
Youâre gonna bounce

Running the same race
Always in last place
Nothing can stop it
Their hands in your pockets
