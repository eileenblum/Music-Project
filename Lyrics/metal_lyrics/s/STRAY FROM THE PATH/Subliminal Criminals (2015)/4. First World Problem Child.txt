[feat. Samuel Carter from Architects]Every rich white kidâs got something to say
Shut the fuck up

First world problem child
Yo, you lost your way
Born on easy street
Never step foot on MLK
Easy living in your position
With a white last name
Pre-conditioned to be the villain
Another suburban day

Every rich white kidâs got something to say
Shut the fuck up
(First world problem child)

Fortunate and favored
You spit the same old flavor
You can use a taste of another race
Whatâs it like to be your neighbor?
Knock knock, coming in hot
We donât need the key, we can break the lock
To your gated house, show the sheltered the real shit
Bring the motherfucking truth out

First world problem child
Step in their shoes, and walk a mile

Iâm a surgeon with a switchblade
Iâll cut you, see if you still bleed
You wouldnât know a problem
âCause you got everything you need
I got iron in my arteries
You got a wall between yourself and reality

Show the sheltered the real shit
Bring the mother fucking truth out

Every rich white kidâs got something to say
Shut the fuck up
