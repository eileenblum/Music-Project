[feat. Cody B Ware]Mother of mine
Say what you want
The youth doomed
Distracted from the war outside
The earth rotten from the core
Weâve seen it before
As God stumbles holding Heaven in palms
I thank mom
But momâs dying
20,000 drowned when momâs crying
Lying looking straight ahead
Never around
The black sun lit the sky
Bodies covered the ground
The sound

Black sun, bodies covered the ground
The sound of the future, the future of sound

Hit God with a follow
He drowned the worldâs soul
Sent a squad to kill the babies
And melt the North Pole
Watched the earth feel beauty was vein
And wanted life from the mouth
Giving it love and saying its name
Said I was God to a human that loves me
Then they judged me
Said, âwhyâd I make the world so uglyâ

How the hell I lose control
If I hold body spirit and soul
Theyâd never know
Itâs just beyond me
And now itâs on me

Black sun, bodies covered the ground
The sound of the future, the future of sound
