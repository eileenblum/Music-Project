Fired, shots fired
Machine gun song ringing all night long

Born and raised
To be placed in a system with such rage
(We want you)
Serving up cocktails of bullets and bombshells
Donât ask and they wonât tell
(We want you)
Soldiers with missions, you better read your positions
And turn the village to victims
(We want you)
You wanted to be sent over seas
To watch the people suffer on their knees

Yeah weâll cover it up in a terrorist way
Yeah weâll cover it up with a terrorist name

Fired, shots fired
Machine gun song ringing all night long

Made into slaves that get paid
To clean house and throw grenades
(We want you)
Burning our bridges with every foreign religion
Based off of business decisions
(We want you)
No weight on the shoulders of mechanical soldiers
You believed what they told ya
(We want you)
You wanted to be sent over seas
To watch the people suffer on their knees

Yeah weâll cover it up in a terrorist way
Yeah weâll cover it up with a terrorist name
We want you

Thereâs no glory in your war story

Fired, shots fired
Machine gun song ringing all night long
