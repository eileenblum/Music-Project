[Note: there are no words in the actual song, but these lyrics appear in the lyric book.]

Shackles come in many forms,
How are yours fitting?
Redefine need.
The law of things versus the state of things.
Is more money always greener?
Kicking and punching to get the bait.
Sobbing and sulking when it fails to satisfy.
Elixirs served on tap till 4 a.m.
The parched vacate to safety.
Look around your abode..
Those that hold the reins needn't have hands at all
