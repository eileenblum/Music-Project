We strive for acceptance
In a world where nothing matters
You gave up your dreams
You've sold yourself out
Prove to me I'm wrong
Then what the hell are you waiting for
Life is passing you by
You only live life once
Live life to the fullest
Live your life to the fullest
Your life is a compromise
