For hours with a pen in hand
All I see, is an empty paper
Mocking me
Frustration never felt like this before
I'll stab this pen through your throat
It's these tests that show you're alive
These defeats that make you not want to be.
I'll find a way to get through this
This won't be the last time
I'll stab this pen through your heart
Until you bleed streams of consciousness
