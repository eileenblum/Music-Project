We've been through so much
But it's only just begun
I like to think back to
Where this all started from
Back to the days when
Your friends are what mattered most and we took that for granted
And sometimes it takes
The loss of one to open your eyes
To what you've really got
Through thick and thin believe me when I say
I'll always be there for you
I'll die for any one of you
