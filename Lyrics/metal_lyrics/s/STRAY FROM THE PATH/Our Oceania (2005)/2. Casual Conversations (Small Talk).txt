Let me tell you what I heard
Rumor spreads like flame
Consuming conversation
Defacing the innocent
Killing friendship
Foul words spoken under
A breath speaking of truth
A trust based on lies
And misinterpretations
For all to tell
Don't believe all you're told
But that's just what I heard
