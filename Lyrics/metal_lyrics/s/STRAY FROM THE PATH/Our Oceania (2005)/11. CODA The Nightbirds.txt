God took the night off.
He let the will of man prevail.
There's a luster in the sky that we cannot see.

The Nightbirds came to save us
The Nightbirds came to set us free
The Nightbirds came to give us peace
A rather ironic species

Oh what futile shields these arms will be, 
What desolate silence will thrive at daybreak
On pillows of stone and blankets of ash 
We will sleep for one last time.

Tonight we will sleep in peace,
Allah, tonight we will sleep in pieces.
