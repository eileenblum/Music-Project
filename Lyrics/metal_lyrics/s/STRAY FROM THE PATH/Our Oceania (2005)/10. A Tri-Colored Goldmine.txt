Opportunity sure did a little more than just knock this time around.
But is it a phenomenon that a sin can be a saint to different eyes?
Or is it that cliche gray between the black and white?
Maybe it was curtain call for business integrity, 
or Orwell's chance to color our slates from clean.
Whatever it was, we were its to covet:
The raped in awe of her rapist, the pawns in euphoric contentment.
Beware the eyes that see in shades of green
