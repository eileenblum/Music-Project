waste my money waste my time
on something that will fuck my mind
to help sedate the daily grind
numb the world outside you cant survive

dont want it dont need it
ba a slave to it no you keep it
cheap thrills for the weak willed
stick it

pressure crack begin to show
paper over it fast so no one knows
light the blue touch watch it go
stress dancing on the stage go underground avoid the rain
backburn it for another day

ive got the answer to what you seek
the best social unwind for a crappy week
an everlasting good night sleep
ultimate antidote overdose but do it quick

got it get it need to feed it
need to feel it need the hit
want it now you need it quick
you need it now you'll kill for it
