every minute everyday 
it twist and turns it lives and breathes 
i cant get rid it strangles me
the egg has hatched the demon seed
weaveled into infects my dreams
para complex pricks and pokes it irritates

cut the cord sever the ties
dig it out weed it out 
cauterize

masked in disguise invited in
the cuckoo leech its draining me
manipulate i cant think straight
pulls the strings behind my eyes
cant scratch the itch the parasite
guilt trip control
mind games that turn the knife

cut the cord sever the ties
dig it out weed it out cauterize
stop the flow the blood supply
starve it out kill it off
foreign body plot denied

sit in my filth
number 2 my skull
touch myself
about to cum
wipe my arse
walk the dog
its always there
i cant outrun
close my lids
in my minds eye
im not alone
its by myside 
my little friend
just waits to come alive

manipulate
i cannot think straight
