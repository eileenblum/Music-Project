home from home but were am i?
strange foreign meat with staring eyes
pushed up faces on the glass
to get a laugh at my expense
public bates me to perform
on a concrete floor i sit and yawn...

i cant get out
i cant get through
i see you
cant get at you

rats and their teachers 
scals and orange witches
scream yell point and tease
what is it they want from me?
public bates me to perform
on a concrete floor i live and learn

sit and rot jokes on you by human error now im through
vent my rage my frustration my annoyance my aggravation
