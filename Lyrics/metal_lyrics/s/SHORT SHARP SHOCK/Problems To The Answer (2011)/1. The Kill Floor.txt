mass production slick automation
efficient killing machine to feed all nations
disassemble line that lives behind closed doors
enter single file leave another form

set us free and why do you do this to me?
generations scream out wide eyed in disbelief
disconnect

quicker fatter bigger leaner
cut and drained out need it faster cheaper
by the knocker sticker shackler rumper
the knuckle dropper naval boner

set us fee and why do you do this to me?
generations scream out wide eyed in disbelief
this is it... this is the end of the line

stunned and dropped your dazed but not dead
cruel distress gets you fed
hung on chains by the legs your throat slit
feeling nothing but full
skin stripped off one hits the floor
glass walls provoke thought
soft offal innards spray onto white walls

the kill floor, the kill floor
