ring you up to check your plans
tied to an invisible elastic band
were you going? what you doing?
when you back? who you meeting?

dont fight your corner and so you sit
trapped caught stuck whipped
dont rock the boat keep her sweet
to fill your boots maybe once a week

questions questions questions
birdshit
