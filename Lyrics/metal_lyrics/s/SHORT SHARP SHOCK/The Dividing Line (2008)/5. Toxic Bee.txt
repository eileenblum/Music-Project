Sun is out summer feeling
Incubating mutant breeding
In the hive the swarm is growing
Kids are playing out unkinowing

Buzz from above thunder black swarm
don't you hear
Terror from the sky fear in your eyes
now you see
Its the toxic bees

Splat swot stun daze 'em
Rqaid don't work just enrage 'em
Try to run but you can't hide
The sting it lays the parasite

Buzz from above thunder black swarm
don't you hear
Down on your knees with a mouth full of bees
Poison your brain going insane from the strain
Sting of the toxic bees

10,000 stingers you're dead by dawn
The kids and dead dogs laid
out flat right on the lawn

Rise of the toxic bee
Flight of the toxic bee
Sting of the toxic bee
You're stung from the toxic bees
