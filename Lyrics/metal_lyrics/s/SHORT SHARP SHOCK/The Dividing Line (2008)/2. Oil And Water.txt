Upfront from the start
Don't subscribe won't take part
The turds float they fuckin stink
Asphyxiate as I sink
Take no shit in disneyland

Don't budge or move stand your ground
Our rulebook not your game plan
Our agenda our master plan

Forced in try as you might
Never bow or bend we'll never break
Heads down try and avoid
You people simply annoy

In the sahde away from the light
Flash in the pans and all of that shite
Crack the flags we've made our mark
Down here alone down in the dark

Oil and water - Never fit
Oil and water - Never mix
