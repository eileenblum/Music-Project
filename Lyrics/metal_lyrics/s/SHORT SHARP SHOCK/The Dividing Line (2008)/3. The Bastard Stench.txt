Trap all the kids
Hook reel them in
Their addiction begins
Walk down the street
At one thousand feet
You fuckin reek

Bastard stench is sickly sweet
A rancid habit no one needs
BBQ out your insides
Loose my rag, Black both your eyes

Get away from me
I cannot breath
You make my eyes bleed
White sticks you crave
Black tar milk you wheeze
And the cancer comes free

Why don't you quit?
