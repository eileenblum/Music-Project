Blind tradition superstition yet again invades our lives
Solstice hijack, one day panic of excess gluttony and greed
Pester power, make 'em happy, left with debts they never see
Buy on plastic, total dog shit, no one wants or even needs

MERRY CHRISTMAS - on impule you buy it, feel good as you swipe it
MERRY CHRISTMAS - you need that fad gadget they hyped you about

Yer house is warm 'n' homely, peek in the oven take a breath
Crispin' skin, basted flesh, soon taste the stink of death
Rover, mogs and polly, loved family pets are safe
But the nameless and faceless get dished up onto your plate

MERRY CHRISTMAS - carved up, served up, trimmings on the side
MERRY CHRISTMAS - unknowing the time, start up wonder why...why?

On the eve, your set for the big day
Midnight mass guild for the one time you pay
Wish list is wrapped and under the tree
Festive slice of life, you smile as you feast
