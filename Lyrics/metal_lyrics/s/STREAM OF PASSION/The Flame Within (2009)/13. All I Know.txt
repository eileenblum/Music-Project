Somewhere,
Someone has turned my thoughts
Into nightmares.
Somehow their words
Are now my own, and I'm sure

They can take all I know
And break it to pieces,
They can take all I know.

Somewhere,
Someone is on the run
With my true self,
Leaving a shadow on my wall.
Somehow the wounds are always there
In the mirror,
Somehow the horror never stops,

And I'm sure
You can take all I know
And break it to pieces,
Every trace of my love
Is lost in the fire.
LlÃ©name de melancolÃ­a.
Truth falls below the ideal.
