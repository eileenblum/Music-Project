[Special edition bonus track]

That one thing
That forced us to unite
Is stretching and sinking in our hearts.
I won't break my vow for anything,
Even being a world apart.

Far, so far.
Apart. So far.
If there's a light filling your eye
Tell it to take me where you are,
Away from the painful humming of the stars.

I know it can't happen now,
And I'm aching while swimming through the hours.
But I won't break this vow for anything,
Even being a world apart.

Far, so far apart. So far.
If there's a light filling your eye
Tell it to take me where you are,
Away from the painful humming of the stars.

Far, so far.
Apart. So far.

I won't break this vow for anything,
Even being a world apart.
I won't break this vow for anything,
Even being a world apart.
