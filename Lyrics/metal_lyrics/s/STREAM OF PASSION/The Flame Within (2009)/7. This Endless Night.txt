Buried in my pillow are the marks of your mistake;
As soon as I lay down I'll feel them closing in.

Like hitting replay, I'm already there...
Going through the story
I should've never lived.

Pull me through this endless night.

There's a ghost by the door,
There's a memory that won't let me go.
Will you please set me free
From the burden that won't let me sleep?

Buried in my pillow, to forever taint my dreams,
Are those hurtful moments I should have never lived.

I'll try anything to stay awake,
And forget the story that's taking the best of me.

Pull me through this endless night.

There's a ghost by the door,
There's a memory that won't let me go.
Should I keep looking in,
In the hope I'll ever feel again?
I don't know...

There's a ghost
Bearing memories that won't let me go.
Will you please set me free
From the burden that won't let me be?
