You were a light, a stroke of hope amongst the dark;
You were the chance for me to open up my heart.
Yet I saw you fly away from me and I didn't know how to keep you back.

So close, so near, my every thought was filled with you;
Can't take the risk of loosing and not pulling through,
So I pushed you away from me and I know you won't be coming back.

My loneliness is wrapped in fear,
It's taking the lead, so I'm gonna stay behind the comfort of a dream.
I want to get near, but I gotta say it's so much easier to run away.

It hurts to say
I'm not as strong as I proclaim;
I hide my grief but it will find me anyway,
'cause I pushed you away from me and I know you won't be coming back.

My loneliness is wrapped in fear,
It's taking the lead, so I'm gonna stay behind the comfort of a dream.
I want to get near, but I gotta say
It's so much easier to run away.
