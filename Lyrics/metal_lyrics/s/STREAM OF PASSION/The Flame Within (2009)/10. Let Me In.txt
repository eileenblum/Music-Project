Say, that must be such a lonely cell;
You hide, you strain to conceal the pain
And I fear for you.

Say, it must be a demanding task
To walk with the chains
To refuse to break.

If you let me in I'll try to free you,
If you let me in I'll rescue your mind.

Take all you need, I will give it all
To break the disease
That confines your soul.

Take all you need,
Every thought, every sigh,
To cut through the fear
That burns down your life.

If you let me in I'll try to free you,
If you let me in I'll swallow your pride.
If you let me in I'll try to free you,
If you let me in I'll rescue your mind.
