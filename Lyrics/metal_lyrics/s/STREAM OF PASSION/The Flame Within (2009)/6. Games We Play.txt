We're hurting as our innocence decays,
And I wonder: will it ever be the same?

You'll tear me apart in the course of the game;
Rules were written in ways I can't understand.

He never meant it but that won't prevent my soul from breaking.

Why do you hide from me, why do you lie?
I'll take the weaknesses that rattle my life and blame you for them.
How have I let you down, what do you mean?
You can't just take the pain in all that you see and blame me for it.

I'll tear you apart, trust me I know just the way;
But I wonder, will I ever feel the same?

I never meant it, but that won't prevent your soul from breaking.

Why do you hide from me, why do you lie?
I'll take the weaknesses that rattle my life and blame you for them.
How have I let you down, what do you mean?
You can't just take the pain in all that you see and blame me for it.

I didn't mean to cause you pain, it's just all part of the game.
