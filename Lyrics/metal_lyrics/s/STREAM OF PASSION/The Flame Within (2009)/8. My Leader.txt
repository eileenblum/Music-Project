You, of endless charm and grace,
You told a hypnotic tale.
You, bearing sweet promises,
Sunk deep into the need
And challenged everything.

I had nowhere to run to;
I was helplessly seduced
By the power of your name,
And every word you said
Seemed like an answer.

You can't save me from falling
Now the moment slipped away;
When the vision is over
I'll return with nothing left.

You broke my heart in two,
You, equally brave and cruel.
By the power of your name
A thousand minds gave in to madness.

He is taking me under...

Was I so blind
Not to see through the disguise
That covered your frozen heart?
Who'll lead us now, long after you're gone?
