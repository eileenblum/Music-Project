[Marcela:]
I've hidden wishes for so long, buried deep inside
Keeping them secret from a world that'll never realize the way I dream
Puedo ver esos rÃ­os de luz escapar de mi piel, hacia la fantasÃ­a
Out in the real world, you are waiting to take my hand,
I'll be looking for answer that leads me back
I lack the will to face my fears, I'm running from it all
And all the painful memories, they haunt me once again
I'm giving up
Out in the real world, you are waiting to hear my call;
Through a river of illusions you saw me fall
Out in the real world, you are waiting to take my hand
I'll be looking for answer that leads me back outside, back in your arms
Out in the real world, you are waiting to hear my call;
(Puedo ver esos rÃ­os de luz)
Through a river of illusions you saw me fall
(escapar de mi piel, hacia la fantasÃ­a)
Out in the real world, you are waiting to take my hand
(Hay en mÃ­ tanto temor)
I'll be looking for answer that leads me back
(Tanto mal que ocultar)
