[Led Zeppelin Cover]

[Marcela:]
If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break
If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break
[Marcela &amp; Diana:] When the levee breaks I'll have no place to stay
[Marcela:]
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
Got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home,
Oh well (Oh well)
[Marcela &amp; Diana:]
Don't it make you feel bad
When you're tryin' to find your way home,
You don't know which way to go?
If you're goin' down south
They go no work to do,
If you don't know about Chicago
[Marcela:]
Cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,
Now, cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,
[Marcela &amp; Diana:] When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move.
[Marcela:]
All last night sat on the levee and moaned
All last night sat on the levee and moaned
Thinkin' about me baby and my happy home.
Oooh well (Oooh well)
[Marcela &amp; Diana:] Going down! Going down now! Going down!
