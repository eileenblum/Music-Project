[Ayreon cover]

[Marcela:]
I am pain
I am real. I'm not a dream
I'm the chain around your neck as you scream
Surrender now
You can't beat death at his ruthless game
Make your bow
Hang your head in shame
[Diana:] I can't believe there is no way out...
[Marcela:] You'll find you are wrong
[Diana:] You fill me with doubt...
[Marcela] You were never that strong
[Marcela:]
I am pain
I am the wound that never heals
It's all in vain
No compromise, no deals...
[Diana:] I can't believe this is the end
[Marcela:] It's written in stone
[Diana:] Where are my friends?
[Marcela:] You have always been alone!
[Marcela &amp; Diana:]
We lead
We hide as the pain leaves the rage inside
[Arjen:] Motion personified alpha
[Marcela &amp; Diana:]
Being here, welcomed by... a sane mind
A travelled lie
[Marcela:]
I am pain
I am the end, I am your wraith
Nothing remains
I'm the loss of hope and faith
[Diana:] I can't believe this is the end
[Marcela:] It's written in stone
[Diana:] Where are my friends?
[Marcela:] You have always been alone!
[Marcela &amp; Diana:] We lead, we hide as the pain leaves the rage inside
[Arjen:] (Motion personified alpha)
[Marcela &amp; Diana:]
Being here, welcomed by... a sane mind
A travelled lie
All the time, I had waited with
[Marcela:] rage
[Arjen:] (Motion personified alpha)
[Marcela &amp; Diana:] All the time, I was promised my
[Diana:] salvation
[Marcela &amp; Diana:]
I can't accept this, we will find a way
Out of this cesspool of doom and dismay
Beyond this dejection there's beauty and grace
A glorious future we long to embrace
[Marcela &amp; Diana:] All the time, I had waited with
[Marcela:] rage
[Arjen:] (Motion personified alpha)
[Marcela &amp; Diana:] All the time, I was promised my
[Diana:] salvation
[Marcela &amp; Diana:] All the time, I had waited with
[Marcela:] rage
[Arjen:] (Motion personified alpha)
[Marcela &amp; Diana:] All the time, I was promised my
[Diana:] salvation
