Slave of a whisper stuck between your temples,
Bound to the meaning of the name they gave you,
You swallow every word that doesnât fit their law,
And every sip of silenceâs burning your throat.

Say what you mean,
Donât let anyone put out the fire in your eyes.

A myriad of wishes piled up in a corner,
Kept in a chamber not unlike Pandoraâs.
The room is filling up and no one is strong enough
To fight the evil of the world on their own.

Say what you mean,
Donât let anyone put out the fire in your eyes.

Open your box of secrets,
Let every demon go, but keep a symbol of hope.
Rise up out of the darkness;
When our eyes meet, youâll know you donât have to be alone.

Open your box of secrets,
Let every demon go, but keep a symbol of hope.
Rise up out of the darkness;
When our eyes meet, youâll know you donât have to be alone.

Say what you mean,
Donât let anyone put out the fire in your eyes.
