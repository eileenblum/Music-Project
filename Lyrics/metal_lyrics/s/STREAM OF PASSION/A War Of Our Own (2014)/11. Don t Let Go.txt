Se lives a life of disaster and pain.
Se lives a life of disaster and pain.
What would she say if I told her itâs not too late?
What would she say if I told her?
We left our lives in the hands of despair.
We left our lives in the hands of despair.
What would you say if I told you itâs not too late?
What would you say if I told you?

Change me, stain me, never let me go.
I long for a moment to drown in your song.
Take me, break me, never let me go,
As long as the future keeps waiting for us.

She fears the horror tomorrow may bring,
She fears the horror tomorrow may bring.
The slightest inkling of doubt crawls under her skin,
The slightest inkling of doubtâ¦

Change me, stain me, never let me go.
I long for a moment to drown in your song.
Take me, break me, never let me go,
As long as the future keeps waiting for us.

Change me, stain me, never let me go.
I long for a moment to drown in your song.
Take me, break me, never let me go,
As long as the future keeps waiting for us.
