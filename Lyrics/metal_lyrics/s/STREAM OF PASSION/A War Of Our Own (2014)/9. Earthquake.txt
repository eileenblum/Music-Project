Disbelieving,
We saw the earth collapse, oh.
When the walls fell,
We felt it in your hearts, oh.

Through the crumbling buildings
I will look for you.

âCause you and I, we could drain the ocean;
Oh, you and I, driven by emotion,
Could stop the ground from shaking.

Run for safety,
Our homeâs been compromised.
Nothing is sacred,
There is nowhere to hide, no.

Through the crumbling buildings,
I will look for you.

âCause you and I, we will rise above this;
Well, you and I, we will keep our promise.
Weâll stop the ground from shaking.

Torn by highest treason, will our city live again?
May ties fire bring us closer to the truth.

Through the crumbling buildings,
I will look for you.

âCause you and I, we will rise above this;
Well, you and I, we will keep our promise.
Weâll stop the ground from shaking.
