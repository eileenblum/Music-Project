The deadly waves of this crimson sea
Are getting stronger, stronger.
We have no choice, so we dive right in;
Weâre going under, going under
To seek the prize we were meant to win,
But is it worth it, is it worth it
As overwhelming obscurity
Is taking over, taking over?

Dama de sol y estrellas,
ProtÃ©genos del mal.

Youâve become a monster
Aching to devour tie world.
Spread you wings and flee
From the Earth to the stars.

The men in charge gave no guarantees.
Weâre on you own now, on our own now,
Trying to shake off this cruel disease,
But we donât know how, we donât know how.

NiÃ±a de manos blancas,
Calma la tempestad
Y lÃ­branos de toto mal.

Youâve become a monster
Aching to devour the world
With your sharpened teeth
And a shattered heart.
Take all you want,
But nothing will bring you calm.

Spread your wings and flee
To the farthest star.

NiÃ±a de manos blancas,
Calma la tempestad
Y lÃ­branos de toto mal.

Youâve become a monster
Aching to devour the world.
Spread your wings and flee.
Youâve become a monster
Aching to devour the world
With your sharpened teeth
And a shattered heart.
Your search will last forever.
