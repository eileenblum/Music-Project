Bring me the burning star
That will erase our deepest terror.
In the presence of your light
Every shadow must surrender.

Is it just a matter of time
Until we finally can look into each otherâs eyes?
Is it just a matter of faith?
Should we believe them when they say itâll be ok,
Or should we start the fire?

Bring me the burning star
That will erase our deepest terror.
In the presence of your light
Every shadow must surrender.

Isnât it a matter of time
Before the last of us is carrying a broken heart?
Isnât it a matter of faith
To know that life as we once knew it wonât be the same
But through this purging fire?

Bring me the burning star
That will erase our deepest terror.
In the presence of your light
Every shadow must surrender.

Bring me the burning star
That will erase our deepest terror.
In the presence of your light
Every shadow must surrender.
Bring me the burning star
That will erase our crimes and errors.
In the presence of your light
Every shadow must surrender.
