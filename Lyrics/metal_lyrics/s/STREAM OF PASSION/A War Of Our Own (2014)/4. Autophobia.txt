This house, torn down, every wall left tainted
As we realise
A ghostly kind of petrifying silence
Slipped through the cracks.
We canât deny our home is ruined now;
We canât deny weâre barely breathing.

Long enough we shared a lie
And we stepped away from all that we are.
Soon enough the veil must fall
And theyâll know, theyâll know my name.

It hurts to know that the ghost lived here
Right from the start.
His wicked smile reveals our every fear,
Yet we wonât go outsideâ¦
We canât deny the end is near.

Long enough we shared a lie
And we stepped away from all that we are.
And we tried to keep the pain inside.
Will we find another place to hide?

This house is torn, every wall was tainted
Right from the start.
I think we know a dark and haunted manor
Canât be called a home.

Long enough we shared a lie
And we stepped away from all that we are.
Soon enough the veil must fall
And theyâll know, theyâll know my name.
