A dangerous stream of passion
Flows through my veins
Infecting my mind with madness
Blurring my senses
My fingers crawl like spiders
Caressing the wall
In desperate need of screaming
For a way out
This feeling's rushing through me, and again
I'm willing to surrender
To the violent notes that spin around
I'd give it up for you
This feeling's clinging to me, and again
I'm willing to surrender
I could lose my breath, but even then
I'd give it up for you
A dangerous stream of passion
Flows through my heart
The melodies sung in secret
Tear me apart
Emotions fade into music
And drift through the night,
Determined to wander freely
Forever more
