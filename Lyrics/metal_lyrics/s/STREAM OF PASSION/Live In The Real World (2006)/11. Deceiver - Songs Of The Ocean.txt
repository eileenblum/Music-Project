For long
I have been hiding
And all the pain I hold within
Sends shivers down my spine
For long
I have been waiting
For a reason to arise
Was it all a waste of time?
I am not who you think I am,
Soon I'll be letting you down
I am not who you think I am
I'm everywhere
You think I have been lying,
There are secrets
That lie frozen in my silent stare
If you go through my fears
You will see I've lost control
All the faith I had is gone
Step back,
Watch me closely
As my crimson wings unfold
You'll see me as I am
I know, it won't be easy
But in the end you'll understand
My instinctive need to fly
