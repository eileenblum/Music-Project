I believe that this game is far from over
Your eyes, everchanging
Shred my beliefs
Elusive as air, your million faces
Share a smile, shed a tear
Then you're hiding again
Wherever you are, I'll find you
And leave my life behind
Wherever you are, I'll find you
I'm leaving now
Every moment of faith
Flows unattended
Pressing thoughts so misleading
Into my head
Come out of the dark
Don't keep me waiting
For the pain is too deep...
Hear me! Come out! Free me!
