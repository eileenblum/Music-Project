I'm ready
With my eyes open wide
Living to devour all this light
Soon, as every sun has faded
You cannot turn away
Follow my voice and feel the pull
I'm ready
As I've never been before
Your need to give in
Grows ever stronger
Rest assured I will not leave you
Until your world is mine
Come closer to me and let go
