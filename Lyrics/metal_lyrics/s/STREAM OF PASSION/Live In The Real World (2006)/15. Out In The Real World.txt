I've hidden wishes for so long
Buried deep inside,
Keeping them secret from a world
That'll never realize
The way I dream
"Puedo ver esos rÃ­os de luz
Escapar de mi piel, hacia la fantasÃ­a"
Out the real world
You are waiting to take my hand
I'll be looking for answer
That leads me back
I lack the will to face my fears
I'm running from it all
And all the painful memories
They haunt me once again
I'm giving up...
Out in the real world
You are waiting to hear my call,
Through a river of illusions
You saw me fall
Out in the real world
You are waiting to take my hand
I'll be looking for answer
That leads me back
Outside, back in your arms
No matter how hard it may seem
We should never hide
The little things that make us real
Show them who we truly are
We will in time
"Puedo ver esos rÃ­os de luz
Escapar de mi piel, hacia la fantasÃ­a
Hay en mi tanto temor
Tanto mal que ocultar "
(I can see rivers of light
Flowing from my skin and toward fantasy
There's so much fear within me
So many faults to hide)
