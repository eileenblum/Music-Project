Let the evening air in
And dim the lights
Reality's fading
As our minds fly
A heavenly glow...
The muse has spoken
The grace of her song...
Calliopeia
Every hour, every day
My search goes on
My precious memories
Are all I have left
I gave my soul away
For a dream, for an illusion
Who will lead me now?
Drowning in tears, I turn to you
