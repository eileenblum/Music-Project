Spare a thought
for me, my love,
while you stare at the distance;
for the spark that was born in your eyes
lit my senses.

Dream of me, my dear;
press my song on your temples.
Let my voice draw away all your fears
and embrace you.

As the night extends over the daylight
please remember
that for a glimpse of your smile I'd give
my everything:
smiles and secrets, hopes and fears;
tears and wishes, words and dreams.

Spare a thought
for me, my love,
when you wake from your slumber.
To the spark that was born in your eyes
I surrender.
