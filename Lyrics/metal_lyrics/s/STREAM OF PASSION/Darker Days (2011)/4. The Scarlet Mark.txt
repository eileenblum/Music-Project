Let the moonlight settle in
open the door
ever so silently.
We've become their enemy
and for our sins we live in hiding

We'll run under the stars,
where no one can find us;
I'll guide you through the dark.

We can't argue,
they can't see
this scarlet mark
burns like no other flame.

We'll run under the stars,
where no one can find us;
I'll guide you through the dark
so nothing will harm you.
I'll guide you through the dark.
We'll never be apart.
