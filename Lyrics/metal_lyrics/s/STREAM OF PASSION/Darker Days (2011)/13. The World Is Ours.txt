We stood, showered in light,
a million stars in our eyes.
But the warning was in the air;
soon enough you would let us down.

When our king
broke his promise,
we came back from our dream
with eyes wide open.

We knew
perfectly well
no one on this earth
can hold on to much love or much gold
without growing cold inside.

When our king
broke his promise,
we came back from our dream
with eyes wide open.
Take everything,
burn his tower.
On this lucid day
the world is ours.

We will set your words on fire,
on this day
the world belongs to us.
