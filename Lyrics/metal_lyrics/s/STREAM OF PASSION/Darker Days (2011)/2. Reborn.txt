Where is your inspiration,
where have your angels gone?
How did constant aggression
bury away your charm?
Your features keep on changing,
and I can't recognize
the drive I used to know,
the passion in your eyes

De la ceniza tu voz renacera,
una promesa
que no se rompera
[English translation:
From the ashes your voice
will be reborn,
a promise that won't be broken]

Break through the darkness,
break through the madness.

You used to be enchanting,
your future wide and bright,
and who would speak your name
would carry your flag with pride.
How have the demons tainted you,
how have we grown apart;
but your skies will remain
the colors of my heart

I'll wait across the water
for you to step into the light.

I'll wait across the water
for you to come and find me.
