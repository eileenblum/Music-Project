Oh my love,
I think I've been led astray;
led to walk down an empty street
where all secrets can be heard.

Like a rush
of icy wind down my spine,
piercing eyes will cut
through all reason
and dig into my mind.

We can't stay, we're in danger;
they'll follow us everywhere we go.

Lead the way,
take me somewhere
where our worlds can collide.
Lead the way,
take me somewhere
and bury me in your arms.

Oh my love,
nothing is what it seems;
they'll put on a smile
to disguise the knife
hidden up their sleeves.

Pray for us
and the bond we had,
for as soon the night falls down,
I'm sure, you won't have the chance.

Only you hold the answer,
and only you can right their wrong.

Only you hold the answer,
say the word and I will never run again.
