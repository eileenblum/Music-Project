Drop the blame on my shoulders,
I will carry it far away from home.
You were forced into a corner,
I saw it all happen and didn't say a word.

My
innocent mind
is struggling to find
a glimpse of light
to touch your eyes.

Broken.
Broken.
We are broken, we're burning inside.
Broken.
Broken.
It's the pain that's left you burning inside,
It's not the way you are.
Not the way you are.
Not the way you are.

Bitter words, you don't mean them;
It's the continuous sound of broken promises,
It's not the way, not the way you are,
Not the way, not the way you are,

My
innocent mind
is struggling to find
a glimpse of light
to touch your eyes.

Broken.
Broken.
We are broken, we're burning inside.
Broken.
Broken.
It's the pain that's left you burning inside,
It's not the way you, not the way you are.
Not the way you are.
Not the way you are.

Not the way you are.
Not the way you are.

Drop the blame on my shoulders,
I will carry it far away from home.
