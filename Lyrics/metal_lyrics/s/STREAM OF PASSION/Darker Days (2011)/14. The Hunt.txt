[Digipack Bonus Track]Maybe we'll never know where it all began
Or how we got ourselves into this mess
A threat greater than anything we'd seen
A storm that would erase all our beliefs

Take the curse, the flaws in all the things you can't explain
The sudden sight of nightfall and the rumbling of the earth
Wrap them in your deepest fears and give them all away
To someone who can shed the tears you're struggling to contain

[Chorus:]
Until the flame burns out
Until the end of the world
You'll endlessly put the blame
On every heart but your own

Maybe it's just easier to believe
This fire will clean the air and bring us peace
Maybe the smoke will ease away our pain
Maybe the truth is just too hard to take

Soon you'll learn to find the sign of darkness everywhere
The craze will raise around us and the hunt will never end

[Chorus 2x]
