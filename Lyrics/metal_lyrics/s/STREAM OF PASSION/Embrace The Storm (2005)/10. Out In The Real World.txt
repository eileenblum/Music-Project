[Intro]
(out in the real world you are waiting to take my hand,
I'll be looking for an answer that leads me back...)

[Verse 1]
I've hidden wishes for so long, buried deep inside.
Keeping them secret from a world that'll never realize the way I dream.

[Pre-Chorus]
Puedo ver esos rÃ­os de luzescapar de mi piel, hacia la fantasia.

[Chorus 1]
Out in the real world you are waiting to take my hand,
I'll be looking for an answer that leads me back.

[Verse 2]
I lack the will to face my fears, I'm running fromit all.
And all the painfull memories, they haunt me once again. I'm giving up.

[Pre-Chorus]
Puedo ver esos rÃ­os de luz escapar de mi piel, hacia la fantasia.

[Chorus 2]
Out in the real world you are waiting to hear my call.
Through a river of illusions you saw me fall.

[Chorus 1]
Out in the real world you are waiting to take my hand,
I'll be looking for an answer that leads me back.
Outside, back in your arms.

[Verse 3]
No matter how hard it may seem, we should never hide,
The little things that make us real.
Show them who we truly are, we will in time

[Chorus 2 and Pre-chorus play simultaneously**]

[Pre-Chorus]
Puedo ver esos rÃ­os de luz escapar de mi piel, hacia la fantasia.

[Chorus 2]
(out in the real world you are waiting to hear my call.
Through a river of illusions you saw me fall.)

[Chorus 1]
Out in the real world you are waiting to take my hand,
I'll be looking for an answer that leads me back.
