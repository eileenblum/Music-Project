I'm ready; With my eyes open wide,
Living to devour all this light.
Soon, as ever sun has faded,
You cannot turn away.
Follow my voice and feel the pull.
I'm ready, as I've never been before.
Your need to give in grows even stronger.
Rest assured I will not leave you,
Until your world is mine.
Come closer to me and let go.
