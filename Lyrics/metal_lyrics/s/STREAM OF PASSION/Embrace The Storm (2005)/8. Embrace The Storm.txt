A storm is raging around us, we feel its majesty.
The clouds are moving forward unraveling my hidden thoughts.
Embrace the storm.
The storm is blinding our vision as it travels through the fields.
I watch in absolute horror for now I know the day has come.
Embrace the storm.
Now I know we will never behold the sun again.
Our path is perfectly clear: We belong amongst the clouds.
The storm is building inside me, it screams to be released.
It will destroy my silent existence and now I know the day has come.
Embrace the storm.
