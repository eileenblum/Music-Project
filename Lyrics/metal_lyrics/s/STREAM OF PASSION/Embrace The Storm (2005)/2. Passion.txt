[Verse 1]
A dangerous stream of passion,
Flows through my veins.
Infecting my mind with madness,
Blurring my senses.
My fingers crawl like spiders,
Caressing the wall,
In desperate need of screaming,
For a way out.

[Chorus]
This feeling's rushing through me, and again,
I'm willing to surrender,
To the violent notes that spin around.
Id give it up for you.
This feelings clinging to me, and again,
I'm willing to surrender.
I could lose my breath but even then,
Id give it up for you

[Verse 2]
A dangerous stream of passion,
Flows through my heart.
The melodies sung is secret,
Tearing me apart.
Emotions fade into music,
And drift through the night
Determined to wonder freely
Forever more

[Chorus x2]
