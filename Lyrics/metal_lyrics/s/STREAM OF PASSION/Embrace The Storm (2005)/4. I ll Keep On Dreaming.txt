[Verse 1]
I have waited long, I'm waiting still.
Why did I ever think you'd come back to me?
I guess I'll keep on dreaming.

[Verse 2]
Life, the finest thread, wears easily.
Why did I ever think you'd come back to me?
I guess I'll keep on dreaming.

[Verse 3]
Years are passing by so slowly...
Why did I ever think you'd come back to me?
I guess I'll keep on dreaming.

[Verse 4]
Life, the finest thread, wears easily.
Why did I ever think you'd never leave me?
I'll keep on dreaming.
