[Verse 1]
Let the evening air in and dim the lights;
Reality's fading as our minds fly.

[Chorus]
A heavenly glow...
The muse has spoken;
The grace of her song...
Calliopeia.

[Verse 2]
Every hour, every day, my search goes on.
My precious memories are all I have left.

[Chorus]
A heavenly glow...
The muse has spoken;
The grace of her song...
Calliopeia.

[Verse 3]
I gave my soul away, for a dream, for an illusion.
Who will lead me now? Drowning in tears, I turn to you.

[Chorus]
A heavenly glow...
The muse has spoken;
The grace of her song...
Calliopeia.
(Who will lead me now?)
