[Verse 1]
Dias enteros caminando en silencio.
Apuro mis pasos para dejar todo atrÃ¡s;
Busco en la soledad el espacio para olvidar esa voz que me atormenta.
[English translation:
Entire days I spend walking in silence.
I hurry my steps to leave everything behind;
In solitude I search for a space to forget that voice that haunts me.]

[Chorus]
I live in fear when the shadows reappear,
Unleashing all their might.
I never thought I'd face the demons on my own.
Make it stop! Haunted, hunted.

[Verse 2]
Un suspiro que penetra mi alma,
Un pensamiento constante e hiriente.
SÃ© que estÃ¡s ahi, aunque no puedo verte,
Nunca he podido escapar del yugo de tus ojos.

[English translation:
A whisper that digs into my soul,
A constant and upsetting thought.
I know you're there, even though I can't see you,
I was never able to escape from your cruel eyes.]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
With every breathe I take,
My heart beats faster.
No matter how hard I try to unwind,
Tears keep falling from my eyes.
Haunted, hunted, I'm down on my knees;
Forever I'll mourn the loss of my innocence.

[Chorus]
