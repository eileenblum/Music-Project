[Verse 1]
I knew you well; your regrets, your wishes,
Your secret names, your dreams unleashed.

[Chorus 1]
But little did I know once the fear was long gone,
I'd be hearing words so many long for.

[Verse 2]
We sat and stared through those trembling moments.
The key was kept on the back of my hand.

[Chorus 2]
But little did we know once the door was open,
We'd be humming songs so many long for, so many long for.

[Verse 3]
For everything that we've shared in this life,
You've given me a gift of song.
For everything that we've been through,
I give you my all.
I'm breathing again.

[Chorus 2]
But little did we know once the door was open
We'd be humming songs so many long for, so many long for.
