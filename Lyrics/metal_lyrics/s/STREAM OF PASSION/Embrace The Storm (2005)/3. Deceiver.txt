[Verse 1]
For long I have been hiding,
And all the pain I hold within sends shivers down my spine.
For long I have been waiting,
For a reason to arise,
Was it all a waste of time?

[Chorus]
I am not who you think I am,
Soon I'll be letting you down.
I am not who you think I am,
I'm everywhere.

[Verse 2]
You think, I have been lying,
There are secrets that lie frozen in my silent stare.
If you go through my fears,
You will see I've lost control,
All the faith I had is gone.

[Chorus]

Step back, watch me closely;
As crimson wings unfold you'll see me as I am,
I know it won't be easy,
But in the end you'll understand,
My instinctive need to fly.

[Chorus]
