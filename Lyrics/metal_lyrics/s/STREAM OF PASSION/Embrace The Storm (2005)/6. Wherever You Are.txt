[Verse 1]
I believe that this game is far from over.
Your eyes, ever changing, shred my beliefs;
Elusive as air, your million faces
Share a smile, shed a tear, then your hiding again.

[Pre-Chorus]

Wherever you are I'll find you.

[Chorus]
Wherever you are I'll find you,
And leave my life behind,
Wherever you are I'll find you,
I'm leaving now.

[Verse 2]
Every moment of faith flows unattended,
Pressing thoughts so misleading into my head.
Come out of the dark, don't keep me waiting,
For the pain is too deep...
Hear me! Come out! Free me!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I believe that this game is far from over.
Your eyes, ever changing, shred my beliefs;
Come out of the dark, don't keep me waiting,
For the pain is too deep...
Hear me! Come out! Free me!

[Pre-Chorus x2]

[Chorus x2]
