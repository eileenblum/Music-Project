[Verse 1]
Tell me what I could have said or done to hold you back?
All the love I gave was not enough... forever I'll walk alone.

[Pre-Chorus]
My body froze as I saw you fall (falling down).
One single step saw you give your heart to the Earth, down below.

[Chorus]
Open your eyes, open your eyes,
Open your eyes and look at me, I'm alone here.
Open your eyes, open your eyes,
Open your eyes and look at me, I'm alone here.

[Verse 2]
All at once the wind has changed its song to a wailing cry;
As it seems to call my name I know forever I walk alone.

[Pre-Chorus]
My body froze as I saw you fall (falling down).
One single step saw you give your heart to the Earth, down below.
