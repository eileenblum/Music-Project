Raw material melt down, cauldrons glow with hellish flames
Malleable, ready to take the shape of a new host
You are going to be shaped, get ready to take a new form
Reduced to your primal materials

Separated from unwanted residues, you are selectively harvested
Unattached to the elements not desired by the forge

Draw the lever, the sound of the clashing chains
Magma splashes in the mould, shaping you as was foretold

A thousand hammers cry your name as they discipline your new found body through thunderstorm blasts

Clash, clash, burn
Clash, clash, burn

Submerged in water, a violent awakening
the struggle to breathe, you emerge
Exploring your forged life, the truths you will find are the lies of your predecessors

The forge keeps spewing fire, the hammers keep clashing down
Convicted to an endless pursuit of your human impurities
