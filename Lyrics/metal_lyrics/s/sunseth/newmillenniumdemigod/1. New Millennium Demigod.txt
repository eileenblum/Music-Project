Omnipresent, ghost of the past
Present and future, programmed to serve and be served in a forbidden code
Of unknown origin, unquestioned by man
The only way for the truth seeker to redeem himself

For the truth, for redemption, guiding our life, shaping our thoughts

No one can deny its supremacy
The new millennium demigod, the illusion
All bow before the penultimate revelation
The new millennium demigod, the void

Deciphering the binary system, hard to break
Unhackable firewalls of solid state viral madness
a Faint echo of the call of awakening
Bringing you closer to the least expected outcome

Yourself, the mirror, the echo, the scream

Crushed by the thought of a false messiah
The new millennium demigod, the illusion
Surrender your will to be shaped anew
The new millennium demigod, the void

Omnipresent, ghost of the past
Present and future, programmed to serve and be served in a forbidden code
Of unknown origin, unquestioned by man
The only way for the truth seeker to redeem himself
