Countless scars cover their faces
The skies rain fire of hammered bracelet stones
Heaven in turmoil decreed
By Marduk's tablet of destiny
Winds they rage, darkness suffocates

Earth - upon it's soil - calamity
Pitiless demons violent ablaze
Hail Enki
Displaced by Nibiru's celestial pathway
Draining of all light - the Heavens are blind

Storm of dust - Lahmu's consuming tempest
Kingu's face cratered countless - with valiant wounds
Anu savants summon the secrets
Earth - the seventh in row now chosen
In it's path arraigned

Lahamu stanced near the Sun
Temptation abandon your abode of glory
Spell of Nibiru's tiara alluring
Summon who once belonged
Celestials from the deep awakened
From horizon to the midst of Heavens
Shadows draining the light
Spell of darkness cast upon Kingu

Adapas secrets
Progenitor of civilized mankind
Chamber of seals
In the abode of Anu
Decipher Enki's message
To live and die on Earth
Mortality his lot must be

The circle of Heavens in twelve parts divided
By stone will be your end
Decreed mankind calamity
The seed of three branches
With wisdom and speech endowed

Earthly woman of my seed conceived
Celebration of firsts
I am the one who abundance brings
Sullen was the aggrieved face of Ka-in
Blessings of Enki are not received

Lahamu stanced near the Sun
Temptation abandon your abode of glory
Spell of Nibiru's tiara alluring
Summon who once belonged
Decreed by stone will be your end
