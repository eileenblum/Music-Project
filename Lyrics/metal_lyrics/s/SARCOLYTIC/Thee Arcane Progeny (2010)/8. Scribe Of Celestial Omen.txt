Summoned to scribe the omens
Of Eridu's remnants
From the south
The chariot made no sound

Prostrated, I bow before
A divine vision
The emissaries stand before me
With faces of man
With garment of burnished brass
By my hand aloft
Taken to the land of Magan
Between the Earth and heavens

The great gateway to the gods' abode
A brilliance that drains me weakened
Collapsed in depravity
Devoid of life and spirit

Awakened
By the deepest of voices
Disembodied
The divine utterance

Chosen servant of lord Enki
The fashioner of all mankind
Exalted and omnipotent
Awaiting judgment

The talon of elder requiem
Engrave the tablet's smooth faces
The account of the beginnings
The cycle of punishment
Returning of celestial gods
Mankind judged of impurities
Marked by the seal of the divine
Sacred number ov gods

No prophets are ordained in the end
New gods shall decree the fates
The heavens behold the sigils
Marked by the seal of the holy

Awakened
By the deepest of voices
Disembodied
The divine utterance
