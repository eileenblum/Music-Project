From pouch to soil sustain, the covenant's embrace
The promise of the exalted the seed of all beginnings
From Nibiru on Earth be grown deliver the seed to be sown

Edin's genesis sigils entwined divine decree
Born of Nibiru's royal seed equated dominion Nibru-Ki
Sanctum Earth's crossing bond - Heaven Earth shall be named!!

He shall be heard! Anu the king
Fate in your grasp rest is decreed upon earths seventh day
Thus shall be called by glorious names
Those from heaven to Earth came!

Erect the cities of healing of weapons - of birth
Chamber of crowns perfected zenith - towards horizons
Besiege the leaders speechless

Mutiny - upheaval - denouncing - lament - excavation - unrest
Proclaimed war! War!!!!

Words of incitement heed fire to the axe - hold high the torch
To council summon Ningishzida!! Reveal the secrets of Abzu

The seed of all beginnings the black-headed ones they roam
Specimens to be examined augmented their flesh
With that of Annunaki father of all beginning
Serpents entwine the life tree

Encaged fist to steel salivating
No words were they speaking

From pouch to soil sustain, the covenant's embrace
The promise of the exalted the seed of all beginnings
From Nibiru on Earth be grown deliver the seed to be sown

Fashioned by my hands
Two essence branches to the life tree added
Upon their flesh our mark they bear
Serpents entwine the conceived the seed of all beginnings

The lady of life's serpents entwine
Adding two branches our mark of essence
In our image - Annunaki creating the slave prevail!
