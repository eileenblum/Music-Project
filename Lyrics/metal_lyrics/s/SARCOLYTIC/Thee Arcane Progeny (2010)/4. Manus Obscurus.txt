Deity enshrined I am the divine
Marduk immaculate
Heavens and Hells combined
Sect heretic, omen manifested
Ponder past, fate and destiny

All that lived is now rotten and desolate
Speaking tongues of the Galzu
Calamity disfiguring, soured seed spilling from womb

Mortal lands will bow to me
Toward Shumer, calamity was carried

Disease upon all of your flesh
Hand spreading it's pestilence
Decrepitus hand
The unseer of all who perish

Demigod enshrined I am the divine
Immaculate
Heavens and Hells combined
Sect heretic, omen manifested
Ponder past, fate and destiny

Mortal lands will bow to me
Toward Shumer, calamity was carried

Disease
Upon all your of flesh
Hand
Spreading it's pestilence
Decrepitus hand
The unseer of all who perish
