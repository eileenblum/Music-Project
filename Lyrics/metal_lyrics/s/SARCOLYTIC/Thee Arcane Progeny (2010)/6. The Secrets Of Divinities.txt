Discourse to earthly sacrament
Oracles behold divine utterance
The heavens observed for omens
The conflict of the gods to mankind avowed

Vigils bespoke Marduk's supreme throne to mortals

Parallels of planets circuits
Cakanity shall remain eternal
The first script - Last shall also be
Dust - Weapons of terrors
Decimated regions of the earthling mass strangulated

Lord Enki
Before council Nefilim
Alone in stood opposition
Behold the munitions of forbid

The end of destroyers
Eridu genesis - Epic of creation
Habitus fashioned-Of pure regions

The heart of Babilis lands
The evil wind has spared none
To lands beyond oceans depart
Marduk's seed be sown ordained

Discourse to earthly sacrament
Oracles behold divine utterance
The heavens observed for omens
The conflict of the gods to mankind avowed

Enlil - Proclaimed the well of Ancients
Creators hand - Destroyer of all
Unfathomed - Celestial cycles
Between chosen fates unbending

The secrets of divinities
The omen of the supreme throne
