Diabolical scourge, how smitten is the land diseased
Abandoned-Kingdom Sumer, afflicted bodies piled
Lament of the Fields-Collapse-Defiled
Withered-Cursed by hands of gods
Lifeless waters poisonous-Silence falls upon Eridu
The still ears of the Ancients gone
Stench of dissolution-Dessemating breath

Forsaken temples whose heads rose to the heavens
Relinquished of lordship-Scepter and tiara in ruin
In the council of Nefilim, spread were words of venom

Royal throne into one flesh combined
The perfect seed of pure descent

Usurper-Gut the bowels of Nibiru
Deliver-The gold to seal the heavens' wound
Failure-Devastation, banished from the throne
Expulsion from the desolate

Divine cities hollowed-Precipitance
I beseech the gods of all creation

Who's wings are draped in blood and gold
Celestial emissary, circuit abysmal Elisium
Blackest of void Enshar looming

Lifeless waters poisonous-Silence falls upon Eridu
The still ears of the Ancients gone
Stench of dissolution-Dessemating breath

Omen- Of the Ancients
Chariot- Set course for the seventh god
Obscurity- On the sun is cast

Usurper-Gut the bowels of Nibiru
Deliver-The gold to seal the heavens' wound
Failure-Devastation, banished from the throne
Expulsion from the desolate

Forsaken temples whose heads rose to the heavens
Relinquished of lordship-Scepter and tiara in ruin
In the council of Nefilim, spread were words of venom

Obscurity - On the sun is cast
Behold- Tiamat's gift infinite
