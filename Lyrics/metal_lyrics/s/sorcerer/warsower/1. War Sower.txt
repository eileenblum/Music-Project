Buried beneath forsaken cryptic stones
In silent darkness, in soil of our fathers
I am still waiting and dreaming, dreaming about forgotten battles
I come forth of frost and snow burning sun and embrace of night
I was ancient when the swords were raised
Blood, death glory(GORE) is all I want to see

[Chorus:]
I Am the war that no one has fought
I Am the Army that gathers
I Am the arm of warriors and gods
I Am the Heart of Battle

Awaiting my time, time of return
On the battlefield, it doesn't matter where
When the horns call for war
I will be always there
The time has come to stand unto this earth
Like thousand times before like in the ancient times
I hear summonings, nations are calling
To inflame their hearts again I rise!!! I rise!!!

[Chorus:]
I Am the war that no one has fought
I Am the Army that gathers
I Am the arm of warriors and gods
I Am the Heart of Battle

There is a War inside of man
There is a struggle between the blood of the giants
And the spirits of the gods
Those who deny the struggle - deny Man
And those who deny Man - should not be called by that name!

[Chorus:]
I Am the war that no one has fought
I Am the Army that gathers
I Am the arm of warriors and gods
I Am the Heart of Battle
