The night has fallen upon the vast plain
The stars are slothily dripping light
But darkness lingers from depths below
Obsidian menace ten times blacker than the night
I rise my hands to the moonlit sky
I hear the whisper of the windy tongue
From macrocosmos to the place under my feet
Singular unity is now a string to which I'm bound

The rites are now complete and spirit triumphs again
Flows thru the timeless aeons - no constrains
It is Ascension via Cosmic stairs
Of He who Overcomes, of He who now shall reign!
The words of Prophets were not cast in vain
Eternal Wisdom reaps her blossomed fruit
The lives of sheeple cost us nothing but their pain
And such a price is worth its worth, rejoice now in His Name!

[CHORUS:]
Bane, bane on the creeping dark!
The wicked, the cruel, the blind
Hail, hail to the Cosmic Light!
By Blood and Steel of our Kind

[CHORUS:]
Bane, bane on the creeping dark!
The wicked, the cruel, the blind
Hail, hail to the Cosmic Light!
By Blood and Steel of our Kind

By Blood, and Steel of our...
Mighty Tribe, which seeks to find its eternal excellence
On a path polluted by many an empty barrel
To overcome the inner inert being
We transgress the stagnant dichotomy

[CHORUS:]
Bane, bane on the creeping dark!
The wicked, the cruel, the blind
Hail, hail to the Cosmic Light!
By Blood and Steel of our Kind

[CHORUS:]
Bane on the creeping dark!
The wicked, the cruel, the blind
Hail, hail to the Cosmic Light!
By Blood and Soil of our mighty Tribe
With Honour sealed in our pride

[EPILOG:]
We overcome endless cycle of
The pattern of Life and of Death
Abandoned, lies rotten corpse of inhumanity
Who choked on her last dying breath
Recognized are the priorities
Of our final struggle for the Highest Order
Venerable chaff has seen its emptiness
Sacrificial annihilation, uncovering sight of our Destination
Overcoming overburden - enter OVERMAN!
