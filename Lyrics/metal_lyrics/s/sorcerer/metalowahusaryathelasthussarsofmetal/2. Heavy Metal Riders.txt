[music: Strzelec &amp; Sorcerer, lyrics: Kel`Thuz &amp; Strzelec]

Every day is like a battle
With the people who got weakness in their hearts
Every day they sell themselves
The losers and the liars
All their pride has gone away
They will crash like glass
When we strike âem once again

[Pre:]
Will of Power has fulfilled us all
Time of our fight has just begun
Here We all believe in Heavy Metal
It is our religion and the goal to fight

[Chorus:]
Donât believe the words that Metal died
Cos weâve got the Power and the Might
Raise the hammer of Thor !
Hear the losers cry !
Heavy Metal Riders rule the night !

I recognize only tradition
I refute all decadent trends
Sign of the Hammerâs gleaming on my shield
Iâm the knight of my land
Many posers I have slain
And I really felt what taste's the Victory !

[Pre:]
Will of Power has fulfilled us all
Time of our fight has just begun
Here We all believe in Heavy Metal
It is our religion and the goal to fight

[Chorus:]
Donât believe the words that Metal died
Cos weâve got the power and the might
Raise the hammer of Thor !
Hear the losers cry !
Heavy Metal Riders rule the night !
[solo: Strzelec]
[solo: Seru]

[Pre:]
Will of Power has fulfilled us all
Time of our fight has just begun
Here We all believe in Heavy Metal
It is our religion and the goal to fight

[Chorus:]
Donât believe the words that Metal died
Cos weâve got the power and the might
Raise the hammer of Thor !
Hear the losers cry !
Heavy Metal Riders rule the night !
