[music: Strzelec, Seru &amp; Sorcerer, lyrics: Strzelec ]

Like forgotten order of the Knights
Like monks of Metal faith
I'm the one of those who will baptize the world
By the double-edged sword

[Pre:]
I follow the call of the wild!
I give a shout - it fills the sky!

[Chorus:]
Heart of the Warrior lives in You
Together We defend the Truth!
I never lose the Metal Faith
A new day will rise again!

I was born from Thunder, Fire and the Anger
Look at my Army now!
Dazzling like a lightning, burning like the Sun
Truth and Metal be my guide!

[Pre:]
I follow the call of the wild!
I give a shout - it fills the sky!

[Chorus:]
Heart of the Warrior lives in You
Together We defend the Truth!
I never lose the Metal Faith
A new day will rise again!

[lead - Seru]
[solo - Strzelec]

[Pre:]
I follow the call of the wild!
I give a shout - it fills the sky!

[Chorus:]
Heart of the Warrior lives in You
Together We defend the Truth!
I never lose the Metal Faith
A new day will rise again!
