I look through the broken surface of the glass
And watch my face in thousand pieces laughing

The eyes are nailing me
In the cross of reality

Contemplated fall I was left dead and cold
And now betrayalâs disease is devouring my soul

The eyes are nailing me
To the cross of lies

[Chorus]
Take these scars
Away from me
Take these scars
Away from me
Life is gone bleed me dawn
Emptiness remains inside of me

A smile is engraved as the glass cuts my lips
Illusions you sell me again become poison sips

The eyes are nailing me
To the cross you rose

[Chorus]

I crawl upon the path of no return
My hands are stoned with failure
Mistakes build my gain
These scars reflect all the desires life denied
Irony kissed the corpse of hope when she died

[Chorus]
