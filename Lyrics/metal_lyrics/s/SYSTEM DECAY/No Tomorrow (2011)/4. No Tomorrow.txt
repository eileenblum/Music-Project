Demolish the structure
Human perversion creates
Tomorrow is gone in death hope is drown
Explode their mindâs indifference

Summon the truth that no one should seek
Sink in machineâs immorality
Uproot the confidence from languid eyes
Burn in flames the dance of lies

[Chorus:]
No tomorrow
Cursed in blood stains
Distort morality wash it away
No tomorrow
Live has been drained
DISTORTION DECAY

A pit full of slaves
Bound on digital chains
Demolish the structure set the pit ablaze

Tomorrow rebellionâs flames will reach the sky in strife
The morons that form this race in murder forged mankind

[Chorus]

Distortion, decay

Tomorrow is gone
Upon the ashes we must walk

[Chorus]
