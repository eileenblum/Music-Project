Sepsis is running in the veins of our society
Systemâs decay is engraved on crowdâs hypocrisy
There arenât any more too many options for this race to choose
Stand and watch till all this hell inside you will break loose

[Chorus]
In a dream came to me
Myself ene-me
In my brain
Truth remained and drove me insane

SEEK FIND BLEED
PUT YOURSELF ON THEIR FUCKINâ TRIP

I see your world is turning paranoid and mad
And realize the history is still built on lies drown in blood
Brains for fools connected at the televisionâs wire
Cure for our reality is lead gasoline and fire

[Chorus]

SEEK FIND BLEED
BURY SHIT INSIDE YOUR THOUGHTS SO DEEP

SEEK FIND BLEED
PLAY THEIR GAME AND NOW GO TO SLEEP
