Let death disorder and chaos released
The price approaches
Iâve seen the skies burn on flames and disease
Iâve seen the nightmare built

Pain will greet our bright nemesis

Please forgive me
I am guilty for my ignorance
Nothing will set me free
I chose not to see

[Chorus]
Erase my sins all I left broken
Rotten parts upon this skin
The hours have turned
The sun is burned

A barren place breathing disgrace I see we failed
Civilizationâs train now runs derailed
Iâve seen the end when the system collapsed
The path is gone
Open your arms to the prodigal sons

[Chorus]
