Invite, ignite
An evening daylight
In god, we trust
So this is our right

Come my allies we need your lies
Peace by our domination we will restore
Sacrifice we need an alibi
2974

[Chorus:]
Forces in line
Let us combine
Blindness with free will
Be our ally into this lie again
Forces in line soldiers aligned
To their endings
Come my allies come to decline
DEMOCRACY

Bullets of freedom
Warheads of peace
Terrorists to justify the debris
Like pigs in the warzones we bathe in the mad
And the pigs are bathing in money and blood

Over the ramparts we watched we are so terrified, screaming
And the rocketâs red glare bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that the war was still there
And the blood spangled banner in triumph shall reign
Over the land of the sick and the home
Of the slaves

[Chorus:]
Forces in line
Let us combine
Blindness with free will
Be our ally into this lie again
Forces in line soldiers aligned
To their endings
Come my allies come to decline
AND ROTTEN IN TRIUMPH WE SHALL REIGN
