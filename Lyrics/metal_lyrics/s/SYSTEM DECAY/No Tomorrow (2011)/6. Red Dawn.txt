Betraying ourselves once more
Ideals humiliated
While washing our hands inside
This river we created

The price weâve paid, our renseignement
We fell into a radiant abuse
Do we know how to use those who finally amuse us
Use the wrath that we turn loose

[Chorus:]
Still unknown
Rays of distant morn
Tear the social disease asunder
Each of us will stand alone dead and gone
Before the dawn of red all plundered

Betraying our hollow lives
The bullet paints the sky crimson
Among the religionâs web
It bursts from my hand

[Chorus]

Gaze behind the smoke
The voices wither
No more time for shame and regrets
Bloody we greet the dawn

[Chorus]
