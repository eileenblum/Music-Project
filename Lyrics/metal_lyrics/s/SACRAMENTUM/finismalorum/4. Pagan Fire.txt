Lost, alone in the crypts of mourning
Deep under a mountain of sorrows

Cold flames of melancholy
Tearing inside of me
Taste the bitterness
And feel the strength in pain

So deep, so dark, so real
Filling all my veins
Wandering souls meant as one
Roaming around (illusion is) gone

Searching in my mind
But calm is not to find

Come with me
Follow me in my search of thee
Fall with me through eons of despair
To the sound of a million divine choirs

Frustration leads my soul
To the desert of confusion
Captured in a world formed by myself

Cold flames of melancholy
Tearing inside of me
Taste the bitterness
And feel the strength in pain
