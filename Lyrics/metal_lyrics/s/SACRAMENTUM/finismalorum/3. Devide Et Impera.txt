It?s winter again, gloom and darkness returns
Oh, night you beautiful only lit by the moon
I reach out for the cold light
Weeping take me away, away!!!

(I pass out drained of blood)
Later I wake up again

As I wander through my divine dreams
I see my rising unholy kingdom
Beyond the mountains dark and endless forests
Oh, unholy kingdom!

This my divine world
Not known to other mortals
Came to me by visions and dreams
In a time before time

Later I wake up again
Lying in my blood on the moisty ground
With yet another recollection
Of the past where I belong

Now I shall gather all the wolves
And beat those little lambs
Vengeance is now mine -
Devide et impera!
