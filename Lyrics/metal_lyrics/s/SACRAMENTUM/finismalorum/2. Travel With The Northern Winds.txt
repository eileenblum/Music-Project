I will travel in the night
To ancient hills and darkend forests
I am a human lost in time
And I was told that I?m no mortal

Travel with the northern winds
May the forest overpower you
Up in the sky and by the horizon
Deep in the depths and deep into the earth
Darkness is whispering - You?re now deceased
Now you will see the ancient ones for real

I travel with the northern winds
And I don?t belong among mortals
My soul is in the astral skies
While my body hides in darkness

My blackened mind dreaming of the ancient
Thinking back of the past
Where my soul shall dwell
Trapped into this lifeless empty shell

I am freezing and my blood is cold
