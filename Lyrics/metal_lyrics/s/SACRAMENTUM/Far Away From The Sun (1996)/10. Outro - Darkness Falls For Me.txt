Sacramentum hail all those who have given us sincere
support thus far. No one or nothing will be forgotten...

Ever since man for the first time walked the earth frustration has
shattered his soul. Now this seed of desolation has grown to
proportions far beyond control, and call for to be released from its
prison of flesh. For centuries we have waited for the day when the
rivers shall flow with the blood of those who oppose us. Time has
come, blood shall be spilled... Ad majorem Satanae gloriam!
