I see creations
from the very depth of my soul.
I hear the voices
from the very depth of my mind.

I who embrace myself
shall reign supreme and rule my dreams.
Falling into an abyss
of infinite space and grieving stars,
where the sepulchral oceans
rest with calm and sing their hymns.

I called to the dead, the drowsed.
Awake! Arise! Dive in the burning lake.

I have seen the vision
and I've heard the voice.
Blessed ones, join my journey
and set your sails to our lost realms.
Images from long lost times
is flashing before my eyes.
The majesty of my own dreams
reflecting black cold plains.
I've seen the vision
and I have heard the voice.
Blessed ones, join my journey
and set your sails to our lost realms.

I am the vision and the loudest voice.
I have left cold flames from the deepest hell.
Grey shapes upon a black moonless sky
carry me beyond mortal way of life.
