[Music:Brolycke, Rudolfsson Lyrics:Karlen]

I stand at the fate of a dying world. 
I look upon a sky that wears the colour of devastation. 
Loud mumbles are heard that were chanted ages ago. 
The moon is dancing in a chaos of visions, 
bloodred colours that penetrates mind and soul my head is to explode, 
my body dies. 
It's coming, the coming of chaos. 
Chaos come, chaos come closer.
