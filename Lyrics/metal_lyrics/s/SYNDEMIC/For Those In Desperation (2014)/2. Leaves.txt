I feel nothing
Except afflicting darkness
Creeping inside
My empty chest

Searching a gateway
No one remains to stick by
Internal void
Condemned alone

Draining the own existence
Who allowed you to leave?
Captured within the nowhere
Leaves once green turned into black!

Faded shape of beauty from my arms
Bright eyes, accomplished shape!

Withered blossom
Bleached from internal anguish
Nothing remains
To hide away

Mental perdition
Craving for my salvation
Desperation
Leaching my mind

Draining the own existence
Who allowed you to leave?
Captured within the nowhere
I see your face!

Down the gallery of pain
You are the passion inside my veins!

Suffering in deep regret
Leaves once green turned into black!
