Awaken...
To visions of endless demise
Arisen from plans of my own
Distortion of feelings
Pushed to extremes

The will
The suffer
The path of failure divides
Aware
I chose
The irreversible line
I know
I see
How death is meant to be
Exile
In time
Resonance complex
...inside!

Like water...
The weakness flows in the veins
Replacement of blood
An endless disease

Entering spheres
You are
Unable to
Follow me

The will
The suffer
The path of failure divides
Aware
I chose
The irreversible line
I know
I see
How death is meant to be
Exile
In time
Echoing

All pleasures gone
Cross the border

See me walking by
Beckoning the last
...time!

Resonance complex

I Reach the light
Calming down the pain
I feel no more
This is my last farewell
