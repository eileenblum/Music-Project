Absent
Veiling in a corner
Silence
Displaced by your weeping
Shocked
By my awful
Intention

Nothing more
But fear in opened eyes

Paranoia
Engulfs reality
Your paranoia
Feeds anxiety

Nothing more
But fear

I am chasing
In the wake of dawn
You are static
Can you feel my breath?
Silence
In the face of dawn

Vision
Blinded by distraction
Wilted credence corrupts rationality
Shocked
By your

...paranoia
Engulfs reality
Your paranoia
Feeds anxiety

Nothing more
But fear
...in opened eyes

I am chasing
In the wake of dawn
You are static
Can you feel my breath?
Silence
In the face of
...dawn!

I arose
From your sanity

Endure the silence
Behind the nil
...of nowhere!

I can feel your fear
I am the progeny of sorrow
