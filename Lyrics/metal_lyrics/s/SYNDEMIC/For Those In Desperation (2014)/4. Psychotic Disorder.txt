Are you real?
Make up your mind
Finished routine
Human bonds disavowed
The way you live
Essence of life is passing by
Come beyond
Mure your soul
Follow my lead
The only way
To tolerate existence
Is to find your path
Beyond the pain

Apathy
Indifference
Lack of concern
Reality's perverted
Behold
Endure
Accept it!

Glare into your eyes
Alone in deep despair
Punished by your birth
Within a state of fear

Glare into your eyes
Shines through

Finally
You're in my arms
See the difference
Painless and calm
Your spirit's gone
No mourn remains
Now you are mine!
Feel secure
Under my shelter
Expose yourself
To unusual environs
Do not look back!

Apathy
Tribulation
Sorrowfulness
Vulnerability
Despise, avoid, decry it!
Enter eternal
...sleep!

Glare into your eyes
Alone in deep despair
Punished by your birth
Within a state of fear

Glare into your eyes
Shine through

Glare into your eyes
Shines through your demise
