Beyond control
There lies a deeper sense in motion
For every move slows down
There's a need to get clean

Possession
Weakening
Clarity completely out of your reach
Macerate
Innerly
No time to breathe

Drowned
Deep
Into
Me

Help
Care
About
Me

Failure in progress
Sensoric deprivation
Partial blindness
Spectral patterns disappear

Thought labyrinth
For those in desperation

Spiralling
Lose control
Falling down into despair
Capturing
Contorted dreams
Eviscerated

Drowned
Deep
Get out OF
Me

Failure in progress
Sensoric deprivation
Partial blindness
spectral patterns disappear

Drowned
Deep
Into
Me

Lost
All
Mind
Control
