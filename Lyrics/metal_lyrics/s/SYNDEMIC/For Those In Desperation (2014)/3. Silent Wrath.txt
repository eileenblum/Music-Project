Your face reflected in the window
Behind the curtain there's just emptiness to see
In deep waters there's a shallow
In search for reasons I haven't found it
...yet!

Scars on my hands
Flashback of the screams
Agony
Streaks of blood

She's still residing here
Watcher of all the steps i take
Silent wrath!

The time is imminent and fading
Signs not to wait for her returning the next day
A volitional amnesia
I take the memories away of when i cut her
...throat!

Scars on my hands
I can hear the screams
Agony
Streaks of
...blood!

She's still residing here
Cold air in my neck, she's behind me
Silent wrath
...in dead eyes!

Channel through the silhouettes
eternally haunted

...residing here
Cold air in my neck, she's behind me
Silent wrath
...in dead eyes!

She still caresses me
Her ghost caresses me
