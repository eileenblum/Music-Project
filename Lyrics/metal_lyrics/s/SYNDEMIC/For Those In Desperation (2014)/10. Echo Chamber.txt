Paralysed I can not feel
Falling not just physically
I close my eyes
For every thing that's still to come

Help me my son
I have fallen and can't get up
Reach for my arms
my hands are to weak
to hold on to you

The downfall abrupt
Synthetic sleep
Locked into the chamber
Where sorrow echoes
Lucid dreaming uncontrollable
Recognizing all the voices I know
But beside all the fears crawling through me
They still linger

I
Do not
Want
To Die!

Losing ground
In a static fall
Let all form
Become
...blurred!

The downfall abrupt
Synthetic sleep
Locked into the chamber
Where sorrow echoes
Lucid dreaming uncontrollable
Recognizing all the voices I know
But beside all the fears crawling through me
They still linger
