Dark void
Falling endlessly
Wincing deep inside

Blackness
Of abysmal structures
Cephalic impulse

Flickering colors fading
Misshapen patterns floating

Exhaustion
Evanescence of ease
Implorations unheard

Complete anguish
Almost unbearable
What is the reason for this?

Seconds
Of delirium
White figures in sight

Blackness
Of abysmal structures
Cephalic impulse

Exhaling impossible
Respiratory distress

Exhaustion
Evanescence of ease
Implorations unheard

Complete anguish
Almost unbearable
What is the reason for this?

Exhaustion
Evanescence of ease
Implorations unheard
...unheard!
