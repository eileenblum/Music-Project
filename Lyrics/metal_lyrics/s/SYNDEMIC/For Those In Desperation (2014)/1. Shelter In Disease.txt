Awareness of this narrow
Freezing my motion
The silence of this room creates this disease

These walls
So insurmountable

Prison
My sense for freedom
Selfdestruct

I can not remember
How health feels like
Artificial light defeats the rhythm
I will perceive
The mere disorder

This sorrow
Inevitable
I suffer
I construct
My own
...shelter in disease!

Shelter in disease!

My life in fragments
Chaotic as destructive minds

And I do know
the mere disorder

Lost in
My sense for freedom
Reveries

This sorrow
Inevitable
I suffer
I construct
My own shelter in disease!

Shelter in disease!

There must not be
Deliverance
An Escape from
The outside world
The will to endure what common man
Guides into oblivion
The will to be forgotten
The will to be alone
