Gentlemen, it is my duty
to inform you of one beauty
though I'd ask of you a favour
oh' to seek her for a while
though I own she is a creature
of character and feature
no worse could paint the picture
of the queen of all Argyll

and if you could see her there
boys, if you had just been there
the swan was in her movement
and the morning in her smile
all the roses in the garden
they'd bow and ask her pardon
for not one could match the beauty
of the queen of all Argyll
on the evening that I mention
I passed with light intention
through a part of our dear country
known for beauty and for style
being a place of noble thinkers
of scholars and great drinkers
but above them all for splendour
was the queen of all Argyll

and if you could see...

so my lads I need must leeve you
my intention's not to grieve you
nor indeed would I deceive you
but I'll see you in a while
I must find a way to gain her
to court her and to tame her
I fear my heart's in danger
of the queen of all Argyll

and if you could see...
