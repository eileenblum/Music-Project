I wish I had a hairdryer
to blow you to the moon
I wish I was a bakerman
curing hunger soon
I wish I had a beaver cap
it looks like Daniel Boone
I keep a wish in my heart

I wish I had a girlfriend
who would drive me away
I wish I was a president
I'd rule the world all night and day
I wanna' see what's never been seen
I wanna' live in angel's dreams
we're never satisfied

but we don't know what we say

I want to see the holy ghost
but he is anywhere at most
I want to paint a red door black
but painting black makes me feel really bad
come on lass' we can go together
let's take the place right now
we're never satisfied

but we don't know what we say
