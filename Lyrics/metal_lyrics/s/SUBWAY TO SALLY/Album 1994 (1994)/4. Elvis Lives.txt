When a cold wind blows
and you don't know where to go
baby don't be scared, don't be scared
in your darkest night
when nothin' is all right
baby don't be sad, don't be sad

Elvis is not dead
he comes and goes
in disguise he's on the road

out there on your own
you're feelin' all alone
baby don't you cry, don't you cry
on your longest day
you can find your way
baby don't be blue, don't be blue

Elvis is not dead
he comes and goes
in disguise he's on the road
