I don't have any money
all out of nickels and dimes
ridin' around in the subway
just like a sign of these times
but it's fine down the line
at the end of the tunnel
shines a light I call Sally
and Sally tells me she's mine
any time

Subway to Sally
ridin' from station to station
Sally's my destination

keep your slow boat to China
your jet plane faster than sound
keep your luxury liner
I get around underground

Subway to Sally
ridin' from station to station
Sally's my destination
