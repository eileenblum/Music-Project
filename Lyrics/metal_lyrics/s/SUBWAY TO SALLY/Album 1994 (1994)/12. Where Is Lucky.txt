I'm over here in the sand
a foreign face in foreign land
and every hour is like a year
I'm growin' old while over here
we're all for one and one for all
waitin' for the sky to fall
and when it hits some will die
but if I don't you'll hear me cry

tell me where is Lucky
Lucky was my only friend

I never met the enemy
still I suppose he's just like me
he loves his kids he loves his flag
and fits inside a body bag
and over there on the other side
the other guys can't sleep tonight
the fire's rainin' it's rainin' down
and through it all I hear the sound

tell me where is Lucky
Lucky was my only friend

and if you wanna' tll me something
tell me why we couldn't stay together
