Night sky has no more beauty without the moon and the stars
I can feel all those past times by each breath
Such smell of rotting corpses after a deadly war
I can feel my fall under this darkness

Faded beauty
Dark nights...
Pains of existence

Sounds of loneliness will call me back
So all lights will turn to black
Wounds of mortal life from every side
Have no signs to show or compass
There is no difference between dreams and nightmares if you have no hope to continue...
Sounds of loneliness will call me back
So all lights will to black
Wounds of mortal life from every side
Have no sign to show or compass
There is no difference between dreams and nightmares if you have no hope to continue...
