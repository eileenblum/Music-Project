So cold... cracked frozen veins by nothingness.
A sound from an empty room, empty and silent, indelible deadly fear
Muted twitters of dying grey birds
Muted nocturnal lullaby for thousands of unborn children
So cold...
Take my hand to dance with tramp winds
Take my hand to go far away from here

Come, join us to sing
For the fallen morbid leaves
This path goes to an end
So sing by muted breaths

And tonight outside from this room, a death angel will sing a song for the
Men that are
Buried with their dreams
And the weeping sky cries for them one more time, again
...and again.
