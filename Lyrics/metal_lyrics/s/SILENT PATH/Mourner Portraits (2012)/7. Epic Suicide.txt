A painting on the wall with blood
A face of a mother beside her child
And tears which have fallen from their eyes
A field without a scarecrow
An inflamed field without any plants

Epic suicide for the soldiers
A way to salvation by self destruction
Just kill and die to become a hero
So embrace your glory and walk to death
Your death...
