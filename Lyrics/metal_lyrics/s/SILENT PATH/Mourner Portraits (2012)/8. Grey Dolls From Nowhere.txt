A man with blinded eyes is searching for his lost one
And a night full of misery... maybe an eternal night for him and us
And a torn sky over him, a torn sky by the silent cry of a broken heart...

And beyond the way a woman, with two eyes in one hand
And a bleeding heart in her other hand

And a smile on her lips...
And a smile on her lips...
