There is a place that you must learn to kill your brother
Don't look at his eyes, don't care about his tears, kill him

You must understand the meaning of supremacy
So do not care about that lonely child at the corner of her empty room
So put your gun at her face, "your country is proud of you"
"your country is proud of you"...
You must understand the meaning of supremacy...
