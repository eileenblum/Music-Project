I can't breathe anymore
'Cause the pain has grown so strong
And all that I need
Is more than I can get
I think of you every second
I dream of you every night
The only thing I pray for
Is you and me to unite

And I'm crying tears of pain everytime I call your name
And I ever wished but I always knew that you won't love me

I sit alone in the darkness
I watch the rising sun
I'm counting all of those hours
But I know it can't be done
I touched your skin and I kissed you
A hundred thousand times
But only in my mind

And I'm crying tears of pain everytime I call your name
And I ever wished but I always knew that you won't love me
