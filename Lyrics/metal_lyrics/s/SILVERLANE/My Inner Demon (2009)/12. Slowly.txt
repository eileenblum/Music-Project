The most precious thing in life is the mind
It keeps all the feelings and memories of all kind
Your memory's so strong, there are things you won't forget
It keeps everything beloved alive

She'd known for a long time she will die
These are the words that she gave me by:

"Follow me slowly... I will be waiting for you."

Her shiny light burned darker, oh, from day to day
But she always smiled and said: "Don't cry for me... just pray."
Oh my God, she was so strong... Why did you take her away from me?
I'll never see the sense of that tragedy

She'd known for a long time that she'd go far away
When we were holding hands she used to say:

"Follow me slowly... I will be waiting for you."

And as she'd closed her eyes... her words remain.
