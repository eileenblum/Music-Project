Deep inside this mood
It's rising like the moon
I hate it and I love it
My change, it will come soon
Once there was a bite
I knew that I was lost
The creature crapped my neck
Bloodlust was the cause

The moon is full and all I want and all I need is blood!

The hunt begins, blank is my mind
I'm howling and crawling 
I'm one of their kind
Blood and flesh and bones will be mine
I'm angry and raging
I'm out of my mind
I'm one of their kind

A man walks all alone
In the silence of the night
His destiny is made
I know that he's the right
It only takes a second
To bite his neck and kill
I want for him in darkness
His mortal fear's my thrill

The moon is full and all I want and all I need is blood!

The hunt begins, blank is my mind...
