I've found a book of magic and I hold it in my hand
Dusty pages of wisdom are my destiny
A hundred years have passed since the final spell was cast
Immortal life and power for eternity

I think I've found the sense behind my life
I think I've finally found what I was longing for

And I will fly on the wings of eternity
I will cast the spell tonight
I will leave the way of mortality
I will leave my mortal life behind

The final day was coming but my life won't dissappear
I'll change the way of nature before the end seems near
Tell me... Did you ever feel like being a God?
Or did you ever fall into your mortal fear?

I think I've found the sense behind my life
I think I've finally found what I was longing for

And I will fly on the wings of eternity...
