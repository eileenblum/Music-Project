Now here I am after my way across the sea
And after all these days of blood... I've lost my faith
Now the prophecy has failed in, oh, so many ways
I can't describe what I've seen in all those days

Lifeless land!
I was fighting for such a long time...
Dunes of sand!
And I curse them 'cause nothing here's divine

Here in my kingdom sand
In the desert that kills my soul
I am the king of my land
But I feel tired and so alone

The sandstorm chases my dream away
A dream of my beloved home
I see the Fata Morgana there
But now it's gone

I can't stand!
The heat is burning my skin before I die
Unholy land!
They know that there's no sense but still they try

Here in my kingdom sand...
