Every night a dream reminds me of what I've done and of what I am
The years have passed but I still clearly see every detail of the guilt of mine

I can't erase the things I've done so far away
And I beseech you: "Save me!"

Calling for you!
Rescue my soul when I'm calling for you!
The taste of sin!
Calling for you!
Please take it all away, I'm calling for you, my God!

Everywhere sinful shadows around me, I try to stop, but I just can't resist
I feel the sweet taste of temptation and its all around me now.

I still try to forget the things I've done, so far away.
But my consiensce just kills me.

Calling for you! ...

In the silence of the night, my thoughts still hold me tight
No, I can't forget them. Please make them go away!

I can't erase the things I've done so far away and
My consiensce just kills me.

Calling for you! ...
