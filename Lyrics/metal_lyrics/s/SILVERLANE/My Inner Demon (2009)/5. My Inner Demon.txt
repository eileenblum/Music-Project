I can feel your touch on my skin
You're oh so near
And I just can't dissappear from your view
And it's forever

It's so hard to chase you away, 'cause you will stay by me forever

I know you're right by my side
I feel, I see, I hear you
And you try to destroy my peaceful life
You fight, you hurt inside
You're living inside of me now!

I can see your face in my dreams
A face of death indeed
Your voice always runs through my head
But I just can't hear what you say

It's so hard to chase you away 'cause you will stay forever
How can I defeat the demon in me forever?

I know you're right by my side
I feel, I see, I hear you
And you try to destroy my peaceful life
You fight, you hurt inside
When will this nightmare ever end?
I scream, I cry out loudly
You're living inside of me, when will you leave me?
