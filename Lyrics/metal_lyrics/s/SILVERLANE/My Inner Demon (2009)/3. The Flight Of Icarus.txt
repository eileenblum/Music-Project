Let's break the force of gravity
Let's leave the labyrinth behind
Fly on the wings of insanity
Break all the chains and rules of the human kind, my son

Free, free like the wind
Up in the sky
I want to spread my wings and fly
Fly like a God
Just spread your wings, and fly with me

After a flash of megalomenia
I feel the sunlight burn my skin
No one can stop me I fly right into the sun
Above all birds as high as the Gods

Hear me calling! Can't you see, I'm falling
See me flying! I'm so glad, 'cause I am

Free, free like the wind...

I'm so high, this is the time to fly away
My dreams come true, 'cause I am

Free, free like the wind...
