When the moon is rising and the night begins
I'm in agony
Behind the mountains beside the lake of tears
Is my unnamed destination
I won't keep a stiff upper lip
I will finish this unpleasant trip

I feel a kind of miracle I got this holy chance

I wanna feel it, I want to taste the miracle

I walk a long way to become immortal
Immortal for my love
Dusty pages of life suddenly make sense
I leave the state of trance
I go down into the magic hollow
I see it's behind the narrow way

I feel a kind of miracle I got this holy chance

I wanna feel it, I want to taste the miracle

I'm reaching out my hands
To take this untold chance

I feel a kind of miracle I got this holy chance
I feel a kind of miracle I got this holy chance

I wanna feel it, I want to taste the miracle
