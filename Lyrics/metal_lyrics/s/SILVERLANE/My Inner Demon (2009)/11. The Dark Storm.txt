The clouds turn black and they're hiding the sun
The day has turned to night
No ray of light can meet my eyes
And the wind begins to blow

Dark awaking, the Earth is shaking, all is tremblin now

I feel the dark storm is near
And still getting closer
I fight against my fear
I'm longing for the rain

The rain touches my skin, washes away all of my sin
On the mountain I climbed up high
I hold on with my hand on the rock on which I stand
And I feel the power of the sky

The Gods of weather rage together and play with thunder and lightning

I feel the dark storm is near
And still getting closer
I fight against my fear
I'm longing for the rain
