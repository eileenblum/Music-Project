Our last breath on our last day
wwhen there's no time left to pray
for rebirth or transcendence
That final path, rise or descent
no one knows where it will end
In heaven or hell?

Longing for eternity
right before the end
We're falling into a deep black hole
We're descending to be free

[Ref.:]
When the end is near
will we see the light?
Will there be something worth waiting for?
When the end is near
will we see the light?
Will there be something worth waiting for?

Our life is fading
into deep black
We're falling deeper
there's no turn-back
From a world full of silence
Immaterial, a second life
Another chance
on the other side
Is it heavon or hell?

Fall into infinity,
when we reach the light
We pray to god for paradise,
we're transcending to be free

[Ref.]
