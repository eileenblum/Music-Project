We came out of darkness into the light
We keep on fulfilling the prophecy
Signs and miracles, divine orders showed us the way
For us to find each other on a misery day

We got the aura to enchant them
We are the masters of the night

[Ref.:]
Get ready to rock
Come on and take that feeling and keep it alive
Get ready to rock
So many bad days we had to survive
Get ready to rock
Crowds are screaming, lights are shining bright
Get ready to rock
We are the gods of the holy night
Get ready to rock!

Look at our glory days, they will nver end
Our crowd follows us around the world
Braving hearts that is one thing you can see
We altered our direction to a better path

We've changed your mind and made a new one
We are the masters of the night

[Ref.]
