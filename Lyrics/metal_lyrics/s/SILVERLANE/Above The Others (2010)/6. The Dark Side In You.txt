So you're still searching for the meaning of life
Your way was so tiring but soon you will arrive
at the place of all your dreams
You'll walk stairs of gold
You'll find eternal peace
and everything is gonna be like it's foretold
Soon they'll welcome you to the end of all your pain
It's a short one way journey and you will never return again
But they promise you light
They promise you strength
The time seems so right
This is your chance

[Ref.:]
There's no other way!
Now start, overcome
the dark side in you
There's nothing left to say
Stand up and fight
the dark side in you

Though everything is broken, please don't waste your only chance
Don't let the whishes unspoken turn into suicidal trance
First you walk on stairs of gold
but at last on broken glass
The warmth turns into cold
It's your only chance

[Ref.]

Take a look at the mirror and describe what you can see
The dark side in you
Use your faith and your power to fight and defeat
the dark side in you

[Ref.]
