Tell me what's the matter,
you woman in white?
Your eyes are so red
from the tears that you've cried
Your feet are sore from the way which you came
Your lips are shaking
Your heart is full of pain
... so full of pain.

Your mysterious beauty,
your graceful hair
It takes my breath away
It makes me stay 'n' stare
No, I'm not anxious,
you're appearing to me
It's more like a miracle,
which I'm glad I can see

[Ref.:]
Embracing the darkness
I know that you're not heartless
Waiting for your forgiveness
you hold out in darkness
Your heart is full of sadness,
longing for salvation

There's no kingdom to come
for heretics like you
The things that you've done
are still shining through
Your grief is eternal
It's your fate to be trapped
in this old mansion
and there's no way back

[Ref.:]
So were embracing the darkness...
