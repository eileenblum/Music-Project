First there was an intention,
derired by the mass
Covered by the myth and strength inside us
And all who listen
to what we say
will be protected from the final stray

We stand alone with our fantasy
We will remain still where we are

[Ref.:]
'Cause today we stand above the others
We all live in the sin of breaking the rules
'cause today we stand above the others
We all live in the sin and break the rules

Said to crib from others
Scolded a thousand times
Not innovative, oldschool
Stud with oafish rhymes
We don't think about that
Fat lot we care
We follow no one
and our mind is clear

We stand alone with our fantasy
And will remain still where we are

[Ref.]

This is the way we write our music
This is the way we live our lives
Let's not believe in what they're saying
Let's just believe in what we feel inside

We know there's nothing
that'll stop us in the end
We walk down our own way,
nothing to pretend
And everywhere
we are on stage
we rock the crowd
and fly into a rage

We stand alone with our fantasy
And will remain still where we are

[Ref.]
