You are alone
as you're walking through the night
You're creeping quietly
until you find a place that's right
A place between the trees
will give eternal peace
to those who die
and to you

You dig a hole
and you bury them into the ground
as deep as you can,
make sure they won't be found
There's a voice inside your head,
the language of the dead,
it speaks to you
That's what it says:

"YOU'RE A MURDERER!!!"
