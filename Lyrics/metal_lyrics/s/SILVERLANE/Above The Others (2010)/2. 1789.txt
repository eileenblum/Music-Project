We're burning down to ashes the places we have been
We use our raging power for changing everything
We can rule the world, together we are strong
Yes, we will build a future to which we belong
Now in this time of endless crime
it's up to us to fight for our rights!

[Ref.:]
Now we are here to break the law
Let's start a revolution
Leave the bad days behind
Create another world
Now we were born
to free ourselves,
to start that revolution
Let the riot begin
to start a better world for us all

Tormented by starvation, being jogged just every day
We need a change of power to stop the decay
An empire full of bloodshed has now come to an end
Let's fight for our freedom, let's start to defend
Now can't you see? We're no minority
It's up to you to fight for your rights!

[Ref.:]
Now we are here to break the law
Let's start a revolution
Leave the bad days behind
Create another world
Now we were born
to set us free,
to start that revolution
Let the riot begin
to start a better world for us all
