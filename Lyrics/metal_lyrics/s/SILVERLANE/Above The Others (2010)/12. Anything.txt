Everywhere I turn
Everywhere I go
I can't hear anything

All these things around
Nobody there to talk to
They don't know anything
since the day you've gone
There's just no one for me like you
so I'm alone

[Ref.:]
I can hear your voice
when the wind calls your name
I can see your face
when I close my eyes again
I still feel you're here
even though you are so far away

Every day's so hard
and I miss you so
I miss just everything
I'd give anything
just to get you back here
I'd give just everything

Since the day you've gone
there's no one just like you
and I miss you so

[Ref.:]
I can hear your voice
when the wind calls your name
I can see your face
when I close my eyes again
I still feel you're here
I feel it every single day
I know you're so near
even though you are so far away
