Down on your knees
you ask for prayers to end your pain
"Help me, please!"
you keep on saying it again
Your days of penance
seem like a point of no return
Eternal vengeance
starts to hurt and burn

There's this yearning deep inside you
There's nothing else you wanna do

[Ref.:]
"Can you save my soul
from these days of sorrow?
Can you take away
all these years of pain?
Can you save my soul?
'Cause there's no tomorrow
on the other side
There's another life waiting for me..."

You listen to (the) silence
and watch the darkness every night
Your last desire
is to step into the light

Pain keeps on burning deep inside you
The only thing you wanna do

[Ref.]

You feel this pain still deep inside you
There's nothing else you wanna do

[Ref.]
