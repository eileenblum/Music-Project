I'm counting my scars
I'm looking for answers, there's pain in my mind
I'm nobody's fool
I'm planning to leave this place of darkness
I will break free through this fatal trip in time
No one can stop me!

Drifting, I'm falling, I'm falling apart

[Ref.:]
My last day on earth
Relieving my mind
I'm leaving this emptiness behind
I'm ready to start
my travel in space
I'm starting a trip to an unknown place
My last day on earth

I am the master of my own fate
These days are over
There's no chance to return
No one can stop me!

Drifting, I'm falling, I'm falling apart

[Ref.]

I'm falling apart
I'm drifting away
My time goes by
I'm feeling this way

He left the right way to get lost in space
He left the right way to die

[Ref.]
