I am following the most meaningful trace
And I'm looking for the most notable place
Step by step and day by day
I am feeling like some human clay
I want to clear my path of pain
Clear my thoughts, let it rain
The adder's venom's burning under my skin
I am feeling like the tin of sin

[Ref.:]
Is life only a game
Is it only a game
Is life only a game
Please god tell me if life is only a game

I am crawling around with bleeding knees
The feeling of pain is too great to be on my feet
Step by step and day by day
I feel my life just leads me astray
Tears of time and tears of pain
dropping down in the rain
I am feeling like an angel wth broken wings
I'm crying, I'm dying, I'm paying for my sins

[Ref.]

When I feel this way
sometimes I fall astray
deep in my heart
Now come and save my soul
before it falls apart
Pain is running through my veins
Please tell me life is just a game

[Ref.]

The adder's venom burns under our skin
We're feeling like the tin of sin
