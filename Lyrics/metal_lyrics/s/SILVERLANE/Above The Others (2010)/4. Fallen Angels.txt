You take the presence and you turn it into fear! Yeah!
See all's left broken down and hope will disappear! Yeah!
You're calling, I'm falling! There's always my death with me!
You're violent and silent! I'm screaming out: Rescue me!

[Ref.:]
When no one hears the prophecy
but fallen angels
When all is left in poverty
by fallen angels
guiding me

You make my nightmare and this morning is premiere! Yeah!
You waste my day till night and end up my career! Yeah!
I'm calling, you're falling! There's always my death with me!
You're violent and silent! I'm screaming out: Rescue me!

[Ref.:]
When no one hears the prophecy
but fallen angels
When all is left in poverty
by fallen angels

And you say that you would be my healer
But for my life I fear that you're the stealer
I'm calling, you're falling! There's always my death with me!
You're violent and silent! I'm screaming out: Rescue me!

[Ref.:]
When no one hears the prophecy
but fallen angels
When all is left in poverty
by fallen angels
I fall into insanity
with fallen angels
I loose myself in misery
'cause falling angels
are guiding me
