Posessed by the devil a long time ago
The fire of love burned inside
You saw no way out, you've misunderstood
the terms for getting things right

Those four eyes that watch you
you think your children's eyes
Sleeping in silence, peaceful and quiet, so helpless...

[Ref.:]
You know exactly what to do!
The golden needle belongs to you!
There's nothing else that you can do!
The golden needle belongs to you!

Driven by madness and blinded by fear
to lose the love of your life
No one will ever find out what you did
in that cold winter night

Those four eyes are sleeping
You try to make them blind
Your footsteps, you're creeping
Kill them in silence, your blood is so cold,
you're godless!

[Ref.]

Embracing the darkness
I know that you're not heartless

Now it's done, there's no witness
of this perfect crime
You wipe away the blood from your needle
They look like they're sleeping
Peaceful and quiet, so helpless...

[Ref.]
