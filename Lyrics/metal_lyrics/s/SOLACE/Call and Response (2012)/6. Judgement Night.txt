Here I stand on trial again
You're so quick to write me off this time
But I've forsaken everything and everyone
I've got nothing left to lose

Call me a joke
It's calming, familiar
I'm not leaving empty-handed
I'll take everything from you
Call me a joke
Because I'm laughing on the inside
I'll take everything from you

This curse turned out to be a blessing in disguise

Strip down the network to reveal the fear in your eyes
This curse turned out to be a perfect blessing in disguise
Soon they'll follow suit and drop like fucking flies
This curse turned out to be a perfect blessing in disguise

I've got nothing left to lose

Call me a joke
It's calming, familiar
I'm not leaving empty-handed
I'll take everything from you
Call me a joke
Because I'm laughing on the inside
I'll take everything from you
