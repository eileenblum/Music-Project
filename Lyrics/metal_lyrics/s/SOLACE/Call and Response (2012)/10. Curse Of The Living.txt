I wish it were as simple as to call on the one who could put this all to rest
My voice unanswered
The same as yours, It hits the wall and echoes back
It's hard to recall
Though we've seen it all come full circle in every which way
With no evidence, there'll be no consequence
So live your life for you and no one else

I've walked to the ends of the earth only to return empty-handed
(Don't come crawling back when all your hope is lost)
And we can't move on until we feel safe in ourselves
(Don't come crawling back when all your hope is lost)
So make peace with this world, as this world is where you're destined to stay
(Don't come crawling back when all your hope is lost)
Let's clear the guilt from the air to ensure a better tomorrow
(Don't come crawling back when all your hope is lost)

Forsaken by something we can't understand
The curse of the living is found in death itself

I want to see your face the moment you realize you've lived your life based on falsities
This guilt will bleed you dry
