Forgive me
But the fact of the matter is the evidence doesn't tip the scale in your direction
I'll never compromise my own free will for anything
Til' now this issue never hit so close to home

You'll never understand how the sheer thought of this place makes my skin crawl
All persuasion rendered useless
I'll never surrender my own free will for anything
Til' now this issue never hit so close to home
With each morning I grow fonder of this apathy
My blatant disregard for faith that never was

Though some may say that I have fallen out of reach
I'd rather be a lost soul searching, paving my own way

With each morning I grow fonder of this apathy
My blatant disregard for faith that never was

What good is this if I can leave it all behind?
We're all the same
What good is this if we can leave it all behind?
So walk away from everything you knew
Tomorrow brings forth a new day
We're all the same
What good is this if we can leave it all behind?

Though some may say that I have fallen out of reach
I'd rather be a lost soul searching, paving my own way
With each morning I grow fonder of this apathy
My blatant disregard for faith that never was
