Another day begins
But we can barely see the sun
Isolation: A curse, a blessing all in one
Behold as the ash fills the air
Feel it drown us with every breath we take
Close your eyes and dream of what you'll leave behind

Behind the mask you try to act so innocent
Because of you I now know the difference between capture and surrender

So, let go
I've witnessed every selfish act of man and still nothing moves me
How can I take the blame when we are all the cause and the cure?

Behind the mask you try to act so innocent
Because of you I now know the difference between capture and surrender
