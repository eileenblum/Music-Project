I'll never understand how you analyze fiction
My eyes will not deceive
It's become an endless obsession
So tell me why you're so inclined
To search for the one who will punish the sons for the sins of the father
Search for the one who will never show his face

Pure ignorance is your curse
Or is it your cross to bear?
Repent
Hold on to your savior
Repent
Now go ahead and pray for tomorrow
For a day that will never come
Pray for tomorrow
Pray for the day that will never fucking come

Free your mind

Why won't you admit there is something more to this?
Why won't you admit there is something more?

Search for the one who will punish the sons for the sins of the father
Search for the one who will never show his face
