You're all the same, running in circles
Destined to destroy what took so long to create
As you point your finger at everyone but yourself

Today I learned one of life's many lessons
Some things can't be undone
It won't let me forget, no matter how hard I try
In my search for answers more questions will arise
My fate will be uncovered, destiny realized

Will this ever end?

Nothing more than pawns on the front lines
This game was designed to break us all

Now who said that we can't turn back the hands of time
And who said that we can't erase it all, start over again
But still she dies
So you'd rather fight just to stay alive
Because to coexist is to compromise

Nothing more than pawns on the front lines
This game was designed to break us all
I won't wait for my fate to unwind
This game was designed to break us all
