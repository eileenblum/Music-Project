This is an act of betrayal, committed so selfishly
Whoever said the truth would prevail never claimed responsibility

You're absolutely right, let's blame it on a lack of self control
You play with fire, and I'll bring the gasoline
Burning bridges never felt like this before
It never felt so fucking good like this before

This is an act of betrayal, committed so selfishly
Whoever said the truth would prevail never claimed responsibility

Before the tears run down your face, just heed this warning
Though I lay thee down to sleep, we both know I'll be gone by morning

The smoke's too thick to find our way out
Nobody sleeps tonight
No one sleeps tonight
