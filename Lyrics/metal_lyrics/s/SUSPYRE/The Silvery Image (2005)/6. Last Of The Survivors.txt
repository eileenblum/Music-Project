[Music: Rossetti, Lyrics: Barton]

Last of the Survivors
Drawn to lands of lost
Capacity of mind
For a bitter cost

The deathly go to waste
Upon the spoiling lands
Overdrawn memory of
Decay upon hands

Finally
Eyse have dawned
The peace of mind
and sanity gone
For the blind
Never see
The sweet taste of
death eternally

Enchantment of voices
Between every thought
A young man in struggle
His world torn apart

Mistake of confessions
Survivor of the... (the end)
Heaven will not wait for
The dark hearts of men

Hearts of men...

Finally
Eyse have dawned
The peace of mind
and sanity gone
For the blind
Never see
The sweet taste of
death eternally

Finally
Eyse have dawned
The peace of mind
and sanity gone
For the blind
Never see
The sweet taste of
death eternally
