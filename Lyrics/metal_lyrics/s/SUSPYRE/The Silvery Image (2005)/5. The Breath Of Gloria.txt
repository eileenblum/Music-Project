[Music: Skibinsky, Rossetti, Myers, Lyrics: Barton]

So the world closed its eyes
And youÂ´re covered in shades
My girl, I loved your voice
In songs of desperate hate

(You sang) for everyone else
(A song) that eased my world
(The love) you gave faithfully
(It all) falls for the girl

She breathes from the clouds
And fails in her effort
To fall from the smoke
ThatÂ´s surrounding her

(You sang) you sang to me
(I fell) Forever
(My life) IÂ´ll gladly give mine
(For her) falling under

Gloria, oh gloria
Your life of secrecy
Gloria, oh gloria
Find your way back home

How do I kill your thirst
The heart of your coldness
I burn for your desire
To calm my emptiness

(And now) you take my breath
(My life) the skin you held
(My girl) I sign for you
(A song) and nothing else

Gloria, oh gloria
Your life of secrecy
Gloria, oh gloria
Find your way back home

YouÂ´ll never forget my lips
IÂ´m forever you temptress

Will you satiate my mind
Let me breathe you one more time

IÂ´m the angel of your need
The illusions come from me

My expectations of life
Closed the world before my eyes

IÂ´ll take whispers of pity
But remember you need me

I need only memories
Of what Gloria gave me

Gloria, oh gloria
Your life of secrecy
Gloria, oh gloria
Find your way back home

Gloria, oh gloria
Your life of secrecy
Gloria, oh gloria
Find your way to me
