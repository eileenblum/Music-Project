[Music: Rossetti, Skibinsky, Myers, Lyrics: Barton]

A narrow vision of a child
Streaming the emerald scenes
We are the slivery image
On an apex of green

IÂ´m your temptation
I have recently been
Strangling your voice
Do you hear my screams
I am the pulsing rage
Between the noise

Take that vision and find a goal
Please liste carefully
Life will shake the world around you
Before you move your feet

DonÂ´t ever be consumed by your passion
Leave it in the spirit of your children

This is light
You should know
You are the last hope

IÂ´m waiting
To hear you
I want to believe

All this time
You had me
You are my reason

My apex
YouÂ´re watching
The changing of me

This is the silence of your mind
I hope that you take the chances
This time...
