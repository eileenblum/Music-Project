[Music: Rossetti, Lyrics: Barton, O'Hara]

The lift of the Gods
Left bu weary souls
A phantasm held in words to unfold
Left behind the lands
Death in black clouds
The dark armor of the warriors stand

Fall by deceit of the child
Sons of the damned
Sadly the manÂ´s unaware
Of victory in hands

Kings of the servants
God hath the man
Black nights  have come
To the city under sands

(City under snads... forever lost in sands...)

The pain wonÂ´t fade
Evil the friend
In wonderment a mother cries for end
This young man
Magnificent
Warrior of light, come set us free

Fall by deceit of the child
Sons of the damned
Sadly the manÂ´s unaware
Of victory in hands

Kings of the servants
God hath the man
Black nights  have come
To the city under sands

Kings of the servants
God hath the man
Black nights  have come
To the city under sands

(City under snads...)
