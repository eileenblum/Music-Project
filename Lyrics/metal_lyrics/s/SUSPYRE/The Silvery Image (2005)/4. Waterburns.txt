[Music: Rossetti, Lyrics: Barton]

I held the world in my hands
I made colors for the sun

Building views for better men
Who worshipped me as their religion

The day my body burned
I fell and wept
Through pages of memories
I will forget

The destruction of their words
The taste of the bitter end

The leader spoke in tongues to me
I am the dead agony of men

The day my body burned
I fell and wept
Through pages of memories
I will forget

Pull on your decisions
Soften all my tears
Weeping for the symphonies of sin
Tempered forever in moments we lose
I am the shadowed remembrance of you

The movements may unravel my threads
But they will never break me

I will remember my tears
YouÂ´ll never have that my friends
My words forever praise the name
Of the forgotten face of pain

The day my body burned
I fell and wept
Through pages of memories
I will forget
