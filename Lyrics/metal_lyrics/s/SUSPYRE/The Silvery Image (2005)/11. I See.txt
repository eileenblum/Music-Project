[Music: Rossetti, Lyrics: Barton]

These are revelations to welcome grace
Your witness birth to the colder days

A message to the fallen seven
You will forever be in sight
We struggle beforethe hands of fate
And burn before tormented lies

I see the demons in heaven and sky
I see the world that crumbles and dies
I see in death each night as I sleep
I see my God killing everything
I see...

His doorway is leading to light
Seven torches on seas of ice

Four creatures who give nothing but praise
To the writings inside his scrolls
Praise be to the benevolent lamb
Who rains fire on earth from his throne

I see the demons in heaven and sky
I see the world that crumbles and dies
I see in death each night as I sleep
I see my God killing everything

Seven angels did cry
Death comes in thirds
To earth, and sea, and sky
The number of the beast
Thunder and flames
Bring men for sacrifice

The revelation is a dream
My world held for ransom
Fear my God and pray to his name
The hour of judgment comes

Evil men will drink the wrath of hell
While he covers them all in blood
Joyful are those whose dead comes in faith
They feast forever in his love

I see the demons in heaven and sky
I see the world that crumbles and dies
I see in death each night as I sleep
I see my God killing everything
I see...
