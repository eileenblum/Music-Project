[Music: Skibinsky, Lyrics: Barton]

Out of chaos comes a universe
I am weakened by the dirt beneath my feet
I am servant to my mother earth
I can hear her heart, she cries to me

I still believe in the echoes of rain
But I have nothing today
I believe in her...

These are temors of a dark revenge
The illusions of my madness eased the pain
Tonight the chorals rest upon my feet
And their melodies are running through my veins

You were the spirit in all that I was
Now I'm the lightning of gods

The horizons, fly behind us,
We ride upon the wings
Of the dragons, feel the passions
Of immortality
Mystic angels, screaming eagles
To Elysian we fly
I am thunder, and the power
Carries me beyond the distant skies

I'm now master of the earth in her
If you follow closely you can feel her needs
She is vision, she is sanity
We are the liberation of your dreams

I am your glory, I am your reward
Finally I am your lord

The horizons, fly behind us,
We ride upon the wings
Of the dragons, feel the passions
Of immortality
Mystic angels, screaming eagles
To Elysian we fly
I am thunder, and the power
Carries me beyond the distant skies

The horizons, fly behind us,
We ride upon the wings
Of the dragons, feel the passions
Of immortality
Mystic angels, screaming eagles
To Elysian we fly
I am thunder, and the power
Carries me beyond the distant skies

(I am the glory, I am the reward
Do you believe the echoes now?
Feel the spirit and feel my passion
Carry you beyond the distant skies)
