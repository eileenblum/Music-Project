The alignment of galaxies
Brings resolutions
And a Singer without words
To songs the Spirit knew then

How can you miss something so much when it was never yours to begin with? That's what you keep trying to tell yourself but it never really helps things much...does it? It always seems to be raining down on you, completely saturating the spirit. And, oh god, her expressions...her smile was always so intoxicating...so haunting...A lot of cold nights and a few too many tears shed...for the resolution of men.
