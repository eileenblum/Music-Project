April's fortunes seem to be on the rise since she has a new place for her to play. She is content in the Ivory, where people actually listen to her: she finally feels like she might be where she supposed to be. That old familiar song starts drifting back into her head every time she gazes into his eyes. It is time to teach someone else her song.

I live and breathe for my new Ivory
As I stumbled into destiny
I've followed his eyes when they come my way
And I'm taken to him today

And when his gesture
Becomes his picture
I'm simply assured
By his demeanor

Remember my song
I'm singing along
When he says it's wrong
It should be our song

And so he buys the baby grand
So he can hear my song at last
We fade to one...

I've seen my body, I've seen it unfold
It takes the senses and leads me away
But I know passion, now I know it well
These are the memories our song has made

The crowd must never be kept in suspense
So I promise the time is tonight
And then we stare to never lose our sight
Only to see someone blind our eyes

Stealing my money
I stay with my keys
Guns pointing at me
Then he starts to scream

All becomes silent
And all is content
My song's only sent
In dying torment

[Guitar solos: Gregg Rossetti/ Rich Skibinski]

I've seen my body, I've seen it unfold
It takes the senses and leads me away
But I know passion, now I know it well
These are the memories our song has made
