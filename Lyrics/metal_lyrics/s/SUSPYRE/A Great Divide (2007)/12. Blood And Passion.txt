Life never turns out exactly the way we expect it. April finally felt like she was going to be able to share her song and melody with him, but she feels like it is time to share that song. She knows what it will do to her if she plays it, but it can't be kept in any longer. After so many silent years she kneels down before the grave to play the notes...

April was never really that good for her
As she watched them lower him down
Once again there is a confinement in her
As her tears fell into broken ground

She waits until they are alone
And she plays her piano...

So unbridled, she came undone
It's time to finish your song
Oh April, overwhelming yourself
On passions held on too long

The notes send you shivering
The pain of your song ending
But still you play on...
You know that your time is done
If only you'd had someone
And still you play on...

So unbridled, she came undone
It's time to finish your song
Oh April, overwhelming yourself
On passions held on too long

Blood begins to form the stream
That drops slowly on the key
And you struggle on...
So the last note never dies
Her heart explodes deep inside
And April is gone...

So unbridled, she came undone
It's time to finish your song
Oh April, overwhelming yourself
On passions held on too long.
