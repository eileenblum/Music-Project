She still has the keys to keep her busy and that's the only thing that brings her mind back into equilibrium. However, now she's on her own and looking to make her way. There's no one to turn to in the big city and she finds herself playing for change as the trains fly by...

But I must make the most of my tie
A change of scenery
Changing fragments of this life
Standing before a city skyline
A slip of catching breath
And then caught holding too tight

With no money or a place to go
Shading their eyes at me
They shaded the train and my stage
Familiar songs come from my fingers
Dancing to stop and hear
They dance into my serenade

What dismay, I've lost my way
And still I walk this path
For moments, my sweet moments
When my piano plays at last

And then softly he gives his promise
Before I got lost in his eyes
He has a certain serenity
That only his gaze can provide

What dismay, I've lost my way
And still I walk this path
For moments, my sweet moments
When my piano plays at last

As long as I play my piano
I could be playing for his crowd
I hear my song when he speaks to me
But I've never heard it this loud

What dismay, I've lost my way
And still I walk this path
For moments, my sweet moments
When my piano plays at last
