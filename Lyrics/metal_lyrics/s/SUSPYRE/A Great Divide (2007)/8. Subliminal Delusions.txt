April is left alone to fend for herself. She's never been around love and does not know how to accept it, especially in an orphanage. Therefore, she is sent to a hospital where she can be properly evaluated. It's there that she is reunited with the keys. The sparkle in her eye seems to be fading back in when she spends time with the nurse...

Then his madness was restrained in April
As she reaches the village of children
Holding her lips into the passing years
For expirations of what should have been

Existence isn't what's slowly behind
And it's not the only thing she forgot
She is kindly playing out the symptoms
Of an embrace holding onto thoughts

Quiet as she goes
A failure in regression
Fragments of her must be uncovered
And put back together
Before we're left with none

For April there is no friendly design
Only the radio she carried through

Her song has only forgotten the way
To drive the illness that she cried into
Manipulation of her static mind
Walking into the piano they found

The psychotic composition of her
Quickly settles by the unwritten sounds

Quiet as she goes
A failure in regression
Fragments of her must be uncovered
And put back together
Before we're left with none

[Guitar solos: Gregg Rossetti/ Rich Skibinski]

Once the pieces found their way together
She found a friend before she found herself
She only waited for deliverance
From the confinement that she should have felt

The piano finds its way back to her
And the fever of her song is still strong
As we listen to April's memories
The fatal crash that killed her friend and her song

Quiet as she goes
A failure in regression
Fragments of her must be uncovered
And put back together
Before we're left with none

Her strength in those notes still makes her tremble
Her burning heart if only so subtle
