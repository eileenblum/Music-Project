Every story has two sides 
The one we take is no different 
And somewhere in the middle 
Lies a truth unfolding lucent 

So to whom do we turn? 

There are whispers never written 
There are actions never seen 
There are questions never answered 
In the darkness of the scene 

Fear leads us here 
We find our lives caught in a shell 
Now time is lost 
Somewhere between trust and ourselves 


There is silence never broken 
There are moments in between 
This is something out of nothing 
The trust only found in dreams 

Fear leads us here 
We find our lives caught in a shell 
Now time is lost 
Somewhere between trust and ourselves 

Now we can feed into the disguise 
Run our hands softly down their thighs 
What began with softly touching lips 
Is the final movement between their hips 

Lies must be broken to end the spell 
Break mine and all is well 
This curse you have placed upon us all 
Tears deep into the flaw 
This picture we keep inside our heads 
Worthy to be misled 
Deceit and deception perfected 
In this world of hatred 

Fear leads us here 
We find our lives caught in a shell 
Now time is lost 
Somewhere between trust and ourselves
