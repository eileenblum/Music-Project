Why donât we go to CancÃºn sometime 
Cause someone told me itâs beautiful there 
Would you like to take your time 
Or simply make up your mind 
The sun would look great running through your hair 

When did this dream begin? 
When did the rest of it end? 
With sand between my toes, I guess youâll never know 
The moments that could have been 

Why donât we go to CancÃºn sometime 
Where the sandâs so soft and white you sink 
We could get lost in the day 
Sipping wine at the cafÃ© 
Letting memories melt into your drink 

When did this dream begin? 
When did the rest of it end? 
With sand between my toes, I guess youâll never know 
The moments that could have been 

Why donât we go to CancÃºn sometime 
Crystal clear skies and water for miles 
Would you kiss me? 
Would you fall for me? 
Cause Iâve been waiting for a whileâ¦ 

When did this dream begin? 
When did the rest of it end? 
With sand between my toes, I guess youâll never know 
The moments that could have been
