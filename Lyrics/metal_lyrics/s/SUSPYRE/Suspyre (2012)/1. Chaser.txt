We are still in the moment of doubt 
The sweet taste will devour you whole 
Thereâs nothing quite like this confusion 
Always craving the loss of control 

There is so much of nothing to say 
And easy to think someoneâs listening 
Sometimes wishing we never wake up 
Knowing the thirst is never changing 

The devilâs drug is the one we take 
Followed by the chaser 
Weâre all consumed by the black label 
To turn the shape-shifter 

Pick the poison that drinks you inâ¦ 

We must stop seeing what isnât there 
A vision cast between the middle 
A world thatâs hidden behind the mask 
Wearing another endless struggle 

The devilâs drug is the one we take 
Followed by the chaser 
Weâre all consumed by the black label 
To turn the shape-shifter
