In the darkest hours coming ashore 
Why do the winds battle with the storm? 
Lay your head down low 
Let the memories go 
Thereâs a stranger sleeping in your bed 
If only you could put it to rest 
Keep your words alive 
Leave a subtle reply 

Even though the skies return to blue 
Nothing could ever keep me from youâ¦ 

Someoneâs always climbing 
Inside my frame of mind 
Youâre the only answer 
Holding the tie that binds 

Itâs like swimming in a sea of black 
And looking for the only way back 
Listening for your voice 
You would come through the noise 
If tomorrow never comes again 
We can bury ourselves deep within 
And our minds are one 
Iâm the divided son 

Someoneâs always climbing 
Inside my frame of mind 
Youâre the only answer 
Holding the tie that binds 

On the long trail of exceptions 
Youâre the answers and the questions 
And in this world revolving time 
Youâre the one keeping me alive 

Even though the skies return to blue 
Nothing could ever keep me from youâ¦ 

Someoneâs always climbing 
Inside my frame of mind 
Youâre the only answer 
Holding the tie that binds
