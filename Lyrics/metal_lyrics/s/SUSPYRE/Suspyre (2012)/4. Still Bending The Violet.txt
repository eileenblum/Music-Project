The frail glass of winter 
Melting in the folds 
Cold never made me check the double rose 
A change in the season 
Calling to the rains 
Her taste gave way on the bitter champagne 

The roses always fall on white 
And love never takes regret 
Memories and painted dreams 
Find the way to remake the day 
But through strands of brunette 
Iâm still bending the violet 

Iâve seen her in my dreams 
Just canât let it be 
Weâre woven in something and still between 
I canât shake this feeling 
I still need to know 
Is it my destiny to let her go 

How am I supposed to be this strong 
I am only a singer 
To forget the spirit of it all 
I will love you forever 

The roses always fall on white 
And love never takes regret 
Memories and painted dreams 
Find the way to remake the day 
But through strands of brunette 
Iâm still bending the violet
