We were so close to symmetry 
A progressive serenity 
The ring that lies, inside your eyes 
Such is the king of the deceit 
These multiples of painted glass 
And the offering made to last 
Standing corners, and nothing pure 
The present becoming the past 

Time is the circle that draws us all 
But that time ends nowâ¦ 

As the light dawns on us all 
The ones we know are watchful 
They'll keep the system fixed on 
Explaining the shades of the cycle 

Now the memory of autumn leaves 
Gathering the December trees 
A bitter wind, thatâs always been 
Recovering the vivid dreams 
The binding of limitations 
Are breaking through our sensations 
I will provide, the words inside 
And shake our world of the burdens 

As the light dawns on us all 
The ones we know are watchful 
They'll keep the system fixed on 
Explaining the shades of the cycle 

We are many, we are one 
And the cycle is something more 
This is the only circle 
To draw different than beforeâ¦ 

Time is the circle that draws us all 
But that time ends nowâ¦ 

As the light dawns on us all 
The ones we know are watchful 
They'll keep the system fixed on 
Explaining the shades of the cycle
