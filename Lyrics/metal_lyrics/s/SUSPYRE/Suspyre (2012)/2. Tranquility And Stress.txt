Waking the radio with noise 
Stopping for a minute as we hear another tune 
See myself stretching through the day 
Finding that lies are sometimes written in the truth 

And all of them are free 
To argue and agree 
request and then decree 
And thatâs a guarantee 

Itâs dangerous to think 
Allâs lost in just a blink 
Weâll drown it in the drink 
Washed down a bathroom sink 

An impossible dream 
The yelling and the screams 
The fall of self esteem 
A whore to the machine 

So donât forget my name 
Or claim it all for fame 
And that itâs all in vain 
Thatâs never been the game 

Whatever the sound magazine says 
Makes its way into the wash 
Viewpoints folded over and over 
When the ghosts of writing are lost 

Listening must then become a choice 
Reading words that binge and purge will never bring you fame 
Put the record on and let it play 
Have it run on backwards and youâll understand the same 

How do you justify 
Admit and then deny 
Withhold and now provide 
An easier reply 

Iâm thinking of the way 
To hurry and delay 
Protect and then betray 
Much to your dismay 

Iâve slept away the years 
Been taken by the sphere 
Had way too many fears 
Get lost in all the cheers 

Before you make a mess 
Of tranquility and stress 
Deny and then confess 
Confirming your success 

Whatever the sound magazine says 
Makes its way into the wash 
Viewpoints folded over and over 
When the ghosts of writing are lost
