For creatures free from laws take heed 
Assume what sex and shape they please 
The one to split the broken nail 
A girl more deadly than the male 
The serpent roaming in the night 
Full of evil and no contrite 
A sweet disorder in the dress 
The deadly scene I must possess 

The shadows knew their way 
But now they start to fadeâ¦ 

Given the strength to carry on 
Set to take the remedy further 
My voice is the power inside 
Burning moves of the fire dancer 

What is gathered and what is lost 
For nothing gained and at what cost 
Reproach will never mend the young 
Suppressing words upon my tongue 
Now you must die I have the claims 
Set to burn you down in the flames 
The mind you sent into a trance 
Will never miss the fire dance 

Given the strength to carry on 
Set to take the remedy further 
My voice is the power inside 
Burning moves of the fire dancer 

The stars were gathered and set to view 
But never should have been given to you 
The wait for something else to bleed 
Gave way to someone finallyâ¦ 

Given the strength to carry on 
Set to take the remedy further 
My voice is the power inside 
Burning moves of the fire dancer
