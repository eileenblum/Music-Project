I see the shape of whatever was made 
And reason shows us of what we became 
These are the memories one must recall 
When building stones into the strongest wall 
The lesser man will make his way apart 
While the greater one is the work of art 
We all admire the laughter and fame 
The definite gravity of the name 

There are reflections of him 
While they fight for the throne 
Theyâll never have the presence 
For the man made of stone 

The steady hand that became the teacher 
A student leaning in on the keeper 
We have seen the master bending our thoughts 
But nothing close to the feelings he taught 
They will swell their prospects and show their pride 
But the ones not like him are those denied 
The war that our world presents to us all 
Gave the man of stone, all things great and small 

There are reflections of him 
While they fight for the throne 
Theyâll never have the presence 
For the man made of stone 

All the new world decisions 
Still the choices never change 
In keeping everyone safe 
The thoughts must be rearranged 

If we seek so shall we find 
Strength that molds one man from two 
Lessons given, lessons learned 
Everything is owed to you 

There are reflections of him 
While they fight for the throne 
Theyâll never have the presence 
For the man made of stone
