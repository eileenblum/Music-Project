The masquerade of fantasy brings a new dream
In visions this world is breaking in
I feel myself floating beyond the realms of humanity
I find the secrecy unlocking life and sin

Rise out from the darkness of the everworld
Take your rightful place among the stars

Melodic tones of aftermath strike in speechless breath
Horrific angels scream the chorals of the concert divine

Scarred in submission of lives terrified from the past
And when we're glorified in death we'll leave it all behind

Enchanted with the magical silences around our souls
We pass through a new dimension of hope and grace
To defy all ever known in the glorification of death
And now you'll bow down in the presence of my godly face

Rise out from the darkness of the everworld
Take your rightful place among the stars
To become immortal, striving for heaven
Glory beyond the gates of man

Seek for the path of righteous
Stray from the hurt and pain
Follow my darkened soul
In search for blood of reign

[Guitar solos:  Rich/Gregg]

Rise out from the darkness of the everworld
Take your rightful place among the stars
To become immortal, striving for heaven
Glory beyond the gates of man
