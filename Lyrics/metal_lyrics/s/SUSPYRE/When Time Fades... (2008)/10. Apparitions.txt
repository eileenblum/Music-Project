When was he the suffering body that stole your breath away?
Approaching an eternity, the faith that's haunting me
The scorn of this delicate child runs thorns around your head
Sitting quietly I expect, anxious to what comes next

Secrets will be essential to our development
The view provided by the wounds, tempting the review
Are my eyes allowed to contain the ghost of appearance
Searing the visual of sight, still heavy on the night

The arrangements of shadows we see
Are symptoms of a differential shade
Secrets are essential to our past
for the apparitions that stay afraid

Creating a sense out of the nothingness
Burned by the haunting shelter of the wound
Music flows through the forgotten imagery
With moonlight, cold against a misty tomb

The arrangements of shadows we see
Are symptoms of a differential shade
Secrets are essential to our past
for the apparitions that stay afraid

Guitar Solos:  Gregg/Rich

A child appears before the balance of death
An innocence that easily takes me
Blackness of the veins is suddenly spoken
By the stench of hell that comes from your screams

The arrangements of shadows we see
Are symptoms of a differential shade
Secrets are essential to our past
for the apparitions that stay afraid
