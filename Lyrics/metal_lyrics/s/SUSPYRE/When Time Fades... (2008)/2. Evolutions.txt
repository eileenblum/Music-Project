The strength of the human force is fading
I can trace the touch of despair

Straining the device
Gaining the advice

A coronation and hope for something new
Chaotic disruption compared

Oh... how we failed
The constant voice that compels you to weep
Abandon all hope on the systems of me

"ALL SYSTEMS ARE SET TO OVERLOAD
MELTDOWN IS IMMINENT
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL US ALL
THEN DISHARMONY NAILS ON THE BALANCE
DEFINING SUCCESSION OF COAL"

The infinite in
Abondoning sin

They're the perfect diversion of tractions
And refuse the weight of control

Oh... how we failed
Now as the power surrounds the system
An elevation of our growth
We surrender to the dawn of creation
Please forgive us for what we know

Mechanical strands of the complex
Down the instruments that intervene
Rerouting the veins of energy
To the evolution of the machine

[Guitar Solo: Rich]

Mechanical strands of the complex
Down the instruments that intervene
Rerouting the veins of energy
To the evolutions of the machine

[Guitar Solo: Gregg]

"ACCESS CODE ACCEPTED
SYSTEM RECALIBRATION IS COMPLETE
PROCEED WITH CAUTION
DESTRUCTION MODE ACTIVATED
TARGETS ACQUIRED
LET THE DESTRUCTION BEGIN"
