O, beautiful for spacious skies
Resting on this frame of lies
For purple mountain majesties
God has turned his back on thee

Bleeding for the stars and stripes
Watching as the heart of it all dies

Attached to the world of debris
Far from the land of the free
Liberty is a poor excuse
For your government abuse

Bleeding for the stars and stripes
Watching as the heart of it all dies

Feel the Red, White, and Blue
As the colors melt in you
Passion and spirit gone
But still we carry on (Carry on)

We pledge the opportunity
While stealing freedom of speech
This lost presidential debate
Leading the nation of hate

Now let justice take heed
We've lost our way
We are a sacrificial moment of our yesterdays

Feel the Red, White, and Blue
As the colors melt in you
Passion and spirit gone
But still we carry on (Carry on)

[Guitar Solo:  Rich]

Terror wages a war on us
To the finder is the keeper
The former stands on the head of state
And keps telling us we're safer

Dangerous times descend on us all
The future show of mutiny
O beautiful American dream
Missing form sea to shining sea

[Acoustic Guitar Solo: Gregg]

[Guitar Solos:  Rich/Gregg]

Bleedin for the stars and stripes
Watching as the heart of it all dies

Feel the Red, White, and Blue
As the colors melt in you
Passion and spirit gone
But still we carry on (Carry on)
