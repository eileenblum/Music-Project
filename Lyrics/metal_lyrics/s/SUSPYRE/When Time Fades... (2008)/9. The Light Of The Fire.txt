Isolated by the clouds under the sky
The guardians are strengthening us
The sacrificial and sentimental days
Pray their whispers settle in the dust

Excuses are traveling consequences
Down the path of the guardian's fate

Rising above the expressions they abuse
We are powerless to those we save
We're offering ourselves into conclusions
Let the bodies of water collapse

Only caged by the sympathy between lives
Now we are broken beyond the straps

We try to hold on to the light of the fire
The sensations of the blessed
The imagination of life is the heartbeat
Where the angels never rest

The connections are going to break your stride
Now that the longer years have broken down

Stripped away from the feeling of self regret
An emotional strain is ever bound

I'm always fulfilled by the art of thunder
Only dejected by the constant rain
The sensations were never spoken to
A soul that painted the midnight remains

We try to hold on to the light of the fire
The sensations of the blessed

Remember this frame inside your mind
Because the world is shaking
And the colors keep changing
(You're the reason)
You're the reason I lose control
And this life is shivering
From another beginning

The search is limitless wherever you go
Laid before us in a meaningless test

We try to hold on to the light of the fire
The sensations of the blessed
The imagination of life is the heartbeat
Where the angels never rest

One more beginning is just another end
Since we know the wicked never rest
