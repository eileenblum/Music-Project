Gloria, oh Gloria
God bless your youthful dreams
Gloria, oh Gloria
Still it rains on me

I miss a breath each time I hear her voice
A mesmerizing aira
That circles through the sounds of love
So gentle is the song of the Siren
Releasing all that's ever been
Into the dreams of bleeding suns

Enchanting... as she sings
Beautiful... melodies
Surrender

The magic rests in your dark harmony
The still of pressure surrounding
The northern corner of singing
Led straight into your cold innuendo
Now fallen from the shining star
A lover with a broken heart
Surrender

Gloria makes the rains die down
On stormy autumn nights
She always finds her way back home
So why... oh why... can't I?

Somewhere between the ground and ocean waters
Is the summer chill of someone's daughter
Shaking from her satin touch of loneliness
Swimming in the red wine taste of her lips

Strands of centuries still succumb to me
Giving into a voice marked for divine
Forever your love will be mine
Fragments of compositions around me
You can feel the music inside your soul
And I pray I can let it go
Blushing on the changing drifts of the song
Your love dances on the cascading waves
You know nothing of what you crave
I'm shifting the verge of attraction
At least you understand it's obsession
I'm forever your possession

Patience is a chilling factor of pearl
The disturbing rendering white
Of Siren beckoning the night
And even now in the wake of the rains
With three thousand miles on my mind
She always finds a way inside

The dead sounds... of wishes
Reaching through... her kisses
Surrender

Gloria makes the rains die down
On stormy autumn nights
She always finds her way back home
So why... oh why... can't I?

Gloria makes the rains die down
On stormy autumn nights
She always finds her way back home
So why... oh why... can't I?

Patience is a chilling factor of pearl
The disturbing rendering white, of Siren beckoning the night
And even in the wake of the rains
With three thousand miles on my mind, she always finds a way inside

The dead sounds... of wishes
Reaching through... her kisses
Surrender
