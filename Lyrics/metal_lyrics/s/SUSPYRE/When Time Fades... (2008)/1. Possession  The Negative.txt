The endowment of savoring moments
A certain safety found among the pale lines
Now I stand here watching them steal the stage
When we suppress the demons lying inside

Lost somewhere between the seconds of sleep
Serving another master of...

Clutching on false impressions and makings of disdain
That seems to fall on resolving my remains

Possession...
Deep within my soul... and never letting go

Return to spread the hollow shell of will
I am approaching the minutes of purity
Burn the predictions of when to decline
Pulling choices that are killing me

Lost somewhere between the seconds of sleep
Serving another master of...

Possession...
Deep within my soul... and never letting go
Possession...
Depression for pain... the nightmare still remains

Possession...
The cure left in vain... overjoyed by my pain
Possession...
Decay often brings... the nightmare of me
