I've begun the journey of time
With the strong heart of a child
I give myself as sacrifice
To the ones that I've let down

Drown your sorrows as you fall asleep
It's the only way to satisfy me

My wishes are never forgiven
I've lost the feeling of prayers
I know my choices are haunting me
In the ashes of my failures

Was my destiny made to fail
The only one that matters?
I'm still waiting to balance
In a world with no measures

My wishes are never forgiven
I've lost the feeling of prayers
I know my choices are haunting me
In the ashes of my failures

If I sing softly will it melt your heart
Will it change your image of God
These story lines were the real fantasies
Read slower than it ever was

I taste my sorrow, I never sleep
You're satisfaction that will never be

My wishes are never forgiven
I've lost the feeling of prayers
I know my choices are haunting me
In the ashes of my failures
