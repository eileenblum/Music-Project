Coming through the ashes of another man
I tend to stumble over truth
I never dreamed that I would find my angel
Standing in my point of view

With nothing left to lose
You'll miss heaven the most

Tell me I'm missing the best thing in my life
Whisper in my ear
To let the stars fall in my hands
Then fall into you

Just the simple mysteries of sleep
As I wake myself to the sounds of your name
Find the traveler's desire in me
That leaves me longing for the same place

Tell me I'm missing the best thing in my life
Whisper in my ear
To let the stars fall in my hands
Then fall into you

Watch the melodies that pass us by
Hanging gently to the fragrance in the wind
The more I wait to welcome the stars into my hands
Should let the beauty of this loneliness come in

Tell me I'm missing the best thing in my life
Whisper in my ear
To let the stars fall in my hands
Then fall into you
