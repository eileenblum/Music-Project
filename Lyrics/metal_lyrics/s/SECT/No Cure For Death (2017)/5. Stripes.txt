Captive investments under the gun. Livestock under the warden's thumb.
Watched over by machines of no love or grace, keeping out the peace. Five
hundred years and counting. Swapped out your chains for bars. Emancipation
was bad for business. Return the order, recoup the losses. Slavery it
never ended. New World, it never began. Rerouted back to the cage. Blood
money changes hands every step of the way. Locked into dead end cycles.
Profiled and fingerprinted. Rerouted back to the cage. The original theme
- captivity for profit. Master and slave / owner and object. Plantations
for assembly lines, dressed up and modernized. Can you see the stars
through the iron bars tonight?
