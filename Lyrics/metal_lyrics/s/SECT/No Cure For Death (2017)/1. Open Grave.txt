They came and went, the warning signs. The canary was dust, but the mine
was running on double time. Pulled down the alarms, tore out the break
lines. Gag reflex override. Eyes sewn shut / mouths open wide. Relax the
throat and let it slide, cold comforts of patriotic lies. Genuflect for
power. They're lining up to cower. For a seat at the master's feet,
they'll swallow yesterday's unthinkable. So was it good? Was it even any
good while it lasted? One plague less is not the end of it all, another
house of cards born to fall. And what passes for eulogy when they chose to
let the lifeline bleed until the last light blinked out and the well ran
dry?
