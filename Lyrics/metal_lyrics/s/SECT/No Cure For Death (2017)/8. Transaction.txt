Hollowed out. Followed Out. Contain the stray. Paradigm undermines.
Reining in the ones that got away. Blood green bait and switch, and
they're buying it. Bolt gun to the same head. Same blood on the factory
floor. Death and ethics under one roof. Old money protecting the hoard.
The new choice, it's a sick trap. Change thwarted, the order survives.
Reinserted back in your path. Shape-shifter, got your number. You've been
followed here by everything you thought you'd left behind. Your choice,
hand it over and we've got no problem here. Pulling old strings with new
product lines. Ingredients or realities? Ideals or vanity? True refusal or
a cheap guilt release? We still got a fucking problem here.
