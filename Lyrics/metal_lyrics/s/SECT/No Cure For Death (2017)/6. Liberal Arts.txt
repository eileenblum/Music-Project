Divisive game, no end in sight. Talk in circles day and night. Semantic
antics, why pretend? My enemy's enemy isn't my friend. When you're wrong
you're still right. There's no time left for self-defeat. Because
someone's laughing, and something's growing while we stand here splitting
hairs. Privilege masked by noble causes. Accountability, what's your
process? You won the contest, collect your prize â the rest of us cleaning
up the mess you left behind (what's one more time?) â because you won't be
around to hold you to account. The Liberal Arts, they got your mind all
messed up. You think I'm asking permission to fights we never stopped
fighting. You're conquered. Divided. Delusional.
