Dragged down into an escapist mirage. Hostage to hallucinations. Dead
lights play on my compulsions. We used to live in the light. Now we're
swallowed up by shadows. And truth is nothing but a corpse for the
vultures. Is this all you're worth â dopamine through a dead nerve?
Collapsed like a spent vein, a payload of diminished returns. Worldview on
a wire. Data sick and sleep deprived. Taunted with truths just out of
reach. Haunted by proof kept under lock and key. The flesh is a memory
blinking out, suspect and subjective. Our currency is calamity. We keep
you sick, confused and dependent. Never be well no more. You'll never be
well no more. Waking dream, arrested sanity, eyes glazed over, no hand at
the wheel. Welcome to the new Forever.
