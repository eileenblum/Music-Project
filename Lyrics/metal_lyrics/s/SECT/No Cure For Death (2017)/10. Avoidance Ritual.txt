I'll be your Judas, lined up on the wall. I'll be the wing man taking the
fall. I'll be your realist, pummeled to dust. I'll be your Judas thrown
under the bus. The hated one to break the news that there's only two rooms
in your Father's house, both filled like a fountain with expired wishful
thoughts. It's not your hell or heaven to cast me to, to promise or
threaten. For mine is the void, the Kingdom of Nothing. As above, so
below. Both sides of the curtain. All malice and power and scraps for the
faithful. You can swallow crosses to the hilt, swallow narratives greased
up with guilt â but you can't pray your way clear of the gnawing doubt. So
I'll be your Judas, wrecking the shot. Excised from the final cut. Written
out of Glory. The cynic at the gates that any god worth their salt could
appreciate. I'll be your Judas. You're going to need some realist.
