They put the wires, put the wires to my head â and all the needles they
jumped. "It won't shut off, it won't shut off, around the clock" they
said, "How do you live like this?" We've got something just for that. Fix
you up in no time flat. Patience, patient, take your rest. Just one catch,
some strings attached, but we can sort it out. Rest of your days, a
Lithium haze, so don't you spit it out. We've got one to wake you up. One
to put you down. One for the side effects, and one to bring you around
from the darkened room, the narcotic cocoon we built just for you. Taking
to the medicine.
