And the worm it turned, for the ones that wore it best. Became the chorus
with convincing faces I couldn't pull off now or then. And now you say
"you think you're better than me?" No, I don't think of you at all. I
think back on the sureness of youth when you think you can speak for all
your tomorrows. But the brave words, they were right about all the traps,
all the lies. The trip wires in the years ahead that we were sure to
survive. And then you put away these childish things. Now all the old
cliches hold true â so where are you? Jumped from the highest horse when
the praise died down and the crown dispersed. They gave you rope, you made
a noose called Time.
