Wiped. Gutted. A city deleted. They handed the keys to the density creeps,
now it's all on the menu and they're wiping it clean. Every inch
commandeered. No vacancy for the unsightly here. Overwritten. Sterilized.
Smeared out before your eyes. All-consuming wrecking ball of affluence
demands this house. Your history is a teardown. Someone's project. Broken
ground.
