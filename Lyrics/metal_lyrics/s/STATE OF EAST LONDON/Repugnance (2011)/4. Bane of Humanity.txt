Your screams of pain will be ignored 
By all those, those who used to care about you
You are but carrion, a plague 
A pile of shit
Face eradication they canât hear you now
Suffer alone in isolation. 

Nothing but failure
Nothing but wasted potential

YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!

Now youâre laying in a pool, of your own blood. 
Your heart is racing, bodies freezing
This is the end
The end of you
This is the end of you

As I break through your rib cage, your eyes look at me for mercy.
You are nothing but shit, youâre weakness aids you.

Your disfigured corpse lay ruined; youâre at one with the vermin
As they eat through your putrid body, youâre just a fucking piece of shit.

Your screams of pain will be ignored
By all those, those who used to care about you

As I bite and chew through your skin, now turned to grey.

You are finally out of my way, youâre finally dead!
