I see a digression within the human race
And a con-questing shadow that is enveloping innocence 
I have felt the depths of the fire lying within the seed of deceit

So come one come all and hear my plea for reason
Come and destroy the darkness they try to drown us in 

Within the dark they feed on our weakness
We can create the light
They yearn to extinguish [x2]
With their towers of falsification and power 

I see a digression within the human race
And a con-questing shadow that is enveloping innocence 
I have felt the depths of the fire lying within the seed of deceit

I am the master of keys
I open the doors to illumination
Only forget all you know for it is a LIE!

Suffer unto me your pestilence

I will break this cross with the truth
And reveal a whole new existence
One where desire is not evil but apart of the evolution

Finally we are saved
Saved from doom

I am the master of keys
I open the doors to illumination
Only forget all you know for it is a LIE!

When the bombs fall on the cities
Know you lived your life with no boundaries
Youâre a powerful being with the gift of creation
Donât let the misconception of anointment shatter your chance to be free

I hope your seed will bring us back from the brink of destruction
