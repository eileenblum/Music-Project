Youâre a plague of the most unholy kind
I will not witness the fall of man within the foul doctrine of god

Your non-existent saviour, he will not save you now
The mess you left before us, will not be seen as fit

He will not save you now.

A land where this is excepted will be conquered by fear.

These people spill there knowledge yet swarm with ignorance
Like lambs led to the slaughter, the swallow all thatâs said

Your gospel has been laid to waste

This is the time

This is the time, we will destroy them.
This is the time, the time to rise
