I look upon a world left forsaken
When I see what the filth of this race has awakened
A demon most vile in nature
I look upon a world left forsaken
When I see what the filth of this race has awakened
A demon most vile in nature

The beauty of this concord ripped from the face of this earth
Defilement of truth has created moral interception
Leaving bleeding hearts in the wake of the tidal wave of destruction

Giving rise to new power who seize all not theirs and write what is good for you

Seen as the diseased, were tossed to the pigs, 

Isnât it enough to know this world is glorious, without giving it strings?
Strings to pull on!

I look upon a world left forsaken
When I see what the filth of this race has awakened
A demon most vile in nature

Such a callous act to make the dead, beg for forgiveness
Within the hands of time, I see the future unfold
Is this the end?

I see what this race has awakened
I am not scared to fight to the end

Search yourself, find your master has left you, for he is extinct

Judging by your weary looks you must have seen the news today

Look within my open chest and witness what happens to the dead
When the war of the angels is seen as disgraced 
Suicide is just another way to end their tormented lives
If it is their will, let it be their way
We are just the randomness of a cursed world and out of control we continue
To breathe on our own

Isnât it enough to know this world is glorious, without giving it strings?
Strings to pull on!
