Something grabs my throat I choke and I 
Think I felt the silence of your cold 
Bright light, youâre blanketed by death
Transforming you into stone

Though this world will never see you again
What you brought to this life is only the beginning
Your strength showed us all that
There is still hope for the living

But with these memories, you will linger on
And bright light will give us hope

And with you in mind we begin our climb to the start of a losing race

And know if this world falls
We all go with it

But now its time to take a step back 
And witness this world that we have created

So listen to the voice that is in your head
Telling you that this is not the end
This is where your strength begins

Something grabs my throat I choke and I 
Think I felt the silence of your cold 
Bright light, youâre blanketed by death
Transforming you into stone

But with these memories, you will linger on
And bright light will give us hope
