WHERE ARE YOU?
Where are you now?
Now that the sky has fallen.
Where are you now?
You said youâd come down to earth

This lie is abandonment of the senses
And I would hate to see the world spin off its axis
And fall into obliteration
False prescriptions of these antidotes
Page bound disgraces will lead us to warfare
This lie is abandonment of the senses
And I would hate to see the world spin off its axis
And fall into obliteration

Its time to rewrite history with in the eyes of a generation
And lift the veil that keeps us blinded
Believe the evolution, cast down creation
Believe the evolution, cast down creation

So bear your cross, it will only send you down

Someone must help the world see past this profanation
If we are human at all then we will see the,
The uselessness of the false idol

Clutch your chest for this is the end
Clutch your chest for this
Is the end.
