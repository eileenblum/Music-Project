Your beauty
Your beauty

In contradiction to your bitterness
In contradiction to your bitterness
In contradiction
In contradiction to your bitterness
I remember the place where I lost you
Remember bodies standing roadside
Waving at me
Waving at me

Your beauty, your face
Your angelic voice
It can't be hallucinated
Your beauty, your face
Your angelic voice

Embraced by the shadows of your
Never ending master
Of your
Never ending master
With a smile on your face
On your face
Take me home
With a smile on your face
You had your chance
With a smile on your
Face
You had your chance
With a fucking smile on your fucking face!
