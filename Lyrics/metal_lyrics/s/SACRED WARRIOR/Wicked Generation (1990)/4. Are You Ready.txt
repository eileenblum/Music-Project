You`ve been sent an invitation, the writing`s on the wall
You know it`s gonna be a party, the biggest of them all

We`re here to rock for you and make the message known
And if you`ve got the guts, we`ll show you the way home

Are you ready ? You've been summoned to this moment
A heavenly decree, it`s not by chance or fate that

You are here to see, you`re looking for an answer
To your life`s regrets, the answer`s clear to see

Are you ready to be set free ?
He died for you and me, take his hand and you will see
That your past and all your cares will fade away

You thought there`d be no happy endings but now you know the truth
There`s nothing left but pride to stop you

The love of god's come through, tonight`s the night for your salvation
You know what you must do, just give your life to christ
And see his power to renew - Are you ready ?
