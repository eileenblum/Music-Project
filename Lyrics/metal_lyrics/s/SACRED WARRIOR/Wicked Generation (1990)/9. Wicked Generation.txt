Signs that mark the times are clear to see
Just look around at a world of misery
If you can`t read the writing`s on the wall
Delusions, victory, rejections last call
There`ll be no more excuses, decisions on the line
The cross you wear as a fashion statement is just a waste of time
Your reoccuring sins will lead you to your death
Will you ask for forgiveness with your very last breath

Wicked generation and it keeps on escalating, it`s another
Wicked generation, oh wicked generation

A simple prayer on sunday is such a shallow repent
You keep avoiding his love, your nights are better off spent
But deep inside your light still shines
Reminding you each day that Jesus christ was crucified
For our sins, the price he paid

Your reoccuring sins will lead you to your death
Will you ask for forgiveness with your very last breath

Wicked generation and it keeps on escalating, it`s another
Wicked generation, oh wicked generation
