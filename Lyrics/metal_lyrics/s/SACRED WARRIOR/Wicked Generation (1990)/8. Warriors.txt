All around the place tonight, if god would let you see
Legions of angelic hosts they fight for you and me
The battle it is spiritual not of flesh and blood
Not mercenaries out for kicks, they do it out of love

They`re warriors, fighting in the night
Warriors, they stand up for what`s right
Cutting through the darkness and fighting for the light
The victory belongs to god, the battle they must fight, warriors

We too are warriors, but of a different kind
Separated by our sins
Once walking on the line, listening to our calling, sent from high above
Now we stand in victory but not by what we`ve done
Now lifting up our brothers on the battle lines
On our knees victorious, we`re fighting side by side

They`re warriors, fighting in the night
Warriors, they stand up for what`s right
Cutting through the darkness and fighting for the light
The victory belongs to god, the battle they must fight, warriors

The bible says where two or more are gathered in his name
He will be there with them, his power to sustain
So will you join the battle and fight with us today
Casting off your apathy and stand your ground again

They`re warriors, fighting in the night
Warriors, they stand up for what`s right
Cutting through the darkness and fighting for the light
The victory belongs to god, the battle they must fight, warriors
