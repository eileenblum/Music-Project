Till the end has come and I`m still living in these trenches
The battle still rages in my mind, so many will be left behind
To face a world of darkness where they`ll be
No peace of mind, I can see their faces
Visions of the damned, their pleading hearts are crying out
Without a second chance 
Will you be killed by satan`s lies
Thinking that you`re smarter ? 
For hell no one dies a martyr

Still on and on and we`re pressing even harder
We`ll never stop until the end has come
To spread the word of righteousness that penetrates the darkness
And sets free the hearts of all men
We can only try so hard to keep you from the burn
Time for you to make a choise which god will you prefer ?
Will you be killed by satan`s lies
Thinking that you`re smarter ?
For hell no one dies a martyr

War torn heroes / War torn heroes / War torn heroes

Some say that we`re heroes but that`s a shallow fame
And with the glory comes the shame cause if you`re not there with me
There`ll be no one else to blame, so when I give account
Tell me, will I, will I use your name ?

War torn heroes / War torn heroes / War torn heroes
