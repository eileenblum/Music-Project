Miss Linda, you`re the lady with the all-seeing eyes
You`re the one with all the answers to my pain and my cries
All alone, torn emotions, I need someone
Won`t you help me please ?
Look in your crystal ball, tell me is there any hope for me ?
See, I`ve been a bad girl, so many things I`ve done that should not be
Stemmed from the problems of my childhood memories
And the secrets that I had to keep
They say that you're the lady with the all-seeing eyes
Do you really have the answer to my pain and my cries

Miss Linda, you`re the lady with the all-seeing eyes
I call your name in a smoke filled bar
They prayed that night and there they gave their lives to christ
Why trust a myth to safe your life ?
I`ll take the strength I have inside and my psychic guide to set me free

They say that you're the lady with the all-seeing eyes
The one with all the answers to my pain and my cries

Miss Linda, you`re the lady with the all-seeing eyes
Give hope to my life

As she slipped into her trance, the first words that I understood :
"You`re daddy`s little girl, what a perfect childhood"
Your vague cliches will never work for me
How could I think that you could set me free ?
You made me think that you were wise 
And now I find that it`s all a pack of lies
I think I`ll turn to christianity, it somehow doesn`t seem so bad to me
An hour a week is not a lot to ask to keep me for eternity

They say that you're the lady with the all-seeing eyes
But you didn`t have the answer to my pain and my cries
Miss Linda, you`re a lady who`s as lonely as ... I call his name
