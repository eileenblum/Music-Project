A lay awake at night afraid to fall asleep
There`s something in my mind that comes back to haunt me
Tearstains on my face
I`ve cried for you, my tension slowly building

There`s nothing to say, I know I cannot change what I`ve done
There`s no happy endings in this life of madness
There`s got to be something better for me

Tormented by my action, you walked out on me
Grabbed the kids, headed toward the door and said
You wouldn`t take anymore of my abuse ... say I`m going insane
One more time I`m to blame

There`s nothing to say, I know I cannot change what I`ve done
There`s no happy endings in this life of madness
There`s got to be something better for me

There`s no use pretending, this life`s tearing me apart
I`ve lost everything I had with you

There`s nothing to say, I know I cannot change what I`ve done
There`s no happy endings in this life of madness
There`s got to be something better for me

Statistics, numbers, numbers, can`t take anymore
Someone tell me what`s it gonna take for her to reopen that door
Tearstains on my face, I`ve cried for you
My tension building slowly

There`s nothing to say, I know I cannot change what I`ve done
There`s no happy endings in this life of madness
There`s got to be something better for me

There`s no use pretending, this life`s tearing me apart
I`ve lost everything I had with you
