If you feel lonely you can count on me
No, you`re not the only one who feels this way
It`s been a long time since we`ve had anything to say
Tell me now, will it always be this way ?
You`ve got me thinkin` someday, we can be the same, no no

All the things that you do in the night, they make you feel alright
But someone`s watching you, you`re only fooling yourself
Take your book back off the shelf, don`t let it rest

I remeber the good times, feels like yesterday
But following your desire you`ve thrown it all away
Just take a little time, look around, what do you see ?
There`s no one else, who loves you like me
You`ve got me thinkin` someday, we can be the same, no no
All the things that you do in the night, they make you feel alright
But someone`s watching you, you`re only fooling yourself
Take your book back off the shelf, don`t let it rest

In the morning when you pass me by, I sit alone
You turn to look at me but in your shame you turn away
It`s not too late, don`t you hesitate
The things of your past can all be wiped out
Take a little time, look around, what do you see ?
There`s no one else, who loves you like me
I`ll tell you something, lady, it can be the same, no no

All the things that you do in the night, they make you feel alright
But someone`s watching you, you`re only fooling yourself
Take your book back off the shelf, don`t let it rest
