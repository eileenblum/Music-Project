Thank you for your concern for my christian life
Your prayers are deeply needed but let`s put an end to this strife
Yes, I`ve been seen in places that you`d only pass in daylight
But that`s our biggest difference we minister by night

We`re out on the front lines, challenging everyone
Surrounded by fruits of sin that consume your daughter or son
We go in after them, they`re in our sights
But that`s our gift in the darkness we`ll shed the light

I minister by night in a heavenly show
Taking the world to places, places that you would not go

So many other people are lost, they`re people you know

We minister by night in a heavenly show
Taking the world to places, where Jesus had led us go

Yes, I`ve been seen in places that you`d only pass in daylight
But that`s our biggest difference we minister by night
