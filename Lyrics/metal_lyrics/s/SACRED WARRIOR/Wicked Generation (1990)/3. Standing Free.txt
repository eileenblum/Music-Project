Broken windows ... in my mind
Shattered dreams ... surround me
My days were numbered
Thoughts of suicide invade my mind
I couldn`t stand it anymore
I wouldn`t face reality
I`d sit and wonder, thinking of myself
I need someone
Then came the day, you took me by the hand
Hope filled my life, now I`m back to stay

I`m standing on my feet again
Not listening to my thoughts they`ve lied to me
I`m standing on my feet again, I`m standing free

How many times will this nightmare taunt me ?
I can`t believe I almost said goodbye
Now face to face with my own destiny
Is this what I want to be a memory
Or live my life like it was meant to be

I`m standing on my feet again
Not listening to my thoughts they`ve lied to me
I`m standing on my feet again, I`m standing free

I got my back against the wall ...
Nobody can touch me ... no no
My desire to sabotage my existence 
Came to an end when I finally realized
So many things in life accomplished
To let it end in a compromise
I`ll choose to live and tell others of satan`s lies

I`m standing on my feet again
Not listening to my thoughts they`ve lied to me
I`m standing on my feet again, I`m standing free
