As we spoke this morning, the fear written upon my face
I feel like a candle standing in the pouring rain
You told me you loved me daddy and that you`d show me how much
But there`s these feelings I can`t understand when you touch
Robbed of my innocence, I`m so lost and confused
Frightened by the thought of you, coming to take me again
Disturbed with my life I`m ready to quit
I wish you could see my pain and misery

Sworn to silence, our little secrets

What has possessed you to do this to me ?
Daddy, I`m hurting can`t you see
You`re a stranger to me, your love I never felt

Sworn to silence, our little secrets

I`m so ashamed of what I see every time I look in the mirror
I can`t believe it ... oh no, believe what you`ve done to me
I`ll never be the same, I`m so tired of all your heartless games
You`ve hurt me, you`ve hurt me, you`ve hurt me

Fifteen years later my heart still bleeds
I`m longing for the day in which I`ll finally have peace
You`re a stranger to me, you`re love I never felt

Sworn to silence, our little secrets
