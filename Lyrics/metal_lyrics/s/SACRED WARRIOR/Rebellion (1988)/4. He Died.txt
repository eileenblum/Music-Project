He died for you and I on that day
As He hangs on the cross for you and I
He said "Father forgive them for they know not what they do"

It's time you realize what he has done for you
Just open up your eyes and face the truth
Why don't you realize what God has done for you
He sent His only Son to die for you

And He died for you and I Oh Jesus
And He died for you and I Oh Jesus

And when they hung Him on the cross
His face they did not recognize
And when they saw Him hanging there
Oh the pain

And when they hung Him on the cross
His face they did not recognize
And when they saw Him hanging there
Oh the pain

And He lives for you and I
Oh Jesus
