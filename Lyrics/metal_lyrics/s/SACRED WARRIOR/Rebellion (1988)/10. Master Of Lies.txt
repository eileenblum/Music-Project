Well I'm gonna tell ya a little story
About a man named lucifer
He is the master of deception
And he wants to see you burn
He's got the power in him to make the evilness to come out
And I tell you this my friend

[CHORUS:]
Master of lies
Master of lies
Lies

That evil man won't rest until he's done his evil deed for the day
He'll take away your pride then he laughs as he walks away
He's got you thinking that everything that you do is OK and right
The choice is yours my friend beware

Master of lies
Master of lies
Lies

Now just remember what I told you
About this man and what he does
The choice is yours my friend

Master of lies
Master of lies
Lies
