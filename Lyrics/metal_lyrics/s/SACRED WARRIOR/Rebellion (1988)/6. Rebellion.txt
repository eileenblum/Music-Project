Well you're goin' downtown see the city lights
You're lookin' for a high that you just can't find
Well you're falling from God and it's such a shame
You know satan is the one that you gotta blame

[CHORUS:]
But there's an answer in your heart
You know the truth now play your part
Yes there's an answer and it's waiting for you
Turn back to Jesus you know what to do
Give it up!
Your mind of rage, rebellion
Your mind of rage, rebellion

But there's an answer in your heart
You know the truth now play your part
Yes there's an answer and it's waiting for you
Turn back to Jesus you know what to do
Give it up!
Your mind of rage, rebellion
Your mind of rage, rebellion

Well you're goin' downtown see the city lights
You're lookin' for a high that you just can't find
Well you're falling from God and it's such a shame
You know satan is the one that you gotta blame

But there's an answer in your heart
You know the truth now play your part
Yes there's an answer and it's waiting for you
Turn back to Jesus you know what to do
Give it up!
Your mind of rage, rebellion
Your mind of rage, rebellion
