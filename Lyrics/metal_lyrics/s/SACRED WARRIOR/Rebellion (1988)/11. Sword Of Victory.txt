Well I seem to find that the enemy attacks
At a time when you least expect it
So you better prepare for the day will come
That your name will be elected
There'll be lots of pain and everything to gain
But dying is the only way out

[CHORUS:]
That we all will walk in victory
With a sword in our right hand

Where will you be when the going gets tough
Will you stand and fight like a man
Will you follow through when the One from above says
Here's my battle plan

I will give you the strength you need
And the courage to stand alone
If you fight for me there'll be victory
And a crown when you get home

And we all will walk in victory
With a sword in our right hand
We will stand for all the world to see
That the truth has set us free

And we all will walk in victory
With a sword in our right hand
We will stand for all the world to see
That the truth has set us free

Where will you be when the going gets tough
Will you stand and fight like a man
Will you follow through when the One from above says
Here's my battle plan

I will give you the strength you need
And the courage to stand alone
If you fight for me there'll be victory
And a crown when you get home

And we all will walk in victory
With a sword in our right hand
We will stand for all the world to see
That the truth has set us free
