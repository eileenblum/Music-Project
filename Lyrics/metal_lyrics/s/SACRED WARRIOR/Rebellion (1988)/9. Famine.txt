See the tears as they flow down their face
From the hunger that hit the human race
Can't understand why their lives must be this way
We can help them along

Without a drop of strength they force down the tears
Then again what have they done that is so wrong
We can make a difference Just help them along, along
To have to live in a place without a song
We can make a difference Just help them along, along

[CHORUS:]
We can help them along
With a little love from God
They can make it all the way

Without a drop of strength they force down the tears
Then again what have they done that is so wrong
We can make a difference Just help them along, along
To have to live in a place without a song
We can make a difference Just help them along, along

We can help them along
With a little love from God
They can make it all the way
