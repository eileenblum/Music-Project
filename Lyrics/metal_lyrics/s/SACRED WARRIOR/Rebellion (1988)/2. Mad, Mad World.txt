One nation under God but where are we going?
We try to make the best of our lives not really knowing
That our own righeousness is but filthy rags
In the eyes of the Holy One
It's a state of the heart not the flag

[CHORUS:]
It's a mad mad world we're living in
Making up our own rules
We make excuses for sin
It's a mad mad world we're living in

We tell ourselves that we're OK
It's what we do not how we play
That earns us our golden crown
That's the thing we all love to say

But our own righeousness is but filthy rags
In the eyes of the Holy One
It's a state of the heart not the flag
