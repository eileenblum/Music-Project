The evil one is the great deciever
He'll steal your soul when you turn around
Ohh he's just doing evil
Any chance he can get you down
He'll rip your flesh tear your heart right out

[CHORUS:]
Ohh he's just doing evil
Well I said
Ohh he's just doing evil

Well if you're looking for a friend
Don't ever look in his direction
If you need someone to lift you up
He's gonna tell you that you're out of luck

[CHORUS]
But there is One who can lift you up
Take you away from this life of sin
He's the One He's the God above
He wants to take you into His kingdom

Ohh stay away from evil
Well I said
Ohh stay away from evil
Ohh stay away from evil
Never turn around
Ohh stay away from evil
