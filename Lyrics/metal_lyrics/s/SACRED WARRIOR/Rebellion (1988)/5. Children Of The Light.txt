We are the ones that will take the gospel to all nations
No we will not deny our King
We do what's right and we do it with no sadness
'Cause we enjoy the life we live

[CHORUS:]
With righeousness of the Lamb
We do what is good for the benefit of others
We are children of the light
And we do what is right
We are children of the light
We'll fight the good fight

We won't take part in unfruitful deeds of darkness
We expose them to the light
We do what's right and we do it with no sadness
For our Lord Jesus Christ we'll fight

With righeousness of the Lamb
We do what is good for the benefit of others
We are children of the light
And we do what is right
We are children of the light
We'll fight the good fight
