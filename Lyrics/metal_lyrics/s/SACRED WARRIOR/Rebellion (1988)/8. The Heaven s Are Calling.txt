[INTRO]
Behold Jesus said that the road that leads to destruction is broad
And the gate to eternal life is narrow
And satan seeks to destroy this world
And many do follow him mocking and scorning the name of Jesus
But it is written Vengeance is mine thus sayeth the Lord of hosts
As the voices of the heavens are calling

Our God is calling for the time He comes is near
When He will rule throughout the land
Then the confusion in your head will soon be clear
As the voices of the heavens are calling

Ohh the heavens are calling
Ohh so give glory to the King

Everyone shall see Him open up the clouds
Even those who pierced His name
Then all the people of the earth shall mourn
Because they'll see that He is the One

Ohh the heavens are calling
Ohh so give glory to the King

Won't you join us all you people
Behold He's coming from above
Father's wrath upon His hands
All the kings shall bow and all authority shall fall
For it is said that your worldly possessions shall fade away
But in His kingdom what you'll have is here to stay
See the lights shine on the shadows of the world
Seven scrolls of wrath are poured upon this land forevermore

Our God is calling for the time He comes is near
When He will rule throughout the land
Then all the people of the earth shall mourn
Because they'll see that He is the One

Ohh the heavens are calling
Ohh so give glory to the King
