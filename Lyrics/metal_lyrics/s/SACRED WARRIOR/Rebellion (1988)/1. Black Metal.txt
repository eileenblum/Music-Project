You see your face in that magazine
You wanna be in the spotlight
Each day goes by you're living a dream
Countless hours spent in front of the mirror
You've really made it clear

[CHORUS:]
Long hair parted between the eyes
Silk pants wrapped tight around your thighs
Each day goes by you're living a dream

You try so hard, say what can I do
Or how can I make it
Why not admit it's a part of a dream
Countless hours spent in front of the mirror
You've really made it clear

[CHORUS:]
Long hair parted between the eyes
Silk pants wrapped tight around your thighs
Each day goes by you're living a dream

[BRIDGE:]
Why do you want to follow the leader
You should set the example
You gotta want to be like Jesus the messiah
He's a jealous God
He wants you to serve Him with your life
Oh He can't take it anymore, more, more

Long hair parted between the eyes
Silk pants wrapped tight around your thighs
Each day goes by you're living a dream
You see your face in that magazine
You wanna be in the spotlight
Long hair parted between the eyes
Silk pants wrapped tight around your thighs
Each day goes by you're living a dream
Don't try so hard to be like everyone else.
