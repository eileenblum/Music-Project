In the world where we live from day to day
Lives a man who sees only one way
Stalking the night for a weak, yeah, that`s his prey

On the loose he`s dressed to kill, another victim, that`s his thrill
His eyes glow of violence and abomination
He`s watching you every more always ahead of the game
He knows where he can always find you
You`re just a number to this dangerous man
You can lie there bleeding while he`s laughing

Mad man, can it be he`s after you 
Or is he more than a mad man comes for you
In a rage he`s on the loose

Step by step he crawls inside you and turns your insides out
As you allow him, he will overtake you
You have two ways to choose, but you`ve broken all the rules
And now you need someone to save you

You can put an end to his disastrous ways
Call up the lord and he will free you

Mad man, can it be he`s after you 
Or is he more than a mad man comes for you
In a rage he`s on the loose

Deep inside you can find the answer and he can wipe your tears away
Your tears away
Receive him now don`t reject him, Oh, he`s god, oh don`t you dare ?

From there isn`t a holiday
You might not ever understand his frustration
Of watching you throwing your life away

Now you know you can be free, truly free
`Cause he is calling out to your name
Why don`t you see that he is the healer

Mad man, can it be he`s after you 
Or is he more than a mad man comes for you
In a rage he`s on the loose
