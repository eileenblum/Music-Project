Gay rights and porno movies are rampant everywhere
The end result foretold is the disease they share
If Sodom and Gomorrah came to a fiery end
What makes you think that this place will stay in god`s right hand ?

Fire, fire falling from heaven, burning up everything
Sea to sea, nothing can stand in the way of the judgement
When it begins with godly desire
Fire, fire, righteous and holy, Wiping out all the intended disease
Will you be part of this massive destruction
Or will you be saved from this terrible siege ?

You take the little babies from their mama`s womb
A jar upon the shelf becomes a cold, darkened tomb
How long do you think god`s patience will last 
Watching?
It`s just a matter of time till his wrath will be released

Fire, fire falling from heaven, burning up everything
Sea to sea, nothing can stand in the way of the judgement
When it begins with godly desire
Fire, fire, righteous and holy, Wiping out all the intended disease
Will you be part of this massive destruction
Or will you be saved from this terrible siege ?

For sins no different than these god made some cities fall
His warnings went unheeded they wouldn`t heed the call
How long do you think god`s patience will last 
Watching?
It`s just a matter of time till his wrath will be released

Fire, fire falling from heaven, burning up everything
Sea to sea, nothing can stand in the way of the judgement
When it begins with godly desire
Fire, fire, righteous and holy, Wiping out all the intended disease
Will you be part of this massive destruction
Or will you be saved from this terrible siege ?
