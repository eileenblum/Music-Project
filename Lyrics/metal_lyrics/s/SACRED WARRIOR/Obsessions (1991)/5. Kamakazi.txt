I`m on the outside looking at the inside
The pain of this world fills my head
A rich man passes and shrugs at the poor man
And says he made his own bed

Don`t believe him, he`ll use the power to push you around
Don`t receive him, his lies betray him and show where`s he`s bound

Kamikazi you think that you know but you`re lost
You're lost in a world of your dreams
Kamikaze your life`s not your own it`s been bought

I see a girl she`s thirteen believing that love is found in the bed
But when a life starts that seems inconvenient
You say it`s better off dead

Don't believe them the love you seek isn`t faithful or true
Don't release them, the kamikaze`s won`t quit till they`re through

Kamikazi you think that you know but you`re lost
You're lost in a world of your dreams
Kamikaze your life`s not your own it`s been bought

So many people get into religion because they want to get freed
But there are those who are out to forsaken you
And bent on making you bleed

Don't believe them they`ll tell you one thing
Then turn it around, don`t receive them
They`re father satan is pulling them down

Kamikazi you think that you know but you`re lost
You're lost in a world of your dreams
Kamikaze your life`s not your own it`s been bought
