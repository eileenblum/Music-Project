Like a trip on a dead end street, my life`s coming to an end
Your love has no meaning now `cause I`ve gone astray
Lost alone in time, I now see what I have done
What I`ve attained and what I`ve left behind

There was a time when I used to smile to your name
Your face couldn`t wait to see
And every time I`d hear your voice I`d rejoice

But now I realize I`ve gone so far away

I know I need to go
Back to the start
And get that fire burning again
I know I've gotta turn back on my own
And take what you have given to me
