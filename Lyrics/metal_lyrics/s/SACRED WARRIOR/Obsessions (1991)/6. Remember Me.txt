Now while the others laugh and spit
I think about just where I sit
And where I`ll be tomorrow

Living only to explore my every chance for pleasure 
But now I realize I need your grace
I turned my head to see your face
You don`t deserve this cheap disgrace
When you leave here let me follow

Please remember me
Please remember me

You're a man who`s done no wrong
Yet everyone despires you
Yes crucify the king of the jews
For my crimes I`ll do my time
I dared to cross forbidden lines
When you leave here let me follow

Please remember me
Please remember me

I tell you the truth
Today you`ll be with me in paradise

Though I`ve been condemned to death
My sins are still forgiven
You give the promise of eternal life

I turned my head to see your face
You don`t deserve this cheap disgrace
When you leave here let me follow

Please remember me
Please remember me
