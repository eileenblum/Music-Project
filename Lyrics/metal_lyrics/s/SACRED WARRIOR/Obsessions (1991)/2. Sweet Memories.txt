I remember all the things you used to say
The times we shared together, the many tears we`ve shed
But now it seems as though i talk to barren walls
I know someday I`ll see you again but `till then

Oh sweet memories
Oh sweet memories

You always took the time to spend with me
That`s how you taught me right from wrong
I remember all you`ve done for me, you done for me
When I needed you yeah you were there

When it seems the scars of time would never heal
I know you were by my side, your love was real

Oh sweet memories
Oh sweet memories

Twelve years later seems like yesterday
When you were holding me in your arms
The memories of you will never leave, will never leave
They`re calling out of me

When it seems the scars of time would never heal
I know you were by my side, your love was real

Oh sweet memories
Oh sweet memories
