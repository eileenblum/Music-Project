I used to live like there`s no tomorrow
I used to think life was only a game
Born to find that you`ll be gone tomorrow
To be desolate liying in a grave

I couldn`t count on the way I way feeling
My heart condemned me all the time
Then your love set me free from these feelings
And now, now I can cry

This temple`s on fire
Oh he`s taking me higher
This temple`s on fire
It burns with a godly desire

War waged upon my soul 
Since I found, I found the answer
But the victory lies in the hand of my savior
Who`s leading me every step on the way

I can`t count on the way that I`m feeling
My heart condemns me all the time
I know your love sets me free
From these feelings so now I can cry

This temple`s on fire
Oh he`s taking me higher
This temple`s on fire
It burns with a godly desire

There is no power that can pvertake the blood, he shed on calvary
A sinless lamb who was led to the slaughter
Freely gave his life for me, out of love he took my place 
And now, now I can cry

This temple`s on fire
Oh he`s taking me higher
This temple`s on fire
It burns with a godly desire
