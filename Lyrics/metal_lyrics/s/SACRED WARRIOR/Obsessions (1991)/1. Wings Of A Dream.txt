As time goes by, I look around
To see which way I`m going
And if it`s really worth
The pain that I feel
Hard times may get me down
Trying to destroy my dreams
What can I say
I`m just a man !

I`ve come too far to turn around
Can`t let the hard times get me down
I`ll lift my head up off the ground

And ride on the wings of a dream
Ride them for a crown
I`m gonna receive
Yes, ride the wings of a dream
On and on, won`t look back
Let the fire keep leading the way

When daily life is more than I
Believe that I can handle
I have a good that sees through
If I give my weaknesses to him
He gives his strenght to me
Faithfulness he`ll always prove

I`m pressin on in spite of things
That seem to overwhelming me
He makes them all just disappear
Long days and longer nights
Trying hard to make it right
Soothing words are all I hear
I never want to turn around
Don`t let the hard times get me down
He lifts my head up off the ground

And ride on the wings of a dream
Ride them for a crown
I`m gonna receive
Yes, ride the wings of a dream
On and on, won`t look back
Let the fire keep leading the way
