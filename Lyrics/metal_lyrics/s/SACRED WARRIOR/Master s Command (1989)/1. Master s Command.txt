The pain you feel
Is caused by all the things I've said and done
But your love for me is so real
You forgave me
And you sent your only Son
Oh, and you say
"My people are falling away from me
People, I'm calling you to be just as I am"

How can you say to me that you love me
Yet have so much hate for your brother?
Don't you know that the law says we're murderers
If we hate one another?

[Chorus:]
Why can't we forgive one another
And learn to be just like I AM
Why don't we just love one another
And do as the Master commands?
Time's only waiting for you
To tear down the walls
Of pride that you've made
To see through the Master's eyes
And to realize
The changes we've all got to make

[Chorus]

Well don't you know that His blood
Is our forgiveness?
He's put the answer in us all
You heart is cold-your blood is black
You're full of darkness
But the Master's answer's in us all
How can you say to me that you love me
Yet have so much hate for your brother?
I've made it easy
Now the choice is up to you
Remember my judgment
Will be upon this matter

[Chorus]
