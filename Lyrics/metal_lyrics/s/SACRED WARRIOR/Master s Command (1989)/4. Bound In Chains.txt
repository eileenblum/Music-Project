As the night starts its rise and the streets start to fill
You're looking to get your next pill
Music's loud, lights are bright
Women are dressed to kill in their high heels and tights

[Chorus 1:]
Can't you see it's all so clear
You're living a lie
Wondering why, still searching inside
Days go by still you try, never understanding
That you're just one of many bound in chains

The pusher's pushing, the thief is stealing
The preacher's preaching but his life's filled with darkness
The gangster's killing, the witch she's casting spells
Astrologers' tell their lies and people buy these feelings

[Chorus 2:]
Can't they see it's all so clear
They're living a lie
Wondering why, still searching inside
Days go by still they try, never understanding
That they're just one of many bound
And they keep pushing on never realising
That they're just one of many bound in chains

If you choose to live life by these evil ways
No one else can take the blame
For the pain you're gonna feel
But the truth's within you, crying out
Now how much longer will you live in this darkness

[Chorus 3:]
Can you see it's all so clear
You're living a lie
Wondering why, still searching inside
Days go by still you try, never understanding
That you're just one of many bound
And you keep pushing on, will you ever realise
That you're just one of many bound in chains
