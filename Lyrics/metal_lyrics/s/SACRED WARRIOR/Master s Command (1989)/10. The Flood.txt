Now it came to pass
Just before the flood

The Lord saw men's wickedness
And said I'll spill their blood

Mercy follows mercy
The decision's up to you
Get right with the Christ child
Heed the warning: he's coming soon

Parallels of Hell
Destruction from above
Water into fire
God's will be done

Master
Call him master and do what he says
Serve the Lord and saviour Christ,
Faith without works is dead

Mercy follows mercy
The decision's up to you
Get right with the Christ child
The flood is coming soon

You see the flood as it's coming to this place
Nowhere to run and hide
Preachers of righteousness are warning you today
Turn from sin to escape the wrath that's coming
Receive the truth and be saved

The earth is filled with violence
And it will pay
Like nuclear destruction
Could happen any day

Why then would you choose
To refuse the offering
To the answer what is Christ child
For a flirting death with sin

Saints arise, arise, arise
