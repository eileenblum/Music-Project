I never knew what love was all about
'till I found you
I never thought that it ever would be this way
Many times I've tried to make it on my own
But I'd fall apart
Yet I knew you were the One

[Chorus:]
I know you won't ever leave me in pain
I know our love will never die
When I'm feeling lonely
You're right there by me side
You take my hand and tell me
Everything's alright

When I hear your voice
It sends a chill right through me
The feeling of your love
Unfailing and forever strong
Even though, I can't count the times
I've let you down
This I know you promise
That you'll never let me go

[Chorus]

When I hear your voice
It sends a chill right through me
The feeling of your love
Unfailing and forever strong
Even though, I can't count the times
I've let you down
This I know you promise
That you'll never let me go

[Chorus]
