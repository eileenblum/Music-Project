Well there's people living for excitement
They feel like it's the only way of life

Born with anger
Life's hell every hour
From dawn to dusk they're always on the run

But if you think about it
Every heart has some love
A simple prayer might change the world
We just can't lock them up and throw away the key
That's not what we believe, NO

Heading toward destruction
Men of lawlessness
Opposing the righteous in every way

On a fine line
So don't take the chance
The wicked man is doomed by his own sin

But if you think about it
Every heart has some love
A simple prayer might change the world
We just can't lock them up and throw away the key
That's not what we believe, NO

You're running away from reality
It's a drastic measure you don't see
There's no reason to go on this way
It's not a way of life

Uncontrolled your lust gives birth to sin
And sin when it is full grown can lead to death

People listen
You've got to receive
The greatest gift of all-eternal life

And when you think about it
Every heart has some love
A simple prayer might change the world
And the One who loves you lives today
And it's Him you must receive
