Many will come
In the name of Him
But the Spirit's there
For all to see
Their blood runs cold
Just like the rest
But in the end of time
Will tell who will be blessed

[Chorus:]
We will see Him standing
When the rest are gone
He'll be dressed in white
And He will shine

If you believe
That He has come
Back from the dead
To save the souls of everyone
He'll give you life abundantly
And in the Father's hands
That's where we all will be

[Chorus:]
We will see Him standing
When the rest are gone
He'll be dressed in white
And He will shine

If you believe
That He has come
Back from the dead
To save the souls of everyone
He'll give you life abundantly
And in the Father's hands
That's where we all will be

[Chorus:]
Can you see the light?
Cam you feel the power?
He'll be the One who's dressed in white
