Many people live their lives
As if there's no tomorrow
Not caring what goes on
Just drowning in their sorrows
The times are tough
And their just heading for a fall
So can you tell me
What's the meaning of it all?

[Chorus:]
Beyond the mountain, where He waits for you and me

So many times you feel
You're left alone just standing
Well let me say that's nothing new!
The righteousness displayed
By Christ they all rejected
They hated Him and they'll hate you!

So count it joy
When you are headed for the wall
And just remember He's the meaning of it all

[Chorus 2:]
Beyond the mountain, is the place I wanna be
Beyond the mountain, is the place for you and me

[Repeat Chorus 2]

You struggle with this lonely time
You feel abandoned
Say no one takes the time to care
Oh ... can't you see the lies
That blind you leave you stranded
That special someone is out there

So count it joy
When you are headed for the wall
And just remember He's the meaning of it all

[Repeat Chorus 2]
