You sleep naked craving the taste of flesh surrounded by uncertainties,
You feel the cold of your misguided past.
Do you know there is so much more than this?
You're like a child living in a box, do you know there is so much more than this?
You want to believe in something that could never end.
You're all alone with nowhere to go, do you know there is so much more than this?
You sleep naked craving the taste of flesh, surrounded by uncertainties of who you are,
You want to believe in something that could never end.
This love you seek it isn't real.
You're holding on to a hope that could never be, surrounded by uncertainties.
This love you seek is what you'll learn to hate,
This love you fear is what you'll learn to love,
This love you seek it isn't real.
You're all alone nowhere to go, do you know there is so much more to this?
IT ISN'T REAL.
You want to believe in something that could never end, this love you seek it isn't real.
