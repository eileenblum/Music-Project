Now this world has shown its true face, and now will I live through tonight.
Tomorrow, this life halts abandoned you have been left astray.
CAN YOU STAND ON YOUR OWN?
This autumns bleeding, the faint, to fortify, it's hold on you.
Your body lays there unwilling to control yourself, as your mind decays.
You're dead and gone You've spent this lifetime living a lie.
Tomorrow this life halts abandoned, you have been left astray
CAN YOU STAND ON YOUR OWN? This autumn's bleeding, the fain, to fortify, its hold on you.
