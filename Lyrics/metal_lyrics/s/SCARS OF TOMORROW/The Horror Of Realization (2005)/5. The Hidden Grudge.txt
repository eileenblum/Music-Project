[featuring Alex of ATREYU]

Black inside, I won't become like you You want me to be something I could never be,
You want me to be the one that tears me down.
You're stabbing, you're stabbing deeper,
Your stabbing and aiming for my back.
You're stabbing deeper fixated on dead dreams,
You try to be the one who tears me down you will not tear me down.
Black inside, I won't become like you you speak with idle words
With hidden gestures you try to pierce my mind and try to take whats mine.
You try to be the one that tears me down and your words fall short.
I WON'T BECOME LIKE YOU.
You will not tear me down, your face is so cold an your heart has grown numb,
You're still the same.
Black inside I won't become like...
