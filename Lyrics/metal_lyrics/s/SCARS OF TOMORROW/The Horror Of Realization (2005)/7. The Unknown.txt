These walls are closing in. Tonight I see so much clearer, it's more than I thought
It could be.
Burn inside these lucid dreams the very ones that make you whole.
Dream inside, your withered words. And burn into the ashes.
I will not be deceived these days are the only days that I have to live.
Now I see the weakness that you hide, and I see it in your eyes, burn into the ashes,
THE TRUTH is all that I strive for. These walls are closing on us all,
Tonight these walls are closing in,
Tonight I see so much clearer, it's more than I thought it could be.
