I will live this day. With my head up high. I will live this day, like it was meant to be.
Can you see what this means to me? Can you see what lies in my heart?
MY HEART it was set on fire I can hear the lie in your words.
YOUR WORDS you were born a coward. I have longed for this day the day that you made.
The wait is over
I WILL WATCH YOU FALL
I will never put me head into the ground
I won't give in
I have longed for this day, the day that you made, the wait is over
I WILL WATCH YOU FALL.
I will watch you fall face down so far that you can never rise again
Lay your words upon my hands
I will shove them back until I let this pass.
You have always been the one to hold me down.
I've waited seven years for this to pass as the rest of the world lies at bay,
You are the great deceiver can you see what lies in my heart?
MY HEART it was set on fire
I can hear the lies in your words,
YOUR WORD you were born a coward I will watch you fall
