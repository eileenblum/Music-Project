Now your time is now, and I can see your pain.
It shines over everything you are, can you hold on to anything but grief?
You hide when you should rise. Can you hold on?
Reminders of the misery and it was never meant to be.
And now I see your pain it burns as it's tearing you apart. Can you hold on?
You bear the mark of time, Can you believe in your dreams? Can you believe in yourself?
Now your time is now. Rise Rise above.
And I can see your pain you hide when I'm in sight can you hold on?
These are reminders of the misery and it was never meant to be.
You bear the marks of time. Rise, Rise above.
Reminders of the pain you hide in yourself, you must believe.
Reminders of the misery and it was never meant to be,
These things haunt you when you wake, these things haunt you when you sleep.
Can you hold on? Rise Rise above
