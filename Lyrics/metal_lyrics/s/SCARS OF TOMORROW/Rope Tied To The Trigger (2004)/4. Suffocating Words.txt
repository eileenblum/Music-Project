Another victim of life
Within you it hides
And when I looked you in the eyes
I froze inside
And when I heard the news I ran
I froze inside
But now forever
You will live in me
Your face
Imprinted
In my head

And now you're all alone
Yet you will never know
What you could have done

The dead cold stare
Left whimpered
With passion
And there is no fear in your eyes
Left whimpered
With passion

And you mean
More than words can show

And when I heard the news I ran
I froze inside
But now forever
You will live in me
Your face
Imprinted
In my head

And now you're all alone
Yet you will never know
What you could have done

You're all alone

You mean more than words can show
(Suffocating words)

You're all alone
