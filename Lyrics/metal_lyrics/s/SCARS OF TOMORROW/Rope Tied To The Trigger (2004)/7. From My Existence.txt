You are a child
Born into a dead world
Of fairy tales and you are consumed
With a smirk you lather the angish
With a crooked smile you are consumed
These scars will never heal the wound

Erase your face from my existence

It only makes you stronger
It's all inside

Die alone in this world you have made
In my perfect world you were never there

Lay your body down
Lay it down
