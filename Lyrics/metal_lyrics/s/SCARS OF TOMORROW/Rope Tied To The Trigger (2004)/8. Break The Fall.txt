Break the fall
For all the hate in this world
Now you're torn between
Your empty thoughts
Run your mind into a million thoughts
They flow through you like poison

Change
And you've changed
Into something I wasn't ready for

Now you're torn between your empty thoughts
Of another day's lost cause
End this hate
Break the fall for whats inside
