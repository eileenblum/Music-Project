Inside will hell arise
To overcome and change
Will you make the difference
Make the change

Separation
You must rise

Inside will hell arise
To overcome and change
Will you make the difference
Make the change
Of a body left plagued
Disfigured with blind hate
Of a body left plagued
Disfigured

Separation
You must rise

Your fears
They embrace
Every part of you
Will you make the difference
Make the change

Empower
Your heart and mind
To make a difference
And change the life for those
Who hide in fear of you
Of torment
Of flesh and blood

We're all the same
And you separate this smile
From your molded mask
Empower
