You left me here
Alone in my own world
From pain
A new light is born
Your perfect world's
Evading
Sedating
Your perfect world's
Evading
Sedating
I hate your face
Reminding
Despiting
I hate your life
You cast me down
You look at me with one glance
And turn your face
To watch you burn
You bury me alive

In your perfect world
I'd rather make peace with 3 rounds

But I'll watch you burn
Your perfect world's
Evading
Sedating
I hate your life
You cast me down
Burn
You bury me
Watch you burn
