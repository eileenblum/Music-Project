Taken away
To a time and place that brings you peace
That clears your mind
You're changed by a shard of glass
Impaled by grief

Reflections
Reflections
Of a past that you can't forget
Reflections
Reflections
Of a time you can't forget

You saw your tortured past come to an end
Here comes your end
Forsake your life

Reflections
Reflections
Of a past that you can't forget
Reflections
Reflections
Of a time you can't forget

You saw your clouded past
Flash before your eyes
Forsake your life
Brainwashing you

Your reasons for leaving
Your breaking this evening
And you saw the pain that you hide inside
And you damn the day
Reflections
