Liar
Can you taste the stench
Liar
Can't you hear their screams
You tell me you're not the one who made the problem
You sit here
Watch closely
And Hesitate
And you look inside
Look inside to free your mind
Liar
Can you taste the stench
Liar
Can't you hear their screams

In a time of love
In a time of pain
As we bleed
As we choke
As the rest of the world watches
As we bleed
As we choke
As we die

You sit here
Watch closely
And Hesitate
And you look inside
Look inside
Free your mind
We are born from misery
We are torn from you and me
I call you out
And question everything that you do
To play this world for all that it's worth
They build your stature
For nothing more but a chance to live
To live with freedoms
And you'll end us all
End us all

In a time of love
In a time of pain
As we bleed
As we choke
As the rest of the world watches
As we bleed
As we choke
As we die

As we choke
(Disfigure)
(Disfiguring)
As we choke
