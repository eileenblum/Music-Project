Blank words supercede your thoughts
Blinding by the seams standing silent

I watched the spawn of a broken day
It's ended with silence
Of a broken day
It's ended with silence

In dying days

Carry away the burden
And you try so hard
You're next in line to watch it fall

Blank words supercede your thoughts
Blinding by the seams standing silent

I watched the spawn of a broken day
It's ended with silence
Of a broken day
It's ended with silence

In dying days

And we stand upon the grave
And we stand in dying days

And I forgive you for for showing that you don't even care
And I forgive you for never thinking that you were wrong
