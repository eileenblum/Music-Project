I am emptiedPink flesh forms a sweet smell burningI've been here for agesSteaming human smokeI wake to palenessMy body burning dark chasmsI've been here for agesI am emptiedPink flesh formingYour smell alive with deathI wake to palenessSteaming human smokeYour scent aliveMy body burningI've been hereSweetened by nothingI've been here for ages
