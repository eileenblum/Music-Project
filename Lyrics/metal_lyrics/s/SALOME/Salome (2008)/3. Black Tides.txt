Fleshing out behind dreamsYou whisper strange sleep A silent drone You whisper strange sleep Pale ears ring of you Shoving dead omens into lipsFleshing out behind dreams Hidden truths blurred awakenings Pale ears ring of you Your subliminal black tongue Evoking your presence Entranced by hands Drowning a white body soundless Pale ears ring of you Evoking your presence As big as the ocean
