You know every chasmBody broken in shapelessnessEmptinessYou know every chasmTasting the changeCaptivate inhale blissWhere I amHere you crave you takeFingers go insideFingers decayYou know every chasmBody broken to shapelessnessEmptinessI live through your death disjointedDeath evokingWhen all love is goneI live through your bonesFinding violence to beautifyI created every crowded tombTo let you inSucking your white through my gutSucking white to let you inThis is blissThis is bliss
