At warWith the crowd The power to ruleInternal manipulation At war withAuthority Every man and womanRaised to cowerBy abuseBy withholding of love Nothing is worth autonomyNothing is worth dignity The crowd became a voiceFor the psycheThe crowd became a voiceFor superficial wantOf contemptEmotional wreckageSwallowed depression The crowd became a voiceOf jealousyDissatisfaction By abuseWe were made to cower To be lessThan who we areTo be lessThan truth
