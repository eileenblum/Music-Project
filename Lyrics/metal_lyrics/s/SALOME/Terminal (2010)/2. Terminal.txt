My mind circulatesThoughts of passingDiscolored and dryTerrified Bled of connectionVoicelessDejectedWithout definition I'll be no oneTo obliterate the mind's invention I'll surrender to mouthing affirmationsHelpless in my own severanceEaten up by my own thoughts Dangerous in my ignoranceDeep in my dead revolving dream Mourning my bodyDull and frail I'll be no one
