I am legion, the one who seek command
A vessel of the dead and I'm here to reprimand
I am ego I am pain I am hatred I am pain
The voices in your head wishing you were dead
Steering on this wicked path driving through the depths of wrath
I've been a me, a people, I have no other equal
Serve me I'm your master, a cause for disaster
Chaos and power, works for me a tower

I am the dark, I am the thunder
I am the shadow that you live under
I am the wolf, I am the hunted
666, that's the number
I am the angel of death, I am the upper hand
I am the god of war, I am the bogeyman
I am your fear, I am the monster
666, that's the number

I am legion, the coming of an age
Disciple of rage, trapped upon the stage
Part of many faces, found in all places
My beautiful appearance, claims to adherence
The lies to the wise, the lord of the flies
Weakness of the mind, is the fall of mankind
Knowledge is a curse, ignorance is worse

I am legion, this is how they end
To hell I shall send, sinners to suffer
One way or another, sacrifice the casualty
Rights of immortality, embrace mortality
Fallen from grace, a morbid disgrace
Reap and rule your fear, the apocalypse is here
Tortured by the sight, clinging to your life
Into the abyss, I am drowned? By your fist?
