[Verse 1]
No debate, shame the game
Shut 'em down in the name of change
Those against your point of view
A homophobe, racist, or bigot to you
I'll stand and won't cave or apologize for what I say
You're here to silence me and I'm ready to fight
The Race Cartel
They need us divided
While the mainstream press
Do their best to hide it
Divide us up by our skin color
Try to make us hate each other
Silence is not my choice
So let them hear our voice

[Chorus]
Not about practice, all about preach
Call me a bigot, if you don't like what I teach
Try to destroy me when you don't like what I say
You are the lynch mob 
You are the business of hate 

[Verse 2]
Speak the lies
Perpetuate
Make victims, teach them to hate
All of this shall seal your fate
Cry for help when it's too late
A business run on fear and blame 
Times have changed, but the tune's the same
Don't blame your faults on me
That's on you
You're like a maggot 
Feeding on the back of
Those you've come to live off, the suits you've come to rip off
Your war of hate, disguised as compassion
But out of sight the checks they keep on cashing

[Chorus]
Not about practice, all about preach
Call me a bigot, if you don't like what I teach
Try to destroy me when you don't like what I say
You are the lynch mob 
You are the business of hate 

[Bridge]
The Salem Witch Trials
Have come back around
All afraid to make a sound
Don't tell me who I am
And what I believe 
It all depends on you and how you perceive, yeah 
No freedom of speech 
We're politically correct
Thanks to this moral defect 
They tell you it's this
But it's actually that
Two steps up front
Four steps back, uh

We cower and apologize, 'cause we're trained to
And it won't change until we push back
The only thing they want is our silence
And they only have control, if we don't fight back

[Chorus]
Not about practice, all about preach
Call me a bigot, if you don't like what I teach
Try to destroy me when you don't like what I say
You are the lynch mob 
You are the business of hate
