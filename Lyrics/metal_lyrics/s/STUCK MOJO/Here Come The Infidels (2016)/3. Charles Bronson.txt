What's the cause and effect
Allow me to dissect
The laws are insufficient
The justice system is deficient
Through my point of view
None of this is new
Here's perspective for you
Punishment is due

My vigilante vendetta
Roaming with a Beretta
Fighting fire with fire
Stopping crime with crime
Yo, I'm losing my mind
Now ya under attack
Sooner or later
Somebody pushes back

I gotta fight to protect my family
From a corrupt and violent society
My solution may seem like insanity
I'm Charles Bronson
The vigilante!

I am Charles Bronson
I'm the talk of the land
From the city to the valley
I am Charles Bronson
Kicking ass, taking names
Yeah, ya better know the name
I am Charles Bronson
What's ya chance of survival?
Man, it's highly improbable
I am Charles Bronson
Cross my path, contemplate
Concentrate, annihilate!

They see me as a cancer
But I'm really the cure
The unspoken judge, jury, executioner
Y'all react instead of act
Then you try to find the fact
Of the matter is I'm pissed
Don't ya get the gist

Ya made a grave mistake
My nerve's about to break
The blind leading the blind
No hope for human kind
That is what we find
Now ya under attack
Sooner or later
Somebody pushes back

I gotta fight to protect my family
From a corrupt and violent society
My solution may seem like insanity
I'm Charles Bronson
The vigilante!

I am Charles Bronson
I'm the talk of the land
From the city to the valley
I am Charles Bronson
Kicking ass, taking names
Yeah, ya better know the name
I am Charles Bronson
What's ya chance of survival?
Man, it's highly improbable
I am Charles Bronson
Cross my path, contemplate
Concentrate, annihilate!

 no longer look away
There's so much loss and pain
And the hate I feel it consumes me
I'll set the balance right
Someone will bleed tonight
I am the hunter
And hell is coming with me

I'm Charles Bronson
The vigilante!

[2x]
I am Charles Bronson
I'm the talk of the land
From the city to the valley
I am Charles Bronson
Kicking ass, taking names
Yeah, ya better know the name
I am Charles Bronson
What's ya chance of survival?
Man, it's highly improbable
I am Charles Bronson
Cross my path, contemplate
Concentrate, annihilate!
