[Verse 1] 
I am the big riff dealer
Confidence stealer 
Hand me a mic
I'll blow your mind right through the speakers
A four-man army that will never cease-fire 
Back in the game to set the world on fire
So get ready
For a display of power
We broke the Richter scale 
With sonic gunpowder
We shot down the sun
Beats blast like a gun
With bullets made of fun
We set the rhythms to stun

[Chorus]
Fire me, fire me
Fire me up until I breathe electric
Fire me, fire me
Fire me up until we burn the sky
Fire me (fire!), fire me (fire!)
Fire me up until I'm reconnected
Fire me (fire!), fire me (fire!)
Fire me all because we own the night

[Verse 2]
All you suckers move over
We're the southern super nova
The baddest on the planet
And we just about had it
Causin' commotion
Comin' back with a boom
Give a welcome back
To the four-piece of doom

We blow the roof
When the dance floor's movin'
And rock the crowd
When the backbeat's groovin'
The original rap rock crossover formula
Created and perfected by the Big Dixie Mafia!

[Chorus]
Fire me, fire me
Fire me up until I breathe electric
Fire me, fire me
Fire me up until we burn the sky
Fire me (fire!), fire me (fire!)
Fire me up until I'm reconnected
Fire me (fire!), fire me (fire!)
Fire me all because we own the night

[Bridge]
We are the Kings of Disaster
Known to some as masters
We shake the building
From the basement to the rafters
When we take the stage
Stand up, throw ya hands up
Let me hear your voice
Now scream!

[Chorus]
Fire me, fire me
Fire me up until I breathe electric
Fire me, fire me
Fire me up until we burn the sky
Fire me (fire!), fire me (fire!)
Fire me up until I'm reconnected
Fire me (fire!), fire me (fire!)
Fire me all because we own the night

[Outro]
All because we own the night
[2x]
