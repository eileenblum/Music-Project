[Verse 1]
Welcome everybody to the dirty dirty south
Let me enlighten all of y'all to what we're all about
Don't dare cross lines, so ya better watch ya mouth
The Mojo's back and here to stay without a da-da-da-doubt

[Pre-chorus]
Fully armed, locked n loaded
Get it through your skull and noted
Merciless brute force
Never gonna show remorse
Ready, set, gettin' checked
Nothing but another wreck
Just begun, now ya done
Where ya gonna hide and run?

[Chorus]
We are the style buckin'
Motherfucking
Trend settin'
No regrettin'
Gun packin'
Mouth smackin'
Southern fried!

Original
Mythical
Fearless and invincible
Now shout it out loud
Here come the infidels

[Verse 2]
Bodyin' careers, who's next on the hit list?
'Bout to slaughter everyone and won't leave a witness
Yadda yadda yadda
Once again with chitta chatta
Kick ya to the curb
Sit back and watch ya heads splatta

[Pre-chorus]
Fully armed, locked n loaded
Get it through your skull and noted
Merciless brute force
Never gonna show remorse
Ready, set, gettin' checked
Nothing but another wreck
Just begun, now ya done
Where ya gonna hide and run?

[Chorus]
We are the style buckin'
Motherfucking
Trend settin'
No regrettin'
Gun packin'
Mouth smackin'
Southern fried!

Original
Mythical
Fearless and invincible
Now shout it out loud
Here come the infidels

[Bridge]
Leavin' paths war torn
Word is born
Every verse I spit's a parable
Our style is incomparable
The Tribal Armada
All you fools are nada
The Big Dixie Mafia
That's who's stoppin' ya

Everybody listen
The Mojo's arisen
The system's broken
We have awoken
So take ya shot
'Cause now it's on
The rest of y'all can hail
The Rap Rock Dawn

[Pre-chorus]
Fully armed, locked n loaded
Get it through your skull and noted
Merciless brute force
Never gonna show remorse
Ready, set, gettin' checked
Nothing but another wreck
Just begun, now ya done
Where ya gonna hide and run?

[Chorus]
We are the style buckin'
Motherfucking
Trend settin'
No regrettin'
Gun packin'
Mouth smackin'
Southern fried!

Original
Mythical
Fearless and invincible
Now shout it out loud
Here come the infidels
