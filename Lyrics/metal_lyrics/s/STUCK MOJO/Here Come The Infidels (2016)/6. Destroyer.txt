[Verse 1]
It's not always what ya say
But what ya don't
The silence speaks volumes
But they won't
Livin' day by day
On pay to pay
And that's the way
They expect you to stay
On welfare rolls
To keep control
Another pain killer
The pandemic in the villa
Those in power
Keep 'em all on a fix
Then they burn preachers to the crucifix

[Pre-chorus]
This is for the takers
The haters
Who walk around like saviors
The liars
Deniers
Who come to steal your fire
Burn it down, you never built a goddamn thing in your life
You just feed upon the blood and sweat like parasites

[Chorus]
Destroyer, destroyer
This time I'm comin' for ya
Destroyer, destroyer
This time I'm gunnin' for ya

[Verse 2]
Demons everywhere
You can feel it in the air
The leaders don't care
And it's not about what's fair
Moral re-education
A promised salvation
Narratives they sculpture
Diseases to culture
Trashing the community
We're lacking unity
Those who rule cheer the crowd
Just to keep power
But in this final hour
Caught the bluff
Enough's enough

[Pre-chorus]
This is for the takers
The haters
Who walk around like saviors
The liars
Deniers
Who come to steal your fire
Burn it down, you never built a goddamn thing in your life
You just feed upon the blood and sweat like parasites

[Chorus]
Destroyer, destroyer
This time I'm comin' for ya
Destroyer, destroyer
This time I'm gunnin' for ya
[2x]

[Bridge]
There's a battle waging on
And you gotta choose a side
It's inescapable
Now there's nowhere left to hide
Do as they say, but not as they do 
That's the message they present to you
Perspective's everything
But people believe anything
Fitting their agenda
They praise and surrender
As it was written
Now it is said        
Welcome to the generation of the living dead

[Pre-chorus]
This is for the takers
The haters
Who walk around like saviors
The liars
Deniers
Who come to steal your fire
Burn it down, you never built a goddamn thing in your life
You just feed upon the blood and sweat like parasites

[Outro]
Destroyer, destroyer
This time I'm comin' for ya
Destroyer, destroyer
This time we're gunnin' for ya

Destroyer, destroyer
This time we're comin' for ya
Destroyer, destroyer
This time I'm gunnin' for ya

Destroyer!
