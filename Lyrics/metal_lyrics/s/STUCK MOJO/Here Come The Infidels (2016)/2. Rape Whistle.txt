[Verse 1]
The thought police is now activated 
No disagreements will be tolerated 
Reduced to victims or victimizers
Not to protect, but to divide us
Setting standards for what they'll tolerate
On the lookout for those who violate
With feigned anger they move in to destroy
The rape whistle deployed!

[Chorus]
The most vile speech must be defended
To burn a flag or draw Mohammad
But that kind of speech won't be permitted 
Go get the rape whistle!

[Verse 2]
Here come the storm troopers with brown shirts
To put their boots on your throat
Every word you've ever spoken
Scrutinized until you're broken
Don't you see, we're all the same
Except you, you're the one to blame
The focus of our nation's shame
That's him
So get the rape whistle!

[Chorus]
The most vile speech must be defended
To burn a flag or draw Mohammad
But that kind of speech won't be permitted 
Go get the rape whistle!

[Bridge]
The government's snitches
Are providing their pitches
Making you conform
To whatever's the norm
So ya stand in line
Without having a say
And continue to obey
But you'll have to pay
Then you feel betrayed
In this Holy Crusade
They continue to preach
While they impeach
Our own beliefs
So give us your grief
While they abide like sheep
â¦go get the rape whistle!

[Chorus]
The most vile speech must be defended
To burn a flag or draw Mohammad
But that kind of speech won't be permitted 
Go get the rape whistle!
