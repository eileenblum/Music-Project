[Verse 1] 
Everybody knows
This is how the story goes
Observe the behaviors
Of these apparent saviors
With their propaganda
They're trying to command ya
They bring you their way
By leadin' you astray

[Pre-chorus]
The profit of fear
Is made very clear
From the words of liars
And the false messiahs
They preach beliefs they don't believe themselves
Music, religion, and Hollywood sells!

[Chorus]
You are
The worst person on Earth
Should have it printed right on your shirt
Many other worthy candidates
But it's a title you work hard to get
You are
The worst person on the planet
When you were born, yeah
God damn it
Not the first dick I wrote a song about true
But this one I wrote for you

[Verse 2]
Hollywood hypocrisy
Makes them the worst personality
Demand a gun-free society
While your bodyguards are carrying
You private jet flyer
Calling me a climate change denier
Droning on about the greater good
Then tax dodging
By not filming in Hollywood

[Pre-chorus]
The profit of fear
Is made very clear
From the words of liars
And the false messiahs
They preach beliefs they don't believe themselves
Music, religion, and Hollywood sells!

[Chorus]
You are the worst person on Earth
Should have it printed right on your shirt
Many other worthy candidates
But it's a title you work hard to get
You are
The worst person on the planet
When you were born, yeah
God damn it
Not the first bitch I wrote a song about true
But this one I wrote for you!

[Verse 3]
You Raged so hard Against
That you partnered with the biggest music corporation in the world
Acquiring millions in profits
Exploiting the system
The same one you call evil
Fighting the income gap
How much does your roadie make?
I'm taking your whammy pedal
Shut the fuck up
You are the worst person on Earth

[Pre-chorus]
The profit of fear
Is made very clear
From the words of liars
And the false messiahs
They preach beliefs they don't believe themselves
Music, religion, and Hollywood sells!

[Chorus]
You are the worst person on Earth
Should have it printed right on your shirt
Many other worthy candidates
But it's a title you work hard to get
You are
The worst person on the planet
When you were born, yeah
God damn it
Not the first dick I wrote a song about true
But this one I wrote for you!
