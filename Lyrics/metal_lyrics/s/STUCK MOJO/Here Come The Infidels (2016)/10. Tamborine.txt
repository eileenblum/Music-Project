Oh child, such a pretty little thing
Gonna take ya for a swing
Wanna see what you can bring
So I'll give you this attention
Let me mention
Love me some adventure
Heaven must've sent ya
Oh!
Let's dive in the dark
Put the fire in my heart
A little lovin' never hurt
Sweet daddy's little girl
Now you got me to my knees
Make me beg "Oh please"
Got me howlin' like

Go shake your tambourine
And make everything alright
I wanna rock the beat
When the clock strikes midnight
Go shake your tambourine
And bring this room to life
Play me that dirty rhythm
And make this grown man cry

Ya somethin' out a dream
Unlike anyone I've seen
If you know what I mean?
Go and shake your tambourine
Classic Daisy Duke wearin'
Every man starin'
As ya dancin' on the bar-top
Keep swingin' ya hips
To the sound of southern riffs
Now we're rockin' to the beat
And ya knocked me off my feet
Honey, hon, hon, hon, don't you fire off my gun
We'll be off together before the midday

Go shake your tambourine
And make everything alright
I wanna rock the beat
When the clock strikes midnight
Go shake your tambourine
And bring this room to life
Play me that dirty rhythm
And make this grown man cry

Found a sweet southern belle
We can both kiss and tell
Girl, the way I saw ya twirl
Simply made my eyes swirl
Pushed my luck
It's the lotto I struck
Sometimes you gotta roll the dice
Oh baby, play nice

Go shake your tambourine
And make everything alright
I wanna rock the beat
When the clock strikes midnight
Go shake your tambourine
And bring this room to life
Play me that dirty rhythm
And make this grown man cry

Go shake your tambourine!
