1, 2, 3, 4
Burn this motherfucker to the floor
5, 6, 7, 8
Light it up, burn it, hey

First off I'm not a rapper
I'm a lyrical machine
Controversy's finest
Dropping bombs on the scene
Destiny in motion
No one can intervene
You can only dream
So what do I mean?

The cream of the crop
The one you can't stop
Cross my path
You're a goner
The industry's a bitch
I'ma call her Sarah Conner
Time to terminate her
Like click, click, pow
And that's my style

I've been around to see you when it's calling
I've been around to see you fall down
I've been around to see the devil and you talking
I'll be around long after you're gone

[2x]
No
Step to me and you might get checked
No
Regret, don't test me, boy

[2x]
1, 2, 3, 4
Burn this motherfucker to the floor
5, 6, 7, 8
Light it up, burn it, hey

Haven't started at all
That was just the mic check
'bout to get on deck
Leaving this ship wrecked
Show me respect
Yeah, you bet and can expect
That the next set of words
Will be killer than the last
The pop contrast
Putting everyone on blast
Ahead of the future
Learned my ways from the past
Flowing like a veteran
Clearly I am better than the rest
Equal to the best
Now you impressed?

I've been around to see you when it's calling
I've been around to see you fall down
I've been around to see the devil and you talking
I'll be around long after you're gone

[2x]
No
Step to me and you might get checked
No
Regret, don't test me, boy

Listen up, kids
'Cause I'm dropping knowledge
I'm the professor
Teaching class at college
Praises be to Run-DMC
Anthrax, Chuck D
And Public Enemy
The ones we respect as legendary
This un-holy matrimony
Of hip and hop mixed in with rock
Bring the Noise, go and talk
Then we'll show ya where to walk
'bout to Set it Off a la Big Daddy Kane
I'll teach you how to keep a flow and maintain
With this rhythm I envision with precision
That Kool G Rap, yeah
The Rhymes I Express
On the Road to Riches, I expect no less
Like Eric B. and Rakim, Paid in Full
Legends never die
Rest in peace, Dime
Get ya pull

[2x]
1, 2, 3, 4
Burn this motherfucker to the floor
5, 6, 7, 8
Light it up, burn it, hey

So ya wondering and tripping
How I got in this position
Got it in my intuition
It's a given that I'm driven
By the way that I've been living
Career killing is the mission
Gonna put you in omission
When I get ya in submission
Never forgiven
As a matter of fact
This is verbal combat
Assault and abuse
Ya got no use
Can't even pay ya dues
You'd never last a day
Walking in these shoes

[2x]
No
Step to me and you might get jacked
No
Regret, don't test me, boy
