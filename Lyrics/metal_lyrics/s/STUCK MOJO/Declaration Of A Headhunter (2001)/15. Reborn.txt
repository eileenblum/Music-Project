[Bonus Track]

Attitude adjustments
Everything's clear
Bringing in a new life
So I have plenty of fears
Feelin' all good about my groove right now
Positive energies all around, wow!
People use the debt, try to sale
We survive like a Rocky bout
Ill feelins not me
Do I hold a grudge, you can be the judge

Now they keep talkin' bout this crazy world we're livin' in
I'm like a Phoenix reborn to rock on
It ain't over to the trooper, but Mojo lives on
Now they keep talkin' bout it, how sensitive to the skin

New visions, live my life reborn, life as I know it

Nothing to have
Another life I'd live
I learn from all the silly things I did
I learn from all the crazy things I did

Light at the end of my tunnel
Forming the funnel
Storm blown over getting drenched like
Got ink on my covers
Start brand new revived my groove
Looking for that push ready
So I can feed my seed to grow like me
And live care free
Set the foundations all around the nation
Same town, same place, just different stations

Line-up:
Bonz: vocals;
Rich Ward: guitar;
Dan Dryden: bass;
Bud Fontsere: drums.
