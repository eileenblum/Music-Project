I watch you be consumed by your own weakness
It's a sickness and I've been a witness
No pride no respect the image you project
It's a sickness and I've been a witness

The sickness inside of you
It eats you deletes you
The haze that you live in
It rapes you it breaks you

I watch you travel down the path of evilution
Your words they sicken me
Where's the solution
The life you lead is soulless pollution
You seem to live your life in total confusion

Step up, you can front if you want to

You're a slave and a slug to your favorite drug
You're half a man, your own biggest fan
I often visualize this world
Without your filthy presence
And I stand pissin' on your grave
Without a sense of reverence

A disease of society
Stranger to sobriety
You're half a man, your own biggest fan
