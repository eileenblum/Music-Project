All in the name of war

We crave it, we need it
We watch it on our TV sets
We wage it, we breed it
Then spilling blood with no regrets
Senorita glad to meet ya'
We kill your people as we greet ya'
Our wars define our place in time
Resolved by feud for all mankind

Man's destiny
Man's suffering

Fuck it!
Give war a chance

Embedded internal
We know that it's our destiny
Internalized paralyze
The thirst for war, the killing seed
In the jungle by the river
Death for sale
We will deliver
Our wars define our place in time
Resolve by feud for all mankind
