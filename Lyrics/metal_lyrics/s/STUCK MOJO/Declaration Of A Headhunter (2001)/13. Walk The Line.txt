I live for the hunt
I thirst for the kill
I lust and I eat
I sleep where I will
Love the thrill - take the pill
Standing still and growing ill
Gun owner and I carry
Carjack proof so punks be wary
Seeds we sew - to and fro
Compromised and here we go

Only the righteous on the light side
Changing seasons along for the ride 
I search for purpose, do you?
Fear surrendered

Walk the line, come one and do it
Walk the line, don't act like you knew it

I can be a motherfuckin' dick
Got a temper and it'll flare up real quick
Talk the shit - run the lip
Nervous tick - hear the click
Emperor of this world
King of the planet
Sinner by trade
Creature by habit
Have the gall - climb the wall
Want it all - never fall
