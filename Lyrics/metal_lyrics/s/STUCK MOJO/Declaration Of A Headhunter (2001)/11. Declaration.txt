Events of recent history indicate that Americans are setting a course
for the end of their own great nation. The ever growing trend in
this country is to judge people, not by their individual character,
but by their identity as a member of a specific group
No one has ever succeeded or failed in life as a result of their
group affiliation
A person's success or failure is also not based on luck, but on the
sum total of the decisions that they have made. Those who succeed
do so through good work ethic and their wise use of their power to choose
The opposite is true for those who fail
The ideals of individual accountability and responsibility in the
United States are dying everyday. A gun cannot be responsible for
a death, just as a shovel cannot be responsible for digging a ditch
Both are only tools, that have no will of their own
Responsibility is an adjunct through conscious choice and is the price
we pay for freedom
Freedom is also a tool
It is an essential tool needed by human beings if they are to prosper,
rather than to merely survive. Yet there are those who would rather
trade their freedom for security
Some believe that it is the responsibility of government to provide for you
In truth, we form government to ensure and protect the freedom
that is already inherently ours
