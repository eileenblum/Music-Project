I lived beyond my fears
Until my years
Have withered me, delivered me
Divinity and you'll
Never catch me on my knees
Ride upon my horse so mighty
Hated both the black and white
Always constant never falter
Rage like fire move like water

(This hate makes me a better man
My hate helps me take a stand)
Strong inside, clear of purpose
Heart of stone, never nervous

Never hidden never ran
So hate me with all you can
Hate Breed (I've fallen in with the hate breed)

You wanna feel the rush until the crush
has beat you down spins you around
The hate you found and your rage
will never let you down
Strike them down with all your fury
Judged with hate the acting jury
Always swift with no deliberation justice
done purification
