Fuck you drunk driver, hate you like MacGyver.
Mission Impossible after 20 screwdrivers.
I ask for your keys, and you said "oh, no nigga please,
I can drive blindfolded steering with my knees."
Oh really, your vision's all blurry and that it's clear you see a 12 man
jury but if it was me I'd cut off your right arm
so you can't drink and drive and cause no harm
running niggas over like Death Race 2000.
Innocent by standers you keep on housing and why the mothers
still cry and tell me what you say each and every time.
Sorry?
Well sorry's not getting it.
Gimmie your face and let me start hitting it.
9 out of 10 the drunk drivers live.
I have to say, "Oh lord please forgive."

You ain't nothing but a monkey behind the wheel
Fuck you drunk driver...
Monkey behind the wheel.
Fuck you drunk driver...

Green light, yellow light, red light,

go and you went but your fender got bent.
You sent a little girl to her grave brave and bold
and her mom's treasured her just like gold.
Green arrow turns real narrow.
Monkey boom bam, truck just slam.
My man Spike was on his way to a Mojo jam!
We're MADD, we're SADD, we're hurting real bad.
We don't want no more no more loved ones zipped up
in body bags.
Oh now you're funny how you gonna get home?
How 'bout showing the motherfucker a damn phone.
Get off my shit before you get abused!!

Sorry, well sorry's not getting it.
Gimmie your face and let me start hitting it.
9 out of 10 the drunk drivers live.
I have to say, "Oh lord please forgive."

You ain't nothing but a monkey behind the wheel
Fuck you drunk driver...
Monkey behind the wheel.
Fuck you drunk driver...

This is what a drunk driver gets.
A stiff ass sentence that he sure won't forget.
Wake up in ICU wanting a cold brew he sees he can't

'cause he's hooked up to some tubes...
Looking like shit, can't remember what he hit.
Oh it's coming back and he's feeling kinda sick.
Over and over it plays in your head,
now you're wishing that you were the one dead...

Instead it was the van, the one with the band.
Forty feet of grass and then you crashed.
No, you didn't see 'em 'cause you were asleep at the wheel.
Now it's a curse the others rolled in a hearse
and it hurts and it's getting kinda worse,
but you freeze and you drop to your knees
'cause that's the motherfucker you killed in your dreamsss...

You ain't nothing but a monkey behind the wheel
Fuck you drunk driver...
Monkey behind the wheel.
Fuck you drunk driver...
