Some say militant, others say rebel,

well my intellet is on a different level.
The black to the heart with self-awareness darts.
You say it's trouble that I am trying to start.
Well, that would be smart and mighty black of me to start up something

and make people see that the Uncle Sam Sham was the biggest in society.
When I was young, yeah in grammar school,

a teacher couldn't give me a damn clue.
I was taught to pledge to old glory the flag but
now it's just fifty stars put on a rag.
Don't get me wrong cause I am spitting lyrics that are strong.

Cointelpro did plenty damage but you couldn't get along
so we manage uprise against capitalist.
You be in prison calling me a communist, yo check your vision.
Fifty stars you see when you get hit, the red is
for the blood when my brothers were shot.
The blues we got when our leaders were hit,

and the majority which proclaim authority.
Red, black, and green is my priority now.
Just think if the rebel flag was flying,

we'd be in trouble, yo I ain't lying.
In order to be free we must teach.

Black and white, white and black,

we're here to fight and kill the ill about the stereotype.
Some say dramatical just anti-systematical,

then you want to call me a Pro-Black Radical,

then we make the switch to the Richie Rich.
Some want to call him all that shhhhh.
I don't think so.
Yo, Rich, spit that attitude.

Bonz, I know right from wrong, wrong from right,
the system's got me mad hype I am ready to fight tonight, no time to wait.
You know this country's headed for a fucked-up fate.
Kids are dying, mothers crying, and missles flying,
the press is lying and there is no denying.
Step back so you won't get sprayed by assassinating
cuts that the, that the Mojo lay.

The Uncle Sam Sham was the biggest of them all...never taking a fall.
The red, white and blue I'm telling you for who;
The rich and the majority, not the poor and the minority,
You know what I mean?
So let's wake up from this star-spangled dream.
The S-T-U-C-K M-O-J-O is here to let you know...
