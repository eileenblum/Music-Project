Youth never learns the truth about life.
All they see is money, 'hos, a lot of hype.
I can tell you things that are wrong and some are right,
but I have a view of a different type.

I seen him come up on the block slang the rocks for the cops,
and my mother's overworked and my pop's gone berserk.
She puts on teeny weeny skirts for the money, that ain't funny.
I got to stay alive do what I do to survive!

If I close my eyes will I rise?
If I don't that won't be no surprise.
I live my life like my last.
Learned many lessons but I have to laugh.
Because your not...
...Promised...
...Tomorrow!
Because your not...
...Promised...
...Tomorrow!
Because your not...
...Promised...
...Tomorrow!
Because your not...
...Don't live for today.

One life to live full of stress and strife.
Obstacles of chaos any time, many kind.
I can tell you things that are wrong and some are
right,
but I have a view of a different type.

I seen him grow up kinda wild,

a spoiled child living foul and he's fed a silver spoon,

and he still acts like a goon.
I don't understand it son.
Why must you carry a gun?
For the fun and the fame, pulling triggers ain't no game.

If I close my eyes will I rise?
If I don't that won't be no surprise.
I live my life like my last.
Learned many lessons but I have to laugh.
Because your not...
...Promised...
...Tomorrow!
Because your not...
...Promised...
...Tomorrow!
Because your not...
...Promised...
...Tomorrow!
Because your not...
...Don't live for today.

Fuck the dumb ditty dumb able bodies being bums.
People always talking shit, get yours if it's not legit.
How you think the rich got rich?
Cry and bitch and pitch a fit.
I say mind over matter and your pockets will be phatter!!!

If I close my eyes will I rise?
If I don't that won't be no surprise.
I live my life like my last.
Learned many lessons but I have to laugh.
Because your not...
...Promised...
...Tomorrow!
Because your not...
...Promised...
...Tomorrow!
Because your not...
...Promised...
...Tomorrow!
Because your not...
...Live my life like my last.
Because your not...
