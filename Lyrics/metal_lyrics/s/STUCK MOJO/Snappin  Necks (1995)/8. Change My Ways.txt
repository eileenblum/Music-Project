I used to live my life in fear.
Thinking that my ways were wrong.
I lived my life by a book, written by Man.

I jumped more evils than your man Knevil,

not looking forward to a genocidal sequel.
Soul searching dark corners it's no lurking.
Believe in self to better your mental health...

Got to change my, gotta get away, get away, gotta
change my ways!!
Got to change my, gotta get away, get away, gotta
change my ways!!
Got to change my, gotta get away, get away, gotta
change my ways!!
Got to change my, gotta get away, get away, gotta
change my ways!!

I used to live my life in fear.
Thinking that my ways were wrong.
I lived my life by a book, written by Man.
Nailed for substance so what's the use?
You're picking on a black man was my excuse.
Sent me into exile, hard labor penal.
Four years out and my attitude's real foul!

Got to change my, gotta get away, get away, gotta
change my ways!!
Got to change my, gotta get away, get away, gotta
change my ways!!
Got to change my, gotta get away, get away, gotta
change my ways!!
Gotta get away, got to change...

Hard headed nigga and set in my ways,

but I can reminisce of iller days, wild child living foul.
You gimme 3 feet or I get hostile, all for self and not for all
yo, one of these days I was bound to take a fall.
I realized that I couldn't get away.
I guess I'll die in my fucked up ways,
in my fucked up ways,
in my fucked up ways.

Parental prison cruel decision for no reason all because I am not pleasing.
What the fuck you want me to do?
No love.
All you do is just shove money, lies,

it shouldn't be no suprise that I am real and you have to deal with my ways.
Shifty in many ways, no charades.
Momma and daddy treat me a better way.

Got to change my, gotta get away, get away, gotta
change my ways!!
Got to change my, gotta get away, get away, gotta
change my ways!!
Got to change my, gotta get away, get away, gotta
change my ways!!
Got to change my, gotta get away, get away, gotta
change my ways!!
Gotta get away, gotta change...
