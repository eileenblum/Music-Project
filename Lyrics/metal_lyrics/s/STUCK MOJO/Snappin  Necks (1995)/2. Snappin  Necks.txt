It's not about being real, but being smart.
I guess you do anything to top the charts.
You don't write shit, not even a lick.
You got the nerve to get mad when people
pick on your lack of skills that pay your bills.
You better wake up motherfucker you know the deal.
All copyrights goto those who write,

but all you can do is mimic to the bright lights.

You get hip, you know the rules.
You better learn how to do something you damn fool.
Instead of trying to be down everybody around you
need to originate your own damn sound.

Our opinionated facts yeh we had ta...
The mojo snappin' necksssss!!!

Snap of the neck

The mojo had to wreck!

No sellout!!!
I thought was the pledge.
It looks like other artists have shed the true to see more green,
but they fail to realize that they are breeding more GREED,
a pussy motherfucker punks out at the first chance fake prestige and clout.
The P.O.P. artist sham we do give a damn.
It's time a new voice took the stand.
Weak ass suckers on the scene always get the big bright lights and all the gleam.
They won two Grammy's in your dream then you woke up to find out it was just a scheme. $$$$$$
