As Sir Nose, he said he'll never swim,

but he got Stuck in the Mojo deep end

enough that back to the track to let you know where the mind is at...

Power, yeh we want it all, 'hos, might cause your downfall.
Friends, we don't have many, enemies plenty.
Suckers, stay out of our way.
Why?, Because you might get played.

Can't have my cake and eat it too?
Well who are you to judge the Mojo Crew?

Non stop we're going to the top, we're getting props like crooked cops!!!

 Can't have my cake and eat it too?
Well who are you to judge the Mojo Crew?
Sick of the pie in the sky and we're gonna let you know the reason why.

Bread and water will make the average brother weak,
I wanna eat cake and let the big dog eat.
That religion will make the brother weak,

I wanna eat cake so let the big dog eat.
Government cheese will make a brother weak,
I wanna eat cake and let the big dog eat.
