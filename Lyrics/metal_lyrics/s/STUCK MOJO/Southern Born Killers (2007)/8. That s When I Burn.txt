[Music: Ward, Lyrics: Nelson / Ward]

You can't save me cause my souls on fire
Burn burn blaze blaze flames getting higher
The grim reaper's coming I can here the church choir
Time to pay the piper for my past desires
Attitude shitty just a fucking liar
The hoods of the world kept me so inspired
The players of the world yo I so admired
Running through groupies like them NASCAR drivers

And when that sun goes down on me
That's when I burn
You can't save me cause my soul's on fire
Dragging me down while the flames get higher
And without you I start to bleed
That's when I burn
You can't save me cause my soul's on fire
Dragging me down while the flames get higher

As my sun sets yo I'm wet with sweat
My spirit filled with regret as I sit and reflect
On the man that I was and the man I became
Running plots schemes and capers for the fortune and fame
Hotter than the devil sitting on the sun
I'm a straight up heathen Hell here I come
Nothing left for me but the Lucifer dance
On my knees pleading God give me one more chance
