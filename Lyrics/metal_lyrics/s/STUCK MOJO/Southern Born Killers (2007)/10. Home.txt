[Music: Ward, Lyrics: Nelson / Ward / Archie]

Nothing can compare to the feeling
I get when I'm up on stage
I feel right at home
Like I'm lounging on my sofa man
And every single fan is my best of friends
I swear I can float and fly
And touch the sky
My spirit soars so damn high
So high that if I drop
I could only fall on top
I'm zoning
My state of mind is heaven
Open like 24-7 when the mic's in my hand
Please understand no matter where I roam
When I'm on stage I feel right at home

And I'm at home
And I'm at home when I'm with you

Home is where the heart is
And our hearts are with you
Every single time that we perform

We gotta do our part kids
Rock and roll and roll and rock ya

From the night to morn
This music is a treasure
What a pleasure
To vibe with you and you and you and you
It couldn't get no better
Than when we run on stage and hear the cheers
Getting love from who
The first to the last row
Having a blast bro
How we locking it down
Shorties first to the last row
Shaking they ass yo
Loving how we rock the town
Home

And I'm at home
And I'm at home when I'm with you
Your inspiration gets me through
And I'm at home when I'm with you
And I'm alone without you

I'm at home in front of ten or ten thousand
Whether you're rich or public housing
Every place I go feels like home
Cause every night you all Got it going on

And now that we've come this far
I'll never turn my back on what brought me here
And it's been so long
That I could never thank you enough

And I'm at home
