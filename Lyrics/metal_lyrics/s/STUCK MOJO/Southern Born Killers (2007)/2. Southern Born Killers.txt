[Music: Ward, Lyrics: Nelson / Ward]

A southern born killer am I
I represent the dirty south boy
Till the day I die
Those stereotypes of country hicks we kill-'em
Our swagger and slang the thing they lovin' and feelin'
A style that's so appealing to the masses
Got the whole world crunk and shaking their asses
Why, ain't no need to ask this
Trace your roots and you'll see
A southern born killer just like me
Who was born for this
Sworn to this
Can't be torn from this
Down south spirit I love
Embrace and hug
My 9 to 5 cats to them ballers and thugs
To them shorties with them sexy hips
Luscious lips
Raised on nothing but bacon eggs and grits
Hot girls show the shit
Some straight up thrillers
Southern born killers

Top billa, Alabama thriller
I'm a southern born killer
The for real
The original dirty south show stealer
I'm an ego killer
A Bible belt thriller
I'm a southern born killer
Come and get a feeler of the one and only Southern born killer

I'm an SBK
Everyday all day and day
No other way for me
Wet from the sweat of my forefathers legacies
Blessed with memories that paved the way for the artists we hear today
Influenced by Southern Rock and Roll
R and B and Soul
Hip Hop heavens to Soundgardens
Bringing better smiles like braces to all your faces
No matter the places or races
Home run hitting the charts
Touching all of the bases
From clean cut cats to cats catching cases
Everyday we hustling on them paper chases
Like a tattoo it's hard to erase us
Damn it you can't replace us
Take a mental picture and trace us
True top billas, Fantasy fulfillas
Southern Born Killers
This is a Southern rock and rollabration
Soulabration, hip hop mash-up smash creation
Banging the heads of every fucking persuasion
Blacks and Whites man Latino and Asians
Engaging in conversation
This Southern Born Killer Nation
Is off the rip equipped not stripped
We spit like major leaguers
And leave the crowd eager
For more, more, more
Southern born for life until they church me
Bible verse me and dirt me
It will always be my home
Even when my spirit's gone
I'm southern born
