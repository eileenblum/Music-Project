[Music: Ward, Lyrics: Nelson / Ward]

I'm an American related to all colors of brethren
Priests and Pastors and Prophets and Reverends
Divided we fall united we stand together man
In this cultural melting pot there's nothing better than
This land of the free and the home of the brave
Populated by ancestors of immigrants and slaves who met early graves
So we could see brighter days and we could proudly
Praise and raise the stars and stripes as Americans

Hate me
Blame me
You can't shame me
Come and stand with me
I'm American

I'm an American born in these states united
Where racial discrimination keeps us so divided
But we've got free speech so I won't be quiet
We got a lot of problems here man I won't deny it
But ain't another place that I'd rather be
Than in this land of great opportunity
Where we can be anything that we wanna be
So until the day I D-I-E, I stand tall as an American
