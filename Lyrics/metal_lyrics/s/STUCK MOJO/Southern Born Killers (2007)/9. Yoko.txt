[Music: Ward, Lyrics: Ward / Nelson]

I ain't trying to feel no Yoko Ono
Remember how you met me geeked at my show yo
Front row flashy Sexy sassy Nasty classy
Backstage pass me
Stopped and asked me
Yo what's up
Wanna cut
That's what's up
Body bumping bangin' blazin'
Hair did nails did, looking amazing
Back to the hotel for a fling
Turned into a weekly thing
Now your my girl and wear my ring
Your my queen and I'm your King
Then you started acting strange
Trying to change and rearrange
Trippin' when I did my shows
Just another Yoko
No!
When I was younger
Somebody told me the story
Of a man who left the world's greatest band for his girlie
It happens everyday and not to just musicians
It gets doctors and lawyers, athletes and magicians
Some will make the same mistake
And most of you will never learn
Maybe even watch everything you love burn
So learn from John Lennon
And don't be such a wussy
And give it all away
For that Yoko Ono pussy

You're my Yoko Ono
My Cher to Sonny Bono

Damn girl
Have some self respect
You know it's hard to find a band guy
That you haven't slept with
You love it when other girls are jealous of you
But that drummer that you're with
Was with her last time he came through
Now you're hoping that one day on stage he'll propose
But why would he marry you
You slept with everyone he knows
You'd like to be my Yoko Ono
Never again will I go down that road
