[Music: Ward, Lyrics: Aborn / Nelson]
[String Arrangement: Eric Frampton]

I speak peace when peace is spoken
But I speak war when your hate is provoking
The season is open 24-7-365
Man up yo time to ride
No need to hide behind slogans of deceit
Claiming that you're a religion of peace
We just don't believe you
We can clearly see through
The madness that you're feeding your people
Jihad the cry of your unholy war
Using the willing, the weak and poor
From birth drowning in propaganda, rhetoric and slander
All we can say is damn ya

My forefathers fought and died for this here
I'm stronger than your war of fear
Are we clear?
If you step in my hood
It's understood
It's open season

I don't need a faith that's blind
Where death and hate bring me peace of mind
With views that are stuck deep in the seventh century
So much sand in your eyes to blind to see
The venom that you leaders preach
Is the path to your own destruction
Your own demise
You might say that I don't understand but your disgust for me is what I realize

Surprise!
Your homicidal ways has got the whole world watching
Whole world scoping
So if you bring it to my home base
Best believe it
The season's open
I see you
Hell yeah I see you
Motherfucker now
I don't wanna be you
If you come to my place
I'll drop more than just some bass
Yo you'll get a taste of a
Sick motherfucker from the Dirty
I ain't worrying not a fucking bit
I'm telescoping like Hubble
Yo you in trouble
Yo on the double
I'm wild with mine
Bring that style with mine
Fuck with my family I'll end your life
Just the way it is
Just the way it be
Do you understand?
No matter if you're woman or man, or child
My profile is crazy
That shit you do doesn't amaze me
I'm ready to blaze thee
I don't give a damn what god you claim
I've seen the innocent that you've slain
On my streets you're just fair game
Like a pig walk to your slaughter
The heat here is so much hotter
And my views won't teeter totter or fluctuate
Step to me you just met your fate
And I'll annihilate
With the skill of a Shogun assassin
Slicing and dicing precise with a passion
In any shape form or fashion
Bring it to my home
Welcome to the danger zone
Cause your attitude's the reason
The triggers keep squeezing
The hunt is on and it's open season
It's Open Season
