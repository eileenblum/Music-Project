So you're leaving me out of your reindeer games 'cause
don't have quite enough fame.
Lame your excuse, here take the noose, no use, no
spine,
Your trickin' everytime tipping around those thoughts
that are really on your mind,
But we got that cookie cutter going on.
Green machine stealing your dreams, selling yourself
short to grab the quick cream.

Rebelling and yelling but really who is the machine,
Not part of your scene or buying into your routine.

Trick!
I won't be tricked again.
Trick!
I won't be tricked again.
No.
Trick!
I won't be tricked again.
Trick!
I won't be tricked again!

Let me see.
Conspiracy you step to me then challenge I manage
to separate the facts from emotion,
I get the notion you got a dose of the potion.
In the backseat of the pimpmobile u adapted your
style for mass appeal,
Sign your name and let's close the deal.
Like Ned Flanders' running hell, excuse me while
I curse the fools you failed!

Rebelling and yelling but really who is the machine,
Not part of your scene or buying into your routine.

Trick!
I won't be tricked again.
Trick!
I won't be tricked again.
No.
Trick!
I won't be tricked again.
Trick!
I won't be tricked again!

Rebelling and yelling but really who is the machine,
Not part of your scene or buying into your routine.

Trick!
I won't be tricked again.
Trick!
I won't be tricked again.
No.
Trick!
I won't be tricked again.
Trick!
I won't be tricked again!
