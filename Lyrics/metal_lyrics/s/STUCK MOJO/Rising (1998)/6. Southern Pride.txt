South of the Mason-Dixon finger-lickin' good
Welcome to my neighborhood
Congeniality, hostpitality go hand in hand,
But don't dis a Southerner, we're quick to take a
stand.
The South will rise again already there Olympic City,
'96 was our year.
The weather's swell, on racism we won't dwell
'Cause everything north of us they won't tell.

I've got that Southern pride.
I've got that Southern pride.
Shine my Southern pride let it shine.
I've got that Southern pride.
I've got that Southern pride.
Shine my Southern pride let it shine.

We have an L.A. east of the Mississippi,
Lower Alabama, we're from Atlanta.
The Carolinas, there's a no coast finer than our
coast,
You know the South rocks the most.
We love wrestling and NASCAR, too.
People down here make mean barbecue.
From Freaknik to Bike Week my religion is unique,
My Southern belles like honeysuckle.

I've got that Southern pride.
I've got that Southern pride.
Shine my Southern pride let it shine.
I've got that Southern pride.
I've got that Southern pride.
Shine my Southern pride let it shine.
