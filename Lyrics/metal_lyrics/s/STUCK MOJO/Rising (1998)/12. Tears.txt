All that money there shouldn't be no tears, dry your
eyes sfter so many tries.
Celebrity status you're the saddest, wasn't that
O.J. case one of the maddest?!
Fallen stars disregard, some lead by example, others
go too far.
Until behind bars was in the realm of untouchables
but you got touched now shut up!

There's only so many, there's only so many, there's
only so many tears that you can cry.

Bang bang biggie Tupac the bully master scheme
Design buy a higher being cry and whine, but nobody's
dropping.
Dime feel no sorrow cause they knew they weren't
promised tomorrow
Propaganda wrecking you like Panzers
But like the desert fox you can be destroyed.
Sneaking up on you like the Trojans did Troy.
We couldn't trust Marv like the barber named Floyed?!

There's only so many, there's only so many, there's
only so many tears that you can cry.
Cry baby cry, dry your lying eyes
Cry baby cry, with every tear I fear
Cry baby cry, what a nice try
Cry baby cry, what's that in your eye?
A lie formulating, you've been busted this time!

There's only so many, there's only so many, there's
only so many tears that you can cry.
