I'm another coward on a pointless mission hometown
militia.
The silent majority just got louder
No good with words just a fuse and powder.
Justified homicide in my eyes human cost gets my
point across.
Few as we are numbers increasing cleaning the streets
vigilants policing!

I'm misguided and weak-minded,
I've got a timer and a pound of C-4.
I sentence you to death, eventhough we never met
I got the Ryder truck loaded.
In the name of liberty there's always casualties
...loading, exploding,
I'm a coward with a pipebomb

Coward!! Coward!! Hey!! Hey!!
Coward!! Coward!! Hey!! Hey!!

Fear breeds ignorance and then hate
I feel I'm god so I decide your fate.
168 1st degree of murder not one scream I heard of.
Atlanta my test site city, I turn to the 12-man comittee.
What's the proper punishment for me suffering or
the death penalty!!

I'm misguided and weak-minded,
I've got a timer and a pound of C-4.
I sentence you to death, eventhough we never met
I got the Ryder truck loaded.
In the name of liberty there's always casualties
...loading, exploding,
I'm a coward with a pipebomb

Coward!! Coward!! Hey!! Hey!!
Coward!! Coward!! Hey!! Hey!!

I've already seen it,
I've seen myself dying.
I damn all the innocent 'cause I've already killed
them

I'm misguided and weak-minded,
I've got a timer and a pound of C-4.
I sentence you to death, eventhough we never met
I got the Ryder truck loaded.
In the name of liberty there's always casualties
...loading, exploding,
I'm a coward with a pipebomb

Coward!! Coward!! Hey!! Hey!!
Coward!! Coward!! Hey!! Hey!!
