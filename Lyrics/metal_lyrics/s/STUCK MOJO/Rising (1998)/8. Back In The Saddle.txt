No trust, love sux, hard work, false words,
Hard crushed, boo hoo, who jerked who?
Broke my heart, fell apart, but like Steve Austin,
Bigger and better now.
No longer a fool, don't think that it's cool,
Fucking with jezebels, naw wedding bells.
I tell the trooper don't let her scoop ya, she's
bound to dupe ya
Then I got my teflon vest on baby.
No more trick ass ho's driving me crazy.
I cleared my vision,
I'm focoused and locked
get off my jock
you used to clown
you knocked me down but I'm...

Back in the saddle.
You knocked me down but I'm...
Back in the saddle.
You knocked me down but I'm...
Back in the saddle.
You knocked me down but I'm...
Back in the saddle.

Lonley woman, seeking passion,
Sex over, psycho drama,
Hard crushed, boo hoo, who jerked who?
Like wild men I'm gonna rebound and I'm clowning
you stupid wench,
Making me sick, you're in my mix, you need to fix
your whole personality casualties,
Causing fatalities, the rate gets high.
I pull the switch on your silly sadilly ass and all
you players taking notes,
We're teaching class.
Used and abused, hope you don't lose,
Emotionally clowned, you knocked me down but I'm...

Back in the saddle.
You knocked me down but I'm...
Back in the saddle.
You knocked me down but I'm...
Back in the saddle.
You knocked me down but I'm...
Back in the saddle.

Here stand alone, don't need another clone,
Check out the aftermath of my broken path.
Still you do not see how fragile I may be,
Instead you want to play games and get into my head
Here stand alone, don't need another clone,
Check out the aftermath of my broken path.
Still you do not see how fragile I may be,
Instead you want to play games and get into my head

You knocked me down but I'm...
Back in the saddle.
You knocked me down but I'm...
Back in the saddle.
You knocked me down but I'm...
Back in the saddle.
You knocked me down but I'm...
Back in the saddle.
