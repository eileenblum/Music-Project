Why you wanna step to me my C-I-S
Brothers don't play you got a lot to say when you
with your boys on the other side of town
I catch you 1-on1 and yo ass is beat down.
I see you styling highly profile.
Try to play that thug role you're head is swole
Now you want to be all that you can be,
But not by the colors of the army!
Yo you in the wrong hood better knock on wood
Gold chains and gold rings you misunderstood
Trace back and look back you ain't black
Nigga straight sneaking through the cracks.

Who's that wigga in my neighborhood,
In my neighborhood...
In my neighborhood...

Mr. Trailblazer, with the mad flavor
Look out ya'll the suburban ranger
Suburban ranger danger danger
Suburban ranger danger danger
Suburban ranger danger danger
Suburban ranger danger danger

Mr. Mirror image you wanna scrimmage
Why when your goof troop ass look like Grimace.
In your altered state fake mistakes
Take a look in the mirror and tell me why you imitate!
Slap that mutha for not being himself
Chemical imbalance coming from the wealth.
Don't try to be like and sip herbal tea like
And come to my crib run your jibs and ad lib.
Urban cross-dressing language molesting
Here's a suggestion time for a confession.
I never liked you I still want to fight you
K.O. 1st round lights out troop.

Who's that wigga in my neighborhood,
In my neighborhood...
In my neighborhood...

Mr. Trailblazer, with the mad flavor
Look out ya'll the suburban ranger
Suburban ranger danger danger
Suburban ranger danger danger
Suburban ranger danger danger
Suburban ranger danger danger

Circles in a square bite that ass like bees!!
Your image is deceiving I ain't believing
You trying act like me for no reason.
Change your game your rhymes off season mess with

False advertisement strike a pose for the no-style
trophy.

For your whole made up style you owe me.
