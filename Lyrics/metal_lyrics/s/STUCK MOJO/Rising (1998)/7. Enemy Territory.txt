We're globetrotters only smoking guns are hotter
Stick in the Mojo you scream and holler
Better tap out before we break that collar
Rules out the window like N.W.O.
Imagine this Indian reservation
You trust total annihilation
Scalping that ass from head to toe
Hanging the carcass up after every show

All I see is red
A 90-minute homicidal rage
All I see is read
We enage in acts of rampage.
All I see is red
A 90-minute homicidal rage
All I see is read
We enage in acts of rampage.

Take my rage
Go and setup your head (?)
Take my rage
Go and setup your head (?)

You're my best friend before we enter the stage
Hear the first note note bust like a 12-gauge.
Yo listen we are on a different mission you think
we're in.
You think we're a standing competition
Mr. Estate is down with first circle
Break full time and ????????
Step on the ??? for the ???????
Break ya off somethin' like Evander Holyfield!

All I see is red
A 90-minute homicidal rage
All I see is read
When I enter the stage we enage in acts of rampage.
All I see is red
A 90-minute homicidal rage
All I see is read
We enage in acts of rampage.

Take my rage
Go and setup your head (?)
Take my rage
Go and setup your head (?)

All I see is red
When I enter the stage a 30-minute homicidal rage
All I see is read
When I enter the stage we enage in acts of rampage.
All I see is red
30-minute homicidal rage
All I see is read
We enage in acts of rampage.
