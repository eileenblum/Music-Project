I am the rock star, I am the icon, long-haired, tattoo,
freak of the weak.
I am the rock star, I am the icon, long-haired, tattoo,
freak of the weak.
Tell me what I am supposed to do?
Keep believing while you're underachieving!
Busting my cookies, treating me like a rookie
I'll be damned if I don't take a stand.

You can't hear what I hear,
Those distant boos and faint cheers.
You can't see what I see,
So tell me why do you decieve?

Keep my head dry.
I'm gonna keep my head dry.
When the blood begins to rise,
I'm gonna keep my head dry.

Rah rah sis boom bah
Green eggs and ham, blah blah blah.
You're mouth can't run with a broken jaw.
Rah rah sis boom bah
You got me caught up in the name game.
Why?
Cause the competition is lame.
Liar, liar, pants on fire, creating schemes
to destroy my team.

You can't hear what I hear,
Those distant boos and faint cheers.
You can't see what I see,
So tell me why do you decieve?

Keep my head dry.
I'm gonna keep my head dry.
When the blood begins to rise,
I'm gonna keep my head dry.

I feel like the number one draft pick
In the league of silver tounge tactics.
The wet willy all in my ear,
We keep sandbagging trying to stay clear.
Been sentenced to do it yourself,
Working hard to keep the product on the self,
But you wanna flood my brain cells with bad news,
Who's who and what you think is cool.

Keep my head dry.
I'm gonna keep my head dry.
When the blood begins to rise,
I'm gonna keep my head dry.
When the blood begins to rise,
I'm gonna keep my head dry.
