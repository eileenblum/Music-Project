Circling a face a favorite fanzine talking shit as
I load the magazines.
.30-.30 is oiled and ready blunted so you know the
nervers are steady.
Got a backstage pass all access packin' a gat where
it's strapped you can't guess.
Slippin' a mickey to the crew and security aiming
the red dot at the targets nine spot.

I got you in my cross hairs, the situation ain't
fair!
I sent you all warning notes, but to the press it
was a joke.
The situation ain't fair, I got you in my cross hairs!
You all make me sick, hold still while the gun goes
click.

City to city I'm stalking you but you think I'm following
the group.
I'm a groupie that you can trust as I mount C-4 under
the bus.
Cianide in your rider fruit snuck the blow gun darts
by the black suits.
Booby trapped the stage.  The crowd will be
dazed when you go POP in a big ole blaze!

I got you in my cross hairs, the situation ain't
fair!
I sent you all warning notes, but to the press it
was a joke.
The situation ain't fair, I got you in my cross hairs!
You all make me sick, hold still while the gun goes
click.

Oh shit, I've been shot, I'm about to go into shock.
Yo, tell me what I am supposed to do,
When I sold my soul I thought I paid my dues.
Yo, listen, I don't want to die.
How much to live this time?
Out the barrel in my mouth, no I won't.
No.
No, Please Please Don't!!!!!!!

I got you in my cross hairs, the situation ain't
fair!
I sent you all warning notes, but to the press it
was a joke.
The situation ain't fair, I got you in my cross hairs!
You all make me sick, hold still while the gun goes
click.
