Warm-blooded, god-fearing and I bleed red. Primal Instinctive like my meat dead!
Who's not a sinner oh what a winner suffering my gut 'cause I'm greedy as @%#.

Animal!

Nocturnal.
Savage my heart's cold.
Trash mouth, ill-tempered and you know I'm bold!
Who's not a sinner oh what a winner suffering my gut 'cause I'm greedy as @%#.

Animal!

Out of my mind, losing my soul the natural beast has taken control.
Will I kill or be killed?
Animals prey on the weak in order to live.
I'm surviving and I thrive of the scent of scare that is in the air.
I do want to do.
Does that make me an animal to you?

Animals ~ Just like you and me.
Animals ~ Surviving to be free.
Animals ~ Blood thirsty human being.
Animals ~ Can you cage the Beast!?!

Womanizing.
Chauvinist I lick clits.
Drinking fools straight up pagan I'm a sexist.
Who's not a sinner oh what a winner suffering my gut 'cause I'm greedy as @%#.

Animal!
