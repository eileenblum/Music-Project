Cutting back to civil rights they wanna tell what's wrong what's right.
Take ten steps turn around and blast how long will the right to bear arms last?
The right to assemble a crew, the wrong to vote the wrong way and everything's through.
Back to the hangers in the alley we roll up and shoot up your fucking rally!
I want my right to smoke herb but the main is paid so that thought is wild and absurd.
Dismiss them the whole fucking system but in the meantime

I wish those crazy bald heads would fucking die, but they multiply.

Oh say can't see - everything in the world ain't what it seems.
Little boys and girls educated yourself.
Grab your AK-44 Cal. off the top shelf.

Only the strong survive ~ my gun control is a steady hand.
Only the strong survive ~ arm yourself and people take a stand.
Only the strong survive ~ my gun control is a steady hand.

House of Representatives needs a sedative.
They're driving the middleman out of his residence.
But you're still hesitant to fight for your rights.
Twelve-ounce curls, then you fuss and you gripe.
You say, "Why vote?"
There's no hope.
Too many people died so they can't revoke my freedom of speech.
It's time to reach.
Each one, teach one.
Time to release the fury and the pain.
All my life I've been a slave.
You can't hold me down, I refuse to be broken.

Oh say can't see - everything in the world ain't what it seems.
Little boys and girls educated yourself.
Grab your AK-44 Cal. off the top shelf.

Only the strong survive ~ my gun control is a steady hand.
Only the strong survive ~ arm yourself and people take a stand.
Only the strong survive ~ my gun control is a steady hand.

Liberal social policy leads to a society of people who depend on
government and as government gains that power over the people you
will lose your rights and freedom that our forefathers
fought and died for, so love it or leave it.
If you want my gun come and get it.
