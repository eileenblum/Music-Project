Youth of today aren't happy and gay, hostile, volatile only concerned with style.
Home alone so they act grown.
Who's the baby-sitter since your parents were the damn quitters!
Rap city in the place to be suburbanite into a ghetto-knight.
What's the cost of my generation being lost?
A clue less mom and dad tell me who's the boss.

Poor parental skills ~ that's the deal now you know the real.
Poor parental skills ~ You cannot deal that's the real.

Down, down breeding.

Single-parent raised in the bosom of ghetto.
Affecting middle-class and the rich growing up half-ass life's a bitch.
No guidance so you ride to the end.
You wonder why the streets are their best friend,

couldn't tell you nothing about school, but they can show you how to
roll a joint and shoot pool.
Love from that one parent would have been cool.

Poor parental skills ~ that's the deal now you know the real.
Poor parental skills ~ You cannot deal that's the real.

Down, down breeding.

No morals, no couth, no manners and running with a foul crew.
Thought you knew everything about your son,

it was not dad who showed him how to use a gun.
S-E-X was last on mama's list.
Now she's confused about kissing and sucking dick.
Down breed until they're misled must be nothing left after being breast-fed!!!!!!!

Poor parental skills ~ that's the deal now you know the real.
Poor parental skills ~ You cannot deal that's the real.

Down, down breeding.
