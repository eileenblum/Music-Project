Brothers and sisters, we live in a troubled time.
We live in a time when lack of ability and talent is mistaken for genius.
When jumping on the bandwagon is considered originality.
Ahh, we live in a time when a world intended, much needed musical revolution
has been weakened, perverted, polluted, until it is no more than a hideous
fashion show.
A fashion show that began as a rebellion itself against corporate mainstream,
yet today it finds itself to be the very mainstream that it claimed to be

alternative to.
While the bands who would before criticize arena rock stars now find

themselves arena rock stars!

What was once the antidote has now become the poison.
The cure has become the disease.
Ahh, let the church sing.

Amen!!
(Congregation: Amen!!)
