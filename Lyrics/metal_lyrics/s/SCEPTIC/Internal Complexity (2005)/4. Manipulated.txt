Incessant prospecting about fantasizing of the others
Taken from the almighty one - the only thing he bothers
Related to unimportant dreams -- one of them is free will
Thinking of what we wish to and simply turn it into real

Manipulated -- we realized our lives are totally crashed
Mindless fleshes that cannot think -- internally smashed
Became one of them -- rusted, waited for the final command
Corrosion filled our veins with immense pressure -- it's the end

Depriving of common sense is just a sample
How humans can be controlled - for example

Inhabitants of the outer world use it in a different way
Guiding our senses they are forcing us to go or stay
Changing thoughts into countless words we do not understand
We are a mean marionettes - our knees are gonna bend

Modified brain waves -- for their own satisfaction
Manipulation causing complete mind destruction

All time we are wondering -- aren't we suppose to be dead
For not listening - executing all those things ordered instead
They lead us and we follow -- falling straight into the hollow
Being puppets steered from above -- taking well-earned punishment
