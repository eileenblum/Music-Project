Lost in the world of unusual occurrences
Searching for a time of differences
Anonymous creature of divine condemnation
Follows the path of countless destination

[Chorus]
Who dictates conditions of our existence
Is it beyond us or we can keep control
We release ourselves with our resistance
Trying to stop the being that is unstoppable

[Chorus 2]
His knowledge sow fear and terror
Unable to resist is our own interior

[Chorus 3]
Through years gathering wisdom
About human environment
Knowledge about how much more
Time we have to spend
'yet

Instinct showed him a direction of endeavor
Person who perfectly control it's own behavior
Recovered powers to realize his dreams
Took possession over the knowledge streams

[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat chorus 2]
[Repeat chorus 3]
