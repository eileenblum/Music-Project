[Chorus]
Crawling as a snake, moving as silently as he can
There's no sign of breathing, doesn't have a scent
Never seen by anyone, his constant shape's unknown
Perfect assassin - fights and kills on it's own

[Chorus 2]
Most of them think it isn't so fast and strong
Don't really know how much they're wrong

Years of evolution made him unseizable
Shapeless Entity - untouchable, invisible
Created with the only purpose - seek and destroy
Killing, thrilling, crushing, slaughtering

Awaits and attacks - then you feel his breath
Realize what's inevitable - immediate death
It comes from the source as old as his creator
Built of flesh and blood, living monster - annihilator

Horrifying being, invisible for humans at night or day
Disguise, penetrating surroundings - searching for prey
Prepared to fight much better, then we are
Nobody knows his real abilities so far

[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat chorus 2]

Cannot find the way to kill - its indestructible
Shapeless Entity - inviolable, undetectable
Created with the only purpose - seek and destroy
Killing, thrilling, crushing, slaughtering - Death Machine

Shapeless Entity!
Death Machine!
