The voices from your mind appear to be
Showing you a difference between
The real truth and lie's reality
Purest essence of surreality

[Chorus]
Forever trapped in most twisted thoughts
Your vegetating mind has changed a lot
Sub consciously it reads this spiteful script
Feel forceless within - it's his keeper's grip

[Chorus 2]
It seems that someone has opened your eyes
For the corrupted world filled with denies
It is the book you're not supposed to read
Filled with scar of time - The Unbeliever's Script

It includes all these blasphemous sentences
The most terrifying writings - evil's prophecies
These words are much too harsh for you
They come to your ears but cannot pass through

[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat chorus 2]
