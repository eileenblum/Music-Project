Feel this pain , it strikes you once again
Taking control of your - mind
Crying for help , whispering prayers
You are so weak and helpless 

[chorus]
We who ruled the waters , the earth and sky
Are now to be destroyed (disappear without a sign)
Why important no more is our will to be
Isn't it our own ingenuity to create our destiny 

[Solo: Jacek]

Don't we deserve a better way to die 

And where is God , his miracles when needed
Your faith appears and disappears
When it becomes uncomfortable
No more to say 

[repeat chorus]
