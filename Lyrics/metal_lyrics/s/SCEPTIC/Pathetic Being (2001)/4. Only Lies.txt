Concerning the senses as major fault
Of existing in almost unreal world
Cannot find your place in a queue
Never know what's false or what is true
Queue created by your own catastrophic ideas
That tell you - There are only lies 

[chorus]
Nothing's as it may seem
In reality filled with deja vu 

[chorus 2]
Searching for the meaning of truth
Makes you unable to do anything more
Than speculating what's real and what is not
What does your common sense suggest you
If there's something optimistic in your pessimistic eyes 

[Solo: Jacek]
[Solo: Czesiek]

Trying to find the realm you cannot see
Thoughts that are not what they should be
Fighting with fear that drills your mind
Creating disease - cure can't be find 
Forlorn form of sub consciousness itself
Reminds you - There is no truth 

[repeat chorus]

There are only lies!
