[Hiro]

On the rough sea of colourless thoughts
My blind existence will die
With no target on the way to death
Time's taken away
Here comes my day

[Chorus]
Happiness is lie
We all have to die

[Chorus 2]
What power gives you right
To decide who will live and who will die
What right gives you power
To execute God's verdicts

Fear fills my body from inside
It won't let me live longer
I'll see the face of death in no time
Death appears in my fear

[Lead guitar-Jacek]

My emotions are hidden in my eyes
Death is part of the reality
Soon it will come and take me away
To the place which I don't want to see

[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat chorus 2]
