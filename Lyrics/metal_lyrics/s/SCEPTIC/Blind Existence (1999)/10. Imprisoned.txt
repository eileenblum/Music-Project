[Hiro, ZiÄba]

[Chorus]
Our privacy is subdued
By new generation's mode being
We are impaled to do what they do
We are impaled to think what they think
World's full of immunes and immortals
Who spread their knowledge they haven't got

[Lead guitar]

[Lead bass]

We're afraid of our thoughts
'Cause our minds are destroyed
We live in the world of endless emptiness
Of endless emptiness

[Repeat chorus]

We live in the world of schizoidal disease
Directed by an intelectual sense
We don't possess a knowledge
About borning nor about future of our existence
Imprisoned!
