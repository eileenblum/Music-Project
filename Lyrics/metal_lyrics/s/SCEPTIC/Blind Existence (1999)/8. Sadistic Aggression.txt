[Chanek]

Brutal life truth
This is always real
Tears of sadness
Signs the road to vanity

[Chorus]
Sadistic aggression
Is last step to madness
Just death!

Sadistic aggression
We'll die without dignity
Just death!

Sadistic aggression
Is last step to madness
Sadistic aggression
We'll die without dignity

Sadist maniacs on the streets
Screaming people in agony
There's no mercy for the weak
Taking harvest blood machine

[Repeat chorus]
