[MroÅ¼ek, Hiro]

Lost among chaos of thoughts
I can't find my way
The way which leads to interior of life
To interior of endless pain

[Chorus]
My mind can't make the right decision
I'm dying with broken heart
I'm flying away from reality
And I don't know If I will come back

[Lead guitar-Jacek]

[Lead bass]

You're entrapped by senseless temptations
Think before you decide
Think - it could be a rescue
In interior of life
All what I've done passed away
I want to mend it but I can't
All what I've left is damned remembrance
Which destroys me all from within

[Repeat chorus]
