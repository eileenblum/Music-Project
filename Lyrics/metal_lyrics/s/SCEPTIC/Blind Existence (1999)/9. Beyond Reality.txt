[Hiro]

Going through life
The sad way of being
There's nothing that counts
Beside material things
No spiritual faith
Which could make your life

[Chorus]
Stupid superstition makes your actions useless
Rage against the God turns your feelings of

[Chorus 2]
You live beyond reality
In the world of egoistic ideas
You sacrificed your innocence
For mortal things

[Lead bass]

[Lead guitar-Jacek]

You see wealth door
You think you don't need more
Yet there's thing that you need
But you will never get it
It's comprehension in which
You could drown tears of sadful life

[Repeat chorus]

[Repeat chorus 2]

[Lead guitar-Jacek]
