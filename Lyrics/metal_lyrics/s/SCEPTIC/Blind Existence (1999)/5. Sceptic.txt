[Chanek]

I'm blamed for normal life
I want to get away from shadow and cry
My frozen heart is like a stone
Is like a stone on the depth of lake
Sadness is my normal feeling
Night is a day for me

[Chorus]
I'm slave of a mortal things
Sacrificed to the northern winds
Dark boat of my sceptic life
Is floating away to a paradise

[Repeat chorus]

[Lead bass]

I talk to myself
I think about the end
Death is my only friend
Evil is my only choice

[Lead guitar-Jacek]

I stand on the edge
I wait for the end
Death's my destination
My way is going to hell
