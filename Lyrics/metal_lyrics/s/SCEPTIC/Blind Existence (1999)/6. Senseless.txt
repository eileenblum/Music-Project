[Hiro]

Search deep inside your mind
For the self control
Without hope trying to find
Yourself in this world
So hard to reveal the truth
About your vanity
There's no chance to change
Your destiny

[Lead guitar-Jacek]

Frozen thoughts are like a curse
Life inflicted you deep wound
Bad conscience doesn't let you speak
You've lost your strength , you're so weak
All your good thoughts are gone away
Nothing will help you with this pain
Your life is poisoned with a grief
Death is the only suffer relief

[Chorus]
Sense of life lost long ago
There's no salvation for your soul
[Repeat chorus 4 times]
