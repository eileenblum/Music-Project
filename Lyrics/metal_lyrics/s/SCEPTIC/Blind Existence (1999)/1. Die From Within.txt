[Hiro]

My mouth speaks your words
Your thoughts in my mind
I dream your dreams
Your cursed form before my eyes
What must I do to get rid of you once and for all

[Chorus]
You're created by my imagination
All my thoughts make no sense
It's beyond my comprehension
It's beyond my endurance

Your activity destroys my mind
Slowly I become like you
Emptiness fills my brain
Body cells are being destroyed

[Lead guitar-Jacek]

[Chorus 2]
I die from within
My eyes in pain still look at your face
My body's dead but brain contacts thoughts 
I can't get rid of

I dream your dreams
Your cursed form before me
Everytime I close my eyes
I can see your face before them
You're hidden in the shadow of my thoughts
Which are twisted

[Repeat chorus]

[Repeat chorus 2]
