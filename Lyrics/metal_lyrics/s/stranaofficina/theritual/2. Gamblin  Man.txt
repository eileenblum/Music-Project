Pokers and flushes are my only love
I live when the dice start to roll
Win some, lose some
Life is just a game
I live for the thrill of it all

Croupier pay me my due
Freedom is playin' with you
Lady I'm a gamblin' man
No time for lovin' tonight, let me go.

When mornin' comes I'll be home again
Will you still be true
Waiting by your doorstep
Please let me in
Honey whats' wrong with you
A broken heart is the price that you pay
For playin' this lonely game

Snake eyes, snake eyes never slowin' down
Gamblin' my soul tonight
Seven eleven won't stop me comin' on
So just leave me alone

You'll never take, that gamblin' spirit away
Ad if I die it'll still be there
Someone called it must be time for me to go
Another town, another casino

A gamblin' man will never give in
To lose or to win
It don't mean a thing

Snake eyes, snake eyes never slowin' down
Gamblin' my soul tonight
Seven eleven won't stop me comin' on
So just leave me alone

Snake eyes.
