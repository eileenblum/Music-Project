Don't you race with the eagle
If you can't fly
Don't you run through the fire
You might even die
You're always reachin'
For somethin' too high
You were the ones
Who would never obey
To what people say
Whatever they say
Metal brigade

They stare at you
'cause you're not like them
With your bike and your leather
You live your way
If some kid needs you today
Only you will be there
You will be there, not them

Run like the wind and
Don't stop no more
No foolish preachers or moral
Deceivers in your way
You are the ones who fight for today
Only you, you defendin' the faith
Defendin' the faith
Inside your heart
That no one will take.
