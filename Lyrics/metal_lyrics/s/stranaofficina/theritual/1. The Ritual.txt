On this barren hill
On a dark and cold night
When Orion shines to lead the way
Can you hear them too?
Are you one of the chosen few?

They come to give us the word
And they come to give us the truth
They come from so far away

So come join the ritual
Our friends from the stars
So come join the ritual
Come show us the way.

The circle drawn now
For the friends beyond
And your eyes
They burn with the flame
The great ship will land
So take me by the hand
And together we'll walk in the light

They come to take us away
They come to give us the truth
They come for me and you

So join the ritual
So come join the ritual
Can you hear them callin' you
So come join the ritual
Another world to live a better life.
