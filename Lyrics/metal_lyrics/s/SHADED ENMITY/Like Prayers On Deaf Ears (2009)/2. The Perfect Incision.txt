Under silk and veil was the first time i grazed you but 
beauty was not only the thought that pierced my mind 
the darkness of your eyes could kill a queen in her demise 
so i brought you back to hide to be my godless loving whore 
to make a feast of this price would surely break us both 
so i cut you through and through to stuff and use until im dead 
i love you oh so much it hurts then i start to weep 
and i take the hair from your head and wipe my stinging eyes 

Inside her is falling down 
Inside her is splitting, the pain 
and what she said to me echoes for eternity 
Inside her is falling down 
Inside her is splitting, the pain 
and what she said to me 

For inside my hearts desire, total impurity 
and i faked for long it felt so real i cut her fucking throat 
And only god would help til he saw what i had done 
Turned his back spat on me and swore he'd get revenge 
All i have are her and me things i kill for greed 
Not a single seed on natures womb could stop me close to dead 
All my strength i cut precise to save her loving charm 
With every breath she takes all i hear is one 
Is One 

Up upon the hillside i scramble franticly for 
approaching dawn i see so i dig more fervently 
Inside her womb my heart prevails and i cant let it live 
So i cut and scraped till it bled and felt already sore 
In my dream he came to me and touched my boiling eyes 
And i gouged and screamed till he stopped slumber i will bare 
My ears went deaf bled again this time i fucking scoffed 
My skin began to peel my loathing heart did stop
