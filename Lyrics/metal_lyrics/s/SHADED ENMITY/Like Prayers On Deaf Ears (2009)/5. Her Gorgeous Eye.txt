The afternoon was bare
Dream great visions to be then shared

And then in a vision she awoke to me
And i was surprised to see her face was nothing ever there
And what i would give to feel what you
Earth and space with time whittle away at my hand

Dream great dreams before you die
I handed mine away for a senseless piece of hope

I am the bairer of all that is lost
Sweet dreams of hope and grace i bring you not
If by night you havent been spared

I was forgiven of all that i died
Repeat the past youll surely call me tame
If my place wasnt here
I am but to blame

I am the portrait of all that is wrong
Let crashing hell speed and take me through
I wont hope for any but i could still care

I am the sickness of your past heart
She said with a spark in her gorgeous fucking eye
If by night you havent been spared
I am but to blame
