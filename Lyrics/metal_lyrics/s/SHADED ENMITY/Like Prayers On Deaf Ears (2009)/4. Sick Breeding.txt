This time i wait if every hole was mistake i'll bleed for him once again
and relieve my ever aching bones
Footsteps i hate your touch is what i'll sedate oh where's she my lovely gift bearing soul
I'll curl in her arms forget my bodies heart my god i wait wishing every hole wasnt made
I'll kneel before him crush my past of never not knowing a place but this i have been stowing

But we all look the same Sick Breeding
I should have died when he was next to me
But we all look insane Sick Breeding
I should have died glory euphoria

In heart she holds a key of wondrous abode fear not my darling your touched by the angels
With every breath this fool cannot wait, I tried before him his pride would never stay
I'll curl in her arms to anticipate that hand of feeling will repetate
I'll kneel before him crush my past of never not knowing a place but this i ever owe him

But we all look the same Sick Breeding
I should have died when he was next to me
But we all look insane Sick Breeding
I should have died glory euphoria
