And we are the ones with no god 
And we are the ones that said will save us all 
We were lost in this pool of ses 
Oh tasteless greed of our ways 

Why cant i speak any other name 
Our minds were the same but we couldnt stay 
I am sick and they are wrong 
Passing a virus that feeds on the strong 
Why cant i speak any other name 
Our minds were the same but we couldnt stay 
I am sick and they are wrong 
Passing a virus that feeds on the strong 

And we are the ones with no god 
And we are the ones that said will save us all 
We were lost in this pool of ses 
Oh tasteless greed of our ways 

Why cant i speak any other name 
Our minds were the same but we couldnt stay 
I am sick and they are wrong 
Passing a virus that feeds on the strong 
Why cant i speak any other name 
Our minds were the same but we couldnt stay 
I am sick and they are wrong 
Passing a virus that feeds on the strong 

But they say we wont go 
And we are the ones that take the fall
