Where have they gone?
And they were gods

I am bitter full thrown chaos stopped before my mind went far
your a sinner i am god i laughed in front of a thousand eyes
why wont every gust of pain only i take all i hate
i have gone and stepped to far your a sinner i am god
Your all broken im just reaching come full circle my death at hand
I can plead for you help me come to understand
your my idol i cant live stunned in my last regrets
I'll leave you to bask in this warmth of my desire

You always see right through me
You always believe what you see this is me
I take this empty heart i will create what was never believed
Just like prayers on deaf ears, if only i could chase away the sun
I bottle this up inside where is there i can hide?

Where have they gone?
And they were gods

You are half an angel and im left without my disbelief
cutting words like knife blown gone in the air of ever change
This hand alone of my regret will take us there with all haste
I'll die alone just as my soul my thoughts will hear your coming lies
Your all broken im just reaching come full circle my death at hand
I can plead for you help me come to understand
your my idol i cant live stunned in my last regrets
I'll leave you to bask in this warmth of my desire

You always see right through me
You always believe what you see this is me
I take this empty heart i will create what was never believed
Just like prayers on deaf ears, if only i could chase away the sun
I bottle this up inside where is there i can hide?
