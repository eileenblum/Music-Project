And in this place i stay this faint desire of mine 
If every time i fall i curse the ground i walk 
My burden grows coming there 
And in this trek of mine im a fool for fool i win 

In deep consciousness I breathe 
In ever nothingness I heal 

I feel the ways of tomorrow and stay while i sift through these pages of gold 
Pages of zion, not that desire, all over again 

Tell me your mine and i'll hold back all time until all is there 
If its pleasure you want then i'll see what it takes to bring all you in 
Pleasure of desire it keeps in with ire, for you i'll sleep again 
Pleasure of desire, build myself higher over again 

I lie again in waste my body feeds off the rest 
In loneliness i wait to assure im only mate 
Itching eyes that wield rape 
And one from here i stand, im a fool for fool i win 

In deep consciousness I breathe 
In ever nothingness I heal 

I feel the ways of tomorrow and stay while i sift through these pages of gold 
Pages of zion, not that desire, all over again 

Tell me your mine and i'll hold back all time until all is there 
If its pleasure you want then i'll see what it takes to bring all you in 
Pleasure of desire it keeps in with ire, for you i'll sleep again 
Pleasure of desire, build myself higher over again
