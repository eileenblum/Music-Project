Onward with touch, the touch spread too thin, the time is now 
In ugliness and shallow in part will bring me to myself 

It would be a lie to say what my heart feels deep inside 
And if my help came up from above, i will sever my head and spill blood 

Shes broken me, oh why cant i be me? 
All my hope disdains 
My thoughts run to the deepest part of you 

Just a Silence waiting to start 
Feel my mind its yearning for space 
When the rich man gave into the clown 
Speak silence, wait for the crowd 

My tongue burns with the heat of these words i flow free 
All my worst fears they left as my mind became one 

The thought of her skin all over me 
My poison will pierce your mind 
With beauty and hate i create 
In season i'll start wait for me 

Just a Silence waiting to start 
Feel my mind its yearning for space 
When the rich man gave into the clown 
Speak silence or wait for the crowd 

The thought of her skin all over me 
My poison will pierce your mind 
With beauty and hate i create 
In season i'll start wait for me
