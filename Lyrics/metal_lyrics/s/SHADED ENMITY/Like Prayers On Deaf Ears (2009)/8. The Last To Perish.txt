Lead all nation and breathe will all caution 
You'll find yourself amazed caught up in her squalor 
Forget all organ a pre thought notion I'll find a way to use your keep, 
Will not defy your prayers to the saints i once held high 
My judgement fell short of what they predict 

Even we grow stronger 
And i know in my heart i wont go for lost 
The rains of the clouds fell short of silent tear 
Even as i grow weaker 

Forget all my past proceed with all haste 
My half heart soul is stuck in the bottom 
Break yourself off a piece of my last spoil 
Stain yourself wicked blood I will defy your prayers to the saints i once held high
My judgement fell short of what they predict 

Even we grow stronger 
And i know in my heart i wont go for lost 
The rains of the clouds fell short of silent tear 
Even as i grow weaker 

And i called out to all that would hear 
My angel their wings was on their side
