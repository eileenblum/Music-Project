I fall right through the grasp that was said to save us all, and fall 
I must wait for the kill 

The air comes fast as i begin to absorb pain 
My corpse it hits precise 
And his pain was never there 

Lead us 
Amidst the crowd of wandering eyes 
And we'll never 
And we'll never 

I fall right through the grasp that was said to save us all, and fall 
I must wait for the kill 
Just as i leap for you i see the light as i grow close 
It will be the mess that you made 

Giant on earth among the sun 
I lift their heads and save their souls 
I offer breath for a pain that never leaves 
My pain was always there 

And lead us 
And lead us 
And we'll never 
And We'll never see the light of day 
Never 
And we'll never 
And we'll never see the light of day 

I fall right through the grasp that was said to save us all, and fall 
I must wait for the kill 

Just as I leap for you i see the light as i grow close 
It will be the mess that you made
