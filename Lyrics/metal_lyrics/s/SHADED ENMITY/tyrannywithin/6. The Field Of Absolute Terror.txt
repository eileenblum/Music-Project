The paralizing icons of reconciliation 
Bleeding the premenition of complacence 
Foundation unstable unable to support 
The force of longing bound in suffering

Precious terror absolute 
Bred this world in the image of insanity 
Presumed complete control 
Adoption of fantasy void and illusion 

Refuge devoid of responisbility
Collapse of control the ultimate serenity 
Warm the impression of impenetrable security 
Erosion of logic degradation of rational thought 

The bleeding
The permeation 
Of the impressive impersonation 
Quiet the passing broken through time 
Quite careless undertanding, 
Falling from the lips of apathy 

Searching for 
The epiphany 
This is what you fear, 
That you will dissappear,
Drowning out the sound
Moving forward through the tears

Evolving prespectives, eroding, resolving
Detective logic, expanding, revolving
Conscious deception, effective, restraining
Egocentric disposition, expecting, remaining

Empty the void of consciousness
Pain the truth of life
Left surrounded by those that abandon
You the truth of one

"The Field of Absolute Terror" was redone later by the Seattle death metal band Evangelist whom contains ex-Shaded Enmity member Chris Mannino who wrote it. The new Evangelist version is basically the same thing but with blast beats.
