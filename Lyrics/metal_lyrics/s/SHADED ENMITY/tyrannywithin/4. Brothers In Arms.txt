Side by side, brothers in arms, together we fight, together we die   
Bravely we fight, death not feared, under our flag, we will survive 

From my first breath from my first step, 
Raised for this moment In which I will become a man  
To take a life with my own hands  
Marching  on towards battles dawn 
Gun loaded and prepared to fight  
Searching through the pitchblack night 

Side by side, brothers in arms, together we fight, together we die   
Bravely we fight, death not feared, under our flag, we will survive  

Onto the battlefield we charge
Facing unbelievable odds  
Prepared for the coming onslaught 
Defending our country's crest
I will fight till my  final breath  
Through hell and a bullet's caress 

Side by side, brothers in arms, together we fight, together we die   
Bravely we fight, death not feared, under our flag, we will survive  

Weakness magnified in the arena of fight  
I yern to leave this place of endless night  
Once so anxious to test my might  
Now I dread the horrific site  

Side by side, brothers in arms, together we fight, together we die   
Bravely, we fight, death not feared, under our flag, we will survive
