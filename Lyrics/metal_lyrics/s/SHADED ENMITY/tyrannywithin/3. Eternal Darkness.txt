Howling shots ring out
Shining barrels spout
Screams permeate the air
Minds forged to fear
Shaped mindless and pure
Formed sleak and bare
Cold winds bring the scent of dispair
Floods of blood the return is near

Beyond the eyes
Behind the lies
Intombed within the mind
Bound to the final demise

Look, the distant stare
Of the ones who have lost all fear
They've lost the binding of time
They've lost knowing the tears
Final gathering ingraved by shears
Left uncouth pockets filled with dirt
Rain to wash away the scars
Humans littered miserably in shards

Beyond the eyes
Shattered by lies
Intombed within the mind
Bound to the final demise

Shaped mindless and pure
Look, the distant stare
Formed sleak and bare
The ones who have lost all fear
They've lost the binding of time
The've lost knowing the tears
Rain to wash away the dismal scars
Floods of blood the return is near
