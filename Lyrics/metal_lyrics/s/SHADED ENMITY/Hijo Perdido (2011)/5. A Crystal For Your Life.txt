It hurts to feel alive
With this substance feeding off me
Never do we feel the flames
The heat is so intense for long
This was the sign we await
And the windows are dark from the days
A vow from us kept our faith
This will be over and its death i await

And this rush i feel is starting to fade
There is no more crystal till we behave
And out of all the minds, why cant i cook anything,
Why cant i cook anything, but crystal

And to return would be insane
A crystal for your life
Cause i'm not coming home

Its been days and we cant see
Its green for miles and our pores are black
Am i this way to become
But i never let it get to me
And our freedom was near
To satisfaction their pleased
And from towers they watch
And listen as the sky opens its arms

Its different when you open your eyes
Through crystal glasses, that were chilling my bones
