Before your evening dawn, act as god and force way,
This is the sun beneath the earth

And underground he waits
And he'll cut them when its time and hang them till they dry

Botany is all i need
Botany is what he seeks
And he waits for harvest cause no one can eat
And he waits for harvest cause we're all starving

Main  the botanist, we live off of botany
Expand and fill our space, we count on you for so much more
With unsuspecting feeding life, all and more it comes to an end
