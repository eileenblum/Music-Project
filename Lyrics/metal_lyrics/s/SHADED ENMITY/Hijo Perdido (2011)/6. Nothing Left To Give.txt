Your gracious to invite us to listen to your heart
And a calling of a thousand, would raise your counters more
Who is that, on center, i saw his face before but
I think it was somewhere else maybe this guys a whore
My wisdom, can see right through your lie
For deep in my heart i can see it all for i am the one
That got away
I am the one that got away

Part after verse: he stares in their eyes like nothing is wrong
Wipe the blood away from the robe sometimes, this happens

Its their youth and their flex that make them cause desire
If pleasure is what pleasure does then your in heavens way

I sat there for many, and every time you bowed
They stand and raise and praise and call your name aloud
The 7 hundred club is full of bile and lies
Who is that on center? burn him at the stake!
Oh falseness, led by this, your will to hate and mate
When rapture comes you will be last because this is love

And for god you do this all, and for god you do this all

Its their age and the sex that makes them feel this way
If pleasure is what pleasure does then your in heavens way
