At the edge of the world sits a man on a stone of greed
With a darkened frown and a wish for gold
If it werent for the bird with the human tongue in the copper cage
Quite surely he'd have died quite long ago

The man at the edge of the world
And laughing, we will go, to the man at the edge of the world

And one day perched high above his stone sat this lonely man with an empty cage

And the man fell ill and died alone for his only heart had flown away with the wind
