In warning i give to you
The lost one spoke my name
Yet i hide to his dismay
Curse and will can bring us still
And right for wrong bring me on
Sun looks still against my will
And there is ice underneath
And i am in between
And i no longer know

And i saw my own demise
And there is only one way out "one way out"
And i saw my own demise
And there is only one way out

Life on a can just kick till it tilts
And pray the rope doesnt break
For all will know mistake
Taste my sweat its amphetamine
Chemical spill that went my way
And only glass can hold whats in
I fault fire and wait till dawn
And i forgot it all
And i never knew
