When nothing ever made you lose your touch
When silence fills the words that leave your mouth
When you lose the feeling in your soul
And you lost the part that played the song

....and nothing

The sun looked down on us, its eyes had fury
And faith was no more. decide

And i lost the touch, and i lost it all
Bury me on a hill so i can see all the sun has missed

We are not the same in substance or bliss
Its the dna that connects that wont replace

When you lose the feeling in your soul
And you lost the part that played the song
