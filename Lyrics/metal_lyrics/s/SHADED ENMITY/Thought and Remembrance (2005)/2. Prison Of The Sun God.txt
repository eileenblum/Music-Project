Climbing the stairs of the altar you love 
Blinded by the fear that penetrates your heart 
Listening to the voices of the prophets of old 
Go on and sacrifice 
Make the cut that will please them today 
Turn around do it
All for the Sun god the one you love
All for her 

Pleasing the sun god never felt better 
Sacrifice children and your home 
Oh god, we adore 
But kill me faster we are your whore 

Prison of the Sun God, keep you forever 
Prison of the Sun God, youâll bathe in forever 
Prison of the Sun God, he is your food 
Prison of the Sun God, I am your life 

Your only son laying on the altar prepared to die 
The guiding crow takes his lasts looks, fit to die, 
Not fit to die, not fit to cry
Come on, we will please her,
Tomorrow maybe we will please her 
Tomorrow, we will 

Pleasing the sun god never felt better 
Sacrifice children and your home 
Oh god, we adore 
But kill me faster we are your whore
