Breaking in, and pushing out, the morning of the dawn 
Endless demons torturing me inside 
Sleep, endless sleep seems like it will never come 
My eyes are burning and my hearts exploding; dream black dawn 

Crystallizing my future and my dreams I had 
Black dawn, oh black dawn wonât you come and take me away
Take me down to where the grass is green and the children long to play 
Black Dawn

Spending my time, wasting time, I canât sleep now 
I want to kill myself to end this pain 
The morning of the black dawn, the scream, black dawn 
My eyes are burning and my hearts exploding; dream black dawn

Crystallizing my future and the dreams I had 
Black dawn, oh black dawn wonât you come and take me away
Take me down to where the grass is green and the children long to play 
Black Dawn 
Black Dawn
