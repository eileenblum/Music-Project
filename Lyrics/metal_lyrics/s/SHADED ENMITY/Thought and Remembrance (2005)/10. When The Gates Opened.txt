From the tops of the mountains, called your king 
Calling all to battle. The gates were opening. 
Taking your axe and preparing to fight 

Run by those proved worthy 
Run by those that pleased the gods 
Run by the men that betrayed you 
Run by those who will kill you 

Door opened, cherubim, and angel 
The taste of battle 
What more was to be asked of those that served the one. 

When the gates opened thereâs clashing of swords 
Fire and ash and blood that created them 
When the gates opened the ones that betrayed 
Bloodied halos and shredded wings 

Run by those proved worthy 
Run by those that pleased the gods 
Run by the men that betrayed you 
Run by those who will kill you 

Door opened, an angel flying down 
The taste of battle 
What more was to be asked of those that served the one.

When the gates opened thereâs clashing of swords 
Fire and ash and blood that created them 
When the gates opened the ones that betrayed 
Bloodied halos and shredded wings

Woh, the killing spree of the cherubim, 
Slaughter the mortals that hunted them down
Cherubim
