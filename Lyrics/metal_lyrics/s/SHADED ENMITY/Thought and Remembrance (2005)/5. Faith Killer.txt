When the master said it couldnât be found 
When the door spoke its name aloud 
You found the strength to say, âwhereâs my name old man?â 
When the judge looked and me and said 
Your eyes are dark and your full of hate 
My response was give me new ones

But they said wasnât found 
When they spoke it aloud 
The scribe missed, oh he did miss 
Your mistake not mine oh life giver 

But they were Killing my faith and killing my faith and never giving back 
The faith Killer dressed in white, 
Iâm living a lie, Iâm living a lie and never coming back
The faith Killer dressed in white

When the lie he spoke became truth 
When he denied it for me three 
I found the strength to say, this is your book? 
When you cursed the door that spoke aloud 
It never spoke in return 
Am I really living a lie 

But they said wasnât found 
When they spoke it aloud 
The scribe missed, oh he did miss 
Your mistake not mine oh life giver 

But they were Killing my faith and killing my faith and never giving back 
The faith Killer dressed in white, 
Iâm living a lie, Iâm living a lie and never coming back
The faith Killer dressed in white
