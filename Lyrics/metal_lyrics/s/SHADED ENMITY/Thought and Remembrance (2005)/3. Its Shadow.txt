Here it comes once again passing by my home
The streets are dark and Iâm filled with fear, it shall take me next
From the sign of the blood red moon 
And there is only one star in the sky. 

But it will never catch me now
I resist the faith
But it will never catch me now 
Haunting me every night 

Itâs shadow comes
Coming for me 
I curse the son
Itâs shadow comes
Coming for me 
I curse the son

You took the lives of everyone before me 
Forcing your beliefs from your cup of wine 
Making them eat the lamb of your god 
Tasting bread that is the flesh 

But it will never catch me now
I resist the faith
But it will never catch me now 
Haunting me every night 

Itâs shadow comes
Coming for me 
I curse the son, you come from
Itâs shadow comes
Coming for me 
I curse the son, you came from

Itâs shadow comes
Coming for me 
I curse the son, 

Coming for me 
I curse the son,
Itâs shadow comes
