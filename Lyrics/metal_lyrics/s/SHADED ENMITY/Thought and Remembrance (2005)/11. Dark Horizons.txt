Across the field, across the plane 
Lies your honor, your honor you left behind 
Thereâs no hope, thereâs no justice for the way you stood your ground 
Holding the hope, that heâs still alive if not heâs dead 

Breaking down, in tears, wishing he was alive 
Stripped of your honor, wishing you were dead 
But there was nothing more 
Nothing for him to leave behind 

Dark horizons bleeding me 
Dark horizons haunting me 
Empty shells of a bitter past 
Empty heart of a past forgotten 

Curled in your corner, staring at the wall 
Shaking for fear, shaking from fright 
Thin and pale youâve become 
Just think of the dark horizon 

Breaking down, in tears, wishing he was alive 
Stripped of your honor, wishing you were dead 
But there was nothing more 
Nothing for him to leave behind 

Dark horizons bleeding me 
Dark horizons haunting me 
Empty shells of a bitter past 
Empty heart of a past forgotten
