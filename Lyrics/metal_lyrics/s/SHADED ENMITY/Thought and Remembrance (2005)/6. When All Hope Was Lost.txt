Your beliefs have gone and left me cold 
Iâm shivering 
From fear of nothing to fill the space 
I'm growing old. 

Broken heart and a troubled mind left me insane
Stealing the words from prophets mouths to become what I am

But you gave up 
From those troubled years 
But you felt so proud 
To destroy those fears 
But you gave up 
For lands of pure 
To destroy those fears

Fragile lost desire 
But you speak in tongues unable to decipher 
When all hope was lost 
You spoke in tongues unable to decipher 

All thats left were the pictures and memories of old 
All hope was lost but you rocked it up and paid no heed 
Taking your life, taking your tears, dying for years
Tasting your life, tasting your tears, dying for years 

But you gave up 
For lands of pure
But you felt so proud 
To destroy those fears 
But you gave up 
For lands of pure 
To destroy those fears

Fragile lost desire 
But you speak in tongues unable to decipher 
When all hope was lost 
You spoke in tongues unable to decipher
