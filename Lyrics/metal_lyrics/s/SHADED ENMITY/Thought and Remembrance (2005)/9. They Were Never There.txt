Hitting hard wall as it made its speech to you 
Looking back at this accomplishment 
How I have furthered myself in what I have done 
What have I done but to destroy myself 

Grab on and hold on cause you are breathing your last 
Reach into the sky and grab your place cause you will sleep 
I feel myself decaying oh yes I am decaying 
I am both weak and young oh what a match I have made 

Grab on and hold on cause you are breathing your last 
Reach into the sky and grab your place cause you will sleep 
I feel myself decaying oh yes I am decaying 
I am both weak and young oh what a match I have made 

They stared and looked as I died and yet carried on 
Oh tell me what its like to watch me die 
I decay yet to your amusement I still live 
Give me what help you can cause I see none insight 

Grab on and hold on cause you are breathing your last 
Reach into the sky and grab your place cause you will sleep 
I feel myself decaying oh yes I am decaying 
I am both weak and young oh what a match I have made 

Grab on and hold on cause you are breathing your last 
Reach into the sky and grab your place cause you will sleep 
I feel myself decaying oh yes I am decaying 
I am both weak and young oh what a match I have made
