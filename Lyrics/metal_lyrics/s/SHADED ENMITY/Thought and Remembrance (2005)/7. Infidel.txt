Are you divine, or are you just mine 
To mold you and sculpt you all for me 
Were you instead in the presence of humanity 
When the creator lied and built you from bone 
Are you divine, or are you just mine 
To mold you and sculpt you all for me 

I am the Infidel 
I
I am the Infidel
Requiem

Beauty lies in the hidden disguise 
Of the one who creates the hell 
I am infidel, worship me 
Cause I am the creator. 
Beauty lies in the hidden disguise 
Of the one who creates the hell 
I am infidel, worship me 
Cause I am the creator.

Build your statues you are still chained 
They will bind you till you repent 
Repent to me for it matters not 
Complicated it sounds I lie not 
Build your statues you are still chained 
They will bind you till you repent 

I am the Infidel 
Requiem
I am the Infidel
Requiem

Beauty lies in the hidden disguise 
Of the one who creates the hell 
I am infidel, worship me 
Cause I am the creator. 
Beauty lies in the hidden disguise 
Of the one who creates the hell 
I am infidel, worship me 
Cause I am the creator.
