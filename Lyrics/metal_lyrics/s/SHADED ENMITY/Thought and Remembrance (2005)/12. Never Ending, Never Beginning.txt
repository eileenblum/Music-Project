Oh it was my fault that this began to escalate 
My beautiful road with a bridge meant for crossing 
Now Iâm here with my dead tools in my dead hand 
My project of desire stopped by my naivity 

But my back began to break and I began to stop 
But my heart bled with every step and I could not feel 
My personal savior stuck in the middle 
But my back began to break and I began to stop 
But my heart bled with every step and I could not feel 
My savior, my personal savior built in the middle

As I run across my road I yearn for an ending 
Yet how could I want when I never had a beginning 
Now my skeletal figure reaches out and cries 
Now my skeletal self stretches out in my personal hell 

And my chest began to pound but I could not stop 
And my body hurt but I never stopped I just kept on going 
Personal savior, stuck in the middle
And my chest began to pound but I could not stop 
And my body hurt but I never stopped I just kept on going 
Personal savior, stuck in the middle
