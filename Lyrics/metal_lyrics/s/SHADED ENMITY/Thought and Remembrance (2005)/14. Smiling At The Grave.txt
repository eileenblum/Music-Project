First in line to win
First in line to sacrifice 
First in line to be last to dine
Those with the weakest 
Hand were picked to dig through the six that would be theirs 

No more feeling and no more emotions 
Sacrificed to those first in line oh end my pain 
This endless pain, smile 

Smiling at the grave that's yours 
Smiling at the icon that confronts you 
Smiling at your last hope
Smiling at your end. The Reaper enters 

Days of old catching your ear 
When you used to know your way 
When you weren't lost to your pain 
But you dug your own grave and now you sleep 
You died while you slept, no prayer could help you now 
No soul was left for him to take, just the six feet that made you happy 

No more feeling and no more emotions 
Sacrificed to those first in line oh end my pain 
This endless pain, smile 

Smiling at the grave that's yours 
Smiling at the icon that confronts you 
Smiling at your last hope
Smiling at your end. The Reaper enters
