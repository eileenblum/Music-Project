Age can slay the feeble mind
When all is fine, yet you are bleak

December rain, come fall on me
Come take this pain. December rain

We all decide below
The rigid tree as left a straight blank stare
For all we know was meant to be
A broke hand fiend goes straight into the jar

The chair is still
The earth is breathing
Your heart is seething all is calm

Look in my fear, the fortune is mine
How can i miss? The target is fine.
All i can have has nothing to say
Is this the end? Come find my way.

Look in my soul, the future is mine
How many days? i look away
All I can see looks nothing but dark
This is the end
I'll see my way
