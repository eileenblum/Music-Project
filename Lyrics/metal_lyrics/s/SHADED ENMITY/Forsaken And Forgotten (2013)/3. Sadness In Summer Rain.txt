If you had a broken watch,
One hand to tell the truth,
One hand to tell a lie

And when they meet,
Pretend to greet.
Put this on repeat.

If they give you bitter trouble,
Just switch their hands.

[2x]
Dripping on, the stream runs down.
Gasping for air, the current is strong.

A wall can't keep you safe.
A prayer won't keep away a mind so sick it stays

When they suffer do you hurt?
When they bleed do you feel?

Share the rain
Pedophiles in denial,
A glowing priest with a loving hand
Follow men that line their pockets
All the sadness in the world.
And I'm standing in the rain...
'Cause it's a cold summer day.
