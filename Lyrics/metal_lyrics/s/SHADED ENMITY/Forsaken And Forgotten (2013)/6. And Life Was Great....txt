And Life Was Great
But it all Left So Soon
And It's too Late
For Everyone is Gone

A struggle to go one step
A fight to take one breath
All a war inside
The Cannons blaze on through
What If I change the tide?
What if i go instead?

It said there was no feeling
It said there was hope
The note was hard to read
The paper was thin
and his handwriting grim
But from the look of it this was no ordinary note

All these things that eat at me
All these things never go away
Life was great and now its done

He only needed your sympathy
A hint of compassion
But there was none
He only needed your affection
But there was none

The remnants stain the walls
You can't bare to look
Reality sets in
