There's a place you used to call home
There's a face you used to call your own

It happened just like that, the taste you learned to love
You can't foresee it, the high you learned to chase
Just some foil, government approved
Inhale, slowly exhale

What have you done, Oxycontin?
What have you done?

You're mine in a pill
You're mine to kill
You're mine give me more
I want more
You will do anything

Why can't you speak to me, blood of mine?
Why can't you speak to me?
You were so pretty
