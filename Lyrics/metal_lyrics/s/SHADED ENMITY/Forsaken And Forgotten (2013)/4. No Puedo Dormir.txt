Can you feel the ground?
Soil beneath

You rip into the fold
To find the jitter
If you look good, it's among the litter
Thoughts make up the past
To find it all
Straight and narrow to end it all

As far as I have come
I feel I've lost
Zero traction
I'm letting go

I cant ever sleep
I can't ever feel
I....
This life is not for me
I can't ever love
I can't ever please
This life is not for me

Am I on the wave?
It's pulling me down

Synthetic dreams

When all your eyes just thought they've seen enough
When all your eyes just thought they've seen enough

I'm twitching
And its growing
Into....
I'm wishing
And hoping
That I'll just wake up
