The night is young, the lights are blazing
If one goes we will be facing five plus more
Ten pounds and I, I'm on the move
A fear, a shock, paranoia

For the bread divine
And a drink of gold
For the cup divine
And a drink of gold

Are they watching? Are they listening?
What might you find interesting?
Federal inspecting, you'll find nothing, come and see

The road seems empty, the light is blinding
lit up and now comes truth
The thirst for bone has now been changed
As you are led away you'll face this

Medication for the masses
Pharmacy of Green
Escape from manufactured death

My body soars, my mind is free
Gorgeous thoughts, but they are fading

They just want to take it away
They just want to put me away

It will be dark
There will be rape
There will be walls of hate
There will be skin to scrape
This cannot be the way

Ten steps back and i'm falling again
My eyes are red and bloodshot again
15 pounds and I'm starting to sweat
Who are these faces in disguise?
In my dream i run away
In my dream it goes away
In my dream it stays the same and then....
I run away. Run away. Run away.
Run away.
