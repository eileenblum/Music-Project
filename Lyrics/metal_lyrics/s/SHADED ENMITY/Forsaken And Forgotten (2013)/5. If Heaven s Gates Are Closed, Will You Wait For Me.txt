It seems foundation, but it's elation 
With force like rocket it will break like glass and come back for more 
It's all beside you
The scent is tempting 
The book is heavy there's a section missing, look no more 

There's an opening 
That he drops me through 
The steel clangs shut 
All I see is you 

What's this disguise? It's just for loading 
In case it tumbles it will hold its force, creation lies
Stick to your path, the motion is leaving 
His hand is heavy there's a section missing, put down the pen

Why were you chosen? 
God knows something I don't know
Why was he smiling?
There's no heroin in your veins 

Can you wait?
Can you wait?
I can't wait.

It's hot outside and I began to think
There's all this stream and I began to breath
Can you hold me down?
He's stoned inside and he begins to think
There's all this haze and he begins to leave
This will hold you down
