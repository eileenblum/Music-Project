Living everyday
Wishing for the end
Your axe up on your heart
Fighting for your god
Offering the lives of those
Taken by you unable
To take your own

Thereâs no need to
Shout the cry of war
A cause unwilling to give back
I broke my back for you
Years of pillage for pain

Your life, displeasure
Killing the christ within them
The gods of war have failed
But the black heart has prevailed

The stench of death
Takings its toll on you
Unable to lift your sword
Once more it said
Once more to darken your heart
The dreams you had
Promised by the gods of war
