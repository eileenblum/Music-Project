I choose my path, I spill the blood, I take what anyone can call their home
Hurt bred in me, faith disowned in me, whatâs more for you to see
The one-year left, the hands that killed, the voyage to the seventh sea
the one man left, the one man killed, the seventh sea was killing me

The seventh sea is killing me
The faith I had was lost to sea
The seventh sea was not to be
The seventh sea opened up to me

Dark horizons, smile at me, I took this as my home
Years of lost time, slowly passing by, whatâs more for the sea
The one child left, the smile on its face, gone to the seventh sea
The one man left, the shadow on his heart, his voyage to the seventh sea
