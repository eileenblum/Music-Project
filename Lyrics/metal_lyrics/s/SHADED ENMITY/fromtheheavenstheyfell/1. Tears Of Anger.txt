Trapped inside this wall, it presses in on me so i cannot breathe
My anger flowing through my veins so I am forced to live in pain
I fight for every day though with each step I take one back in time
My heart breaking every day till I am forced to live no more

The Tears of Anger they flow down on me
The tears of anger taking life from me
The tears of anger breathing life into me

Crying for your death is what I wish even though my pain still lives on
I fought for your death but my anger for you keeps me awake and breeds insomnia
My heart is dead with nothing but the blood of my cold body
In my land it snows pure white for the people that live and the people that die
