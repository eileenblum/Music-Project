With hands like iron he held his steel
The hero second to none
The dogs were restless, they smelled the wild
He's last adventure'd begun

Eagles circle the sky
Today the good-one must die

He chased the lion and killed the wolf
It was a succesful day
But shapeless forces lay in the mist
In wait for a royal prey

Conspiracy in the dark
The Evil's setting its mark

The Brave Die Hard, in your final hour
Don't cry for mercy
Don't scream out loud, don't let them see your pain
In your eyes the prophecy of fall and slavery
Just raise your head, you've always been so proud
The Brave Die Hard

He knelt to the water to slake his thirst
Oh, what a tormenting end!
The man, unbeaten in all those fights
Was dead, betrayed by his friends

The pike is crossing his heart
Contention's going to start

The Brave Die Hard...
