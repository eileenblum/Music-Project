My heart's beating wild
'Cause I feel it's time
Time to live my dreams
We're setting the sail
Our ship will prevail
Over stormy waves

I've lived by the sword
My fate's been foretold
But noone rules my life
It will take a turn
The fire will burn
In this soul of mine

Far-far over the sea
Lives the one, who waits for me
And I swear by my life
I'll reach the coast
So what is destiny
All the riches and bravery
If I can't have her love
I will be lost

It's probably my end
But I can not wait any longer
I trust in my friend's helping hand
My way leads from darkness
Into the light of day
At the end of this mission
In pride I will stand

Hold on my friends
We're almost there
Dark clouds disappear
In this land of Ice
The strong can survive
So drive away your fear

Deep in my mind
A voice calling loud:
"Beware the beast in white!"
Her smile shows the pain
My true Hagen says:
"She's the devil's bride"

There's no way back for me
But it was my choice, so let me be
May she bring suffering
Peace or war
In the contest she gave me pain
But this journey wasn't in vain
I am trapped in her love
Forevermore

It's probably...
