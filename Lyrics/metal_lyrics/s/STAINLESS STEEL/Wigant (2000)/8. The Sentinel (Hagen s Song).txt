Left alone in the wasteland of my memories
After all I have not lost my will
You took a life, they said, and that's a heavy crime
They've denied so fast their lust to kill!

I saw red, I already know
Where hatred dwells
But I must take care of my king
Oh, I'm the Sentinel

Who needs all those treasures of an outsider?
Let the holy foams engulf them all!
I am not a prophet, but I have to warn
A power's on the rise that makes us fall

Hear these words of a true man
Who serves you well
My duty's to watch, to protect this land
Oh, I'm the Sentinel

Prepare for the twilight
When creatures of Hell ride
Just pray to your Maker
But I'll be your saviour

I am your saviour
