A guest for lost glory has come to the end
Far from the loved ones and far from the land
Fire of vengeance is melting the soul
Just one last meeting, you can't ask for more

Madness is growing inside of the brain
Can't wash your crimes down in this pouring rain
Inside the walls, where the silence's so great
The beast lies in wait

Power's so raw
Steel is the law
Into the dark you fly
Just like a crow
Your fate is sealed
Wounds can't be healed
Until the end of time
They have is bleed

Avenger in armour, she's cold like a stone
Thousands are with her, but she's so alone
Spilling the blood of the kings and the knights
Insanity guides

Power's...

Darkness reaches so high
It turns the wind and kills the light
But somewhere out in the night
Hope's still alive; new heroes ride

Power's so raw
Steel is the law
Into the dark you fly
Just like a crow
On bended knee
Who sets you free?
Trust in the Holy One
Pray, and you'll see
