See those armies march away
Defeated men of yesterday
In their eyes is nothing but
Broken pride

Hear our song fly to the sun
The march of Glory's just begun
On blood-stained fields we do advance
And fate's our guide

See, here I stand
And under the sign of God
I'll carry on my way

We beat back Saxon and Danish men
They will not attack again
Gunther is our mighty king
He spares their lives

And I, I'm the one
Who found a better home
Behind these mighty walls

For the Glory of Worms I fight
I don't obey any masters
For this land I would give my life
'Cause it's the place where I can be free

So tell me, are you strong enough to ride with me
And to fight with me for the land and your king
And tell me, are you strong enough to leave your home
And not to know what tomorrow will bring

For the Glory...

I came to this land
To find the love
I was searching for
Through all those years

And now she's here
In my arms, my everything
And when I'm tired
She rocks me to sleep

Volker, raise our flag up high
Let it flatter in the sky
Hagen, I see in your eyes
The fire of war

They say I'm unbeatable
And I know, I will never fall
Until this power drives me on
And fills my soul

Friends, my dear love
I feel, I'm not a stranger
In this land anymore

For the Glory...
