I came through the fire of the past centuries
And now I'm here, my wills made of steel
Stories of forgotten realms live again
Just hear my words about freedom and course

Keep an eye on history
One day it will show your destiny

Let me tell about heroes of an ancient time
I know them all, glory and fall
And every stolen secret
Join me on this journey back in ancient times
Strife of the kings, heroic deeds
A great adventure waits for you

Say, have you ever been so close to your dreams?
The time is right, look into the light
Shadows of the fallen dance around the fire
Don't fear my friend, 'cause it's not the end

Are you ready for the ride?
Now will leave this darksome world behind

Just read the pages of dusty books
Glide on wings of the magical history
Seek the answers, the long lost roots
And you'll find yourself
