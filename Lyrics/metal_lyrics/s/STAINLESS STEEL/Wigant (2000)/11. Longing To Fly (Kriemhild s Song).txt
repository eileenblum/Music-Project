Here in my room, in chains of tears and mourning
The endless pain is darkening every thought
Why? Why have you gone?
Why you left me here?
My heart is full of fear
My heart is full of fear

Deep in the night I hear a silent whisper
I see your face in the candlelight
Our time is running out, I know it well
There's so much more to tell
There's so much more to tell

And my heart is longing to fly
Over forests and hills to the misterious skies
And my heart is longing to fly
To the place where angels cry

And my heart is yearning to die
In that place where angels cry
In that place where heroes lie
