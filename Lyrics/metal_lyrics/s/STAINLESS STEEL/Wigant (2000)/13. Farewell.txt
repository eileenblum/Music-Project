The dawn is cold
The fire in the distant sky
Is taking my sight
All men in arms
We're waiting for a sign

I had a dream
A dream of running blood
I felt my body burning
I heard a voice
"Vengeance will be mine"

Into the Unknown we ride
Passing mountains, valleys
Searching for the way
Follow the leaders
Whatever it may take

I left my home
And held my crying wife and children
For a last time
I wish that I could wipe away their tears

The deadly sin, Siegfried's blood
Is screaming to the edge of heaven
The guilty souls are damned
For a million years

Farewell to the land of eternal glory
Where true hearts were united in peace
Farewell to the river of thousand fairytales
To the whispering warm summerbreeze

[Spoken words:]
It's an invitation - said the Ruler.
Fear spread its wings in the hearts of the followers.
In obdience to the command they all set out to the journey,
But for many of them it was clear, just like written words:
This could be a journey with no return.

Farewell to the land of eternal glory
Where true hearts were united in peace
Farewell to the river of thousand fairytales
To the whispering warm summerbreeze
The wheel of history's moving forward
A new chapter in life will begin
Farewell to the people, who are dear to me
I hope, I'll see you again will meet again
