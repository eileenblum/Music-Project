Born from the dust of the glittering stars
Reinforced his soul in glorious wars
Ruling the countries by steel and the might
Scourge of God, bringer of light

Contract with powers of heaven he made
They give him force, control his fate
Surrounded by wisemen he gains mastery
Over the dark, eternally

Kings knelt down, and they gave their crown
To the ruler praised by all
The longest path leeds to victory
But he could not resist the call

Holy winds of pride
(Are) Blowing by your side
And taking you far, where the mystery hides
Where your bravemen ride
Night and day collide
You are the one, King of nomads

Men came from far, where the Sun meets the Earth
A story they've told about evil's birth
He send them back to the walls by the Rhein
To rescue the princess from all the crime
