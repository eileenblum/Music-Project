With my last forces I try to climb that hill
The heat is rising, it's breaking my will

How did I came here? The answer is not found
The sun's burning harder and I can't hold my ground

It's scorching, it's tormenting me!

In the heat, my last reward
Someone's punishing me hard
By the rays of the desert sun
Burning sand in my eyes
I reach my hands out to the skies
To stop the rays of the desert sun

Oh, mighty tornado, please, blow me away
Be my redeemer on this judgement day

God of sand, I confess my sins!
