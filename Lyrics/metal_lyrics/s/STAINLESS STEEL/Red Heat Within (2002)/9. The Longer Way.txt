A secret shelter, a sanctuary
Is the temple of life, you'll see
Fading shadows, bridges burn
All the wisdom lies there to learn

There's a short way in the shade
Showing you an open gate
But if you want to find a place
Away from the dark
The longer way you have to walk

Hear the sirens calling you
Never trust them, their voice's untrue
A few companions are all you've got
Hard to find out who's a friend, who's not

There's a passage through the moor
Promising an easy war
But if you want to find some peace
Deep in your heart
The longer way you have to walk
