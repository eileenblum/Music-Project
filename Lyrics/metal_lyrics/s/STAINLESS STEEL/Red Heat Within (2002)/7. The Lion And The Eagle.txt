It's roaring again
This is the rage of Melqart
Gods of Carthage, I follow your will
Some years ago
My father made me promise
To fight the Romans with fire and steel

And my oath I won't forget
I'll finish what he started once
We took Saguntum, made a passage through snow and ice
We rushed the Romans down with rage
And saw much anguish in their eyes
And I felt there will be no peace and no compromise

Here we are, the lion and the eagle
Two predators prepared to fight
With many bleeding wounds
We claw and we tear each other
Until one gives the final bite

I've lost an eye
Deep in the moors of Arnus
We beat the legions by Trebia with pride
Marching with faith
We reached the plane of Cannae
We fought in glory and Paulus has died

I look back on these years of war
All the bloodshed and the pain
And I can see the tired eyes of my warriors
Shall I storm the mighty walls
Or leave this wasted land behind?
It's a hard decision and it will steal my force

Face to face, the lion and the eagle
Two predators prepared to fight
With many bleeding wounds
We claw and we tear each other
Until one gives the final bite
With many bleeding wounds
We'll rival and fight forever
Until one loses all his might

Dreams never come true
I don't know what to do
The senate is asking me what I want to prove
They'll never understand
I fight for my own land
With them or alone, but I must make a move
