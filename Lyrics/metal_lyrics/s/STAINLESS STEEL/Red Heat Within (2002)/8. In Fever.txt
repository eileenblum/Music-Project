Ride, father, ride
Your child is lying in your arms
His body's in fever
Don't miss the path
Seek for a shelter in the night
He's getting much weaker, so ride!

Trees in the rain
Whisper the words of ancient mights
The call of the reaper
Ride, father, ride
Your child is crying in your arms
He's getting much weaker

In the darkest night a candle's burning out
Witness is only the storm

Father, please, help me
Darkness' surrounding me
I'm so afraid in the night
Father, please, hide me
He's reaching out for me
Save me from the king of the demons

[The King:]
Here I am, my boy
I am the one you've always waited for
I'll tell you things you never heard before
Come with me, my boy
I am the master of forevermore
I'll show you things you've never seen before
I'm your guide through the kingdom of shadows
This meaningless being has come to the end
Take my hand, my boy
I am the master forevermore

[Son:] Father, see, here he comes!
He's so near
His crown is shining in the dark
[Father:] Noone's there, little son
Have no fear
It's just the wind...

Ride, father, ride
Your child is dying in your arms
His body's much colder
A shelter you found
But all is in vain, he's not alive
He couldn't fight longer

In the darkest night a candle has burned out
Witness was only the storm
