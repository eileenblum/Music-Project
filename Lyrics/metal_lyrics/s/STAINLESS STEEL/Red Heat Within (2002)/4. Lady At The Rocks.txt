On a winter morning
He sailed out with the promise
To return with splendid gifts from distant lands
It was twenty years ago
But she still can feel the caress of his hands

Night after night
When at the rocks the moon is bright
She walks the beach alone
Out on the sea
Far in the distance there must be
A ship on its way home

Closer is the moment
Her heart is beating faster
Sometimes he comes to visit in her dreams
Love can turn into agony
And she doesn't want to live for memories anymore

(So she will sail!)
