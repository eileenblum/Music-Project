Take a look around this place
Dust and ashes, we burned it up
What's the smile upon your face?
Do you really want to pull me down?

I wish that I could hide away
But the passion forces me to stay

Your love is a wicked game
In all of my dreams I can see you
I try to forget the pain
But it's always around me to make me remember you

Love is dancing on thin ice
Like a vampire you want my blood
But I'm a demon in disguise
Who's still hungry just as you are

Just run one of the ways you see
But you'll realize, it leads to me

My love is a wicked game
In all of your dreams I'm still with you
You try to forget my name
But it's written in your heart to make you remember this love
