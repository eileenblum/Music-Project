Dust of a long-long journey
Covers my old black coat
And here I am standing
At the gates of my home
Feelings I've missed so long
Are now coming back to me
I kneel down to kiss the ground
And throw down my sword

I was traveller of hundred lands
And sailor of seven seas
But I couldn't find my place
In this whole wide world
Good friends I offered help
And demons I sent to hell
They're all looking down on me
My battles are fought

See, I have returned to start again
Giving myself another chance
Dreaming the future, I know how to live my life
Signs among the stars showed me the way
This is the place I want to stay
Doesn't matter if the old Earth turns out of its course
