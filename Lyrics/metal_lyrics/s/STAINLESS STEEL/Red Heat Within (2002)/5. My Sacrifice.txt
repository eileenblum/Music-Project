This is a dark way
Painted with blood and tears
Like the path of my memories
Something has broken
I'm in a savage war
Nothing is like it was before

Soon the blade will rise to victimize
I'll find your trail, wherever you may live
The gods will like my sacrifice
And years go by, but I never will forgive

Out in the jungle
Where I know every rule
I'm the master and you're the fool
The source of power
Lies in my restless blood
Silent hunter's your final cut

Those voices from the past
I knew so well
Keep calling, they whisper
Is it madness? I don't know,
But I don't care
I've got only one thing on my mind
I wear a mask, the mask of rage
You'll never know, you'll never see my face
But I'll make you remember!
