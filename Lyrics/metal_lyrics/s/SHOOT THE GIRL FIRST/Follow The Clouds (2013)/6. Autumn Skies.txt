Weâve grown up, and times have changed.
Iâve just realised that Iâll never be back.
Itâs been such a long time coming, and finaly set forever.
When skyline will appear,
Iâll be the first one standing.
Red leaves, dead trees,
as a perfect beginning.
Red leaves dead trees, as a perfect beginning.
Summerâs gone.
Summer blows skyline of autumn grows.
Raindrops feel like arrows.
Weâve grown up, and times have changed,
Iâve just realised that Iâll never be back.
Red leaves, dead trees,
but lifeâs never ending.
Never ending.
Read leaves, dead trees,
as a perfect beginning,
as a perfect beginning.
Summerâs gone.
Summer blows skyline of autumn grows.
Raindrops feel like arrows.
