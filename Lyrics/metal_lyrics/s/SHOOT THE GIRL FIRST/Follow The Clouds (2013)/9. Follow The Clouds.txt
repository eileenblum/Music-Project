At the ends of time, 
my ship is cominâ in,
please wonder deep inside,
will you stand by my side?
At the ends of time, 
my ship is cominâ in,
please wonder deep inside,
will you stand by my side?
Weâll scream it loud, 
while standing on the bow,
Iâll keep checking the horizon,
feel the waves come crashinâ, 
come crashinâ down 
come crashinâ down 
on you.
At the ends of time, 
my ship is cominâ in,
please wonder deep inside,
will you stand by my side?
Where will I go, whatever I donât know,
I will follow the clouds.
Follow the clouds.
Filled with nothing but your dreams, 
eternal shadows, ephemeral passengers,
Landscapes dominator.
Filled with nothing but your dreams, 
eternal shadows, ephemeral passengers,
I will follow the clouds.
Fell the waves come crashing,
Come crashing down on you.
