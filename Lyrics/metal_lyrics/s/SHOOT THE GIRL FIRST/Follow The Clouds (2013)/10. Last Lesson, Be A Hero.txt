Stare at me now, if tonight you think youâre alive.
Stand by my side if you know the price of your life.
Our streets are broken, but we can heal this now.
Our faith will soon end, and we can fix this now.
Fix this now.
On the highway of his life, 
whan a man thinks about his past,
he looks to the groud.
But when he wonders about the future,
he stares at the sky.
On the highway of his life, 
when a man thinks about future,
he stares at the sky.
Cross my heart, iâll save myself.
Before someone has to.
Iâll save myself, before someone has to,
cross my heart.
