Standing on our feet, never prostrate, never forget.
We all believe in, trying to do the best.
I refuse to disengage, refuse to play the game,
thank you so much, fuck you for everything.
Bleed bastard, youâre all fuckin liars.
Die vultures, watch your back motherfuckers.
We walk the way standing the lines,
nothing gold can stay, neither our lives.
Someone, somewhere is about to declare
defeat but then, weâre coming to repent.
I refuse to disengage, refuse to play the game,
cause deep inside myself is still shining the flame.
We walk the way, standing the line,
We walk the way, standing the line.
Thank you so much for nothing,
fuck you for everything.
Bleed bastard, youâre all fuckin liars.
We walk the way standing the lines,
nothing gold can stay, neither our lives.
