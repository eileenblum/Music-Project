Then you will sink or swim.
When the ship of our aweful society,
will be eatten by the dephts of morality,
Iâll be there to watch it,
then you will sink or swim.
Iâll be there to watch it,
then you will sink or swim.
I guess a few of us,
saw the light in the mirror of their lives,
but youâre nothing more than dust,
and youâll perish by the knife,
by the knife.
Knife of mutiny.
Show me love we made,
youâll hardly find it but now,
Show me all we waste, 
stretch out on miles away.
I feel them coming slowly they are hundreds,
the sins of our lovely cities which are now damned,
cause you are lame this way,
always your mistakes that we pay.
Lame this way, always your mistakes that we pay.
We pay.
Take a sit, have a shot,
the fuel of carelessness now runs in my veins.
