Unless you pray hard,
I won't go, I will not forgive,
and blackmail will not fix anything.
It's in my bones, and in my flesh,
'cause no one has ever sit on my bench.
I hear the trees fall but not the forest grows.
I hear the trees fall but not the forest grows.

I'm a freak I knew it ... before they told me.
Told me things I can't recall,
that's why I'm far from leavin' this life,
you want me to live.
I keep on ignoring them.
Voices and memories.
Ignoring what?
Shut up, voices and memories.

I will go just trying to forgive,
forget about the pain I'm feeling,
and be on my way.

All the love you have ever givin' will not just fade away.
Not fade away.
Forget about the pain you're feelin' and be on your way.

Bury me like a seed,
I'll reborn as a field.

Pray hard, I won't go,
I will not forgive, and blackmail,
will not fix anything.
