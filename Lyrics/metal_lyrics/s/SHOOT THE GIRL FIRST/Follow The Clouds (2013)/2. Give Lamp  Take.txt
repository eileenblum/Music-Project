When you cross the light,
regrets will not stay on this side.
Somesay I'll give up and they're wrong,
I'm really not done with this life,
I've been looking for the way to live in peace,
It was worthless but finally I've found it.

There is somebody out there who needs me,
maybe I haven't found him yet.

When you cross the light,
regrets will not stay on this side.

It's not about lines,
or something you could break,
It's about circles,
you have to give and take.
Give and take.

Take my hand we'll climb up to the clouds,
to make our love rain on everyone in this world.
They'll see, if they don't we'll start over.
One more time.

There is somebody out there who need me,
maybe I haven't found him yet.
But then I close my eyes
and see everything we can give and take.

If I give you my guts, you have to give me your heart,
If my heart beats on you, you have to stay alive.
If my heart beats on you, you have to stay alive.
Give me your mind and your words,
I will be your messenger.
I will be your messenger.

It's not about lines,
or something you could break.
It's about circles,
you have to give and take.

There is a light that will never go out,
when you believe in everything you stand for.

Take my hand, and I will not care about the rest.
