Fascinated, by the unreachable.
Bored with what we already have,
all you see is not for free,
everything has a price and this one,
is called time.
I see everything, canât feel anymore,
and Iâm still waitting for life to give me more.
Howl my name if you donât know what to say,
I will show you the best way, to bring back all the days,
you were standing right here, with heart in hand.
You were breathinâ and this was, enough to make you sway.
