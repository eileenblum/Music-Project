They have clocks, (raise ur fuckin' hands) we have time. On my own, i'll sure be there again. (You should recall my name.) This time i won't forsake you. Anywhere in any place, on my own, i'll meet you there. How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot. The world forgetting, by the world forgot, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd. Anywhere in any place, on my own, i'll meet you there. Come close, leave me alone you'll never recall. Come close
