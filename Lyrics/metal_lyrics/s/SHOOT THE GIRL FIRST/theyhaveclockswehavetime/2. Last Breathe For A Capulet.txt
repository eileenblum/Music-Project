I'll own you before your eyes see clear into my lies.
Own you before my heart will spread your forever.
Are you blind? Now you're blind, will you mind?
We all make mistakes, but whatever it takes,
we'll build our lives on those stakes.
Wishin' love is by your side,
Who am I please, I can't recall. I met a woman once,
gave her the best of me, what i got in return, is now what's killin' me.
So watch the sky, stars fall like dust, Dead birds won't fly anymore.
You never said goodbye before you closed your eyes.
So cold inside we've lost our minds.
Both sons of tragedy, we might have no mercy,
We're the sons of the misery, but that's not what's killin' me.
(Oh lord i won't apologize, now you're so far from me).
Hold my hand, we're now free from our chains,
we can avoid our fate, let the poison propagate.
You joined hell, but baby, i'll find you there.
