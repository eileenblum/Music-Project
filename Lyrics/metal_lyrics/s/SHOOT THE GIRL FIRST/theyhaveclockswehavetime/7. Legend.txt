When you forgive, you love. And when you love, god's light shines on you.
I've been so long coming 'round. God forsake me, I ain't breathin' your lies anymore.
Miss me.
If I were smiling, running to your arms, oh mum and dad, I've been so long coming 'round.
This is the quest of a whole life, don't bring me back. Happiness is only real when shared.
Rather than faith, rather than fame, love, money, fairness.
Rather than pain, rather than hate, purity. Give me the truth.
If i were smiling, running to your arms, would you see then, what I see now.
