There is no difference dreams and nightmares, when you can't sleep. Well...
I need your pain. Oh marla, I hate you whore.
Someday i will seperate myself from you.
You're the worst thing that ever happened to me.
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
Friends kill loneliness but only if they're real.
Friends kill loneliness but not ones you lead.
No, no place to hide.
I've been watching you smile but sins have gone. I'm watching you die.
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
screw you whore
