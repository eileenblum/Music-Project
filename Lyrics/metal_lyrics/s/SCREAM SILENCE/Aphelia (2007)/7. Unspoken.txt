You followed me too far
And now is every remedy
Unable

To find your avatar
In eversleeping realm of fame
Forsaken

I can't regain
What is lost and sadly broken
I can't regain
What is lost in my own sin

I can't regain
What is left for long unspoken
Awoken
Unspoken
Revealed

You gathered all the scars
In your small "believe in" jar
So careless

And aiming for the stars
Greedy for an unsaid verse
The chosen
