Roam on my sentiment circles
Like a lion in his cage
Untamed - betrayed

Of my delusion in mirrors
In vigilance still - I'm keeping my
Eyes closed
I'm ....

Jailed in the walls
Of my gloomy pressures
Loose my confidence
In my own
Existence

And can't get me out

And million doubts
In unwritten letters
Perish all the hopes
To escape
The tighten rope

Now I sense narrowness growing
Under my apathy veil - choking my
Weeping
Slowly

And all of my frantic endeavours
Always just flowing into
Nothingness
