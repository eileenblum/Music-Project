When the curse that I conjured up
Has begun
It will hurt, I've omitted to
Try to ban

And if solely some hurts try to
Guide me on
I will bear and don't change the course
Till it's gone

And sorry, father
A helpless son
Want to yearn, want to run
And sorry, mother
I carry on
To the back of beyond

And so we cover
Up the sun
Want to be where it begun
So we don't bother
Who comes along ...
What we miss on the run

In a world where we live in pride
A quiet shout
Where it hurts, we've omitted to
Cry it out
And my soul just keeps clinging on
To my mind
I can't bear this course leading from
Time to time

It seems so far....Aphelia......
