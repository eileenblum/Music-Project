The guess the knowing
The paleness and the glance
Let shades so soundless
Surround our innocence

And we know ...

The gloom the brightness
Beyond of the within
And greedy seeks the serpent
For truth in every sin

And we know that we both lost
And we know ...

I'm your ruin
And you're my ruins
But don't be scared let's do the wrong

I'm kerosene
And you're the raging blaze
So let it happen lead me on

The plus and minus
The going and return
It does not matter
That antimatter hurts
