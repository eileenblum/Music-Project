Finally you've done the endless thoughts
Believe that every step is guiding homewards
But all of your endeavours have become
To an worthless word
Unsaid for long

And you creep and crawl
On your barren soil
You 've been caught
In your own sowed spore

And so deep you are
At your dreary shores
There is nothing to glean
In a lonesome dream

Now you're standing right upright ashore
Proud of your work you have done before blinded by the irony you swore
To an worthless word
Unsaid for long
