Nous on broken wings
Blown away
Blends in other thoughts to
Evergrey

Grows an enforced frown
In teardrops while
I forgot
The language to survive

My eyes
Are duller and strained than before
No delight, in my eyes
All I tried
Like flowing sand in my hand
Unrecognized by my withered eyes

Hopes in blisters cause
A cold embrace
And blench in front of my
Invalid haze

In tears I'm bearing
My disguise
The sea of craving
Lies so quiet
