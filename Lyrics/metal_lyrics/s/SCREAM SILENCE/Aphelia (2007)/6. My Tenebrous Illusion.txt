In the middle of the ocean's roads
Drifts a bottle to find a way home
But couldn't find the way
Alone

Careful filled with everything
Once I threw within the raging sea
What I've lost before
In me

Cleave
The ocean's might
Carry the freight
To bright my life
In seclusion

Leave
In oceans tide
A feigned cold smile
To bright my tenebrous
Illusion

And my cradle of emotions locked
With any bottle I've thrown on any shores
But never noticed by
Someone

And the precious freight within
On eternal journey will remain
What I never can't
Regain

Just up and down
In raging oceans
Whirling around
Never run aground
And carry all
My deep devotions
Can't hear their call
In oceans growl
