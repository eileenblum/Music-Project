Countless times in a row
Grow thorns in envy
Cold will hate steady grow

Admiration and scorn
And solemnly you wear
Bruises. careful adorned

But brave I carry on
I never will belong

I'm on the run
I strike me on
And strike me on
Your feigned embellished jaw

I'm on the run
I strike me on
And strike me on
Till nearly cessation
Endure the vitriol

Fairy tales someone wrote
Once about me
No one has ever told

Disturbed in my devout
Cherished reveries
By your incessant fraud
