Is always that what's always been
Just any truth and always
A noble kind of salvation
Just always

Been one for just a second
When twilightness will fade
Just threefold we have met before
Four eyes were full of blaze

When five's the Venus sign
And sex what I won't say
Could seven be so audacious
Watch out don't be afraid

In every sin
Is always that what's always been
Just any truth and always
A noble kind of salvation
Just always

The one and only reason
Two hearts of evidence
The trinity - blind deaf and quiet
For everlasting glance

When five's the Venus sign
And sex what I won't say
Could seven be so audacious
Watch out don't be afraid
