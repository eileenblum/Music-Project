A rotten house
The place is growing cold
Something's drawing me inside
Whispering walls
Sudden awakening
You come to enter my soul
Just one beat of wings can rescue me tonight

You animate my senses
I never want to miss it
It's an unique game
That we enjoy tonight

Dance with me and fly fly fly
I believe it feels like a wing of a sparrow
Until you satisfied
I believe I'm your minion tonight
Dance with me and play play play
I believe it feels like a wing of a sparrow
Until you leave this place
I believe I'm delivered tonight
