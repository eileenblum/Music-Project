Sometimes when I sleep I hear you call my name
Just a day more by my side makes me feel the same
Send your order that you get loose from my mind
My desire for your passion makes me feel - it's too late

Hurt me now if you want to leave my life today
Leave me now as long as you can - please awake
Be your favourite - save yourself - and I must say
Until 10000 years - you're mine - without escape

Sometimes I think I could choose what I hear
But I hear only your voices that drives me to fear
Let's come back to our senses - go away
If you remain then hear my promise - it is too late
