On a picture wink his eyes
Remembrance of him makes you cry
You hold on to a blade of grass
Try to forget your loneliness

If you remain I'll dry your tears
I will kill the strength of fears
I will lift you to the sky
Break the blade and all the lies

I take your fear and take your cries
Release your heart that slowly dies
Grand your wish, that long for love
I take your fear and give you light
Banish the shadow into the night
Grand your wish - I want you
I'll be your new life

A wall of sadness holds me tight
The pure gloss fades into the mirror
Storm releases the rain in my eyes
So savage and real
These are the words - written by you
But I know your face will always shining bright
Your faint dies in my arms and I dry your tears
I think I try it and you try it too
Look into my eyes - see my feelings for you
