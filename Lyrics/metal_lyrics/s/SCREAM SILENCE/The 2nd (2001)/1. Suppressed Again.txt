Light of the sun defeated by the night
A kind of happiness fades to grey
You're wrapped in shadows
Your eyes reflect the light
Sadness twists your face
But you don't cry

Don't suppress your pain

The soft sound of your voice seduces me
I break through the shadows and feel the pain
My consolation will show you the right way
I hold you in my arms and I say

Don't suppress the pain

You hide your tears
Like a treasure in the ocean
Disappeared your smile and your devotion
Please trust in your release and you'll feel the answer
You'll not repent
Your fight is not the end
