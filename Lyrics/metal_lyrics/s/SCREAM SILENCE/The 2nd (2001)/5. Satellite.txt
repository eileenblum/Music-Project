A veil of sadness surrounds your shine
I lead you to the light - but you don't see me
If you choose a different way your heart would burn
Pretty suffering my agony to set me free

My guardian hand so near by you
To join you I touch your silky skin
But you don't feel my endeavour I can't reach you
I watch you - I need you - feel you

I have a dream all the time
It's possible to touch you
Try to forget
A wish deep inside - when I close my eyes
Try to forget

I see you drowning in your tears
Now I feel your fear
Try to forget
Trust me now it passes away
Sometimes comes the day
And you forget
Try to forget
