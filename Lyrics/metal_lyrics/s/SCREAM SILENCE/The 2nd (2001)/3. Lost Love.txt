Come to me and leave
This place of violent cold
I kiss your face till you thaw and dissolve
Lost love wakes up - and my heart
Starts to glow and beats so strong
In the mirror we can see this hellish game

Come to me and enter
This place of violent heat
You kiss my neck till I thaw and dissolve
Hot touches of you drive me mad
Like a savage animal
In the mirror we can see this hellish game

Forever melted together a wish of passion
Forever dies the past
We feel desire defeat the mystic fire
Defeat the lust for more
