Saturday two weeks ago
Your light left me
Tortured in my agony
I'm more than helpless
Sometimes I don't know
What shall I do
Without your wings
I fall into blaze

Monday I try to suppress
My wish to follow you
I've lost my will to live
Without you
Tuesday I must prevent
From drifting away
Today...my pain will fade

Sunday she is gone
And beyond the pain
Covered with flowers
She followed him
The only thing that remains
Four words in stone
Together...forever...in love
