Today you take a piece of sunny life
All the things you want
And allways sunshine in your face
You can show me all your funny lies
Bliss and happiness
I see your despair

You have a crush on harmony
To hide your own reality

Your pretty smile it shines to everyone
Like a blazing star
You camouflage your loneliness
But I feel your helpless greed for love
It's your destiny
It drive's me sad to see your crying smile

All day so heavenly and nice / ich weiï¿½ du liebst es
You'll love it always
All day you show your funny cry

Always a suffering in your eyes / ich weiï¿½ du vermisst es
You'll hide it always

Every day I see you slowly die / nimm ein stï¿½ck von mir
