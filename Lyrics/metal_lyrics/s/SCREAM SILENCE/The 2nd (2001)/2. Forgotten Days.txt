With a pray you leave my life
So many feelings flooding me
I still miss you more and more
In my life
My sadness staying in the rain
So deep the pain inside of me
I'm drowning in my agony
I must release me to be free

I have your picture in my mind
Nothing else remains
You've been the only one
In my life
I'm dependent on your smile
Something in me would like to cry
I believe I would be free
If I left my destiny

I will forget your lovely eyes
I will forget my painful cries
Always the same I feel
Life is a game
I will forget my lonely nights
I'll be living in delight
Always the same I know
Life is a game
