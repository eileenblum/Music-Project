We changed our souls
On a strange place
What's old will be young
What's young will be old
Look my favourite
So old my skin
Life is the taste
That's how I feel

Never before I've so loved my life
I've lost my body and my time
Never before I counted my days
I don't want to see me fade away

I implored him and hold him tight
Please change our souls - give back my life
A smile in your face - so young your skin
He said my life has born a new feeling
