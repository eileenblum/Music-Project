You followed me
With reckless gnosis
Such a free kingdom of haughtiness

(Youâve) owed me trust
And owed me just lies

Such an endless flight

Lasting broken
And never dying

Discover me
In a splendid glory
Where parrots pray
A final rosary

Blue bleeding blasts

In purple skies

With an antic of lies

Such an odious
Paradise

I am your overdose end
And you want to fly
So discover me
And you'll find a place
Where you never die

I am your overdose end
And you want to die
So discover me
And you'll find a place
Where you can fly
