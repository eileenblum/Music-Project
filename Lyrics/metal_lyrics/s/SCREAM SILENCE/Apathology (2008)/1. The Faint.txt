Now you're cowering once more
In corrosive waste
And hesitate like paralysed
To run and to escape

Quietly endure
All this pain
Which quietly creeps
Through your veins

Quietly wear
All these chains
Don't fight the jail
Tooth and nail

Awaiting my upcoming faint
I stumble through the rain
In a godlike complacent grin
Is collapsing my dear feint
