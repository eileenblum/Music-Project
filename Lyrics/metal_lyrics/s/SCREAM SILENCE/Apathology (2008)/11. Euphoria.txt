Flying sparks
We treasured
In jars

Flowing words
Of measures
Surrounded

Flying sparks
Glowing splendid
Beyond
My abandonment

And I close,
In surrender
To yon
My countenance

Ready now - to pass
The threshold
To another realm

Will you all
Endeavour
Someday find your shore?

Will you grant?
Grant me entrance
Clement
When I finally plead

Flying sparks
Glowing splendid
Enlighten
My journey path

Flying sparks
Enlighten
Flying sparks
Flying sparks
And underneath

And underneath
A solemn pleasure
Home at last
Clearness, grace
No return
Glorious
Gratefulness
No return
Marvellous
Beauty place
No return
Purity
Verity
No return
