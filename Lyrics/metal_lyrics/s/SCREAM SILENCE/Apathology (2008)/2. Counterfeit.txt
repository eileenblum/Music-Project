Which day have I missed in sleep?
Since when did you loose your true
Devotion?

I guess it's just the same
Kind - you are mentally disordered
Again

Emotionally disturbed
You're running out
Of glory - and return to soil

Deep in your eyes
Deep in your real emotions
You drowning your lies
In magic potions

Deep in your eyes
Deep in your real emotions
You drowning your lies
In dreary oceans

And clumsy as you are
You've never seen your own distortion

And carry on with hurting
Your inner nerd
Till everything in you is getting calm
