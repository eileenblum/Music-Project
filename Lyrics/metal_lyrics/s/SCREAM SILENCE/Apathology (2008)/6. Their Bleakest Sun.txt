Where to has it driven
Me when I begun to
Share all my wisdom
With another throne of frozen scorn

Why I've never tried to forgive / forget

Who is the one
Who wants to turn out
This gleam, all the bright light
When really all is said and done

And where I've begun
To chase the nowhere

And where I've begun
Like those who're closer

To their bleakest sun
