You call me the waste of your life
A tiny spot and
I call it the spice that you've called to hot

I call it demand of daylight
A piece of real life
But you call it "trust" in dirty hotels

And what I desired my whole life
All I believed in
But I found the truth in the minutes I got

And all I adore
All I would die for
You just take it as a matter of course

Kill and raze me
All of your swearing
Just another
Killing essay

Kill and raze me
Only to give me
Your talion try
For what I've begun

So call me the waste of your life
I call it fate and
Careless and brave I follow behind
