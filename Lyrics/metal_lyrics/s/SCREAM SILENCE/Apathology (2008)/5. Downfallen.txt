[Part One]

When I roam
My delusion fades
And turns bright

All along
Led by my own
Dear denied delight

Now I knee on this broken road
To redemption

And I plead to an unknown god
For enlightenment

In the calm of the storm I found
A reason
To resign

Will I become then an unsold man
And risen
Above

Now I knee on this broken road
To redemption

And I plead to an unknown god
For enlightenment

[Part Two]

I arrived at last

And when the world is broken down
Under legions roaring

I deserve to get calm
And downfallen
