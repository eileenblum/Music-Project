Well I'd never
Well I'd never doubt I'm all alone
Was ever
The one with lack of hope

Well I'd never
Well I'd never disbelieved
In never ever
In never finding the one

When I've ever
Thought my mind twin strolls among
I'd better
Cared for myself

Above the soil of thousand flames
Ten thousand miles with broken wings
Within million roses
The carefully chosen
The only one
Incarnation
