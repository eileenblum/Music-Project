Discovered you're at all just hypocrites
There's nothing left to learn
There's nothing left to yearn

Ever just the very same refuse
There's nothing left to hurt
There's nothing left to turn

Behind my eyes
I'm nearly blind

So call me an unnecessary fault
In your brave new world
Bereaved of faith

What (are) you waiting for
You stare me down
With your frowns
Who starts the final round?

What if you lied
When every scarâs vainly drawn
Until the dolls remain ...

So call me beneath yourselves and misplaced
In your brave new world
Bereaved of faith
