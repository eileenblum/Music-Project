Hate
Is leading my counterpart
Sick and nervous
Can't beat the other

Greed
Is telling the obvious
Teased and bothered
Can't reach further

Dread
Is growing in hour cycles
Bad, mischievous
Effete of grievous

Void
Is leaving me shivering
Bare, uncovered
Until I smother - somewhen

Grief
Will guide me to tearyland
Lone and solus
Despise another one's

Gleam
And follow the other road
Down to father's
Quietly sorrows - somewhen

And when the angels disarmed me
I searched for the yearning
To sleep for a while

And when the anguish
Was growing
I served my demise

Finally
Suffered enough
