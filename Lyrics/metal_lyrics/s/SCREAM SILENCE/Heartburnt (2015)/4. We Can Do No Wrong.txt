It's getting hard to walk alone
I want to know who'll save this soul
It's getting cold here on my own
all these bad days just cut me to the bone

Are you the one - my hope had gone
are you the one - I depend upon

We can do no wrong
getting further from their lies
we can do no wrong
guided by the light in your eyes
so tell me

How can the sun cut through our rain
unless you come this feeling will remain

Are you the one- It's been so long
are you the one - my denouement

We can do no wrong
getting closer to our time
we can do no wrong
guided by the light in your eyes
say it's so
Are you the one?

With you - the world can't hurt us
with you - their words are worthless
with you - I've found my purpose
Are you the one?

Are you the one - my siren song
are you the one - where I belong

We can do no wrong
our wings were clipped but now we'll fly
we can do no wrong
guided by the light in your eyes
tell me though

Are you the one?

With you - all ties are severed
with you - we'll dream together
with you - this day's forever

Are you the one?
