One day
the dark clouds did circle
though I choose to not look so high
as denial was my default

And one day
the voice couldn't stop me
anatrophy deep in the mind
in the dead of night it wakes me
to the blackest room it takes me
just to show how much it hates me

This low
the seventh sorrow
oppressing me more with every blow
as destiny drowns in the undertow
this could be it for me

And one day
I stared far beyond you
to find I was lost in myself
no matter what mask I wore

And one day
the cruel light of mourning
my days were as bleak as my dreams
when I'd suffered one to four
the fifth and sixth hurt more
as the black dog howls at my door

This low
the seventh sorrow
oppressing me more with every blow
as destiny drowns in the undertow
this could be it for me

Helpless one...
