I wander the forest
still under her spell
no pathway to follow
in darkness we dwell
well sleep's never easy
when your days are ill-spent
dreams of boats burning
refuse to relent

The more I try to feign
the less I belong
and the truth is so lonely
when there's only yourself to be strong

It's the end of the lie
nothing is worth more than time
when passion is compromised
it's the end of the lie

The songbird is silent
whenever we approach
her disdain defiant
all three of us know

So the law I must break
as these days are to long
and the roof is so homely
when below me
there's so much that's wrong

It's the end of the lie
nothing is worth more than time
when passion is compromised
it's the end of the lie

It's the end of the lie
nothing is worth more than time
more lament than lullaby
it's the end of the lie

All Sunday a knot deep in my stomach
for the pain Monday's laid in store
with Tuesday to Thursday the poison prevails
then Friday and Saturday
is the torpor
I've come to deplore

It's the end of the lie
nothing is worth more than time
when passion is compromised
it's the end of the lie

It's the end of the lie
nothing is worth more than time
more lament than lullaby
it's the end of the lie
