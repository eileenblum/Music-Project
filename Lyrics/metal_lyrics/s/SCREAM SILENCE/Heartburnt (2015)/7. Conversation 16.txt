I think are the kids in trouble
I do not know what what all the troubles are for
give them ice from their fevers
you're the only thing I ever want anymore
we'll live on coffee and flowers
try not to wonder what the weather will be
I figured out what we're missing
tell you miserable things after you are asleep

Now we'll leave the silver city
cause all the silver girls gave us black dreams
leave the silver city
cause all the silver girls
everything means everything

It's a Hollywood summer
you never believe the shitty thoughts I think
we had friends out for dinner
when I said what I said I didn't mean anything
we belong in a movie
try to hold it together
till our friend are gone
we should swim in a fountain
I do not want to disappoint anyone

Now we'll leave the silver city.....

I was afraid I'd eat your brains
I was afraid I'd eat your brains
cause I'm evil

I'm a confident liar
have ma head in the oven
so you know where I'll be
I try to be more romantic
I wanna believe in everything you believe
I was less than amazing
I do not know what all the troubles are for
I fall asleep in your branches
you're the only thing I ever want anymore

Now we'll leave the silver city....
I was afraid I'd eat your brains
I was afraid I'd eat your brains
cause I'm evil
