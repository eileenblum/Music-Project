Count to ten
again

Your secret life fails to provoke
and how you hate it
but you need drama
here and now
so the knives are out
all around the bed
and what they spell
well it's better left unsaid

Will the weeping ever take it's toll?
I cannot stem the flow
it is keeping me from letting go
of all I can't control
who am I to know

A trembling up
always your chosen weapon
you can't forgive
I won't forget this latest fight
sad but true

Will the weeping ever take it's toll?
I cannot stem the flow
it is keeping me from letting go
of all I can't control
what you reap you sow

Will the weeping ever take it's toll?
I cannot stem the flow
when I'm feeling desperately flow
have you reached your goal?

...who am I to know...
