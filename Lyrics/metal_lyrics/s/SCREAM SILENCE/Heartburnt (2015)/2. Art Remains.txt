They turned my words into a funeral pyre
I'd rather be in exile than a liar
but I'm not ashamed
I believe in all I say
too scare to be afraid
as my truth will find a way

The silver strangers
they dance around the lacerated angels
in the rising flames
nothing can change us
as one we fight despite the deadly dangers
the art remains

A gallery of enemies all wait
to use their sixty different words for hate
and so I play their game
but I will never be enslaved
indissidence we pray
and live to cry another day

The silver strangers
they dance around the lacerated angels
in the rising flames
nothing can change us
as one we fight despite the deadly dangers
but the art remains
but the art remains...

The silver strangers
they dance around the lacerated angels
and fan the flames
so who will save us
injustice for the lustful and the faithless
but the art remains
with hearts untamed
