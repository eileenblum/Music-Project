The final thing on my mind
is hiding from my heart
from the daybreak to the night train
I'm on guard

I sleepwalk to the summer
there's safety in the dark
from the prison you have wisdom
to impart

All I see - echoes of you...

Solidarity in Silence
drifting through the park
but reflections and these questions
cause alarm

Distance istÂ´the devil
I'm numb when it's so far
but the pressures when we're together
bring me harm

That's the downside of my life

All I hear - echoes of you...

It's my life
echoes of you
That's the downside of my life
I'm thinking of echoes of you
