Seventy-nine days since
you pushed away my hand
autumnal fires fading
and muttered words, so sad

Never one to face it
the petals wilt alone
seventy-nine days since
the ghost of a life did call

Memories surround me
'eternally yours' you wrote
the night that the harbour held us
less than a year ago

From the slums to the grandest mansions
I cannot find my place
stunned, I can only wonder
what proved my grave mistake

The street signs cold and distant
the skyline no longer ours
seventy-nine days since
I counted up, not down

Heartburnt
just as you made me
disturbed
but you could save me
and possibly make me return
you know I'm waiting
Hearburnt
won't somebody save me
or self medicate me
please someone awake me
this I yearn

Please somebody crave me
...this I yearn
