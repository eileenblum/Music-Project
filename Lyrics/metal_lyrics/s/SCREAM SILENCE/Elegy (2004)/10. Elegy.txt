A rose of sigh
Is fading on my knees
Of thorns incised when
I broke her down the trees

A shout so quiet
Is shivering in me
And from the far
An elegy

Passing hurts
Like fragrance in a breeze
Is still nourish
My elegy

Sowed the sorrow
On my skin
And broken vows
In endless silence
But the try
To repass
Were a sigh
Just drowned in me

Carry me
In due course
A wee bit reverse...
