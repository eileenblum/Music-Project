Staring bearing
The load of past days
Waiting trailing
Much too many ways

Hiding providing
The next you had to brave
Fading and hating
The robe the past you gave

Come leave the sea
Of burden you trail
Come leave the sea
And raise from the vale

Come leave the sea
And stand upright
To see your sea
From a distant sight

Despising arising
The fate would like to turn
Blessing confessing
The safe you prefer

Wounded and bounded
There's still the hope to flee
The craving for changing
Is yielded by apathy

Every trial
Remain a scar
Of hate and sorrow
On your memories

Like million nails stung
The past in your vein
And then you start
Your proof again
