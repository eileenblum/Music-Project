Gone my nous
Like winds in summer
Blown my waywardness
My vaunt is gone

Blown away
Oh my fairyland
Still wane
Gone in quiet
My passions

Burned out
My desire to steer
Stumble careful
To hide my inner fears

Torn the robe
Oh in gone day I weared
Crawling slow
In myself

I'm getting tired
To follow in
The rising twilights
My courage so waned
