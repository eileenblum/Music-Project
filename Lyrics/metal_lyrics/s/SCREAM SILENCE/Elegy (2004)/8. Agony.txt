Stumble through the night
Rushed like a refugee
So fast will raise the tide
Into her eternity
Above a cruel smile
And among her pale devise
And my sense so paralysed
And the faint is passing by

In the quiet
The time will change it
For a while
Will rule the cruelty your sense
Not a lie
If I crave it
Past a while
My untold passions fade away

The cold is open wide
Her pinions for embrace then
And now I have to hide ...
For the claws of the ferrymen
Above a cruel smile
And among her pale devise
And my sense so paralysed
And the faint is passing by
