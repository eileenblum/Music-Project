Past decades I saw her
By the river

So many trails in vain
But I missed her

But least the sheet has turned
It lasted for a long time

Among the diary tales
Some deliquescent lines

So hurting when I stray behind
It seems so far
And closed forever

So blurry
Is every light
There below
By the unsung melodies

The inner pains were aged
In abandon

The elder fails for long
In oblivion

But least the sheet has turned
It lasted for a long time

Among the diary tales
Some deliquescent lines

After all I sank the wrong lines
Quiet for all times
On the ground
Of my violative soul

Underneath my guarded mind gate
My derailed fate
Just waiting for
Destroying me again
