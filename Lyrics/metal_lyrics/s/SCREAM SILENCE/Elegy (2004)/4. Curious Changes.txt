Blown by the time
Some things that born in a second night
Carried by wings
But yet bereaved

Wayward and weird
I'm just a prisoner of your tears
And slowly my sun
Been disappeared

Away from dawn
I have forgotten to return
It's me again
Cause of some curious changes turn

Sworn at that time
Somehow your promise was in vein
Dreamt by a child
But still deceived
