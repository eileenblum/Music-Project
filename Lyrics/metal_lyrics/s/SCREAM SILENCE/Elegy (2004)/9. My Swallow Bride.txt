Once you fell below
Into my sleep
Just like a fairy

And said you came
To be my bride
Just for these night

You stray around
In covered fears
So quiet and careful

And in your gentle
Hug I'm scared
For the sunrise

You wear so proud
Your feathered wings
When you will flee like a swallow

In armoured breast
There sleeps and rest
Our tomorrow

And when your divine
Kiss sheets me
I'm your companion

The rising twilight is
The witness
Of our bond

For countless moments
We're united
In quiet passion

But our divorce for long
Been sealed when
You've gone beyond

You've gone in silence
With the dawn
And on your wings is flown away
My tomorrow
