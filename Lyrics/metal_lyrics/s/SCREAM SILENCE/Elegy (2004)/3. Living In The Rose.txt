The lovers they kiss and slowly they turn
For drawing a breath there is nothing but time
A thousand million years before
We crash in the sun
And I know we will be still here in her arms

In the thick black night we could lie
In the grass
And gaze at the sky and watch the
Satellites pass
A thousand million miles the earth
She will turn
Then still we will be here in her arms

And if we can float away in our dreams
There's a city that waits under the sea

The days to pass living in the rose
The seeded land slow and old
The scented air heavy and warm
Whispers , touches ....
