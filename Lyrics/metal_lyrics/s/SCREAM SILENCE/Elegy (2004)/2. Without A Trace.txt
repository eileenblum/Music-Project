I know I am gone
On your smile
In terms of temptation
It gives ma a turn
When your glow fuse my illusion

So real so cold please tweak me
Awake my sense
Cant flee I am misplaced
Keep me in suspense

Without a trace of you
Without turn of the tide
I loose the trace of truth
In my own chosen paradise

So real so cold please tweak me
Awake my sense
Cant flee I am misplaced
Keep me in suspense
