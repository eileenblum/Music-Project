Ask me the question
What does it look like on the other side
We have talked about it
It's a completely different world

I stand alone with my thoughts
So many thoughts are alive in my mind
You leave me now without a sign
I want to turn back the time

Why can't you wait, why can't you
Wait, wait 'til the end of time
I don't understand
You and suicide

Ask me the question
What does it look like on the other side
I will conjure you up
Give me an answer

I stand alone with my thoughts
So many thoughts are alive in my mind
I follow you
The time is over without you

I can't wait, I can't
Wait, wait 'til the end of life
I think I have grasp it
I come to your side
