She waits for it for many years
It comes in the shape of a crow
He's got the steel of souls
He wants the sword from you
It's made of dust of souls
He would kill for that

Die
Now it's mine

With the steel he walks away
The might is him
He needs a sacrifice
In order to feel the force
It's made of dust of souls
He wants another heart

Die
Your heart is mine

Feel the steel in your heart
Because he needs your soul
He needs your soul to boost his might
Feel the steel in your heart
You take painful leave
Dust surrounds the sword
Give him force
