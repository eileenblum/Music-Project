My eyes suffused with blood
My head is violated
Emptiness fills my soul
Ponderous is my walk
On the water
I creep on the water of my mind

Darkness all around me
It rules another might
I try to understand
It's a fight without sense
It displaced me
I'm so far away from myself

Sometimes I am caught into a web
A veil surrounds my mind
'cause of a flood of feelings
somewhere is a place where I break down
I am lost in my soul
And nothing I can do

It speaks with my voice
It looks with my eyes
It breathes my air so that I gasp
I try to return in me
I wait helplessly
All of a sudden
I am back
