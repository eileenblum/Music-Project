See the river the deep romantic flow
Find my reason and forget it on the floor
I do everything, it's a try
Follow me if you never want to die
Feel me empty in this horror time
Look to heaven and I hear the chime
It comes the day of my last flight
See the darkness it swallows my cries

I feel the rhythm roll - it was no lie believe me
I hear romantic beauties call - it was no lie believe me
I feel the rhythm and fly with it like a ghost let myself fall
I see the humans cry go through the matter and I feel it all

Go with him
And you can always do and feel the same
I see gigantic tears at the funeral and feel the pain
It's better now to leave this world and all survivors
Get your fear in check and always be good
Say farewell

I feel the rhythm roll - it was no lie believe me
I hear romantic beauties call - it was no lie believe me
I feel the rhythm and fly with it like a ghost let myself fall
I see the humans cry and I feel it all
