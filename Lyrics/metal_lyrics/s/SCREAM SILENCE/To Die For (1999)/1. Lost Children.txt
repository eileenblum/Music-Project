He loves the darkness
In the forest
He is ready for
She's alone
She walks so fast
The forest surrounds her
He feels this young body in his way
She doesn't know he waits behind her

One year of silence
The time has gone
The November nights will come
He is back again
He love it when
He is ready for
She's alone

She was born in September
She is missed since last November
And she didn't have the chance to live her life
Every year he remembers
And comes back in November
Don't go into that forest in this time
