Rhythmical sounds can melt it fast
I hear the devil sing
I wish the evil would die
I know the evil will devour, devour your soul
If you feel romantic
You have found my way
Forget the deep loneliness
Keep the faith in yourself
Please don't cry

Rhythmical sounds is what you need
Do you hear the devil sing
The evil will come out
Cut the rope from your heart...
If you feel romantic
You have found my way
You feel the evil die
Do you see the light
That's your way

Whenever you feel so sad and cry
Whenever you feel the pain
The sound of music will calm you down
The pain will fade lose yourself
Whenever you feel so sad and cry
Whenever you feel the pain
The sound of music is the light
Of your gloomy way

Rhythmical sound is what you live
Do you hear your angel sing
The evil is dying
Feel the pleasure in your soul
Yes you feel romantic
So you have found my way
The sound will never die
Don't listen to what others preach
