Look down at the highway
It isn't pleasant to fall for life
I won't wait eternally
I came to jump
and to feel this hell on earth
I will give it a sign
you don't listen to me
the pain has gone
now it's the time

And when I fall I can feel the fear inside me
And when I fall I can feel the fear inside me
What death brings
I don't know
The highway calls me
And when I die
Everything is peaceful around me

Look at the signs of life and
You can charge his decision
Even a heart fades
Maybe it will collect your love
It starts to beat for you
You go to him and cry
You were never so high
He cries during the fall
"It takes so much time!"

And when I fall I can feel the fear inside me
And when I fall I can feel the fear inside me
Why the time can't stop now
To catch him like a falling leaf
Time stops between us
And forces me
To follow you

And when I fall I can feel the fear inside me
And when I fall I can feel the fear inside me
What death brings
I don't know
The highway calls me
And when I die
Everything is peaceful around me
