Transylvania
1462
The battle was victorious
And she didn't know the truth
The wrong news let her fall
Into a death of damnation
With the force of darkness he took revenge on God
He drank the blood

In the night you see the fog
Bright shine confuses you
You see his eyes and show your neck
Now comes the day of truth
You taste his blood
You are immortal now
You leave God
Into the grave you go

Left from God now
You're cruising through the world
You hide at day
Come out at night
Sleep in the grave and hate the light
You leave the place that's saved by God
Until the real deliverance
You'll need the blood
