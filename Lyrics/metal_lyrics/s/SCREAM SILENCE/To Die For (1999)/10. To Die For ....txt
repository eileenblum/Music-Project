Look into your soul
It's quiet
I'm not sure whether
The sunset will bring
It to the light
My skin so warm

Rigid your face
Your eyes
Are closed forever
It is the time
In there we die
Side by side

It's so dark in this night
So dark in this night

I was born to die for you
We are together
For always and ever I hold you
In my arms
A ray of the sun
It strokes your face
Peaceful forever
To melt together you hold on me
Is there something more

I was born
To die for you
