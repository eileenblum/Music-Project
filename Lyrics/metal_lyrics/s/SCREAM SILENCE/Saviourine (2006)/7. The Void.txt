And when you died
My only aim in live
Your tender shine so warm
Surrounds you
The stormy sky
Was suddenly so quiet
The trees deep bend
Their crowns

And when you laid
So pale in my lap
And when the night so cold
Embrace you
Attempt to cry
Where only void remains
The velvet crape in the storm
Still mourning

And when I try to join you
You seem to dream another dream
Can't find the dream where
A gleam our hope for unity

So fragile
Laid your hand in the mine
So softly stroken by the snow
And there behind
Among the tamed storm
The gleam of hope
Remains

And when I try ...
