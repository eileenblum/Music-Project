Hundredthousendfold
Sweeps the doubt so merciless
Beyond our fragile thoughts
Cherished by in-innocence

And rude we ride our roots
And care the scares we bitterly
Endure devoted to
The thorns of all our wasted tears

And all
Tears we'd undergo
Can't our lies
Countervail in gold

Nous so impetuous
Nous obliged to keep the silence

By the forge of gloom
Quite polite we bear our fears

And all ...

Back from yon
And caught in winter
Turn we on
A circle line
