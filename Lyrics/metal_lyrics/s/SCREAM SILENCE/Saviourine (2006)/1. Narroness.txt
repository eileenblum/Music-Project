Yes I could
Adept myself to crowd
Come down to earth
But it would
Feel like an empty covered
Space and hurt
I would fade to grey
You'll never could
To find me in this sea of grey

And if I would
Be another one
I wouldn't like it
And would change it now
Please yourself
"I change it"
But never would
Like it I'll hate it

Yes I should
Build the wheel
That you can turn the tide
But it would
A bitter setback to my former life
I would fade to grey
You never could
Find me in this sea of grey

My fate to swim against the stream
Through oceans full of glassy meat
Can't return unconcerned
I only drive the chosen path to source

And if you want that i'm another one
You wouldn't like it
And would change it now
Me: died but alive
But never would
Like it you'll hate it

And if I would be another one ...
