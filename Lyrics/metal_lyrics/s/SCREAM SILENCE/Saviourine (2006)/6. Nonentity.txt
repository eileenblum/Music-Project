Catch my fall and
Lay your hand on my eyes
Feel the great of worry
That's too late that I'll be thy

Tender thoughts
I'm so sorry I'm a slave of glacial minds
Some cruelty give raise to
Some restraint for some time

The brand of my down cooled entity
Dim my splendid eyes
My delight turns to apathy
In a sorely sigh

Catch your fall and
Lay my hand on your eyes
Feel your alienation
But can't change it in this time
