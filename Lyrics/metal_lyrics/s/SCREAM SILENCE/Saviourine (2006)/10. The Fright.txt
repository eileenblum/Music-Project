Splendid like a castle in the sun
But painted by the frown of knowledge
I saw myself obliged to running home
Escape from paradise of crampedness

The fright untied
By the gown
They put me on

I wake up with a start and realize
The black hole sun shows truth in my eyes
Rotten to the core it has begun
To bolt kingdom down - the greedy one
