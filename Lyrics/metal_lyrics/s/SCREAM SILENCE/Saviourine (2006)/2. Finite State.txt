The day .. the tears were closer than you ever may
You borrow me your shoulder
Your softly consolation's ended in a kiss
Your tender grace reminds me what I ever missed

The unfelt force
Just like an inward calling
An eternal falling
"within the night"

Of our recourse
Call of your inner yearning
Just the dawn is warning
That our journey is finite

The fate ... was merciful and made you to my mate
The night is getting colder
Your purity is lying undressed next to me
Your taste were so delightful in our unity
