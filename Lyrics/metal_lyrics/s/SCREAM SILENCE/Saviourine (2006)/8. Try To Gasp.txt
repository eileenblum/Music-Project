Encased
In thorns of blame
Can't turn the tide
The burden trail

And I drown in me
So cold

When fades a direful second
Like a grave sight to behold inside
And kept me imprisoned
While the crowd around proceed in pride

Cursed of life and living
Tenebrous and cold below
Perish me with forgiving
But ain't let me go

And I drown in me
So cold
And my mind bleeds
So sore

And I gaze
At my disgrace
