So cold and demanding
Were the days of our divorce
Our realm pretended
In the guise of many faults
See our house abandoned
Due our own inane divide
Rearrange our bound to
Stray away to hide in lies

I'll take you home
We're stranded on the trail
Lean you on
I'll guide you through the vale

I close my eyes and
Stay imagine for a while
Reminisce still grieved and
Try to trace another trail

Felt myself abandoned
Like a tear never been dried
Rearrange our bound to
Stray away to hide in lies
