You've been there so pure and bare
As long as I remember
You roam into and passing through
In every of my slumber

Your graceful charm
Keeping me warm in all these nights
But every dawn
Blows out our home of candlelights

Beloved
Sweet curse

Below the lines
Of my desire
I'm still waiting

Can't pull the wires
But yearn you're my
Empress goddess saviourine

Your lovely kind just in my mind
The reason of my poems
But inner gloom
That writes the tune only remains

Beloved
Sweet curse
