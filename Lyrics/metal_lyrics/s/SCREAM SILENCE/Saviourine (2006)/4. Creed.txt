Endearing poems of you
Will wipe my faults away
Your gently caress can
Disarm my doubts of faith

And while you elsewhere fuse
In nameless loathsome tales
I plead for twilight come
That brings me back my maid

Forever and ever
Enslaved by your heart
Forever my destiny
And sometimes
They try to tear us apart
But never they break our creed
