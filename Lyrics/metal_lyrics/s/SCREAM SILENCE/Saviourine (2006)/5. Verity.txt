Guarded by your rood
Your pretended innocence
So indescent and rude
Your greed for endearment

You can follow every lane
But there's no trail
I'm not your muse

You can try it to explain
But that's in vain
This is for sure

Your infinite demand
So boring and embarrassing
Your craving for advance
Just nourish my denial

There is no need to follow
My fairway so blind
'cause there's a lot you don't know
In the scenery behind

There is no trail
Please stay away
You can just fail
Please stay away

You can follow ...
