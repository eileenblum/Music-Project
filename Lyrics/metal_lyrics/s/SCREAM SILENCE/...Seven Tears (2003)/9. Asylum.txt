be my fellow through
the frozen pale
and in the purple tune
my nightingale

send me an echo when
the curse begins
i need your confidence
to all my sins

conceal my trace
conceal my vault
conceal it tender at your soul
conceal my face you're my
hideaway

come seal my veils
conceal my wound
conceal the poems at your tongue
conceal my face you're my
hideaway

dont let the crowd close to
my consecrate
they just want detain you
to elevate

stay in oblivion
until i call
and if i crown my sin
the veil will fall
