your pretty eyes
give the show away
you feel the want of be beloved
i wait and see

a consent nod by you
and close by me
i see your promising winged eyes
and hear a softly melody

a timid try
to fly away
and close clasped to reach the sky
without return

a pleasant dream
arised in minds
woken up by confusion
and past the night

a veiled silhouette of you
i fear, it's just a second dream
i feel force
to close my minds
and hear a softly melody

a timid try
to fly away
and close clasped to reach the sky
without return
