i would you embrace
my dearest type
but i have to flee
save myself and hide

got lost in my minds
what happens last time
but i can't breathe
without you -
my life

but i can't breathe
like an disliked child
don't want be
wounded deep inside
you in my arms
just once in a lifetime
i can't breathe without you

you could me embrace
my dearest type
but i treat you as
you bereave my life
you could go away
to not waste your time
but i can't breathe 
without you - 
my life
