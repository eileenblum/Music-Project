how should i know
where's the place where fade the stars
how should i know
how it feels to live in tide as last

how should i know
how it feels to dive in the sky
how should i know
how it feels to escape

i can't slip away.....

just a wee bit to rest
take my hand - let us twosome flee home
seven tears
melt away by your grace
how you sleep warm and safe
please agree....


how should i know
that the cold would pass me by
and how shall i sleep
on a final lullaby
