sometimes turns my mind in circles
sometimes stops my mind to breathe
can i see you for a moment 
to enjoy our own apart
then i feel 
something must be done with me

torn the time on the quiet
don't want leave you on the side
a part of life is gone so fast
can't believe it falls apart

when i've gone my way in honour
when i've found my faith in truth
can i see beyond your contempt
to enjoy our own apart
then i feel 
something must be done with me
