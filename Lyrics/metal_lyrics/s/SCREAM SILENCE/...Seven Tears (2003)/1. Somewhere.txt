if you say it is insane
that i remain
i'll go away even i'll say 
it is mistake
our voiceless vote
an inward fraud
to cut our tie
i concolate myself and wait
in deep desire

somewhere / somehow
i'll get you see
in my isolated mind
in my dreamtown
i'll get you see
you could cross my way again

well it's my fate if i fail
to resign 
so i can hide &amp; simply wipe
my wounds inside
