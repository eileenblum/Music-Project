the more i try 
the less i cant heal
you deny
the place where i can breathe
cause you're my blaze 
select me and i'm thy
there's no more grace 
to trail away with me
i want to be

in your arms 
will fade my cry
please let us passionate fade 
please hold me tight
in your arms
i'm save and i
i'm on the verge of tears 
and hold you tight

a careful smile 
can't open up my seals
but all the lies 
was written in a tear
behind your veil
is vanishing your shine
so bare and pale
eternal we're assigned
in our minds
