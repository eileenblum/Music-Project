roam inside and read in
my own lost memories
but i'm too weak and frantic
to raise up from my knees

restricted range of vision
let me flee
it's not my own decision
so answer me

until you respond
i don't will surrender
until you respond
will lies be the truth
until you respond
you're still the pretender
until you respond
my eyes stare confused

you ram inside and hidden
your sincere reality
it seems that it's forbidden
to answer me

strange conduct i feel
and presently
i need a truth decision
so answer me
