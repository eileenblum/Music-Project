mourn ....
is all you've left behind in me as token
vows ....
you swore to me in past were broken

proud ...
of your regained elevation
bow ... 
me to your vanity

just let me still cry
don't teach me with lies
will forgive if can justify

just let me still cry
don't teach me with lies
i'll send you in the eternal exile

torn...
my confidence in your devotion
worn
was thrown away without a wee emotion

your eloquence
has disappointed all my sweet illusions
your ignorance
has extinguished my blaze
