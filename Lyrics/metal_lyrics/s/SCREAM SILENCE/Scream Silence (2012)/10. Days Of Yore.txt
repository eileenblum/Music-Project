Moments, when shades disappear
Unthorned minds - left behind
Emphasize the color of lies
In arms of Morpheus
Sun-drenched, within..

Between the days I swore
I'm waiting
But times are changing

In between days of yore
My craving
So I'm still waiting
Here to set ashore

By gone and faded, but here
I treat you carefully, handsome but weird
Paralyzed, I can't define
Am I wasting efforts
I'm in two minds
