A calling forces me to roam
Steadily change my base of home
Steadily grows the call of wideness
Always

And fall into my love
Cage of equivocation
Dance with the shades and I deny it
Always

I guess I'm
Sold out
In the lie-house-store
Hence I cry out so loud
Behind sky-high walls

And on the knees I saw
Underneath - a fragile soul
But steadily grows the call of wideness
Always

And back from journey's trail
Grows again - want to bewail
Dance with my shades but I deny
Always
