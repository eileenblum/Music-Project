A blade run
Under pale moon's lullaby
Fate's trail
Unresolved
The ferryman
Heads to what he blindly finds
And carries
Unleashed fright
Untied

On the road of eminence
I pass your homes
Forced by anarchy
I'll claim your thrones

And I want everything
And want it twice
One, two.. anything
Just never mind!

Lay down
In the wide euphoria's ground
And keep calm
You deserve divinity you gained by me... now
