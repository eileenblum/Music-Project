Time, gleaned in jars of adamant
A moment lasts eternal innocence

Unknown reveries in solemn grace
An untold solace in embrace
Time is whispering all alone

And when the birds in their rows
Are letting me all alone 
Oh what a joy to behold
My wings yet unfurled... alone

And tired as we are now
We can't follow the sparrows

And their promised land
Lies solitary in the sand
And we're singing higher vows alone
