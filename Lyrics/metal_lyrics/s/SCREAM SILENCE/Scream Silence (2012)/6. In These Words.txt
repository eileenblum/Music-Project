We were so wide-eyed
Like a fairy child
We were infantile
Danced the roundelay
Of decadence
In rain

Whenever we started to follow the reign
So blindly into another disdain
And the withered leaf
Of kindness brought us to that state

And we want to elope
But we're stunned
Beyond our nous

In these words, a calling for salvation - no doubt
We're close to drowning 
In these words, awoken many questions - and now
We're forced to turn back
Time - so unable to answer a child

Who are the leading
And who's asking why
And who starts to ease this onus of mine

And we want to elope
But we're stunned
Beyond our nous
