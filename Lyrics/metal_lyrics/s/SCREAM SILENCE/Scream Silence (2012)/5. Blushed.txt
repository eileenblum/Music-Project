An endless day has called my name
My feelings stunned in this frigid zone
So make me rave, till I proclaim
In misleading calm I'm blushed all over

You blow my mind but I'm trying to remain sober
But my free will's lost, because of the signs of your denial

I shake the days, choose one to be brave
Let wild birds fly, I tamed prior
You send a smile, even before your strict denial
Treat me with scorn and spend a crown
Oooh does that mean no?
Can't sort out if you're sore or what you adore
Can't resist the lure
Want to remain sober- I'm blushed all over
