Nice and boring is the race
Twice I've lived before this game
Was always waiting for saviour's hand
Was always sailing in the water-land I drowned in

Want turn to the upside
When all the bills are paid
Want to learn from last time
My try was cursed to fail
Escape the downside
Relief so close at hand
If I climb to upside it now seems
To turn upside down

Dead, the yearning and the chase
For spice to season gloomy days
And still I'm waiting for saviour's hand
Further sailing in the water land I drowned in
