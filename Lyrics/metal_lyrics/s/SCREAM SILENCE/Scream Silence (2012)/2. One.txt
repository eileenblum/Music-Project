And when
You start to build a fortress
Around our inner sense
And closed all doors just
Wordless

And when
I even tried to force these
Unnecessary lies
And totally unconscious
It creeps into my mind...

The sum of my faults is one
That's what remains
And forged in a solemn tone
I said the wrong

The sum of my faults is one
That's what remains
And forged in a solemn tone
I can't revoke some words
Can't even make undone
This curse

In vain
Was everything I've done then
The lessons and efforts
And some day I got conscious
And can't go back to start

And I plead to the sun
But can't make undone
This curse
I despise the sun
Still can't make it undone
This curse
