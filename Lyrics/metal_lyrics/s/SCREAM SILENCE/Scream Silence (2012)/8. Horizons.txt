In our cold innocence
Summon the wisdom we caught in a sigh
And the signs lead the way
Where the great distance turns wrong into right

And if you're watched by those who're waiting above
For faults just to justify
Buried deeper in time
Within the colours of intimate nights

Would you dance to horizons
Where I cover you warm through the gathering storm
When we cannot defy them
We follow the road of aspiration - to a place called
Unknown

If you grow desperate
Because of the knowledge that's whispered by time
Catch these thoughts that I send
And cherish the flight from darkness to light
