They fear the little faults
Don't notice they are wrong
'Cause faults will make you strong
So stay near by me I'll show you
What million faults have done
With me, what I've become

Me God- order- new flood

When it has begun-
No return!

The overrunning raging feelings let me
Frown
I close my eyes and feel the fright

Look they- just a little crowd...
Want nothing else but
To save their clobber stuff
