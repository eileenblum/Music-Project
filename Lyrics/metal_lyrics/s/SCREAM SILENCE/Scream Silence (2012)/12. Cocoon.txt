Sometimes I want to restart
When I am ready to fall
And wide, I open my eyes
There,s a need to restart
If only I could leave my life

And wiser
I'll become

And I'd gaze to the skyline
And watch from the sideline
I'd follow old joined trails
If I
Would get a restart

Sometimes I want to belong to
Another kind of someone

And wiser
I'll become

And I'll gaze to the sky
And watch from the sideline
And I'll follow the joined trails
And become a swan
I'll watch from the skyline
Beyond from home
When I'm leaving soon...
Respawn
I'm close to restart

Sometimes I guess
Somehow I will
Somewhere or here
When I have learned to start again
Somewhen
