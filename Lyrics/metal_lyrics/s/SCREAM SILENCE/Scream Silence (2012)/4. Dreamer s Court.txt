Once I dreamt of thoughts
of a sea that mellowly hurls
me in a dream and if I was awake
I was not sure

and a stranger from beyond
the mirror told he wants to
tell me how I could dream my thoughts
and I was sure

I went to the seas and went much deeper
and there underneath was the dreamerâs court
I went to the seas and stayed so long
I could hear the dreams as they soared to foam
in recurring thoughts

Once I waked and thought
that Iâm dreaming and Iâm caught
in a dream and never can break-out
but Iâm not sure
