How can we exist without the air to breathe?
How can we exist without the water?
Apocalypsed we are now....
Without respect
Without love
How can we exist without earth to sow?
How can our dreams exist if we can't stand the sun?
How can we exist without the forest?
How can we exist without the animals to learn?
For how long we will exist without respect?
How can we exist alone?
Salvation is humility
Salvation is union
Salvation is respect
