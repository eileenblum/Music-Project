Karma is not individual, it is total
Each man is not an island, we are a huge continent
We are a piece of the whole, we are all connected
When something good happens, the whole vibrates as consequence
When something bad happens, the whole vibrates as consequence
Each human being is a particle of the drama
Each one is the destiny of the whole
When a cell becomes sick its alike becomes sick as well
There is only one energy that connects all the creatures
Discord echoing discord
War echoing war
Conscience echoing conscience
Peace echoing peace
