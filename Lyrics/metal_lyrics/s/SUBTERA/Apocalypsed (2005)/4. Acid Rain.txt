Future is a mirror reflecting the past
Holocaust have been repeated day by day
Vital energy of the planet feeding the pacts of war
The smoke of burnt bodies spread through the air
The world agonizing in silence while exploitation goes on
Living the present with feelings of nostalgia
The laws created by man contradicting the laws that created man
As acid rain our faults falls over our heads
Cathedrals have been edified with fire for the new bloody Masses....
