Time has gone and no one realized that
A future which now is present built through intense devastation of the natural essence
Just individuality survived so far, and now??
We wont believe in false promises no more
Cause now we are able to listen life asking for help
We wont believe in false promises no more
Cause now we are able to feel the truth pulsing in our hearts
We wont wait for a better world
Cause this world has been built by all of us
It is necessary that each one walk step by step
In the course of destruction of the altars of pride
Preparing the journey for the new destiny
