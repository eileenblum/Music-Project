Intelligence doesn't deserve confidence
This progress is doom - This progress is our ruin
Conscience doesn't accompany
The technologic advance
Scientists playing with dangerous energies
(the universe polluted by human unconsciousness)
Defying with arrogance the natural laws
We go on to the final phase (of our existence)
Everything has been extincted by man's hand...
And man won't be an exception...
