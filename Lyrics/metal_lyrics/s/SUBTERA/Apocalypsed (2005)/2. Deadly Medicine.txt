Winds of death producing richness
Human body as profit source
Massive poisoning in the name of cure
Spreading disease to the business maintenance

World population taken hostage by the dominant industry
Bizarre politics of people mistreat
Organic death - Rest for desperation
Crime against humanity
Exterminaton
Deadly medicine
In the time of the rising truth greedy actions will be a shame
