Desperation through the air and life goes on in insane delight
Marketing of vanity transforming people into disposable dummies
Choice for the wrong perpetuating the darkness
Blinded by modern perversion
Anti-natural dogmas followed without question
Empty needs hyped in massive lobotomy
Capacity reduced to banality
Emotional explosion creating this chaotic balance
People paying for the show of his own decadence
