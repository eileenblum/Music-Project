Humankind suffering for the internal war of insecure leaders
Emotional agression transformed into devastation
Phobic fear creating tecnologies of war
Abnormal savagery slaughtering whose for long had been surrended
Creating the enemies to justify the fear
Schizophrenic protection - long distance massacre
Piled bodies in greedy fields
Rivers of blood flowing through filthy hands
Insane laughs echoing in the darkness
