Before the walls of Antioch
Dust clouds carry...
...a bloodlust unrivaled
Artah had fallen
An Elysium shield
To our Syrian jewel

Frankish abominations
Cut down our innocent
The spear is risen
Said to be of longinus
Their mission now "holy"
Our lives now worthless

The desert now bleeds
A torrent of suffering
Into the southern sacred
Into the heart of faith
