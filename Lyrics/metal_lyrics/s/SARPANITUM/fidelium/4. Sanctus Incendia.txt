"We have been blessed
With the honour of serving
Under the banner
Of the wrathful forger of earth

We strive for his glorious name
To echo throughout the vast desserts of sin

With the light of our father behind us
We rid the civilized of those who desecrate his holy name

The disciples of our master have spread
Their teachings to those in need of salvation

Those who deny these righteous psalms are cleansed by the wrath of our holy fire!"
