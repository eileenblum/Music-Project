Torn from the ravaged lands of my fathers
Raised gossamer entrails to the sun
Clandestine apparitions guide my blade
Into the heart of malign pestilence.

Brothers under the golden cross
Decimate the marauders of sin
Unfettered light banishing
Miasmic binding our our holy places

Entrenched in the fortress of the lord
Encompassing holy light built of centuries
Blazing across desolate oceans of sand
Steadfast, unwavered, righteous

They will know
We will send them to god
We will send them unto torment
They will beg for divine forgiveness
And renounce their reprehensible path
But none shall they receive
