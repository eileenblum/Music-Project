Created of clay and deity's blood
Born beneath and as servants of Anu
Endlessly vast is the supreme ruler
To live is to serve the divine ones

Their slumber is unsettled
Their slumber is disturbed
Your lives must come to an end
Your lives will come to an end

Pestilence upon mankind
We strike you down in disease and filth
Left to die amongst myriad carrion
A multitude of decaying cadavers

Pestilence upon mankind
We strike you down in disease and filth
Left to die amongst myriad carrion
A multitude of decaying cadavers

Devourment of dying offspring
Barren oceans of salinated harvest
It seems as the gods have forsaken man
As they starve beneath Anu

It seems that the gods have forsaken man
As they starve beneath Anu

Pestilence upon mankind
We strike you down in disease and filth

A multitude of decaying cadavers

Devourment of dying offspring
Barren oceans of salinated harvest
It seems as the gods have forsaken man
As they starve beneath Anu
