Almighty Tiamat, serpent goddess,
Adorned resplendently in burning rage
Harbinger of impious hordes,

Her asperity sickens the grandest of divinity

Bel of Babylon
A deity to ascend the pantheon
To slaughter the celestial abhorrence
To yield dominance beyond imagination

Through slaughter comes prosperity
An age of abundant ataraxia
Creation flows from the veins of Tiamat
From victory comes supreme sovereignty

Bel of Babylon
A deity to ascend the pantheon
To slaughter the celestial abhorrence
To yield dominance beyond imagination
To yield dominance beyond resurrection

Through burning storm clouds and cascades of arrows
The blood of Kingu was spilled
The broken wreckage of the serpentâs carcass
Wept blood and viscera, from the carnage of flesh the earth arose
