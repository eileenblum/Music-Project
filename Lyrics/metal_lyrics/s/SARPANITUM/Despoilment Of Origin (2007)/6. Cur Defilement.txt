The sonant of The Sun God, brother of thine
The sonant of The Sun God, I entrust in your wisdom
âHe who was born from a fertile wombâ
âHe who was conceived on the sacred marriage throneâ

He will meet your carnal desiresâ¦

Seduction of the Sumer belle
Dumuzi waited expectantly and zealous
To him, you gave everything
Surrounding asylumâs flourished as her womb craved his delight

He, now a caliph, a deity from once a mere man
He will abuse his eminence, self-gratify
No longer will he cede all his self to thy nymph

He answers to none, betrayed she does feel, rancour is overdue

Strike Dumuzi down, coward she once loved
Give him no utopia

The mercy of Utu, saved his craven tears
Hands became of coils, feet of a serpentine

Absconded from his demonsâ¦ to him, they could not adhere
