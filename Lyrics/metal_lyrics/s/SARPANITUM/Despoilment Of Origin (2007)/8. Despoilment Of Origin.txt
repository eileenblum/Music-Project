He is your beloveth, He is your kindred breath
Traverse the cosmos you will passage to thy sacred Abzu
For He shall be eager for your sojourn
Enki knows all, He awaits with tender ovation
for His words compelled to be hearkened

Stripped she has become of her mortal clothing
Disrobed, The Goddess of Earth, forsaken as at birth

Power you succumb from your father
He has blessed lamentations so divine

To Her, His cherished hand is purulent
The manus which let her lapse
Against all inclinations
This She finds onerous to condone

Power you succumb from your father
He has blessed lamentations so divine

From her fair head, shugurra abstracted
Stripped she has become of her mortal clothing
Disrobed, The Goddess of Earth, forsaken as at birth
She enlists the throne room bowed low

Rise up from thy throne
Leafless origin arched before thy eye
Passing judgement
The Annuna are unflinching
Surrounded she withers
Starring eye ordains her passing
She spoke against
Her the word of wrath
She uttered against
Her cry of guilt

He is your beloveth, He is your kindred breath
Traverse the cosmos you will passage to thy sacred Abzu
For He shall be eager for your sojourn
Enki knows all, He awaits with tender ovation
for His words compelled to be hearkened

Diverge into carcassâ¦ lynched to the wall
