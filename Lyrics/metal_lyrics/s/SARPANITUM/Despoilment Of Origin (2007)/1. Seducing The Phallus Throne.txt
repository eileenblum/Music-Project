From the opus hands of Araru
Correlation of mass and mana
In hope that fate would forgather
No dissension more sublime

Obverse ideals one with thy creatures
Raw and pure as the clay he engendered

Chastity
Raped by courtesan lust
Chastity
Raped by courtesan lust

Shamhat exuded seduction
He could not stonewall
Dehiscent robes revealing desires
Taken by unworldly pleasures

Stripped of all strength he once retained
Impoverished, his wild beasts have deserted his side

The altercation of such conscripts
Dually concluded with the wild splendour
Enkidu respectfully yielded his triumph

Chastity
Raped by courtesan lust
Chastity
Raped by courtesan lust
