To Kurnugi
Land of no return
Ishtar daughter of sin determined

To the darkhorse, dwelling of Erkalla's god
Where dust is their food, clay is their bread
Clothed like birds, with feathers
They see no light, they dwell in darkness

To the darkhorse, dwelling of Erkalla's god
They see no light, they dwell in darkness
Where dust is their food, clay is their bread
Death shall outweigh life
Clothed like birds, with feathers
Open your gates for me
They see no light, they dwell in darkness
Shatter the bolt, smash the door

Open your gates for me to come in
Shatter the bolt, smash the door
Raise up the dead
Eat the living
Death shall outweigh life

Disease of Man
Disease of Mankind

As soon as Ishtar went down to Kurnugi
Ereshkigal looked at her and trembled before her
Ishatar did not deliberate but leant over (her)
Ereshkigal made her voice heard and spoke

Disease of the eyes to her
Disease of the feet to her
Disease of the heart to her
Disease of the head to her
Diseaseâ¦

Open the gate, smash the door in the eye

To the darkhorse, dwelling of Erkalla's god
Where dust is their food, clay is their bread
Clothed like birds, with feathers
They see no light, they dwell in darkness

Thou shall not rob me of my only brother

Seven... Gates of Kurnugi
Shall be... opened before you
