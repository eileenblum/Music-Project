I, Urban 
By His decree
Ambassador with a divine admonition to you
The servants of God

Oh race of Franks
From across the mountains
Race chosen and beloved by God
Shine forth!

All who perish at the hands of these demons
Shall have remission of sins
I grant them His divine blessing

Eradiation of our kind
By flame, arrows, and steel
Let the deeds of our forefathers incite you

Holiest of places now swarming
With disgrace and filth
We shall proclaim this land!
Deus Vult! 

Whoever shall determine uponâ¦
Shall display the cross

Eradiation of our kind 
By flame, arrow, and steel
Let the deeds of our forefathers incite you

âHe that taketh not His cross and followeth after me is not worthy of meâ.

DEUS VULT!
