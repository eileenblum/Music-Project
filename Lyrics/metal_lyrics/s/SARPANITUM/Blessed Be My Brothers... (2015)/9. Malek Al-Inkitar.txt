Abandoning dynastic providence
Disuniting Ayyubid elation
Once driven forward to the depths
The lion descends upon the death!

Replenishing the weary
A renewed Frankish piety
Acre groaning in chains
Dragged to the feet of God!

Betrayed of the mind
Betrayed of the heart
Betrayed of the soul
We remain Godless

âAlors que non lames
fondent sur leurs c
ranes Dieu nous a
quitteâ

A predator beyond 
rank or reason
Here to reclaim
Here to decimate

Betrayed of the mind
Betrayed of the heart
Betrayed of the soul
This time of war
Calls not for weakness 

Rewards beyond 
comprehension 
awaitâ¦
