Dragged through oceans of flayed brethren 
Seething my anger, failed by weakness
I rest this frail battle-worn frame
Cascades of the slain thy cradle

Visions of benevolent vistas
Of home, dear ones, and vitality
I rejoice in rapturous splendor
Only to find unearthly horror

Humbled by monolithic death-mounds
Put to torch, ablaze with the hatred of men

Such is the end of the desert cast
Dusts of man befall the sands
Now lost amongst the grains

The many faces of those we have taken
Taunt and lead us this day
Into the rapacious maw of the dunes
