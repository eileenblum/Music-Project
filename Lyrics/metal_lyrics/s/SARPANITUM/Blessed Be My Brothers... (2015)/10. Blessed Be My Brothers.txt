Crushed under the siege wheels of
Salubiyyunn
Blessed be my brother
On this night of regnant massacre
For our hearts are with him

Shed not a single tear
On this night we ascend to paradise
Sons of Al-Muqaddagah wrought death
Our devotion abounds and shines immortal

My Majaahiduun!
Our spellbound
victory rings infinite
Blessed be my brothers
In eternal 
magnificence 
we reign 

My Majaahiuun!
We leave this place
Prepare tormentors 
of holiness
For fathomless evil
shall befall you!
