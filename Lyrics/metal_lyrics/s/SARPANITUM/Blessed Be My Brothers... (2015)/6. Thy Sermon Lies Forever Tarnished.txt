Hattin, Tiberias, July 4th, 1107
-Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub, Al-Muzaffar Taqi al-Din Umar,
Guy de Luisgnarn, Renard de Chatillion, Raymond III of Tripoli-

Twist Kurun Hattin,
A knight devout in enacting haditho,
Warrior of divine emanation,
In the throes of Frankish abandon, 
Homeland awash with rotten decadence,

Mighty Ayyub!
Sultan sculpted from the rock of war
Visions of unity under al as-sunnah,
Divinity absent from shi atu ali

Reddened steel held aloft in praise
Reclamation for the beloved
A peace pursued in death, not obtained in life
Mounds of Masiheyin dead lay in monument,

A lord risen from the Poitevin Maroh,
King in the heart of the world
Led astray, blinded by Nasara nor
Brought before the peerless Ayyubid

Impoverished golden legions cut down
The caddish cruciform blight removed 
âIt is not the want of a king to kill a kingâ¦â

âBesigata Dishmaya
Kul shain khatara!â
