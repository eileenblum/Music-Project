Finally takenâ¦

Bathing in our crimson guilt
Scurried, acrid, infested
No semblance of soul
A barren collective
A truth aligned with the boundless 
The outer-worlds speak of it in death-dreamsâ¦

Grand Abyss Lurkers
Now to him!
For He is wretched
And many have paid the price

Minds are spun in coils of horror
Sanity bleeds from un-hearing ears
A madness wrought from His countenance alone
Rebelled are you, great Abyss Lurkers!

A brief moment of eternity
The outer-worlds speak, we see it!
For we are now infinity
We are released
Death is no end for us
All-knowing infinity is the only truth
