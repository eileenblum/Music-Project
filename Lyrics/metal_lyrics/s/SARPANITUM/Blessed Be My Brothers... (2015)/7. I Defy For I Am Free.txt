Antioch, December 1097-April 1099
-Peter Bartholomew-

Fevered maddening 
Divine vision
Among the lost
I surely belong

I see it!
I BEG OF YOU!
Through spears of golden light
I am reborn!

Desperately clutching
To your magnificence
I am your vessel
Never release me

On this you thrive
The howling of death
Echoes through your golden halls

Though spears of golden light
I must flee your nefarious grasp
Your kingdom of lifeless husks 
I force you to release me!

I have spent too long
In the company of death
Rent open the innocence of life
Now bereft of all but malign wickedness

I commit my body to the flame
For I am free!
To the one I despise
To YOU the ONE
I defy you
For I am free!
