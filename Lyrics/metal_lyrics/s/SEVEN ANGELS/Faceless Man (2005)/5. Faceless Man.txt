Somewhere, far away, sometimes I hear you say
Thoughts were throwing me, IÂ´d lost the way to be

Dark Horizon, distant sun, cold nights on the hill
Cries in my heart, human blood on me
Pain and guilt are crushing me, slicing my soul
I am still waiting to know what it means

Shadows are flying, the sun rises over me
Sometimes I hope to know who I am

Oh! Oh Lord! Show me my face
Let me know the deepest thoughts of your creation
I lost (what I) never had

Running away from killing words
I can feel
The sun heating my skin
The Mirror reflecting my face
I canÂ´t look at what I see

I donÂ´t recognize Who I see
I am nothing without you
I donÂ´t recognize Who I am But IÂ´m not a Faceless Man

Somewhere, far away, I hear you say
I lost the way (but) IÂ´m not a faceless man
