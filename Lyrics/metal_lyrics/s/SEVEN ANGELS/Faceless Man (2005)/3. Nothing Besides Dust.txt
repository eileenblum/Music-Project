One more day I lived to pay
my big Mistakes, sweet bitterness
Everyday I wake up and
remember what a fool I've been

I know you told me that
I was out of my mind
I know, you told me what to do

But everything you told me
I already knew
And even so, I sign my sentence

It looks so sweet, It seems to be right,
All I've done
But I forgot to look through my pride,
My life is rotting cause
I was not able to look above

Even if you can't see
nothing besides dust
You can still, you can still blow
