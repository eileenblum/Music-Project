[Said GOD to Moses and to Pharaoh]
Now I say, and you have to obey
Listen to me now, listen to my word
Now I Say: "Let my people pray"
They have to praise me at the desert land

[Pharaoh to God]
Who are you? I'm the King of Kings
Here, I made the law, you are in my Kingdom
Who do you think you are
To tell me what to do? Now you'll feel the power, my anger and my hate

[People to Moses]
Do you know what you have done?
you give our soul to misery
Do you know the punishment we suffer?
day after day, night after night...

[Moses]
I cry for freedom, rising to the sky my supplication
trusting in Your promises

[GOD to Moses]
No matter how much
Anger and vengeance fall over you.
YOU HAVE MY WORD

[Moses]
Why did you send me?
The sword of death is piercing my soul
People are crying, children are dying
Save us
