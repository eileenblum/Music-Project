Higher than the sky,
I found myself when my rebirth came true
I found in you
How long
I've been looking for this way

I Remember a long way back, years ago
What I saw, disgusts me

My lifeÂ´s nothing more than I deserved
All I owned (is a) handfull of sand

Voices, whispers, sometimes
I hear you call
Feelings, caress, are coming
the days that I will fly

Stand up and raise your guns
Look at evil, evil's face
And put the fear of God into your destiny, 
make true the victory
