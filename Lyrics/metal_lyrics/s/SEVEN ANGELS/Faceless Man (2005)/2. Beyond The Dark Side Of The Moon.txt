No one can see down the ages
Feeling, the cold wind blow
No one wants to be in hell
Feeling the fire burning your heart

I can understand
That I can choose
Between you and me
ThereÂ´s no deal

You tried to buy my silence
You stole the words from my mouth

I can understand
That you canÂ´t choose
You sold your soul
But I donÂ´t wanna go

Beyond the dark side of the moon

The sun shines no more
Music sounds no more
No more, no more, nothing more
Time goes on, life goes on
I donÂ´t realize
