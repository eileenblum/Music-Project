Sleeping and dreaming
Laid down on a drifted boat
The wind still blowing
The storm is over us

He opens His arms
And speaks to the wind
And speaks to the storm
He speaks to the sea

IÂ´m the Son, IÂ´m the Son
I am the Son of God

What kind of man is He?
What kind of human being?

Walking over all the seas, still am I, the Son of God
Stand up and close the door behind you

Today, I say, The words I have to pray
You hear, you know you kill me day by day
You know the way I left my blood in you
I died and agonized but you spit on me
