Falling from my face
Reflecting my biggest mistake
I canÂ´t live without you

Covering my eyes
Making me blind, night after night
I canÂ´t live without you

IÂ´ll have a chance if the sun shines again
But rainÂ´s falling over me
IÂ´ll have a chance If I look at me
I know YouÂ´re seeing me

If I could fly to the sky
Look through Your eyes
If I could live inside You
Nobody wants to live alone
