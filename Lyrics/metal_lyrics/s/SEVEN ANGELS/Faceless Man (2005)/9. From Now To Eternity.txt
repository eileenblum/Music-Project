Walking by my side (IÂ´m here)
I saw what you prepared for me
And IÂ´m not a fool
I can Resist

Gone are the days when I was afraid
Now IÂ´m powerfull and strong

My lord is victory
Not one more fantasy
I know that I can be
The conqueror
My eyes are burning
My blood keeps running
My soul still flying
(from) now to eternity
