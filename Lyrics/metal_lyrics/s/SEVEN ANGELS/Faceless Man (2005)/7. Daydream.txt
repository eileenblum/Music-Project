I was living the darkside of life
I had no choice
Money in my hands was blood in my vains
Just a breath of life

Lower, you're so much lower
You can go deeper and deeper
To go higher, was my desire
I can't look down

He wrenched from my face
The shadow of my life
He drew my body

Reach out your hand
Get me out of there (estenda sua mÃ£o)
The smell of death
Is under my skin
Take care of me
Don't cover my eyes
Cause I wanna watch
His decay on my TV.

Daydream, Daydream face reality
Daydream, Daydream stand up!
