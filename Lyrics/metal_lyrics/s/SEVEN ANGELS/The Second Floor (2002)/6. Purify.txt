Purify, don't let your heart be infected by
Dirty Rites, ruins of death, don't, don't.
Realize, don't let your life be smashed by 
Crazy dreams, Purify Oh! Oh! 

Burn your old feelings, put' em down
Let the sword, tear your soul.

Crucify, the evil man beside you and
Watch his sins putrifying, now, now, 
Hear their cry, the evil screams, the elegy ,
Coming from ( the ) sulphur sea.

Burn your old feelings, put' em down
Let the sword, tear your soul.

Don't slice the seal
Make real your deal
Changed by the time
Reborned from the ashes

Raise your sword, raise your weapon,
That brings the blood of your past
Kill the man, the evil man, the man that lives inside you
