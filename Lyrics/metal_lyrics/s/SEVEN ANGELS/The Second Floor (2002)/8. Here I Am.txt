Here I am, to understand
What will the man do with his hands
Here I am, to be the man,
That bring the news to a wasted land

Feeling the disgrace and walking through the pain
Rain of agony falling over me
Through nails and flames
For a little time I close my eyes,
When pray I think about the day

I met the man who said
One way to live in sorrow
The way to be regret
One way to give your life to Lord

[Chorus]

I cry, I fight, I give my life,
I write my word into your heart, (cause)
Your soul was dying,
Stand up, beware, don't fall again.

Spread your wings and fly away
And see the world that dies in sin
Day by day, don't stray away
Don't miss the true a living way
