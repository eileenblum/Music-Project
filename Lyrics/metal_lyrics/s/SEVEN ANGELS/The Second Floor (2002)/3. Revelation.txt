I open my eyes one day
I look by the window and I say
Why don't you care about me
Why don't you give me a holy life

I was sitted in my bed
Remembering the day I lost the way
I was crying for my lost soul
And paying the price, the price of this deal

But in the sky, the lightning strykes
From the clouds na angel come
From his mouth comes a revelation
A prophecy to my life

The wind of salvation blow in my hair
A new blood is on my vein
I feel the freedom in my life
I cry how I cry

Those bloody tears, those bloody tales
The kingdom i'd buy with my soul
My bloody tears fall from my face
The devil is waiting me

Revelation simple thruth, anestesing my sensation
Intuition,killing my self, geting out of me

Revelation,endless time,reconstructing devastated
Lands and kingdons, lost in time
