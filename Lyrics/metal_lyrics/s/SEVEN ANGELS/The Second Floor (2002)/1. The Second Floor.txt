With the same eyes I can see the sun and the dark 
With the same hands I can touch hell and heaven

It's up to me, I'm the only one
Who can decide my destiny

From the cold valleys I feel the winds of the deal
An alliance between the devil and the human race 

Don't be a fool, the devil's in desguise
He comes to lie, to steal, to kill

[Chorus]
Reach the second floor
Stand up and look down
feel what you see
that's your wish ??

Lord I've wasted my life in sin
And I've rejected your word
When I find the way, you give me a holy life
A plentiful life.
