I wake up this morning
I hear when you call
I remember last night, a cry
My arms are hurt
I can feel the pain
The hell in my veins on me
Now I try to escape but I can't
Something's pushing me down
The demons are around me
When I try to open my eyes
I feel the hands of the beast on me
From hills and woods
The winds of destiny
are blowing over me
Redoing my life
Year after year, I'm destroying my loife
Day after day, my soul is crying
But one day I felt a breath in my heart
I see his hands taking me from hell
I see the war, I see the battle in the sky
The fire of god burning inside of me
Sawing flashes of my past
I can't understand where I've been trapped
I've been betrayed, living, lying, losing, dying
I don't believe, one day I'll win
Years of disillusion in my mind, confusion
Scenes of memory, I'll never be free
Dying, Crying, Hearing, the  sound of my defeat
