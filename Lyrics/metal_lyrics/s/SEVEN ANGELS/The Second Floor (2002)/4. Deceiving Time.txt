Year after year (when) I look into you
I feel you're ready to walk by yourself
All these years you live in the dark
So many things you hear, you learn

Oh you cry, you fall, you pray
So many times I saw you runaway
But sometimes I saw your face
Smiling and shinning

A man in the crowd, a number, one more
It's how I felt, I was seeing me
I never thought ( I ) was someone for you
One more mistake, one more trap

Oh you cry,...........

I was wrong, oh I was blind
I never thought I was
I have spent my holy time
This time never come back

Every day,I wake up and I pray, oh my Lord, takes this veil from me
I can't say how many times I miss, cause I was walking in the quicksand
Now I praise, I can't breath again, you hold my hands, you give back my life

How can I, walk so long, so long time, without your rhyme
I can see, it was nothing more than a Deceiving time
Search in your mind, Deceiving time
Revive your life, Deceiving time
