I saw hands when he brings me in the death land
When he let me in this land full of dry souls
And he makes walk, walk around, I ask him, if he can,
Give life again to this dried souls.
Prophesy my son, tell them to hear my words

[Chorus]
I will give you life again, as I told,
I will give you breath, I will give you life,
I will brought you up out of your grave

I saw a shade surrounding my body,
I hear his breath,
I feel his is breath uh

The Lord God behold
The wisdom of the majesty
