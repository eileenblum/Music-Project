These years I've spent with you
These nights I hear
There's no day I didn't love you
there's no mistake

These fight's we fight together
These words we speak
All the things we've planed
All the things we do

No, I won't leave, I won't lose
The breath of my soul
Oh I know, how you're part of me,
Inside me

Sky with no clouds
Woods with no trees
All my veins have no blood
Life makes no sense

No more clouds
No more trees
No more blood
No more life

How long it took till I could understand what life means
How could I spent so much time without you
