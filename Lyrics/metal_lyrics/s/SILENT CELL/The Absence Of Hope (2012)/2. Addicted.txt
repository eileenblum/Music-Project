Canât see why I have denied
Canât see this thorn on my side
Take me before I go mad
How did I turn into this wreck?

I should just walk away
I should put the glass aside
This will be my dismay
Will you stay there and watch me die?

And I am the one whoâs drowning
This sorrow deep inside
And I am the one whoâs begging
Save me and be my guide

Just like a whip lashing on my back
Just like a knife going through my neck
The clock ticks my time is running out
Help me get away from this mess

I have become a slave
The bottle owns my mind
Addicted and decayed
Wonât leave until it runs dry

And I am the one whoâs drowning
This sorrow deep inside
And I am the one whoâs begging
Save me and be my guide
And I am the one whoâs drowning
This sorrow deep inside
And I canât quit my addicted ways
Iâve passed the turning tide
