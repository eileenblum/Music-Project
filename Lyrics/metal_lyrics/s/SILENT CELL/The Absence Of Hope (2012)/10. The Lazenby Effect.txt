Canât find a way to commend
Canât see the light that transcends
Hope is demise in disguise
We cannot forget and pretend

Life was meant to be spent all alone
So prepare to descend again
The bad times, the good times are gone by so just be content
Our tale will come to an end

The new world will not forgive
Our hearts filled with hate to no end
The time has come to realize
And leave all the sickness confined

Life was meant to be spent all alone
So prepare to descend again
The bad times, the good times are gone by so just be content
Our tale will come to an end

Blinded by false truth
The dream has been untrue
Hurting inside all of the time
This life is just a lie
Can i go back in time?
And be the first to say
End this, before itâs too late
