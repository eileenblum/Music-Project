Itâs time to come undone
And raise the torment again
This time Iâll set the tone
Violently teach you why

Pain pain pain pain pain is what you deserve
Iâll step inside to show you what you can learn
Pain pain pain pain pain is what you deserve
Make you pay for the wrong that you have done

I know the faces that you torn in half
I know youâre feeling high and bright
You crossed the line again
But I donât think youâre gonna make it back
Iâve grown much stronger alone

You left me alone to die
Moved on without any regret
How could iâve been so blind?
I`ve finally opened my eyes

Pain pain pain pain pain is what you deserve
Iâll step inside to show you what you can learn
Pain pain pain pain pain is what you deserve
Make you pay for the wrong that you have done

I know the faces that you torn in half
I know youâre feeling high and bright
You crossed the line again
But I donât think youâre gonna make it back
Iâve grown much stronger alone

You have been exposed
I can smell your blood
You have lost your throne
I will break your bones
You wonât win this war

I know the faces that you torn in half
I know youâre feeling high and bright
You crossed the line again
But I donât think youâre gonna make it back
Iâve grown much stronger alone

Pain Pain is what you deserve
Hate Hate is what i`ve learned
Pain pain pain pain pain is what you deserve
Hate hate hate hate hate is what i`ve learned
