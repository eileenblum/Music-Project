My thoughts reflect
Lusty dreams and a happy end
When you went down I lent my hand
We were fighting for a reason
But the reason soon was dead

We choked and burnt that feeling away
Weâre left with love in a cup full of hate
Destroy, reset, snap your neck on the way
Our hearts were bred to live into this cesspool of shit

Take your time
Push it in, donât breath away
Raise the feelings that were dead
Fill your lungs up with that air
Full of disgrace, hate and despair
Thereâs no need to break and fall apart
Raise the feelings that were dead
Fill your lungs up with that air
Full of disgrace, hate and despair

Itâs all been said
Words were spent into thin air
Now itâs time to turn back
Wish I still had a reason
But a reason needs some care

We choked and burnt that feeling away
Weâre left with love in a cup full of hate
Destroy, reset, snap your neck on the way
Our hearts were bred to live into this cesspool of shit

Take your time
Push it in, donât breath away
Raise the feelings that were dead
Fill your lungs up with that air
Full of disgrace, hate and despair
So thereâs no need to break and fall apart
Raise the feelings that were dead
Fill your lungs up with that air
Full of disgrace, hate and despair
As we could survive without true love
Feed the monster in your head
Fill your lungs up with that air
Full of disgrace, hate and despair
