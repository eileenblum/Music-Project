Broken thoughts I confined
Broken hearts I denied
False regrets take me back
Make me sick and compromised

A turmoil so deafening
Tears me apart and rips the rind
I stare deep into the abyss
Let my mind become my guide

Donât despair, donât despair, their blood is all over you
Please beware, please beware, look deep into what feels true
Take your time, take your time, the answer is on the line
Free yourself, tame yourself, itâs time to let go

Is there a prayer?
For my sins and hideous crimes
Feelings torn in half, hateful lies
Is there a place?
To disappear and rest my mind
Changes wonât amend, what I hide

I cast a shadow on the light
I cast a plague on this life
Ash and smoke fill the air
My eyes bleed when I cry

Thereâs nowhere to go
Every attempt feels like a crime
I swear Iâve done my best, no more lies
I want to know
Could I ever change what fell behind?
Piece it back to when it looked so bright

Hope has turned me into a spoiled mess
Hope has turned me into something less
And i will not obey what urges me inside
And i will not betray what's left of my mind
And i will not obey what urges me inside
I've reached the final line
It's time to let go
