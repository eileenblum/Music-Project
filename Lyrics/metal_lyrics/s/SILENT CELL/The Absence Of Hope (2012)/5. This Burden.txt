My life has taken a dive to a weird place
Is this who I am?
The "me" i thought that i knew has gone astray

Iâve tried to break this shell that binds me
This burden is my pain, Iâll burn it away

I wonât quit this fight
Thrashing in the shadows, bruising my knuckles with every hit i try
I canât see the light
This homicidal visions, are burning through my mind

Thereâs something that I need to break
and this is my last mistake
By god I will find a way
To stop these visions

Iâve tried to break this shell that binds me
This burden is my pain, Iâll burn it away

Disdain has led my life to this place
I wish I could forget
The âmeâ I wish that I knew again betrayed

Iâve tried to break this shell that binds me
This burden is my pain, Iâll burn it away

I wonât quit this fight
Thrashing in the shadows, bruising my knuckles with every hit i try
I canât see the light
This homicidal visions, are burning through my mind

Thereâs something that I need to break
and this is my last mistake
By god I will find a way
To stop this pain inside
Thereâs something that I need to break
and this is my last mistake
By god I will find a way
To stop these visions

I canât shut my own eyes
I see red inside my (mind)
I canât shut my own eyes
I see red inside my (mind)
I canât shut my own eyes
I see red inside my (mind)
I canât shut my own eyes
I see red inside my (mind)
