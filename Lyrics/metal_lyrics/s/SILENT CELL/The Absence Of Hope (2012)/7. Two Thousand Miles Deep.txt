Feeling tired
I can feel my colors fading
And I want to feel the same
Have I lost my mind?
I feel like I died inside
Havenât slept in many days now
And I want to feel the same
Want to bring my colors back to life

Turn and run away from time
Smash through
These imaginary lines
Need them no more

I refuse to wither and die
I wanna go back
And reconstruct my mind
Redefine
Glue the pieces
Find a trace of what used to be
I refuse to wither and die
I wanna go back
And reconstruct my mind
Redefine
Find the answers
Two thousand miles deep

So uninspired
Contrived and uncertain
Wish I could feel the same
Iâm falling way behind
I feel like I died inside
Havenât slept in many days now
And I want to feel the same
Want to bring my colors back to life

Turn and run away from time
Smash through
These imaginary lines
Need them no more
