All spent and intertwined
Youâll never know what lies behind
My eyes have lost their light
Deception mixed with lies

My time I will devote
To ruin your disguise
So sick of maybes
This is the end of your charade

Nowhere to run or hide
To embrace hate I close my eyes
Iâll split sides with my mind
You wonât forget this
Nowhere to run or hide
To embrace hate I close my eyes
Iâll split sides with my mind

Displaced and criticized
You shouldâve know I would survive
Our worlds shall soon collide
Deception mixed with lies

My time I will devote
To ruin your disguise
So sick of maybes
This is the end of your charade

Nowhere to run or hide
To embrace hate I close my eyes
Iâll split sides with my mind
You wonât forget this
Nowhere to run or hide
To embrace hate I close my eyes
Iâll split sides with my mind
