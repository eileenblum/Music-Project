This sadness inside you
Taking away all of your control
Itâs so hard to bestow but
I know you canât rely on

Gray days that passed
And burned away in your mind
I wish i could save you, you have to let go
So bury it away somehow
Bury it along with me now
It's been so long since i've seen you smile
I wish i could save you, you have to let go
So bury it away somehow
Bury it now

This trap you fell into
Made you obsessed by your own letdown
Try hard to be cold but
You know you canât rely on

Gray days that passed
And burned away in your mind
I wish i could save you, you have to let go
So bury it away somehow
Bury it along with me now
It's been so long since i've seen you smile
I wish i could save you, you have to let go
So bury it away somehow
Bury it now
You have become the very thing i despise
I tried to love you
Now lift this curse from my soul
