You been bad
Don't do what I say.
You don't listen.
And you never obey.
Try to teach you.
But you just won't be good.
You won't behave the way
A big girl should.
It's time to give the whip a crack.
I'm gonna have to send you back to
Bitch School.
Bitch School.

You're a beauty.
You're the best of your breed.
You're a handful.
And I know what you need.
You need training.
Gonna bring you to heel.
I'm gonna break you with my will of steel.
Discipline's my middle name.
And no one comes back the same from
Bitch School.
Bitch School.

No more sniffling strangers, or running free at night.
You think my bark's bad, honey - wait till you feel my bite.

You got problems.
You whine and you beg.
When I'm busy,
You wanna dance with my leg.
I'm gonna chain you.
Make you sleep out of doors.
You're so fetching when you're down on all fours.
And when you hear your master,
You will come a little faster, thanks to
Bitch School
