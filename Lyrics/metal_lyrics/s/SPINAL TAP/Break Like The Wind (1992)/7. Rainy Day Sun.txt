Here she comes, that Rainy Day Sun,
Peeking in and out the falling raindrops;
Smiling down on everyone.

In her golden, gossamer gown,
And a necklace of the finest rainbows;
Drying out this rainy day town.

Good-bye, Cloudy Skies!
Here she comes! Here she comes to...
Cut them down to size,
And dry the tears in my eyes.

Here she comes that Rainy Day Sun,
Like a moppet at a birthday party;
Rainy day's not spoiling her fun.

Open up the top of your mind;
Catch the water in your magic paint-box,
Oh, the many colors you find!

Good-bye, Cloudy Skies!
Here she comes! Here she comes to...
Cut them down to size,
And dry the tears in my eyes.
