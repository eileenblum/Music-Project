Springtime is on my mind
Flowers blooming, all the time

Smell the roses
Smell the grass
Old man winter can kiss my ass

[chorus:]
Don't you think that it's a pity?
Don't you think that it's a shame?
Don't you wish that
Every season was the same

Time for loving in the park
Wear a jumper when it gets dark
Mind the prickles
Mind the dew
Wash your willie when you're through

[chorus]

Springtime, enough's enough
Tired of flowers and all that stuff
Want some drizzle.
Want some sleet
Want some wellies on my feet

[chorus]
