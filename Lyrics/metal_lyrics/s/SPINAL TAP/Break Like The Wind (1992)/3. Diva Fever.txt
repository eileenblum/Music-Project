Can't go back
To London,
Can't go back
To Swindon,
Can't go back
To Waterloo.
Can't go back
To Debra,
Can't go back
To Sheila,
Can't go back
To girls like you

Here she comes
Lovely,
Here she comes
Deadly,
Here she comes
Big as life.
There she goes,
Snubs me;
There she goes
Cuts me,
There she goes,
Like a knife.
I got...

Diva Fever
It's staying on me
Diva Fever
It's preying on me.
Diva Fever
She's born to thrill me;
Diva Fever
It's gonna kill me.

[spoken:]
And yet I would gladly die screaming, in insufferable
agony, if it meant I could spend my last few moments
gazing in her eyes...

Can't go back
To London,
Can't go back
To Swindon,
Can't go back
To Waterloo
Can't go back,
It's too late,
Can't go back,
She's too great,
Can't go back,
I can't deny,
There she goes,
Love her,
There she goes,
Hate her,
There she goes,
Want to die.
I got...

Diva Fever
They'll never cure me,
Diva Fever
They won't insure me.
Diva Fever
My demon lover
Diva Fever
I shan't recover...
