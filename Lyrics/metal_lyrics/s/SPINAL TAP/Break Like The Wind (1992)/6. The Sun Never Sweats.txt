Bolder than the pirates who used to rule the sea
Braver than the natives, who never heard of tea.
They never knew what hit them, said the Spaniards later on.
Empire. It was here and now it's gone.
Even the biggest elephant never forgets
And the sun never sweats. No, the sun never sweats.

You were younger than a virgin, older than the sea.
You were angel, you were devil, and I was all of me.
You knew you met your master, when I made you stay at home.
Woman. Whatever made you roam.
Even the hardest concrete never quite sets.
And the sun never sweats. No, the sun never sweats.

Losing is for losers, winners play to win.
Always love the sinner, you may even like the sin.
The door that used to open has closed without a crack.
Woman, you're like the Empire and I still want you back.
We may be gods or just big marionettes.
But the sun never sweats.
Life is a gamble and we're all placing our bets.
And the sun never sweats.
No the sun never sweats.
