Well, I'm sittin' here beside the railroad track,
And I'm waitin' for that train to bring her back.
If she's not on the five-nineteen,
Then I'm gonna know what sorrow means.
And I'm gonna cry, cry, cry,
All the way home.

[Chorus:]
All the way home,
All the way home.
Yes, I'm gonna cry, cry, cry,
All the way home.

Well, her daddy never liked me, this he said.
And he could never get it through his old gray head
That I loved his daughter so,
I did not mean to see her go.
Now I'm gonna cry, cry, cry,
All the way home.

[Chorus]
