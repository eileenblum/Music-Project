When there was darkness
And the void was king and ruled the elements
When there was silence and the hush was almost deafening
Out of the emptiness: salvation
Salvation, rhythm and light and sound

It was the rock 'n' roll creation
It was a terrible big bang
It was the ultimate mutation
Ying was searching for his yang
And he looked and he saw that it was good

When i'm alone beneath the stars and feeling insignificant
I turn within to see the forces that created me

I look to the stars and the answer is clear
I look in the mirror and see what I fear

It is the rock 'n' roll creation
It is the absolute rebirth
It is the rolling of the ocean
And the rocking of the earth
And I looked and I saw that it was good
