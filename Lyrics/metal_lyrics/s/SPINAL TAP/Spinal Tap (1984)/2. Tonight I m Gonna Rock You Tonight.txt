Little girl, it's a great big world
But there's only one of me
You can't touch, 'cause I cost too much
But tonight i'm gonna rock you (tonight i'm gonna rock you)
Tonight i'm gonna rock you (tonight i'm gonna rock you)
Tonight

You're sweet, but you're just four feet
And you still got your baby teeth
You're too young and i'm too well hung
Tonight i'm gonna rock you (tonight i'm gonna rock you)
Tonight i'm gonna rock you (tonight i'm gonna rock you)
Tonight

You're hot, you take all we got
Not a dry seat in the house
Next day we'll be on our way
But tonight i'm gonna rock you (tonight i'm gonna rock you)
Tonight i'm gonna rock you (tonight i'm gonna rock you)
Tonight

Little girl, it's a great big world
But there's only one of me
