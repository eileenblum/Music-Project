The bigger the cushion, the sweeter the pushin'
That's what I said
The looser the waistband, the deeper the quicksand
Or so I have read
My baby fits me like a flesh toxedu
I'd like to sink her with my pink torpedo

Big bottom, big bottom
Talk about bum cakes
My girl's got 'em
Big bottom
Drive me out of my mind
How could I leave this behind

I met her on monday, it was my lucky bun day
You know what I mean
I love her each weekday, each velvety cheekday
You know what I mean
My lovegun's loaded and she's in my sights
Big game is waiting there inside her tights

Big bottom, big bottom
Talk about mud flaps
My girl's got 'em
Big bottom
Drive me out of my mind
How could I leave this behind

My baby fits me like a flesh toxedu
I'd like to sink her with my pink torpedo

Big bottom, big bottom
Talk about bum cakes
My girl's got 'em
Big bottom
Drive me out of my mind
How could I leave this behind
