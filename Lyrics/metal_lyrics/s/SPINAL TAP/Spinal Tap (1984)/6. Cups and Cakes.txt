Cups and cakes, cups and cakes
Oh what good things mother makes
You've got to take tea, won't you take it with me
What a gay time it will be

Cups and cakes, cups and cakes
Please make sure that nothing breaks
The china's so dear and treacle so clear
And i'm glad that you are here

Milk and sugar, bread and jam
Yes please, sir, and thank you ma'm
Here I am

Cups and cakes, cups and cakes
I'm so full my tummy aches
How sad it must end but i'm glad i've a friend
Sharing cups and cakes with me
And cakes with me.......
