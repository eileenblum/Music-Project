Listen, to what the flower people say
Listen, it's getting louder every day
Listen, it's like a bolt out of the blue
Listen, it could be calling out for you

Flower people, walk on by
Flower people, don't you cry
It's not too late (no)
It's not too late

Listen, it's like a Mozart symphony
Listen, it's something just for you and me
Listen, to what the flower people say
Listen, it's getting truer every day
