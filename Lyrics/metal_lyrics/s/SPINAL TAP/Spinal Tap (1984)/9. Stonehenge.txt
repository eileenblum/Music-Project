In ancient times, hundreds of years before the dawn of history
Lived a strange race of people: the druids
No-one knows who they where or what they were doing
But their legacy remains, hewen into the living rock of stonehenge

Stonehenge
Where the demons dwell
Where the banshees live and they do live well
Stonehenge
Where a man is a man
And the children dance to the pipes of pan

Stonehenge
It is a magical place
Where the moon doth rise with a dragon's face
Stonehenge
Where the virgins lie
And the prayers of devils fill the midnight sky

And you, my love, won't you take my hand
We'll go back in time to that mystic land
Where the dew drops cry and the cats meow
I will take you there, I will show you how

And oh, how they danced, the little children of stonehenge
Beneath the haunted moon for fear that daybreak might come too soon

And where are they now, the little people of stonehenge
And what would they say to us if we were here tonight
