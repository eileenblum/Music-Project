The window's dirty, the mattress stinks
This ain't no place to be a man
I ain't got no future, ain't got no past
And I don't think I ever can

The floor is filthy, the walls are thin
The wind is howling in my face
The rats are peeling, i'm losing ground
Can't seem to join the human race

I'm living in a hellhole
Don't want to stay in this hellhole
Don't want to die in this hellhole
Girl, get me out of this hellhole

I rode the jetstream, I hit the top
I'm eating steak and lobster tails
The sauna's drafty, the pool's too hot
The kitchen stinks of boiling snails

The taxman's coming, the butler quit
This ain't a way to be a man
I'm going back to where I started
I'm flashing back into my pan

Yeah, that's what i'm doing
Right now

It's better in a hellhole
You know where you stand in a hellhole
Folks lend a hand in a hellhole
Girl, get me back to my hellhole
