No light fantastic ever crosses my mind
That meditation stuff can make you go blind
Just crank that volume to the point of pain
Why waste good music on a brain

Heavy (heavy) duty (duty)
Heavy duty rock 'n' roll
Heavy (heavy) duty (duty)
Brings out the duty in my soul

I see you dancing there in front of the band
You're playing your solos with no guitar in your hands
I don't call no punches, I wouldn't waste your time
And just 'cos it pays, that ain't no crime

Heavy (heavy) duty (duty)
Heavy duty rock 'n' roll
Heavy (heavy) duty (duty)
Brings out the duty in my soul

I don't need a woman, I won't take me no wife
I got the rock 'n' roll and that'll be my life
No page in history baby, that I don't need
I just wanna make some eardrums bleed

Heavy (heavy) duty (duty)
Heavy duty rock 'n' roll
Heavy (heavy) duty (duty)
Brings out the duty in my soul
