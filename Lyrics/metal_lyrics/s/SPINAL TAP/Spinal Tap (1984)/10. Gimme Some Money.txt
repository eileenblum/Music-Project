Stop wasting my time
You know what I want
You know what I need
Or maybe you don't
Do I have to come right flat out and tell you everything

Gimme some money, gimme some money

I'm nobody's fool
I'm nobody's clown
I'm treating you cool
I'm putting you down
But baby, I don't intend to leave empty handed

Gimme some money, gimme some money

Gimme some money, gimme some money

Don't get me wrong (gimme some money)
Try getting me right (gimme some mooney)
Your face is ok
But your purse is too tight (gimme some money)
I'm looking for pound notes, loose change, bad checks, anything

Gimme some money, gimme some money
Gimme some money, gimme some money
Gimme some money, gimme some money
Gimme some money, gimme some money
Gimme some money, gimme some money
