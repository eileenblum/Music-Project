We came like babies
From our home across the sea
To see america
And the people opened their arms
To welcome us
To america

We came like children
From a far and distant land
To see america
And the golden sun of freedom
Filtered down to us
In america

And the people stood and stared
Loved us more than we had dared-to
In america

Super highways here and there
Pretty women everywhere
Brady bunch and smokey bear

Buildings reaching to the sky
Afro-sheen and apple pie
P.t.a. and f.b.I.

The jumbo jet begins to rise
A joyful nation waves it's bye-byes

Each religion, race and creed
Gets exactly what they need
God bless johnny appleseed
