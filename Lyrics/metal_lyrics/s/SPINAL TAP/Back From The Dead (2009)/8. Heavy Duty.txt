No light fantastic ever crosses my mind
That meditation stuff can make you go blind
Just crank that music to the point of pain
Why waste good music on a brain

[Chorus:]
Heavy (heavy), duty (duty)
Heavy duty rock and roll
Heavy (heavy), duty (duty)
Brings out the duty in my soul

I see you dancing there in front of the band
You're playin' the solos with no guitar in your hand
I don't pull no punches I wouldn't waste your time
And just cause it pays, that ain't no crime

[Chorus]

Don't need a woman, I won't take me no wife
I get the rock and roll and that'll be my life
No page in history baby- that, I don't need
I just want to make some eardrums bleed

[Chorus]
