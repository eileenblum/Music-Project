I want to be your no one
Yes, when your day is done
You've got a loaded handgun
Here we go again
I want to be your no none

First you say I'm crazy
Then you say you need me
It happened way to fast
I dont need you

I hope you know you're killin me
Yes with the things you say
I've got some decency
Why wont you believe me
I hope you know you're killin me

I dont need you.
