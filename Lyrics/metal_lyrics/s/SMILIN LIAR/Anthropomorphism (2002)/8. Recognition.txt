You don't understand the words I say.
But I am going to step forward anyway.
Cause I know this would make your day.
If we just get it started off this way.

We got something for all of you to hear.
Even those in back who must stand near.
Gonna preach it loud and make it clear.
Gonna tell you just what you fear.
Time to throw away your pride.
Time to take what's stuck inside.
Were in front you cant deny.
There's no where to run, no where to hide.

Time to throw away your fear.
Time to let your words ring clear.
Only then can you speak from here.
Time for you to go.
Time for you to go.

Tell my why you won't look at me.

What does it take to recognize.
That we know the truth won't compromize?
We can all see right through your lies.
I think it's about time to open up your eyes.
What does it take to get to you?
When will you get your fucking clue?
All the shit that we've been through.
We'll make it to the top no thanks to you.

Time to let the shit be dropped.
Time to let the hate just stop.
Time for us to be on top.
Time for you to go.
Time for you to go.

Now I'm just sick. So sick of
your shit. How I can't stand you
you think I can't handle being
in front, holding the gun,
calling the plays, this is
mundane. Cause I will get big
not live in sin, I wont just
doubt you, I'll live without
you. Time is for change, you'll
stay the same, I might get stuck
but I won't give up.
