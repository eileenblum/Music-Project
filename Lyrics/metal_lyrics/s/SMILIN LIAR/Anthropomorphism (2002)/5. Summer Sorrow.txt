I know you babe. You pretty thing. Why'd you lie to me?
The things you say arent to hard to see.
All your life your awful lies they've been changing me.
Know that I..I'm sorry. I aint what I used to be.

These are the things that I need.
This is the cut. Watch me bleed.
This is my life let me lead. Its all mine.

Everything changing take a look around
Know that I aint the person you
Check me out now. Hell I'm the man..

Take one look and say God damn.
