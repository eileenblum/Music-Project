As I look at you child
I want to hold you close
Want to show you love
And make sure you know
Cause you don't know wrong
And you don't know right
You only know the way that
you feel inside

Right. You got to be something.
You got to show them they're wrong.

As I look at you mom I see
A girl inside who gave up
To early and who never tried
They're killing your son
They're making him bleed
They are holding him back
From what he could be

Give unto him and you know
you'll be alright. Whenever
you feel youve lost control
call on the man to heal your soul.
