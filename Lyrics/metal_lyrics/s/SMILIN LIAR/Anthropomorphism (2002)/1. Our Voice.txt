Hey we are here. We are one and many.
Hey we are here no we can not lie. (die)

So what did you expect to find.
Our thoughts you cant deny.
So scared of what we do.
So scared to see the truth.
While your only full of pride
A flame in each of us resides
One that only comes from truth
One that only burns with youth.

Hey said your name. Can you hear us calling.
Hey said your name no you can not hide. (lie)

Its our nature for us to take you
for us to break you.. Beat down

Hey this is it. This is where we take ours.
Hey this is it where we fly.
