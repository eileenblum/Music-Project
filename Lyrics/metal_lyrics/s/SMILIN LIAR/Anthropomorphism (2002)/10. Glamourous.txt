Such a beautiful face.
That I cannot touch.
That I can not embrace.
So much that I want.
So much that I need.
But my only wish.
Is for me to be ...with...you.

Yes love will take you,
break you, hold you make
you down. And drown and
cry and yet still you like it
want it need it because it
lifts you up.

At least I can say I knew you.

So much that I fear.
Like hearing you cry.
But I can't see your tears.
Yes there'll be pain.
Too much to bear.
But my only wish.
Is for me to be there
with...you.

Will I be running again?
I will be running again.
Will I be running?
I don't want to run.

Just take it and leave.
