Yes you sir, I've got something for you to hear.
Yes sir, its something that you fear.
Yes sir, we know how you feel inside.
Yes sir, we know how you got your southern pride.

Cause your headstrong
Thought your full of hypocracy
We dont need you
And your broken philosophy

Yes you sir, why did you hold them back?
Yes sir, was it only because they're black?
Yes we know you. Yes we know how you really feel.
We'll show you. Just how your hate is real.

Cause your headstrong
Thought your full of hypocracy
We dont need you
And your broken philosophy

Fall. Fall. Fall. Fall.

"I dont care." Just look at you
"I dont care." Look at you.
