So long loveâ¦
In solitude, In solitude, In solitude, In solitude.

Between the Shadows, my husband wakes up.
Grows my sorrow while I help to prepare him for the duel.
The honor is the only thing that matters to men.
Willing to die for a lie and deny who stole horses from the path.

[Chorus:]
I'll be praying on my knees.
Back again after six a.m!
Donât wanna carry on with all this wrath on me.

In silence takes his gun.
Without teardrops kisses my head.
Gold bullets will be dyeing with scarlet blood.
This is the last goodbye.
Today a man will have fallen and other will be back alive.

I am not made to work as âLady of the nightâ
If with your death the poverty arrives.
