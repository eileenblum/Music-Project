Oh!

Early in the morning, Black coffee, Life moves on.
I can hear the applause, the ghost of my own world.
Red velvet on the stage.
Red roses. My own way.

My only friend the Winchester.
Waiting in the shadows, tight corset presses my chest.

Take the bullets, Ambition, Life moves on.
Turn myself, pray for a successful show.
Red velvet on the stage.
Red roses. My own way.

[Chorus:]
Just take a breath and see the show.
Scream my name! âJust One Shotâ.

Turn the lights on. I'm on the zone.
I don't need nobody, I'm better alone.
Red velvet on the stage.
Red roses, my own way.

Oh! Turn the lights on. Rock my world.
