Aaaaahhh!

The travel is ended, I know we arrived.
The past is gone, tomorrow stars.
Beats my heart, I can't control the way that I feel my emotions.
I canât resist, I can't escape from the spell, from the poison.
The way that I feel my emotions.

And now I'm gonna prove it, for myself.

[Chorus:]
The way we're riding, across the land,
is full of passion, entirely mine.

World of desire, How I can resist you?
World of desire, I wanna taste you!
World of desire, How I can resist you?
World of desire, I wanna taste you!

This new land promised me new life.
This new land promised me new life.

World of desire.
