In this state of tyrants,
they can take everything they want even your own neck.
Intimidation is their reflection.
Greed is the infection that moves this sick old earth.

They would erase my soul. The filth grows every day.
They would erase your soul. You're a puppet, a piece of chess.

[Chorus:]
Here comes again, Here is me against the train.
Always the same, Attack on train again.

At one oâclock, the gold arrives inside the train
that goes to River Phoenix Bank.
I take the guns, the guys are my brothers.
Together we are the âCurly Wolfsâ band

Ha ha ha ha

Take all the gold inside, steal every inch, be a man!
The crowd will claim for us, runs my horse, eye for an eye ha!
I'm the boss here now.

Inside the train smells like a murder. I hit somebody. Somebody hits me now.
All goes so fast, metalâs on bags, we made it brothers!
Hurry! It's time to back.
