Aaaahhh!
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

New gunman in town,
a hat hiding a young face.
He got an infectious smile.
Bluish gray color on his eyes.

Tonight rustlerâs moon shines bright again.
Brave yourself.
Tonight take your Gun and Winchester.
Defend the place.

[Chorus:]
Billy The Kid
Alive Legend on West.
Wild Rebel waiting for revenge.
History whispers your name.
Wild Rebel waiting for revenge.

The cruelty of the world modeled him.
The punishment had wrath within.

Aaaahhh!
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

With every murder of his loved ones they unleash the beast,
Creating a monster with an excuse to Kill

Billy The Kid, Billy The Kid, Billy The Kidâ¦

He looks like a cowboy with his heavy boots with spurs.
The girls of the Saloon find him handsome.
Perhaps they don't see all the blood that he left behind
with all the murders, but he doesnât looks like a criminal.

Bluish gray color on his eyes. He really got an infectious smile.
Thatâs for shure, he doesnât look like a criminal.
