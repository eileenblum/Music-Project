Gold, Gold, Gold, Goldâ¦

I wish from my childhood to find the most golden stone.
The stories were told to me inside of lullabies!
This gold make me be insane.
Seeking for how long? I always prayâ¦
I take those precious rocks in the cold river.
Put my fever on flames.

[Chorus:]
Gold God only in you I can belive.
This is gold, this is gold.
Every day I leave my flesh on the river.
This is gold, this is gold.

I'll be a gold-seeker until my grave!

Too much bills to pay every day.
I can fight so hard and bite the dust once again.

Iâm finally rich, Iâm finally rich.

Go away! all is sand!
Looking for my dreams I left my life behind.

I must pay the bills, here comes the pain.
Tired and blame, here comes the bang bang!
I left my flesh, here comes the pain.
Tired and blame, here comes the bang bang!

Fever on flames, I'm finally rich.
