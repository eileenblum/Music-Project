Ahhh! Rustler's night.

Rise with us! Against all gods!

We are the fallen, we are misfits.
Alone in this creepy townâ¦
They will know our existence!
Itâs time to rise! Take you rusted gun.
Just take a ride with us and our broncos.
Steal the moon that lights our lives.

[Chorus:]
Fellas go! Bandits go!
Here we go! Curly Wolves!

Burn our hearts! Freedom is calling for us (for us)
Forgive us our sins.
This is the dawn of a rebel sickness.

Go! Go! Go! Curly Wolves.
Here we go!

Ooohhh! Burn ours souls
We kill your faith.
Demons are we.
Face to face.
Destroying your everything.
