The breeze still blowing my mind.
In a place that is close to heaven,
time stops and back to shine.
Glorifying our lives (see the sun, hold my hand).
But it's over, things of the past.
Those days will never come back.
While I'm here sitting seeing all burning.
I'm keeping on my lie. Oh!
While I'm keeping on my lie.

[Chorus:]
Rage! Rage! Rage! Rage!

This new country is full of war.
Brother against brother.
While I'm here sitting seeing all burning.
I'm keeping on my lie.
While I'm keeping on my lie.

Hey young, hear drums. Itâs time to fight.
Take a gun, say bye, Itâs time to fight for our lives.

Hate. Wrath on me.
Freedom screams from the bottom of me.

Redemption, forgiveness.
