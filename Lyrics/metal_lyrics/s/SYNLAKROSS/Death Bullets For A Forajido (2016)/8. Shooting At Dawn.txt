If I really know youâ¦ Hypocrite.
If you really know meâ¦ Shut your mouth!
Who are you ignorant?
You made a mistake, feeling you smart.
Don't wanna give you a second chance.
Face tomorrow. No regrets!

If I really know youâ¦ Go ahead!
If you really know me.. Make my day!
Save your excuses, my mind is outside.
Words arenât necessary for you and I.
Take your gun, itâs time to fight.
Break the wall. No te voy a escuchar.

[Chorus:]
You and I falling down. Time to be Brave.
Shooting at Dawn. You and I falling Downâ¦
Face Off.

Who are you? Wicked Child.
You're too naÃ¯ve, wondering what?
Don't wanna give you a second chance.
Face tomorrow. No regrets.

one step, two steps, three steps, four steps, 5, 6, 7,
Turn around! Shooting at dawn! Go!

Shut up! Rat. Be strong little man.
There will be no flowers on your grave.
There will no tears in your motherâs face.
