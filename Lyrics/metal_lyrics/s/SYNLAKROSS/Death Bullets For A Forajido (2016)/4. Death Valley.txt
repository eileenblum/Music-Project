See the horizon full of grace, enjoy every single day
of our lives in this savage desert of freedom.
All right! Feel the tick-tack!
Spend all the sand in the clock. Be wild!

[Chorus:]
Death Valley
(No Mud, No Lotus, No Mud, No Lotusâ¦)

Wild west, our place!
Allâs death, who caresâ¦

See the future with your own eyes and tell me whatâs wrong with us?
We'll never back to China, there's no place to call home.
No Mud, No Lotus, No chains in my heart.

Hold on! Stay strong!
Whisper to me softly wind rose.

Out of sight, out of mind

Memories gone so far like âyesterdayâ for you and I.
Skulls, snakes, filth and a lot of wrath, itâs all I can find inside this dusk.

Hell! We are lost in this Wild West.
