I left myself fall on the floor,
when I felt a bullet that passed through my leg.
The white ground as marble fills with blood.
While everything turns around me, turns around me.

Like dust its puts the fear in my eyes.
Air that itâs drowns with me in my chest.
I hear their footsteps coming fast towards me.
I creep across the floor, while the agony takes pity on me.

Meltdown; altered space on which I am.
Meltdown; altered space on which I am.

His teeth are swords that cut my life.
My hands are shaking while I charge the gun.
Revenge for the Fallen, Death for The Plague.

Blood on the walls, blood on the floor.
Blood makes a river that runs through the halls, through the halls.
Here they are, here I go.

Here comes our end. And here I go.
Goodnight Sci-fi star.
