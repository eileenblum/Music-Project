I will find you on the bridge TV

It was the last night, I was watching TV.
Passed the midnight everything are commercials.
Behind some pictures, I saw your face.
You are so pretty, you are so close.

And now I try to find how I can buy you,
How can I take you out of my mind?
And now I try to finance this romance
with a few of dollars or credit card.

Ou! What's up? Where is my doll?
She is lost between a million of channels.

Ou! Hereâs my baby, I need she...
All my life is yours.
You are so pretty, you are so close.
All my life is yours.

I want you, you'll be my slave.
I will be the god of your microchips.
I want be your slave.

Hundred million of TV Share.
Too much love within capital.
Everybody can buy some love,
anybody Knows how it's really feels...
