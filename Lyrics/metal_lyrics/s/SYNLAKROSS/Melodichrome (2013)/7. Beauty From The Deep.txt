Wake up confused, everything is blurred.
Iâm like a prisoner suspended by chains.
Only left my head and my chest.
They weld the cables and mechanical organs
of a body that are lubricated by a thin layer of grease.
My new metal body has new legs, new arms.

Steel skin covering a transhuman heart.
Shoot of adrenaline, charge battery.
I feel the power running through my body.

Iâm a machine; I hardly have something organic.
The worker never matter in the scraps iron town.
Iâm a machine; I hardly have something organic,
but I feel the beauty from the deep.

We are legions, mechanical legions.
Ready to fight in this automatic world.
Silicon grease for vacuum valves.
Resistant to water as well.
Ordinary deposits of dirt and grease
can be removed with detergent and water,
but the sins of the soul never disappear.

Itâs so cold in this room!
A voice whispers my death.
This is the end if I donât agree to be a pawn!
But they will give me a new body,
a second chance to find you, and I will find you.
I will find you!
