Offline inside my capsule
Epinephrine river runs through my veins.
I open my eyes violently.
Red light flashes on my eye.

I blink twice to start the download
A face appears inside my mind.
The agency prepares the preys
and today Iâm the hunter.

Kill, kill, made for murder
Kill, kill, life unleashed, made for sin.

A dry take on life
Black polymer covers my synthetic skin.
I enter into a building as a honeycomb,

They always scream when they see me.
They always cry when they see me.
When they sleep all is easy... all is easy.
