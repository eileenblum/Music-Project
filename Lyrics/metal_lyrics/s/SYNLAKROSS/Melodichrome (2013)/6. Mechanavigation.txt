We are the filth that blows our senses.
We are looking for a place for do in it as they did on earth.

Floating, recently awake.
Lost the gravity, feel the zero space.
The warmness of sunshine, caress my skin.
There aren't yesterday in the memory of the space.

We are the kings made of ice.
We are looking for a place...

Floating in this room, memory remains me.
We lost our homes, we burned our place.

The warmness of sunshine, caress my skin.
There aren't yesterday in the memory of the space.

We are the kings made of ice.
We are looking for a place...
