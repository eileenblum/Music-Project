Flash, flash, flash, Kaboom!

When your shadow turned off all the lights?
Maybe itâs a reflexion of a hollow life.
Come on! Let me introduce you the alternating current.

When your shadow grows up inside your mind,
Dangerous monsters make me be scared.
Electromagnetic waves dance with us.

We are energy. Never mind who really think you are.
We are energy.

When your shadow whispers, death is near.
The blackout breaks up your transmission gear.
Flow of electric particles. We are...

When your shadow grow up inside your mind.
