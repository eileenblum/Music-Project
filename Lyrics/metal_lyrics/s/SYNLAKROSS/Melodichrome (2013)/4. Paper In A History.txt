I was born like everybody,
Human as my parents.
I cut the ugliest parts of my anatomy.
The scalpel molded my face,
a body wrapped tightly in bandages,
worm becomes butterfly

Like Dorian Gray (with his portrait)
Flying away like paper in history
Oh! Me without age. Oh! Me without age.

I become addicted to improvements.
I redesigned myself with bioengineering
and invasive robotic surgery.
The scalpel molded my face,
a body wrapped tightly in bandages,
worm becomes butterfly

I am a mecha, eternal live.
Everything dies while Iâm still alive.

Au! Iâm perfect! Put the screws on me!
