Running through the rotten walls of this mansion.
I know they'll find me here, those who are made of dust and fear.

Cracking and popping sounds all over the house.
The bedroom door is open to reveal the horror...

Pale like a ghost. Running! Running! Are you here?
Pale like a ghost. Brother, are you here?

Where are you? Silence over here.
I cry. Slap. Brother are you here?

Where are you?

Pale like a ghost. Running! Running! Are you here?
Pale like a ghost. Brother, are you here?

I try to preserve my hope and faith. It's all insane...

Demons chasing and catching us!
Gambling with lives, provoking us.
A voice resounds in my mind:
Never give up! Never give up! No!

I seek you out. Are you alive?
I heard you scream, but I don't know where.
I want to soothe your pain.
Are you alive? Am I alive? No!

Pale like a ghost. Running! Running! Are you here?
Pale like a ghost. Brother, are you here?

I try to preserve my hope and faith. It's all insane.

I close my eyes wondering why they want to end our lives.
And suddenly I see you by my side holding my hand.
Brother, we are in Hell!

Pale like a ghost. Running! Running! Are you here?

I close my eyes wondering why they want to end our lives.
And suddenly I see you by my side holding my hand.
Brother, we are in Hell!
