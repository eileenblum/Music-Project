Crucified like a martyr, they're tearing my entire flesh.
Demons are rude breaking bones.
They don't give me a break.

Yah yah yah yah!
No, please, no more!
Yah yah yah yah!
No, please, no more!

Oh Lord of darkness! Into your hands I commit my spirit.
Only your fire can give me a chance to fight again.

Into your hands...
Bring me back to life.
Into your hands...
Please, bring me back to life.

Oh Lord of darkness!
Please, bring me back to life.

From the abyss of hell I'm back to destroy them.
I promise! I promise! I'm back to destroy them.

Shamone!

Ether melts with my soul, creating a homunculus.
Ocean of lava hits and crushes my sanity.

Angels weep venom while I breathe again.
Forever bound to hell.

From the abyss of hell I'm back to destroy them.
I promise! I promise! I'm back to destroy them.

I will be merciless catching and hunting my prey.
I promise! I'm back to destroy them.

For all the pain they have inflicted on us
They will suffer until the end of time.

Can you hear them scream now?

Yah yah yah yah!
No, please, no more!
Yah yah yah yah!
No, please, no more!

From the abyss of hell I'm back to destroy them.
I promise! I promise! I'm back to destroy them.

I will be merciless catching and hunting my prey.
I promise! I'm back to destroy them.

I promise! I promise!
