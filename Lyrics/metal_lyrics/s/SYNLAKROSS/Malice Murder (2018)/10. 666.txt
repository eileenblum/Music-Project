Oh Lord of Darkness! Please ease my burden.
Shedding tears of sorrow, falling upon my knees.
I need to be healed.

The scars they cut so deep.
Destroying me!

6 6 6
Dark blood ripping me.
6 6 6
Ripping my body to shreds.

My misanthropy is the result of their cruelty.
My misanthropy is the only thing that feeds me.

The scars they cut so deep.
Set me free!

6 6 6
Dark blood ripping me.
6 6 6
Ripping my body to shreds.

Dark Lord! Save the one who invokes you.
In Thy great name, I pledge myself to hell!

Dark Lord! King of Chaos!
I give you my soul!
Let the fools be destroyed by the power you possess!

They must be damned!
No hope for them!
They must be damned!

My misanthropy is the result of their cruelty.
My misanthropy is the only thing that feeds me.

Oh Lord of Darkness! Please ease my burden.
Shedding tears of sorrow, falling upon my knees.
I need to be healed.

6 6 6
Dark blood ripping me.
6 6 6
Ripping my body to shreds.

6 6 6
Ripping my body to shreds.
6 6 6
Ripping my body to shreds.
