Moving slowly in my secret room,
The Siren is floating, reflecting the moon.
Oh no! Her eyes shine for the last time, so cold.
I feel dumb while I understand that it's her last breath on earth.

I caress your rotten scales because of me.
I mourn your death, forgive my greed.

The Siren's blood curse.
I hope that can erase all I've done.
A wave of sin carries my soul far and beyond.
No! Siren's blood curse.

Something embraces me while I drown in your blood.
A warm feeling in my stomach when I feed from you.

I caress your rotten scales because of me.
I mourn your death, forgive my greed.

The Siren's blood curse.
I hope that can erase all I've done.
A wave of sin carries my soul far and beyond.
No! Siren's blood curse.
No! Siren's blood curse.
No! Siren's blood curse.

I go further into river Styx.
Marshy waters trap me!
Terrifying mermaids have their eyes on me.
I deserve every bite, every pain they inflict on me.

The Siren's blood curse.
I hope that can erase all I've done.
A wave of sin carries my soul far and beyond.
No! Siren's blood curse!
