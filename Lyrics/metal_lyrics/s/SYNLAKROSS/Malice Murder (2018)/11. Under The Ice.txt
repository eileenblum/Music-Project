It's me!
It's me!
It's me!
It's me!
It's me!

Here I am, floating.
Darkness embraces me now.
Here I am, no breathing.
Darkness embraces me now under the ice.
Under the ice.

Trying to escape from those who haunted me,
I crossed the frozen river.
'Wonderful' white mistake.
The ice is thin. I fall through the ruthless hole.
There is no escape!

It's me! Somebody help me please!
It's me! Moving under ice.
Under the ice!
Under the ice.

The river has frozen over.
The ice pierces my flesh.
The ice was thin.
I fell through the ruthless hole.
There is no escape!

It's me! Somebody help me please!
It's me! Moving under ice.
Moving under ice!
Under the ice.

Crystal hands push me down, down, down (push me down!)
The river Styx swallows me down (swallows me down!)

Under the ice. No!
Under the ice.

It's me! Somebody help me please!
It's me! Moving under ice.
Somebody help me please!
Moving! Moving! Moving under ice!
