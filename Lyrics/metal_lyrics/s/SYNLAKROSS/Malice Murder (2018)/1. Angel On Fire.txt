Beneath constellations, in the whispering night.
Fireflies are dancing across the wicked path.
So haunted is my heart by desire...
Far away, fatuous fires.

I hear a voice from afar. He calls me in the dark.
Come now!
Deep, dark and ominous is the devil's breath.
Like a snake wriggling around me, everything is turning black.

He said,
"Come with me, angel. Come to my Paradise.
Sleep with me, angel. Come to my Paradise."

C'mon! Lay down your life. Set me on fire!
Taste my lust. Burn me alive.

Seduction and madness.
I drink from his bittersweet glass.
He fills the glass with lust.

He said,
"Come with me, angel. Come to my Paradise.
Sleep with me, angel. Come to my Paradise."

C'mon! Lay down your life. Set me on fire!
Taste my lust. Burn me alive.

His red light blinds me with a love that never dies.
Put your fingers on me. Bite me!
I'm condemned to hell, so there's no escape.
Put me down on my knees. Eat me!
Swallow me to death Mephistopheles.

He said,
"Come with me, angel. Come to my Paradise.
Sleep with me, angel. Come to my Paradise."

C'mon! Lay down your life. Set me on fire!
Taste my lust. Burn me alive.
