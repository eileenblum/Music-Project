Autumn leaves fall to the ground.
After the storm, I lay around the bend of my grave and gazed at the stars, and gazed at the stars.

A thousand voices saying, "Kill!, kill!, kill!"
There's nothing after
(Kill! Kill! Kill!)
What I have done?
Dead bodies dress the floor.

Who owns this blood?
(Kill! Kill! Kill!)
Quick flashes of memory.

I can see me now brandishing a knife.
Like a butcher chopping meat.
I hear them scream!

Mark with a scar sins that can't be erased.
I can hear them cry while I lose myself in Beelzebub.

It couldn't have been me.
It couldn't have been me.
It couldn't have been me. No!

Thousand voices saying, "Kill! Kill! Kill!"
I really wanted to kill.
Perfume of murder all night.
I've made a mash with everyone who's crossed my path.
Everything dies!

Mark with a scar sins that can't be erased.
I can hear them cry while I lose myself in Beelzebub.

Homicide. It wasn't me.
Homicide. It wasn't me.
Homicide. It wasn't me.

No! It couldn't have been me.

They're coming to take me away.
They're coming to take me, oh! No! No!

Mark with a scar sins that can't be erased.
I can hear them cry while I lose myself in Beelzebub.

Mark with a scar sins that can't be erased.
I can hear them cry while I lose myself in Beelzebub.
