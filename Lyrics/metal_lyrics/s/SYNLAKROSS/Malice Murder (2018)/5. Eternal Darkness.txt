Stillborn. Daughter of darkness.
Shambles of bright slaughter.
I was spat in the waters of life
that run with bleakness,
with a mark of sins on my brow.
Cursed by witches.

There's a light... will-o'-the-wisp
hovering at night â will-o'-the-wisp
over marshy ground â will-o'-the-wisp
All falls down â will-o'-the-wisp

I fall down. Lend me light! Lend me light!
All's rotting down. Lend me light! Lend me light!

All's falls down!

Vomited from the bowels of hell.
Exiled from what's human and providence.

There's a light... will-o'-the-wisp
hovering at night â will-o'-the-wisp

I fall down. Lend me light! Lend me light!
All's rotting down. Lend me light! Lend me light!

All's falls down!

I'm made of cruelty and suffering,
A horror bred by hatred and violence.
Tears of blood, killings and witchcraft.
Every second of my existence is rejected.

I should feel despair but,
Lord, I burn for thee at heart.
Come to save me, I need your mercy.
Oh Lord!
Open your Heaven to me!
Oh Lord!

I fall down. Lend me light! Lend me light!
All's rotting down. Lend me light! Lend me light!

I fall down. Lend me light! Lend me light!
All's rotting down. Lend me light! Lend me light!

All's falls down!
