Fasten your seat belts and get ready for the ride of your life.
Next stop: Hell

Today it's me, the beast.
I breathe and clean my knees of vomit.
I bleed but I'm still here.

I'm boiling from within.
Crawling and digging within myself to find the answer.
All's dead here.

Let me cut your throat. Let me! Let me!
Let me cut your throat. Let me cut your throat!

Let me cut your throat.

Scream for me: No! No! No! No!
I'm the dark seed that you planted in me.

You can live without arms, right?

Time has frozen since you started to smash every piece of me.
Now it's time to give you a taste of your own medicine.

Let me cut your throat. Let me cut your throat!

Scream for me: No! No! No! No!
I'm the dark seed that you planted in me.
Scream for me: No! No! No! No!
I'm the dark seed.

You can live without arms, right?
And maybe, and maybe without teeth.
I think I'm gonna cut every single piece of you that is ugly and is disturbing me.

Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Me!

Tendons, muscles, veins and suffer.
Now you're a gift to me.
This is me taking every single piece.
Now you're a gift to me.
Taste the nightmare!

Scream for me: No! No! No! No!
I'm the dark seed that you planted in me.
Scream for me: No! No! No! No!
I'm the dark seed.
