MorrÃ­gan!
MorrÃ­gan!

I lay down my life for you, submit to my will!
Goddess of war, I swear myself to thee!

MorrÃ­gan!

Surrounds the spell, deeper than the deepest night.
I'll be glad when the enemy falls.

Stars of dark and flames that lick the sinners' flesh.
Vermilion burning end. My heart belongs to hell.

Oh crow of war and fate! Give me what you possess.
Vermilion burning end. My heart belongs to hell.

MorrÃ­gan!

The muddy ground makes me hard to move around.
I take the sword, feel it hungry for throats.

Stars of dark and flames that lick the sinners' flesh.
Vermilion burning end. My heart belongs to hell.

Oh crow of war and fate! Give me what you possess.
Vermilion burning end. My heart belongs to hell.

Darkness from twilight.
Corpses around me back from the dead, wailing.
I call upon you, buried in the flow of time.

MorrÃ­gan!
Kill 'em all! Kill 'em all!
MorrÃ­gan!
Kill 'em all! Kill 'em all! Kill 'em all! Kill 'em all!

Surrounds the spell, deeper than the deepest night.
I'll be glad when the enemy falls.
The flow of time is always cruel.

Stars of dark and flames that lick the sinners' flesh.
Vermilion burning end. My heart belongs to hell.

Oh crow of war and fate! Give me what you possess.
Vermilion burning end. My heart belongs to hell.
