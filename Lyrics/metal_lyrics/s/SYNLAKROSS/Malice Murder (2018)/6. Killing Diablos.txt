Renewed is the pain, is the pain, is the pain.
Labyrinthine chain.
I thrill and tremble; tear on tear is burning, Hell!

Maria! Hear my prayer!
Maria! Hear my prayer!
Maria! Hear my prayer!
Maria! Hear my prayer!

In the darkness, gasping for air.
They lead me where I belong to stay.

What I possess, it's like a distant lie.
And what I lost, grows real and undying.

Maria! Hear my prayer!
Maria! Hear my prayer!
Maria! Hear my prayer!
Maria! Hear my prayer!

In the darkness, gasping for air.
They lead me where I belong to stay.
They lead me to hell.

What I possess, it's like a distant lie.
And what I lost grows real and undying.

Aww, aww! I feel their nervous jaws!
Aww, aww! Tearing and chewing, devouring my flesh and my soul.

You leave me to stay.
You leave me to stay.

Yaw!
Maria! Hear my prayer!

In the darkness, gasping for air.
They lead me where I belong to stay.
They lead me to hell.

Maria! Hear my prayer.
Hear my prayer.
Hear my prayer.
Maria!
