Get on your knees
And pray
Get on your knees
Stay with me
...to tell...

Look at you, poor you, you're burning with desire.
I'm yours, my lord, no matter what.
Moonlight fills the sexual urge.
Praying mantis from the dark side.

This is the night of lust.
Now is when you die!

With green hands I caress your hair.
Kiss me! Kiss me! Kiss me in depths of hell!

Love is a rebel bird that no one can domesticate.
And calling for help is in vain. We're going straight to hell.

Un, deux, trois.
Un, deux, trois.

Remember your hands around my neck.
I'm back to give you what you deserve.
I bite your head, feel the pain.
I eat your brain. Murder scene.

This is the night of lust.
Now is when you die!

With green hands I caress your hair.
Kiss me! Kiss me! Kiss me in depths of hell!

Love is a rebel bird that no one can domesticate.
And calling for help is in vain. We're going straight to hell.

Un, deux, trois.
Beg me more my Lord!
Un, deux, trois.
Beg me more my Lord!

Un, deux, trois.

Beg me more my Lord!
Beg me more my Lord!
Beg me more my Lord!
Beg me more my Lord!

With green hands I caress your hair.
Kiss me! Kiss me in depths of hell!

Love is a rebel bird that no one can domesticate.
And calling for help is in vain. We're going straight to hell.

Un, deux, trois.
