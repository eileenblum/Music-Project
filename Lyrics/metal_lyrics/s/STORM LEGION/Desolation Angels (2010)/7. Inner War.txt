We tear apart the foundation we were given
Since our nature allows the questioning
of what we are
Our torment given as a gift to use
for whatever purpose
And this is what we choose
Acceleration of the mind
to the level where we bend our universe
Mathematical mirrors of our organic perception
to level out and rest in total stride
In our ability to disconnect
ourselves from ourselves
Zoom out and separate from the
narrowing skyline
With no reflection of possible effects
We tear apart the foundation we were given
Since our nature allows the questioning
of what we are
Our torment gives as a gift to use
for whatever purpose
And this is what we choose
Mental war
Mental war
Mentar inner war
