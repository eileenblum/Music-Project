Dried out memories fragmented
Do you still remember the chain of events?
Reaching a point where you stand on a road
in solitude
laughing at the universe
And you ask yourself
why those random choices
ended up in unexplained conclusion
intake, expelled from the only place
where someone saw
who was there
when you were talking to the holes in the walls
and she could see what you saw
and you created your own separate universe
bleeding out frustrations
in mutual serene chantings to the being
that was your combined minds
communicating through your mouth only
her eyes bleached and faded away
burying what you owned in a deep black pond
and from there it still speaks to you through the
needle you left at the bottom
