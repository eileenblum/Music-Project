The flood gates are drawn
Permeate the soil
Crush the contract in your palm
And eat
The pain

And now
It feels like dispersal
The last place I left myself,
Has lost it's sense of self

Then after all of this is over
Where do you plan to go?
Just pack up your spirit
And leave a thank you note?
Lay side by side, just like the rest
Release yourself, because you asked for it

Brace yourself limited motions
Panic rushes up my face
Racing the angst
Trying just to repel from radical danger
Run

And I know it looks bad
But that's because our visions don't match
And I don't care to see otherwise

There's a demand to be damned
And I'm doing my part one last time

Thank you for participating
In
This productive assemblance
Your role will play crucially
For the next in line

Handing off my carcass

Call it an oblation
That is all what this was

Just an intricately fashioned
Procedure

Consumed by
Esoteric
Perpetuality
Everything I touch turns to sand
And
Falls from under
My
Feet
