Flash flood moods
And coping
Wrong again
Adhered me to this desperate feeling
While I'm still
Staring at the ceiling

Letter to the man who deemed
Himself debased

Not even my blood feels what is
Poignant to me, I cant wait until
You're looking at me the very same
Way I used to look up to you

Nobody really gets
The feeling

Bottom shelf life
And It's reeks of chemicals
The ether eats at his skin
Just like a curse

I stop shut down and stare

These manic aberrations
Cause my mind to oscillate
It's seems like there's only
Hostages
Here I don't believe in
The fate that draws near

Too much contemplation and
Negative debiety
Help
My head
It is the end
You're never reciprocated
By the ones you've abetted
