My past reflecting through my eyes
I'm about to jump this bridge so tell me as to why I shouldn't
This life is static, robotic.
Abeyant, in my head.
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
And its driving me mad

Lights flash by my eyes
But I won't sympathize
With myself anymore
I'm sick
With a skewed view
I can't handle it
Consuming what's left of my time

Calcified over time
Into something valueless
Anchored by this
Burden I keep
Take it from me
Take it from me
Take it all

Motion sickness
Has me spinning
Vertigo
And it's dizzying

As if You could decide anyway
What if I decided I don't want to say anything?
Thinking of the solace
In my heads like a home to me
Cycling through the phases keeps me wondering,
Endlessly

I don't know if I can bear with it
Dejection seizes comfort
Guess it doesn't matter I'm already
Exposed to this evil phenomenon
Rescind my life

Left foot planted
Firmly on the ledge,
Stagnant air with no time left
Quietly spoken to no one, under his breath
"They won't miss me and I won't miss this"

And As if from nowhere
A gestured unrevealed,
Purpose promised, power granted and knowledge prescribed
"I can take you somewhere, much better than here"
Almost familiar but the eyes tell of a warning sign

But then it was promised, I give you my word
Keep talking to yourself and you'll never be heard

It'll your life
It'll change our life
It'll change your life for the better
