This is the first step
Fogged up lens
With an empty vessel to match

Couldn't get to far without this
A sacrament for your passage

It's time you choose
Oasis is accepting donations
Just simply give your mind,
Your body, you're entire being

Let go,
Just give yourself to the cause
Forceful rejection, is the only option
Oh Lucky you, what are the odds
Just relax and let it run its course

Fostering a distaste for antiquity
While Still trying to latch on to sanity

Suicide was tantalizing but I cannot turn back
Witnessed all their operations as they're leering so sneeringly.
Members raising their eyebrows
Spectating

They talk amongst themselves while I'm strapped violently in the crypt of
The compound below to this fucking filthy examination table surrounded by
Each representative as they begin to to mumble forcing goblets of sour
Liquid down my throat as some sort of ephemeral initiation
Not much longer I'm feeling myself running from the sounds of terror
