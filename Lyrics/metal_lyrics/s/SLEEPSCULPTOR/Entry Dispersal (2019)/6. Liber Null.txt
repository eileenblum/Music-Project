[feat. Sean Richmond of Arsonists Get All The Girls]Thinking of home, feeling uneasy.
Am I trapped in this place?

Smirk as You act as a precursor
To the rats that devoured us

Gnawing at the
Walls Of this Maze will be
The Last
Last thing I do
Before I Wither away
Into dust

Beg
For assistance
As if
You deserve it

Choking on the words with a knife to my neck memories clouded
By all the blood flowing to my head

There is no free will
This chalice we drink.
On the contrary, this cup is not what
My kind of tea is

I feel my thoughts scattering on the floor in the pool of your blood
Nothing can bring you back
You cant make me whole again
Your love was everything
Your death meant everything to me
