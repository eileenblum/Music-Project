Filled with fear and exhaustion
At a breakneck pace, and it's taken in stride
Lack of air brings on
Acclimation
Keep muttering to yourself
You really wanna die?
Over stepping boundaries
And getting careless quickly
I think you see what I saw inside
Forget what you know and follow behind

Feel the pressure catching up with me
And who are you
Another face to blame?
I see the light at the end of the tunnel

Still this gut-drop feeling
Calamitous kismet I can feel
It gaining up on me
I can tell what's bothering,
Keep looking over your shoulder
Who knows if you'll make it promptly
I have been watching you struggle

And through it all, incessant
Memories that I've never known slip in and out,
Regressing into this antithesis

Feel the pressure catching up with me
And who are you
Another face to blame?
I see the light at the end of the tunnel

Why did I trust my gut again
And who am I
But a blank disgrace
About to be devoured by the gods

Everything I'm running from
Are things I can't perceive Under the gun

Cruel games are only played
By people who feel the same
But now I can't escape
