[feat. Carson Pace of The Callous Daoboys]It wasn't something that could be sustained
The words that seeped from your mouth
Or the starry eyed gaze
The houses we built were far too brittle
Painted is us drowning In a light so shallow

Accept the gift before you depart. A chance at an unforeseen opportunity
Of a lifetime
Erroneous notion

This is not what I signed up for
Blooming backwards
My roots
Reach towards
The time before

Mouth full of dirt, throat full of
Rustic passages
I shed my teeth and plant them into the earth

The last time you'll ever know yourself as you truly thought you would.
Slipped out of my psyche
Just needed a breather
Raw air stained my lungs
Never getting easier

Bound
To a place so minuscule
You think it'll make
All my baggage
Just disappear?
Wrap up your assets
You've become one of us
A ceremonial metamorphosis

We use prophets as fossil fuels
We call the heat wave a "mystery"
But she is earthly, she does not have a Captain
But many heads that are
Indistinguishable
I start to forget all your songs about nothing
