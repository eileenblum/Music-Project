We are all bound by this charismatic sect

How can you bask in the life you lead?
A grim place that you
Sunk your teeth into
And I bet you think
That I
Didn't see anything

Forked
Tongue
Persuasion
Is a
Bold attempt
To get a straight faced lie
From a shell

Gripping onto formidable dialect
Does nothing for you
When the
Swines blood
Stains your lips

Trigger the process of re-purpose there upon the giver will be taking part
As an offering.
Thank you for your being

You just heard it man, they chop up your body and fucking leave you for
Dead

The ground pulsates
The doors closing
