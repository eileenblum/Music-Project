No matter how far I go, I will always find my way back home. Things are far
from what they used to be, Iâll spend the remainder of my days pushing down my
memories of my childhood, and I will spend the rest of my nights grinding
teeth. Stop trying to build me up, Iâm a stray dog, Iâm a drifter, A drifter,
so do the world a favor and put me down, those are our hand prints in the stone.
