Just so you know, just for the record, I come to you all alone, I walk with
my mouth shut, but my eyes open wide, just so you know, just for the record I
come to you with empty hands. I never have had anything anyway and it seems,
that I never will, I will die with nothing
As I was, before you, as I am now, you should have known, I am nothing and with
nothing I come to you with empty hands
I could paint a most vivid picture of raw aggression, with the blood spilt from
your wound, a wound I created from my sharp tongue blade mind, and my dagger
like whit, id cut your throat before the air could leak that cellar like cavity
My vault of mind will capture those antics forever, never forgetting and when
im done, regurgitating this documentary of what I have seen and al I have learned
But then I say enough, I will never have anything, I come to grips with that a
long, long time ago, I come to you with empty hands
As I was before you, as I am now, I will never have anything I came to grips
with that a long, long time ago, as I come to you with empty hands
