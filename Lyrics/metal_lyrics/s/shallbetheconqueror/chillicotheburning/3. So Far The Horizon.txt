I could stand on the highest mountain, the highest point in the world, and I
would still feel so low. I can see the depths of the ocean from there, and it
is terrifying. I need some sort of change, some sort of reason to want to wake up.
The air is so thin Iâm always gasping for life, From up here I can smell the
smoke from the fires I started. The burning smell of hearts sourâs my face.
Thereâs reasons for my actions, it haunts me in my sleep.
I am obsessed with devastation, the vessels in my eyes start to strain the
tears flood my face, my breath smells of hate and disgust with the fact that I
reside here living here with you, under the pressures of walking with this
burden on my back this weight on my chest and these shackles binding me to earth.
Iâm standing still while the rest of the world had left me behind.
The people of this planet had let me down, so I will not treat you with respect
or even shake your hand, you made me so damn bitter so I fled to higher land,
now I stay in seclusion claiming mountains as my home.
But when Iâm forced to face the end I will bring you down with me , when we
meet on common ground facing this horizon.
Drown in these crashing waves, I will not lend a hand, the world spit in my
face and Iâm not afraid to watch it die.
