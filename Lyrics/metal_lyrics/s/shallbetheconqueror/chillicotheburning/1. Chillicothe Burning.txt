I slowly start to care less and less as I stand from the balcony of my best friends house.
Now I stand there fully aware in the middle of the night, watching my city burn.
Watching the rats run from the back alleys, and watching the people flood the
broken roads, as the damn broke from the pressure, I cant help but to feel swept away.
By the music that is the cries of the people, the dwellers, the mouth
breathers, the parasite that walk on the streets of my town, there is no smell
sweeter then the smell of arson.
Nothing, there is no other way to describe how warm I feel, the heat from the
fires, remind me that I got what I wanted, the power grows stronger as my city ignites.
You can have it all, you can take this town, burn the people with fire whatever
you have to do, do it.
I wont mind I will watch it all and at that point and time I slowly start to
care less and less as I stand from the balcony of my best friends house, I will
finally be able to sleep at night with nails now clenching the railing and a
smile on my face I watch it burn.
