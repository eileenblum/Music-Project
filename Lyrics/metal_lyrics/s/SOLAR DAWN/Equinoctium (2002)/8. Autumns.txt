Infliction
Knee-deep in tragedy
Anathematized 
Lifelong-seeded grief
Worn to a thread by
Recurrent distress
Sorrowful years of retrieval
Escaping into an asylum
Of dreams
Chemical cure of the soul

[Chorus:]
Last setback - Final defeat
No more going into reverse
This time the sun will set forever
On an empty shell of unconcern

Wading through waters of 
Frequent deceit
Suffering constant betrayal
Repeatedly stabbed in the chest
By mishap
Autumnal wasteland at heart

[Repeat Chorus]
