Here I stand
Upon the highest mountain of might
Gazing back at my life
Confessions I never thought
I would make
Now running through my head

[Chorus:]
Don't bring to light
What you cannot see
Dark are the deeds of night
Fallen reality
Suicidal fight
Never again to be

I have always believed in myself
Creator of my own destiny
Doubts, now clouding my mind
Storming through my soul
Will I stand the test of time?

Nothing lasts forever or so they say
But I hold the key to eternity
Kingdoms will crumble
And eventually fall
As I lau open the mysteries of life!
