I bid you welcome to chaos and need
My own utopia caught in a box
Same old patterns again!
The knowledge of survival is the way

[Chorus:]
Don't wait to face the failure
Reaching untouchable hands
Still we try to set things right - In vain!
Someone stop us from the wish
To alter our pain

I asked for honesty and trust 
A silent sanctuary built for me 
Same old story again!
My friend I know
This is the end - the end for sure!

[Repeat Chorus]
