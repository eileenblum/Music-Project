Sadistic behavior
One of a king
That leads his heard to fatal defeats
Words untold
Spoken in tongues
A perfect shield
Against the forces around

[Chorus:]
See through - Be realistic
You've lost your crown
But still you're a fake
A fake with blindfolded eyes
So damn sensational - Superior race
Someday you'll wake up screaming
For(Ever) More

False accusations
Several kinds
You will not reach
The point of eternal control

[Repeat Chorus]
