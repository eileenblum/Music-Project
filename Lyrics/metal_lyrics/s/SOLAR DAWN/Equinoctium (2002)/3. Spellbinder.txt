Insidous lords of utopian decay
Once on the throne of this world
Indoctrination, salvation or dismay?
Madness spawned by greed

Misanthropic conception
Equivocal beliefs
Misleading doctrin of deception

A reign of terror
And so the lie became the truth
Another debt to be repaid in blood
Decadence? 
Tha fatherland supreme
"Gods" of an air-drawn nightrealm

[Chorus:]
Hate - brought forth by fear
Painstaking cleansing of disgust
Stillborn future
Never-ending hunt
Visionaries of a fallen sphere

Originators of unjustified deceit
Authors of wholesale destruction
A kingdom arisen in ruins
An empire overthrown
