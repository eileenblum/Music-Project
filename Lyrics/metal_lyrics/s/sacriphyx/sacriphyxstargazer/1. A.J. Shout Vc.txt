[performed by Sacriphyx]A carpenter at reschs brewery and veteran of the Boer War
A regular at Randwick rifle range and yet he urged for more
So when England declared war on Germany, Australia did as well
Alfred John Shout swapped chisel for rifle for in war he did excel

Captain Shout was soon known as a cheery, well liked and brave man
And on landing at ANZAC cove into and at the enemy he did ran
He led an advance and captured territory known as Baby 700
Captured Turks were stunned as their belongings were quickly plundered

At Gaba Tepe although wounded, carried more than a dozen injured mates
Out of the firing line, to safety and out of reach of a doomed fate
Injured again his arm shattered but he refused to go to the rear
Third time wounded amidst his protests, from the line he was dragged clear

Then came the fateful day, he was thirty three and one day old
Clearing Sasse's Sap at Line Pine his VC medal citation is told
He charged through trenches with Captain Sasse who stabbed and shot
Whilst Shout used jam tin bombs to lob at all the Turks he spot

He lit three at the one time in preparation for the next assault
These crude homemade devices contained bullet shells and bolts
He threw one down the way and was about to lob another
When one of the remaining two was faulty and blew asunder

The explosion took his right hand, his left eye and part of his chin
Those near were shocked this red haired digger still managed to grin
Though hideously maimed and bleeding freely he directed the attack
In time stretcher bearers came and took his weakened body down the track

He remained positive that he would heal and soon return to the front
But those around him knew Lone Pine would be his final stunt
On ship on route to hospital, his heart failed, his soul set free
This brave VC winner died a hero and was solemnly buried at sea
