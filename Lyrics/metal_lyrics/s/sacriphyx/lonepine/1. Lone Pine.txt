Grunting with exertion they pried up the log roof
Those hardened Diggers who seemed somewhat aloof
Their snarling faces glared into the darkness below
Blackened figures hardly seen, swaying to and fro.

Curses uncounted and fighting unseen
In darkness they fought amidst uncanny screams
Inm pine covered trenches they night quickly came
An unlikely victory in a doomed campaign.

Twenty minutes of terror and they took the main trench
A prelude to four days fighting in a nauseating stench
But Lone Pine was for the keeping
A worthy victory at last
Though with two thousand casualties the cost, it seems so vast.
