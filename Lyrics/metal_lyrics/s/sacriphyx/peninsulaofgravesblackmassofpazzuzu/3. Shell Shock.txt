[performed by Sacriphyx]Buried alive yet once again, the earth heaves as though it breathes
A deafening roar and a wave of soil, the taste of dirt in the mouth it leaves

Dug out yet again by mates so dear
It's not the shrapnel now we fear

Buried for a minute you feel your mind slipping away
The second time it happens your nerves begin to fray

An unending barrage in this brown desolation
My soul has been shaken to its foundation.
