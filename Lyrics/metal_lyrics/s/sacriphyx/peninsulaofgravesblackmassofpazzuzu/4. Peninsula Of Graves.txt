[performed by Sacriphyx]The boats they held thirty
Strong tanned arms rowed them true
In front up high on ridges
Awaited turkish machine gun crews

Had they known what would happen
Once the boats scrapped the rocky shore
The would have bloody well rowed faster
To begin the terribly futile war

4:30 arrived with bullets
Death came raining down
Australians fell in numbers
As they leapt from boat to ground

25th of April, morning of the brave
The peak of adventure
A Peninsula of Graves

Many escaped death and injury
Adrenalin sent them up the slopes
The first to kill a Turk
Were many a man's hopes

They were told to spare their bullets
The bayonet they were to use
This was to the diggers' liking
The hellish landing had lit their short fuse

They swept Johnny Turk before them
Dug in on ridges high
They would get not much further
Though months would pass 'em by

25th of April, mourning of the brave
The peak of adventure
A Peninsula of Graves.
