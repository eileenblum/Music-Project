An endless bog
A sea of mud
A foul smelling mire
Of blood and guts

A wasteland of soggy brown
No other colour to be found
In this both men and mule drown
Was this really once a town?

The shells keep on coming
Is this place not miserable enough?
Can't keep dry, can't keep safe
Oh boy are we doing it tough

And the rain keeps on falling
And the War will not stop
We are told to fix bayonets
Over sandbags we must hop

But our artillery is useless
Not enough guns made it to the front
So in the bog we get torn to pieces
Because our heavy artillery had sunk

Damn this war
Damn the weather
Damn the generals to the rear
Damn the bullets
Damn the shrapnel
Damn this Passchendaele Ridge
