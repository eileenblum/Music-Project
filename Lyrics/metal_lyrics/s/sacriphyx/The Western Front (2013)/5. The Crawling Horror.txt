These beasts of steel seemed injured
With their squealing unwholesome sounds
Its awkward movements seems so painful
Mastery over no-mans land though found

Its visibility was useless
Their hides surprisingly weak
Its bulk screamed Industrial age
Forever crawling, This iron cage

Lurching, crawling, terrifying
Overheating, understeering, stalling
Cursing, sobbing, heartbreaking
Thrown into battle untried

Hoping to over run, cause mass panic and outflank
But hopeless was the maiden outing of the Mark I Tank
