Hear the cries from their tortured souls
See the architecture of life

As the inferior creature screamed for a sense
Nature remained silent
And as the pain of forlornness occupied itâs soul
It created vice and virtue and founded it on blood
It created a heaven for the hypocriticals and a hell of fire for the wisdom
And it invented an untrue word an with it â a false prophet

Blood on the dethroned God
His skull lies down in decay
Eye for an eye, and pain for pain
Ashes to ashes, and the cross to dust

And the son died for their sins and made them atone for life,
as his flesh began to smell of putrefaction
They began to worship a holy trinity, for showing them the way
To stagnation
So they followed and spread the tyranny, to force their will on earth

After 2000 years of reign in violence
The holy church of pain left an endless amount of mouldering graves
And these rusty swords bringing their alleged justice
Could not conceal the harassing falseness that lies deep within their souls
And as Christ opened the gates of heaven for the elitist pure, so did Lucifer
For the sinful true and gave Odin a throne by his side

Blood on the dethroned God
His skull lies down in decay
Eye for an eye, and pain for pain
Ashes to ashes, and the cross to dust

So you saints, revel in your dogmatic consecration
And believe in mental salvation
Suffer from Satan's power
As we suffered from your tyranny

Dethrone the God â who reigned these centuries of suppression
For his excruting death will end the reign of the bloodstained cross
Dethrone the God â whose ideology failed within its representatives
And the darkness will take the life out from his gilded temples

Blood on the dethroned God
His skull lies down in decay
Eye for an eye, and pain for pain
Ashes to ashes, and the cross to dust
