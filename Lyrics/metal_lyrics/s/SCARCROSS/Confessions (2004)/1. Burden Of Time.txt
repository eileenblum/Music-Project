An endless Universe, that endless time has grown
Formed by the hands of extinct Gods
A line up of moments, a static sequence of seconds
Untouchable by mankind

Time â the thread for the carpet of the three nornes
Time â constantly leading to our sudden ending

I wish for an endless moment
Filled with tears of joy or of pain
Something to tell me I am real
Something to show me Iâm alive

A stagnation of motion, experience the uniqueness
And all formed by the strength of my soul
The amalgamation of future and past, the extinction of present
Being lost in eternity

Time â an inexplicable phenomen for human mind
Time â genuine foundation for our lives

The indifference of days causes depression
The restless passing of hours causes obsession

I wish for an endless moment
Filled with tears of joy or of pain
Something to tell me I am real
Something to show me Iâm alive

The growing requirement for a break fills my soul
The desire for refreshing sleep fills my heart
Let time stand still
Let time stand still
Let time stand still
Let time stand still
