I am the warrior of pain
Darkness is my lonely fate
And as I wander through land and time
I search for a view of sense in this life

Been on the search for years
For anything that fills this torturing emptiness
I searched the myths
I searched the art
Been through the tears and through the bliss

As darkness falls onto the land
And the shadows reach for my soul
As even silence leaves me alone
And the sorrow is my last companion
The pipes call me to arms
For the eternal battle
So I search for my strength
In the myths of times long bygone

Oh you past heroes give me the might
Pray to ancient gods
In the halls of Avalon
So that I can raise my sword
And fight this hated life

[Chorus]

In the castle of grief
Itâs where you want me to be
Lost, beyond a wall of pain
Laid in chains of loneliness

But pain creates hatred
Which gives me the bravery
To fight in this lost battle
Against existence and to die

I hear death calling my name
In the winds of tomorrow
Someday I will follow
And pass away into the myths
To the eternal halls of Avalon

[Chorus]
