Rain is falling gentle on my hair, motionless I stand, on this cold autumnâs day
As the leaves spiral to the stable soil, the descending fog seems to reflect past days
And stubborn the trees camber under the pressure of soundless wind
Like my soul... standing and waiting

Flashing memories emerge from their mouldering graves, and spoil this deceptive idyll
At sunrise I am eavesdropping the wind...whispering my name

Pain and Sorrow, Fear and Death
Come for me, Release me from this world

I roamed the coldest mornings, and the darkest nights
I viewed my soul, thought I saw my ashes
But at this point of decision, I hesitate
I...AM...AFRAID

Like creeping cold, the fear covers my body
And prevents my from living
And the pain rises up again,
in the view of my inability

Another tear I shed for a lost moment
Still I stand motionless on this winterâs day
I am awaiting a new beginning
Hoping for destiny to prepare my lonely way
Never shall I be free
Never shall I feel inner silence
As the dew moistens me I kneel realizing
That I was born to die...

Like creeping cold, the fear covers my body
And prevents my from living
And the pain rises up again,
in the view of my inability

Like frozen trees I am standing in the shadows
Forsaken I try to melt in the sun
Forever I am trying, never finding the searched
Depraving stagnation surrounds my live
So another tear I shed for a lost moment
For a lost moment...
For a lost moment
