Bizarre, drunkard regalia
Deerstalker leisure tread
Bastard redneck discourse
Wrapped in rare bearskin

Caught up in the gears

Sip-thirty fox holes
Heavy drinking dress code
The crab walks sideways
A shambling kamikaze

Caught up in the gears

Caught up in the gears of application
Wisdom often never makes (an) appearance
Too rational to remain
Irrational for long

Gut extended like a septic tank
Fake agenda is a big mistake
We're not personas that you create

Zip the mouth like a hostage
Learn the names shoveled into graves

Gut extended like a septic tank
Feigned agenda is a big mistake
We're not personas that you create

The truth is just (a) fraud
Extensive criminal histories
Proof of allegations
Observer of taped-off scenes

Caught up in the gears of application
