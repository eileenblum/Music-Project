It's nice today
But not for long

Embrace the stay
Shrug off that duping swarm

Pave the way
To a power jockeying stalemate

You will
Ruin you

Kiss the ground
For it is yours--
Piss, spit and spray paint

Shit the bed
(Because) the oppressor
Is in your head

You will
Ruin you

It's nice today
But not for long

Embrace the way
For it is yours--
Piss, spit and spray paint

You will
Ruin you
