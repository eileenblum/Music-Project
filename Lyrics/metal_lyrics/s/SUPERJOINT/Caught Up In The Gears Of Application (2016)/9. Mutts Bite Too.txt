Mutts bite too

My pale skin
Doesn't begin
To tell the whole
Of the story that's old
And tired
The only "privilege"
Is the con of pigment
My bloodline runs deep

And that's not debatable
Because mutts bite too

Not everything
Is black or white
Wrong or right
Pegged on sight
To realize
Just how opaque we are
We must be
Fucking related someway

And that's not debatable
Because mutts bite too

Paint us containable,
But beware
That us mutts bite too

Point out our history
But check your own
Leave us alone
We want no part
Of the war
That would start
Individuals
Need no residuals

And that's not debatable
Because mutts bite too
Paint us containable,
But beware
That us mutts bite too
We are conflate-able
Now it's up to you
And that's not debatable
Because mutts bite too

Mutts bite too

We could give you
Something real to cry about
Stereotypes
Are perfect invites to laugh with

Learn to laugh with us
Learn to laugh at us

(Because) we all suck

We all are the worst

And that's not debatable
Because mutts bite too

Mutts bite too
And that's not debatable

It's not debatable

Sharpen your teeth on
Anti-sensationalism
Because us mutts
Will bite too
Sharpen your teeth
Because mutts
Will bite too
