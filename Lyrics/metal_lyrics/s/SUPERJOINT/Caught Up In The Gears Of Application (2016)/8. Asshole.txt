Lost the job, fucking sloth,
Dicked on rent, money spent

Shit comes out of that

Broke the word, bullshit heard,
Went to jail, won't get bailed

Shit comes out of that

Intimidation, placation,
Silent dissent, "the cause"
is spent -- (and) it goes
on and on... and on and on

Insert the verb
Goodnight dick
Trick the trick
Sick of sick

Thrive on hate
Pretend to equate
Without debate
(There's) no saving face

Slide through the scrum
Choke on the hate
Shit comes out of that

"The cause" is spent
(And) nothing came
Out of it
