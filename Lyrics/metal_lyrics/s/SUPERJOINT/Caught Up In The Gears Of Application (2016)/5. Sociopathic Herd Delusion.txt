Sociopathic
Herd-delusion
Hammered into form
In an escalating salvo
Time can't stop

(The) sociopathic
Herd-delusion
Shoved into the forefront
Fucking hypocrites
Time can't stop

The threat at the bottom
Comes from the top

Sociopathic
Herd-delusion
An aggressive fleshed fiasco
And the "one up" gamesmanship
Time does stop

They were floating
Yet anchored to the stars
And they were gloating
At the expense of ours
Blame
Games
Thicken the skin

Sociopathic
Herd-delusion
(Are) cameos
Of straight-jacket race
Time can't stop

Your time is coming
Your time is coming (soon)
