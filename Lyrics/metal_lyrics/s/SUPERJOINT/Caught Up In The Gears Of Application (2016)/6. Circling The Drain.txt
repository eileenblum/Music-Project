Don't count me out
But don't dare count me in (either)

We're leading nowhere
And that always leads somewhere

Those who stand neutral
Stand for absolutely fucking nothing

Call me nobody
And then blame it on my twin

We used to be drug addicts
Now we (just) take our medicine like men

She drinks more than most
Therefore she's soaked with wet

I am hungover
Therefore I'm hung, and over endowed

Call me nobody
And then blame it on my twin

I'm circling the drain

Tipping your server
Zero percent of zero

Flipping the script
Duct tape and tacks, is the right attitude

Spouting off angst
There is danger in applause

Call me nobody
And then blame it on my twin

I'm circling the drain

Call me nobody
Circling the drain

Call me nobody
Up the capitalist ladder
Call me somebody
(Then) directly back down again
Call me nobody
Just a spike in a flat line
Call me nil
Call me null
Circling the drain, I'm circling the drain
Just call me nobody
Circling the drain, I'm circling the drain
