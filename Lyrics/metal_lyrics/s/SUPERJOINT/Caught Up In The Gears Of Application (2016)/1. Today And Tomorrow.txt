Precious little companionship
Of family in the bloodline
A jungle in the cards
The murderous
Disastrous of existence
Transmission interference
Backslapping and chatting it up
A practice (we) could not stomach
Incite conservative outrage
With bizarre behavior

And trust no one

Picture-charming tippler
Descended grit construction

That paved the way to Golgotha
Further down the road

Unreeling, old and burning

Mourn a past innocence
(Now) replaced by (a)
Growing cynicism

Damned cut out

Unlike our predecessors
Convenient static

Spit lick crumbs

Killer friend
Killer small talk

Open close strip

Defacing denominator
Differences will occur

Self-demonization

Brilliant dick accent
Differences will occur

The snark of the faux

Killer friend
Killer small talk

Descended grit construction

Today's fuck-all
Is tomorrow's fuck you
Trust no one

Today's full-all
Is tomorrow's fuck you
Trust no one
