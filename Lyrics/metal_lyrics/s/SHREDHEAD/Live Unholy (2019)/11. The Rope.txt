Down with all of us, outstayed our welcome, the hosts are ravenous
No conciliation, no time is left to bring the death of a nation
No more recreation, it's all mindless actions, cogs in the machine
I have filled my tank with rage, leaking over all the paths I chose
I am the one that you died for
I'm your abandoned hope
I am your neck pressed against the rope
No divinity, the earth has spun out, smart to stupidity
Death of all reason. The clones have repossessed the world, the heart of God is eaten
Obsession, obsession in our heads, we'd rather all be dead, a bullet to the head
Front to the back view
I am the one that you died for
I'm your abandoned hope
I am your neck pressed against the rope
Hopeless, loveless, fear of desire, obsession and greed
I care, I swear
Hopeless, loveless, fear of desire, obsession and greed
It all has become to be the last stand of defeat
