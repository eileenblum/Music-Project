You lying son of a bitch of a man, remember who you belong to, do you?
Pass it through you
Sleep through apocalypse wake to the sound of everybody leaving you here all alone
Leave you
So fall for me now
Obsess for me now
Please die for me now
Break apart my body and my soul
Rearrange it all to build my home
Brick by brick I'm building the wall, thousand miles of bones under stones
Down we fall, down into the past that we already know
Evolve four mouths, you gluttonous swine,
So you can try to feed the empty void inside
The rejected
The lips of the abyss have closed, inside a fetus grows to manifest
Nothing
Nothing
So fall for me now
Obsess for me now
Please die for me now

Break apart my body and my soul
Rearrange it all to build my home
Brick by brick I'm building the wall, thousand miles of bones under stones
Down we fall, down into the past that we already know

Live unholy now
I never thought about the hopeless possibilities to walk in a circle and desire
To let it all fall apart on top of me
Orphans walk through the ashes of love,
Love that left them to slowly die and disappear
And the clock is ticking away
Take me
I have lost all count of my lifetimes
Hold me
The allure of staring straight into my enemy
This house is not my home
It'll never open for me
It's mine and mine alone
But it isn't open for me
This house is not my home
It'll never open to me
It's mine and mine alone

The only way is down
