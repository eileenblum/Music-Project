Depressed alcoholic sociopathic perversion
Smoke in a jar, compressed into a bleeding great black hole
Forged by a one note song
Hope kills more than death you will see the way
There is nothing to die for. Hope is a mistake
Progress is not a word, we live in a backwards implosion
Burnt history, idiocracy, and occasional genocide
Forged by a one note song
Hope kills more than death you will see the way
There is nothing to die for. Hope is a mistake
Skin melts in the thick boiling blood
Never saw it all end this way
So abrupt and obscene
Surface dwelling rotten creature, chew on the lifeless strings
Euthanize all of life
Prepare a knife for the dinner table, tonight we dine on the backs of the deceased
Pale ghost, shadow of hate has come to claim back its loan
Sick industry, where no slave is free, and all food is the same old dust
Forged by a one note song
Hope kills more than death you will see the way
There is nothing to die for. Hope is a mistake
