Fingers are clawing the air
Sights locked on me
Scythe in my sight has advanced too
Close to my throat
I am one
And you are many
Suffocating in breathless promise

The only reason to be alive
Set it all to collide

Run to the wall, impale your souls, sing to me
Death and destruction sanctify
No word to bring the end of this hell

Foreign languages fall
We burned them all
The pen has befriended the sword
It calls my word
All alone
No one is here to face us
Dominate
Burn compassion, create hate

The only reason to be alive
Set it all to collide

Run to the wall, impale your souls, sing to me
Death and destruction sanctify
No word to bring the end of this hell

Everybody hung up on a tree. Shut the fuck up!
Thanks to me you're all finally free
Let's hear you say, "Hey! hey!" Sing it to me
Let it all flow down the river, mix the blood with the sea

Divide and conquer
