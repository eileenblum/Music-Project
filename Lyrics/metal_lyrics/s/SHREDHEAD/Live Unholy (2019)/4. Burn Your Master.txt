Only once must the demon be fed
Only twice held a gun to my head
A loveless sacrifice
Emptiness in a bag of loose skin
Stare straight into the sun
Where you sent your dreams to burn
Burn your master
Burn the whole damn town
A natural disaster
Born from the bastards crown
Burn your master plan
A fictitious tail, as are you
Born from the shame
Holy war in the kingdom of heaven
Dressed in gold and a body full shaven
The king has killed his son
His only child, placed his head on the crown
A state of determent, always static indestructible hell
Stare straight into the sun
Where you sent your dreams to burn
Burn your master
Burn the whole damn town
A natural disaster
Born from the bastards crown
Burn your master plan
A fictitious tail, as are you
Born from the shame
It's all for me, the division of truth, the untruth, the seven seas
It's all for me, from the rise to its fall, and all of death in between

Burn your master
Burn the whole damn town
A natural disaster
Born from the bastards crown
Burn your master plan
A fictitious tail, as are you
Born from the shame
