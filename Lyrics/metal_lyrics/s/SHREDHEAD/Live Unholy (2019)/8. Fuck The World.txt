We pushed it to the end and still we're going nowhere
The probabilities all swept away from us
The lines have faded. Honesty traded
For what? A fix? The devil playing tricks
It broke me
Broke me
Pain, my oldest of friends
It never backs down or pretends
Stays close to me, you're all my enemy
And all that I've got to say is
Fuck the world
They pushed us to the end; we're falling into nothing
They made us eat the rotting nails of leper whores
Force fed, we beg for lust
We're caged in the dust
We're dust
Pain, my oldest of friends
It never backs down or pretends
Stays close to me, you're all my enemy
And all that I've got to say is
Fuck the world
No penance today
A flock led astray
I can just feel it arise in my veins
It'll just keep boiling up 'til the mob has my throat slit
Pain, my oldest of friends
It never backs down or pretends
Stays close to me, you're all my enemy
And all that I've got to say is
Fuck the world
Fuck the world and all its obsessions
Fuck the world like the world has always fucked me
