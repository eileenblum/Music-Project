All for me, this killing spree
I'm higher than god! Bow down to me!
These walls I've built to keep you in
My masterpiece
Entertain my lust for blood
I dance around the burning corpses
Hail my name until the day I die
Can't wait to see it end

This is your life, your slow defeat, I say who gives a fuck
You lost it all from rise to fall. I guess you're out of luck
This universe, it gives no shit if you are here or not
Sit and wait here for the end
You universal shit
You universal fucking shit
Child king, in his dream
The sun ate the moon, lights vanishing
The roots of rivers climb to grab the feeble legs of gods
A cutting edge, a prophecy
Nails dance on a lake of blood
The time is here, rejoice
Can't wait to see it end
This is your life, your slow defeat, I say who gives a fuck
You lost it all from rise to fall. I guess you're out of luck
This universe, it gives no shit if you are here or not
Sit and wait here for the end
The earth has formed into a demon
It reeks of life. Decaying, pulsing maggots fill it to the brim
Black mounds arise to reach the heavens to break the sky
And let the thick black ooze down covering us

It all comes down to this
Not your belief or your pride
But the day, the day we all die
'Cause for all that we know we could all be just ones and zeros
This whole life could be just a flame in the wind
And no one gives a fuck
Not me
Not your family
Or god
(I'm) broken glass, step on me I'll bury deep inside
A parasite of human life. A heated knife
I've come to take control
I have seen it all before, can't wait to see it end
This is your life, your slow defeat, I say who gives a fuck
You lost it all from rise to fall. I guess you're out of luck
This universe, it gives no shit if you are here or not
Sit and wait here for the end
