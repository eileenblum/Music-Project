Suck it! Stop it! Spit it! A dog without a leash will run away and die
You miserable being
Never have I before seen such a pitiful attempt for the abuse of madness
We always were alone
The only life in here
Is condensed desperation
He's soulless skin and bones
Sells the heart for broken stones
In an unmarked location
Suffer my sword. Suffer my pain only it will free your from the
Clutch of despair
Feel every cut in your skin. You ordered the attack
Time came to take you back
Tongue for an eye
Never comply
Suffocate, killing it
It falls then it dies
We always were alone
The only life in here
Is condensed desperation
He's soulless skin and bones
Sells the heart for broken stones
In an unmarked location

Stab me
Drive the knife into me
When my back is turned
Take it and throw it around hope that it hits the mark that is me
You'll see my death is free

We always were alone
The only life in here
Is condensed desperation
He's soulless skin and bones
Sells the heart for broken stones
In an unmarked location
