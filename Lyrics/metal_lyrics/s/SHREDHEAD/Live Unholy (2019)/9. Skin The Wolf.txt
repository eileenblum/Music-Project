Your break is now over, return to your seats
Look at the crack in the wall, breath the air in
It's filled with disease
Just like all of us soldiers, we arise, we despise the men that have brought us into this world.
Shivering and cold
Broken code. Overload
The end is near I see it clear as day
It's all that I've ever wanted
Withholding suffocating truth
Vultures circle above me
The storm clouds have fallen
To create fire that walks on this earth
And it burns all the good of this world
So all that would be left is you
They're your mother, your father
They're your judge, your jury, your kings
They're your gods
Pulling the strings of your will and command
You mindlessly walk through the sand
Broken code. Overload
The end is near I see it clear as day
It's all that I've ever wanted
Withholding suffocating truth
Vultures circle above me
The waves crash against the walls of time
The pillars are wasting (away)
The oceans have crossed into the sky
And swallowed my pride
Please drown me
The words that I've spoken
Are now but nothing is broken
The walls an illusion
A truth not (found)

The end is near, I got to see the day
I turned the world, I didn't feel
I am feeling forgotten in sleep
And I know it's true,
And I don't give a fuck about all that you do
I say all this to you, so you can too feel
Sucked out every light I've ever known

Only nine years to skin the wolf
