Only yesterday I told you that I forgave you
Did you forget? Or did it all get in your head?
I should have known
Hard to trust the words of devils, not the priests
Yet it's the priests who deceive you

Wicked, sober, stupid, older. A party of me
There's no one, you see? Only me

Turn
Let go of me and this life
Spray the decay around you
Leave me now

Sun has dried the lake, the bones of fish guard from intruders
One step to bleed. Take one step, you'll fucking bleed
Irony forged at the feet of the all knowing monster gods
Was it they who deceived me?

Wicked, sober, stupid, older. A party of me
There's no one, you see? Only me

Turn
Let go of me and this life
Spray the decay around you
Leave me now

It follows, overshadows
The only place I've ever belonged
No pressure, you gotta treasure the suffering as if it were gold
Yea, no way in
You cannot live forever alone
Someone to piss on whenever there's pain
This time my pain is nobody's gain
