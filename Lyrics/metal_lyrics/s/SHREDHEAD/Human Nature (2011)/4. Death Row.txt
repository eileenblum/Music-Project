Anger! Violence! Deadly Silence! Rage is all I see
No regrets for my mistakes, there's no remorse for me
Running fast to get away the feds are getting close
I can't be caught, I will not stop! This path is what I chose

Running fast to get away, running from my yesterday
Getting caught has marked my end, sentenced to the

Death row! Sentenced to the death row!
The motherfucking death row! Sentenced to the death row!

Muscles aching! Labored breathing! Loosing all my strength
Running hard to get away and still I'm out of breath
Screaming voices in my mind have never been so loud
I can't recall the rest of it is in a bloody cloud

Strapped down to a metal seat, this can't be, I can't be beat
Getting caught has marked my end, sentenced to the

Death row! Sentenced to the death row!
The motherfucking death row! Sentenced to the death row!

Electricity feels cold, it's running down my veins!
Forcing all my insides out, this really is my end

The world has cheered them on as they got rid of this disease
A mad man with a knife and gun got killed, they smile they're pleased!

Death row! Sentenced to the death row!
The motherfucking death row! Sentenced to the death row!
