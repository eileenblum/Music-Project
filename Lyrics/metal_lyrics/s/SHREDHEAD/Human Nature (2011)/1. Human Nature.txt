The air is filled with thick black smoke
I hold my breath, try not to choke
My eyes are burning, can't see my hands
Can't call for help, my friends are dead
For days on end the mushrooms sprang
For days on end the sirens rang
But now the quiet is the worst
They're close, I feel it, lock the doors

Deformed creatures fill the land and survivors aren't fighting back

Human nature! To kill ourselves!

Food is growing rare and scarce
The week are losing in this race
All that's left is next to none
And still we die, one by one
And as we fight the danger nears
The deformed creatures have their needs
I see them coming in the dark
I feel a sharp pain in my back

Look behind and see the face of true threat to the human race

Human nature! To kill ourselves!
Human nature to fight ourselves - Inside!

Fight! To live! Live! To die! Fight! To kill! Kill! to die!

Human nature! To kill ourselves!
