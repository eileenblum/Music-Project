Blood she'd eyes that stare with hate
And innocent souls rise to the sky
For politics, this murder
Terrorizing us

Rockets, filling the air
Look up, they're falling down
Sit high up in their chair
Horns blow, this is red dawn

You think you can decide what is right what is wrong
What's more important, human life or some god
Women and children, now they are all dead
And no one can wash this blood on thy hands

Ideals filling their minds
They want us all to be dead
Their blood thirst is one of a kind
They're mad, they're losing their heads

You think you can decide what is right what is wrong
What's more important, human life or some god
Women and children, now they are all dead
And no one can wash this blood on thy hands
On thy hands

Blood on thy hands!
