Raped in an alleyway at night
Black eyes stare in to yours, your cries are my delight
No one is here to hear you scream
You only wish this nightmare was just a dream

Thoughts are regressing in your head
A creeping thought that says I want you to be dead
You try to fight me yet once more
Your useless trials are a failure, nothing more

His shrikes of joy outweigh your pain
You wish you had stayed home
Your innocence is taken by an old and ugly boar

Rape victims all around, we sit by as they take us
No one is left to fight, they are the child takers
Painfully set aside, a rape of huge proportions
Suffering as we go down, the fault is our dependence

Dark fog is creeping in your soul
Inside your mind your heart is turning into coal
There are no screams from you by now
You take it like a fact
There's nothing you can do

Rape victims all around, we sit by as they take us
No one is left to fight, they are the child takers
Painfully set aside, a rape of huge proportions
Suffering as we go down, the fault is our dependence

I've watched you die a thousand times, in a thousand different ways
So naive and innocent, I've watched as you decay

Rape victims all around, we sit by as they take us
No one is left to fight, they are the child takers
Painfully set aside, a rape of huge proportions
Suffering as we go down, the fault is our dependence
