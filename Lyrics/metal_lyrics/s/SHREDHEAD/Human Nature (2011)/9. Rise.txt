Kindling, all lit up, burning up, let's start a fire!
Throw in some more wooden corpses and let it burn higher!
We tell ourselves that it's not us it's their own demise
Death and despair measured in a world wide suicide

Heat! Rotting souls! Burning flesh! Red hot coals!

Playing with matches, we scream as the children are dying!
It's not our fault, didn't know, yet the mothers are crying!
Well, it's to late, start a new, as the evidence burns!
No, I do care, we all kill, lets all take turns!

Heat! Boiling! Blood stained hands! We descend!

Listen how the story goes, peoples' death, a noble cause
We all say we always care, for the world!
Holocaust in Africa, insufficient ethics, yea!
No one dares to lend a hand, no one cares!

You can try to tell me that you gave your share
You lying piece of shit!
World wide news shows the distress, you only ask for more!

Burning faces on TV, screaming children! Can you see?
Politicians on the news, say they care!
Ask for help that you won't give! You forget but don't forgive
Misconception of the world, burning hell!

You can try to tell me that you gave your share
You lying piece of shit!
World wide news shows the distress, you only ask for more!

Rise from the fire and see your mistake!
You are all followers your words are fake!
