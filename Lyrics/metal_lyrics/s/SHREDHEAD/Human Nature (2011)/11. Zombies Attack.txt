Hunger! In my mind! Causing me! To Kill!
Violence! In my thoughts! Making me! Hunt them Down!
Poison! In my veins! In my brain! I'm insane!
Flesh! What I crave! My desire! ZOMBIE ATTACK!

The whole damn army can't stop what I've become
The goddamn government should die for what they've done
Condemning human kind to an existence full of pain
Corps's coming alive! I smell the blood! ZOMBIE ATTACK!

I killed your family! I ate their heads
I split their skulls in two! And ate their brains
Writhing in their blood! It's your turn next
The dead rise from their graves!

ZOMBIE ATTACK!
