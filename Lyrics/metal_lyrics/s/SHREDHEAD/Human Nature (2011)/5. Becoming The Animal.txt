Explosions in the sand
Grenades held in your hand
Painful death is slow
Dying in a row

To make a fast decision
You have to think real fast
To survive on intuition
You have to become
The animal!

Pick up your rusty knife
Destroy what was your life
Look them in their eyes
Now stab until they die!

To make a fast decision
You have to think real fast
To survive on intuition
You have to become

Blood that fills your every pour and bullets cut in to the core
You're running in to waist deep holes
You pray to god to get you home
And as you rise to make your stand
You realize that you have to become

Wookies fucking rule!

To survive the battle field, to get yourself back home
You have to change yourself, yea you have to become

In the end of all that's through
And still I can't bring myself to
Get up to make my own last stand
These animals are dying as of now!

To survive the battle field, to get yourself back home
You have to change yourself, yea you have to become
