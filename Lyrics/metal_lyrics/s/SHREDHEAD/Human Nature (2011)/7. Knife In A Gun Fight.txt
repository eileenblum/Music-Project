A rare disease, anomaly
Not cleverness, stupidity
The thoughts behind this bravery
Are absent in my memory

Run in to
Fights, can't get
Enough, I'm blind to
All, I'm blind

Execution, exploitation, not a hint of moderation
Running blindly with my knife to fight against a gun

Standing still, for fear of death
Surrounded by the enemy
Not a chance that I can win
A knife against a gun

Execution, exploitation, not a hint of moderation
Running blindly with my knife to fight against a gun

Knife in a gun fight

Execution, exploitation, not a hint of moderation
Running blindly with my knife to fight against a gun
