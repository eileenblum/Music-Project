The sound of betrayal does not always come in a loud screech
Nor is it that hard for it to be reached. Its multiple tones

The sound is reached!

Blame the innocent! The ones who stand there
Die in discontent! Last words are lost on me!

Scream innocence! Spit your lies just to run free
Spit on us all and betray us once more. Playing the chords
Break your legs while you are running from responsibility
Crawl with your arms to escape the defeat. Crawl 'till they break

The sound is reached!

Blame the innocent! The ones who stand there!
Die in discontent!

Drill in deeper in your hole
Shut the cover Contort the ball
Dive to the darkness and sell out your soul
Shut the cover. Last words are lost!

No legs to run on now. No hands to help you crawl
No mind to comprehend. The closing of the end
What else do you want me to do?

The sound is reached!

Blame the innocent! The ones who stand there!
Die in discontent! Last words are lost on me!
