I close my eyes and the pictures they come to me
The drunken truths of life drill in to deep for comfort
I scream my pain out loud for everyone to hear
Dark shapes and teeth surround me, I can't hold this fear

Hallucinations, seeing without my eyes
Just staring at walls, staring with blank filled mind

My face is melting in to thin repulsive shapes
The walls are crawling with remains of faces I loved
But soon enough those faces quickly turn on me
Lash out their claws and then they change shape in to me

No pain, it's all gone now. No fear for I am dead
No sense of where I am now. There's no way back!

Faded! Frustrated! Dependant!

Break all you will be. Nothing to see
Nowhere to be found. Everything is gone
Can't comprehend the pictures in my head
Nowhere to be found. Everything is gone

Hallucinations, seeing without my eyes
Just staring at walls, staring with blank filled mind

Aggression! Depression!
Aggression! Depression! Hallucination!

No pain, it's all gone now. No fear for I am dead. No sense of where I am now
There's no way to turn back, no peace of mind. My face is blind
