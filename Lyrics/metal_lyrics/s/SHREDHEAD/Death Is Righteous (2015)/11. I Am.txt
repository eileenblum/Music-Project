A walking demon on the grounds of heaven
Standing under the white neon gloom
Consuming devotion and turn it to hate
No one is here around us
To witness me trounce your faith
Hatred shame and dejection
I'll swallow your pride
And turn it into coal and air

FUCK!

I am walking death. Death disguised as man
I am the disease. Mass murder as I spread
I am nothing, but a man full of regrets
If you want pain come and see me now
For I am death

Regrets became my dearest friend
I am now a naked man
Forget me now my love
For I've made you pay my debt, my burden
Like a punch to the nose, like a shot to the head
A lethal dose of mistakes
Like a needle to the vein
Addicted to the hurt

I am walking death. Death disguised as man
I am the disease. Mass murder as I spread
I am nothing, but a man full of regrets
If you want pain come and see me now
For I am death

Yes I'll confess I'm scum of the earth
Taking all and giving nothing
I wont lie I would like to see me die
Death becomes more appealing then life

Can't see myself live no more
Wanting the poison deeper
Push it into my veins deeper
Can smile only when high
Can laugh only at someone
Please oh please just drag me down

I AM! I AM!
I AM! I AM!
I AM! I AM!
