The cost of life is not just air nor is it flesh or blood
And happiness is measured by a standard no one found
Getting fat and rich they sit with crowns of jewels and gold
While others eat mouthfuls of shit to carry out their word

Blame the faults of man
He who created this game
Of money power and pain

Money is the word. Success is measured by living when you're old
Sell your youth away for gold

Push and shove to lead the path of moneys' greed and pain
Loose your name inside this game of never ending gain
Kill and steal what you can carry then hire some assistance
Let them steal for you. You pay them. Expansion of existence

Blame the faults of man
He who created this game
Of money power and pain

Money is the word. You can control the world
From behind the scenes the poor will pay your price

Pay the price that's taken, you pulled your soul and life
Your heart and mind are broken. You sold the parts for
Power with no meaning. You have no point of being
Time to blame the others, they're partners in your
Crimes!
Your lies!

Blame the faults of man
He who created this game
Of money power and pain
The shame. No one to blame
You've lost everything in this devil's race
