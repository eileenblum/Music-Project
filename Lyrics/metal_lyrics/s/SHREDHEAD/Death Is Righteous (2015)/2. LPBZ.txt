Blind you walk in to the burning fire
Fear is out of your control
You fall and burn your flesh is ripped to pieces
See your prophesy unravel

Why do you cry?

Burning smell of poison reaching the heavens. There is no protector
I won't be the one who created you can't be the one who created you

Heed my words, you'll see they're probably your
Last thing you'll hear
Don't try to save yourself and no one else, don't be a hero
Last prophet burning Zion

Lay to die

Burning smell of poison reaching the heavens. There is no protector
I won't be the one who created you can't be the one who created you

Heed my words you'll see I'm right
This is your last day alive

Pray to no god
Burn in silence

Burning smell of poison reaching the heavens. There is no protector
I won't be the one who created you can't be the one who created you
