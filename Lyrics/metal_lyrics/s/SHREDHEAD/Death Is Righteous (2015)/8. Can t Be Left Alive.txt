Praying, praying for forgiveness from the
Figure of resonating silence comes the
Screaming of thousand long lost children
Hungry starving for maternal affection
Must they starve? Must they?

I will not present ''me'' as your sacrifice
I know that I have to. Can't be left alone
This feeling inside of me makes me cough up blood
World shattered, words muttered. I can't be left alive!

Searching, searching for the silence from this
Violence thrashing in my thoughts in the
Dead of night I sweat my bed profusely screaming
Hunger I'm starving for attention
Let me starve. I must starve

I will not present ''me'' as your sacrifice
I don't know what's happening in this world of mine
Starving, I'm starving for a breath of smoke
Give me some poison and let it do the work

Give me some poison. Let it do the fucking work
Give me the poison, and let it do the work

Drink up the sorrow. Let it in your veins
Don't push it out of your system not just yet
Yes let is break your bones, yes let it take your breath

Let it take your breath!
