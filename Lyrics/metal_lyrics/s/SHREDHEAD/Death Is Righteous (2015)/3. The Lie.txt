It started out slow as meaningless blabbering to make face on to you
Stories and wants and dreams that I have, everything you know it wasn't true
'Cause I am the man and I know everything. My world has gone to shit
I have control. Trust me I know what to do. Don't I believe in you?

It's me! Running away from it all
All that you know is lies. Am I responsible?
To be sinking inside my own shit. You know who I am?
I'm scum! I'm dirt! I'm slime! I lied!

Going around and telling myself I'm not hurting friends, family
Telling myself I can't control anything, that I don't know who ''me'' is
Standing alone with feet to tired to hold on I'm thinking I cannot stand
Bullshit! I'm just using all my strength to run away. Can't handle that I'm scared

It's me! Running away from it all
All that you know is lies. Am I responsible?
To be sinking inside my own shit. You know who I am?
I'm scum! I'm dirt! I'm slime! I lied!

Won't you give me your hand? Help me change myself

THE LIE!
THE LIE!
THE LIE!
THE LIE!
