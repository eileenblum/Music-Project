The fear to not belong gnaws deep inside my brain
Spreading like a disease it boils to a pain and it says to me
''Pretend, cheat and lie. Leave all your worries behind
Everything will be alright just close your eyes and let it go!''

Let it

Pain will flood. Blood will come
Suffering, consuming life
The will of mind is at its' end
Death is righteous to us all!

Violent thoughts appear in turn to poison my young mind
The anger calling me, pulling at my life line
''Come on! Lash it out now! Burn everything you love
For what you love has turned on you and made you hate!''

Made you

Pain will flood. Blood will come
Suffering, consuming life
The will of mind is at its' end
Death is righteous to us all!

I'm scared, I'm lost
I'm not sure that the cost
Is worth my pain
Donât know if it's just shame

I fear to fail I fear to try I lose control of fear at times
Lash out at goals that seem too far I burn them to the ground

After this life of suffering
Sickness of fear and doubt to no end
I think that death, death will be righteous
I think that death should be OK
