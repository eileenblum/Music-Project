Run away, hide away. Lose your name in violent play
Forget why you should fear the ending of this year
Turn away from your friends. Throw courage, let ego in
Let it rot deep inside, let it be your guide

If you can't forget then I won't forgive

Get ready for the storm. You wait for it to come
Blissful sprint into the wall. The mindless ignoring the call
Spit out bleeding spiteful words. Embrace the end of it all
Witness your hell!

Push away in disgust from a life of greed and lust.
But the past you left behind is gaining on you fast
Thrash around in seas of blood you bled when you were young and dumb
Gasp for breath while clotting seas close in on your last chance

If you can't forget then I won't forgive

Get ready for the storm. You wait for it to come
Blissful sprint into the wall. The mindless ignoring the call
Spit out bleeding spiteful words. Embrace the end of it all
Witness your hell!

The tides will turn. The dark will burn. The dead is born
The seed of doubt has quickly grown in to a man

No way out. No way back

Scream at us
Turn on your back and ask death of us
Tear the insides
Bleed for us, cry to us
No way out of this hell

Witness hell!

Give up hope. It's your last. Face down on the ground you lay
No more tears, no more pain. Reached end of your game
Turn around and scream out loud at the thought that it's too late

Away you drift farther into the deep
If you can't forget then I won't forgive

Get ready for the storm. You wait for it to come
Blissful sprint into the wall. The mindless ignoring the call
Spit out bleeding spiteful words. Embrace the end of it all
