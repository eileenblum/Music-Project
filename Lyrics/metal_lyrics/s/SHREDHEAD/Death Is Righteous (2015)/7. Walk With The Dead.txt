Never sleep, not too deep, night or day
Never think, let your brain cells all decay
Try. Try. Control yourself, try to shut your eyes
Boiling, itching, dead night screaming
Hallucinate your life before you die

Go back and walk alone

Walk

Come, and be my puppet my
Son, and when you are
Done, go back to walk with the
Dead, go back to walk with the

Not alive, not quite right in the head
Yes you breathe, but you can just as well be dead
Lost. Lost. ''Where am I?'' what's that rancid smell?
It's you that smells of old decay
Don't sleep, lose grip, just slip into my hell

Go back and walk alone

Walk

Come, and be my puppet my
Son, and when you are
Done, go back to walk with the
Dead, go back to walk with the

Around you walk for miles with a feeling of regret
Not knowing why you hold the gun and ask "am I dead yet"?

Over dose on your sleeping pills
Bow your head, obey to my will
Slip away and drown in the dream
Bleeding eyes wake up to the scream

Can't hang on, losing grip, you are up
Oh the joy, it's another sleepless night
Stop. Stop. Stop the scream, can't handle anymore
Pick up the knife, and end my life
I'm cutting deep, oh sweet death here I

Come, and be my puppet my
Son, and when you are
Done, go back to walk with the
Dead, go back to walk with the dead
