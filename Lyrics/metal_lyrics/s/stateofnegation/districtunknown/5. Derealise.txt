Derealise, I feel the tension of the world around me,
face cold as ice, Iâm going through the floor itâs getting more,
my head feels empty yet about to explode
the more you beat the mind I see the less you can break the code

Itâs getting emptier, I want it to clear, start up again
Itâs getting emptier, I want it to clear, start up again

Think clear, youÂ´ll see, you can break free [4x]

Depersonalise
I donât see who I am
My memories are lies, or not I donât know
whatâs philosophy now when nothing else matters
blank sheets or not, what do you want from me world?

Itâs getting emptier, I want it to clear, start up again
Itâs getting emptier, I want it to clear, start up again

Think clear, youÂ´ll see, you can break free [4x]

Iâm breaking free of this Iâll break out of this hole
the meaning of this life lies graved into my soul
Iâll smash down every wall, Iâll break the walls of fear
Iâll smash down every wall until my mind is clear

I live, I breathe, I am, who I am [8x]

Thanks to tristan_1989 for sending track #5 lyrics.
