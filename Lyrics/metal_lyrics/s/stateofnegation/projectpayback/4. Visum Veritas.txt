Visum Veritas, to see it to believe, but does this mean the blind forever are deceived. 
In this word no candor, no veracity, but prevarication, merely forgery

Sing to me now

See the truth, without sight,
Feel the truth, with knowledge by my side

tongues of madness, the terror of speech, bliss of the speechless with no verbal reach
Interrogations with your will to breathe, just close your eyes, of the heath

Sing to me now, speak to me now

See the truth, without my mind
Feel the truth, with knowledge by my side

Cant, see, cant, feel, cant, stand, cant, understand

Visum Veritas, to see it to believe, but does this mean the blind forever are deceived. 
In this word no candor, no veracity, but prevarication, merely forgery
tongues of madness, the terror of speech, bliss of the speechless with no verbal reach
Interrogations with your will to breathe, just close your eyes, of the heath

sing to me now, speak to my now, pray for me now

See the truth, without sight
Feel the truth with knowledge by my side
