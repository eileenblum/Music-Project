When you walk in the light
Become before the light, through the light.
As you enter the walls and shelter the thoughts
Of your lightless life.

AAAAAAAAGH-

Your entire lifeÂ´s a fucking lie
composed of ink and steel and stone and
craving for attention of the light
you fucked it up youÂ´re fucking

Killing free
Reality-
Your lies-

And every drop of wisdom you wont see

Light [4x]
Your worthless words are shame
You'll never see a
day-
Your worthless words are weak
pray-
Your words are worthless and
weak-
Your worthless words are weak
pray-
Your words are worthless and
weak-

AAAAAAAGH-

Your fucking
hypocracy knows no end
Others their will to bend
Living your life like a rat in a cage, pre-

Tending to-
"all-knowing you"-
enslaved-

By every drop of wisdom they feed you.
Light [4x]
Your words are worthless and weak
You'll never breath again.

Enter
the walls and shelter 
the thoughts of your 
lightless life
lightless life.

Light [4x]
Your words are worthless and weak
You'll never breath again.
