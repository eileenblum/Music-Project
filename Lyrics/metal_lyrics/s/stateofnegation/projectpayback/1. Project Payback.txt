IEEEEYAAAAAA :D

Self-righteous, self-manageable, this is the destruction of all
This is what has been rotting, what will rot on for years on and on,
Scarification and mutilation, annihilation for all,
Sacrificing for all thatâs right and all thatâs left to love

Oooh, project payback

What you know of me is what you see of me
what you see of me is everlasting payback

IEEEEYO :D

Will you come with me, will you stay with me, will you stay till the end of our days
we will bring it out, we will bring it loud, we will shout at the top of the crowd
We bring reason, we will be righteous, we will bring judgment for all,
We are fighting for all thatâs right and all thatâs left to love

Oooh, project payback
Oooh, project payback
What you know of me is what you see of me
what you see of me is everlasting payback

Oooh, project payback
Oooh, project payback
What you know of me is what you see of me
what you see of me is everlasting payback
