Her mind is trapped as a bird in a golden cage in a neutral grey room
But while the others are content to hold their bars as shields, against my open asymmetry

She dives beneath the surface of what things are supposed to be, where thoughts avoid the rest.
Lay down the Earth, lay down the sky

Elishanth mistress of the wind
Ring the bell and the winter will be spring
Elishanth

Learned to expect the fall. No attempt to break the spell
Sad is the woman of the rings and I can cease her pain.

Ride on your silver horse to the deserts of the moon
Sing to the hunting wolves and fullfill your everlasting need for...

Pretend, that nothing can change and the next thing that you'll claim is that you did your best.
There is a voice heard only from the heart.
When she is ignored her cry is sadness.

Elishanth mistress of the wind
Ring the bell and the winter will be spring
Elishanth
