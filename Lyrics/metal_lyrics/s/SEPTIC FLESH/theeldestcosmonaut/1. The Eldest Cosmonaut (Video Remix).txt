The Eldest Cosmonaut
SHINE...
In the mines of the darkest star.
The one no jewel can never shine.
A rode is left to point to Styx,
both its end can lead,both can deceive.

No traps can seize,THE ELDEST COSMONAUT
as time stands still,incapable to breathe.

Once in clay I allowed the decades
to become a stone wall around me
but at least I became the wall of decades.

Can you feel the wrinkles on my hand?
They are yours.They are lines I once
drew upon the sand...

[CHORUS:]
I HAVE A BOAT UNSEEN A LABYRINTHINE SPHERE
THE GNOSIS OF THE ELDEST COSMONAUT.
AND MAYBE YOU WILL SEE
THAT I AM WHAT YOUR MIND CAN NEVER...SEAL.

Travelling the luminiferous waters of space,
through the Stellar Isthmus.
It can lead it can decieve.

No traps can seize me,No toombs can seal me.

[CHORUS:]
I HAVE A BOAT UNSEEN A LABYRINTHINE SPHERE
THE GNOSIS OF THE ELDEST COSMONAUT.
AND MAYBE YOU WILL SEE
THAT I AM WHAT YOUR MIND CAN NEVER...SEAL.
