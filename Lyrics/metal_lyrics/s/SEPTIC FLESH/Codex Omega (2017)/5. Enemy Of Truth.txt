"Every Superstate has one iron rule: logic is an enemy and the truth is a menace."
[âRod Serling]

The silent borderland
Where words become undone
Brainwave, treachery
A different truth to see
To keep a secret
Misinformation is the key
Twenty first century
New ways of slavery
So many prying eyes
Communication spies
Ghosts are fighting for the cause
With poisoned words
Half truths, false proofs
The trap is set to snare the wolf
The enemy of truth
Fight the enemy of truth
Fight the enemy of truth
Sense destroyer
Sense destroyer
Sense destroyer
Sense destroyer
Mental surgery
Social lobotomy
Confusion, delusion
We all connect and share
The perfect way for lies to spread
Fight the enemy of truth
Fight the enemy of truth
