Brahma/Vishnu/Shiva â Creator/Preserver/Destroyer.
Father/Son/Holy Ghost â Mind/Body/Spirit.
Past-Present-Future.

I am the abyss,
I am the way,
The secret door to a hidden cave.
A different place to the garden of fools.
You can enter here, if your steps will lead you toâ¦

Thoughts are sailing fast, like ships into a storm.
Dreams are fading; they are heading to a point of no return.

You can call me Trinity, as three divide the whole.
One third of me, is what you see.
A mirror is my astral door.

Trinity
Remember what you always have been.
Trinity
The one that is three.
Trinity
The one possessed by three.
