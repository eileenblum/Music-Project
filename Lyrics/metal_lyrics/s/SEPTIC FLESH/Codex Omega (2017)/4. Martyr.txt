"In memoriam of Hypatia, a great mathematician, philosopher and astronomer, murdered at 415 A.D. by order of Cyril the Bishop of Alexandria.
Cyril later was declared a saint by the churchâ¦"

Your books, your friends, your life is in mortal danger.
The things are tense and knowledge is offense.
In this nation vast deception reigns.
Church and politics threaten your survival.

A strife has grown between faith and wisdom.
You chose to stand for the exalted ego.
Your creation, a creation maimed.
Blame the vultures and their vile way.

The mob: "Run Devil's seed! You will face the wrath of God.
Run Devil's seed! You will face the wrath of God
Run Devil's seed!"

You will face the wrath of God.
The highest price you'll pay.
You will face the wrath of God.
The highest price you'll pay.

Martyr
Unyielding force of thought and spirit.
Martyr
Unyielding force of thought and spirit

Your essence remained.
Your work, your life, your books.

Unyielding force of thought and spirit, shine!
