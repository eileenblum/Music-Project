"Ph'nglui mglw'naph Cthlulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn"

Gothic walls below the sea.
Corals rising high.
A building is standing tall,
Fearful, yet majestic.

Surface dwellers never come,
Yet it haunts their dreams.
Tales about Atlantis come to mind.

When the waters kiss
The mouth of madness
And the sea is chanting,
Horrid fish come as guardians
For our church
Our church, belowâ¦

Hail! Cthulhu lives.
He escaped the abyss.
Hail! Cthulhu dreams
Of his house in the deep
Hail! Cthulhu lives.
He escaped the abyss.

Placed upon the ocean's floor,
On the abyssal zone.
Sunlight cannot get down here
And freezing currents flow.
Rusting chandeliers
Are hanging from above.
Chthonian priests
Are praying to elder gods.

When the waters kiss
The mouth of madness
And the sea is chanting,
Horrid fish come as guardians
For our church
Our church, below the sea.

Hail! Cthulhu lives.
He escaped the abyss.
Hail! Cthulhu dreams
Of his house in the deep.

When the waters kiss
The mouth of madness
And the sea is chanting,
Horrid fish come as guardians
For our church
Our church, below the sea.
