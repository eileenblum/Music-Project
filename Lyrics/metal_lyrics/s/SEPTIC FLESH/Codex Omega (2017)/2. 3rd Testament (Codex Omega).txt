[Book review by "Old Nick":]
"At last, the final volume in the mega popular "Testament" trilogy.
The concluding book "Codex Omega" is far better than the last book "New Testament".
Although it reads somewhat like a cross between the first and second book in the plot and overall feel, it is a very enjoyable read and a better conclusion that wraps everything up, with a surprising twist at the endâ¦"

A human has written all books.
A human mind has thought of the "proof".
To rule the earth, he had to ascend.
To rule his peers, their will he had to bend

Bibles are portraying a world in black and white.
We invented the devil, so the devil is man!

If Satan was the father and Antichrist the son,
Lilith was the mother and Lucifer the spirit of light.

Reversed is the 3rd Testament
The 3rd Testament
The 3rd Testament

A phantom god guarding your salvation.
He lives in books, your imagination
An abstract thought, lord of all creation
An absent king, the final revelation

If Satan was the father and Antichrist the son,
Lilith was the mother and Lucifer the spirit of light.

Codex Omegaâ¦
