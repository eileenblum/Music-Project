[Music: Chris A. Sotiris V.  Spiros A., Lyrics: Sotiris V.]

Can you pay the fair?
Open your mouth and spit the buried coin
The boat is ready to sail 
Step inside
I am the ferryman
We'll sail the river of woe 
The Dark River
Dark River
On its brink is the end of hope
The Dark River
Acheron

And a wind blew like the breath of a dying man
And the waters spawned sounds 
From the motion of slimy reptile tongues

My guests are many
And they won't leave this peaceful place of fading screams
Eyes shut 
Gaze mesmerized at the circular form of zero
They sailed the river of woe
The Dark River
Dark River
They found the end of hope
The Dark River
Dark River
They found the end of hope
The Dark River
Acheron

On tunnels underground 
chthonian delties mock 
the icons that turned blank
The shades of the once beautiful

Can you pay the fair?
Open your mouth and spit the buried coin
The boat is ready to sail 
Step inside
I am the ferryman
Acheron
Dark River
Acheron
