[Music: Sotiris V., Lyrics: Sotiris V.]

Desire manifests with endeavour
A form of spiritual eroticism
Magic is a goblet that seems hollow
A fountain strives to fill It to the brim

Magic loves infinity

A masquerade of visions so profoundly loved
Shroud the murky eyes of the sorcerers
Evoked from the vortex of their mind fields
As waves they spread in circles to reach the endless sea

Magic loves infinity
