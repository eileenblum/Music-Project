[Music: Sotiris V., Lyrics: Sotiris V.]

Silent but not alone
You are waiting for the dawn
To open the gates of the horizon
So that you can get through
The chasm that cuts in two
The worlds of now The worlds of ever

Casting your fiery arrows
A hunter among the stars
Up from your golden chariot
You throw the spear of time

Infernal sun

You act like a rightful tyrant
Casting away the cold
Your crown is the flame infernal
Eating the heat of soul

Infernal sun

Silent but not alone
You are waiting for the dawn
To open the gates of the horizon
So that you can get through
The chasm that cuts in two
The worlds of now The worlds of ever
