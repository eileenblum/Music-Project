[Music: Sotiris V., Lyrics: Sotiris V.]

Equinox is at hand
The gates are now aligned
Raise the candles in the air and give the secret sign
The temperature is dropping down
Our breath seems now like smoke
The guardians of the shadow lands blind the heathen eyes

Our mental variation: a phantom made from light
With red we paint our fantasy until it breathes with might
Deciphering the code that releases the unknown
We make the wanted possible
Material like the stone
Red code cult

Welcome to our church disciples of the jackal
Your nature is key
Now raise the veils of the misty tyranny of the fake laws
Open the Choronzone

Our mental variation: a phantom made from light
With red we paint our fantasy until it breathes with might
Deciphering the code that releases the unknown
We make the wanted possible
Material like the stone
Red code cult
