[Music: Spiros A., Lyrics: Sotiris V.]

A malfunction to the machine
She chews its screws of sanity
Losing parts of human seed
As she lusts for electricity

Plastic attitude gray emotions
Wear your cables and join with me
Boring lives in entropy
Incorporeal surgery

Environmental therapy for the genes that threat security
A new breed of mass murderers
Instructed from their parents to do the task

Mechanical our whore Babylon

The old hag looks so young in her dress of silicon
A jungle in her heart made from concrete, glass and metal

Mechanical our whore Babylon

Her kiss of methadone
Is a drug that steals control
She wants her clockwork toy
Disconnected from the physical

Plastic attitude gray emotions
Wear your cables and join with me
Boring lives in entropy
Incorporeal surgery

Mechanical our whore Babylon

The old hag looks so young in her dress of silicon
A jungle in her heart made from concrete, glass and metal

Mechanical our whore Babylon
