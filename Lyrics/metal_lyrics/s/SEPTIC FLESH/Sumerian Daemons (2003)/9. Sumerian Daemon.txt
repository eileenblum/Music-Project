[Music: Spiros A., Lyrics: Sotiris V.]

On the land between the rivers 
where lions fly and serpents rule
I cross the road to the ziggurat 
as darkness hides the moon
I came to seek the advice of Inanna
The goddess of love and war but the path is unclear 
like the words of a Seer from the movement of the dunes

Windy whisperers come
From beyond the clouds
Descend with glory to the plane earth
Gas shaped nauseous forms hide behind the storm
As scorpions blended with the yellow red sand

Before me are the steps that lead to virtual ascension
A mystical technology
The temple of dimensions
The mysteries of Sumer manifest inside the chamber 
that sits upon the top of this artificial mountain

Sumerian Daemon 

My veins are black from the blood of Tiamat
My eyes are wide like the wheels of space and time
My will is strong like a blow from Marduk's sword
I am no human now because I choose to know

Sumerian Daemon
