[Music: Sotiris V., Lyrics: Sotiris V.]

The watchers learned to fly 
and bridged the realms defined
The wealth was spreading far and wide
A sorcery divine

From the abode of heavens the seed of life was cast
Celestial orbs and fireballs from conflict fashioned lands
Nocturnal treasures glow and frozen crystals dance
The wealth was spreading far and wide
A sorcery divine

Fallen angels
They were called: the feared
The loved
The worshiped
They came to built the new empire
To make a land of promise

Protectors of the realms
These beacons in the sky
They warned about the cataclysm their sons that led mankind

Empire of the Watchers

From the abode of heavens the seed of life was cast
Celestial orbs and fireballs from conflict fashioned lands
Nocturnal treasures glow and frozen crystals dance
The wealth was spreading far and wide
A sorcery divine

The watchers learned to fly 
and bridged the realms defined
The wealth was spreading far and wide
A sorcery divine
