[Music: Spiros A., Lyrics: Sotiris V.]

Hate me
Help me
Convert my mind
Direct me to your gloom
The halls of kingdom
To the land of no return 
Take me ignorant
Show me your master and creator

Take me 
Take me to the tombs of your sacred relics
Where bodies bend like weak betrayers
What a fitting punisher you are
Bring your own redemption 
The touch of the nails to the skin is the fruit of your love for masochism

I don't deserve your trance
I am the adversary of a dominant race of zealots
I am the kind that doubts the unreason

Unbeliever

I won't forget to ask the question before I give an answer to me
On the land of no return there are all that you can't find: 
The lack of sense - The lack of anything that you can feel
I won't decide to play the master instead I chose to be
You say I am incomplete
I say I'll always be

Cover your mouth with tape
Cover your heart with pain
Cover your eyes with shame
Spend all your life in vain

I don't deserve your trance
I am the adversary of a dominant race of zealots
I am the kind that doubts the unreason

Hate me
Help me
Convert my mind
Direct me to your gloom
The halls of kingdom come
To the land of no return 
Take me ignorant
Show me your master and creator

I don't deserve your trance
I am the adversary of a dominant race of zealots
I am the kind that doubts the unreason

Unbeliever
