Creators...
Evoke your tragedy.
Betrayers!
You can't deny your lust for destruction.
Predators...
Dance once more waltz with the flesh of your prey.
Your sharpened teeth will sink in a passionate kiss...
There's no hope for redemption.
In every funeral, I have been
Your cemeteries so secrene, with gothic dark cathedrals.

I am the Destroyer of Life, I hear you chanting for me.

A Great Mass... of Death
A Great Mass of Death
A Great Mass of Silence
It's the quiet of absence.

A Great Mass of Death
A Great Mass of Silence
A concerto of sadness.

A Great Mass of Death
A Great Mass...

Run!

A Great Mass of Death
A Great Mass of Silence

I am the Destroyer of Life,
I hear you chanting for me...
