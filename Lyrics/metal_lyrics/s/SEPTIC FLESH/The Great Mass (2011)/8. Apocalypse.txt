[PSALM 8:]
A GOD THAT WANTS TO DIE

"Why is obtaining knowledge a reason for punishment?
Stupidity is definitely not an option for the truly powerful leader.
Who is leading who and to what end?
Why has revelation of truth (apocalypse) been connected
with the sense of great awe and great disaster?
Mankind desperately needs someone else to clean up
its mess and a scapegoat to blame for its own faults.
Is human a parasitic organism on the body of earth?
Is this the horrid truth that will be realised at the point of no return?
When a parasite sucks the lige of its host completely, it also dies.
Is man a suicidal god?
Will the paradise of Earth burn in flames?"

Bring us the end. + Harvest the crops of Men. + Horrid winds are blowing today. Hear them! + Its is the wrath of Cain. + Bringer of plagues and disease + Doom leads your hand + Writing the Apocalypse

A Gods that wants to die
A tragic kind of killer
Lunatic, fanatic
your self's greatest deceiver.

Sulphur rain. + You'll know the secrets of Hell. + Your leaders... revealed. + Shadows cover the naked kings. + Bringer of plagues and disease. + Doom leads your hand + Writing the Apocalypse

A Gods that wants to die
A tragic kind of killer
Lunatic, fanatic
your self's greatest deceiver.

GOD WANTS TO DIE!

You can turn Paradise into a wasteland. + It is your greatest design.
As tyrant, you demand nature's powers to obey.
From suicidal wrath no one will escape...
