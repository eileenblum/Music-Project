In a dream I saw a man
A face not strange to me
He stared at me while I was asleep and whispered in my ear
He led me through the corridors of my ancestral home
He stopped one step before one wall, and then I fainted

In the eldest wall of my home I found the entrance of a CRYPT
The view I saw was so obscure,
alien remnants, pentagrams and candles of the floor

The crypt was made as a passage to the gates of reality
And just when I realised the truth I was in a different shape

I hear thousands of sounds
like bestial laughs, deafening flutes and daemonic choirs
Possibilities fall under control, unfolding new dimensions
