Waiting the drawing of the underworld
None to share your fears
The shadow of Charon falls
Upon the stone of hopes
The body is paralysing
The air is too thick to enter
A cataclysm is spawned into the regions of the soul
The cry of the first time
When you were free from the womb,
Is the same but now you are entering the night

Most try to understand why they are born if they must die.
Life seems pointless with an end
They wonder if existence remains after death
Or Erebus is the final state

[Charon:]
"You knew from the beginning
That the end will come in time.
Yet, so many things you left undone
So many more unknown
In a life that is but a dream
Into a gods dream."

[Solo: Sotiris]
[Solo: Chris]

Most try to understand why they are born if they must die
Life seems pointless with an end

[Charon:]
"Existence is a choice that remains after death.
Erebus is my mental state."
