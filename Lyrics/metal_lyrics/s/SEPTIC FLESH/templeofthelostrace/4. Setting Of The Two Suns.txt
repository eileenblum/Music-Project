In a world of endless light, into the boundless space
Two suns the only gods, two burning holes in the sky

[Solo: Chris]

Without a warning the two suns slowly faded
Abandoning their only children unprotected from the cold

Down on their knees. They have total conscience
As night drains their spirit, the inner light of logic
Leaving the bodies to walk this blind planet
Stumbling to others that now are animals, crying light

Setting of the two suns

Then a light came from the horizon
Devouring the land
It wasn't sun!

[Solo: Sotiris]

It took a minute for a flame to become a fire
The great cities will all become ashes
Drifting with the wind
