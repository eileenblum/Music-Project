I was sailing in the sea of lethargy
Upon an empty dream
When land appeared
And filled the endless horizon.
White pillars from marble
Deep into a garden
Were shining like guiding stars.

The dreamlord.

A frozen voice from inside
Poured out in my dreamworld.

[The voice of Morpheus:]
"Taste the fruit of knowledge, drink the juice of wisdom, and you'll see what eyes can't see."

The dreamlord.

"You have reached Utopia."

[Solo: Chris]

In the garden of illusions
Encircled from the pillars
I found my idol,
But clouds filled the purple sky
And shed their crystal tears,
And the idol became muddy.

The dreamlord.

"The right explanation of symbols depends on you.
The sun will send me away."

[Solo: Sotiris]

In the place where the idol was, appeared a white flower.
