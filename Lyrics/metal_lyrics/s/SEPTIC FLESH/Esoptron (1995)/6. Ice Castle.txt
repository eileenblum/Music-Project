In the land that was born from
the sperm of winter is
the incarnation of all enchanted fairy tales
An imposing figure
Isolated from an ocean of frozen waves
Trying to unite the sterile earth
with the celestial dome

Like a crystalline bridge of ice
In the claws of four ancient mountains
Ice Castle
Transparent halls filled with
wonder worthless
for those who are sweeping along with
the purposeless flood of wasted feelings.

Priceless treasure
For the children of the serpent dream

In the claws of four ancient mountains
Ice Castle

There they claim life
in a feast with your nightmares
