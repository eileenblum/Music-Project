[music:SPIROS]

Black leather gloves
on soft thin hands.
Red Celtic knives,
sharp as your touch.

[CHORUS:]
HUNTING EAGLE PROUDLY LAND
ON THIS ISLAND THAT'S MY HEART.

Twin Mirrors blue.
Cold lakes consealing Fire.
Red coral hair.
A dazzling ruby dome

[CHORUS:]
HUNTING EAGLE PROUDLY LAND
ON THIS ISLAND THAT'S MY HEART.
ELEGANCE COMBINED WITH GRACE
DRESSED YOUR MARBLE SMILING FACE.

[SOLO:CHRIS]
