We play a game of cards with the nature of the paradox.
In a battle to determine what is possible and what is not.

One solution, for our delusions.

It is so hard to see beyond the small things that we believe.

The well of thoughts is never dry.
Just use a bucket and ideas will come out.

Bookshelves are full with works that have been proven wrong
Things that once were heresies have turned to be the rules.

One solution, for our delusions

It is so hard to see beyond the small things that we believe.

The well of thoughts is never dry, and we are so thirsty.

Science, everlasting science. A magical alliance of reason and
result.
