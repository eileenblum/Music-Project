You opened the portal of my secret favourite constellation.
Rest calm I will not trick you. I will treat you, like a demon in
a bottle.

Relax.

Chaostar

The reason I answered you is that I am looking for a reflection.
My mind is your crown now; there are things I want to share with
you.

Relax.

Chaostar

You opened your shelf, releasing an ethereal butterfly.
Your empty cocoon is trembling as you are wearing the night wings.

Relax.
Chaostar

Ecstatic from the nebular wonder that is hidden in the garden of
the night.
United we form the snake that is hanging on the tree of life.

The Chaostar
