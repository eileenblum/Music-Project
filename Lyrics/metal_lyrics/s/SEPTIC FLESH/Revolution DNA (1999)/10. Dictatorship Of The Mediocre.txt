You think you are so damn important, but you can easily be
replaced.
There are so many more like you.
You are the power of numbers, but it isn't in your hands.
Are you sure you can make a real change?

Small people in big houses,
there is one way to act,
there is one way to think.

Was it so easy, the termination of your ego for the sake of the
"right"
mentality of the maze? How is it to have no options, to be the
host of
parasites? Are you glad?

Small people in big houses,
there is one way to act,
there is one way to think.

Sometimes it's so fanny when you are trying to convince me for my
own good.
However, some times I must admit I really envy the ascetic life of
a dirty
strange old hermit.

Small people in big houses,
there is one way to act,
there is one way to think.
Dictatorship of the Mediocre.

I am not so eager to get sick from the popular symptoms of social
illness.
I am not so eager to be re-baptised to belong to the "powerful"
majority
of fools.

You want to help, to make me normal and right.

there is one way to act,
there is one way to think.

You wanted to help, to make me normal and right.
However, you can also use me as an example for your children.
A bad example for your children
