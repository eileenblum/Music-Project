We embrace pain
The value of suffering
The hooks sting, removing skin

The punishment of self
A task we learn to do so well
Pleasure leads to hell!

We are the Flagellants
Your faithful servants
Persecutors and martyrs
Victims of faith

"Salve Kyrie"
Your faithful servants are insane
"Salve Kyrie"
Sinners or Saints?
It's Dogma...

"Salve Kyrie"
Your faithful servants are insane
It's Dogma
"Salve Kyrie"
Your faithful servants are insane
It's Dogma
"Salve"
Sinners or Saints?
Dogma...
