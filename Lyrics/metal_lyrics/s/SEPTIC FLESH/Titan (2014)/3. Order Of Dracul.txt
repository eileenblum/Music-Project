In times of endless wars
The blood awakes the beast
The Voivode of Walachia
Will feast in Tirgoviste

The dragon had a son
A mad impaling prince
Known by the name of Vlad
Ruler with an iron fist

Defender or Tyrant?
Where chaos rules supreme.
Head of the order of Dracul

Defender or Tyrant?
Where chaos rules supreme.
Head of the order of Dracul

The forest of the impaled
Lined enemies as trees
Their corpses in decay
They dared to disobey

The dragon had a son
A mad impaling prince
Known by the name of Vlad

Defender or Tyrant?
Where chaos rules supreme.
