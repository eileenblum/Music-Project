Stand against our enemy
Fire
The blessing touch of your despair
Despair and loneliness
You'll rise up, before you fall again
Atrocious
The bird of prey is haunting us

"Deus"
Conquer your fears
"Deus ex machina"
"Deus"
Surpass your weaknesses
"Deus ex machina"
"Deus"
Withstand the fall and stand up again
"Deus ex machina"
Provoking, disturbing, resisting
Surviving the ordeal
As a father-head of all of us
Your flame will forge our hearts, even in oblivion!
"Deus"
"Deus ex machina"
Resurrection brings our hopes to life
And the lies and fears dissolve
We are strong

Guide us / "Deus"
Your fire in our hearts / "Deus ex machina"
Guide us / "Deus"
You are bringing fear to gods / "Deus ex machina"
Guide us / "Deus"
Your fire in our hearts / "Deus ex machina"
Guide us / "Deus"
The children of Prometheus / "Deus ex machina"
"Guide us"
"Deus ex machina"

Prometheus...
As a giant, standing tall
In a shadow close the blackness
Prometheus
As your breed, we are bound to fall
But our light will scare the darkness
