I took you in, I wanted to rest
I believed in nothing but you trusted in me
So very sad, you gave me your life
Maybe you were the one after all

Hate, I see it in your eyes
If you can't forgive me then who the hell can?
I know I keep my defence
'cause everyone's after me chasing me down again
Pain, it's pulling me in
Nothing to do but to lay down and scream some more

I took you in, I wanted to rest
I believed in nothing but you trusted in me
So very sad, you gave me your life
Maybe you were the one after all

You and your fragile little soul
What will it take to come through  to you so that you see?
Who I want to be
No one can take that away from me I used to rule
Now as I'm leaving this place
Nothing can stop me I'll take anything that I want

I'll forever be
My name will never die

Just keep my legacy
It was a good time

Once cheated, twice over, three times the charm
Don't pity yourself too much this time
You might end up dead and who would want that?
It's just that you weren't for me

I took you in, I wanted to rest
I believed in nothing but you trusted in me
So very sad, you gave me your life
Maybe you were the one after all

The one after all

Maybe you were the one after all
