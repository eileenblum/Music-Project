This, this is your life
Can you believe the things you have seen?
Don't let them know
Here, here is your anger
Deep down inside
Hold it forever, don't let it go

Mister, do you know your name?
Can you see my face?
The reason for you to stay here is 'cause all others left you

Stranger, do you confess to this?
The crimes presented here
The arrival of these many men means they're gonna test you

Tell me the reason we found you on the floor
Covered in blood and speaking in tongue

Wash off that smile and look me into the eyes
Give me a reason to let you go back
Tell me the reason we found you in here house
Covered in blood and speaking in tongue

Speaking in tongue
Speaking in tongue

Mister, behave and sell your soul
Forget about the price
You'll sell it anyway
Once they are through with you

Stranger, deep inside your mind
The secrets lie untold
They want to pull them out
But they cannot reach you

This, this is your life
Can you believe the things you have seen?
Don't let them know
Here, here is your anger
Deep down inside
Hold it forever, don't let it go

Mister, are you still inside?
Can they break the shell?
They only want to help
But they'll never reach you

Speak now or forever hold it
