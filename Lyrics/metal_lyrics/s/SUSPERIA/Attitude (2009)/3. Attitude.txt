I don't know what you want
So tell me how you want it done

I want you tonight

Don't you know the rules of playing?
I get to fell you whenever I want to

Face your weakness, take me in
I know you want to feel me
But only when you say

I can't take this anymore
So tell me what the hell to do

Wait, something must be done about your attitude
Theres far too man things you've overlooked
Your scared to look me straight into the eyes
Realize your living in a show

I want you tonight

Take me to that special place
And I will give you what you want

Wait, something must be done about your attitude
Theres far too man things you've overlooked
Your scared to look me straight into the eyes
Realize your living in a show

Wait, something must be done about your attitude
Theres far too man things you've overlooked
Your scared to look me straight into the eyes
Realize your living in a show
