Born with a face so dreaded by man
The everlasting shame of a hated boy
The never was, never be, the ultimate failure
Of all the things I hoped to be this is not it

Bron free, had no enemy
It's easy to believe in me
To trust me is all I ask of you
Don't waste your life watching over me

Is this all I'll ever be?
How will I be painted?
Read my face
Live my dreams

Stripped of my rights and no chance to speak
Deprived of the joy and a merry life
Tied down, shout out, left in darkness
Of all the things I tried to be this is not it

Set me free don't be my enemy
It's easy, just let me be
Forgive me and let me try to build
A world for myself where I can live

Is this all I'll ever be?
How will I be painted?
Read my face
Live my dreams

The beast within is coming out
On a day like this I lurk around
The smell of flesh and pleasure calls
And to them I'm just another one

I can't feel a thing 'cause I never tried or wanted to
With the hope of feeling something soon I'm left here with my lies

I'm going now, won't be back too soon
Incase you all were wondering
Forgive me and let me try to build
A world for myself where I can live

Is this all I'll ever be?
How will I be painted?
Read my face
Live my dreams
