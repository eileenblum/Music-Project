Welcome to your nightmare
Let me show you in
This is the place you never want to be

Can you see the writing, the writing on the wall?
That's your name spelled out in blood

Do you see what lies ahead?
There's an open path for you to walk
Can you see the light?
Do you dare to cross?
I cannot promise I can pull you back

Did you hear the voices?
Speaking from below
They tried to tell you not to go in

Now you have arrived
To where you'll never leave
Can this really be your true fate?

The elegy
The suffering

Here it comes, disintegrate
Never mind, it's all for you

You were given options
You chose badly
You'll never be
You'll never see
You'll never be
You'll never see

You could never be

From the dark it reaches out for you
To take you home and end your dream

The elegy
The suffering

Do you see what lies ahead?
There's an open path for you to walk
Can you see the light?
Do you dare to cross?
I cannot promise I can pull you back
