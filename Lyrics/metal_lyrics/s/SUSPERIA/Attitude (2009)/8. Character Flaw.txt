Many of us saw a face behind your flaw
But who could ever know you'd come back from this hell
Did you have to fight to tear down all your walls?
Or did you just run, never looking back

Tonight you must stand alone
Not driven by your own anymore
Now tell me, how does that feel?

Who are you today compared to who you were?
I cannot say, that you seem the same
Many of us knew this would end this way
For what you are today, inevitable I'd say

Tonight you must stand alone
Not driven by your own anymore
Now tell me, how does that feel?

Anyday now it'll all come right back to you
Are you really ready now to face us all once more?

Tonight you must stand alone
Now tell me, how does that feel?

Anyday now it'll all come right back to you
Are you really ready now to face us all once more?

Think again my friend, just let us move along
You can never say we didn't pave your way
Too late to start again, and all you bring is pain
When you had your chance you blew it all away
