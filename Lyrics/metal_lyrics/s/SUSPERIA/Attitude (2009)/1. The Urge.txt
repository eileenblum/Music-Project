Do you know what's eating me?
The rules we must obey
Can you feel the urge inside?
To do it all out way

Take another ride with me
And rid your mother from her tears

It comes it goes it pulls you in
You can't resist the feeling
Just a little more you say
And you drop to the floor
Come together, have another
Don't you dare to die on me today

Rage, all I feel is rage
I want to smash your face
For taking me to this place

Never think I'd leave you here
This is not your demise
Top the glass and pass the straw
This feels so goddamn nice

Take another ride with me
And rid your mother from her tears
Fight, fight for me don't stop
All I need is time
And I'll be back to join the fun
