Born with tragedy in your blood
Conceived by accident, no destination

Gimme just a second to change the rules
Gimme just a moment to turn it all around
Affiliation with the likes of others
makes my stomack turn
Closing in on my decision
to tear it down and let it burn
Gather up for mass destruction
In a way you've never seen

Who would have thought it was so easy
To look through your own eyes
and see the truth
Finding the answers may take some effort
But all it takes is situational awareness

Give yourself from time to time
A break from all the shit inside
Give yourself a moment free
From all that's said and done
Gather up to fight the system
That tries to rule with no control
Strong in numbers, side by side
We take control and pull the plug

Born with tragedy in your blood
Conceived by accident
Taking influence from no man
Maybe you should cause you're all alone

Who would have thought it was so easy
To look through your own eyes
and see the truth
Finding the answers may take some effort
But all it takes is situational awareness

Born with tragedy in your blood
Conceived by accident
Taking influence from no man
Maybe you should cause you're all alone

Is the way you see the world
just a creation of your imagination
Some kind of shit will hit the planetary fan

Who would have thought it was so easy
To look through your own eyes
and see the truth
Finding the answers may take some effort
But all it takes is situational awareness

If you don't watch your back,
you'll someday feel someone stabbing you in it

Gimme just a second to change the rules
Gimme just a moment to turn it all around
Affiliation with the likes of others
makes my stomack turn
Closing in on my decision
to tear it down and let it burn
Gather up for mass destruction
In a way you've never seen
