Hey, what are you looking for
Who do you think you are
I can't belive my eyes
Me, is it me you want

We are sent here to operate
on your body and your soul
And then they come
with their needles and their knives

Hey, what are you searching for
Who are you working for
I don't belong with you
Me, can't say you know the real me

Hey, who the hell are you
Say, can you feel my fist

We will do fine on our own
We'll give you a minute to run
DOn't turn your back on your own
We are alligned, you should run

Hey, could you choke someone else
Who, I don't really care
I have som unsaid words
Me, don't you look at me

Hey, who the hell are you
Say, can you feel my fist

We have come here to take control
of your person and your life
And in they come
with their promises and their lies

Don't you turn your back on your own
If you do so you should run
