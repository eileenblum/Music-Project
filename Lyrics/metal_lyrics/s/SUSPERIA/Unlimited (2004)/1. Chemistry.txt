Life as it is, is not enough
There is much to be done
And behold, twist of fate
Increasing hate

Hey mother chemistry
What have you got for me
I need a shot, a kick, a dirty flick
I'm on fire

True desire

I need to get high
I need to get low
I need the system
To let me go

Can't someone just tell me the truth
can't you hold on to me
If I were to come home all dressed up
would you then take me in or laugh at my face
Please forgive all I said
don't erase my legacy
I know for a fact that you wouldn't let me in
cause I'm just the unwanted son
Can't someone just pick me up
can't you clean my memory
I know that you cried the last time that you saw me
but I couldn't help it or feel you
