Eyes looking at me, through my own
Will we belong will we stand, in despair
Lost in seduction we run, on our own
Winning and losing life's games, isn't it nice

Pain starts with me
Take my hand come in and see
If you don't find what you look for inside
Don't you take it out on me

You know nothing at all

Pump up your system and let it stay high
You're gonna make it till the end of the day
Setting the standards and getting it right
You're gonna make it till the end of the day

Burnt by the cross inside
We're still alive
Turned by the gods you are
You weakly thing

Pain starts with me
Take my hand come in and see
If you don't find what you look for inside
Don't you take it out on me

Letting yourself fall into hands of cynics
that just want to mold you into a machine
let yourself go, there's no use of sticking around

Beast by design
Designed by the beast

Pump up your system and let it stay high
You're gonna make it till the end of the day
Setting the standars and getting it right
You're gonna make it till the end of the day

Burnt by the cross inside
You're still alive
Turned by the gods you are
You weakly thing

You know nothing at all
