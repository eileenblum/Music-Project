In the midst of the madness, all hope lost
Chances of achieving no longer an option
Suddenly it all comes together
What you've been expecting
and fearing the most is finally here
You didn't think it would forget you, did you

When you burnt your senses for real
Did you come to terms with yourself
You give a damn about reasons for failure

So prepare there are things around
to pull you down
Be aware your luck's about to
change my friend
Do belive from beneath you it devours you
You're ready now, closure of the mind

Devil may care
Oh, the load he must bare
Devil may care
Displacement of the mind

Devil may care, Oh the load he can't bare
Devil may care
Displacement of the mind

So prepare there are things around
to pull you down
Be aware life is on the way to breech
Do belive from beneath you it devours you
You're ready now, to take it all in

Devil may care
Oh, the load he must bare
Devil may care
Displacement of the mind

Devil may care
Oh, the load he can't bare
Devil may care
Displacement of the mind

How sad a man can be
Lifeblood scattered all around
and everywhere
A thousand years or more
could never heal you

The grinning mask cracks
and shows his fading face
You can take him out of hell
but you can't take hell out of him
MEaningless and hopeless
he breaks another bone
The masquerade concluded,
he no longer cares

You feel so hard
Screamed so loud
It drew you in
And the Devil didn't care

When you burnt your senses for real
Did you come to terms with yourself You gave a damn about reasons for 
failure
As long as things fell your way

Devil may care
