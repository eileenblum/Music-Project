I never went inside my mind to see
If there was anyone else in there but me
I have feeling that there's someone there
Sucking life, taking the best of me

Emotions running high
Guess I'm soon gonna die
I'm burning up inside
My minds will collide

I wonder why it took so long to see
That I was the one not meant to be
A ring of flames surrounds my life
The more I fight the stronger it burns

Posses me (What did I do)
Take me (Who are you)
Caress me (but don't make me)
Do the things (Again and again)
Others say (All that I hear)
Damn you for the things you do

See the young man walking
down the road all alone
See the old man crawling
the same road on his own

Half my life has gone, and you're still here
What does it take to be left in peace
I never asked for much, I never could
Every time you come and shut me down

Posses me (What did I do)
Take me (Who are you)
Caress me (but don't make me)
Do the things (Again and again)
Others say (All that I hear)
Damn you for the things you do

So tell me where you wanna go
And what the hell you wanna do
Falling dimensions everywhere
Hand in hand go good and evil

Emotions running high
Guess I'm soon gonna die
I'm burning up inside
My minds will collide

See the young man walking
down the road all alone
See the old man crawling
that same road on his own

So tell me where you wanna go
And what the hell you wanna do
Falling dimensions everywhere
Hand in hand go good and evil
