Do or die, is the best choise you have
Make or break, do you think it'll wait for you
Face the facts, take a shot at what you want
Make it work, it'll never come to you

Is this all, is there nothing left inside
Be without, if that's what suits you fine
Don't forsake, things that slip away
will not come back
Why do you fornicate

Expand your senses, break down fences
Don't listen to the lies
Divide and conquer, make a difference
Forlorn is not your name

Here we are in the prime of our lives
and you're just stuk inside yourself
We do it right, we pick our fights
But you wanna stay in home sweet hell

Expand your senses, break down fences
Don't listen to the lies
Divide and conquer, make a difference
Forlorn is not your name

Live or die, was the best choise you had
Make or break, did you think you it would wait for you
Face the facts, you never took a shot
Make it work, you didn't want it to come

Expand your senses, break down fences
Don't listen to the lies
Divide and conquer, make a difference
Forlorn is not your name

Here we are in the prime of our lives
and you're just stuk inside yourself
We do it right, we pick our fights
But you wanna stay in home sweet hell

Your own sweet hell

Doing it again, waking up in vain
Feeling all the pain, everything's insane
Entering the game, searching all the fame
I cannot belive, all I can't achieve

Home sweet hell
