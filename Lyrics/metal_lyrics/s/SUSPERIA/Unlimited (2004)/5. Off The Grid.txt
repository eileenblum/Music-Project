Over the top
You may belive that something's
coming after you
But it aint what it seems
Over the top
You run and think that someone's
gonna get you now
But there's no one there

Facing the wall
YOu are so scared
you don't know what to do now
And nothing will help you
Facing the wall
You scream so loud
but you can barley hear yourself
You bleed from your ears

This is the time you should realize
there is no such thing as a sane explanation
A few good friends and a table of fun
will get you through the night
No sleep for a decade or two
It dosen't seem to matter much
This is the time you should realize
there is no such thing as a second chance

Are you one of those people
that still belive the unicorn exists
You're officially off the grind

These are the times where you should open
your eyes, look into yourself
instead of looking out
a special craving pulls you in
and from that point you don't look back

Gambling with and testing life
must be the ultimate high, and there you go
These are the times where reality slips
and you fade away into a gloomy world

Enough is enough
You think you have the
power to consume it all
My friend  you haven'y
Enough is enough
You throw away the times
you think are coming back
Your days are numbered

Crack on the head
You said some things
you maybe should've left out
But that's all too late
Crack on the head
You end your life with owing what
you couldn't give
And so goes your story

Are you one of those people
that still belive the unicorn exists
Off the grind, I say have a good life
