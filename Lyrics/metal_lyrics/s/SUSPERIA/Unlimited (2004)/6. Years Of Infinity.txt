Have you come to deliver
a message from home
Or are you here to devour
what's left of me
have you come to deliver
a message from base
Or are you here to devour my secrecy

Taking guns away from men
During dawning of an unknown day
Fight hard for any cause,
fight for what your life is worth
And you shall see the enemy will fall

In the hills lying low
In protection of the mountains high
On the watch for anything that moves
Can never be sure what awaits beyond

I don't think I will need you, so tell me why
I don't think I will need you, so show me how

We're setting off to battle lines
Bring all the help that you can find

All this time and we still can't agree
We are so alone
On the run in every directrion
It's just you and me
Here I come with a gun yo mu head
What else to do
It's so cold in the years of infinity
I feel so alone

Have you come to deliver
a message from home
Or are you here to devour what's left of me

All this time and we still can't agree
We are so alone
On the run in every direction
It's just you and me
Here I come with a gun to my head
What else to do
It's so cold in the years of infinity
I feel so alone

Raging forth to take control
Of whatever's left to bring back home
In lack of moral self control,
eyes turning black
I take a life and give my own

I don't think I will need you, to take me home
I don't think I will need you, just leave me alone

Situation out of hand
In every way I die with pride
