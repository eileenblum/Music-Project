My time is near I will rule again
So what is your defence this time
You will try to defeat me once again
But your precious words will ricochet off of me
You`re going blind as I lurk around you
Your mighty being will fall down hard
Take a closer look at your built up horde
You wil lsee they are following me

When my time again comes
Order and darkness shall reign
Without the smoke of your holy pipe
We will again create clarity as a whole
Damn you for thinking your so supreme
I will end your vaingloryness

Step down from your throne it`s no longer yours
Give me your crown it`s rightfully mine
Take with you your poor possetions
For what I care burn them alive

And again I have to listen to your prayers
Take your supremacy anywhere but here
I nee some time to rebuild what you have destroyed
So do your wheaping elsewhere, not here

I will never forgive you my brother
For letting me rot in your pits of doom
This time it`s final my friend
Our bloodline ends now right here
