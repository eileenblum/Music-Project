One thought, needless to say
The action do repay
Someone out there filthyminded is digging up graves of the hated
To strike them again
Blow away the funeral dust

Souls forlorn
From darkness born
Diabolical seed
Of hate we breed

Never be at one with yourself
Cry out the pain
For feared was he
Utmost cause for not taking you
Hunted are we for reasons told
A story of disbelief was written

The run, the running of man
Come with me, run
Hated all these years
What a waste of time
Was I the one you really wanted

What do they want
The searching ones
Of hate they came
And in hate they die

So tell me what is your quest
Of times never spoken of
You tell a tale of rewarded times
In time you`ll learn the truth about me

Someone out there filthyminded is digging up graves of the hated
To strike them again
Blow away the funeral dust

Souls forlorn
From darkness born
Diabolical seed
Of hate we breed

For what am I if not as others
What am I if anything

[Music: Cyrus | Lyrics: Athera &amp; Gonde]
