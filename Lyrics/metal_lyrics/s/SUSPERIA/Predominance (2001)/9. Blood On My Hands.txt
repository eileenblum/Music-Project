This is your life
You`ll never wake up
It`s not a dream
Wellcome to the end of your destiny

Your last warning has reached you now
Oppose me again and I will hurt again
I don`t need to accept your mourning
Your face just disgust me

So take my hand
I wanna kill you now
Blood on my hands
My sister of the night I want to drink your blood
I need to feed of your life to keep from killing you

When I`m not there you dream of a saviour
That`ll come to set you free
This will never happen my love
As I keep you in another dimension

So take my hand
I wanna kill you now
Blood on my hands
My sister of the night I want to drink your blood
I need to feed of your life to keep from killing you

Do you know me... Do you know who I am
I speak with... Speak with the Devil at night
I trust him... Trust him in every word
He tells me... Tells me in which way to judge

You for your crimes to mankind
As weak as you are
I hate you for leaving me
I will see your blood on my hands
I do not forgive easily

When I`m not there you dream of a saviour
That`ll come to set you free
This will never happen my love
As I keep you in another dimension

Sister in life
What have you done
Enemy in death
I now let you go

[Music: Cyrus | Lyrics: Athera | October 2000]
