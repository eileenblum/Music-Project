An ancient evil centuries old has awakened in the form of the wicked
They use their beauty and their insatiable lust as a potent lifeforce
They become the objects of insane desire
But their kisses yield torture and violence as their suitors discover

Only I am strong enough to end their quest for total domain
And only I am strong enough to test them in a grand test of will
I was never more dangerous than with the night angels, mistresses of hell

[REPEAT]

[Music: Cyrus | Lyrics: Athera | April 2000]
