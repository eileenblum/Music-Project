The wind blows the falling leaves
As we wonder where do they blow
I stand on a hill gazing to the black skies
Wishing to follow the wind where it blows
To see what`s beyond
Beyond the color of night

I see a face in the horizon
I close my eyes and take the dive
Into unknown depths I fall

When I wake up it`s like I`m everywhere
I see everything, understand it all
I look around at so many souls
I feel the stench of the tears and the fright
Yet it fills me with power
And I grow stronger

I suddenly feel the need to take control
I am before you were
The hurting inside, in it am I

And still they come to my palace of doom
Mortal equals mourn
As their loved ones become my eternal slaves
Counting hours, servants in infinity
Breeding for one purpose
The pleasing of me

You can`t imagine what suffering you have coming if you refuse

Every season I expand
My vision, my creation, my domain
I have become the ruler of the afterlife
Challenge my being and you`ll eventually see
That the eyes watching you die, is me...

[Music: Cyrus | Lyrics: Athera | October 2000]
