From the dark pits of hell
Rises a new breed of warriors
Prepared after 2000 years of sleep
The last battle was lost and the book of lies was written

See now finally what you have created
Illusions of good was evil
After many times trying to find the door
You realize the key was destroyed

So majestically to watch
As they again invade this pathetic world
For this time to write the book of truth
Namely, the book of death

See now finally what you have created
Illusions of good was evil
After many times trying to find the door
You realize the key was destroyed

[*]
Illusions of evil
For time is mearly now
You die among us
Finally to gain wisdom
Illusions of evil
Time has met its master
Burn in hell
Salvation is never again to be found

[Repeat *]

For death is no place and no time
It`s unholy and it`s dark
When you die you fall, you do not rise to some height
This is the work of illusions

See now finally what you have created
Illusions of good was evil
After many times trying to find the door
You realize the key was destroyed

Damnation fills the room as the first of worshippers go
Leave no trace of glory
This was meant to be, behold the children crying
But the weak must og

See now finally what you have created
Illusions of good was in fact pure evil
