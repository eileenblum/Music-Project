Every given time is a gift
Use it well
Your sporadic venture (is due to loss)
Awakening pressure roams the surface
End of the line
It renders down to nothingness

Hymn to the sacred as far as it goes
Behold the coming
Of a darker time
Presence of evil
Endless life
Given the right to speak the truth

Elite of the trusted must bow
Down in the surface
Which opens and swallows
In dignity and in pride
Your lost
In eternitys quest for life

Hear the blessed souls lie
Watch the sickening souls die

[Music: Cyrus | Lyrics: Athera | November 1999]
