A vow to he who is the maker
The father of Candarian demons
The father of sins and sinners
Guardian of dense forests

And we as his children will obey every word
With chains around feet and hands

So long since I`ve seen the light
My eyes hurt
As they are stitched together
Tung cut out and fingers crushed

A vow to he who is the maker
The father of Candarian demons
The father of sins and sinners
Guardian of dense forests
And we as his children will obey every word
With chains around feet and hands
We slave on through the night

So long since I`ve seen the light 
My eyes hurt stitched together
Tung cut out and fingers crushed
Freedom is not an option
Escape you can but you`re always to be found
The light gives you away

Escape you can but you`re always to be found
The light gives you away

Some descend into darkness
Some will be forgotten
Your fate is sealed
Forever silent

[Music: Cyrus | Lyrics: Athera | October 1999]
