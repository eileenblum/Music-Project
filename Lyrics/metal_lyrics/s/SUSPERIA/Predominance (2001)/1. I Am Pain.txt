As for pain come to me
As for pleasure leave me
Legendary suffering you shall see
Is it not enough for you to see the torture
Must you still put your life on trial

So take a look at yourself lying cold and stiff
And then ask yourself is it worth worshipping some higher creator
When was the last time you bowed down to me and kissed my feet
Unless you forever obey me, I`ll put you to sleep

The fear of dying tears your mind apart
Hiding now from yourself
And so we walk into the night
Together to find excistence inside oblivion

As for pain come to me
As for pleasure leave me
Legendary suffering you shall see
Is it not enough for you to see the torture
Must you still put your life on trial

The fear of dying tears your mind apart
Hiding now from yourself
And so we walk into the night
Together to find excistence inside oblivion

So take a look at yourself lying cold and stiff
And then ask yourself is it worth worshipping some higher creator
When was the last time you bowed down to me and kissed my feet
Unless you forever obey me, I`ll put you to sleep
