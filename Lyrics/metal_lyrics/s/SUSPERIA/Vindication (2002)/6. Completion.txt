In a time where chaos rules the world
We should collect and not dismiss
We just destroy ourselves with the needs we have
Why can`t we all just wake up

Man`s craving for dominance
Is what will bring us to our doom
All other alien races consider man to be scum
They think of earth as a wasteland

Will we ever see
Will we ever know
Time will never end
But our being will

You`ll never find god
You`ll keep the dream
From start till end
Too hard to understand

Get your ass in second gear
Smell the roses they`re soon not there
The worst is yet to come
The universe will implode
Face the truth the end is near

Will we ever see
Will we ever know
Time will never end
But our being will

Before time the universe was not there
But a virus hatched, stability disturbed
Our whole system based on a coincidence
It`s soon over cause mankind came last

And God is a virus
