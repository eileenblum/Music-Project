As you reach for the gun and look into my eyes
As you enter the darkness and prepare to search your mind
Could I be more specific
I need you to open your eyes
This is not the way out
You`ll have to trust me I`ve been there myself

This is the time to recollect your life
Don`t ever rest your case
Just pick a different place
And seek the things you`ll never find
bleed yourself, it just doesn`t make sense
You should meet yourself halfway

If you try and fail you can at least be proud of that
Cause what you`ll find on the other side is not what you seek
Could I be more specific
I need you to hold onto life
But despite my advice you pull the trigger
and fall to the ground

Stop, where are you going
Gotta get you out of here now
This is the end
Gotta get you safely back home

Stay, don`t fade away
Gotta get you out of here now
Don`t you give in
Gotta get you safely back home

This was too close, hope you`ve learnt your lesson by now
I can`t always be there for you everytime you`re down
Could I be more specific
I need you to give me a break
And if not you will be
Just like history to me

This is the time to recollect your life
* Don`t ever rest your case
Just pick a different place
And seek the things you`ll never find
bleed yourself, it just doesn`t make sense
You should learn to meet yourself halfway
