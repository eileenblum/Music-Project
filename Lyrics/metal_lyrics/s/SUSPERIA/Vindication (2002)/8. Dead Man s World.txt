Take a good look at me
Tell me what do you see
Can you see me at all
I push, but you don`t seem to fall

I do not cast a shadow
I feel nothing, so hollow, why?

Still you refuse to find out what is wrong
Cause you sometimes feel that something lurks behind you

Your friends do not see you
Your child sheds another tear
But still you don`t understand
You`re in a dead mans world

Do you think they would walk through you
If you really were there
Don`t you think they would talk to you
If they could hear you screaming

Your friends do not talk about you
Your child can`t remember
No longer among the living
But you cling on to life

Do you think they would walk through you
If they could hear you screaming

Do what you have to do now, let it go
It`s time you step out of this dimension and go back to your own
It`s time to realize now, you`re in a dead mans world
