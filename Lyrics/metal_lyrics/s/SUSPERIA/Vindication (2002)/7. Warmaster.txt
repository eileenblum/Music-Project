You that walk in the night
You are afraid of the light
From a glorious, fearless knight
To a shadow of a man, beaten in a fight
Once granted the power of steel
The promise you made, never to kneal
Great warriors you slayed
Upon their crosses they prayed
With one stroke of your sword death they would feel

You that walk in the night
You are afraid of the light
From a glorious, fearless knight
To a shadow of a man, beaten in a fight
Once granted the power of steel
The promise you made, never to kneal

Enter the castle, reclaim your name
Open the door for him, beg for mercy
Recklesness shines through his eyes
Every bit of him cold as moonlight

By the end of the day you`ll all be dead
Doesn`t matter how much you adore him
He will still strike you hard
Whenever the master speak
The soil shakes, the beast awaits
The fields are his to claim again
Step down and worship the Warmaster

Great warriors you slayed
Upon their crosses they prayed
With one stroke of your sword death they would feel

And beg for forgiveness not
Your prayers makes it worse
As the coming of masters
Brings times and tales of chaos

Downfall, a play it is
Doomed are the blessed
Whichever path you choose
You will forever be posessed
A game of hazardous battles
And blood for reward
The ultimate weapon
Is back in the masters horde
Warmaster
