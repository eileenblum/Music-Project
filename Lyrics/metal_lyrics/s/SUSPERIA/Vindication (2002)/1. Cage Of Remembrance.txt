Inside your mind it dwells
the secrets of your past
Now you suffer inwardly, yet so silently
You fight the morning light
that shines in through the wall
Then it strikes you in the dark
There is no way out of here
You crane your neck, and twist your head
The voices call for you
As your skin starts to crawl

Now you sit here in the dark and the cold
You had it coming once you sold your soul
I`m here to make sure your sins aren`t forgiven
No absolution and salvation in sight
Bow down, open wide
Here I come

Pray, fall away, tribulation
Lay, everyday, agitation

Forget the trinity, deliverance denied
Your ass is mine until the day you die
I am the keeper, the punisher of bastards
Lick my boots and don`t you speak a word
Bow down, open wide
Your blood is fuel to my destruction machine
So believe you`re in the cage of remembrance

Pray, fall away, tribulation
Lay, everyday, agitation

Inside your mind it dwells
The secrets of your past
Now you suffer completely, and oh so cowardly
You fight the morning light
that shines in through the wall
Then it strikes you in the dusk
There is no way out of hell
You close your eyes and sense the end
The voices call your name
As your skin starts to crawl

Lay down and die
