Come along for the ride
Don`t waste anymore time of your life
Foolin` round with your endless shit
Going crazy, going blind
Is this the way you wanna live
Looking back at worthless times
With the future so vast
Thinking wrong, feeling fine

What was it your father once told you;
"Get your life in order son!
Or else things you do might come back to you times ten!"

The fire will not take you higher

Be brave, be strong
Where you stop is where I begin
Death will surely come
What you do in between is your thing
So get a fucking grip
If respect is what you want

The fire will not take you higher

I never needed no helping hand
So why should you, are you too weak?
Sit back and review your life
Was it really worth the effort?

And then the paranoia takes you
And it leads you to your grave
You can`t escape the death grip
Even though you try

Be brave, be strong
Where you stop is where I begin
Death will surely come
What you do in between is your thing
So get a fucking grip
If respect is what you want

And then the paranoia takes you
And it leads you to your grave
You can`t escape the death grip
Even though you try

I forgot to mention
I really don`t care if you make it
I can`t help you no more
So you`ll have to go your own ways
To reach your fire
You`ll have to choose the right path
