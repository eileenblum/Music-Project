Someday, somewhere
I`m gonna catch up with you
Someway, somehow
You`re going down

You may believe you`re gonna get away
But you can`t hide from me
I`m all around and I`ll find you
Don`t think you can run away
On the run you won`t get far
Turn your head I`m everywhere

Someday, somewhere
I`m gonna catch up with you
Someway, somehow
You`re going down

You know I`m out to get you
Your head for a price, ain`t it nice
I believe you said something wrong one day
Made your presence unwanted
And then became the hunted
What a fool

I`m all around and I`ll find you
Don`t think you can run away
On the run you won`t get far
Turn your head I`m everywhere

Of course I don`t care who you are
What you`ve done, what you`ve said
I don`t give a damn who you are
I take pride in my work
I`ve done this before

Your cry for mercy is noticed
And written down for reference
In this, the hour of your death
I`ve got no time to listen to your prayers
I`ve got a goal, to complete my work
I am the one, the bounty hunter of mankind

Someday, somewhere
I`m gonna catch up with you
Someway, somehow
You`re going down

I don`t give a damn who you are
I take pride in my work
I`ve done this for ages
You see, they call me the Bounty Hunter

Of course I don`t care who you are
What you`ve done, what you`ve said
I don`t give a damn who you are
I take pride in my work
I`ve done this for ages
