Will I ever find myself again
Will I ever feel your presence here again
Just as long as you let me try to heal
Could you show me what`s inside your mind

Is there something you should tell me now
Is there something you regret about me
As I tighten the grip around your throat
Please tell me what`s inside your mind

Did it ever occur to you that I really cared
I don`t think it did
You never gave a damn if I lived or died
So now you`ll pay

Do you think it`s funny to laugh at my face
I think you do
You thought you would never see me again
But here I am

Is there something you would like to tell me before you die
