Tension is what you look for
What you crave and what you live for, but couldn`t find
The power it will provide and give you
Is enough for a mortal man

Cast life into fire
This is the end my friend
There is no way turning back
Once you shoot up, then you give up
There is no need to come and cry

Do you see, the fading image of me
Can I believe, that your story is true
What do you want
There is nothing here, except a path and the end

Imagine a life without it
You could never have existed your own way
But since you chose this
Then know that the demons are for real

Cast life into fire
This is the end my friend
There is no way turning back
Once you shoot up, then you give up
There is no need to come and cry

Do you see, the fading image of me
It`s the last you will see
The answer to all your questions
Is right here beside you if you would open your eyes

With the morbid knowledge
That you threw your life away
Would you stand before a jury
And admit you`re a looser, a goddamn fool

What did you get out of your short tragic life
And the friends you left behind
Once you shut up, then you give up
There is no way back for you

Do you see, the fading image of me
Can I believe, that your story was true
What did you want
There was nothing here, except a path and the end
