As you roam deep within the twilight
What do you see
No lights fortold of and definitely no peace for you
Now this is your sad story I`m about to tell

Tolerance, forgiveness
Was a lacking ability in you
Intolerant, unequal
Your solution was always to run away

I thought I knew you
I thought I wanted to be you
And to think I almost became you
An ideological man such as you
Should be nothing but swept away for good

I never meant to fail you
I never meant to break you
But it happened
And I`m sorry I can`t change it

Do you believe me
Can you understand and forgive me
This was your destiny
And I`m sorry I can`t change it

I never wanted this
I never dreamed of this
For you there`s no return
And I`m sorry I can`t change it

Why couldn`t you just realize
That an act of justice would come and take you away
Unless improvement was displayed
And consequences of former misdoings accepted

I never meant to fail you
I never meant to break you
But it happened
And I`m sorry I can`t change it

Do you believe me
Can you understand and forgive me
This was your destiny
And I`m sorry I can`t change it

I never wanted this
I never dreamed of this
For you there`s no return
And I`m sorry I can`t change it

As you roam deep inside the twilight
And look back at me
What do you see
The bitter man
