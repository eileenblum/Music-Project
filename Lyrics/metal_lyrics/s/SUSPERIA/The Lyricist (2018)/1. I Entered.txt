Retribution in the night
Escalation. Non avoidance!
Taping knuckles for the fight.
Masses chanting. Satisfaction.

Sound of the hell.
Staredown.
Octagon hell.
I enter.

Sound of the hell.
Staredown.
Octagon hell.
I enter.

Striking, fighting for your life.
Face is swollen. Wrists are aching.
Dodge, step, punch. Just end this strife.
Victory is in the making.

Rise up!
Stop the counting!
Rise up!
Make him pay!

Rise up!
Stop the counting!
Rise up!
Make him pay!

Sound of the hell.
Staredown.
Octagon hell.
I enter.

Sound of the hell.
Staredown.
Octagon hell.
I enter.

Strength is fading. I can't fall.
Pain is only temporary.
Can't stand.
Knees are weakened.
Eyes close.
I cannot open them.
Jaws numb.
Something's broken.
I can't go on.

Help me!
Throw the towel.
Save me.
I'm being murdered.
I can't fall.
I've come too far to stop.
I can't go on.

Rise up!
Stop the counting!
Rise up!
Make him pay!

Rise up!
Stop the counting!
Rise up!
Make him pay!

Rise up!
Stop the counting!
Rise up!
Make him pay!

Rise up!
Stop the counting!
Rise up!
Make him pay!

Sound of the hell.
Staredown.
Octagon hell.
I enter.

Sound of the hell.
Staredown.
Octagon hell.
I enter.

I enter.
I enter.
