All my life I've had the same dream
Every time it ends the same
No one ever there to wake me up
Why can't I find my saviour?

It has been far too long for me to fear my inner self
Need someone here to tell me it's a dream
Cos it's starting to get to me

Scream, I wake up screaming
Shaking, laughing, crying out loud
Dead, I feel like waking from the dead
With one foot still in the grave

Don't wanna fall asleep
Can't stand this endless trip
Need you to help me out
Plead you to make it quick

It has been far too long for me to fear my inner self
I fell out on this lonely road
And I can't find my way back

I was once a strong man
Teaching, telling, making heady
All for nothing damn it
Can you tell me how it blew up?

It has been far too long for me to fear my inner self
Things will never be the same again
I've been deprived of life

Don't wanna fall asleep
Can't stand this endless trip
Need you to help me out
Plead you to make it quick
