Tonight we will go another way
Tomorrow there will be another day
Then I'm walking away

We're allowed to walk beneath
Tonight I'll show you what it's all about
So read between the lines

Four more lines and four more scars
Laughing out loud, ignoring the pain and the blood
Yesterday like ages ago
This never ending day gets harder to obey

Time is not on your side
Your crime was to not stay away
Now you're heading my way

We're allowed to walk beneath
Tonight I'll show you what it's all about
So read between the lines

It's burning now, it hits you hard
I told you why you should not have come
In my trail you'll only find you'll pay
Go easy now, try to control yourself

Now you feel what it is I feel
Tonight I'm sure you'll tell me everything
What lies between the lines?
