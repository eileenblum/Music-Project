Oh distant memory, where have you been and gone
As I turn back to see, you're still not there with me
I know you'll never come and I will live with that
But if you one day come, I'll no longer be the one

Wait in line this fight is mine
Trust my words it's not your time
Feel my rage to go run and hide
Hate yourself you have no pride

I said some time ago I'd be the first to leave
And when it all went wrong I had myself to blame

I can't take it when I need to take it
I an wanting everything I'm so alone
To wait for you is all that I can do
I need to be with you or die alone

What's alive and what is not
To be real comes down to how you feel

Now I paid for my mistakes again and again, too long to understand
But when that's said and done, I have myself to blame

Cos I can't see it when I want to see it
I am needing everything I'm so afraid
To seek the truth is all that I will do
To think you would stay and feel at home

Wait for me, just stop the time
Left to prove you have no pride

I can't watch all this, I hate to know the truth
So tell me finally what do you want?
To dream of you is all that I can do
Something you'd never do in all your time

I can't take it when I need to take it
I am searching everywhere, I'm so alone
To wait for you is all that I can do
I need to be with you or die alone
