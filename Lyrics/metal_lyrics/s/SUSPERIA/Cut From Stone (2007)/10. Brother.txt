They said you knew how to kill and how to maim
They lied, you tried, bend the truth, they won't allow mistakes

You're alive and doing good
Just as long as you can hunt
You will be like this forever
You're never coming home

They said you would get the best of everything
They lied, you tried, every day they laughed at you
Death, my brother, I told him never to go there
Remorse, my bother, they had him taken on his way to war

War- he's taken ill
War- and then some more
War- it's everyday
War- it's everywhere

Still alive and feeling well, wont you come and join us
We will be here for a while, our time is all we've got

We're alive and feeling well, do we wanna change this
What the hell is going on, do we deserve the pain

So they said you will defend your country in every way
But they lied, and they tried to hold you into their pride

Hate, my brother its waiting for a no good cause
Belive, my brother, one day you will come back home from war

War- he still exists
War- he's nothing more
War- he's had enough
War- can take no more

We're alive and feeling well, do we wanna change this
What the hell is going on, do we deserve the pain

Dead, my brother, I told him never to go there
Sorrow, they took him away, please make me understand
