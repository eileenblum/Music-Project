Shot for the very first time
Cos I didn't know what to say
Been alone in this alley before
But I never thought it could go wrong
Tonight it was the final night
And they were gonna set me free
Sure as hell they let me go
And now it's all up to me

Get up on your feet
Time to run away
In my dreams I always found my way
Waiting for the night
To come and take me home

Suffer the consequences
Do what the hell you want
I'm gonna leave it be
And seek higher powers
Love it or leave it though
I'm gonna go below
Letting you run the show
Leave me the fuck alone

Bleed, I will make your life
Into the hell that you made mine
Need no eyes to see your smile
As I show up and stand alone
The night is soon to come again
And this will be your final one
Ticking bomb, that's what I am
Just come and let me show you in

Get up on your knees
Time to run away
In yours dreams
You will get away
Waiting for the night
To come and take you home

Suffer the consequences
Say what the hell you want
I'm gonna leave you to it
Seek higher powers
I will now take you below
And I will do it slow
This is the final one
Lackluster day
