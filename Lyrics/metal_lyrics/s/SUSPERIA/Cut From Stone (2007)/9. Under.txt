Now look where you are
Back on this road again
Still running from your past
Bound to catch up with you someday

Cos I saw you
What you did I had to tell them
And I mean it
I refuse to lie I thought that you knew

Tell it now or don't tell at all
What's it gonna be
Waiting in line to be executed
What's your final word my friend
Do you know, I don't know
Who you're meant to be
Do them a favour, tell you friends goodbye
this is how I'm gonna put your under

So sad to look at you
I miss the time we had together
No wonder they all turned
The way you are, the things you do

When they knew you
What you did it nearly killed them
And I mean this
I cannot change this, only watch you

Tell it now or don't tell at all
What's it gonna be
Waiting in line to be executed
What's your final word my friend
Do you know, I don't know
Who you're meant to be
Do them a favour, tell you friends goodbye
this is how I'm gonna put your under

Been down this road before
Never knew which way to go
Do it now or don't ever do it
Change this mess this is getting crazy

Are you sorry?
I never thought that you would care

Tell it now or don't tell at all
What's it gonna be
Waiting in line to be executed
What's your final word my friend
Do you know, I don't know
Who you're meant to be
Do them a favour, tell you friends goodbye
this is how I'm gonna put your under
