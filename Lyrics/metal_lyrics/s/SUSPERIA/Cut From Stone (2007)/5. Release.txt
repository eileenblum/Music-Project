I fear the sounds at night
Going through my mind
Cold shivers down my spine
Did I leave her to die?

I have a thing or two to tell you
About the things you did
Now I'm finally back to myself
I can hardly behave
Cos I'm left cold

This is me releasing all
I can't protect you when you fall

Fear, the flames are getting higher
Can you face me alone&gt;
Know; know now how you made me
Just to tear me apart

Fool, anger fills me over
I'd like to say it was me
Turn around and let me help you
Now this is all I can say
Cos I'm left cold

This is me releasing all
I can't protect you when you fall

This is me releasing all
I can't protect you when you fall
Leave me be and stay away
For I am next, please let me go
