I am alone in all of this
Why can't you be like them?
Now show me the entity
Just like you used to do
Put on your sad disgrace
This will be left to me
These hands will never touch
Another one of your kind again

No, never again

Peace or pestilence, which will it be my dear
End of the reverence, this is your final grave

I, the lonely, lonely, cut from stone
Will I be evermore?

I can't believe I'm hearing this
That I should be like them
Please take this burden off of me
Just like you used to do
Put on your saddest face
This a game to me
These eyes can never face
Another one of your kind again

Leave or consolidate, this choice I give to you
Watch me obliterate, this was my final shame

Again, no never again
