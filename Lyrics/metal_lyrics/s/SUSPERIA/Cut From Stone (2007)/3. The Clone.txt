Born, the challenge is to stay
As long as we can and pay
The price for every mistake
We make and we take and we break
When everything falls down
We're stuck in the system like fools
The burden we beat is the lie
We carry till we die

We take what we can find
Once yours, now mine
We crave what we can't fine
Don't waste my time

Make me into what you fake
I'd love to join your hate
For the reasons that I will state
When I crush all the things they create
Do you believe in me?
And all the things I change
This is your final call
To join us build a wall

We're lost but not alone
We carry each our clone
Keep close what you hold dear
It all will disappear

Torn, the reason is unknown
We cling to the better half
Without knowing just what that is
We dream and we hope and we fail
And everything is wrong
From the moment you open your eyes
You're stripped down and given a fate
You carry till you die

We're lost but not alone
We carry each our clone
Keep close what you hold dear
It all will disappear

I wanna join your hate
So make me into something else
We're locked into something we hate
The moment you try to escape
You'll learn that you have been replaced
Do you believe in me?
And all the things I'll change
This is your final call
To join us build a wall

We're lost but not alone
We carry each our clone
Keep close what you hold dear
It all will disappear

We're lost but not alone
We carry each our clone
Keep close what you hold dear
It all will disappear
