There was a time you wouldn't just walk away
That's long past now
There was a time you told me to stay
Been long since I heard you say
I need you to stay
Don't walk away

These times are lost but remembered
They went away with the wind
In fact I needed them to go
To stay alive and be sane
The more I think of the future
The past remains in my life
the lies, the fight that we had
Was bound to come anyway

It's been awhile since you and I shared a word
I wonder why
There was a time you could look in my eyes
I didn't need to beg you just to stay
I need you to say
Don't walk away

These times are lost but remembered
They went away with the wind
In fact I needed them to go
To stay alive and be sane
The more I think of the future
The past remains in my life
the lies, the fight that we had
Was bound to come anyway

These times are lost but remembered
They went away with the wind
In fact I needed them to go
To stay alive and be sane
The more I think of the future
The past remains in my life
the lies, the fight that we had
Was bound to come anyway
