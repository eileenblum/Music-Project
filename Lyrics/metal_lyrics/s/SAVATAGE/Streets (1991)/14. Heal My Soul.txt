I've been waiting
Long forgotten
Shipwrecked on
A distant shore
Am I drifting
No more wanted
Floating outward
Evermore

All the dreams
That I've harbored
In the labyrinths
Of my soul

Gone forever
Not discarded
Only sleeping
Till they're whole

In the graveyard
Of my heart now
Sleep the years
That I've long sold

For their markers
Is there nothing
Only ghost
I can not hold

Father hear me
I am tired
Shall I waken
In thy home

Hold me closer
I am trying
Sweet Lord Jesus
Heal my soul
