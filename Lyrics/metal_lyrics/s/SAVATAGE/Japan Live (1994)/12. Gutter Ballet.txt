[Written by Jon Oliva, Criss Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

Another sleepless night
A concrete paradise
Sirens screaming in the heat
Neon cuts the eye
As the jester sighs
At the world beneath his feet

It's a gutter ballet
Just a menagerie
Still the orchestra plays
On a dark and lonely night
To a distant fading light

Balanced on their knives
Little parts of lives
Such a strange reality
Kill the unicorn
Just to have its horn
Soon he's just a fantasy

It's a gutter ballet
Just a menagerie
Still the orchestra plays
On a dark and lonely night
To a distant fading light

The jester takes his bows
Slips into the crowd
As the actors fade away
Another death to mourn
Another child is born
Another chapter in the play

It's a gutter ballet
Just a menagerie
Still the orchestra plays
On a dark and lonely night
To a distant fading light

Good night Tokyo and see you later
Good night

Gutter Ballet was sang by Jon Oliva and Zak Stevens together
