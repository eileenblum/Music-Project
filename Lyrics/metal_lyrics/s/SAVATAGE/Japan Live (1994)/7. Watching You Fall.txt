[Written by Jon Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

There in the dark
There's a child and she's waiting
Lost in the maze of a fate accompli
Is it a crime to be just hesitating
While we're pretending that we never see

On a TV mounted on the wall
From this distance I can see it all
And I've been out here watching you
Watching you fall

Is there a trick to the art of not feeling
Safe in our world while another's child bleeds
Praying that God won't demand a redealing
Of cards we have held and pretend you don't need
Don't need

On a TV mounted on the wall
From this distance
I can see it all
And I've been out here
Watching you
Watching you fall

Better not think about it
Anytime we'll start to doubt it
Christ has risen
Keep him hidden
God forbid he sees

It's not that we lack the vision
Only just a quick decision
Who will blame us, rules restrain us
It's all in history

So close my eyes and pretend I am sleeping
Avoiding the chance that you'll visit my dreams

On a TV mounted on the wall
From this distance I can see it all
And I've been out here
Watching you
Watching you, watching you, watching you
Watching you fall yeah yeah
