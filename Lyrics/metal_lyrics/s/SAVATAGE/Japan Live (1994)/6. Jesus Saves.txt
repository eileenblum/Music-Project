[Written by Jon Oliva, Criss Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

Jesus was a talker
Just an out-of-place New Yorker
He hung out on the boulevard
He was sellin' nickel candies
He was saving up all his quarters
Bought himself a cheap guitar
Started playin' bars
Kids came in their cars
Hear them shouting at the stage

Jesus saves
Jesus saves
Yes he does
Jesus saves

You know
Jesus he started changin'
Things got really strange
He saw his tee shirts everywhere
He started missing shows
The band came down to blows
But Jesus he just didn't care

Things got out of hand
And so he quit the band
Still the critics they would rave

Jesus saves
Jesus saves
Yes he does
Jesus saves

So the dice were cast
Today become the past
Jesus just disappeared
He was headed for New York
Or so his little label thought
And there he gave away the years

Last seen drinking wine
Beneath a flashing sign
Promising salvation to strays

Jesus saves
Jesus saves
Yes he does
Jesus saves
Hear him cut through the night
On those late night radio waves
Jesus saves
Yes he does
Jesus saves
