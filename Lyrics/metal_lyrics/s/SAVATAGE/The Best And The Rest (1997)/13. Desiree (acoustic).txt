Desiree
Listen to your heart
Have the dreams all been scattered
Are all the words just parts
'Cause in these ruins alone
I've been watching you
A ghost among these stones
Desiree I've got to tell you

What good's a tear without a face
To soften its downward fall from grace
And across my heart
Desiree I wish you'd see
Scars are the wounds that we all show
Time only heals if you let go
If you're letting go
Desiree I wish you'd think of...

If you only take chances
When every angle's safe
Have partnerless dances
In castles where you wait

But I see far away
A distance in your eyes
As you go on alone
Piling up your alibis

What good's a tear without a face
To soften its downward fall from grace
And across my heart
Desiree I wish you'd see
Scars are the wounds that we must show
Time only heals if you let go
If you're letting go
Desiree I wish you'd think of...

Lost in a movie script
With no words left to say
You leave on that plane alone
And there inside a midnight fog
I turn and walk away

What good's a tear that falls from grace
What good's a life that leaves no trace
When its time is done
Desiree I wish you'd see

Who needs a heart that never bleeds
Never retreats and never needs
If it's all alone
Desiree I wish you'd think of me
