Listen to me
From deep down inside
I'm the madness that just
Will not die
With no regrets
Of what I'll do to you

Before the night is over
You'll be crawling to me

Call me when you're weak
For me you'll lie and cheat
You'll never get away
With me you're here to stay

Listen D.T. can't you see
Stay with me and you'll be free
Even as I soothe your soul
I tear you down and make you old
You just keep on coming back
To buy another nickel sack
Twelve o'clock time to greet
Agony and ecstasy
Ecstasy

I'm the cry from within
From when your day begins
You'll follow me like sheep
This shepherd never sleeps

So tell me what's your price
Came skate on my ice
My blades they never rust
I'm asking you to trust

Listen now the time is right
And what a way to start the night
Spend your money endlessly
Another grand insanity
So D.T. here is the plan
I'll make your brain a rubber band
Time to stretch it out and see
Agony and Ecstasy
Ecstasy
Ecstasy
Ecstasy
Ecstasy

Feel my whisper through your haze of pain
Hear the calling of a neon vein
See myname upon your soul's marquee
I am agony and ecstasy

And just remember
If you ever need me
I'm here
