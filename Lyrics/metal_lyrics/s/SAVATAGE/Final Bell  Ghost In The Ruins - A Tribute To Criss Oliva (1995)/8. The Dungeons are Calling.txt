Down in the dungeons
Of concrete and terror
Candles light the way
Can you hear me say?
The dungeons are calling
The dungeons are calling for me

I can't escape
This den must be hell
Pleasures of freedom
Denied me in this cell
I steal from my friends
Victims of my pain
Its nearing the end
I live like the dead

The dungeons are calling
Calling for me--oh!
The dungeons are calling
The rack waits for me

Down in the dungeons
I'm locked away
Suicide ride
I take everday
Prisoner in hell
Victim in pain
The dungeons are calling for me

None of my friends
Want to come out and play
They think I'm crazy
But what can i say?
Prisoner in hell
Victim in pain
It's nearing the end
I live like the dead

The dungeons are calling
Calling for me
The dungeons are calling
The rack waits for me
