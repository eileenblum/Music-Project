[Taken from Japan Live '94]

[Music &amp; Words: Jon Oliva, Criss Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

An offering of reasons
We put them all in play
A covering of treasons
That one by one we let slip away

A solitary dancer
So lost upon her stage

I have seen you on the edge of dawn
Felt you there before you were born
Balanced your dreams upon the edge of thorns
But I don't think about you anymore

A study made from winter
Of summers long ago
And dreams that used to glitter
Safely now hidden under snow

And so we end the chapter
And let the stage lights fade

I have seen you on the edge of dawn
Felt you there before you were born
Balanced your dreams upon the edge of thorns
But I don't think about you anymore

I have seen you on the edge of dawn
Felt you there before you were born
Balanced your dreams upon the edge of thorns
But I don't think about you anymore
Anymore
I don't think about you anymore
Anymore
I don't think about you
I don't think about you
I don't think about you
Anymore, anymore, anymore
