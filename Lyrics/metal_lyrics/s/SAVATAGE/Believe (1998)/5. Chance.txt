[Taken from Handful of Rain]

[Music &amp; Words: Jon Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

He was standing all alone
Trying to find the words to say
When every prayer he ever prayed
Was gone
And the dreams he's never owned
Are still safely tucked away
Until tomorrow he just
Carries on
Carries on
Carries on

See the Devil in the streets at night
See him running in the pouring rain
See him grinning 'neath a twisted light
I'll be back again
See the people standing in a row
See them nodding like a field of grain
No one sees the sickle though
Coming 'cross the plain

And this he knows if nothing more
That waiting in the dark like destiny
Are those who kissed the dogs of war
And there is no tomorrow
No tomorrow
Take a chance
Take a, take a chance, yeah

See the Devil he is so intense
See the Devil go and change his name
What's the going price of innocence
It can't be the same
Is it dark when the moon is down
Is it dark with a single flame
If there's glass falling all all around
I am not to blame
And this he knows if nothing more

That waiting in the dark like destiny
Are those who kissed the dogs of war
And there is no tomorrow
No tomorrow
Take a chance
Take a, take a chance, yeah
Take a chance
Take a, take a chance, yeah

Burn the night away
Burn the night away
Burn the night...

Pictures at an exhibition
Played as he stood his trance
Staring at his inhibitions
All the time believing
That it now came down to nothing but this chance
Chance
Chance
Chance

I fear you
Your silence
Your blindless
See what you want to see
In darkness
One kindness
One moment
Tell me what you believe

I believe in nothing
Never really had to
In regards to your life
Rumors that are not true
Who's defending evil
Surely never I
Who would be the witness
Should you chance to die

Father can you hear me
This is not how was meant to be
I am safe and so are you
As for the others destiny

[simultaneously - add a new stanza each time]

Father can you hear me
This is not how was meant to be
I am safe and so are you
As for the others destiny

[simultaneously - add a new stanza each second time]

I believe that situations
All depend on circumstance

Look away
Look away
Look away
Look away

Played as he stood in his trance
Staring at his inhibitions
All the time believing
That it now came down to
Nothing but this...

[All together]
Chance
Chance
Chance...
