[Taken from Handful of Rain]

[Music &amp; Words: Jon Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

You were never one for waiting
Still I always thought you'd wait for me
Have you from your dream awakened
And from where you are what do you see

Which of us is now in exile
Which in need of amnesty
Are you now but an illusion
In my mind alone you breathe

You believed in things that I will never know
You were out there drowning but it never showed
Till inside a rain swept night you just let go

You're thrown it all away
And now we'll never see
The ending of the play
The grand design
The final line
And what was meant to be

In the dark a distant runner
Now has disappeared into the night
Leaving us to stand and wonder
Staring from this end into your life

You believed in things that I will never know
You were out there drowning but it never showed
Till inside a rain swept night you just let go

You've thrown it all away
And now we'll never see
The ending of the play
The grand design
The final line
And what was meant to be

And if this is all illusion
Nothing more than pure delusion
Clinging to a fading fantasy

Like Icarus who heeds the calling
Of a sun but now is falling
As the feathers of his life fall free
Can you see
See

Tomorrow
And after
You tell me what am I to do
I stand here
Believing
That in the dark
There is a clue

Perhaps inside
This midnight sky
Perhaps tomorrow's new born eyes
Or then again
We'll never know
And after all
This was the show

What am I to do
Gotta get back
Gotta get back
Gotta get back

What am I to do
Gotta get back
Gotta get back
Gotta get back

What am I to do

Standing on a dream
Isn't what it seems
Could we then reclaim a dream refused
Knowing what we know
Could we let it go
Realizing that all the years are used

Tomorrow and after
You tell me what am I to do
I stand here believing
That in the dark there is a clue
I am the way
I am the light
I am the dark inside the night
I hear your hopes
I feel your dreams
And in the dark I hear your screams

Tomorrow and after
You tell me what am I to do
I stand here believing
That in the dark there is a clue

BELIEVE is a Japanese compilation spotlighting the four Savatage albums that
have been released in that Japan on the Zero label. The album is intended to
keep Savatage material on display in Japanese music stores. BELIEVE is a
selection of tracks that the band feels showcase key turning points for the
band during the 1990's. The extensive liner notes include a well written
track by track description and band history by Clay Marshall.

No previously unreleased tracks were released on this album.

Though technically the song "Believe" was never released on Zero, but what
would any Savatage compilation be without the song? Not Complete. So proper
dues were paid and it became the title track.

THE BEST AND THE REST was a compilation with tracks largely selected by a
fan vote. BELIEVE is more of what the band thinks is its best work, and the
purpose of this compilation is to showcase key turning points for the band
during the 1990's.

The album has an extensive Savatage biography and detailed liner notes,
including background information behind every song represented here. They
were written by Clay Marshall, and appear inside the album in both English
and Japanese.
