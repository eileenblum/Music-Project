Somewhere in this universe of lost forgotten dreams
The silence weaves a tapestry of once enchanted themes
The shadows listen carefully and question what it means

For stories have lives of their own
But what good's a story whose end is unknown

Stay with me
For the little night that's left to be
For a moment in a memory
That time cannot defile
Stay with me
Where the night still offers amnesty
And the ending is tomorrow's unborn child
And stay with me awhile

The darkness covers everything and carefully watches all
It hides behind the storm's lightning and cushions every fall
And everything it witnesses it always can recall

Like things that the heart can regret
Bury in time and then try to forget

Stay with me
For the little night that's left to be
For a moment in a memory
That time cannot defile
Stay with me
While the night still offers amnesty
And the ending is still yet to be tomorrow's unborn child
And stay with me awhile
