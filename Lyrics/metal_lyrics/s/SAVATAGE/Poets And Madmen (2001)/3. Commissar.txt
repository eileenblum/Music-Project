Do you see commissar
The night is darker
Do you think commissar
Their dreams are starker
Do you hear commissar
The night is breathing
Could it be commissar
We should be leaving
Now before the curtain
Does comes crashing down

Do you hear commissar
The night is silent
Do you think commissar
It is defiance
Do you see commissar
The mob has faces
Could it be commissar
The dark embraces
All as darkness will
And in that dark we'll drown

Cities, towns
We've torn them down
And all we've found
Are relics in a cemetery

But never fear
I will stay near
And to the dark
I will be your emissary

Knights on horseback
Bishops pacing
All are losing ground

The pawn is now a queen
He's moved across the board unseen
The move is down

I believe
That we've intrigued for far too long
But now I think the plot has ended

A quick retreat
Into the street
Admit defeat
And hope our moves will be defended

Across their throats
The blade does wander
They die without a sound

Who'd have thought we'd meet
As bones beneath the dragons feet
The wall is down
