As the steam from the street starts to rise
The gutter whispers
That the moon like a child has arrived
The dark has missed her

And the light that she lends is a guide
Among her shadows
Like the ghost from the past that survive

And you ask me now
What is my intent
Here among the ruins
Cloaked in false pretence
And how do I belong

I seek power
Where the power remains
I seek power
In the back of your brain

How will you see me
If you don't know where I hide
How will you bleed me
If I am somewhere inside

In the ashes of empires lost
A distant warning
On the danger of ignoring cost
And children mourning
As the memories cloud in our mind
The past can glitter
And so it has been designed

I know every lie
That the mind invents
Though they're well disguised
And cloaked in innocence
And how do I belong

I seek power
Where the power remains
I seek power
Like the kiss of cocaine
I seek power
As the darkness descends
I seek power
And I'll have it again

I seek power
Where the power remains
I seek power
Like the kiss of cocaine
I seek power
When it's not always wise
I seek power
For the power survives
