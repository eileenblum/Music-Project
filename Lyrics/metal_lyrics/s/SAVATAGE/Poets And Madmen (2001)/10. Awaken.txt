Can you see the future
Though it's well disguised
Is the end so certain
That you've closed your eyes

Dark as the dark can be
Beckons eternity
Exits exist in life
As they do on this night

Now's not the time to sleep
There are still nights to keep
Chances are there to take
Now it is time to

Awaken
Awaken
Awaken
Awaken

Do you fear the future
Do you fear the night
Do you fear the morning's
Unforgiving light

Agony ecstasy
There is no certainty
Exits exist in life
As they do in this night

Now's not the time to sleep
There are still nights to keep
Chances are there to take
Now it is time to

Awaken
