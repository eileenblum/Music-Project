Here on this night
Behind walls made of stone
Where no one can enter and
The dark dreams alone

But now someone's entered
The walls are defied
The shadows they watched
While the dark sympathized

But there in the silence
There in the silence
There in the silence

Something hides
Something lies
Something dies

Something breathes

The mind can imagine
The dark can deceive
And here on this night
Together they weave

A shadow's repentance
A forgotten life
All brought together
In the mercy of night

But there in the silence
There in the silence
There in the silence

Something hides
Something lies
Something dies

Something breathes
