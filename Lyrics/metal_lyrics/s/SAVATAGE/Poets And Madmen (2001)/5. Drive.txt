Wheels keep turning
Blind desires
Core ambition
Never tires

Got an engine
Got intentions
No dissensions
Nothing to hide

Gotta' mission
Street munitions

Any road block
I believe
And I believe
And I believe
And I believe
I'll run it

You'll know I'll run it

Road side tyrants
Revolution
Speed is silent
Absolution

Got reactions
Got attractions
Each infraction
We're gonna' die

Got redemption
Fools intentions

Any road block
I believe
And I believe
And I believe
And I believe
I'll run it
