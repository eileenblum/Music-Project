Twisted little sister
rollerskate baby
driving me crazy tonight
I'm bound in your luscious chains
beat me and hurt me
I love to get into pain

you never knew
what this pain could do for you
go down-down-down
to the penitentiary
I tried suicide-
little sister ride

hoping for more bodies to burn
for such an action
call main attraction your love
I'm gagged-gagged and tied to a bed
sweet tasting sister
love what you do to my head

you never knew
what this pain could do for you
go down-down-down
to the penitentiary
I tried suicide-
little sister ride

broken-broken heart at the seams
hey I know you hate me
you know you ate me so mean
but now that my session is through
twisted sister I'm longing for you (come here)
you never knew baby I need you.

you never knew
what this pain could do for you
go down-down-down
to the penitentiary
I tried suicide-
little sister ride
