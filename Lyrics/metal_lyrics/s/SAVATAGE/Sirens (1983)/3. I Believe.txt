Beyond the skies, rising so high
Set a course for the unknown

But I believe there's life out there
Somehow we'll find it

The countdown begins
Our ship soon will launch
On it's perilous flight to the stars
A civilized race, on some distant world
We'll find you wherever they are

I believe we'll find a new world
Can't you see we cannot return?

Systems are go as we leave behind
A planet that's doomed to end
Nuclear wars, the polluted seas
Doomsday begins it's descent

Where do we go?
What'll we find?
Is there life?
Other than mine?

I believe

For two thousand years we sought and we searched
The galaxy's black holes in space
Then on the day of 30-13 we came upon a race
I believe we can survive on this sphere
Plotting a course to enter the stratosphere
We're finally here, can we survive?
A cryosphere
I hope there's life

I believe

We land our ship on a green barren plain
Once outside from a box the voice came:

(shifted at least one octave down)
Welcome to Earth
May we ask who you are?
Our race is called Man
The planet is done, done, done, done, done, done, done!

Planet is doomed
Hands off the moon
Forget the tune

Hands off the moon
Strike at the two
Forget the blue
