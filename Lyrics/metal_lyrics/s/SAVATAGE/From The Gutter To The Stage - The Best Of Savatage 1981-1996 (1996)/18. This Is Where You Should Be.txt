[Bonus Track]

[Written by Jon Oliva]

Time it slips away, life it carries on
I remember telling you a dream
About a girl that I had seen
The kind that steals your heart away
Then she fades into the night
All I remember are her eyes
I wish she could be found
My heart can feel her
My arms can't reach her
I want you back oh baby I need to see you
Here with me
This is where you should be ooh
She's a fantasy, a vision I can't resist
I search the darkness of my mind
Trying to find a reason why
She's only in my dreams
Well she better do it
Will I ever see her again?
Does she know I want her now
My heart can feel her
My arms can't reach her
I want you back oh baby I need to see you
Here with me
This is where you should be
ooh this is where you should be
My heart can feel her
My arms can't reach her
I want you back oh baby I need to see you
Here with me
This is where you should be [Repeat]
