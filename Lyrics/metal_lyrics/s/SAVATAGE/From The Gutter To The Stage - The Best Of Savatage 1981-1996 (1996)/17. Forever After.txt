[Bonus Track]

[Written by Jon Oliva, Criss Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

You watch the news on your color TV
Are you immune to what you see
Death and destruction
Till it numbs your mind
To the rise and fall of all mankind

Hey you
What ya gonna do
When it's your world they're selling out
But, you got your plot
Smokin' your pot
Till the trees are all dead
You never knew, hadn't a clue
You can't hide your head, head
In your hands
Nobody's safe
Forever after

Let's kill the leaders
Make it end
But then we realize
We are them

We buy the plastics
Burn the fuels
We make the choice
We are the rules

Hey you
What ya gonna do
When it's your world they're selling out
But, you got your plot
Smokin' your pot
Till the trees are all dead
You never knew, hadn't a clue
You can't hide your head, head in your hands
No one's safe
Forever after

Hey you
What ya gonna do
When it's your world they're selling out
But, you got your plot
Smokin' your pot
Till the trees are all dead
You never knew, hadn't a clue
You can't hide your head, head in your hands
Nobody's safe
Forever after
Forever after
Forever after
Forever after
