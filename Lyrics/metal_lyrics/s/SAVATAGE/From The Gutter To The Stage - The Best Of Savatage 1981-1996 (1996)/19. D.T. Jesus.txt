[Bonus Track]

[Written by Jon Oliva, Criss Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

Jesus was a talker
Out-of-place New Yorker
Hung out on the boulevard
Sellin' nickel candies
Saving up all his quarters
Bought himself a cheap guitar

Started playin' bars
The kids came in their cars
You'd hear them shouting at the stage

Jesus saves
Jesus saves
Hear him cut through the night
On your late night radio waves

Jesus started changin'
Things got really strange
He saw his tee-shirts everywhere
Started missing shows
The band came down to blows
But Jesus he no longer cared

Things got out of hand
And so he quit the band
But still the critics they would rave

Jesus saves
Jesus saves
Hear him cut through the night
On your late night radio waves

So the dice were cast
Today become the past
Jesus just disappeared
He was headed for New York
Or so his label thought
And there he gave away the years

Jesus saves
Jesus saves
Hear him cut through the night
On your late night radio waves
