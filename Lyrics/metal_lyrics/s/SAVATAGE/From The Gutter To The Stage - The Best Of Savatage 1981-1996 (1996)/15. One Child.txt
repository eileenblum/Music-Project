[Written by Jon Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

One child stood before the altar
One child stood out in the rain
One child spent his time imagining
And I don't believe he's coming home again, home again, home a...

[chorus]
Right there in the earth, I've been drawing a line
I'm digging it deep, don't know if I'll find
A tunnel out so we all can be saved
If not, just take this earth and bury me, for this will be my grave

One child hid inside the darkness
One child never said a thing
One child closed his eyes and disappeared
But at night I still can hear him whispering, whispering, whisper...

[chorus]
Right there in the earth, I've been drawing a line
I'm digging it deep, don't know if I'll find
A tunnel out so we all can be saved
If not, just take this earth and bury me, for this will be my grave

(lead break/coda)
I will believe in you
If you still want me to
Or tell me I'm on my own
There on the other side
Tell me the Pilate's died
And we're no longer alone

[bridge]
Take your answers and your promises, believe me I don't care
I have held on to your words until I found them only air
What good are your promises if you can always take them back?
Still, I hang on every word till my hands are bleeding

[coda]
I will believe in you
If you still want me to
Or tell me I'm on my own
There on the other side
Tell me the Pilate's died
And we're no longer alone

[simultaneously]

I will believe in you  We had no choice but to stay and follow
If you still want me to  We have nothing left except tomorrow
Or tell me I'm on my own  We have nothing left except what will be
There on the other side  What we need here are some real decisions
Tell me the Pilate's died  While you only offer mindless visions
And we're no longer alone  Visions that nobody else here can see
