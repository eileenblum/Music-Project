[Written by Jon Oliva, Criss Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

I've been here since '81
That's a long time
I've seen all there is to see

Had a space on Astor Place
Had it all once
Now these streets
Are my reality

Because
New York City
Don't mean nothing
It's just a good place when you're running
Lights they cut so bright they make you bleed

Neon children live their lives there
Mad magicians tinsel nightmares
Still you know I'm never gonna leave

Never sleep alone on the subway
Never walk alone on the tracks
Never take a ride to the edge of your mind
Unless you've got a ticket back
Don't believe in T.V. preachers
Don't believe in talk show stars
Never follow trends if they turn on your friends
Just be sure you know who your friends are

'Cause if you're running blind
On a refueled mind
Better watch the time
Careful you don't go too far

Never burn the bridges before you
Never burn the bridges behind
Don't burn the one that you're walking on
Gonna hit the water in time

Don't believe in expectations
Don't believe in shooting stars
If you make a stand on a dead empty hand
Never let 'em see your cards

'Cause if you're running blind
On a refueled mind
Better watch the time
Careful you don't go too far
Too far

New York City
Don't mean nothing
It's just a good place when you're running
Still you know I'm never gonna leave
