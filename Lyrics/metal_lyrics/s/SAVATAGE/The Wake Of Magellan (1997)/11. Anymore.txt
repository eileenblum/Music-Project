[Music &amp; Words: Jon Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

Don't want to walk upon the water
Don't want to look across the waves
Instead of seeing hills of water

I just see markers on their graves

But in the fading of a season
To look across an empty sky
For a forgotten childhood reason
To once more wish that you could

Close your eyes and just believe again
There's a god does he remember when
We were young and faith was not pretend

Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

And in the night he sees the ocean
Carve its thoughts upon the shore
For in the way it was created
It can do this and nothing more

And every message it would leave him
The next wave carefully erased
As the tears that passed between them

Were so real that you could

Close your eyes and just believe again
There's a god and he remembers when
We were young and faith was not pretend

Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

And all at once the waves were getting
Higher
And as they crashed I thought I heard them say
There'd be a time when men would all be wiser
When everyone, everyone,

Yes everyone is

Saved

AND AS HE WALKED AWAY HE THOUGHT ABOUT
THAT THIRD STOWAWAY ONCE MORE
AND WONDERED IF THE BODY HAD WASHED UP
UPON SOME FAR AND DISTANT SHORE

OR IF IT SANK DOWN THROUGH THE DEPTHS
OF COLD REALITY
TO REST UPON THE OCEAN FLOOR
FOR ALL ETERNITY

FOR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
THE DEAD DO NOT FEEL PAIN
AND NEATH THE OCEAN MADE OF TEARS

THEY NEVER FEAR THE RAIN

BUT WHAT HAD REALLY HAPPENED
WAS A STRANGER TWIST OF FATE
THAT THE DECKHAND WAS TO NEVER KNOW
BUT TO YOU I WILL RELATE
