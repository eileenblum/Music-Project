[Bonus Track]

[Music and Lyrics by Jon Oliva]

[verse 1]
Desiree, listen to your heart
Have the dreams all been scattered
Or are the words just parts

'cause in these ruins alone
I've been watching you
A ghost among these stones
Desiree I've got to tell you

[chorus 1]
What goods a tear without a face
To suffer its downward fall from grace
and across my heart, Desiree I wish you'd see...

Scars are the wounds that we all show
Time only heals if you let go
If you're letting go, Desiree I wish you'd think of...

[verse 2]
If you only take chances, when every angle is safe
Have partnerless dances, and castles where you wait
But I see far away, a distance in your eye
As you go on alone, piling up your alabis

[chorus 1]
What goods a tear without a face
To suffer its downward fall from grace
and across my heart, Desiree I wish you'd see...

Scars are the wounds that we all show
Time only heals if you let go
If you're letting go, Desiree I wish you'd think of...

[sub-chorus 1]
Lost in a movie script, with no words left to say
You leave on that plane alone
And there inside a midnight fog
I turn and walk away...

[chorus 2]
What goods a tear that falls from grace
What goods a life that leaves no trace
When its time is done, Desiree I wish you'd see...

Who needs a heart that never bleeds
Never retreats and never needs
If it's all alone, Desiree I wish you'd think of... me
