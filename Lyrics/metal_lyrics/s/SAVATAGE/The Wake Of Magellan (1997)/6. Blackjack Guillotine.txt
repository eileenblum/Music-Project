[Music &amp; Words: Jon Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

Blackjack guillotine
Razor sharp

Always clean
Gotta lie
Very wide
Once inside she knows what to do
She knows what to do

Skin tight

China white
Just another neon life
In the vein
Leaves a stain
All the time you know that it's true
You know that its true

So tell me what you had in store
It doesn't matter anymore
It never did, it never will
But I'll be out there waiting still

You're moving fast but leaving tracks
A compromise to your attacks
There comes a time you want to take it back
Back

Back

Back
But can't think of nothing I
Can't think of nothing I
Can't think of nothing I
Lack

Junkie

Credit card
Gotta vein
Goes for yards
Hypnotised
You decide
Every neuron's changing its view
Changing its view

Gentlemen

Summarize
Every lie
Well disguised
Don't forget

Neuron death
In the mind awaiting its cue
Awaiting its cue

And so we found it very mod
The worshiping of lesser gods
And lie they do
For lie they must
For they know it's the lie we trust

And so we're out there laying tracks
Wherever there's a vein to pack
There comes a time you want to take it back
Back
Back
Back
Back
But I can't think of nothing
I can't think of nothing
I can't think of nothing
I lack

THE SAILOR ASKED HOW SO YOUNG A MAN
COULD HAVE FALLEN INTO SUCH A TRAP
AND THE OCEAN SAID THE FIRST TIME WAS WITH A FRIEND
WHO NOW CAN'T TAKE IT BACK

IT WAS A FRIENDLY GESTURE
AS THEY ALL CLAIM AT THE TIME
WHEN THAT FRIEND OR KINDLY STRANGER
FREE OF CHARGE GAVE HIM HIS FIRST LINE

TO HARM THIS BOY THEY'RE SURE TO SAY
WAS NEVER OUR INTENT
AND WE WERE AS SHOCKED AS ANYONE
WITH JUST HOW FAR HE WENT

HE NEVER THOUGHT IT DANGEROUS
AS HE STUCK IT IN HIS VEIN
THAT A NEEDLE THAT HAD SEEMED SO SHORT

COULD REACH STRAIGHT INTO HIS BRAIN

IT WAS UPON THIS VERY BEACH
THAT HIS FIRST LINE WAS TRIED
AND WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT WAY BACK THEN
THAT HERE IS WHERE HE'D DIE

IF THESE WORDS SEEM REPETITIOUS
AND THE SUBJECT BEATEN DEAD
THE REASON THAT I STILL SAY IT
IS IT STILL NEEDS TO BE SAID
