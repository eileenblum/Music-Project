[Music and Lyrics by Jon Oliva]

[verse 1]
Time, it slips away
Life it carries on
I remember telling you a dream

About a girl that I had seen
The kind that steals your heart away
Then she fades into the night

All I remember are her eyes
I wish she could be found

[chorus 1]
My heart can feel her
My arms can't reach her
I want you back, oh, baby I need to see you!
here with me yeah

This is where you should be, oh

[verse 2]
She's a fantasy
A vision i can't resist

I search the darkness of my mind
To try and find the reason why
She's only in my dreams

Well she better do it
Will i ever see her again?
Does she know I want her know?

[chorus 1]
My heart can feel her
My arms can't reach her
I want you back, oh, baby I need to see you!
here with me yeah

This is where you should be
Oh
This is where you should be
Oh Oh

My heart can feel her
My arms can't reach her
I want you back, oh, baby i need to see you
here with me yeah

This is where you should be
Oh
This is where you should be
oh
This is where you should be
Oh
This is where you should be
Oh
