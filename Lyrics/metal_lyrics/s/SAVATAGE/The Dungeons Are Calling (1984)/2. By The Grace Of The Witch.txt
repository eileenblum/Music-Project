alone in the darkness
lonely and scared
you're in fear of your life
deadly witch's crystal
sensing your fears
my spell is cast on you
my little dear

do you feel you're captured by the grace of the witch
do you feel you're captured by the grace of the witch

look into my eyes
I'm poisoning you
I watch as you
grovel in my stew
I'm bastardized
cursed by sin
come on down to hell
watch the flames begin

I've got evil on my mind
my power so divine
my spells cannot be broke
until I hang the rope
I am not alive or dead
I'm a spirit dressed in red
I come from the grave
your soul I plan to take

do you feel you're captured by the grace of the witch
do you feel you're captured by the grace of the witch

look into my eyes
I'm poisoning you
I watch as you
grovel in my stew
I'm bastardized
cursed by sin
come on down to hell
watch the flames begin

do you feel you're captured by the grace of the witch
do you feel you're captured by the grace of the witch
