Never thought you'd go away
Did not believe the things you'd say
Now you're gone
I don't understand why you'd leave for some distant land
Can we talk before you go
I'm calling out your name
But you can win again

Fighting, I fight for your love
I'm fighting, fight for your love

Still I look all over for you
There's nothing left that I can do, yeah babe
You're on the streets
You know it's wrong
It's not where a woman belongs
Better run while you can
I'm calling out your name
But you can win again

Fighting, I fight for your love
I'm fighting, fight for your love

Did you leave me to it all
To see us anymore
I'm calling out your name
You can win again

Fighting, I fight for your love
I'm fighting, fight for your love
