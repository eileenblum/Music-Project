[Music &amp; Words: Jon Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

We never fear the night, we bring our own starlight
Dropped on the world below, wait for the afterglow

We never fear the night, we bring our own starlight
Dropped on the world below, wait for the afterglow
And in the dark they wed, we're dancing with the dead
And if the ground's been stained, colors run in the rain

[chorus]
Run away, no delay - do we have to show you?
Don't expect mercy yet, we don't even know you
Hear the press, nothing less - saying that we don't care
Understand it's the land and you'd have to be there

We never contemplate, we only offer fate
And in the night they arc, flowering in the dark
Filling the sky with red, till all their needs are fed
Then like the childhood tear they quickly disappear

[chorus]
Run away, no delay - do we have to show you?
Don't expect mercy yet, we don't even know you
Hear the press, nothing less - saying that we don't care
Understand it's the land and you'd have to be there

[middle 8]

[chorus]
Run away, no delay - do we have to show you?
Don't expect mercy yet, we don't even know you
Hear the press, nothing less - saying that we don't care
Understand it's the land and you'd have to be there

[coda]

IN THE WORLD OF DEATH AND MURDER
THEY'RE THOSE WHO DO THE DEED
BUT WAITING IN THE SHADOWS
ARE THE MEN WHO SEWED THE SEEDS

THEY MAKE THEIR THIRTY-PIECES
SELLING GUNS TO ALL WHO PAY
AND WHEN BULLETS PIERCE THE FLESH
THEY ARE SAFELY FAR AWAY

AND BACK IN SARAJEVO
A GIRL STOOD INSIDE THE ROOM
LISTENING TO MEN CALLED MERCHANTS
OFFER GUNS TO FORESTALL DOOM

THEY SAID THEY CAME TO HELP
WHEN MUSLIMS PLIGHT THEY'D HEARD
BUT WHAT THEY HAD
SOMEHOW FAILED TO MENTION
WAS THEY SAID THE SAME THINGS
TO THE SERBS
