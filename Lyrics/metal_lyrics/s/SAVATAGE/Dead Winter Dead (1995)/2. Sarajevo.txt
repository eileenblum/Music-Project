[Music &amp; Words: Jon Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

In the town of Sarajevo, there's an old medieval square
There's a church aside one corner most believe was always there

It was built a thousand years before any now were born
And its glory was its belfry with its stones all gray... and worn

Now there's a gargoyle on that belfry and he's been up there for years
And he has watched and he has pondered: "What is laughter, what are tears?"

And he's never found his answers as he sees the years go by
But he watches and he wonders with his stone unblinking eyes

IT WAS THE YEAR OF NINETEEN-NINETY
AND THE BERLIN WALL WAS DOWN
AND A THOUSAND YEARS REGRETTED
NOW LAID BURIED IN THE GROUND

AND THE PROPHETS READ THE FUTURE
AND THE OMENS ALL SEEMED KIND
IN THE CLASSIC WORDS OF DICKENS
IT SURELY WAS THE BEST OF TIMES
