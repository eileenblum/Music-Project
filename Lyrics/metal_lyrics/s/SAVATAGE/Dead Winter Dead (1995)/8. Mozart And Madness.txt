[Music: Jon Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

[Instrumental]

[THE OLD MAN PLAYS HIS CELLO AS THE SHELLING STARTS.
THE ORCHESTRA COMES IN REPRESENTING THE MUSLIMS,
FOLLOWED BY THE BAND REPRESENTING THE SERBS. DURING
THE OCCASIONAL LULLS, IN THE FIGHTING, THE LONE CELLO
DRIFTS ACROSS THE BATTLEFIELDS.]

AND WHO WILL LOVE THE INCEST CHILD
OF IGNORANCE AND HATRED
WHO THROUGH SHE'S STANDING IN THE RAIN
NO TEAR HAS PENETRATED

FOR WHILE THEY BANTER BOUT THEIR WORDS
YOU MUST BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU TREAD
FOR NO MATTER WHAT THEY PROMISE
RUMOR IS THAT DEAD IS DEAD
