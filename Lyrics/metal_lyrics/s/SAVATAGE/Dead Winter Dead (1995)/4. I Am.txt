[Music &amp; Words: Jon Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

I see a little man sitting and he's wondering
If over his little plot he might be king
And he finds his present world a little boring

There's no land that is so small that it cannot divide
So come, I'll draw the line and you just pick your side
Ignoring anyone who gives a warning

[chorus]
For I am the answer you seek, the dream in your sleep
You never wanted to awaken
I have the plan that won't fail, a crime without trail
And all I really need right now is you!

[laugh]

I see a little man, thinking that he might need more
And so his eyes are drifting to the house next door
He wonders if his neighbors might be leaving

So he makes a little offer that they'll understand
There is no point in letting things get out of hand
For no one wants to see their widows grieving

[chorus]
For I am the answer you seek, the dream in your sleep
You never wanted to awaken
I have the plan that won't fail, a crime without trail
And all I really need is you!

[laugh]

[middle 8]

I am the word without deeds, the lie that exceeds
For lies are always most impatient
I am the guide for the lost, who never counts cost
And all I really need right now is you!
All I really need right now is you!
All I really need right now is you!
All I really need right now is you!
I see a little man sitting and he's wondering
All I really need right now is you!
I see a little man sitting and he's wondering
All I really need right now is you!
I see a little man sitting and he's wondering
All I really need right now is you!
I see a little man sitting and he's wondering
All I really need right now is you!
I see a little man sitting and he's wondering
All I really need right now is you!
I see a little man sitting and he's wondering
All I really need right now is you!
You! You! You! You! You!

IN EVERY BOOK OF HISTORY
IT IS WRITTEN HOW IT'S DONE
IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD
YOU NEED ONLY CHANGE THE YOUNG

AND SERDJAN ALEKSIC
STARED DEEPLY THROUGH THE NIGHT
BUT YOUR VISION'S NOT THE SAME
WHEN YOU'RE STARING THROUGH A SIGHT

AND A RIFLE'S NOT ENOUGH
WHEN YOU DON'T WISH OTHERS WELL
SO HE ANGLED OUT HIS MORTAR
AND HE DROPPED IN HIS FIRST SHELL
