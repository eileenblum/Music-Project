So would you tell me now
Are life and death a symmetry
Balanced on scales
Neither side chosen
And could these moments
Balance out against eternity
Promise inferred
Words never spoken

My life is burning
Could you read by the light
Letters I've written
Never to follow
Poets and madmen
All defy reason
Still in my mind I know

I want to live my life with you
Dying hard
Play my whole hand until it's through
Dying hard

And in your arctic night
You contemplate eternity
Walking on water
Frozen in silence
And in that moment would you
Turn around and turn to me
Laughing away night's darker tyrants

My life is burning
Could you read by the light
Letters I've written
Never to follow
Poets and madmen
All defy reason
Still in my mind I know

I want to live my life with you
Dying hard
Play in my whole hand until it's through
Dying hard

Some nights I spend alone inside my head
But it's better than losing it
And if you want to turn your life around
It's your life you're choosing it

I want to spend my life with you
Dying hard
Play the whole hand until it's through
Dying hard
