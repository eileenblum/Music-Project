[bonus track]

[Written by Jon Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

So what can I tell you
If life's the length of this play
Perhaps God gave the answers
To those with nothing to say

The years are forgiven
If God's forgiving and kind
Perhaps we'll all find the answers
Somewhere in time
Somewhere in ...

You were never one for waiting
Still I always thought you'd wait for me
And have you from your dreams awakened
And from where you are what do you see

Which of us is now in exile
Which in need of amnesty
Are you now but an illusion
In my mind alone you breathe

You believed in things that I will never know
You were out there drowning but it never showed
Till inside a rainswept night you just let go

You've thrown it all away
And now we'll never see the ending to the play
The grand design, the final line
And what was meant to be

In the dark a distant runner
Now has disappeared into the night
Leaving us to stand and wonder
Staring from this end into your life

You believed in things that I will never know
You were out there drowning but it never showed
'Til inside a rainswept night you just let go

You've thrown it all away
And now we'll never see the ending to the play
The grand design, the final line
And what was meant to be
