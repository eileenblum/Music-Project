[bonus track]

[Written by Jon Oliva, Criss Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

Hey child
Out on your own
You never look back
Never called home
You never turned round
Tell me the games that you play

Nighttime
Wander the streets
You never give ground
Never retreat
You're always Oz-bound
Have all the dreams been betrayed

Stay
Here where dreams tend to stray
Here you're safe when the night fades away
When the night fades away

Hey there
Oz-refugee
You took the wrong road
Hatters and tea are all that you found
Out on the great white way

Times change
You never did
Life came
You overbid
Join us
Vassals of courvasier

Stay
Here where dreams tend to stray
Here you're safe when the night fades away
When the night fades away

Thanks to metallica1980m for sending track #11 lyrics.
