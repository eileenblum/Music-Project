I really want to know
What you had in store
I couldn't really tell
Maybe it's just as well
I came here with a dream
And I just had to see
If my dream would soar
I knocked on every door

His whole life was written
Written there inside
The new weekly bible
His modern T.V. Guide
Every night he stares back at the screen, yeah

A man only sees want he wants to see
When he's in his mind
Where he is that he wants to be
Living in a world where he's safe from reality
Won't you take a chance on this night
And follow me
Won't you follow me (repeat)

Don't need no super heroes
Don't need no movie stars
Don't need no politicians
In big black shiny cars
Don't need no preacher
Whose church is my T.V.

A man only sees what he wants to see
When he's in his mind
Where he is what he wants to be
Living in a world where he's safe from reality
Won't you take a chance on this night child
And follow me
Won't you follow me (repeat)

Once was a broken hero
The kind that we all know
The kind that hides inside us
For we never show
The kind we say that could never be me

His whole life was written
Written there inside
The new weekly bible
His modern T.V. Guide
Stare back at the screen, yeah yeah

A man only sees want he wants to see
