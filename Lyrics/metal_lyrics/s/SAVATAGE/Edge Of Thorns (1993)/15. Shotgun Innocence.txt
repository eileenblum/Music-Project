[bonus track]

[Written by Jon Oliva, Criss Oliva, Paul O'Neill]

She's got shotgun innocence
In her eyes so intense
Never sure of her intent

She's a Paris pretty child
Even got a wink that's styled
Keeps it all behind a smile

Look into those worldly eyes
And you've got to wonder what she's done
No use thinking you can win her
Cause this child's already won

And it's time that you stand up
Show's on
Here's why you paid
Hold tight
Net's gone
So welcome to the stage
And it's too late to be saved

She don't need designer dress
Has them all though I would guess
Got the wardrobe of the blessed

Cover of a magazine
Movie star, beauty queen
All wrapped up and razor clean

Locking up with paradise
Is really so much harder than it seems
See her as a revelation
Much more safely visited in dreams

And it's time that you stand up
Show's on
Here's why you paid
Hold tight
Net's gone
So welcome to the stage
And it's too late to be saved

So you find you're dreaming about her
But it's such a little vice
And if you think you've got a chance, boy
Well it's time to roll the dice

Stand up
Show's on
Here's why you paid
Hold tight
Net's gone
So welcome to the stage

Stand up
Show's on
Here's why you paid, yeah
Hold tight, yeah
Net's gone
So welcome to the stage
And it's too late to be saved
Before it's too late Shotgun innocence Innocence
