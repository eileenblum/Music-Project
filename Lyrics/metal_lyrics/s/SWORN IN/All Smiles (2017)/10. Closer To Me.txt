Do you mind if I stay
Do you care if I stick close to you
I have lived in your skin so long
You let me out and now you'll see me

So why don't you
Why don't you
Don't you come closer to me
Closer to me
Why don't you stay
Closer to me

I swear I won't bite
Pulled my teeth for you
Sewed my lips up tight
Do you have a clue?
If you're not sure I'd love to review

I'm the part inside with every single shitty trait
I'm the part inside you try to kill but love to hate
You never knew but could always relate
You can't ignore me, it's way too late

So why don't you
Why don't you
Don't you come closer to me
Closer to me
Why don't you stay
Closer to me

I'm taking over
It's long overdue
Don't act surprised
Cause you always knew
I'm taking over
It's long overdue
Don't act surprised
I'm taking over
It's long overdue
Don't act surprised
Cause I'm always in you

So why don't you
Why don't you
Don't you come closer to me
Closer to me
Why don't you stay
Closer to me

Come closer
Come closer
Why don't you
Come closer

Come closer
Come closer
Why don't you
Come closer
