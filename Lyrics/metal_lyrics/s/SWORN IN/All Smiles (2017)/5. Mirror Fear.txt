I'd cauterize my eyes to avoid the fear
Of looking into a fucking mirror
I see ugly, I don't see a trace of me
Tell me it's not true I'll smile and fucking disagree
I'd cauterize my eyes to avoid the fear
Of looking into a fucking mirror
It might sound dramatic but it's sincere
I'd do anything to look and have nothing appear

Distorted glass shimmers through my spine
Warped reflections this body's not fucking mine
My face gets cold while the rest of me sweats
Cope with a bottle and two packs of cigarettes

Strung out and burnt up beyond repair
If I could see what you see I'd be fine I swear
But I don't and I just fucking can't
I'm sorry for the bother, I didn't mean to rant

I'd cauterize my eyes to avoid the fear
Of looking into a fucking mirror
I see ugly, I don't see a trace of me
Tell me it's not true I'll smile and fucking disagree
I'd cauterize my eyes to avoid the fear
Of looking into a fucking mirror
It might sound dramatic but it's sincere
I'd do anything to look and have nothing appear

Dig at my face
Rip out my hair
Let's start from scratch just in case
Claw at my skin
Dig at my face
Rip out my hair
I can't remember who I am so I'll erase

Erase
Erase
Erase
Erase
Erase
Erase
I'll fucking erase
Erase
Erase
Erase
Erase
Erase
Erase

This body's not fucking mine
This body's not fucking mine

I can't remember who I am so I'll erase
I can't remember who I am so I'll erase
I can't remember who I am so I'll erase
I can't remember who I am so I'll erase
Let's start from scratch
Just in case

Claw at my skin
Dig at my face
Rip out my hair
Let's start from scratch just in case
Claw at my skin
Dig at my face
Rip out my hair
I can't remember who I am so I'll erase
