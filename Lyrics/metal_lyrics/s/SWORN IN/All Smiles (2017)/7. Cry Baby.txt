I don't know why
And I can't explain it
It's as close as I can get to feeling sedated
I make it bad
I make it hard
Won't do it unless it leaves me scarred

Give me all the misery
It's all for me
It's all for me
It's all for me

Give me all the misery
I'm a glutton for punishment
I said give me all the misery
Guess it's masochistic to a degree

I do it to myself if you couldn't tell
I fucking love
I fucking love
I fucking love living in hell

I do it to myself if you couldn't tell
I fucking love
I fucking love
I fucking love living in hell

Cry baby
Cry baby
I love the sting
The tears from my eyes bring

Stay away
Stay away
You don't want to get too close
Fixing for destruction
I promise you don't want to be my dose

I don't know when I'm lying
I don't know when I'm awake
I'm alive when I'm crying
With that there's no mistake
No mistake

Cry baby
Cry baby
I love the sting
The tears from my eyes bring
Cry baby
I'll sing myself to sleep

If you come my way motherfucker
I'll only warn you this one time
If you come my way motherfucker
Turn around, turn around
'Cause I'm human slime
You dont wanna stick around
I can't blame you though
'Cause I'm bad fuckin news baby girl
I forgot to let you know, you know
If you come my way motherfucker
I'll only warn you this one time
If you come my way motherfucker
Turn around, turn around
'Cause I'm human slime

You don't wanna stick around
And I just can't blame you though
I'm bad fuckin news baby
And I never let you know
I never let you know

I fucking love living in hell
I fucking love living in hell
I fucking love living in hell
I fucking love living in hell
I fucking love living in hell
