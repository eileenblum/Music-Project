It's not manipulation if I let you do it
So don't feel fucking bad because I'm begging you to do it
Cause when I get like this
I really can't dismiss
I'm lifeless all around and I want to reminisce

When I try to set it straight
I fold and feel the weight
I'm digging at my ears
But I can't understand what they say
They interrupt and scream
But now I get the theme
It's all a big god damn scheme

Be my, be my puppeteer
Pull my strings
Feed me lines
And whisper in my ear

I'm off the rails
I'm on the lam
I hate who I am
I'm off the rails
I'm on the lam
Tell me what to do, that's the plan

Pose me in any fashion
Change the way I walk
I'd rather be a puppet
Than an outline in chalk

Be my, be my puppeteer
Pull my strings
Feed me lines
And whisper in my ear

Be my, be my puppeteer
Pull my strings
Feed me lines
And whisper in my ear

I am a marionette
I am a lifeless threat

I am a marionette
I am a lifeless threat
I am a marionette
I am a lifeless threat
I am a marionette
I am a lifeless threat
