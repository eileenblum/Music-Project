Round and round
Round and round
I'm all smiles
Round and round
We go
Round and round
We go
I'm all smiles

Don't show them
Don't ever let them see that side of me
Just use a prosthetic smile you fucking amputee

Round and round
Round and round
I'm all smiles

They say, the eyes are the window to the soul
If you couldn't tell that mine is dead the grin met it's goal
Distractions and first impressions
Throw you off with fake expressions
Throw you off with fake expressions

I never let you see inside
I don't leave room for anything to be implied
I never let you see inside
Run better run if I ever get untied

Ten nine eight
I just can't relate
Seven six five four
Shut the door
Three two one
Real self?
There's none

Even in my dreams it doesn't ever stop
I wish that at least there I could take off this fucking prop
But it's stuck, it's glued to my face
So I'm stuck right here, couldn't keep up the pace
I'll say it again just in case
This smiles my saving grace

Round and round
Round and round
I'm all smiles
Round and round we go
Round and round we go
I'm all smiles

I swear nobody looks twice
As long as I keep up this smirk
And at this point
And at this point
It doesn't even seem to take any work

Round and round
Round and round
I'm all smiles
Round and round we go
Round and round we go
I'm all smiles

Ten nine eight
I just can not relate
Seven six five four
So I shut the fucking door
Three two one
Real self?
There is none
Happy now?
I was honest
Now let's be done
