Nothing works so I'll count down from three
Your gaze hurts please don't fucking look at me
It fucking hurts when I feel their eyes staring at me
Like peeling off my skin, I'm begging you don't look at me
It fucking hurts when I feel their eyes staring at me
Like peeling off my skin
Don't look at me

Don't you
Don't you
Don't you
Don't look at me
Look at me

I don't exist to myself
So what the fuck do you see
Fuck, make it stop, I feel them burning my brain

Eyes
Eyes
Bloodshot
They're glaucomatic
It's traumatic

Your versions of me are clouding my vision
We're gettin' close to the time for incision
Pressures building and my eyes are gonna burst
If this is how you see me I'll make sure that I'm the worst

It's not me
I'm not me
Don't look at me
It's not me
I said
Don't you fucking look at me
Torture when strangers stare
And if they knew they wouldn't
Care

It's not me
I'm not me
Don't look at me
It's not me
It's not me
I'm not me
Don't look at me
It's not me

It fucking hurts when I feel their eyes staring at me
Like peeling off my skin
I'm begging you don't look at me
It fucking hurts when I feel their eyes staring at me
Like peeling off my skin
Don't look at me

Back up bitch
Don't you, don't you, don't look at me
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't look at me
Look at me

My head is down and I'm looking at my feet
Whatever you're doing sure as shit's not discrete
I don't sleep and I can't fucking eat
Cause I know they all see
A fuck up who admits defeat
