Trace your vital veins
Too easy to get inside their brains
Trace your vital veins
Too easy to get inside their brains

I feel it
I see it
I know how you think
I sharpened the edge
Now I let it sink
I get what I want
And you're easy to fool
Keep a smile while I butcher
That's the only rule

I'll smile so loud it cuts you
Like the blade I use to strip your skin
There's nothing in this world that I can't spin

I'll smile so loud it cuts you
No you won't see the knife, only my grin
There's nothing in this world that I can't spin

Can't feel it
Can't see it
You don't know what I am on the inside
This serrated self is a part of me
And if it's sharp as can be
I sharpen more to guarantee

That when I lay into you
There's no room to disagree
So when I lay in you
Can't see me for me

Suck my teeth
Lick my lips
Gotta keep my mouth shut
Or the blood drips

I'll smile so loud it cuts you
Like the blade I use to strip your skin
There's nothing in this world that I can't spin

I'll smile so loud it cuts you
No you won't see the knife, only my grin
There's nothing in this world that I can't spin

Look at my
Lips curl
While I flash a smile
I know you can't see

Look at my
Lips curl
While I flash a smile
I know you can't see

Look at my
Lips curl
While I flash a smile
I know you can't see
