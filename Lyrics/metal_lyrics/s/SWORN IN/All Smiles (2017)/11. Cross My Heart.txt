I wish nobody poked these holes
At the top of this god damn jar
I never knew
I never knew
That you're my least favorite part

I crossed my heart

You say you want it
I say you don't
You say you want it but you won't

There's only needles
There's no more eyes
You say you want it
I've given you so many tries
I've given you so many tries

Cross my heart
And hope to die
I'll never understand
So I won't try

It's been a while since I let you breathe
It doesn't matter how many times I've tried to make you leave
We're the same and there's nothing I can do
I accept this part and I think I love it too

Cross my heart
And hope to die
I'll never understand
So I won't try

Cross my heart
And hope to die
I'll never understand
So I won't try

Bad luck
Bad luck
Bad luck
Bad luck
I won't fight it
I won't fight it
We're fucking stuck

Stuck together here to stay

Do you know what it's like?
To have the worst in you glorified
By fucks who only care
When you're sad or if you cried
Positive reinforcement for feeling suicidial?
For wishing I was dead?
Why didn't you ask if I was okay instead?
