I don't feel shit unless it's pain
Nothing registers no not even my name
If you decide to get close
What I need the most
Is my face in the dirt
Make it hurt

Pupils dilate
Salivating don't make me wait
Break my ribs
Rip out my nails
I feel alive, it never fails

Make it hurt
Make it hurt
I can't feel you if you don't
Make it hurt
Make it hurt
I can't feel you if you won't
Make it hurt
I can't feel you if you don't
Make it hurt

I'm pulling out my jagged teeth, I need to know what's underneath
I'm pulling out my jagged teeth, I need to know what's underneath

Can't take one more second
Hearing the voices disagree
They're not speaking words so dig your nails into my throat
And listen to my plea

Make
It
Hurt

Make it stop
Make it quiet for a bit
I'm fucked in the head
That much I'll admit
So do me a favor
I know the cure
Make it hurt for me
Don't ask cause I'm sure

Help me out
Make it quiet for tonight
I know it's not safe
But I'll be alright
Make it stop
Make it quiet for a bit
I'm fucked in the head
That much I'll admit

Make it hurt
Make it hurt
I can't feel you if you don't
Make it hurt
Make it hurt
I can't feel you if you won't
Make it hurt
I can't feel you if you don't
Make it hurt

I just want to bleed out
Bleed out
I want to suffocate in plain site
What a delight, what a delight
I want to suffocate in plain plain site

I wanna watch you let me die
I wanna watch you let me die
I wanna watch you let me die
I wanna watch you let me die
