You fooled me once
I fooled me too
They say the shame is on me
I say the shame is on you
You fooled me once
I fooled me too
I'll never forgive you
For the hell you put me through

It's like when people talk all I hear is white noise
And I feel like if I sit here for one more second I'll lose my poise
You can see it my eyes, it's no surprise
The lows outweigh the highs
The lows outweigh the highs

I can't stand the static sound
That always follows me around
I won't hear what you said
Let alone the thoughts in my head

I can't stand the static sound
That always follows me around
I won't hear what you said

You fooled me once
I fooled me too
They say the shame is on me
I say the shame is on you
You fooled me once
I fooled me too
I'll never forgive you
For the hell you put me through
Never, never, never

You can say it all you want but it won't make it true
Cause the things you wish you weren't are what make you you
Scream it til you're blue in the face
You always knew that I could vanish without a trace

Say it, say it, say it all you want but it's not true
The shit you hate about yourself is what makes you you
Call me a sociopath, you're not off base
Cause I fucking love that you were scared
I'd disappear without a trace

I won't be nice and I'm a bad bad man
This is what happens when you treat someone as less than
You
I'm a bad bad man

You fooled me once
I fooled you too
I'll never forgive you
For the hell you put me through

You fooled me once
I fooled me too
They say the shame is on me
I say the shame is on you
You fooled me once
I fooled me too
I'll never forgive you
For the hell you put me through
Never, never, never
