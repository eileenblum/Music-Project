Don't care 'bout the danger
Wanna be a stranger
Don't care 'bout the danger
Wanna be a stranger

You look so familiar guess I always knew
You're me and I'm you
All it took was seventy-two
Look down at me, at me
Please look down at me
Look down at me

Don't care 'bout the danger
Wanna be a stranger
Don't care about the danger
Wanna be a stranger

Did you help me stand tall?
Or did you trip me
Trick me and make me fall off
I won't lie this god damn time
You make me feel small
But I choose to fucking crawl

Don't care 'bout the danger
Wanna be a stranger
Don't care about the danger

I dread it all, I dread it all
I choose the peaks and I live in the falls
I'm feelin' small and it hurts to crawl
When I looked up were you looking down after all?

And if I'm gonna spiral out
Gotta maintain some control
I dread it all
I dread it

I dread it all
I dread
I dread it all
