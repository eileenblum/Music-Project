I said hell's not a place you find beneath the ground
Not a place you can see
Not a place you'll be found
Hell's not a place that you go when you're dead
Hell's inside your fucking head
Dragged to hell
Be quiet don't tell
I've made a deal to get out of my head
Trade my sanity to sleepÂ 
And trust me it's cheap
I'll let my body rot to the fore
Nevermore, Nevermore
And in the end I don't give a damn
It was all part of the planÂ 
I've lost it all and I still can't sleep
I can't feel, can't see and oh fuck I can't think
Maybe this is what I wanted
I've lost it all and I still can't sleep
I can't feel, can't see and oh fuck I can't think
Maybe this is what I wanted
Fuck...
I've lost it all and I still can't sleep
I can't feel, can't see and oh fuck I can't think
Maybe this is what I wanted...
I'm finally here in hell but I'm only a guest
