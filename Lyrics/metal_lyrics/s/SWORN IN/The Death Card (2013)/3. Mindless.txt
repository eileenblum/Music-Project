We're all mindless mother fuckers
Shit...
I'm stuck in my headÂ 
Dead again
I've lost what's real and what's pretend
I've lost everything, lost it all
I left my sanity behindÂ 
Inside the holes in my dry wallÂ 
I've lost everything
I lost it all
I've lost my head, I've lost my mind
It's nothing that i want you to findÂ 
With each passing day I continue to rot
Trying my best to retain my own thoughts
I've built my cage and I'm trapped inside itÂ 
Screaming and crying only makes it worseÂ 
I can't associate and I won't even tryÂ 
Don't give a fuck if I'm left here to die
Drag me away but there's no soul to sellÂ 
While you've been calling me I've been in hell
I've lost my head, I've lost my mind
It's nothing that i want you to findÂ 
With each passing day I continue to rot
Trying my best to retain my own thoughts
All of the thoughts in my head sing to the tune of your death
Hanging from a fucking rope
The noose is tied tight
This is how it ends, right?
One more step and down to hell I go
One more fucking step and down to hell I go
Down to hell I go
What?
I like to think I'm insane and that's not the worst part
Cause if I've lost my fucking mind I'll surely lose my heart.
Fuck.
I'd be lying if I said I want to be this way but it's a worldÂ full of liars
I'm just playing the game
