Just shut the fuck and listen to me, 
You're everything I've never wanted to be. 
Worthless piece of shit, seems like you've asked for it. 
Eighteen years too late and you're sentenced to your fate. 

Still fucking begging and pleading what don't you understand? 
What isn't clear? Can you adhere? I don't want you here. 

Dead bodies, dead souls, dead minds.
It's just these fucking thoughts that bind.

Three fucking cheers to these fears that keep you here,
Three fucking cheers for keeping me here too.
Three fucking cheers to these fears that keep me here,
Three fucking cheers for keeping you here too.

You'll burn in hell for what you did, worthless from birth, just a no name kid. 

Are you happy now? You've gotten what you wanted. And I'll make sure no matter what that you're always haunted.
Are you happy now? You've gotten what you wanted. And I'll make sure no matter what that you're always haunted.
Are you fucking happy now? You've gotten what you wanted. And I'll make sure no matter what that you're always haunted.

On your knees, begging, "Please forgive me."
No you'll die pleading.
Blood spewing through your teeth. 
You are nothing but a fucking thief.

Three fucking cheers to these fears that keep you here,
Three cheers for keeping me here too.
Three fucking cheers to these fears that keep me here.

Three fucking cheers to these fears that keep you here,
And three fucking cheers for keeping me here too.

Optimism is a fucking disease, you skip the 'think' and go straight to the 'believe'.
