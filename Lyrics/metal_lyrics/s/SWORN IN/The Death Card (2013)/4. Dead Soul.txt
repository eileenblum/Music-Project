Clear eyes are quickly getting blurryÂ 
All I feel is this furyÂ 
And while mind sits to rot
I'm trying to forget what I've been taught
Nothing is real, it's an illusion, it's a trick
The fog is getting thick, the fog is getting thick
I've lost my soul and there's no going back
Life seems to only have one fucking track
Into darkness I go
Don't pull me awayÂ 
Cause if I wanted to live I would have told you to say
What's the difference between life and death?Â 
I've been cursing your name with my every breath
My soul is dead
My soul is dead
And all I can do is dig my own grave
The way you act you must think it's funnyÂ 
But I know that life is not about love or money
Life has no meaning, I'm sure of it now
I'll take you to hell after taking my bow
No need for you to hearÂ 
Everything is perfectly clear
What's the difference between life and death?Â 
I've been cursing your name with my every breath
My soul is dead
My soul is dead
And all I can do is dig my own grave
Things are looking fucking bleak
