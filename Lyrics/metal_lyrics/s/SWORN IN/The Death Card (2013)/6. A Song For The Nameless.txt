I know I am not like you, and I know this shouldn't be true.
I've rearranged these wires hundreds of times.
I've rearranged these wires hundreds of times.
It's a curse I can't break, for your sake,
I just ache and ache, and it might be fake.
But it's a feeling I just can't shake.

(These are the screams, these are the screams of an outcast nation)
So sing along, sing along, sing along now.
(This is a hymn, this is a hymn to our separation)
So sing along this is just the beginning.

Go ahead, put a gun to my head.
I'm getting fucking used to being treated like I'm mislead.
I've never asked for acceptance, and I'm not starting now.
This entire world's my enemy.
This entire world's my enemy.

Fuck.

We are the birth, we are the construction.
We all are fighting ourselves
We are fighting ourselves.

(These are the screams, these are the screams of an outcast nation)
So sing along, sing along, sing along now.
(This is a hymn, this is a hymn to our separation)
So sing along this is just the beginning.

You can't stop a demon within (within).
It can be covered or imprisoned (imprisoned)
But one day that demon will show its face (its face),
It can't leave this place.

They say you have to fight your own demons, but how am I supposed to fight myself?
