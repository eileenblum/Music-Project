There's something I'm tired of just screaming in my head
So I'll finally say it out loud instead
Help
I'd say it out loud but I think if I did
This would be real, so instead I'll pretend

I'll pretend that I'm sleeping at night
I'll pretend that everything feels alright
I'll pretend that I'm sleeping at night
I'll pretend that everything feels alright

Don't want to arouse suspicion
Don't wanna have a god damn condition
So I'll keep my composition
It's my decision
I can't take it anymore
And I'll admit it, this isn't temporary
I've bled myself dry, just getting by
I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I

I need help
I can't do this on my own
I need help
I don't want to be alone

Back and forth I've been grinding my teeth in my sleep
They dig in deep, dreaming 'bout the day that the
That the....
Reaper reaper takes me away
I'm speaking up now I've got something to say
Wanted to die but now I want to stay
Reaper reaper takes me away

I need help
I can't do this on my own
I need help
I don't want to be alone
Saying it makes it real
I'm ready to tell you how I feel
I need help

For years I've let it take me away
Been lost floating in the endless gray
For years I've let it take me away
Been lost floating in the endless gray

Fuck

It started out small I really thought it was nothing at all
I never asked for help I never had a clue how
It grew bigger when my back was turned
I guess I never really knew how badly my world had burned
