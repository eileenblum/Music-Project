Existence
Trusting, myself to make the decisions that mean the most.
My body is lying so far off the fucking coast.
Taking a step back to see things from your eyes
It doesnât matter it still leads to my demise.
If I cant have faith in my thoughts in everything I have been taught
I cant help you, or myself, that's not something I can do there's noway I can help you or myself, that's not something I can do
Take, Take it all from me, Iâve given so much, when will you see.
Stop, look and listen. to the beating of the human heart.
Maybe one day ill learn to hear the voices in my head out.
Until then, ill keep floating until your voice brings me to a stop.
I thought the ghosts in my head were finally dead,
I thought the words kept inside were finally at rest.
I want to have faith in something more than this, faith in the voices that prove I exist.
I exist, do I exist?
I thought the ghosts in my head were finally dead,
I thought the words kept inside were finally at rest
Constricting, on my thoughts.  why is this happening, where is the start.
Take my body, take my soul.
Take it all from me
Take, take it all from me, Iâve given so much, when will you see
I will continue to persist, Show me, that I exist.  (these voices in my head are tearing me to shreds)
I JUST WANT TO FUCKING EXIST.
Prove to me, I have control. over what I do, am I just taking a cue?
Whats this life worth, if I canât decipher what I mean in the fucking scheme.
Take, take it all from me, Iâve given so much, when will you see
