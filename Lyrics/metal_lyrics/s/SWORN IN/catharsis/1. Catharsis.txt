Release the anger, cleanse yourself.
Let it all out, donât make amends.
This world has taken so much from us,
Pain and misery painted fucking black. 
What has been learned, in this life? 
All the things we have been taught.
Meaningless until we can take control.
Until then, fuck the rest.
Cleanse yourself of all the bullshit you see,
Release your anger and be free.
When will we give in, the answer is never.
The people who mean everything wonât last forever.
They wonât last forever.
I cant wait, for the day, when you finally get the fuck away
From all the fear, from all the pressure.
Learn to think for yourself, learn to accept who you are.
Until then, nobody will save you.
I wonât let your flaws affect my life.
I wonât let your flaws become my life.
This is the end of your life, your dreams.
Cleanse yourself of all the bullshit you see,
Release your anger with me and be free.
When will we give in, the answer is never.
The people who mean everything wonât last forever.
