This goes out to all of you,
To all of you who've played the fool.
Just stop pretending cause you've never really been there,

I don't need people like you in my life.
I don't need people like you in my life.

All you do is convince me that
I'd rather be let down than be a let down.

This goes out to all of you,
To all of you who've played the fool
When have I ever fucking bothered you?
I've been so careful with the paths that I choose,
When have I ever fucking bothered you?

This goes out to all of you, and everything that you do.

What the fuck? It has never been enough

It has never been enough,
And I'm trying to keep my cool but it's getting really tough
Why can't you find your composure?
This fucking world has left you in a hole,
And you're not getting out

This fucking world has put you in a hole and you're not getting out
You dug your own fucking grave, and this I know without a doubt

You dug your own grave, and this I know without a doubt.

You dug your own grave, and wrote your name cause things will never be the same.
You dug your own grave, I wish there was someone else to blame.

You can't see your own reflection cause the mirror's shattered.
Did you break to hide yourself from what matters?
You can't see your own reflection cause the mirror's fucking shattered.

I'd rather be let down than be a let down
Let's see who's laughing when you're six feet under the ground
You can't dig your own grave
It's not my fucking fault that you've been enslaved

I'm really sick of all these two-faced mother fuckers
With nothing better to do than judge the lives of others

I'd rather be let down than be a let down.
I'd rather be let down than be a let down.
