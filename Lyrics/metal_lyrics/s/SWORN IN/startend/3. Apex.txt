Iâm not about to give up on this
It seems impossible to tear a mountain out of the ground
You found a way, you lost your way, and thereâs no way around it
Thereâs no way youâll bring us down
I'm not about to give up on this
It seems impossible to tear a mountain out of the ground
Restart, rewind, letâs go back to the moment where it all declined
Iâm not about to give up
Iâve had enough
This world is fucked if every step I take I feel like Iâm in cuffs
I'm not about to lose my head
But Iâm quickly losing my mind
Iâm quickly losing my fucking mind
Iâm not putting my faith in you
Iâm done wasting my time
Letâs start this, take the first step, begin evacuation
Cause things can only go down from here
Never thought Iâd be the one who had to carry on a dream alone
Iâm fucking losing my mind
Iâve lost my mind
Iâve lost my friends
But Iâll keep this vision going till the very end
Iâve lost my mind
And thereâs nothing left
Letâs just say
That if this is what you call sane
Then Iâm perfectly fine with you forgetting my name
Forgetting everything weve been through
Letâs just say
That if this is what you call life
Then itâs been quite a while since my conscience has died
Iâll forget everything about you
Everything about you
Live for yourself, and no one else
Because we know that weâre all going straight to hell
