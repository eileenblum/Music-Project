Fuck you, if you think that you can take this away
And take the whole entire world with you while you run astray.
Thereâs no way, thereâs no way youâll take this away
Donât even act like you are innocent while you spit in my face
I heard somewhere,
Heard somewhere, that we all die alone, but
Youâll find yourself alone before you even die
Donât even try this shit
Iâve heard these words a thousand times too much
Fuck I canât believe what youâre doing to me
Itâs never been this easy, now Iâm thinking freely
If you think for a second that Iâm changing my mind, then youâre solely mistaken
Iâd be committing a crime
Iâm not giving in,
Iâm not giving up, but I think Iâve had enough
Iâm not giving it all or changing thereâs no second chances
Iâve heard these fucking words a thousand times too much
And I wonât take one more
Thereâs no room for second chances
Youâve drifted so far that Iâm not quite sure that youâre ever coming back
After everything that weâve been through
You shouldâve known better than to deviate away from something true
Thereâs no room for second chances
After everything weâve been through
Thereâs no room for second chances
Time to face the truth
Thereâs no room for second chances
After everything weâve been through
Thereâs no room for second chances
Time to face the truth
Oh deviant, as you hide behind your mask of fear
Iâm slowly waiting for this fucked up world to disappear
Oh deviant, I hope you will one day see
Iâd rather die before I let you get the best of me
I heard somewhere,
Heard somewhere, that we all die alone, but
Youâll find yourself alone before you even die
Donât even try this shit
Iâve heard these words a thousand times too much
