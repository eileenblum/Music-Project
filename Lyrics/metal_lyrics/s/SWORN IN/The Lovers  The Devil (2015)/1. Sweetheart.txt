Oh sweetheart, oh sweetheart
This is how we both start
Oh sweetheart, oh sweetheart
You're breaking my heart

Oh sweetheart, oh sweetheart
I'm tearing us apart
Oh sweetheart, oh sweetheart
You're breaking my heart

If he touched you
And you touched him
And things changed on a whim
Then I wouldn't know what to say
I'll just sleep all day
And fade into grey

If he touched you
What would I do?
I think I'd have to kill you too
Along with me
Why can't you see?
That this is such a perfect fucking tragedy

Oh sweetheart, oh sweetheart
Oh sweetheart, oh sweetheart
My lover, my lover, my lover
FUCK
FUCK
My lover, my lover, my lover
Lover, my lover, my lover
FUCK
FUCK
My lover, my lover, my lover
