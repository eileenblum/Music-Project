Been here before again and again
Seen it before I know how this ends
My heart than yours
It drips than it pours
Till it seeps into the wooden floors
But I adore the way it feels
To switch when I don't feel real
And I'll watch you suffer too
So don't feel bad for what you do

I've watched you stab away at my heart
And baby it's my favorite part
Make me feel miserable like you always do
Make me fall in love with you

Oh babe I'm just a little love drunk
But just enough to fill the space

Now it's your turn feel
What it's like to not be real
Don't worry babe just part of the deal

I don't need it anymore
Fuck yes I do
I need every little part of you
No wait, burn in hell
I have a secret to tell

Oh babe I'm just a little love drunk
But just enough to fill the space

Oh babe my heart feels so numb
So top me off just in case

My secrets this
Listen up it's not something to miss
I've been so fucked from the devil's pretty little kiss
Now it's your turn feel
What it's like to not be real
Don't worry babe just part of the deal

Rewind, rewind
Play it over again
Sing me a song about being dead
Rewind, rewind
It's your turn this time
Sing me a song about blood red wine

Oh babe I'm just a little love drunk
But just enough to fill the space

Oh babe my heart feels so numb
So top me off just in case
