You are not my sunshine
Not my sunshine
Not my sunshine, darling

You are not my sunshine
Not my sunshine
Not my sunshine, baby

You are not my sunshine
Not my sunshine
Not my sunshine, sweetheart

You are not my sunshine
Not my sunshine
Not my sunshine

Leave me in hell to burn
I told you it's finally my turn
Let the fire eat my skin
The depression always wins
So I'll smile and laugh
Until my mouth is bloody
I just wish I knew, how to connect with somebody

You're not my sunshine
Not my sunshine
You make me lose my mind every fucking day

You'll never know dear
How much I hate you
So please just stay the fuck away

The sun burns my skin (the sun burns my skin)
It makes me realise the darkness within
I think I'm sick because everything starts to spin
And you just watch me with a grin

You're not my sunshine
You're not my sunshine
You make me lose my mind every fucking day

You'll never know dear
How much I hate you
So please just stay the fuck away

Can you see me
Can you see me right here
Begging for you, begging for you
To disappear

So fuck this life
And fuck you too
Everything I've done has let me to what I'm gonna do

Gun in my hand
I can't fucking stand, it
I'm done I'm done I'm fucking done
[2x]

You're not my sunshine
You're not my sunshine
You make me lose my mind
Every fucking day

You'll never know dear
How much I hate you
So please just stay
The fuck away

Blegh

So stay the fuck away
