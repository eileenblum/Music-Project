Golden rays of the sun
They cannot go beyond
The river by the hill
Where the most black of madness reigns forevermore

I can see the pain that lives in there
Through the darkness I can see the tears
She still remembers that day

Looking down at her blood stained hands
Bathed in fear, couldn't live with the blame
And fear turns into rage

Her tender gaze is lost in nothingness
As I see her walking along the shore
And then the wolves begin to howl at the moon
When the evil stirs below

When the darkness arrives
She stares up to the skies
Weary eyes filled with hate
Final fury has begun, her sorrow's forgone

So across the night, cold and darkened cry
Broke the silence reaching up the sky
Deranged by her sons
Doomed to wander in the lonely dark
She's forsaken life, destroyed her heart
Forever walk alone

Her tender gaze is lost in nothingness
As I see her walking along the shore
And then the wolves begin to howl at the moon
When the evil stirs below

Screaming her fury to the four winds
Approaching in lonely darkness
And in the distance I hear her regrets
For the lives she has taken

Hay mis hijos
Hay mis hijos
Hay mis hijos

Her tender gaze is lost in nothingness
As I see her walking along the shore
And then the wolves begin to howl at the moon
When the evil stirs below
