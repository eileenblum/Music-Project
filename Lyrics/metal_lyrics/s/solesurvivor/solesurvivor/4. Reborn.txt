Sun went down at the sea of tears
Never-ending night
Bringing all our pain and fears
We sound our cry

Up above the clouds I'll fly away
Spread my wings again
I will follow the call of my heart
Signs will show, time to go
Be reborn

Back from the mountains high, over the sea
Our sacrifice is done, the painful deed
And while the light remains hope will go on
I've got to follow my own heart

Up above the clouds I'll fly away
Spread my wings again
I will follow the call of my heart
Signs will show, time to go
Be reborn
