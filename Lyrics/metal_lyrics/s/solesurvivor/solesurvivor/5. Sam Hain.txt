Time of warriors, seekers of fame and glory
Killing for fun I am the judge and jury
Kingdoms falling, power of the temptation
Growing stronger with each decapitation

I am trapped inside this hell
Speak the words and set me free

I am Sam Hain, bow down
You'll feel my pain unleashed

Once I am free I'll summon the dead
But I can't see you hiding in the masquerade
So lock your door and turn off the lights
I will strike fear in you, so don't forget my name
I'm Sam Hain

Five hundred years spent in the underworld
I'm waiting for the dead and their souls
Three sacrifices unlocks me from my prison
Three nights of death, the souls are rising

Blood has spilt upon this land
Resurrection is at hand

I am Sam Hain, bow down
You'll feel my pain unleashed

Once I am free I'll summon the dead
But I can't see you hiding in the masquerade
So lock your door and turn off the lights
I will strike fear in you, so don't forget my name
I'm Sam Hain

Thirty-first is now my night
Those before me will all die

I am Sam Hain, bow down
You'll feel my pain unleashed

Now that I'm free I've summoned the dead
But I can't see you hiding in the masquerade
So lock your door and turn off the lights
I have struck fear in you, you won't forget my name
I'm Sam Hain
