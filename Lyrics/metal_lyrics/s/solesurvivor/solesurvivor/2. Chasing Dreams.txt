Cold winter night looking deep in my soul
Evil ablaze scorching fields that we sow
Darkness surrounding all their secrets
Needs me to vanquish all their regrets

Chasing dreams throughout the night
I cannot see the way
Fate does not guide my life today

Pestilence spreads past the point of return
Only hope is you can save us from doom
One man was born to slay the dark lord
Throw down your scythe and pick up your sword

Time has come to choose your path
Stand up and set us free
Our lives depend on you to concede

Now at the end we are unwavering
Darkness moving fast from across the sea
Stand at the gates, looking deep in your soul
Battle looms ahead, only one can save us now
One can save us now

Now at the end we are unwavering
Darkness moving fast from across the sea
Stand at the gates, looking deep in your soul
Battle looms ahead, only one can save us now
One can save us now

Now at the end we will fight to the death
At the darkest hour he has come to save us
Heâs by our side, final hope, final ray
At the break of dawn
Light will lead our way to fate
