There's no way back, I'm going in.
Cold sweat running down my skin

Never felt like this before
But I am right, I have to kill the core.

I feel the cold steel in my hand
The sight is free from where I stand

Funny just how things can change.
From god to foe, come on let's rearrange.

[Chorus]
Time to die
Now your life's gone by.
Free our souls
Give back all you stole.

[Fisher:]
My mission is fulfilled
I'll die, but be living still.

I'll live eternally

[Chorus]
Time to die
Now your life's gone by.
Free our souls
Give back all you stole.

Die for me
Sleep eternally
Free our souls
Give back all you stole.
