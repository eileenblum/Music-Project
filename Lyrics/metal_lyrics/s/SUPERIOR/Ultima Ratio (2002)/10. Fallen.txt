Still feel you near
When your eyes are stabbin' me

No need to read the signs-
WonÂ´t foresee who I am

I made my choice
Officially now love is dead and gone
And threatening shadows dancin'
To guide me my way

One more time
We meet grace to die
Tonight we leave

And a million mysteries unfold
Their wings to demon skies
-When IÂ´m down-
To announce IÂ´m fallen
Million mysteries unleash
Their blackness in my head-
And IÂ´m down - and IÂ´m down...

WonÂ´t sail with you
On a dream now sunken deep away
Eternal flames of magic
Were frozen in their past

I lift my gaze
To a moving sky above me
And there I face my angels
Of doom once again

One more time
We meet grace to die
Tonight we end

[Eden-Ref:]
And right now your are here
And now you are down to follow

'Cause it's me
Who came down to take your ease,

(To) steal the beauty of your heart
Now IÂ´m here
And IÂ´m down to follow you
Right through heaven into hell-
Stole your love to kill myself
And IÂ´m down
Now IÂ´m down

[Fisher:]
"You and I-
A tale far behind us
The heaviest cross
I`ve ever made"

[Eden:]
"Here you sit
You`re breakinÂ´me slowly
To dance on a thin line
Along the ocean of your soul"

You`re inside,
Forever on my mind-
No reason to forsake you here,
To end before we start
But I will close my heart
My angels call again
And real is different don`t you know,
No place for love -
No chance for you and I

[Eden:]
You're inside,
You're on my mind
Without end

But I won't...
Just let them call
And I know the place where love is real

Turn away
Can't you stay
DonÂ´t you see
I'm not free
IÂ´m not free
Life is chaining me
Love is chaining me

Leave my life
How can I leave
DonÂ´t come back
I'll never
Fly away
Not to fall down with me
Cause you fall down with me
