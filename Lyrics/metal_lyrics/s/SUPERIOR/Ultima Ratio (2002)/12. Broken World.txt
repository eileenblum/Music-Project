How could I have been so blind
I had no doubts, standing at his side

Seems I woke up from a dream,
Opened my eyes; with a vengeance I scream
Out the feelings I left behind.

[Chorus]
Here I stand
Nothing in my hands
World just broke apart
Divided by my heart.

He's the master, playing god
And he's the leader, without failure but

I can't stand this anymore,
Have to leave him, have to stop this before
All the madness is killing me

[Chorus]
Here I stand,
(With) Nothing in my hands,
(My) world just broke apart
Divided by my heart.

Now I flee
Everyone I see
Noone left to trust
Have to leave the past behind me

I have to stop him, I have to find a way out.
Nobody's with me, how can I make it alone, to survive,
And when no one believes me that he's insane.
