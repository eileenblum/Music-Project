Alone in the night I'm walking along the street.
The poise of my mind is drowned by the rain.
My hopes and my dreams, my visions are far away.
My angels of doom, I flee them in vain.

If I could repeat my life, Lord, I'd choose another way.
I'd decently spend my time, grateful workin' every day.

[Chorus]
Save me, heal me from madness
Please, guide your lost sheep. Show me the right way, rescue me

I've wasted so many years, they will never come again.
Took chances but won just tears. I was called a gambler then.

Hey boy, so don't you know, life's not fair so please stop crying.
Easy come easy go - those 4 words are your destiny.
Just drift that's your domain.

Aimless, drifting along.
Saves you, heals you forever, so never loose faith never ever again.

Alone in the night I'm drifting along the street.
The boat called "My mind" did not hit the ground.
My hopes and my dreams still haven't abandoned me.
Dear angels of doom, why don't you go down?

[Chorus]
Save me heal me from madness
Please guide your lost sheep. Show me the right way, rescue me!

Save me heal me from madness
Please guide your lost sheep. Show me the right way.
I'll never loose faith never ever again.
