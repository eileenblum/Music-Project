Exciting news
WeÂ´re talk of the town, my friend
It seems like the seed is beginning to grow

CanÂ´t get it yet
They all start to spread the word
We have to make sure we keep hold of the steer

[Bridge:]
If we make it right, we can unhinge the world
All the fools will pay us devotion
Now, we must jump at the chance
Silently press the button, turn the key

[Chorus:]
Reach for reign! Now it is in sight
Soon, I know, we will have a ball, collect more souls
Reach for reign! Now the time has come
Who will dare keep the chosen back? We take the world!

Showtime is near
IÂ´m ready to spread the word
And messing around with those blockheads is fun

Soon on TV
Presenting the new Messiah
The credulous masses will get a great show
