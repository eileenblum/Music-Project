Nothing's real,
All around me died.

And I feel
All I've tried to leave behind

How can you dare
Binding me with your stare
And now silently
Screaming I'm
Losing
My mind.

Will you break
All the chains 'round my heart

'N set me free,
Let me find another start

Are you my fate?
Can you open the gate,
Straight to Eden
To keep me
Forever alive.

But I know
(I) have to leave you tomorrow
All the feelings we share are in vain
And our tears will flow like rain
But I know
I'll still love you tomorrow
And until the end of days
'Til I die.

Come with me,
Let us share this precious night.

Want to be
For a lifetime at your side.

Show me the way.
Chase the dark clouds away
Feel the magic
Around us,
And let us be free

'Cause I know
(I) have to leave you tomorrow
All the feelings we share are in vain
And our tears will flow like rain
But I know
I'll still love you tomorrow
And I'll have to hide the scars
In my soul
