Welcome tonight
This is my show
Tell me your questions and I'll let you know

Spotlight is set
Right to my place
So everyone in the world sees my face

I am prepared
To spread my will,
To give the people out there a new thrill

You ask me how
I dare to call
Myself the godlike redeemer for all

Is it pretence?
A big pack of lies?
The wolf in sheep's clothing, appearing too nice?

Frankly I am
Only a tool
Fixing diseases of people like you

Are you afraid
Of my visions,
That I give them a reason for change?

Do you feel
Lost and shaky?
Don't you know

[Chorus:]
IÂ´m the unwanted
IÂ´m your fear
DonÂ´t deny it!

I am a thorn
In rotten flesh
Of rotten values


I am the light,
I am the word
I am the cure for the sick in this world

How can you say,
I do you wrong
If I'm the only one here who is strong.

Look at yourself!
What is your job?
You're only dazzling the eyes of the mob.

Are you afraid
Of my visions,
That I give them a reason for change?

Do you feel
Lost and shaky?
Don't you know

[Chorus:]
IÂ´m the unwanted
IÂ´m your fear
DonÂ´t deny it!

I am a thorn
In rotten flesh
Of rotten values

I am the virus
In your blood
Inside your system

You call me enemy
But I
Am your redemption
