We all meet here today
Cause we have to make new plans.

And what pushed us so far
Leads us into defense now

And if we look at our lives -
We just became tools of our leader.

And if we see what we've done -
Then we mixed up freedom with madness

Hear me
Call for resistance
Our time has come and
See me
Cry for deliverance
We have to stop this...

As we followed his will
We were blinded by gainings

No more love, no more joy,
It's like living in vain now.

Now we must stop the disease!
I know we can make it together.

We have the power my friends
Cause we are the last hope for freedom

Hear me
Call for resistance
This is our last chance
See me
Cry for deliverance
It's not too late so

[Chorus:]
Wake up now
Wake up here
Show your pain
Show your resistance

You're not blind!
See what's real!
Leave him now!
He is no god for you!

[Conversation:]
[Person 1:]
I understand, but what can we do? His influence is growing day by day!

[Person 2:]
It's dangerous to think differently than him! We have to consider that!

[Person 3:]
Whatever we do, we will attract his wrath.

[Person 4:]
I don't know how we could stop him. What should we do?!

[Kerioth:]
There is only one way. KILL HIM!

Not willing to die in my sorrow-
I will not live in vain
ItÂ´s more than a gate for tomorrow
It is our last chance

[Chorus:]
Wake up now
Wake up here
Show you're strong
Show your resistance

You're not blind!
See what's on!
Leave him now!
He is no god for you!

There will be no god, all might comes from you!
