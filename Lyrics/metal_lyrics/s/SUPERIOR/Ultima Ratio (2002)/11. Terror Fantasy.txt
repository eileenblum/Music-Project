I feel like I am falling
Down a waterfall of pain.
And all the useless feelings
They are coming back to me again.

My life became so easy.
I've been bathing in success.
But now these days are over,
And I'm living deep inside in a mess.

But I'll teach you
What it means to
Dare to question
All that I do.

I am stronger,
I've the power
To destroy your will,
To make you believe cause you're

[Chorus:]
Blinded by your fantasy
That's building a wall between you and me.
You don't know what's good for you,
So listen to me, what I say!

All the creepy things I'm hiding
Are the mirrors of my grief.
But to you I'm always shining
'Cause I want you to believe in me

So come to me and listen
To my sermon while you stay.
You will never lead, you follow!
And still it is me to whom you pray!

Cause I'll teach you
What it means to
Keep belief in
All that I do

You'll be stronger
You've the power
To spread all my will
To tell all the fools that they're

[Chorus:]
Blinded by their fantasy
That's buildinÂ´ a wall between them and me
You will save their darkened souls
If you go and tell them what's right my friend.

Blinded are their foolish minds
So tell them there is something else to find
Never leave the path I show
Cause I will find you and you'll pay for the rest of your life.

Can you teach me
What it means to
Live in peace and
Do things you do.

All the feelings
I have to hide
Sting my broken heart.

But the torture
Gives me power
To go further
To be with you

And then my pain
Will be your pain,
Will be your distress
Then your life's a mess
And I will tell you that you're

[Chorus:]
Blinded by your fantasy
That's building a wall between you and me.
You don't know what's good for you,
So listen to me, what I say my friend.

Blinded are your foolish minds
I tell you there is something else to find!
Never leave the path I show
Cause I will find you and then you will pay!

And your pain
Is my gain
And my dream
Makes you scream

And my way
Is your way,
Is what rules your life my friend.
