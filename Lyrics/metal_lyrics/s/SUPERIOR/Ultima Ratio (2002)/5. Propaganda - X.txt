I came to you
To save your souls
To reveal to you-
Truth of fear and pain
And maybe tonight
Release will come to you

I am the one
Who`ll take the load
Away from your bones
And I proclaim now:

[Chorus:]
Never fear your lives again
Cause I always will be
With you - now and eternally
DonÂ´t you dare to hesitate -
WeÂ´ll defy this world!

I am your will
So come with me
And donÂ´t waste your passion
DonÂ´t waste energy!

What brings you pain
Is unrequited love
(So) focus (your) dreams on me -
Then I will bless you!

[Chorus:]
Never fear your lives again
Cause I always will be
With you now and eternally
DonÂ´t you dare to hesitate
WeÂ´ll defy this world

You wonÂ´t try to find the answer
When there is no single question left
Never let your soul be wounded
DonÂ´t you give no mercy to your fear

You donÂ´t hate if you donÂ´t suffer
You donÂ´t cry if you donÂ´t love no more
You wonÂ´t starve `cause hateÂ´s just poisoned love
And this is all my lesson,
My compassion, my word - my doctrine
