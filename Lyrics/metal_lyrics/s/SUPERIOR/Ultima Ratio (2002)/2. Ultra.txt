Here I am
To give you welfare
To bring you grace

YouÂ´re my seed
And you are my blood
You`re sacred to me

Love you want
And peace you need -
This is not your way!

I donÂ´t want
To smell tomorrowÂ´s
Darkness again

[Pre-chorus:]
They are doomed in disaster
If you believe in me -
Now go, destroy their world for me

[Chorus:]
Wherever you go - IÂ´m always around you
Whenever you cry - IÂ´ll always be there
Whatever you fear - IÂ´ll always protect you
Wherever you are - IÂ´m always with you -
Rely on me!

You and I -
In perfect union
WeÂ´ll take their fight

I donÂ´t care
If fateÂ´s against me
As justice is mine

DonÂ´t bind your hearts
With chains of beauty
When pleasure`s pain

Time is hot
For revolution-
For victory!

[Pre-chorus:]
And still their demons
Try to surround us
And still theyÂ´re howling-
ItÂ´s time to spread the word of war!

And donÂ´t bind your hearts with their chains of beauty
Because too much pleasure just causes you pain
Resisting their values means war against violence
And you are my army of wisdom and truth
