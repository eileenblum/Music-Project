Right now, right here
I feel it clear
Rubicon is near and tempting

Scanning the crowd
You're standing out
Imagine we are kindred souls

Welcome my friend
Come, take my hand
Join me on my trip to heaven

Just you and I
Give it a try
And play the game of games

Maybe you know, people sleep away
CanÂ´t see the foe, the sin to rule their day
So, if you know how to wash their brain
Then you should go and cleanse it of its pain - do it just for gain.

Just look around
ArenÂ´t they all bound
By the curse of mindless urges

Sex, love and hate
Determine their fate
And jealousy, the self-made grief

Emotional mess
Poor mawkishness
Feelings are the scourge of mankind

Kerry, my dear
LetÂ´s scream out of here
Time to heal the world.

Maybe you know, we are born that way
CanÂ´t see the foe, the sin to rule our day
So, if you know how to wash their brain
Then you should go and cleanse it of its pain - do it just for gain

Feelings make you helpless
Feelings cause you pain - Be free!

For the love of gain
