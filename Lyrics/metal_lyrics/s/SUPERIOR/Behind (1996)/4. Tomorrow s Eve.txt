Where are you now,
Where time chokes on madness
The truth is gone, a lie became real
You play the clown but people still trust you
The end is near and your grin fades away

Where is the light
(There's no light in these days of grey)
Where are you now, what do you feel,
There are you now, can't hide,
No wall of your lies.
Now you'll pay - No escape
Pay forever - and ever - and now
Hear the silence all around you.
Even your time has come.

The world is blind,
Just millions of phrases
Smile is hate, and features cheat
Your suit decays
But your mob still adores you
Your scummy slime, it fills human brains

They talk and talk till it's too late
With foolish words that veil our fate
But we shout with joy 'til the eve of life
Today is past, tomorrow's now.
Dream 'til the end and fear the row.
So what - Keep smilin' with your crazy faith
