Undeserved pain,
People proclaim,
"All will be good some day"
Try to forget,
Cease to regret,
Hide all my fears away.

Turn out the light,
Restart the fight
Inside my head again.
Can't I bring it to an end?

And here comes back reality.
Pushing my hopes away.
Leave the dream,
The dream of true security
And break down the same old way.

Don't use your brain,
Why go insane?
The truth ain't kind.
Live in a lie
Are we all too young to die?

Confess my sins,
Treatment begins,
The cross coming down on me.
Have to repent,
Father has sent angels.
Now evil flees.

Now back at home
TV has shown pictures of lies and war.
Father tell me, what's this for?

Can't you tell, tell me please!!
What's it for?
