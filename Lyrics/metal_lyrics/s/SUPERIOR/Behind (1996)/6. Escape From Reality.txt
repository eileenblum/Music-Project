Paralyzed brains
And anemic eyes that stare
At pictures so real
The visual banquet's near

There's no doubt: You taste it, you see it,
For the first time in your life
You hold the key to unknown pleasure.

Surrender and escape
And feed your mindless view
Submit your will To unknown dreams
-How pretty your life turns out
-No more recurring doubts.
And unholy thoughts on your mind-
Are left in the past

A world made for you
Superior life at last.
The cyberworld turns into real life
No more tears In a soulless land -
Your unknown world of pleasure.

The game is played so welcome back to reality.
But you won't see the difference any longer.
Did your will kill the fictions or did they kill you.
Don't mind - at least for a moment life's been your own.

The past... Past for you. A world made for you.
