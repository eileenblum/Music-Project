I can't fall asleep.
My visions make me cry
I ask myself.
Why am I here
Left in despair - no light
And there's no change

Why do we love
Right at the start and then -
We end in hate
Why do we have
Way enough food for all
But we don't share

Why does the sun end up in rain
Why does the shadow fall into the light.
And why is god out there
Where are his leading hands.

Why do we trust a godless church
Laughing at those who really seem to care.
And why is god out there
But no leading hands

Why am I here Can't close my eyes
Questions without answers to find.
Why am I here - lost in my fear
And no saving walls behind.
Why am I here
Can't close my eyes
Why am I here
Lost in my fear
Where is the healing hand
Embracing me and giving me the answers that I need.

Why am I here
Can't close my eyes.
Questions without answers to find.
Restless mind
Not willing to surrender
Never find solutions comprimised
It's just an endless game

[Whisper:] "When will I close my eyes"

Tell me ways to find Give me peace of mind.
Tell me ways to find Call me now!
Close my eyes!
