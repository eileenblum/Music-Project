Brand-new pictures, quite the best we've ever done.
We were glad to get your call
Soon we'll head out to find you.
We'll make you famous right before you die

It's sensational.
Blood is running everywhere
Pictures filled with agony
Scream your last words now.

It's your chance,
We'll be there
Don't you dare to die alone
The show begins to send your own farewell.

Many people come tonight.
Staring at your famous face of pain.
Waiting for your final heartbeat
Tell them your impressions now.
How does man feel right before his end?
You don't have to act, just be yourself.

Let your howling fans freak out!
Make them feel superior
It's reality.
They possess you for a while
Like a picture on the wall.
Be their mirror now!

A million people pay tonight
Staring at your face of death
And I'm waiting for my cash my friend.
Tell you my impressions now.
This is not the end, it's quite a show.
Good for me is bad for you, that's life.

With a legal drug we call:

I possess you for all time
I'm the dealer, you are mine-
