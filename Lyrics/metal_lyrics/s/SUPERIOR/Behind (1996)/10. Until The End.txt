When I hear your whisper
(Then) my stomach turns into a heavy wall
My head is like an empty hole.

When I see you smiling
Flames of sadness burn me down.
(And) you can hear me cryin'
'Til the end of time.
'Trust in you and trust in me'
Just empty phrases falling -- down.

If I just could hate you.
If I just could make you cry like you have done
To me, so cold, so merciless.
I can't even find out
How to throw my thoughts away.
'Cause I just can't forget your face
When you turned away.
My mind is bleeding. Eternal fate.

Rain until the end of time
And no more reason to believe
In you and me - A killing tale.
Forever gone. It's over.

Waiting at my window.
Looking at myself to watch how thoughts can eat
A mindless soul away from you.
Not that I would miss you.
You're with me much more than all the time
Before you left me
And still your words are haunting me.
Too fast for me to comprehend - this fatal change
