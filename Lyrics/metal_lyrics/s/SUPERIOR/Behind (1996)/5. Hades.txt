Here comes your brand-new feeling
Life turns round.
Dark confusion kills your thoughts
And break you down.

There he lies in peace
Folded hands
His skin is grey and pale
So here it ends

There's just another heart to break
Another tear to cry
No one can help you in these days
When the ticking of the clock has passed you by.

When it's time to share out
True face shows.
Greed is turning inside out,
And friend to foe.

There he lies in peace
His name on stone
Grief's forgotten now
They sold his soul

There is just noones heart to break
No single tear to cry
You've got to help yourself these days
When the help that you have prayed for is denied
