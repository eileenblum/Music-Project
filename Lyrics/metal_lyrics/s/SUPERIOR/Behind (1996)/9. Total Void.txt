Switching on the lies,
Flickering the truth now dies.
Taking what they can,
Does not matter where we stand.

Listen to them, hear them say:
"Pay, then bad times go away!".
Don't believe, don't close your eyes!
Don't give another sacrifice.

Inside me shadows are veiling my mind.
(My) hope in the future will vanish behind
TOTAL VOID; CHIME IN HATE

Nothing new today,
Places change but pictures stay.
All signs point toward storm,
But still another lie is born.

Can't you see it, are you blind?
There's no good sense left to find.
Powers allocated wrong.
Men are weak and money's strong.

We're under "thoughts-control",
Don't see the pictures lie.
Open your mind to see what's going on
