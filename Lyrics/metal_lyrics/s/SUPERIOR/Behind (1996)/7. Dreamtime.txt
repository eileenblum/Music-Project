Let your worries fall away.
Turn off your mind and calm down inside
Now feel all the pictures you see...

Can't remember yesterday.
All I really know is the fear I felt inside.
And no hand to lead me through life

Look around Victim's found
Take it out on her

Why don't we have time for dreaming?
Restless live - A prophecy?
When sometimes I wake up screaming
Will my fears survive when I fall asleep again?

Fall asleep
Won't you dream with me - dream with me
Share this dream with me
