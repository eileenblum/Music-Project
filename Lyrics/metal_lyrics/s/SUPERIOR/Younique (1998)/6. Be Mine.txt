Such a beautiful feeling
Being by your side
On a summer evening
In the golden light
Of the sun that's leaving
And starts to hide
From a starry night

Hold me closely and make me stay
Lay your heart down next to me
All my worries are blown away
When I know you stand by me
All I've ever been longing for
Can be reached so easily
And so all I will ever be asking you for
Is to let your heart - let your heart be mine

Still a beautiful feeling
Being by your side
When the darkness is leaving
For the morning light
Comes shining bright

Hold me closely and make me stay
Share another day with me
All my troubles are washed away
When I know you're next to me
And so all I will ever be asking you for
Is to let your heart - Be mine

Hold me closely and make me stay
Tell me sweet things silently
Let me take your heart away
Say that you're a part of me
All my sorrows are far away
When you're holding on to me
All the obstacles in the way
Can be passed by easily
And so all I will ever be asking you for
Is to let your heart - let your heart be mine
