You just don't like
You just can't stand
I guess you maybe
Just can't stand yourself

Don't need your well meant orders
Don't need your sweet control
Don't need your compromises
I don't need you to make
My mind up for me and to
Speak for me cause you
Can't even speak for yourself

Who do you think you are and who am I
To follow all your rules and why would I care
Not with me

Try to change me
Waste your time
Waste your whatever
As long as you're not wasting mine

I sure don't need nobody
To teach me right from wrong
And I sure do not need you
If you want me to
Change my own personality.
