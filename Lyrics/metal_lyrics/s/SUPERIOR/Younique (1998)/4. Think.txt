I present your new life
Polished blank and clean
Now you can forget the one you've been

Be the first example
For perfect surgery
The brain-controlled messiah that we need

No more rusty dreams inside
Your stainless world
The mind-remote-control is your best friend

Switching off emotions
You're acting pretty cool
Powered by the calm-reaction-tool

24-Bit Love-protection
Coolness guaranteed
Shyness is the least that you will need

Television useless
Guess what you will get!
Now you can receive the pictures

Inside your head

Thoughtomatic
Silicon magic
Download your dreams to the fool-check-link

Brain-Dump arises
Scanning your crises
Are you able to think?

Nightmare turns to lightmare
Sleepless nights are gone
Nothing will disturb you having fun

Contact to your best friends?
No problem anymore
That's what the phone device is for

Solar plates deliver
All the energy you need
Just a little chip you have to feed

Scientists are working on
The only bug it's got
They've got to keep you cold inside 'cause
This chip gets hot!
