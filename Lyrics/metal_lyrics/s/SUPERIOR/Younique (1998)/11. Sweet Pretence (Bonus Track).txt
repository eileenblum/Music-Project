Leave your mind to hear
Me proclaim that Eden's near

Follow my commands
They will save your soul

Your hell is your devotion
My pleasure's your demand
For big illusions
Your call for true pretence

Leave your mind to see
My sermon on the mount
Follow my doctrine
It heals you it heals me

Another town another tale
Another miracle for sale
Delirious you worship
When soon I start to preach

Business is calling me
My market value's high
Pay fast I have to leave
God bless you

Another town means another tale
Another miracle for sale
The rabble's quite delirious
My pleasure trip goes on and on

Blindness you want me to heal
But I can't heal the world
I never did I never will
I only deal in piece of mind
