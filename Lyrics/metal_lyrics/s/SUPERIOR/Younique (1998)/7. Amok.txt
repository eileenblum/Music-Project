Sleepless I am walking through the lonely streets tonight
I can't await the sunset when the town becomes alive
My hell will be your hell you will pay me back with your pain

You'll have to face it soon
There's nothing you can do
The pain inside your heart
Will tear you apart

And now you have this path to follow
Turning your life around
You'll have a bitter pill to swallow
I'll bring you down

Now that I have shown you all the power in my hand
Your tears have quenched my thirst but what I can't understand:
There is no satisfaction just the need to hide away from you

I'll have to face it soon
There's nothing I can do
The guilt inside my heart
Will tear me apart

And now I have this path to follow
Turning my life around
I'll have a bitter pill to swallow
You'll bring me down
