And I stare into the past of my burning dreams I watched my life crumble before my eyes
As I sift through the ashes of my past I cry tears of regret stain my face
To live again to set right my wrongs
To live again would just be another flaming dream

It seems like it was yesterday we first embraced seems like yesterday we were one
I cannot break away from the past I cannot accept this as done
To live again to set right my wrongs
To live again would just be another flaming dream

And I stare into the flames of my burning dreams I watched my life crumble before my eyes
I'm forced to live with what I've done but move on I would rather die 
To live again to set right my wrongs
To live again would just be another flaming dream
