I'm sorry, for what had happened I'm sorry, for the way I am
I apologize, for this I apologize
I hate myself, for what made you leave I hate myself, for being me
I'm sorry, I love you I'm sorry.

I don't know how I'll live
How I'll go on day to day, without your face
I don't know how I'll live
I'll see you later, and kiss you goodnight no I won't
I miss your face, I miss your smile I miss you so much
