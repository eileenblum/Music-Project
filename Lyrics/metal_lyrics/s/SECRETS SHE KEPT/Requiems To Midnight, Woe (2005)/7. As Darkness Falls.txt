All this beauty in the world I would love to smash it I hate you all I hate you all
Darkness falls like an ebony veil over the pale face of the moon black wings of night wrap the world in dark embrace
Midnight, so beautiful, amongst the funeral mounds love laid to rest with a final graven kiss
So cold her pale skin so cold beneath the sand so cold death

All this beauty in the world, lay stagnant beneath the sand I lay to sleep our tears, and forever bury your face
The cold wind blows memory through out the night I hear her voice call, remembering bliss
So cold her pale kiss so cold amongst the leaves so cold death

All this beauty in the world and I have smashed it and I hate you all and I hate you all
Sadness creeps this ebony night, beneath the howling moon our loves laid to rest by the razors bloody kiss
Midnight, in darkness, we lay as one together forever, be still our beating hearts
So cold our hearts so cold our deaths
