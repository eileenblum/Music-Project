Condemn to hell and suffer in the abyss they've forged
Wither in eternal chaos engulfed in the flames of torment and hate
The seas boil, and the skies fall
The dead rise and rivers run red

All's black beneath the shattered sun tortured screams echo the land
Armageddon comes and cleans the earth of it's human filth all's black
The seas boil, and the skies fall
The dead rise and rivers run red

War and flame where Christ cannot save damnation all spirits dead
War and pain all God's children lost you've brought this yourselves
The seas boil, and the skies fall
The dead rise and rivers run red
