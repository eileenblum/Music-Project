[To Death, Embraced]

I have died today my body cold and dead
With empty, open eyes I stare into the void the eternal numb of unconsciousness
I have died, gone from the world a shadow of myself, a shell of me
Sinking into the black, I disappear and erase the memory of me good riddance

How I longed for an end to this needlessly suffering life
To the countless numbers I hate I'm better off this way
Left to the dark left to the black I'm better off this way
I'm left to the dark I'm left to the black

[A Bid Farewell]

I sit alone, in a pool of fears I lay in the darkness of my mind
Alone I stare, dry of tears as I slowly drain away
A red cloud is my sight my death clouds my sight
A red of anger, and fear, and pain In disgust I sit along the blade of death as I slowly fade away

I sit alone in a pool of fears as I lay in the darkness of my mind alone I stare as I slowly pass away
Cold, the cold sets in as the memories of life arise
I swallow joy, over disgust for the world and gladly great my demise
I sit and fade away cold and alone I fade away
