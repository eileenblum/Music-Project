every day that I breathe the breath of life
I face the hate, the pain, the strife
that invade my mind - and try to close my eyes.
enmity surrounds me - bitterness and animosity.
but that's not what I want to be - and it fills my heart with grief.
I can feel it in the air around us - a sense of hopelessness.
the truth is hidden in the mess - and the youth are getting restless.
I know that this world will fade - despite the words I have to say.
but I can't just look away - or watch it all decay.
the anger's there, the hatred's there, but when I look into your eyes,
it's more in sorrow, than in anger, that I raise my voice.
sorrow, because I can't make your choice for you.
your respect is not enough for me - to sit silently.
the things I say, I mean - it's not about what you think of me.
it's not enough for me to die - just knowing that I tried.
I don't want to see your life - destroyed by countless lies.
I won't stand by - and watch you die.
the anger's there, the hatred's there,
the anger's there, the hatred's there, but when I look into your eyes,
it's more in sorrow, than in anger, that I raise my voice.
sorrow, because I can't make your choice for you.
