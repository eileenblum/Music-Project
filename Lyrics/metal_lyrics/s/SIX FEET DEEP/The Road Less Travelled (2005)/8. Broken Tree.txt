maybe the limbs of a broken tree will heal themselves in time
or maybe the limbs from that broken tree will petrify......
hard as stone.
as I peel back the layers I find things I never knew were there
and as I listen to my prayers I hear myself confused and scared.
this broken tree feels like it's part of me somehow controlling
my destiny.
has the seed of a broken promise decided what I will be?
and I, left to myself can only hope to survive.
and I, left to myself can only slowly die.
how long will I drift? would I not know the difference?
have I weathered so long that I've been shaped by this ocean?
will the legacy live on in me? like father, like son?
I don't believe that what I am is determined by what
precedes me.
and now I have to realize that the past is not my future
and in Christ I'm a brand new creature.
and I, left to myself can only hope to survive.
and I, left to myself can only slowly die.
but given grace I know I can,
given grace I can learn to forgive.
in the face of all of this.
given grace I can truly live.
