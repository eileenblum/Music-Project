What once burned so violent in your heart.
Is now a cold, hard, distant, calloused part of you.
What you embrace is what you become.
And I can see in your face the things you used to run from.
So much to belong to, so much to pursue
So much to consume, so much to consume you
You will get burned, when you touch a flame
I guess you've learned that from the pain.
Are you so bold as to think that you can go on this way?
All alone in a world that left you cold.
As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another
Brother to brother, if you lose your grip.
And as air is to a fire, so we will be to each other
One to another, if I start to slip.
What once burned so violent in your heart.
Is now a cold, hard, distant, calloused part of you.
What you embrace is what you become.
And I can see in your face the things you used to run from.
Are you so bold as to think that you can go on this way?
All alone in a world that left you cold.
