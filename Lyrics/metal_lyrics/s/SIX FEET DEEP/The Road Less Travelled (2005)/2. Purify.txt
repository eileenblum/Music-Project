Pull the wool from my eyes, sensitize me.
Cut the cancer from inside, purify me.
Send your cleansing rain, saturate me.
Burn away this pain, drench and drain me.
Placed beneath this still sky
Only reflecting it's pale blue
So imperfect in contrast
And yet we continue to do the things we do.
Set ablaze this garden
Ignited by sulfurous pride
Cauterized creation
When will we feel the burning inside?
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down.
Set ablaze this garden

Pull the wool from my eyes, sensitize me.
Cut the cancer from inside, purify me.
Send your cleansing rain, saturate me.
Burn away this pain, drench and drain me.
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down.
