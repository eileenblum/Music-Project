It seems the harder I try, the farther I fall when I fail.
And the farther I fall, the harder it is to... get back on my feet again.
Punish myself trying to please you
Trying to establish worth in your eyes
When nothing you do is of value
But yet it costs you your lives.
You put on your mask of contentment to cover the shame on your face
You push me toward shining achievement but my God has called me to clay.
Your success is meaningless
You're so proud yet it's a symbol of your shame.
Your excess is meaningless
And you expect me to follow you into the flames.
Your way, I'm constantly reaching
For something you want me to be
So you can take pride in your system
And cash in on this American dream.
You said be all that I can be
Find the truth inside of me
But all I found was a withered seed
Humanity.
Your success is meaningless you're so proud
Yet it's a symbol of your shame.
Your excess is meaningless
And you expect me to follow you into the flames.
Most of what you live for, means nothing to me
There's nothing you would die for, and that saddens me
The blood on your hands makes me sick
And the reasons you give are meaningless.
What I am to gain, to go your way is worthless
Only to attain all your pain and lack of purpose
You put on your mask of contentment
To cover the shame on your face
And you push me toward shining achievement
But my God has called me today.
