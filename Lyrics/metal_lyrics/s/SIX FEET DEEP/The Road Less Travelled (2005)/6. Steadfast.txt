The world is constantly shifting,
Shifting through ideals gone past.
Stretching it's so called moral boundaries,
I'm counting the days
'til it's finally over at last.
I won't accept your change,
I'll pull against your ways.
It bleeds my mind - but for what it's worth - I left it all behind.
Nothing is sacred - nothing seems real.
In this world of confusion - nothing is steadfast.
Truth is ever eternal, regardless of you
Truth, despite human frailty, is absolute.
Mankind is barely existing - drifting through life aimlessly.
Clinging to countless carnal securities
But how long can we go on in this stale conformity.
So desensitized - broken down by lies.
It all bleeds my mind - but for what it's worth - I left it all behind.
Despite all this chaos - despite all the lies.
In the face of confusion - my God is steadfast.
Truth is ever eternal, regardless of you,
Truth, despite human frailty, is absolute.
All I remember is broken promises
And the remains of every day... pain.
Nihilistic state of mind - is what I've left behind.
And now I've come to find
The way, the truth, the life, along The Road Less Traveled.
And the words that ring true, "I will never leave nor forsake you"...
steadfast.
