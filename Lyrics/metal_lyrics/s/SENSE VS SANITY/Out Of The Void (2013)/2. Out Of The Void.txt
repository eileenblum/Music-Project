[feat. Richard Sjunnesson]Itâs time to turn the page,
Iâve waited far too long.
I have to stop this train of thought.
Although pressure is, still remaining strong,
I will resist, I will not fall.

Iâll find my way out of here,
I will break out of my fears,
Its there without a doubt.
Iâll fight to get myself out!

Crawling (climbing the walls I am)
Falling (but that doesnât keep me from)
Climbing (wonât stop till Iâve found)
My way out of the void

Plagued by painful memories, a darker soul designed
The shadows growing bigger still,
Time and its effects, they werenât on my side,
As the last part of life was like hell.

It doesnât take that much,
To get into the void,
One slides into the deep end,
And looses grip on all,
When gathering the pieces,
Of a timeframe broken down,
It has to recollect itself,
Time is neither friend or enemy nowâ¦

Internal persuasion, it lies under my skin,
Now is the time to overcome
I call upon my strength, my power from within,
To destroy that what I had become.
