Within the smoke, I appeared
A blank look upon my face
Wadering through the world I see
Not leaving any trance...
So just leave me unborn!
It seems to suit you well...
In the sidelines I'm still here
But can you even tell?!
Left out in the rain 

Another face in the crowd...
...As I try to scream
No sound will come out!
One with the faceless mob
One with the unseen...
Filling empty spaces
...So replaceable!
With all the mirrors now smashed
There's no reflection to see...
Used up and disregarded
A disposable being!

Lying!
On my back I still feel the impact!
Dying!
So often, I have been stabbed
Well, you can have your knife back!!!
It's purpose has been served
Used up and useless once again!
...Found my place at the curb
Where bleeding out's a fitting end!
A cardboard cut-out man
I'll cry acid rain tears...
Struggling to keep warm
Beneath a blanket of my fears!

Every time I open up 
And let somebody inside my heart...
...They slither in like vile snakes 
And pull it all apart!
Behold my outstretched hand 
A mess of broken bones...
...Will serve as a reminder to
Leave well enough alone!

Left out in the rain 
Another face in the crowd...
...As I try to scream
No sound will come out!
One with the faceless mob
One with the unseen...
Filling empty spaces
...So replaceable!
With all the mirrors now smashed
There's no reflection to see...
Used up and disregarded
A disposable being!
With all the mirrors now smashed
There's no reflection to see...
Used up and disregarded
A disposable being!

With all the mirrors now smashed
There's no reflection to see...
Used up and disregarded
A disposable being!
With all the mirrors now smashed
There's no reflection to see...
Used up and disregarded
A disposable being!
With all the mirrors now smashed
There's no reflection to see...
Used up and disregarded
A disposable being!
With all the mirrors now smashed
There's no reflection to see...
Used up and disregarded
A disposable being!
