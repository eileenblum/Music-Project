[performed by Sorcier des Glaces]"That beautiful but savage landscape
Will be my grave for eternity"

Long is the path towards infinity
Eternal is my hate against humanity

Come to life - to defy death
Crushing the world from beyond
And through pain and despair you will live
But proud and tall you will reign

A tower made of skulls and black blood
Giving sorrow to the land of mortals
An alliance doomed by the spirit of fear
On the horned one that is the key
To the gateways of supremacy

Dread dreams of ancient times
A palace of frost between two worlds
I reign supreme on your poor lives
Spitting the blood of religious souls
A blasphemous ritual with the twilight

Into the fire
Dare the knife
Seeing death
Through my smile
And through pain and despair you will live
But proud and tall you will reign
Under the sign of the northern moon

My frozen blade stained with blood
Of millions corpses
The unholy path to immortality opens
I am the rebirth of evil
I am the fear of men
I am the wizard of ices

A tower made of skulls and black blood
Giving sorrow to the land of mortals
An alliance doomed by the spirit of fear
Of the horned one that is the key
To the gateways of supremacy

Dread dreams of ancient times
A palace of frost between two worlds
I reign supreme on your poor lives
Spitting the blood of religious souls
A blasphemous ritual with the twilight

The unholy path to immortality opens
I am the rebirth of evil
I am the fear of men
I am the wizard of ices
