[performed by Sorcier des Glaces]Ages ago
When the earth was pure
And no heaven
There was a sign of hope
There was a symbol of strength
In our eyes, in our souls
To preserve the dream of purity
Now fall into the abyss of oblivion

Behold the sunset...

The light of Christ ruined millions of lives
In an hypocrite smile of destruction
Now take revenge and kill with wrath
Burn down their temples
Through infinite darkness
And through the eyes of a dying sun
In the land of ice

Behold the sunset...
