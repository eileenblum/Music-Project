Beyond the skies
Of a nordic obscurity
Surrounding the palace of earth
Is the shining of the northern moon
Proud to light, this ethereal night

The wind enchant my eerie quest
To become a dense veil hiding the stars
I sojourn in revenrence to dear Mother Nature
In the total obscurity of the forest

Grim is the threshold
At the horizon
No plagues cannot even see me
As I am the Warlock of Ices
And I am (ready) to bewitch the world with darkness
I will continue my travel within the realm
To gain the supremacy of night
