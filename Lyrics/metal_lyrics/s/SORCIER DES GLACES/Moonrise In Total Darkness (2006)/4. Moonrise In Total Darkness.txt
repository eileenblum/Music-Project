Whirlwinds very far
From beyond the mountains
(To) welcome the grim phantomatic
Moonrise in total darkness

Into the deep enchanted woods
I behold nature's dark majesty
Prevailing in my northland
Everywhere I hear the howlings of the wolves

The quintessence of my frozen wisdom
Following me in the chasm deep in the forest
I am as old as the snow-crowned mountains around

I am the puressence of misanthropy
Behold the ethereal nightfall
Into the deep echanted woods...

A moonrise in total darkness
