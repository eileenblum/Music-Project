Landscape of nocturnal darkness
Prepare the fall of men
Beautiful armageddon to come
Venomous claws of nature's fury

Dark misanthropic souls
We will win against mankind
Fall of men

Filthy creatures of shame
You will die a thousand deaths
Suffer you will, by nature's fury
Go away from my northern kingdom
My immortal spirit will haunt you forever

Dark misanthropic souls
We will win against mankind
Fall of men
