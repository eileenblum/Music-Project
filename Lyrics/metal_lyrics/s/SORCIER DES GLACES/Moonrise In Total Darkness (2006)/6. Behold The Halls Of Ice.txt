Icy dreams of the north
Haunting by (the) shadows of the night's hunger
To behold the halls of ice
Very far from human creations
With the splendour of night reflections

Lo... my kingdom of ice
The puressence of nature
Lost in the forgotten times

Drown in winter's blood
My heart was forged in the underworld
I flew from beyond the forest
To reign for eternity

Vast halls of the icy world awaits
The rising of the north
