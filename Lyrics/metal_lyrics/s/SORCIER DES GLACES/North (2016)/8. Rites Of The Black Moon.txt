In a time where madness reigns
All you hear is lamentations in the air
Awaiting the nocturnal winds of despair
And the return of the King

Under the moonlight and in the eternal shadows
I drowned you to the mysteries of the Other Side
In the forest of the damned you see the eyes of Belial
And the black curse of humans is at the gates
We can feel the fury of thousand pains
Diabolic hate is now in the northern atmosphere
A strong smell of rotting flesh...
We're all awaiting the return

Rites of the Black Moon

A new race of misanthropic shadows
Born in Hell's fire and raised in the night
Darken the whole land with their sombre shades

Emptiness fills their heart and their temples
No more beliefs for a dead God and light
Now the law is the saw

The past is alive
Hear the truth about the Creation and corruption
Turn your back to the pathetic and feeble souls
And this hypocrite void of nothingness

And the tribes of the moon come back
The return of darkness over the world
And the tombs are all open
To welcome the next century of doom
Through the eyes of Belial

Rites of the Black Moon
