A cold wind of grief
Carries our tormented souls
In a land where darkness rises
In a land where the dawn comes in black
In the North, in the kingdom of eternal frost

Nightmarish sunless sky
Infinite frozen grounds
Majestic mountains
Cause we're far, far from the light of day
In the frozen North...

The coldest breeze of the night
Pierces our lifeless bodies
The snow covers all the fires of life
And the north wind blows all the hope to another desire
In the North, in the kingdom of eternal frost

Somber twilight of hopelessness
Fills the dark landscape

Infinite frozen grounds
Majestic mountains
Cause we're far, far from the light of day
In the frozen North...
