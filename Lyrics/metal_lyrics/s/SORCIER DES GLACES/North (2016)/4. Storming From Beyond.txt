Hate from beyond
The Other Side is calling your name
There is no more God
In the Northland

Humans are lost
Their lies and beliefs are raped
In their own blood and in the darkest corners
When the last rays of the sun died long ago
The terrible truth remained
It was the fall of Man

The storm has just begun

Enter the palace of death
A realm far in the mountains
Dreaming eyes of treason
Haunting their lost souls in silence

And despair...
Through their grievance

Shining from beyond
The Other Side is calling your name
There is no more God
In the Northland

Humans are lost
Their lies and beliefs are raped
In their own blood and in the darkest corners
When the last rays of the sun died long ago
The terrible truth remained
It was the fall of Man

The storm has just begun
