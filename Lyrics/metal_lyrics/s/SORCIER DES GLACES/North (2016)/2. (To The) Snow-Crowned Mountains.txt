Demonic fog through the pathways
Draping the world in black sorrow
Dream of the universe that shall darken
And behold a kingdom asleep
Hear the trumpets of damnation
Beyond the frozen trees...
To the snow-crowned mountains
Where hope left thousand years ago
Le froid et la nuit ont immortalisÃ©s le temps

Wolves eating the remains of the last city
The moon shines the tombs of the Ancient Ones
A sight of what happened long ago
And come back to this eternal slumber

The dark past won't be forgotten
As the morningstar rises
Now observe the nature's fury
Prey for your death

And haunting through the unholy dream
Breathing through the corpse of the Antichrist
I see the fog appearing again
Swallowing the last vision of devastation
