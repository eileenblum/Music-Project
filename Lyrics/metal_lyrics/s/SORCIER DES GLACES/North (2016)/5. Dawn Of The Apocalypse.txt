When the dawn of flames took over the sunset
We all knew it was the beginning of the End
Everything was burnt, even waters of the world
It was an infinite descent into the abyss

The Beast was watching us...

All colours turned to red
The sight of the apocalypse
Our skin was torn and burnt to ashes
And eaten by the fury of Unholy One
We trembled at the feet of the vast landscape
Beholding the new moon that lit the last vision

Beside the howling winds of devastation
And the fog over that terrible scenery
That covered the new world
Plagued by the angels of death
We felt the true side of Evil

The devil was calling our names one by one
Then we became the new breath of the undead
Immortal I had become, and Creator of that new world
That was given to us

The Beast was watching us...

After the apocalypse came the frost
So cold that even the souls could not reach
No more humans were living
They were the banned race
Forests were growing again
And towers were built to observe
A dark place now pure from mankind
