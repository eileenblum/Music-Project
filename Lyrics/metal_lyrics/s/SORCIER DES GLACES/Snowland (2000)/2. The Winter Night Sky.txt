The Dark Moon shines the Night sky
In this Forest of Mystic Desolate Trees
And Snow falls upon the Heart of Time
Only Northern Darkness to be seen from the Throne (of the Night)
With Warlocks and Demons throughout the Deep Sombre Woods
Coming with Sorcery and Witchcraft

...And the Cold winds blow in Frozen Fury
Fog covered the Landscape of No Hope
Wolves Guard the Winter Forest's Spirit

Frost filling the Cold Void with Silence
Through the Ebony Sky of Winter
I form the Black Circle with each Beasts of the Earth
I Summon the Eternal Soul of the Essence
To Fight with Swords and Spells
I am One with the North ...
