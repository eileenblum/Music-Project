From the Night of Cold Winter Shadows
In the Kingdom of Pure Northern Desolation
Throughout Primitive Forests, up in the Mountain Frost
Light faded once again for the Twilight Moon

My Travels are Endless Through the Dark Ages
Through the Glacial Northern Hills
Through the Crystal Covered Trees
And Dwelling In Eternal Dark Caves

Only Pure Northern Desolation all over the Land
Frozen Nature and Solitude of Ancient Times
The Full moon is High in the Black Sky
Reflecting the Proud Landscape of Medieval North

I am into the Heart of Time
Beholding the Ice Castle of this Majestic Realm
Triumphantly Awakening the Snows
For the Forthcoming Storm
