Into the realm of winter
I became the one who defies infinity
An immortal soul damned by the hate for Everything
That is human inside

Through the silence of death
And with a strong wish for a total damnation
I will not let them survive the forthcoming storm

Follow me to the land far beyond the forest
Into the realm where religions never existed
I will drag your mortal soul to the deepest pits of hell
You will never escape

Through the silence of death
And with a strong wish for a total damnation
I will not let them survive the forthcoming storm

Bien au delÃ¡ des rÃ©ves et des mensonges
Surgira la vÃ©rilÃ©
Sans I'hypocrisie des hommes et de leurs idÃ©aux
Du nÃ©ant soudainement nait une Ã¡me pure et puissante

Follow me to the land far beyond the forest
Into the realm where religions never existed
I will drag your mortal soul to the deepest pits of hell
You will never escape

Into the realm of winter...
