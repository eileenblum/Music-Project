Deeper... Colder
Through the whirlwind of ice and thunder
The storm will never end
You will not survive one more night
From despair to oblivon
From human to emptiness
From light into darkness
The puressence of primitive forests

Now forgotten in a void of sorrow
Of hate and misanthropy
That coldest light will tear you apart
All life ends

Innocence has failed
One more time
Lost in a sea of ashes
A dark soul in hell's domain
Trying to escape under the line of fire
There is no more place on earth for them
Only thorns to pierce their memories
Frost to be their last vision

...Eternal winter...

No pity will never come
All  the sins that were made
Will never be forgiven
A sombre destiny for those who looked at the sun
Now die in honour to save the last dream
(A new dawn of northern supremacy)

From despair to oblivion
From human to emptiness
From light into darkness
Tue puressence of primitive forests
