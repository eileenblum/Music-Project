Dare to find peace...
In the shadows from the oldest tower
Purgatory for human souls
As I wander through the night of torments
Chasing for a piece of human flesh
Under the sign of the pentagram
I light the black flame
And mark the world of mortals with my scythe

The undead awaits your soul
From the deepest pits of hell

Rites of destruction
Through carnage and blood
I will remain the one who stand tall
Crushing the throne of heaven

I will remain silent and cold as ice
To hunt and kill again in morbid visions

Convert all dream to nightmares
Turn all waters into blood
Curse all Virgins to become whores
And drink the poison of hell

No more traces of christian blood
Up to the mountains of sorrow
Cleaning all heaven from goodness
The rites of the ancient times begin

Dare to find peace...

I will remain silent and cold as ice
To hunt and kill again in morbid visions
I light the black flame...
And mark the world of mortals with my scythe
The undead awaits your soul
From the deepest pits of hell

Dare to find peace...
