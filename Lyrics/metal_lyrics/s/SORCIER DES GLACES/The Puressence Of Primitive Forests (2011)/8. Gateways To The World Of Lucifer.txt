At the dawn of rebellion
The eternal light-bearer awaits
Devilish dream of terror
Riding the deserts of the moon
Filling hearts with black blood
Killing everyone who still believe
In the false way of creating
Defying every human being

Armageddon is coming
The plague of the angels
A wind of doom and supremacy
Making the holy corpses burning
Freezing souls to ice
Leading the way to the great Lucifer
The strongest of all
(Now) In his dominion of pride and strength
The most couragous of all
His life is eternal

Beholding the dark face of the earth 
One could see the fog from the trees
That's the end of an era
A new dawn in northern landscapes
The only heat is hellfire
Burning brighter and brighter
In my heart, in my thoughts
I hate humans for what they've done

At the dawn of rebellion
The eternal light-bearer awaits
Devilish dream of terror
Riding the deserts of the moon
Filling hearts with black blood
Killing everyone who still believe
Leading the way to the great Lucifer
In his domain of pride and strength
