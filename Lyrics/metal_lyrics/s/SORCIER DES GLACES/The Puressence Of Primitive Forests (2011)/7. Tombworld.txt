As I walk among corpses and frozen shadows
A smell of death everywhere through the land
Strong wish for this tombworld to rise
A nocturnal vision of desolation

Be proud to be the last one to live
In mortal form, with a black soul of vengeance
Behold the uncreation
A landscape cold as the coldest winter night

Evilness prevails...

With tombs made of human flesh
Spirits are doomed by the evil one
Wandering beyond the gate of slumber
Cursed to serve for their holy sins

Evilness prevails...

Empty eyes of torment
Feeding the wolves of hell
Enter the void
Where you will have your grave
As I walk through the night
As I kll for my own pleasure
My hunger is still unsatisfiedd
Enter the void
Where you will have your grave

With tombs made of human flesh
Spirits are doomed by the evil one
Wandering beyond the gate of slumber
Cursed to serve for their holy sins

...Glory to the horned one
Fro the palace of illusions
