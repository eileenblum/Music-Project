A monuent of hate and anger
Once lived in the shadows
A cohort ready to conquer this world
To defy the rules of humanity

From the ashes of an ideal
Without the pain from thousands blades
Hiding in the forest of nightmares
They became the rise of the undead

Dreams like fire
Burns Bright in the northern sky
An old weapon created
To venge the secrets of the moon
Dark places surrounded by evil forces
Turn the whole world in shadows
Pale faces around the soulless tombs
Rotting around the pathway...

Servants for the king of winters
And through the sight of a nocturnal vengeance
Dark Candles burn during the ritual

In an infinite descent to hell
A desolate void of emptiness
Fills their souls with remorse and pain

Supreme army from the north
Now reign over the madness created
Without trends, without gods
Just pure damnation incarnated

Light the torches of evilness
Build the towers of darkness
Open up the gate to the underworld
Unleash the wrath within
