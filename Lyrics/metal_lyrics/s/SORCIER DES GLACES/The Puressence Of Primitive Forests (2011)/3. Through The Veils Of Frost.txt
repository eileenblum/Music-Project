Through the veils of frost
Frozen trees everywhere
It seems like nature never leaved the ancient times

Through the veils of frost
For moons I've been traveling in silence
Haunting in the dream of old

Through the veils of frost
For hundred years I've been waiting
That it would come to an end

Through the veils of frost
The progress of disguised goodness
Is no more in their civilized world of mockery

In profound darkness
One by one, they will serve my cruel orders
Through their ears and through their hearts of stone
Through their soulless existence
Awaken to crush mortal spirits
Spreading black plague to their pitiful life
In this land, only death is real
Damned for their lack of truth
With pride I walk on the path
Way home in the forest
And I will reach the crown of Winters
I am eternal

Through the veils of frost
Frozen trees everywhere
It seems like nature never leaved the ancient times

Through the veils of frost
An immortal vision of eternity
Lying under the moonlight
