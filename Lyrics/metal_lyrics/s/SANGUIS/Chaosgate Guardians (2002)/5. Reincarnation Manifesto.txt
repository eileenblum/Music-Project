Um den See der letzten Wahrheit tanzten sie, bewegt vom Wind
Die Nacht war kÃhl, die Erde nass, Dunkelheit Ãberall
Und als die Finsternis Ãber sie kam, konnten sie erkennen - Warum ...
... In der DÃmonen Angesicht - Tausend Jahre Schmerzen

I am the immortal night, who eternity glory gives, honour and sacrifice to me as a cosmic creation
Ride upon a sulphur wind, Let us feast in carnation, as we pass the seven gates into purgatory blasphemy
Baptized by unholy fire, Worshipping guts and spitting blood,Listen to the serpents voice, Transform into a demon is your only choice
Possessed by demons endlessly, Summoned by midnight everytime, Guided by pitch-black rays, be the master of a wicked race

Follow me into hell and back, be unchained - conquer your chosen fate
Spawn breaks out of the womb, honour the crimson garden
Follow me into your grave and back, be a hunter - a fallen soul
Out of the dark into infernal fire - Reincarnation manifesto

A childlike vision of a better mourning, whispers me a dimension of urban death
Death is near
You will see to die in hell is your destiny

Left hand masterplan, Fullfilled by living nightmares, Ultimate reincarnation, Through pain to their salvation
Stimulated by their fear, The troops of fire shall rise, Torn the heavenly hordes , till the last days morns
A black ground where flies slain, their corpses lay - vomit on them, necrophic lust reaction as a perfect creation
Let hate be your energy, vengeance in your mind again, United with Satan in body and soul, don't beware of loosing control
