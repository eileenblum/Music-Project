Banished is the trail to Karnstein manor
Legendary malice in the twilight halls
An Eminent grace is yelling in filth
Grief was reborn on some styrian hills

Into the unlight of a new days dawn

Mine is the nightly requiem while enduring the burden
Kissing the bloody nocturnal shroud - Eternity is within me
Carmilla appears on the merlon - a malefic aura
Magical powers force unite - enriching her paramours

Her voice mesmerizes me at the northern drawbridge
Drifting into a world below a weeping nightmares crypt
Adoring the distant splendor enthralled by arcane stones
The towers devours my soul as I reach the point between
Death and oblivion

Follow the traces into the serpents light

The prophecy fulfilled in her embrace a ghastly silhouette
Petrified by welkin rhymes denying every single creed
Woe is my innermost creation - a perfect maze within
The chants of the baptized are haunting me at the night

Her voice mesmerizes me at the northern drawbridge
Drifting into a world below a weeping nightmares crypt
Adoring the distant splendor enthralled by arcane stones
The towers devours my soul as I reach the point between
Resurrection and Immortality

I was reborn as a part of december
Twilight prophecies are lamenting me
Fading memories - my unknown desires
Mortal Art of blood created in me
Enchanted by the celestial whore
Descending into an erotic radiation
Pretending sanity - my misery
Dancing in a kind of strange revelry
