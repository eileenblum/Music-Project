Is she real or am I mad
Is it just a dream of bad
Have my eyes an iron will
Upon the grave she dances still

I saw in her eyes
Blood mixed with purest white
But wisdom is shining through
Emotionless and dead but full of life
Cold breaths out of frosted lungs
Unknown where her life is given from
Is she my angel of mourning
To tell me I am the chosen one

On these damned fields
The beauty of the she-corpse
Bless my heart with joy
I am the chosen one
And this nocturnal graveyard
Is our dawnfull pantheon

Is she real or am I mad
Is it just a dream of bad
Have my eyes an iron will
Upon the grave she dances still
Travelling slowly in my mind
To corrupt my senses bright
I can hear her sweetest voice
Its only silence without noise

I saw in her eyes
Now I know whats behind my existance
But is she just a ghost or a dream
Fatally touched by the shining stars
And a black souls abyss within
Bless me with mystery of chaos
Dancing in a crimson unlight
A vision with morbid sex appeal
