Catharsis - free my soul - burn them - release me
Cleanse my innermost darkness - before they become to strong
Fire of purity - burn them - release me
Bring back my glorious times - I cannot fall!

Strange and mysterious - they tear my soul apart
Like demons raging endlessly in my helpless heart
They have to vanish before they can bring me down
The fire of Catharsis shall assure me my black crown

The fire of Catharsis shall burn!

Set me free - my power will rule again
Set me free - forever shall I reign!
Set me free - my power will rule again
Set me free - forever shall I reign!

Catharsis - forceful weapon - crush them - release me
Give me the power to cast them out
Destroyer of unworthy - crush them - release me
Again I will be the one to be victorious in this fight

Once and for all - I will drive them away
Time has come - I am ready for the fray
No remorse and no regrets - finally released
I am god - the feelings at last have ceased!

The fire of Catharsis shall burn!

I am free - my power will rule again
I am free - forever shall I reign!
I am free - my power will rule again
I am free - forever shall I reign!
