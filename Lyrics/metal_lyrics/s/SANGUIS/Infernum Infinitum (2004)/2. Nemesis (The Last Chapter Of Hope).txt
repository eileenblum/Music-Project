A raging storm of bitterness and despair
A painful wound that lies so deep
Furious hate - the only pleasure left
Curse upon the herd of sheep called Man!
Meaningless and empty is their existence
They are a waste of precious flesh and blood

Feeble and weak is their hope for release
Blinded by pitiful belief they are
Not able to recognize the quintessence of life - 
A vicious circle of grief and pain
There is no refuge beyond to flee to
All you have is this vale of tears

Prayers for redemption are in vain
None will save you from your fears
You will have to understand
That your end is soon to come
Forget the heavens above
Vanity is your destiny

They will have to meet their nemesis
And I will lead them into oblivion
They will have to meet their nemesis
Now you see that death is the end

The sword of Damocles always hung over your heads
But - with ignorance - you chose to deny
The last chapter of hope now ended
You see what you were praying for
There is no heaven - There is no damnation
Punishment is the final award

Feeble and weak was their hope for release
Blinded by pitiful belief they were
Not able to recognize the quintessence of life - 
Death is the ultimate end

They will have to meet their nemesis
And I will lead them into oblivion
They will have to meet their nemesis
Now you see that death is the end!
