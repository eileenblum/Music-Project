Strange being veiled in mystery
A sneaking, dancing shade of black
Surrounded by an aura of purest cold
Tempting yet perilous is thy call
Insidious spell - seduction of death
I am trapped - I am thy prey

Thy serpent-kiss is poisoning me
Serpent temptation - my end to be
Thy serpent-kiss infects my veins
Vanity despair - oh! Lustful pains!

My helplessness is thy pleasure
My despair is thy joy
I am just one among many
Victims of your merciless hunt

The fruit of Eve
The original sin

I am drawn into your deadly trap
The beauty of sweet pain forever
Suffocate me wonderful - damned - creature!
Break my will so I become thine 
Insidious spell - seduction of death
I am trapped - I am thy prey

Thy serpent-kiss is poisoning me
Serpent temptation - my end to be
Thy serpent-kiss infects my veins
Vanity, despair - just hate remains!

To long have I suffered from thy evil game
I will escape thy macabre spell
Or I will take you fucking pestilence
With me into my cold and rotten grave

The fruit of Eve
The original sin
