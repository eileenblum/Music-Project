No longer will I take this shame
No longer will I close my eyes
I tolerated you long enough
Horde of blind and foolish worms
Decadence and ruin are your highest values
May hate and revenge become mine!
The ultimate blasphemy you have become
I no longer accept your existence 

Fear my vengeance little sheep
I will wipe you from this earth
My anger lies so deep
A fatal error was your birth!

The defilement of my creation 
Is all you have ever achieved
But don't forget who gave you life
And offered you sweet paradise
For I am the beginning - And I will be the end!
Plague to you all - my little fellows
I already have waited to long

You shall fear my vengeance!

Revenge!

To fucking blind to see
Not able to think for your own
Your prayers only increase my rage
I won't listen to them anymore
You don't deserve life
Useless and vain creation
An experiment that failed
But your disgrace is mine!

Fear my vengeance little sheep
I shall wipe you from this earth
My anger lies so deep
A fatal error was your birth
