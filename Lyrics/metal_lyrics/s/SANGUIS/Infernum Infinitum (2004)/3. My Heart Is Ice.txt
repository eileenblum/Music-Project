I see despair in your eyes
I feel your pitiful fear
This makes my little game
Even more heinous and delightful
Take all I can give you
It will be your sweet end

Seduction will bring you to this end
For your weakness you'll have to repent
My heart is ice!
For my heart is ice!
Blinded by your own feeble hope
With torment now you'll have to cope
My heart is ice!
For my heart is ice!

Feel the pain!
Enjoy the pain!
For  it will haunt you for evermore
Try to flee!
To become free
I am delighted by your death throes

 Temptation - that is what you seek
Fulfilment - is what you will get
Fulfilment of my needs
Obscuring of your thoughts
Suffocation of your will
Subjugation of your mind 

Feel the pain!
Enjoy the pain!
For  it will haunt you for evermore
Try to flee!
To become free
I am delighted by your death throes

You are a victim of your foolishness
The perfect prey for me
I will enjoy this little game
As long as it may last

Seduction brought you to this end
Now it is too late to repent
My heart is ice!
For my heart is ice!
I wallow in your grief
I loved to do you mischief
My heart is ice!
For my heart is ice!

Feel the pain!
Enjoy the pain!
For  it will haunt you for evermore
Try to flee!
To become free
I am delighted by your death throes
