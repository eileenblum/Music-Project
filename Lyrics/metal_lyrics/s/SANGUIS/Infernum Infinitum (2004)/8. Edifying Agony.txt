Unrestrained craving for obvious failure
A welcome thorn in the side
Suffering as chosen fate
A permanent companion to be
The inevitable decline of self 
A wonderful scourge of despair

This agonising helplessness
Edifying for eternity
Prometheus - lead my way
For agony it may be

The absolute need for grief
As driving force within
Destructive striving for more
Self-destruction divine
Total blindness for redemption
That lies before thee

This agonising helplessness
Edifying for eternity
Prometheus - lead my way
For agony it may be

Pain stands before insight
Obsessions darken the  mind
Deliverance is a thorny gift
But its splendour is release
The flesh is a slave to the mind
Boundaries overthrown
The bonds of suppression
Must fall once and for all

This agonising helplessness
Shaming for eternity
Prometheus - away from me
For agony it won't be
