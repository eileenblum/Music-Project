ITâS ALL FAKE, FOR ALL I CARE
THEY CAN ALL GO DOWN, burn IN HELL
THE SAME FILTH ALL OVER US
FOR SO MANY YEARS

WEâVE FORGOTTEN US
WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE WERE
WHO WE WANTED us TO BE
And WHO WEâLL NEVER BE

BLACK SOULS

I SEE THE DAWNING of
A NEW ERA
I SEE THE LIGHT OF
A brand new world

SEE MYSELF DWELLING
INTO THE ABYSS
AND IT HAS LOOKED BACK
IT HAS LOOKED BACK AT ME

BLACK SOULS

I haVE SUFFERED ALL YOU WANTED
MY TRANSFORMATION IS COMPLETE
And MY WISH FOR BLOOD
WILL SET ME FREE

And now my soul just fades away
