Empty Gods in thrones of Blood
Shallow graves our thoughts collide
Fake Heavens, Fake Hells
Weâre already dead my friend

Thereâs no hand of God
Thereâs no touch of evil
Itâs only us against ourselves
In a world where death is life

FAR AWAY FROM HERE IS MY PLACE
NOW I MADE MY CHOICE
I WANNA MAKE PEACE WITH MYSELF
AND ON SHOULDERS MADE OF CLARITY REST MY HEAD

I feel but canât see you
My sickness, that I knew you
Not ending, just pretending
Too senseless to feel you

See them sitting in the thrones of Blood
This was drained from our own lives
Fake Prophets in disguise
Spreading fear in our lives

Empty Gods in thrones of Blood
They lie, donât take their hand
Fake Heavens, Fake Hells
And we live in empty cells
