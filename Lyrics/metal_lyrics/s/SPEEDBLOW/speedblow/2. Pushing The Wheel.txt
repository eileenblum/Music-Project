I HAVE BEEN PUSHING THIS WHEEL FOR SO LONG
SINCE I WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM MY HOME

THROUGHOUT THE HEAT AND THE COLD
AMONG THESE BEASTS I GOT STRONG
BUT NOW THE DAYS GROW SHORT
I SEE THEM BIRDS AS THEY CRAWL

THEY ARE COMING FOR ME

VULTURES â MINDLESS â KILLERS - SOULESS
VULTURES â HUNGRY â EVIL - ENDLESS

THE YEARS ARE PASSING ME BY SOON IâLL DIE
THEREâS NO ESCAPING FOR ME FROM THIS LIFE

THROUGHOUT THE HEAT AND THE COLD
AMONG THESE BEAST I GOT STRONG
BUT NOW THE DAYS GROW SHORT
I SEE THEM BIRDS AS THEY CRAWL

THEY ARE COMING FOR ME

PUSHING - SMASHING â CRACKING - DESTROYING
MY CHAINS â UNLOCKING â FREEDOM â IS MINE
