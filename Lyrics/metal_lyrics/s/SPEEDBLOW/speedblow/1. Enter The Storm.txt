THERE IS NO SOUL INSIDE THIS BODY
THERE IS NO BLOOD INSIDE MY VEINS
THERE IS NO SPARK INSIDE MY EYES
THERE ARE NO DREAMS INSIDE MY HEAD

AND I WAS MEANT TO BE ALONE
TO BE THE ONE TO TAKE THE FALL

NO SPARK INSIDE MY EYES
NO DREAMS INSIDE MY HEAD
NO SPARK INSIDE MY EYES, NO SPARK

THEREâS NO LIGHT AT THE END OF MY TUNEL
THEREâS NO SORROW FOR MY PAIN
THERE ARE NO PRAYERS FOR ANY GOD OF MINE
THERE IS NO BOTTOM TO THIS PIT

NO SPARK INSIDE MY EYES
NO DREAMS INSIDE MY HEAD
NO SPARK INSIDE MY EYES, NO SPARK
