This heart stopped beating, 
I canât feel it running through my veins, I can feel it 
Your love is a torture and it will always be, remember 
Through darkest skies 
Loneliness is blocking my own path to redemption 
Through darkest thoughts 
I'll bring my sorrow to an end 

The fire is still inside 
Your words have never been a promise 
Empty frames, itâs like you've never been here 
I'm leaving from your poisonous love 

My face has vanished, I can see an empty soul 
In the mirrorâs reflection 
An empty cell, what Iâve become 
Thatâs what Iâll always be 
Forever, forever 
Through darkest skies, 
loneliness is blocking my own path to redemption 
Through darkest thoughts 
I'll bring my sorrow to an end 

The fire is still inside 
Your words have never been a promise 
Empty frames, itâs like you've never been here 
I'm leaving from your poisonous love
