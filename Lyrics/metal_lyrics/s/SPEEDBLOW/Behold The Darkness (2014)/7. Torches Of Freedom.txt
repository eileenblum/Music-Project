Falseness has grown 
Blinding witnesses and taking control 
Your sacrifice, a sadistic performance is on 
Run from the madness 
This obsession feels like home 
Destroy your weakness, you must never stop 

Kings, men who have sold their souls 
Gods, invented by men in need 
Slaves, we become when we stop to care 
Freedom, in this word you shall find life 

Black Knights of vengeance 
are haunting you down 
Youâll burn at the stake 
theyâll burn down your house 
You have to fight 
You stand your ground and reclaim whatâs yours 
Rise from the ashes 
torches of freedom are yours to hold 

Kings, men who have sold their souls 
Gods, invented by men in need 
Slaves, we become when we stop to care 
Freedom, in this word you shall find life
