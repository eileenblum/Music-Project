Dreaming is the only path that feels free 
Walking into an endless timeline 
Justify my cruel intention 
Broken oath is to remember 
Breathing and my wounds are starting to heal 
Promise eternal hate upon your sight 
Screaming as my faith is starting to bleed 
Disobedience upon your light and your grace 

War in Heaven, a battle sent me to Earth 
Darkness slipped into my cold soul 
I lost my wings, as a Fallen Angel returned 
The sky opened and they dragged me to Hell 
I'll rise again, Heavenâs Gates are wide open for me 

Bleeding what is left in me, my curse is gone 
No masters, no surrogates 
Disallow everything you said 
Thinking and my senses starting to kneel 
An evil alliance is upon you 
Addicted to war 
Disobedience upon your flesh and your blood 

War in Heaven, a battle sent me to Earth 
Darkness slipped into my cold soul 
I lost my wings, as a Fallen Angel returned 
The sky opened and they dragged me to Hell 
I'll rise again, Heavenâs Gates are wide open for me
