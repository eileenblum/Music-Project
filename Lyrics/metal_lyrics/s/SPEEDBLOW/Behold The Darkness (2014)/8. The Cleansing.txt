Horrendous moments dwelling in our mind 
Theyâre not kind 
Trample upon the pure things that we used to carry 
Participate from screens that fade away, far away 
Realizing what Iâve become, what you have made 

Tones of anger is the gift you left me 
Broken arrows pierced to walls that are falling apart 
Burn the scrolls that I used to read 
To alternate dreams while I sleep 
Cross my fingers and hope to watch your feelings 
To get torn apart 

Evil deeds that went unpunished all these years 
Blue lakes that turned into dark swamps overnight 
Unworthy we were found and were exiled from the light 
In the shadows I dwell, I have no trust in human life 

Tones of anger is the gift you left me 
broken arrows pierced to walls that are falling apart 
Burn the scrolls that I used to read 
To alternate dreams while I sleep 
Cross my fingers and hope to watch your feelings 
To get torn apart 

Tones of anger is the gift you left me 
broken arrows pierced to walls that are falling apart
