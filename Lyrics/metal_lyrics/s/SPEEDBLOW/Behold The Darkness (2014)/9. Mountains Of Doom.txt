I will ride tonight on the mountains of doom 
Darkness surrounds my path, Iâve lost my way 
I howl at the moon 
Iâm waiting for the Wolves to lead me on 
In the cold of the Night, in the Moonlight, I smile 

May the Breeze of the North now carry me Home 
Let them see my trail, like a fire in the sky 

I feel them around me 
Their eyes pierce right through me 
There are spells that surround me 
These spells now bound me 
My forest is burning 
And the Witch is not yearning 
I call on the winds 
Theyâre the ones that can save me 

May the Breeze of the North now carry me Home 
Let them see my trail, like a fire in the sky
