Deadly voices screaming 
They canât take the pain 
Forces from Hell unleash their rage 
To recruit His flames 

Demons 

They come from below to enter this world 
They come from beneath to conquer the field 
The battle is over 
Mist forms around and now it feels like home 

The blood of thousands streaming 
Into the abyss 
Mighty trees guarding the Gates 
Of an eternal grave 

They come from below to enter this world 
They come from beneath to conquer the field 
The battle is over 
Mist forms around and now it feels like home
