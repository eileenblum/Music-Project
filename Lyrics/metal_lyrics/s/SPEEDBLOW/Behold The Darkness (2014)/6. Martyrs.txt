Reign with swords and fear 
Unbound colonialism to take control 
Torches are burning down houses 
Doomed all the innocent to stay away 

Martyrs are burning up on the altar again 
Driven and driven misdirected by faith 
Slaughtered like sheep for the pleasure of gods 

Run to the barracks, burn down the enemyâs shield 
Dedicate this win to our pride 

Fighting for posthumous fame 
An endless circle will end 

Bound to a life as a slave 
Giving your blood if you fail to pay 
Never fall into the silence 
Save yourself, Never obey 

Martyrs are burning up on the altar again 
Driven and driven misdirected by faith 
Slaughtered like sheep for the pleasure of gods 

Run to the barracks, burn down the enemyâs shield 
Dedicate this win to our pride 

Fighting for posthumous fame 
An endless circle will end
