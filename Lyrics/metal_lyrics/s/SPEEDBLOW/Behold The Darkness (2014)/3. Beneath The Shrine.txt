Meld my lungs to keep on breathing 
There's no Savior for me 
Try to reach the sky beneath this shrine 
Flawless warriors weigh down 
Asking nothing but death 
Clouds are marching sorrowful again 

Earth is cracking, nothing brings me down 
Wind is patching the wounds of our kind 
Mountains crawling, sky is falling down 
Wind is patching the wounds of our kind 

Broken mast this ship is sinking 
There's no time for greed 
All the pain inside is passing by 
Everything I wished for 
Now its time to rise 

Earth is cracking, nothing brings me down 
Wind is patching the wounds of our kind 
Mountains crawling, sky is falling down 
Wind is patching the wounds of our kind
