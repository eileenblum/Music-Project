Thereâs no sign of remorse, thereâs no sign that theyâre going to stop
You tried to look the other way, but they will keep coming out of the cave
And itâs going out of hand; which feels you rage
And itâs going out of hand; I see them making way, coming straight for you

Theyâre heading straight for you
no matter what you do
And there is no more time for saving yourself
They will reside in you; they will mess with your head
And you will end up to be hating yourself

This is all going to get worse
there is no reason so donât try to talk
You have the taste in your mouth
You think youâre strong but you know itâs all fake
Itâs still going out of hand; you think youâre free
you think youâre safe
But you are drowning in remorse; you feed the beast with all your hate
