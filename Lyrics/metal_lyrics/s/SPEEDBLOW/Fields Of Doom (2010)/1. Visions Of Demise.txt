So cold, so dark, this lonely place
It bends my mind; it numbs my senses and my soul
And now Iâve lost my will to live
Since thereâs no happy ending in my book

Iâve drunk myself till I felt dead
My heart then stopped, it turned to stone
Thereâs something there, I see it in my haze
I try to reach for it but it moves away

It is inside the stories of our lives
In books of sorrow, my visions of demise
