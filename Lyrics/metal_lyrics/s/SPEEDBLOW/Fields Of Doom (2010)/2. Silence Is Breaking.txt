Doubt is in your mind, darkness in your thoughts
Searching deep inside, searching in your soul

The truth can set you free; it hides in your dreams
Love will ease your pain, but you have never known her name

Youâll wander off in vain; theyâll help you clear your way
You know, you feel itâs safe and then all meaning blows away

Silence is breaking and I keep on fading

Doubt is in your mind, darkness in your thoughts
Searching deep inside, searching in your soul

Sometimes the dark transforms into a spark of light
Sometimes the light sinks into the dark
