Iâm sick of your depression, your insecurity
Ainât drinking no more sorrow, ainât smoking no more pain
You say I should feel lucky, you say I cannot see
When all inside is aching, when all I hurt is meâ¦.and Iâmâ¦

Iâm gonna take you inside, Iâm gonna take you through hell for a ride

The moon is always high, the sun will never rise
I donât believe in stories, invented to misguide
The moon will stay up high, my sun will never shine
And now I have it me, Iâll leave you all behind

Iâm gonna leave you behind and let the wolves devour your kind
