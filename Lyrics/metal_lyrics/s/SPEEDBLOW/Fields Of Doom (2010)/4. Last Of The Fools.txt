Missing something inside, living with no disguise
Giving away so much but it looks like you still finish last

Feeling always alone, thinking there is no hope
Knowing all that surrounds me is false and Iâve been on this road far too long

I am the last one; I am the last of the fools

Keeping fear in my soul, struggling with the unknown
Falling out of your orb and youâre already so far from home

Drowning; so many thoughts, watching heaven come down
Feeling betrayed by man and thereâs nothing that can be done
