Every time I do this I use no anesthetic
And every time I feel it I recognize it is my hate
I keep on bending on feelings and I just keep on feeling the heat
A big rush conquers my spirit and it fills up every inch of my head

Drug it out of my head, spit it right out

Cruise amongst the mindfields searching inside my wicked thoughts
Thatâs murder of my worries and I donât feel any regrets
Lonesome as I am feeling and fearful as best friendâs death
I take it all right in me and spit it, throw it right out of my head.
