Iâll slay your innocence; Iâll burn your faith
Iâll tear your heart right out; I will endorse your pain

Burn it. Burn your faith

They drained all life from me; they have fed me hate

The blood of all the innocent
Will paint the doors to redemption
And when hell is full again
The dead will walk the earth again

I have become manâs destructive nature
Iâll never cease to exist in here
I will survive apocalypse
I will become the slave of saints
