It used to make me feel alright
It used to hurt me deep inside
I put a stick right through my heart
Lower and ahead

I always look so kind
When Iâm breaking through your mind
Pretend to be so nice
When Iâm messing with your soul

You neglect me, always leaving me behind
You disrespect me; itâs in your kind
So I reject you
No more talk; Iâll go away
