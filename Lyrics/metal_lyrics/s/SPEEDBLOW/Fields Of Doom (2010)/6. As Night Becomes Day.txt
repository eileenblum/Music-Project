Couldnât believe the things you said
And now the words fly over my head
Your treason eyes are chasing me down

And I could find a million thoughts
A million causes and a long pause
To throw my anger straight to your face

So now I wait and so I wait
To hear your lies all over again
And I will take them straight to my heart

And when the night becomes the day
The moon pushes my light and sun away
I go to sleep never to wake up
