I curse the air I breathe
Suicide obsessions I feed
The deep depression I drowned
In dark silence, I claim the death

I have betrayed life once
Denied the cross and his grace
Through his eyes I despised
In endless revenge, I die

I see desolation no meaning in life
The end is near, I close my eyes,
Cut me open, let me bleed
Take my blood quenched your thirst

Unchain my soul nail my heart
Kill me now or let me die
