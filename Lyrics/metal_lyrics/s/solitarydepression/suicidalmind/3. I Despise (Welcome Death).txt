My life has become hollow void
There is no relief nothing left but pain
Surrounded by sin obsessed by anguish
I must retreat from this immoral life
Embracing the darkness, rejoicing in this suffering
For I am alone with the hate inside
I shall escape through this fucking lie

I welcome death
I am beyond your life

Revile me despise me for what I am inside
Torment me crush me before I depart
I am close to what I deserve, a dream I often wonder
Eternal freedom no longer to be a mortal sin

I enter the realm where spirit prevails
And forever I'll roam in the land of the dead

I welcome death beyond your life
