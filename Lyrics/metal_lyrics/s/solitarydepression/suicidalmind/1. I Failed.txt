I dream about dying
Weak deep inside
Lost hopeless gloom
Nothing to feel inside
I dream for better days among the dead
With the hope of existing with you once
I embrace life towards the eternal light
Forever, my beloved, I sense your demise
Time grows old the grief has consumed me
Despair brought forth death to you an end
All hope has vanished within my heart
Your death seduced my soul to an utter pain

I glare at your coffin beneath the dark moon
Whispering tears attest your absence
