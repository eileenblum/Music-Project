My darkest hour has begun
This bitter life soon to be discarded
Twisted mind fuck poison
Streaming down into my veins

I'm falling into deep dark oblivion
Weak all I have become
Pain is all I have a true source of death
Like an illusion guided by insanity

I do not wish to live longer
Hide my secret in dreams
The bleeding memoirs
Don't despite won't regret
Uphold my soul with a knife
Comfort me in death
