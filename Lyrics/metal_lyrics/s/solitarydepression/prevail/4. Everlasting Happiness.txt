A lonely, lost and empty soul
Bleeding through a shattered past
Isolated dream, forgotten from reality
Another life had slowly passed

The life you have hidden behind the cross
That madness crept into your soul at night
All the lies that you fed upon to survive
Poisoned into your breathing heart alive

Everlasting happiness, pride, and genocide
This life has meaning, suffering, and sacrifice
Everlasting happiness, a dream till you die
