[Person 1:]
"close my eyes
Pull my heart strings
Pour my tears from your hands
'connections are never easy,'
You said empty words
Empty soul
I believe that we are afraid of one another"

[Person 2:]
"And I, I believe that you have died within me"
... I fade from myself
I miss you again
I fade from myself
I miss you again... again
(what have we got?)
Bloody broken and hidden away
I seek the rope from which we will hang
Or so it seems
Or so it seems
The dance of flesh on flesh has rendered us blind

[Person 1:]
"I look into eyes, I look into stone
It's better to be stepped on than left all alone...
So now I choke on yesterday when I was someone
And I wonder where 'forever' went
And how our 'everything' came undone
I opened my eyes and the heaven beneath us died."
