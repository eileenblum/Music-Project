These dialogue stars dream of sundays in October...
Perception keeps us whole, and it may just be time
To look rather than merely see...
These testaments to divine light,
Years of work glare back at us...
Out from oil,
Out from marble,
Out from sound...
And sublimity, seeking sanctuary in the written word...
In the written word
To make the inspiration
Visible.
Audible.
Touchable.
To create a world from dust
That is what it means to be our own deities.
