Because it cuts so deep to see myself wishing upon melting stars
I cut the cord I finally give in...
Beyond visions of wretched smiles
And the dread that they've befriended
I have seen an end to you and I
(when did "we" begin)
And a warped sense of being that I embrace must exist
And we with whole hearts yet broken words
We dream of wisdom but I yearn only for you
You will destroy me with words that you have never spoken...
I've drawn a picture of us twisted within
Yet below this world I absorb life from portraits
As long as we remain abreast of one another we will never meet each other
As long as we whisper to one another we will never fully hear each other
As long as my eyelids are weighed down by desire and one dying wish
I will never know when you appear
