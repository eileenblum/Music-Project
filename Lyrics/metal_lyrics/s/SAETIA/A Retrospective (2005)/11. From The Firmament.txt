As a star will fall,
I plummet from your sky,
And long to return to a world you've denied me.
Beneath my heartache,
I have made a promise:
To never let you forget.
You left your namesake,
And it will bleed
Into you from every pore.
And even though I am most fallen from you...
I have still overtaken you.
But yet I still cannot find you...
I see black and white...
You see only gray.
I see black and white...
You see only gray.
Distorted image.
Pride clouded.
Unloved... Just because you taught me it's better to be accepted than respected.
I shut the door on you this time.
Don't return with your heart in your hands;
You are most fallen.
