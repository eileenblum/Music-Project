Sitting on the side of a lonely road
Beyond middle of nowhere
"Trace the memories of our times
For the ones who had to fall
You may die before the end
But the end is yet so far"
All around the world the lonely bloodstone 
Walks in search of another year
"For there is something new 
You will find each passing day
Come together for the way
The life you were born to lead"
Come heed the call of the wild
The east and west are mine
Another chapter in the story
Let's make some history
Down the dirty road I look again
The footprints join and divide
"Ask again for some consolation
Burn these bridges down
You may die before the end
But the end is yet so far"
