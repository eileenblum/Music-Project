Tender is the night:
The one that must not be named
A beast within the human skin
I bow before no idol
Craven in my image
The world is made of dreaming
Of misty visions without words
In it you cannot hide
Trust the morning come
Tender is the night
Falling from the light
Against the sky
Into the silence
On these roadways never trodden
For a past and present unforgotten
I draw these bitter words
Sing vengeance for the one
The one who gave me this life
Gave me breath and gave me fire
Emotions without dignity
Life without end
Go to sleep my love...
