Untouched by the sun we tread 
As many have before
We are as all things mortal
Left alone to find the light
The trailing echoes of a time
Whispering solemnly
We shine our sun on these darkened skies above
I know:
The winds will take me home tonight
I wanna be where the echoes die
We believe in this truth we found
Underlying
Everlasting
To the cold in the air tonight
Follow the star in the morning sky
The be all
The end all
The single truth
Love under will
There's nothing that can harm us now
As summer turns to fall
Within which all must come undone
Laugh with me by this coming dawn
A scarlet sunrise
And we will see what lies beyond it's reach
