Wander in silence
Walk all alone
The secret thoughts
Touch the unknown
Everything that I hold dear seem so far away:
Holding a candle
For what remains
What they did to me
It cannot be undone
No more lies, I've seen it all just fade away:
Deep in my mind
Deep in my soul
This precious pain I can't let go (I cannot let it show:)
Wait:
For another day
For the vision of truth
In the dream domain
Pray:
For another wave
To wash your sins
To the dream domain
Facing the stranger
In reflecting glass
Touching the flame
Trying to feel alive
Hold my heart as a candle against the freezing wind
Watching the shadows 
Dance on my skin
We bleed inside
Dying to feel alive
Happiness is just an illusion, a step into oblivion
