I'm not the one to show you the way
I'm not worth shedding a tear
These arms will never give you what you're longing for:
There's too many years between us
There lies an ocean of pain
Dark roads I hope you'll never have to walk

I'm Too Far Gone
These stories have no happy endings
So turn away
Before I tear your soul apart 
I'm Too Far Gone
These stories have no happy endings
So turn away
Before I steal your dreams:
Burnt by the everlasting sun
I see no soothing rainfall
But bitter tears holding the sweetness of blood
There's too many tears between us
There lies an ocean of pain
Scars I wish you'll never have to wear
