I'm sleeping with this sin again 
On lucid borders of the night
Watching as everything will fall apart
I know this is for real
The only thing that's left for me
The broken hopes calling from yesterday 
I would have such sights to show you now
Let my soul be heard
See me crash and burn
I have seen
My Magdalene
Walk With Thee, Forever in The Cold
As I have seen
My Magdalene
Walk With Thee, Forever, Ever in The Cold
Lie under cold blue stars again
I see all that could have been
Watching as everything has come apart
I know this is for me
The rite of fall to feed the need
The human nature falling on misery
