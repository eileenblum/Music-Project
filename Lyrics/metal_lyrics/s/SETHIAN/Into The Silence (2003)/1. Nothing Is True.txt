In a song that can't be sung 
I'm the man on the outside looking in
To just the beating of your heart
Just one man beneath the sky
Just two eyes and a word unbroken
And everything's permitted 
Nothing is true anymore
Just two hearts and a chain unbroken
When death's sleeping eyes shall open
Rest Under Her Silver Wings
If death is a long cold rest
You can lay your burden down on me
See but the chaos of your soul
Just one kiss behind the lie
Just two hearts and a chain unbroken
And everything's permitted 
Nothing is true anymore
Just two eyes and a word unbroken
