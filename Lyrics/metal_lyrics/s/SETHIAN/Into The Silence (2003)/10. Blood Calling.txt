Bringer of light
The Faustian search, envision my primeval self
Sail the vast ocean of lucid darkened eyes
Cast asunder,melting my soul
On this sea of million dreams
Through this first flower
I?m touching the boundaries of evolution itself
Blood calling 
Blinded by the light
See beyond the oceans of time
Blood calling
Blinded by the light
Find a path of altered states of life
Search Promethean 
Endless quest, to touch an angel of light
Take my soul but give me knowledge at any cost 
Torn apart I?ll find the way
A little death to soothe my soul
Way to realisation
Through obliteration of this mortal coil
