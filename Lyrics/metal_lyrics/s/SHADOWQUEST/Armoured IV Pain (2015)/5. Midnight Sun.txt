Mighty warriors Gods of the sacred army Winds blow your way To follow the dawn 

So ride my brothers On the path of glory Rise from the dungeons Unchain all the slaves! 

So sail away from agony and pain Weâll meet again But I wonât be the same 

Can you hear the cry in the night We all crave magic and might And we pray that we will be one In the land of the midnight sun 

Iâm standing calm With all my brothers On the land we love We will never fall 

Weâll never surrender To the mind of ignorance 20th century vikings Be proud and stand tall!
