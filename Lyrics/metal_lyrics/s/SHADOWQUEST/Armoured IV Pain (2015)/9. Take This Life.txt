Had I known, where my life would bring me I would flee, I would take this life By the end, I was left so lonely In the dark, in the shadowreign 

Laughter mixed with roars of pain Madness takes me, makes me scream 
Teeth bite deep into my flesh Take this life Voices scream inside my head Nails that rip into my veins Leave me to bleed Set me free, to ease the pain 

I am scars, I am bits and pieces Torn apart by machinery I am pain, I am food to feast on Kept alive in the pleasuredome 
Laughter mixed with roars of pain Madness takes me, shakes my soul 

Teeth bite deep into my flesh Take this life Voices scream inside my head Nails that rip into my veins Leave me to bleed Set me free, to ease the pain
