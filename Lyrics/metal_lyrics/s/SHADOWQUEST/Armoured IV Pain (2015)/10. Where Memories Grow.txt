The day is here To search for peace of mind Iâve lived my dream And seen the life of mortals I sense my dusk Itâs cold and winterâs near I must return Cleanse myself from madness 

Soon I will be there I dream of the lands of the golden dawn Guided by longing My soul will lead the way 

Twilight As the raven of dawn calls the morning I behold my home Gone for so long, I sing for the mountains And the valley of dreams How they echo in my lonely heart Water flows, where memories grow 

Our blood is strong We lived a hundred lives From then and on We seek eternity Our minds are one We share a soul in chains Our bless and curse Thus we face the ravens
