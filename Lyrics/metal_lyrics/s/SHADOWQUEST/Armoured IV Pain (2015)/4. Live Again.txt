My senses are numb and my eyes cannot see Shadows are lurking where light used to be Parts of my heart are invaded by fear Reasonâs abandoning me 

Lost like the tears of the oceanborn Rattling like storms of the evertorns Courted by madness I cling to my dreams Truth is to find in the eye 

Seek the secrets of the dark The tale is yet untold In the heart of shadows, deep within A flickering light growing strong 

I am free, to dive into the sea Spread our wings and we will fly Put your fears aside, and live again Life is embracing my soul Iâm one with the light 

Searching myself, I push on through the maze Tempted by habitâs discouraging face The seed has been planted, itâs starting to grow Tears fall like rain on the soil 

My mind is evolving, a new day is near I stand at the crossroad of courage and fear I offer my soul to the demons in me Trusting the eye of the storm
