Colours are fading and vision is blurred The pathway ahead is forgotten Gaia is gone but her echo remains Just traces of dreamscent, so shattered Touched by remembrance I call out her name Silence falls heavy, like teardrops Need is the key to awaken the wild Soar, my words on the wind 

Come back to us Embrace our lives Embrace the light and find the strength to live again And then she stirs She floods the world Unfolds the darkening of days 

Release me from pain, save me again Feed from my soul, drink from my dreams Iâll shelter you all, answer your call We are all one, all that and none 

Fate has been altered, itâs all coming back A light in the dark, growing stronger Silence is broken by whispers of hope The sky is beginning to fall Circles of time are destroyed and remade The weave of the world is exploding Myth is reborn and the stories retold Ablaze, the breaking of dawn 

Come back to us Embrace our lives Embrace the light and find the strength to live again And so be it Our world is new And we will never be alone 

Release me from pain, save me again Feed from my soul, drink from my dreams Iâll shelter you all, answer your call We are all one, all that and none
