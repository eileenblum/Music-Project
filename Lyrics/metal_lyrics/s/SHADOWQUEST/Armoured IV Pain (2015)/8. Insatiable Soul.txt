Kinship is dead, our brothers attack Allegiance once held, now nothing remains Stabbed in the darkness, cut to the bone Blood of our souls, tears of betrayal 

Sing to forgive, remember this night Flowers that fade, to dust with us all Fearless, by the light, we will enter the dream Whisper the words of old 

Courage, let the lost ones guide us Treachery, while our love bleeds Dreamer, in the heart of darkness Youâll be our light 

Through the mouth of madness Through the wall of flames, and the pain In the veil of sadness Find the strength to fight, carry on 

Fire, desire This moment, be true to yourself Live, as you never have lived Die, as you taste the dream Insatiable soul 

While dreams meet their end, and memories burn I search for my love, Iâm searching the dead Light of the night star, open my eyes Let us unite, let her be found now 

I see her at last, the fear in her eyes Wash it away, the tears and the lies Calmness, in the void, she is far yet so near Whisper the words of old 

And as dawn breaks, hope returns We all live on, in the dream 
Fire, desire This moment, be true to yourself Live, as you never have lived Die, as you taste the dream Insatiable soul
