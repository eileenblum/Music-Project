Breaking the waves, eager to fight We are the forces of light The winds bring us to shore We come with the sun, gather all gear Time has run out, battle is near 

When dreams lay down to die And echoes fade The whisper still remains We will fight for the broken ones 

No fear, no tears No more weakness We bring power We feed your strength Revived, reborn I feel stronger Deny, defy I wield madness 

Losing our ground, weâre ready to die Suddenly, screams from the skies 

When dreams lay down to die And echoes fade The whisper still remains We will fight for the broken ones 

No fear, no tears No more weakness We bring power We feed your strength Revived, reborn I feel stronger Deny, defy I wield madness
