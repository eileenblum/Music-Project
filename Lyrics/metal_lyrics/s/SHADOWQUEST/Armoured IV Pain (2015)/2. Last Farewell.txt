Shadows hidden by a smile Hollow heart inside Hope is fading, goes to dust And all that remains is the silent pain Life is cold and no one seems to care So how can I go on? I have tried so many times To tear down the walls and be born again 

But there is no escape When your soul has been raped When darkness is left in denial So canÂ´t you see, I cannot flee anymore

I faced my fears tonight I fade into the light My darkness burns in me A fire unrestrained And as the angels cry I leave my past behind This is my last farewell As dawn begins to break 

I was left alone to bleed There was only me But something kept me hanging on My withering mind heard an angel cry I was given strength to carry on Feed the warmth inside Feel the power, of belief The surge to revive the remains of me 

So there was no escape When my soul had been raped When darkness was left in denial But I feel, I cannot flee anymore
