Tension, dissension, I doubt and despair Courageous, in cages, they bow and declare That nothing is higher, to give and to serve Surrender your will, be their puppet and slave 

I try to ignore the words of the crowd I seek to hold on, retain my sanity and hope 

You should seek the path within Be the master of your will Wield the powers of the heart To reach beyond the dream You should take control of fate And let all your doubts abate Itâs time to cut the ropes and wander free 

Life is a gift and I challenge you all âCause none of your ramblings can trigger my fall Bound to the oath that I pledged to myself Iâll be the master and I will stand tall 

I set out the course, I look to the stars But one sip of air, and I taste the freedom of my heart 
You should seek the path within Be the master of your will Wield the powers of the heart To reach beyond the dream You should take control of fate And let all your doubts abate Itâs time to cut the ropes and wander free
