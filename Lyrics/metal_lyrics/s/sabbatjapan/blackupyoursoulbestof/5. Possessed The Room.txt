[Kanashibari part 1]

I hear it from all wall
I feel it from every side
It heavily attacks me
It takes me to an illusion world
I can not escape, I can not shout
My body becomes hard like a steel
The evil time passes, I perspire
Something is just going to happen

*
The room is full of sorrow and hatred and
The anger... In the room... Kanashibari....
Possessed the room !

I feel an uncommon cold
I hear tragic shout from hell
Uncanny hands which appear from the wall
It violently strange my neck
The blood sprays splash from the ceiling
And it dyed my body red
Someone holds me up to ridicule
The evil eyes gazed into me

[repeat *]
