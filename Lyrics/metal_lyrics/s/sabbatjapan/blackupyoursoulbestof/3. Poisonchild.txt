He was born in hell, live in rotten world
Black blood is running in my body
Carry on his black evil fire cross
Eat away in the grave souls of rage

*
Destroy the wall, concrete wall, explode !
Poisonchild !
Nightmare and fact, from in the mirror,
Take out ! Poisonchild !

You're hated, anyway, anywhere,
You can live only in hell world
But bring you to life by black hell noise
Metal heart asks for insane blood

[repeat *]

Darkness gives me power, everything drives me
Dry ground, rotten light, smell of water,
Smog sky, destroy the wall, concrete wall,
Fly out from the gates of hell ! Poisonchild !
