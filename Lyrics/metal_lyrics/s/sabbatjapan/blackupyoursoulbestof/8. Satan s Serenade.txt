[Quartz cover]

Break the rules - you pay the price
When evil stands alone
Fire of hell that starts to rise
Burning through your toes
Something you just cannot hide
So deep that he canÂ´t find -
Look out - look out!
"SatanÂ´s Serenade"

Guilty minds can only find
Peace and understanding
Only love can set you free -
Save you from this madness
Something you just cannot hide
Look up to the sky -
Look out - look out!
"SatanÂ´s Serenade"

Fire that drags you down
IÂ´m searching to survive

IÂ´m twenty thousand feet and falling
IÂ´m looking for someone to love
I need an angel to come calling
To take me back where I belong
