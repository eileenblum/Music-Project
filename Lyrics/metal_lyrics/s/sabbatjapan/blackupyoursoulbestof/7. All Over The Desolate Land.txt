Now Hear from the beyond, The death hellish voice of spirits
"Please, Help me" shout it, shout it out
They don't know to rest in peace, They don't know nothing in this world

Now Hear from the beyond, The death hellish voice of spirits
"Please, kill'em all" shout it, shout it out
They don't know to rest in peace, They don't know forgetten to the past

All over the desolate land, groan without end
under the dark, until baptized by devil
