I pour you, hellish queer voice
Run after you, till fall in hell
I'm the evil eyes, Antichrist, Satanachrist
I kill you, break up you
I want it, splatter! Splatter!

Evil night song, requiem of hell
Swing in the dark, axe and knife
Electric saw, everything is in my line
You can't escape, wait only death
I want it, splatter! Splatter!

Oh no save me
My face is so bloody as to no understand someone
Shudder with horror, and damp with cold sweat
I wondered what it can be
I have something in my hands
Bloody axe in my right hand
Knife is stained with a piece of meat in my left hand

I pour you, hellish queer voice
Run after you, till fall in hell
You can see soon, you can see the sea of blood
I kill you, like a horror movie
I want it, splatter! Splatter!
