[performed by Sabbat]Buried alive, dying alive, history's bog of past days
Blooming flowers in the graveyard, there's not an only word
Laughing at the times of this world, when the dragon-tiger judges
We're again, blessed it of ours, the law roars thundering hellishly now

Indomitable eternal soul that awakes at the hell
The silent fire of steel flames again
Golden spirit has been carved deeper than life

We're the Samurai, Samurai zombies.
Feel the steel dance in the air as ethereal winds

We're the zombies, Samurai zombies
Meet thy fate by the dark celestial ancient steel

Leave you to the highest without voice and blood
Pleasure and pain, sadness and illusion in thy evil.
