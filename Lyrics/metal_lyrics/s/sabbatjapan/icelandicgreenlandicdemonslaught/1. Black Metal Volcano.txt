The mountain shits, from the ass hole of the top
The ground vomits, from the bloody chasms
The ice bleeds, into the pussy of the mother
The fire howls, calling for death from the abyss

Melting the creatures, melting the creations,
In the stream of the burning lava
The gushing karma, the gushing magma,
Breathing in inferno
The karma rains, the magma rains,
Tasting this ruin
Hell brings hell to hell
Black metal volcano

The mountain shits, the cursed smells are swimming
The ground vomits, surrounded by the holy delusion
The ice bleeds, for the rape and the destruction
The fire howls, the lustful gas blows in the wind

Melting the creatures...

Melting the creatures, melting the creations,
In the stream of the burning lava
The gushing karma, the gushing magma,
Breathing in inferno
The karma rains, the magma rains,
Tasting this ruin
Hell brings hell to hell
Black metal volcano
