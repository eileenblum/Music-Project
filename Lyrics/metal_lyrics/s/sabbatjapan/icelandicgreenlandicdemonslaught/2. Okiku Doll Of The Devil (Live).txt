Sounding in the dead of the night,
Tear's falling to the dark
Evil brings to eat the moonlight,
Dream of illusion appears to scream
Her white skin looks like snow in hell,
Bright hair looks like crows from hell
Beautiful figure that can not feel
A rage of Buddha in the silent times

Terribly her eyes are blacker than all,
Dress bleeds with red sorrow
The opened way from unholy ground,
Eternally her black hair that grows
Okiku doll of the devil

The closed holy gate to the darkness,
Heaven's light is out of reach
Powerless Kanzeon is helpless,
Evil nocturnal breasts dance
Spiritual curse is drifting in her...that no one can see
Pretty mouth ever speak a truth &amp; a lie
Hidden in expressionless

Terribly her eyes are blacker than all,
Dress bleeds with red sorrow
The opened way from unholy ground,
Eternally her black hair that grows
Okiku doll of the devil

Her white skin looks like snow in hell,
Bright hair looks like crows from hell
Beautiful figure that can not feel
A rage of Buddha in the silent times

Terribly, her eyes are cursed eyes, freezing in expressionless
Only one, only her hair tells when her black hair grows
Okiku doll of the devil
