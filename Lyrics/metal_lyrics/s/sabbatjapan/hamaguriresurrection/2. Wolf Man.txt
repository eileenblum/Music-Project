Shining in the dark night, red full moonlight
Nobody on this way, concrete jungle street
Beginning to run just now, for his hungry blood

To darkness from darkness, moving for tasty meat of man
Oh wolf man, oooh
Eating away flesh of men going on living on the beat way

Offered this body to demon, under the sign of the moon
The fangs without mercy, unholy uncanny eyes
Beginning howl just now, changing body into the evil beast

To city from city, blowing the smell of blood
Oh wolf man, oooh
Sacrificing flesh of men going on living on the beat way

Oh wolf man, oooh
Eating away flesh of men waiting for the night to fall
