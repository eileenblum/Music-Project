The immortality of the soul
chant at chant at chant at in holy ground
Fall in go to the spiritual world
Ride on Ride on Ride on a funeral car

Fighting death agony, Death is calling me [X2]
(Hell)

I violently resisted death
But his power was disorder
My conciousness be taken to the beyond
killed killed killed by death
