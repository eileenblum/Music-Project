Quest For Blood
Darkenss Surrounds You
Shadows Through The Fog
Evil Forses Open The Grave

No Way To Escape The Butcher
Torment In The Slaughter
And Feel The Blood Lust
Crucifixioned You

Curdle The Blood
Can You Feel The Death
Curdle The Blood
Can You Hear My Scream

Demons Calling To Hell
Killers Without A Face
Silent Falls The Hammer
I Feel The Endless Pain
