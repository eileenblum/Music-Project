Silent strange moonlight you leave for hill tonight A number of the beasts You're hell servents Sabbat's callin' for you Invite witches by your scale sword Light up in the grave Witches dance Go mad Scream of victim The black bells tall Evil! Crest of Satan Groly and Power in hell Beast! Crest of Satan Bloody lineage lives He raped many lady Killed people What do you think under the evil crest The world's fallen in the dark Controlled by his power Sign of 666 which carved on the head Shout with skulls Standing at the gate of the hell You live forever Chant the spell Offer your soul and get death devil's power Crowd of devil dances Become insane on the bloody hill Emperor of the dark In the name of Satan He commits evil Black wings eyes Keep on shinin' under the burning cross Evil Satan! Father in hell! Beast! Great your wisdom! Evil Satan! Father in hell! Beast! Great your might!!! Crest! Crest of Satan! Blood! Bloodstorm! Bloodstained the cross! Oh!
