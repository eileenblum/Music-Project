The Bible says that all of mankind was born with a desire to sin (Romans 3:23).
That desire separates you from a perfect God (Romans 6:23).
The only way to please God is someoneâs death for your sin (Hebrews 9:22).
Because you were born a sinner (all of us were) this separates you from God.
Therefore you are already destined to pay for your own sin unless you accept Christâs death on the cross as a substitute for you (Romans 8: 1,2).
This was Godâs act of love for us (John 1: 12-13).
Blood was shed by the very God who created you (Hebrews 9:22).
That is true love (Romans 5:8) and it shows us true forgiveness (Hebrew 10:17).
If you reject His act of love for you as your substitute, you will pay for your own sins by burning in hell forever ...alone (Revelation 20:15 / John 5: 24 &amp; 20:31 / Romans 10 :9-10).

[Verse 1]
Demons running wild through lustful wavelengths (Ephesians 6: 10-12)
Watering the seeds Iâve sown (Job 4: 8/ Proverbs 22: 8/ Galatians 6: 7-8)
Up and down all around everywhere I look
Except the Sovereign Throne (James 1: 13-15)

[Verse 2]
Caught in a trap that was set to daze me
Lies rip deep to my soul (1 Timothy 4:1)
Torn and bruised my energy is gone
While guiltâs steel grip takes itâs toll (Psalm 38: 4,51/ Hebrews 10: 22)

[Chorus]
As by one man, sin shot thru (Romans 5: 12-17)
Brought down, ripped in two (Genesis 3: 23-24/ Isaiah 59:2/ Ephesians 4: 18-19)
One Man came to die (John 3: 16-18/ 1:14)
Bloodshed so you wonât fry! (Hebrews 9: 14,22-28)

[Bridge]
As a boy I delighted to see Your mighty Hand grace mounts of green (Job 38-42)
You took me through Your woods of wonder to see Your work ... just You and I (Job 36: 26 â 37:13)
Wonder and awe they kept me there that perfect place where sin was lost
But I was there still young at heart and bound by the sin that held us apart. (Romans 3: 23)

[Verse 3]
Embracing the lust of youthful failure (2 Timothy 2: 22)
He waits in the stillness of my wisdom (Psalm 46:10/ Proverbs 2)
I foolishly search for selfish ambition (James 3: 14-16)
While thousands are lost forever (Ephesians 5: 15-17)
