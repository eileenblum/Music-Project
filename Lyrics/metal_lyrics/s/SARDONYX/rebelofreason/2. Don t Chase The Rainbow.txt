[September 1988]
[Lyrics by C. Turner, T. Denlinger, Music by C. Turner]

Suicide never solves any problems.
It only makes things worse especially if you dont know Jesus.
Sometimes we get so depressed that we lose perspective on making good choices.
Satan doesnt care about you.
He is the father of lies and paints a pretty picture of happiness through suicide.
When you get to know Jesus, you realize that every single problem in your life is allowed by Him to make you a better person (Romans 8:28).
When your life seems too hard and you feel like giving up, ask Jesus to talk to you through the Bible and read the book of Psalms.
He will never fail you.

[Verse 1]
Feel the rope make the rope much tighter
Standing up on top of a chair
In your mind someone has told you
Go ahead no one will care

[Verse 2]
Feel the tears as they fall downward
Taste the salt running down your face
If you don't they'll think you're a coward (1 Corinthians 15: 33)
Blow your brains all over the place.

[Chorus]
Don't chase the rainbow (Genesis 3/ Luke 8: 12)
You will burn in Hell (2 Thessalonians 1: 8-9)
Christ is your answer (Acts 4: 12)
He will break the spell (John 16: 33)

[Verse 3]
Razor blades shining in the sunlight
Catch the gleam from the sight of your eye
Satan says as you look in the mirror
No one loves you, you might as well die! (2 Corinthians 4: 4)

[Verse 4]
Memories are passing by you
Thinking back to the times you had
Then comes the evil ones voice again
You are mine, come and see the end!

[Verse 5]
The death of poison twisting
Your life squeezed from your veins
You gasp but life is over (Hebrews 9: 27)
Your body laced with pain

[Verse 6]
Standing before the fire (Revelation 20: 11-15)
You never knew the Son (Matthew 7: 33/ John 3: 18/ John 5: 24)
But now you're lost forever
Your chance for life is gone.
