[May 1988]
[Lyrics by T. Denlinger, Music by C. Turner, T. Swarthout, R. Feltman, M. Simione, T. Denlinger]

Uncontrolled anger is not only dangerous but God calls it sin (James 1: 19-20). In contrast, righteous anger can expose an injustice or speak out against a false misguiding philosophy (Romans 12: 9-11). Righteous anger is the mood of this song. We live in a world which is Satanâs domain (John 12:3 / 2 Corinthians 4:4 / Ephesians 2:2). His purpose is to lead people away from Jesus. In John 14:6 Jesus said, âI am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No man comes to the Father except through Me.â Rebel of Reason will hopefully challenge you to think about your life in relation to Godâs truth.

[Verse 1]
Tell me why rebellion wins
When life is snuffed away (Proverbs 10:27)
Bite the Hand that feeds your soul
And throw it all away (Proverbs 11:5)
Burn in hell alone in bitter agony (2 Thessalonians. 1: 8-9)
Realizing when youâre there (Luke 13:28)
Youâve got to be set free
But choices are eternal (Matthew 25:46)
And now youâre all alone
To burn and cry and wish (2 Thessalonians 1:8-9)
You had believed on the Son! (Matthew 6:21-23)

[Chorus]
Youâre a rebel, a rebel of reason (Proverbs 1:7)

[Verse 2]
Freedom of speech, yeah thatâs your rule
To live and do as you please (Ephesians 2: 1-3)
Selfish pride controls your thoughts (2 Timothy 3: 2-5/ Philippians 2:3)
You live your life with ease
âGet out of my life! Youâve got your own ... (Proverbs 14:12)
... donât tell me what to do.â (1 Corinthians 1:18)
Wisdom sort of slips your mind (Ephesians 5: 15-17)
Youâre talking like a fool (Proverbs 12:23)
Youâre saying by your lifestyle that God does not exist (1 Corinthians 1:25)
Soon youâll stand before Him (Revelation 20: 11-15/ Hebrews 10:31)
And see the Truth you missed (John 14:6).

[Verse 3]
The God we serve is righteous (Psalm 11:7)
His promises stand true (2 Peter 3: 9 &amp; 13)
Hanging on that bloody cross (Isaiah 53)
He did it all for you (John 3: 16-17)
This life is but a vapor (Psalm 144: 4)
And all you have will pass (Matthew 6: 19-21)
So think about your future now (Ephesians 5: 15-17)
Rebellion never lasts (1 Samuel 15:23)
Yes, you will die (Hebrews 9:27)
God has no mercy if you reject His Son (John 3: 16-21)
Depart from Me your fate is sealed (Matthew 25: 41-46)
Thereâs no more time to run! (Isaiah 10: 3-4)
Selah (Hebrew word meaning âpause and thinkâ)

Special Thanks
To the God we serve who is all powerful and sovereign over everything we see and cannot see. Thank You, Father, for Your love, Your guidance, Your protection and Your forgiveness when we disobey You. Thank You, Jesus, for dying for us on that horrible day in Jerusalem.
We live for You and want to obey Your command to teach all nations about what You did for them. Thank You, Holy Spirit, for Your vision and illumination as we read the Holy Scriptures. Thank You also for Your power that You give us as we go. Without Your power, our work here for You would be a waste.
