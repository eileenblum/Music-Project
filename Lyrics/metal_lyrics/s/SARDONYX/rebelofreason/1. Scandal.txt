[July 1989]
[Lyrics by T. Denlinger, Music by C. Turner, T. Swarthout, R. Feltman, M. Simione, T. Denlinger]

Many of us have been called by God to teach the world about Gods free gift of salvation but we have sin in our lives.
Brothers and sisters, grab it by the throat and rip it out of your lives or get out of the ministry.
We wrote this song as a reminder for us.
Please pray for us.
Thanks!

[Verse 1]
In the beginning
vision is clear
Souls are dying
Christ is near (Deuteronomy 31: 6-8)
Spirit is working
nothing to fear
Comfort in Jesus
shedding no tears

[Verse 2]
Times are changing but you cannot see
You are straying from reality
Fooling the people and fooling yourself
You're no different than anyone else

[Chorus 1]
Scandal ... never you say
Scandal ... but you like to play
Scandal ... from Him you hide
Scandal ... fried by your pride (Proverbs 16:180

[Verse 3]
Battle is raging
you feel like a fake
Thinking it through (Matt. 5: 27-28)
you know what's at stake
Selfish and greedy
potential is lost (1 John 2: 16-17)
Voided and useless
you're driven by lust (Proverbs 5)

[Chorus 2]
Scandal ... Satan laughs!
Scandal ... demons roar
Scandal ... a battle is lost
Scandal ... in the heat of the war.
