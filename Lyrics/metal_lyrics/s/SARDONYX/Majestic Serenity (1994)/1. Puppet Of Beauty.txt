[September 1990]
[Lyrics by T. Denlinger, Music by C. Turner, R. Feltman, M. Anthony, T. Denlinger]

Sexual temptation is a deadly killer.
No one is immune to it.
The book of Proverbs in the Bible tells us to seek after wisdom and fear God.
That's what we want to do but many times don't do.
This song is a reminder to all of us to remember the source of all temptation.
Whether you are a "Puppet of Beauty" or the one struggling with sexual temptation, remember Satan is in the process of destroying you. Resist him and he will flee from you!

[Verse 1]
My son keep my words and store my commands within you (Proverbs 7:1-3/ 2: 1-5)
Keep my commands and you will live (Leviticus 18: 4-5)
Write them on the tablet of your heart (Proverbs 3: 1-3)
(Satan)
What? Look at her! (Matthew 5: 27-29)
Her beauty overwhelms you (Proverbs 5: 20)
She'll hold you and kiss you (Proverbs 7: 10-14)
... your fantasies running wild. (1 John 2: 16-17/ James 1: 14-15)
Everything you ever wanted. (Romans 13: 13-14)
Don't let this one go! (Proverbs 11: 6)

[Verse 2]
I am wisdom!
Seek me and you will prosper (Proverbs 4: 5-8)
Don't even think about pleasing yourself (1 Corinthians 10: 24)
Her words drip with death! (Proverbs 5: 3-5)
(Satan)
Imagine . . . lips of honey
Her hair running through your fingers
No one will know man . . . take her now ... (Proverbs 14:12)
She'll give you anything you want
You're not getting any younger!

[Verse 3]
Words will lead you (Proverbs 7: 21-22)
Seductive words to destruction
Follow her and you will die like a beast
He will bring you down! (1 Peter 5: 8)

[Chorus]
Puppet of beauty (Proverbs 6: 25)
They run you life now (Romans 8: 5-6/ Galatians 4: 8)
You disobey the Father (Colossians 3: 5-6)
Time to use your brains now! (2 Peter 3: 1-3/ 1 Corinthians 15:34)

[Verse 4]
Wisdom call out (Proverbs 1: 20-23)
It cries out across the land
To you, oh man, it calls out Heed the Lord's commands! (John 15: 10)
