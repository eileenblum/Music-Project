[June 1988]
[Lyrics by T. Denlinger, Music by C. Turner, R. Feltman, M. Anthony, T. Denlinger]

This song reflects the lie that the non-Christian rock musician lives who defiantly preaches hedonism at the expense of his/her audience.
We see the crowd looking up to us, and we realize our responsibility to them. Every musician is responsible to their audience.
If a musician ever sets his goal on making money at the expense of his audience, he will answer to God.
Jesus said in Luke 17:1-2, "Things that cause people to sin are bound to come, but woe to that person through whom they come.
It would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around his neck than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin." I'd say that's pretty easily interpreted. Wouldn't you agree?!

[Verse 1]
The multitudes are watching (Matthew 13: 14-15)
They see but cannot see
I hear laughter in the crowd
I see them staring at me
My words will give them pleasure (2 Timothy 4: 3-4)
The drug that calms their fears
But only for an instant
He helps me tickle their ears

[Chorus]
He's a liar (John 8:44)
And the young fall prey (John 10:10a)
He's a liar
They will soon hate the day (2 Corinthians 5:10)
When they see themselves
Under piercing pure light (Acts 26:18)
He has blinded their eyes (2 Corinthians 4:4)
When wrong seems too right (John 3:19-20)

[Verse 2]
They cheer when I appear (Daniel 3: 7, 12)
They cry when I walk the stage
They buy my cool philosophies (1 Timothy 4:1)
The crowd shouts forth with rage
When white rock sings so pure (2 Peter 2: 20-22)
The contrast is too great
Returning, they dance and chant to me
Again they take the bait

[Bridge]
I thought I knew what I did up there
Isn't satan just a word?
My fans are pulling triggers now
My vision's getting blurred
But still they keep on coming
The craze is too intense
I'm caught in a trap of fame and wealth (1 Timothy 6:9)
They want me on the fence.
