[Lyrics by T. Denlinger, Music by C. Turner, R. Feltman, M. Anthony, T. Denlinger]

We worship and praise our Lord through our music.
We want you to feel His majestic power and provide you with a tune to praise Him along with us.
We hope you take the time to use these verses as a Bible study to intensify your relationship with Him.

[Chorus]
My soul finds rest in God alone (Psalm 62: 1-2)
My salvation comes from Him
He alone is my Rock, my salvation
He's my fortress, I will never be shaken

[Verse 1]
Father, I love You Father (Romans 8:15)
I want to do Your will (Luke 22: 42)
You saved me from the hands of Satan (1 John 3:8)
My life is Yours to fill (Psalm 107:9 / Acts 4:31)
I love You Jesus, You died for me that day (Luke 23:46 / 1 John 4:10)
When sinless, You were nailed to the cross (2 Corinthians 5:21 / Colossians 1:19-20)
My life is Yours today (Romans 12:1/ Matthew 10: 38-39)

[Verse 2]
Father, your Word says I should obey your commands (John 14:21)
I stand here before you now, touch me with your hand (Luke 18: 15,16)
O Holy Spirit, your power is what we need (Acts 1:8/ Ephesians 5:18)
There's nothing more I crave but you (Psalm 63:1)
O hear these words I plead (Psalm 5:1-2/ 1 John 5: 14-15)
