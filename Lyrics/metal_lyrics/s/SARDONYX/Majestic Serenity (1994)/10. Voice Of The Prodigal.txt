[December 1991]
[Lyrics by Jeff Zimmerman, T. Denlinger, Music by C. Turner, R. Feltman, M. Anthony, T. Denlinger]

Someone once said, "I have lost the will to live, simply nothing more to give."
What a shame!
I feel so bad for people who enjoy being depressed.
Why do I say that? Because there are answers to life's problems, but most people know that answers don't come cheap.
Real answers work when the person in need really wants to change.
If you hate life, there are two things you have to know.
God loves you and has all the answers you need in His word, the Bible.
Secondly, in order for you to reach into His word, you must first let go of what you are holding onto. God has been waiting for you.
Cry out to Him!

[Verse 1]
Anger, bitterness, rage (Galatians 5: 19-21/ Colossians 3:8)
They dominate my thoughts (Ephesians 4: 31-32)
This world has treated me like dirt (Psalm 6: 6-7)
I have a right to feel this way!
Politicians, teachers, preachers (Romans 12: 1-4)
Get out of my face
I will live the way I want (Judges 21:25)
Free to live for me!
My parents do not love me (Ephesians 6: 1-4)
They deserve my anger and my hate (2 Timothy 3:2)
All they do is bust on me
So my ears are closed to what they say!
They don't understand
No one understands (Proverbs 20:24)
I've been abused, I will never forgive (Matthew 6: 14-15)
Get them out of my life!

[Bridge]
Stop and look at yourself (Psalm 4:4)
What good does your anger bring? (Ephesians 4: 26-27)
It brings poison
Bondage to the object of your anger (Romans 6: 17-18)
You're hurt and tired (Matthew 11:28)
Christ is willing to heal your pain (Isaiah 53: 5)
Reach out to Him! Reach out to Him! (Romans 10:13)

[Chorus]
Poison in your soul (Hebrews 12: 14-15)
There is poison, down deep (Deuteronomy 29: 17-18)
Real poison in your soul (Acts 8:23)
Cry out to Him!
Cry out to Him! (Psalm 130:1)

[Verse 3]
All your hurt, all your pain
Do you think the God who made you really cares? (Psalm 139:13)
Weâre here to tell you He does! (Ephesians 2: 4-5)
He knew you before He formed you in your mother's womb (Jeremiah 1:5)
He knows your need for love (Romans 5:8)
God says "you will seek Me and find Me
When you seek with all your heart." (Jeremiah 29:13)
Satan wants to fill you with his lies (1 John 3: 7-8)
Of revenge and blasphemy (Revelation 13: 5-6)
He is a liar (John 8:44)

There's a way that seems right to a man
But it only leads to death (Proverbs 16:25)
A wise man fears the Lord (Psalm 111:10)
And thirsts for Him while He may be found (Isaiah 55: 1-6)

Why are you downcast my soul! (Psalm 42:11)
Why are you disturbed?
Put your hope in God and trust Him
Rise up now and take His strong hand (Psalm 89:13)

That's right!
What are you gonna do man?
Refuse to accept God's love? (John 3:16-18)

Spit in Christ's face? (Hebrews 6:6)
I think it's time you took a bath
In His precious Holy blood! (Hebrews 9: 13-14)
