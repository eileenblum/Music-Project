[April 1990]
[Lyrics by T. Denlinger, Music by C. Turner]

Every time any human has been in the presence of God, the Bible says they fell on their face as though dead.
We cannot begin to comprehend the awesome power of God.
Both Ezekiel in verse one and John in verse two of Revelation stood before God and were sent out to tell the world what He had told them.
That is His command to you.
If you have given your life to Him, this song is for you.

[Verse 1]
Spread out above the heads of a million living creatures (Ezekiel 1:22/ 10:1)
As far as I could see and expanse like sparkling ice (Revelation 4:6/ 15:2)
I heard their wings take flight
Like the sounds of rushing waters (Ezekiel 1:24)
I heard the voice of God in unapproachable light (Acts 9: 3-6/ 1 Timothy 6: 15-16)

[Bridge]
His voice surrounded me
Like the light of His glory (Ezekiel 10:4-5/ Job 40: 9-10)
I fell down on my face before the throne (Revelation 1: 17/ Ezekiel 1:28)

[Chorus]
Stand up O man of God (Ezekiel 2: 1-2)
Get off your face and see
Tell the people everywhere (Matthew 28: 19-20)
What you've found in me (Revelation 1: 19)
I am the First, I am the Last (Revelation 1: 7-8)
I AM that I AM (John 8: 58/ Exodus 3: 14)
I was dead but now I live (Revelation 1: 17-18)
It is you I send (Ezekiel 2: 3/ John 20: 21)

[Verse 2]
I heard a voice blast out
Like the sound of a screaming trumpet (Revelation 1: 10-16)
I turned around to see the Holy Son of God
His hair was white as wool,
Like the snow on a winter's morning (Daniel 7:9)
His eyes were blazing fire
His face as bright as the sun
