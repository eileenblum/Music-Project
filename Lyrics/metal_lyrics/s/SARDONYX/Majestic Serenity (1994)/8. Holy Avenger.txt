[June 1990]
[Lyrics by T. Denlinger, C. Turner, Music by C. Turner, R. Feltman, M. Anthony, T. Denlinger]

We are sick and tired of the uneducated, foolish accusations the world throws at Godâs Holy Word. It has withstood the test of time and proves by its perfection that it is truly supernatural, holy book. The voice of the skeptic cries loud and offers the human answer which is, â... free to think as you please ...â By the authority of Godâs Word, we call this reasoning senseless, shameful and obviously satanic.

[Verse 1]
Take heed oh senseless ones who dwell among the people (Psalms 92: 6-7/ 94:8)
You trust in truth that you create and shout it to the children. (Colossians 2: 8)
Does He Who implanted your ear not hear your proud pronouncements? (Psalm 94: 9)
Does He Who formed your eyes not see your grand illusions? (Proverbs 20: 12)

[Chorus]
Holy God, Holy Avenger (Nahum 1: 2-3/ Revelation 6: 9-10)
O Lord our God shine forth (Psalm 94:1)
Overwhelm us with Your Glory (Exodus 15:11/ Habakkuk 3: 2-6)
Show them now and let them praise Your Name (Luke 19: 37-38)

[Verse 2]
You search for inner peace that special place of beauty (Deuteronomy 18: 10-12)
One with the Universe to see into infinity (Romans 1:25)
Does He Who made your mind not seek to know you fully (Psalm 139: 1-8, 23-24)
Does He not call you now to leave your quest for folly? (Psalm 85: 8/ Proverbs 26: 11-12)

[Bridge]
Sometime soon ... thereâs a time thatâs coming so soon (1 Thessalonians 5: 1-3)
Wake up and find out that we are all gone (Matthew 24: 30-31)
And you were left behind (Matthew 24: 40-44/ 1 Thessalonians 4: 13-17)
Empty ... oh, so empty ... (Matthew 25: 41-46)
You realize you were wrong
What will you do? What will you say?
Where will you go? Who will you pay?
Nobody! Nobody! Ooh Nobody!
