[September 1986]
[Lyrics and music by Rod Feltman]

God knows your hurt!
He knows your pain!
He wants to hold you in His arms.
He made you and knows everything about you.
All He wants is your trust and your obedience and He will make your life into something you could never dream of.
Believe me, it works!

[Verse 1]
You say that you are all alone (Psalm 38: 9-11/ Deuteronomy 31:6)
You cry but no one hears (Psalm 22:1-2)
Times are always changing people come and go (Ecclesiastes 3: 1-8)
The night surrounds you with fear (Psalm 91:5/ 23:4)

[Bridge]
If you want to put away your sorrow (Isaiah 60: 20)
If you want to put away your pain (Revelation 7: 17)
Time has come for you to make your mind up (2 Corinthians 6: 2)
Don't let it go again (Ecclesiastes 9:12/ James 4:14)

[Chorus]
You just call upon the Master (Psalm 145:18)
Call upon His name (Romans 10: 12-13)
He will send His fighting angels to the game (Psalm 91: 9-12/ Hebrews 1:14)

[Verse 2]
You feel your love is fading far away (Lamentations 3: 18-20)
Your paths have split in two
It's time to know
There's a love that will never change (Lamentations 3: 21-23/ Isaiah 54: 10)
His arms are reaching out to you (Luke 15: 20/ Isaiah 40:11)
