[Lyrics by T. Denlinger, Music by Tim Swarthout]

Paracletos is a Greek word which means, "the Comforter, Counselor, Advocate, etc."
Jesus told His disciples in John 16:7 that when He left them, the Counselor (Holy Spirit) would come to them.
If you read John 16: 7-11, you'll understand it better.
We sing this song at the beginning of our shows to ask the Holy Spirit to convict hearts and to cause people to believe in Jesus.

Sovereign Spirit we ask You to come. (Isaiah 61: 1-2/ Luke 11:13)
Your power convicting hard hearts of stone (John 16: 7-11/ Ezekiel 36: 26-27)
We call You beside us to guide us to speak (John 16: 12-15/ Acts 4:31)
Your truths for glory, please walk with our feet (Romans 10: 14-15)

The Wind rushes through our souls (Acts 2:2/ Ezekiel 37: 9-14)
The Oil flows deep within our bones (1 Samuel 16: 13/ 2 Corinthians 1: 21-22)
Tongues of fire, descending Dove (Acts 2: 3-4/ Matthew 3: 16)
Holy Spirit, Paracletos come! (John 14: 16-18/ John 15: 26-27)
