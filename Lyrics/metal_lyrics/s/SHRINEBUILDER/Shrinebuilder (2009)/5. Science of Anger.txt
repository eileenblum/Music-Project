asking me have I ever been there
I can see in your eyes you're different and real
asking myself why is it you care
I'm still trying to find what I feel
psyche binds to the golden host
exhortations o solaris
the heirophant rite begins
translucent jewel of osiric line
distant tide surging through my soul
stirring the blood of my fathers pain
I stemmed the firechilds' breach
humbly I stand
awestruck and numb
bask in the glow of your adoration
humbly I stand, ego succumbs
vibrations disturbed into twisted formations
distant tide surging through my soul
stirring the blood of my fathers pain
I stemmed the firechilds' breach
its time to hold
this place I treasure
mind so blind
conquering measure
words to now
extremely learning
a world so cold
for warmth I'm yearning
the destroyer's touch
blackout til dawn
absolution
toward the sun I send
purified and wash errant perception
