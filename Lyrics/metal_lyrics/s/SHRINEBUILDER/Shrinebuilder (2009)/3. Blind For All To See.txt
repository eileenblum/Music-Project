All to see
Give to the lesser riders snakes
The mountains crest the fire
They're leading on to the warship plane
On to the light
Give us solitude
Give us in the reign
Watch the bow reach
To the glowing gods
Through the astral plane
Blind for all to see
The hidden carriers bring the highest crown
To leach to the form
Our messages from the scattered bones
Bring the realms mute
Give us solitude
Give us in the reign
Watch the bow reach
In our requiem 
We have cast the stones
They tell us all to sleep
