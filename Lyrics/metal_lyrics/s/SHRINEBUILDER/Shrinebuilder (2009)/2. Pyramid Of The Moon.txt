This vision set on me
Like dogs roam the street
The eyes of our child
Unbroken to keep the flame
The trees they speak through me
And with them we have seen
The rage of the falling sea and the top of the sun
We waded through the beast
And fed the web unleashed
To hear the word unspoken within the pain
The walls of crows spread seed
To the earth for our feast of withering souls and reason
We turn to the moon
Sets upon sea of light
The non-returner soars
The opal rays beam preceptor on approach tenan
And glows lunar host
Ascendant freedom
Transference 
Fuse the watcher at Jericho
