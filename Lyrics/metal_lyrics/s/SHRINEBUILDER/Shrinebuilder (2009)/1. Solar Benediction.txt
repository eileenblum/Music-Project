Relegates towards freedomOn sojourn's round and breathesThe Red edict glows shorn seaEnshrined salute and reclaimsWe stand burning before youReturning wisdom with bloodThe mind to project returnsThe will to burn if we mustTakes him away preceederEvolutes the soul shrine prevailsAs triad cedes to the principleJericho onward through wailing gods and barren scapes of fleshThe mind of steel reversed A master of none but soulThis ditch is filled with noiseThe father emptied himTo let the vessel fillWithin the lowest tide the eye was dark and clearThe dark signal returnsThe further reckoning was to bring the future ghosts to see
