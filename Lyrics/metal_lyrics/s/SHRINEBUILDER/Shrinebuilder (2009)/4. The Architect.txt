From labyrinthine dream be releasedApprehends state, form, and timeRise FaridShe herself is all of theseThe minaretThe astral field's perceivedAnd permutations feedthe Initiate set freeThe rising entropy That wields the freeing bladeAnd asks of Mercury...When is the waking hour?When is the waking hour?When is the waking hour?When will the dreaming free be released?
