I declare war, war against human nature.
I demand more, more from this dilemma you call life.
You're so blind, you cannot see that with our mind controlling solutions we have controlled your "superior" specie.
You have been living in a lie, we've been able to create you a never ending hallucination.

And you think that you know what is fear, but how can you be afraid of something that you don't even know to exist.

In your mind you think that you are safe.
Your life is as fragile as a sculpture made of glass.
Mankind is blessed with ignorance.

And you still think that your God.
You are nothing more than a human sculpture made of filth and disgrace.

With one single though I can change the course of future aeons...irrevocably.

And you still think that you're God.
You are nothing more than a human sculpture made of filth and disgrace.

I am the Tyrant, the tyrant of your world, the devil guides us to mysterious ways.

Extreme mindfuck, total control?
Hypnotizing mental disorder?
You're so blind, you cannot see that with our mind controlling solutions we have controlled your "superior" specie.
You have been living in a lie, we've been able to create you a never ending hallucination.

And you still think that you're God.
You are nothing more than a human sculpture made of filth and disgrace.
