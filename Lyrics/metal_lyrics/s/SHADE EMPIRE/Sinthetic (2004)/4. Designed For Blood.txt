Again the dusk rapes the light and blood red vision covers my sight.
Again I fall into a realm where battles are fought, within my mind.
Forbidden, forgotten am I the last of my kind?
The night is waiting for me, it cherishes with its might.

Lay your eyes up to the skies and behold the sight.
The stars have formed into a sign of Pentagram.
Under this cursed sky you shall combine your life with mine.

I watch you trough the eyes of wolves.
The choirs of ravens it's my voice you hear.

Oh, how I love the night I get my strength from its might.
I cannot live in the light of day I need the wine that runs through your veins.
This desire that keeps me alive, it is and shall forever be my guide.

Faceless but yet my only shelter: the dark.
Here I belong, I am designed for blood.

The dreams about house of God are all nothing but lies.
And now you will see it with your own eyes.
Take the flame, burn yourself, see there's no pain.
The only thing inside your head is the lust for more and more.

My days with God have never existed for I have failed in his eyes.
You won't dare to show me your face, father of lies.

I watch you trough the eyes of wolves.
The choirs of ravens it's my voice you hear.
I follow you until you are alone in the dark.
I will baptize you with my desire for blood.

Faceless but yet my only shelter: the dark.
Again I must vanish in to the night.

Again the dusk rapes the light and blood red vision covers my sight.
Again I fall into a realm where battles are fought, within my mind.
Forbidden, forgotten I am the last of my kind?
The night is waiting for me, it cherishes with its might.

My days with God have never existed for I have failed in his eyes.
