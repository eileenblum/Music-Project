I am the one without name, yet I'm known everywhere.
I am the creator of your fears, bringer of your sins.
See the world that is for real, unlike the one you live in now.
The world you once saw trough the eyes of innocence was full of lies, and bitterness.

Don't look for something that you cannot find.
The strength you seek is already part of you.
Use it if you dare, don't be devoured by things that can tear your soul apart and will kill your heart with sins.

You'll have no trouble finding me, I have always walked among you.
You feel my breath on your skin, but you have never seen my face.

I am the serpent within your mind, follow me into the dark.
See what's behind the black veil of mind.

As the brightest day turns into darkest night, the same way you enter from this life to the darker side.
Your mind is full of black thoughts, your soul is in my control.
The earth you once walked on is now forgotten and gone forever.

You have no trouble finding me I have always walked among you. An angel in disguise.

Can't you see that I'm the one you've been looking for? The serpent within your mind.
