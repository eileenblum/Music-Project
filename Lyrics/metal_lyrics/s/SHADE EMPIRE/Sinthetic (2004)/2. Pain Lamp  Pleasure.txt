Ashes of burned memories cover my marks from infinity.
But just how many times I have walk this same path over again.

I can see the shine of deception in your eyes.
I was born to hate you and your kind.
You promise heaven, but all you can give is lies.

I see the fear of being left alone in your eyes.
All those ruined lives, corrupted minds with lies.

Now those forgotten souls scream your name from behind the graves.
There will be no tomorrow, there wasn't one today.
Every morning you will wake up to see your own image in hell.
And the day will come when these lessons of suffering will be taught you and your kind too.

I look into dimension of pain too absurd for man to realize.
And with joy in my heart I can see your upcoming destiny.

The force of black mind is much greater than you can ever realize.

I'll have my time to wait, but you will know my hate.
I will teach you the arts of pain and pleasure.

You're just a coward behind your shell, you will rot in your own personal hell.

Feel the heat of flames burn your flesh.
Were the flames really there or only inside your head?

Feel the razor cutting your skin, can't you see it's your own hand that moves the blade.

This is the art of pain and pleasure!
