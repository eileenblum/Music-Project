I am the crusher of all your gods and saviours.
Bringer of extermination, wielder of rage.
Your old believes, patterns made of lies, shall be erased by the rise of new kind of misanthropic wrath.

The earth is scorched, as we dwell towards the gates of our mortal existence.
The twisted wheel of time is now ready for the arrival of new kind of sovereign.

Say farewells to your precious memories.
It's time to enter a whole new reality, where pain is pleasure and pleasure is our only passion.

I am the almighty the lord from the world of chaos.
Bringer of destruction and grief, creator of new world... of worms.

Say farewells to your precious memories.
It's time to enter a whole new reality, where pain is pleasure and pleasure is our only passion.
The rush of torture in my veins... The shooting pain...

And behold the creation of unholy shall inherit the throne that lies in this new dimension of pain.

The earth is scorched, as we dwell towards the gates of our mortal existence.
The twisted wheel of time is now ready for the arrival of new kind of sovereign.

Say farewells to your former images and believes.
It's time to enter a different kind of reality, where all your hopes and fantasies are diversified in to nightmares.
