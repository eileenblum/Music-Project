Every night I can see the sands of time running through my hands, yet every time it seems that something gives me another chance.
All the times I've tried to die, no years no words can ever tell.
I want to leave but I'm doomed to live in this hell.

Sometimes I try to live. It feels like I'm made eternally to be.

Come funeral winds, embrace my soul. Carry me to a place where I can...(die)

Every night I can see the reflections before my eyes, and every time I must see my precious ones die.
Over and over again the cycle is never ending.
Over and over again I hope for the veil of death over me to descend.

I was born to be a creation of death. Again and again I must take my own life away.

Sometimes I try to live... I wish it would end. Again I have failed.

Come funeral winds, embrace my soul. Carry me to a place where I can...(die)

Again I shed my life out from my veins.
