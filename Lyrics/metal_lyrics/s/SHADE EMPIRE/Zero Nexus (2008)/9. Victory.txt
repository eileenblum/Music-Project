As it burned
The fire within me brought forth my hidden face
I walked through the fire eternal
9 voices within me
Were tearing me apart
To open the gateway they had to speak
with the same tongue
So I slain my wings and changed into serpent skin
I hid my face from the sun
Serpent-Angel watched over my every step
As it burned
The power within me brought forth my hidden face
I walked through the fire eternal
I had the key beneath my skin
to open the gateway of sin
The vortex called to its embrace
Blood coloured the white
I walked through the scorched fields
towards the gates
There was only oneself and the Black Flame
I was in every flame
I was in every shade
Our legion shunned no sacrifice
Harvesters of death walking among men
The skies opened and the final chapter wrote itself
Predators of apocalypse were on a hunt
The chosen 9 entered into the eye
What is end to others is total victory for some
Predators of apocalypse were on a hunt
The chosen 9 entered into the eye
What is end to others is total victory for some

A word from the band:
From Zero Nexus you can't pop up one certain song. It's definitely listening travel from the very beginning till the end! Music is richer and complex what we have ever made and we are extremely delighted with the result! Ambitious project in overall. Give it time to open from all its levels and feel the atmosphere of Zero Nexus. That's something what we have tried to capture with this album. Enjoy!
