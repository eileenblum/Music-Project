From the night crawled the serpent
Seduced to its toils
Plunged wisdom into mind, entangled into body
Moved in silence like the wind
Was present everywhere
Watching over your every step, the Serpent angel
Obscured one's sight
But yet gave vision to see all
Open your eyes in a new world
The paths have now come together and the destination has unveiled itself
You can now abandon your hollow shell
Your ragged thoughts are now crystal clear
All the elements are taking their place
The final encounter with the "others"
will start the last phase
Come on and step into the circle
We hold the key to the cypher...
You bear inside your mind
Eclipse now now the face of God that I have become in this darkened image
I move in silence like the wind, I'm present everywhere
I'm watching over your every step
I'm the Serpent-Angel
I gave you vision to see all
Now open your eyes in a new world
The paths have now come together and the destination has unveiled itself
You can now abandon your hollow shell
