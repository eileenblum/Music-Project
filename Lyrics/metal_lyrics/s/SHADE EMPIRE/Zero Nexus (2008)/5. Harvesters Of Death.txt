Humanity carries the knowledge of the beast
The living cannot teach the dead
but the dead can instruct the living
Empty faces
Bodies moving but hearts are not beating
nor is their blood warm
Legion that shuns no sacrifice
Their lives have already been given
Certain of their destiny
They are ready to merge in cosmos
Walking on a black earth towards a dead sun
Abandon human face and flesh
Incorporeal, but surrounding all of us
Abandon human face and flesh
The other dimension twisted where
the words of man do not reach
Where the serpent will devour itself
To fulfil the prophecy they are ready to
set the world on fire!
Harvesters of death
Walking among men
For a few short moments before the end
Walking on a black earth towards a dead sun
Legion that shuns no sacrifice
Their lives have already been given
Certain of their destiny
They are ready to merge in cosmos
Harvesters of death
Walking among men
For a few short moments before the end
