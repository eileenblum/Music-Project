Black as the heart of Satan
Deep as the pits of Hell
I float in infinity
Each moment I die and then I'm born again
Time has no meaning
There is no place
There's only Oneself and the Blackflame
Chaos surrounding me, the inner peace
The awareness that the work has now been completed for this part of the path
Will the others follow, I do not care
The ultimate goal is still closer
and someone will take the next step for me
Still I'm here, but not in the form of flesh
I guide you, I'm the sixth sense
The union of both, sun and the moon
I'm in every flame, I'm in every shade
Union of both the sun and the moon
Still I am here, but not in the form of flesh
You feel me, you hear me, but you cannot see me
I am every flame, I am every shade
I'm behind your every word
I'm in the eyes of murderer
I am Adam I am Eve, I'm the serpent and the king
Son of fire and shadow
I am Adam I am Eve, I'm the serpent and the king
I am in every flame, I am in every shade
The union of both sun and the moon
Still I am here, but not in the form of flesh
I am in every flame, I am in every shade
The union of both sun and the moon
Still I'm here, but not in the form of flesh
