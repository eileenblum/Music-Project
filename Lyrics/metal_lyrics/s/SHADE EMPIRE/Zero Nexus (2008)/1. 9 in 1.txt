9 voices within me are tearing me apart
9 sickening ones bursting out
To open the gateway they must speak
with the same tongue
Ancient elements are waiting for the moment
when the stars are allied and the eye will open
Behold the great gathering, when the sun eclipses
behind black leather wings and the 9 becomes 1
The search is reaching its final climax
I got the key beneath my skin to open
the gateway of sin
Dance through the shadow and the flame
Awaken from the everfrost of time
The one spreads its wings
The vortex opens, it calls to its embrace
The world stops turning as time loses its meaning
The moment I at hand
One by one the predators of apocalypse
gather within me
I got the key beneath my skin to open
the gateway of sin
Behold, the marks on your skin show you the way
towards the flames
I wait as the sun eclipses behind
black leather wings
9 voices are now in harmony
I got the key beneath my skin to open
the gateway of sin
