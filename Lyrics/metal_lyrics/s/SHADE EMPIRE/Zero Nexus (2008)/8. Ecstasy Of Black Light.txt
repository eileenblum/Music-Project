The skies have opened
The final chapter is writing itself
Hallucinations become reality
The insane now holds sanity
The structures of reality are twisted
As prey transforms into beast
Every creature is now equal
in the eye of Zero Nexus
They are all predators of apocalypse
The gateway is open
The chosen 9 will enter into the eye
The circle is finally complete
Now it's time to break it
As prey transforms into beast
Every creature is now equal
in the eye of Zero Nexus
They are all predators of apocalypse
The vortex opens
The chosen 9 will enter into the eye
The circle is finally complete
Now it's time to break it
The journey that once was their calling
has now given them Ecstasy of black light
Free from their human form they are now
part of the chaos they once reached for
