The depths are calling
Dark waters whisper, tempting to fall beneath
Where no light shimmers
Beneath the surface
those sunken eyes stare at to the sky
The broken star shines brighter
than the others now it's time.
The final breath, cold water, fills the tired lungs.
Dark veil embraces, your path here is done
Sink in cold womb
You are at the gates of your destiny
Drive away sickness
Drive away death
Beneath the surface
The final breath
The depths are calling
Dark waters whisper, tempting to fall beneath
Where no light shimmers
Sink in cold womb
You are at the gates of your destiny
Forget yourself and find greater connection
Drive away sickness
Drive away death
Beneath the surface
The final breath
