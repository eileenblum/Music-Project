Hanging on a cliff
Groping for something I cannot quite reach
The fall is too deep
If I let go It will take all that's left of me
Blood colours the white
I'm mesmerised
It burns in my eyes
But if I look away I lose all that I have
My mind is turning black, it's burning
Faces from the dark turning
Through the scorched fields I am walking
Towards the gates
Who tells the truth?
I see faces but
the words they speak are unknown to me
The crooked serpent
The distance is too wide
How can I know what's happening on the other side
I want to let go
But then there's no turning back
I'm kept in the dark
I stand on my grave
No one is there
There's no name on the stone
Serpent around my neck...
The gates are still sealed
My mind is turning black, it's burning
Faces from the dark turning
Through the scorched fields I'm walking
Towards the gates
I have the key, but it's under my skin
Blood colours the white
