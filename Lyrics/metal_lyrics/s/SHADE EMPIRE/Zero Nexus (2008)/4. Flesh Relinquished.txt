I slay my wings and change into serpent skin
Reform my flesh and hide my face from the sun
The black flames inside devour everything
I rise from within and claim dominion
Through the 9 gates, through the pits of mind
Burn the fields of your old life
Peel off pity and remorse
Heart of chaos brings tranquillity
As it starts to burn
The power within thee
Brings forth thy hidden face
You will be crushed
As I claim the throne in your temple
Angels are gone, your palaces burn
You enjoy the rush
Your mind goes blank and you throw yourself
into the vortex of decadence
As it starts to burn
The power within thee
Brings forth thy hidden face
I call forth the shadow which I am
and always have been
Walk through the fire eternal
The flames no longer burn your flesh
I slay my wings and change into serpent skin
Reform my flesh and hide my face from the sun
The black flames inside devour everything
I rise from within and claim dominion
Through the 9 gates, through the pits of mind
Burn the fields of your old life
Walk through the fire eternal
The flames no longer burn your flesh
You become one of them
From the heart of chaos you'll find tranquillity
