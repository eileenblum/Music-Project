This coldness goes straight to the bones
It is not from this world
It is not normalâ¦
As if the entire planet was just waiting
For something to appear
From the bottomless darkness
Something to devour the remains of
Your solar system
Â 
The sky howls in a way
That there is no peace
During these starless nights
Only the eyes of the nocturne
Can be seen
They will hunt you down
One by one
Â 
He will arrive beyond space and time
Â 
Malicious winds
Carry my flesh
with your wings
To face the destroyer of worlds
Malicious winds
Show me how it all ends
Â 
From beyond space and time
He is coming
From the bottomless darkness
He will arrive
The traveler!
