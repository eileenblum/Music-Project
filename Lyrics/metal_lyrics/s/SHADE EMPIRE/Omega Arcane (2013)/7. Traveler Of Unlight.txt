Traveler of unlight
Tremble the cosmic order
Unleash the black beast
To the halls of golden temple
Bloom in rays of black Sun
Â 
From within the void
And from void within
Summon the starless skies
Â 
Hear the call of a dying race
Combine my voice
To your black stream of the dead
As I join without a second thought
The knowledge through aeons
Pierce my spine
Â 
Traveler of unlight
Tremble the cosmic order
Unleash the black beast
To the halls of golden temple
Bloom in rays of black Sun
Â 
My dreams of Saturn now come alive
As my flesh melts from my bones
This calming blacknessâ¦
At last my thoughts are clear
Towards the gateway
I travel beyond the veil
of cosmos
Into chaos
Â 
I abandon this weak flesh
To set my will free
Â 
Traveler of unlight
Tremble the cosmic order
Unleash the black beast
To the halls of golden temple
Bloom in rays of black Sun
Â
