And so it happened
Dawn ceased to exist
And darkness became the law
The fact that only few percent
of human population survived
is overwhelming
Â 
With a smile I greet this new world order
Â 
The true nature of things is starting to reveal its grin
To witness chaos in all its glory â feasting among the Earth
Â 
We are privileged
We are the riders of dawnless days
We are the chosen ones
We are the dead who will hunt down the living
We are the predators
We are the riders of dawnless days
Â 
Tress petrify
And seas have turned
Into drowning pools of life
Acid rains hammering down
Thunderstorms cast the only light
Â 
We are privileged
We are the riders of dawnless days
We are the chosen ones
We are the dead who will hunt down the living
We are the predators
We are the riders of dawnless days
Â 
These dawnless days will go on eternally
And the skies are not cleared
The rays of Sun cannot penetrate
Through the black horizon
Â 
There are some survivors
Hiding in these ruins
It is our mission to hunt them down
and make sure
that we are the only ones left
Â
