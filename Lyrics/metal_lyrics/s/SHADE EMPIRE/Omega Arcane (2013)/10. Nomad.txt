Deserts of ice to be crossed
Mountains of iron scrap to be climbed
To find a way through
Just to start it all over again
Â 
Kill â and you might live
Fall down â and you are done with
Â 
Limbo of death landscape is endless
And those still alive are your enemies
Â 
As a nomad you must hunt in wasteland
Abandon all humanity, forget the faces
Â 
Deserts of ice to be crossed
Mountains of iron scrap to be climbed
To find a way through
Just to start it all over again
Â 
Kill â and you might live
Fall down â and you are done with
Â 
Limbo of death landscape is endless
Â 
Unlike in war where you fight for a âgreater causeâ
Here you fight just for yourself
Just to live another day and wait
Until thereâs nothing to be done
Â 
As a nomad you must hunt in wasteland
Abandon all humanity, forget the faces
Burn all emotions in stake of decay
Â 
To take another step towards the end
And feel more alive than before
Abandon all of humanity
Forget the faces
Burn all emotions in stake of decay
As a nomad you must hunt
Unlike in war where you fight for a greater cause
Here you fight just for yourself
Just to live another day and wait until
Thereâs nothing to be done
To take another step towards the end
And feel more alive than before
