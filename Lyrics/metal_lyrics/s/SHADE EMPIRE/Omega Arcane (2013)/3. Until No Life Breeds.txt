In vain they fight
They have fell from their throne
Â 
As the light faded from the horizon
The ones of the nocturne awake
Darkness grants them its blessing
And sends them out to hunt
Â 
Air is steaming as the horde leave its nest
Frost is covering the ground
All life shall be raped by the dark
Â 
As the resources expire
The only thing that keeps the last bits of human race going
Is pure instinct of survival
Â 
A herd of weaklings is lost in the ruins
And panic is starting to rise
The troops of decay smell their fear and are ready to strike
Â 
Air is steaming as the horde leave its nest
Frost is covering the ground
All life shall be raped by the dark
Â 
The scavenger of apocalypse
Will hunt you down
Â 
Until no life breeds
Until no life breeds
Until no life breeds
Â 
Behind the curtains of thorns
Far from the landscape of demise
Â 
Air freezes as the horde leaves the nest
All life shall be raped by the dark
Â 
Â
