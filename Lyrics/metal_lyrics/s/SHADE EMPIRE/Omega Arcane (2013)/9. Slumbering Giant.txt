Forgotten in the turns of time
Existence denied
A tamed beast tied up in chains that wonât last
Buried beneath the surface of this dying planet
Wandering in cosmic disharmony
Far beyond the structures of reality
Â 
There is no hope for your pitiful race
You cannot bury the old
I will arise
With joy I observe as your flame slowly suffocates
Â 
Observer under ice
A beast tied up in chains that wonât last
Itâs time to purify the scum of this planet
Dying planet
Â 
Wandering beyond the structures of reality
Â
