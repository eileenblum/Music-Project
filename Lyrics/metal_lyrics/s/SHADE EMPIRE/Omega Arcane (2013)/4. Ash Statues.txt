Fields, as far as the eye can see
Filled with human remains
Scorched to their feet
Â 
They were all praising the Sun
and this was their reward
Now they form the army of ash statues
Â 
Into the shadows you must flee
And whom ever can find a path there
Shall become the king!
Â 
And from that stone made domain
Shall the destiny of all remaining lives be made
