The killing fields have now gone quiet
And you are torn apart by the cold winds
What lies ahead behind the reapers grin?
A weight too heavy to be carried away
Â 
As I step through the black mirror
It is just a tiny step towards the chaos
Soon devouring cosmos
Â 
As Earth leaves behind new portals open
Â 
Am I trapped forever in this orbit of emptiness?
Will I ever assimilate
Â 
The more you suffer
The more you see
The more you give
The more you gain
The more you burn
The more you can take
