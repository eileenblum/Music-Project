Curses are written on a different plane
Mixed with acid
And what becomes of that riddle
Is a whole another story altogether

How beautifully the frozen flowers shatter
As fragile as life
If you think about it too much
You fall into a bottomless pit
And just keep on falling

Eternally

As the sun rises the shadows flee
But they flee not the light

I can baptise you into a better being
But you must give up the old
A treasure that will destroy you
But before that you are god

Which side of the mirror you stand on
If you stare into the limbo turn your eyes away
The truth is somewhere else to be found

Even the strongest chain snaps
But not to break
But to set free

I can baptise you into a better being
But you must give up the old
A treasure that will destroy you
But before that you are god
