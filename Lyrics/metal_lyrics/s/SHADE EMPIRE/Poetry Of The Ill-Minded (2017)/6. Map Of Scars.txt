The doors are sealed shut
Somehow though I know how to function
And what feels right
The seed has been planted too deep
And men won't realize it until it's too late

This just cannot go on
If you turn your face too many times
Your neck will break

And after that you see nothing
It is hard to scream with a mouth full of dirt
But you don't need to
Because you are already free
You don't need to accept any gifts
Because there is no reason to celebrate

Everybody just waste themselves in vain
And give out parts of their souls
Like they are pieces of bread
Those crumbs that Hansel and Gretel left in the woods
But they got lost
Even though they held each other's hands

One cannot lie in such things
Not after you have seen how the walls are melting

A moth is trying to get in
Behind the window glass towards the light
It does not realize that the cost is its life
But that light is just too tempting
That it becomes the meaning of its life
Just like those scars

What once was written was no more
And everything that was to be written after that was absurd
And the words were hanging in the air
Like the first hit of acid

One cannot lie in such things
Not after you have seen how the walls are melting
And the ground is in flames

Arms full of scars
And they just keep on coming
The scars, they just keep on coming
The scars, they just keep on coming
The scars, they just keep on coming
