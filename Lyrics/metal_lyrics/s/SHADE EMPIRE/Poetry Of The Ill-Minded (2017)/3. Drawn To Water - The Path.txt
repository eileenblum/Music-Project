I follow the nocturn
Observe in silence
What does that make of me?
Maybe I just want to follow the trail?
And find something from the dark

Those who walk during the day
Cannot understand the yearning
From the light of the stars
You can gain something that will kill the thirst
But just for a second

Smoke will cover those rays of light
And you just have to wander on

In the haze of dawn
The silhouettes are cast to the horizon
A line drawn to the water that breaks
Once you throw the first stone
You can see it in the clouds if you want
Or if you can bend the time
In ways that the end becomes the beginning
And the path is just revealing itself

In pitch black you need no eyes
Because you can't see a thing

Smoke will cover those rays of light
And you just have to wander on

In the haze of dawn
The silhouettes are cast to the horizon
A line drawn to the water that breaks
Once you throw the first stone
You can see it in the clouds if you want to
Or if you can bend the time
In ways that the end becomes the beginning
And the path is just revealing itself
