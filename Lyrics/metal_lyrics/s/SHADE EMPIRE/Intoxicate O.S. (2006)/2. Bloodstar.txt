In the dying hours of light, she summoned the beast of debauchery.
Sacrificing her virgin body to mockery, she was ready to feast among her own flesh!

[Chorus:]
Bloodstar... bloodstar... bloodstar... she got lost into bloodstar!
In the final hours of this nocturnal play, she realized that this was too much for her to take, but it was already too late...
