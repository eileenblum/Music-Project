Sell your soul for a dime, they promise you a paradise.
They try to control what you think!

They want to own your individuality!
They just want only one number more!

They try to tie you in their beliefs!
Your gates of Eden will turn into barbed wire.

You live enslaved by thy Christ,
and will never know life at all!
