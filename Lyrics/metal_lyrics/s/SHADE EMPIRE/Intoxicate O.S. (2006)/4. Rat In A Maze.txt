All is set for the experimentation... bring in the first test subject
Experimentations with human mind

Pushing you to the final limits

Go beyond the tolerance of pain... "hold it, we don't want to kill him yet"
You are just a marionette in their big game. Recyclable human waste.

You run just like a rat in a maze!
