I cannot recognize the face in the mirror. It stares at me with empty eyes.
Hollow human shell with no future in sight.

I welter in filth, the outside seems to be so far away...
Twisting the boundaries of mind. Escaping from reality into crimson flood.
The last kiss came from cold steel...
I cannot recognize the voice that comes out from my mouth, cannot recognize the words.

It is the voice of someone else, someone else is taking control.
Inside my head I can hear it whispering into my ear.
The reflection in the mirror turns into a beast.
