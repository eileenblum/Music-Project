We're rounding up the forces
To destroy the masses and take this city back...

This is history in the making.
This city is ours for the taking.
Hold it down.
You know we gotta hold it down.

Bitches be catching feelings.
Our beats be raising ceilings.
This city is ours.

You want the best,
You got the blessed and imma up your plays
I got this city in the palm of my hand.
From north shore to south side...
We're creating a foot clan.
I'm here to set the stage,
I'm here to start the rage.
And when your heart goes boom,
Wigga I'm to blame.

This is history in the making.
This city is ours for the taking.

You know we gotta hold it down.

Okay! This is the next level.
Top of the food chain.
You know we're so paid.

Rock the club till the early morning.
Make it hurt and show no mercy.
