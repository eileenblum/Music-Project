She's looking good in the dimmed lights
And she's ready for a good night
She knows her blood's positive
She's like fucking dynamite

Yeah, she's looking for some sucker
No, it shouldn't be hard to find
They all got their eyes on her
She wants them all to die

Now she's looking for two friends
Kill two birds with one stone
Yeah, she wants to blow their minds
She's like fucking dynamite

Making love in the club
Has never been so easy
Making love in the club
Has never been so deadly

Making love in the club
Has never been so easy
Making love in the club
Has never been so deadly

(Hey, you wanna take this somewhere)
(More private?)
(Oh, yeah. You have no idea)
(Maybe we can get down and dirty)
(In a bathroom stall)
(Oh, sounds like a plan, babe)

She's a weapon of mass destruction
She's insane
In the brain

She's a weapon of mass destruction
She's insane
In the brain

She's DTK
Down to kill
Down to kill

This is her revenge
Spreading her legs like a plague

It feels so good
You feel like a rockstar
And you think you got lucky
Better check yourself

This is her revenge
Spreading her legs like a plague
This is her revenge

She's a weapon of mass destruction
She's insane
In the brain

She's a weapon of mass destruction
She's insane
In the brain

Making love in the club
Has never been so easy
Making love in the club
Has never been so deadly
