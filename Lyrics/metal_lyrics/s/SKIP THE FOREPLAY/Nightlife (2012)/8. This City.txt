[Tony Gambino:]
Aww yeah
Looks like we're going to have
To join forces on this one

[Alexandre Erian:]
Yeah, we gotta take this to a new level

[Jonathan Cabana:]
Let's fucking do this

[Marc-AndrÃ© Fillion:]
Now
C-c-come on
We're rounding up the forces
To destroy the masses
And take this city back

[Jonathan Cabana:]
Forever
Let's burn this fucking city down
I wanna kill the king
And take his motherfucking crown
This kingdom is now mine
This is our fucking time
Prepare yourself for armageddon
This is a new sound of destruction

[Marc-AndrÃ© Fillion:]
This is history in the making
This city is ours for the taking
Hold it down
You know we gotta hold it down

[Alexandre Erian:]
We're taking over
Say goodbye to your lover
Your ass is mine
Baby, you're so fine
Bitches be catching feelings
Our beats be raising ceilings
This city is ours

[Tony Gambino:]
I'm on fire and Imma set you ablaze
You want the best, you got the blessed
And Imma up your plays
I got this city in the palm of my hand
From North shore to South side

[Marc-AndrÃ© Fillion:]
We're creating a foot clan

[Tony Gambino:]
I'm here to set the stage
I'm here to start the rage
And when your heart goes boom
Wigga I'm to blame

[Marc-AndrÃ© Fillion:]
This is history in the making
This city is ours for the taking
Hold it down
You know we gotta hold it down

Okay, this is the next level
Top of the food chain
You know we're so paid
You know we're so paid

You wanna hold it down
I'll hold it down with you
Rock the club till the early morning
Make it hurt and show no mercy

Prepare yourself
Prepare yourself
Prepare yourself for armageddon

This is the new sound
This is our town
Hold it down
Hold it down

Yeah
We did exactly what we said
We were gonna do
(Skip The Foreplay)
Yo Alex
Tell these kids what's up

[Alexandre Erain:]
You're in MTL, bitch

Aww
Roh
