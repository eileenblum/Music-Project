Roh

Here I go again
Brought me here on purpose
Can't you see in my face
Some kind of hatred
Still walking the same way
I'm not coming home

Still walking the same way
I'm not coming home
I'm not coming home

[Chorus:]
This is the path I lead
Cause I'm always searching
For something more
For something more
We're all searching for something more
This is the path I lead
Cause I'm always searching
For something more
For something more

Come on, come on
I never said I'll be alright
For a million times
And never again
Now with all those fucking lies

No, I never said I'll make it through
But here I am
And now the bodies will hit the floor
So brace yourself
Now with all those fucking lies

Now I'm like the wind
I will escape
Now I'm like the wind
And I'm gonna let you die

[Chorus:]
This is the path I lead
Cause I'm always searching
For something more
For something more
We're all searching for something more
This is the path I lead
Cause I'm always searching
For something more
For something more

I got the forty on the sixty
Two chicks in the backseat
Rolling with no fear
Destination unclear

Now I'm like the wind
I will escape
Now I'm like the wind
And I'm gonna let you die

(This time, this time, this time...)
(This time I will take you down)

Maybe it's simply justice
Like a never ending sunset
Maybe it's simply justice
Like a never ending sunset
