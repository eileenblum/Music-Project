(We must find this motherbitch)
(And bring him to justice)

[Solo/Intro]

All you girls in the club
Beware the date rape predator
All you girls in the club sipping bub
Beware the date rape predator

He'll try to slip something in your drink
And in the morning you'll wake up in a ditch
And you won't remember anything
He's done this a thousand times before

Beware
And keep an eye on your drink
Beware
And keep an eye on your drink

Never thought you'd lose it all
Never thought you'd lose it all
At last call

Never thought you'd lose it all
Never thought you'd lose it all
At last call
This is your last call

(Oh, my gosh)
(I feel so dizzy)
(What the heck is happening?)
(Oh, everything is so blurry)
(Oh no! Not me!)

Oh
You knew exactly what was happening
And you couldn't do nothing about it
I wish I was there to save you
I wish I was there

Never thought you'd lose it all
Never thought you'd lose it all
At last call

Never thought you'd lose it all
Never thought you'd lose it all
At last call
This is your last call

We're gonna find this motherbitch
And bring him to justice
We're gonna find this motherbitch
And bring him to justice

He's gonna rot in a cell
He's gonna rot in a cell

We'll set the bait
And when he bites
We'll celebrate
And show him a good time

Hey, hey, hey, hey
We're gonna fist pump
We're gonna fist pump

Hey, hey, hey, hey
We're gonna fist pump
Fist pump his face
