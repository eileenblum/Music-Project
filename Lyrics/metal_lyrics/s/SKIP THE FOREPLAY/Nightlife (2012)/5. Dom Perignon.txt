You come in our club and disrespect us
Better watch your back
If you keep talking smack
Who do you think you are
You've got some nerve
Breaking champagne bottles
You didn't pay for

You broke the Dom Perignon
Tried to start a brawl
You broke the Dom Perignon
Tried to take us on

You better pay up
You better pay up
You better pay up
Or you'll get (bass dropped)

You broke the Dom Perignon
Tried to start a brawl
You broke the Dom Perignon
Tried to take us on

You got a death wish
Or a hit list
Cause you know we ain't taking this thit

Now your crew is coming to your rescue
And they just do the same
Man, you guys must be insane

We don't want blood
But you're trying to cut us up
Yeah, you're trying to cut us up
With our bottles of champagne

You tried to kill us with

And now more back up has arrived
They surround us
And now they're taking out their knives
Wait, how did they get that in here

Security has been bribed
We have been compromised
Security has been bribed

We must disarm
We must disarm them
Before they gain control
It's in our hands
It's in our hands

We must disarm

Before they gain control
It's in our hands
