Let's go

No girls wanted to dance with this creep
Cause he tried to
Date rape a young girl last week
So he broke into the club
With a loaded shotgun
And told everyone to dance to his beat

So
Dance with me now
Dance with me now
If we stand still
We will be killed

Dance with me now
(Now)
Dance with me now
(Now)
If we stand still
We will be killed

He shows no mercy
He's just thirsty for blood

Fire burning on the dance floor
Fire burning
Fire burning on the dance floor
We're burning

You can't take us all down
You're running out of bullets
We will survive
We will
(We will survive)

I swear you'll pay for this
Your bitterness will eat you alive
I hope the strobe lights give you a seizure
And the 808s stop your heart

Can we get out alive
Can we get out
(Get out)

(He's psycho in the club)
(Hawaiian T-shirt)
(Trying to kill all the girls)
(That didn't dance with him)
(He wants them dead, dead)
(And if you stand still)
(He's gonna end you)
(Better dance to his beat)
(If you don't want to feel his heat)

He's psycho in the club
Hawaiian T-shirt
Trying to kill all the girls
That didn't dance with him
He wants them dead, dead
And if you stand still
He's gonna end you
Better dance to his beat
If you don't want to feel his heat

Dance with me now
Dance with me now
If we stand still
We will be killed

Dance with me now
(Now)
Dance with me now
(Now)
If we stand still
We will be killed

This could be your last night
This could be your last night to feel alive
Let's dance tonight

This could be your last night
This could be your last night to feel alive
So let's dance tonight

We gotta get down
For the Hawaiian T-shirt man
We gotta get down
Get down, get down, come on

We gotta get down
For the Hawaiian T-shirt man
We gotta get down
Get down, get down, come on

This could be your last night
This could be your last night to feel alive
Let's dance tonight

This could be your last night
(Your last night)
This could be your last night to feel alive
Let's dance tonight
