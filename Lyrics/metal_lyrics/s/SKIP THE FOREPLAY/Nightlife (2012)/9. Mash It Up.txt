(We're going out tonight, okay)
(We're gonna do it right)
(We're gonna party like it's 1999)
(Let's go)
(We're gonna turn it up)
(We're gonna mash it up)
Mash it up
Mash it up

We're dressed to kill
We're looking ill
You know we came to bring the party
And all the king's girls
Looking so fine
I got a feeling
Tonight's gonna be a good night

All you haters
Show yourself to the door
Come on, get out of here
You ain't welcome
All you haters
You know who you are
Show yourself to the door

And if you're here to escape
And not here to hate
Throw your hands up
(Oh)
Throw your hands up

And if you're here to escape
And not here to hate
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up

We go till six in the morning
And that's just us getting started
We throw the best after parties
We're gonna mash it up

Roh

We're gonna shake the ground
Oh
We're gonna shake the ground
When it all goes down

And if you're here to escape
And not here to hate
Throw your hands up
(Oh)
Throw your hands up

And if you're here to escape
And not here to hate
Throw your hands up
Throw your hands up

[Solo]

This is not the end
6 days till the weekend
We will do it all over again

This is not the end
6 days till the weekend
We will do it all over again
