Yeah

You're making my head spin
Going to-and-from on the dance floor
And I thought you were happy
Acting like a hoe on the dance floor

Oh yeah
You drop it so low
Oh yeah
Yeah
I'm gonna take you home

[Chorus:]
Make up your mind
Make up your mind
You're wasting all my time
I'm gonna take you off my VIP list
Make up your mind
Make up your mind
And it would be a shame
To take you off my VIP list

You know how to shake your hips
You know how to get my attention
You said you weren't falling in love
But there's something you forgot to mention

I'm in love with the DJ
(What did you say)
I'm in love with the DJ
(I'm about to break)
I'm in love with the DJ
(What did you say)
I'm in love with the DJ
(I'm about to break)

Oh
Oh yeah
You drop it so low
Oh yeah
Yeah
Yeah
I'm gonna take you home

[Chorus:]
Make up your mind
Make up your mind
You're wasting all my time
I'm gonna take you off my VIP list
Make up your mind
Make up your mind
And it would be a shame
To take you off my VIP list

(VIP list)
(VIP)
I'm in love with the DJ
(DJ)
I'm in love with the DJ
(DJ)

So get out of my car
And take that loser with you
So get out of my car
You're not welcome here no more
Yaao
