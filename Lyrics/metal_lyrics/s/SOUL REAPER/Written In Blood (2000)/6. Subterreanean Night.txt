So enter now, my darkness
All skies shall burn
The soulless children laugh in rage
A nightly structure unfolds wide for me
Rapt by the wind
Demonic powers- below the stars
...I am falling fast
I try to reach the surface but something draws me back
Instinctively searching in accursed environments
Longing for my spirit to unite whit thee
In absence of life - death shall arise - I hale the
wind
Of doom suffocate, in your embrace - my pain
From stars, from the skies
From the blackened winds of mine
I beheld the dynamic annihilation
Magically storms guided my way to times of torment and pain
Dark and desolated surroundings
With fragments if an diabolic age
Rose in majestic pride, subterranean might.
- You are the one
You've longed for this hell
Come to us now, and open your mind
(Let darkness in)
Arrival of the black ones
The final night
Death now greet my soul
Lords of darkness, embrace me.
Captured in a nightmare
A illusion called life
Bury me beneath
Oh thou faceless shadow let me pass, again
I saw myself, taking a step
Entering the very inner zone
Still I could see a fading light
But it didn't last
I saw myself, taking a step
Entering the very inner zone
Still I could see a fading light
Entering the darkness
The sky shall burn
The soulless children laugh
A nightly structure unfolds
Demonic powers- below the stars
...I am falling fast
I try to reach the surface but something draws me back
Rapt by the wind
From stars, from the skies
From the blackened winds of mine
I beheld the dynamic annihilation
Magically storms guided my way to times of torment and pain
Dark and desolated surroundings
With fragments if an diabolic age
Rose in majestic pride, oh subterranean might.
True sad art
Painted by my heart
Reflects in the eyes of the shadow
I beheld their burning lust
Under the nightfall I die, again!
