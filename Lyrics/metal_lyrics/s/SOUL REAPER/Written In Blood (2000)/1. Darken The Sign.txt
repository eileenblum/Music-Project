In remembrance of the curse
and the fire in my flesh.
In this soul who slowly being destroyed
In every heartbeat, in every sign
Trembling a cry for war
In the depth's of the times alley
In the wildest confusion
Howls the unearthly wind
Whose undermines it all
Unto you I will concede
The Unborn is unleashed
Another horizon has risen.
- Invade the heavenly gate
[Chorus:]
The dream is dead
The final hour is near
The earthly surface are destroyed
Death, Satan, Antichrist
Say will you darken the sign?
... The sign
Darken the sign
The sign which has enlighten
The futile ones of "God"
The time is here to uncover
Two-thousand years of hallowed lies
I am two kinds of different spirits
As a death-bringing shadow
As a corrosive acid on your skin
- The truth became your final breath
[Chorus:]
The dream is dead
The final hour is near
The earthly surface are destroyed
Death, Satan, Antichrist
Darken the sign?

Darken the sign
The sign which has enlighten
The futile ones of "God"
The time is here to uncover
Two-thousand years of hallowed lies
