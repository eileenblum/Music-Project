Master, oh evil one
The night is getting darker now
Behold the souls who hides in the dusk
The silhouettes of your creation
The silhouettes of your wrath
Hell's fire burning endless
Your soul bleed in pain...
Can you hear the cries sound?
I am the enemy I've seen two sides of life
I've lived 'em both
[Chorus:]
So lick your wounds
You empty one
My hunt has only just begun
I will annihilate and dominate
amass the black sovereignty
So lick your wounds
You empty one
My hunt has only just begun
I will annihilate and dominate
amass the black sovereignty
In every wind I breed 
Thence my force
In every fire I burn
Rise ungodly ones
Bring life into... Bring life into my black heart
[Chorus:]
So lick your wounds
You empty one
I will annihilate and dominate
amass the black sovereignty
