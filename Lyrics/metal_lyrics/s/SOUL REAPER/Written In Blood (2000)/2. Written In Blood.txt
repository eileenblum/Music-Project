Enthralled, abducted and alone
Stricken by fear, awaiting the deathbells toll
The rebellious angel - recalled, the story has been
told
Underneath the soil
Were the ones who'll never will fall
The superiors of distinguished damnation...
Damnation
A pandemonium builds up inside
Fearless I stand with darkness strong by my side
A epoch of hallowed lies falls towards a shapeless
ground
A solemn night, to unite with a oncoming destiny
[Pre-chorus:]
Tempt by sin
Spellbound and riveted
In a burning chaos
So energetic and so dark
[Chorus:]
Words of vengeance, written in blood
A monstrous sight of the punish
Hers might, my eyes are paralyzed
Stare into the eyes of death, the
Center of chaos
Newborn flames feed on dreams
Of possessing the skies
The time has arrived for the storm to come 
Indeed its powerful, like fire against heavenly
blessings 
Poisonous powers infiltrate the souls of light
Flames an despair, dance now upon fields of roses
Feast now upon their life and beauty.
Your downfall were all written and foretold.
- I wrote in your book and you made me free
Blood and fire painted skies 
Death arrived with despair
To achieve the triumph of mine
I have found the way to my alliance
- Souls from below, guide my way through the
Labyrinth of affliction
Damnation arrived and gave the new age birth
The womb of light were crushed by the punishers
Might
Suffocate the universe and step out of time
- Spells of hell - Activate!
[Pre-chorus:]
Tempt by sin
Spellbound and riveted
In a burning chaos
So energetic and so dark
[Chorus:]
Words of vengeance, written in blood
A monstrous sight of the punish
Hers might, my eyes are paralyzed
Stare into the eyes of death, the
Center of chaos
Newborn flames feed on dreams
Of possessing the skies
