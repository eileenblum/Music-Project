Through the mist, into the fire
Through the burning realms of hell
I breeds in my blood, inhaling me from my inner
Entangled in the very womb of dark delight
A unearthly reach out for my soul
The came from nowhere and disappeared into nothingness
I circle around in empty spaces, without knowing why 
so vanished, so alone in the labyrinth of the deathlord.
I ride the beast, I set ablaze heavens arch, the
kingdom has 
Risen high
Power - by diabolic might, oh my heart longs to die!
- I am the deathlord, the vein of hell
I chain your soul by my empire
Your mind is in my possession now
[Chorus:]
In fear I flee
Towards a fate - unknown
Reaching the pains
External limit, am I reborn
I memorize the enormous drop of endless blood,
And by my souls end, my own curse step forth.
The came from nowhere and disappeared into nothingness
I circle around in empty spaces, without knowing why 
so vanished, so alone in the labyrinth of the
deathlord.
I ride the beast, I set ablaze heavens arch, the
kingdom has 
Risen high
Power - by diabolic might, oh my heart longs to die!
[Chorus:]
In fear I flee
Towards a fate - unknown
Reaching the pains
External limit, am I reborn
Unchain the claws of darkness
The day becomes the night
As a new dimension of life takes form
Now, the earth belongs to darkness
Reveal your unsurpassed might
Demon - inhale the ways of abomination
