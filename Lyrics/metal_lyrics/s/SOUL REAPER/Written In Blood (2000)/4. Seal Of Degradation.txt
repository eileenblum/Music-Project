I tear open the dark
I'm caught in the eye of illusion's
The eternal enemy towards all that is living
... Among the shadows and screams - I'm free
I roam in death - like black heavy clouds
[Pre-Chorus:]
Inner fire - in my veins - every life
Ends in pain
I wear the seal - and in my blood - 
The poison
Evil spirit - wicked one - undefeated
Master of the seal
[Chorus:]
- Don't open your eyes
Sleep, vanish and die
The seal of degradation
Hasten the dying eternity
Fear is my prison
I stand breathless before the endless
Night
Oh I can feel present of my death
Surrounding, embracing somewhere below
The seal - The glory in our souls
The guardian of our forthcoming triumph
Hell is my fortification
My mind is lethal under your banner
[Pre-Chorus:]
I wear the seal - and in my blood - 
The poison
Evil spirit - wicked one - undefeated
Master of the seal
[Chorus:]
- Don't open your eyes
Sleep, vanish and die
The seal of degradation
Hasten the dying eternity
Fear is my prison
I stand breathless before the endless night
