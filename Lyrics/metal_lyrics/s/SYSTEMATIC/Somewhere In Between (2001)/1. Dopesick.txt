Enter in this black cloud/keeps looking over his shoulder
No method to his madness/heavy is the world as he crashes down.

[Chorus:]
Hands down, this haunts you/so dopesick, I'll remain
Hands down, this haunts you/so dopesick.

More than he could bear now/some thought that he would not come around
Screaming for his blank space/could not wipe this from his face.

[Chorus]

Could never tell by the whites of their eyes.

[Chorus]
I'll remain
