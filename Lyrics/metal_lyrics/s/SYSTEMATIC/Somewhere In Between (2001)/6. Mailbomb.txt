I got your hate mail here/the perfect way to die/giving up your opinion/I'll give ya what I prescribe.
Down to size.
I got your hate mail here/I'm like a needle in your eye/can't deny your opinion/I'll give ya what I prescribe.

[Pre-chorus:]
This is beyond for real/it's beyond all of your repair/did you get the news?/no reprise when you're down there.

[Chorus:]
It brings you down
To my size.

I got your hate mail here/the perfect way to die/can't deny the messenger/can't rely solely on abuse.
Coming down my ugly truth/coming down just for your use/when it's in your face/all of me into you.

[Chorus]
