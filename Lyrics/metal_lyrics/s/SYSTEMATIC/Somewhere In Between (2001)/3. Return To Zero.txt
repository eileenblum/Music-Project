Break down got a hand on this solitude/sanctuary of your missed information.
Held down beaten by an attitude/and you're biting the hand that feeds.
It's all pretty when the truth doesn't look at you/in a prejudice that's brought on by anger.
Straight arrow bent by some circumstance/if you ever stood a chance, you would too.

[Chorus:]
If it's up to me/I'm forty-nine/I'll show you everything

I tore down this wall just to look at you/it's filled up with nothing but hollow.
If your life ever sunk down any deeper, you'd take your soul someplace new.

[Chorus]

You've been falling down/to never crawl again

[Chorus]

You've been falling down/never crawl again.
