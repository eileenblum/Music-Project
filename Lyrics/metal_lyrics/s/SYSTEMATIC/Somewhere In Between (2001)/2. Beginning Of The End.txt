So far its perfect/the clothes you wear/this won't concern you/just hurts a bit.
(I don't mind you playing God)
Blame you/no trust/came to

[Chorus:]
I know you'll be back again/time slows - beginning of the end.

Black eyes she'll cover/her broken mouth/she won't tell mother/just hurts a bit.
(I don't mind you playing God)
Blame you/no trust/came to/your life self-destructs.

[Chorus]

I know this complicates you now/say you're mine.

[Chorus]
The end.
