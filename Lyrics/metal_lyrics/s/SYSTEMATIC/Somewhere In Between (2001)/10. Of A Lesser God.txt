Obscene/unbecoming/and always look down/unclean/no returning/but it's so clear and so sound.
Between my shortcomings/a simple way out/it seems nothing's working/but this saves me from me.

[Chorus:]
Waste away inside/pulling with this tide/of a lesser God/it suits you fine.

Slip into subhuman/and phasing you out/pristine, no resurgence/you're in between the next life.

[Chorus]
I think it's safe to say/can't make it go away.
