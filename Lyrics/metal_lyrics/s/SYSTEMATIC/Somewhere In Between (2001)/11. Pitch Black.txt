Taste the colors that run over you/a touch of gray that numbs the mind.
Left me for dead, it fills my head/"Locked in here for good!," she said.
Grip the dark that funnels dimmest light/it turns my scream into a whisper.

[Chorus:]
My thoughts scream through me/no way this could be/nothing left to see.

Silence will become the death of me/in me head they speak in tongues.
Tear at my skin, it never ends/no words can save the shape I'm in.

[Chorus]
(I think I've seen the light).
