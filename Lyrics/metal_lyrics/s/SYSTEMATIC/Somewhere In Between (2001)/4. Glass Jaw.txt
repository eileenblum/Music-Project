It never threw me like this ignored/a head buried in the sand to retort.
If it ever came down to be a man or break my fall/peel back the skin again so I know.

[Chorus:]
And I wait, and I wait, to live this damn thing out.
And I wait, and I wait, to be the thing I never was before.

A head case I can't refrain all of my flaws/rebound or rationalize just to stall.
Well, I'm well aware and I think you care from your easy chair.
Remission is all that I can't afford.

[Chorus]
