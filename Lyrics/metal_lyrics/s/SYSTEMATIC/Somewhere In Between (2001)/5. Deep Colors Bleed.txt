Regress/possession/no likeness.
Impress/no virtue/in humbling.
In a room beyond the view you chose to tremble in/drawn and quartered institution/this place is set.

[Chorus:]
No feeling stronger than numbing/blankest expressions/your calling.

Repressed/adore you/they bought it.
Suggest/it's no use/lay dormant.
In a room beyond the view you chose to tremble in/reinventing Christ who died to make it make some sense.

[Chorus]
Calling you.
