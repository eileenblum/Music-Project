Thick skin, I'll break it to ya/bleed none and wallow in your
The bed they made for you.
Pushed further to resistance/it's hell when you still run to
The bed they made for you.

[Chorus:]
Fight yourself/down till you're well.

Thick skin, I'm mangled uptight/unwind and never survive
The bed they made for you.
Evolved into your monster/thick head, thick skin!
The bed they made for you.

[Chorus]
The bed they made for you!
You've become the lie/it eats you up inside/it's said and done/game over.

[Chorus]
