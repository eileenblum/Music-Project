Pulls me under/held me over/sets the tones to lose.
A taste of anger/no remainder/of the things we'd choose.
Crumpled over/my composer/just a skeleton/it turns me inward, but it figures/forever's a dirty word.

[Pre-chorus:]
Emotions wear my sleeve/this might be the last.

[Chorus:]
One or two ease the pain/it's nothing that we talk about.

No recollection/of complexion/could not place his face.
I plead redemption/or collection/put me into place.

[Chorus]
Ease the pain.

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
This might be the last.
