Red on her hands/remembers the blood they used to share.
Bleeding again/too many wounds she could not mend.
Bullet in hand/it's just not the gaze without the stare.
Washes her hands/and nothing remains the same in here.

If only you could be somewhere else inside of me.

[Chorus:]
Wake me up, I'm dead/is it something that I said?

Head in your hands/know that I could not just pretend.
Bleeding again and again/too many wounds she could not mend.
Bullet in hand/and nothing remains the same in here.

If only you could be somewhere else inside of me.
If only you could be somewhere dead inside of me.

[Chorus]
If only I could be somewhere else.
[Chorus]
