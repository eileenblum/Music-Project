You cannot swallow what you've seen/see me there before you/and if I heal in time/try not to stare too much.
Surrounded by tubes and things/this heart machine knows me well/when my lungs begin to fill up/don't turn away in sorrow.

[Chorus:]
Cause I've known this too long/when does death follow?/I am helpless, breathless/yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

Roll me over when I get sick/change my bed when I piss/drug me up when I'm screaming/I've had way too much of this.

[Chorus]

Put my bed down/Turn the lights down low/won't you kill me softly?/please delete my misery.

[Chorus]
Tomorrow.
