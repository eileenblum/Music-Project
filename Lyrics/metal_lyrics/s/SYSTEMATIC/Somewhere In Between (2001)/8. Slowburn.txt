This lets me serve your purpose/I claim what's mine and drown you/bloodletting your subconscious/a loss of all control.

And you serve them well.
I spread your life wide open, and you don't like what you see/this trepanning won't ease you/a loss of all control.

And you serve them well/trade yours in for gold/bought and sold.

[Chorus:]
I've come to reap this reward, I break you, forsake you, my time to even the score.

Controls your mind/give it time.
And you serve them well/trade yours in for gold/bought and sold.

[Chorus]
You served them well.
