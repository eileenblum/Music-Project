Down slowly, I take your sight
Blind you, its so divine
You burn, burn
All the bridges to me they're all damaged you see
And when you learn I'm your worst enemy
I plant the bad seed
Did you notice you can't control this?
I creep up inside to take yours
How does it feel to be infected with me?
You're holding onto your life
Knowing you've become all mine
You burn, burn, burn
I do what I please
I plant the bad seed
