So, do you feel what i feel when it all comes down?
I see it in your eyes
Throw, throw me a line so i won't drown
The shore just seems too far
Another callous on my heart
No, there's no way to stop
The sting when it comes apart
I realize who we are
No, no matter when it stops
The broken pieces cut my hands
Leaving only scars
Oh, we pretend we've got this all figured out
Not as sefish as we are
So, clear the dust off my soul as I fade out
You knew i wouldn't be here long
And I didn't want to lose
Or hope to understand
I fell right through your hands
Now there's nothing left to lose
My life crumbles in your hands
I live it over and over again
