Feeling kinda sick
Sick of all the things they do
Swaying with the wind
Tell me who is fooling who
I'm not changing for this changing world
And I'll live my life my own way
On and on they drag me on
I won't change for you
Shifting with the sands
See them sinking once again
Fairweathered till the end
They follow thier forgotten trends
