Once a child born not righteous
Never again will I speak the truth
Forever broken - my halo was bent down in two
My halo bent right before you
Never spoken - the scars that i can't hide
My pain inside - like suicide
My pain never dies
I never told you and it was right before you
If I told you what was on my mind?
Would you mind?
Deep within this dirty hole
They never let me go
They reach to pull my broken hope
To settle thier reckless home
