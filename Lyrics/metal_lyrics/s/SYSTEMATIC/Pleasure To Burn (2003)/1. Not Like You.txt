Hey man, I'm the stand you're on
Always preaching for nothing
Somehow you always seem to fall
In the cracks where I live
I'm not like you
So uplifted, hiding from the truth
I'm not like you
Overlooking all in front of you
I'm not like you
Hey man, I'm the trip you're on
An introduction to heaven
Not bad the way you find your God
You stare him down in the mirror
