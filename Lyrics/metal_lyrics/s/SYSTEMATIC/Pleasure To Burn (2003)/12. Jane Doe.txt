Hey Jane, cocaine and snakes take what you want
Jane, choke on the shame and come undone
Watch what you wish for
They might come for more
Oh you know the wicked will come
Picking, scratching, tearing you away
Hey Jane, you fucked your way to number one
Jane, you'll pay the price for what you've done
Jane, know the wicked will come
Hey Jane, when will you find what you want?
