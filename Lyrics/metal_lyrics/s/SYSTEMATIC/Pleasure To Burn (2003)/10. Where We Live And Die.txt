I can't hold on much longer with trembling hands
The days go by and break this broken man
And after all my years I watch it disappear
With my arms still wide open the black sets in
I want to leave me behind
Where we live and we die
Come and let the darkness take me over
There is no second chance that we can save the day
Consciousness comes and goes as I fade away
And after all my years I watch it disappear
With my arms still wide open my time sets in
I can feel my time set in
