As a child I set the freedom down
Guided my life about
I believed what you said when you said you loved me
Tried to smile I spent my life on trial
Another broken child
I pretend it's o.k. when you lie to love me
You're the wolf outside my door
And I swear you're waiting to break my soul
Don't you know?
I tried to live I tried to die
Placed your hands over my life
You tried to run you tried to hide
You're the watercure of life
As a man I played the game again
I tried to call you friend
As you kick in my face while you say you trust me
