Lock myself away
Free from insanity
Dirt is all i need
A love for apathy
I'll do it every night, till i get it right
I'll get by
I'll do it everytime, never comprimise
I'll get by
And I will never die cause
I get by
Don't come to my door
Your talk is such a bore
Don't need company
My vice is all i need
I'll play with all my sins
Indulge myself again
Need not you or me
So just leave me be
