Abhorrence of Human Life
Ablazed hunger for supremacy
Cherish the cold salvation knife
And your pure ideosyncrasy
Mindtravelling paths of darkness
And cruel halls of madness

The sky is darkened with white ill clouds

Winds of devaluation
Words on stones- desecration
Moonstorms blowing on the earth
Any seed of his rebirth
Now hear black voices singing
In the pure desert night
This wind of sorrow, oh this wind of fright

Breath - flowing Sands within your lungs
And the fresh air - of a new glorious dawn
Barbaric flames - from the fire of the world's tragedy
Which lies beneath your feet - as you are a disciple of Katharia

Destroying old plates of morality
Building up a higher empire
Katharia-world without endâ¦
