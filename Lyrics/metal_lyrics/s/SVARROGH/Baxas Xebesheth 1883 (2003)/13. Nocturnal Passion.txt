Beyond the fields of the ancient and old
And the realms of the unending golden halls
There is an old castle cruel and cold
With paintings of Antagonism on the walls
The stairs grimmly whisper and yawn
When the Knjaz (=FÃ¼rst)is stalking the night
With misantrophy into the darkend dawn 
With thirst in his eyes of stone and might

Is it the tree, is it the leaf - moments of clarity
Never will forget the fascination of the Black
The source of menacing nocturnal emotions

Candles burning in galleries of death
Mourning clouds embrace the monument
The Knjaz, the master of his own breath
And his will - the emperor's foundament

Is it the tree, is it the leaf - moments of clarity
Never will forget the fascination of the Black
The source of menacing nocturnal emotions

Vivo tibi morientur oculi, 
nec quidquam videbis,
nisi dormiens.
Aegritudo somnium affecit. 

Neque Cupiditas Dementii 
Neque Insania Cacitae 
Ecce ellychnium diluculorum.
Ecce - mea mens divina.

Cereus tuus finibus ambis ardet.
Vivo tibi morientur oculi, nec quidquam videbis, nisi dormiens.
