All the promises that we make
All the hope that we share
All we know and all we feel
Are like drops in the sea

All the faces that I forgot
All the fear that we left
All the fortune that we lost
All the answers that we don't know

All the places from where I escape
All the sadness that we waste
All we know and all we feel
Are like drops in the sea
