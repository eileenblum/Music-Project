I have kissed the summer dawn
before the palaces
nothing moved
the water lay dead.

Battalions of shadows
still kept the forest road
i walked, walking warm
and vital breath
while stones watched
and wings rose soundlessly.

...a clear pale light
...a flower who told me its name

I came upon the goddess
Then one by one
I lifted her veils
across the meadow
where I betrayed her to the cock.

I hunted her
And I hunted her!

And smelled the scent
of her immense body.

Dawn and the child fell together
at the bottom of the wood
When I awoke, it was noon.

Life was it really this?
Life!
