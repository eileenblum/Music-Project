Dying in a dark dimension
Suffering and suffering again
I dream with a southern night
Where the winter reingn my heart
I flight with invensibles enemies
But I know, that I'm the only one
Iwalk through suicide fields
I'm under a reign of tears
I dream with a endless sky
I dream with a southern night
I hate their burning eyes
I'm feeling so dark
In this infinite falls.
