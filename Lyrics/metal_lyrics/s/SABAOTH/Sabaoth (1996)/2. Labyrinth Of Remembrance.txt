Hear, hear their cry
Their grief is like a chain in my neck
The time, is nothing for them
It's only a path in this endless maze
Mourning wind, get away
Let me stand, in this misty place
Let me observe, this mournful landscape
A better perfume is in the air
The delicate breeze seduce me again
I take the path of rain
I'm on the labyrinth of remembrance
My brain is numb, but still my pain
Mourning wind get away
This is the escence of my grief
I wish I find the way
I wish I return to me.
