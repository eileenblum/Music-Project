In the fatality of my dreams,
I feel I fall into the mouth of the abyss
I no longer a conscience of mortality and time
Reality no longer exists
Time no longer exists
The hours seem to last centuries
The sensation of a strange presence invades me
A shadow appears nest to me
With penetrating eyes
An a phantasmagoric stare
It's the presence of CTHULU, the dragon
Of the abyss, Lord of Amenta
In a state of terrible agitation
My life changes unto that of a tormented animal
Like an attack of Licantropia
In those conditions, I enjoy my madness fully
I give up my hope for immortality
I get drunk with my evilness
And I give into fatality.
