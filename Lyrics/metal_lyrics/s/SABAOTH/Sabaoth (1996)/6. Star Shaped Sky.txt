Night of summer
Star Shaped Sky
The moon reflect
Their mystic and charms raid
That's passing through the trees
Of my lovely kingdom
Enchanted by the old wizard
They are unfiltered
Inside my soul and my actions
I'm part of they power
The fortune, now is mine
Enchanted by the full moon raids
Dancing around the fire
With the wizards
And the key of the obscurity
Join my eternal enchantment
To worship the misteries
Of my kingdom.
