Forces of hell
Appear in the deep
Of my dreams, and invite me
To the ceremony of the doomsday
The lost souls are
Prepare to the ceremony
The father and creator of evil
Start the offering ritual
Rites and pacts unknown to me
Are part of the offering of the new
Souls that there are fall
Diabolic forces possessing my acts
Forces of Satan take my soul
And I can't scape
Till that is my turn and begin my
Sacrifice and my eternal suffering.
