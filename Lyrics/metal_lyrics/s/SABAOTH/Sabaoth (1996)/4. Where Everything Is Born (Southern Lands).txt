I walk through the labyrinth of your words
From them the ways of corruption flow
Raise your hands upon me, now!
All my soul with your black light
Come to me, Oh! Darkness God
Shine so bright, group up my feith
Let us see you, mighty serpent
Thou, that pierce it all
The black is on you, on your throne
OUROBOROS, mighty, dark, one!
The man's day it's twilight, and then will see
And he will reign, so endlessly
I await, I watch out the time has come
Here where the winds blow
Only death is real!
Southern lands, Satan's throne
