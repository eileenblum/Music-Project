Break now through your deepest fear
And reward will be most disastrous awe
I eclipsed the sun and blind birds
Fell down to the ground like lead
I'll take al the human joy
Serve in submission...
Celebrate my darkened reign
A solemn shape will disguise the Phoebus god
I saw you dead
Like shreds of your unreal faith...
... and god
Alone as always
Taken from the ground my hate
In ecstacy and shame
The view shows me closer
To the end of god
Come back to the source of power
The darkest eye like the deepest well
Let bricks of my hate soak in virgin tears
I eclipsed your love and mercy
Setting back the clock to barbaric times
How horribly you smell now
Raise your god and kill each other
