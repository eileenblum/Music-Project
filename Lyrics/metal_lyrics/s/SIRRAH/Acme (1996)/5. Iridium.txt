So cold but shining
Shaped hard machine
Reaction out of reach
They're laid to sleep
And rust for years
Horizon leads their trip
Now construction dies
For the things time can't deny
Chrome
Fall out of step
Fall to the bottom
Distorted space
Sclerotium and scouring wire
Equal finish done
Dry sand into
My empty anger
Truth for delight...
