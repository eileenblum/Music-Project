Rainy mood haunts our minds looking through the agony
Depression brought by the darkest times
When hope is hard to feel
Tell me the truth of heart taht throbs in you
The rains they freeze me through
Then grief is like the wound
Drown in sin with pain that dwells within
When hopeless views are falling to the past
As hands not young and strong as before
We are in ruin
With the lack of hope, distrust, undying love
We lie among them bleeding
The truth of what will come from beneath
It dwells inside our hearts
Staring at my windows, black, I see nothing
But the end
No escape and no way out
Stay with me and force me to stay
Comfort me I live on the edge
Slave to my own grief
Do as you wish but I don't understand
How you could bear all this
Solitude is a complaint of nuclear tribes
Effusive feelings bring them down
No way to ease this pain when hope melts in rain
The tears from silent heaven
