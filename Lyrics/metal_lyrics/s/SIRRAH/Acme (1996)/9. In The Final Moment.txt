Here's the world I chose to lay down in
Here's my place of last relief
In its red burning towels
Salvation from foul deeds
The shelter that I crave for
The shelter that I crave for
It will protect me from your revenge

[Chorus:]
Defeats overfill my illusive stories
Another mission failed but the next one won't
I'll find you in the final moment
To make you bleed and crawl at my feet

The planet seems like it lost its life
Dissolution of my heart's empire
Empire!

Gone into ecstasy over burning ground
I left this world to seek another one
In the final moment
In the final moment

[Chorus]

Gone into ecstasy over burning ground
I left this world as smell to seek another one

Thanks to sauron for sending track #9 lyrics.
