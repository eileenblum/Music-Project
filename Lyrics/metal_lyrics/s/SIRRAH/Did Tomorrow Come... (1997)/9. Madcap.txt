To gnaw at the earth till losing breath
Dipped in velocity of time
So close to despendency I chew the bricks
Agat barks no longer,
cold blade rips the bowels open

All of a sudden there is only darkness outside
It's so hard to smuggle this tiny bit of light
All of a sudden there is only darkness outside
It's so hard to smuggle this tiny bit of light
I pace on toes up and down the abandoned rooms
Wrenching last memories away from the walls

I tear to pieces all of your clothes,
Abominable rags
I throw tehm through the window,
I throw tehm all
Not to watch, not to smell them
Anymore
I set the fire to the photographs
Observe the way they burn
The faces get disfigured, hands become distorted

All of a sudden there is only darkness outside
It's so hard to smuggle this tiny bit of light
All of a sudden there is only darkness outside
It's so hard to smuggle this tiny bit of light
I pace on toes up and down the abandoned rooms
Wrenching last memories away from the walls

Even if the tablecloth became red
The fierce and cruel words will not change anything
I can feel that my knees bend
On steps of the staircase to...
Nowhere
Nowhere
Nowhere
Nowhere

The spout soon gets clogged with the sharp
prickles of my hair
My hands still remain dirty,
cannot wash them clean
Water calms down, traquility suurounds me
I am at last ready to say good-bye...
All my veins are open it for you
I'll give out every single drop of my blood!!!

Even the tablecloth became red
The fierce and cruel words will not change
anything...
