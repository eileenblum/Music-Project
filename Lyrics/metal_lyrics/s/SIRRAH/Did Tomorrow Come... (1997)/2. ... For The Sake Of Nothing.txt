I have come here in order to hate
Destroy
Plunder and murder
To make a sacrifice to fight for lost
Purity
That is my burden
To achieve success it takes the death
Of several thousand people
Or even more
The tyranny of the talented oppressors
Will introduce order and law

You that fight in the name of salvation
Stand together
Shoulder to shoulder
My fingers like the deadly daggers
I'm ready to set forth
When the time is right
And tremple in the enemy
I'm ready to...

Announce the coming of victory and glory
Announce the coming of victory and glory
Announce the coming of victory and glory
Announce the coming of victory and glory

A small hunk of stale bread
is greedily mixed up with saliva
Water runs slothful in thirsting
mouth to cease being alive
Frightened words un certainly
compose the stanzas of a prayer
To forefathers, earth and the near
Asking to swiftly come here

Some scraps of recollections
Milk in mother's breast
for the conceived child
Hot lips that long to feel...

You that fight in the name of salvation
Stand together
Shoulder to shoulder
My fingers like the deadly daggers
I'm ready to set forth
When the time is right
And tremple in the enemy
I'm ready to...

Announce the coming of victory and glory
Announce the coming of victory and glory
Announce the coming of victory and glory
Announce the coming of victory and glory
Scraps of recollections
Milk in mother's breast for the conceived child
Hot lips to feel the passion
Kiss strong don't sleep at night
Face chared with the sun
Gleam of hope in the eye
That dims every day
Will there be enough strenght to survive???
