Inside a cage of my own ribs
All the breaths are caught in their trap
Gloom flows still from interstice and blinds me
coats my eyes
I climb the spokes
Of cold slippery ladder
To reach the triumph at any price
Higher and higher
Let the river burst its banks
Rise up from torpid enfeebled body

Lash is a separate independent being
Dearer to the godly heart than human ever was
From the birth to the moment of death we fall
Losing gestures, thoughts, feelings, and words
No breather
No breather
Dashing along
On and on and on...

Gloom flows still interstice
and blinds me, coats my eyes
Let the river burst its banks
Rise up from torpid body

Higher and higher
Let the river burst its banks
Higher and higher
Rise up from torpid, enfeebled body...
... and there will shine a light
Out of a cage
I'll force my way
Through the imprisoning bars
Forward
The beast of burden
Lash is a separate independent being
Dearer to the godly heart than man ever was
From the birth to the moment of death we fall
Losing gestures, thoughts, feelings and words
No breather
No breather
Dashing along
On and on and on...
