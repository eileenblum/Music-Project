I rip from the sheets of my bed
the stories of defeats
I tear them away
from the smiling throat that bleeds

One motion of my hand and tenderness is leaving
And you wait patiently till it stops beating
Stops pumping,feeling and causing dreadful pain
Requests get stuck in larynx,
Crush it with their weight
For so many years...never...never told!
There was only one such a day
On which I saw
Happiness in your eyes
Still and gazing at who knows what,oh what!
And so little did you need
to restore your peace of mind

In your clenched fist
You try to hide your fingers
I ask about the sky
You say nothing!
Hear your heavy breathing...
Oh Dad, say something!

I'd like to offer you
Freedom, respect and fame
Almost everywhere, I will recognize your name
Mouth becomes filled up with blood
that runs in a hurry
To congeal in the cold floor

There was only one such a day
On which I saw
Happiness in your eyes
Still and gazing at who knows what,oh what!
And so little did you need
to restore your peace of mind
