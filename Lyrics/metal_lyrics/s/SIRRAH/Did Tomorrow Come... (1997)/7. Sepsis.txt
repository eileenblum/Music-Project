Read the words from my silent lips
The static screenplays of your agony
All hidden phobias will rise from within us
So kiss the dust from a little mirror
To see my light through the scud of time
A silver ray will lead the path
I'll take away what fate brought
Please let me in your life's tragedy
So I could write an end of our story

Something enters me from the outside
With a ghastly graze it rips the heart
I watch reflection in the mirrors of her eyes
Needle feeds all nightmares
Shots one after one
I see destruction in the center of it all

Among the liars similar tendencies
To rip every bright thought like paper to the shreds
Allow your heart to lose its rhythm
Drown deep within me

Another chapter overfilled with fear of a starving
human wreck begins...
With paralyzing thrill
Among the lines I hid all substance
Find it as your deathbed's waiting
Reach outside through veil of fear
Your heart beats within me!!!

So kiss the dust from a little mirror
To see my light through the scud of time
A silver ray will lead the path
I'll take away what fate brought
Please let me in your life's tragedy
So I could write an end of our story
Enter me now
Blow up the door
Do what you've promised

Reach outside through veil of fear
Your heart beats within me!!!
