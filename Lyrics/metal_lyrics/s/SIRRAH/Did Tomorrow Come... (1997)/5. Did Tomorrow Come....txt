I wait for energy and donor
But there's not much time to wait

I lose my contact with reality
I can't recognize my face
Can't tell my eyes, my lips, my hair
I don't remember any friends
Oh, why nobody wants to come?

Never before was I so scared
Of the embraces and too small rooms
Under pressure of while, cold walls
I feel like I'm short of breath

The atmosphere of sweat and creased bedclothes
A threnody of medicine fills the air
The atmosphere of sweat and creased bedclothes
A threnody of medicine fills the air

I push my way towards the light
Through the corridors so winding and so narrow
I push my way towards the light
Through the corridors so winding and so narrow
An old man in the gateway
He offers me immortality
An old man in the gateway
He offers me...
Immortality

An old man in the gateway
In return he wants only:
My toes, feet, legs, stomach, chest, hands,
fingers and my neck
His promised: "I won't need anything any longer"
I give him everything
I cross threshold; sems like I've been here before
The Future, the Past, the Present
Oh,
Did tomorrow come?
Did tomorrow come?
Did tomorrow come?
Did tomorrow come?
