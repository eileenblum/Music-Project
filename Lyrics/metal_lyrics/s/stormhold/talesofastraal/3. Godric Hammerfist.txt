I am a lawbreaker, chance taker
Son of a swords-maker
Captured at last by the men I swore to serve

Kneel for me, steal for me
Work out a deal for me
Finally punished
I get what I deserve

Imagine all that I could have done
(Born to run)
Imagine freedom for me and jail for my only son

Punch and twist Godric Hammerfist
They are here to watch you die
Enter the ring, the audience sing
You're a slave to the will of Astraals King

Punch and twist Godric Hammerfist
Be a warrior, face the cheers
Lost and defeated, fragile and beaten
A fist from the ground appears

I am a plain walker, smooth talker
Friend to the moon barker
Starving alone, in my godforsaken cell
Trust in me, thrust in me
Wake up the lust in me
Jump in the pit and you're welcome to my hell

Imagine all that I could have done
(Born to run)
Imagine freedom for me and jail for my only son

Punch and twist Godric Hammerfist
They are here to watch you die
Enter the ring, the audience sing
You're a slave to the will of Astraals King

Punch and twist Godric Hammerfist
Be a warrior, face the cheers
Lost and defeated, fragile and beaten
A fist from the ground appears

Imagine all that I could have done
(Born to run)
Imagine freedom for me and prison for my father and son

Punch and twist Godric Hammerfist
They are here to watch you die
Enter the ring, the audience sing
You're a slave to the will of Astraals King

Punch and twist Godric Hammerfist
Be a warrior, face the cheers
Lost and defeated, fragile and beaten
A fist from the ground...

Punch and twist Godric Hammerfist
Be a warrior, face the cheers
Lost and defeated, fragile and beaten
A fist from the ground (fist from the ground, fist from the ground) appears
