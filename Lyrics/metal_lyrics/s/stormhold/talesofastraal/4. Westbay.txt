Get on your horses, we're riding towards the east
We bring the thunder, the ones, expected least.
Boats fill the oceans and dragons will crowd the skies
Westbay will save the world from it's demise

On a path down from heaven through hells fiery seas
We bring a musical beast
Slaughter the posers, metal will rise, for sure you will see by night

Westbay we call 
Straight through the hall 
Forced by the night 
Forever fight

Westbay we call (raise up your fists to the sky)
Straight through the hall (angels and demons will cry)
Forced by the night (we resurrect while you die)
Forever fight

Open the gate, Stormhold have now arrived
Conquering the west, leaving Astraal for a while
So crank up the amps, breaking boundaries never seen
Get up on stage, fill your venom with rage for an
instant thrill before the kill
Metal is what you will feel

Westbay we call (raise up your fists to the sky)
Straight through the hall (angels and demons will cry)
Forced by the night (we resurrect while you die)
Forever fight

Westbay we call 
Straight through the hall
Forced by the night
Forever fight
