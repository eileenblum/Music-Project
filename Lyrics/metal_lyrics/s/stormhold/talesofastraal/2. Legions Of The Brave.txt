Legions of the brave 
Is this his final journey? 
HeÂ´s riding south, to face his destiny! 
To find, a siege, as strong as steel 
Stormhold prestige, is what heÂ´ll see! 
And you will pray 
If you want us to stay 

Cry out legions of the brave 
The king has turned my land insane 
A brand new world 
A brand new world will Rise! 

Now he stands, with thousand men behind his back again, 
Stormhold victory 
Looking for more, to pull justice for his former men..now you must.. 

See, this kingdom is built on madness, 
Now , it will be mine 
(Now we must fight) 
Fight til the last man standing 
Prepare to die, 
And you will die 
All the soldiers will cry 

Cry out legions of the brave 
The king has turned my land insane 
A brand new world 
A brand new world will Rise! 

Cry out (cry out), Legions (legions), Cry out (cry out)..of the brave 
Cry out (cry out), Legions (legions), Cry out (cry out)..of the brave 
We are legions of the, we are legions of the, we are legions of the brave 
We are legions of the, we are legions of the, we are legions of the brave 
We are legions of the, we are legions of the, we are legions of the brave
