Brother, oh brother, here you sit sharing cell with plaguing rats
My plan is complete, you I've finally beat, I'm the new king of the land

Your son did escape, I assume that his faith was to die by his own hands

With no heir to the throne, I will rule all alone
And no-one can stand in my way

I will let you live, and make you kill your friends in my new game
Away from the fame, you got a new name, you will never be the same
So take you sword and use your list, arise... Godric Hammerfist
