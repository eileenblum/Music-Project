Sunrays hit my eyes as I'm running through the open door
My blood is pumping, I'm confused, must hide until the night falls
Hopefully I'm unknown to the people on the street
Let me find an alley, I must rest my bleeding feet's

Soon I am free, out of reach from my uncles misery
Let the Gods show the way, I must stay alive and take the throne one day

Darkness lies upon the streets, the moon must guide my way
Moving fast towards the gate, I hope this is my faith
The moment I've been waiting for is just some steps away
The guard is busy, thank you God, this is my lucky day!

Before my eyes, the sun will rise, a wonderous sight, a new world has opened
Now I see, my destiny, feeling free, the nature is calling

Soon I am free, out of reach from my uncles misery
Let the Gods show the way, I must stay alive and take the throne one day

Finally out of the town, must find a way to the crown
Just stay alive for a while will live in the forest for unknown time
