Hear the tone in my voice
I leave you no choice
Command to defend
Or all good will end

Now the battle is near, the monster is here
So honour your call, or Astraal will fall

I am falling down
And they want me to smash the ground
I am falling I am finally ready
(They) Rush to the gates of Astraal to keep me out!

Raised as king of the land, obey my command
or face your own fates, your justice awaits

Search yourself for a while
Prepare for your trial
The circle complete
In Astraal defeat

Thousand marching out to fight a single man
no-one stops to watch the beautiful land
turning meadows to sand again

Get out, get out, go!
Your royal roughness!
