With a stone this place was born
all these dreams of instant ruling
the calm before the storm
through handcraft this kingdom starts to grow
hell unleashed and winds began to blow

Welcome to our Paradise
hands to the skies
STORMHOLD will rise!

Conquer lands along the road
vanquish those who stand before us
FIRE AND RELOAD!
With places marked and even signed
Keep complete are always in our minds

Now the storm is calming down
Stormhold soldiers fought so bravely
for country, king and crown
Now there's a place for everyone
The royal kingdom have been set and done

Welcome to our Paradise
hands to the skies
STORMHOLD will rise!
