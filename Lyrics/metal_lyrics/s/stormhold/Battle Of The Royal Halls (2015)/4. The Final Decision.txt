Finally I've decided to walk against my fatherland
It has been years since I last was home, now I must claim my throne

Legions o Stormhold, and the rest of the world
Please hear my final call
We must march united as one, towards Astraals fall

Adventure lies before me when I must gather friends around
Building an army, that blessed from above
Sending the king to the kingdom below!

Legions o Stormhold, and the rest of the world
Please hear my final call
We must march united as one, towards Astraals fall
