The glorious days are now fading away
The kingdom is covered in darker shades
The kingdom, a snake, has taken to the throne
A man of evil, to the world unknown

Pray! Oh people pray, I am a God who decides your fate
Obey, you shall obey, don't wait for a savior, its to late!

I am your.. KING

His brother he sits six feet under the floor
Chains round his hands, not a king anymore
Don't care 'bout the throne of the things to be done
He screams out in anger: Where is my son?!

Pray! Oh people pray, I am a God who decides your fate
Obey, you shall obey, don't wait for a savior, its to late!

Voices from a darker world, whispers in his head
When he stands before them, a mass so unaware
Of the plans he made up in his mind, not of the good kind
With a strong voice, he shouts to them: Listen you are mine

Kneel before your master (Bow down for your king)
