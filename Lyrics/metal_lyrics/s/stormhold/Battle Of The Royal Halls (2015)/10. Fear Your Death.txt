Now I've gathered the legions from Stormholds mighty reich
Finally I'm strong enough to take what is mine
The banners held high, the shield on the flags fills the men with pride
Only the brave will stand in our line

A long walk lies ahead, over desert plains
The day's hot as hell and nights freezing cold
Our men are tired, hungry but their courage never falls
They will stand strong, against the Astraal force

FEAR, fear me my king
YOUR, your fate has arrived
DEATH, will take you home

The majestic walls of Astraal is rising before our eyes
Finally we're here, our journey has come to an end
The tactics are set, we will attack when the sun comes down
Arrows of fire will light, light up the sky

FEAR, fear me my king
YOUR, your fate has arrived
DEATH, will take you home
