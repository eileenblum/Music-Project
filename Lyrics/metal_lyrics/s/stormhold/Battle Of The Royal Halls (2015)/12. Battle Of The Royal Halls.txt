When our story started, our hero was a boy, so young and lost
Now he's marching like a man, a king, where he was born
His fathers kingdom once so glorious
Must slay the beast that ruling over us

The long forgotten son, has returned
Like a savior he rides into a world
Full of darkness and pain, he brings light
Fearless marching towards his final fight

His uncle waiting in the throne room for his time to be, to be judged
Suddenly the door is opening up, and there he stands, at alst
The room is quiet and the atmosphere is tense
The king is looking at him and he says

I see you have returned, the one I hunt
I gave your father his life, but yours I want
You don't have the strength to stop me now
I will finish you fast, kill you at lat

Hate, I feel hate, when I see you all I feel is hate
Pain, I feel pain, all the things you've done drives me insane
The throne, the throne is mine, take the crown off kneel 'cause you are done
Die, now you will die, you final time has come now die

Fight, he must fight
The most important battle of his life
Rage, filled with rage
Now he will fulfill his faith

The swords did clash in the royal halls, but suddenly our hero falls
He rise and strikes with a mighty roar, he knocks his uncle to the floor

Speech: With great power he sticks his word into the king's heart
The last beats echoes in the hall
He falls to his knees and realize...it's finally done

So this is the end, of our tale
Astraals people are free once again
A crowd stands on the street, cheers for him
When he rides with the head of their old king
The greatest victory, in history
Our hero finally beholds the crown and ring
