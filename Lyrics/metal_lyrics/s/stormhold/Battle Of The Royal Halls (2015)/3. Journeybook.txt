Another word, I'm on the other side
I will be heard traveling far and wilde

Past valleys deep, far to the mountains hights
Through cliffs, I leap over the land I fly

Tun to the portal, even if the Gods decide
That I'm not immortal, I won't let my bloodline die
Even if the stars align

Eyes on the curve
I won't believe in a judgemental world
Bring me my Journeybook

As I became, one with the natures force
Just like the rain, reflecting on the ancient lores

Don't make a sound, silence is now thy lord
I'll stand my ground, trusting in my bow and sword

This is a part of me
Still I feel a hole within my chest
My destiny, tells me to move forward

In a different direction
I will not be frighten by an ancient infection
I won't let my bloodline die
Even if the stars align

Even if calling, I will be as far away
Like wolfs in the morning, not another day!

In my wildest fantasy I'd never imagine
Something as beautiful as this
I won't muss
My journeybook
