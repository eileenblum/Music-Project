On ghetto to the next
Our takeover of the bay
Started out in E.P.A.
Now we've migrated up north
To the land of Hunter's point
In H.P. - bags will flow
Spazz is on the creep - way down low
unstoppable
We're coming up like hovercrafts
All day sessions at the dish
Doublerock junkies got on the list
Eleven five
Deep in our fucking pockets
Never caught without bullet poroof vests
We'll put our knowledge to the test
We've been working overtime
Out to plan the perfect crime
Old battleground - well ran dry
So we've moved to fertile soil
Nordic seeds are finally sewn
