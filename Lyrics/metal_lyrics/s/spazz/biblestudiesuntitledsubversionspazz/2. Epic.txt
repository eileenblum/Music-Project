Waging war on a plant
Deciding who can &amp; can't
Use a natural remedy
Imposing superficial laws on me
Life grows eternally from the soil
Man-made laws regulations spoil
A chance to learn from our own planet
Nature's illegal time to ban it
It's such a fucking joke
To think that we just want to toke
Words can't rule nature's world
Your vanity is so absurd
Fuck your factories filled with slaves
Crafting synthetic graves
Respect for land can't be found
Get close to Mother six feet underground
No respect for this planet
No reigns on natural selection
No sense in human nature
No, your words mean nothing
