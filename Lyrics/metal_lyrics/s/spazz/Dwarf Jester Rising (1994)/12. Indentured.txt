Forgotten &amp; ignored
Out of sight, out of mind
Mistreated &amp; bored
No shred of dignity ~~left to find

Discarded &amp; trapped
"You'll be happier with people your own age"
Never going back
Heartbreak transforms into rage

Retirement home, stagnant breath
Loved ones await a lonesome death
But soon you're next
