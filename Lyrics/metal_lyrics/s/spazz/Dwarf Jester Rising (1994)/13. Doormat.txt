Why do you choose this life?
Endless beatings, endless strife
Welcome their abuse
As if you deserve it
Afraid to stand your ground
The threats keep you silent
Where is the love?
All you see is hate
Let them take control
Imprisoned by your own fear
Conscience
Dictates
Your actions
Because you
Refuse to
See that only you can free yourself from this
