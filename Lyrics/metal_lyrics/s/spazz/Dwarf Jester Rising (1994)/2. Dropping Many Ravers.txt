Designer drugs
Fashion victims
Fucked up music
Fucked up minds
You are dead

Waste your time
In trendy clubs
Waste your mind
On trendy drugs
Worthless body
Take up space
We'll do without you

Try to bite our culture
Just here for the trend

If you want to step to O.A.K
Be prepared cause we'll take no shit
If we see you on the fucking street
Your ass will get bent

Trip on this
The feeling on my fist
In your face
End the rave
