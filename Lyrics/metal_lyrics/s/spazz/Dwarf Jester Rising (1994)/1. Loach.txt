Always following someone else
Carried in a current of intolerance
New ideas deflected away
By mass acceptance of tradition

Break the old school, of thought
Sick tradition, meant to break
A regimes built on ignorance
Mired in a sea of hate
Why does it, still exist?
Nothing left but, to resist
Educate, smash their state of rules
&amp; evil stereotypes
Why is this shit still allowed today?
