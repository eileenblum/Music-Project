Self-proclaimed punk king of the net
I hope carpal tunnel is all that you get
The monitors glow is your only light
Beat your meat to your own website
Chatroom junkie,
Social flunkie
Rule the scene from inside your room
You're safe inside your cyberwomb
Never been to a hardcore show
Got a zillion megabytes but nowhere to go
