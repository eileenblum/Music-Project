Deliverance journey comes alive
Bayou skate park ain't no jive
Acid burnt one-eyed dog hillbilly festering bump
On a long one arm
Asshole short fuse lit
Flipping tables talking shit
Wife in back wading through trash
All we wanna do is thrash
Dirt the purity
That's for sure
Decomposing rotten stench
Gotta go, gotta go
Little boy's room house of horrors
