"Back in the day"
That's all you say
What is now hardcore was once called metal
Over-produced like night ranger
Your "old style" punk sounds like '80s glam
Don't pretend you're "old-school"
If you don't know the roots
If this really was the 80s
You'd be under someone's boots
You'd get beaten
If you played what you now play
Back in the day
