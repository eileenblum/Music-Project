This is just hardcore, can't you see?
This style dates back before 1980
The Fix, Neos &amp; Youth Korps,
Too played fastcore in '82
Fast hardcore has always been around
In every country it can be found
The scene owes a lot to BCT
He got fast hardcore to everybody
Neon Christ &amp; Negative FX
Are constantly in my tape deck
I always loved Googol Plex
And who could forget Protes Bengt
I'm a fiend for fast hardcore
Always needing more
Play fast or die
