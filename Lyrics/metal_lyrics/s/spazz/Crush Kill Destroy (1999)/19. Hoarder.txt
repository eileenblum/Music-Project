I've got copies of everything
Every pressing
Every color
Even the penis-shaped picture disc
So I'm not the only dick
Put that down!
Don't get fingerprints on the cover
Every record is my lover
Every rarity I've pursued
Is fondled nightly when I'm nude
I'm a whore for vinyl
Need more
Still need the limited metal box
And the LP hole is small enough for my cock
My possessions, owning these goods
Makes up for my lack of manhood
