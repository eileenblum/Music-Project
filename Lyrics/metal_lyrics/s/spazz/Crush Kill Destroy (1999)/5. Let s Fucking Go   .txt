Go! is a word that defies definition
It needs no clarification
Go! is the foundation of hardcore
But for me it means so much more
Go! it can signify a chorus or a fast part, too
A sing along with my friends or a heavy
Breakdown
Let's fucking Go!

So c'mon man, don't be ashamed screaming
"Go!" is not a game
And for all the bands
Who don't say it
You are so fucking lame
1-2-3
Go!
Next time you are at a show
And the crucial moment arrives
Point your finger and shout Go!
The word Go! is for everyone
And to say it is so much fun
But the emo kids hate it
Next time you are at a show
And the crucial moment arrives
Point your finger and shout Go!
