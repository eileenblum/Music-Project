Your crew ain't shit
Your style ain't shit
Your band ain't shit
Your sponsor ain't shit
Are these measures of someones character or are these charades just rules we play
So your band is now king of the scene or your crew is running the city
But you are still a piece of shit
All these things look real nice
But none of them changes who you are
Strip your achievement away you're still a fucking loser
