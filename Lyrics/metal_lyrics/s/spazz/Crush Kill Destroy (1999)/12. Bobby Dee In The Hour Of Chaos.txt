Marilyn's Paul and all is swell
Bobby Dee is stoked as hell
Cruising through the record racks
Whistling Dixie jokes are cracked
Doesn't pay to be nice you see
Just ask my pal Bobby Dee
Extend your hand and say hello
Pudgy's met with fatal blow
Yelling just like kalmex
Bobby Dee
No skills to flex
911's what he screams
Body slammed
Ripped pant seams

Broken records
Broken teeth

Rasputin's buys the funeral wreath

Bobby Dee
Bobby Dee
