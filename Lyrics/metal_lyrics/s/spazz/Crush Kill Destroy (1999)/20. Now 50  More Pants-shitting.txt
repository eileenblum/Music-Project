You say that you "got Jewed"
When you haggle over money
Well, I've got news for you ...
That isn't fucking funny
Nothing makes me laugh
If it's based on a victim saying something so fucked,
You might as well have kicked 'em
Why is it so common in this "PC"
Scene to say stupid shit in mixed company
Using racial and ethnic slurs again and again
It isn't "less bad" when you only say it to your friends
Ethnic jokes of any kind
Are like olestra for the mind
