He'd been dulling the knife for too long
Walking pupa wings still curled
If called pathetic
He used to argue

Pitched plant seedlings he's thrown away

Filled with rage, filled with rage
Filled with rage, filled with rage
Filled with rage at himself

Ha can't believe he'd walked in such circles
No more
Now he's ready, poised for hunger
No longer can he rely
On any other person than himself

Now he's ready, poised for hunger
No longer can he rely
On any other person than himself

Filled with rage, filled with rage
Filled with rage, filled with rage
Filled with rage at himself
