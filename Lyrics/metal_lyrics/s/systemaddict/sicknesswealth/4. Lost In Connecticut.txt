As photos slowly fade away
And carbon clutter piles higher
The phone it rings all goddamn day
Deception, frustration, desire

Zeros link slowly form a chain
1-800- why call it?
Your credit? threats while you waste away
Their patience as thin as your wallet

Wolves at the door, wolves at the door

Sadness lasting, quite contrasting
To times of the past
Strange disaster, falling faster
Rut so very vast

Love only love keeps the pain at bay

The eerie chill, goals unfulfilled
And questions from the children's eyes
And nothing seems to be good enough

Love only love keeps the pain at bay

He cries she tries
The eerie chill, goals unfulfilled
And questions from the children's eyes
And nothing seems to be good enough
