He wants it, you've got it
He knows he can't have
But this doesn't stop him from watching tiny films
In which certain actions play upon the screen
Frustration always quick to accompany them

Plagued inside by the urge
Surge of power that he can't stop
Flower it does into a stress confess
His eyes do give'm away in a second realize
Do you?, do you?

Animal
He wants you dead
And her he wants to have
And she wants it, you've got it
She knows she can't have
But this doesn't stop him from watching tiny films
In which certain actions play upon the screen
Frustration always quick to accompany them

Plagued inside by the urge
Surge of power that he can't stop
Flower it does into a stress confess
His eyes do give'm away in a second realize
Do you? Do you?

Can you see it, can you see it
Can you see it, can you see it
Shining through, shining through, shining through
Can you see it, can you see it
Can you see it, can you see it
Shining through, shining through, shining through

Shining through
