Slowly â yet steadily 
the curtain for mankind falls 
Like chariots, unmanned, we ride 
straight towards the chasm 

(And) just as sure, as the wind blows 
our great walls will crumble 
We are drawn â like poison from a wound 
now only emptiness remains 

We have abandoned; cast our rights away 
We have run our course 
The final chapter; is closing near 
as vultures circle to feed 

Like chariots, unmanned, we ride 
straight towards the chasm 

This world shall fall!
