We are men of a thousand faces 
of the motionless mask 
underneath which a battle is raging 
and danger lies in losing grasp 

We must burn our boats; to leave behind 
the shores of our damnable past 
as we take a deep breath; through the fog 
that used to suffocate 

What's done is done; the dice were cast 
and the only path before us lies 
striding towards the riches of a new dawn 

But before we can relinquish 
the strangleholds of the past 
we must one last time revisit 
Those depths, where we hardly dare go 

Enter the mind! 
a bottomless pit of inspiration 
a bottomless pit of sorrow as well 
One must watch his steps 
not to fall in self-deception 

(Where) we once gave in 
To endless waves of melancholy 
The weight of the world 
and the torment of troubled souls 

There is no turning back now; to what once was 
As hardship transformed; the path has been forged 
Pain led to knowledge and insight 

So revel while you can; in the dusk of the past 
as a new dawn; grand; rejuvenous 
emerges through our hands 
Revel ye pity humans; in the dusk of the past 
as a new dawn emerges; emerges 
through our hands 

Therein lies hope; therein lies strength 
built on the ashes of the old world 
Therein lies life; therein lies meaning; therein lies strength 
as the sun of a new dawn engulfs the skies
