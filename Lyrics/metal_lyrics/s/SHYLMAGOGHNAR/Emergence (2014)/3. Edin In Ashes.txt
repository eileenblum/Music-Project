Bitter is the taste of my contempt for those 
protecting their dreamscape; as such becoming foe 
of humanity and reason; for truth they can't endure 
Reality denied; like sick that fear the cure 

I paint myself with the blood of life 
so cruelly culled by the hands of Adam 
Armed with hate and malice; for millennia to come 
and with the vengeance of that 
which will be coldly laid to waste without regrets 

I can no longer sit back and watch 
whilst this abomination takes its course 

Unknowing was our kind, when he was made to be 
a demon in holy skin, whose light has blinded ever since 
and inspired foolishness for generations to come and last 

Life just runs its course; no entity to blame 
No swarm of spiteful locusts, to plunder in his holy name 
I've seen both past and future; the rape of life to be 
So I will do what must be done; revealed to me 

Visions of mass destruction 
amassing strength within my soul 
A cage to hold the fury 
of the grim works beyond my grasp 
I can see their temple of Lies 
appearing in front of me 
An empire of wrath and exile 
which was never supposed to be 

The glorious destruction of both religion and mankind... 

Edin lifeless in ashes lies 

Then I found myself in a courtyard 
A thousand eyes accusing me 
To rally the course of the future and more 
for countless new horrors the way made free 

There is no action without consequence 

As I freed myself from the clutches of guilt 
One cannot change what has been done 
The lesson learned alas my friends 
the battleâs never, ever, truly won! 

A man must fall to rise again.
