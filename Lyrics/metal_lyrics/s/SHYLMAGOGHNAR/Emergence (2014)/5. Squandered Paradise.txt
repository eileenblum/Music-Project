Humankind has squandered the gifts that Mother gave 
A world of wealth and plenty; led to an early grave 
And paths to so-called 'progress' with blood of millions paved 

Utopia soon out of reach 
as swords grew mightier than the plough 
Such promise of superiority 
tell me - where are we now? 

Bloodletting a planet and culling our own lives 
Caught in the wake of our self-destruction 

Hail the glorious humankind â Hail! 
hail the splendour of our kind! 

Hail the glorious mankind! 

Lack of understanding; about responsibility 
The kind we are so eager to avoid 
Evermanipulating - the bringers of war and woe 
A travesty within the cosmic scale 

Our legacy is fraught with death 
Battle-ridden and paid for in blood 
True bringers of violence and flame 

A tyranny of intellect; a vile manifestation 
An error of the universe; harbingers of damnation 
As history repeats itself time upon time 
and still we fail to learn 

Unworthy of the air we breathe; unworthy of our pride 
unworthy of our power; so gleefully abused 
Our kind stands here accused; of squandering it all 
We've been weighed; and swiftly found unworthy 
Weighed and found unworthy; of it all 

Evermanipulating - the bringers of war and woe 
A travesty within the cosmic scale 
Squandered paradise...
