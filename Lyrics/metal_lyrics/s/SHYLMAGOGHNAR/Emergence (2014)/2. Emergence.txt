Entrapped between matter and chaos 
Where the future and past are as one 
In my dreams I have seen a reflection 
Of the unworld that is to become 
I sought knowledge inside this arcanum 
And perhaps I have travelled too far 
For a vision so bitter and horrid 
Now forever my soul enscars 

Relieved from the Shell of Unessence 
I awoke in a barren scape 
Engulfed by the desperate struggle 
Of a world becoming a grave 
I wandered up a dreaded hill 
What I saw there my heart afroze 
A weeping tree as black as ash 
Where humongous stormclouds rose 

I stared at the sorrowful creature 
Feeling what it had seen and known 
Now at the end of all creation 
Tears of blood from its branches flow 
A figure in gloom then appeared to me 
Underneath him the ones that I loved 
And with inhumane voice he declared to me 
That my life was paid through their blood 

Then I faced the gaping infinity 
As a choir of agonal cries 
Overwhelmed me with purest cacophony 
And my soul locked in flesh again was 
Now I stride towards ashen horizons 
As I breathe the undoing of life 
Unfolding my destination 
In a world where no hope lies
