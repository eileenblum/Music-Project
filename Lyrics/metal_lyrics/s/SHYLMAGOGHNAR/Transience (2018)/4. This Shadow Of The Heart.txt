Life is a canvas laid bare for all to see
Man is a mirror imprinted with lock and key
Dichotomous gates lead to dormant ways
Where every path was split in half
We wander 'til we fade

Time confounds and mystifies
Awareness cuts like a blade
The duplicitous curse of the gifts we share
Soon lost on wasted days
Let senses draw blood - drown in their flood
A maelstrom of sweat and cold regret
Lifeâs paint seeps from our veins

Through the portals that we left
Our shades will follow through

Embrace the struggle
Learn to grow with your pain
Hope lies in the solace of a dying dream
Beasts trapped in a corner fight fiercest of all
Does the light not shine the brightest in the depth of night?

Once our souls moved softly
And tiptoed through the world
The Atlas weight a gentle ache
But this could not be us
A slave to wretch nature
A rag doll to our hearts
To relish burden like a fool while shadows tear at our mind

We have shaped our sorrow and became the forge
Infernos that consumed us once have wrought a tempered flame
But bitterness does suffocate and stone breaks all the same
Our sculptorâs soul, though marble-made
Eclipsed by the shadow of the heart

Beasts trapped in a corner fight the fiercest of all
Does the light not shine the brightest in the depth of night?
