Gone is the flame
Smoldering the ashes

A flickering fades into my eyes
Pursued by the howling of life
The shadows cast by fading pyre
At the hour of twilight stand guard
For creatures lurk in deepest dark
Waiting for the light to grow sparse
Their hopelessness, the endless mist
As long as I breathe they are mine

So I beg of the wind for a whisper to my fallen kin
But their shadows on the trees are nothing but a fantasy
So distant the calling of forgotten dreams,
How they yearn and beg for release
I stand idle as they all are crushed by the turning of destiny's wheel

A nomad of the wasteland journeys through the fog
Where my feet have trodden, deepest are the bogs
Where the wind is howling its song I wade through the snow
A journey of the heart, no path can take me where I go

I am a withered wanderer, wayward are my goals
Lost in ancient forests, crystallised by souls
Was my burden once an honour, it's reduced to plight
In this fortress of the mind I have been haunting all my life

Beyond the great golden divide
A cadence frail so warmly strikes
For whom it fades the soul divides
Forever gone to where the daylight died

Fixed on the horizon ever is my gaze
Bitterly I stride on, blinded by the haze
Is it dawn or will the dusk fall, I'll never know
For the darkness that surrounds me is reminiscent of my own

The mist envelops ruins, (their) purpose lost in time
Statues in seclusion, empty are their eyes
How I long to find a reason this world to endure
But all I see are corpses of those who were lost -
Before...

The cadence frail now slowly fades
A formless pale steps from the shade
And whispers to my mind:
"The time has come to leave your shape behind"

Oh flame of life, mother regret
Have mercy on this fallen wretch
Grant me the strength to travel on
And reach the hall to where the raven guides

My body's too cold to move on, in one final act of defiance
My feet stand steadfast in the snow but the frostbite takes its final toll
I heave my hands towards the sky and sound my final forlorn cry
I plead and beg the sky for mercy

As my heart is freezing slowly, I embrace the storm
And as I die I see the veil lifted by the sun
