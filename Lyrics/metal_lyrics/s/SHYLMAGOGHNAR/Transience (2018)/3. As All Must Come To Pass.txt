Time is a beast, inadherent to rein
Trapped in its hounding, unbreakable frame
Few, few are we - impossible the odds
To witness as mortals the fabric of the gods

I never saw what came for me
And yet it lives within my dreams
It whispers from a restless void
Sleeps with eyes wide open

The deep and slumbering question rears its head once more

Is it reality that dwarfs the dream?
Or a realm of illusions that rules supreme?

Iâve seen too far beyond the veil and peered into its soul
And once it answered once I was complete

Witness the birth of legacy, of sacrifice
In pursuit of paths still veiled
In the shadows of a great unknown
Our desperate covenant was made

All must come to pass
Time is my foe and I wonder:
Was it worth to be bound in this ravel of dreams?
The vast Stygian labyrinth lives on
Traversed only once we are gone

From the lowliest worm to the cosmic scale
Sum principium fines omnes
Shrouded in luster from trivial to grand
In the hollow we are made whole

Woven through birth and demise
Struggling to grasp the patterns of
An essence leaks from every source
Transcending human concepts

Lost within the awe and splendour of all
That slipped between our fingers
As a bastion of wings appeared to our needs
Mold ourselves to be

Threads of future, yarn spun between
Ever elusive â never in sight
Fools presume to see the knots in the ever twisting chaos

Lost in a maelstrom of folly and unwritten paths
Multiple strains move beyond comprehension

In a strange familiar place
In a murder of wings
I beheld the fate of all
Of all that is as it becomes
And our cruel lineage

From the birth of time we have wandered
Primordial depths we have dwelled
From an abyss of worlds we venture
Through the shades of a great unknown

Long as time was abstract we have wandered
And sought solace in turning of tides
Mere threads in the grand tapestry
Cursed envoys of a lost legacy
