Don't leave me here alone
Look in my eyes - truth was better for everyone
Better than white lies
I believe in love - think about what happens above
I believe in truth - think about you

Tell me why we couldn't talk about it
Show me how wrong I am
So come on and cry out loud
To never lose you again

I am not the iron man and you really know me
I am not the iron man, show what I want to be
I am not the iron man, it's my way to protect
I am not the iron man, searching for respect

Day by day - not just when I lay - help me to pray
Day by day - not just when I lay - help me to pray
To find the right way, I need courage to say
Inside turning to outside
Not able to do it alone
It's gonna be alright to leave my one throne

I am not the iron man and you really know me
I am not the iron man, show what I want to be
I am not the iron man, it's my way to protect
I am not the iron man, searching for respect

I always like to learn, to do what is right
And then never return - never go from your side
