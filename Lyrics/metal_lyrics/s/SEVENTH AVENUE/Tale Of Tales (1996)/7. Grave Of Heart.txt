We leave these days
Trying to forget our last prayers
Searching for days of thunder
Can't believe - always wonder

All my tears knew
You'd never take me in your arms
And the other truth
You'll never catch me if I stumble

I'm standing here at the grave of my heart
I feel the fear, the day of a new start
I'm standing here at the grave of my heart
I feel the fear, the day of a new start
Grave of heart - Grave of dreams

Maybe you are right
My life before was tied
Maybe I just don't know
Waiting for the end of this show

Will I stand up to the top
Or did my heartbeat stop
Helpless I lay here
Like a toy out of fear

Teardrops are falling from my eyes
But where is one to hear my cries
I like to sleep all day and night
'cause I'm to weak to do what's right
