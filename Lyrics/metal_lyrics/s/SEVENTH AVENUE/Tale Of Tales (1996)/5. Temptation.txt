Wasn't a nightmare of some people
No fancy either by me
Everyone gets trials
Jesus was tempt by the evil too

The evil uses many things
Sex, money, music
And he uses the bible too
Not wrong things but he distorted these

Smash the evil
Smash the evil, kick him in his face
Smash the evil
Smash the evil
Then you will kill the beast
Then you will kill the beast

You can smash, kick and kill with your faith
Don't give it up, be strong in the lord, he helps you
