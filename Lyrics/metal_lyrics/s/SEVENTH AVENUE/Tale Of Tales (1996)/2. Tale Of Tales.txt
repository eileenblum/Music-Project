Sometimes timeless taste out of time and space
We could tell you stories about some past of glories
You could have some fun with our music gun

We will journey with you show you another truth
Not always entertain - something for your brain
Not always fantasies - something to get on your knees
Tales of tales

Tales of tales, stories for tales
Tales of tales with different mails
Different questions, different answers
Into another world where you could see there
Candles on your way, lightning for everyday
Tales of tales

Open one page of tales
Empty mind with rage
We are not here to preach
And don't want to teach
Think about your way
Before you're blown away
Tales of tales

Coming to the seventh avenue
Push your head around
Take the book of tales and listen to the sound
That's what we have found
Come looking to the ground

For you and for me
There is a better place to be
You could take it if you want
You could leave it if you don't
But one day you will see
That's no land of fantasy
Tales of tales
Tales of tales

Tales of tales, stories for tales
Tales of tales with different mails
Different questions, different answers
Into another world where you could see there
Candles on your way, lightning for everyday
Tales of tales

Isn't it funny
But God don't need your money
He always wants your heart to give you a new start
The devil needs it as well
To go with it to hell
