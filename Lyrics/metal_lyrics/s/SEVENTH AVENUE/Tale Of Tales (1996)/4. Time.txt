The sun caresses my skin
And the wind is telling me stories
Clouds draw seebes in my mind
We've never shared that before
I enjoy the time not to haste and not to run
I enjoy hours of peace and tranquillity
I hope you receive some too
Moments of awe and trust: are they for you?

Far away from the music the birds sing a song for me
Far from the loud city streets pounds the surf of the sea

Let's take the time to find ourselves
Each day, every hour of consuming joy
Let's take time to forgive each other
Let's take time to live

I want to free you from that everyday blues
Because you're you I know too well
I want to show you how colourful birds are
And I want to show you to laugh like a child

Lets take the time to hope and to laugh
And not just look at the time on our clock
In our days we can reach for the stars
Lets take the time to grow and to build

I'm not the peak of the masculine race
And yet I belong to a special breed
We've seen the world from different angles
We can find out the good and the bad

Let's take the time to find ourselves
Each day, every hour of consuming joy
Let's take time to forgive each other
Let's take time to live
