It's summer and I am on an avenue
A street you can still walk at night
It's summer and not cold at all, but strangely I still quiver
Anonymous yet satisfied they walk past each other

It's a cold dark night tonight
A night like every other
It's cold, can't be closed with anything
It's the cold that surrounds us
It's a cold dark night tonight
A night like every other
It's cold, can't be closed with anything
It's the cold that surrounds us daily

I'm on my way to the party by Jacky
It's what's up tonight
"Great, you came" - It's all as usual
"How you doing?" - but no one cares
And everyone's drinking, cracking, having a blast
So they don't feel the deadly cold around them

He's on a corner of the seventh avenue
Eddi, the nomad of the town
He's just filling his tank with a bottle of wine
Having a good old time - with a tear in his eye
Days gone by and hard times brought him here
And every bottle sheds a new tear in his eye

I say: "Hey Ed, it's a cold dark night tonight!"
He laughs, a warm laugh, honest no fake or slight
It warmed me, it follows me through the cold night
It's so easy, it's pleasant to warm the cold night
