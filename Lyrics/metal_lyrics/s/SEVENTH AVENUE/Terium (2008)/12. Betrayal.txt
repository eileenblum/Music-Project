[STORY: The sun had just set. In the last rays of its light a little ship landed before the main temple in Cetris. A dark figure jumped out of the cockpit and sneaked into the temple. The high priests had waited for him. He had contemplated for a long time how he could do this and more important, if he should do this. He always was responsible for the finances of them. And the crucial point happened the night before. They sat together, all thirteen when young man came in. He had a Holocast in his hands. And it was not one of those cheap Holocasts. It was one of those which make really real holograms but if you play the holomovie once, it never can show another movie but this one. But this holomovie is really realistic. You got the imagination that you were right into the movie. The man placed the Holocast right before Ratis on the table and he switched it on. It showed sequences of the miracles Ratis had done. The young man said: "This is a present for you. I wanted to make something really unique." All the disciples stared at the holomovie, a glance in their eyes. Only Siroc stared with anger. He yelled at the man that they could have sold the Holocast to buy more important things. Like spare parts for the ships or the converters or so. Siroc was convinced that Ratis would agree with him, but instead of agreeing he gave him a rejection. All the other eleven were looking at Siroc as if he was a dork. He felt so mortified. So he decided to betray Ratis. He knew that the priests would pay a lot of money for a hint where Ratis would show up next. Maybe they would even give him Silverterium. That would be a blast. Silverterium. Life without end. Not being accountable to anyone, not even to the Creator. And now he stood before the council of the high priests. He just got a certain amount of Silverterium. Enough for him. And he just handed over the pertinent information to them. He turned around and left the temple. On the next evening they all met at this place on Rioda. They had had a successful day again. And now they sat together for a supper again. Ratis just filled the cup with wine. He lifted it up and waited till they all were quiet. He said: ,,One of you has betrayed me." He didn't say this in anger or disappointment. They all were aghast. What did this mean? Ratis continued: "Tonight I will be handed over to the Romanes. You all will run away from me." Again there was neither anger nor disappointment in his voice. "No, never, I will never leave you!" "Me neither!" "Never!" They all contradicted. But suddenly the door sled up and the planets police flounced in the room. The disciples jumped up but the police had only eyes for Ratis, so they grabbed him and dragged him to the ground. They cuffed his hands and dragged him out. The disciples were so shocked that they all fled. Only one smiling face left the room.]

The priests and the leaders came together.
Making a plot against him.
He agitates against all of our rules.
His life is not worth a damn - right now.
When they sat together a girl came to them
pouring an ointment on him.
Disciples were upset he said to them 'Calm down'
You gonna catch it.

[BRIDGE:]
Take bread, take wine.
Bless it, share it out.
It's my body given for your sins.
For your sins.

[REFRAIN:]
My time has come - wish it would not.
I feel so cold - my death is near.
Never want to drink this sorrowful cup.
My heart is low - on this midnight hour.
I'll be alone - I'm frightened to death.
Yet not what I want but your will be done.

What will you give me if I betray him?
He is a thorn in my flesh.
You will get Silverterium from us.
You hand him over to us - come on.
On their last supper Ratis said to them.
I wanna tell you the truth.
I know that one of you will betray me.
I'm gonna take it.
