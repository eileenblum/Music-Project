[STORY: Yeah, this is it! Terium! This is what mankind searched for since we have come to live. Give it to me! I want it! Yeah, it makes me live on! I never gonna die! My fate is no longer in any Creators hands. I am no longer scared of death and damnation, cause I will live forever! I will stay healthy. Terium doesn't leave me down. I can trust in it. It makes me feel good, it opens my mind! Oh yeah, this is a great discovery. Who ever said that the Pykods haven't brought anything good? So don't wait too long now, I would kill for the pill! The people sat in this waiting room, they wouldn't have to wait long, because the application of Terium was a fast procedure. One little pill of Terium per week, dissolved in weak soda bicarbonated water. That's all. It kept you healthy and extended the life. You won't wither anymore from the date you take it. And it was affordable. Every man could afford. So every man yearned for it. And got it. And there was another kind of Terium: Silverterium. The difference between both was pretty simple. The Silverterium was not addictive. But it was very rare. Terium in general was very tender to magnetic fields. Once the crystal was in touch with a magnetic field, such as are caused by electricity e.g., it cannot be Silverterium anymore. So the Silverterium has to be digged by bare hands, only with the help of mechanic tools. The extraction of Silverterium perished many lives. And not every one could get it. Pontius himself decided who got Silverterium and who didn't.]

Terium is the sense of your dull lives.
It is what you have searched for.
You need no god.
You need no other salvation.
Take it from my hands.
Take it from me.
And I'll be your salvation!
Hahaha...

Light grey, ugly, you almost don't feel the weight in your hand.
It seems so inconspicuous but it is desired more than gold.
You only find it on Kranos, fourth planet from the sun.
A toxic atmosphere, no water, dust hostile and cold.

[BRIDGE:]
Deep in the planet the Terium waits.
To spend a life last for eternity.
The blood and tears of the convicts cry out.
The rigid wardens will show no mercy, no mercy.

[REFRAIN:]
The Terium is your all.
You do not ask for the terms you will pay every price.
Heading straight for your goal.
You are running through ages there's no doubt.
The Terium is your all.
You do not ask for the terms you will pay every price.
Heading straight for your goal.
The grim reaper will walk by your door.
Walk by your door.

Magnetic fields, caused by machines decrease the effect of the Terium.
So the Terium for the rich ones is mined just with bare hands.
The Silverterium will let you live for all eternity.
The other only stops wither and stretches life from some years.

[BRIDGE:]
Deep in the planet the Terium waits.
To spend a life last for eternity.
The blood and tears of the convicts cry out.
The rigid wardens will show no mercy, no mercy.

[BRIDGE II:]
And there is no need for a God in an eternal life.
Terium's satisfaction for all.
It heals pain, it stop age, it's the lost paradise.
It's addictive, it calls you to crawl.
It brings you higher and higher your wings in the wind.
There's no need for remorse, for a tear.
You won't fall in a sickness, a life without end.
Just as long as you get Terium

[REFRAIN:]
The Terium is your all.
You do not ask for the terms you will pay every price.
Heading straight for your goal.
You are running through ages there's no doubt.
The Terium is your all.
You do not ask for the terms you will pay every price.
Heading straight for your goal.
The grim reaper will walk by your door.
Walk by your door.
