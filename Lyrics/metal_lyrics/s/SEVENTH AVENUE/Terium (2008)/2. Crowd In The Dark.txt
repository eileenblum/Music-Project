[STORY: The dawn woke up the desert lands. The sun broke up the night locked sky. It was a clear deep blue sky and the last stars paled slowly. Micah was already awake, he wasn't sure, if he had slept at all that night. He got visions from the Creator and today was the day to tell the people. He knew that they won't love him for his speech, but they needed to know that the Creator still yearned for them. Even if there were only very few people left, asking for the Creator. There were ups and downs in the relationship between people and the Creator. The last years had been a continuous decline. People were going their own ways, gave a heck about Creator's rules. But they needed to know... ,,Listen to the Creator's words! You all need to turn around, you all condemn yourselves by the way you are living. I don't want you to stab each others back; I don't want you to fleece each other. You bend your knees before the rich and mighty, but you stamp on the poor right before your door and spit him in the face. This isn't what I think of your lives. I will scatter you to the ends of the galaxy, I will send you a hard oppression and you will wish you were never born. You will walk in the dark like the dead, but death will not be merciful. You won't be able to come back to me on your own. And then I will send a saviour. He will grow up among you and you won't recognize him. You will see signs and miracles but your hearts will be barred. But one day you will see clear..." Micah hadn't seen the sniper aiming at him. He even hadn't felt the blow. But he went home.]

The morning of the universe was gone.
And it seemed now was right in the long run.
But the stubborn men, they'll never be obedient.
So prophets came to say creators will.
And to help people to get out of this mill.
And your tears will be wiped away that day
Happiness will oust all fears from you.

[REFRAIN:]
Crowd in the dark.
Light will shine on you.
Universe will see.
You will rejoice.
At the broken yoke laid
on shoulders bended in pain.

Micah was one of those prophets then.
He not minced matters and he rebuked all men.
He predicted loud. No one could miss his words.
A saviour to come to bring final peace.
He'll end all pain and will cure all disease.
And your tears will be wiped away that day.
Happiness will oust all fears from you.

[REFRAIN:]
Crowd in the dark.
Light will shine on you.
Universe will see.
You will rejoice.
At the broken yoke laid
on shoulders bended in pain.

[BRIDGE:]
You carry all your fears and you are broken by the devils lust.
This a hell you're going through.
God will become a child, grow up and carry sings for all mankind.
To be the final sacrifice.

[REFRAIN:]
Crowd in the dark.
Light will shine on you.
Universe will see.
You will rejoice.
At the broken yoke laid
on shoulders bended in pain.
Crowd in the dark.
Light will shine on you.
Universe will see.
You will rejoice.
At the broken yoke laid
on shoulders bended in pain.
