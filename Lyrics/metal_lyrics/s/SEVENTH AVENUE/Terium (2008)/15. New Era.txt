[STORY: The night approached its end. The morning broke up over Rioda. We eleven sat together. Siroc committed suicide after he heard of Ratis dead. This had been three days ago. Three long days and nothing had happened. No angel, no prophecy, nothing. Were we all mistaken? Had Ratis only been a beguiler? But all the miracles? I Didn't know how often we played the Holocast. But why didn't happen anything? Grief begun to prevail.
Suddenly we heard a known voice: "Why are you so down?" I looked up, I couldn't believe my eyes. There was Ratis standing. Alive. Healthy. What happened? We all weren't able to say a word. After a short while we all started to speak at once; Ratis only had a big grin on his face. He lifted his hands to get us quiet. "Read the prophets", he said. "You knew it, but you didn't believe. I will only be with you for a short time now. Only say a few things. But you will have to carry on. The Terium is defeated. It lost all its effect in the thunderstorm. At the same time my father had taken away all addiction. There is no human being addicted to Terium any more. People will continue their lives from the point they took Terium first. They will die again and they will have children again. They will become ill again and they will have their free will again. The most didn't even recognize this yet, but they will soon. I guess, for the most it will be rather aggravating, because their live has an end again. They will have to think about death again. For now the fallen has lost his sting, but he will grow another one." Ratis looked around. He continued: ,,Now it's your turn. Go and spray the good news, that there still is a Creator and that he still wants to have community with men. You will find open ears and closed ones, but you have to go. Don't hide away! Now there is a new era beginning!"
After twenty days Ratis said that he had to leave now. We were gathered in our assembly hall, formerly the big temple. After the Terium was gone, all the priests committed suicide or disappeared. Pontius hadn't been seen or heard for sixteen days now. Ratis stood amidst us, lifted his hands and blessed us all. Then he looked up and suddenly he disappeared. We all knew that he was finally gone now, but we also knew that he only was a prayer away. And so we started the new era. End (for the time being)]

None on the roads. No one is out there.
Rioda's like dead. Completely deserted.
Two women only. Searching for comfort.
Where is the saviour why had he to die just why, tell me why.

Men sitting there. Seemed to be waiting.
Like angels they are. Speaking to women.
He is not here. Why do you seek him
between the dead. Already risen by now.

[REFRAIN:]
As the prophets said.
Would be put to death.
But he'll rise again.
He's the saviour of all.
End the reign of death.
Reject Terium.
Returns glorious.
Lay the foundations for the new era.

Disciples are down. No one could cheer up.
Three days he is dead. Only mistake?
He comes to them. Standing among them.
Giving them hope. Cause they will paving the way for new era

[REFRAIN:]
As the prophets said.
Would be put to death.
But he'll rise again.
He's the saviour of all.
End the reign of death.
Reject Terium.
Returns glorious.
Lay the foundations for the new era.

[BRIDGE:]
Slowly they grasp things they've heard times before.
Open the door spread the good news outside.
There is more to see
than Terium's lie.
Cause the time has come
that the saviour will start his reign.

[REFRAIN:]
As the prophets said.
Would be put to death.
But he'll rise again.
He's the saviour of all.
End the reign of death.
Reject Terium.
Returns glorious.
Lay the foundations for the new era.
