[STORY: Slowly a majestic Rioda emerges in the porthole. It is a blue planet. My eye catches Brosan, the biggest of the three big continents. On Brosan is Cetris, the systems capitol. My destination. About 2 million people are living there. Not too much, but there are only about 200 millions in the whole system. There is no need for children, if you don't die. And the birth is controlled by Terium. A mostly adverse reaction to Terium is infertility. And this is good, who the heck needs children. They only cost money. I still can remember the old structures we had, before we got the Terium. There have been families. This time is over, good riddance! Nowadays no one marries anymore. Pontius annulled all the partnerships and marriages. Everyone is free to do whatever he wants. No social chains anymore. If you want to have fun, go out, look for a one night stand and have fun. No more bondages. And you can do it with a good conscience. No need to care for anything! Terium keeps you healthy! I just left Kranos from my inspection-trip. I really don't like this planet. You can't survive on the surface without a spacesuit. The temperature and the atmosphere are extremely hostile. So everything is under the surface. The mines, production plants, the prisons. Ahh, the stinking prisons. They deserve what they've got. None of them will return alive. This repulsive scum of the universe. They only have to dig the Terium and then they can go belly up for my sake. The police keep the supplies coming. But my suggestion would be to raze Nufridon to the ground. Those stinking Terium deniers. And they refuse to dig the Terium. They even refuse to acclaim Pontius as the disposer. They rather take the dehydration. So the council decided to let the grubs have the ice lump. This planet Nufridon. Since it changed its orbit and is almost the whole year in Kranos' shadow, all turned into ice. Before, it was a really life spending planet. Now all is iced and dark. The grubs are living in caves under the surface. They still believe in a Creator. In someone who really created the universe. How absurd. If there is a Creator, his name is Pontius. We all should worship him for giving us the Terium. I will initialize a draft to worship Pontius.]

Riosa is the systems main planet.
Nufridon also gives the chance to live.
Neverending winter.
But Kranos is the systems treasury.
Romans control bring you to your knees.
Terium forever.

[BRIDGE:]
On Nufridon the crystal has no might.
People's trust in God here's shining bright.

[REFRAIN:]
And when the night will come, when Terium demands it's final toll.
Each man will have to pay. But no-one can afford - the price is too high.

The priests don't serve God anymore these days.
They even don't ask for creators ways.
People go astray.
Dictatorship of Romans hold men down.
They've lost the hope on saviour's coming soon.
He's already coming.

[BRIDGE:]
On Nufridon the crystal has no might.
People's trust in God here's shining bright.

[BRIDGE II:]
And I won't leave it. But deep in your mind.
It deceives you. And poor words. Say nothing, no.

[REFRAIN:]
And when the night will come, when Terium demands it's final toll.
Each man will have to pay. But no-one can afford - the price is too high.
And when the night will come, when Terium demands it's final toll.
