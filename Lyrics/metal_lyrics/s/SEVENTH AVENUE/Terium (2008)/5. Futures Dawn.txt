[STORY: We studied the old prophecies thoroughly. We knew that this day would come and we were prepared. Then one day we knew it was time to break up. Times ago we have been one nation. But they decided to leave our system and search for new planets to settle. We built the generations ships and some of us broke up. Every now and then we heard of their fate. But now we haven't heard of them for a long long time. So we got in our ships and begun the journey. After a trip through some galaxies we found it. We entered the system of Rioda. Here it is, here the saviour is born. The one who will bring peace to all mankind. We landed on Rioda, seen a leader named Pontius in the saviour issue. He was none of our nation, he was a Roman. The Romanes have delivered our people from the tyranny of the Pykods some centuries ago. Then they stayed in the system and formed the government. He hadn't heard of the saviour and we almost thought we followed a mistake. But then he said we should let him know; if we would find the saviour, cause he also would like to see and worship him. So we left Rioda, but following an intuition, we took course on Nufridon. And indeed, there we found the child. Just born in a ice shelled cave. We told the parents our story and we gave what we brought him, knowing that the times would change from now on. And we never returned to Rioda. There was another power in the universe: The fallen. He was not a real antagonist to the Creator, because he was also created, but he acted like one. The Creator let him, knowing that he was already fallen. And this fact made the fallen only more wild, cause he knew, that he never could escape his fate. So he tried to get as much as possible people separated from the Creator. He used many tricks since his fall, but the Terium was the smartest. And Pontius became his worthiest tool. "All is in the long run now." the fallen thought by himself. "They have the Terium. They took it from my hands and they fell for it. They aren't interested in the Creator anymore. The priests are bribed with Silverterium. There is only one little thing I still worry about: There was this darn prophet Micah. He predicted a saviour to come. I haven't exactly known what that meant, but now I know! Pontius will solve that problem, however." ,,Who is this so called saviour? " Pontius thundered through the halls. He was upset. Wasn't he the saviour? Hadn't he brought the Terium to mankind? Hadn't he made it possible to extend the life? And now there were those geezers, asking for a new born saviour. What is there to save? Nothing. You needn't to be saved, if you live forever. No Creator. Only life. I will be the Creator for people. I am in charge. ,,I will find this saviour, and if I've found him, he will have to save himself!" And he found him, it took almost 25 years, but he found him. Pontius was rather calm and prudential. He couldn't arrest Ratis that easy, he knew that. It took those 25 years to track him down and now he wouldn't disappoint his master. ,,Okay, this Ratis, even if he is Creator's son, is only a man. And men are weak. I will find his soft spot." he thought by himself. Then he pushed the button and the door slided up. Ratis came in. He was a guest, not a convict. ,,Take a seat" invited Pontius. Ratis sat down, opposite to him. ,,See" Pontius said ,,all the people are getting the Terium. They want it, so I deliver it. I do not force anyone to take it. They are all content with their way. I make you an offer: You get Silverterium for you and your friends and I give you more money than you could ever spend and in addition you'll get a nice little island here on Rioda. And as an equivalent you forget your original mission. No one will lose anything, if you agree. The people can live on and you will live on and we will have peace in the system." Silence. Ratis crinkled his lips and frowned. It seemed as if he contemplated the offer. He ran his hand over his face and his eyes caught Pontius eyes. Pontius tried to return the look, but he failed. He had to look down ,,So, what do you say? " ,,I say," Ratis responded ,,it sounds seductive. But listen: I won't fall for you. I am not here to save myself. My mission are the people. They still have a home in the Creator's heart and you keep them from moving in. So they are the restless derelicts you made them. I am here to bring them back home." Pontius was more than upset about this. He wasn't used to contradiction. He jumped up, his chair almost made a somersault. He yelled for the wardens but Ratis had been disappeared already. Pontius failed. For now.]

An angel has given the sign.
A virgin birth Creators son.

The boy was born: certain signs.
The boy's the one who will change universe.
Different reasons and minds.
To seek this child and walk behind.
