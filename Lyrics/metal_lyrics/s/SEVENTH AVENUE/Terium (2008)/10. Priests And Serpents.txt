[STORY: The high priests sat together in their temple in Cetris. They had a council. "This Ratis, he is a beguiler. He has to be one. No one can come and say he is the promised saviour. See how the people hang on his lips. He must be one with the fallen one. He just needs to touch the people and they can do without Terium. And they have no withdrawals. He knows that it is against the law. But he does it nevertheless. This system has been so tidy and accurate, before he came. We had something to say. People listened to us. Where has our sway gone now? We have to be careful not to peril our link to Pontius. He is the one who supplies us with Silverterium. And the more people turn away from us the more Pontius will become advertent to us. We are not doing anything wrong. We tell people that they don't need to fear the Creator, because the Creator is in everyone. And the Terium turns out the Creator in us. It provides us with lasting life and health. Have you heard what this Ratis said? He called us toadies. And he prophesized us to end up in hell. Doesn't he know that we will never die? Since we get the Silverterium we will live forever! And we also have the keys to heaven and hell. Not he! We should bring him in the mines immediately. No one would ask for him again. And we get rid of him." The sun set behind the skyline of Cetris. The priests are content now. Holier than thou. Ratis felt a slight stab in his heart for these men. And an even more painful stab for all the souls they'll drag down in hell. A silent tear fell from his cheek and froze before it touched the ground on Nufridon.]

All dreams come true. Cause time is no longer an enemy.
All fantasies become real. And the soul's flying high.
