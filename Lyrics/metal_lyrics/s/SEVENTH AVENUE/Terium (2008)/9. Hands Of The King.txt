[STORY: I have been living for over 400 years now. And I was addicted to Terium almost all of the time. Terium seemed to bode well. Extend your life, be healthy. Redesign your life; you can ban death out of your life. They have forgotten to mention the dependency. In the first 200 years it didn't really bother me. I did all the things I ever wanted to. I was free. I had no one to look after. I had children in the time before Terium, but they grew up and got Terium by their selves. I had a wife, but Pontius annulled our marriage and we both were free again. It seemed like the long lost paradise. But after 200 years I began to feel restless and hollow. Thoughts of the creator came up in me, but anyhow, I have lost the connection to him. It depressed me. My soul was tired of living on. Actually I wanted to die. But on the other hand, death scared me. Anyhow I knew that I wouldn't find peace after death. Anyway, the only way to die would have been a suicide. And suicide was forbidden by law. If I should fail, they would dehydrate me. So I lived on. I was so fed up with live and I was addicted. Then, a few weeks ago, this guy, Ratis, crossed my way. He looked at me and anyhow he felt my pain. Can't say. He asked me if I want to be free. I felt that my decision would decide between life and death. I knew that if I would agree, I would die. He touched me deeply, I could only nod. He touched my forehead and he just said: You are free now. Go and live your life. You are a Creator's child! That day was the last day I had a Terium pill. I don't even miss it. I started to pray again and I feel a never been connection with the Creator. I even have had a cold already. But I also know: If I die now, I'll go home!]

I can see all those people struggle on their own.
The eye just fools the mind so people go straight to hell.
Just reaching our for Terium to keep the end far out.
A barethread reason to justify dependency.
They seem so proud but they are standing at the rim.
Just one more step and they fall down - they will fall so deep.

[BRIDGE:]
I hear you crying out in sorrow.
And your time will slip away.
Terium will leave you hollow.
But now's the chance to break the line.

[REFRAIN:]
A touch of my hand opens your eyes.
A word from my lips can end your pain.
There's no relief in trust in Terium.
It's you who'll make the choice.

There were those men addicted. Terium into their veins.
With faces stare into space. Want to die but hearts keep pounding.
Just a touch from holy hands brought them back to live.

[BRIDGE:]
I hear you crying out in sorrow.
And your time will slip away.
Terium will leave you hollow.
But now's the chance to break the line.

[REFRAIN:]
A touch of my hand opens your eyes.
A word from my lips can end your pain.
There's no relief in trust in Terium.
It's you who'll make the choice.
Hands of the king are healers hands.
With the power to set free.
There's no relief in trust in Terium.
It's you who'll make the choice.

Eternal life without an aim. I am the way back into worthwhile life.
I will take you by the hand. I won't leave you in the end.
As Terium leaves you. Healthy and living but empty and hollow.
You're the one I will die for.

[REFRAIN:]
A touch of my hand opens your eyes.
A word from my lips can end your pain.
There's no relief in trust in Terium.
It's you who'll make the choice.
Hands of the king are healers hands.
With the power to set free.
There's no relief in trust in Terium.
It's you who'll make the choice.

I am put in charge to forgive sin.
I am the way back to worthwhile life,
I will take you by the hand.
