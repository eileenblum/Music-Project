[STORY: Deep inside each single man there is the knowledge about the existence of the supernatural. The knowledge about things neither science nor priests ever could give evidence for. It may be for good or for bad, but people feel, that they will see it clear, when they die. And the people don't want to die, because they fear the unknown. And they are right to fear. Only two paths to go: One wide, bright, well paved road. The other one is narrow and sometimes hidden. Stones block the way. One has to choose. The Terium postpones this decision. I know your fears. I know what's in your heart. I know the deepest thoughts in your minds. And nevertheless I love you. I know that it seems to be impossible to walk the narrow path. And if you're addicted to Terium it is even harder, because Terium denies access to this path. So I sent a saviour to you. He can free you from addiction and he will speak for you. Just rely on him.]

Holy Father Lord Creator.
The highest name in universe.
We wait for your kingdom to come.
In universe your will shall be done.
Don't you let us down today.
We wait for your power to come.

[BRIDGE:]
Our fate is forever in your hands.
And now the darkness slow fades away.

[REFRAIN:]
With blinded eyes
we struggle through our lives with hearts of fear.
We lost our courage.
Believe the lies.
We're almost on to fail for evilness.
Just feeling something's going wrong.

We often go straight our own way.
Refuse to accept what you want.
We wait for your glory to come.
Please forgive us our cut off.
We'll forgive our debtors too.
We wait for the saviour to come.

[BRIDGE:]
Our fate is forever in your hands.
And now the darkness slow fades away.

[BRIDGE II:]
I am the way - the announced saviour.
Eternal truth - gives hope back to you.
So I am the life. I do not tempt you.
Deliver you from the evil one - hey.

[REFRAIN:]
With blinded eyes
we struggle through our lives with hearts of fear.
We lost our courage.
Believe the lies.
We're almost on to fail for evilness.
Just feeling something's going wrong.
