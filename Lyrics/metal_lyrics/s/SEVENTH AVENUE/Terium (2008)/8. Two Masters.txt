[STORY: You small minds! You see only you and your life! And you still fear the unknown, the things without evidence! And so you decided to postpone them in the hope to forget them. But believe me, time won't forget you! That's for sure. It will catch up to you earlier than you will know. You take the Terium. It helps you over the death. Your whole life is aimed to this drug! How to get it, when to get it. How to afford the next pill. But the Romanes won't let you down! Be sure! They will supply you with the Terium. And they are the real winners. All you do is losing. You lose your free will; you lose your life, even if you obviously live on and on. But if I look deep in your eyes, I can see that there is another thing. Another need. But it is oppressed. Deep in you there still is the lore of the Creator. And you know that he hates the Terium. You try to pray and he hears you, but you also know that you are like a child who just played out in the mud and who now comes inside to the adults who are sitting at the table. You want to join them, but you also feel that you should wash yourself first.]

And there is the Terium court our attention.
Banish grim reaper. Disease is defeated.
It only costs a little of dependence.
It's all around us. Living without end.

[BRIDGE:]
Don't struggle with woe of tomorrow.
It will come clear. Every day will have it's own sorrow.

[REFRAIN:]
Struggle - what will you believe.
Cannot divide your heart.
There are still two masters to choose.
Decide - it is up to you.
What will be you master.
Creator or Terium.

And there is the almighty God your creator.
From all beginning. He is the same.
He has never changed his attitude.
He's all around us. He still yearns for you.
