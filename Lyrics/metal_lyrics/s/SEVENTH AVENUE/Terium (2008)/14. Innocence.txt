[STORY: Today it was Colgas turn to guard the body. Colga was pretty sad, but since he was a police officer he couldn't show it. Actually Colga was convinced that it was a mistake to execute this Ratis. He hadn't done anything wrong. He only helped those people who wanted to be free. He didn't force anybody. And once, this Ratis helped a friend of him. He was only 280 years old. But he was so fed up with live. He wanted to die. His friend always believed in the Creator and he hated what the priests made of him. He actually wanted to go to Nufridon, to join the real worshippers, but he never found the courage to take the withdrawals. So he stayed. And continued taking Terium. But he was tired of his never ending life. He became restless, sometimes aggressive, but most of the time sad. Abysmally sad. Then one day he encountered this Ratis. Ratis only looked in his friends eyes and he knew what was wrong. His look was full of love when he touched his friend's forehead and said: ,,You are now free to go, where you want." Colgas friend didn't go to the Terium place again from that day on. And he hadn't had any withdrawals. He packed all his stuff together and moved to Nufridon. Three weeks later he died, but he died with a smile on his face and Colga knew that he went home.
And now he had to stand here, deep in the mines to guard the body of Ratis. Suddenly he started to cry. Feelings just overwhelmed Colga. He felt so guilty for Ratis death. Actually it would have been more just, if Colga would have died. He was a Roman. He worked for the Romanes. He worked for those who brought the Terium to the people. This life stretching lie. He fell on his knees, tears in his eyes, confessed his guilt, cried for forgiveness. After a while he looked up to the door of the gallery. However, it was open; a bright white light came out of the gallery. He had to screen his eyes from the light. A large white guise spoke to him: "He is not here. Death was not capable to hold him. Go now."
"This Ratis was really the promised saviour" was Colgas last thought before he fainted.]

I'm standing here before his grave.
To watch no one comes close to him.
The night is cold and I'm alone.
I'm not the man I used to be.

[BRIDGE:]
Shining through, break a hole in the night.
And a prayer in my heart.

[REFRAIN:]
See it clear - innocence.
What had this man to die for?
I believe - He's the one.
Fall on my knees feel my sin.

A silent tear runs down my cheek.
I still live on but he is dead.
I wish I could turn back the time.
And talk to him confess my sins.

[BRIDGE:]
Shining through, break a hole in the night.
And a prayer in my heart.

[REFRAIN:]
See it clear - innocence.
What had this man to die for?
I believe - He's the one.
Fall on my knees feel my sin.

[BRIDGE II:]
Why are you standing here?
What are you waiting for?
He is no longer here.
Rise from the death.

[REFRAIN:]
See it clear - innocence.
What had this man to die for?
I believe - He's the one.
Fall on my knees feel my sin.

I'm on my knees tears in my eyes
Cause I feel you touched me deep in my soul.
