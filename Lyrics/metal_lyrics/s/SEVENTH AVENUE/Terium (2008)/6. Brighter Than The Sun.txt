[STORY: Anyhow we knew that we had only a little time. Ratis taught us only for a few months. He explained the old prophecies in his own words and he told us how they match with the creators will. We really believed that he was the Creator's son. With his emergence the old prophecies started to come to live. We knew that the times would change from now. We knew that the Creator yearned for everyone but the people on Rioda didn't know that. They were vegetating, trapped in their immortal bodies. The most people even stopped thinking about the creator. So on this cold morning, we should start our campaign. The flight to Rioda would take less than a day. I looked over the hangar. Almost one hundred remodelled fighters shimmered in the cold light. The dawn hadn't started yet, but it would soon. It was one of the few days in the year when Nufridon emerged out of Kranos shadow. The air was flickering against the hangar lighting. The engines were heating up. We all were very tensed and anxious. Would they want to hear our message? Would we be able to catch some ears? I've never been to Rioda. I was only 24 years old. The people I was going to report on the Creator's love would be at least 200 years older than me. This was my mission. I always had to remember that it wouldn't be me who would speak. I was only a tool in the Creator's hand. I saw Ratis put on his helmet and jump into his cockpit. In this very moment the first rays of sunlight broke through the darkness and dipped the whole hangar in a golden glance.]

Jump in the cockpit - don't turn away.
Cause you're believing that I'm the one Creator has sent.
Start up the engines - don't fear no more.
Go to Rioda - and heal the people from disease.

[BRIDGE:]
You shall - shine all - cause you are the salt and the light.
Never - look back - cause you are the tools in Gods hands.

You'll tell the people - the good news now.
Stay where they're eager - to hear the gospel of good news.
But when they'll close doors - or spit at you.
Don't loose time trying - just turn around they'll kiss the dust.

[REFRAIN:]
Go out, spread the good news, don't have no fear.
God sent his saviour the Terium to sear.
There is no salvation in endless life,
if you run out of steam.

If they're ashamed of the words I say.
You can believe me - I'll be ashamed of them also.
Cause in the last days - I will return.
Creator'll ask me - who's opened up his heart for me.

[BRIDGE:]
You shall - shine all - cause you are the salt and the light.
Never - look back - cause you are the tools in Gods hands.

[REFRAIN:]
Go out, spread the good news, don't have no fear.
God sent his saviour the Terium to sear.
There is no salvation in endless life,
if you run out of steam.
Go out, spread the good news, don't have no fear.
God sent his saviour the Terium to sear.
There is no salvation in endless life,
if you run out of steam.

[BRIDGE II:]
Be aware of men. They will hate you.
Rapture bout torture - They will persecute you.
But don't you sorrow. God'll speak through you.
And I'll be with you - Brighter than the sun.

[REFRAIN:]
Go out, spread the good news, don't have no fear.
God sent his saviour the Terium to sear.
There is no salvation in endless life,
if you run out of steam.
Go out, spread the good news, don't have no fear.
God sent his saviour the Terium to sear.
There is no salvation in endless life,
if you run out of steam.
