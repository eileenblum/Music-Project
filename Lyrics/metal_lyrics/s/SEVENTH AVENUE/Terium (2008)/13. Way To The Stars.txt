[STORY: "So, we finally have him!". Pontius smirked. Not only that the spook would have an end now and the Terium would get the upper hand again. No, Ratis would die. And with him the Creator's son. Pontius would have a strike against the Creator. He felt so happy, the Fallen would be proud on him. So he opened up the door and entered the court hall. After the trial Pontius wasn't as confident as he had been before. Ratis hadn't said anything. Not even when Pontius cast the death row by dehydration. Ratis not even batted an eye. In his imaginations, Ratis fell on his knees when he pronounced the judgement. He was whimpering for mercy. But nothing. Ratis not even looked at him. Now Ratis sat in this dark cold cargo bay of the carrier. A policerobot next to him. Through the porthole he could see Kranos emerge out of the darkness of space. The killer satellites slowly orbit around the planet. If this wouldn't be an authorized flight, the ship wouldn't be more than dust right now. But the satellites wouldn't destroy this ship. Ratis death wouldn't be that easy.
The carrier slowly sunk through the hostile, poisoned atmosphere. It flew for several minutes over the jagged grey surface of Kranos. Then the lights of the spaceport came into sight. The ship softly touched down. The lift started to move the platform down, below the surface. The last rays of daylight slowly vanished as the gate closed over the carrier. It should have been the last daylight Ratis had seen in this live.
The airlock opened up and the robot took him out. It brought him to an elevator which took him down 4000 feet under the surface. There the robot shoved him through a maze of stone and dust till they let all noise and all lights far behind. Finally they reached the empty gallery where Ratis would die. The robot chained him to the ground, so that Ratis lied sprawled. Then the robot disappeared. He was alone. Pictures flickered before his eyes. All the people, addicted to Terium. All those human beings who wanted to be free again. For all those people he was lying here. He knew that his death would free them all. His death would break the power of Terium. He didn't know how, but he sure knew that.
Ratis lied there in the absolute darkness for an eternity. Minutes become hours if you neither can hear nor see anything. They could leave him here just as he was. He definitely would die. But they wouldn't. That would be too easy.
Suddenly Ratis could see a flickering light. Someone came. Ratis knew that it was the executioner. It had been three human beings in robes with hoods covering their heads. They didn't say anything. One of them kneeled down next to Ratis. He asked "Any last words?" Ratis didn't react. So the executioner took out a shot and shoved the needle right into a vein. Ratis jerked. The executioners stepped back. In the weak light of the gas torches his death struggle begun. It felt like pure magma was flowing through his veins. Flames were licking on his guts. They slowly scorched the inner. Then it felt like the flames got higher. They scorched his flesh; his eyeballs came out of his head. Normally he should have been dead now, burnt by the fire, choked by the smoke, but he wasn't. He had to live through all the pain. After a while the pain decreased a bit. For a short while. But then the hallucinations began. It was almost like the withdrawals, only faster and a hundred times more intensive. Ratis saw bugs creeping towards him. Two inch large black bugs. They crept up his legs and started to shove themselves under his skin. They devoured themselves through his whole body, but Ratis didn't die. He only felt the pain. And he screamed. He screamed for hours and days and weeks and years. He felt like he couldn't stand the pain anymore. But in the very moment when Ratis thought he would go insane, a white guise appeared. The guise said: "Your pain is over, your work is done here." He picked him up and together they went away. Ratis could see his body lying in this gallery, but he didn't care.
One of the executioners stepped towards the body. He kneeled beside it, only to diagnose that Ratis was really dead. He frowned. Only two hours. Normally it took at least six hours. The robot came again, took the body and brought it to a prepared closed gallery. It put the body on the ground and locked the door. A human guard would stand here for at least one week. What all the men in the mines couldn't see, was what was going on in the atmosphere. Dark clouds were drawing together; a thunderstorm was up to cover the whole planet. Thunderbolts started to cover the whole surface. It seemed like the end of the world. In the mines there were only dull crashes to hear. And a sparkle here and there. Actually there was more electricity going down on Kranos today than the whole system provided since the invention of electricity. All the effect of the Terium got lost in that thunderstorm. But no one anticipated it right now...]

They are searching for a reason to put him in the mine.
And this will be death warrant, they wanted it all the time.
And the court won't fail, and Creators son won't speak.
They really be hard on him, he has to take the blame.
Don't know that this was written, ask have you got no shame.
Now the time has come,
and the final curtain falls.

[BRIDGE:]
Ashes to ashes and dust on the land.
And the fire is fading away.

[REFRAIN:]
on the way to the stars,
I won't hide and I will fall.
And the men in the darkness,
become children of the light.

Looking on the Terium he got for his betray.
He feels a hand grabs for him, and sudden strikes from hell.
He makes up his mind. There is no turning back.
His ship is taking off now he never will return.
He knows there's no remission - no one can take his blame.
So the Terium
won't let him live no more.

[REFRAIN:]
on the way to the stars,
I won't hide and I will fall.
And the men in the darkness,
become children of the light.

[BRIDGE II:]
Lying in the darkness,
and his breath slowly fading away.
Deep in the mines his life is ending,
and the grim reaper takes him way.
Black so black - the rays of light won't shine no more.
All alone - the fear inundates all men.
End of all - is this the very end of all?
Death won't win - The grave can't hold Ratis down.

[BRIDGE:]
Ashes to ashes and dust on the land.
And the fire is fading away.

[REFRAIN:]
on the way to the stars,
I won't hide and I will fall.
And the men in the darkness,
become children of the light.
on the way to the stars,
I won't hide and I will fall.
And the men in the darkness,
become children of the light.
