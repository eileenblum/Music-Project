[STORY: I watched Ratis for several days. He seemed to be the same like always, but anyhow he carried grief inside him. I don't know why. Things went good for us. Where ever we went, people listened to us, turned away from Terium and gave their hearts and lives to the Creator again. But now Ratis was sitting there in the hangar, staring out in the darkness and I could see that he carried a burden. What did he know what we didn't? It was an early morning when he called us together. We stood amidst of our little ships. The metal was dull and it was cold here. We stood in the circle of 13 like we did so often. Ratis started with a prayer like he did always. But this day was different nevertheless. A deep grief was in his eyes. I felt that there was something oppressing his heart. And now it was time to produce relief. We all were anxious; no one gave a noise, even if the question wanted to be screamed out by each one of us. Ratis looked up. "I will tell you the truth" he said. "Not that I haven't so before, but you have to know what will happen." He remained silent for a little while. "The authorities will get me. And they will put me in the mines." I wanted to jump up and say that they won't as long as there is breath in my lungs, but he just looked at me with this certain look. I knew that I shouldn't say a word. "They will execute me and I will be dead. You are the ones to carry on then. I know that you will almost die in fear, but you have to keep the faith. I will remain dead for three days. But after that time I will raise again. Death can't hold me. And then you will understand why I have been here." He looked down again. I knew that he was crying. When he looked up again we all could see the tears on his cheeks. "I only made a start. It will be on you to carry on, my brothers." He swallowed hard. "I am almost dying in fear. I wish I could go and hide away! But then everything would be in vain. No, this trail of blood is mine!"]

I have called you and you followed with faith.
You became pillars of truth.
And like a prism you're spreading your light.
You let it shine in the universes dark.
But soon the night will come.
Things running better than I'd ever thought.
People come into believe.
Open their mind for the right face of God.
I show them how the Creators heart feels.
But soon it's time to go.

[BRIDGE:]
Arms up to heaven
I fall on my knees cause now.

[REFRAIN:]
It's time to pray.
Take this sorrowful cup far away from me now.
I'd wish to stay.
But your will shall be done.
It's time to pray.
Take this sorrowful cup far away from me now.
I'd wish to stay.
But your will shall be done.

I will be dead but I will raise again.
Three days you will be alone.
After that time you will see me again.
But then the Terium will be history.
Then you will understand.

[REFRAIN:]
It's time to pray.
Take this sorrowful cup far away from me now.
I'd wish to stay.
But your will shall be done.
It's time to pray.
Take this sorrowful cup far away from me now.
I'd wish to stay.
But your will shall be done.
It's time to pray.
Take this sorrowful cup far away from me now.
I'd wish to stay.
But your will shall be done.
It's time to pray.
Take this sorrowful cup far away from me now.
I'd wish to stay.
But your will shall be done.
