I was close to you
Dreaming my dream
I was far away
So it seems
I need honesty
A stone of hope
I need your love
Now look at me

I'm loving you
Looking for paradise
I'm loving you
Changing me now
I'm loving you
Looking for every day
I'm loving you
Looking for you now

I'm loving you
I need security
I feel your love to me
What can I do?
I'm loving you
I need reality
No world of fantasy
I'm loving you

I'm loving you
Looking for paradise
I'm loving you
Changing me now
I'm loving you
Looking for every day
I'm loving you
Looking for you now

I'm loving you
Looking for paradise
I'm loving you
Changing me now
I'm loving you
Looking for every day
I'm loving you
Looking for you now
