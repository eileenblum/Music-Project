I feel so alone, so alone
But, baby, believe me, I'll never cry for you, never cry for you
Deep inside I'm so alone,
Broken promises tell me: our memories will never come to be
Don't fill my heart with pain,
I'll say it to you again and again

[Refrain:]
Again on the road
I will thank you oh my God
That you have shown me, I'm not alone
Again on the road
I will thank you oh my God
That you have shown me, I'm not alone

No more dirty games, no more days full of blame,
Baby believe me, I'll never cry for you, never cry for you
I can't see a way for you and me
Broken promises tell me: our memories will never come to be
I hope you'll find the right way
That's always for what I pray
But don't fill my heart with pain,
I'll say it to you again and again

[Refrain]

[Live performance only:]
Maybe this song wasn't the whole truth
But baby believe me, I'll never cry for you, never cry for you
I don't; but if I can, I'll carry it like a man
So I hope, despite our promises: our memories will come to be
Times will come and times will go
I hope time will show
But don't fill my heart with pain,
I'll say it to you again and again

[Refrain]
