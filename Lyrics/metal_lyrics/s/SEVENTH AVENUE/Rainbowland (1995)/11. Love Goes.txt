They love your body
It's perfect and without flaw
And with the right clothes
Even the dead rise to their feet
What do you have to do
So that they all will love you?
How long will it last?
Love - that's just a cloud

[Chorus:]
Not only nights full of storm I know
This love is a gun
Sometimes I don't know right or wrong, but I know
This love was here and is gone

[Refrain:]
Come on and open your eyes
Turn your head back from the wall
Don't tell yourself these lies
Your perspective isn't that small
Don't get too caught up in the ways of this world
They'll tear you up and throw you down
Come on and open your eyes
You've got to think and rise

They love your success
And they love your possessions
So many things, but always the same
If you're not on the top you're the wart
And they'll all just pass by
How long will it last?
Love - that's just a cloud

[Chorus]

[Refrain]
