[Refrain:]
Way to paradise
Now you can't see how nice
Way to paradise
Take off all your lies
Break down the wall
Now it's time for all
Fight against the sin
Don't let the devil win
Don't let the devil win

Blow up the wall
Which prevent you from being reborn
Destroy the chain
Which prevent you from a new beginning
Pray to Jesus
And follow him

[Refrain]

In the life after life
In a night without darkness
We will see the perfect freedom
Although you think
We are captives of the bible
But that's the map of our life

[Refrain]
