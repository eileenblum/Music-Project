Faster than fast your time is running
Day by day
You know what you do, you do what you want
Living your life
Be one of the top, you want to exalt yourself
You
Against devil and death with your fate in your hands

All you wanna be
Rest in peace
You've lost your own chance, forever
All you wanna be
Rest in peace
Never, there's no return, ever

People are living to fast they're bleeding so hard
But not you
You're just hunting the future, hunting some
destiny in time
searching, not finding, loving but killing
lead by the devils arms
Are you beating your enemies, killing your friends
In the end you will killing yourself

All you wanna be
Rest in peace
You've lost your own chance, forever
All you wanna be
Rest in peace
Never, there's no return, ever

Can you feel Satan
He'll destroy your life
There is just one chance
Turn your life, repent your sins

You will never be
Rest in peace
You will never be
Whenever you see light
At every turn
Take it deep inside
