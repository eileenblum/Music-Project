I am the Resurrection and I am the Life, says the Lord.
Whoever has faith in me shall have life, even though he die.
And everyone who has life, and has committed himself to me in faith, shall not die for ever.
As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives and that at the last he will stand upon the earth.
After my awaking he will raise me up; and in my body I shall see God.
I myself shall see, and my eyes behold him who is my friend and not a stranger.
Christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death, and giving life to those in the tomb.
The Sun of Righteousness is gloriously risen, giving light to those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death.
The Lord will guide our feet into the way of peace, having taken away the sin of the world.
Christ will open the kingdom of heaven to all those who believe in his Name, saying, Come, O blessed of my Father; inherit the kingdom prepared for you.
In paradise may the angels lead you.
At your coming may the martyrs receive you, and bring you into the holy city, Jerusalem.
Everyone the Father gives to me will come to come; I will never turn away anyone who believes in me.
He who raised Jesus Christ from the dead will also give life to our mortal bodies through his indwelling Spirit.
My heart, therefore, is glad, and my spirit rejoices; my body also shall rest in hope.
You will show me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy, and in your right hand are pleasures for evermore.
O God, whose blessed Son was laid in a sepulchre in the garden: Bless, we pray, this grave, and grand that he whose body is buried here may dwell with Christ in paradise, and may come to our heavenly kingdom; through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.
Rest In Peace.
