We live in a world full of pain and hate man
We live for a life after life to see them
I see my father with his open arms he says
Come on everybody lift your hands up and pray
Crime and terror every day on the street
Fire of destruction in the face of the heat
The hawk of evil will extricate your soul
Headless children run for their last fall

[Chorus:]
He died on the cross for you and for me
That everybody in the world could see
He is the only one who can save us
He is the only one his name is Jesus
J-E-S-U-S Jesus was his name
J-E-S-U-S Jesus was his name

[Refrain:]
Praise him 'cause he can change you
He is the king of kings
Praise him 'cause you can taste him
He is the prince of peace

You scatter your time in the vortex of every day
You spend your life without law in anarchy
The devil has opened the battle to your soul
He wants to tear you in a black hole
He anasty your conscience with his dirty venom
So you can't see that he is the greatest loon
If you're not alone his venom has no chance
Father was your antidote bible evidence

[Chorus]

[Refrain]

There is one light where you can hold on
There comes the time when we can catch the crown
After the days in which you can say something
You have no chance to turn back and pray
I hope in these days of thunder and firerain
You don't need tears of blood and loose your brain
Open the way to the bride of your heart
Only the way to the right eternal start

[Chorus]

[Refrain]

King of kings and lord of lord glory hallelujah
King of kings and lord of lord glory hallelujah
Jesus prince of peace glory hallelujah
Jesus prince of peace glory hallelujah
