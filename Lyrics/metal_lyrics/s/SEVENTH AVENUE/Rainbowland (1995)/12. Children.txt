Waste my life and see tomorrow
Waste my life and see today
See this world full of pain and horror
Why can't they understand?

Hear the children cry
In this world of war
See your mother die
With her babies in her arms

Overfed with crime and terror
Sitting, watching war TV
Demonstrating people want to
Live in peace and harmony

Hear the children cry
In this world of war
See your mother die
With her babies in her arms

After all this time there never will be crime
After all this time where children never die
After all this time the sun is shining bright
After all this time you'll feel no loneliness

Hear the children cry
In this world of war
See your mother die
With her babies in her arms

After all this time there never will be crime
After all this time where children never die
After all this time the sun is shining bright
After all this time you'll feel no loneliness
