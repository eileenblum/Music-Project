If your mother dies,
You will pray;
If your father dies,
You will to God all say;
If your sister is raped
Then you will pray
If your girl gets a baby
Then you will to God all say.

[Refrain:]
Pray, now there's time to say
Pray, now it's time for a new beginning
A prayer in the night, sometimes seems like a fight
A prayer from the heart is bringing sunshine in the dark

If you have to pass an exam,
Then you will pray;
If you take by force a bank,
Even then you will to God all say
You pray to God in your life;
You say him all your wishes
Won't you end with your sin,
God helps you go the way to him.

[Refrain]

You'll see a prayer makes you free, makes you free
Then you'll see no danger, you are free, you are free
