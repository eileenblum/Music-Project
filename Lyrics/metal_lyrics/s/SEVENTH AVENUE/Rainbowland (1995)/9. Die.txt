It's hard to die
And you don't know
Where you will go;
The time runs down
You look at friends
Someone will ask
Where - where do you stand?
If the sound of graveyard bells
Go away from your friends
And they stay there -
Now where are your excuses
Where's the smile on your face?
You don't need tears in your eyes
And you need not weep and cry.

[Refrain:]
Alone, alone
With the father and the son
Alone, alone
What would you have done?
One day you will die
And, I hope, you need not cry

Don't wait until
Your death
Make everything clear
In your life
Don't believe
Your good acts were enough
Only grace
Counts in the front of the judge

[Refrain]

You don't need tears in your eyes
And you need not weep and cry.
God has given his son
For what you have done.

[Refrain]
