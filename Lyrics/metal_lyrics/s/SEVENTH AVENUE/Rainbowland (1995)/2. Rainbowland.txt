Life isn't as colourful as it once was
The colour of blood determines the day
Warring countries, warring streets
Shots ringing through each dark night
And you hear the children screaming
You could, if you would, hear the unborn cry
No cry as in good past days
Or on better ways

[Chorus:]
And you darken your brow in consternation
Asking me, pleading me, fully against
How one can live, hope, or dream today
Without resigning or drowning

The end of a day, worse than yesterday
No work, no money, no land in sight
Only one thing's for sure: It can't get worse
'Cause you've reached the pit
Just enjoying TV, watching the killing,
'Till you turn away, 'cause you're hurt inside
But the stillness of evening is ravaged by a scream
And a siren blares through the night

[Refrain:]
Give me your hand, I will show you the way
To the Rainbow Land
'Cause the meaning of life is to live after life
And you need not commit suicide
Give me your hand, I will show you the way
To the Rainbow Land
Come with me on a trip where you can see
The way to the Rainbow Land

The rich and famous are dying in drugs
Or into materialism or a new religion
And everyone else is following blindly
Not as much cash, but they are doing it
Just don't stand so you can think
Don't look behind or you'll realize the game
Who cares what it costs, if it's not your money
What does it matter, if you have the gain?

[Chorus]

I tell you: Life is a long journey
There is a time after time without time
And there will be two heavens in eternity
You can tell them Rainbow Land and downtown
Or you can say heaven and hell
They are just names, the places remain
You're deciding now, where you'll be then
It's the story of Rainbow Land , from the book of life.

[Refrain]
