[M: Herbie Langhans; L: Mike Pfluger]

Rays of light slowly pave the way
For the all swalloling darkness
Right beteween the universe
Where time was led astray

Where the forgotten thoughts dwell
Where ghosts of shadows roam
Maybe the dream of a dream
Now you think at the only one who could tell

So take a step beteween the worlds
With both feet on the ground
Time stands still as years pass by
Your silent screams will never die

Just believe in this one thing
When it is over it just will start
But you have to decide before
Impossible? Oh no, my friend
Due to the past eternity
God passes judgment on you

Dimly thoughts come cleare now
Who are you, who have you been
Now your mind is coming keen
And a scary certainy grows

I am dead
That can't be true
But life's not what it seems
I am mad
That is the truth
"You're not" my brain still screams

So take a step beteween the worlds
With both feet on the ground
Time stands still as years pass by
Your silent screams will never die

I am here beteween the worlds
My feet are off the ground
Time stands still as years pass by
Now my past has sealed my fate

Just believe in this one thing
When it is over it just will start
But you have to decide before
Impossible? Oh no, my friend
Due to the past eternity
God passes judgment on you

I believe in this one thing
When it is over it just will start
But I have to decide before
Impossible? Oh no, my friend
The saviour just has paid for me
On that cross upon the hill
