[M: Herbie Langhans and Geronimo Stade; L: Geronimo Stade]

I will always remember the day
That day when you came in my life
You bound my look and touched my soul
From here to eternity

[BRIDGE]
I don't know how to reach you
To reach is just too far
Your name always reminds me
To the dreams of my heart

[CHORUS]
Now I'm standing here
Gazing the 7th heaven
And I hope you hear my whisper
Listen to my silent screams
When I close my eyes and think at you
Remember what you'd done for me
Long before I took my first breath
You saved me from eternal death

I'm walking through the city
The streets are wet tonight
My past is running through my brain
And I am wondering why

I can feel the touch of your love
As if it was a real touch
Eternal silence bites my soul
And I don't know how to reach you

[BRIDGE]
I don't know how to tell you
Just what you mean to me
Your name always reminds me
To the dreams of my heart

[CHORUS]
