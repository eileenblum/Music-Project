I know it's wrong - I know what's right
I'm someone on your side
I don't want to stand - I don't want to go
I'm searching for someone without a show

Protection of fool - I don't know how I can do
Protection of fool - Maybe it's a wrong thing to do
Protection of fool - I don't know how I can do
Protection of fool - Maybe it's a wrong thing to do
Take me in - lift me up - please me to - pray for me

I have left my own and I have waste
Now I'm searching for a brand new taste
Love was a risk but love was great
Could be for me it was too late

Protection of fool - I don't know how I can do
Protection of fool - Maybe it's a wrong thing to do
Protection of fool - I don't know how I can do
Protection of fool - Maybe it's a wrong thing to do
Take me in - lift me up - please me to - pray for me

I'm waiting for you I'm waiting for the day
Where we together for our future could pray
Good times will come, bad times will blow
Father please show me the right way to go

Protection of fool - I don't know how I can do
Protection of fool - Maybe it's a wrong thing to do
Protection of fool - I don't know how I can do
Protection of fool - Maybe it's a wrong thing to do
Take me in - lift me up - please me to - pray for me
