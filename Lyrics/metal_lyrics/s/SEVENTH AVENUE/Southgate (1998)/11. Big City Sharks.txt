They are everywhere and always there
At anytime and anywhere
They don't foul up Never!
They know everything about everyone
They know everything about you
Everyone knows and fears them
They are the untouchables
Don't ever cross with them
If you do, you'll be the next one

[Chorus:]
Big city sharks their shadows aren't just in the city
Big city sharks they'll find your weakness too
Big city sharks straight thinkers always right
Big city sharks they'll show you your facts too

So strong everyone astounded
So stupid everyone's screaming
So smart and perfectly gifted
That they only cry when they're alone

[Chorus]

Hey shark who but you loves you?
Hey shark there is one you don't love him
Hey shark you can't fool him
Hey shark don't forget that you are not God!
They drive better whatever that means
They love much better however that goes
Someday you'll see their weaknesses too
cause one day they'll stand before God too.

[Chorus]
