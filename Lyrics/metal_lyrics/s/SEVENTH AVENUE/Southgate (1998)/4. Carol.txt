You told me you don't hold much to life
Why you didn't want to tell me
Carol N, 24 - Jumped out of the 30th floor
I fear the day of this headline
Carol, please don't go. Carol
Bloody face, distorted and lifeless
Clammy hands - fear of what could be
You don't believe there's anything after death
I fear I'm talking against the wall

Carol - No life in your dreams
Carol - Cool as ice it seems
And in your eyes there is a lonely empty place
I can see it, if I look deep in your face

Life is rough, at least the trivial things
But maybe not what's most important
Cross, love, fantasies - does all pass?
All conspire against you - caution who dares!
Carol please don't go. Carol
Don't drink the sepultre of finality
I'm honest - and you must be too
Don't play games, they'll play with you
Only cowards run - you have no reason

Carol - No life in your dreams
Carol - Cool as ice it seems
And in your eyes there is a lonely empty place
I can see it, if I look deep in your face
