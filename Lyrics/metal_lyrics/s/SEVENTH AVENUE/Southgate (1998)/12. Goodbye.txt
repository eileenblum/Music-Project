Now it's time for a break and if we don't we make a mistake
We walk for time on the line, to say goodbye - I have seen the sign.
We have to say goodbye, and if we say it, it's no lie,
So if we could see us again may the same flame burn within.

Goodbye my friend but that's no separation forever
Goodbye my friend, please don't look back - goodbye.
God bless you on all your ways that's my prayer for you
Goodbye my friend, I will be here for you - goodbye.
Every day goes by
Farewell my friend
Time to say goodbye
Farewell my friend
Goodbye

I pray that the day will come,
where we will belong to him
I wish you true friends on your way
and more wisdom day by day

My wishes are for you, and every day a piece of truth too
I'll never forgot you, I promise, memories of you - for me a secret bliss.

Goodbye my friend but that's no separation forever
Goodbye my friend, please don't look back - goodbye.
God bless you on all your ways that's my prayer for you
Goodbye my friend, I will be here for you - goodbye.
Every day goes by
Farewell my friend
Time to say goodbye
Farewell my friend
Goodbye

If the night envelops you - don't forget me.
If the thunder smashes you - don't forget me.
I am here and if you get fear - don't forget me.
If you need me, come to me, cause I'll wait for you forever;
I am here and if you get fear - don't forget me.
If you need me or it's necessary, I'll wait for you forever;

Goodbye my friend but that's no separation forever
Goodbye my friend, please don't look back - goodbye.
God bless you on all your ways that's my prayer for you
Goodbye my friend, I will be here for you - goodbye.
Every day goes by
Farewell my friend
Time to say goodbye
Farewell my friend
Goodbye
