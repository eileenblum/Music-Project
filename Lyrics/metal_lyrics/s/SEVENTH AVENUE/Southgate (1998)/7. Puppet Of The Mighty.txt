Unknown soldier, I stand here at your grave
And thoughts are running through my brain
Perhaps, when the war begun you were as old as I am
And it took your dreams, took your dreams
Unknown soldier I stand here at your grave
Only born and brought up for the war
Only killing around to live obediently until death
For your native land

[Chorus:]
Puppet of the mighty
You have seen how they died, belonged to their cries
Not those who wanted the war and fought the battle at home
Puppet of the mighty
The poison of fear has poisoned you
With us the threads of the puppet are destroyed anyhow

Unknown soldier every year in front of your grave
They stand and hold speeches and were never there
The war has hardly passed, new weapons for the country
And your death was for nothing, was really for nothing

[Chorus]

Puppet of the mighty you have seen how they died
Puppet of the mighty belonged to their cries
Day by day only the fear it had poisoned you.
Live for death and die for nothing
Everything senseless all for the mighty
They think they are God
But God doesn't want this insanity
You could say that I'm ill
But one day they'll get their bill

[Chorus]

Puppet of the mighty you have seen how they died
Puppet of the mighty belonged to their cries
Day by day only the fear it had poisoned you
