Up 'til now everything was alright
You and I - side by side
Every day and every night
But now comes a wild tide

I have given you every freedom
Don't ever want to constrict you
And you could not evade it
wouldn't see the danger through him

Face To Face - May the best one win
Face To Face - The ice is getting thin
Face To Face - The battle has begun
Face To Face - And there was no run
Face To Face - May The Best One win - Face To Face

She never knows what she wants
confusion and torn feelings in her;
don't know what's wrong or right
Nightmare of feelings for the bride

We lose two people if we lose
can anyone really win this
everyone must give up at least once
too much freedom too much trouble
But may the better one win
But may the best one win

Face To Face - May the best one win
Face To Face - The ice is getting thin
Face To Face - The battle has begun
Face To Face - And there was no run
Face To Face - May The Best One win - Face To Face

He was my best friend until now - something starts which none wants
Nothing can ever be as it was - feels like a drama in a bad movie
