Can we be friends forever? After death we will see us never?
You're living your life and can't understand how I live mine.

Father hear my cry tonight
Father listen to me
Father with open eyes he cannot see
Father make him - please make him free

There is a party in heaven for a sinner who sees his chance
There will be a pleasure dance for a sinner who sees his chance

Father hear my cry tonight
Father listen to me
Father with open eyes he cannot see
Father make him - please make him free

If you hear this song remember it could be your last
Or do you really know that you will live tomorrow
What will be in a life after death, are you ready to die
Are you really ready to die just think about it

Father hear my cry tonight
Father listen to me
Father with open eyes he cannot see
Father make him - please make him free

I hope in heaven we can meet together
I hope you'll be there to have fun forever
You know the way to be
Pray, pray, pray then you will live forever.

Father hear my cry tonight
Father listen to me
Father with open eyes he cannot see
Father make him - please make him free
