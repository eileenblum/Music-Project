Don't tell me your part
In don't try to remember
I'll think about the start
About one day in December
You can't stand me
And I can't stand you
But today we can see
Sky is not always blue
Don't say you love me
Cause we both know you don't
Together - I feel it can't be
Try to leave you beyond
In the sky I see white doves
I know I can't stop loving you
Think about what's happen above
Doves of love doves of truth

[Chorus:]
You hold my heart in your hand
And you don't know what to do with it
You hold my heart in you hand
And play your games, castles in the sand

I'll try not to break
Turn my head up to live
Not do the same mistakes
But there is no way to give
And I'll pray for you
Yes, I get on my knees
You needed I know
Then I'll pray for me

[Chorus]

Stop! What do you want to do
With my heart in your hand?
Stop! I am not one of the things you can rent

[Chorus]

Stop! What do you want to do
With my heart in your hand?
Stop! I am not one of the things you can rent
