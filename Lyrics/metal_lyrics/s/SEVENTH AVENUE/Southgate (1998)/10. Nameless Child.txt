We get lost in our time for ourselves.
Is it really worth it to let the child die?
That nameless child in each of our life's
Don't look and chain it until it dies within!
I can not grasp and understand it anymore
You want the child in you dies and decays
Although you know it, admit it and find it OK
Believe it's better to be hard and unreachable

[Chorus:]
The child in each of us that nameless child
In the prison of so many of us
You child in each of us You nameless child
I'll pray that your time comes again

We work so many hours each new day, so many important
Reasons in all our acting. Not only the child in us also the real
Children decay for us, with us and die like the child in us
Why we became so blind? We don't know today whatever it
Isn't important for anybody. Let us finally learn from the errors
Of the past, get up to finally react, before both children die

[Chorus]

You let us laugh when there is nothing to laugh
Don't give up, endure for today
Child you let us believe, hope and dream
Don't give up, it isn't lost yet

[Chorus]

You let us laugh when there is nothing to laugh
Don't give up, endure for today
Child you let us believe, hope and dream
Don't give up, it isn't lost yet
