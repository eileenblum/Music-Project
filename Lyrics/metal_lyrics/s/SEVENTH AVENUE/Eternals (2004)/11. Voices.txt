When I am alone in the night I fear
To switch off the light
Although I'm alone a voice is whispering to me
It's like an ugly demon right beside my head
Oh how I hate his voice, I wish I'd have a choice
I don't want to hear the things he breathe in my ear
And if I try to hide the demon laughts at me

Oh I scream and I cry, I ask and deny
Nothing helps me, nothing alleviates
The voice still whispers
And I'm on to believe

Oh my child I know your fears
And I see what it looks inside you
I had to go the same path long ago
Oh my child I see your tears
And be sure, I'm crying with you
I hope you'll take my hand and trust in me
Cause I died for you
There's nothing more to say

And if I'm praying to God there's silence in my head
But I know it won't last, the voices come so fast
And they steal the strenght which I got just before
Reproach me with my sins, saying I'm too far out
I start to believe, relapsing down to grief
Sorrow drowns me in a sea of pain

Oh I scream and I cry, I ask and deny
Nothing helps me, nothing alleviates
The voice still whispers
And I'm on to believe

Oh my child I know your fears
And I see what it looks inside you
I had to go the same path long ago
Oh my child I see your tears
And be sure, I'm crying with you
I hope you'll take my hand and trust in me
Cause I died for you
There's nothing more to say

It's a long way from the ground
From the darkness into light
Where the lies part from the truth
Where you you'll see clear
There are no more voices to fear
No voices to fear

Oh I scream and I cry, I ask and deny
Nothing helps me, nothing alleviates
The voice still whispers
And I'm on to believe

Oh my child I know your fears
And I see what it looks inside you
I had to go the same path long ago
Oh my child I see your tears
And be sure, I'm crying with you
I hope you'll take my hand and trust in me
Cause I died for you
There's nothing more to say
