Until now I have been running through my life
Thoughtless, careless no one reasons with me
For what? I am a king, I will never care
I will force you on your knees, drive up the wall
Be mine today, bow down and kiss my ass

Go down, deep down below
To the dephts of your soul
Your moan and your screams will
Just fade away, it all fades away

Raging Fire - in hell you will burn
Raging Fire - now it is the devils turn
Raging Fire - be afraid, it's for eternity
No man is able to protect you from Raging Fire

You have gone too far, reckoned without your host
Your life is not what it should, should be at all
Like the prodigal son, beyond redemption now
Everyone gives you a wide berth
But there is one who still hasn't forgotten you

Go down, deep down below
To the dephts of your soul
Your moan and your screams will
Just fade away, it all fades away

Raging Fire - in hell you will burn
Raging Fire - now it is the devils turn
Raging Fire - be afraid, it's for eternity
No man is able to protect you from Raging Fire

Raging Fire - in hell you will burn
Raging Fire - now it is the devils turn
Raging Fire - be afraid, it's for eternity
No man is able to protect you from Raging Fire

You laughted at your redeemer
And the devil laugthed at you
But you are not slaved to sin
The decision is on you
And in the last judgement
You will be known by your deed

Raging Fire - in hell you will burn
Raging Fire - now it is the devils turn
Raging Fire - be afraid, it's for eternity
No man is able to protect you from Raging Fire
