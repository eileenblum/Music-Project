A moment at the rim of now
Just a grain in the desert of chances
Your decision will rise or drag the fences
A spark in time, a hidden glow

Time on your hands
Waste it or use it
Could drive you round the bend
Time on your hands
Could give you a fit
Destination damnation?

Are you leaving for the moment?
Future tale
Trying to hide in the past
Oh, eternity is awaiting you
Future tale
No matter what you will do
Why don't you be an actor in my future tale?

All the winces that you may fear
Uniting now and form the past
You have forgotten them so fast
But not one of them will disappear

Are you leaving for the moment?
Future tale
Trying to hide in the past
Oh, eternity is awaiting you
Future tale
No matter what you will do
Why don't you be an actor in my future tale?

Time on your hands
Waste it or use it
Could drive you round the bend
Time on your hands
Could give you a fit
Destination damnation?

Are you leaving for the moment?
Future tale
Trying to hide in the past
Oh, eternity is awaiting you
Future tale
No matter what you will do
Are you leaving for the moment?
Future tale
Trying to hide in the past
Oh, eternity is awaiting you
Future tale
No matter what you will do
Why don't you be an actor in my future tale?

Eternity will be forever
Remind this for your masterplan
One day you'll see your final dawn
Then it is time for the review
