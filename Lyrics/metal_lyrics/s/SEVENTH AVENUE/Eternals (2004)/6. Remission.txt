In this world full of selfishness
The semblance of control in every mind
Only a madman's lucid interval
The world's mainspring grows weary

Abandoned all hope of resurrection
In fact she came within an ace of losing
And her whole life is like a tale of woe
She's yearning for a better time to come

Can you hear her crying?
Thinking that she is lost in a overcrowded world
Who will ever care, keeping an eye on her?
Will there be forgiveness somewhere?

Now si is too strong
No wall is too high
The power of the cross shines from the sky
To grasp takes long
Get it with a sigh
Remission of sins is shining bright

The ugly demon whispers in her mind
No one loves you, never ever
What you've done is far too much
I still have you in my grip

He is not one of those vendors
Who sell salvation for a buck
Don't you listen to his lies!
Cause your debts are already paid

Can you hear her crying?
Thinking that she is lost in a overcrowded world
Who will ever care, keeping an eye on her?
Will there be forgiveness somewhere?

Now si is too strong
No wall is too high
The power of the cross shines from the sky
To grasp takes long
Get it with a sigh
Remission of sins is shining bright

The one without sin
Shed his blood on the cross
For the remission of sins
All she has to do is to accept

Now si is too strong
No wall is too high
The power of the cross shines from the sky
To grasp takes long
Get it with a sigh
Remission of sins is shining bright
