On the first day of creation
There is only water everywhere
The raging ocean covers everything
And darkness engulfs the whole world
The power of God moves over the seas
Eternal holy spirit as the first on the earth

Before the creation of mankind
Satan was falling like lightning from the sky
He was thrown down to earth
And all his angels were fallen with him
With fierce in the eye and a spark of rebellion
They started to fight for the destiny of each soul

Infity leads into eternity
Far beyond comprehension
But deep on the ground of your heart you guess
It will come as sure as death

Eternal war
Eternal peace
Eternal life
At the end of days
These eternals are etched
Deep into the bones of this never mending world

There shall be no more night
Cause the lord our God will be our light
And we will rule as kings
From then into all eternity
[Offb. 22,5]

But there also will be a lake of fire
And this will be the second death
For all those who have refused to accept
The remission by Jesus

Eternal war
Eternal peace
Eternal life
At the end of days
These eternals are etched
Deep into the bones of this never mending world

We are living now in a deceptive peaceful world
In our eyes all around us is only harmony
We are smilling at God and hell is just a fairytale
But in the end we will realize the war for our souls
Cause in the end

God will sit on his throne
Heaven and earth and all the creatures
Pass away on that day
All are leaving now their graves, the unjust besides the fair
Now it is time for the court and all will be judged

Infity leads into eternity
Far beyond comprehension
But deep on the ground of your heart you guess
It will come as sure as death

Eternal war
Eternal peace
Eternal life
At the end of days
These eternals are etched
Deep into the bones of this never mending world

There shall be no more night
Cause the lord our God will be our light
And we will rule as kings
From then into all eternity
[Offb. 22,5]

But there also will be a lake of fire
And this will be the second death
For all those who have refused to accept
The remission by Jesus

Infity leads into eternity
Far beyond comprehension
But deep on the ground of your heart you guess
It will come as sure as death

Eternal war
Eternal peace
