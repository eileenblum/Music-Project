An existence in rebellion against God
Always hold the line of least resistance
It's the read thread running straight through my life
Although I yearn for commandments of God
My life nevertheless determinated from evil
My life nevertheless determinated from hell

Domination of sin
Bound to sacrilege
Domination of sin
Slaved to the eternal death?

The entire mankind is enslaved to sin
No one is put right with God by means of the law
The father of sin is sitting on his throne
Murder, hate, envy, lie and infidelity
Are lacing the world to his domination
Are lacing the world to his commands

Domination of sin
Bound to sacrilege
Domination of sin
Slaved to the eternal death?

Did I succumb really to eternal death?
An inner evil fight in me by order of sin
Against the law of the good which I want to do
Who will free me from this vicious circle?
Thank God! I am already freed by the cross!
Thank God! I am already freed by his son!

Domination of sin
Bound to sacrilege
Domination of sin
Slaved to the eternal death?
