For a much too long time
We didn't know what's going on
It almost seemed as if we didn't want to
Our world is like a cage
A cell painted in grey
And someone made us believe that grey is okay

Oh, we were like sheep led to the slaughter
Never mind what's going on
Oh, a grain of sand among a million
Lying on the beach of the sea of forgotten dreams

Do you hear the satan's laughter as
He is ringing mankind's knell
His lullaby still keeps us sleeping on
Far beyond our dreams there is a battle roaring
But our hearts reaches just a silent whisper

It's the hunger for life
That burns deep in us all
Maybe a little spark in a dark universe
Our eyes may be blind
But our hearts already see
The betrayal of mankind's enemy

Wake up, my child, wake up
Open up your eyes and see
The deadly night for you is over
Dreams of cruelty will no longer determine your life
Cause Jesus fought the battle just for you

It's the hunger for life
That burns deep in us all
Maybe a little spark in a dark universe
Our eyes may be blind
But our hearts already see
The betrayal of mankind's enemy

Oh, we were like sheep led to the slaughter
Never mind what's going on
Oh, a grain of sand among a million
Lying on the beach of the sea of forgotten dreams

It's the hunger for life
That burns deep in us all
Maybe a little spark in a dark universe
Our eyes may be blind
But our hearts already see
The betrayal of mankind's enemy

No more fear the beast
Even if it is still raging
And your new life has begun
No more need to fear 'cause we are children of the king

It's the hunger for life
That burns deep in us all
Maybe a little spark in a dark universe
Our eyes may be blind
But our hearts already see
The betrayal of mankind's enemy
