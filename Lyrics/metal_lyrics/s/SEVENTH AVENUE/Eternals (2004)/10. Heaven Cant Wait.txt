Eternity is awaiting us
But we are breathing dust of hate
Imprisioned in a dark cold world
Agreeing to our fate
The warden makes us believe
That all is always in control
Cause he is the master of deception
He longs for our souls

But the curtain has fallen
And we can see the light of day
Redeemer came and set us free
With the key to eternity, key to eternity

It is more than just a feeling
More than just a tear in your eye
Changes may come and people pass by
But this one will stay
You know deep in your heart
No time to lose cause heaven can't wait

Truth is right before our eyes
But lies are leading us astray
We don't make up our minds about it
Agree to our fate?
The new world is opened up wide
The warden now is discarted
Salvation is just a step away
Leave the cage behind

Desperation is taking over
Freeing at the Greek calends
Forever trapped in that damned cage?
Time to relieve is time to believe

Now the curtain is torn
A living way through endless night
Jesus came to set us free
He is the key to eternity, key to eternity

It is more than just a feeling
More than just a tear in your eye
Changes may come and people pass by
But this one will stay
You know deep in your heart
No time to lose cause heaven
It is more than just a feeling
More than just a tear in your eye
Changes may come and people pass by
But this one will stay
You know deep in your heart
No time to lose cause heaven can't wait
