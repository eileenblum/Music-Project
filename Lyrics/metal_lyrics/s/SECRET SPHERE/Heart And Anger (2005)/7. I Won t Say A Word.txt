I close my eyes, I see us still
I go on hearing our words
Don't know the street you're walking through
But sometimes in my mind
Old memories come back like thorns in my heart
Though time the flames still burns
Behind this smile

Every time you feel, every time you need
Every time I won't say a word
For every joy, every pain
I never meant to hurt you
You're so far from my eyes but close to heart
I'm lost in haze of memories

You don't know but I hold you here
Like a picture of yours
Inside me, among these words you live
You live always in my soul
A special place inside me

...I am lost in haze of an old memory of yours
It seems to bring to another life
I forget in vain 'cause the shadows remain the same
I come back to my life, let you live yours
Walls and streets, so many miles keep us apart
But I wrote these words
I hope the wind will blow them to you

I am lost in old memories
