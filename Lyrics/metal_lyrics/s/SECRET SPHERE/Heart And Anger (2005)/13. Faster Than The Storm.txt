If we go faster than the storm
If you take my hand
We can't do it now
You are not by my side
We should need to go...

Laying in dark alone
Side by side, next to me
But thousand miles away from me
You were sleeping there
My heart began to beat
Faster than I could understand

Then the night grew louder and
The thunders breaking sky
Tok the rhythm of my heart
When the night grows loud inside be ready
For the fight we can only survive

If we go faster than the storm
If you take my hand now we can leave behind
All the pain and tears so, now we just need to go
Faster than the storm
If you take my hand now, but it's not your time
Feel the storm, it's coming closer...

I never was afraid
Joking with myself
If I fall asleep tomorrow
Love may just fade away
