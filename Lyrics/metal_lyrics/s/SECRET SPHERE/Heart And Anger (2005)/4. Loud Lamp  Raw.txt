Burning down the theatre, fire crawling from the ground
Bands up to the sky, we bring you down into hell
Coming from your nightmares raise the deepest of your fears
All night long we'll shake your mind on the edge of sanity

My blood runs cold tonight
High upon the stars my endless will
Is talking through your eyes and me
Every single sight's forever
High upon the stars my will
Is running through your eyes and me
Every single sight's forever

Loud and raw, devil's call
From the night to feed fire that keep your dreams alive
Free the power within your body and soul
As long as you're loud and raw

Dark embrace your senses
Madness is your only guide
In this new dimension there's no rule, no fear

Loud and raw
It's the awaken of your soul
Now close that chapter of your life
Every window is opened
To a different world
