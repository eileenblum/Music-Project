Sensations rise above your eyes
Bad thoughts surround your soul

Scream as something's burning inside
There are flames rain can't blow
Sometimes thoughts are blades cutting your soul
Time turns into hell

Rise sensations, wanna forget suffocating
Your body is your cage, ask with no answers
No light near, face of rage
You are exploding

Forever set me free
You feel a scream tearing your heart
Forever set me free
You're the only one who's healing the voice of your soul

You would stop here, but escape far
All you got is not enough
