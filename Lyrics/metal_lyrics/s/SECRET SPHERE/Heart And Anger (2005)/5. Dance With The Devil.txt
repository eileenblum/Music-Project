Walking on a razor's edge together
Living in an underworld
Creatures of the night we are
Like vampires we are king of the darkness

With us you're gonna play with fire burning in your heart
Set free the energy running through your veins

When the shadows call you take their hand
Ten thousand dreams are layin' ahead
Leave the fears behind, dance with the devil
Hear the shadows whispering your name
Ten thousand souls are playing the game
Take his hand tonight, dance with the devil

Like a hellish circle, sensual stares
Surrounded by black veils
Sexy witches move around you
Princess of the damned with angels' eyes that kill

With us you're gonna play with fire
Burning in your heart
Set free your wild side screaming in silence

Shadows call you
