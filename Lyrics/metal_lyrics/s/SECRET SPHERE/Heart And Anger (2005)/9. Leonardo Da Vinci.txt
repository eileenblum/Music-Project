How many pages and hidden words?
From the abyss of time the mystery lives on
Sign of tempation, eternal quest
Ancient codes reveal the key of the holy symbol

Graceful rose, star divine
Truth reflected in the eyes of all
Graceful rose, star divine
In master's lovin' art she lays

Oh genius of all times universal mind
Is your heart keepin' a secret?
The shadows on your life unsolved mysteries
Is your heart keepin' a secret?

From the last supper, to eternal works
Under sign of the cross in the canavas of a painted
Disciples of mysteries
Cradle of the holy quest
