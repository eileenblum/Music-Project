[Japanese Bonus Track]It was night, truly night,
that bright day when the sun shone on us,
the spark of your human soul forced me to love,
not to kiss, you're too burning,
after a breath, hold tight,
down to the abyss we go, of hope

I still don't know just who you are,
but take my hand so we can go
down to the hole of my soul.

It was night, truly night that day
the bright day when the sun shone on us,
through your small eyes I see the pain,
all the pain of hell,
because of love, because of hope,
there are drops on your skin,
just keep up my step through the rain.

I still don't know just who you are,
but take my hand so we can go
down to the hole of my soul,
just walk with me down through the rain,
I'm standing close so we can lay,
down to the hole of my life.

No one'll ever know, the time is running out,
but still we're together alone,
I'm lost but never gone, just as thee,
hold my hand, 'coz we'll need to forget what's around,
and I'm losing you, I'm losing you

I didn't know just who you are,
just take my hand to get away, falling in love,
I still remember who you are,
but as we walked together, love,
downfall depart, I'm not gone.
