There's a path, it leads you from the world you know
Straight to the unmaterial dimension
We are all there as nakes souls
Not alone, nothing useless lives there or it's wondered

She comes and takes me away
She says - I wanna show you something new
Oh takes me away, takes me away

Leaving all that I need
To celebrate and expire on fire
Loosing all that I know
Praying all that I bleed
To celebrate and expire on fire
Loosing all that I know

It's old as earth and it's me, older than a stone
Purer than water that wets my body
Wash away all my material
Nothing useless lives there or it's wondered

She comes and takes me away
She says - I wanna show you something new
Oh takes me away

Fear
Leaving all that I need
To celebrate and deny desire
