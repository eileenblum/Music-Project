Now leave behind all the fears
All the tears
And the pain you feel
Take heart of mine
All my dreams wipe the worries
As you still don't know
If you

Still I don't know
If it's me I can't find
Love in your cold eyes
Still I don't blow
If it's me unsatisfied
To feel so dark
In such a day bright

A have called you
A thousand times per day
Seeking for those words
I never hear
All in a moment
I close my eyes and realize
Never had so many questions
No answer was what I wanted to know

Still I don't know
If it's me I can't find
Love in your cold eyes
Still I don't know
If it's me unsatisfied
To feel so dark
In such a day bright

I don't wanna make
The worst mistake of my life
Hold me tight please someone help me
Not to feel always thirsty
Still I don't know
