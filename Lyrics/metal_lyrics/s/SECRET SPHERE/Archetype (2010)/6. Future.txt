Visions from another world, another me, another you
The same we are but reading between the lines
Secret of the undisclosed to the prophet and his eyes
Unspoken words of the world define the rights
Future

No future no past no joy no rest
Elementary truth hidden to the eyes of the most

Lost in illusions so far, a dreamer that suffers, bold
But gaze in the eyes of a liar
Lost in illusions of mine, A dreamer that suffers, bold
But raise the light of a fire, fire

Time has come so prepare, another me another you
The same we are, but ride across the lines
Secret of the undisclosed, to the prophet and his eyes
Untouched worlds, unshivered night of light
Future 
I'll come when I hear your call
I'll come when I hear your call

No future no past begins the quest
chose a road for now you're willing to dare

Lost in illusions so far, a dreamer that suffers, bold
But gaze in the eyes of a liar
Lost in illusions of mine, A dreamer that suffers, bold
But raise the light of a fire, fire

Oh narrow minds just beneath your eyes a sacrifice
Who's dying is the truth and the killer is you

Lost in illusions so far, a dreamer that suffers, bold
But gaze in the eyes of a liar
Lost in illusions of mine, A dreamer that suffers, bold
But raise the light of a fire, fire
