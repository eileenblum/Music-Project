How can we grow up there's something wrong in this pain
A heaven is stained in vain
Stay forever hold me tight
Stay forever hold me down
Of a boy of a girl
Lost in the haze of a dream that fell apart

We bring peace, we save, we control
So they say
Bring guns and bombs
In your sky we fly high

Legal wildness
Corrupted games
Soldiers of unholy war
Of the nations killers

They wear uniforms and helmets
Toys of children
They're so proud of writing "death from above"

[Chorus]

Death from above, love from the ground
Pain machine providers of a crazy hell
Death from above, blood around
Desperate cries screaming out in pain

Invading frustrating
Hunting and raping
Fighting for playing
While leaders just gain

Flag painted blood
In the name of humanity
In the circle of time

They wear uniforms and helmets
Toys of children
They're so proud of writing "death from above"

[repeat chorus]

They wear uniforms and helmets
Toys of children
They're so proud of writing "death from above"

[repeat chorus]
