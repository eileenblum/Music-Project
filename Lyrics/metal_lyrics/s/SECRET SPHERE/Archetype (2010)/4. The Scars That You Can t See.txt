For all those years of night
I saw the truth behind the past
Unspoken words, cold as ice, a crown of thorns
Above my head, a drop of blood in a sea of lies

[bridge]

Is dying in my hands this story
I can feel my winter slowly comes
Another day, another night I can't wait forever for a change
Still not black enough for my bleeding heart

[chorus]

A whisper in the wind tries to say goodbye
This voice inside the air don't let me cry
Alone your breathe can heal my soul tonight
And the curtain falls on
The scars that you can't see
A fallen star with no desire and joy
Betrayer of a never ending oath
Alone your breath can heal your soul tonight
And the curtain falls on
The scars that you can't see

And the curtain falls on
The scares you can't see
A fallen star with no desire and joy
Betrayer of a never ending oath
Alone your breath can heal your soul tonight
And the curtain falls on
The scars that you can't see

As the candle
slowly burns
The source of sin
Corrupt the hands
Broken wings
To leave this world
Praying your god
To save your soul
Still I swim the shore
Frustrated as my winter never comes
Broken wings to leave this world
Praying your god to save your soul

[repeat bridge]
[repeat chorus]
[repeat bridge]

A whisper in the wind tries to say goodbye
This voice inside the air doesn't let me cry
Alone your breath can heal my soul tonight
