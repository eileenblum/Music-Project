New light, perfect weird
Flashes on the car glass
Some whores
Male or female who knows?
A long trip, a long road to nowhere
My car is faster driving further
Life is faster crashing harder

I hear a call
It's driving so far to die
It's coming harder to find
Release me from pain
I drive all night to get so closer to die
I'm close to deny
Lord of an empty heart

Another day, passed in a sunset frame of artwork
Flock of birds paint the sky and erase
A long trip, a long road to nowhere
This is the blame of the void inside

Everything stand still there
But shapes last flying moments

Everything stand still there
But shapes last flying moments
It's harder to understand
Recover me from madness
Takes me to the place you know
We can rest and wonder about... about, about what?
