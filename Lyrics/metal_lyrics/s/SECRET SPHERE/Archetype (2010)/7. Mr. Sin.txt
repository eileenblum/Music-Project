Another day has slipped away fast from you skin
The same ol' situation slowly is killing your dream
An old man used to say in life you get what you want
Now your world is crushing down and you're the one to change your end

I know the secret to be a better man
I have the cure to fight the demons of fate that crawling on you
crawling on you

Mr. sin has come for you, Mr. Sin a liar in the dark
When you hear the call, it's much too late
And see the eyes of a stranger

Welcome to you new world made of vices and vanities
Silhouttes on floor are dancing down on your knees
A private hell for perfect men with dirty games to play
Since the day she left your home

You got the secret, got the fame and got the shame on you
You lost the reason, alone you think back to times
When you were fightin to live fightin live

Mr. sin has come for you, Mr. Sin a liar in the dark
When you hear the call, it's much too late
And see the eyes of a stranger

But when you close you see
Maybe there's someone missing you

Mr. sin has come for you, Mr. Sin a liar in the dark
When you hear the call, it's much too late
And see the eyes of a stranger
