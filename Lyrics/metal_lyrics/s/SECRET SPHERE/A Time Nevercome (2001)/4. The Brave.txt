[The Sphere:]
Bagpipes resound
in the scottish silent
and cold wind of war,
attention and strain, oh cross th field,
looks against other looks,
hate, justice and rage,
freedom's the dream of a nation

[POST:]
[Aurienne (William):]
Oh sons of Scotland
we're here for our life,
we are born to be free
and so we'll be!

[PRE CHORUS:]
[Aurienne (William):]
All man die,
but not too many of them live actually,
it's time...open your eyes and your hear,
they can steal our life but not
our liberty's much stronger than fear

[CHORUS]
[Aurienne (William):]
I see the colours
of Scotland united
victory is now in our hands,
here among
the screams of joy,
sweat and blood,
the only word is freedom now
...dreams of freedom...

[#PRE CHORUS]

[Aurienne (William):]
Hate, justice and rage,
fight for your rights, fight for your life

[#PRE CHORUS]

[The Sphere:]
High battlecries,
among these mountains,
fight for your rigths, fight for your life

[#PRE CHORUS]

[#POST]

[#CHORUS]

[Aurienne (William):]
Cry no more,
wind is blowing far the tears
can't imprison me 'cause freedom
will live on her lips
