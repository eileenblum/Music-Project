[Aurienne (Mary):] I was born
to face the wild winds,
my face is angelic,
my heart's made of stone,
on wings of freedom
through oceans I'll fly 'till I'll die

[PRE CHORUS:]
The Sphere: So they love
as love in twain
two natures in one,
two is the number
in this love was slain

[CHORUS:]
[Aurinne (Mary):]
Look at the horizon
and feel the wind,
freedom's the fire
that burns in my soul,
hear the sea, touch my dream,
it is what I would die for

[Aurienne(Mary):]
I raise my head,
I close your eyes into the wind,
under Recham's flag, I cross my dreams
with my secret loveI fight,
I kill like a warrior,
until the end, before my farewell

[#PRE CHORUS]

[#CHORUS]

[Aurienne (Mary):]
Until the end
before my farewell,
under the flag of Mary Read,
inside a man, outside woman

[#PRE CHORUS]

[CHORUS]
[Aurienne (Mary):]
Look at the horizon far,
feel the wind of nevermore,
Freedom is the fire in my soul,
Freedom is what burns in the dark,
my dream it is what I will die for
