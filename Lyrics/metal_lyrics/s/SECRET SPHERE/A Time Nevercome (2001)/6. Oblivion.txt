[Aurienne (The Queen):]
Under the reign of sun
waves my soul,
inside a body of queen,
beats now my heart,
when sleeps a secret,
dismal theatre,
wrapped in mistery

[PRE CHORUS:]
[Lewis (The King):]
I am the lord of all
you can see,
I am all,
I am the king of everything
here on earth

[CHORUS:]
[The Sphere:]
Welcome to kingdom
of illusion lord of underworld,
ghost without a name
you spent your life in dark
victim of a secret, lord of silence,
[Lewis (The shadow):]
I call you from the dark,
I call you from my hell

[Lewis (The Shadow):]
Still I don't know,
my face prisoner
in the shadow of this cell,
my only comfort is in death

[PRE CHORUS:]
[Lewis (The Shadow):]
I'm afraid and confused,
but no one can hear my
silent cries I'm dying in my loneliness
and I don't know why

[#CHORUS]

[Aurienne (The Queen):]
I touch your cold lips,
can you forgive me?
