[Aurienne (Tristan):]
Hold on day by day,
I hear your whisper - 'Till the end of time... -
like the day when my - My dream came true -
I felt your essence became mine
in the heat of emotions

[PRE CHORUS:]
[Aurienne (Tristan):]
For your kiss I'd die
I stand before the window
waiting for my love, forever...

[CHORUS:]
[Aurinne(Tristan):]
The mistery of love
I have learnt,
in this journey through the endless,
strongest passions,
Every breathe, every heartbeat,
leave a message that will last forever,
forever

[Aurienne (Tristan):]
But the end
is knockin' on my door,
and my life will go on,
the land calls my name,
chasing thruth eternally,
now I'm gonna leave my heaven,
my destiny changes its way

[PRE CHORUS:]
[Aurienne (Tristan):]
Another sky I reach,
another air I breath,
Someday, I know,
my eyes will meet yours

Now I wonder, and waiting,
I wonder how my life goes on...wonder

[#CHORUS]
