[Aurienne (The spirits):]
Back from hell to get my revenge,
Lyonesse, my land will raise again
In the midnight sky the bells resound
It's time, my rage is the only law

[PRE CHORUS]

Remeber your skin, your eyes...all is lost
Ghost of desire now I'm pray for their damnation.
Remember my words "At the devil masquerade"
Your soul will be mine, I fell your fear,
Your trembly body, unconscious sense of strange
Now I'm here

[PRE CHORUS]

There's no way out,
the time has come to pay the price..pay my price

[CHORUS]

Take me far away, please raise me over the rainbow
Where your spirit will ride on, across my fairy land

Now, I close my eyes,
Nothing will tear us apart.
