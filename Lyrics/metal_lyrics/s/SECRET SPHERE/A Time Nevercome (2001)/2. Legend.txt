[The Sphere:]
Candlelight shades
dance upon her glance,
stands in loneliness,
her mind to hope...forever,
an angel without wings that's her destiny,
she feels the emptyness killing her soul

[PRE CHORUS:]
[The Sphere:] Rain, blood, storm and thunders,
run Aurienne through the night,
...storm and thunders, until

[CHORUS:]
[The Sphere:] I'll take your hands tonight,
you'll live over the ages and fly
through the gates of wisdom,
Your eyes will see the power,
the strenght of a world where
emotions and feelings are life

[Aurienne:] I see a sphere, shining bright,
it invades me, it fills my eyes

[The Sphere:] These words tear
a silence made of steel,
darkin' times were slowly rapin' her smile,
appears a tear, slowly falling,
bringing away the pain,
uh, the first tear of joy,
after the last one of sadness

[The Sphere:] Run Aurienne through the night, until

[#CHORUS]

[Aurienne:] Shadows surround my life,
I'll tear them,
with the force of mind,
I have no...fear,
never think you'd die without light,
you're much stronger

[Aurienne:] Wings of power now raise me
I'm overfliyng the time
