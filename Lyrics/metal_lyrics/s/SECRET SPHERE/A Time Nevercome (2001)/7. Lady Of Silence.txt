[The Sphere:]
The court of eternity
has given the sentence,
her mistery lives in the eyes of blinds,
condamned to a life without light
where love lives at the borders of reality

[PRE CHORUS:]
[Aurienne (Henry):]
Now your shiny will,
your will fills my eyes,
hold you memory
through this infinite dawn

[CHORUS:]
[Aurinne (Henry):]
I want you, I feel you,
you're in my heart forever,
this pain I feel,
my lady of silence,
surround me forever

[The Sphere:]
Fall from grace
and nigth falls down,
oh she can see,
her dreams become her nightmare
[Lady of Silence:]
nothing will come,
nothing will tear us apart
except my condamnation,
all the pain I'll live

until the end of time...

[#CHORUS]

[Aurienne (Henry):]
I breath the cold,
my neck skin crawl,
I look in darkness wondering where you are,
a shadow's there, stare in the eyes,
I try to kiss who nevermore will live

Where am I now? In a new dimension?
is it the reign of eternity?
I was fightened to loose my way,
like an angel I'm flying, flying high

[#CHORUS]
