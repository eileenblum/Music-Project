Distant faces looking out but they just can't see my wings
All my senses lost their way, the calling fell into me
Reaching out, pulling me in endless circles leading the way

Light can drag you out into nowhere
Time slips around the clock, melting places
Fear no evil 'cause I hear the calling
Though I can't move I'm still far from over

Suddenly I can unlock all doors, my vision's clear
All the power within our minds, only some of us can reveal, I can reveal
I can sense the universe, lonely souls I need to embrace

Light can drag you out into nowhere
Time slips around the clock, melting places
Fear no evil 'cause I hear the calling
Though I can't move I'm still far from over

I can't let go, the calling fell into me
See all grown up have learnt how to be afraid
Counting mistakes regretting their actions carried by fears that become their MO

Let the whole world move while you just stand still
Watch it happening, enjoy the parade
Being grounded is the way to fly...
We all have a choice we can decide by avoiding emotions, our feelings...
(Dance with the light and hold it tight Dance with the light)
Have more and more and more and more... yeah

Light can drag you out into nowhere
Time slips around the clock, melting places
Fear no evil 'cause I hear the calling
Though I can't move I'm still far from over
