Through the good and the bad I rise upon my will
There was a chance I couldn't waste to live again
My spirit is downing
Everyday is day one, the basis of our dreams
Let's explore all the options over and over
I'll take it from here
Don't be afraid 'cause I will win

Whatever will be coming my way, yeah
I will be waiting for you
No matter what's making our day
I will be staying with you
Holding on, fighting for, backing us up
Until we're so high that no one can reach
Feeding fires with holy wood and our tears of joy
Wearing a smile that nothing can dim
The new beginning I'm raving

This beautiful world
Don't force, don't fight... Walk along this way
Collecting more love memories ... paintings and pictures
Celebrating freewill today, tomorrow and yesterday
We never talk down to anyone
We don't let anybody be afraid

Reality reflecting our dreams (Reality reflecting our dreams)
We've been waiting for
The nature of time we perceive (The nature of time we perceive)
Pages and pages of love
No more holding on, or fighting for, no need to separate
The good from the bad, the colors from the grey
Feeding fires with holy wood and our tears of endless joy
So high that no one can reach
We don't let anybody be afraid... afraid of who we are
Feed our souls with desire
Whatever happens... I will be waiting for you
Still wearing a smile that nothing can dim
The new beginning we're living

The nature of time

Life... shapes and colours are painting love
All the way, the courage will heal your path
Still bringing in my honesty, yeah
Saving my kindness for you ... you may draw with my colours...
Embrace your faith, enlighten your path
Reliance is the key to open any door
Commitment... the nature of time
