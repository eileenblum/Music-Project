Love's the scent of beauty no one can't compare
Like a one woman man with no backdoor to escape
A state of mind made of answers with no questions marks around
Magic, science and religion powering honey from the sky

Life,
Shapes and colors are painting love
An endless ride into the sun
Life,
Stars ain't fading, I know for sure
I can recall those paintings now

Wasted away memories just like times in the sand
Every action generates echoes, it's the butterfly effect
Moving pictures multiplying colors gathering shape
Limes and covers shaped like a spiral, displaying the code of love

Life,
Shapes and colors are painting love
An endless ride into the sun
Life,
Stars ain't fading, I know for sure
I can recall those paintings now

After we voiced our concern (other we voiced our concern)
Pillow talk... That's where our hearts belong (where our hearts belong)
You're the only one believer until you find someone else that loves to love

Life
Shapes and colors are painting love
An endless ride into the sun (that's where our hearts belong)
Life,
Stars ain't fading, I know for sure
I can recall those paintings now

Life, shapes and colors are painting love
An endless ride into the sun
Stars ain't fading, I know for sure
I can recall those paintings now... Huh
