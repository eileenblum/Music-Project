Carry on... You can't lose faith, you can't just fail
Stare your fears down, there's always a way to come around

Your back's against the wall (Your back's against the wall)
You can't turns out the lights
Filling up your eyes with hope until you finally clear them out

Heading to nowhere again, yeah
We all need a reason to believe
But this time I'm alright... I'm putting my faith in you

Spirits coming my way (coming my way)
Guiding me through this battle of wills
Breaking through my enemy lines to stop surviving,
To start to breathe

I deceiving myself too long, I didn't trust my fortune
My mistake
Don't give up, keep up your prayers...
Still so much to left unseen, unspoken
Only faith can make you see

Embrace your faith, enlighten your path
Stop wasting names on things you just don't care about
Embrace your faith, enlighten your path
(Face to face, heart to heart I'm finding the reasons to be me)
Feel the grace, feel the fire... Now I can believe

I put the flag on the ground in this inner space collecting tears
That feed the rooms of my soul

Heart to heart, eye to eye
I don't see the down side if you got more faith
We all choose to believe in our fate
Keeping our hopes just one breathe away (just one breathe away)
Just one step away

Heading to nowhere again, yeah
We all need a reason to believe
But this time I'm alright... I'm putting my faith in you

Embrace your faith, enlighten your path
Stop wasting names on things you just don't care about
Embrace your faith, enlighten your path
(Face to face, heart to heart I'm finding the reasons to be me)
Feel the grace, feel the fire... Now I can believe
Embrace your faith, enlighten your path
(I'm finding the reasons to be me)
Feel the grace, feel the fire... Now I can believe
Feel the grace, feel the fire...
Embrace your faith (Embrace your faith) enlighten your path
Embrace your faith (Embrace your faith) Now I can believe
Feel the grace, feel the fire...
Embrace your faith
