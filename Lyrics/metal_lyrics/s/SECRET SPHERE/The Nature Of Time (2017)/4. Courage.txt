Cold wind
Peace and worry may slow you down
Find your core and your fire will gather speed
Forget your comfort zone and destroy your frame

Rise up and then walk on by
Like there's no ground
You just can't feel the pain
Every step filled with wonder

Can you hear a distant call?
You finally got some teeth
Time to paint the corners
To make your life your own
You've got to show your way
All the way

All the way!
The courage will heal your path
No one can be standing in your way
Dark turning into red
Let light flow

Embracing heart
Let your guts go from A to Z
Feed your appetite
Never be afraid
Stay aware of the danger coming

Running free
Dancing naked with an open mind
Dare to win
Live without a backup plan
Duties are waiting for you

Can you hear the calling
Heading back to you?
Use all the colours you can find inside
You've got to show your way
All the way

Show your way!
The courage is here to stay
Still no one can stand in your way
Life can get everywhere
Let it flow

Can you hear a distant call?
You finally got some teeth
Use all the colours you can find inside
You've got to show your way
All the way

All the way!

Show your way!
The courage is here to stay
Still no one can stand in your way
Life can get everywhere
Let it flow

All the way!
The courage will heal your path
No one can be standing in your way
Dark turning into red
Let light flow

Show your way!
The courage is here to stay
Still no one can stand in your way
