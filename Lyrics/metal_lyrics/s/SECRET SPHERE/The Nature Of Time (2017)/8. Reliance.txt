The easy way's to voice concerns
Not facing the odds or dealing with pride
Too many ways to seize the road
Just meet yourself and see your will become one

Seek the trust
Millions of stories got lost in time
Create your spell, never mind what could have been
If you can you must
Reliance the key just to set things right
Dying embers mode of lies will fall shaking from a tree like leaves
Leaving nothing but trust that runs from within

Reliance's like a growing seed
A deal between hearts with no guarantee
Two hands collide into a tightened knock That can't come undone
That will come alive
Let it come alive

Seek the trust
Millions of stories got lost in time
Create your spell, never mind what could have been
If you can you must
Reliance the key just to set things right
Dying embers mode of lies will fail shaking from a face like tears
Leaving nothing but trust that runs from within

They call me insane because I believe
I trust and forgive
But I never forget... no, no

Forget, forgive, believe
Forget, forgive, believe
Forget, forgive, believe
Forget, forgive, believe

Reliance is the key to open any door
A deal between hearts with no guarantee

Seek the trust
Millions of stories got lost in time
Create your spell, never mind what could have been
(never mind what could have been)
If you can you must
Reliance the key just to set things right
Dying embers mode of lies will fall shaking from a tree like leaves
Leaving nothing but trust that runs from within
