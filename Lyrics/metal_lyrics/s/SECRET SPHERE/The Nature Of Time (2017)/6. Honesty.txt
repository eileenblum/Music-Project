The hands of time, we're standing in a frame
I'm still smiling in denied through night and day with nowhere to be
I've gonna find the way to be in to the real with no one to please
I'm just a face together with a name

I'm finding the truth in my eyes, nobody saw what I've seen
(Still bringing in my honesty)
All of the pleasure and pain leading me out from the rain

Dust and rust over the blocks, time to trash the button to nowhere
You better keep your mouth shut, no words flowing
If you know what I mean
It's just a phase that's leading to out will

I'm finding the truth in my eyes, nobody saw what I've seen
(Still living in reality)
All of the pleasure and pain leading me out from the rain
(Ain't living in a fantasy)
Finding the truth in their eyes, no one can tell how it feels
(Still bringing in my honesty)
Growing apart just ain't right, planting their hearts with my seeds

All of the pleasure and pain leading me out from all that's vain
Growing apart just ain't right, planting their hearts with my seeds
Oh, still living in reality
Ain't living in a fantasy
Still bringing in my honesty, my honesty

I was looking for a change to widely open, I found the button to now
So many ways to fill the void, keep going and see where they lead
A real smile that finally relieves, yeah

I'm finding the truth in my eyes, nobody saw what I've seen
(Still living in reality)
All of the pleasure and pain leading me out from the rain
(Ain't living in a fantasy)
Finding the truth in their eyes, no one can tell how it feels
(Still bringing in my honesty)
Growing apart just ain't right, planting their hearts with my seeds
