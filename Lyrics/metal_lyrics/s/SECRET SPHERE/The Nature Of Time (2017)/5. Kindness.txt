A smile can light up your life
a word can tear you apart
feels like I'm walking on broken glass again
but I know my way through
replay the waiting game so we can blame it all on destiny

I stand alone while falling
I listen, I'm learning
saving my kindness for you
you may draw with my colours.

You can stand alone, you can be falling
you listen, you're learning too
you're saving your kindness for me
but I don't need your numbers and words

Light, find me tonight
love, now come out to play
finding balance with my heart and soul
I never knew that I could lose control
but I do
let kindness be you
(words and numbers trying to explain)
I can't pretend that I don't know my way to you
let the conscience reach for the heart

I stand and learn while falling
I listen, I'm learning
saving my kindness for you
you may draw with my colours
you can stand alone, you can be falling
you listen, you're learning too
you're saving your kindness for me
but I don't need your numbers and words

No, no one can tell, can tell how it feels
to be locked away from your past
no more cross talking
all we need to know is that we can't live without kindness

You can stand alone, you can be falling
you listen, you're learning too
you're saving your kindness for me
no more numbers and words.
