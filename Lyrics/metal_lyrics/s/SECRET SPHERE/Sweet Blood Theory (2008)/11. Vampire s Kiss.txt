It's the day of bloody wedding
The vampire whispers on your neck
I can't stop him, the judgment is my chain
...crucifier...
A drop of blood on you babe
Walking in a path of dark
Through my black garden of insanity without a light

He's your beautiful hell
The graveyard of heart
Just look into my eyes
Please believe me

There are drops of blood on you my darling
Through the black garden
Guide me back home the vampire's kiss sows the seed of death
You until the light to embrace the darkness

It's the day of dead lovers
Like a shadow hides in dark
You are the corpse of your love

He's your beautiful suicide
The touch of evil
Bride of a daemon just close your eyes

There are drops of blood on you my darling
Through my black garden
Guide me back home

The vampire's kiss sows the seed of death
You until the light to embrace the darkness

The vampire's kiss sows the seed of death
You until the light to embrace the darkness
The vampire sucks blood right out of your heart
You until the light to embrace the darkness
To embrace the darkness
