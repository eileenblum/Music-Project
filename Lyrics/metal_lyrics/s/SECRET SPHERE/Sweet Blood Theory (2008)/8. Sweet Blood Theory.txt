Dust to dustI lost my senses tonightWhen I hear the screamsStill the rain was falling down me Like a whisper of death I'm over youLike the last breath of life I close your eyesYour beauty fades to grey and your smile has gone Tears won't fall and is crawling in my skinThis fear is growing in my eyesBleeds my heart, I'm surrender in the darkIt's growingTears won't fall and is crawling in my skinThis fear is growing in my eyesBleeds my heart, I'm surrender to the sweetBlood theory I lost my senses tonightWhen I feel his biteI was scared of losing my loveWorld has crumbling downCan you hear my voice? I am dying all alone my love Like a whisper of death I'm over youLike the last breath of life I close your eyesYour beauty fades to grey and your smile has gone Tears won't fall and is crawling in my skinThis fear is growing in my eyesBleeds my heart, I'm surrender in the darkIt's growingTears won't fall and is crawling in my skinThis fear is growing in my eyesBleeds my heart, I'm surrender to the sweetBlood theory Don't runaway, spread around the blameOf a solitary heart hiding and preyingAs your soul today will enter the reignOf dead alive, remember the love that you've lost Like a whisper of death I'm over youLike the last breath of life I close your eyesYour beauty fades to grey and your smile has gone Tears won't fall and is crawling in my skinThis fear is growing in my eyesBleeds my heart, I'm surrender in the darkIt's growingTears won't fall and is crawling in my skinThis fear is growing in my eyesBleeds my heart, I'm surrender to the sweetBlood theory
