There's a time to live
Life is like a dream
And there's a time to die
Victim of those dying eyes

There are some nights I dream of you
Life is like a painted, like a line, a game
...don't know if I trust again

But I want to believe
Here in my darkness day by day
Come on and dream on
Do believe in my eyes, don't be afraid to love again
Here in the darkness we lay
Do believe in my eyes, don't be afraid to love again
I feel you awaken me from my lethargy, I'm afraid

Dream on, dream on, come here and dream on
After all the pain you cried now take my hand
Dream on

I'm burning out for you
And you know that's is true
You are the dark in me
Victim of those dying eyes

There are some nights for dreams
To follow your wicked way
But in this night
I don't know if I trust again

But I want to believe
Here in my darkness day by day
Come on and dream on
Do believe in my eyes, don't be afraid to love again
Here in the darkness we lay
Do believe in my eyes, don't be afraid to love again
I feel you awaken me from my lethargy, I'm afraid

Dream on, dream on, come here and dream on
After all the pain you cried now take my hand
Dream on

In your face I see the light
You're an angels with demon's eyes
Wicked game
Point of no return
A dream to find myself

Dream on, dream on, come here and dream on
After all the pain you cried now take my hand
Dream on, dream on, burn in this night from a dream to a nightmare
