A stranger in blackComes from the middle of nowhereA secret unknownA veil behind the people stareVoices tell to runawayAfter comes the sunsetTrying to speak but all escaping What you're looking for?What's the reason you're hereRunaway or dieA stranger in a townYou should have looked in the eyesYou can guess the truthA shelter in the darkA window light far A house is through the fogThere must be someone in thereBehind the door there's something unexpected waitingThe people of the town is preying for all night longThey fear the forest 'cause they won't survive outside What hides thereOur fear!I am here to help you menLight we'll see, soon againYou just live through darkness Through the trees in the forest, thereI chase the shadow of the courseThrough the trees in the forest, thereI see the sparkling eyes of demons What hides thereOur fear!I am here to help you menLight we'll see, soon againYou just live through darknessDarkness
