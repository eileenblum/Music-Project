Strange to meet you hereIn the middle of nowhereTwo lives so far, so closeTwo eyes so deeply lost You appeared in my life with thousand thoughts and dreamsThrough it's so hard I'll never give up, I'm never givin' inEach time I think of you I'd save youBut I know well We don't need a heroWe don't need a saviourJust believe in a flame that never diesFeed my fire Strange to live nowAlone with thoughts and dreamsOut of my lifeYou are just out of reachFacing the fearsI turn out the light but it is hard to turn a heart outI'm so lost tonight We don't need a heroWe don't need a saviourJust believe in a flame that never diesFeed my fire Closer in timeCloser in lifeDreamin' of you...souls in the night
