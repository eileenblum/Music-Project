In this time we live, here we breathI've been so far from home for love And I'm watching you, breathing you, dreaming youI am so confused of what moves insideDeep inside of me, in a dark heartLike a butterfly dance, brings the sun And we're here tonight, laying together where clouds rest byAnd you're here with meStucked in my old memories, far beyond the pain In this time we live, here we breath, in a dreamWe've been so far until todayWorld is here, take my hand, make me liveI'm so far away from home, just for you More than loveJust like me you're chasing the truthWhere nobody dares you walk through the fearsYou fly over and deep inside mePlaying with a heart that was stillLike a butterfly dance the sun you bring And we're here tonight, laying together where clouds rest byAnd you're here with meStucked in my old memories, far beyond the pain In this time we live, here we breath, in a dreamWe've been so far until todayWorld is here, take my hand, make me liveI'm so far away from home, just for you Like an orchestra you fill my mindAnd we're here tonight, laying together where clouds rest byAnd you're here with meStucked in my old memories, far beyond the pain In this time we live, here we breath, in a dreamWe've been so far until todayWorld is here, take my hand, make me liveI'm so far away from home, just for you
