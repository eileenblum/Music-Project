Like a picture of a perfect world and lifeI write your name in sandI see your face through the windAll my memories are blowing away Now the game is over, the curtain fallsYou're walking through this line of fireFeel the words, my fingers slowly draw your face All these words for you to say goodbyeI will never forget your smileAll this pain is just a prisonAnd we can never escape Smile without a reason whyYou've broken my mirrors to heal your woundsFor a taste of eternity, for no reason whyYou deny my fate Now the game is over, the curtain fallsYou're walking through this line of fireFeel the words, my fingers slowly draw your face All these words for you to say goodbyeI will never forget your smileAll this pain is just a prisonAnd we can never escape Smile without a reason whyJust take my hand and trust me again All these words for you to say goodbyeI will never forget your smileAll this pain is just a prisonAnd we can never escape
