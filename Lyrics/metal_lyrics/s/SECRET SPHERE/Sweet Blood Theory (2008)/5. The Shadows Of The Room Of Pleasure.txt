All is like a show, there's a flame inside of me
And there's no rain can put it out
Where is the reason?
All is like a game, there's a flame inside of me
And there's no fear that can put it down
Where are the rules and the reason?
For what I see
Dancing in dark, I don't understand
A touch of shadow's running on my skin
So tell me where is the reason

You rule my soul
Talking through the eyes of vice
You rule my soul
Crawling through the night
Oh lord

Gambling with the demons drinking wine
Women like witches in the back
Candlelight embraces the shadows of the rooms of pleasure

Here is where the vice begins
Where the reason scared runaway
Where you can play with all your games
Illusions that shine in your eyes

Caress me in this room of pleasure

Here is where the vice begins
Where the reason scared runaway
Where you can play with all your games
Illusions that shine in your eyes
