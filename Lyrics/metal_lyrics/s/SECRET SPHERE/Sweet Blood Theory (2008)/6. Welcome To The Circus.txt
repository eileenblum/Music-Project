Through the falling rain I see your eyes
You see me passing by
I realize I've wasted too much time, too much time

You suffered too much, I can understand
Even though it's so hard to see and not to touch

Only to dream is so great when you're here with me
I know there is a chance for us, I know there is, yeah

Welcome to the circus where it's time to play your game
And makes illusions, always, that shine in your eyes

Time has passing by, I wonder when
A minute will see us kissing
Hope you're thinking of me just as I do
We've been so weakened

You suffered too much, I can understand
Even though it's so hard to see and not to touch

Only to dream is so great when you're here with me
I know there is a chance for us, I know there is, yeah

Welcome to the circus where it's time to play your game
And makes illusions, always, that shine in your eyes
