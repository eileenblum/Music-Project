[music composed and arranged by Buratto, Messina, Lonobile, Cartasegna, Gianotti, Agate; words by Messina]

One step into the night and the other through the light,
We don't care of what we are and we always wanna hide,
Days are goin'on, then another one will come,
But don't think 'cause other problems will fill up your brain

Strange armonies in the air,
We can' t anymore them hear,
Strange game of rhymes, we can't see,
Now takes control of my hand

Far away I forsee a figure who seems to be
Someone who's waiting for a sign of mine,
Suddenly, can you feel his voice that calls your name?
There's no sound but lips are movin'on

I stand into the fog, as the average of yours,
But I try to make him speak, I know he's like me,
As written on pieces of my mind,
Falling into a deep abyss,
I begin to see the words my heart wants to say

They tell of blame, some of them,
Some others about fear,
Strange game of lies, I deny,
But they're the ones I deeply live

Music everywhere,
Words forever lasting,
You and me sing together
The love and the hate of life

Far away, I feel you're far away
