[music composed and arranged by Buratto, Messina, Lonobile, Cartasegna, Gianotti, Agate; words by Messina, Buratto, Lonobile]

This song is for all you,
Talkin'trash to what you never gonna do,
You all backstabbers which for
Interest would step over anyone,
Misleading people you betrayed me
All this shit must return back...

Now I know,
I can't trust you,
Try to look at me in the eyes,
Don't understand,
We're not like you,
try to look into the mirror

You say you don't give a damn,
Think you are smart, your success is false,
Your dreams will come crashing very soon,
soon, you'll see

Now you know,
You can't trust me,
Don't look right into my eyes,
You don't understand,
We're not like you,
Now we'll give you what you deserve

Your poison, your treason,
Are you satisfied?
Despite all these we are
Still here to give you all,
Your poison, your true lies,
Are you satisfied?
Despite all these we are
Still here to give you all

sometimes I'd destroy everything sometimes I'd cry
sometimes I'd smash your head in sometimes I don't mind
