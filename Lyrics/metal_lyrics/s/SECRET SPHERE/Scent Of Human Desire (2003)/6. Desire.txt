[music composed and arranged by Buratto, Messina, Lonobile, Cartasegna, Gianotti, Agate; words by Messina, Buratto, Lonobile]

More than sweet words, a stream of emotions,
Then around everything disappear,
Hands are cold, tough the breath,
In a moment you possess my desire

Somewhere I'll meet your eyes again,
Under the rays of the moon
you'll be mine, babe

desire, my dreams caress you,
but I can't wait for laying
together, living what seems to take a shape

more than meet the eyes,
I look at my empty arms,
I pretend you're close to my heart,
Suddenly I realize maybe you're feeling the same
Yeah, such a disarmed stare never lies

Somewhere I'll meet your eyes again,
Under the rays of the moon
You will be mine, babe

In the night I need you here,
In the heart of this night, it grows from my heart
...deep from my heart, it's screaming

desire, my lips are on you but I can't stand I'm just
forever, chasing what seems to fade away
