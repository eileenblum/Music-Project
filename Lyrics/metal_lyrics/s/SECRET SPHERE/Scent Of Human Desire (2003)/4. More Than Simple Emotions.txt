[music composed and arranged by Buratto, Messina, Lonobile, Cartasegna, Gianotti, Agate; words by Buratto]

When your eyes shine in mine
One instant arrests the time,
Let this words caress your body,
A sweet embrace they'll be

Each look and every kiss,
In every touch so many sensations,
Too many to be said
By simple and human words

To say I'm feeling good, for sure is not enough,
They're more than simple emotions

I got that memory, all fade away,
Then only you remain,
Like a star in the dark
Shines your spell

Now babe take my hand
And dance with me for all night long,
Close your eyes, come with me
In a place that we can't know...

Get lost on my lips
and let me bring you far away,
Get lost in my eyes,
let me bring you away...

tomorrow, wherever we'll be,
this melody will make us feel nearer...

to say I'm feeling good, for sure is not enough,
they're more than simple emotions,
to say it has been wonderful,
for sure is not enough,
they're more than simple emotions
