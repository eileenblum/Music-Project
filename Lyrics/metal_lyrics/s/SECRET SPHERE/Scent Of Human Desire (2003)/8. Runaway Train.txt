[music composed and arranged by Buratto, Messina, Lonobile, Cartasegna, Gianotti, Agate; words by Messina, Buratto, Lonobile]

Blind people, money, law,
Bastards slaves don't even know why...
Power and despair, mind money-polation

Desires guide our actions, do what is right,
So please don't give up, you got the right,
You are on stage to remind you
You got your life,
Live the dark into the night and the light into your eyes

In each moment, with every breathe,
never let the chance go,
that could be the last one
but don't lose the hope,
it's not too late to catch your train for life

Injustice, materiality,
Are not enough for my blood pollution,
You always hear them say:
"Elevate yourself"...fuck...

I see my way tonight,
Chasing the notes of an old melody,
I taste the shades of my sight,
I hear the call,
I'm still on the run
