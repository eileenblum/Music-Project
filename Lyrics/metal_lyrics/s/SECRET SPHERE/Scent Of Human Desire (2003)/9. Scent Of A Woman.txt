[music composed and arranged by Buratto, Messina, Lonobile, Cartasegna, Gianotti, Agate; words by Messina, Buratto, Lonobile]

In my lonely nights,
My mind's mesmerized,
By this wake of scent
That I can't do, anything but to follow,
I can't resist...

Step by step I'm sure
To feel your breath is coming near
I know you're not only a vision,
But I'm lonely and the blame is on you...

scent of woman on me

Faces everywhere,
I detect the scent again
I look around, where are you?
My dream, surround me,
I'm lonely, I feel I need you...

Facing the fear of never finding you,
I try to convince myself you are not real,
But I can't do anything
but to follow the wake
...I want you
