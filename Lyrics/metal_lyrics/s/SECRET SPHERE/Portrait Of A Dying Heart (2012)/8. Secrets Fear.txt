Slave to my own nature
I forgot the right to live a life
You're falling form the stairs in Heaven
Unable to see what the dream has become

You can always live a dream, trying to avoid reality
While heading for a point of no return
My light is growing dim and I'm gonna die soon

Gain control, you can feel it now, the future's in your hands
We're all so blind, holding on...

Those broken promises of a come back of our consciousness
Gotta find one more reason, yeah to believe
You can grab me, take me, make me feel like a god

You love may heal my Secret Sphere
You can always grab my feelings wrapped here
My Sphere is black, there's no turning back
The abuse of lucid dreams is killing me

I became a master
We control each other' Sphere and love
Forgetting all about the real life
No one's to blame, it's not too late to...

Gain control, gotta do it now before it's just too late
We're all so blind, holding on...

Those broken promises of a come back of our consciousness
Gotta find one more reason, yeah to believe
I'm gonna grab you, take you...
...make you feel like you've never felt before

Your love may heal my secrets fear
You can always grab my feelings wrapped here
My Sphere is black, there's no turning back
The abuse of lucid dreams is killing me

I can take you to the shore
My light ain't shining like before
Your eyes are telling me to stay
While things I've done they went astray
