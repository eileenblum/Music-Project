Lie to me... can't find a reason why... I'm lost and blind now

I wish I could turn back time and start again
Nothing really matters when you're going insane
Tell me... how am I supposed to live this way?
I can feel my spirit dying ripped out by your lips...

Lie to me.. I'm my own sacrifice, so lost and blind now
Why do you lie to me? can't find a reason why
Inside there lies my faith

The pain we hide in vain is locked inside our dreams
The more you try to reach out and get the best of me
The worst my dreams become

Lie to me... I'm my own sacrifice, so lost and blind now
Why do you lie to me? Can't find a reason why
Inside there... lies... my faith

No matter who we are and where we come from
I'll heal the broken heart of yours...
A helpless mind and a restless heart will only make us cry...
Here we cry again...

We're crying tears of pain
We can never let it be
I can feel the cold wind blowing...
Behind the truth there lies another lie

Lie to me... I'm my own sacrifice, so lost and blind now
Why do you lie to me? Can't find a reason why
Inside there lies my faith

Lie to me... I'm my own sacrifice, so lost and blind now
Why do you lie to me? Can't find a reason why
Inside there... lies... my faith
