Lost, now she's getting her way through the crowd
Shadows that follow a play she won't buy

X. relies upon her dreams, far from reality
She complies with music and no one stands a chance
Gaze inside a lucid dream
She's trying to escape from grey and find a way to love...
...melt her heart from stone to tears

She'll turn it to liquid steel... along with the joy...
I stared at my demons flying like neon signs above

She's holding the night back like crazy and seize her fantasy
Can't find a rhyme in the dream of love that will never make it
I do believe I'm not the only one trying to find the cure

I wanna feel safe, let my mind ensure and deliver me some colors
The backround's dark but there's Orion
The hands of time are misleading

All of a sudden a new spirit appears
Surrender to him... a revenge with no harm

He held her for a moment, too strong to bear
Their souls collide, will they ever meet again?

She's holding the night back like crazy and seize her fantasy
Can't find a rhyme in the dream of love that will never make it
I do believe I'm not the only one trying to find him

All the rage she felt when he was gone...
A tear falling down on the floor
All the new vibes coming out of his touch
Her soul was taken, by the sound of his bass
he's the only reason to dream... (The only reason to dream...)
Yeah, the only reason to live

Suddenly a string broke, she found herself back to her life
He was the first one pulling those strings that lie so deep
She fell for him... that was the first shoe dropping...
