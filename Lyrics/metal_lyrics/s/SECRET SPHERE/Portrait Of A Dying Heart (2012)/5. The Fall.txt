Y. had returned with a paintbrush in his hand
To take off the darkness from a paint with hills and clouds
Now surrounded by love and faith, the shelter where they fell... down

A female silhouette, her eyes turn to the sunset
She's the only act dressed in red like living blood
Dressed to kill in Heaven

Someone' still waiting for her embrace
Until the end of time and after
Some are fools, some will go all the way
Until the end of time, forevermore... uh!

Chained memories lying on the floor
Like dying leaves, brought by the wind like cards falling from a deck
She tasted the poison coming from his past
Now surrounded by fear and doubt, the diary's digging her deep, yeah

A female silhouette, her eyes turn to the sunset
She's the only act dressed in red like living blood
Dressed to kill in Heaven

Someone' still waiting for her embrace
Until the end of time and after
Some are fools, some will go all the way
Until the end of time, forever
Someone's till waiting for her embrace
Until the end of time and after
Some are fools, some will go all the way
'Til the end of time, forever...

Too many days have gone with no echo
Now she's falling in a cage
Untrying the string that keeps his dairy safe...
he must have shed hid blood and ink in vain, in vain...
The coma... the fall

Someone's till waiting for her embrace
Until the end of time and after
Some are fools, some will go all the way
'Til the end of time, forever
Someone's till waiting for her embrace
She tasted the poison coming from his past
Some are fools, some will go all the way
Dressed to kill in Heaven
