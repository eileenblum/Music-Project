The sky, the mist... trying to climb the stairs of love
Without a sound the waves are coming to see the show

Emptiness may lead her to loneliness
Hope is still there
Angry eyes slow down their becoming
Feels like Heaven in Hell

You could only see the color of her eyes in the dark...

Trial by fire
(Floating with desire, not afraid to cross that line)
Red blood drawn on her lips
Two souls were fling in a dream, a union sealed by a kiss
Trial by fire
(Floating with desire, not afraid to cross that line)
He's the spell she's under
Visions, obsessions shelter love tonight

After all the pain she felt the fire burn within
Then suddenly her love just disappeared

You could only see the color of her eyes in the dark...

Trial by fire
(Floating with desire, not afraid to cross that line)
Red blood drawn on her lips
Two souls were fling in a dream, a union sealed by a kiss
Trial by fire
(Floating with desire, not afraid to cross that line)
He's the spell she's under
Visions, obsessions shelter love tonight

She'd never felt this way before... (Never felt this way...)
The passion running through her veins... (Tonight...)
Well he's meant to be the one
The empathy can tell..

Two souls flying high in a dream...
A union... a union... he's just the spell she's under

Trial by fire
(Floating with desire, not afraid to cross that line)
Red blood drawn on her lips
Two souls were fling in a dream, a union sealed by a kiss
Trial by fire
(Floating with desire, not afraid to cross that line)
He's the spell she's under
Visions, obsessions shelter love... shelter love tonight, yeah
Shelter love tonight, yeah...
Shelter me tonight...
