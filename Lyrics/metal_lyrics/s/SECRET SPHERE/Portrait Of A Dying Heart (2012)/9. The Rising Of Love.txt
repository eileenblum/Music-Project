Moving forward right to dusk
The answer lies in the back of your mind
Keep dreaming of a whole new universe... (A new universe)
Where our mistakes are gone with a kiss
Alone in the dream again

Those broken promises of a come back...
Won't you can grab me, make me feel like a God?

Your love may heal my Secret Sphere
You can always grab my feelings wrapped here
My sphere is black, there's no turning back
The abuse of lucid dreams is killing me

Your love may heal my secrets fear
You can always grab my feelings
My sphere is black, there's no turning back
The abuse of lucid dreams is killing me

A little bit of jealousy running deep inside
He never cried for mercy, he's only needs to love
Afraid to love again...
Why did you come back to me?

Time and forgiveness will never save a dying heart
Fuelled by the emotions, turned to a man with no hope
Don't you know that even the sun was taken, her timeless beauty
But their passion has gone
(Straight from the rising of love)
The night I finally had her was the night I died
Straight from the rising of love...

Salvation's my sentence but you stayed because of me
The one and only reason, to feed each other's heart...

Skills were frozen, life's in holding
Stop reliving your lucid dream.. (Your lucid dream...)
Afraid to love again, willing to feel the pain
She disappeared with the Sphere in her chest...

Time and forgiveness will never save a dying heart
Fuelled by the emotions, turned to a man with no hope
Don't you know that even the sun was taken, her timeless beauty
But their passion has gone
(Straight from the rising of love)
The night I finally had her was the night I died
Straight from the rising of love...
Straight from the rising of love...

Skills were frozen, life's in holding
Stop reliving your lucid dreams... (Your lucid dreams...)
Afraid to love again, willing to feel the pain
She disappeared with the sphere in her chest...

Time and forgiveness will never save a dying heart
Fuelled by the emotions, turned to a man with no hope
Don't you know that even the sun was taken, her timeless beauty
But their passion has gone
(Straight from the rising of love)
The night I finally had her was the night I died
Straight from the rising of love...
Straight from the rising of love...

...from the rising of... from the rising of... love
