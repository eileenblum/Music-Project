Eternity, a moment in time
Eternity... You're all that I can see
The wind of memories... the last ride we run
Devotion is the key to drain the pain

Climb through hills and clouds
Where everybody stands dreaming of another day
The fight is over here we are
Saving our love, one voice two hearts
We're gonna let them shine 'til the end of time
Feeling like the dying sun but we're not alone

Like a ritual... eternity, no regrets because of Y.
We need a place to call our home
Yeah, you know one day we're gonna fly
The last line of the song yeah was whispered in her ears
What's fake? They'll never really see it
Whatever goes through their minds is the answer to their prayers
Eternity... what our promises demand is a trade of hearts
So much to find, so little time

Some welcome to a new eternal dream, the only reason to live
No need to run and chase anymore

Climb through hills and clouds
Where everybody stands dreaming of another day
The chase is over here we are
Saving our love, one voice two hearts
We're gonna let them shine 'til the end of time
Feeling like the dying sun but we're not alone

Love's the only cure, I knew it from the start
all it takes' just a little bit of sweet
Being afraid to love your first mistake
Don't ever blame your kids for all that you are

The wind of memories... the last ride we run
Devotion is the key to drain the pain
So welcome to our new eternal dream, the only reason to live

Climb through hills and clouds
Where everybody stands dreaming of another day, yeah
The fight is over here we are
Saving our last pieces left of our hearts
We're gonna let them shine 'til the end of time
Feeling like dying sun but we're not alone

Climb through hills and clouds
Where everybody stands dreaming of another day, yeah
Yeah, the chase is over here we are
Saving our love, one voice two hearts
We're gonna let them shine 'til the end of time

...we're not alone
