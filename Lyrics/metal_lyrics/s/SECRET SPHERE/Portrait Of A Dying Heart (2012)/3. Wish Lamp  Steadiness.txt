Isolated, one last time
A seed of star becoming flame
Just to make her realize how dark she was then

He's made of wish &amp; steadiness
A candle burning in his hand
To light a wide path with no fear and guide her through the unknown...

Hold it tight
A touch that will lead her fingers to the heart
One step away... (One step away...)
Willing to face him without any judgement...

Same thirst and same need to find
The sign of the meaning
In every mistakes along their way
I hope I won't die without feeling it
Same thirst and same need to find
The key of desire without any pain, that lie inside
The answer is calling to me, a call from within

Unable to live by the rules but still willing to burn
Deny what you feel, you're dying inside

Awakened from the sweetest dream
She'll be back to him tonight
They'll be going all the way... one way ticket to Heaven

Run and run and don't be scared
Lost into the void they got
Hope is coming back alive, leading right to nowhere

Hold it tight
A touch that will lead her fingers to the heart
One step away... (One step away...)
Willing to face him without any judgement...

Same thirst and same need to find
The sign of the meaning
In every mistakes along their way
I hope I won't die without feeling it
Same thirst and same need to find
The key of desire without any pain, that lie inside
The answer is calling to me...

Unlock all the codes of the heart
Only Y. can reach it and I don't know what it's me
Like victims of love, biting the last piece of faith
From the ivory tower to the Sea of Devotion
From inside four walls
Climbing their way to the Moon...

Hold it tight
A touch that will lead her fingers to the Heart
One step away...
Willing to face him without any judgement...

Same thirst and same need to find
The sign of the meaning
In every mistakes along their way
I hope I won't die without feeling it
Same thirst and same need to find
The key of desire without any pain, that lie inside
The answer is calling to me...

Unlock all the codes of the heart
