My eyes can see 
so close, the invisible walls
which force you
in conformed paths
guiding your mind
under a bright sky
of painted glass

[PRE CHORUS:]
Without a hole
to the warm rays of sun
Ohh!
Find the way, to escape from the dark
no fear, of the pen sight
For mankind now
I swear, captivity
no more shall last

[PRE CHORUS II:]
Will never fall my hope
no time I'll waste
Noway, has to fall my hope
no time I'll waste

[CHORUS: ]
My neverending need to run out
shows the way to break the glass 
and find yourself lonely 
in a fake mankind

[#PRE CHORUS]

[#CHORUS]

[#CHORUS]

......... 

to run out...

to break out...

fake mankind...
