So far away from the eyes of reality
rise the doorways of fantasy 
Ride, man, in the valley of eternity
Where the lands are free from falsity

[PRE CHORUS]
Now the time has come to hear the bards
for a new horizon beyond sea of dreams
You'll see the dragons fly 
and the dance of elves 
in the lands of fairy lakes and falls

[PRE CHORUS]

[CHORUS:]
Runnin' dreams on the circle of the time,
under the sky of eternal life,
Among the mountains, dressed of light,
over the scythe of pain
Let your mind fly away in freedom
where mankind's thought will never die

Time, Lord of Life, 
in this place my soul is mine
Death, Bride of Time,
the ideas will never fade

[PRE CHORUS]

[CHORUS]
...where mankind's thoughts, lives again

[CHORUS]
...where mankind's thought will never die
