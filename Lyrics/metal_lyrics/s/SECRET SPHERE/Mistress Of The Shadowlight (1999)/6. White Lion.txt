Behind the corner of every town, 
deep in our minds there is dreams oppression,
nature of man is both free and repressed,
putting down a devasting force
that lives inside your warrior's eyes with pride,
a rising sun, high from the temple of mind

[POST:]
Stained world flies,
far with fears of false ideals,
(lost and blind)
you'll chase silver tears fallin' in time,
(don't waste time)
leave this empty crowd of lies

[PRE CHORUS:]
Brake out the glass cage that injures your heart,
set free the fire in your hands,
let burn the flame that enlights the world

[CHORUS:]
White Lion,
spread out my rage,
open the sky with your
bright power,
before my eyes
break the strong evil chains

Every time I wonder what I pray,
for not that I point my eyes
on something higher beyond,
of my reign I'm Lord
