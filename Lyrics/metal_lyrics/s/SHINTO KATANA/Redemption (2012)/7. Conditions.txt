I watch your introduction
I see you slowly start to choke
We both know how this one ends

Don't try to fight it
Just lay your head to rest
Breathe your last breath
Look up at me
I am your fucking death

I'll never be the one you said you saw in me
I only walk this earth to bring you misery
What makes you fucking believe
You're worth a damn to me
I left you for dead
I watched you fucking bleed
I'll never be the one you said you saw in me
I only walk this earth to bring you misery
What makes you fucking believe
You're worth a damn to me
I left you for dead
I watched you bleed
I watch your introduction
I see you slowly start to choke
We both know how this one ends
Don't try to fight it
Just lay your head to rest
Breathe your last breath
Look up at me
I am your fucking death
I'll never be the one you said you saw in me
I only walk this earth to bring you misery
What makes you fucking believe
You're worth a damn to me
I left you for dead
I watched you fucking bleed
I'll never be the one you said you saw in me
I only walk this earth to bring you misery
What makes you fucking believe
You're worth a damn to me
I left you for dead
I watched you bleed

I watched you bleed

I left you for dead
I watched you bleed

You have become the sick and weak
Dying at my feet
Don't try to save me
Just fucking bleed
Fuck everything you believe
You have become the sick and weak
Dying at my feet
Don't try to save me
Just fucking bleed
Fuck everything that you believe

Fuck everything that you believe
