Just shut your eyes and pretend this isn't real
I know love to think
No harm will come from this
But I have come to tell you
There will be consequences
There won't be second chances
Those who play with fire
Get fucking burned

Have you opened your eyes up lately?
The sky is black and it never stops fucking raining
Take a step outside
Welcome to the real world
This is the home of the heartless
There are no angels in the sky
Someday everybody dies
And no-one cares if it makes you cry

There is no comfort
There is no shelter
Nobody here gives a fuck
If you knew anything
You wouldn't sleep
Bitch, wake up, fairytales are fucking lies
Open your eyes

In a paradise you built with your mind
They told you angels could fly
They told you nobody dies
But if you're brave enough to open your eyes
You'll watch them fall from the sky
Your fucking life is a lie

Your fucking life is a lie

Your fucking life is a lie

Your fucking life is a lie
