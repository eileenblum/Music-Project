[feat. Frankie Palmeri](I'm waiting
I'm waiting
I'm waiting
I'm waiting)

I'm waiting
For one good reason
Not to blow this whole place to fucking pieces
But all you've given me is reasons
To set the timer
You've only got one moment
So tell me
How does it feel
To have fallen
From your blanket?
Exposed as fiction for the world to see
You have spoken your words of wisdom
But nobody showed up to listen

Why waste your breath?
You know I won't forget that shit you said
Protect your fucking neck
For I am seeking revenge
You will die by my hands
No questions asked
You dug your grave

And now it's time to repent
Give me one reason not to leave you burning
I fucking mean it
Give me one more fucking reason to set the fire
I'm trying to believe in you
But you're a fucking liar

You have broken every promise
Who the fuck will save you now?
Fuck this island
I'm setting sail for home
And now you're on your fucking own

With no-one left to listen
You have been fucking silenced

You have been fucking silenced

With no-one left to listen
You have been fucking silenced
