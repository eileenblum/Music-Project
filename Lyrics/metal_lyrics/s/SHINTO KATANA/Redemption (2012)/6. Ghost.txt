10 years on your voice is fading
You never meant a word
Of all the thing you used to say
I picked you up when you had fallen
But now you've got your feet
How can you just walk away?

If silence is golden
You're worth a million
Cash it in!
Just know I'll sleep at night
I'll dream without you
There won't be warm welcomes
If you wash up on the shore
The tides are changing but we're still standing
What the fuck you hiding from?
I'm still here
I'm still down
Say what you want or get the fuck out

Enjoy your holiday from air you used to breathe
When heaven falls apart
Where will you be?

10 years on your voice is fading
Did it ever mean a thing?
"No-one gets left behind"
We used to sing
Now I see that you meant nothing from the start
I can't believe that I believed you had it in your heart

If silence is golden
You're worth a million
Cash it in!
You know I'll sleep at night
I'll dream without you
There won't be warm welcomes
If you wash up on the shore
The tides are changing
But we're still standing
Hang your head
You made your fucking bed

You'll never see my face again
