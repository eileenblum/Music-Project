[feat. Jon Blake]This is a war we cannot win
Nobody's coming home
Left out to die alone
Catch the reflection of the sea
Staring at mirrors to see
The common enemy
Infect the air so we can
Breathe in the suffering
Destroy the bones we bring
This is a war we cannot win

Are we just visiting our own graves?
With not a single word
With nothing left to say
Our hearts will never be the same
We gave our love away
We keep on breathing but the air is full of early graves
Are we just visiting our own graves?
With not a single word
With nothing left to say
Our hearts will never be the same
We gave our love away
We keep on breathing but the air is full of early graves
This is a war we cannot win
Nobody's coming home
Left out to die alone
Catch the reflection of the sea
Staring at mirrors to see
The common enemy
Infect the air so we can
Breathe in the suffering
Destroy the bones we bring
This is a war we cannot win
This is a war we cannot win

Making sounds from the underground
To prove we exist
But we're just digging ourselves deeper

Deeper

(Are we just visiting our own graves?
With not a single word
With nothing left to say)
Our hearts will never be the same
We gave our love away
We keep on breathing but the air is full of early graves
Are we just visiting our own graves?
With not a single word
With nothing left to say
Our hearts will never be the same
We gave our love away
We keep on breathing but the air is full of early graves
