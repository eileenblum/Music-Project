You thought you'd pass the test of time
But now you're gone
And I'm still holding everything I said would still be mine
Look in from the outside
It hurts to see me smile

You've been pushed to the side
(Pushed to the side)
You have been left behind
You have been left behind

Run your fucking mouth
Waste your fucking time
Waste your time
No-one gives a fuck
Fuck your fucking life
Fuck your life
Run your fucking mouth
Waste your fucking time
Waste your time
No-one gives a fuck
Fuck your fucking life
Fuck your life

I bit my tongue
When you gave me that fucking look
It wasn't easy
I'm here to end your fucking reign
I've fucking seen it all
You weren't the first to fall
Nobody saves you today
They're too afraid
I run this fucking game

Run your fucking mouth
Waste your fucking time
Waste your time
No-one gives a fuck
Fuck your fucking life
Fuck your life
Drop my fucking name
I don't give a fuck
Give a fuck
You are fucking done
End your fucking life
Fuck your life

There are no heroes here
I swung my axe into their fucking skulls
I am a villain
I do not give one single fucking fuck
