We are the monsters
We're the freaks
That occupy the streets
Whilst all the weak (the weak)
Lock up their doors and sleep
We're nowhere to be seen
We are the monsters
We're the ghosts that no-one fucking knows
When daylight gives in
The sun is down and we will reign like kings

In the face of fear we stand together
Fighting for our lives
No peace until the sun has risen for the final time
We are the fearless
Won't stop until we die
We are the fearless
If you want us dead
You better fucking fight

We run like thieves into the night
Keeping out of sight
Just waiting for the sun to rise
We dance like demons through the night
When the time is right
We will stand side by side
We will stand and fucking fight

In the face of fear we stand together
Fighting for our lives
No peace until the sun has risen for the final time
We are the fearless
Won't stop until we die
We are the fearless
If you want us dead
You better fucking fight
I will stand and fight
Fight
I will stand to fight

(We run like thieves into the night
We dance like demons through the night)
Stand up and fight

We run like thieves into the night
Keeping out of sight
Just waiting for the sun to rise
We dance like demons through the night
When the time is right
We will stand side by side
We will stand and fucking fight
I will stand and fight
I'll fucking fight
I'll stand by your side
I'll fucking fight
