Everyday I see your faces
Staring back at me
How the fuck am I supposed to feel?
I buried you at sea
Iâm diving to the depths to find you
Cause you once believed
I tried to keep you warm with fire
But I burned
Everything
But I burned
Everything
But I burned 
Everything
But I burned
Every fucking thing

Burning homes and poisoned seas
This is what Iâve left for those who once believed
At night I can still hear their screams
My conscience never lets me sleep

I promised you we would be free
And then I burned down everything
I am disease

Our hearts were empty, our streets were fucking cold
I opened hell to melt the ice
And dropped you in the burning hole
In the burning hole
In the burning hole
In the burning hole

With only one thing left to do
Lock me in this room
Let me breathe the poison fumes (the poison fumes)
Destroy the key
Run for safety
Turn on the gas
Iâve got the match
Run and donât look back
This will be 
My final act
This will be
My last chance
For redemption
So pay attention

Turn on the gas
Iâve got the match
Ring the bells
Iâm never coming back
Iâm never coming back
This is redemption
No more infection

This is redemption
No more infection
