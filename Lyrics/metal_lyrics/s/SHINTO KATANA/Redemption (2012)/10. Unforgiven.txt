Bear witness as I enter
You feel the chill across the room
You should've stood back
You never knew I'd be the maker of these holes
These stepping stones
To all your falls
I'll be the one to drop you

Don't look at me like I'm the fool
Have I taught you nothing?
This path you've chosen brings you straight to your knees
Before me
The ground beneath you splits, revealing my intention
Was this what you had in mind when you begged for attention?
Be fucking real
You must have known I'd not forget
All those things you fucking said
This is revenge, so watch your fucking head
I've spent my days trying to find the perfect way to end your life
But now I've got one
So watch your fucking head tonight
Don't look at me like I'm the fool
Have I taught you nothing?
This path you've chosen brings you straight to your knees
Before me
The ground beneath you splits, revealing my intention
Was this what you had in mind when you begged for attention?
Bear witness as I enter
You feel the chill across the room
You should've stood back
You never knew
I am the sky above you
You cannot run
I see it all
I am the ground beneath you
I open up to watch you fall

I watch you fall
You won't be speaking anymore
Your calls for help have been ignored
I watched you fall
