Are you afraid?
I'm knock, knock knockin' on heaven's door
With a message from hell
"When it rains it fucking pours"
So lock the gates
Here comes the storm

I once believed in something
Then I woke up to a bitter morning light
I closed my eyes and waited for the night

I spend my days in the darkest of corners
Drinking the poison to feel
I don't know what's real
I have become what I cannot see
I have nothing to believe
I am free of the misery

I'm coming out to fucking play
This is the only way
I know how to kill every fucking memory
Don't stand in my way
I'm on a raging path
If I don't love myself
I'll fucking hurt somebody else

Are you afraid?
Are you afraid?
Are you afraid of being free?

I spend my days in the darkest of corners
Drinking the poison to feel
I don't know what's real
I have become what I cannot see
I have nothing to believe
I am free of the misery

I spend my days in the darkest of corners
Drinking the poison to feel
I don't know what's real

Are you afraid?
(Are you afraid?)
Are you afraid? 
(Of the rain)
Are you afraid of the rain?

I've lost control
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid of the rain

It's all I know
Leave me alone
Don't fucking rescue me until tomorrow

I'm knock, knock knockin' on heaven's door
With a message from hell
"When it rains it fucking pours"
So lock the gates
Here comes the storm
