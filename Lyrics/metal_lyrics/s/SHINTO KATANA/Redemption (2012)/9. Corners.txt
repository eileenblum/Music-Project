I have given up on trying to feel like I belong
This place has held me in it's hands for far too fucking long
I could never build the strength to let go
Now I'm lost in search for a place I once called home
I stand facing corners so I can't see
'Cause if I close my eyes, my dreams will lie to me

Sometimes it feels like houses won't become homes
When we walk the same roads
Without direction
We cross the river just to see the beyond the dreams
We gave up just to feel free from our reflections

I stand facing corners so I can't see
If I close my eyes, my dreams will lie to me
I stand facing corners
I stand facing corners
I stand facing corners so I can't dream

We will all die with our regret
So we live our lives just trying to forget
To forget

Sometimes it feels like houses won't become homes
When we walk the same roads
Without direction
We cross the river just to see the beyond the dreams
We gave up just to feel free from our reflections
Sometimes it feels like houses won't become homes
When we walk the same roads
Without direction
We cross the river just to see the beyond the dreams
We gave up just to feel free from our reflections
