Sweat pours like rain from your cheeks
You've never felt pressure like this
Doesn't matter how fast I dance tonight
I won't escape the grip of your eyes
I'm sure you thought I didn't have the heart
I don't have a heart at all

I don't have a heart at all
You left me hollow
You left me empty
I don't have a heart at all
You left me hollow
You left me fucking empty

I can feel your pulse through your eyes
I can feel your pulse through your eyes
Can you still
See my face?
Can you still
Feel your heart beat?

Wake up
Can you hear me?
Can you taste the kerosene?
I'll light this match as a reminder
Can you hear me?
Can you taste the kerosene?
I'll watch you burn as a reminder

Next time we meet, you'll be leaving with less than your life
Next time we meet, you'll be leaving
With less than your life
With less than your life
