Face down
Cold floor
Have you ever felt so at home?
Or did you expect to find something more?
On wasted wings, you'll fall
Desire betrayed you
But you're no angel
But you're no fucking angel

Fake smile
You play the role so well
But are you really at peace
Or just happy to be off your knees?
Fake smile
You won't remember the ones you've left behind
But you'll fall from the top of the world
Of the world
You'll fall
From the top of the world
You'll fall
From the top of the world
You'll fall (you'll fall)
From the top of the world
You'll fall (you'll fall)
From the top of the world
