Sleepless nights
Weren't meant to be like this
One moment out of focus
For a lifetime of regret
I hope you saw the sunset
You won't see it rise
You say you don't care if it kills you
Open your eyes
You wouldn't know what it's like to be alive
You're too dead inside
I gave you everything
And you spit it in my face
You never wanted to be saved
Don't say you'll be there for me
You're fucking dead to me
When you never wanted to be saved

I hope you saw the sunset
You'll never see it rise

I watched your last hope 
Fade away
I watched your last hope
Sail away

You lost everything
