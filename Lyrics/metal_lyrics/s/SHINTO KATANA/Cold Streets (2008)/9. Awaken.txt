[feat. Hercules Moon]Cold streets
Empty hearts
Dancing to a new beat
With cruel intentions of self-satisfaction
I can see the cold air on my breath
A plague of unloving
Careless
A scar left on all the ones that cared for you
Breaking your promises
A pool of hearts left torn in two
As you lie still I face the cold night
Eyes wide open
Praying to be awoken
I can see the cold air on my breath
A plague of unloving
Cold streets
Empty hearts
Dancing to a new beat
Known as self-satisfaction
I can see the cold air on my breath
A plague of unloving
I can see the cold air on my breath
A plague of the heartless

We won't be getting any closer tonight
We won't be getting any warmer tonight
Tonight

Unfooled, I choose to believe in something more
I'll bleed for those who saved me
Bleed for those who've bled for me
I fucking choose to believe in something more
I'll bleed for those who saved me
Bleed for those who've bled for me
You have no heart
You have no heart
You have no heart
Awaken, awaken
Awaken from this nightmare
Awaken, awaken
Awaken from this nightmare
I'll bleed for those who've bled for me
