Brain cells
Disintegrate
Blood begins
To clot
Where you be standing
Upon next visit?
I'll never know

You promise shelter
But I felt the rain
Fall on my shoulder
You left me to rot
Cold and alone
I learn to survive
On my own
I don't need you
I never did
I'll stand
And walk away
Unwounded

What's left of me
Is a hollow shell
That yearns to be
A part of something
I won't let it
I'm too kind for that
I won't let it
I'm too kind for that
You're playing with fire
A slight turn in another direction
From here it looks like home
You'll never make it

Only a daydream

You'll never make it
Tonight I'll stand
And walk away
From everything
I once thought was real
