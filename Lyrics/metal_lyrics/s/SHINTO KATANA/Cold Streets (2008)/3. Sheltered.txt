Close the windows
Kill the lights
Cover your eyes
Turn up the volume
Drown the sound
Never speak again
There's another world outside, suffering
There's another breed outside, suffering
Can you hear them calling? Suffering
Lock the doors, you're better off anyway

None of this exists as far as you're concerned
None of this exists
None of this exists as far as you're concerned
None of this exists

Hide under the sheets
Hope to dream of better things
You wouldn't look twice
You wouldn't want to know
Hide under the sheets
Hope to dream of better things
None of this exists
Blinded by shelter
Can you hear them screaming?
Too busy sleeping
Can you feel them hurting?
Too busy hiding
Can you feel them hurting?
Too busy hiding
Fuck you

Calling out to the back of your head
Must be so comforting

You're hiding from the truth

Hide under the sheets
And hope to dream of better things
Hide under the sheets
'Cause none of this exists
Hide under the sheets
'Cause none of this exists
I hope you dream of better things
Fuck you
