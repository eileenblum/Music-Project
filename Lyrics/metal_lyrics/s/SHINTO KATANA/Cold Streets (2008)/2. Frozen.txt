[feat. Jaimz Goughe]t
I know what's real
Beneath the surface of the coldest ocean 
I'm drowning
I'm sinking
Standing at the foot of the highest mountain
I'm freezing
But I can't feel a thing
Beneath the surface of the coldest ocean
I'm drowning
I'm sinking
Standing at the foot of the highest mountain
I'm freezing
But I cant feel a thing

My hearts been frozen
So long
That I can't feel anything
At all
There's nothing left of warmth
Nothing to melt the ice
In my lungs

I've turned my back a thousand times
Its all you showed me
It's all you ever showed

Beneath the surface of the coldest ocean
I'm drowning
I'm sinking
Standing at the foot of the highest mountain
I'm freezing
But I can't feel a thing

How can you 
Expect me
To fucking love
In a world that showed me nothing but hate
Nothing but hate

Say what you want
I know what's real
There's no such thing as love
There's no such thing as trust
Say what you want
I know what's real
Say what you want
I know what's fucking real

I'm drowning
And I can't feel a thing
I'm freezing
And I can't feel a thing
I'm dying
And I can't feel a thing
I never feel anything
I never feel anything
I never feel anything
