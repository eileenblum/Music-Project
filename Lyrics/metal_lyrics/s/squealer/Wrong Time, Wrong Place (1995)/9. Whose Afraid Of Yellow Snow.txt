Yeah,
I wanna live my life with my own attitude
No one tell me what I have to do
Isn't worth a say
Forbidden things and frontiers
All the time and all the way
It makes me ill and sick
You motherfucking face!

I'm fed up with this life
With hypocritical lies
Living in a world
Not for the poor and for the weak
Believe in what they're doing
Today and in the past
It makes me ill and sick
You motherfucking face!

[Chorus:]
Whose afraid of yellow snow?
It makes me ill and sick!
Whose afraid of yellow snow?
You motherfucking face!

Many people want
To come up with the new
They won't hang around
Not copy anyone
But all they ever do
Is create their boring trends
It makes me ill and sick
You motherfucking face!

[Chorus:]
Whose afraid of yellow snow?
It makes me ill and sick!
Whose afraid of yellow snow?
You motherfucking face!

Crabbing what they can
Millions for " defence "
They do what they do best
Without intelligence
Sharing other's money
And betting by the race
It makes me ill and sick
You motherfucking face!

[Chorus]
