You don't know why
You have lost your will
You have lost your will to live
Never thought
That you could scorn your wife
And that you want to take her life

[Pre - Chorus:]
You wanna live? - You wanna die!
You wanna live? - You wanna die!

You don't know why
You are wasting time
By doing stupid works
Always broke
Cause you don't know the tricks
You are working for big wigs

[Pre - Chorus]

[Chorus:]
Time doesn't wait
Not for me and not for you
Yeah, in the course of time
We will be dust in the wind
Why don't you break your chains
Take your time!

You don't know why you grin and bear
And why you're dreaming full of fear
You're looking forward to leave of work
While sleeping your day away

[Pre - Chorus]
[Chorus]

You don't know why
You have lost your will
And why you're looking for new thrills
Are you afraid of the course of time?
It's your friend and not your foe!

[Pre - Chorus]

Die!

[Chorus]
