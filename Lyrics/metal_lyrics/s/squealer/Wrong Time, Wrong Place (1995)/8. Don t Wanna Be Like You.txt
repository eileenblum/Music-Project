Hey, once upon a time
There was an intact scene
Heavy meant to live
Not blaming the friends
Instead of helping hands
They trust in trends
Everyboy fights against each other

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna be like you
This is what I say
I don't wanna be like you

Disputes between the bands
Will divide the fans
I'm fed up with this guys
Who don't care about
Revenge is so sweet
For those who can wait
But all I wanna do is to laugh at you, haha

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna be like you
This is what I say
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna be like you
This is what I say
I don't wanna be like you
You, this is what you pray

Only love yourself
You are the hottest band
Tell so many lies
Bout the bands you'd liked
Destroy the local scene is a fashion today
Everybody fights against each other

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna be like you
This is what you say
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna be like you
This is what you say
I don't wanna be like you
This is what I pray

This is what I pray - This is what I pray
