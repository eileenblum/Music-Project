This was my life - lights out
I wanna know where' the good times gone?
I feel blue - where is my place?
You should pray - disgrace, yeah!

[Pre - Chorus:]
Jeremy prays forgivin
'Taking what you need
Please Lord help me now
Just to go my way
Where are we going?
Hear the news all day
Is this real or not?
Seek for a better life

This was my life - so strange
I wanna know where' the good times gone?
I wanna touch you - you wanna fetch me
Stand up and break these chains!

[Pre - Chorus]

[Chorus:]
Where is the end?
Where is the end my friend?
Where is the end? - Where is the end?

[Chorus:]
Where is the end?
Where is the end my friend?
Where is the end? - you might now!

[Pre - Chorus]

[Chorus:]
Where is the end?
Where is the end my friend?
Where is the end?
Where is the end?
Where is the end my friend?

My friend!
