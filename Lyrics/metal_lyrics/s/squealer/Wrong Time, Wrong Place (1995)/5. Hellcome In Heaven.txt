Your life's been changing
Leaving your past
You wish you'd wings to fly
To leave reality
No one hears your call

Living in fear
So many years
You wish you'd wings to fly
To leave reality
Never show your tears

[Pre - Chorus:]
You know that your time is too short
You're believing in me I'm your deceiver
You know that you're wasting your time
You're believing in me, hellcome in heaven!

How long's forever?
Always bear the pain
You wish you'd wings to fly
To leave reality
Out in the dark

Lying in your bed
When you hear your Dad
You wish you'd wings to fly
To leave reality
Into a nowhereland

[Pre - Chorus]

Hellcome in heaven
Was this your choice?
You wish you'd wings to fly
To leave reality
Into the dark

Living in fear
So many years
You wish you'd wings to fly
To leave reality
Never show your tears

[Pre - Chorus:]
You know - that your time is too short
You know - you're believing in me
You know - that you're wasting your time
You know - you're believing in me

[Chorus:]
Hellcome - in heaven
Hellcome - your time is too short
Hellcome - in heaven
Hellcome - in heaven
Hellcome - you're believing in me
Hellcome - in heaven
Hellcome - in heaven
Hellcome - you're time is too short
Hellcome - in heaven
In heaven
In heaven
