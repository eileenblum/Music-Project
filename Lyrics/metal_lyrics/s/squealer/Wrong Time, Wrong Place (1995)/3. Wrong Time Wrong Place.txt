Wrong time wrong place
You get nothing to do
It seems like somebody's playing with you
You fall down
But you forgot to stand up
Shut up, I don't care what you say!

[Pre - Chorus (Twice):]
You wanna feel me
You want to break me down

[Chorus:]
Wrong time wrong place
You're a hunter of luck
Wrong time wrong place
Your fate's escaping from you
Wrong time wrong place
Your reality has gone
Wrong time wrong place
Get out of my life!

Ha, Ha

Wrong time wrong place
You've got holes in your shoes
It seems like you gotta wish it's not true
An inner strength
Started pumping you out
Shut up, I don't care what you say!

[Pre - Chorus (Twice)]
[Chorus]
[Repeat 1. Verse]
[Pre - Chorus (Twice)]

[Chorus:]
Wrong time wrong place
You're a hunter of luck
Wrong time wrong place
Your fate's escaping from you
Wrong time wrong place
Your reality has gone
Wrong time
Wrong time
Wrong time
Wrong time
Wrong time, wrong place!
