You say cold when it is hot
Contradiction is your friend
You say yes when I say no - you suck!

[Pre - Chorus:]
If you wanna go down
When you wanna be free
It's like a sea without a ground
Where you'll never be found
I don't wanna go down
Even when I burn the town
Use your brain

[Chorus:]
This is my life and I love to hate you
You say
This is my life and I love to hate you

You say red when it is green
Opposition is your game
It's the same old story
Every minute of my life

[Pre - Chorus]

[Chorus:]
This is my life and I love to hate you
You say
This is my life and I love to
Hate you
Hate you
Hate you
Hate you

[Pre - Chorus]

Use your brain!
