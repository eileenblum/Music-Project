You are the one who's playing with risk
Searchin' the ultimate kick
You are the one who's fuckin' this fate
Dancing on a razor blade

Feeling the speed
`Til your brain will bleed
Your blood runs red
Craving for lust

The eternity of a day
You have to go your final way
Your fate isn't in your hands
Just a trace in the sand

To live by the sword means to die by the sword
But you don't believe any word
Cutting the blind bend with your motor bike
Now even your fate is sealed

Your luck tastes revenge
Have taken your legs
Paying the price
For your nature cold as ice

The eternity of a day
You have to go your final way
Your fate isn't in your hands
Just a trace in the sand
