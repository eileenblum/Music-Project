I can't imagine why people always cry
They are never satisfied with that they own
Always on the run searching for their fun
But they forget that they will lose
What they should love

No one to blame to lose and to win
Down on your luck pray for your sin
No one to blame your fortune has gone
Down on your luck so let it be done

Many people don't know what they own
They don't appreciate the ones who give them love
Their life is built on lies but they don't recognize
They forget that they will lose
What they should love

No one to blame to lose and to win
Down on your luck pray for your sin
No one to blame your fortune has gone
Down on your luck so let it be done
