You are a liar
Many people trust in you
You know exactly
What they want to hear

What's your aim in life?
What do you want to be?
You need drugs to hide yourself
T wear your masquerade
I don't know why
Your way is an eye for an eye

There is nothing to believe
You will deceive
All those who trust in you
`Cause there's nothing
Nothing to believe
I can't believe
Believe you any word
There is nothing to believe
Nothing to believe

Your reason to live
Is to take and not to give
Acting like a snake
Hiding in the shade

What's your aim in life?
What do you want to be?
You need drugs to hide yourself
T wear your masquerade
I don't know why
Your way is an eye for an eye

There is nothing to believe
You will deceive
All those who trust in you
`Cause there's nothing
Nothing to believe
I can't believe
Believe you any word
There is nothing to believe
Nothing to believe
