World seems to turn into grey
I lost my longin' to stay
All warnings of nature simply have failed
People have lost their ways
This is the end of all days
From zero to none all life has gone

Say good-bye
There will be no sun and moon
End of the world
Say good-bye
Nature will begin to cry
End of the world
But they don't know why!

Whole world is searching for fame
Pay the price for this game
All warnings of nature simply have failed
Nearly all true love has gone
Simply looking for fun
From zero to none all life has gone

Say good-bye
There will be no sun and moon
End of the world
Say good-bye
Nature will begin to cry
End of the world
But they don't know why!

Say good-bye
When night and day will be united
Say good-bye
The end of the world is coming soon
Say good-bye
There won't be sun and wan't be moon
Say good-bye
The end of the world is coming soon
