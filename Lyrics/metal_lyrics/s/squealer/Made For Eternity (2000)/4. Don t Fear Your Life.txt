We'll be what we will be
The future's not ours to see
Step by step I will claim my aim
I'll keep my inner flame

Who wants to live, to love and to give?
Open your eyes and please,
Tell me no lies!

We'll be what we will be
Don't fear your life
Who wants to live and to give
Don't fear your life

Don't fear your life
Don't fear your life
Don't fear your life
Don't fear your...

We'll be what we will be
Don't fear your life
Who wants to live and to give
Don't fear your life

Don't fear your life
Don't fear your life
Don't fear your life
Don't fear your...

Don't fear your life!
