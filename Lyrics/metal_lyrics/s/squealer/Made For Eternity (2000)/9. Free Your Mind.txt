Believe in what you used to be
Many people do not see
Try to think and use your brain
To swim against the human grain

I hate these guys
Believing their own lies
Tear down your wall
Live before you fall

Free your mind
There's so much more to see
Free your mind
Why do you follow the blind?
Free your mind
Be what you used to be
Free your mind
Why do you follow the blind?

Day by day people they want to tell
What is black and what is white
Hate these guys I'll send them to hell
Stupid crowds stand side by side

I hate these guys
Believing their own lies
Tear down your wall
Live before you fall

Free your mind
There's so much more to see
Free your mind
Why do you follow the blind?
Free your mind
Be what you used to be
Free your mind
Why do you follow the blind?
