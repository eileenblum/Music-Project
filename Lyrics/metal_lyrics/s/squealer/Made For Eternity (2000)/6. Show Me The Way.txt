Your life is going wrong
Spits you in your face
Thinking there's no better act of grace
Is it your right to try suicide?
Learn to fight and do not hide!

But you solution's named - suicide
It's your act of grace - suicide
Try to fight your fears - suicide

Show me the way I have to go
Give me just one reason for my stay
Show me a better place to be
Take you by the hand to find your way

Unable to control
And to fight your inner fears
Lost your sense of life for many years
Is it your right to try suicide?
Learn to fight and not to hide!

But you solution's named - suicide
It's your act of grace - suicide
Try to fight your fears - suicide

Show me the way I have to go
Give me just one reason for my stay
Show me a better place to be
Take you by the hand to find your way

How did life begin?
And where did life come from?
You will take your own
Simply throw it away
Committing suicide...
You're not worth to cry for you!

Tomorrow means forever
It's a game you should not play
Such an easy trick to run away
Is it your your right to try suicide?
Learn to fight and do not hide!

Show me the way I have to go
Give me just one reason for my stay
Show me a better place to be
Take you by the hand to find your way
