Follow the sign
The sign of the light
Shining and sparkling so bright

In a land of mystery
Of love and honesty
Let me take you far away in my dreams

Don't be afraid
We touch the day so far away
The final daylight
Don't be afraid
We touch the day so far away
It's the final daylight

Night after night
Searching for the light
It shows me the place where I belong

My mind is far away
I'm smelling the day
Let me take you far away in my dreams

Don't be afraid
We touch the day so far away
The final daylight
Don't be afraid
We touch the day so far away
It's the final daylight
