Facts turn into fate
Corpse desecrated and raped
Fires burning so cold
Lies for truth they were told

There was a time to change
it was on you

Acts unseen unpure
Mass destruction the cure
Illusion of faith
Crossing unwalkable ways

Now it's time to make a change
drop your mask betrayer
On your knees now you will crawl
Right to fate betrayer

Wind's merciless blow
dark future to show
Grin while others cry
each word just a lie

Now it's time to make a change...
