Sensuality is the wrong word
It's more like being trapped inside
Is this a man or an animal
Is it me or a monster instead

Blooming desire no control
Carry me higher I'm a sick man

What is real inside this world I live
These urges never to repress
Who am I where do I run to
These urges never to repress

Words in my head never to be spoken
This secret I hold a monstrosity
I know guilt and I know morality
But I know I can't be stopped

Blooming desire no control
Carry me higher I'm a sick man

What is real inside this world I live...
