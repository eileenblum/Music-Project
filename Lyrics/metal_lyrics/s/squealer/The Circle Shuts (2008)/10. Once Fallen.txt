Back on my feet again
I pulled myself out of the mud
And all those lovely friends
Are gone like straws in the wind
It's no surprise
Lost all disguise
I carry on
Stay on my own

Now I feel free again
I am alone but doing well
I am my own best friend
This friendship last forevermore
It's no surprise
Lost all disguise
I carry on
Stay on my own

Call me the one once fallen
Now I'm the leader of the pack
No bowing and no crawling
I won't defend I just attack

Still I am growing strong
Experienced by greed and hate
I know I can't be wrong
Watching the world being wrecked each day
It's no surprise
Lost all disguise
I carry on
Stay on my own

Call me the one once fallen
Now I'm the leader of the pack
No bowing and no crawling
I won't defend I just attack

I stood up I am stronger

Call me the one once fallen...
