Here comes your nightmare back again
Did you think you're safe?
I never wanted to forget
And so should you
I'm crazy and that's for sure
But do not care
I never was to blame for that
Cause it runs in the family

The years in jail made me insane
Between these walls I had time to think

You wonder how I found you
I just followed my nose
This scent was always on my mind
Cause you smell like a rose
Saying no you still mean yes
It's the same as before
Look at me my purest goddess
Now I use you like a whore

I cam for you
Back here to say hello
Nightmares have come true
I came for you

I've waited oh so long for this
Short moment in time
Love faded and hatred grew so strong
I saw your agony every night
Now just for a second I'm a king
Nomore a clown
No! Why did you die that fast
I deserve more entertainment

The years in jail made me insane...

I cam for you...

Back here to say hello to you
Back here to share some love
