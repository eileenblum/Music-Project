See the masses how they're raging
Feel their hatred's daily growth
Longing just for global power
Not a method is a taboo

See them burn the flags and pictures
See them raise their automatic arms
Loving fathers true believers
Offering their only sons

Perversion or salvation
Is what their god has send
But he who knows the answer
Is silent all the way

March side by side
Martyrs of the half moon
Die with a smile
Martyrs of the half moon

Who's to blame for this delusion
it is surely not their god
In the holy book it's written
Do not kill nor kill yourself

Perversion or salvation
Is what their god has send
But he who knows the answer
Is silent all the way

March side by side
Martyrs of the half moon
Die with a smile
Martyrs of the half moon

Spit on them
Holy man
Let them burn
You're sublime

March side by side...
