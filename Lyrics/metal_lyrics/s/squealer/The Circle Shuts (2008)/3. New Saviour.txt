New times waiting old times fading
Nothing remains the same
So relentless mostly aimless
Confusion is what we see
Hear the piper from his shelter
Luring all the rats
False messiah's crippled mind
Using any chance

We don't believe just what we see
Another controls our will to be

Hope is falling while we're crawling
Into the bright white light
Starbeam calling all the hopeless
Who waited for a sign
What gives us hope is just a word
We lick from a liars lips
God is speaking we want to believe it
And everything's just benign

We don't believe just what we see
Another controls our will to be
See us praying the ancient words
Blessings he sends just like a curse

New saviour are you there
Worship you forevermore
New saviour get aware
We're sheep and you're a carnivore

Hear the piper from his shelter
Luring all the rats
False messiah's crippled mind
Using any chance

We don't believe just what we see
another controls our will to be
See us praying the ancient words
Blessings he sends just like a curse

New saviour are you there...
