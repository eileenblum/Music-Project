Violence and aggression become passion in this world
Walking down the alley smelling the prey - tally ho!
Feeling like a hunter aiming for the strongest stag
All the satisfied and all the fat should now take care

Are you afraid - he came to judge you
Are you afraid - they call him thrasher
Who is to blame - violence and aggression
Who is to blame - hatred of the thrasher

Fear the stalking thrasher in the canyons you call streets
Resistance from the gutter getting hotter day by day
Victims never get to know the violators name
Leaders of society they hide in towers of glass

Are you afraid...

Who do you think you are?
Everytime you went to far
You planted a gentle breeze
But a hurricane is what you harvest

Are you afraid...
