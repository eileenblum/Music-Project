You're spitting fire you're spreading glowing hate
Your rage is boiling so hot I can't resist
From deep within like an ancient magma stream
It's just unquenchable no cooling from this heat

Cool down before it's to late
Maybe there's no turning back

Keep away
do never play with fire
Keep away
From the sources of ignition

You've always been hot you never ran away
Like a volcano lidsed by a giant rock
They call you hothead just unpredictable
You stand in flames again but who's the arsonist

Cool down before it's too late
Maybe there's no turning back

Keep away...

Lit by hate - boiling rage

Keep away...
