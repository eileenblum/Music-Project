Hope's falling away
There's nothing to stay
All around me just loss
But who pays the cost?

My longing it ends
On this last of all days
And the last tear dried out
Before touching the ground

Brown leaves are flying
Blown down by the wind
Autumn is coming
Turning me to grey

These days getting cold
Uncertain future obscured
The upcrawling frost
Slowly covers my soul

Brown leaves are flying...

Iceflowers on the window
No chance to watch the world
It's the beginning of the end
I'm not afraid of winterfrost

Brown leaves are flying
Blown down by the wind
Autumn is coming
Turning me to grey
