I counted every brick of the walls you built around me
Freedom is a foreign word long ago I lost it's meaning
Now it is time to break the jail that held me back so long
I planned to rise again to build a place that I call eden

I am the one to tear down prisons and cages
I am the animal you dream of at night

Shattered by tension I still wait for my own kingdom
I built of blood and tears of this lamb that they call human
Certainly it is my fate to reign and legislate
Now I know the time is right for a new race to be hatched out

I am the one to tear down prisons and cages
I am the animal you dream of at night
I am the link between demonic and godlike
I am the master of true disguise
