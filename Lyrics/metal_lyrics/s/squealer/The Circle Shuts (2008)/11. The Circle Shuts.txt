Anything around me tried to bring me down
On the run from anything just anger all around
I ran but didn't turn my look just straight on
I'm lonely and on my own all trust is gone

All these years I ran by but now I know
The circle shuts
I'm the one who kept the true belief
The circle shuts

Through years of darkness perserverent I went on
No one ever gave a damn but I'm still here
To take my chance again to laugh in their faces
Of all the slanderers and all the hypocrites

All these years I ran by but now I know...
