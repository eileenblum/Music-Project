The loss of independence
The highest price you'd payed
Finished with this madness
Means tearing down the walls
Can you feel the torture?
The story's ending here
I can't bear this agony
Killing him tonight

[Bridge:]
Now the time has come
To get your life
Before the sun will rise
I shoot him down
And I feel cool
Come and feel me
Come and touch touch me
Get rid of him

20000 thoughts
Are rushing through my brain
I will get rid of him
His life is ending here
He never thinks
Of hurt my feelings
Claim your aim right now
Pulling down the trigger
Revenge is disappear

[Bridge:]
20000 thoughts
Are in my brain
The highest price you'd payed
Is nothing worth
Tearing down the walls of agony
You'll get rid of him
If you like

[Bridge]
