Feeling my own heart will tear apart
Seperation means much pain
But even in the darkest hour
Something makes me going on

Millions of people fight for their lifes
But noone will survive
It's a part of history
Aren't pride to written it
You better run away

[Bridge:]
Hey when the bombs are falling down
Suppress your enemies
You can't stay
This is my last will
Your brother is dying
Close your eyes
Noone stops this crazy game
Try to win the end is near

Noone wins the senseless war
You will burn deep in hell
Machine gun fire in the night
Human beings lost their fight
You better run away

[Bridge]

Stop! There's no way out
The time is right to take you life
Burn the wings of sadness
You will burn deep in hell
Ha, Ha, Ha
The war is over now
