You sacrifice your whole life
To the holy church
You've changed your life completely
Since the day you've lost your way

In the name of god
Living under rules
You don't need to understand
Why there are rules to be a christ

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't need no money
You don't need no feelings
You don't need no glory
But when you...

[Chorus]
Look up to the sky
When lust is calling you
Don't know how to fight
This painful lust- painful lust- painful

Oppress your deepest wishes
Look up to the sky
It's not allowed to show your feelings
Even when you're sad

You spend your life in darkness
Privation is the name
Looking for a better world
While you're searching for your peace

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus 2x]

Fall in love with you
When you close your door
Don't know how to fight
This painful lust- painful lust- painful- painful
