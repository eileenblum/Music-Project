I caught myself
In endless darkness
A blood red moon will be my light

Emptiness has praved my endless search
Please free my soul
And wash my sins away, away
And wash my sins away, away

[Chorus]
When daylight will fade away
Free the night
When daylight will fade away
Free the night
Fade away

Tears and pain
Eternal life
Feed the dark with a breath of life

I drift away with my wish to die
Please free my soul
And wash my sins away, away
And wash my sins away, away

[Chorus 3x]
When daylight will fade away
Free the night
When daylight will fade away
Free the night
Fade away
