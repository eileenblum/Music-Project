Your whole life is a lie!
I can tell you why
The world has become so strange my friend
Be patient and tough
Work hard to earn enough
They want you to be diligent until the end

Hurry up!
Don't stop!
Fly high!
Do everything to be satisfied

Hey!
Wake up!
Don't be the slave to these
Modern world maniacs

Can you feel the pain?
Same shit everyday
Sad feelings burn you like a flame
A slice of life
Inside your mind
A new punch in your face in those evil times

Hurry up!
Don't stop!
Fly high!
Do everything to be satisfied

Hey!
Wake up!
Don't be the slave to these
Modern world maniacs

If you're ready to realize
The system has failed
No time to cry
Watch the world with eagle eyes

Hurry up!
Don't stop!
Fly high!
Do everything to be satisfied

Hey!
Wake up!
Don't be the slave to these
Modern world maniacs
