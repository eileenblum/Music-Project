Endless time
Dreams passed by
Sometimes I feel I can revive
Smells, sounds and moods
Simply an era that has shaped me
Probably the course of things
And the way it should be

It's great to remember
It's great to generate
New strength from this mood

Longing for the moment to get that feeling
Dive into the past
Something is changing inside you
Time has passed forevermore
Be open-minded for something new

Gods from the past
Swinging to new deeds
Dreams can be reality
Whenever you need
The spirit goes on and on
But your memories will never be gone
Another story will be written

It's great to remember
It's great to generate
New strength from this mood

Longing for the moment to get that feeling
Dive into the past
Something is changing inside you
Time has passed forevermore
Be open-minded for something new

Turn back
To old deeds
Look ahead
It's great to be here
Finest hour
You will see
Best feeling
Will rise again

Longing for the moment to get that feeling
Dive into the past
Something is changing inside you
Time has passed forevermore
Be open-minded for something new
