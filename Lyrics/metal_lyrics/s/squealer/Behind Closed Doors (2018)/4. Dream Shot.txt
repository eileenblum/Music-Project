Here comes a dream shot
Some creepy shapes rise
From the bedside they look at me
Fear in my eyes
I'm scratching my pillow
And cover my face
Counting the seconds
And watch out for signs
The clock's running (tick tock)
And nowhere to hide
My body's in tension
And ready to fight
The evil is coming up
The end is so close
I wake up this morning
The rooster just crows

Dream Shot!

A few days later
Same kind of night
I'm bathing in sweat
Another death flight
From the highest tower
Down to the street
Situation is rushed
I'm falling so deep

No wings to get up
No slide to get down
I'm out of control
And spinning around
The evil is coming up
The end is so close
A new day is born
The rooster just crows

Dream Shot!

If you fall, try to call, when you
Feel the night explode!
I'll be there, you'll be there
Dream shots will be everywhere!

If you fall, hope is gone, blood and
Guts fall out of you
Pull the ripcord, I'll be there
Dream shots will be everywhere!

Dream Shot!
