I feel reality
But reality is gone
Don't tell me what to do
You're a liar, you're a fool
You are not exactly on my line
But there's no place for two in my mind

Day by day
An endless fight
Some evil seconds in my life
It pulls me down
And picks me up - again!

Inside my mind
I realize
Two worlds collide
Like spinning balls in a hall
No control!

We are out of space
We are out of time
I have no control
Two worlds collide
My heart's still bleeding

Inside my mind
I realize
Two worlds collide (I'm so disturbed)
Like spinning balls in a hall
No control!

We are out of space
We are out of time
I have no control
Two worlds collide
My heart's still bleeding

We are out of space
We are out of time
I have no control
Two worlds collide
My heart's still bleeding
