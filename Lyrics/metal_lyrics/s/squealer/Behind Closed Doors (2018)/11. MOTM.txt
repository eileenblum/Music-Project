Hey kid, who are you?
Introduce yourself, don't be afraid of me.
I'm your helping hand
Are you running away?

Take your time
Stand by my side
I would show you the world at that cold night
Give me your hand
Why do you shiver and shake?

Don't feel sad and enjoy your youth
Take a walk with me
I will tell you the truth
About your vicious world
And how it will turn bright

And if you want call the master of the moonlight

Ignite,
Hold on tight
This fire burns inside
Do what you want
Reach for the light
There's not just black and white
You might be strong,
You might be weak,
Don't be afraid to risk it all
The darkness disappears

By the way
I just want to say
You made a good move telling me the truth
Listen to my words
And you can change your life

Escaping your cage
And protect the force
That grows in you and no one knows
Keep your memories inside
Don't believe in lies

And if you want call the master of the moonlight

Ignite,
Hold on tight
This fire burns inside
Do what you want
Reach for the light
There's not just black and white
You might be strong,
You might be weak,
Don't be afraid to risk it all
The darkness disappears

The darkness disappears
The darkness disappears
The darkness disappears
The darkness disappears
The darkness disappears

Ignite,
Hold on tight
This fire burns inside
Do what you want
Reach for the light
There's not just black and white
You might be strong,
You might be weak,
Don't be afraid to risk it all
The darkness disappears

Ignite,
Hold on tight
This fire burns inside
Do what you want
Reach for the light
There's not just black and white
You might be strong,
You might be weak,
Don't be afraid to risk it all
The darkness disappears

Ignite,
Hold on tight
This fire burns inside

Ignite,
Hold on tight
This fire burns inside

Ignite,
Hold on tight
This fire burns inside

Ignite,
Hold on tight
This fire burns inside
