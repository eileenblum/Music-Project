Everything is damaged and no one cares
Don't tell me your passion and leave me alone
The world is going crazy, drawn by the past
Where the evil grows up, where nobody's spared
Come over here my foolish friend!

It might be a cancer, a social disease
Everything's blurred in bloody red
People promoting the evil from the deep
The world's spilled by madness like an ice cold breeze
Come over here my foolish friend!

Be welcome to this foolish man's invasion
Blinding my eyes!
Be welcome to this foolish man's invasion
It's hard to bear, it's hard to see
How pretty good the world could be
Are you worried by the news today
Of this foolish man's invasion?

Time to save the universe, conquered by crime
Creed is ruling the world, it's dangerous at any time
Directed by money, twisting your mind
Come over here my foolish friend!

Be welcome to this foolish man's invasion
Blinding my eyes!
Be welcome to this foolish man's invasion
It's hard to bear, it's hard to see
How pretty good the world could be
Are you worried by the news today
