Stop!
Accelerated breath
My landing here in time
Try to hide, be noiseless
Scratching steps
Behind the door
They're standing
Tall and crawl

Discomfort comes up in me
They cannot see me
They cannot hear me
But I have the feeling they can smell me

Behind closed doors!

I believe the time is right today
Behind closed doors they're waiting
So stand up
Break through the wall
Eternal nights and sorrow comes

State
My condition's paralyzed
Crippled mind
On my own
Curiosity - we'll see what's going on
Behind closed doors

Nothing to see
No one is here
I'm on my way to go insane
Nothing to see
No one was here
I can't explain
The story's over now

I believe the time is right today
Behind closed doors they're waiting
So stand up
Break through the wall
Eternal nights and sorrow comes

I believe the time is right today
Behind closed doors they're waiting
So stand up
Break through the wall
Eternal nights and sorrow comes
