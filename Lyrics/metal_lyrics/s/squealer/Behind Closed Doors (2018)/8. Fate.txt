Check your mind, you've never did this before
I've got a feeling and so much more
Driven by the longing
Revenge and sweet temptation

I feel my addiction
A downfall to fate

I see many colours, many lights and faces
Oh no, I can't believe
Some acts will raise the power of evil
There's no reality, everything's shifting

I feel my addiction
A downfall to fate
I live my obsession
Can't stand the day

Too scared to live
Downfall to fate
Depressed emotion
My silent fall!

My downfall to fate!

I feel my addiction
A downfall to fate
I live my obsession
Can't stand the day

Downfall to fate!
