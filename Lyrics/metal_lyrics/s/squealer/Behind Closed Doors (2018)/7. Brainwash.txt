Disillusion, great confusion
My life is a mess
No perspective, lost in this world
I become so depressed
Thank god you stepped in my life
I'm feeling weak, it's time to quit
You're telling me to step aside
And you will take care of it

Brainwash!
Brainwash!

You've gathered us, your âfamily"
And lead us to the Promised Land
âDo what I say!" is your first rule
Otherwise we shall die by your hand
I'm starting questioning your goals
Blind obedience, I know your plan
We're just your scapegoat, enough is enough
We're not your drones, well rise again

Brainwash!
Believing your lies, I will do anything
Brainwash!
Something in me dies, but you'll give me wings
Brainwash!
See the big picture, free will is overrated
Brainwash!
You know it best, conquer the rest!

Acting tough, that's all of your power
I will wrestle you down in our darkest hour
We are the resistance in the dead of night
You are the evil, but we are the light!

Brainwash!
Believing your lies, I will do anything
Brainwash!
Something in me dies, but you'll give me wings
Brainwash!
See the big picture, free will is overrated
Brainwash!
You know it best, conquer the rest!
