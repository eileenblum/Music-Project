Follow your heart, follow your fairy tale
This dream comes true if you believe
And hope this time will last forever
So if you try you will succeed

The dusk is coming out of nowhere
The final daylight leaves the sky

Time goes by
You never walk alone at night
Time goes by
Even if hope seems out of sight
Time goes by
Feel strong and powerful tonight
Time goes by
The dawn will come, vivid and bright

Places went by
Faces show up and disappear
Like they were just part of a dream
Stick to your guns
Don't let outsiders twist your fate
Find your own way and scream!

Time goes by
You never walk alone at night
Time goes by
Even if hope seems out of sight
Time goes by
Feel strong and powerful tonight
Time goes by
The dawn will come, vivid and bright

The dusk is coming out of nowhere
The final daylight leaves the sky

Time goes by
You never walk alone at night
Time goes by
Even if hope seems out of sight
Time goes by
Feel strong and powerful tonight
Time goes by
The dawn will come, vivid and bright
