I see the world living from the poor
I see the world scared inside
I see the world always on the run
I see the world killing just for fun

Money rules the world, living on the edge
Hate instead of love, lies about lies

I don't think that they will change their way of life
They always make the same mistakes
I don't think that they will learn to live and give
Greed in their eyes

[Chorus:]
I see the world living from the poor
I see the world scared inside
I see the world always on the run
I see the world killing just for fun

Praying for the poor, nothing is for sure
Hate in their eyes, lies about lies

I don't think that they will change their way of life
They always make the same mistakes
I don't think that they will learn to live and give
Greed in their eyes

[Chorus:]
I see the world living from the poor
I see the world scared inside
I see the world always on the run
I see the world killing just for fun

Money rules the world, living on the edge
Hate instead of love, lies about lies

I don't think that they will change their way of life
They always make the same mistakes
I don't think that they will learn to live and give
Greed in their eyes

[Chorus:]
I see the world living from the poor
I see the world scared inside
I see the world always on the run
I see the world killing just for fun
