You are wasting your time and wasting your life
You have to do a lot of needles things
But now you're changing your life, changing your mind
You can't deny your dreams you hold on tight
Yes, I don't wanna care if I'm right or if I'm wrong
Yes, I don't wanna care - changing your life!

You are selling your soul and selling your mind
Your sense of duty is your highest aim
But now you're changing your life, changing your mind
You can't deny your dreams you hold on tight
Yes, I don't wanna care if I'm right or if I'm wrong
Yes, I don't wanna care - changing your life!

[Chorus:]
Keep your friends close but your enemies even closer
You can't deny your dreams you should be hold on tight

You are wasting your time and wasting your life
You have to do a lot of needles things
But now you're changing your life, changing your mind
You can't deny your dreams you hold on tight
Yes, I don't wanna care if I'm right or if I'm wrong
Yes, I don't wanna care - changing your life!

[Chorus:]
Keep your friends close but your enemies even closer
You can't deny your dreams you should be hold on tight
Yes now, just keep your friends!

Yes, I don't wanna care if I'm right or if I'm wrong
Yes, I don't wanna care - changing your life!

[Chorus:]
Keep your friends close but your enemies even closer
You can't deny your dreams you should be hold on tight

Hold on Tight!
