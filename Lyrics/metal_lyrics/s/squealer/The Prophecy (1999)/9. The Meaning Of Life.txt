Say yeah! The meaning of life

You're hanging around and get nothing to do
Hope that your dreams come true
You act like a fool but you don't realise
Hope that you will find ...

[Chorus:]
The meaning of life, you're hanging around
The meaning of life, got nothing to do
The meaning of life, your dreams won't come true
The meaning of life, you're always old enough to die

Don't dreaming your life, better living your dreams
Hope that your dreams come true
There's no will to live you'd died with your birth
Hope that you will find ...

[Chorus:]
The meaning of life, you're hanging around
The meaning of life, got nothing to do
The meaning of life, your dreams won't come true
The meaning of life, you're always old enough to die
