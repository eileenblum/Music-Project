[Henner:]
Yes, I don't know what's going wrong

[Tobias Sammet:]
Thought that we are friends for life
I trust in you like no one else

[Henner:]
But now I feel your knife

[Chorus:]
You know what should I do
No one will save me

[Henner:]
There's one thing I have learned

[Tobias Sammet:]
Is not to believe in words
Believe in what you see and fear

[Henner:]
My end is coming near

[Chorus:]
You know what should I do
No one will save me
You know what should I do
No one will save me

[Repeat Chorus]
