I don't want to believe what man can do
Many people want to act like god
But heaven will remember all their sins
And they will come to take their revenge

[Pre - Chorus:]
Yes, can you smell the dark?
Your mind will touch your past
Embrace your inner pig
'Cause your conscience cannot hide
Yes, this is not a game. Pay the price for your fame
You've lost your soul in devil's game
You got no chance to win!

[Chorus:]
To die for your sins
There's nothing to win

[Pre - Chorus ( Whispered ):]
Yes, can you smell the dark?
Your mind will touch your past
Embrace your inner pig
'Cause your conscience cannot hide
Yes, this is not a game. Pay the price for your fame
You've lost your soul in devil's game
You got no chance to win!

[Repeat Pre - Chorus ( Shouted )]

[Chorus:]
To die for your sins
There's nothing to win
