Bastard black tongue, black tongue
Come test my patience throw caution to the wind
Take no fucking prisoners breathe oblivion dust and chant
Black tongue, black tongue
Unchained and hungry venting grit sulphur and piss
Heads are bleeding absent smile of the vacant sun
Live with spite, live with spite
Come test my patience throw caution to the wind
Take no fucking prisoners breathe oblivion dust and chant
