Anti devils back bone
Come drink from my fire enrich your desire make it clear deeply sincere
I have the key can't step with in completely trusting the stick thin
In cold blood you strip me and wonder look upon me as you plunder
No sense of pride creating my doom remorse fills your empty womb
Reason is anit
I am no criminal
I am no criminal
