The greatest story every told
Dictating interpretation
Condemnation or devotion
Controversy campaign outrage
Blessing turn to
Conflict of interest
Warning shots
Embodiment struggle
Watching through me
Eyes of a blind man
Common decency potent

Fuck your religion
I piss on your altar
Organized torment
Is it faith or fury?

Being led from the wilderness
Ruled by gods
Dictated by religion
Goodness mutates into the sinister
Human or divine weakness
Exclusive cries from young and old
Who controls your desire?
Salvation at it's best or worst
The true voice of murder

Fuck your religion
I piss on your altar
Organized torment
Is it faith or fury?
