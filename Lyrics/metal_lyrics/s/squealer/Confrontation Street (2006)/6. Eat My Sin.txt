Enter through pain eater of sin cast a blind eye
To resolve rejection trading one pain to numb deep pain taking to dead end
Road chosen to mask your shame, shame, shame, shame goodbye
Every fear has a wish running from the things we need
Unrepentant thief exposed a measure of your worth
Values stripped down to walk with guilt
Questions subject of desperation
Your infantile commitment thin
Taking the dead end road chosen to mask your shame, shame, shame, shame goodbye
Every fear has a wish running from the things we need
Unrepentant thief exposed a measure of your worth
Eating my sin, eating my sin, eating my sin
Death by excess
