Oblivious to true lies until he crossed the sea a victim of seduction
In a dark land he stayed paying homage to his queen embrace precious enemy
Starring deep into your secrets where Lucifer does dwell grip on tight to a broken dream

I won't feel stained I won't bow stained I won't lye in sad remains blood red halo
I won't live stained I won't stay stained I won't hang my head in shame blood red halo

Eye for an eye leaves everyone blind and broken but in my eyes your face remains
So tragic in the art of forgiveness I stand and wait from far away
A waiting ghosts last thread of courage lead this lamb to slaughter

I won't feel stained I won't bow stained I won't lye in sad remains blood red halo
I won't live stained I won't stay stained I won't hang my head in shame
My life's at war
I won't feel stained I won't bow stained I won't lye in sad remains blood red halo
I won't live stained I won't stay stained I won't hang my head in shame blood red halo
