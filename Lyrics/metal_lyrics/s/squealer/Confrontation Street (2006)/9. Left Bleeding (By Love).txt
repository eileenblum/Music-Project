Build your conscience earn your future exercise your freedom to offend
Year after year on angry silence consumed with passion love is blind
Consoling with others only deepened the hurt torture living a lie a one sided hell
Broken and bruised he gave it all open hearts bleed feel the bloody flow

Trusting in his heart he followed though the thick and the thin
Deceived and thrown away his falling left bleeding by love

Fighting rejection this is no game of chance being pushed aside becomes routine
Ashamed of empty threads of violence forgive me living a lie a one sided hell
Broken and bruised he gave it all open hearts bleed feel the bloody flow
Trusting in his heart he followed though the thick and the thin
Deceived and thrown away his falling left bleeding by love
Walking the straight line between love and hate only the truth will ease the pain

Trusting in his heart he followed though the thick and the thin
Deceived and thrown away his falling left bleeding by love

Another roll of the dice he gambles time to slaughter the dove
Deceived and thrown away his falling left bleeding by love
