There's a new son rising in the world today
Common man condemned to live as a slave
To a unseen menace elusive not brave
Unforgiving the innocent pay
There's a new son rising in the world today
Fanatical mayors welcome unmarked grave
Weapons of war supplied from our daily's lives
No judge no jury committing genocide
New son rising ground zero
New son rising committing genocide
A living saint or sinner a king or criminal
Heathen or hero beat back the beast survive
New son rising ground zero
New son rising committing genocide
A living saint or sinner a king or criminal
Heathen or hero beat back the beast survive
Dark days looming over western skies
Sanctuary element of surprise
Massacre emotions destruction
Reclaiming mortal sin gratification
New son rising ground zero
New son rising committing genocide
A living saint or sinner a king or criminal
Heathen or hero beat back the beast survive
