Pray to as many different gods
As there are flowers in the world
Wich one is the real one? Let me know!

To avoid the same old questions
We have to ask ourselves
Why do we make the same mistakes
As long as people live on earth?

[Chorus 2x]
Who will save their souls
If we can not save our own?
Don't need fanatic leaders - Thinking is allowed!

It's good to keep your inner faith
But don't be a headless fool
And don't allow to be a weaken boy

Who will save their lonely souls
If we can not save our own
They call it "in the name of god"
When they try to rule with blood and crime

[Chorus 3x]
