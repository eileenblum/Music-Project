Show your souls for fame and money all frontiers blown away
Be a clown for the whole nation you are a superstar

[Pre-Chorus]
See these new times heroes
Another cute cheap thrill
Strangers live their lives for you
On the TV screen

[Chorus]
We need Low Budget Heroes
Stripping with their mind
We need Low Budget Heroes
Stripping with their mind

Do you think you reach to move mountains with your voice?
But every little grain of sand is maybe a first step

[Pre-Chorus]
See these new times heroes
Another cute cheap thrill
Strangers live their lives for you
On the TV screen

[Chorus]
We need Low Budget Heroes
Stripping with their mind
We need Low Budget Heroes
Stripping with their mind

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
