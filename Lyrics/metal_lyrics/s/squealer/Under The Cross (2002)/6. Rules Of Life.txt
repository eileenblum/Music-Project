A strange voice calls from afar:
"Can I chase away my fears?"
Life is out of our hands in spite of our plans

Separation is our fate but it will be my gate
To meet again is our hope, please tell me...

[Chorus 2x]
How will I see what the future keeps for me?
Oh I've never seen the sun but I feel the rules of life

The more you will own
The more you have to leave
Hope my wish will find your heart
Doesn't matter where you are

Separation is our fate but it will be my gate
To meet again is our hope, please tell me...

[Chorus 2x]
How will I see what the future keeps for me?
Oh I've never seen the sun but I feel the rules of life
