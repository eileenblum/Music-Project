Once there was a battle there
In Zaire, in Zaire
Hundred thousand people there
In Zaire, in Zaire
All those people gathered there
In Zaire, in Zaire
To see the rumble in the jungle i-i-i-in...
In Zaire

Came a man called Elijah
In Zaire, in Zaire
With him came the superstar
In Zaire, in Zaire
All those people came from far
In Zaire, in Zaire
To see the rumble in the jungle i-i-i-in...
In Zaire

And who was the victor of the night?
Elijah Mohammed's bog, Ali won the fi-i-i-ight
In Zaire

All those people chanted there
In Zaire, in Zaire
Seven rounds of torture there
In Zaire, in Zaire
One more round and Ali's there
In Zaire, in Zaire
There was a great excitement everywhe-e-e-er...
In Zaire

The lightning struck twice in the night
First in the ring and then after the fi-i-i-ight
In Zaire

In Zaire, in Zaire...
