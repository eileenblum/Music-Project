As long as human beings are
The cross means hope and pain
Too many despots used the cross
To get through their bloody reign

[Pre-Chorus]
So many burning times nailed to the cross
Abused as a symbol of persecution

[Chorus]
Under the cross - The whole world doesn't turn on me
Under the cross - Longing for the end
Under the cross - This is what I'm crying for
Under the cross - Where is our hope to live in peace?

Many people lost their lives
When they didn't follow tyrants aims
It's a good thing to believe in god
But always mankind makes it burn

[Pre-Chorus]
So many burning times nailed to the cross
Abused as a symbol of persecution

[Chorus]
Under the cross - The whole world doesn't turn on me
Under the cross - Longing for the end
Under the cross - This is what I'm crying for
Under the cross - Where is our hope to live in peace?

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
