I'm lost in emptiness - Never ending mess
Since these foolish games have torn me apart

I'm feeling far away - And all my thoughts begin to freeze
When I'm thinking of these good and honest times

I will wait the signs to come - I will wait the time to come
I will wait and hope you bring me back my dreams

[Chorus 2x]
It's my last goodbye - Bounding for an endless time
My wish failed its aim - But you want me to stay

Try to start again - Hail to those who dare
It's a role I've never learned to play

But life is going on - And take your future as your aim
And live all dreams you should be holding tight

I will wait the signs to come - I will wait the time to come
I will wait and hope you bring me back my dreams

[Chorus 2x]
It's my last goodbye - Bounding for an endless time
My wish failed its aim - But you want me to stay

Last goodbye - Failed it's aim - Endless time

It's my last, my last goodbye
