Improve your situation
Try to make a step
Life is not too short to feed your brain

You were not kissed by luck
And got no chance to learn
It's worth to realise what you could be

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn the key to open wonderland
Fedd your head with brain and you will be

[Chorus]
Out of the dark
You've bee trying to find your way
Out of the dark
You've been trying to fight your fears
Out of the dark
You've been trying to find your way
Out of the dark

Now take your second chance
Maybe it's your last
To have a better time on mother earth

Search for new horizons and searching for the light
Believe in your skill and leave the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn the key to open wonderland
Fedd your head with brain and you will be

[Chorus]
Out of the dark
You've bee trying to find your way
Out of the dark
You've been trying to fight your fears
Out of the dark
You've been trying to find your way
Out of the dark

[Chorus]
Out of the dark
You've bee trying to find your way
Out of the dark
You've been trying to fight your fears
Out of the dark
You've been trying to find your way
Out of the dark
You've been trying to fight your fears
Out of the dark!
