So many lucky days in lifen, I loved my children and my wife
I thought I have no time to show them what I feel

'Cause my highest aim was making just another step
On the ladder of career, only - living - for myself

[Chorus]
I'm down - Down and out - I've lost all the things I've loved
Now, I'm down - Down and out - Even the sense of my life has gone

I liked to bargain with the devil
But it seems all tables turned
I waste my time with trivial things I called my life

'Cause my highest aim was making just another step
On the ladder of career, only - living - for myself

[Chorus 2x]
I'm down - Down and out - I've lost all the things I've loved
Now, I'm down - Down and out - Even the sense of my life has gone
