Oh well I'm the type of guy
Who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are
Will you know that I'm around
I kiss'em and love'em
'Cause their needs are all the same
I help'em and I squeeze'm
They don't even know my name
They call me the wanderer
They call me the wanderer
I rome around, around, around, around

Oh well there's Joe on my left arm
And there's Mary on the right
And Jenny is the girl that I'll be with tonight
And when she asks me
Wich one I love the best
I tear upon my shoulder
There's Rosie on my chest
They call me the wanderer
They call me the wanderer
Irome around, around, around, around

Oh well I rome from town to town
I go through life without a care
And I'm happy as a clown
An, with my two fists of mine
But I'm going all way on

I'm the type of guy
That likes to rome around
I'm never in one place
I rome from town to town
When I find my self
Fallen for some girls
I up ride into a car of mine
And drive around the world
They call me the wanderer
They call me the wanderer
I rome around, around...

[Repeat Verse]
[Repeat Chorus]
