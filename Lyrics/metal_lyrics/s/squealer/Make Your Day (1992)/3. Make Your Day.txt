Time is no good healer
Malice desires to harm
Your body is getting weaker
No chance to survive

[Bridge:]

"Uncurable " said the doctor
"Soon you must die
Total loss of memory
Amnesia in your mind "
Soon you must die
Your body's getting weaker now
Total loss of memory
Now make your day

[Chorus:]
Make your day!
Time is no good healer

Join the time and have much fun
Easy living called the game
Now - you must pay your bill
For livin', lovin' and forgivin'

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Looking back those wasted years
Crying, spying, many tears
Too much drugs, excessive life
Infect yourself, eternal cry

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
