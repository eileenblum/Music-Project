Scaring the winds, the wind of hate
Nothing is left not even their fate
Nature dies every day
The tables are turned, don't you see?

Scaring down the winds
Winds of sacrifice
Nature turns to dust

The sun burns red the time is short
Air pollution everywhere
Noone is afraid - what is fear?
The sky is crying can't you hear?

Scaring down the winds
Winds of sacrifice
Nature turns to dust

The tables are turned
Nature dies
The sun burns red
And the time is short
The air's polluted
Wasted seas
No one is afraid
And what about you?

The earth's exploited by bigwigs
Fat and ugly, look like pigs
Blood is decorating their hands
Dust - heap grows - wasted lands

Scaring down the winds
The winds of sacrifice
Nature turns to dust
