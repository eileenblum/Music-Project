Many people 're trying to forget
Too much pain is in the world
Many people don't need to regret
See their eyes are turned away

[Bridge:]
Lies, disease, sorrow
Get it all away
War, rage
Get it all away
Jumping to the beat
Kicking with your feet - get away

[Chorus:]
Are you living, are you dying?
Nobodie's crying
Feeling so confused
To turn your heart away - to stay

You'll think your life has just begun
But it's ending here and now
It doesn't matter if you're alive
Or dead
Time is running on and on

[Bridge:]
Lies, disease, sorrow
Get it all away
War, rage
Get it all away
Jumping to the beat
Kicking with your feet - get away

[Chorus]
