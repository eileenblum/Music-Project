Behold the Lion of Judah
Who came first as a child
Living in the rotten slums
1984
Murdered by society
Killing technowar
But now he comes as king of kings
To rule in glory
Behold the lion of Judah!

What have I done, oh Lord
To have to go through so much pain?
But I think by now
It's worth to try it again
Murdered by society
Killing technowar
But now he comes as king of kings
To rule in glory
Behold the lion of Judah!
Come on

[Chorus:]
The world is dying now
Time is coming nearer now
The world is dying now
Time is coming
Nearer
