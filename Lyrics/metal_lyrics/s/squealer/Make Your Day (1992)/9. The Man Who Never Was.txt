1941
The world lies down in ruins
The dogs of war are mad
Suppress the weak and sad
Their last chance was the bomb
They need someone to spy
Fascism rules the nation
The Wehrmacht fights for glory

Money can't buy friend
Can't buy friends
You know
Money can't buy...

I'm the man who never was
I'm the man, they blot out the past

The man who never was
Isn't mentioned in books
They blot out his past
His wife and friends at last
" The warhead brings the triumph "
The german leaders said
Fascism rules the nation
The Wehrmacht fights for glory

Money can't buy friend
Can't buy friends
You know
Money can't buy...

I'm the man who never was
I'm the man, they blot out the past
