Walking on sand in the valley of the dead and i feel their souls creeping inside me
I roam in the valley of the ancient gods searching for the secrets of life

In the valley of the sandwalkers the secrets of this life are buried with the dead
In the valley of the sandwalkers the hopeless society lives and ruin

The blind can see in his dreams and we are blessed by the knowledge
The blind can see in his dreams and they are cursed by the ignorance
The blind can see in his dreams and we are cursed by the knowledge
The blind can see in his dreams and they are blessed by the ignorance

All the secrets are buried in sand
