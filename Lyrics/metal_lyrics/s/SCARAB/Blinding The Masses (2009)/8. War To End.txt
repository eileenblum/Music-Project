Here comes the meaning of your destiny, this is the outcome of what you are
Soul destroying obsolete philosophies leading to the curse of martyrdom
Pathetic empathy in me confusing my real desire
Trapped inside a circle of fire searching for utopia in hell
Sordidly I lose my sympathy, soothingly embracing my serenity
Seized by the fact of evolution, releasing fears from memories
The illusion of power will bow to the face of death ending this phase for a new beginning
Homage to the war of all wars releasing our souls to eternity
From within I see with the eye of the past and the future
There's no more fear inside, I believe in death to be immortality
War to end all the filth of human deeds
War to end all the destructive creations
War to end all the failures of our generations
War to end everything
Nothing will remain
The resistance of change will give you annihilation
Nothing competes with the nature of life for painful death is the destiny for all those rejecting reality
The feeble way of reasons will be buried by time
Endlessly all will vanish to be a part of history
War to end all the filth of human deeds
War to end all the destructive creations
War to end all the failures of our generations
War to end everything
Who thinks deep inside for enlightenment shall receive the gift of infinite perfection
We're slaves of time in this planet earth; death is the path to immortality

War to end, war to heal, war to send us back before we were born
born
