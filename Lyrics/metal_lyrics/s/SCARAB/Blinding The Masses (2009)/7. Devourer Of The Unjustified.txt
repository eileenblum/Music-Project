The day when souls fade away Taken to the other dimension
The Beasts await the
unjustified Eager and hungry for torturing
those who follow the rules are
blessed forever and those who wont shall suffer for eternity
it's all up to
you now you are the one who builds his own heaven or hell

The Devourer Of
The Unjustified Souls
The Devourer Of The Unjustified Souls

Hypnotized and
controlled minds living their lives based on delusions
Deprived of their own
nature
Sickness arises, pain embraces their souls

You are the paranoia of
left and right path
The pessimistic hope
Egoistic morbid visions

I Embrace
the light of the infinite sight 
where there's no difference no left and right

accepting everything as a part of the Divine
