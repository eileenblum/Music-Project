The leaders of agony dominated your life
Your delusions your simple minds decorating the lies
In fear you live
In weakness you're dying
You think you're liberated but the fact is you're just a worthless slave

For what?
You obey without gaining anything but your agony

The leaders of agony brain washed you
You blind sheep read between the lines
What's the purpose of the dominion?
The fact is we're all one; we're all the same
Who made the differences is a sadist bastard who Wants to rule over your mind

For what?
You build everything in his name and you bury your name

Subversion

Set me free you leader of agony
I'm the one who built your kingdom of lies
I'm the one who suffered instead of you
I'm the one who created you for nothing but agony

You sadist bastard set me free

So you promised me that fair is what you'll be
Liar
So you promised me that you'll give as you took from me
Liar
You're a sly king sitting on your throne pretending he's fair
And I'm the one who created you for nothing but agony
