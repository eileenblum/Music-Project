How could you believe what they say when your whole world is built upon deceit?
The myth is real and the fact is fake? 
Is this your meaning of being sane?
Youâre a typical fool
Eye for sanity
the eraser of insanity
you will suffer no more from the plague of confusion
Follow their lead destroying the eye for sanity
destroying the truth and the only truth
Killing the revolution
giving birth to your confusion
feeding the beast for a new chapter of endless insanity
As I know that the truth exist within
within your mind within your soul
but in the shape of madness, sanity is sold
choices are made but the core still remains
The world gone mad
seeing and believing is not the question
just a story to be told for all generations balancing two equal contradictions...
the good and the evil
How could you believe what they say when your whole world is built upon deceit?
The myth is real and the fact is fake? 
Is this your meaning of being sane?
Youâre a typical fool
Living in misery
corruption
war
hate
greed
painful visions
all in one destroying the eye for sanity
Living in phobia
illusions
psychosomatic thoughts
in fear of death
all in one destroying the eye for sanity
They are killing the eye of sanity
they are giving you madness and insanity
But if you want perfection you need to balance the equal contradictions
stay in the core for everything around you is life and the truth exists within
The eye of sanity is the core
the eye of sanity is everything within your mind and your soul
follow my lead I'll give you an eye for sanity for I'm the truth and the only truth
I'm each and everything within your mind and your soul
I'm the cure the healer of your insanity
