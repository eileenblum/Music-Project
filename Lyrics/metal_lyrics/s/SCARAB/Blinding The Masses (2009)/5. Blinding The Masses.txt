Walking in shadows of fear
Creating realities
Things they don't want us to hear
Truth be untold

Ancient times are the stories of authorities
Repeating the circle of the same story...
Blinding the Masses

Blinding the masses
Blinding the masses
Making you fear the scepter showing you nothing but Your weakness

Exploited minds chaotic lives all gathered in one point
How could they help the other when they can't help themselves?
Liberation is the perfect lie they tied us in long chains

Blinding the masses
Blinding the masses
Making you fear the scepter showing you nothing but your weakness

Weakness

What you hear
What you see
What you feel
What you believe
What you breath and swallow
Lies and corruption

What you say
How you appear
What you give
What you preach
What you spit of your mouth
Nothing but ignorance

Wake up now and face the massacre or run away and hide in a place where you can find your need
But if you want to stay then subversion is the only solution for your evolution
Open your eyes and see how they keep on manipulating you

Weakness in your lifeless soul there's nothing you can do
You obey the rules stand back and watch them all manipulating you

weakness in your lifeless mind how can you live and take it when all they do is blinding you?

Blinding the masses
Blinding the masses
Making you fear the scepter showing you nothing but your weakness

Blinding the masses

Open your eyes and see is there a difference between you and me?
They feed us disease and still we starve and swallow
The face of destruction is growing time is the key and you will realize that in the void of death nothing will stand tall forever
