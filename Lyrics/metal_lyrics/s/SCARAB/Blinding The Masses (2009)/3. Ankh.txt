the key of life will open the gates and no one shall ever stop me
I'll have
all the pleasures of this life
ANKH

all the walls through my destiny
all
the suffocating of the hate
all the pain in this dreadful life
all the animal
instinct inside of us
all the walls of flames in front of me will never
prevent my deeds of becoming true

i will hold the key of life
i will never
sacrifice
i will dig my own ways
i will control the days
i will reach my own
perfection
i will enlighten the dark

when the blind hated me
for he can't
really see me
enduring all this blind hate
from inside i suffocate
but i
know the key of life
i know the key of...
LIFE

ANKH
ANKH

all the
sanctimonious lies
all the agony of slavery
all this prisons locking me
all
this hate suffocating me
by the key in my head i will unlock the gates of
heaven on earth
