From this hatred generating within me
I capture thee slit your eyes
So you can no longer see
Moments of clarity
Moments of disease

Condemned words leading to endless designs of death conspired with lies
A new beginning of ending existence
Fear, so long...
Signs written on walls in the valley of the kings
Your dreams abide the way
The lucifer's way
Say no more
Your words are meaningless

I can see, i can see
Visions of misdeed
A moment in rapture
Pleading away for my capture

I can see, i can see
Visions of misdeed
A moment in rapture
Pleading away for my capture

When your time comes
I'll stand tall looking at you
On your shivering soul and your painful end
I'll leave you helpless or show you pity?
Just as you give so you will take
Just as you give so you will take
Just as you give so you will take
Just as you give so you will take

All those who stood beside you
Will leave your body to rot and they will all fight for your same cheap destiny

Wrapped in disfigurement
No one can see the real you
Wrapped in disfigurement
But who's the one to blame?

The more i see the more i'm closer to madness
I'm wrapped in disfigurement

When your time comes i'll stand tall looking at you
On your shivering soul and your painful end
I'll leave you helpless or show you pity?
Just as you give so you will take
Just as you give so you will take

I'm wrapped in disfigurement
I'm wrapped in disfigurement

No more shall i live on your wicked rules
I'll never walk and follow your footsteps
I create my own line and frame
And when i'm gone i'll be dead, light from within

No more shall i live on your wicked rules
I'll never walk and follow your footsteps
I created my own line and frame
And when i'm gone i'll be dead
Wrapped in disfigurement
