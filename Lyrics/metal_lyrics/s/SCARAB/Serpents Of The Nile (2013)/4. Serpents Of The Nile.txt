An eye from within protecting me
A snake in a circle shape around my decisions
Signs I meet through my destiny showing me the way and the true path
Opening my vision to intuition, I see the absolute

Bring in me the wisdom from high above; bring in me the strength from down below
Bring in me the gift of wise choice for choosing is how we create

Serpents of the Nile arise and protect me from those who envy me and feed on the soul
Serpents of the Nile by the infinite's will I command you to rise and take on your role

A phoenix of rebirth flying in circles around my face
A gift of seeing things as they really are
An offering from the absolute giving me the power of magick in my prayers
So I can transform myself and all around me

Bringing me the wisdom from high above, bringing me the strength from down below
Bringing me the gift of wise choice for choosing is how we create

I opened up my mind, expanding it 
I wished and I received what I asked for
And then I realized that you exist within me and all around me
You are everything and I'm just part of you

A prayer asking for the lethal serpents to protect (me) and slay the unwanted within and all around me
A prayer asking for the infinite sight and intuition so I can sense and know the circumstances of my choices

Bring in me the wisdom from high above, so I can fix and heal what's down below
Bring in me the gift of wise choice for choosing is how we create

Serpents of the Nile arise and protect me from those who envy me and feed on the soul
Serpents of the Nile by the infinite's will I command you to rise and take on your role.
