Youâre the end [x3]

Everyday
I try to get why Iâm here
I guess itâs trapped 
But my eyes want me dead
I just know
You are the end

Everyday
I try to get why Iâm here
I guess itâs trapped 
But my eyes want me dead
I just know
You are the end

And I
I want you to know that it never will go
And if you somehow know
Please tell me now
Oh I love you so
