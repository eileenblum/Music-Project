Iâm marching into a dream
A stargaze of what it should be
But you are my only shutdown
To bridge our gap

Itâs like a stare
Cause you are miles away [x5]

You need to bridge our gap
To get us back
Iâm stargazing you
I know weâre close
But a million miles away
Itâs hard to say

Iâm marching into a dream
A stargaze of what it should be
But you are my only shutdown
To bridge our gap

Iâve got the way [x4]
