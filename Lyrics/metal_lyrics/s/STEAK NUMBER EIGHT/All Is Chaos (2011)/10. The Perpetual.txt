I was drowning
You raise me high
You carry me still

The past never ends
Because the future
Shows me how 
It should have been

Trust in my mind
You show me your way
Trust in my mind
You show me the way to go
The past never ends

Trust in my mind [x4]
Trust in my sight [x4]

You still carry me for the past never ends [x4]

The past never ends [x2]
