I am a pyromaniac
Iâm going to burn you down
Is it your mama, is it your sister
Is it your doggy, is it your daddy
Is it your backyard, is it your house
Is it - I donât care
Iâm going to burn it down
âCause Iâm a pyromaniac
Iâm going to burn you down

Fuel is running through my veins
And I will burn you straight to hell
I am some kind of mad
I am some kind of sick
Do you need someone
Well I am going to burn you down
âCause Iâm a pyromaniac
Iâm going to burn you down

I am a pyromaniac
Iâm going to burn you down
