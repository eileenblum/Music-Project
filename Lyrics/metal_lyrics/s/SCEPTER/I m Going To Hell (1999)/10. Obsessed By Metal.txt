Black eyes stare at the sun
Burning wheel in the sky
Frozen hearts turn to fire
(As) sunset bleeds into night
Energy bolts for power and spell
Are harnessed from death and despair
Unleash the fucking slayer

Never lost never drawn
Never to be guiled
Harder than tempered steel
Born to lose live to win
Fuck'em till you die
Your only thought is too kill
When you're obsessed by metal

Slave and master side by side
Or one beneath the other
Only one of them can have the power
Whether by the demons
Or of the burning sword
They say the same get on your knees
And suck your fucking lord

Obsessed by metal
Obsessed by death
Obsessed by black desire
Obsessed by power beyond my control
Obsessed by fucking fire
Obsessed by fury
Obsessed by hatred
Obsessed by vengeance and lust
Fuck off and die cause we gotta live
We are obsessed by metal
