On the morn of the crescent moon
I had a dream that would spell your doom
One from three and it's just as well
I'm gonna tell you about my deathspell

One from three for three from one
I pray you never see tomorrow's sun
I gotta say that I wish you hell
It's time to cast my fucking deathspell

To keep a secret it must not be told
But even secrets can be bought or sold
So if you tell about my deathspell
I'll take your life and see you in hell
