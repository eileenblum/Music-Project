Diana rises in the sky
Her sun illuminates the night
Foul deeds are afoot
Under middle-eastern moonlight

Who could say you never know
Speak the truth or call it lies
One mistake will take your freedom
One mistake your life

Mummified speech
Dreams beyond reach
Day of Atonement
We are your judgment

So unleash the devil
For six thousand years of respite
Together we will crush one million
Brothers of our flesh unite
