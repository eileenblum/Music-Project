I sodomized and angel of the lord
I dragged his mangled cropse back to my horde
And together on it we spilled our seed
Have you ever seen an angel bleed

We fucked the corpse until we had our fill
Then we drank from his decapitated skull
I adorn myself with the bloodied wings
Unseen host of seraphim sing

Suffer the same fate of he whose heard filled with pride
Never forget you came from me and his side
Eyes of the watcher have already seen your demise
Hear the sodomizer's cries
