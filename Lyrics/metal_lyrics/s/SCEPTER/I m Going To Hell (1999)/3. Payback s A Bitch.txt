You try so hard to convince us you are true
Well let me tell you we are looking right through you
Everything you say you hate is what you are
Popularity and lies will take you far

Buying bullet belts and bootleg Sodom shirts
Confirms you seek approval but it don't prove your worth
Only you can tell what your have got inside
You can run from us but from yourself you can't hide

You've given us all the ammo that we need
When you whore the past you make my heart bleed
Don't blame me when you don't get what you wish
Cause when it all blows up you'll realize
Payback's a bitch
