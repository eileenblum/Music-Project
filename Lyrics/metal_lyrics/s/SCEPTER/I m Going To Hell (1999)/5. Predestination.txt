You lived your life out before you were born
You wear the should the fates have weaved
Play you part as the tragedy begins
Your own will you can't conceive

If it was told you by the gods above
Would you take it as deceit
You might as well just be damned in hell
By another's beliefs

Break the holy vessels
Deny the prophecy
Fire chaos and the legions of destroyer
Will bring you to your knees

As they languish in their rivers of blood
With poisoned breathe they despise
See the death within their eyes
As wormwood strikes

There is nothing that's beyond your control
You won't let yourself believe
Say farewell to your heirs
As we march into destiny
