Black ice in my veins
Cold steel darkness awaits
I hear them call my name
Though they remain unseen

I cry out to a starless sky
I breathe in the decay of night
To the wind I cast the fate of my soul
If nothing else
They'll take me in the fires below

Ill reflection of self-destruction enticing me
Nothing more for me to say
Nothing left for me to feel
Drawn into the circle of death
No regrets as I raise the knife
All for nothing save eternity
I give myself unto suicide
