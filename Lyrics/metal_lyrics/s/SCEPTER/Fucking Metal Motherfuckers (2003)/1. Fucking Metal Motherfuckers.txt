We are the sons of the all-seeing eye
We got our backs to the wall
We live to conquer and divide
None too weak to stand a fall

Fucking Metal Motherfuckers
We're on the move tonight
Our women our fine and our leather is clean
Everything's all right

Comprehend what we all know
You must step out of your mind
Break the hold of humanity's grip
And transcend all mankind

Fucking Metal Motherfuckers
Pledge allegiance to yourself
Condemn the souls of those who won't
And send them straight to hell

The life I live which I lead
Is drunk and stoned and high
And that's the way it's gonna be
Until the day I die

Fucking Metal Motherfuckers
Set fire to the sky
Burn it's way into our hearts
And never let it die
