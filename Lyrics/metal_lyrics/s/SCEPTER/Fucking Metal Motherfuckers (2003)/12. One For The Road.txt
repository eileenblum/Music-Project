Itâs nine oâclock and Iâm already rocked
Itâs got another half pint to go
Then itâs right back to the liquor store
Cause you know I gotta get some more

I take the wheel and I burn and peel
Iâm on the fast track straight to hell
I drink and drive but I always survive
I leave the consequence for someone else

You donât know what I feel
When it all comes down to me
Life sucks and Iâm totally fucked
So I do what the fuck I please
No hope for a brighter tomorrow
So Iâm gonna live it up today
I got it all within my sights
Then I blow it all away

I sniff my finger to remember your face
I got the smell of pussy on my breath
Another dawn and Iâm already gone
And Iâm a DUI away from death
