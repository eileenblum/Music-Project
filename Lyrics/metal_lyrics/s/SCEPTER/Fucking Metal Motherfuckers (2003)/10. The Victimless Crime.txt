Drowning in the fecal ocean of genetic waste
Decimate the dignity of the human race
Ignorance violence selfishness and greed
Thatâs the corpse from which the maggots reproduce and feed

Weâre at war
Filthy whore
Mindless beast
Rife with disease

The seed of desolation sown by generations past
Itâs time for us it make this one the last
Suffocate mutilate rip it open wide
By this sacrifice all life is sanctified

Weâre at war
Rape the whore
Savage beast
Hell unleashed
Womb is scraped
Seal your fate
The blood will flow
From someone that you will new know

Life is not a right it is a choice thatâ the preordained
If we let the bastard live then everyone will pay
Terminate the pregnancy the suffering the pain
Whoâs the victim whatâs the crime nothing left to say

Weâre at war
Spay the whore
Geld the beast
Abort the fetus
Expatriate
Eradicate
Exterminate
Annihilate
And deal death til there is none left
