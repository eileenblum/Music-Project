Do Unto Others As You Wanna Do Unto Them

If you believe in the golden rule then you're a fool
Cause they're dying just to stab you in the back
To turn the other cheek is for the weak
I prefer to go on the attack

Do unto them
Before they can do unto you
Don't wait for revenge
And piss on their grave when you're...

Through it all you've seen the lies within their eyes
But they will just deny it all the same
If you fall for it twice you'll pay their fucking price
And there will be no one else for you to blame

Do unto them
Before they can do unto you
Don't wait for revenge
And piss on their graves when you're through
