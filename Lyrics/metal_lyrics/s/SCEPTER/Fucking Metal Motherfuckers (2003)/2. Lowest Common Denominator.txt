Night falls and I hit the street
A fire in my hand
I'm on ten and I get my kicks from
Whatever I can find

I see you
You see me
I see the hate in your eyes
Cause I know
That I'm everything
That you despise
Fuck you
You wanna go?
I'm ready to fight
I'm who I am
And I'm in your face
I got nuthin' to hide

I down a shot and a bottle of beer
Then I go for more
I get paid and I spend my money
On affection from a whore

I raise a glass
I toast death
Cause I'm taking the fall
Gonna get everything I need
All it cost me was my soul
Too much is never enough
I take it to the limit
Cause you know I gotta have it all

All done I take my cue
And then I clear the floor
Won't find me when you come around
Cause I'm already out the door
