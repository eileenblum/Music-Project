A knock on the door in the middle of the night
No one in sight
Open up your home to take a look
Thatâs when we strike

We force our way into your home
We donât have to ask
If you protest and try to fight
We will soon take you to task
With a pistol-whip and our raping ways
We are sure to take command
When youâre on your knees with a gun in your mouth
You begin to understand

Home invasion the final disgrace
The desecration of you sacred place
The defilement of all that you hold dear
So you can live out the rest of your days in fear
They say a manâs home is his castle
Iâm not saying they lied
Possessions can always be replaced
But not your fucking pride

Home invasion the ultimate cost
The victims are the ones who survive
Destroying all trust and faith in mankind
Scarred for the rest of your life
