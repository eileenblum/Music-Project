Scarred torn and tattered
As if it fucking mattered
Spectres move as shadows
Across your window pane

Smoking burning holes
Burned into your brain
Creeping sloughing disease
Pouring down the drain
Slit your fucking wrists
And suck your tainted blood
You wouldnât stop it if you could

Melted eyes can see the stars
Even beyond night
Into the blackest void
Extinguishing all light

The hand that moves the sun
Can cover all the sky
Some will never see
The glory until they die
