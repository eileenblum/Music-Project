Guilty of a crime I could not help but commit
You must do with me what you see fit
Charged with lust all that I can say in my defense
I meant only pleasure no offense

Brought before a jury that is made up of my peers
Presented with the evidence the truth will be made clear

A girl whose only aspiration is to be a whore
(Is) fine by me who could ask for more

Fifteen
Sixteen
Seventeen is fine
One day she'll be 21 somewhere down the line

The jury's out the sentence passed
I'm guilty of being a man
Extenuating circumstance you hold back all you can
Self-incriminated by supposed words of a child
Let her testimony stand
One lick drover her fucking wild

Something's got to give
