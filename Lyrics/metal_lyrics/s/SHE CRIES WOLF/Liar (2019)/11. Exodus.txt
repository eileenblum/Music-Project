I'll cut them all off
(I'll cut them all off)
I will cut everyone out
(I will cut everyone out)

There'll be nothing left but me, and I'll breathe and I'll breathe great sighs of relief
I'll see what it is like to be free
I'll sink into myself and make a world of my own
I'll make my own god, my laws and my own code

They can't hurt me anymore, not him, not her
I just won't feel a thing; I just won't let them in
I can do this alone, I wasn't born with them and I won't die with them

I've lived alone, so I can die without them
They don't choose to see the world as I do

I've live alone, so I can die without them
They don't see the colours the way I do
Just close your eyes and I'll be gone in an instant
Just close your eyes

Just close your eyes
