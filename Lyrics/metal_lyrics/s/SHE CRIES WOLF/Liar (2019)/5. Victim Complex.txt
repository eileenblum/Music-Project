Audaciously a culprit of self-victimisation, I despise every word that comes out of your mouth
Every sentence to be made up from your questionable self-righteous thought process

Quick to disagree to the theories of your delusional agenda
It makes it so much clearer to see, why you left and why you would flee
One to speak about defilement, yet you're the one with the forked tongue and everyone fucking knows it
It makes it so much clearer to me

Defamation to the tee, you raped me of integrity
Defamation to a tee, you raped me of integrity

Mind at ease, this may seem unsettling but I enjoy the thought of your writhed vocal cavity
Mind at ease, mind at ease, I enjoy the thought of your writhed vocal cavity

Quick to disagree to the theories of your delusional agenda
It makes it so much clearer to me
I don't wish to hear your Cheyne stokes
I just want you to understand
Feel as the real victims choke

Fuck you
