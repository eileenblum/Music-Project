Seroquel dreams, waking up high, completely eclipsed, psychotic, manic, helpless, paranoid, deluded episode, feeling helpless, feeling selfless
No one else knows where I've been but me, I've lost my sanity

My enemy stares back at me in mirrors
So lie to me, tell myself it's worth this pain

Luke, wake up

They said don't show anyone, but I'm showing everyone
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Stopped listening to what people say and started watching what they do
'cause people rarely do what they say, it's true
Liar, liar, liar, liar

Liar

My enemy stares back at me in mirrors
So lie to me, tell myself it's worth this pain

The person within me is trapped in a cell, kept talking in riddles I sent him to hell.
