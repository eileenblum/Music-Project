I felt her loss pass through me, the pain of his suffering soon followed
With a whisper in my ear, to the promise I had made to him
Now cemented in his headstone

So cold, so lonely

Not strong enough to brave this world, but strong enough to brave the next one
I can see it clear as day as if I was there
I can feel the fog and the darkness as it envelops his mind
What did he drink to give him the courage? What poison made it easier for such emptiness to flourish?

Oh God, he never felt more alone

One godless night, as his body jerks and twitches
A curious morning, as she speaks of white witches
They laughed so loud, it didn't seem quite right
How could they laugh? It was only last night
Only last night that he gave up his life

I felt her loss pass right through me, the pain of his suffering soon followed
(I felt loss pass right through me, pain and suffering)
I will take care of her, I promise, I promise you
(With a whisper, I made to him, on his headstone)
