Look down in doubt at the angel in your arms
He says, "She's got a mouth to breathe and two eyes to see, if there's no heaven for you there's no heaven for me."

There's no heaven for me

At some point I forgot
At some point I forgot it's not about right and wrong but life and death

I can hold this grudge longer than you can live without love
I'll bury us deep within a tomb of broken trust

I can't wait until the depression comes back, at least then I won't have to feel anything
I can't wait until the anxiety comes back, at least then I'll get to feel something again
I can't wait until depression comes back, at least then I won't feel anything
I can't wait until anxiety comes back, at least then I will feel something again

When I point my finger, I'm aware of the three pointing back at me
That's why I always find meaning in tragedy
I'm not as smart as I used to be, or maybe I've realised I was never that smart at all

It's so easy to ignore all that's pure when we crave darkness
It's so hard to resist the darkness when we try to do good

If there's no heaven for you, there's no heaven for me

Fear is trading love for meaningless sex
