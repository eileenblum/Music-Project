Deconstructed by everyone, everywhere, everyone wondering what I'm thinking
Reconstructed, revolted by everyone wanting to know if I care

I've been scared to pretend that I'm not giving up
I don't care if we all disappear in the flood

Deconstructed by everyone, everywhere, wondering what I'm thinking
Revolted by everyone wanting to know if I care

I've been scared to pretend that I'm not giving up
I don't care if we all disappear in the flood

Repent. Rebuild. Regret. Conceal.

I've been scared to pretend that I'm not giving up
(No, I'm not giving up)
I don't care if we all disappear in the flood
(No, I'm not giving up)
