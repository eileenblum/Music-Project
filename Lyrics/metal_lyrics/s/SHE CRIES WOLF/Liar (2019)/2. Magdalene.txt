I exorcise my demons in a pool of wine
Pool of wine
That gentle pool of wine

Love letters written on her wrists, drawing a straight line from me to
him
She writes her music to relate, sometimes escape from the mental grasp and
the anguish in its wake
Life has never been easy, so she's calloused and hard

Depression romanticises itself like a lover, never a friend
Or maybe I have stared too long at grey clouds and provided it comfort

Please never forgive me, I am lost and only you can see
Please never forgive me; I am lost and far from holy

You died that night in my arms
Your body pale and weak
Headlights shine on your depression
You didn't do this for attention
