Anchor your lips, the words you emit
Courage dribbles into spit
Pour out your hate, mix it with guilt
Feed the hungry ashes that you built
I didn't know a thing outside of you
Led through your house as a fucking guest
Carry your name, bring up the politics
Make them think it's me who's sick

Brought up in imperfection, striving for perfection
Teacher of life, healer of pain
Brought up in imperfection, striving for perfection
Brought up in imperfection, dealer of pain
Known to a few, could barely stand on two
Showed me your empire deep underground
Claws in my arms, wretched filth burn my name
Only taught on how to hate myself

You could not have been further from the point
Of being a lover, a teacher, a mother
I hope you know I've always hated you
You're the one who's sick and I'm clean now

Promised it all, but you lied
Provoking assisted suicide
Kiss my cheek goodnight
Queen of suffering, queen of suffering

Brought up in imperfection
Teacher of, healer of pain

And after all that you've put me through
Drowning you seems far too sane
I would have built the largest pyre
Cast you in the centre fire

It wouldn't end, no not that quick for you
I'd make fucking sure of that
I would snare, like you did to me
You fucking liar, liar, liar

Brought up in imperfection, striving for perfection
Brought up in imperfection,
Teacher of, healer of

Pain

The devil called you out, plead you had no way out
Give me love and I swear that I'll behave, I'll behave

And I'll forever wear your face
Let them know it's you who's sick
Plead your case, make it quick
Locked by blood, set me fucking free
