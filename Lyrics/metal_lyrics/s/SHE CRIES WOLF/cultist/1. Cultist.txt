You picked the bottle, you picked the needle, the sexual release.
Over me, over him, over us, over everybody.
Everybody.

Your selfishness has brought you here.
A scrambled mess, withered and broken by your choices.
Hearing voices.

Don't try and blame it on your past.
You should have put it behind you.
You let it define you.
You're dead.

You're dead to me.
You were barely alive.
You're dead to me.
You were barely alive.

I've heard it all before.
Stop scaring others with your lies.
I'm the fly on the wall.
Victim.

White lines of separation, separate my thoughts.
White lines of separation, have set us apart.

You make me fucking sick.
