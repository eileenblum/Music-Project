Iâve been given the voice of a thousand dying souls of a nation crying out to a helpless world.
Even though they want to die.
All I do is cry.

Iâve been given the voice of a sacred union, a voice to tell you how it is.
And if this world just donât make sense, then it makes no sense.
Letâs not complicate it with words.

Welcome to my life of illusion.
Welcome to my world of tears.
Iâm an act without a conclusion.
Iâm a world without an end.

Good night, goodnight.

Welcome to my heart of confusion.
An arrow without a cupid.
That cupid burns from the grave.
A soul heâll never save.

Iâm an act without a conclusion.
Iâm a means without an end.

If this soul could find a haven, it would rest with the dead.
