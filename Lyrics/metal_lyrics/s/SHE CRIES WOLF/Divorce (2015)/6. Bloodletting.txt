You've got me right where you want me.
I bet I know where you've been hiding, I bet I know why you're there.
In every way I know we will never be, I gave you so much more, I give you so much more.

And every day I stay unspoken, in need.
In every way you punish me.
I won't be lead astray.
I won't be scared to death by everything.

I burnt myself for the sake of your love. A moth to an unforgiving flame.

Beneath the charred veil, a darker truth remains.
Thereâs nothing left for me.

Count out the sins, bleed out your love.

A darker truth remains.
Thereâs nothing left for me.
