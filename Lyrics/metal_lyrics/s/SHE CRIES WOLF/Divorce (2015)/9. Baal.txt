Baal screams, and he starts to believe, "you better fire and run, you better fire that gun".
Drowns out sound, with a voiceless round. You have to fight to live, you have to fight.
Fire that gun and then you say the words âRest in peaceâ, but rest in peace means restless sleeps.
Please, turn and run. If he dies, funerals tie.
Voices unheard, they kindly say, âHe doesnât have to die, please listen to meâ.

âPut down your rifle, run for your life.â
Run.

The darker crimes of day, at night they fade away.
As I stand in light the truth will surely shine.

âBaal.â
And all the angels cry.
âBaal.â
In fear, they stay.
âBaal.â
And his subconscious screams
âBaal.â
Please let me go.
âBaal.â
Please let me leave.
