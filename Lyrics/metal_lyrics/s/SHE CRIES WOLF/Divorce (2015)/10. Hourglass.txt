You told me you loved me, you told me you need me. (You lied).
You told me I was your everything.
She told me she loved me, she told me she needs me. (She lied).
She told me I was her everything.

Fear my return from the grave that you once called your home.
Fear my return from the grave where you once rested your heart.

Biding my time on a bed of nails.
Watching you live, watching you leave. (Leave me).
Sand falls in a glass cage of guilt.
Life goes on and so we move on - or so it seems.
Iâm tearing seams.

Now tell me you love me, now tell me you need me.
Now tell me I am your everything.
Tell me you love me, tell me you need me.
Tell me I am your everything.
Tell me, tell me.
Now tell me you love me, tell me you need me.
Now tell me I am your everything.
