Welcome to the forefront of our minds, we hope you find what you crave.

Biting our blunt nails. We've been slowly scratching away at your walls, you're no longer safe.

We are your bastard sons.
We are the ones that you love.
Tear away at my skin.
Place yourself in me and see yourself in me.

Your circle is now square and we will watch it close on you.

We've been slowly scratching away at your walls, you're no longer safe.

We are your bastard sons.
We are the ones that you love.
Tear away at my skin.
Place yourself in me and see yourself in me.
