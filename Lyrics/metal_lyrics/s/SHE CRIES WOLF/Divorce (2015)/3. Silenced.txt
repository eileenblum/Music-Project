Coffin fodder like a bastard son.
Like your bastard son.

I rebuild the bridges leading you to where youâve been.
Youâve broken every life youâve touched since you were seventeen.
You are the hunter, victims lay at your feet.
Theyâre paralysed, the end is near.

Re-walk the steps of hatred.
You cannot escape the nightâs dark melody.

Every step is a mistake.
Every breath is letting go.
This time Iâll say nothing.
This time Iâll let silence speak.

â¦

Your legs grow weak as you carry the guilt.
Weed out the pain that once made you real.
Dig up your son, your former life.
The only connection to your former wife.
She isnât dead, nor a burden, a curse or a sin.
Embrace these cold truths - that your father is dead and his father did nothing.

Iâm sorry dear friend, I am opening up.
No longer silent, silence did nothing.

Iâm your only friend.
Please listen to me.
Life is not a monologue.

You are wrong.
