Forget her face, forget her name. (forget).
Forget.
Forget her face, forget her name.

Two lives met at the edge of the road.
Both given only one way to go. (west).

I killed her, I killed her.
Gave into destiny.
I killed her, I killed her.
A distant memory.
I killed her, I killed her.
My confessionâs heard tonight.
I killed her, I killed her.
Secrets within her eyes.

A daughterâs face resembles the bearerâs end.
An unmarked grave will unlock secrets of my kin.
The enemy is buried deep within.
Listen now closely to the words repeating.

Forget her face, forget her name.
Forget her face, forget her name. (forget)

I killed her, I killed her.
Gave into destiny.
I killed her, I killed her.
A distant memory.
I killed her, I killed her.
My confessionâs heard tonight.
I killed her, I killed her.
Secrets within her eyes.

I killed her, I killed her.
