Wake up, wake up.
Boy youâve been sleeping for far too long.
Wake up, wake up.
Girl youâve been sleeping for far too long.

Your beds tell stories of misery.
Blood-lined sheets cover innocence begotten.
Birthing pain and distrust with every thrust.
Lust breaks the boundaries of endlessness.

Shake these dreams from your head.
Theyâre nothing but nightmares in the light of the sun.
Shake these dreams from your head.
Theyâre nothing but nightmares in the light of the sun.

Wake up, wake up , wake up , wake up.

Sex leaves bruises and love leaves scars.

Wake up, wake up.
Weâve all been sleeping for far too long.
Wake up, wake up.
Weâve all been dreaming for far too long.

We sleep in cemeteries and wake at the foot of your dreams.
