I feel nothing. I feel nothing anymore.
I feel nothing in my heart.

We walked away.
We watched the sink drain.
You barely knew me, you barely knew yourself.
And with our eyes closed, we watched this ship sail away.
You barely knew me, you barely knew yourself.

I separate, mind from flame.

You put me down on a bed of fire and then read me stories of the end - and that fire made a flood.
I cut you into myself and set you free.
We couldn't have failed, bled on the bathroom floor.
We thought you'd run from the perfect storm.

Yearn, burn, lay down on your bed.
You won't find me tempted again.

We walked away.
We watched the sink drain.
You barely knew me, you barely knew yourself.
And with our eyes closed, we watched this ship sail away.
You barely knew me, you barely knew yourself.

Screaming out at open fixtures.

I found hatred in everything you said and every word you meant.
What was the answer?
Why weren't you what I needed?
As you're an open rose, I am your open thorns.
Give everything to her, give it all back.

As time repays us, we dance on the throne.
As time repays us, we reveal that there's nothing you did, or you've done - to make me this way.
I've always been like this and always will be.
