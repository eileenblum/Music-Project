Divorce.
Letting go of what kept me here.
Divorce.
Shared with you my deepest fears.
Divorce.
Left alone compelled to write.
Divorce.
The following is my last goodbye.

Canât erase my memories.
You werenât in all but you shaped my dreams.
Wasted all on drunken seas.
Iâm looking for a new horizon.

Canât erase my memories. (Lost souls).
You werenât in all but you shaped my dreams. (Lost souls).
Wasted all on drunken seas. (Lost souls).
Iâm looking for something more.

Lost souls.
We are lost souls.

We were picture perfect in an imperfect world.

Canât erase my memories.
You werenât in all but you shaped my dreams.
Wasted all on drunken seas.
Iâm looking for a new horizon.

Canât erase my memories. (Lost souls).
You werenât in all but you shaped my dreams. (Lost souls).
Wasted all on drunken seas. (Lost souls).
Iâm looking for something more.

Lost souls.
We are lost souls.
