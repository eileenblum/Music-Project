Such an empty glass this mortal coil.
Drink red wine to stain your minds and forget all your troubles.
Forget your troubles.

Put me on display before I do it for you and hang myself.

Fell from the same apple tree, my father's clothes look even better on me.
Further out of step barely keeping time, can't cut these family ties.

My life's a blur, I drink to see straight.
Love the ones I love, kill the ones I hate.
Within the blur, paranoia gets the best of me.
Love the ones I love, kill the ones I hate.
Just wait.

The more I think about it, the bigger it grows.
Chemically imbalanced on a mental tightrope.

Within every frame sepia lies on my cluttered mantel.
A water-boarded youth washed away with every bottle.

You wanna know where I've been?
Just follow the broken glass, but try not to cut your feet.

You wanna know where I've been?
Boy, if you wanna come with us you better cut your teeth.
You wanna know where I've been?
Girl, if you wanna come with us bleed out your love and count your sins.

Fell from the same apple tree, my father's clothes look even better on me.
Further out of step barely keeping time, can't cut these family ties.

My life's a blur, I drink to see straight.
Love the ones I love, kill the ones I hate.
Within the blur, paranoia gets the best of me.
Love the ones I love, kill the ones I hate.
Just wait.

Chemically imbalanced on a mental tightrope.

A water-boarded youth washed away with every bottle.
