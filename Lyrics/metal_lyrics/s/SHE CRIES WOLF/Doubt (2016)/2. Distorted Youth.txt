Worship the ground that you'll never walk on, feed all your children with leftover meat.
Blood in my lungs from words left unspoken, forgive not, forget not.

My parents buried my crib, six feat underground,
always taught me to start where I intended to finish.
Finish? I'm just getting fucking started.
There were wolves among sheep sharpening their teeth,
In the twilight and the low light of my youth.

Shake off the dirt and start leading the way,
Shake off the dirt and start bleeding.

We are not the guilty, we are not to blame.
We just chose to guide ourselves, even if that goes against the grain.

I walk as proof, not as a slave.
Cast me your idol stares.
Don't let it hide beneath your face.
Release me from your prayers.
No static, just wade through broken walls.
Cast out your idol's crown.
A white noise in this clearing vision.
Release yourself, release me.
Release me from your prayers.

Distorted youth, unwanted truth.

Shake off the dirt and start leading the way,
Shake off the dirt and start bleeding.

We are not the guilty, we are not to blame.
We just chose to guide ourselves, even if that goes against the grain.

I walk as proof, not as a slave.
Cast me your idol stares.
Don't let it hide beneath your face.
Release me from your prayers.
No static, just wade through broken walls.
Cast out your idol's crown.
A white noise in this clearing vision.
Release yourself, release me.
Release us.

Ripping out the pages, tearing down the walls.
Ripping out the pages, what was black is now white.
No longer static, just one way to be there's no wrong or right.
