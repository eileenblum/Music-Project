Passion bleeds, fashion leads.
No, you can't make smoke without fire.
How do you do what you do? Do what you do without love?

My disease, causes me to treat everyone like a saviour.
Why do you do what you do? Do what you do to me?

You've all been been signalled, everyone is on edge.
But it's all up in the air like your false smoke.
This isn't the first time baby, but it's the last.
There's no one to save you now and maybe there never was.

Let go of the expectations your peers have set in stone.
One less sheep isn't something to mourn for, we all look better in black.

Take tar to your wool.
Give 'em something to talk about.
This is much more than a statement.
This is reality.

Role models made of shit, artists forced to swallow it like poison.

Raised up like golden gods, few will see their careless flaws.
This is a sickness, we are sick.

We are sick.

Role models made of shit, artists forced to swallow it like poison.
It's poison.

I'm sick to death with everything that I see.
Pop up stars considered artists, try to cut them, they won't bleed.

Watered down with no attempt to be clean.
Sitting high on gifted bodies, setting fire to the scene.

Passion's bled for the last time.
