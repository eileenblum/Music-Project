Climb out of your head and give up your expectations.

Climb out of your head and give up your reservations.
We both came here for lust, so let's start the misbehaving.

Let the devil play god, unfold your arms and start the fire.
We're burning down this house, our sweat's fuel, friction's the lighter.

So, burn.
Lights out, let go, let's go.

As our bodies paint the walls in dancing coloured shadows,
Rhythmic motions evoke raw emotions.
Crimson eyes take shallow glances at mirrors,
Our pasts intertwine as the flames start to rise.

It's in this moment that I realise I am the one that is being mislead.
Quickly pinned against the wall with a knife against my throat,
I enfold. We enfold.

We, burn.
Lights out, let go, let's go.

The only thing being taken away is our future, but we never had one anyway.
No, we never had one anyway.

We never had a future anyway.

Climb out of your heads, give into yourselves.
