Standing face-to-face with our new reflections.
It feels like years but it's only been a matter of months.

The odds are stacked against us, the odds are stacked against us.
The odds are stacked against us, but we've got nothing to prove and we've got nothing to lose.

Standing face-to-face with our new reflections.
The odds are stacked against us, the odds are stacked against us.
It feels like years but it's only been a matter of months.
The odds are stacked against us, the odds are stacked against us.

Quiet footsteps, trading places.
We've earned it, you've earned it.
Low risk, no pain, no loss (not).
Not perfect steps, not perfect lies.

I'm not a gambling man.
I'm not a gambler, a gambler.

The odds are stacked against us, the odds are stacked against us.
The odds are stacked against us, but we've got nothing to prove and we've got nothing to lose.

I'm not a gambling man.
I'm not a gambler, a gambler.
