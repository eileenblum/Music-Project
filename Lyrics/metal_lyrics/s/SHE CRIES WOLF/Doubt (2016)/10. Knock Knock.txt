There are angels and demons within every word of every line and every song.
All, including this one.
To understand where they're found isn't truly being found, it's dying.
You're dying.

A beginning of a new end and a new beginning.
Satan's teeth revealed grinning at all of our minimal sin.
He now has the chance to show you where he hides.
The words of man Apollyon has defined.

Show us the way where the winged saints hide, all at the same time.
Where do they hide?
Choose your words wisely, have the last line.
I'm still a lost soul, but with her I am fine.
But with her I am fine.

Judas struggles with Jesus in our minds.
Clarity is so much more than hard to find.

This is the end and the beginning.
