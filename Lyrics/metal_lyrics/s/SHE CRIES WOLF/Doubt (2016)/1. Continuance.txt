We've weathered storms, bricks and mortar couldn't bare.
Found peace within calamities and built homes within despair.

Sometimes it feels like there's little left to hope for in this world.
But the voices inside our heads won't silence long enough to go to sleep.

So, we build our cities, towers higher than the blood red seas.
Build machines that spew black tar, creating highways to maximise our greed.

Out in the blue we've been searching for you, drowning, drowning.
A lifetime of sin has been sunken within, drowning, drowning.

Sometimes it feels like there's little left to hope for in this world.
Day-by-day we chase the spirit that was never here nor found.

In us, nor found, outside of the horizon.
It was never there, you were never there.

Too much time searching ourselves within has left us without.
Palm against palm waiting for an irrational conclusion.

A sense of need ingrained within, gives us the need to search our doubt.
Hope against hope, searching for the most simplest of solutions.

Out in the blue we've been waiting for you, drowning, drowning.
A lifetime of sin has been sunken within, has been sunken with you.

We've weathered storms, bricks and mortar couldn't bare.
Pray for the sunlight, pray for the light.

Out in the blue we've been waiting for you, drowning, drowning.
A lifetime of sin has been sunken within, drowning, drowning.
