If the weight of the world belongs on our shoulders,
What happens when I fall apart?

Once again I am brought here to the point of exhaustion,
Put in front of a blank canvas and forced to bleed.

This is not just a work of art.
These are our memories, this is our history.
We will not die without a mark.
These are our memories, this is our history.

If the weight of the world belongs on our shoulders,
What happens when we fall apart?

I gave it all, seems like it was never enough.
Now watch me bleed out and cease to exist.
I gave it all, seems like it was never enough.
Honest art for the guilty ones.

Revealing weakness with words.
Fighting rationality with a wounded heart.

This is not giving up. This is giving it all.

"Luke, what is Hell like?"

This is not just a work of art.
These are our memories, this is our history.
We will not die without a mark.
These are our memories, this is our history.

This is our history, put in front of a blank canvas and forced to bleed.

I gave it all, seems like it was never enough.
Now watch me bleed out and cease to exist.
I gave it all, seems like it was never enough.
Honest art for the guilty ones.
