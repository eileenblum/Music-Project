You are nothing more than a bottom feeder
The lowest common organism on this rock
Consume your pills and quit wasting my time

you piece of fucking shit
what are you trying to prove
spreading your filthy lies
contamination through this house
infecting the fragile minds
of the upset and weak
these pharmesuticals in which of that you seek

these dirty manmade drugs
the purest form of deadbeat society
and as your veins corrode
and as your blood no longer flows
im happy to say ive seen you fucking change

brainwashing and corrupting the innocent
inducing a euphoric state of mind
the damage thats being done

chew them down snort them down inject them all

you junkie piece of shit

the day that i read your name in the obituaries
will mark my greatest achievement known to date

how can your eyes not see whats fucking happening
these addictions, these liferuiners
potent and full of arsenic
the poison your putting into your useless body
was never intended for human comsumption

your are nothing more then a disgusting bottom feeder
the lowest organism on this putrid rock
the lowest common denominator in my day
consume all your pills and quit wasting my time

ive dug you a
new home three feet wide
a burial place for you
BURY THEM

so let this overdose be the end
i hope to god you fucking die
