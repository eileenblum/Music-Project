Our origins bind us together
And the love we share binds us wherever

The bind which I have held tight to our necks,
I let it slip and watch these worlds collide
The origins of my suicide are as clear as day
I am alpha omega the beggining and the end

Our origins bind us together and the love we share binds us wherever
Our origins metamorphize and they die
And the love we share binds us wherever

The bind which I have held tight to our necks,
I let it slip and watch these worlds collide
The origins of my suicide
Are as clear as day and as dark as night

Breathing disease ; humans are nothing but a
Breathing disease ; humans are nothing but a fucking breathing disease

I am nothing that I cease to be
A nihilist is born inside of me

Our origins disgust me
Our origins destroy us
Our origins fucking destroy us
