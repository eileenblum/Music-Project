[feat. Daniel Sharp]I hear these demons calling my name.
Iâm addicted to this sin.
Take me, this is all I have left.
This is the part where we are all condemned for the choices that weâve made.
An eternity of sin, I am living in.
We are all condemned.
I hear them calling my name.
My vices are holding me.
They are my weakness.
Everything that we believed is dead.
Dead, Iâm dead; weâre all abandoning hope.
Dead, Iâm dead; no-one will save you.
This is sin.
Screaming my name, itâs fucking deafening.
Cast a shadow over the horizon, the last day we waste this life.
Iâm as cold as this breeze has become.
My limbs are numb, my limbs are numb.
Take me away, take me away.
Hear me.
Dead, Iâm dead; weâre all abandoning hope.
Dead Iâm dead; no-one will save you.
This is sin.
Screaming my name, itâs fucking deafening.
Repenting, repenting.
Into the mouth of the demon existing, this is not living.
We are killing everything, everything.
Existence is redefined, our bleak outlook can only break the will of man.
Deconstructed, reassembled, functioning subordinates on command.
Repent, repent, repent.
