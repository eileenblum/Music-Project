Force-fed an idea, of something that Iâve never seen.
Are you a Martyr? The Last thing Iâd fucking be.
Open your eyes and maybe then you will see.
This is something inside of me.
Can you feel your heart beating?
The one thing that keeps me living, I donât believe in anything but me.
I donât need something that isnât there for me.
Donât try to show me the way, Iâll walk alone.
This is not what we wanted, is this what you pray for?
If you were here then you would hear me scream, I donât believe in anything, but me.
I live for myself, my disposition is a failed hope.
If you were here then you would hear me.
Something greater? Then start saving.
Why do we have to see such suffering?
Weâre all falling apart, a life for the hopeful and the hopeless.
Where do you see yourself in history?
Are you waiting for some kind of savior?
The one thing that I wonât believe in.
Iâve been counting these numbers.
One, two, (three) for every time Iâve had to sit here and wonder, how the fuck is this living?
This is all smoke and mirrors, youâre all smoke and mirrors.
I donât need something that isnât there for me, donât try to show me the way.
Iâll walk alone, this is not what we wanted.
Is this what you pray for?
