Haunting me, these four walls Iâm surrounded by are keeping me.
As the air gets thinner and thinner, my lungs ache as I take it in.
I fear this nightmare is taking me as I struggle to see whatâs real.
This is all I have as my life flashes before me.
This could be the end, the end of me.
This is what itâs like to finally see.
Buried alive, buried alive.
Haunting me.
This is all I have as my life flashes before me, this could be the end of me.
This is what itâs like to finally see.
I feel the world spinning inside my head.
Tell me to believe when there is nothing in front of me.
To finally see.
Buried alive, buried alive.
Haunting me.
As life flashes before my eyes.
This is what itâs like to be buried inside me.
Living on borrowed time, I fear the fight is within me.
I donât believe in him, I will never.
