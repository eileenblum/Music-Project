Her face is the last thing I see.
Let the ocean have whatâs left of me.
To make me pay for everything I have done.
They will hypnotize you with their song.
Erinyes are waiting for me, here to stop this cold heart from beating.
Pulling every breath from my lungs, here to take me to where I belong.
Burning into my soul for every wrong doing.
For every secret that Iâve kept inside.
Bury them.
Bury me.
Erinyes; here to stop this cold heart from beating.
Here to take me to where I belong, burning into my soul.
Erinyes, Erinyes.
Her face is the last thing I see.
Let the ocean have whatâs left of me.
To make me pay for everything Iâve done.
Erinyes youâre waiting for me.
This is my last day on Earth, bury me.
I know youâre waiting for me.
The Erinyes.
