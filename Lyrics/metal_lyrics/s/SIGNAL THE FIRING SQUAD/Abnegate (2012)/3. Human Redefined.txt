I hold the keys to everything in me, breathe life into me.
That feeling of free falling, when your stomach hits the floor.
And your heart starts racing, when you lose sight of reality.
When gravity is failing me, are you feeling anything?
Anything...
I hold the key to everything in me.
Refine me, refine me.
Iâve come too far, I canât go back.
My eyes will deceive me, these people are not what they seem.
Filter out the greed, this mindâs all I have.
The taste in the back of my throat is as bitter as I have become.
I made a promise to myself that I would never be like you.
I wonât let go.
When I come down, keep these feet upon the ground.
Hold tight to your surroundings.
This is our life, you have failed us all.
You are the coward, the fallen and the weak.
Youâve turned your back on everything and everyone I see.
You have failed me, you turned your back on me.
You are the fallen and the weak.
You are the coward.
That wonât be me, I made a promise to myself.
I will never be like you, I hold the key to everything in me.
Refine me, refine me.
Refine me.
