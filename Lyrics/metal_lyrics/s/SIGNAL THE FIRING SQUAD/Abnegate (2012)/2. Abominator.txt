[feat. Alex Erian]Iâve been stalking this night, for hours trying to find you.
Give me some strength in this darkest hour, that will see me through.
For every time theyâve been left with hope, theyâre pointing fingers at you.
You couldnât handle the weight of this whole world.
Speak the truth, into the eyes of the weary dreamer, tell me weâll rebuild a new day.
The power to reform this tainted dream, this is me, reborn.
No-one can run.
Iâve been stalking this night for hours, trying to find you.
Give me some strength in this darkest hour, that will see me through.
Iâve lost all will, these bones are growing weak.
I fear... I fear Iâm wasting away, these surroundings are bleak.
We are the cancer, every bullshit tale I believed.
But thereâs something inside me.
I fear thereâs something inside of me.
Weâll leave this place with nothing, we are reborn.
Half man, half machine.
Remember me, remember me.
Iâve lost all will, these bones are growing weak.
I fear, I fear Iâm wasting away, these surroundings are bleak.
Weâll leave this place with nothing, we are reborn.
Half man, half machine.
Remember me, remember me.
Pull me apart, replace these pieces of a hollow man.
Return, to clean up this mess weâve made.
Reborn, rusted gears through flesh and bones.
Reborn, a new day. A new life of disarray.
Half man, half machine, a creature so obscene.
No-one can run away.
No-one can intervene.
Where are you from?
What have I become?
Iâm now programmed to kill.
Iâve lost all will.
