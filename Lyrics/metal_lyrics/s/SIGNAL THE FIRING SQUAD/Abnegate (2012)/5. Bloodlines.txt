Have you ever felt like you canât breathe?
Like every minute is never enough.
Now that Iâm all in, a one way ticket to the edge of the Earth.
To feel the weight of nothing, I wonder if anything will come of this.
Weâre all living for tomorrow, but are we killing today?
Tell me the future, look into these eyes.
And read these cards in a line.
Tell me what are we doing here?
Tell me where I belong and what the future holds.
Are we abandoned souls?
Dividing these common people, bring them a new King.
This saint is a sinner.
Pick up the pieces of those hollow vessels.
They are weathered and in disrepair.
My pride is withering away, weâre all sinking.
What has this world become?
What have I done?
For every breath I took was never enough.
Tell me the future, look into these eyes,
Bring them a new King, this saint is a sinner.
Pick up the pieces of these hollow vessels.
They are weathered and in disrepair.
My pride is withering away, weâre all sinking.
This is the path weâve chosen.
We are creators and leaders of this generation.
Youâre not failing yourself, you are failing this whole generation.
Weâre all killing ourselves.
Have you ever felt like you canât breathe?
That every minute is never enough?
Now that Iâm all in, a one way ticket to the edge of the Earth.
To feel the weight of nothing, I wonder if anything will come of this.
Weâre all living for tomorrow.
But we are killing today.
