Bare light enters
These halls
Time barely passes
The floors
Silent for time
The Doors
Still for air
The mirror
Blind for movement
Time barely passes
Right hall
Shadows marking
Colored cover
Left hall
Light routes
Shall part
Pleasant ways
Hall behind
The pendulum
Through time
Through light
Through darkness
Through dust
The pendulum
The silent becomes loud
The absent becomes present
Each time barely passes
These halls
Hall behind
The pendulum
