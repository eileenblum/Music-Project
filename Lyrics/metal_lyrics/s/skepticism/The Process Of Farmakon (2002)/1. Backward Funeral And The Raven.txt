I turned around
The path was gone
Took a step back
Fell on my face
Fully covered
Up by the woods
On a carpet
Of thick moss

The sun
Filling half
Of the horizon
Rays drew warmth
From my skin
I turned towards
My right arm

A shadow cast a raven
On the top
Of a pine
Inhaling
A monotonous song
Down a rasp throat
As it landed away

Black flowers
Withering in bloom
Facing each other
With nothing to say
Growing down
To the depths
Of ground

I laid back
On a slow wave,
Calm, stormy sea
A crew,
Rowing a coffin across
The shores were gone
Waves forgotten
A rain
Like nails
Glittering in the sunlight
Fell on an iron armada
Of grey clouds
On the sky

I sunk
Thick water
Filling my lungs
With pleasure
Sinking deeper
I was awaken
Fell up on my feet
Numb fingers
Turning around
The path before me
Led somewhere
