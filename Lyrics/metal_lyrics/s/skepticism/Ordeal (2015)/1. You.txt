I look at You
as You push through the mist
drive apart the herd
separate the layers

I look at You
as You summon the dark
gather the light
stand tall as a statue

I look at You
as You wade through the deep
thought in each move
feel in each turn

I look at You
as You proceed with others
the same as before
and yet agian unknown

I look at You
for the last time
piece for piece
we are biw there
