How come are You here
Two decades since nightfall
The night was to be forever
The dark was said to last
The wine of departure
A potion bitter at first
Shall one leave a mark
Or be a mark oneself
to depart is to return
to leave is to stay it is said
to decide is to hesitate
next decade will wait for me

A new night will fall like a backward dawn
A new dark will rise like an inverted sun

Yet one will not depart
How come am I here
Ten years after midnight
The night was said to be forever
The dark was said to last
The wine of departure
A potion sweet with time
Shall one leave a mark
Or be a mark oneself
to depart is to return
to leave is to stay it is said
to decide is to hesitate
next decade will wait for me

I will be here then
and everthing will be true
