Stream brought words
and Stream brought meanings
Through its aether were seen all beings
beauty revealed as cruelty
Core of grief as death of desire

Stream flow in depth unmatched
crossed a statue with no hearing
March came colder than invited
crossed a realm of two endings
Stream to a sea had started turning

["The March and the Stream" is dedicated to Iia (1976-1996)]
