if here once was a shore
it has gone nowhere
further away Black islands, Rose
the bay is calm Approach Close
Distant   Nowhere

Forest on fire
Bitter Mist on the walley
To move is to vanish
To stay is to arrive

Nowhere there is a reason
There are no distance for giants
The path on a journey
Come,Close, nowhere
