mountains become heavy like dust
towers will stand like smoke
ages tighten to become aes
entering the levitation
feet would crave for solid ground
lost in vast forbidden ground
fell from clouds on sacred ground
in the mills of thought are being ground
mountains dust
towers smoke
ages aes
in levitation
swans hang from the heavy clouds
moon swam like a forgotten sin beneath
towards the bottom
through the lucid roof rose the-hanged-birds
heavy like statues of copper
in levitation as in an ethereal dream
swans became heavy to remain silent
as the stream will sink
