As the crowds are now left behind
I enter the vastness of green
I was weary of all the noise around
For my ears silence is the ultimate sound

The forest is around me
In silence the pines stand tall
With the wind they whisper their tales
As their wisdom is everdarkgreen

Dark green are my hallways
Within my rooms lies endless peace
Surrounded by the ones that understand me
Surrounded by the ones I can trust

At the swamps
Mist is rising
Covering
It all below
As light creates shades to the mist screen
I see no dreams coming true
A breath from the endless ground
The wisdom is everdarkgreen
