Come you servant,
for no one expects your return.
Come you servant,
obey as your skin starts to burn.

Sacrifice of the blind, 
for your flesh is so weak.
Reflections of the flames, 
in your dead eyes.

Live the spell, your own Hell.
So pure, yo delicate!
Forbidden ecstasy,
sin of the flesh.

I'm riding with the chosen few, 
and grinding the weak.
We are the chosen Gods, 
bow down to none.

Please your master,
you've been taught:
You are the sickest one!
Please your master,
blasphemic purification.

Fullfill the visions, 
embrace the curse.
Eternal pleasure in Hell.

I'm riding with the chosen few, 
and grinding the weak.
We are the chosen Gods, 
bow down to none.

For you are nothing, 
but a flesh offering to the gods!
For you are nothing,
but just blood spilled for the Gods.

For you are nothing,
just like all the others before.
For you are nothing,
and your soul will wander through Hell forever.
