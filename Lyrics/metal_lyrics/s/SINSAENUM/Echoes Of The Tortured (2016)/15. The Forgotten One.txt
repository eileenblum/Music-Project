Lying in wait of my own volition.
Cast away, the prophecies fullfilled.
I reign over the invisible, made of fire.
It's time for your world to burn.

Burn down to reveal, 
the ancient memories of death.
Now mankind shall see, 
the forgotten powers of evil overtake!

Darkness is black, walking through the ashes.
I, Overlord, commander of all plagues.
Kneel down before my wrath,
consumed in the fire!

My victory, your vain resistance.
My eyes will take away your light.
Insane memories, your fears made reality.

Burn down to reveal, 
the ancient memories of death.
Now mankind shall see, 
the forgotten powers of evil overtake!

Behold our rising power, the fury of our hate.
Engulfed in flames of cleansing, extinction of your race.
I've waited forgotten, tormented and concealed.
The time has come for my wrath to crush the world.

I'll break those chains that kept me bounded.
I'll break the walls surrounding my hatred.
A glorious rebirth, the forgotten one rises again.

Burn down to reveal, 
the ancient memories of death.
Now mankind shall see, 
the forgotten powers of evil overtake!
