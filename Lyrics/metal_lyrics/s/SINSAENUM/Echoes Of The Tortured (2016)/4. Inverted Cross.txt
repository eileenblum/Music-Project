Tearing down the crucifix, 
burning all the Christians.
Holy spirit from within, 
suffering with God.

Pray to a liar, affixed to a cross,
worshipping cowards shall perish in flames.
Resign and behold the rising of Satan.

Blood in your face, covered in shame.
Nazarene, you hold the sin in your flesh.
Accept the demise, we choose to burn in Hell!

Force feed masses with your shit,
fear leads to obedience.
Blinded brainless ignorance,
suffering for God.

Malevolent hypocrites,
so you think you will never die!
We make you suffer,
your torment's just begun.

Pray to a liar, affixed to a cross,
worshipping cowards shall perish in flames.
Resign and behold the rising of Satan.

Blood in your face, covered in shame.
Nazarene, you hold the sin in your flesh.
Accept the demise and open your scared eyes.

His truth isn't real, 
a fucked up hypocrite.
Your world and your dogma,
We mock the cross of God.

Pray to a liar, affixed to a cross,
believers and cowards shall perish in flames.
Only the weak can accept this disgrace.
Blood in your face, covered in shame.

Time for the world to take him off the cross.
Symbol of failure, thats's where he should be:
Shoved in a hole and left to fucking rot!
