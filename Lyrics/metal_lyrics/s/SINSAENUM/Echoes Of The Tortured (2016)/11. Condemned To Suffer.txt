Violence unleashed, show no apathy.
Time for revenge has come.
The war dogs have been released,
with an infinite thirst for blood.

Kill 'em all, fear none!
Crush your enemies, make them pay for their sins.
Punishment awaits, subjected to servitude.

Pure wrath, pure hate.
We must retaliate!
Inflict the pain!
Destruction, nothing remains.

Holocaust, tell me how you feel about dying today!
Holocaust, tell me how it feels to be condemned to suffer!
Holocaust, tell me how you feel about dying today!
Holocaust, tell me how it feels to be condemned to suffer!

Cowards shall be slain! 
Bodies left to die, soon to meet your creator. 
Mankind martyrized!
Dead souls ascending to the skies.

Pure wrath, pure hate.
We must retaliate!
Inflict the pain!
Destruction, nothing remains.

Holocaust, tell me how you feel about dying today!
Holocaust, tell me how it feels to be condemned to suffer!
Holocaust, tell me how you feel about dying today!
Holocaust, tell me how it feels to be condemned to suffer!

Desperation slowly fills the void, as you beg for mercy.
I despise your insides, I laugh at your pathetic sorrow.
Pull the pieces back together and shut your fucking mouth.
The time to die is now, emptiness awaits!

Triumphant, victory shall resonate.
Across the lands with pride we march.
Punishment, surrendering is not an option.
Merciless laughter will be the last thing you hear.

The final conclusion is near.
I feed upon the fear in your eyes.

Holocaust, tell me how you feel about dying today!
Holocaust, tell me how it feels to be condemned to suffer!
Holocaust, tell me how you feel about dying today!
Holocaust, tell me how it feels to be condemned to suffer!
