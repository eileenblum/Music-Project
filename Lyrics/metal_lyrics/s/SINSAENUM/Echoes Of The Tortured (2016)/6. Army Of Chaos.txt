We are the pain inside your head.
We are the sorrow in your soul.
We are the fire, we are the rusty nails.

We are the shadows, we are the night.
We are legion, we are one.
We've always been,
we'll always be the enemy.

We are the chaos!

We are the army of chaos.
We are the army of...

We are the ones they left for dead.
This is the fate we signed in blood.
We raise the banner, we raise our fists.
We'll spill our hate and conquer the world.

We are the shadows, we are the night.
We are legion, we are one.
We've always been,
we'll always be the enemy.

We are the chaos!

We are the army of chaos.
We are the army of chaos.
We are the army of chaos.
We are the army of chaos.

Victory shall be ours,
we have the power to dominate.
Death to those who oppose us.
Merciless warriors, united we stand.

Victory shall be ours,
we are fighting until the end.
We raise our banner, undefeated.
We are  your Nemesis, enemy as one.

And as the battle still rages on,
the rotting corpses thicken the air.
Blood river  turns black under the  pale white sun.

Damnation calling, tormented lands.
The ashes of the world you once knew,
rebuilt in hatred, Alpha/Omega.
The beginning, the end, the chaos.

We are the shadows, we are the night.
We are legion, we are one.
We are the blood, we are the enemy.

We are the enemy!

We are the shadows, we are the night.
We are legion, we are one.
We are the blood, we'll always be the enemy.

We are the chaos!

We are the army of chaos.
We are the army of chaos.
We are the army of chaos.
We are the army of chaos.
