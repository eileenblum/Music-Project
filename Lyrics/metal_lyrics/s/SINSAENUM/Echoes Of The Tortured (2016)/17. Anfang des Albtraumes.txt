All my thoughts forms manifest and become alive,
they are my embodied childhood fears.
The creatures from my nightmares,
I denied in my whole life and escaped.
But now, my death gave them birth!

Dawn of pain, demonic illusions,
before the night of dark starts to fade.
My deepest fears leading me to seclusion.
Invasion of my mind, madness awaits.

Deny, forever deny!
The nightmare's alive.
Forever deny!

Visions unveil, I've been afraid to realize.
I face the creatures, terror out of time.
Ignorance through opposite, open up your eyes and see.
Behold the sacrifice, in despair we pray for death.

"A valÃ³sÃ¡g Ã©s az Ã¡lom Ã¶sszefolyik.
Nincs tovÃ¡bb Ã©let Ã©s nincs tovÃ¡bb halÃ¡l.
Az idÅ megÃ¡ll a tÃ©r Ã¶sszeszÅ±kÃ¼l egy pontba.
A lÃ©t Ã©s nemlÃ©t kÃ¶zÃ¶tti hajszÃ¡l vÃ©kony hatÃ¡rvonalon.
Elregan a felszabaditÃ³ Ã©s Ã¶rÃ¶k pillanat."

I light the pyre!
My life torn asunder, I die.
Hear the screams of fright,
I shall forever and ever burn in Hell.

Majestic form of primal destruction.
Let the sun burn out, I am nothing again.

Visions unveil, I've been afraid to realize.
I face the creatures, terror out of time.
Ignorance through opposite, open up your eyes and see.
Behold the sacrifice, in despair we pray for death.
