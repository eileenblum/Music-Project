Torment, penitence, empire of disgust.
The victims of creation, humanity turns to dust.
The fallacies of ancients, putrid form of existence.
A war that seems so distant, this is the curse of man.

Burned off, left without a trace,
removing the curse through the veil.

Torture, vivisect, just cut right through the bone.
A method of extraction, reveal the secrets you withhold.
The prophecies of horror, the darkest night belongs to me.
I am the bringer of hatred, the final curse of man.

Burned off, left without a trace,
removing the curse through the veil.
Screams of pain tearing the night,
morbid ways to enact your end.

This is the curse of man.
Ripped off, expose your dark side.
Reveal the truth inside your being,
slaughter preserves the power.

Their sons will suffer,
their lives are worthless.
Rebirth through Hellfire,
their race will succumb to mistakes.

Burned off, left without a trace,
removing the curse through the veil.
Screams of pain tearing the night,
morbid ways to enact your end.
