Fire from the depths, manifestation.
Summoned to cast the terror upon humanity.
The representation of darkness, creation of all fears.
Time to celebrate the resurrection.

Infernal spell, bound to putrefy.
Oblivion swallowing the light.
Massacre, blood is running in torrents.
Morbid vultures spreading their wings.

Time for us to see the signs,
cracking the skies and blazing oceans.
Death has come from the abyss.
The Gods of Hell!

Now's time for us to see the signs,
cracking the skies and blazing oceans.
Death has come from the abyss.
The Gods of Hell!

The rules are set, you must obey.
Their power is spread through persecution.
Your mind is weak, devoid of will.
Follow the path of your decay.

Decay!

The stars have fallen, the rivers turned to poison.
An endless scream, unison of suffering.
Sultry winds blowing over the world.
Carrying the contamination.

From the unknown, the primal form of evil!
The Gods of Hell grant us suffocation.

Suffocation!

Now's time for us to see the signs,
cracking the skies and blazing oceans.
Death has come from the abyss.
The Gods of Hell!

The Gods of Hell!
