Malady, my self-destruction.
Abstract words through shades of lies.
Paralyzed, a life of shadows.
A black horizon, I want you to die.

You're struggling in vain,
a continuous cry.
An end to the pain,
the throes of dying.

Inner conflict brings division.
Separates the mind and the flesh.
Through the darkness I ride, confusion.
May the blade bring the answer and set me free.

You're struggling in vain,
a continuous cry.
An end to the pain,
the throes of dying.

Razorblade, your bones, it squeals.
Salty teardrops upon wounds.
Your skin so soft, so tender.
Fixed smile of horror!

I am terror, impenetrating fears.
My resurrection  through your screams.
Feel my hands tightening,
I've killed you before in my dreams.

So you can ease my withdrawal!
Now take a look in the mirror,
that fear enlightening your eyes.
That fear is me!

You're struggling in vain,
a continuous cry.
An end to the pain,
the throes of dying.

You're struggling in vain,
a continuous cry.
An end to the pain,
the throes of dying.
