Ever since birth I've been
Attracted to the sinister
All the malignant, cruel forces of the world
Yet at times I've been mislead by her opposite
And it is with great shame
I acknowledge these mistakes

Father... who art not in heaven
Hear my cries of true remorse
To let a mortal being ever coincide with thou
Must be punished with a fate worse than death

I find comfort in sadness and in grief
Thinking of all those beautiful
Things that could have been
Now put me in a position where
I would have to choose
My devotion to evil will always
Come before you

For countless days and countless nights
I've been wandering these
Worn-down streets all alone
And it is in these angst-ridden moments
I find nutrition for my starving

Misanthropic soul

I find comfort in sadness and in grief
Thinking of all those beautiful
Things that could have been
Now put me in a position where
I would have to choose
My devotion to evil will always
Come before you

No matter what you do
No matter what you say
Whoever you may pray

Christianity worldwide
Satanas worldwide
