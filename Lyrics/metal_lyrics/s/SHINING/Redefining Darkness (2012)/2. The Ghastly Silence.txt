I opened my eyes, but I couldn't see
I had a feeling deep inside,
That something was watching me
I couldn't move
I couldn't speak nor could I flee
There is an unstoppable horror,
And it's coming for me

Evening came and so did they
Unknown voices laughing in the dark
They spoke of an impenetrable darkness,
The absence of light
I can hear them approaching,
The smell of old
Must follow their stench

The ghastly silence spoke to me
You cannot sleep,
You cannot cry and you cannot smile
Unless someone dies
