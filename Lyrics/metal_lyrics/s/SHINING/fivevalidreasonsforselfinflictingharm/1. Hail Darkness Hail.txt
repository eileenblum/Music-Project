There is a darkness blacker
Than anything ever seen by man
So violent, so cruel and pernicious
For and eternity have I searched thee,
In each continent and land
I long for you presence as
Your absence is driving me mad

"EstÃ¡s en la baÃ±era,rodeada de espuma.
Extiendes el brazo y con una cuchilla... despacio, dibujas un
surco en tu muÃ±eca...una rosa de sangre perfecta...
por donde se escapa tu vida desorientada.
Abrazas la muerte como un consuelo.
Y finalmente...descansas."

Through timeless halls,
Forgotten rooms, the void awaits in silence
The majestic nothingness, I submit to thee
Nothing can come between us,
Not a single ray of light
All hail the darkness,
Et spiritus sancti

Without you,
There is no light at the end of the tunnel

Without you,
There is no light at the end of the tunnel

Without you,
There is no light at the end of the tunnel

Without you,
There is no light at the end of the tunnel

Without you,
There is no light at the end of the tunnel
