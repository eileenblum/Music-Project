1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Smile at Hate, laugh at Fate
We will meet and part and meet again

Blackjazz Rebels, I
Blackjazz Rebels, You
Blackjazz Rebels, We
Blackjazz Rebels,
I am, You are, I

I never needed, I never needed you
We never needed, we never needed you
You never needed, to to to see the truth
You can try to bring us down, but there will be no fight
'Cause this, this is what we do

Blackjazz Rebels, I
Blackjazz Rebels, You
Blackjazz Rebels, We
Blackjazz Rebels,
I am, You are, I

Blackjazz Rebels, You
Blackjazz Rebels, We
Blackjazz Rebels,
I am, You are, I

I know the reason, I know the reason why
I know the reason you can't look me in the eye
You fear the reason I do it my own way
You wanna pick a fight, I won't return your bite
Inside, this is what I say

Blackjazz Rebels, I
Blackjazz Rebels, You
Blackjazz Rebels, We
Blackjazz Rebels,
I am, You are, I

Blackjazz Rebels, You
Blackjazz Rebels, We
Blackjazz Rebels,
I am, You are, I

Why join the ones you beat?
Why walk in circles?
Why join the ones you beat?
Why walk in circles?
Why walk in circles? Why?
Why, why, why, why why, why why?

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Smile at Hate, laugh at Fate
We will meet and part and meet again

Blackjazz Rebels, I
Blackjazz Rebels, You
Blackjazz Rebels, We
Blackjazz Rebels,
I am, You are, I

Blackjazz Rebels, You
Blackjazz Rebels, We
Blackjazz Rebels,
I am, You are, I

Blackjazz Rebels, You
Blackjazz Rebels, We
Blackjazz Rebels,
I am, You are, I
