Just when you think you're Off The Hook
Just when you think you're Off The Hook
The Devil takes another look
Just when you think you're Off The Hook

Hey you, I heard the shots they hit your son
Hey you, I heard they tried to swim and run
I see you know it can never come undone
And in your rearview mirror:
All you wish you two had done

Just when you think you're Off The Hook
Just when you think you're Off The Hook
The Devil takes another look
Just when you think you're Off The Hook

Hey you, I heard the shots they hit your friend
Hey you, just like the truck around the bend
And you miss his smile, but you don't pretend
'Cause you were there that day in the rain,
and tried to put him back together again

Just when you think you're Off The Hook
Just when you think you're Off The Hook
The Devil takes another look
Just when you think you're Off The Hook

Hide!
Hide!
Hide!
Hide!
Hide!
Hide!
Hide!
Hide!
Hide!

In the end
Your time is spent
You might have to go through it all again
You're getting used to it by now
The ever-present cloud
No more singers â No more songs
The memory of your son

When you think you're Off The Hook
The Devil takes another look

Think you're off the hook
Just when you think you're off the hook
The Devil takes another look
Just when you think you're off the hook

Just when you think you're Off The Hook
Just when you think you're Off The Hook
The Devil takes another look
Just when you think you're Off The Hook
