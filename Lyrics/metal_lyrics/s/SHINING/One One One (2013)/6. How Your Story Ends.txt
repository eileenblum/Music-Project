I said Time waits for no one
I said Time waits for no one
I said Time takes a sweet revenge
You know I, I know how it ends

You can make a monkey of yourself
and try to pretend
But this is how Your Story Ends

Time will turn the Trend
Time will turn the Trend
Time will turn the Trend

Time is Not Your Friend
Time will turn the Trend
This is how Your Story Ends

You'll see every time you look around
Another lie has taken your crown
When old truths burn, the tables turn
When the tables turn, the old truths burn

You can make a monkey of yourself
and try to pretend
But this is how Your Story Ends

Time will turn the Trend
Time will turn the Trend
Time will turn the Trend

Time is Not Your Friend
Time will turn the Trend
This how Your Story Ends

You can make a monkey of yourself
and try to pretend
But this is how the Story Ends

Time is Not Your Friend
Time is Not Your Friend
So This is how Your Story Ends

This is how Your Story Ends
This is how Your Story Ends

Time will turn the Trend
Time will turn the Trend
Time will turn the Trend

Time is Not Your Friend
Time will turn the Trend
This how Your Story Ends
