Walk Away, Walk Away
Walk Away, Walk Away
Walk Away, Walk Away
Walk Away, Walk Away

Away Walk, Walk Away
Away Walk, Walk Away
Walk Away, Walk Away
Walk Away, Walk Away

Towards the night
We'll set it right
Dark white light, ready to ignite
Even Antichrist sometimes thinks twice
It's about to rise

Let it begin, sucking me in
We drive it in, pin by pin
Loosing my head, seeing red
Seeing the thunderhead, as poison as lead
Sting like a Stingray, you really wanna play?
Do you stay or Walk Away?

Do you stay, stay, or Walk Away?
Do you stay or Walk Away?
Do you stay or Walk Away?
Do you stay or Walk Away?

Count to ten, still no end
Ten is not enough; wish you would know when to stop
You wanna pick a fight,
I've been training for that for my whole life
Do you hear what the Dead Men say, do you trust your DNA?
Do you jump in with the pigs, or lead the pigs astray?
Do you stay or Walk Away?

Do you stay, stay, or Walk Away?
Do you stay or Walk Away?
Do you stay or Walk Away?
Do you stay or Walk Away?

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Right here, right now
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Right here, right now
This is how I multiply, this is how I multiply
I don't waste my time and waste my life,
I don't waste my time and waste my life,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10

Do I stay or Walk Away?
Do I stay or Walk Away?
Do I stay or Walk Away?
Do you stay or Walk Away?

Walk Away, Walk Away
Walk Away, Walk Away
Walk Away, Walk Away
Walk Away, Walk Away

Away Walk, Walk Away
Away Walk, Walk Away
Walk Away, Walk Away
Walk Away, Walk Away
