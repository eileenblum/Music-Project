You will forget the pain
You will forget the strain
The iron taste of shame
You'll forget the hurting game

The night, what I became
The needle and the chain
My dear old brother Cain
I will not forget your name

Cold dish, cold dish of revenge
Cold dish, cold dish of revenge
I keep a spider in my net
If you curse the rain, you will get wet

I won't forget
I won't forget

See where these lies all lie
They lie here side by side
They hide inside my mind
Behind the silence of my eyes

They hide between your thighs
The truth, the whole, and nothing but
The whole most clear to my eye
Is the gaping hole between your lies

Cold dish, cold dish of revenge
Cold dish, cold dish of revenge
Long list, like a list of threats
Written down around my neck

I won't forget
I won't forget
I'll never forget
I won't forget

I won't forget
I won't forget
I won't forget
I'll never forget

I won't forget
I won't forget
I won't forget
I'll never forget
I'll never forget
