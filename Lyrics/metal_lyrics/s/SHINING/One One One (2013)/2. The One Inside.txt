But I Say no
You Wanna go with the flow
But I Am The One Inside
And I say No

There's something inside
Something that decides
Standing there across the Nile
A figure in black,
you say you wanna leave it all behind

It says no
It says no
It says no
It says no

There's a hole in your soul
Where control is growing old

You think, you think you decide
You think you know The One Inside,

But I Say no
You Wanna go with the flow
But I Am The One Inside
And I say No

I am you, you are I
You're the one that I decide
I define myself by how well I hide
I define you by how well you lie

You think, you think you decide
You think you know The One Inside,

But I Say no
You Wanna go with the flow
But I Am The One Inside
And I say No

But I Say no
You Wanna go with the flow
But I Am The One Inside
And I say No

I Say no
You Wanna go with the flow
But I Am The One Inside
And I say No

I Say no
You Wanna go with the flow
But I Am The One
And I say No
