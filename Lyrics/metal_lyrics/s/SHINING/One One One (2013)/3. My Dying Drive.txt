All My Life, try to keep it from dying
Keep it alive, always defying
Lying 'bout the fact that it's all a lie
Telling no one that the dying will die

My, oh my, be very afraid
Afraid of the day you've got nothing to say
But do as I do, and hide it away

If they find out it's about to die
If they find out that the well is dry
If they find out, then I won't survive

But I'll make sure they won't find My Dying Drive

I'll make sure they won't find My Dying Drive
I'll make sure they won't find My Dying Drive

Ahh, I know how you feel
I'll make you a deal
Click, click, your doubt is strong
Click, click, the sound of a choice going wrong

My, oh my, I don't need your help
I'll build this bridge my fucking self
Won't tell no one that it's all a lie

'Cause if they find out it's about to die
If they find out that the well is dry
If they find out, then I won't survive

But I'll make sure they won't find My Dying Drive

I'll make sure they won't find My Dying Drive
I'll make sure they won't find My Dying Drive

I'll make sure they won't find My Dying Drive
I'll make sure they won't find My Dying Drive

I'll make sure they won't find My Dying Drive
I'll make sure they won't find My Dying Drive
I say no one will every figure out
I'll make sure they won't find My Dying Drive
