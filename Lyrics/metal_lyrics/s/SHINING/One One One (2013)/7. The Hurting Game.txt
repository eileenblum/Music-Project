Awake in the Day
Awake in the Night
It never stops, and it never will
The Parasite

It's rolling the Dice, pinning the Blame
It's digging its teeth in a Hurting Game
You're a good name for a bad cause
You're the best excuse for the worst thought

The Hurting Game have nothing to say
The very same day that you go away
I always said I would take the pain
So gather around for the very last Hurting Game

I always said
I would stay 'til the end
But I never said I would stay the same
So watch as I bring the end of The Hurting Game

Well, it stares in the dark
Like a film out in the light
I think that I took its eyes
So it will never find its way out

And it never should, and it never will
Old habits of mind now cold and still
Dead dogs don't bark, but the sick will bite
No more swollen red eyes in the dead of the night

The Hurting Game have nothing to say

I always said
I would stay 'til the end
But I never said I would stay the same
So watch as I bring the end of The Hurting Game

I always said
I would stay 'til the end

But I never said I would stay the same
So watch as I bring the end of The Hurting Game

The Hurting Game had nothing to say
The very same day that you went away
I always said I would take the pain
So gather around for the very last Hurting Game
