Paint the Sky Black
Paint the Sky White

I do not fight back
I Paint the Sky Black
I do not fight back
I Paint the Sky Black

Paint Black
Paint White
Not Back
Paint Black

See my eyes, they're on fire
I'm the wind to the pyre

See the world, see my eyes, they're on fire
See the fire spread and hear the choir
I am the wind, I am the wind
Anger rises, picks a fight, it fuels the fire

This is where it all just does not make sense
This is where it all just does not make sense
This is where it makes all the difference

I do not fight back
I Paint the Sky Black
I do not fight back
I Paint the Sky Black

Paint Black

From within, 'til the end
Give me the world, and I can make it bend
Show me the end, show me the end
You don't wanna know what I just penned

I see you pick a fight
I see it when you bite
Look into my bright white eye
And I will tell a great white lie

This is where it all just does not make sense
This is where it all just does not make sense
This is where it makes all the difference

I do not fight back
I Paint the Sky Black
I do not fight back
I Paint the Sky Black

I do not fight back
I Paint the Sky Black
I Paint the Sky White
I Paint the Sky Black

I do not fight back
I Paint the Sky Black
I Paint the Sky White
I Paint the Sky Black

Paint the Sky Black
Paint the Sky Black
Paint the Sky Black
Paint the Sky Black
