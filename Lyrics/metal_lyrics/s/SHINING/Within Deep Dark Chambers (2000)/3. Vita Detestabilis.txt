I am a picture of myself
Always somewhere outside aura
And like reflections in the mirror
It shines no more!

Wrapped in the complete NOTHING
The emptiness nature wouldn't share with us

Disgusted by life
Release the blood and submit to freedom!

"There's no such thing as happiness. Suicide is the only way!"
