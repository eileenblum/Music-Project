Hate me!
Complete patterns known as shameful
Cut me deeper than...
Hate me!

And collect the twelve daggers of infinity

Follow to my paradise
Fulfill yourself, harass yourself (for me)
And follow to my paradise,
Cut yourself, a productive code to manipulate
the HOLINESS

And share your pains...
pains...
pains...
pains...


Thanks to lorinwilk for correcting tracks ## 3, 4 lyrics.
