Do I belong here, in centre of these fields?
Any identity do not belong these faces
(They may not even be here)

So much mourning this place has caused
So much hate!
A life among distant shadows
Always one step behind

Every night - Lonelier than the one before
Each day - A mourning

Death has sawn it's seed
A greater SUFFERING than pain itself...
