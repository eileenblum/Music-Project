When night suddenly appeared during daytime
The angels invited me to enter inside
To find out what originally spawned wolves to nature
And what offered EMPTINESS

Night was created by day;
Day was risen through melancholy

Crying, the uttermost scream for help
Although even the insects wouldn't care

Far away from everything...
...even myself
