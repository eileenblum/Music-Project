Blood.
Song.
Time.
Sing.

Quantum collapse will burn the bridge where many worlds existed.
Now a single slope unfolds
Steep as a mountain, slippery as ice
The ever downward spiral, the inevitable tide
The outlines of a beast, slowly taking form
Pixel by pixel, giving birth to deadly shape

The circle of confusion
The ever shifting focus
Lenses stretching, torn apart

Losing hope is losing mind, losing hope is losing mind
The ever downward spiral, the inevitable tide
Afraid to remember, unable to forget
The time when man and snake and apple met
Waterboarding is our friend, and God is on our side
The ever downward spiral, the inevitable tide

Blood.
Song.
Time.
Sing.

You cheat on your own lover!
You fuck with your own brother!
You fight with one another!
Your cold heart will not recover!
