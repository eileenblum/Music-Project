You'll remember me when my sight ran sore
Black jazz for the mass, Birds sing no more
Put on a glass, it would never forget the pain
The same old, same old hurting game
You'll remember me when I end this game,
Don't say no, don't you say my name
When I leave this world, when my will is done
I am the unmarked man, the madness is gone
The fight is won,
The fight is won by will alone!
