[King Crimson cover]

Cat's foot, iron claw
Neuro-surgeons scream for more
At paranoia's poison door
21st century schizoid man

Blood rack barbed wire
Politicians' funeral pyre
Innocents raped with napalm fire
21st century schizoid man

Death seed blind man's greed
Poets' starving children bleed
Nothing he's got he really needs
21st century schizoid man
