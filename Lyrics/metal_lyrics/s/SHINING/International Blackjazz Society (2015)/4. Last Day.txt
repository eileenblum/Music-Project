All you can do is to hope and pray
But I know so well that I will betray
All you can do is to hope and pray
But I know so well that I will betray

Beneath the lies you hide your greed
But I keep it here, what you cannot steal
Inside a blood red cavity
You know it's coming, but your eyes can't see
You're tearing up, you're down on your knees
And it gets so god damn hard to breathe

All you can do is to hope and pray
But I know so well that I will betray
All you can do is to hope and pray

All night long I dream of the day
All night long I dream of the day
All night long I dream of the day
The day when I say

Don't fucking tell me what to play
I'll always disobey
Until my last day
I'll go my own way

Now there's a void inside of me
Where I keep the wound that cannot heal
And whenever I go I will go all alone
I've never found a place where I belong
You hear the sound of a blade in your back
And you know I won't be coming back

All you can do is to hope and pray
But I know so well that I betrayed
All you can is to hope and pray

All night long I dream of the day
All night long I dream of the day
All night long I dream of the day
The day when I say

Don't fucking tell me what to play
I'll always disobey
Until my last day
I'll go my own way

All night long I dream of the day
All night long I dream of the day
All night long I dream of the day
The day when I say

All you can do is to hope and pray
All you can do is to hope and pray
All you can do is to hope and pray
All you can do

Don't fucking tell me what to write
I know I'll never satisfy
Until my last day
I'll go my own way

Ouh!
All you can do is to hope and pray, ouh!
All you can do is to

Don't fucking tell me what to write
This song will be our last goodbye
Until my last day
I'll go my own way
