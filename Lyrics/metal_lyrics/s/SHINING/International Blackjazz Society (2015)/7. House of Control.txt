I hear this broken sound
Of what's gone by
I see a tear of lead behind your eye

It's happening again
I've lost this place I didn't occupy
Our broken fairy tale so hard to hide

I hear it closer now, whisper through the night
I hear it through the dark, whispering a lie
It's happening again, and you keep telling me you know I tried
But deep inside you know it's all a lie

Behind this cold and empty stare I know I was never there

Now I know it's all a lie
Chose a poison, choose a life
Now I know just what I sold
I sold all the things I love - for a place -
For a place in this House of Control

I've tried and tried but cannot hide from my dying drive
I've seen this across the sky, I came to say goodbye
I thought I could control the end
Thought I would change, but now i can't pretend
I know how this will end, now I see why

Behind these red and bloodshot eyes
I know I'll stay this way until I die
Because

Now I know it's all a lie
Choose a poison, choose a life
Now I know just what I sold
I sold all the things I love for the place
In this empty House Of Control

There was a time before this time
When I told myself
There was a time before this when I told myself
It was worth the sacrifice
To sacrifice all I loved for
What I was going to love
There was a time before this time
In my my my my cold black soul
I knew what I was living for
But now, but now I'm not so sure

Damn you life, look what you stole
All this time I've played this role
Look deep inside this cold black soul
Where all you'll find's a foul dead hole

Behind the taste of what I said
Behind the silence in my head
Behind this cold and empty bed
Where thoughts of you are all found dead

Hey! [12x]

Now I know it's all a lie
Choose a poison, choose a life
Now I know just what I sold
I sold all the things I love

Now I know it's all a lie
Choose a poison, choose a life
Now I know just what I sold
I sold all the things I love

Now I know it's all a lie
Choose a poison, choose a life
I sold all the things I love
For a place in this empty House Of Control

Now I know it's all a lie
Choose a poison, choose a life
Now I know just what I sold
I sold all the things I love for a place in this
Empty House of Control
