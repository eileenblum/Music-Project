Sideshow cars and plastic stars
A turgid affair
Illuminates the dwindling scars

They point and stare

I've been longing for a son like you
I've been searching for a way out too
and somebody - somebody's looking for you.
If I find some way out

Then I will stay
With heart split two ways down
Like tears down my face
We'll find our way out

Without a map just our hearts
And when we get out
We'll topple down your house of cards
