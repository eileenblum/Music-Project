A suicidal haze, unreal like a torturous dream
Old stinging mental wounds, still raw and fucking bleeding

Drowning in the womb of misery, the mother of depression
The slaughter of all hope, the grim death of compassion

Sell your soul to evil; sell your soul to death

...Suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide...

A dead empty stare into the ruins of my world
A world I have already left so many years ago

"There are no more barriers to cross.
All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it, I have now surpassed.
My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone; in fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others.
I want no one to escape, but even after admitting this there is no catharsis, my punishment continues to elude me and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself; no new knowledge can be extracted from my telling.
This confession has meant nothing."
[The quote from the movie American Psycho (2000)]
