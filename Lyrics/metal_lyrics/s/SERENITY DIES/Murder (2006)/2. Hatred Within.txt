[Music - Chippe, Fai, Lyrics - Chuck]

Gaze into this world
You'll see the shades of war
Rising through the nation
Like a roaring hurricane

Streak of terror plague
Within the hearts of peoples
Leading them to suffer on there
Sacred ground

Can you feel the fire, it's burning their heart?
Can you feel the fire, it's burning their veins?
War spills hatred and devastation
War leads into an edge of sadness

Lives been turn to graves
By the hands that reach out for you
Endless pain, endless grief
To thousand peoples undead

Spreading lies and hate
There name of victory
It fuels the war into
Another brutal massacre

Destroyed souls, feeds from our flesh
Your shattered goats
Why can't you leave us alone?

People's death who takes the blame
Desperate lives, you ignoring just the same
With peoples rage, the truth unfolds
Will they ever see the light again?

Can you feel the fire, it's burning their heart?
Can you feel the fire, it's burning their veins?
War spills hatred and devastation
War leads into the edge of sadness
