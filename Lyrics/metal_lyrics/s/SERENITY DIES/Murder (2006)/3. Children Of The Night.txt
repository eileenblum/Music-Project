[Music - Chippe, Lyrics - Chuck]

In the dark of the night
Awakes the immortals
Drifting through the moonlit streets
Striving to satisfy there hunger
And seduce earth to infernal world

Death plagues in every path they dwell
Creatures lurking from daylight
Scavenging blood through mortal man
For demented lust they so crave

Enchanting eyes, sharp hungry grins
See what they have become
Become this thing

They'll feed your blood
Enslave the mortals
They'll reign the night
'Cause they are children of the night

Night of the dead
Deep darkness falls
Making there music to the banshees calls
Dripping blood upon every frame
Burning the world with smell of death

Bloodlust restraining there mind
Human screams within every fright
Reaper of blood with hungry grins
Showing there strange nightmares

They'll feed your blood
Enslave the mortals
They'll reign the night
'Cause they are the children of the night

Screaming souls plead for there life
The shadows of hell creep on every sin
The taste of blood that so sweet
To drain the life out of the flesh

Blood so warm, is running deep
The skins so cold, yield your life
Sink the teeth into your flesh
Spill the blood forever more

Enchanting eyes, sharp hungry grins
See what they have become
Become this thing

They'll feed your blood
Enslave the mortals
They'll reign the night
'Cause they are children of the night
