[Music - Fai, Chippe, Lyrics - Chuck]

Welcome to my world
To a place of ecstasy
Where you'll be blessed
When I feed and control you
I am the one who gossip whisper
Through your ears
Infuriating your anger
Harassing through your brain

[Chorus:]
I am the immortal
The Prince of darkness
I'll guide you until your death
Now work with me
As I show you the way

I am the one
Always lying beneath your shadow
Playing my game
Guiding you from sin to sin
You'll hear my call
An obey cause I am your master
Plugging your mind with lies
And desecrating you

[Chorus]

Welcome to my world
To my secret place of lies
I'll obsess you in your dream
To fantasize the real life
My words seem right
To trust and believe in
Now follow me
I am the treacherous deceiver

[Chorus x2]
