[Music - Chippe, Fai, Lyrics - Chuck]

Born into darkness, raised by demons
Through the streets of bloodshed
And extermination
Forced to fight in infantile age
Summoned to war as a killing machine
Got to face the battlefield
A childhood nightmare that would never end

Lost my way
My brains on fire
I'm losing my soul
Trapped inside a nightmare
A prisoner of mayhem
Born to darkness
Propagate by demons
To destroy my enemies

Years passed away, painting blood on walls
No chance to see the future
In total devastation
Road to kill chosen before birth
Shackled an caged, in a hopeless world
Facing the enemies
A dread nightmare that never ever leave

Lost my way
My brains on fire
I'm losing my soul
Trapped inside a nightmare
Encircled by fiends
And bestial cruelty
No adore only hate
No path, just a lost
A Prisoner of mayhem
Born to darkness
Propagate by demons
To destroy my enemies

Lost my way
My brains on fire
I'm losing my soul
Trapped inside a nightmare
A prisoner of mayhem
Born to darkness
Propagate by demons
To destroy my enemies
