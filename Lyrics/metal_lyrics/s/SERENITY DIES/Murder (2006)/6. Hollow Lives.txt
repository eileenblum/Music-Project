[Music - Chippe, Fai, Lyrics - Chuck]

Wake up to a hell
There nothing much to dream
The silence is deafening
Much to seek in this life
Everything we have
Forever had mourned to
Must fight till death
To never bleed in this life

The crushing deceivers
The violent believers
Inside this hell

Forever to kill us
There heart dipped in cold dust
To trap us in snare

Speak up to tell
Everything we've seen
No innocence is reckoning
We want to see what lies behind
All the thing they take
Never care for you
Like a knife in the back
There ever will is to freeze your life

The crushing deceivers
The violent believers
Inside this hell

Forever to kill us
There heart dipped in cold dust
To trap us in snare
