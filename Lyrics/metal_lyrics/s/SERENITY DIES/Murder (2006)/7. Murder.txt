[Music - Chuck, Chippe, Lyrics - Chuck]

Murder is on your mind
Your life is worth the pain
Standing tall in a world of
Madness animosity
Hatred, what you feel from inside
Your heart is covered with filth
This is what you want to seek
From your peoples lives

Lust for the power
Greed for money
Steal there lives
Stay in hell

Power, is just a battery
Soon everything, break your policy
Terminating your world of
Supreme destinies
Innocence, already dead inside of you
For lust you take no prisoner
This is just another game
Invented you murderer

Lust for the power
Greed for money
Steal there lives
Stay in hell

Son of evil
You raped this land
Marching with the devils
Raising the flag of injustice
Son of deception
You play with every mind
The language you speak it's always lies

Murder is on your mind
Your life is worth the pain
Standing tall in a world of
Madness animosity
Hatred, what you feel from inside
Your heart is covered with filth
This is what you want to seek
From your peoples lives

Lust for the power
Greed for money
Steal there lives
Stay in hell

Time will come
For you to fall
Crucify your name
To slay your soul

Chuck - vocal / bass
Chippe - guitars
Xiao - guitars
Fai - drums
