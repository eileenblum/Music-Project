Go ahead and talk
Say what you're going to say
It's the same old story day after day
Every time I turn my head
I see you tripping over your lies
There's no surprise to see you let us down
Stop acting like you've got it all figured out
It's time to take back my life
(take back my life)

What will it take to keep moving forward?
You will remember my words after I'm dead and gone

And now I'm here to take my life back, finally

[Chorus]
When I leave you behind, will you carry on the same?
I will be something more.

I won't listen to the words you spill out of your mouth
You're like a poisoned pill that I can't swallow.
I can't handle the lies.
I've held my composure for way too long

[Chorus]
When I leave you behind, will you carry on the same? I will be something more.
When I look into the mirror, I'm happy with who I am and what I've become.

I have been lost and I have been down
I have been lost and I have been down
I have been lost, and I have been down, but don't count me out I'm sticking around.

[Chorus]
When I leave you behind, will you carry on the same? I will be something more.
Now I look into the mirror and I'm happy with who I am and what I've become

I have been down, I have been down but I'm not out.
