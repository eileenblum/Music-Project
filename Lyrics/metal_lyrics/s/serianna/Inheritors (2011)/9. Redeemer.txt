How long will it take for...you to see the truth
Living a life of lust (wasting away)
Momentary pleasures are lost in a moment
Are the struggles worth it?

When truth comes out will you listen? Or will you take your chances
When truth comes out will you listen? Or will you take these chances

Sooner or later...this will all come back (to you)
The road will end and there's no turning back
You're falling out of touch...It's such a shame (such a shame)
You had it all....You had it all
My god, My god....(You had it all)
And now you've got....nothing to show

But don't lose hope....time heals it all
You can save yourself....you can rebuild
Be careful when picking up the pieces
You may find that your supports are all gone

Keep your goals in sight, it's tempting to throw it all away (but don't forget)

You can only coast until you lose momentum
You'll be stranded again (you'll be left to drown)
You can only coast until you lose momentum
You'll be stranded again (you'll be left to drown)

When the truth comes out will you listen or will you take your chances
You're hanging by a thread and it's about to break ....break
Is this all you've got?
