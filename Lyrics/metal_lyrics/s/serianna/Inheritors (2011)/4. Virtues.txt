We hold an ideal
Of the way life's supposed to be.
Following step by step,
To the fall.
Where is the choice,
When you leave it to fate?
Losing my grip, is this the end?
This is hell on earth,
I can hear the masses calling,
Screams flooding my ears.
As chaos surrounds me,
I beg for this to stop.
I am stuck in a moment.
Pushed, to the point of no return.
From this hell on earth, I hear them calling,
I hear my name.
We all know things aren't the same
As yesterday (yesterday).
Take me away from the horror,
Take me away.
Gasping for air,
Drowning in their own worlds.
From up here, I hear them calling.
We hold an ideal
Of the way life's supposed to be.
Following step by step,
I can see the fall.
Wake up.
This is the end of the road.
Help me breathe
It's crowded in here.
Our days are numbered
So let's make this count.
The sun is rising
And I can barely breathe.
In the end I swear...
I am in control, I am in control.
You're only cheating yourself,
But your words defile us all.
I am not a martyr.
I was a victim.
I am not a martyr.
I am free from the ideal.
