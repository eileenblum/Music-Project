The trumpet sound and those who repent will be forgiven
Death surrounds us all and few stay strong
He will wipe every tear and shine the light in the deepest hallows
Death will come calling,
The world will be falling down, falling down

All the world is broken
Our throats are open graves
Save your breath and pray for our safety, our safety

As the clock strikes twelve the inheritors prepare for the worst, prepare for the worst
Screams echo without warning
But we don't, we don't listen
A new test of pride
Will fill every life

Those who fail to see our flaws will burn up in this world
And all of its imperfections

This is our challenge

We never listened
And took nothing to heart
Our generation will crumble in the wake
This comes as no surprise
This is war
This is war
We know we're not
We know we're not alone
We know we're not
We know we're not
It's such a feeling left out in the dark with no one to take me back, no one to take me back

Take us away
Take us home
Throw us a line and bring us back

This is not a mystery
The story has been told a thousand times before

We brought this upon ourselves

The wretched will get what they deserve
But the innocent will fall victim with broken souls and broken bones
We use the tools we were given
The inheritors of the earth will take what we have failed to fix

All the world is broken
Our throats are open graves
Save your breath and pray for our safety, our safety

Take us away
Take us home
Throw us a line and bring us back

Throw us a line and bring us back
Take us away
Take us home

Take us away
Take us home
