We walk in crooked lines, waiting for someone to shine
This city is going down
With its liars and grim decay.
To show us light in these darkest days,
Brings in hope for the young to survive
We need a miracle to save the rest of us
We need some peace of mind to keep our sanity
This is all we ask for to keep our spirits high.
Show us that the good in us can rule our lives,
Show us that we will prevail.
Everything we've known was wasted
Everything we've known was useless
What we need is a new day
And some time to improve
What we think, might not be right
For there's evils that taunt our lives, day in and day out
Keep our guards up and keep them strong
This time around we'll do things right
We'll hold our heads up high
So now we're waking up to something, worth living every second for
And our dreams become reality, as we fight to prove our worth
(Anchored down with hope and a mindset to change the world)
Our minds are open for the changing, waiting for your call
As we slowly drift to our senses, there's no turning back
We are the foundation that holds this world up, together we will stand strong and never fall.
And here we stand up tall
We'll hold our heads up high.
We are the foundation that holds this world up, together we will stand strong and never fall.
