Give me a place to call my home
I've been wandering aimlessly since the day i was left behind
this choice was destined for me to take
a road i must travel alone.

Fear not, ive been sent to save you [x2]

I am the rescue, I am your saving grace [x2]

Tear apart the truth and find out what we're meant for
where will you stand when our worlds collide
take this straight to heart
keep this in your mind
if you think this is a joke, you will be left behind

Speak your mind though your voice may shake
the cautious dont live forever [x2]

im drifting...im drifting closer to you
im drifting...im drifting closer to you

and when it all comes down to this, you'll get what you deserve.
your not alone.

pray for me.

I am the rescue, I am your saving grace.
Open your eyes and let the light sink through
You'll make it, You'll make it, I swear, I swear.
I am the rescue, I am your saving grace.
(Straight from the lips of an angel, a message to clean up the broken, the wicked, the taken down)
