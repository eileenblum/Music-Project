[feat. Brandon Englehart of A King at Heart]We don't need anyone
To show us who we are
We don't need anyone
To show us who we are

We don't need anyone
To show us who we are
We don't need anyone
To show us who we are

I've spent too much time in such a terrible place
These people out to get you, such a fall from grace
It's not all sunshine and make-believe
The truth about a dream is to lie and deceive
I've done all I can
But it's time to carry on my own
I feel I've had enough
And I've worked my body to the bone

We don't need anyone
To show us who we are
We don't need anyone
To show us who we are
We don't need anyone
To show us who we are
We don't need anyone
To show us who we are

Who you are and where you belong
Separates a boy from a man
I'm done following along
I don't need a backup plan
I've done all that I can
But it's time to carry on my own
I feel I've had enough
I've worked my body to the bone

I used to find beauty in this world
Now I'm jaded and I can't find the cure
I'm jaded
I'm jaded and I hate it

We don't need anyone
To show us who we are
We don't need anyone
To show us who we are
We don't need anyone
To show us who we are
We don't need anyone
To show us who we are
(We don't need anyone)
We didn't need you then, and we don't need you now
(To show us who we are)
We may fall be we get up again
We'll do this on our own
(We don't need anyone)
And through the pain we'll show
(To show us who we are)
Above our mistakes, we will grow
