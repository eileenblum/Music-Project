Stay cold
Through all the dead ends
The one minute sensations and cheap imitations
Don't let your life become a passing trend

From empty spaces to the book of many faces
Is there any room for a beating heart in a digital wasteland?
It was broken from the start
We witnessed this firsthand
This was never the way it was supposed to be

I won't be a slave to the corporate machine
The tempting offers lead to darker things
When you wake up you will finally see
America, land of the third degree
I am dangerous
I am dangerous

Stay cold
Through all the dead ends
The one minute sensations and cheap imitations
Or am I just a passing trend?

From empty spaces to the book of many faces
Is there any room for a beating heart in a digital wasteland?
It was broken from the start
We witnessed this firsthand
This was never the way it was supposed to be
From empty spaces to the book of many faces
Is there any room for a beating heart in a digital wasteland?
It was broken from the start
We witnessed this firsthand
This was never the way it was supposed to be
