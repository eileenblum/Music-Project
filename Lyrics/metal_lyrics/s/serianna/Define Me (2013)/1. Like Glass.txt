My ears are listening, not knowing what about
Like a glass coffin not letting any light out
Sometimes I find myself with nowhere to go
Stuck in a nightmare that I can't outgrow

My eyes are bleeding, not knowing what about
The setting sun with names I can't make out
I've tried to change, to forget that day
Something I can't ignore, it's on replay

I scream for help but can't hear the call
Are you listening?
I scream for help but can't hear the call
Are you listening?

I can't forget who you were to me
You're the man I someday wish to be
The lessons learned have always set me free
I can't forget who you were to me
You're the man I someday wish to be
The lessons learned have always set me free

I can be anything I want to be
But all I want is you here next to me
I'm a lost sailor, trapped at sea
The ocean's deep, the dark so frightening

Give me a sign to let me know that you're there
I need to know there's more than despair

I can't forget who you were to me
You're the man I someday wish to be
The lessons learned have always set me free
I can't forget who you were to me
You're the man I someday wish to be
The lessons learned have always set me free

I scream for help but can't hear the call
Are you listening?
I scream for help but can't hear the call
Are you listening?
