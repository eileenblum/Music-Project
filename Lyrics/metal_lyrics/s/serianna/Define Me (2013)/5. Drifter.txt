I can't find a reason to hope
For anything else this time
Same old grind
Feeling I'm lost and starting to fall behind

Something's inside my head, telling me to give up
I'm being taken down, from the inside out
I'm nearly scared to death, trying to catch my breath
I'm choking on my grief living in constant doubt

I can't sleep, I can't breathe
Nothing is making sense to me

This world inside my head is run by my anxious thoughts
Give me peace or rest because I've had enough

I can't sleep, I can't breathe
Please help me, because I'm growing weak

I can't find a reason to hope
For anything else this time
Same old grind
Feeling I'm lost and starting to fall behind
