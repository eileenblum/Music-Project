[feat. Shawn Spann of I, the Breather]We've been to hell and back

I only asked for your dedication
While every step of the way
You took ruined our reputation

You couldn't see you're destroying your health
When all you had to do was be yourself

We always knew what you were thinking
Begging for attention, so deceiving
All you did was ruin your name
You inched your way to the top
But you never got your fame

Like a wound that has turned
I cut you off, to grind your way back to the top
I cut you off
I cut you, I cut you off

You were there from the beginning
Years spent and backs bleeding
Like an anchor rusted to the floor
You couldn't pull the line, always wanting more
