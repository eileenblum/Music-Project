[feat. Chad Ruhlig of For the Fallen Dreams]How dare you take advantage of me
I build myself up so all the world can see
But you drag me down from a higher standard
Living in your shadow, never moving forward

But now you've pushed me too far and you'll finally see
I have no problem exposing the man I can be

I've got something to say
I've got something to say

It eats me up inside
To know I mean nothing to you
You've said your piece
But doesn't make it easy to live through

You know I won't complain and do as you say
And that's what makes it easy to ruin my day
Especially when I'm targeted a mile away
So get the fuck out of my face

I will be heard
So don't make me say this twice
I will be heard
So don't make me say it twice
I'm fucking sick of being nice
I'm fucking sick of being nice
Fuck!
