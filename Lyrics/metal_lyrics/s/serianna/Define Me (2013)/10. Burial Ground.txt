They'd think we're better off dead
We're growing weak from the lies they've spread

In a world with no hope
You've got to make your own
Society is dead
This world is broken now

I'm a survivalist
Living in the unknown

I built my walls
And time will tell
If they stand tall
Will they hold back hell?
I built my walls
And time will tell
Which side I'm on
Am I in hell?

Women and children are the first to go
There's no need for mercy
Build an army from the grave down
This will be our undoing
This will be our undoing

When the time is now
Then your time is now
When the time is now
Then your time is now
When the time is now (when the time is now)
Then your time is now (then your time is now)
When the time is now (when the time is now)
Then your time is now (then your time is now)

I built my walls
And time will tell
If they stand tall
Will they hold back hell?
I built my walls (I built my walls)
And time will tell (time will tell)
Which side I'm on (side I'm on)
Am I in hell?

We won't survive
We won't survive
We won't survive
We won't survive

We won't survive (we won't survive)
We won't survive (we won't survive)
