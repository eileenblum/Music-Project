We worry so much about where we've been
And the things we've seen
That we seem to forget
Where we are or lose what we need
And the truth is...

I need you now
I need you by my side
I need to know that this will be alright

I can't seem to figure out
Where it all went wrong (where it all went wrong)
Through the thick and thin
We always made our way out
No matter what was said
We always kept it strong
And I had you
There was never any question or doubt

I'm not saying I'm perfect
I know we have been there before
Getting so wrapped up trying to reflect
Forgetting those I adore
And the truth is...

I need you now
I need you by my side
I need to know that this will be alright
I know you're gone for good
But I need to know
Do you still think of me? (do you still think of me?)
Do you still think of me when I think of you?

It seems like forever
Since I've heard you say the words you hate
It's been replaying in my head
And it kills me each and every day
"I support that you're doing what you love
But you were never here
You were never here, and he was"
