Can you see my wounds?
'Cause now I'm wearing them
My heart is on my sleeve
My story in my skin
I'm inching forward, till I can feel alive again

Look how far you've come by shutting out your friends (without your friends)
You've used our flesh and bone as a stepping stone (a stepping stone)
Look how far you've come, now who's the lonely one? (the lonely one)
You've used our flesh and bone and now you're on your own

It's OK honestly
You're just not welcome here
Gone as fast as you appeared
A ghost to us whispering in our ear
A shadow in the sea
A siren giving up on me
I thought you were my family

I'm not a backup plan
I'm gonna call your bluff
You treated me so second class
Like I'm not good enough
I wasn't good enough

Look how far you've come by shutting out your friends (without your friends)
You've used our flesh and bone as a stepping stone (a stepping stone)
Look how far you've come, now who's the lonely one? (the lonely one)
You've used our flesh and bone and now you're on your own

On your own
And now you're on your own
You're just a snake in the grass
An empty shell of the past

You've ruined your name, I won't hear your voice
I won't be your second choice

I won't be your second choice
I'm inching forward, till I can feel alive again

Look how far you've come by shutting out your friends (without your friends)
You've used our flesh and bone as a stepping stone (a stepping stone)
Look how far you've come, now who's the lonely one? (the lonely one)
You've used our flesh and bone and now you're on your own

On your own
