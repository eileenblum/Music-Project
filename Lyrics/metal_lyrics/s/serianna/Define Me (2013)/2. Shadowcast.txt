You fall asleep at night
Thinking everything is fine
The victims you had stepped on
Weren't worth a minute of your time

Day in and day out I'll make it personal, to prove
You're weak inside
You can't deny the demons haunt you
The demons haunt you

One day you'll wake up
And feel like you're all alone
You're dead inside from the look in your eye
To the people that you've never known
And I will be there this time around
But I will be there just to watch you drown

I'm sick inside but I know that you're worse
Preying on the innocent was always your curse
I will show the world the dark shadow you cast
I promise your fame will never outlast
The harm you've inflicted on the lives I knew
You're the paint, you're the sickness, and I'm coming to cure you

These demons haunt you
What lies are you telling me this time?
These demons haunt you
What secrets are you hiding behind your eyes? (your eyes, your eyes)

One day you'll wake up
And feel like you're all alone
You're dead inside from the look in your eye
To the people that you've never known
And I will be there this time around
But I will be there just to watch you drown

When I'm done with you
Every breath that you take
Will feel like your last
To ease every heart ache

You're weak inside
You can't deny the demons haunt you

One day you'll wake up
And feel like you're all alone
You're dead inside from the look in your eye
To the people that you've never known
And I will be there this time around
But I will be there just to watch you drown
