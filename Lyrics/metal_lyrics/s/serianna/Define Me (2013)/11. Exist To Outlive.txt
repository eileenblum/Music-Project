I sit scared looking back at life
From all the damage done
I shouldn't be alive
You never truly know fear
Until your vision fades and suddenly reappears

This weight can't hold me down
I will keep my feet on the ground

A wise man said that you only live one time
So I'm living each day putting my life on the line
I have so much to be grateful for
When every person I meet opens a brand new door
Oh, this life is a precious gift
Don't take it away
Don't take it away

All of this means nothing without you
Through all of this
You're my anchor to hold to

I'm alive because you believe in me
I feel like a blind man who can finally see
When life flashed before my eyes
It was you, trying to say goodbye
But I'm here to stay
I couldn't let this go away

And I'm sick of not knowing why
I walked away when death was so close by
This life we've made means everything to me
My life is here, there's nowhere I'd rather be
I'm here to stay
I'm here

A wise man said that you only live one time
So I'm living each day putting my life on the line
I have so much to be grateful for
When every person I meet opens a brand new door
Oh, this life is a precious gift
Don't take it away
Don't take it away
A wise man said that you only live one time
So I'm living each day putting my life on the line
I have so much to be grateful for
When every person I meet opens a brand new door
Oh, this life is a precious gift
Don't take it away
Don't take it away
Don't take it away
