No life to be envied
We look down on you,
We poses an essence your averse to
We are substance, unlike you,
The ability to see through you
Your no paragon of virtue,
Like a shard of jadded glass
You pierce the skin and bleed us through.

I takes time, to see you, for who you, really are
Reflections, of hatred, that graze life's, lonely scar.

Do unto others, as they world would do to you
Hypocrite, dictating that smothers,
No paragon of virtue

It takes time, to see you, for who you, really are
Reflections, of hatred, that graze life's, lonely scar.

No traits to be envied,
Deceiver through and through
Set the test you would fail yourself,
Unprincipled and cruel

Wee see you and we breath you, we live you,
Think as you do
We waken and we see clear,
We learn not to be like you

It takes time, to see you, for who you, really are
Reflections, of hatred, that graze life's, lonely scar.

Do unto others, as they would do to you
Hypocrite, dictating that smothers,
No paragon of Virtue
