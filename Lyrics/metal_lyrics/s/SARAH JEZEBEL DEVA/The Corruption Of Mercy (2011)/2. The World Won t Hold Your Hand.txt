As life shines on your skin,
There's always a reason to give in.
Is there no fight left in you?
The world can't hold your hand!
Forget bitter words, make your stand.
Is there no passion left in you?

This is your life,
Don't waste away!
Wake up inside,
Don't fade away!
This is your life !
Don't waste away!
Wake up inside!
Don't fade away!

As trouble seeps from your skin,
You wonder why you shouldn't give in.
You only have yourself to blame!
The world can't hold your hand!
The world won't hold your hand!

This is your life,
Don't waste away!
Wake up inside,
Don't fade away!
This is your life!
Don't waste away!
Wake up inside!
Don't fade away!

Find the time to realize...
You have it all, read between the lines!
Not everything is black and white,
Don't pick apart and criticize!

As trouble seeps from your skin,
Your wonder why you shouldn't give in.
You only have yourself to blame!
The world can't hold your hand!
The would won't hold your hand!
The world can't hold your hand!
The world won't hold your hand!
