When you wake, its all you see,
The banshee fiend "She comes for me" !
Close your eyes, don't look outside,
Beneath your window late at night,
No myth she's real, her hand's wont heal,
No one to save you from your ordeal
Heart beats show, its that dying pace,
My fate she'll seal, her death list graced.

Unable to speak, unable to tell,
Windows of the souls and so tragedies befell
Unable to speak, unable to tell, the lip that drips,
Tales of the foulest hell.
Unable to speak, unable to tell,
Windows of the souls and so tragedies befell
Unable to speak, unable to tell, the lip that drips,
Tales of the foulest hell.

Scream silently, only you can hear
Scream silently, only you can hear

Unable to speak, unable to tell,
Windows of the souls and so tragedies befell
Unable to speak, unable to tell, the lip that drips,
Tales of the foulest hell.
Unable to speak, unable to tell,
Windows of the souls and so tragedies befell
Unable to speak, unable to tell, the lip that drips,
Tales of the foulest hell.

Scream silently, only you can hear
Scream silently, only you can hear

When you wake, its all you see,
The banshee fiend "She comes for me" !
Close your eyes, don't look outside,
Beneath your window late at night,
No myth she's real, her hand's wont heal,
No one to save you from your ordeal
Heart beats show, its that dying pace,
My fate she'll seal, her death list graced.
