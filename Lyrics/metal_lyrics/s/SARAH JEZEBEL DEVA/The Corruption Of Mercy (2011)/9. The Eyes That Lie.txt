The eyes, that lied to me, mislead me to believe
That it, was I who was, going insane
Lost, the eyes I trust, the eyes that lied to me
So cold, in your house of lust, no love, just cruelty

The eyes, that lied to me, mislead me to believe
That it, was I who was, going to feel the pain
Lost, the lips is trust, the tongue that lies to me
So bold, your house of disgust, no truth, just falsity.

[Chorus]
Speaks his mind when ears are closed,
Face to face truth unexposed
Speaks his mind, when ears are closed, the eyes that lie.
[x2]

Eyes, that cried for me, mislead me to believe
That it, was me who was, safe within these walls
Lost, my sanity, tales to keep me near
So cold, your voice is no, longer recognize

[Chorus x2]
