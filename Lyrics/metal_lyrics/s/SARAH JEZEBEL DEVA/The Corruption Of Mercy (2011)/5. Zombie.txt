[The Cranberries Cover]

Another head hangs lowly, child is slowly taken.
And the violence caused silence,
Who are we mistaken ?

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family.
In your head, in your head they are fighting,
With their tanks and their bombs, and their bombs and their guns.
In your head, in your head, they are crying...

In your head, in your head,
Zombie, zombie, zombie,
Hey, hey. What's in your head,
In your head,
Zombie, zombie, zombie
Hey, hey, hey, hey,....
Another mother's breakin',heart is taking over.
When the violence causes silence,
We must be mistaken.

It's the same old theme since nineteen-sixteen.
In your head, in your head they're still fighting,
With their tanks and their bombs, and their bombs and their guns.
In your head, in your head, they are dying...

In your head, in your head,
Zombie, zombie, zombie,
Hey, hey, hey.
What's in your head,
In your head,
Zombie, zombie, zombie
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh...
