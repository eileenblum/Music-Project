Nothings on TV ? Your house is empty ?
So you come to me ?
Scroll through the names, time for fun and games ?
So you come to me ?
No one is picking up ?
You only call me when your lonely

No love in this room, let's loosen up with whiskey
I will lay where others have displayed before me
Its easier to swallow knowing I'm on your list
Your sheets smell of victims, am I number 13 ?

You won't last long, you never do,
I need more whiskey to get me through.
So overrated, should have been sedated,
I'd rather watch paint dry !
Fill in the gaps

No emotional traps
Close the door when I leave
Who is the next one you'll deceive ?

You won't last long, you never do, I need more
Whiskey to got the through.
So overrated, should have been sedated,
I'd rather watch paint dry !
