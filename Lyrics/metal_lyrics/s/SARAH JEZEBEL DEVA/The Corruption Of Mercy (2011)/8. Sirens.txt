"Sing to me, seductress come to me,
Lure me, infectious harmony"

Death calls, disturb a hungry sea
The wind shall carry me, into your arms
Your voice is fatally guiding me, lost sirens bury me
Still waters be my grave

"Mislead me, into false security
Toxic, your beauty drowning me,
My savour ? seductress come to me,
Lure, me, my silent tragedy".
Death calls, disturbs a hungry sea
The wind shall carry me, into your arms
Your voice is fatally guiding me, lost sirens bury me
Still waters be my grave
