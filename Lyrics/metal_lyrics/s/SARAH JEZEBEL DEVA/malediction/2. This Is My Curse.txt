Images infused in me, humans inspire atrocities
This, this is my curse, A curse I can not reverse
Screams infused my memory, man he kill only for greed
This, this is my curse, A curse, I can not reverse

Languishing this night
In a scene of horror
There's a fear that weights on my heart
That tomorrow never comes
Where the sun touched the bars with the promise of release
Lights catch the filth, the blood, the screams
Of the thousands who suffer as one

For your vanity, my skin is slit and torn from me,
It feeds the yen for your diseased industry
Wash away the blood stained grounds
Still breathing, misery resounds
Free me, I have no voice!

My skin, I was comfortable in
Till your thirst to "stand out"
You sealed my fate
Affliction, my pelt, your addiction
Carcasses surround me
My blood on your hands...

Images infused in me, humans inspire atrocities
This, this is my curse, A curse I can not reverse
Screams infused my memory, man he kill only for greed
This, this is my curse, A curse, I can not reverse

I bleed
Broken and inert
For a fur flung about cold shoulders
Skinned alive and left to moulder
Why does your make up have to hurt?

In this cold iron crate, I await my fate
No idea what's awaiting me but I smell hate
