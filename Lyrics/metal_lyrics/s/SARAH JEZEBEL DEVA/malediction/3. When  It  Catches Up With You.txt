Searching for a way to, end this hindrance
She sheds a tear, such an inconvenience
To you, your life, your plans, how selfish of her
Burden? Is she? Should never have got this close to her

For years, she searched, you liger, for the world to see,
It's so clear, you do not want to be found, but she found you, confronted you, bang in 
your face, Put you in your place
This burden, she carried, all alone... she's on her own

Never, forget, she said, what we had here
Can not, scape, choices, that you made dear
Your blind, if you, think it, truly ends here
He runs, avoids, past words, spun lines so insincere

So she found you, you liger, for the world to see,
It's so clear, you do not want to be found, but she found you, confronted you, bang in 
your face, Put you in your place
This burden, I carried, all alone... on my own

It's in your face, I said my piece, I'm in your face, you will never forget me now...
It's in your face, I said my piece, I'm in your face, you will never forget me now...
It's in your face, I said my piece, I'm in your face, you will never forget me now...
It's in your face, I said my piece, I'm in your face, you will never forget me now...
It's in your face, I said my piece, Now be a man, my burden is yours to share...
It's in your face, I said my piece, Now be a man, my burden is yours to share...
