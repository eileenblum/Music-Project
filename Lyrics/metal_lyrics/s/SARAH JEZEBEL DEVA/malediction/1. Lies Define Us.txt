I'll close my eyes and count to ten
But I will find you, I'm right behind you
Face to face, there's no safe place
Seas may divide us, Karma it blinds us

Out of your depth, pretend that you regret
Don't drop your guard now, there's no way out now
Does she know all about me?
Are we clouded with secrecy?

Keep your enemies close, keep me close to hand
I am one to watch, do you know who I am?
Our lies will unfold
You can deny I exist, I'll keeo following you
Till you acknowledge me and all that we do
Excuses, they grow old

Fame divides us, lies define us, deny us? Karma will find us

Keep your enemies close, keep me close to hand
I am one to watch, do you know who I am?
Our lies will unfold
You can deny I exist, I'll keeo following you
Till you acknowledge me and all that we do
Excuses, they grow old
