I descended from her witcherous womb
From the stun she resided on that hallow moon
She clawed the walls as they cut the chord
To drown at first breath she was assured
Her torturous acts from her gutless tomb
Blind eyes they turned as they fled the room
Submerged in guilt this wicked shrew
As a thorn in her side, so the baby she threw
Illness invades the vain of a lady so drenched in pain
Cold is a shallow stare, with blood she draws without a care
A passion to scald her young, her story remains unsung
It's that loving hand upon your face that keeps you in your place.

Vicious little bitch, she'd have burnt as a witch,
as predicted she inflicted with disastrous twist,
with her malicious tale unsung, she provoked in many tongues,
they called her lady tyranny

Come, mother leave it be, let those demons sleep...
Burn mother, let us be... for our loss you shall not reap...
For what you cruelly sow... They called you lady tyranny.

Relives her fears with a skin stained belt, its a feeling like you've never felt
To watch her flesh and blood deflate, agony reflects glass eyes dilate
Remorse an emotion that rarely shows but anger and hate
in her cheeks they glow
To drown me at birth, a task never done, pray not to wake to the nightmare she spun.

Vicious little bitch, she'd have burnt as a witch, as predicted she inflicted with disastrous twist,
With revenge waiting at her door, beating on the child she bore, they called her lady tyranny

Come, mother leave it be, let those demons sleep...
Burn mother, let us be... for our loss you shall not reap...
For what you cruelly sow... They call you lady tyranny.

The anger biting back at you,
Just a reflection of life once knew,
It pains you to admit what you are,
Parental wounds seep a hideous scar.

Come, mother leave it be, let those demons sleep...
Burn mother, let us be... for our loss you shall not reap...
For what you cruelly sow... They blamed you lady tyranny.
