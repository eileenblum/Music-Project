Your mother don't stop crying don't ask me why,
And your family don't stop asking questions
Maybe she's lonely cos daddy's never there
And whenever he is there's always tension.

You sit in the corner cos you've got no friends
and you're scared someone will beat you,
hey ! Let's play happy families and pretend
that someone needs you.

Daddy's not coming home
Cos daddy's found someone

Tell you little stories your desire to hear
But cover your eyes to block the screaming,
Mother works nights to pay the bill's
But lies can't hide the drink and bruising

You sit in darkness cos no one is there
To witness all the pain their inflicting,
So close your eyes and drift away
Life is always better when you're sleeping.

Daddy's not coming home
Cos daddy's found someone

Sleep, close your eyes
Fall, I will catch you,
Sleep, close your eyes
Fall, I will catch you... I will catch...
I will catch you.
