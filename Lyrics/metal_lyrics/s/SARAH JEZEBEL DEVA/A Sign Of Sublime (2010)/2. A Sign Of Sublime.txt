Kneel to me, cum unto me
Show me what this can be
I'm open, ease my flow
Scrapping of the tongues below

I scratch down your back, A sign of sublime
The itch of the twitch, our internal rhyme,
Take what you see, expect nothing of me
This silky flesh, a pulse beckons thee

Hands that slide, no emotion to hide,
A flick of a lick, your will shall subside,
No guilt for this lechary
Untamed are your eyes burned deep into me

I scratch down your back, A sign of sublime
The itch of the twitch, our internal rhyme,
Take what you see, expect nothing of me
This silky flesh, a pulse beckons thee

A salt, that stains my lips
Gently ease the hips
Bind into our sign of sublime
