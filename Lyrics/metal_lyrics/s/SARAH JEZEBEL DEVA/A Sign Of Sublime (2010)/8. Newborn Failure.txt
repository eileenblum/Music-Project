This life, That grew inside of you
This life, Became a part of you
A life, That breathes with every breath
you take, a path you choose to desecrate.

This life, It bleed inside of you
This life, It died inside of you
A life, that ceased to live with every
breath you didn't take, that life inside
was your will to live.
Life Dies in your eyes
