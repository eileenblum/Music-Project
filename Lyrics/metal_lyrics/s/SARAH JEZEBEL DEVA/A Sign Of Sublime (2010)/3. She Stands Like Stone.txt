The anger that compels her, drives her to survive
For all that we are, there's nothing left to hide
Everything that screams inside forces her to strive
For all she loves and believes, she'll change the life we once knew

Mother earth, wake up, help us to see
That everything we touch, destroys your beauty
One day, there'll be nothing left
You showed us, just what life should be
This is your time, take away our free will

Guide us, lead us back to the ground

Mother earth, wake up, help us to see
That everything we touch, destroys your beauty
One day, there'll be nothing left
You showed us, just what life should be
This is your time, take away our free will
Guide us, lead us back to the ground

How much life must die before we open our eyes
How much time is left before our demise
Everything that screams inside of you we ignore
We take, give nothing back, you will change the life we once knew

Mother earth, wake up, help us to see
That everything we touch, destroys your beauty
One day, there'll be nothing left
You showed us, just what life should be
This is your time, take away our free will
Guide us, lead us back to the ground
