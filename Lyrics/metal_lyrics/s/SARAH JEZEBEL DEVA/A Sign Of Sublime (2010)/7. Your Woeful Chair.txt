Frail is a bitter man
He sits in his woeful chair
Searching for the answer to his life
Hatred grounds him in his despair

Anger doesn't care for time
In years to come you'll see
Your woeful chair, still remains
While you have drowned in your misery

Seek the truth and you will find
A shallow man so left behind
Open your eyes
Stubborn is the man who'll fall
You can do no wrong...
Open your eyes

Lost is a bitter man
Mankind his only enemy
Can't seem to leave the past behind
Broken man knows no sincerity

His lonely chair, his only friend
Denial shields his eyes
The smile he wears is all pretend
Inside this old man dies

Seek the truth and you will find
A shallow man so left behind
Open your eyes
Stubborn is the man who'll fall
You can do no wrong...
Open your eyes
