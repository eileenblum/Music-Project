Gehenna-Rising

Pious burden so revealing
Preachers teaching so deceiving
He compels you, then exploits your soul

Subversion, your life's error

Gently screaming theres no bleeding
Gently dying theres no breathing

So you search for the sign
Blinded by their spoken lies
Place the truth within your hands
Now the truth burns your eyes

Try to floor these fragile words
But we gather here as one
Confusion roams the herds
Holy souls misled the sun
