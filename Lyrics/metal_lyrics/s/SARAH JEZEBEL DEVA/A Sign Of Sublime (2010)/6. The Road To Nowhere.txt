Found harmony in life's adversity, what will bloom, will surely die... give up the ghost

Now you turn your back on me... where now... I'm on the road to nowhere
It's a silent path I'll make... where now... do I go from here

Heaven was in your arms... hell was when we were apart... now I am alone

Now you turn your back on me... how so ? I ended up on this road to nowhere

Empty is the bed where you lie... its cold when there's no one to hold

Spend your life looking back at me, you lead yourself to the road of nowhere
You won't save what you lost, time will tell, memories of me haunt you on the road to nowhere.
