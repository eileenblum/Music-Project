[Lyrics: Igor Cavalera]
[Music: Andreas Kisser, Derrick Green, Igor Cavalera]

Your Green Is For Money
My Green Is For Land
Shut Off My Eyes
Clog Up My Ears
Cut Off My Tongue
You'll Still Hear Me Coming

My Blood Is Thicker
My Pain Will Rise
Boycott My Ideas
Fueled With The Hate I Feel
Infiltrated With The Lies
That You're Feeding Me

One Man Army

Our Strength's Your Weakness
Our Truth's Your Lies
Shut Off My Eyes
Clog Up My Ears
Cut Off My Tongue
You'll Still Hear Me Coming

Surrounded By Mistrust
Trapped In Your Mind
All You Hear Is - What You Fear And
All You Fear Is - What You Don't Know
All You Know Is - What You See
And What You See Won't Last Forever

One Man Army

Our Truth Will Echo And Echo Forever
Tormenting You Forever And Ever

You'll Still Hear Me Coming Through To You

Boycott My Ideas
Fueled With The Hate I Feel
Infiltrated With The Lies
That You're Feeding Me

One Man And I'm Coming For You
