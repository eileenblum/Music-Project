The Senseless Painted Room, Excuses From The
Sky
Compassion For Nothing, Purity Was A Lie
Our Souls Have Wounds, Our Sons Will Touch
The Breath Of Life, For All Mankind

By The Faith Of God, Let Me Be My Name
In The Name Of God, Let Me Live My Faith

To Instigate A Fear That Resides In You
The Mystery Of Each And Every One Of Us
Trust To Trust, Teeth To Teeth
Lying Low, Near The Sky

By The Faith Of God, Let Me Be My Name
In The Name Of God, Let Me Live My Faith

Under The Ways Of Faith, Can I Live?

Sacrifice Is Made In Holy Wars
Covered In Blood, The Path We Walked Before

Seeds In Sacred Soil No Longer Grow
Can I Live Without You Killing Me

Under The Ways Of Faith, Can I Live?
