from dehumanisation to arms production
for the benefit of the nation or it's destruction
power is power
it's the law of the land
those who live for death
will die by their own hands
life is no ordeal if you can come to terms
reject the system which dictates the norm
 from dehumanization to arms production
for the benefit of the nation or it's destruction
it's your choice!
Peace or annihilation!

Annihilation is to one, the means to an end
Armageddon, the war to end all wars, the extremists' end

annihilation annihilation annihilation
destruction destruction destruction

streets are on fire, death in our wake, cars overturned, bodies are raped

You go on preaching religious dogma, while paying for and sanctioning vicious murder

annihilation annihilation annihilation, praise
destruction destruction destruction

streets are on fire, death in our wake, cars overturned, seen it before
Annihilation is to one, the means to an end
Armageddon, the war to end all wars
The extremists' end

playing with people's lives using their minds
you want total control
stay in the line

annihilation, annihilation, judgement day
Armageddon
Armageddon
Are you going to let them blow you away
