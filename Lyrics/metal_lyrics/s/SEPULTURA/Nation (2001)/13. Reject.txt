The Dreams Of Wealth
A Common Fantasy
They're Only Illusions
You See Them On TV

They Think They Know Everything About Us
Don't Think They Ever Will
Make A Move In The Wrong Direction
Don't Try To Label Us Dead

Confuse What I Think..

Do You Know What's Wrong?
I Don't Know What's Wrong
We Want To Be Free!
We Have To Reject!

Whose Lives Are We Living?
How Many People Are Led?
To Believe Break Your Back For A Buck
Don't Ever Think It Will End

Confuse What I Think!

Do You Know What's Wrong?
I Don't Know What's Wrong
We Want To Be Free!
We Have To Reject!

The Dreams Of Wealth
A Common Fantasy
They're Only Illusions
You See Them On TV

Whose Lives Are We Living?
How Many Are Led?
In The Wrong Direction
Try To Label Us Dead
