Intense Fiercing War, Insult No Tolerance
Against One Rule, To Fit 'Em All
To Blur My Eyes Already Blind
To Keep My Hands From Moving Free

The Pulse Of What We Live, The Hate We Build
Inside
Create My Shield, To Fight Them All
They See The Things They Can Not Be
To Understand They Can't Be Free

No Surrender - Still Unhurt, We Fly

We Learned The Way How To Be Real
What We Say We Live
It Keeps Me Sane To Embrace Our Will
And Go Against Inhumanity

My Saga, My Saga - Battle In The Fields Of Fear
Attack Defend - It's Never Over
My Saga, My Saga - No Regrets

It Doesn't Matter Where You Are
Do What You Can With What You Have
It Doesn't Matter Where You Are
Do What You Can With What You Have

No Surrender - Still Unhurt, We Fly

We Learned The Way How To Be Real
What We Say We Live
It Keeps Me Sane To Embrace Our Will
And Go Against Inhumanity

My Saga, My Saga - Battle In The Fields Of Fear
Attack Defend - It's Never Over
My Saga, My Saga - No Regrets
