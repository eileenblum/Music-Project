White on white
translucent black capes

Back on the rack
Back on the rack

The bats have left
the bell tower
The victims have
have been bled
Red velvet lines

the blackened box
the blackened box

Bela Lugosi's dead
Undead undead undead

The virginal brides file past his tomb

Strewn with time's dead flowers

Bereft in deathly bloom
Alone in a
darkened room
The count
The count

Bela Logosi's dead
Undead undead undead...
