Jealous cowards try to control
rise above
we're gonna rise above
they distort what we say
rise above
we're gonna rise above
try and stop what we do
rise above
we're gonna rise above
when they can't do it themselves
rise above
we're gonna rise above

we are tired of your abuse
try to stop us it's no use

society's arms of control
rise above
we're gonna rise above
think they're smart
can't think for themselves
rise above
we're gonna rise above
laugh at us
behind our backs
rise above
we're gonna rise above
I find satisfaction
in what they lack
rise above
we're gonna rise above

we are tired of your abuse
try to stop us it's no use

we are tired of your abuse
try to stop us it's no use

we were born with a chance
rise above
we're gonna rise above
I am gonna have my chance
rise above
we're gonna rise above

we were born with a chance
rise above
we're gonna rise above
I am gonna have my chance
rise
rise
rise above
rise above
rise above
rise above
rise above
