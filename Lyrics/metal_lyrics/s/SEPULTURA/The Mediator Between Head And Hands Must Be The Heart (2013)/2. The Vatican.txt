A bloody revolution in the name and love of Christ
Sadistic pedophile, abusers of lies and lust
The power of the church over men's intellect
A story of sacred swords - the darkest age of mankind

Reign of dark skies, walls of death and silence!

Alexander VI - Boniface VIII - Pius IX
John XXIII - Damasus I - Pius XII

Reign of dark skies, walls of death and silence!

A disgrace to the chair of Peter, in the ways of violent deaths
Banquets and evil orgies in the heart the holy see
Indulgence from the bank for the works of religion
Conspiracies and corruption are leading us to the end

Reign of dark skies, walls of death and silence!

Alexander VI - Boniface VIII - Pius IX
John XXIII - Damasus I - Pius XII

Crusaders, the knights of sacrifice
Purveyors the death of change
Crusaders, the knights of sacrifice
Dictators of change

Reign of dark skies, walls of death and silence!
