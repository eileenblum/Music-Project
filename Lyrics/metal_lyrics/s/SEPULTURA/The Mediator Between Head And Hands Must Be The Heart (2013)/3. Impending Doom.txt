Crawling through ages in search of dignity
Stained with the backlash of filth we call humanity

Brother, what have we done?!

Draining the life force of anything within our grasp
Selfless needs and dirty deeds
We leave nothing to chance at all

Mother, what have we done?!
Father, what have we done?!

Creating a wasteland we sink slowly awaiting death
Born to suffer, live to kill, our motto of all mankind

Brother, what have we done?!
