Lost our way! Fell from grace!
Fell from grace! Lost our way!

Ahh, there's no good reason
Ahh, to live in darkness
We slip we fall - stand by it all
Sick of the filth - our world decay

Lost our way! We fell from grace!
Fell from grace! We lost our way!
Stronger, fearless - changing it over
No more silence - push our way

Ahh, you didn't make us
Ahh, in the end we'll save us
The bliss is gone - you awake to see
Our choice to be - brought back belief

We live our time - must wake and find
The facts all sides - our freedom now!
Our freedom now!
