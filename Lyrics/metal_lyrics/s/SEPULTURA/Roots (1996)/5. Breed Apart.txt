Creepy crawl
On concrete and dust
Asphalt jungle
Piles of crust

Non sense thoughts
Inside the mind
What really means
What I want ?

Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way

Straight old thoughts
To force you down
Raping rape
Breed apart

Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way

Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
