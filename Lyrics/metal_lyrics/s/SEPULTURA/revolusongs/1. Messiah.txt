[Originally performed by Hellhammer]

This our way, we can not turn.
We've reached our time, this world must burn.

Messiah

Judgement day, no guilt
Our task, let us pray
six six six, in the works
demon seed, invades the earth

Messiah

This our way, we can not turn.
We've reached our time, this world must burn.
Knowlege lost, there is no shame.
This our way, we can not turn.

Messiah
