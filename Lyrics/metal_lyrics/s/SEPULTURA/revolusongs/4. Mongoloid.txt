[Originally performed by Devo]

mongoloid he was a mongoloid
happier than you and me
mongoloid he was a mongoloid
and it determined what he could see
mongoloid he was a mongoloid
one chromosome too many
mongoloid he was a mongoloid
and it determined what he could see
and he wore a hat
and he had a job
and he brought home the bacon
so that no one knew
mongoloid he was a mongoloid
his friends were unaware
mongoloid he was a mongoloid
nobody even cared
