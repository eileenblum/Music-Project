Sepultura under my skin [2x]

This pride no one can fake or take
Always stayed true to our beliefs
We love what we do with attitude and dedication

Sepultura under my skin [2x]

All of you bearing the mark
We salute you with all of our heart
We're strong
Together we're strong
With you all we're never alone

Sepultura under my skin [2x]
