[Lyrics: Andreas]

SACRIFICE IS PLEASURE
WHEN LIFE ENDS IN PAIN
CONCEIVE THE LAST MISTAKE
WHICH BELONGS TO ALL

CREATION OF INSANE RULE
ALL WE HEAR:
DESPERATE CRY

DEATH THE COLDEST WIND
SEEPS INTO YOUR PORES
A NATION BORN OF HATE
FORGOTTEN DISTANT TIME

CREATION OF INSANE RULE
ALL WE HEAR:
DESPERATE CRY

ENDLESS EMPTY MAZE
DESPAIR, DISTRESS AND SILENCE
A POISON VACUUM, INFINITY
LIFE, LIES, DECEIT

MUTE SOULS END IN SILENCE
OCEANS TAINTED WITH BLOOD
EMPTY PROMISES OF HOPE
BURIED DEEP, INFECTED GROUND

CREATION OF INSANE RULE
ALL WE HEAR:
DESPERATE CRY

CRY!
