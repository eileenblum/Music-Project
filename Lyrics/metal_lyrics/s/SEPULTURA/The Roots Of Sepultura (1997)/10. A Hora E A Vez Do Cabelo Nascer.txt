Venha ver as minhas cores
Ah, t? na hora do cabelo nascer
Hasteei o meu cabelo
Ah, para que o sol fique sabendo das coisas

O meu cabelo ? verde e amarelo
Violeta e transparente
A minha caspa ? de purpurina
Minha barba azul anil

[translation:]
The Hour And The Time For Growing Hair (Mutantes)

Come to see my colors
Ah, it's the hour for growing hair
I hoisted my hair
Ah, so that the sun is knowing what's going on

My hair is green and yellow
purple and transparent
ah, my hair what a desease
my beard is navy blue

[Nascer'. This song is actually in Portuguese, but Sepultura covered it in]
