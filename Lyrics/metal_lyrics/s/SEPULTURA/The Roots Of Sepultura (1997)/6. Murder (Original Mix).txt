[Lyrics: Max]

CHAOTIC VIOLENCE IN MY EYES
THIS WHOLE WORLD MOVES BACKWARDS
PEACE, ANOTHER SIGN THAT LIES
LIFE TODAY IS NOT WORTH THE PAIN

ON THE RADIO, ANOTHER HOMICIDE
INMATES SUFFOCATE IN JAIL
SEVERED HEADS OF REVOLT
I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN

SAME HAND THAT BUILDS - DESTROYS
SAME HAND THAT RELIEVES - BETRAYS
SAME HAND THAT SEEDS - BURNS
SAME PEACE THAT EXISTS - HERE LIES

I CAN'T TRUST ANYMORE
CRIMINALS WITHIN THE LAW
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
WHERE I LIVE, DON'T BELIEVE IN ANOTHER DAY

HERESY AND GRAFT
APARTHEID
SAME RELIGION THAT SAVES - DAMNS YOU!
