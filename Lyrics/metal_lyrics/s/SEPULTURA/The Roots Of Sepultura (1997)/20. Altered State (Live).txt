[Lyrics: Andreas]

FEAR IN MY SUBCONSCIOUS
TERROR INVADES MY SPEECH
FAITH IN MY OWN WORDS
NO ONE KNOWS THE NAMELESS

WARM WINDS AND BURNING TEARS
SPIRITS OUTSIDE BODIES

ENDLESS REPRESSION BY MAJORITY
A MASTER WITHOUT COMMAND
STRANGE NEW DIMENSION DISTURBING MY BRAIN
CENSORED IDEAS, COUNTERFEIT ANSWERS

SHINING BLAST, NO PERCEPTION
ALTERED STATE, NO REACTION
SHINING BLAST
ALTERED STATE

SLOW TALK, FAST THOUGHTS
ANCIENT SCRIPTURES
CONTROVERSIAL LINES
KNOWLEDGE CHANGES

RUNNING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
CROSSING WITH BLIND EYES
I'M CLOSER TO MYSELF
SANITY CAN'T INVADE
