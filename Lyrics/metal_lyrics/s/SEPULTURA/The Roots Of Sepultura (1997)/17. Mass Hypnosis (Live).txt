LOOKING INSIDE, YOUR FUTURE UNCERTAIN
THE FEAR GROWS AS A SICKNESS UNCURED
THE SILENCE AGONIZES, THE WORDS SOUND STRONG
LOOK INSIDE THE EYES, LEAVE THIS WORLD
HATE THROUGHT THE ARTERIES
MASS HYPNOSIS
UNCERTAIN OF BEING BACK
THEYU MAKE YOU FEEL SO GOOD
EVERYTHING'S DARKENED
OBEY LIKE A FOOL
HATE THROUGHT THE ARTERIES
MASS HYPNOSIS
SOLDIERS GOING NOWHERE
BELIEVERS KNEELING OVER THEIR SINS
INHUMAN INSTINCT OF COWARDLY LEADERS
MAKE THE WORLD GO THEIR OWN WAY
TENS OF THOUSANDS HYPNOTIZED
TRYING TO FIND A REASON WHY
LOOK INSIDE YOUR EMPTY EYES
OBEY 'TILL THE END
LOOKING INSIDE, YOUR FUTURE UNCERTAIN
THE FEAR GROWS AS A SICKNESS UNCURED
THE SILENCE AGONIZES, THE WORDS SOUND STRONG
LOOK INSIDE THE EYES, LEAVE THIS WORLD
HATE THROUGHT THE ARTERIES
MASS HYPNOSIS
SOLDIERS GOING NOWHERE
SOLDIERS BLINDED BY THEIR FAITH
