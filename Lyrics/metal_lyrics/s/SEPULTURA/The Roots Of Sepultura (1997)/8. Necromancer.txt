[demo version]

The misfits high
In this night
Can feel the presence of death
Way to the
Mortuary
So the dead's will invoke
Corpses and skulls
In my countour
See a corpse blood
With the face
In cruciform
Now begins for the wrath
Catch the skulls
Of a children
Frozen and dismal
Coming with me
Creature
Kill in name of Hell
The black mess
Is started
Lifes will terminate
With the wrath
Of the demons
Started the genocide
Wrath
In my corpus is born
Death
Lost legions from Hell
Slaughter
You'll see in sacrifice
Skulls
Are christians with blood
Necromancer
Deads invoker
Necromancer
Deads invoker
Wrath, odious, desire
In my corpus is born
The fates last, terror's spread
For a necros creature of
The crypts
