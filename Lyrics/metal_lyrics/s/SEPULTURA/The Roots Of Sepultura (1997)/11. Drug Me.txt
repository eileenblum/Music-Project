I don't want to think, give me balls, go with my friends.
Can't come up with anything, my brain needs stimulation.

Drug me, drug me, drug me, drug me.

I'm so fucking tired, got it waiting for us, gotta stay.
T.V. and girls, third world, make more to store.

Drug me, drug me, drug me, look out.

Drug me, natural vitamin C.
Drug me, pharmaceutical speed.
Drug me with your sleeping pills.
Drug me with your crossword puzzles.
Drug me with your magazines.
Drug me with your fuck machines.
All fake, fuck it away.

Finally off of work, another potato-chip weekend.
Go away, go away, go, leave me alone, can't see myself.

Drug me, drug me, drug me.
