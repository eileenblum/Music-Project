Forward - CanÂ´t stop to pace my steps
Onward - Never stood for second best

IÂ´m relentless, I am always
I wont let this die
No words - Is not the life which I have led

IÂ´m relentless - I want vengeance

Slow burn - Only got what I have done
Progress - To under take the task at hand

IÂ´m relentless, I am always
I wont let this die
Timeless â Unscathed with attitude

IÂ´m relentless - I want vengeance
