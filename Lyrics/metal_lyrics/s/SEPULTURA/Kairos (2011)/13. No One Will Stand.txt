We defend what we believe
Under attack no matter what
Respect what we have achieved
The enemy is scared but won't admit
We fight to conquer total ground
We hear no lies, we fear no threats
I trust my brothers at my side
Together we face the battle ahead

We fight   We kill   No one will stand

My army is formed and the focus is set
No stepping back our path is clear
Culture reigns no man will fail
A crucial win a deadly dance
We fight to conquer total ground
We hear no lies, we fear no threats
I trust my brothers at my side
Together we face the battle ahead

We fight   We kill   No one will stand

Live for the day, all or nothing

My army is formed and the focus is set
No stepping back our path is clear
Culture reigns no man will fail
A crucial win a deadly dance

Live for the day, all or nothing   Attack!

Our hearts in our hands, our mind in our soul
Live for the day, all or nothing
