never lost sight of my fate
Many tried to block my ways but persistence kept me going on
Now we trespass the line of time
Going back but IÂ´m right here, now and then, all done

Kairos

Wake the dream and face the facts
Bridge the gap between the gaps
In every blast that starts your mind
You are there and only there you are

Kairos

The lines are crossed IÂ´m way ahead
Just need to balance the razorÂ´s edge
Nothing can stop us right now
Cause it was built from what we gave. ThatÂ´s right!

Kairos
