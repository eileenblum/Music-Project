Through these eyes we shook the world
Through these eyes we fought the world

Through these eyes we shock the world
No fear at all went head strong
Aggravations, hostility
But thereÂ´s a difference, we are free

In my eyes a line divided
So choose a side and stand united
Divide and fall, reflections of what we have done
ThereÂ´s no shame, but thereÂ´s is pride

Fought for everything, we did what we have to do
There is a purpose for this fight, in the end I know itÂ´s right

We are free, we are free!

In my eyes, see strong conviction
Laid to rest, all doubts are dead
Fought for everything, we did what we have to do
There is a purpose for this fight, in the end I know itÂ´s right
