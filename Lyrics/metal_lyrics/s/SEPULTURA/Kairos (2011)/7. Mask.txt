All the drama and the words.
Endless noise reflecting.
No value, no substance in anything your saying.
Confusing a reason, but no one is really listening.
Just seeking approval.
Desperate to draw attention.
Die behind your mask.
No substance or logic behind a mask, you're hiding.
Keep reaching for something.
Untruthful accusations.
Your bullshit is wasted.
It only makes us stronger.
More proof in our actions.
Can stand by what we are doing.
Die behind your mask.

Hide - Lie - Hide - Take your mask off.

The true voice.
Our music.
It's always been our music.
Can't speak to our faces.
It's easy to put your mask on.
The typing and bitching, it's how you keep your distance.
There's always a reason we've moved beyond your limits.

Hide - Lie - Hide - Take your mask off.

A life in disguise.
It's all a dream.
Look at me, it's so predictable with your head bowed down.
It's time to cross these lines and stand to face, look at me!

Hide - Lie - Hide - Take your mask off.
