Absurdity,
Tragedy,
The fingers are on the triggers of change
A Power of change to other hands

Equality,
Democracy,
Fallen dictators, instigators,
Aggravators step down

Now is the time!
Fallen dictators - step down!
Instigators - step down!
Aggravators - step down
Structure violence!

A storm has formed and fills the air
Fell the weight of catastrophe
Kept the needs from humanity
The total greed the absurdity.
