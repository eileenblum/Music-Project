Friday, October 2nd, 1992
Chaos has descended in "Carandiru", the biggest penitentiry complex in South
America
Over a hundred inmates dead and hundreds injured on the massacre
The police arrived with helicopters and over two hundred armed forces

They took the jailblock called "Pavilhao Nove" and opened fire on the inmates
in a holocaust, method of annihilation. The government of the city of Sao
Paulo cannot control the brutality of its police

Holocaust, Body piles
Confrontation, Mutilation
Discipline, Ignorance
Conflagration, Torture

Over eighty percent of the inmates were not sentenced yet. The bodies were
filled with bullets and bites from the police dogs
The police try to hide the massacre saying there were only eight deaths
The violence of Brasilian cops is very well known outside of Brasil. This
kind of extermination is a method that they use to get rid of the
overpopulation in the jails
The violence of the cops left the whole pavillion destroyed after the
rebellion
"Pavilhao Nove" (Pavilhao 9)
