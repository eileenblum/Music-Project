Pain, makes me stronger
Everyday
Life is chaos
You gotta deal with it

Expressing my agression
Through confusion
Face reality
Nothing is like it used to be

Don't tell me I don't know
You don't live in my war
Revolt and anger
I won't take it anymore

Don't get me wrong
You don't know where I'm from
Don't get me wrong
You don't know where I've been
Don't get me wrong
It's been a painful way
Don't get me wrong
You wouldn't understand
