What did I do to deserve this agony?
Filled with desire and ambition but no more
Free from the anger but conditioned and alone
Drowned in the tears of the one thing that once loved

The onset of slaughter still rages on!
The future is so black the thrill is gone!

Lack of trust buried deep
Sadistic values haunting me

Haunting me!
Sadistic values, haunting me!

Robotic eyes are watching
It's time for a new world order

Reverse the rules kill the need
Increasing pressure follows me

Follows me!
Sadistic values, haunting me!
