The blame I took it
The shame I've passed
The choice to leave another life unchanged
Expanding world
It's a disease
They forced their peace into my veins and brain
Another rude fall
Down on my knees
I couldn't breathe I thought I was insane
The drug TV is there for all to see
To show you brother you have no other way

This is not life!

The choice to leave one's free will behind
Leads to a mind blowing paradox
I trust my feelings
My only guide
I only say what I say to hear what I don't hear
Another rude fall
Down on my knees
I couldn't breathe I thought I was insane
The drug TV is there for all to see
To show you brother you have no other way

This is not life!
My free will died when they took my mind
