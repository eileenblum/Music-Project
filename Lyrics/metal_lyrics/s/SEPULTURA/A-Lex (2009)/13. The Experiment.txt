Action speaks loud, louder than any word
You need to watch it all, you need to learn it all
False smiles, all hypocrites
You know you're paying all, you need to watch your back

Do you think he's cured?
Do you think he's sane?
Do you think he's free?
Do you think at all?
Being you and not being me
Is this a way to cure a life so obscured?

Experiment from the government
It's a moral sin of our society
They're feeding lies to an empty mind
A mind impelled to be good

A chemical war inside - No choice no more
A human guinea pig - No choice no more
He ceases to be a man - No choice no more
He has no choice no more - No choice no more
