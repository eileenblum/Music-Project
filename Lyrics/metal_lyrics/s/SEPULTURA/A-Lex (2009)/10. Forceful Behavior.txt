I'm not allowed to be myself
To inspire a world, a new breed
I'm only allowed to copy religion
To bow my head, the fear of God

I'm not allowed to build the truth
Understand and respect our past
I'm only allowed to vote for scum
Obey their laws and hear their lies

Forceful behavior
Forced
Forceful behavior
