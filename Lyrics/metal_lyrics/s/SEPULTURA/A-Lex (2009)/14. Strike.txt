Bored my symptoms are dead
Rarest seconds I have to rest
Time will keep my instinct to seek
And my urge will bring me revenge

Strike, strike!

It's never been easy to beg
Rethinking the plan reinventing a man
I had to learn it all the hard way
The vengeance strikes deep within

Strike, strike!

I'm not the leader of my acts
No longer hearing my mind
I'm living a life underground
I'm so fucked!

Strike, strike!
