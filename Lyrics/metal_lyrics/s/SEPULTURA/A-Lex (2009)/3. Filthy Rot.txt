I don't live today
Not in this world we see this way
I don't cheat a game
Not in this field we have to play

"Dear, dear land I fought for thee
And brought thee peace and victory"

Go on cowards
Go on bastards
I don't care no more
All is worse
All is darker
I can't breathe this air

"Dear, dear land I fought for thee
And brought thee peace and victory"

Bloody wires
Clockwork soul
What choice is left for me?
The earth is dying
Go on humans
My pain has no gain

"Dear, dear land I fought for thee
And brought thee peace and victory"
