Love is a failure
Hate is just another deadly trap
Trust is just a moment in life which you should command

We've lost you!
Who knows who?
We've lost you!

Pain is faking gain
Profit is no relief
To lie is to justify another lie you take as truth

Who knows who?
We've lost you!

Death is a part of life
As peace is part of war
I just need to clear my mind to learn both sides

Who knows who?
We've lost you!
