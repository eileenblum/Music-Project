I've never realized how bad it was
To lose the ground to rest my feet
Humanity is lost inside
My eyes can't teach my mind

Clockwork nerves controlled my arms
Pupils are wide open to see
No coming back from where I left
I'm a rotten orange healed by force

A number was my name
A priest was my strength
A cell was my home
A nightmare so unreal

I'm not the man I used to be
I'm something else, this is not me
No self respect, no memory
I'm living my own metamorphosis
