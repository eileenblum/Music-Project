Until The Philosophy Which Holds One Race
Superior And Another Inferior
Everywhere Is War

War In The East, War In The West
War Up North, War Down South
War

Until The Color Of A Man's Skin
Is No More Significant
Than The Colour Of His Eyes
I Got To Say There'll Be a War

War in the east, war in the west
War up north, war down south
War

That Until The Basic Human Rights Are Equally
Guaranteed To All, Without Regard To Race
There'll Be A War

War In The East, War In The West
War Up North, War Down South
War
War
War
War
War, War, War, War

War In The East (It's A War)
War In The West (Now Everywhere Is War)
War Up North (It's A War)
War Down South (Now Everywhere Is War)
War In The East, War In The West
War Up North, War Down South

War, War (We Find It Necessary)
War, War
War, War (We Find It Necessary)
War, War
War      (And We Know We Shall Win)
(And We Are Confident)

War In Africa or America,
North America Or Brazil
Or Australia, It Doesn't Matter.
(We're The Same)
