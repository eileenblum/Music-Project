I don't want to think, give me balls, go with my friends
Can't come up with anything, my brain needs stimulation

Drug me, drug me, drug me, drug me

I'm so fucking tired, got it waiting for us, gotta stay
TV and girls, third world, make more to store

Drug me, drug me, drug me, look out

Drug me, with natural vitamin C
Drug me, with pharmaceutical speed
Drug me, with your sleeping pills
Drug me, with your crossword puzzles
Drug me, with your magazines
Drug me, with your fuck machines
All fake, fuck it away

Finally off to work, another potato-chip weekend
Go away, go away, leave me alone, can't see myself

Drug me, drug me, drug me, drug me

[Original lyrics off "Fresh Fruit For Rotting Vegetables" by DK (thanks Svein)]

[DRUG ME (Words and music: Jello Biafra)]

I don't want to think
Don't make me care
I wanna melt in with the group
I need the balls
To leap out of my shell
And let go with my friends

Can't come up with anything I want to do
I need a project I can finish
My brain needs some stimulation
DRUG ME
DRUG ME
DRUG ME
DRUG ME
DRUG ME

I'm so fucking tired
I gotta stay awake and get to work
I'm runnin' late
I gotta make it through the day
And make my time go by

TV and the stereo and girls are lots of fun
I want the max
I relate better loaded
'Gotta see that movie stoned'

DRUG ME
DRUG ME
DRUG ME
Drug me- with natural vitamin C
Drug me- with pharmaceutical speed
Drug me- with your sleeping pills
Drug me- with your crossword puzzles
Drug me- with your magazines
Drug me- with your fuck machines
With a fountain of fads
More rock and roll ads...
DRUG ME
DRUG ME
DRUG ME ME ME

Finally off of work
Unwind, and watch the ball game at the bar
Another potato chip weekend
Is here at last
Go away Go away Go away Go away
Go away
Leave me alone
So I can't see myself

DRUG ME
DRUG ME
DRUG ME
DRUG ME
