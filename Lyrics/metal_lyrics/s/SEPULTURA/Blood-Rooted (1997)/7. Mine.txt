mine
mine
mine (stretched out)
mine (stretched out)

all the years
all the nerve
it's the least
I deserve
a paper prison
with thin white walls
brown upholstery amour all

(stop me, don't touch me
don't stop, cause i'm such a creep) x3
stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me

mine
mine
mine
mine (stretched out)
mine (stretched out)

family business
nice and neat
like a cover on a toilet seat
you piss me off
and I piss you on
a waste ends before it's won

(stop me, don't touch me
don't stop, cause i'm such a creep) x3
stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me

Mike-
Max-
Mike-
Max-
Mike- c'mon c'mon get up get it up
Max-
Mike-
Max-

(stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me) x3
stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me, stop me

Mine, Mine, Mine, Mine.. (a lot of times)
