I!

Poisoned Hearts, Poisoned Minds
Join In Hate
We're Like Machines
Dead, Do Not Create
Sitting Docile
While All around is Rot
We Point Fingers
But Destruction Never Stops

Can You Stop It?
Do You Want To?

We Poison The Planet
Cities Contaminated With Acid Rain
We Poison Our Bodies To Alleviate The Pain
Of What We Do To Each Other
And What's Done To Us
And There Are TV-screens
Sowing The Seeds Of Distrust

Can You Stop It?
Do You Want To?

Can You Stop It?
Do You Want To?

Poisoned Hearts, Poisoned Minds
Join In Hate
We're Like Machines
Dead, Do Not Create
Sitting Docile
While All around is Rot
We Point Fingers
But Destruction Never Stops

Can You Stop It?
Do You Want To?

They Call It Human Nature
But Is This humane?
Hurting Each Other
Then Again And Again
How Can We Look At Ourselves
After What We've Done
Stop Looking Out For Yourself
Look Out For Everyone

Can You Stop It?
Do You Want To?
No!
