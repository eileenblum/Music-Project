[Bonus Track]There is an endless consumption
A careless production destroying what stands in its way

A product drenched in blood. Profit at any cost

Expanding
No limits
Lost focus
Blind eyes

The war is raging
Fighting for justice
Trapped in a nightmare
Must hear them screaming

Stand in direct opposition
To the values that we share
It strains and betrays our community

Expanding
No limits
Lost focus
Blind eyes

A war is raging
Fighting for justice
Trapped in a nightmare
Must hear the screaming

The greed. The hunger continues endlessly
There's ways to change this
Buyer beware
