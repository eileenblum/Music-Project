I saw this many times smothered by the words
Lashed out from your mouth
You'll pay the price backing all the shit you said
It flowed like it would never end
Lead by those unstable sick fantases
You chose to be this way

Behind a glow is a darkness showing
A strangling guilt with selfish motives

Nothing left to offend. It's been sad
All been done. Nothing left. Just a shell of man

Join the show. Watch it grow

Cyber God. Making them fall
Taste the wrath. Fear thy words

Tried to make sense of what you're saying
Meaningless lies with no emotion

There's nothing left to offend. It's been sad
All been done. Nothing left. Just a shell of man

Join the show. Watch it grow
Cyber God. Making them fall
Taste the wrath. Fear thy words

Fear my words

Won't let them take the best of me
I've got to be the one I see
Won't let them take the best of me
The fight is strong. I won't retreat
