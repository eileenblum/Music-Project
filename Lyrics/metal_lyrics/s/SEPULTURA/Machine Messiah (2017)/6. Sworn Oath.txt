Crawling from under the ashes
It's the start of a rebirth without limitations

Leave it all to begin again
Forced to face with who we are and what we did

No deception or promises
Everyone is running out of patience

The writings on the, wall
The tide is turning, now
Won't pledge allegiance, why
Our goals will never, die

Constrained by corruption
Bleeding hearts were lead astray
Swore an oath to lead the way
But the greed transformed to shame

There's a reason to break these chains
We're all aware that no one wants to live this way
Not this way

Locked up and confined. No attention
But we stand, we stand to make a difference

The writings on the, wall
The tide is turning, now
Won't pledge allegiance, why
Our goals will never, die
Never die
