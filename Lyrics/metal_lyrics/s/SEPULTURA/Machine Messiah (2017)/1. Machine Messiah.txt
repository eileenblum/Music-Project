Alone away
Lost, darken rage
Far from grace a world
Betrayed come and free the beast
Can you hear me?
I want hope

Behold there's a way
A spark
A flame
Won't you feed the needs
Come and save me
I need you
I'll give you everything
I'll cure humanity
Shelter security
I'll make you part of me
Prepare to feel nothing

The soul is dead
Your saviour bled
The soul is dead
Bow down to machine messiah

Give me your praise
I'll keep you safe
The soul is dead
Bow down to machine messiah

The souls is dead
Your saviour bled
The soul is dead
Bow down to machine messiah

Give me your praise
I'll keep you safe
The soul is dead
Bow down to machine messiah

I'll give you everything
I'll cure humanity
Shelter security
I'll make you part of me
I have returned
