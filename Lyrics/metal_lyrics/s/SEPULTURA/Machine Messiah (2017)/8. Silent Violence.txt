I've taken all I can take
I feel the need to destroy
Fight or flight is born in me
Chronic pain set free

Anger raging. The demons within
Silent violence. Created this sin

Killed by the stress

The demon within
Silent violence
Just have to let go

Broke all the rules of the game
I tried to make it all end
Of course you will have to pay
Live life toiled and fray

Hard-wired to life day after day
There's not a difference it all seems the same
Triggered frustration from feeling this way
Social destruction

Anger raging. Silent violence
Torture unfolds. Silent violence

It started as nothing but grew into something
Just feeding away until you cannot function
You're never controlling but in disillusion
It's grinding away like a modern day plague

Anger raging. The demons within
Silent violence. Created this sin

Killed by the stress

The demon within
Silent violence
Just have to let go
