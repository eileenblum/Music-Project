Open your mind and pay attention
What do you see and what do you hear
Conspiracy plots in this culture of fear

Reunite with yourself
Reconnect with ourselves

Facing the blind of collective delusion
I need my freedom from this evil deception
I am the enemy
I am the enemy

Powered by thoughts of revolution
Building all bridges of error
Search and destroy my sick innerself
To realize I'm not a fraud

Reunite with yourself
Reconnect with ourselves
Reorganize our lies!
Re-humanize our lives!

Reprogram your aim
Rewrite our law
Reprogram your aim
Rewrite our law

Facing the blind of collective delusion
I need my freedom from this evil deception
I am the enemy
I am the enemy

Reprogram your aim
Rewrite our law
You are human
