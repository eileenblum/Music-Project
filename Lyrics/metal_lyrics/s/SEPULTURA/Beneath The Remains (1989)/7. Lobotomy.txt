I'VE SEEN YOU FIGHTING THROUGH THE TIME
I'VE FOLLOWED YOUR STEPS FULL OF PAIN
UNNAMED HERO THAT'S CHALLENGED THE HUMAN EGO
VICTIM OF COWARDICE
OF STRONG MANIPULATION
A SYSTEM THAT WAS MADE TO LIE AND TO DECEIVE
SCREAMS OF AGONY
SATISFY THE PROUD
BUT THESE SCREAMS STILL ECHO INSIDE THE CONSCIENCE
CONTRADICTION, AGGRESSION, DESOLATION, ILLUSION
NONCONFORMITY TAKES MY MIND
TOO MUCH INJUSTICE TO FORGET SO FAST
MY DISGUST IS GREATER THAN MY COMPASSION
FEEL THE PAIN UPON MY FINAL HOUR
SELF-BLAME CAN'T HURT ME
EYE FOR AN EYE
YOU RECEIVE YOUR JUST REWARD
NOW I'LL LIVE MY LIFE WITH INDIFFERENCE
I'VE TORTURED WITHOUT REMORSE
I'VE SLAUGHTERED WITHOUT FEAR
BRAIN KILLING BRAIN
BRAIN KILLING BRAIN
BRAIN KILLING BRAIN
BRAIN KILLING BRAIN
