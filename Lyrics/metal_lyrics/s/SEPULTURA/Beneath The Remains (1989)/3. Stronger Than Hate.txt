I SHALL REDEEM MYSELF FROM THE CLUTCHES THAT GRASP AT MY INNER SELF
NO TOMORROW WILL EASE MY OPPRESSION
MY STREAK OF HATE LEADS MY WAY
LOOK AT ME
MY FEELINGS TURN
STRONGER THAN HATE
I CAN'T DECIDE ON WHICH WAY TO TURN
MY CHOICES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
A LIFETIME OF REMORSE
THERE'S NO PLACE THAT I'VE EVER BEEN
I STAND ABOVE THEIR REMAINS
MY VENGEANCE I HAVE REGAINED
I DON'T KNOW WHAT LIES ON THE FLOOR
I WON'T BE LOCKED UP ANYMORE
STANDING HERE I'VE LOST ALL FAITH
I HAVE NO SOCIAL EQUALITY
TO LIVE AGAIN WOULD BE A LIE
MY LIFE IS NOT WORTH THE PAIN
