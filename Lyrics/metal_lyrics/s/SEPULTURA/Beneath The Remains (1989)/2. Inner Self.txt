WALKING THESE DIRTY STREETS
WITH HATE IN MY MIND
FEELING THE SCORN OF THE WORLD
I WON'T FOLLOW YOUR RULES
BLAME AND LIES, CONTRADICTIONS ARISE
BLAME AND LIES, CONTRADICTIONS ARISE
NONCONFORMITY IN MY INNER SELF
ONLY I GUIDE MY INNER SELF
I WON'T CHANGE MY WAY
IT HAS TO BE THIS WAY
I LIVE MY LIFE FOR MYSELF
FORGET YOUR FILTHY WAYS
BLAME AND LIES, CONTRADICTIONS ARISE
BLAME AND LIES, CONTRADICTIONS ARISE
NOBODY WILL CHANGE MY WAY
LIFE BETRAYS, BUT I KEEP ON GOING
THERE'S NO LIGHT, BUT THERE'S HOPE
CRUSHING OPPRESSION, I WIN
BETRAYING AND PLAYING DIRTY, YOU THINK YOU'LL WIN
BUT SOMEDAY YOU'LL FALL, AND I'LL BE WAITING
LAUGHS OF AN INSANE MAN, YOU'LL HEAR
PERSONALITY IS MY WEAPON AGAINST YOUR ENVY
WALKING THESE DIRTY STREETS
WITH HATE IN MY MIND
FEELING THE SCORN OF THE WORLD
I WON'T FOLLOW YOUR RULES
NONCONFORMITY IN MY INNER SELF
ONLY I GUIDE MY INNER SELF
