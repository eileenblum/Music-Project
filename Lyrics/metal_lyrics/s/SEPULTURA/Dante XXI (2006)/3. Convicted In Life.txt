[Lyrics: Andreas Kisser / Derrick Green]

Abandon all hope he who enter here
Eternal pain that runs among the lost
It's the fiction of life
What you are is what you live
It never made a fucking difference to you
In the eyes you can see the truth
It's the fiction of life
I'm going deep, no other way
Lost, who enter here
Nothing seems to go as planned
It makes no difference with the choices I make
I'm convicted in life
Don't want to make the same mistakes
Lost, who enter here
Can't live with the faults
There is no remorse for you and me
Convicted in life, fiction in life, victim in life
