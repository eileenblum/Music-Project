[Lyrics: Andreas Kisser]

I've lost my way
In a dark wood of error
In a crisis, inside deep terror
With fear in my mind, I spot a light
They're coming after me
Can't reach the light
Three beasts blocked the path
That leads the way to my life
The beast from the UK
The beast from the us
The un beast was then unleashed
To solve the problems in the world
But they don't!
Despise their false prophecies
They have no right
I hate what they're doing to
My life, my life!
Can't go on thinking
They'll really change
Keeps going, their way
Detour of my way
Learn I may, what they say
