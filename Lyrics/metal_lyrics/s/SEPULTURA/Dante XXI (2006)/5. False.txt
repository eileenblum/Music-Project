[Lyrics: Andreas Kisser]

You think you rule all
You made it all wrong
Creating more frauds
Your mask will soon fall
I will be free from
This grave where you lie
I'm out with my life
Revolting my mind
False - a devil's vice
False life - the circles lows
False - no Judas cry
False life - crushing my mind
There is no regret - there is no repent
Abusing power
A freezing cloud blurs
Judeca it's your home
You pay at dis's terms
No one will mourn you
No cry will be heard
You'll never see clear
The pain is so near
False - a devil's vice
False life - the circles lows
False - no Judas cry
False life - crushing my mind
There is no regret - there is no repent
I will not regret - I will not resent - your false
Molebolge - end of hell
You hear the screams of Lucifer
You feel the freeze, the fear, the wings
You hear the Cassius' regrets
You feel your brain being crushed by teeth
Molebolge - end of hell
