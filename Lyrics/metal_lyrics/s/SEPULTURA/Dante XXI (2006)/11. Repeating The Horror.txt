[Lyrics: Derrick Green]

What is this sickness
That sits here down inside
Walking in bullshit
Nothing seems quite right
I want redemption!
I know this darkness around me
I've felt it before
The dark has the power
To bring me down to the floor
Standing still, open doors
Feeling pain, can not move
Feeling scared, standing still
Better start something
Better than nothing
Can't go on seeing
All of these horrors
Eyes wide open can't keep them shut
From this horror of the shame
Can feel the pain, life's fucked up
When we witness our horrors
Real close up
Better start something
Better than nothing
Can't go on seeing
All of these horrors
