[Lyrics: Derrick Green]

There is a way out
There is a way out
It took a long time to get where we are
It wasn't easy but it never is
Big steps keep moving on
I have my own two feet don't need
You to walk for me
There is a way out
There is a way out
There were differences between you and me
There are things that I am just starting to see
Powerless! what does that mean?
Who has control over everything?
I had to learn, salvation
To find my place in the world we live
I had to have, compassion
To understand that I have to give
There is a way out
There is a way out
Salvation!!
