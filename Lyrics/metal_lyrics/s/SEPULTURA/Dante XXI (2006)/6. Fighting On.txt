[Lyrics: Derrick Green]

Weight of the world
Each have to carry their own
Nothing's for certain
But to carry our own
From the first birth of life
Till our final last breath
You never thought we could make it this far
We don't stop, we keep fighting on
Wandering in circles
Motivated by fear
Searching for answers
They're right in front of you
From the first birth of life
Till our final last breath
You never thought that you could make it this far
We don't stop, we keep fighting on
I can promise you I'll (carry on)
My time is now
From the first birth of life
Till our final last breath
You never thought that you could make it this far
We don't stop, we keep fighting on
From the first birth of life
Till our final last breath
You never thought that you could make it
But we carry our own
