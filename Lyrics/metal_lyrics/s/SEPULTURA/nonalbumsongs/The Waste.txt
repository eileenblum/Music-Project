["Freddy vs. Jason" Soundtrack][with Mike Patton]If what you want is what you need
Then what you want is what you need
Then what you need is really what you want
If what you want is what you need
Then what you need is really really what you want
If what you want is what you need
Then what you need is what you really really want
If what you want is what you need
Then what you need is what you really really want
I'm wasted I'm wasted

If what you want is what you need
Then what you need is what you really really want
If what you want is what you need
Then what you need is what you really really want
If what you want is what you see
Then what you see is what you really want to eat
If what you love is what you bleed
Then what you bleed is what will really set you free
I'm wasted and I keep falling over
With your head on my shoulder
I'm wasted

If what you want is what you need
Then what you need is what you really really want
If what you slum is what you breed
Then what you breed will have the face of your conceit
I'm wasted I'm wasted
I don't want to live without her
I don't want to die without her
I don't want to live without her
I don't want to die without her
