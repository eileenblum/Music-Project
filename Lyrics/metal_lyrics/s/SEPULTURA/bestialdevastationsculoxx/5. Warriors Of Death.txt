Marching over the mist
Leaving behind the wheack's
Going this endless war
Like a tormenting nightmare

Over the devastated ruins
I raised a sign
The sign of hate
For a masses despair

To revenged the years
Arrested in abyss
Where Jesus Christ
Made his suffer

But the final command
Is happening here now
Which I see is the ruins
And warriors marching to death
