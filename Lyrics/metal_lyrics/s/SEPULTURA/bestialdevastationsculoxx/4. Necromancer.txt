The mist is high in this night
Can feel the presence of death
Way to the mortuary so the deads will invoke
Corpses and skulls in my countour
See a corpse bloody with the face in cruciform
Now being from the wrath
Catch the skulls of a children, frozen and dismal
Coming with me
Creature, kill in name of Hell
The black mess is started, life's will terminate
With the wrath of the demons started the genocide
Wrath, in my corpus is born
Death, lost legions from Hell
Slaughter, you'll see in sacrifice
Skulls, are christians with blood

Necromancer
Dead's invoker
Necromancer
Dead's invoker

Wrath, odious, desire
In my corpus is born
The fates last, terror's spread
For a necros creature of
The crypts'
