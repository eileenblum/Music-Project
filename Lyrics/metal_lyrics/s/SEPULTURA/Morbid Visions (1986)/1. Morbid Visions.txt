The Roman empire has crucified the messiah
The bestial power as sacrificed your Gods
Feared by this power, the cross he'll carry
And visions of destruction, this night you'll see

Crucified, killed, buried
Sacrificed messiah
Kneeled down, blood stained

The cristians, today they still cry
But the bastards adore images
Remembrances from the past, from the crucifixion
Rotting christ, nailed to cross

From the semen of the mankind
We'll spread our seed
And we'll show to the devoted
The truth, painful truth

Cry preachers
Because your Gods has forgotten
The antichrist there is to prove
Death and destruction will still reign
