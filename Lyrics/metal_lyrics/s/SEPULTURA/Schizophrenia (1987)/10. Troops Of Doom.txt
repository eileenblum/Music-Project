[CD Bonus Only]

Total eclipse hides the Earth
The night of doom has come
Antichrist soldiers are proclaimed
To send souls to the Hell

Catastrophe and destruction
Mankind is slaughtered without mercy
Suphul clouds are in the air
Legions winds corrose the universe

The messiahs, redeemers of mankind
Chained in the valley of Hades
Crowds blinded by evil
Only death is real
