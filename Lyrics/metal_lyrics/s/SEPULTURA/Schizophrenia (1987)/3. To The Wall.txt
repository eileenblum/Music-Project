To the wall - claims the soldier
My last steps march to the dead
Last wills! Hell! This is idiotism
Fuck off to me, fuck off to all of you

To the death - I raise my head
My last moments - it's my existing countdown
A cry for mercy trapped in my throat
But even in hell there's a place for cowards

The burning sun over my head
The troop is comin' - compassion I dismiss
Sentence of death pounding on my back
There's no hiding when you're thrown against the wall

To paradise, the priest is saying... blessing my death
He's standing in front of me... his merciful sight sickens me
He says that soon I'll have my judgement...
I'll kneel down in front of the Lord

And he asks me to regret my sins.. but it's too late
Growling words from the bible... raising my agony
Oh God!... how I'd like to have my hands untied

The wall I'm facing now
Seeing my life going through my eyes
Feeling death behind my back
An acrid taste of defeat tormenting my last years
And when I feel my body being... Punched... Smashed
There's no pain... just silence
My last breath echoing... spreading through the air
My body in pieces.. a stream of blood...

Bloody drops whipping the wall
The silent wall that has understood my silence
The silence that was a prisoner of my soul
Is my soul that now is the ruler of the world

To the wall
