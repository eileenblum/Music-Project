[Lyrics: Andreas Kisser; Music: Andreas Kisser / Igor Cavalera]

Urban war, cracked-up child
Painted in blood on concrete walls
Carbonic gas, cancer land
What do I care? What do I care?
Is he prepared? Can he face that?
He must handle the truth of real demands

Strike   Boycott

Armed and ill, psycho kill
There's no ground holding my feet up
Trained to serve but I steal
What do I care? What do I care?
Protect society who pays me shit
It's south of the world, no justice sire

Strike   Boycott

Stressful mind, fucked up life
I know the end can be suicide
Suicide, suicide
What do I care? What do I care?
Boycott the trigger and you'll have no feedback
Boycott the force that kept the sick in their beds

I'll boycott the trigger and you'll have no feedback
With hands tied, I can't receive what I need

Reserve no honor
Reserve no pride

Strike   Boycott
