[Bonus Track]You want to see me hang around do not bother me
You want to know if I will get down cannot you see
Gene Machine stick it in shove it up are they still humans?
Dream Machine with brown eyes brown hair created scientifically

You want to see me hang around do not bother me
You want to know if I get down cannot you see
Come on open up your eyes truth is there to see there is to be in reality
Gene Machine Are they issues? Dial-A-Gene Buy-A-Gene
Take a second look did one just pass by way?
Gene Machine Gene Machine

You never know one when you see her
Quite aware mistaken identity
Gene Machine under H.I.M.
We pray not take the other
