[Lyrics: Derrick Green; Music: Andreas Kisser / Igor Cavalera]

He just takes what's his
Can never see an end
Build a wall of selfishness
To block out all your fears

I can't forget, I won't forget
I can't forget, I won't forget
You don't owe me shit

Never any remorse, never any remorse
Always turning your back
Drowned out, drowned out

There's no compromise
Only hate inside
I decided long ago
I would never be so blind

I can't forget, I won't forget
I can't forget, I won't forget

Never any remorse, never any remorse
Always turning your back
Drowned out, drowned out

Feel no shame
Show no shame
You don't owe me shit!
