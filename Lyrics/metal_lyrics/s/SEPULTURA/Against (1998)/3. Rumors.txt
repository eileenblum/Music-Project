[Lyrics: Andreas Kisser; Music: Andreas Kisser / Igor Cavalera]

Loss for words - you lost respect
Food for thoughts - you're just a fool
Mind of the weak, nonsense says

The rumors will never die
The rumors are only lies
The rumors don't let you breathe
Talk is cheap

Games of lies -  just fucking lies
It's all wrong -  you're full of shit
Nothing's straight, no!
Low moves, low moves

The rumors will never die
The rumors are only lies
The rumors don't let you breathe
Talk is cheap

I thought   I've heard
I thought   I've said
I thought was right
It's never wrong

Let it be, just let it be
Never mind, just never mind
That's all you have, that's all you got
Never say what you never will

The rumors will never die
The rumors are only lies
The rumors don't let you breathe
Talk is cheap
