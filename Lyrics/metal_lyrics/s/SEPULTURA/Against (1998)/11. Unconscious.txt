[Lyrics: Andreas Kisser; Music: Andreas Kisser / Igor Cavalera]

The deepest pain inside
The highest price to pay
The biggest lies are said
I'm just a fake in life

Unconscious   Unconsciousness
Unconscious   Unconsciousness

Alone I fall again
My blood runs through my veins
My brain and my strength
No longer are the same, no!

Unconscious   Unconsciousness
Unconscious   Unconsciousness

The moment of truth
Destroy the sense of it
I thought that was then
I thought that was me

Still I fear   Unconsciousness
Still I seek   Unconsciousness
