[Lyrics: Andreas Kisser; Music: Andreas Kisser / Igor Cavalera]

Pray for another life
Pay, regain your pride

See your brain / Choke
Watch it drain / Choke
See your greed / Choke
Watch it breed / Choke

Fake, you're falling down
Choke, your neck is broken

See your brain / Choke
Watch it drain / Choke
See your greed / Choke
Watch it breed / Choke

Victim in conflict, the ambush of fear
My doubt, my limit, the pulse of my war

See your brain / Choke
Watch it drain / Choke
See your greed / Choke
Watch it breed / Choke
