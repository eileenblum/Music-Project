[Lyrics: Andreas Kisser;]
[Music: Andreas Kisser / Igor Cavalera  / Paulo Jr.]

Before we're born
Before we walk
Before we talk and hate
Yet to come the perfect rule

After we win
After we lose
After the dawn is late
Do it now or shut your mouth

No lack of trust, just trust myself
No more perhaps, no more false step
Changes in sight, sight!
Common bonds

Fear the fate that's not the shape of the soul
Trust the heart and share to ease the pain
No mistake is big enough to bring you down
The wrinkles on your face is strength in your mind

No lack of trust, just trust myself
Changes in sight, sight!
Common bonds

The urge to win
A time to strike
Follow no one
Follow no one

Strength in mind
