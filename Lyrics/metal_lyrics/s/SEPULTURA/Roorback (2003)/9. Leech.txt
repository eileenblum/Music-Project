[Letra: Andreas Kisser, Derrick Green]
[Musica: Andreas Kisser, Igor Cavalera, Derrick Green]

I hear you talking your shit
Wondering if it's ever going to end
Your bored all the time with the things that you do
I don't pity your life

I see your acting all weird
It all seems so clear
Your making no sense in a world so immense
Stop wasting my time

Always judging a face
What the fuck is wrong with you
Sucking out the life of anyone that you can reach
A mind so sick

Blood sucking leech
Life taking leech
Blood...

Blood sucking leech
Life wasting leech

Blood sucking leech
Life wasting leech
