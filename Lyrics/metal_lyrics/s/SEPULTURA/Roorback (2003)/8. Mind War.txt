[Letra: Derrick Green, Igor Cavalera]
[Musica: Andreas Kisser, Igor Cavalera, Derrick Green]

Do you walk in shadows
Do you walk with fear
Do you sleep with anger
Do you keep it near

Is there ever focus
When you plan things out
Gods hands/gods fault
Just drunk with power

Lost cause
No coming back
Lost soul
There's no regret
Lost cause
No coming back
No thurst mindwar

A war of words
Battles in your mind
Contradictions rising
What's wrong and right

Lost cause
There's no regret
Lost soul
No coming back

I know you've heard it all
It's no excuse for what's been done
You know you felt the pain
When you sat and watched there suffering

We've got sick people in this fucked up world
It's just ripping away at everything that I feel
Even the sight of you makes me ill
I wish could wake you up - to make you see this is real

Lost cause
No coming back
Lost soul
There's no regret
Lost cause
No coming back
No thurst mindwar
