[Letra: Andreas Kisser, Derrick Green]
[Musica: Andreas Kisser, Igor Cavalera, Derrick Green]

The speech doesn't reach
The killing doesn't fix
No one is free from the fate
That a few men force us to take

Over paid and over weight
Population does not stop creating
Ill heart that can't love no more
The whole state closing down its doors

All lost
We are all lost
Our path is filled with no end
What will become

It's just more of the same
You're just a part of the game
We lost our hope in you

False words deceive and lie
Bleeding pages from the paper
Can't wash your hands

It's just more of the same
You're just a part of the game
We lost our trust in you

You cowards, back stabbers, no truth from you

The words are clear
For those who care
Never thought it could mean so much
For those who care

You're the ones who created all the fear
You're the ones who deny we're all here
I think it's time to open our eyes
Our minds were closed for most of our lives

Always seemed so real
Controlling what we feel
You never thought it could happen this way
Exercise our right to make it right

It's just more of the same
You're just a part of the game
