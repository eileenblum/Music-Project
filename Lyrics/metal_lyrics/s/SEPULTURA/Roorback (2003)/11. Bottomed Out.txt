[Musica: Andreas Kisser, Igor Cavalera, Derrick Green]

I spent much time with anger and I know it all to well
To fall beneath your heavy grasp a plan to have control
You keep yourself locked within a cage an agonizing hell
I won't let you bring me down not this way again

Acting as a victim in a twisted little world
Dealing with your problems I just don't seem to relate
The pressure is more then I can handle I feel I'm going to break
I won't go through this shit again not this shit again

Walk away
Don't come again
Walk just walk away
Walk away
Don't come again
Walk just walk away

Walk away
Don't come again
Walk just walk away
Walk away
Don't come again
Walk just walk away
