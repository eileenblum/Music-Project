[Letra: Andreas Kisser, Derrick Green]
[Musica: Andreas Kisser, Igor Cavalera, Derrick Green]

Your right, your will, to vote, to kill
Your world, is ill
Solutions to our crimes

Don't make me feel like shit
Insult my mind attack my life
Don't ever try to fuck with me
Corrupt my mind control what's mine

War news, war secrets, war lies, war motives
War reasons, war crimes
War heroes of our time

Corrupted, insulted
Corrupted, insulted

Don't make me feel like shit
Insult my mind attack my life
Don't ever try to fuck with me
Corrupt my mind control what's mine

Corrupted, insulted
Corrupted, insulted

Your right, your will, to vote, to kill
Your world, is ill
Solutions to our crimes

Don't make me feel like shit
Insult my mind attack my life
Don't ever try to fuck with me
Corrupt my mind control what's mine
