[Letra: Andreas Kisser]
[Musica: Andreas Kisser, Igor Cavalera, Derrick Green]

Our pulse to resist
Moves our cultural resistance
I'm living this life
Inside a civil tribe demised
Improve my old mind
Breaking all rules absorbing what I may find

Our manner to protect
Destroys what's left for protection
Believing in symbols
The church will fool our souls
Prove you my role
Acting against undesired control

Don't fear your left
Don't trust your right
Activist

Our way of seeing progress
Making us walk towards repression
Disturbing our peace
In the name of self defense
Being felt by all
Our violent taste for the humans fall

Don't fear your left
Don't trust your right
Activist
