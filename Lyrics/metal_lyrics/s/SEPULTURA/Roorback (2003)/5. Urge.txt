[Letra: Andreas Kisser]
[Musica: Andreas Kisser, Igor Cavalera, Derrick Green]

Revolting manner of handling power
Perpetrating lies and misery
Fifty years of progress in five
People living only to survive

The child is suffering a mother's deadly dream
I'm fed up to see them being mistreated
I'm always feeling like i'm being cheated
No honest meanings the way i'm treated

Multi racial society
Degradation of liberty
Urban warfare at all levels
Politicians rethinking his measures

I'm deep inside
A sea of mud
The underground
South of the world

Can't control my urge
Rule my urge
Can't control my urge
Ruled by urge

Between the shacks and arid soil
The concrete jungle with trees of steel
Between the millions confronting faces
Confusing crowds with distant traces

Soldiers out there drug dealing
Warriors of the raw feelings
Side line control trespassing over
Dictating rules and committing the crimes

I'm deep inside
A sea of mud
The underground
South of the world

Can't control my urge
Rule my urge
Can't control my urge
Ruled by urge
