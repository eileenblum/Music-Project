[Letra: Andreas Kisser, Derrick Green]
[Musica: Andreas Kisser, Igor Cavalera, Derrick Green]

Men is not alone in this world and
Mankind is not completely absurd
Breaking men ground to build and to grow
Advancing their lives for better or worse

In a world growing fast we're losing touch
Cultivating hate and forging rules
Closing our eyes we search the sky
Expectations are from religion

What went wrong
I don't believe you

It's been around for thousands of years at least
There's nothing new with another catastrophe
A sense to move on is filling the air

What went wrong
I don't believe you
What went wrong
I don't believe you

Men is not alone in this world and
Mankind is not completely absurd
Breaking men ground to build and to grow

Kashmir - Colombia - Rio - New York
Old wars revived to revenge a lost
Taking what's left and burning it down
Creating oposition

What went wrong
I don't believe you
What went wrong
I don't believe you
