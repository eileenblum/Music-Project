[Letra: Derrick Green]
[Musica: Andreas Kisser, Igor Cavalera, Derrick Green]

Sent in the middle of a war you have to fight
Wondering how the fuck you ever landed over here
Never thought about all the bullshit that they feed
Now your thinking how to keep the bullets from your head

Every face alive you might have to take
The mind can only take so much before it breaks
You have to take control it's your fate
They taught you how to move, how to kill, how to die

Come back alive, don't end up dead
Come back alive, don't end up dead
Come back alive, don't end up dead
Come back alive, don't end up dead

Sent in the middle of a war you have to fight
Wondering how the fuck you ever landed over here
Never thought about all the bullshit that they feed
Now your thinking how to keep the bullets from your head

You have to take control it's your fate
They taught you how to move, how to kill, how to die

Come back alive, don't end up dead
Come back alive, don't end up dead
Come back alive, don't end up dead
Come back alive, don't end up dead
