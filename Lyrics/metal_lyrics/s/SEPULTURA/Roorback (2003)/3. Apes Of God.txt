[Letra: Andreas Kisser, Derrick Green]
[Musica: Andreas Kisser, Igor Cavalera, Derrick Green]

You can't look in these eye's
Can't live out these lies
Walk the walk, talk the talk

It doesn't leave my head staining my cells grey
This all the thanks that I get from you
Feed the fear, nothing's clear

You hear me, you
You hear me, you

There's no rest for consequences of guilt
Facing my own doubts about what is actually real
I told myself that I would live again
Lost all cause fought them all to the end
All my aspirations fell to the bottom of hell
The womb of mother earth is bleeding losing a son
Can't deny, our decline

You hear me, you
You hear me, you

Feed the fear, nothing's clear
Walk the walk, talk the talk
