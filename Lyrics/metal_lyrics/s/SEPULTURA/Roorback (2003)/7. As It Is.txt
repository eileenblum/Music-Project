[Letra: Andreas Kisser, Derrick Green]
[Musica: Andreas Kisser, Igor Cavalera, Derrick Green]

See the storm - moving in
Gaining speed - in my creed

Pain - and tears
Hate - and fears

Our sense of real is extinct
Why don't we accept as it is
All the things we see
All the things we hear
Why don't we accept as it is

See the light - breaking fast
Opens up - all you can see - knowledge to be
When theres innocents - there is guilt
With a will - theres a way

Our sense of real is extinct
Why don't we accept as it is
All the things we see
All the things we hear
Why don't we accept as it is

The more we see and learn
The more we seek and find
We are what we can reach
We are the ones alive

It's all according to plan
To survive the best that we can
Where is it we're all trying to go
We can't escape as it is

Take what there is accept as it is
Take what is yours accept as it is
