He walk through the mist and rain so cold
And nothing is grown on this evil ground
In the moonlight shine a grave of gold
A grave of ancient time when war was sound

Black Wizard

He try to read the symbols that he know was a name
The name of a wizard who was a disciple of hell
With no fear he open the coffin heâll take the blame
He draws a circle and feel the rotten smell

Black Wizard

I am the wizard
Through darkness and evil I rise
Seven flames of hell is await
Behind pandemoniumâs golden gate
I will not die
You canât kill me

He try to light the holy candle but it will not burn
He feel the forces he must go down
Down in the ghostly darkness where thereâs no return
Nothing there except the wizards evil crown

Black Wizard

He hear a demoniac laugh he turn his head
The wizard coming close heâs body needs your soul
Magic against magic a fight for life and dead
Who is the strongest gonna win the whole

Black Wizard

Now we know cause thunder and lightning salute evil this night
Cause the disciples of hell has won this holy fight
