Fight the sorceress on the mountain of hades
Execute here and go through eternal plains
Enter the firelicked field where the flower has fade
Pass six gates when one still remains
Go on with the sacred sign of the blessed child
You march againt the Lucifer legions of the wild

Your body will die your soul will survive
In the search for the sword of blessed light
Nowhere to be found hear the march of the dead
Unarmed and alone in the crypts of hell
Hear youself scream the master of pain
Youâre caught by the Lucifer legions of the wild

The dead will rise
To make us join them
The Lucifer legions of the wild

No one is there to who could ease your pain
When you hang in your nails over eternal flame
The legions will teach you to do the right
To not start riots against the master of might
Satan our father gives you to the legions
Youâre dead, killed by the lucifer legions of the wild

The dead will rise
To make us join them
The Lucifer legions of the wild

Fight the sorceress on the mountain of hades
Execute here and go through eternal plains
Enter the firelicked field where the flower has fade
Go on with the sacred sign of the blessed child
You march againt the Lucifer legions of the wild

Go on with the sacred sign of the blessed child
You march againt the Lucifer legions of the wild

The dead will rise
To make us join them
