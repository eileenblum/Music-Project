In the name of satan we drink the blood
We dance over the grave, the grave of god
We bury the newbord child in unchrist earth
And awat the sign of evil, son of Satans birth

The mist is raised and cover the moon
Earth is an eternal twilight zone
Hells necromancer salute the message of his son
The infant will be baptized in the blood of a nun

The birth brings evil and dead
And power to fight torture and dread
Witches and demons kiss the goat of hell
And satans warriors chamiel the bell
In the sign of evil
In the sign of evil

This night we can see hundered of angels fall
This night we can head the ancient bells toll
The crack of thunder open the sky
And all the christians will die

The birth brings evil and dead
And power to fight torture and dread
Witches and demons kiss the goat of hell
And satans warriors chamiel the bell
In the sign of evil
In the sign of evil
