With thunder and lightning, we start to fight
We walk with Satanâs forces, we have his power
We turn the cross, and follow the light
We start the killing, now itâs begun the deadly hour

Look at Satanâs eyes
Evil shine so bright
Thereâs no time
For cowards

We come with evil lords
We raise our swords
Thereâs no good to fight back
Get down on your knees or crack

The world is falling to pieces, a piece for every life
Through the chaos on earth, and evil in hell
The soldiers kill the men, and rape then their wives
Our mightiest lord is waiting for me down in hell

Look at Satanâs eyes
Evil shine so bright
Thereâs no time
For sacrifice

We come with evil lords
We raise our swords
Thereâs no good to fight back
Get down on your knees or crack

Total destruction, is our might
Thereâs no silence, in our fight
Christ was, like lost
Itâs hour for holocaust

We march trough the battlefield
Dead bodies and blood are everywhere
With glory and victory weâll raise our shields
Evil rules and total death is here
We march itâs the sound of hundred feet
The gates of hell are open Holocaust is complete

We come with evil lords
We raise our swords
Thereâs no good to fight back
Get down on your knees or crack

Total destruction, is our might
Thereâs no silence, in our fight
Christ was, like lost
Itâs hour for holocaust
