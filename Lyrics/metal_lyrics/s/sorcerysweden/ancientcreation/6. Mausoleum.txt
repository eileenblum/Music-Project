When the flames of hell snatch the sky
And the light will break the sacred lock
And the crown of ancient lost its forces
It canât stop the firstborn child to pass the gate
Now she stands there in front of the grave
And the ancient voices whisper, she canât be saved

Infernal darkness covers the grave
Possessed in Satanâs name

Mausoleum
Mausoleum

Demoniac forces
Possess her soul
Killing humans
To her lord
Taste the blood
Of the newbord child

Infernal darkness covers the grave
Possessed in Satanâs name

Mausoleum
Mausoleum
