Early in pre-historic time
Nothing existed
No sand or sea
Or cool waves
Earth existed not
And no heaven
There was an unsatisfied mouth
Then the flames of evil started to grow
Just like the good flowers of heaven
In many springs, summers, autumns and winters
The evil hided itself from the good
Not of Fear
Just to wait for it to grow stronger
Just waited for the time to come
To spread blasphemy and destruction
To kill the children at their sanctuary
In the final battle the angel of death
Will lead the legions
Listen to the tale and remember
Now the time has come
