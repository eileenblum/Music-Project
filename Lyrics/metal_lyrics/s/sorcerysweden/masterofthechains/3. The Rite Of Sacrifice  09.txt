Cold blooded murder in the night
Another victim cut to pieces
Terror fills peoples veins with fright
They talk of another Jack the ripper

In darkness you walk alone in the back-street
So scared that you donât even hear the steps
Of the one whoâs known by everyone
More known as the psychopath

Psychopath - kill in every sight
Ritual death - kill for Satanâs might

Feel his hands around your mouth
Feel his knife slip through your throat
Then you never ever feel anymore
You donât feel when he slash your throat out

He drink your blood and eat your heart
And mumbles the scared verse
he can feel himself grow stronger
Then he disappears and the sacrifice is done

Psychopath - kill in every sight
Ritual death - kill for Satanâs might

Psychopath - kill in every sight
Ritual death - kill for Satanâs might

Obsessed with satanic power
He shall rule the world
All of them guilty
Thereâs no innocent victims
Kill all those who denies
That Satan is the master of them all
