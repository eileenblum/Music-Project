I hear you satan please take me away with you
I like to be there as a servant to the master
The pentagram is burned into my heart
Like a ritual of savages inside a tomb
Is there a question of my trust
I like to kill all who question my lust

I hear you Satan I am your tool here on earth
Collect your souls draft your legions
Your armies will rise again
To kill all those who you condemned
Your fire burns in my veins of strenght
Inside a blasphemy I will regain

To you â I am
Your knight â of the damned
I rule â in your name
I betray â In all the same
The heaven lies dead
The heaven lies dead
The heaven lies dead

To many years â Iâd lived in the past
But now its time â the bell have chimed
I have rasied the dead â theâre in my command
They will follow me to the very end

We will march â agains all sense
That you have put up â for defence
You didnât know â that we will crush
All thatâs you â is sent to dust

To you â I am
Your knight â of the damned
I rule â in your name
I betray â In all the same
The heaven lies dead
The heaven lies dead
The heaven lies dead
