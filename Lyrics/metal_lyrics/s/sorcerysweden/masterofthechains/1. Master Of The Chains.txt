Torn away like the sound of a broken dream
Baptized in water, unpure that burns my soul
Beneath the cross, symbol of eternal lie
I burn my lips on the chalice filled with blood

In the house of your Lord my nightmares grows
Your light of glory never shall blind my eyes
The pain it causes will only strengthen me
I aim to destroy all to show my true beliefs

Haunted by Christ, the deceiver
The oppressor, master of the chains
Freedom to slave for salvation
The tyrants of the human race

I was born in fire just to save us all
Who are kept in the dark by the sinister lies
The demon in me is so fatal to thee
Beware the arise of the new world order

Things will be put to the ultimate test
And order will follow Christian chaos
I sense my power increase as I breathe fear
Humble me, the disciple of the beast

Haunted by Christ, the deceiver
The oppressor, master of the chains
Freedom to slave for salvation
The tyrants of the human race
