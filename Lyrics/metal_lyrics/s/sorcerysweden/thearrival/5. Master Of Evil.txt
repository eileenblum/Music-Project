I seek in the darkness for a victim to kill
So bleed can fleet in the streets
Souls of dead men will cry in the night
And all demons will come to the light

Now, so come on let's jump in the fire
So come on, let's jump in the fire
I am the master of evil
I am the master of evil!

I call for Satan in the night
It said there has been a victory fight
So iv'e gone out to kill again
Cause I like it, do you understand?

Now, so come on let's jump in the fire
So come on, let's jump in the fire
I am the master of evil!
I am!
I am the master of evil!

I coming in the night
If your scared cry out
Cause evil is here to stay
And you are standing in the way

Blood
Master of evil
I want your head

Master
Master

Master- OF EVIL!!

Master
Master
