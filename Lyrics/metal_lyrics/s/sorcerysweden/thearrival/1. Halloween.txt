Black is the night, the cemetery in silence
The bell striking midnight, it's Halloween so beware!

Candles shine in the ghostly hour,
circles are drawn around the graves
Evil message from bloodstained wings,
demons from the land of Hades

At the strike of twelve, of the demon bell
The dead will rise, from the heart of hell!

Halloween

The suppressant proceeding will burn the cross,
now the church belong to the dead
Jesus the deceiver will deceive you again, there's no help from your holy god!

[Repeat chorus]

This is the night, the night of doom
Witches and demons, dance around the chapel
Now the moon is turning black, we rape the virgin queen
This night of darkness, is the night of sin

We sacrifice a priest, by the sword he will die
Evil rules the night, the night of Halloween- so beware!

Halloween

[Repeat chorus]

[Repeat halloween 5x]

Back is the dawn cemeteries in silence
A new day has become, now the souls will rest in peace
Lucifer is the master, the beast has succeeded again
As it was in the beginning is new and ever shall be

Amen!
