Blessed souls in the midnight dark
Seen Jesus go up in sparks
Wonât you come to our holy feast
We will sacrifice a Christian priest

In the name of our master
In the name of our lord
To the cemetery we will go
See the Christians as our only foe

We turn our cross upside down
And our mind is spinning around

What is that, that seems to me so strange
Satanic birth, Satanâs son is born

Join us when the victory is won
And the priest they shall run
All the Christians screams in agony and pit
As the master burns a Christian city

The satanic troops are on their way
They going to make the Christians pay
The Christians take their weapon and load
When the masters troops march on the roadâ¦..
â¦â¦from hell

soon the sun and the morning rises
it will be the end of the Christian crises
all the people will remember
That Satanâs power must be protendered

In the name of our master
In the name of our lord
To the cemetery we will go
See the Christians as our only foe

All the humans think its over its not
Soon the priests will get it hot

What is that, that seems to me so strange
Satanic birth, satans son is bord

Satanâs son is born
Satanâs son is born
Satanâs son is born
Satanâs son is bornâ¦â¦..i was born
