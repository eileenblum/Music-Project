The fullmoon is uprising and the baby are offered âtil Satanâs return
We spill the blood on the altar and the Sabbath has begun

The Christians cries âcos they seen their place heaven burn
Angels set on fire and the demons are laughing, laughing until they die

Trust in evil, trust in lust, trust in Satanâs return
Trust in evil, trust in lust, trust in Satanâs return

The darkness makes the forces strong, The darkness possess our soul with evil
Now watch the masters eyes thereâs something strange inside

The master appear in full glory and pride and the blessed souls in heaven cries
No mercy from the evil souls in hell Christians you all burn in master Satanâs name

Christians runs in a circle screams of mercy cries of pain
Satan leaves no mercy master let âem not survive

Seven satanic hell preaches drink the blood of the Christians
Six hundred sixty six the epigraph they bore

Trust in evil, trust in lust, trust in Satanâs return
Trust in evil, trust in lust, trust in Satanâs return
