Beyond our limits of our mind
Beyond the horizons of our world
High above our skilled knowledge
And deep down under whatÂ´s good

Left here to die
In pain I cry
Black wings fly

I feel my heart stopped beating
I saw my body from above
Then I heard a mighty voice tell
(I welcome you to your eternal hell)

Left here to die
In pain I cry
Black wings fly

Descend to the ashes

Then all powers of hell releases
The preassure of pain reincarnate
The dark angel of death wake to crusade
The legions are strong again
Waiting at the last gate to march
And rule the earth at last
The prophecy of wise men becomes true
Antichrist, the beast will rise

I thought it all was a dream
But I could feel the pain
Alive I saw myself be sacrificed
To the lord of the dark hordes

Left here to die
In pain I cry
Black wings fly

Descend to the ashes
