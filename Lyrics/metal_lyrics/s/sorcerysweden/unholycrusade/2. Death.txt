Down in the valley, the village still asleep
The sun rises and a new day has begun
The villagers awakes, a new day has begun

The Reaper is out - collecting his souls
Following his victims - until their death

But no one noticed the stranger on the hill
Who carrying black rags which covers his head and arms
No one feel the chill wind from the north

The Reaper is out - collecting his souls
Following his victims - until their death

Day turn to night, the stranger moves downhill
With pride he walks down with his scythe
Someone is gonna follow him down tonight

Darkness have fallen in the valley over the village
A poor drunken old man, sits and beg in a corner
The angel of death will give him the gift of death

The Reaper is out - collecting his souls
Following his victims - until their death
