IÂ´m forged black by mankinds sin
I am the leader of the rotten pack
IÂ´m the one who always win
IÂ´m the one who cammands to attack

IÂ´m the ruler of hells troops
Against the angels we will fight
IÂ´m the mighty count of Hades
IÂ´m bring you death and destruction

IÂ´m your nightmare
IÂ´m the evil

My breath is chill as a winter night
Where I go itÂ´s always fear
My residents is build by bones and flesh
I drink your mothers blood every day

I am the hatred aggression and anger
I rule the eternal destiny
I decide who will die or not
And you stand high on my list

IÂ´m your nightmare
IÂ´m the evil

IÂ´m the judge of whatÂ´s wrong or right
IÂ´m the collector of long forgotten souls
IÂ´m the spirit of slaughered childs
IÂ´m the ghost in your dreams

IÂ´m the founder of old ancient lies
I rule the thunder wind and rain
I am the god of all gods
IÂ´m the stranger, IÂ´m the evil, IÂ´m the darkness
