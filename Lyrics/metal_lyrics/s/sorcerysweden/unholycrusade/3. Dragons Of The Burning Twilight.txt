The twilight traps the wings of the silent valley
Only the sound of dark cold wings speak
Furthest in horizon sound echoes of glaring horns
And suffering screams from dying men in battle
Battle [x4]

The silence fractures of keen screams and fierce halves
They only survived with victory in eyes and steel
They have found a well search for the campfires to burn
And then urge to a calm rest under a star-clear sky

Wings traps of thunder
Black as the night
Flying with pride
Dragons of the burning twilight

His limbs awakes by the sun-rays struck
Gazing at the slowly dying flame with weary eyes
An awful scent spreads when the sun turns black
Two enormous wings flaps as thunder
Thunder [x4]

Wings traps of thunder
Black as the night
Flying with pride
Dragons of the burning twilight

Black as the night, flying with pride
Turn mankind to ashes only the fire speaks
Turn brave warriors to burning corpses
No one can tell but the legend is eternal

Wings traps of thunder
Black as the night
Flying with pride
Dragons of the burning twilight
