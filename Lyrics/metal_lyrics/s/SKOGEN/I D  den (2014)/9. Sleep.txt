Below the crystal moon's fading
Where the sun has eternally failed
Awaiting the hour, the coveted hour
I leave the shores, slumbering pale

An exodus into darkness
On earthly soil I no longer walk
Discerning a presence arcane
I can hear the winds talk

Into eternal sleep
I now descend
Into eternal sleep
Here's where it ends
In death I dwell

Deep into the unknown
On earth, merely a guest
A beckoning silence
Through the yonder to eternal rest

Into eternal sleep
I now descend
Into eternal sleep
Here's where it ends
In death I dwell

I can see the waves of old
It is time for the final tide
Death has come, come to reap
Sending it's envoy to guide
Shadows gather, Charon's calling
Black is the river that runs deep
We set sail on forbidden waters
Dead but dreaming in eternal sleep

Into eternal sleep
I now descend
Into eternal sleep
Here's where it ends
In death I dwell
