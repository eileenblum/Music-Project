Vortex, a cluster of shadows
It's getting darker, a coveted night
There's a tunnel at the end of the light
Growing bigger, a twirling hole
Gaping wide to swallow the sun
The fogweaver's work has begun

Devoured into the lungs of nothingness
Deep within, a darkness ablaze
To shun the sun and all of its rays
Drain the light, shadowbuilder
Onward to neverending night
An ageless, tenebrous rite

Solarvore

There's no escaping this black void
No escaping the impending doom
No escaping the lucifugous gloom
All illumination eclipsed
No more light to rise in the east
The sun has drowned, the sun has ceased
