Driven by hunger for gain,
Drunk and high, to fast we rise.
Itâs vanity, profit and ego,
Deadly sins of our time.
Limitless our appetite,
Will we ever have enough?
Merciless we strive to grow,
Even though we have too much.
Limitless our appetite,
Will this madness never end?
Greedy eyes to blind to see
That every growth still has to end.

Profit, profit Ã¼ber alles,
Ãber alles in this world.
So come let us strive together,
Till the final banknote burns.
Vanity and greed and ego,
That is what sustains us all.
Profit, profit Ã¼ber alles,
Ãber alles in this world.

Like pestilence, like plagues of vermin,
Piles of money multiply.
To stand still is death,
Everything must grow.
Keeping profits, keeping profits high.
Merciless prosperity, even though the whole worldâs burning.
Doesnât matter who gets hurt,
Just to keep the profits turning.
Every day that you were swelling,
Till the day that you will see.
Without limits growth is cancer,
Growing inside you and me.

Profit, profit Ã¼ber alles,
Ãber alles in this world.
Profit, profit Ã¼ber alles,
Ãber alles in this world.
Greed, corruption, lies and power,
Form the base on which he stands.
Grow a profit, grow like cancer,
Grow, my darling banker count.
Grow a profit, grow like cancer,
Grow, my darling banker count.
