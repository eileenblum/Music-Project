Do you know what you want? You don't know for sure
You don't feel right, you can't find a cure
And you're gettin' less than what you're lookin' for
You don't have money or a fancy car
And you're tired of wishin' on a falling star
You gotta put your faith in a loud guitar

God gave rock and roll to you, gave gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to everyone
God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you, put it in the soul of everyone

If you wanna be a singer or play guitar
Man, you gotta sweat or you won't get far
Cause it's never too late to work nine-to-five
You can take a stand or you can compromise
You can work real hard or just fantasize
But you don't start livin' till you realize...

God gave rock and roll to you, gave gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to everyone
God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you, put it in the soul of everyone
