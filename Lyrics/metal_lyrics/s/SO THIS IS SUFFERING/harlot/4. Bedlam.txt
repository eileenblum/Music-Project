I'll be the witness of your death and the host of your flesh [2x]
I don't give a fuck about you.
Time is passing by. Your pulse has slowed down. You've met your fucking end. [2x]
I'd love to see you pray. You'll never be heard from the skies above [2x]
How can you believe in after-life, when your so-called "God" has let you sink this low?
I said I'd be the witness of your death. I'm the host of your flesh. [2x]
I begin to break you piece by piece, only to leave your bones forgotten.
I begin to break you piece by piece, only to leave your flesh for rotting.[2x]
I'll be sure to dig your body up.
We'll be seeing your face all over the news.
I'll be sure to dig your body up. [2x]
Your body will never be found.
