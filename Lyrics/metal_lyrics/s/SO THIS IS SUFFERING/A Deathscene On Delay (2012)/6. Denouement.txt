I'm finished feeling sorry for the ghost that still haunts me, sitting in it's corner cracking smiles while it taunts me. This guilt's become so daunting. Why you're still playing games with misery's beyond me. Leave me to lay alone with heartless thoughts looking at a poorly drawn portrait of a former self. I always knew that Eden wasn't too far from Hell. So let me look back at a time when I had the whole world in front of me. A time that once was, but could never be. Nobody told you to stop breathing. Nobody asked you to stop your heart from beating. So pathetic, living your life's every second like we're actors in a movie, but we don't have a happy ending do we? Take a second to think this through before you choke on those pills you threw down your throat to turn your pale face blue. Just to get me feeling sorry for you. I guess I should've known this was some shit you'd do. Don't forget to wrap my ambitions around your body and drag them down with you to the deepest sea. Where open arms welcome broken hearts is where you'll find me.
