I've written your name a thousand times on paper meant for love letters since I could never seem to find the right words to place my heart next to yours. So I've given up on trying and given you the time to notice when I am missing. Until then, I'll be burning pages marked with memories. Patience is a virtue they say, but I'm so sick of the waiting when even conversations seem so far away. Give me a better reason on why I should stay.
The pages; they meant nothing to me, yet somehow these ashes still mean everything. They've managed to keep their meaning, and keep constant while we are sleeping. Speak softly so they can't hear a thing. There was a time we had our chance, instead we kept affairs behind turned backs ashamed of our romance. A love like that could never last, but I won't settle for you to become just another part of my past. Strangers always try to take the pain away (pain away) but what the fuck do they know about a heart that's not their own?
This is foreign to me. I'd usually forget a name like yours by now... except you're more than just a pretty face I fooled and left too far from their closure. You seem worth the trouble, and if that means sacrificing friendships to see this through, then that's what we'll do. I'll hold my breath until I'm holding you. For the sake of our love, breathe in. In the end our hearts lie side by side. What's a tragedy if Romeo's afraid to die? I will wait to exhale.
