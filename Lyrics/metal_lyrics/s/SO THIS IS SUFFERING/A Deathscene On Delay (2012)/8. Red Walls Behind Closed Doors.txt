Failure followed me along with memories of wasted youth; scared and crying.
I forgot to live my life when I was too busy with dying. [x2]
What's the sense in trying if we all end up deceased?
Left alone to rot in peace.
Until then, I'll be keeping conversations with hedges and stone pretending I'm not really alone and talking to a casket that's six feet below.
You're not missing out on anything, but we miss you at home. Overwhelmed by life and death, or am I just being realistic?
Diverting my attention to lust painted with lipstick. Distraction is my one perversion. Distraction is my one and only perversion.
You could never understand what's left of this person. I've come to terms with this prison in all of my self-loathing.
My mind wanders in places I'd rather forget, for these answers never seem to keep me content. I'll be just fine.
I just need some time to clear my mind. To clear my head. Show me something you will never see. Tell me something you will never know.
If eyes are open windows to our souls, then look inside mine as nothing but cold wind blows.
I can hear the laughter coming from the walls as my life comes undone. Once filled with ambition, now left with none.
I should figure out why this life's become so cumbersome. I should figure why my life's become so cumbersome...
I'm losing staring contests with the barrel of a gun instead. Now, please excuse me as I take the time to clear my head.
(Dead)
