I've placed the pieces behind the shelf. If ever inclined to find them, they'll serve their purpose to remind myself of where I've been...so I can tell them to never believe in someone who doesn't believe in anything at all. They're only living life waiting for the sun
to rise and fall. There's no guilt in the pleasure when morals have no mother fucking measure. I am a skin-bag stretched beyond reason. One filled with fragile, aching bones of glass. Aching bones of glass bursting at the seams and ready to be seen. Ready to just break
and bleed. Ready to be anything. Ready to be anything but what this world has shown me. Fuck humanity. Proceed to breathe only to eat, sleep and breed? [x2] This world's got us pressed against the walls. Our backs decorated with every lie given in the fashion of blades
and daggers. The most honest words to ever be spoken: I am a liar, and I am a deadly sinner. I was bred to broken. I was made to be dislocated.
Tear away the loose skin and bare wounds of an honest man.
