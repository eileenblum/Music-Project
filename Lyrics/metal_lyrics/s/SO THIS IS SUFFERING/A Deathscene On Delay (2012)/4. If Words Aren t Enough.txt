Someone once told me friends "come and go," then they turned their back and walked away so I guess that makes it so. By the way, how much time did it take convincing my past to profess it's fucking love to me? Did you really think some easy sluts could get the best of
me? I called your bluff, now make your next fucking move. You're playing games with someone who plays them better than you. I do admit I was repulsed those nights outside my house when you would brag about the things that no one else should know. Flaunting the disgusting
imagery of her body's perfect symmetry sprawled across the bedsheets with you lying where I should be. But it's nothing compared to what she shares with me. To be her first was all you dreamt to be, but now your dreams of her are filled with me. All my friends turned out
to be fake, but you I truly have to thank. I thank you for ending something I thought was what I needed. I was cheated, and lied to me was all that "she" did...but at the time my life was seemingly perfect and you wanted to change that. Look where that's left us now. I
remember relating to every sad song that came on the radio, and clenching teeth when thinking of how much I fucking hated you. I promised myself you'd feel the misery that you put me through. The one she wants is still me, so I guess you'll have to kill me fucker.
