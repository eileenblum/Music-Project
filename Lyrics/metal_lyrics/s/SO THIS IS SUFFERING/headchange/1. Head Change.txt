Chapters torn down, burned inside and outside. These pictures and structures are staring at me. Smiling and laughing, they're taunting and provoking me. I've abandoned the desperate and now long for the weak. Taking everything they've ever wished for, even their own fucking dreams. Even their own dreams. Leaving only a trace, for me to follow the signs to discover salvation's something worth seeking. Worth seeking. There's nothing left but false hopes and promises. They were never kept from those who were the first to speak with me. An act of violence. This is an act of desperation. I am the son of the man that weeps. Just know that I'm doing the best that I can. Behind me, it follows. Agonizing. Attracted to shallow and un-fulfilled moments. For I will see the day of shame. Guilt will rise and consume with blame. Expand our minds with your subliminal ways. Eating my own flesh for fear of decay. Conflicting situations thrive on the thought of ending what was never complete. Gouging the eyes from this face will never show sincerity, only misguided convictions. The myth goes untold. The legend has spoken of a future to profit the life of his own. A never-ending seed, which roots consists of nothing but hatred and greed. Enter my thoughts. I never said this would be so appealing. I'm shouting the world from wretched black hearts who lead the way. Leaving the honest ones to follow behind me. Insecure gallows are far too deep. We're kicking and struggling only to breathe. I am the son of the man that weeps, just know I'm doing the best that I can. An act of violence. An act of desperation.
