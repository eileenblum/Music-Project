You've proven nothing to anyone...yet you continue to exist in your own made up world where people give a shit about what you have to say.
Well, I won't partake in this fantasy any longer.
No, not tomorrow, not today.
You heard that we were dead? Well, we're still fucking breathing. Still living.
All you are is another joke following every single trend to be something you will never be, so you still have to pretend.
I will not be conducted by your wishes or demands.
There is no one else in this fucked up world that I hate more than you.
You try so fucking hard to be something that you're not.
You go around giving them false impressions of yourself, but I can see your reality.
Where is your self-respect?
Go ahead, keep telling them that we are dead, you could be doing something better with your time instead [2x]
Close the God-damn curtains. I've seen enough of it.
Drop the God-damn act. This audience is unimpressed.
I've given all I could.
I've put too much work into this, to let you run with it.
You're so desperate for attention, you've gone and lost yourself.
So take a good look at yourself and see where you're standing. Now bow down and look up to me.
I'm so fed up with this, it's gotten old so quick [4x]
Fuck what you heard, this is our empire [1000x]
