Do you remember the letter you wrote? Just try and read it after I've slit your throat.
Everyone will have forgotten you. You were such a waste of life. [2x]
How can you sleep at night without me by your side? Did you ever realize how hard I'd tried?
I never thought things would ever get this bad. [2x]
So I guess this is what it comes down to...my knife and the chair you've been bound to. [2x]
In your last fucking moment, look me straight in the eyes.
You're the one who fucking chose this. Shut your mouth, save your lies.
You were such a waste of time.
