Face to face, oceans overwhelm us, decomposing our tender love.
Because every time I see your face I fall to my knees and become weak to it.
Was this your outline? If so good luck.

This is a constant battle between beating hearts
When will you learn to sit the fuck down?

Day and night I think of it, it's haunting all of my nightmares. This is something so disturbing. It is weak yet it's consuming.

Throw out the intentions of bettering yourself, you can go ahead and
cross those morals off your list....

but then you'll beg again and again
for my weakened craving,.. lonesome heart.
Fuck, there is no other solution to this.
Welcome to your abyss.

There it goes again and again, terrorizing. Because in every collision there's always a mismatch. So go ahead and tell them that I did you wrong, when you know you were immoral, so I look damn guilty.

Face to face, oceans overwhelm us, decomposing our tender love.
Standing still, knowing nothing of this, we make each other look like fucking fools. I can't even imagine what this would be like without the sin of lust.

Just the thought of you with him makes me fucking sick. Why the fuck do you still dwell in my dreams? Leave my life for good this time, slut.
