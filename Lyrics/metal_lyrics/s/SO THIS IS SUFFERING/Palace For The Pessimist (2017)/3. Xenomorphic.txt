Break the cancer of reality

Lost souls lost faces and memories
Helpless weak and divided endlessly

Make them suffer for eternity

They demanded war. Destruction of men,
Servants of god. Reaching for the sky to understand

Blinded by fallacies of fear and security. Disfiguring society.

Blinded by fallacies of fear and security.

Darkness follow swiftly can't overcome.

The dread and demise of men's fallen kingdom
A generation of torment, rejected dreams that fade.

Break the cancer of reality

Lost souls lost faces and memories
Helpless weak and divided endlessly

Make them suffer for eternity

Dismantle mortals of voracity embrace the anguish of severity

The vile swarm of the ignorant.

Will parish in the flames,

Of the coming enslavement,

Break the cancer of reality

Lost souls lost faces and memories
Helpless weak and divided endlessly

Make them suffer for eternity

Watch them burn! Burn!
