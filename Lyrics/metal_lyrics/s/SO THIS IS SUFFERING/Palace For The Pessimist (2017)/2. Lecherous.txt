Savor dreadful ambiguous shapes. Vile mind. Treachery.
Insane. Despised and wretched.
Toxic and unstable.

I gave my heart away. To build an empire.

Watch it all crumble and fall.
Watch the terror of death evolve [2x]

Pushing forward.
Never wanting to lose the chance. Recreation of the past.

Faces fading and defecating. Defecating.
The diminishing signs of life.

Bring forth the power and struggle. Seek penance and retribution. Skies fall from the heavens above. Absolute devastation.

I carry burdens of restless evil. That tower over the masses below.
Speak in tongues of revelations. Preaching as the pariah. Preaching as a martyr.

This is the second coming. Reach for every life you have.

There will be no mercy! [2x]

There will be no mercy. No hope or coming savior.
There will only be death. Fire rain upon us. Unforgiven lies.
