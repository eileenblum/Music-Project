[feat. Nick of Molotov Solution]Malnourished muscles twitch
Palms itch as I stitch together dollar bills to make things better
A way to remind myself that money won't last forever
Reaching for the exit &amp; running out of ties to sever

I guess I'll never learn that some things you can never turn back from
No turning back from this slow burning black abyss

[Nick]
They'll blast this blasphemy as
You're keeping count
Of sheep
Still in bed
Dreaming fast asleep

Keep dreaming, dreamer
But quit dreaming you'll keep her
Where you're headed
There's no time for sleep
Your best bet is to wake up &amp; leave her

But what if this is the selling of the soul?
I swear I'm only doing as I was told
Am I somehow doing the Devil's bidding

By writing words that these kids just aren't forgetting?

These damn rhymes are damning me
Well, show me a Hell I haven't seen
If there's a Heaven, then I hope I can still go there
Anything but getting carsick on roads that lead me to nowhere
So save my mother the worry, tell her I'll be just fine when I'll only be burning
