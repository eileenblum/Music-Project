Am I the only result of death and destruction? Why?
Am I nature's most fucked up creation?
Possessed obsession. And the sick burn alone with
The worst of infection.

Boiling skin known as the setting of the dead sun.
Decay from the dead ones. Stuck in this hell.

Seeking oppression.

Welcome to the palace for the sickening, accepting my fate.
A lust for agony. Unwanted and rotting.

Life wouldn't work in your favor. They'll refuse the hell that you savor,
And for the rest, extermination!

Everyone is dying around you. Love still hasn't found you
And 'til this day I'm not sure that it's bound to.

Life wouldn't work in your favor.
They'll refuse the hell that you savor,
And for the rest, extermination.

My mind is broken,
So how could I fix yours? We'll keep pretending, while death is sending me, horrid visions.

Horrid visions.
We'll keep pretending, while death is sending me,
Horrid visions.
