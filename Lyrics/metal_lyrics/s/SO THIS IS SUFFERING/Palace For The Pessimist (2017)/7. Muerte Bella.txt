Sacrifice everything you've done for their lives,
No shameless faze,
Only lies to your face,

No peace on this rotten earth.
No vision of live, only war. Our end is near.

Collected disease,
Feeding on your corpse!
Death is above me. Unholy future.
Resurrected. Dead to the rest. Survival live without bliss.

No reason to love,
The world betrayed me.

Follow your disbelief!
As it destroys you within.

Burn the world patiently.
Are there illusion only tricking me? Hunger and slaughter,
Is all that left to offer

Frail faces fading. Massacre.

I've realized this world is pathetic,
Unwanted devils seeking me.
Time again being dammed with deception.
Creator of you're existence.

A life destroyed within. Feeling free
Deteriorate with me.

Plagued from the sun.
Burning from the sins. Drenched myself in guilt again.

Can you taste the pestilence? Focused on benevolence
Exert torment underneath. Lifeless to vitality
