Aged, faded away. Staring at the sky. Clouded thoughts of impurity.
Make no mistake, there's a price to pay. Where do you find yourself?

Distorted scarring faces. Disgorged from the surfaces.
It's what's feeding into your soul. Welcome deception and control.

Dying from this war, restrained by all toxic breathing, idolize imprisoned gods.
Decaying from the system.

Never ending darkness. Putrid destroyers, the last days of mankind. Decomposing in my grave.

Faces of immortality!
Vile serpents,
Will you show me the way? [2x]

Shattered days, scarred and sickening.
Demented world brings us pain.
A place to die, shallow victims.
Frail followers of the new reign.

Tolerate the unforgiven. Unable to withstand malice.

Summon by misery. Taken by apathy. [2x]

Don't praise your illusions that feast,
Eating away illusive sympathy. Hollow, deceitful, agony.
Degrading the lives of humanity. [2x]
