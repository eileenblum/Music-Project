For 15 years I've been stuck in misery
Despite the cost of a war against me.
Don,t forget to runaway
I've been dead to you all!

Divided, dead and broken,
Shattered promises and empty homes.
A prophecy for told

Punishable by dead.
Crawling through the land of the free.
You speak with vanity.
You all failed me.

Death screams through the land of the free.
You all speak with vanity

Never had a choice,
No comfort nor friend.
Prisoner to mindless.
Trapped into the abyss.

Moving bodies frantic and horrid
Waiting for the cancer to feed.
All blind unable to seek,
Is it all a dream?

Motivate the blind and weak.
Forever dead and rotting.
Dead and rotting.

You never had faith in me!

When it all comes down to it,
You will bow to me,
Pale, putrid, and raped
From your innocence.

All the burdens you ride,
Will die inside !

Memories start haunting me.
Dead memories haunting me! [2x]
