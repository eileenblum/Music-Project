Since day one we consider enslavement.
Abortion, a forbidden statement.
A nation terrorized by extortion.

Inflicting chaos and invasion.
Poisoned and mindless. Devastation.
Contamination of the swarm

Trapped behind steel doors.
Submerge your filthy ways,
Dishonor. Falling to your knees.
Armageddon

Stay awake, wide awake. Pledge to me
Stay awake, wide awake. Pledge to me
I beg you please to live without me

Feeding into the man know as my enemy.
A cold dark world and catastrophe.
A prophecy untold and anarchy.

Feeding into the man know as my enemy
