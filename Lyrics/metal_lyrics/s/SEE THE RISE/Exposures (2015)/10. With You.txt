I try to do what you want me to
But every time I try, I fall again
When will I win? When will I win?
When will I win? And now I wonder why I try
Destiny was different than a dream
Destiny was more than what it seemed
Now Iâm caught in the middle of me and you
Iâm caught up with what I want and what you tell me to do
and all I want to do is put my trust in you
I know Iâve failed before, but Iâm not running anymore
Because with you Iâm so much more than what I was
I try to do, what youâve called me to
But every time I try, I start to doubt again
When will I win? When will I win?
When will I win?
When will my purpose be revealed?
Destiny was different than a dream
Destiny was more than what it seemed
Now Iâm caught in the middle of me and you
Iâm caught up with what I want and what you tell me to
and all I want to do is put my trust in you
I know Iâve failed before, but Iâm not running anymore
Because with you Iâm so much more than what I was
No more is my god in the mirror
My reflection has never been clearer
It doesnât matter what I do
As long as itâs reflecting you
This web that you weave
This hope thatâs been believed
Trust Me! Trust Me!
Trust me and you will do what Iâve called you to
