I give up. I quit
Iâm tired of all of it
I get to the edge but I fear the fall
I think I can achieve it all
I ask for a purpose but ignore your call
How many times will I approach life so passively
Jumping when others do but not when you tell me to
Itâs peer pressure at its best and Iâm at my worst
Itâs a life Iâve chosen, a life becoming cursed
I canât seem to find a way to get this off my mind
I say a prayer but faith is hard to find (I feel so confined)
I understand this is all part of a plan
Thatâs why I fear the fall (Sin has taken it all)
and I want it all, but âallâ is not enough
I claim humility but youâre calling my bluff
Iâm not as tough as I claim to be
I forget that youâre strength is within me
Oh my God, Iâve tried so hard to find some peace of mind
If you jump, know that Iâll jump too.
No one else knows how to get back to you
I canât seem to find a way to get this off my mind
I say a prayer but faith is hard to find (I feel so confined)
I understand this is all part of a plan
Thatâs why I fear the fall (Sin has taken it all)
Iâll carry my cross
Cross my heart and hope to die

I canât seem to find a way to get this off my mind
I say a prayer but faith is hard to find (I feel so confined)

I canât seem to find a way to get this off my mind
I say a prayer but faith is hard to find (Iâll free your heart and mind)
I understand this is all part of a plan
Thatâs why I fear the fall (Oh, God Iâll answer your call)

Iâll fight for faith to bear the mark of a martyr
To bear the mark of the survivors
