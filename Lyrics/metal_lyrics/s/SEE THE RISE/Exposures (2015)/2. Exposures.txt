Your faith is defined by only what you see
Your past infects your theology
See, for me I see past the mask you put on
Youâre just trying to deny where you belong
Keep saying you know when you really donât
You say youâll grow up and change but we know you wonât
Youâre so broken and you think you have a clue
Canât you just see life the way that I do?
The most dangerous thing about a liar (liar)
is when they think what theyâre saying is true
(what theyâre saying is true)
The most terrifying thing about a mirror (mirror)
is when you see that the liar is you
Exposing the person you really are
Thereâs no need to hide your battle scar
The crimson lines on your wrist show the real you
The life perceived by a lie becoming true

Iâll never give up on you âtil your last breath
Iâll never give up on you âtil your last breath

The most dangerous thing about a liar (liar)
is when they think what theyâre saying is true
(what theyâre saying is true)
The most terrifying thing about a mirror (mirror)
is when you see that the liar is you

Iâll never give up hope for the broken
Iâll never give up hope for the lost
Iâll never give up hope for the hopeless
Iâll never give up until your last breath
Until your last breath
So breathe, just breathe
Breathe
