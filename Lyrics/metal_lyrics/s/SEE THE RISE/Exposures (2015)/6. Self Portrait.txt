When a still frame stares me right in the face
I canât find a feeling even close to grace
When picture frames donât show the real you
When an image canât describe what youâve been though

Can you tell me, honestly, what you see
when your self portrait is your true identity?

I wear my heart on my sleeve
Itâs so hard to believe that my pictureâs worthâ¦
Is worth a thousand words
In you, I made the right choice but how can I be the voice
when I can't see myself the way that you do?

When a frame from the wall stares me in the face
I still feel I havenât discovered my place
When picture frames show what I donât want to see
Such a broken mislead identity

Can you tell me, honestly, what you see
when your self portrait is your true identity?

Oh God, Iâm such a mess
My picture doesnât show the real me
Oh God, where is my identity?
I canât find it!
