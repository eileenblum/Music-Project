Itâs hard to say that Iâve given up
Itâs hard to say that Iâve grown up
The stage was set and I just walked away
not caring about a thing you say
But when I gave it up, pursuing the âright pathâ...âright wayâ
...something was missing
I had silenced my screams
Still you were listening
I gave it up, gave it up all to be haunted by your voices
And after all this time, this has become my biggest fight
Now Iâd give anything to be with you in the lights
Itâs hard to say but I can say I tried
Itâs hard to say that a passion died
The stage was set and I just gave it up
I fell under the pressure and had enough
But when I gave it up, pursuing the âright pathâ...âright wayâ
...something was missing
I had silenced my screams
Still you were listening
I gave it up, gave it up all to be haunted by your voices
And after all this time, this has become my biggest fight
Now Iâd give anything to be with you in the lights

These lights they shine for you!
If my words can save you
Iâll speak them until my last breath
Iâll speak them until I die

I gave it up, gave it up all to be haunted by your voices
And after all this time, this has become my greatest fight!

I gave it up, gave it up all to be haunted by your voices
And after all this time, this has become my biggest fight
Now Iâd give anything to be with you in the lights

These lights they shine for you!
