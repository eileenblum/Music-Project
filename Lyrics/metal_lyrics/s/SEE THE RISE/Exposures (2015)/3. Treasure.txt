For so long I believed there could be no changes for me
Is this the me that I want to be?
I ripped apart this broken heart
Please, just call me by name and Iâll be who you want me to be
I came here with a hole in my heart
A lost soul searching for a new start
I based my life off a hollow broken lie
Expecting love to always end in goodbye
For so long I believed there could be no changes for me
Is this the me that I want to be?
I ripped apart this broken heart
Please, just call me by name and Iâll be who you want me to be

Thatâs when I looked in your eyes and I was changed forever
Who could have known that my brokenness could lead to something so much better?
For so long I believed there could be no changes for me
Is this the me that I want to be?
I ripped apart this broken heart
Please, just call me by name and Iâll be who you want me to be

You have my heart forever
This unconditional love is yours
Iâll fight every battle I have in this life with you in my heart

For so long I believed there could be no changes for me
Is this the me that I want to be?
I ripped apart this broken heart
Please, just call me by name and Iâll be who you want me to be

Iâll fight every war and battle together
The X marks the spot, my treasure--
