Seduced into a path of destruction
Your innocence at the cost of seduction
She destroys your heart until your vows are broken
Speaks you her words until her words are spoken
With only words, sheâll lead you away
Youâll break every promise in every word you say
And in a moment you will give it all away
a lifetime of promise now broken in a day
Seduced into a path of deception
Oh, what an unfaithful impression
You did this to yourself. You're wild at heart
Your passion will kill you and tear you apart
Keep these words
Keep these commands
Guard your heart or you will die
With only words, sheâll lead you away
Youâll break every promise in every word you say
And in a moment you will give it all away
a lifetime of promise now broken in a day
Now then my son, pay attention!
Her house is a highway to the grave leading to the chambers of death
With only words, sheâll lead you away
Youâll break every promise in every word you say
And in a moment you will give it all away
a lifetime of promise now broken in a day

Now with your faith, you wonât be pushed away
So keep every promise in every word you say
And in a moment, youâll walk away
A lifetime is promised in a new day
