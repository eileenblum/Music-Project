Standing in the storm, the earth floods and washes the weak
and we are left to seek dry land and salvation of our hope
This tide will lead to a waterfall with water so deep and faith so small
So stand tall and donât let the waves take you away
Donât let the tide take you away
Donât let the waves lead you astray
Find hope in hopeless and find your faith in the storm

We will find our hope in the hopeless
Our hope is in you
This tide will lead to a waterfall
I cry for help, an unanswered call
So stand tall and donât let the storm take you away

Donât let the tide take you away
Donât let the waves lead you astray
Find hope in hopeless and find your faith in the storm

We will find our hope in the hopeless
Our hope is in you
Hear my voice as I call

We will find our hope in the hopeless times
We will find our hope in you
Donât let the tide take you away
Donât let the waves lead you astray
Find hope in hopeless and find your faith in the storm

We will find our hope in the hopeless
Our hope is in you
