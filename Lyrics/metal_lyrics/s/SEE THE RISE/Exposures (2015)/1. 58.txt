There was a time you were once full of darkness, but now you have become light
Therefore, let the light guide your steps
For this light within you produces only what is good and right and true
And discern what brings pleasure to the Creator
Take no part in worthless deeds of wickedness, but instead expose them
It is disgusting even to speak of the things that are done in the dark
But the light will reveal the true nature of darkness
For anything exposed becomes visible, and anything that is visible is light

Therefore it is told:
âAwake! O sleeper,
Rise from the dead,
And Christ will shine on you.â
