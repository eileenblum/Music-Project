Oh my beloved, donât take the path of least resistance
I promise it doesnât pay
and Oh my beloved, donât take the word of the fallen
Donât believe a word they say
Sacrifice comes with strength
and that strength comes with salvation
I failed you for the first time
Such a classic crime
Show me the meaning a second chance
I failed you once before
But not anymore
Show me the meaning a second chance

Come with me
Iâll show you an easy way out
with manipulation and every single doubt
Iâll show you what your life is all about
Youâre just a worthless nothing and thatâs all youâll ever be

Come with me Iâll show you how to be âBelovedâ
Itâs the only loved youâll ever be
I failed you for the first time
Such a classic crime
Show me the meaning a second chance
I failed you once before
But not anymore
Show me the meaning a second chance
Let me out!
Iâve been here for so long
Let me out!
I feel like Iâm as good as gone!

Your fate is in your faith
You have more than just a second chance
