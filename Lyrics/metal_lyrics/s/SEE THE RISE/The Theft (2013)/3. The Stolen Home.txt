You donât deserve this baby, no not one bit
I see the world being unfair to you but please donât quit
This bad example is no excuse to give up love's design
Youâve just had a bad example on how itâs defined
Iâll send my armies of angles to protect my love
Donât let her become a victim of her family tradition
But help be a God send from above

Oh baby, please donât cry
You were never the reason we said goodbye
Donât be scared to give love a try
All because your home was victim to a lie

Iâll pray and help you though your exampleâs mistakes
How love should be allowed to bend but how it never breaks
Iâll go to great lengths to make sure you have my attention
You shouldnât be in the middle of familyâs intervention
Wipe the tears out of your eyes
Your life is not something to compromise
I will never jeopardize daddyâs beloved
I will put you first, my dear

Oh baby, please donât cry
You were never the reason we said goodbye
Donât be scared to give love a try
All because your home was victim to a lie

Oh my dear, you can rise above it all
Ignore the worldâs deception and answer the call
My darling, I pray that you will have it all
My darling, Iâll be there to catch you when you fall

Oh baby, please donât cry
You were never the reason we said goodbye
Donât be scared to give love a try
All because your home was victim to a lie

*Open wounds from you became scars on us both. But you were not the only one who caused those wounds.
There was another, there was a friend. Someone I could trust to have my back, but it turned out that selfishness was the knife and when I had my back turned, more wounds pierced my skin.*
