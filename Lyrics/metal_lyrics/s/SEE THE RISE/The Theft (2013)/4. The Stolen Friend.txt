May God have mercy on your soul, 'cause I won't.
I won't even justify what you have done
Run, run away a pray you never see my face once more
'Cause that'll be the moment that we settle the score
I guess you're a loser, a creature of habit
A real life in your reach but you're too stupid to grab it

I will forgive, but I won't forget
I will forgive, but I won't respect

Was I too blind to see the lies you said to me?
You left my eyes deceived
My trust you can't retrieve
You were too fake to see your lies won't be killing me
I'm glad you had to leave
Oh, God, I can't believe

How can anyone stand to look at your face?
You bring the meaning of friend to disgrace
I'll spread the news all over the place
That you're a sad, sick waste of space
You're broken and you cover it up with your humor
But you'll soon realize it's a deadly tumor eating away at your need for control
I hope it kills you and eats away at your soul

I will forgive, but I won't forget
I will forgive, but I won't respect

Was I too blind to see the lies you said to me?
You left my eyes deceived
My trust you can't retrieve
You were too fake to see your lies won't be killing me
I'm glad you had to leave
Oh, God, I can't believe

How could you look in the mirror and call yourself a man?
How could you steal away this life for your selfish plan?
How could you do this?
Oh!

I will stay strong but a buried casket is where you belong
As for you, the guilt should slowly eat you away
And then, my stolen friend, you'll be your own living prey

*Out of the darkness started to come a light, a new leaf turned and a new lesson learned.
The continued blessings were relevant, but I couldnât help but feeling I was still robed, robed at a chance of a new love.*
