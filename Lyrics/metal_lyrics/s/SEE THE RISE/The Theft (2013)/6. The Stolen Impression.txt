Let this go!

We had it all planned out and things were looking good
We built ourselves up from the ground and gave what we could
We had the drive and we kept on and you did too but you weren't in for the music
How could we trust you?

With a turn of events, You sold us out
Dead in our tracks is now a new route
I shout because you donât even know
It was a blessing that we let you go

You ruined your chance to live this dream
You gave everything for a worthless fling
Your fake relationship just wonât last
You're easily put in the past
You don't even know the meaning of passion
Too busy chasing the latest fashion
My horoscope should have gave me a sign that you were out of your mind

We live for the music and we thought you did too but stealing hearts and crushing dreams is all you can do
Your friends and your family love you
But now that you took off your mask, your passion and love is gone
It makes no sense to ask

You ruined your chance to live this dream
You gave everything for a worthless fling
Your fake relationship just wonât last
You're easily put in the past
You don't even know the meaning of passion
Too busy chasing the latest fashion
My horoscope should have gave me a sign that you were out of your mind

Now you will weigh the weight of the world on your soul
Fighting a battle we all just let go

You ruined your chance to live this dream
You gave everything for a worthless fling
My horoscope should have gave me a sign that you were out of your mind

*Out of the ashes came a new fire that no one could ignite expect for God himself. The fire could not be extinguished by hollow wounds or open threats. I knew my enemy wanted to bring me down, wanted to move me into running from the truth and to a false identity. These
feelings were not out of the ordinary. Only this time around, I will not be deceived.*
