Oh, God save me
The thief has come to kill and destroy
Heâs used this world as his moving decoy
You stop and you stare as the world passes by
You never think to act or even question why
Ask away!

About the way you feel and why you feel it and now canât seem to shake it
Your heart keeps beating on as it feels so wrong
Youâre breathing just to make it

You better watch your back, heâs on attack
Heâs got you in his scope when you need to cope
So donât close your eyes, he works in disguise

Here comes the thief to do more than just steal, kill, and destroy
Heâll make this world something you wonât want to live
Or even worse, you could become so passive that you let life pass you by

Iâm gonna scare the hell out of you
Until you see this the way that I do

You better watch your back, heâs on attack
Heâs got you in his scope when you need to cope
So donât close your eyes, he works in disguise
Here comes the thief

I will never be deceived
I'll never be deceived
I will never be deceived
Oh, God, I'll never be deceived!

I'll never be deceived!

*I have fought your deception, the worldâs deception, and fought the enemy himself. You came to steal, kill and destroy, but my God came to give me life. Now watch me live it to the full.*
