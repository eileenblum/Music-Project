Youâve got a lot of nerve and now Iâll get what I deserve
Well I already know itâs obvious
So now letâs put this all to rest
I wasted so much time
So Iâll take back what is mine

Spring has come and made everything new
Summer turned a new leaf just for you
Falling into change, a shot at new romance
Frozen acceptance into a new second chance

Iâll get back all my time
Iâll find someone I can call mine
You tried to steal my heart and throw it out to sea
But itâs here with me and I gave away the key
To God, itâs up to him to find someone I can trust
Someone not filled with lust

Spring has come and made everything new
Summer turned a new leaf just for you
Falling into change, a shot at new romance
Frozen acceptance into a new second chance

A new leaf turned, a new lesson learned
Iâll be better off
Iâve got my eye on a new season

Spring has come and made everything new
Summer turned a new leaf just for you
Falling into change, a shot at new romance
Frozen acceptance into a new second chance

*Second chances came by faith, but the impression was still there.
The impression that I would have to live with for the rest of our lives, the impression that you gave our friends that we had it
all planed out. When really, you had a different plan.*
