Oh baby, baby the way you lead me on
And yet you had him until the break of dawn
The way you lead me onto the edge
And yet, you're the one that broke the pledge
Uh huh

You're following in your mother's footsteps like you've always feared
You've always seen life for what it is but didn't like how it appeared
To me, I was always in this fighting for the long haul
But to you I guess we never had "it all"

So go take your sad excuse for a happy life
You don't know the meaning of the word wife
So take the knife right out of my back
So I can be the one that's on the attack

This all is way too much
I can't believe you think this is OK
This all is way too much
I can't believe you would throw this away

And I'll get what I deserve
I'll get what I deserve

Love is patient and love is kind
But you're not kind and I'm running out of patience

You took the coward's way out when you choose to cheat
Now the thought of losing you has been so bitter sweet
Absence doesn't make the heart grow founder
It will only kill you and make me stronger

Love is patient and love is kind
But you're not kind and I'm running out of patience

I was your guardian angel
You left me face down
Karma's on its way back, back around

*Six years of what we worked to achieve was destroyed by a lust filled month. Things that were once ours, became his and hers and left nothing but one. One innocent soul who didnât deserve this kind of heartache. One piece of heaven, put through hell.*
