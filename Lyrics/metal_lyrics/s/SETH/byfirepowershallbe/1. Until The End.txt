In this deepest night the moon is watching the world
Can you feel the end is near, the end is real,
Time has come to realize...
Time has come for you to close your eyes
Now, the war is one, angels are forever gone,
Never mind the black blood who was falling from the sky...

The end is near, the end becomes real,
Time has come for you to close your eyes,
Time has come to realize...
With the nightlife has gone away

Now the war is one, forever,
Never mind the black blood
Who was falling from the sky
With the night, angels are gone away

In this cold world, he used to look at the moon,
He feels the end deep inside
Time has come to cry, time has come to die,
With the night, life is gone away
The frozen wind has taken his last breath
