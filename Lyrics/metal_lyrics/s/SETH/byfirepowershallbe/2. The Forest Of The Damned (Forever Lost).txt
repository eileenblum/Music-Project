Lost in the obscure forest
Just lighted by the silver moon
I heard the howlings of the wolves
Then I understood their message

The war against the world of living was declared
And will necessarily end with a flood of blood
Then I descried a vision of a new world
A different world, the purest world

Lying in this deepest vast forest
I was dreaming of a new age
When my brother wolf called me
To take part of their last crusade

Now wolves are ready to fight
And their red eyes are full of hate
The common rune of mankind must tremble
Cause the end of the world is near

... And suddenly, they understood
That they were lost... forever lost

With honor, pride and courage,
The arm of obscurity will invade the earth
With fear, terror and sadness,
The mortals head the dirges of the wolves

Life is simply ridiculous
Life should not be lived
If you do not belong to the elite,
Your blood will be spilled...
