These unknown landscapes are,
For us, another battlefield
The quest of glory and immortality
Sets on fire our hearts

We will get the stars
Worship the moon and the ancient gods
We will stand for
The symbol of our eternal power

The road leads us to victory
Forever, the throne will be ours
By fire, our enemies shall perish
By fire, our power will be...

In her eyes, I read our destiny
Single, imposing and legendary
While an eternity, she will guide us
And keep the flame burning

Now, the kingdom is conquered
The earth will know darkness
And in our hands, dwells
The life of humanity

The road leads us to victory
Forever the throne will be ours
While an eternity, I will guide them
And keep the flame burning
