Visions of an unknown graveyard,
A supreme and perfect area,
Where every former soul prevails,
When roles turn into an anti-system.

I was cursed during this terrestrial existence,
I am hence praised,
We were cursed during this wordly life,
We are hence worshiped.

When human's father , falling fast,
Leaves its dwelling to those in greatness deserving.
The mortal sin remains the only covenant
To usurp this eternal place.

I was cursed during this terrestrial existence,
I am hence praised,
We were cursed during this wordly life,
We are hence worshiped.

There,humans' prayers nourish our new spirits,
Antithesis to their scornful origin ! !
