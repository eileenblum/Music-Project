Murder the spectre of humankind !
May the light flash
From the abject open scar
That appears before my eyes

I've become the Unbearable
The man in God's image.
When man hates man,
When bloodshed
Isn't enough to contain hate.
When decadence is all
And your thousands of lives
Resonnate in me
Like a death hymn
When the spectacle of your acts
Soils the ruins of your moral
When your beliefs are only
The foundations of your requiem,
And when the instigators of holy vice
Come to exult and penetrate
Souls with a liberating,
And cynical sighâ¦

" I murder the spectre of humankind
So that the light flash at last
From the abject depravity
That became our world "
