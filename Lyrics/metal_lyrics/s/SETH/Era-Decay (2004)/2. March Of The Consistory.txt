Transcendental gathering
Summit of the divine offspring
Ceremony of those ultimate mates
Longing for a desperate fate

Believing in protection
In passion you'll miss salvation
Aware of human's energy
Through affliction we've reached ataraxy

Staring at organized circles
While drinking their vital liquid
With irony we all gaze at each attempt
To revive the long-awaited religious apathy

Believing in protection
In passion you'll miss salvation
Aware of human's energy
Through affliction we've reached ataraxy

Unchained in an intolerable system of thoughts
Poison will gradually take place
While the process of contamination has begun
The cessation of your mystic march will be your fate
