Recollections of dicey territories 
Where I dreamed myself away
I was only my consciousness and nothing else 
And in the mind of the sun they were all dicing with death

With pain they howled in the heart of the world
But screaming my lungs out there was nothing to hear
In the mind of the sun there was nowhere to hide and everything to fear

Wrapped by emptiness trapped in loneliness
Far beyond, they were all dancing on the shiny solar beam
As the new age was glently looming

Earth cracks, human veins
Scattered roots, glued fingers
Slowly growing like creeping snakes
And far beyond, they were all dicing with death

Feet in the dust, hands in the ash
With prayers and hopes some tried to make sense 
Of the unfathomable mystery 
Releasing the raven to search for the water land
They believed the future was here
Sucked out in the remaining salt 
From Yam Suph, no longer a water of hope

Wrapped by emptiness trapped in loneliness
Far beyond, they were all dancing on the shiny solar beam
And far beyond, they were all dicing with death

Earth cracks, human veins
Scattered roots, glued fingers
Slowly growing like creeping snakes
And far beyond, they were all dicing with death

Et au coeur de ce monde au loin ils hurlÃ¨rent 
Un cri rÃ©sonnant Ã  travers ces sols dÃ©racinÃ©s 
Croyant que l'avenir Ã©tait lÃ  avec leurs pÃ¨res 
Car ce monde se devait de subsister 

A l'infini ils eurent dansÃ© sur le souffle du soleil

Et croyant que l'avenir Ã©tait lÃ  avec leurs pÃ¨res 
Leurs priÃ¨res trahissaient Ã  prÃ©sent les peurs
Celles qui se dessinaient d'heure en heure
Celles du dÃ©racinement salutaire
