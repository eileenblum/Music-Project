They tried to kill my eyes
But they will get fire and burn

Only the ashes of your world
Shall remain for ever sterile
For the dead will make sure
That nothing grows again.

Make me blind and I swear
I will burn your world down
And if I shall perish on fire
I would rise as Phoenix

As the Phoenix just flies
To burn you at the stake,
Endlessly

Killing, killing, kill my eyes

And as the dead shall rise
To walk on your ashes
They shall trample your remains
And the memories I have of you
Shall vanish.

Make me blind and I swear
I will burn you world down
And if I shall perish on fire
I would rise as Phoenix

And as the dead shall rise
To walks on your ashes
My soul shall be purified from that typical folly

As heaven is on my side
As my faith is boundless
Light shall pierce my eyes again
And my tears shall clean the pain

Make me blind and I swear
I will burn your world down
And if I shall perish on fire
I would rise as Phoenix
