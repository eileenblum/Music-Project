Carved from crumbling walls 
Painted black with feathers of hope
Gold leaves strangling the neck
You snatch the souls from the jaws of death

As the sound of your shaking breath 
Slowly quivers down the backbone
Dark bird shadows nourished by your own
People's fears solemnly rise in the distance

Corpses to the jackles buried in the mud 
Rotting black colours of decaying limbs 
Corpses to the jackles lowered in the dust
Rotting stench seeping into the nostrils 

He whose heart is heavy with sin 
Feeding on Corpses
He whose heart is heavy with sin 
shall be ripped to pieces

You weigh the scales for the dead 
In desperate search for eternity 
Scavengers or guardians of hope ?
how (actually) pure is your heart ?
