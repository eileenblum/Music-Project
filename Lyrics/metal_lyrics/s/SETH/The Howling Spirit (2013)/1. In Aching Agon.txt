THIS IS THE NECESSARY INTERLUDE YOU STRIVE NOT TO SEE
THE ENLIGHTENED STEP WITH NO MORE MERCY
THE NEEDED REVELATION FOR THE NEW AGE TO BE

GIVE ME ONE PIECE OF YOUR SOUL
AND YOU'LL JOIN OUR GREAT CIRCLE 
GIVE US A LITTLE PIECE OF A GREAT BIG SOUL
AND YOU'LL JOIN THE UNIVERSAL SPIRIT

AS THE LONG-AWAITED FLOOD IS BREWING
THE COLLAPSE OF YOUR COCOON HAS BEGUN
COZ MAN IS ACHING TO CREATE BEYOND THE SINGLE NEED
MAN IS ACHING TO DEFY THE UNIVERSAL LAW
AND WHILE THE RAIN SHALL HIT
MAN IS STILL IN DIRE NEED..

IN ACHING AGONY YOU SHALL
BURY YOUR RITES AND BURY YOUR CREEDS
IN ACHING AGONY YOU SHALL
BURY YOUR RITES AND BURY YOUR FEARS

HOW MANY EARS WILL YOU NEED TILL YOU HEAR 
THEIR DESPERATE CRIES AND FEEL THEIR DREADFUL SIGHS ?
HOW MANY FEET WILL YOU NEED TILL YOU CROSS
THE OPEN SEA YOU STRIVE NOT TO SEE ?

IN ACHING AGONY YOU SHALL
BURY YOUR RITES AND BURY YOUR CREEDS
IN ACHING AGONY YOU SHALL
BURY YOUR RITES AND BURY YOUR FEARS
