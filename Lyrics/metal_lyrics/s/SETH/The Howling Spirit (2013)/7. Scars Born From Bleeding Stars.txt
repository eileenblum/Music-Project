Decaying hawk
Howling in the nest
Surrounded by bramble stems

Thorns slashing like tongues
Made of glass
Feeling the smell
Of the approaching sun
Will your grane feathers
Forever remain
Forever remain

Spectres rising from
Underneath mirrored
In the watery air
Out of the burning manorhouses
They spread like
Venereal disease

Maninals caught
In the nest of thorns
In the nest of despair
Your domain's soul is
No longer yours

Universal abandon
Self-slaughter
In the nest of despair
Your domain's soul is
No longer yours
And never will be
And never will be

Spectres rising from
Underneath mirrored
In the watery air
Out of the burning manorhouses
They spread like
Venereal disease

[2x]
Shattered dreams
Blessed yearnings
Scars born from bleeding stars

Rhythms of doom
Reptiles in gloom
Baptized in holy sewage
Spread like venereal disease

[2x]
Shattered dreams
Blessed yearnings
Scars born from bleeding stars

Scars born from bleeding stars
