The land of no return
It's quiet here
No life forms
And no calls get through
Communication runs cold

We were only concepts
We were only dreams

One ear to the earth
One eye on heaven
Will the stars grow between us
Until we finally disappear?

One ear to the earth
One eye on heaven
We are strange mirrors
When we fall off the map

Where are the ships on these sea-less maps?
Who will cross the bone-drift
Moonless night?

Refracting into a thousand colours
From the light to consume and divide

Blinking out like a lost lighthouse
Somewhere in forgotten zones

Grant us oh oracle
Of the grave-ward eye
One glimpse throught
The veiled temple of light

Sulphur grief priests
Drip down from the lashes
Bell-metal chimes
The toll of death marches

The toll of death marches...

The land of no return
It's quiet here
No life forms
And no calls get through
Communication runs cold

Out there we are truly nameless
Out there we're null and void
Out in the open we are everywhere
Scattered strangers waiting for something to occur
For the emptiness to consume us...
Will the end be ever near?

I beg the truth but fear to ask my purse lips move but are incapable of speech
Repeating ghost on endless tides
Can only salute in gestures and smiles
