[Lyrics : Vicomte Vampyr Arkames]

Ready for a near deathâ¦experienceâ¦

Spiritual transition
Physical atraction
Conciousness abolition
Sexual perversion

Emotional abstraction
(slow) killing depression
Amphetamine logic
(this is) a monumental dementia

I want you to be the only one
to be down in a hole
to destroy this empty world
or to leave this filthy planet

Darkness is a gift, feel it inside of you
Darkness is a gift, feel me inside of youâ¦

Take it or do it but
Leave this fucking planet !
Take it or do it now !

(feel the devil inside)

Before leaving this fucking planet
Destroy it again and again and again and again

Before escaping this christian world
Destroy it again ! again !

Before leavingâ¦ this fucking planet
Destroy it again and again and again and again!

Before burning this holy world
Leave itâ¦now!

Take it or do it but
Leave this fucking planet !
Take it or do it now !

Destroy me, now !

Thanks to lord.byleth for sending track #3 lyrics.
