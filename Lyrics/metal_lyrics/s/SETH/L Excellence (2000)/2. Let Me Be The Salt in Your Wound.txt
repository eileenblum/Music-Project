[Lyrics : Fenris Gylve Nagell]

Let me be the salt in your wound
The flow of your mind has coagulated
( you're ) wishing somehow to bleed
for the cause that no one willâ¦ heed

confidence in illusions
bravery of the garish
honour of the despised
spawned from the cradle of unmight

pathetic distression, path of anger
your insignifiance drowned by respect
currently ( you're ) confident - aging in embarassment
your future ( is ) deleted, bathe in disgrace

confidence in illusions
bravery of the garish
honour of the despised
spawned from the cradle of unmight

Let us be the salt in your wound !
