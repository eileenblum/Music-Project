On his throne sits the western emperor commands the North Atlantic Terrorist Order
The fleet of F-16's corrals the sheep in line the great king of terror reigns from the sky
Do as we say, bow to our customs and our ways if not, prepare for the gift of total warfare
Mars, rise, bask in the butchery before your eyes time for Saturnalia of gore

The world degenerates to continental death Asia, Africa, Europe and the rest
Savage slaughter on a scale unforetold whirlwinds of horror suck us down the hole
Bend your knees, submit to me, I have your number now the number's 666,
You human pricks, consider you as syphilis your war obscene amuses me, a thermonuclear STD
The die is cast, screwed in the ass, the Earth's a part of its own past
So dark, so charred, so permanently scarred don't be sad, war's the best sex you've ever had
