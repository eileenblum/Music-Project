Burn up the ground, torch what's all around incinerate the towns, destroy the land
All must die, smoke scorching the sky, planet's genocide, nothing must stand
Crops are razed by the fire's rage, cannot be contained, inferno unleashed
Flames of Hell start to grow and swell hear the screams and yells of those about to pay the price for defying me
They will see, I am ruler supreme I shall give the decree of fire this is the policy

Population dies, grass and mountains fry what is the reason why?
Insanity evil man, country in his hands, fire is his demand
Scorch all that lives smoking flesh, smell the scent of death
Feel the heat's caress, gripping you tight no way out, poisoned blackened clouds, gather and surround
This is how you will pay the price for defying me
They will see, I am ruler supreme I shall give the decree of fire this is the policy

All life is burned to black when fire is released, no turning back
Madman, see what you have done your policy has turned the Earth to sun
Pay the price for defying me they will see,
I am ruler supreme I shall give the decree of fire this is the policy
