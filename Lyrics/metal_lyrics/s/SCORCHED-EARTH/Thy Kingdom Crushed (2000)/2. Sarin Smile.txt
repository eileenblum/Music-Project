Woke up just the other day, planning a colossal play
Mission meaning suicide, causing local biocide
You won't hear my point of view, so I've come up with something new
No more bombs or empty threats, this will be the greatest yet
Born within my basement lab, with the spare time that I've had
Mixing death and stirring doom, intending you for early tombs
Wait for this to be released, notice how it's hard to breathe?
That's 'cause sarin's in the air chemical extraordinaire

Pain shall hit and you won't know, 'till you feel your burning throat
Grasping for the straws of life, as your body' force resigns
Droplets kill in seconds flat, emanating lethal gas
Hear me laughing all the while, Grinning reaper, sarin smile

Hit the school or park or church, anywhere that people work
Break the bag and let it loose, let 'em feel the airborne noose
Scratchy skin and watered eyes dominate as fevers rise
Pulse collapse at rapid pace, color leaves from ashen face
Muscle tense and paralyze, internal organs slow and die
Suffocate, asphyxiate, either word describes your fate
People dropping all around, dead before they hit the ground
Killed off fast, efficiently, better than I thought it'd be

Vapor horror at its best, stopped your heart within your chest
Bloodless death for all involved, population problem solved!
Gaze upon my work and fear, chemo-terror of the year
Misfit mind that lit the fuse, cake for anyone to do
Corpses lay haphazardly, dead and gone, c'est la vie
Face up, face down in the dirt, souls off to the spirit world
Deadly way of getting fame, no one will forget my name
While you watch the tragedy, I'll go down in history
