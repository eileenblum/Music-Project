Sword in hand, this blade awaits you poisoned to slash thy painted face
Justice served by disembowelling dead within your blackened lace
Massacres are second nature death befalls the false undead
Wandering the world in search of infidels I shall behead

Damn you to your crypt to stay entombed within the walls of pain
Never-ending urge to slay drives me each and every day
Come and face the man in black play the game of slash-and-hack
Nosferatu's kin partake vampire hunter's metal stake
Exterminate you so-called horrors while you try to scare in vain
Don't know what you are getting into treading into my domain

Come to me, young Schreck remove your head from your neck
Underneath the sanguine moon impalings in full bloom
Dracula, Count Orlok names you will never top
Thy would be proud, of my work ridding you from this Earth
Scream,scream,nocturnal amputees pray, prey, for Hell's embrace
