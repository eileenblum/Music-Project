Emergence of the war machine of the unholy death regime
Tyrants meet and make their plan conquer all the land they can
From the mountains to the sea no one will again be free
Imposing law on other ones master plan has just begun
Armies of Earth crush us like worms
What is to become of us impending holocaust

Missiles falling all the time in a campaign for all to die
Rockets from the air destroy whatever peace we enjoyed
Tanks annihilate our towns soldiers come and shoot us down
Our culture is eradicated aggressor ways initiated
Armies of Earth crush us like worms
What is to become of us impending holocaust

Slave to the invading horde I say a prayer to my "lord"
If you exist and hear my plea come down and deliver me
I will now be executed to the chamber I will go
How many of us are to die nobody will ever know
Armies of Earth crush us like worms
What is to become of us impending holocaust

Powers above watch below as the atrocities take place
Death concocted from the minds who were once of human race
Hate prevails all over the Earth, now all must lay to rest
Atomic warheads rain from the sky, no civilization left
Foolish mortals burned into ash from radioactive burns
Fallen leaders who started it all got just what they deserved
As for the rest who failed to notice the coming of the holocaust
Their apathy has cost them all, their lives and futures lost
