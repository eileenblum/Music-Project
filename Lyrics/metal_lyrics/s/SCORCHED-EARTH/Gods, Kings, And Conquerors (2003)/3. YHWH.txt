Start of life, open eyes, forced baptize, to the ways of "God"
Reared from birth, to fear the worst, praise the church, hail their every word
Feeling thoughts of breaking free and follow my own choice
Longtime thrall of holy lies shall heed my inner voice
From the sands, enslaving man, in every land, global reach achieved
Crushing heel, oppression real, masses kneel, spiritual slavery

Tensions grow, its time to go, sever all my ties see you now for what you are, the true antichrist
Reject your myths, your testaments, your Jesus, and your Beast
I don't accept your heresies that come from the Middle East
Come to terms, seek to learn the wisdoms of my blood
Knowledge I will put to use when the hour comes heretic, Satanist, call me what you must
When God Beyond kills YHWH, "God", you'll be left in the dust
