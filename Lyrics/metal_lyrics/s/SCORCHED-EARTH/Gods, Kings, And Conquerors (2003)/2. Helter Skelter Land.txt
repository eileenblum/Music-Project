No one to lament the dark continent tribal rivalries aflame
21st century, medieval butchery the way of massacre is the blade
Commence the genocide, cut them open wide blood will flow all day and night
Get the necklace tight, victim set alight human arson purifies

Serial killer corps, extermination wars machete-induced gore, terra firma sore
Helter Skelter Land, holocaust by hand nation-state's last stand, Helter Skelter Land
Imposed boundaries, colonial legacies, ancestral claimants disagree
So the terror goes, butchery never slows, governments and rebels both
For those in between, peace is just a dream, homicide reality
Not a moments calm, violence never gone, always lays in wait to strike!!
Towns left in blood, carcasses in mud, amputations run amok
Leaving some alive, mutilated right, so in the future they won't fight
Mansonoid intent, lives cheaply spent, long failed experiment
Widespread child rape, persistent spread of AIDS, any chance of being saved?
From Algeria to South Africa, thing are fucked beyond repair
Religious ethnic strife, maintained by the knife, death eternal, immortal
Behind barbed wire fence, killing more intense, world outside turns a blind eye
More barbarity, more depravity, continuing perversity!
