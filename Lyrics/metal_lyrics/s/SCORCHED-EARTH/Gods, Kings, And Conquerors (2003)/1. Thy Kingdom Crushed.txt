Mercy none, we will show to you YHWH, "God", we will end your rule
Prepare for war, we are coming for you settle our scores with the "King of the Jews"
Heaven destroyed in nuclear fire thy kingdom crushed tis our desire
Churches, synagogues, and mosques decimate at every cost
Ash to ash, dust to dust there you lay, thy kingdom crushed!
