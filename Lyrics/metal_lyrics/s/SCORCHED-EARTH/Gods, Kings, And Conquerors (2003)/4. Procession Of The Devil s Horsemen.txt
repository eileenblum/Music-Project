Through the steppes* they ride all aburst with pride
Temujin has died, his lust not satisfied
For all in the way of the funeral parade
Forfeits their life to the flash of the blade
Off to the skies to serve the great Khan
While down on Earth the procession goes on

[* steppe â a large area of land with grass but few trees, especially in SE Europe and Siberia e.g. "The vast Russian steppes".]
