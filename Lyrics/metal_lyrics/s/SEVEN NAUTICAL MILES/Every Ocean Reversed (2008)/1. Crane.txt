Open me, and empty me from all the hatred within
Control the lines
Distorted facts becomes a surrounding circle
Feel the marks scratched in bone

To some in pleasure
Others in pain I know, wisdom
Leaving, suffering
Termination close
I don t know how or why
Drowned and benighted

We are marionettes to this wall
Hear their call
Watch them all
