Seconds, it all ended
A rope tied the heart
Fallen in a lost moment
Bound in the burning card
Missing pieces come together
Patterns will fill the dreary minds
Instant sadness kills the day
Freezing madness stills the way

Leaving conscious, euphoria
Drowning faster, cold disarray
Feeble minded, thieving light
In disguise I flee the night
Still you rest in my mind
I m waiting for you to arrive
