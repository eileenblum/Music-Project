You were ought to stay, forever, away
Not to interfere within my landscapes
Did I not let you be?
Did I not leave you for me?

I can see a thousand rivers better than this one
I need a storm to blow me away
Who can see the brighter morning?
I have to wash this face away
I have to end this pain today
