[2012 "The Avengers" Movie Soundtrack]What if all you understand,
Could fit into the center of a hand
Then you found it was not you
Who held the sum of everything you knew,

We are insane but not alone
You hold on and they are gone,
Like the sun we will live to rise,
Like the sun we will live and die,
And then ignite again,
Like the sun we will live to rise again

What if the one thing that I missed,
Was everything I need to pass the test,
And if I fail what happens then?
Can I still count on you as a friend?

Again Again Again Again
Warm my face Warm your face
Warm my face Warm your face
Warm my face Warm your face
Warm my face Warm your face
Warm my face Warm your face
