[1992 "Singles" Movie Soundtrack]Lying like needles on forest earth 
Euphoric rush trees bend to pray for us
I am sputtering like cold machines 
Late for the birth ritual

You can drive my tail to watch the circus 
A birth ritual a birth of idiots 
Now I woke up blessed and good strives for heartache 
Marked for the death ritual

As you start the song and face this garden 
I light a cigarette before the execution 
And now you see your crime for every miracle 
Add another drug at every birth ritual
Shining like Child's eyes
Mark his size bright until the newness wears off 

I took the drug to make me stay 
And now everything dies in shyness 
The snake retreats admits defeat 
And waits for the birth ritual
