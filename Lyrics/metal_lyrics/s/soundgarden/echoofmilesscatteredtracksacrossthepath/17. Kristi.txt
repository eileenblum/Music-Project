Kristi, tell me what I wanna hear
Oh Kristi, tell me what I wanna hear

You never read without me
You won't sleep without me
You never try without me
You're only weak without me

Tell me what I wanna hear
Yeah Kristi, show me what I wanna see
Yeah Kristi, show me what I wanna see

You can't breathe without me
You're only cream without me
You can't walk without me
You're only [?] without me
You'll never wrong without me
You'll never feel without me

Hey Kristi, tell me what I wanna hear
Yeah Kristi, tell me what I wanna hear

You'll only break without me
You'll never make it without me
You won't be free without me
You'll only kneel without me
You won't smile without me
You'll never try without me
You'll only cry without me
You're gonna die without me

You're gonna die without me
You're gonna die without me
You're gonna die without me
You're gonna die without me
