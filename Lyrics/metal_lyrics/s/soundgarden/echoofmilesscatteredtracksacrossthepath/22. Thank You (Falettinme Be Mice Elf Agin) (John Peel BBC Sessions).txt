Lookin' at the devil grinnin' at his gun
Fingers start shakin' I begin to run
Bullets start chasin' I begin to stop
We begin to wrestle I was on the top
I want to thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin

Stiff all in the collar fluffy in the face
Chit chat chatter tryin' stuffy in the place
Thank you for the party but I could never stay
Many thangs is on my mind words in the way
I want to thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin

Dance to the music all nite long
Everyday people sing a simple song
Mama's so happy Mama start to cry
Papa still singin' you can make it if you try
I want to thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin

Flamin' eyes of people fear burnin' into you
Many men are missin' much hatin' what they do
Youth and truth are makin' love gig it for a starter
Now dyin' young is hard to take sellin' out is harder
I want to thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
Thank you falettinme be mice elf agin
