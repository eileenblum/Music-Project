[Verse:]
The storm has weakened minds of steel
The rain to capture hopeless ones
This fear has passed them incomplete
Those words unspoken with no restraint
With no restraint
Restraint

[Chorus:]
Watch as they run faceless, faceless
We wait as any faceless, faceless
My heart comes seeking faces
But all around me is faceless

[Verse]

[Chorus]

All hope for those corrupt
All hope for those corrupt
All strength for those corrupt
All strength for those corrupt
All hope for those corrupt
All strength for those corrupt
All hope for those corrupt
All strength for those corrupt
All hope for those corrupt
All strength for those corrupt
All hope for those corrupt
All strength for those corrupt
All strength for those corrupt
All strength for those
