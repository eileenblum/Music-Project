In the night
In the city
Alone in my room
Oh, wall to wall

Touch me, can you feel it
Touch me, it feels good
Touch me, yeah I can feel it
(I got the feeling)
Touch me

Couldn't get to sleep in my room last night
Something isn't quite the same
Just as I was reaching for the nearest light
I heard somebody calling my name

Touch me, can you feel it
Touch me, it feels good
Touch me, yeah I can feel it
(I got the feeling)
Touch me

Oh yeah
All right now

Shivers down my backbone because my man is back
And my pulse began to race
Oh, when she laid beside me everything went black
Because I've seen the strangest things

Touch me, can you feel it
Touch me, it feels good
Touch me, yeah I can feel it
(I got the feeling)
Touch me
