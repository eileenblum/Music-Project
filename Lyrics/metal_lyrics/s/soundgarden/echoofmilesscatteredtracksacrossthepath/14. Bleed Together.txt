I know you're half awake
And no hate and I know how to do it
Hold the door and let it out
Don't get it right or wrong
No I don't get it

I know you're half afraid
Half amazed, all insane
I know it's all a cage
And all the rage
And all together gone

You and me we're average
With simple minds and lungs, eyes and skin
You and me we're hopeless
We're nowhere hearts so tear it out
And open it

I'm giving blood tonight
I don't care how, don't care why
I'm giving blood tonight
I'm feeling just like I could give it all

[Chorus:]
I know you're sick and alone
Mothers and suckers alike
We can bleed together

Show me and hand me down
And hang me up alone and cold and bury me
Show me and throw me out
And hold me down, air me out
And wear me

[Repeat verse 2]

[Chorus]

Too altogether cool/cold
Too altogether numb

I know you're sick and alone
I know you're sick and alone

[Chorus]

Come away and come with me
And come around and come and see
And cover up and come along
Before race before the calm
And he walks out and fires the gun
Happy with the things he won
The head of God on the wall
Ahead of us the heads of us
