[originally by Rolling Stones]I hear the click-clack of your feet on the stairs
I know you're no scare-eyed honey
There'll be a feast if you just come upstairs
This ain't no hanging matter
No, this ain't no capital crime

Ya I can see that you're just fifteen years old
But I don't want your I.D.
Ya I can see that you're so far from home
This ain't no hanging matter,
No it ain't no capital crime

[Chorus:]
Oh yeah, you're a stray stray cat
Oh yeah, you're a stray stray cat
Oh yeah, you're a stray stray cat

I bet your momma never saw you fight like that
I bet your momma never saw you scratch my back

You like to get yourself those _____ from home
But I know you miss your mother
You look so scared out of my man made bed
This ain't no hanging matter
No, this ain't no capital crime

[Chorus]

I bet your momma never heard you spit like that
I bet your momma never saw you scratch my back

I see your girlfriend and she's wilder than you
Why don't you bring her upstairs
She's wild enough that she can join in too
This ain't no hanging matter
No, this ain't no capital crime

[Chorus]

I bet your momma never saw you fight like that
I bet your momma never saw you scratch my back
I bet your momma never saw you
I bet your momma never heard you spit like that

I bet your momma never told you
I bet your momma never told you
I bet your momma never told you you scratch like that
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
