(You) Gonna shake your head
Gonna shake and spin
Gonna pick it up abed with something new

First I heard it in my car
Then I saw it on the set
It's nothin' I can't do
It's nothin' I can't lick

Oh, yeah

[Chorus 1:]
(Now) You can hear it in the air
You can feel it in your bones
You can sing it in your head
You can wear it on your clothes

Oh, yeah

[Chorus 2:]
You can steal it if you dare
Just might put you where you're goin'
(where you're goin')

I'm just a regular man
Now I'm a regular mess
Doesn't matter how you dress
Doesn't matter how you fit

Oh, yeah

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

I'm gonna show you someday

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

You can hear it in the air
You can feel it in your bones
You can have it for your own
May not miss you when your gone
