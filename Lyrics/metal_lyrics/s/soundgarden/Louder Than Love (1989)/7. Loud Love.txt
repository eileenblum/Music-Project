There's no time to keep it low
I've been deaf now I want some noise
You stay down
but I won't be quiet
I'll hammer on until you fight

Loud Love
Loud Love
Loud Love
Loud Love

If you've got som time to kill
Slow resisitance wins the war
Well I know
But that's no way to go
You can't resist the louder pull

Loud Love

Well that's right
I want something to explode
I've been deaf
Now I want noise

Loud Love
Loud Love
Loud Love
Loud Love
