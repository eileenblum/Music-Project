Get on the snakes
With a swarm of motor flys
Get on the snakes
Under the Cola xolored sky

Don't worry, everything's clean
Road worthy, hungry and mean

Get on the snakes
Where the metal river bleeds
Get on the snake
Where you never will believe
Hey baby, what's your disease
My heart's bleeding
I'm dying to leave

Get on the snake
Where the water turns to steam
Get on the snake
With a suicide machine

Don't worry, everything's clean
Road worthy, hungry and mean
Hungry and mean...
Hungry and mean...
