These tears to remember
These tears to forget
When I try to cry one
These tears do forget you

I suckle life
Its love and its beauty
Well I scream from life
Its honor and its beauty

These tears to remember
These tears to forget
When I try to cry one
These tears they do forget you

I suckle life
Its love and its beauty
Well I scream from life
Its honor and its beauty

Remember, forget
