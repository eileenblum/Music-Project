So you think I got something on you
I bet I know what you're gonna do
(mystery line)

Fill your head
With crazy sounds
It ain't as pretty coming out

So glad to see you're at it again
So glad I ain't your only friend
When are you going to understand
That it's okay
Maybe now
It ain't as pretty coming out

Fill your head
With crazy sounds
It ain't as pretty coming out
