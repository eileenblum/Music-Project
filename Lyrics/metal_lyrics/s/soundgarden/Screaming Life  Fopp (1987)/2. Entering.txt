I'm entering
Without a sound
I'm entering
On wings I've found
A million miles
Of covered ground
I'm entering, entering yeah
Well I'm entering

I'm entering
Without a sound
I'm entering
On wings I've found
A million miles
Of covered ground
I'm entering, I'm entering yeah
Well I'm entering, yeah, yeah

I'm entering
Bleeding hearts, two lights, goodness, stable
Glass on bars won't hold me back
Without a sound
Or a thought
I'm entering
I'm entering

Oh yeah without a sound
I'm entering, entering
On wings I've found
A million, million miles, a million miles
Well I'm entering, entering, entering, entering, entering, entering yeah
