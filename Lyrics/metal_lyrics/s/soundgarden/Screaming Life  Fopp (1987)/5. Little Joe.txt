Little Joe, run for the border
Leave your home, leave your mother and father
Go to where the reptiles roam
On the side of the border that is your home

Little Joe, eyes of your lover look back on you
As you run for cover
Those sticks and fire, sticks and fire, won't break your bones
It is a lie

Little Joe, just like your father
Your eyes will water, your guts will splatter
Those sticks and fire, sticks and fire, won't break your bones
It is a lie

Litle Joe, run for the border
Leave your whole home, leave your mother and father
Go to where the reptiles roam
They're waiting for you little Joe

Little Joe run for the border
Leave your home, leave your mother and father
Go to where the reptiles roam
On the side of the border that is your home

Little Joe, just like your father
Your eyes will water, your guts will splattter
Those sticks and fire, sticks and fire, won't break your bones
It is a lie
