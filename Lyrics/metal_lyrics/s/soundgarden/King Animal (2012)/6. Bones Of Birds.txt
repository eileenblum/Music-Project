Time is my friend 'til it ain't and runs out
And that is all that I have 'til it's gone
Try to build a home, bones of birds
Singing in the cold and fall to earth

Hey, sometimes she won't cry
When the smallest one is drowned
Too weak to survive probably... maybe

Try to look out through a hole in a bag
Circle above looking down, bird of prey
Try to build a home, bones of birds
Singing in the cold and fall to earth

Hey, sometimes she won't cry
When the smallest one is drowned
Too weak to survive
Too weak to survive
Too weak to survive probably... maybe

Try to build a home, bones of birds
Singing in the cold and fall to earth

Hey, sometimes she won't cry
When the smallest one is drowned
Too weak to survive probably

Hey, sometimes she won't cry
When the smallest one is drowned
Too weak to survive
Too weak to survive
Too weak to survive
