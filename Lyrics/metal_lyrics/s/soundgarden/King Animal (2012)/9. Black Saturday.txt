Promise something, kill me right away if I start to get slow
And don't remember how to separate the worm from the apple
Don't wait 'til tomorrow, kill me right away if I start to listen
To the voices telling all the mouths what they need to swallow

Do that for me, it's the least that you can do
Don't be afraid, I would do the same for you
Burn out any memory of me ever breathing
'Til I'm born again

I was thirsty, I remember that you gave me some water
I was angry at everything at once you gave me no trouble
I was crying, I remember that you gave me your shoulder

Do that for me, it's the least that you can do
Don't be afraid, I would do the same for you
Burn out any memory of me ever breathing
'Til I'm born again, born again

Do that for me, it's the least that you can do
Don't be afraid, I would do the same for you
Burn out any memory of me ever breathing
'Til I'm born again, born again, born again, born again
