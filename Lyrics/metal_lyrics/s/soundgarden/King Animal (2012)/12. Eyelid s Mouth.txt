In the eyelid's mouth 
On the iris tongue
When a scream crawls out 
Only the tear has won
Only the tear has won

Who let the water run down? (cry internal)
Who let the river run dry? (live internal)
Who let the water run out? (burn internal)
Who let the river run wild? (die internal)
Who let the water run down? (cry internal)
Who let the river run dry?

Through the eyelet comes 
Unimagined light
Unremembered sun 
Only the rivers run
But never hide

Who let the water run down? (cry internal)
Who let the river run dry? (live internal)
Who let the water run out? (burn internal)
Who let the river run wild? (die internal)
Who let the water run down? (cry internal)
Who let the river run dry? (live internal)
Who let the water run down? (cry internal)
Who let the river run dry?

(Cry internal)
(Die internal)
(Cry internal)
