Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row
Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row

Moving is breathing and breathing is life
Stopping is dying, you'll be alright
Life is a hammer waiting to drop
Adrift in the shallows and the rowing won't stop

Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row
Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row

Can't see the sky, nothing on the horizon
Can't feel my hands and the water keeps rising
Can't fall asleep cause I'll wake up dead
I just keep pulling, I just keep rolling

Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row
Don't know where I'm going (I don't know where I'm going)
I just keep on rowing, I just keep on pulling, gotta row

Rowing is living and living is hard
But living beats losing all that we are
And all that we know of and all that we feel
And all we remember imagined or real
All we remember imagined or real

I heard an echo but the answer had changed
From the word I remember that I started out saying
Living is cheating if you're not pulling oars
But the current is leaving, I'll get mine, you'll get yours

Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row
Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row

Rowing is bleeding and bleeding is breathing
Breathing is feeling burning and freezing
Keep getting dirty but I started out clean
I keep on rowing, I keep on rowing
I keep on pulling, I keep on pulling
I keep on rowing, I keep on rowing
I keep on rowing, I keep on rowing
I keep on rolling
Keep on rolling

Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row
Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row
