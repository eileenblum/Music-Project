Caught in every pocket, from miles to fill
So weak in the land, strong in the will
I'll be your beast of burden
I'm there to see
I'll bring you a healer, feel your disease
I drink dirty water and make it clean
With you I am the cure, I am the drug

And we settle for a little bit more than everything
We're not elected, but we will speak
We're not the chosen, but we believe
And we settle for a little bit more than everything

Bullets, guided missiles, stone cold in sync
Yeah motherless country only I've seen
You are the taken rockets, I am the bomb
I'll teach you a lesson, so far up in
Breathe in, turn the pages, just a real man
You are to fuel the rises, I am the poor

And we settle for a little bit more than everything
We're not elected but we will speak
We're not the chosen, but we believe
And we settle for a little bit more than everything

I'm a non-state actor
I'm a non-state actor
I'm a non-state actor
I'm a non-state
I'm a non-state actor

And we settle for a little bit more than everything
We're not elected but we will sá¹eak
We're not the chosen, but we believe
And we settle for a little bit more than everything
A little bit more
A little bit more
A little bit more
A little bit more
