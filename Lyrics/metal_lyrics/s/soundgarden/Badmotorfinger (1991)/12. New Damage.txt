[Music - Thayil, Cameron; Lyrics - Cornell]

When new damage comes
It's a faceless poison
A new world order
It's new damage done
The wreck is going down
Get out before you drown
The wreck is going down
Get out before you drown
When new damage comes
It's a new word for plague
A new world order
A new word for hate
The wreck is going down
Get out before you drown
The wreck is going down

Chris Cornell: vocals, guitar
