[2004 Re-issue Track]The killers and the destroyers
These kings of doom rule the world
Yet weâre not aware
You canât see them and no you canât here them
Their evil deeds reflect the prince of the power of air

In this world of confusion
Who knows wrong from right
There may be no tomorrow
Canât give up the fight

The killers and the destroyers
Theyâll go through anything
Just to rip off your soul
They have no mercy
Just words of deception
These keen offenders are reaching from down below

Some men cruse down the fast lane
Some get off the trail
Killers time itâs all borrowed
Heâll pay his dept to hell

Destroyer

The killers and the destroyers
From Babylon they heard the cries that were ushering forth 
They boiled babies
They killed by the thousands
And in the end theyâll have no remorse

Killer, destroyer!
Killer, destroyer!
Killer, destroyer!
