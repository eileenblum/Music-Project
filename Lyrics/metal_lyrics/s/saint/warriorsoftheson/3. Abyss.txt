The battle happened in heaven
The battle happened a long time ago.
Satan in a rage I think it's something, we all should know
The devil took by side one third of I heaven to fall with him
And now the demons they cry and the false prophets burn with them

Well you know it's not safe to go out at night
His wrath comes so quick but my God never lies
Welcome to abyss I hope you have fun

Look for the masquerader Look for the one who lied
He's dressed like Dr. Jackal But he's really Mr.Hyde
He wants to deceive you he wants to drag you down besides
There is another choice and by his strength the dragon dies.

And you know it's not safe to go out at night
Life in fear, that's your right

So do you get the drift? About spiritual suicide
That comes with following the devil He wants to see genocide
He wants to rip off your flesh he wants to poke out your eye
He's trying to get you in trouble and yes he wants us all to die

But you know it's not safe to go out at night
His wrath comes so quick but my God never lies
Don't want to see you in abyss You're not going to have fun
Forever is a long time when there ain't nowhere to run
Don't want to see you in abyss
