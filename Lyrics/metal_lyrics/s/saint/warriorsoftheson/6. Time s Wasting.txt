Every time I see your face the memory closes in
We had good times; we had some fun we were such good friends
Now that my life is changing you seem to lock the door
You run, you hide, make your escape
But you don't know what for

Go ahead, suit yourself
Forget the truth
Do it all on you own
Your time is just wasting

You make it to the party and wake up on the floor
Your head is ringing twice as bad from the keg two nights before
Can't you see the damage? You're ruining your soul
You've got to find some strength remains besides a bag and a smoking bowl

Christ remains in waiting Christ has paid the toll
He died for you, He broke the chains opened the prison doors
Why do you choose to run from Him? There's nowhere else to go
A sinless Priest, the awesome King I think you probably know
