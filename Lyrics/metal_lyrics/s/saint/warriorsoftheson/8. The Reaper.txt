[2004 Re-issue Track]Are you worried about the evil wars
Are you worried about the times
Have you seen Israel and Egypt go
Theyâve drawn it to the line
The world weâre living in today
Itâs getting down and out
I canât walk the streets at night
I want to scream and shout

Here Comes the Reaper

The Reaper flies across the sky
Heâs coming to the earth
The prophetâs lying in the street
Heâs giving them new birth
Heâs blasting down the face of man
The wicked they are doomed
The rocks are falling on their heads
Canât you see the bloody gloom

Here Comes the Reaper

The reaper opens another seal
Oh yes, thereâs more to come
The bee that fly with human face
Theyâve got you on the run
I hope you havenât got that mark
Theyâll soon be chasing you
Theyâre stinging everything in sight
Do you know what youâre going to do

Here Comes the Reaper

Oh fear the Reaper now my friend
You still have time to turn
Donât listen to what the devil says
He wants us all to burn
He tells you lies and fills your mind
With evil wicked things
But let The Reaper come on in
Youâll find new life is what he brings

Here Comes the Reaper
You better fear His face
Here Comes the Reaper
