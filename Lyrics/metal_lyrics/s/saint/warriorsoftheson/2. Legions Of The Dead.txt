Thunder striking a curse on the earth
Down from the Heavens to those who deserve
The scoffing vandals shall all fade away
And stalk each other from nighttime till day

A sea of people drown in their sleep
Legions of the dead and the widows who weep
The lakes have turned to blood
And the mountains, they roar
The victims think in their minds
I've heard this some place before

War and famine is all part of this wicked game
Disease and hunger is jotting down your name
Death defiers screaming God to blame
Stones and fire will burn them up in flames

But it all soon will end
The wars already won
And the legions of the dead their time has come
Legions of the dead

They dared to bow down and worship the beast
He tells them when it's done We're gonna have a big feast
But what they don't know So much to their surprise
They're the ones for dinner
With the beast and all his lies
