Behold in time the Son will rise, The sky will bleed the wrath of night
The Sons of light arise with thee they hear his call down to their knees
A battle rage they choose to go with hearts prepared for the next expo
Made up their minds, left all behind Give all they got wisdom fortified

They are the warriors of the Son of the King of the light
Arise with thee unto thy might
Warriors of the Son of the King of the light
They died with thee, they live to fight

Come wind, come storm, cold and freeze
The sons of light shall not retreat
Come fireballs and desert sands Come warriors with battle plans
By His strength the King of light starts pouring Out His rage
To slay the beast who has conquered the world at this stage
The sons of light they hear His call they know just what to do
Ten thousands and the mighty one They're coming to get you

The prince beneath, he won't delay his troopers foolish, void and lame
Commands the blood soaked battlefield He wages war and makes his kill
His time so short, he's soon to go back to his home abyss below
Though they have reigned for many years
The Sons of God they all shall fear
