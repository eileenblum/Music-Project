[Music by Dee Harrington and Richard Lynch]
[Words by Richard Lynch and John Lynch]

Out on the street
No where to go
Losing my mind
Losing my soul
A beggers life
To live in fear
Lookin' for something

Could take my life
But what a shame
A finger points to blame
I'm looking hard
But can't quite see
I hear a voice
Shouting at me

Now it's time for you to stop running
The time is now salvation's calling

Lookin' for land
Adrift at sea
Will someone have
Mercy on me
Drown in sorrow
Where's my first love
Where is my comfort

A taste of death
Would not be sweet
The devil's fire
Burning beneath
Cries from the heart
To take a chance
Will I go down
Walking the fence

Was all alone
Out on the street
Feeling tired
Down and beat
Then he came
He talked to me
He cleansed my heart

He said move forward
Walk in faith
It's time to watch
The moves you make
Follow the truth
I placed in you
You know what's right
Know I'm with you

Now it's time for you to stop running
The time is now salvation's calling
Jesus is the way for you, that's right
