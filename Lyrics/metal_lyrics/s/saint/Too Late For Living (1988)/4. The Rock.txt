[Music by Dee Harrington and Richard Lynch]
[Words by Richard Lynch]

Life is hard and then you die
Struggle far you don't know why
Empty eyes gazing at you
Turn your back they'll run you through

We are called to stand tall
Eyes upon the Rock

Many come and many stray
Lose their faith they walk away
Turn their back on what they know
What is left where can they go

We are called to stand tall
Eyes upon the One who's love redeems us all
Eyes upon the Rock

Now's the time come one and all
In the light you can not fall
Saving grace is here for you
Ask who've sinned he wants you too
