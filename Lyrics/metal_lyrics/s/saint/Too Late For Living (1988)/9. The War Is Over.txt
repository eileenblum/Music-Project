[Words &amp; Music by Josh Kramer]

The darkness is coming to a close
And in it's grip held fears untold
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
The shackles broke around my heart
I'm thrown about no more on the sea
Yet rip tide still longs to pull me out from the shore

You set me free now I can see
From where I've been enslaved within

You rescued me from the serpent's coil
And all the traps that ensnared my mind
The war is over you won it a long time ago
The truth is sometimes bitter sweet
It's hard to take where it hurts the most
But Lord you're great, the power hits deep down inside

The prince of shadows has lost his hold
His tactics fail, as they unfold
Yet fighting continues in vain until the end
So let battle commence I'm armed for war
You've trained me for the fields of doom
Where many before me fought and many died

The war is over
