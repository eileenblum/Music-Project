[Music by Dee Harrington]
[Words by John Lynch &amp; Richard Lynch]

I could hear the voices shouting
In the blackened night
Feel terror and distration
On the edge just out of sight
It was there just like a vision
Evil in it's zeal
But the scent of death around me
Let me known it's all for real

Soon the world will see God's face
Raging through the sky
His firey eyes will find you
So make a choice to live or die

Seven plagues were now upon us
Seven seals were open wide
Seven bowls of wrath were poured out
There was no place you could hide
There was no one left to tell us
The believers disappeared
All the people in confusion
Never knew this kind of fear

Let me tell you this my friend
The truth is to be known
Vengence, death or victory
The choice is yours, yours all your own
Like the devil seeks his thrill
To quench his thirst to be fulfilled
The prince of death will pay, listen to me
