[Music by Josh Kramer]
[Words by Richard Lynch]

I woke up bright this morning
Another sunny day
Life was treating me real cool
Things were going, going my way
Then I jumped into my chevy
Built to the top, four on the floor
Boaring through the streets at day break
I wish I'd known what was in store

How could I know this would be my
Last day on earth
All the things that I've acquired
Now it seems they have no worth

Too late for living
Suddenly life is gone
I drove the center line
Acting like I knew it all
And I wound up in a faster lane
Heading for my fall
Well I see the light but it's too late
For me, I'm gone

Too late for living
