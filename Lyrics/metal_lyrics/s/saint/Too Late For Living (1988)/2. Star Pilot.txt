[Music by Dee Harrington]
[Words by Richard Lynch &amp; John Lynch]

Red alert star craft approaching
Everybody put on your gear
By your command engines on stand by
We are the ones that they fear

Permission granted launching pad is clear

Prepare for take-off stay in the pattern
There in your sights is your mind there
It's your mission protect and defend
Send the enemy back to hell

No time to reflect your time is here

Don't you stop fighting, armor up star pilot
Don't you turn your back on me
Calling battle stations, look out for infiltration
We will have this victory

Picking up enemy fighter
Closing in for the kill
I'm losing communication
Navigation is this your will?

My faith gets weak when the pressure turns on

Plot a course into battle
Ignition thrusters igniting done
Blasting with proton power
It seems we've won but they're not gone

Why am I fighting a battle that's been won?

Red alert star craft approaching
Everybody put on your gear
Once again into battle
Out to space no reason to fear

Our Lord protect us we know that He is here
