[Words by: Lynch, Music by: Lynch]

At the first the energy
The molding of the ages
There foundations set in stone
A mist the turning pages

Ancient days have long since know
The prophecies a waiting
Sacrifices long ago
Set up the times are hasting

[Chorus:]
And we watch the endless night
Slowly turn to glory
And a world so full of life
Folding true to story

As we crest forsaken tides
When the world starts burning
And the loved ones left behind
The time is now for turning

Our last flight the trumpet's call
A flash we're gone a new day
You can fight or come along
Let's taste of life a new way

[Repeat chorus]
