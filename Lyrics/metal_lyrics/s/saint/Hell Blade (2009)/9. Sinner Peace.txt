[Words by: Lynch, Music by: Lynch]

Through the sleepless night and life's constraints
As death creeps slowly
You watch the pages fade away
As lighting streaks across the sky that's burning slowly
You know your life could end today

[Chorus:]
He's the sinner peace
The Knight that's shinning full of glory
He's your inner peace
He casts His light as He goes before me

There's a distant scare reminds me of a life before you
Reminiscent of the day
A troubled time I walked and darkness surround me
Through jaded paths I found my way, yeah

[Repeat chorus]

He's the sinner peace
He's your inner peace
