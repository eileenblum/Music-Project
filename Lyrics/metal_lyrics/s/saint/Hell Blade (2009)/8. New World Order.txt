[Words by: Lynch, Music by: Lynch]

United Nations scheming
They're in the headlines glare
And we're just speculating
Where we'll go from here

World markets crashing daily
Giving into our fears
And we don't know just
What Obama-nations breeding here

[Chorus:]
Oh, here comes the New World Order
The Devil's on his shoulder
Start running for the boarder
Oh, here comes the New World Order
Babylon is fallen
Start running for the boarder

World governments colliding
Foot in the end time snare
We've beat the drum of reason
No one seems to care

Terrorist militias mounting
The words forgotten tears
And now the end is at the door
It's at the door insisting

[Repeat chorus]
