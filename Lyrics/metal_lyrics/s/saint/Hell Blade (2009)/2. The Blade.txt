[Words by: Lynch, Music by: Lynch]

Molten lava cracks the earth
As smoke ascends from hell
The hammer and the anvil strike
To forge the molten steel

The curse is now upon the earth
And rage has set the stage
The pointed blades sent straight from hell
In hand the master sage

[Chorus:]
Arising sin
The Blade that's from the pit it stirs within
Let it begin
A strike and in a flash the cursing ends

He claws his way from deep within
With souls who've lost their way
Ascending from the dragon's nest
To confuse and to sway

To bring a reign of tyranny
And rip the fiery veal
He is the king of judgment now
He's reining straight from hell

[Repeat chorus]
