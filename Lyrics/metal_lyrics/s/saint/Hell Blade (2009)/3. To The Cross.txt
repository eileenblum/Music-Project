[Words by: Lynch, Music by: Johnson]

As you're pulled with in temptations casually blind you
Applauding those who fear and those who simply fade
And as you face their backs betrayal is among them
So take your best step back, give it your all
You know there's just one way

To the Cross [2x]

The darkened clouds approach and sundown is upon them
The earth is quaking now, the fighting's just begun
Rumors, terror, and war, the fig is ripe and ready
At tribulation's door, give it to God
You know He is the way

To the Cross [2x]

The end is now, the end is today
The horror and fear and death are coming our way
Face what you see, drop to your knees
Prepare to receive what you can't conceive
The Cross is the way, the Cross is today

To the Cross...
