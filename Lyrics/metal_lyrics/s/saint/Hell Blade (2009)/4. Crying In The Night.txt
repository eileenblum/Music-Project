[Words by: Lynch, Music by: Lynch]

I see the world a changing
All the nations seem persuaded
We're marching forward to the day

With wars and famine feasting
On our fears and decimating
There's got to be another way

[Bridge:]
To the thirsty men whose destined
Now to surly stumble
And to the ones who seek the Vail

[Chorus:]
No more crying in the night or humility
No more pain and sleepless nights, finally I'm free
No dark secretes haunting me, in eternity
You can see a distant light, bright for all to see

The empty suits are leading
With talk that's cheep and wallets bleeding
Revealing plans to save the day

The radars showing signs
The end of days, the end of times
And now you know no other way

[Repeat bridge &amp; chorus]
