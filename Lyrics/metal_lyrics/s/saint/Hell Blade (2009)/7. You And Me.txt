[Words by: Lynch, Music by: Johnson]

Can't ya feel the fire inside
Can't ya feel the glory
The excitement mesmerize
As we tell the story

There's a Kingdom far away
But not too far to here you
Come along and sing this song
Sing along and renew

[Chorus:]
You, you and me
Standing in the light before us
Never see, it lights throughout the day
The Kingdom lights the way

Like a trumpet in the night
And the thunders glory
All creations bow to might
To the Throne of glory

In this Kingdom that has come
Every day's a new day
Come along and sing this song
Sing along a new way

[Repeat chorus]
