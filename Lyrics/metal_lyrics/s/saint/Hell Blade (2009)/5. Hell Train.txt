[Words by: DiMeglio / Lynch, Music by: Johnson]

Louie screams with laughter
Has all the sin I'm after
This train is long and full of pain

The boxcars filled with sorrow
Believe the lies that he's told
The train is empty and in vain

[Chorus:]
Welcome to a life insane
Welcome to the hell bound train

It's dark and cold inside
The sun it never rises
When you ride the hell bound train

He tells of warmth and praises
The train is only mazes
All aboard the hell bound train

[Repeat chorus]

The sun it never rises
When you ride the hell bound train
All aboard the hell bound train
Welcome to the hell bound train
