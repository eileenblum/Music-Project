[Words By: John Mahan, Music By: John Mahan]

Trust is where your strength lie's when your down
Life is what you're preaching in the truth you found
Sentenced alone it's a fate worse than death
No man there to talk to till it's your last breath
Know that it's caused all your strife
Men want to snuff out your life
Things that your saying come from within
No man can take it away
Few will believe you the message you learned
Your going into exile today

Island prisoner
You're no visitor
Visions you've witness unveiled in a book
Why are they all coming true
Things that you're saying come from within
No man can take it away
Few will believe you the message you learned
Your going into exile today

Not in your wildest dreams
Could you ever imagined the revelation you have seen
A warning for mankind to see
Will they ever awaken to the devastation that will be
