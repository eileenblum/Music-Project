[Words By: Richard Lynch, Music By: Richard Lynch]

Trying to live my life for you
I don't know if I can
To make it on my own you know
I'm only just a man
My lack of dependence keeps me
From what I'll receive
Reach your hand down to me now
Help me to believe

Take this bitter cup
Death won't be my friend
You conquered the night
Through you I am winning

Knowing that your word is real
Knowing that you're true
Still I find myself in chains
Can't make it without you
Looking to your guiding light
Wanting to come in
Always there to help me out
You pick me up again

Good times come and good times go
I'll always need you
Showing me the wrongs and rights
Your love comes shinning through
Best of all you help me when
Temptations enter in
You conquered the darkest night
You made me new again
