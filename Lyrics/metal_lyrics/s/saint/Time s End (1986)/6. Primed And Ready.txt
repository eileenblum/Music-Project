[Words By: Richard Lynch, Music By: Richard Lynch]

The red of dawn is on the rise
You know it comes as no surprise
The earth quake came, the war are here
The end of time is getting near
Poison waters fill the land
Are you ready for the last stand
Armor up it's not too late
To join the few to delegate

[Chorus:]
"Primed and ready"
The end of time is near
"Someone's shouting"
He's coming back for those who care

Soon the earth will burn in flames
And wickedness will stake it's claim
What's to come out from the east
The son of death, the mighty beast
Sinful men will hear his cry
On judgment day they all will die
Evils got them by the tail
And with their gods they'll burn in hell

[Chorus]

When it all has come to pass
When the first have become last
When evils lost the final fight
To the King and all His might
Memories will fade away
The horrors of forgotten days
Except the one who's chosen wrath
He tasting death who's laughing last

[Chorus]
