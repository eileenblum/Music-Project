[Words By: Richard Lynch, Music By: Richard Lynch, John Mahan, Josh Kramer]

In the night time so eager to deceive
You cut the throat of man and caused us all disbelief
In the shadow of the distant far
You creep slowly but we know just who you are

Don't let him
Deprive you
Don't let him, no!

Looking viciously wearing his decor
Knowing secretly your wounds
SALT HE POURS
Deep inside you, you know which way to go
Your inside certain but your flesh keeps saying no

Don't let him
Deprive you
Don't let him, no!

At the bit he's chomping to destruct your soul
Causing man to fight self-destruction a alamode
Candy coated you hear this massage clear
Stand and fight death as for your soul, you're not to fear
Don't let him
Deprive you
Don't let him, no!
