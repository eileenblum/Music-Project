[Words By: Richard Lynch &amp; John Mahan, Music By: Richard Lynch &amp; John Mahan]

Out on a baron street
Just outside of town
The spaceman and his fleets
They're all touching' down
They're not from outer space
Nor the ocean or sea
Air defense stand by
What you spot report to me

Space Cruiser

Deep down inside the earth
Demons damned and cursed
Materializing steel
Forging satanic will

Oh no, here cares space cruiser
A flying curse up in the sky
Sent here from utter darkness
They've come to tell us all their lies
Why did the spacemen come here
From a far and distant land
And did they place the green goop in the ocean
That turned the fish into man

Space Cruiser you're exposed for all to see
Your plot is evil glad it's you,
Not me Determined tyrant spilling out your sin
You're claiming victory but you'll never win
