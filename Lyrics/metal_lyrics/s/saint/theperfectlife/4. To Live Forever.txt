[Words By: Dee Harrington and Richard Lynch, Music By: Dee Harrington and Richard Lynch]

Lately
The nights been dragging on
Hard times make you cold
Oh I've been searching for so long
Now I know I"m wrong
Living in lies and broken dreams
Watching your life on a TV screen
Say it's your will
Say it's your thrill
Say it's your will to live forever
No time
Is all the time I have
To waste my time with you
I might change
But change remains the same
No cash back when change is due
