[Words By: Dee Harrington and Richard Lynch, Music By: Dee Harrington]

When you need a touch
Of strength love is strong
And the highway of life
come along

With the power of his hand
He can crush your heart
But he gave his only son
To save you
How can you deny simple truth
Freely He gave to me and you

Love show his love
Show his love

With a shout
He is reaching out
Across the land
Unto us a promise of hope
A great command

Hear his only son calling you
Showing us the way to the trugh
Can you hear his small voice
Whispering soft to me and you
