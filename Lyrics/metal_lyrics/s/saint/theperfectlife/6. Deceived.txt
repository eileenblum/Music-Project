[Words By: Dee Harrington, Music By: Dee Harrington]

You've made a deal
A web to deceive
On certain dreams
Shadows the moonlight
Cast your lots
To a darkened room
A silence so cold
Shadows the screams

"Break this" It's part of my flesh
"Drink this" To remember my death
"Write this" On your cold, cold heart
"Read this" And forget me not

Love is here to mend your heart
You don't have to be apart no more
Take the time
Free your mind
Wake up and see
What you are to me
Cast your lots
To a darkened room
A silence so cold
Shadows the screams
It's part of my flesh
To remember my death
In your heart
And forget me not
God is now!
