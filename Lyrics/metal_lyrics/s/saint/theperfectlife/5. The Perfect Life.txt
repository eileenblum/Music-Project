[Words By: Dee Harrington and Richard Lynch, Music By: Dee Harrington and Richard Lynch]

Come to a place with me
I'll take you
It's a place of happiness
And dreams, for you
We will take the stairway
To the stars and
Never look back
On this broken life cause

He can show you the perfect life
The perfect life for you
He can show you the perfect life
The perfect life for you

Come to a place with me
I'll show you
It's a place where all your
Dreams come true, for you
We can fly the stars through
The sky and never never look back
On this broken life cause
