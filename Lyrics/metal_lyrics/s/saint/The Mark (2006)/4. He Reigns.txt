[Words By: Richard Lynch, Music By: Dee Harrington]

After this I saw four angels
Holding back winds of the earth in the sky
Another with the seal of God to place upon the chosen
The number that I heard was magnified

[Chorus:]
They say
Salvation belongs to our God and to the Lamb who was slain
Salvation belongs to our God, He paid the price and now He reigns

After this I saw a multitude
From every tongue and tribe, all dressed in robes
They stood before the throne
And on their faces, they praised Him
The mighty Lamb who sits upon the throne

[Chorus]

Who is this God who stretched the heaven
The universe His throne and the martyrs sang

[Chorus]
