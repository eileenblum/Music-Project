[Words By: Richard Lynch, Music By: Richard Lynch]

Let him who has understanding calculate the number
of the beast, for the number is that of a man;
and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.
[Rev 13:18 (NASU)]

And I saw another beast rise from the earth
To exercise authority on the dwellers of the earth
He performs the miracles in the presents of the beast
And those who do not worship him soon they'll be deceased

[Chorus:]
When the church is gone and the beast rides high
They'll shake their fists and curse at the sky
A hot wind races toward them, it's coming from the east
As they choose to die or take the mark of the beast

He causes all, the great, the small, the rich and the poor
To take the mark upon their hand or buy and sell no more
Those who take the beastly brand they'll drink the wine of wrath
Full strength in a cup of anger, fiery flames, a fiery path.

[Chorus]
