[Words By: Richard Lynch, Music By: Richard Lynch]

Robed with white fine linen
His bride behind the truth
He's waging war and conquering
False prophet sent the beast are through

His robe is dipped and stained with blood
His eye's a flame with fire
To take out abomination son
To squeeze the press to judge defilers

Reaping the flesh, reaping the flesh, reaping the flesh

Birds of prey they hover
A feast is called to earth
The doom of kingdoms power
The final kingdom curse
Fly down to devour
Ripping hearts and flesh
Birds of prey where dead men lay
And take their final breath
Reaping the flesh, reaping the flesh, reaping the flesh

The birds of prey they gather
The final feast delight
The scoffers and the blasphemers
They've got them in their sight
And know the beast and prophet
Thrown in the lake of fire
To burn in their eternity
Their flesh to feed eternal fire

Reap the flesh, yeah
Tyranny is over
Evils overthrown
Satan cast into the pit
It's his eternal throne
Through the smoke and fire
He'll needs burns out of time
Disintegrated instantly
Into the lake now say goodbye
Reaping the flesh, reaping the flesh, reaping the flesh

Yeah
Oh, reap the flesh
