[Words By: Richard Lynch, Music By: Dee Harrington]

Take and measure the temple site
Leave the courts out, out of sight
Witnesses roaming and walking the wall
Flamethrower mouthpieces devourer all
Power to shut up the heavens and sky
Striking the earth with their plagues till they die
The beast who makes war will come up from abyss
Ending their lives crushing them with his fist

Their dead bodies lay
The crowd they seem surprised
They're trading gifts and celebrate, the witnesses demise
But they don't know the score, three days down not one day more
From the depths of hell they rise, they set the bar and tip the scale

The angel sounds the 7th trumpet, Christ kingdom is now here to stay
The elders who sit at the throne fall to their faces and they praise
Enter in the 7th Trumpet
