[Words By: Richard Lynch, Music By: Richard Lynch]

Standing at the door it opened to the light
His majesty sat at the throne, a jasper stone in sight
24 before Him, the elders cast their crowns
On a sea of glass they bow to an awesome God, an awesome power

[Chorus:]
Now your view is in tomorrow, as you focus in to sight
Where the bone meets the marrow and the lighting cracks the sky
Hear the mighty thunder rolling, as the end begins to near
And the prophecy's you're given, now the prophecy's are here

In the right hand books and seals abound
And no one there to open, no not one could be found
The Lamb who was broken, was slain but yet alive
Receiving power and wisdom and holy they all cried

[Chorus]
