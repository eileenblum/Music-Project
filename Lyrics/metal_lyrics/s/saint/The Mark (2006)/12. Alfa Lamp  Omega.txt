[Words By: Richard Lynch, Music By: Richard Lynch and Josh Kramer]

I saw the river of life
Flowing from the throne
Ending the curse, the curse of time
For everyone He's known

[Bridge:]
Outside the gates are liars
That's how the story goes
Inside it's one big party
And everybody knows

[Chorus:]
That He's the Alfa and the Omega
Beginning and the End
He puts the lighting in my thunder
He's coming back again, yeah

With the mane of God
On their forehead
No need to light the day
He said I'm coming quickly
For those who've come my way

[Bridge &amp; chorus]
