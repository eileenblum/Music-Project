Mark 15:9-11

9 "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"

11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask him to release Barabbas for them instead

Was born a virgin child, to fulfill prophecy
God in a human body, walked upon the sea
He preached and fed the thousands
He made the blind to see
As his own people turned away, their destiny

[Bridge:]
On the hill you could hear the shouting
Screams of agony
And with a kiss fate was sealed
The time has come to see our King

[Chorus:]
He was born to be a sacrifice
A living curse upon a tree
He was born to be a sacrifice
A sacrifice for you and me

Mark 15:12-14

12 "Then what shall I do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?"

13 They shouted back, "Crucify Him!"

14 "Why, what evil has He done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify Him!"

A test of strength before Him, to test his majesty
Temptation called His name out
Watered down iniquity
The road He walked was narrow
He knew it had to be, He knew that in the end
His blood would claim His victory

[Bridge &amp; chorus]

Gal 3:10-13

10 For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse; for it is written, "cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the blood of the law, to perform them."

13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us -- for it is written, "CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON A TREE"

Was born a virgin child, to fulfill prophecy
God in a human body walked upon the sea
The road He walked was narrow
He knew it had to be, He knew that in the end
His blood would claim His victory

[Bridge &amp; chorus]
