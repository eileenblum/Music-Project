[Words By: Richard Lynch, Music By: Richard Lynch]

In the midnight witching hour
The choice is to be made
A choice you make can change your life today
You can choose to follow darkness
Or you can choose to follow light
The choice you make it's foolish or it's right

[Chorus:]
God or the devil
Who will you betray?
God or the devil
To whom will you pray?
God or the devil
Who will you betray?
God or the devil

Now you can choose follow
Or you can choose to stray
You can choose to throw your life away

You can choose to walk the narrow
Or you can choose to disobey
But you can deny the truth today

[Chorus]

In the midnight witching hour
The choice is to be made
You can choose to not choose but be afraid

You can choose to walk the narrow
Or you can choose to disobey
But you can deny the truth today

[Chorus]
