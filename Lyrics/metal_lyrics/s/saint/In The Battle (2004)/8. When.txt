[Words By: Richard Lynch and Dee Harrington, Music By: Richard Lynch and Dee Harrington]

[Chorus:]
When You coming down
When You coming down
When You coming down, again

Down in the valley
A cocaine road drug overloaded
The crack pipe's calling out your name

Riding the faster side
On speed bumps hitting over drive
Out of control you burn in flames

Oh you!
Who ya fooling, you!
So sad...

(Matt 7:13 Wide is the gate)
(And broad is the road that leads to destruction)

[Chorus]

Out on the main line
Your body working over time
Grabbing for straws the price you pay

Walking a fine line
Of love and hate losing your mind
So willing to waste your life away

Oh you!You're only fooling you
You're just fooling you)
So sad...

[Chorus]
