Red alert star craft approaching, everyone put on your gear
All systems go, engines on standby
We are the one's that they fear, ace that you are
99 score from the next one you find,
Out into space search and destroy
Find one to blast from behind

Darkness surrounds you
You're tending the radar
Won't break from the silence
Let nobody know where you are

Shining your light
It's the source of creation
Will be their demise
As it leaves devastation

There's one now, fire
100 (101) is the score

In the flight heart beat racing
Cruising through space with a dare
Armored with truth out for the conquest
Fighting the prince of the air

From the curse to the cross
We will fight for the lost
Star pilot

Red alert star craft approaching everyone put on your gear
All systems go engines on standby
We are the one's that they fear
Ace that you are hundreds of score
Not knowing what you will find
Trust in the hand co-pilot watching
Leave all your fears behind

Armor up star pilot
