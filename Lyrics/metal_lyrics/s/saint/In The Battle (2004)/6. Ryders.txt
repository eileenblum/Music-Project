[Words By: Richard Lynch and Dee Harrington, Music By: Richard Lynch and Dee Harrington]

Riding in the night to bring the truth to you
Those that once were lost, we ryde
Yes, the price was paid, you can have victory too
A beacon shines, it's light, to you

Are beggar's really fools, at least they're asking
So are we all just fools, not knowing what we're after

[Chorus:]
We are the ryders in the night
Commissioned from the cross
To bring the world the light
Ryders in the night
A mission for the lost
To bring the blind their sight

From town to town we ryde, our message just and true
To reach out, to the lost, we ryde
And if you wish to find the perfect life for you
Just reach out, to the Christ, and ryde

Are beggar's really fools, at least they're asking
So are we all just fools, not knowing what we're after

[Chorus]

Riding in the darkness, through the valley low
Lost and confused with hardened hearts
And don't know where to go
A mighty hand comes reaching, to lift you up on high
Upon your horse forgiven
Commissioned now to ryde

[Chorus]

Ryders in the night
To bring the world the light
To find the blind
To give them sight
