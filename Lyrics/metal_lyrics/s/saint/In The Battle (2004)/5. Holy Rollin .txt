[Words By: Richard Lynch, Music By: Richard Lynch]

Life is a venture, a conquest so to say
And so I endeavor, to live it day to day
In the midst of pressure starts to break my back
Then I call for Jesus, Holy Spirit's full attach

[Chorus:]
You got me holy rollin' now
You got my feet on the track
And your loves coming down
No I'm never going back
You got me holy rollin' now
You got my feet on the track
And your loves comin' down
You got me holy rollin' now

As I walk amazed, grace has covered me
Through the trials and wonders, grace has set me free
And when the worlds pressures, start to bite my back
Now I call for Jesus, Holy Spirits full attack

[Chorus]
