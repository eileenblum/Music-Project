[Words By: Richard Lynch, Music By: Richard Lynch]

You are the Master
The mighty everlasting King
You are the Savior
Creator of all everything
You are the Glory
The stripes You bare You bare for me
You are the grace Lord
That all of us have been come free, oh

[Chorus:]
Here we are
All of us are shining stars
A cause to bring our praise to You
And there You are
Brighter than the brightest star
Lord, we bring our praise to You

You are forgiveness
You made to crushing blow to sin
You live within us
You want us all to enter in
You have provided
The road that leads us to the way
We are united
Here we wait the coming day, oh

[chorus]
