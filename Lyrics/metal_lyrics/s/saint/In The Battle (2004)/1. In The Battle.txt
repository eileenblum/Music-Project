[Words By: Richard Lynch, Music By: Richard Lynch]

In the blackest night the signatures are done
The treaty's set, the missions clear
A nation to be won
He shakes the hand of fate
He's cleaver, he's no fool
He's set the stage, manipulates
He's setting up his rule

[Bridge:]
Hear the martyrs, hear them cry
White horse rider, with fire in his eye's
I hear the armies beat the drum
The end of time has just begun
The dragon wears a kingly crown
But his kingdoms going down

[Chorus:]
In the battle, in the battle

At the wailing wall
The witness they rome
From their mouths they devastate
With fire and brimstone
The beast, his throne of death
He calls himself the one
Abominations desecrate
His time is almost done

[Bridge &amp; chorus]
