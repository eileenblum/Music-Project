[Words By: Josh Kramer, Music By: Josh Kramer]

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

We live and breath and walk amongst a world full of killers
Pirates have seized and claimed the land
Rapist and thieves and thugs fast talking, whelin dealers
They'll take your loot and shake your hand

Everywhere you go you're always lookin' over your shoulder
Wondering if you'll be the next to fall
In the commotion of the world and all it's trappings
It's hard to hear His voice at all

Put all His righteousness salvation armor on
When we stand amidst the fray
His shield of faith will keep you save from arrows flown
Full armor on that final day
