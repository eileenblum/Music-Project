[Lynch, Smith, Miller, Knowland, Johnson]

If I could change the past
Would I be who you see
As I re-live the past
The chains keep haunting me

To live a sinnerâs life
And sin is all I see
And still you turn your face
On someone just like me

[Chorus:]
Hero, Hero
Between the thunder and the night
The Hero comes the Hero saves
The Hero brings new life

Oh when I see the path
As lifeâs toughing at me
Will I be free at last
Finally free of me
To live a sinnerâs life
Yeah sins consuming me
And there your blood pours out to someone just like me

[Chorus]

Hero, heroâ¦
