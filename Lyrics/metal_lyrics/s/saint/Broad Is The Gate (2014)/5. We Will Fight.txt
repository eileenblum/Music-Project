[Knowland, Miller, Lynch, Johnson]

You say come join the fold today
The only truth the only way
But how you paint it pushes me away

The question still remains in mind
Misguided faith that leads the blind
My heart is broke and I can find my way

[Bridge]
And I donât know just what to say
(We know the truth, thatâs why we fight)
It sounds just like insanity

[Chorus:]
What youâre trying to say to me
Is hidden in a mystery
Alive for all the world to see
Heâs calling out your name
(We will fight)
All the motions set in play
The rebirth of an older day
Itâs time to give yourself away
Your soul they will betray

The worldly ways leave me to blame
So many fears, so many ways
I feel the shadows calling out my name
In a race that some will win
A finish line thatâs razor thin
Apocalyptic final Judgment Day!

[Bridge &amp; chorus]

We will fight!
