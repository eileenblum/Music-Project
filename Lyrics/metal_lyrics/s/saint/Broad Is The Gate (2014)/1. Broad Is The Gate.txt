[Lynch, Smith, Miller, Knowland, Johnson]

Riding the edge of the night into darkness
Fading away in the sun
The roar of the Road King the wind in your face
The signs of a new day has dawned

The war in your sole never stops its invasion
And time never stands still for one
Like thousands of vandals approaching with terror
Know that your world is undone

[Chorus:]
Broad is the gate
That leads us into sorrow
Anguish and pain
Will fill each lonely day
Wide is the highway
That's paved with good intentions
Narrows the path
That leads us to the way

Cursing and sneering and spitting with hate
Trampling the ones who you love
Losing your grip now your life is in danger
Looking to heaven above
Tearing your robe with a fit so enraged
The cross road and gate opens wide
With boots on the ground when youâre posing for war
The road that you chose you decide

As the seasons change
The day's become so clear
Life goes racing on
So let me make this clear

As the seasons change
A day a week a year
Life goes racing by
So let me make this clear

[Chorus]
