[Lynch, Smith, Miller, Knowland, Johnson]

Tensions building as the earthâs about to blow
No one wants to be alive
Situations heated coming from below
Fists are clinched and men will die

Anarchy raging as a bowls about to spill
To give a dose of death to die
Bronze feet aglow as the armies spin their wheels
The demon dance is done, the Son of Man we hear His cry

Every tongue and nation
They will knell this day
As they meet creation
His will will have its way

[Chorus:]
Reach the sky
End of days
All bow down
So amazed
