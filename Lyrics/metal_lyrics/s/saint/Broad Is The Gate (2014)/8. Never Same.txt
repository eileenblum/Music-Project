[Johnson, Lynch, Miller, Knowland]

The candles burning
To deceive me in the night
My soul is yearning
To believe the things I can't find

[Bridge]
A million times I've gazed into these eyes of betrayal
A million times you set me free

[Chorus:]
Yes it's true, you'll never be the same again
It's true, you'll never be the same
All in time you struggle now as life rolls by
It's true, you'll never be the same, never be the same

Countless endings
Leave me wanting in the mean time
Blood forgiven
Broken shackles free for all time

[Bridge &amp; chorus]

My whole life I've lived in guilt for nothing

[Bridge &amp; chorus]
