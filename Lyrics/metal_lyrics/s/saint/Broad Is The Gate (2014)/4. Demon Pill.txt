[Knowland, Miller, Smith, Lynch]

I think about the tragic day you came to me
A love so wrong you set me free

The nightmare had its day see you a different way

Your so-called love was just a poison after all
But in the end I know itâs you whoâll take the fall

The wounds are healing now but I donât know how

The devil drank with me was blind but now I see
The devil drank with me one taste is all youâll need

The ride was winding down the pain was all too real
I took the demon pill to heal

The nightmare had its way and now itâs here to stay

The devil drank with me was blind but now I see
The devil drank with me one taste is all youâll need
The devil drank with me his grip was tightening
You tried to seal my soul but now Iâm demon free
