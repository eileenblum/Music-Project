[Lynch, Smith, Miller, Knowland, Johnson]

No way
Iâm given up
Iâll chase the final day
A path
Before me now
Is there to light my way

In Him
Iâm given all
Iâll give it all away
You know
Iâm living on for all eternity

[Chorus:]
We all stand
For the everlasting King
Raising our hand to the throne
Blessed be
To the One who set me free
Praises to Him all alone

Right now
The time is right
The seasonâs bout to change
On us
The Son has set
A harvest on the way

We stand
We hold it all
Until the coming day
We are
Dressed and robed
A bride for Him to save

[Chorus]
