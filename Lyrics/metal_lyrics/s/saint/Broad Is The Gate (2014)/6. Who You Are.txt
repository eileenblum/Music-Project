[Lynch, Smith, Miller, Knowland, Johnson]

I walked the streets last night distressed and feeling low
To seek the answer to my soul
And as I looked and saw the star cut through the night
The answers I desired were coming from a distant fire

So many times Iâve wasted long and lonely nights
To find a reason on my own
But in the turning pages darkness turned to light
And then I saw the star, I finally found out who You are

[Chorus:]
Oh You bare the scares
A shining star is what You are
You spill Your life blood out for me
And with no dignity You took my shame and Iâm to blame
Oh Jesus, I know who You are
Youâre the Bright and Morning Star

[Chorus]

Youâre the Bright and Morning Starâ¦
