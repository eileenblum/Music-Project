[Lynch, Johnson, Knowland]

You see the lighting flashes
Crackling through the sky
The cursing on the earth
As judgment day arrives
The day and time unknown
As prophecies fulfill
And now the end of time is up
open the seals
Youâre calling judgment day
Oh heretic you say
Heâs coming through the shy
No one knows where, when, or why
Itâs only the end of the world
The creatures and the earth
Are groaning to the thrown
A call to judges us all
Like nothing ever known
And yet they come
The foolish one
To claim a day and time
Misleading all the earth
The blind leading the blind
