[Josh Kramer]

Now itâs two A.M. The streetâs cold and barren
Rain cominâ down, he staggers by just starrinâ
Young cold bony fingers, ragged soul-less and hardened
In the search and the quest of a fixâuh in the back of a junkyard.
And heâs goinâ back for more, doinâ the zombie shuffle
Heâs goin back for more oh.
He takes an old crusty needle and stabs it in his arm.
His heart begins to pound and heâs about to buy the farm.
Staggering feeling like superman, aimless and flying high.
Begs for some pocket change from everyone passing by.
Back for more
Give it to me!
He looks, he looks around the city
And hangs his scabby head
Everyoneâs doing fine except the living dead
When zombies come out at night
