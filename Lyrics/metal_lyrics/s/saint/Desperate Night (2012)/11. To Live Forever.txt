[Dee Harrington and Richard Lynch]

Lately
The nights been dragging on
Hard times make you cold

Oh, I've been searching for so long
Now I know I"m wrong

[Bridge]
Living in lies and broken dreams
Watching your life on a TV screen

[Chorus]
Say it's your will
Say it's your thrill
Say it's your will to live forever

No time
Is all the time I have
To waste my time with you

I might change
But change remains the same
No cash back when change is due

[Repeat bridge &amp; chorus]

Living in lies and broken dreamsâ¦
