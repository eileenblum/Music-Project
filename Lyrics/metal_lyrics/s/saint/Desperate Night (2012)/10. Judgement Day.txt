[Lynch, Johnson, Knowland]

Who knew the out come there
Whoâs seen the curse
Whoâs in complete despair
As things get worse
God of day
God of night
He set the day unknown
Judas kiss
Motions set
Israel all a lone
Come Lord Jesus mercy
Purge the earth
Chosen before time
To show the way
Seeking God at night
To crush the day
Finding faith
Finding sight
The end game is in play
Israel nights
Tribes in flight
Escaping judgments day
Itâs the end of the story
From ancient of days into glory
