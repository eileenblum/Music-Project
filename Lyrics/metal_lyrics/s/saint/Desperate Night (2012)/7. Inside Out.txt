[Lynch, Johnson, Knowland]

Weâve seen the TV head lines
Weâve seen the outcome score
Weâve seen it all now
And I canât take no more
Agendas contemplating
There knocking at the door
And like the song it goes
Theyâll tax us till thereâs rich no more
Top down bottom up inside out
Progressives at the party
To nudge the end time here
Claps the system
Honor has no place in here
We the people ruling
Lead in Gods own fear
Weâve took our stand now
You know I think weâve made it clear
