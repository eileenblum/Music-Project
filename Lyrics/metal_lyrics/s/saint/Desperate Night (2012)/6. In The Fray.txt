[Lynch, Johnson, Knowland]

Weâve searched around the world to find
A different way
Faster, faster, faster
We want it all today
A lure on the hook to fill the store
House floor
And when itâs full inside
It leaves us wanting more
The walls come crumbling down
The start of a new day
And all the time you spent was wasting
In the fray
At lighting speed we draw our
lines and then define
And leave the ones we love behind
With insurrection looming facing
One and all
The walls of destiny bequeath the
coming powers fall
No time left
No time to
No time left to spare
No time left
No time to
No time left to care
