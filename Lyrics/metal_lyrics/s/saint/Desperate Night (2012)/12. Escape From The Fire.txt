[Lynch, Johnson, Knowland]

Enemy below we rip though the shy
Pounding the earth with a judgment day cry
Witness the power from heaven up above
Gallant white horses and those who I love
Crushing the dragon a blow to his head
Stomped though the wine press now he is dead
All of his glory and all his desires
Judgment upon him thrown in the fire
In forever hell
There youâll burn
Burn forever and ever and ever
In the heavenly fortress above
Unworthy followers cover in blood
Those who were tested with feet to the fire
Now forever in Christâs empire
Escape from the fire
