[Lynch, Johnson, Knowland]

Soon the changing tide
Will wash away
You and me alive
To face the day
Let it rock
Loud and free
Surrender you sprit
And youâll see
Surrender you sprit
Surrender to Me
Through the years gone by
Iâm blown away
Good and desperate times
Have changed our ways
Surrender today
Forever weâll stay
So rain down your mercy
Lord rain down today
