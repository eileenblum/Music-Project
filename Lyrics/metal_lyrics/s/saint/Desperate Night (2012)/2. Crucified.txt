[Lynch, Johnson, Knowland]

He said come follow me
He walked beside the sea
I dropped my nets
And started toward
I watched Him heal the sick
And cause the blind to see
I watched Him feed 5 thousand
Standing right in front of me
To bruised the heal in deaths defeat
The serpent crushed beneath His feet
Was crucified for all to see
Was crucified for you and me
(Now crowned and on the judgment seat)
He said go teach the world
Of all that you have seen
And to the end I reached for more
A vow to die like Him
No cock would crow again
And on a stake turned upside down
I was crowned
