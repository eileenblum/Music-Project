[Lynch, Johnson, Knowland]

Cursing 55, the last of summer days
The tension lets; the fury flies anger has its way
Oh relentless one He wonât let me go
He knew me then and knows me now
And knows thereâs nowhere else to go
Do ya trust Me
Are ya hearing Me
Ya got away
Ya gotta see that Iâm here bleeding
Running fast and hard to spin the roulette wheel
Rebellions set no rees or rhyme in it for the thrill
Oh conviction nears Heâs pounding down the door
He knew me then He knows me now
When I donât know whatâs up for sure
Do ya trust Me
Are ya hearing Me
Ya got a way,
Or will you bite the hand thatâs feeds you

[Solo]

Do ya trust Me
Are ya hearing Me
I made a Way,
Ya gotta see that Iâm the Key
