[Lynch, Johnson, Knowland]

Long ago I heard the story
Of the day that waits in time
Untold soul on earth were left behind
Like a thief at night in the shadows wake
There was a sound and a flash in the night
Two gone before me
The terror starts today
Desperate
Desperate night
All alone where memories haunt me
In this day and trapped in time
Reaching for a truth that wasnât mine
Desperate for a light to shine my way
Then a sound a flash in the night
Who stood before me
The devil has his day
Desperate
Desperate night
