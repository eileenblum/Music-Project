[Words By: Lynch, Music By: Lynch]

Holy moly
Caught in the rainbows end
Got to get my grip before I give in
Oh deceiver calling on apostasy
Caught in your snare of iniquity
And now I'm falling

Kicked and scratched and bruised
As You take the cross for me
It's so sad you see
Free the Judas in me

Armed and ready
You brought in your attack
You stuck it to me in the back
Silver Shekels
Hung by the Judas tree
You found the wickedness in me
And now I'm crawling
