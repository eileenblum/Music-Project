[Words By: Lynch, Music By: Lynch]

Take a look inside yourself
Now what do you see
Are you fool of greed and lust
Well you're just like me

Grace falls onto a bended knee
At His feet upon the skull
Grace fall onto a bended knee
To the cross I want to crawl

As you serve your selfish needs
Is your conscience fine
Are you squirming while you pray
Your prayers are just like mine

Mercies freely given
Do you hear the call
Yes your going to stumble
He'll catch you when you fall

Take a look inside yourself
Now what do you see
Are you full of God's own grace
Well you're just like me
