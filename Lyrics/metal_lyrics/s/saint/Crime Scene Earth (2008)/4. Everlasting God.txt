[Words By: Lynch, Music By: Lynch]

You created the sun in the sky
You created the night
With Your power, wisdom and strength
You created the light
You created this world from a void
You created the story told

You are the everlasting God
You are the One we bring our praise to
You are the everlasting God
You are the One we sing our praise to

You created the oceans and rain
You created the desert plain
With Your power and Your might
You created the blood in my veins
You created the song that I'm singing
You created the beat my heart's beating

You are the everlasting God
You are the One we bring our praise to
You are the everlasting God
You are the One we sing our praise to
