[Smith/Nelson]

I was seeing creatures fall from the sky
I heard Satan whisper gleam in my eye
Went searching for the father it's confession day
You'll hang till the morning then they'll take you away

God is God!

Wake up the souls are burning and spreading fast
Strip bare from their religion and innocence
You look to the beholder he always knows
the weakness it devours as your power grows

We travel back to sacred times
To the days when spirits fly

Nail me to the cross hang, my head in shame
Rip the cloth that makes me holy
Lay me in the dirt you like to rest me in
But in your soil I only grow
I only grow

Wake up the souls of burning
It spreads across the sky
Look in the eyes of the beholder
Before you die
God is God!
