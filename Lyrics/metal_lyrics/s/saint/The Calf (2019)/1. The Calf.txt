[Johnson/Lynch]

(Golden calf, you're the calf)
Do ya feel it
Coming closely
Time will tell its tale
In our image
We're so mighty
Up until we fail

And so we built a golden calf
For all the world to see
Created with our mighty hands
It's everything you want to be
We polish off the sin and stain
And fall down on our knees
Look closely in the mirrored beast
The Calf will never set you free

Feel the power
Full of envy
What we know so well
With our stiff neck
And our judgment
We've become the veil
Look into the mirror
Everything's so clear
Now I see
The golden calf
Gazing back at me
