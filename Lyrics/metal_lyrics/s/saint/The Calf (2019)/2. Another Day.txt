[Lynch]

See that no one brings you down
Many come to claim my crown
To mislead and to destroy

Hearing rumors and of war
Things I've already exposed
See that you're not fearful
Breathe the words that I've been saying

Well it's just another day
And I see the end in sight
As the earth is scrolled away
By a Thief in the night
See the writing on the wall
As the kings begin to fall
Oh it's just another day
Well it's just another day

In the end nations will bleed
They'll be kingdoms against king
They'll be earthquake in the night
In your tribulation pain
To be killed, my blood in vain
Here's were love has grown so cold (so cold)
And I'm just singing

This is how you pray
Father Hollowed be Your Name
Can there be another way
Or is this just another day

And I'm just singing
Oh it's just another day
Well it's just another day
