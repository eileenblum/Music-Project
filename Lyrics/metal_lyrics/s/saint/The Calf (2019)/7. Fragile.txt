[Lynch]

Oh this cities cold and angry
With curses, hate and all those head games
I've been banging on this six string
Trying to get it right
Hell is standing at the bar stool
But still I'm doing fine

Fragile
I'm so fragile
Until you deal
You'll set there (and break your will)
So fragile

Say this sinners set for glory
Chained to life and that's my story
The devils dealing out the end game
His aim is right on site
I'm weak and sitting at the bar stool
How can I win tonight

Take your aim and point your guns at me
Take your time cause I have been set free
