[Lynch]

Whenever I'm falling free, you call to me, you're there for me
I am illusive in my heart.
There was a time you called my name, I gave you everything to blame
I'm just a fool being torn apart
It's a cold and stormy night
And I fear I've lost my way
(The) a chance that I might follow
You is haunting me today
It's a cold and lonely night
And I think I've lost my way
No self-control a long lost soul to fight another day
Weakness inside of me, my path revels my history
Always convinced I'll find my way
But you are the one I need You've shown me so convincingly
A fool can't wait another day
Oh see me falling
See me crying
See me on my knees
Help me Jesus
Please forgive me
Oh Lord set me free
