[Lynch]

My God who lacks nothing
He sets up my day
Leads me to the water
Refresh me today
Guiding me along the paths for His Name sake
Through the darkest valley I remain

I will fear no evil

Your here always with me
Your staff guilds my way
You set up the table
My foes run away
Surly goodness and love will follow
All my life all my days

Though I walk through the valley today
You'll be there guiding my way
Lay me down in green pastures of love
I will dwell in your house up above
