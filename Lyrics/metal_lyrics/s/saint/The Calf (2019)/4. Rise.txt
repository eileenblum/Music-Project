[Johnson/Nelson]

Scream! From The mountain top walk me down by the river
King! I wear the crown of thorns your salvation I will deliver
Shine! I am the light I'm the sign of the Apocalypse
Rise! From the gutter we will disappear forever

Bow before your master take all that you're worth
Look out for the coming that I unleash on this earth

Scream! From the mouth of God spewing out man's religion
King! I have the falling of wings my salvation I am the sinner
Shine on! In the night I'm your Everlasting Light
Rise! Up from the ashes we'll escape damnation

Rise for your master take all that you're worth
Look out for disaster that I unleash on this earth
For I am the king

You will rise from the gutter
And we will disappear
If you bow before your master
Before the inevitable disaster appears

Heal! Repent! Rise!
For I am the King!

Shine I am the light I'm the sign of the Apocalypse
Rise up from the gutter we will disappear
Forever the King!
