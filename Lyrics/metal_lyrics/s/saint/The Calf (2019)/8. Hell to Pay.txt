[Smith/Lynch/Nelson]

Torture on the earth
The chosen are unveiled
Horror, Earth shall mourn
For flying off the rails

The seal is broke it has begun
The tribulation wrath
We've told you bout the end of time
We've told you bout the path

Coming in a cloud of glory
Judgment day has come
He'll return to crush deceivers
Awe the risen (chosen) one

The trumpets blasting out their scorn
The chosen are unveiled
In horror all the earth shall morn
Man's flying off the rails

And as hell comes reigning down
On that Judgment Day
Curses will be on their lips
Now its hell to pay

Marching off to meet hell's fury
Judgment day has come
He'll return to crush the demon
Reigning from above
