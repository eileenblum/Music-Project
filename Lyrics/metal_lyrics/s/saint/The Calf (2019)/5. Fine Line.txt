[Johnson/Lynch]

Out in the reeling places
Out on a distant shore
Your love came shinning down
Still I'm there for more
You breathe the breath that's in me
You know my every need
You've come to consecrate me
You came to set me free
And when I run away
I've come to say
I can explain
I walk on a fine line
An endless night I hear You calling
I'm living on borrowed time
There ant no time and I'll be calling You
You are my reason
I see You on the distant shore
I'm living in treason
I'm hoping that Your love endures
Cause You breathe the breath that's in me
And You know my every need
You've come to consecrate me
You came to set me free
