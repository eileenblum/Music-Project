[Lynch]

Blessed is the man who walks not in the darkness
Nor stands in the way of iniquity
Or setting in the seat of scoffers and of vandals
Pursuing Judgement Day, the final destiny

It started from the fall
We fear the face of man
And don't fear God at all
And when His reign comes down
Your knee will bend and all will bow

Like the tree that's planted by the streams of water
Bring forth the seasons fruit
Wicked men are like the chaff the winds are blowing
Nor sinners congregate in our God's way

You fear man's face
But we're just fallen
