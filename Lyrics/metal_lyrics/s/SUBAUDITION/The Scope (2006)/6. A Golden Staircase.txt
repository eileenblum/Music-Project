[music: Korpinen / NiemelÃ¤]

This morning he walks
The silent ground
Gazes upwards
And sees nothing

But can you blame him
The child
Watching the leaves
That fall down

Trying to make it all out
Depressed winds
Shrouded silence
Forgive me my absence

Just cannot understand
A thought suit in words
These lamenting raindrops
On the golden staircase
