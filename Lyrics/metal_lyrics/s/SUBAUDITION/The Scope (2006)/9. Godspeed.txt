[music: Korpinen / NiemelÃ¤]

Wake me from my sleep
But bind me into this dream
Ever searching the rapture
Ever longing to flee
But where

I'm already gone
Lost in nowhere
Waiting for you
To pull me back

These heavenly spheres
Are not made for me
But there being one
I'm starting to see
Through my tears

All lyrics written by Antti Korpinen in spring 2004.
