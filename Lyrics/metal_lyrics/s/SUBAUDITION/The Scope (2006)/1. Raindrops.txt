[music: Korpinen / NiemelÃ¤]

Tiny tears in the window
Into the skyline the steps go
It is all here, a death in vain
Emotions left nameless, coincided today

Who decides the time and place
Of all these incalculable days
For this grey dead scene
To wither, to blossom, to linger

Seeing the afterglow
I'd tell you to counterwise your steps
And let the divine dry your tears
On your way home
