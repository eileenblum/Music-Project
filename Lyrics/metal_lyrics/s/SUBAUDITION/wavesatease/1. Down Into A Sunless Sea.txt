[music: Subaudition]

Placid light, I delight to stray
Divine, not quite, thy pale beam may
Even seem lifeless, alone in a distance
Suffering from less eyes could glance

May rains a silent sigh
Leaves a goodbye on drowned panes
Benignant spheres, this night it steers
All the light and me
Down into a sunless sea
