[music: Subaudition]

Have I ever paced up those peculiar paths
Up to the hills and beyond
The wind that blows there
Carries such strange sounds
You have to hear yourself to believe

You might even come across to
Something you always wanted
And thought you could never have
There, fading it waits for you, in silence
