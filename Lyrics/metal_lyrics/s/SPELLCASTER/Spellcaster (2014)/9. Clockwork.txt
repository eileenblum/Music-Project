[Lyrics by Gabriel Franco &amp; Tyler Loney]

Under your spell, in a trance i see you
Young and full of life
As pure as snow, or the mark of a blood red wine
But you live no more

At midnight I take you away
Beneath the barren sky
To the arms of the earth we return
Together lost in time

Lying beside you, once as always
Dreaming through a broken eye
A thin beam of moonlight bleeds through the darkness
Gazing on where we lie
