[Lyrics By Gabriel Franco &amp; Tyler Loney]

Frozen in time but changing in motion
Screaming, my bodyâs on fire
Here yesterday but so far away now
Your blood rides the veins to my heart

Run away

In shadows I gaze
A man in a mirror
Far off and fallen behind
You always appear
Drawing me near
Reaching your soul out to mine

Run away

Dark hands burning
To touch your soul

So little time, just scraping the surface
Who is to say what is real
Maybe I have some kind of purpose
I cannot deny what I feel

Run away

Dark hands burning
To touch your soul
