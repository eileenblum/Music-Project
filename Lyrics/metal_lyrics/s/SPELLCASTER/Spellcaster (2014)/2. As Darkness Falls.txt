[Lyrics by Gabriel Franco, Tyler Loney]

As darkness falls thereâs a fire born within
Seeds of a black earth are growing again
Screams heard through time as the futures made the past
Our broken world, real at last

and from the grave, the dead are staring up at you
at you.

Like a million voices in the night
They call to me
Like a million voices singing bright
They call to me

As darkness falls

As darkness falls those who departed bleed once more
Up from their sleep reborn in the storm
A silver lining in the book of creation
Those who have sinned, sin again

No matter the distance
Close to the heart
Drawing together
And ripping apart

As darkness falls
