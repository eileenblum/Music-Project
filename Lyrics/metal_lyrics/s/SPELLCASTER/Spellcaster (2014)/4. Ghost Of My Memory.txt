[Lyrics by Gabriel Franco &amp; Tyler Loney]

Noises, a distant cry a quiver in my spine
Vivid phantoms haunting me
So many years have passed that time cannot forgive
I wake up screaming in the night

And from the darkness you return to me
So cold, so real
Are you a ghost or just a memory
Living through me

Enter, your silhouette is looming at the door
Dark empty eyes are watching me
Closer life and death are not so far apart
Thereâs nothing left but the soul
