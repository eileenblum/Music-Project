[Lyrics by Spellcaster]
Fallen victim to the night
Voices from the shadows you cannot
You cannot hide

Into the night I fall
Lucid dreams
Turn around
Bound

Reaching, I reach but I find nothings there
Silence echoes through the walls of my mind

Nightmares, specters of the past
Forever bound to me at last
At last
