[Lyrics By Gabriel Franco, Cory Boyd, Tyler Loney]

On the sea of night I drift away to shores within my mind
Blinded by the sight, the thought of what I had, but lost in time

I drift away
In my mind
What I had
Was never mine

So in the dead of night
I hear you calling
Every night you come back just the same to me

And in the moonlight
Your eyes are burning
Darkness guides your footsteps falling free
Haunting me

When I wake up and the world is dead
There are no more memories
Youâll never know that I still search above the earth in which you lie

The fire sings sweet melodies
Burning strong here with me
We turn to ash
And drift miles away
To sweet summer lands
Golden and green
