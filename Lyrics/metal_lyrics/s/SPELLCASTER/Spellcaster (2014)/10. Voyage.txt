[Lyrics by Gabriel Franco and Tyler Loney]

Another day has gone away
I remember when you used to dream
When visions seemed to manifest
Endless realities
But still it seems for all the effort you struggle inside
It seems to me its left to chance this time
Look into yourself

Sinister
Your finger points
Your judgment is written in stone
You think youâre free but cant you see
You are the one whoâs alone
Promises and secrets you said you would keep for me
But empty words die before you speak

All you are comes back to me

A voyage on a changing sea
Where I go a mystery
All the stars they seem to fade
I close my eyes and drift away

The winds of time come in crashing
Your body decaying in age
How do you feel
Can you even say how youâve drifted away
And in the dark
Thereâs no one there youâll remember
You see the stars grow dim and cold and fade
Fade away

All you are comes back to me

A voyage on a changing sea
Where I go a mystery
All the stars they seem to fade
I close my eyes and drift away
