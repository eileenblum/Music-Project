See it in the sky full moon rising
Hear the gnashing of the teeth
Eyes in the darkness down below
Your faith abandons you

Nite of the hellbeast
Feeding on your last breath
Nite of the hellbeast
Guardians of the gate

Lakes filled with fire sinners
Burn condemned by their crimes
Now gates of hell open wide
His fury soon unleashed

Nite of the hellbeast
Feeding on your last breath
Nite of the hellbeast
Guardians of the gate

Nite of the hellbeast
Feeding on your last breath
Nite of the hellbeast
Guardians of the gate
