In the beginning of time
Eons and eons ago
A sorcerer dwelled
Commanding the forces below
Held his hand to the sky
Called to the heavens with a mighty cry
Sky was changed gray to black
Prepare yourself for the coming attack
Cosmic power force unleashed
Warriors rode from the east
Could not slay the spellcaster
Now they serve calling him master

Cosmic power
Forgotten time [x2]

Spellcaster
Notorious tyrant
Master [x2]

Prophecy says the planets will align
Now he controls space and time
Tearing the earth to a sunder
The flames are growing pulling you under
The forces of evil their power grows
Forged in fire and brimstone
So take your final stand
The spellcaster is in command

Cosmic power
Forgotten time [x2]

Spellcaster
Notorious tyrant
Master [x2]

The spellcaster has arrived

Gabe Franco â Bass
Shad Covert â Drums
