Soft words spoken enchanting my dreams
Thoughts of lust are clouding my head
Tossing and turning I can't get the images from my mind
Carnal desires needing to be fed

Power
Power

Power rising deep inside inner thoughts you cannot hide
Dark recesses of your mind can you feel the power rising [x2]

Your poison sends me into a frenzy
Sinful eyes pierce straight through the heart
Temptations of the flesh are calling to me
Calling to me

Power
Power

Power rising deep inside inner thoughts you cannot hide
Dark recesses of your mind can you feel the power rising [x2]

Power rising up
