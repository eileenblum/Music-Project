Word is spoken of the plan that's to unfold
Pharaoh laughing walks away
Ancient powers brewing unknown to them all
High priest warned us of this day
Of this day

Calling on the plagues eyes of fire blaze
Chaos on the sand called by pharaohs hand [x2]

Blood red skies show them that their fate will be sealed
Hellfire raining from the sky
Summoning power of the forgotten gods
Now the mortals will pay
Now they pay

Calling on the plagues eyes of fire blaze
Chaos on the sand called by pharaohs hand [x2]

Words of rebellion reach the pharaoh
Now tossing his disguise away
Unveiling waves of utter destruction
Now you will pay
Now you will pay

Words of rebellion reach the pharaoh
Now tossing his disguise away
Unveiling waves of utter destruction
Now you will pay
Now you will pay
