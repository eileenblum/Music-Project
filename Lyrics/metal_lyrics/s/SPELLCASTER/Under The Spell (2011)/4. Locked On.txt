The silence of space is cracked by the echoes of war
The feeling of those flawless warriors
Explosions ahead draw them closer to victory

Flying through the skies looking for a target
Dodging crossfire aim for the cockpit
Locked on locked on

War the great catalyst to seize honor and glory
The blades of war strike fear into mono eyed victims
The sea of stars will not swallow me whole

Flying through the skies looking for a target
Dodging crossfire aim for the cockpit
Locked on locked on

Got you in my sights
Return fire

Giant steel harbingers of death missiles engaged
Pierce through the hull show them we still have fight
Left fight left

Flying through the skies looking for a target
Dodging crossfire aim for the cockpit
Locked on locked on
