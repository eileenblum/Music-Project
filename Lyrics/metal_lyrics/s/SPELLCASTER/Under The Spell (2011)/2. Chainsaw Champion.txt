Ripping and roaring your head will go soaring
As you feel the cut of his saw
Louder and louder your bones turn to powder
As the teeth climb inside you
Saw in his hand
Die by command
Forget the word escape
Mutilation is your fate

Chainsaw champion [4x]

The saw is his weapon bloody aggression
Twisted and cruel hatred his fuel
As hope dies and blood flow decreases
Turning your flesh into tiny pieces

Chainsaw champion [4x]

Chainsaw champion [4x]

He's coming for you
What's his name
