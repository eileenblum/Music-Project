I am the lines that are drawn from darkness to light.
The lines that are moving throughout the universe binding the planets to any mind and shaping thereafter

I am the constellations, the burning stars at night the thousands of suns reaching into oblivion.
I am the blood that floats through the veins of heaven.
I am wine and the bread. I am the rain that'll cleanse the world

I am infinity!
This cosmos shall form from ashes to infinity. This is my will.
But what are we? O, your soul is yet still repugnant, starred and empty And cruelty is your sorts delight You are nothing lout filth, an impure stream smudging the ocean But no more! I am the cleanser: the bringer of the new Universe.
I am the moon-tongue, the thousand faces at stars.
I am the sun, the eternal bliss of pureness I am infinity!

This cosmos shall form from the ashes to infinity - this is my will!

I am the lines that are drawn from heart to mind.
The lines that dissolve reason and love.
I am the new plague, the death of the inferior.
I am the Golden Holocaust, the massacre of minds.
I am the dance of death. I am infinity!

So sound the drums: prepare my coming.
You shall know me by fire, by light and beauty, by the roar of the oceans and by the collapse of the mountains...

I shall walk amongst you. Cleanse what is to be cleansed. Heal what is to be healed.
Condemn what is to be condemned. Destroy what is to be destroyed.
Feed what is to be fed. Love what is to be loved and hate what is to hated.

This cosmos shall form from ashes to infinity. This is my will!
