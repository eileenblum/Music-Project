Oh sun above me, you pure deep abyss of light.
When I gaze upon thee, I tremble with Godlike desire.
To grand up to thee, see that is my abyss.
To hide in the pureness, see that is my chastity.
Beauty is hidden within Gods - thus you hide the stars.
You speak not, this you proclaim thy wisdom to me.
Silent you descended before me our roaring oceans revealing your love to me...

And thus raised a dead soul and gazed with wonder upon a darksome world then I understood:
This darkness rests only upon them whose soul never grew:
Mine became flesh &amp; spirit and rose upon a soulless world.
Mine became lines that board the world to my hands.
Mine became a dimension your weak minds could never gather strength to survey

This darkness rests only upon those whose mind never transcended.
Mine became God: shapeless colours in a formless void.
Mine became angelic music, tones too beautiful to new 
For they never the pure essence of the supreme being.
And thus rose a dead soul and grabbed the world by its roots and tore off all withered leaves.

Oh sun above me we are one now, we are the pure, deep abyss of light We no longer tremble with godlike desire, nor we gaze upon the sky and wonder for me are God now.
We are one now. We speak through the world now.
We cry through the hearers now and we grief within the oceans...

And now I understand: the world is deep.
Deeper than I ever intended, the world is deep, as a void the world is, And as a void it must become again for I have seen suns collapse 
And I too shall collapse, but only to rise again with the might of a thousand suns, 
With the grace of a thousand stars and then world shall form again.
Shape itself from ashes to infinity
And then ... and then I shall become the only sun shining throughout the Universe

And darkness shall rest upon the world no more for I can the bringer of light and truth.
I am the way!
