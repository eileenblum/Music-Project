Old is the Universe, old &amp; tired. Grown gray through the ages.
Old is the sun, pale &amp; weak. Covered with Rot and festered from inside.
The Constellations - the stars, old and tired, dissolved into oblivion, pale and weak.
Old is cosmos, old and dying. But with its last breath it exhaled a new sin: the strangest of them all; Pure in its pureness, beautiful &amp; bright, shining through the void with the Grace of a million novas.

Behold
I am that sun: the last Gift of the Universe, the last sigh of Cosmos.
The new void , the new Chaos from which everything shall form again.
I am that sun: Everything that was and everything that's yet to come.
Not old tired nor Pale and Weak. Not grey and covered with Rot, nor festered from inside.
I am that sun: the pure essence of life. Pure in its pureness, beautiful and bright.

Behold
I am the coming of cosmos: reshaped, reformed and reborn.
I am the new sun, the new order, the new fountain from when everything evolves.
I am the new sun, the eternal bliss, the new void, the new chaos, the new all and nothing.

I am oblivion shaped into the god - eternity: The bringer of life, the master of the lines that are drawn through the Universe binding it to my hands and sharping after my desire.

Behold my peace
Behold my transformation
Behold life

For I am not a man, not anymore. I rose beyond one, and saw the Universe for the first time their God-eyes.
And now I understand:
What is reality - but a mad man's vision
