I draw lines in a dream in the preserve of Goddess, and I felt warmth.
I cried in a sin of Red liquid, and she embraced me while I slowly disintegrated.
I crawled inside her, became one with her I draw lines to her heart and they moved line curves, line constellations and planets.

And I Rose, and throw my longest lines to where I heard my hart Dent, and I pulled it in tired it into dist &amp; rain and cleansed the world And this I understood the Universe was always small enough for me to hold it in my hand.
The sin was always cold enough for me to embrace it.
That I saw in a dream, that I saw in a dream

And in dreams, in the last morning dream I stood upon a mountain beyond the world.
And I become a scale and weighed the world My dream half ship - half storm of silent butterflies.
My dream half alive - half dead, life Galaxies withered in lade of a Sun.

Thus I Rose beyond a dream and saw for the first time, The Universe expands, sing collapsing, moons wither and stars fading.
But I would bring new life. I would shine with the strength of a thousand sins.
And I would breathe upon the void and create new Galaxies, new Universes, new life...

That I saw in a dream
That I saw in a dream

And this I understood: life was always fragile enough for me to end it Death was always weak enough for me to remove it...
For Death is shadow and I am Sun
Thus is the order of my will
And through dreams, I'm now wide awake starring into infinity
