Let them all die
I scream towards the sky
As the corpse of angels descend

Let them all rot
I cry in despite
Let them all decay
Nature abhors a vacuum
And we have reduced ourselves to nothing less

So let them all burn
I whisper to a sun
Grown pale with disgust
This world has become the tomb of the very soul of man
This world is where angels rot and wither away in regret

And let them all rot I cry
Just let them rot
As I face the void of nihil
