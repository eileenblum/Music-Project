Newborn plague
Festering fetus
The curse of life itself
Praise only the death of man
Praise only the end of time
Stillborn hope dissolve into fear
Let the misanthropy have his way
End all life

Destroy this pathetic excuse for order
Destroy this very core of civilisation
It is sickening me

This rot this decay
This filth you call a man
This desease you call love

Poison the fountain of life
As the world lingers on it
As apathetic attempt to survive
And we are lost
And there is no way back

Let there be a massacre
End this confusion of life
