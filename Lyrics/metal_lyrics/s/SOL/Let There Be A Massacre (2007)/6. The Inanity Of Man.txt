The mind's debility
Unstable fragments of life
Moral declension
The inanity of man

A oblivious world 
Forsaken by gods
Human arrogance
The sanguinary plague within

If only I had a bullet for each human being
I would promise this world a miracle
I do not pity
I puke

That is the nature of my being
Humanity
The contagious sicness withing
