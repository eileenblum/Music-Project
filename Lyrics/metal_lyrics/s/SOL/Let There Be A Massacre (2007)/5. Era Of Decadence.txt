This is the era of human decadence
The slow degeneration of the soul
Seek beauty find none left
Seek truth find none left
Trust noone
Not anymore

This is the era of decadence
The slow decay of the mind
Seek faith find none left
Seek love find none left

This is the era of decadent pride
The slow decline of the heart
Trust noone
Not anymore
