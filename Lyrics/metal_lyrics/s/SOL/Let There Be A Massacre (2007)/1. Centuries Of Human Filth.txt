Let there be a massacre
A death to one and all
Let there be a massacre
A final slaughter

Praise the golden holocaust to come
Praise the death of millions
Centuries of human filth
Centuries of decadent pride

Let there be a massacre
A final death to all

Grief the rise of civilisation
Grief the human reproduction of filth
Praise the golden holocaust to come
Praise the end of civilisation

Let there be a massacre
Let it be soon
