Out there in the distance
We see it's glance
It keeps on shining
Showing the way

It's almost like we were dreaming
Now it is all coming true
There is no way it is an illusion we know
This is a sign from above

From the east we're coming
To bethlehem
We saw a bright star
Upon this land
We went a long way
We followed the sign
They call us magi
Mystics we are

As it was foretold
So shall it be done
The kings of all nations
Will bow and kneel down

On our way back, we will hurry
In a dream we have been warned
Jealous king herod hatched a demonic plot
We better not be caught

From the east we're coming
To bethlehem
We saw a bright star
Upon this land
We went a long way
We followed the sign
They call us magi
Mystics we are

Descendants of seth
The guardians of prophecy
Monklike we are
In silence we pray

With gold in our hands
Myrrh and frankincense we come
Homage we pay
The new born child

It's almost like we were dreaming
Now it is all coming true
There is no way it is an illusion we know
This is a sign from above

From the east we're coming
To bethlehem
We saw a bright star
Upon this land
We went a long way
We followed the sign
They call us magi
Mystics we are
