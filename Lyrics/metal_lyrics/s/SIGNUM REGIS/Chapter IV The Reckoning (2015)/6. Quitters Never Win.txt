Now you are on the road
It ain't no easy one
You walk from dusk till dawn
You leave it all behind
No matter how hard you try
You can't please everyone
No point to fight against the wind
Can't stay dry in the water

There is no other way around this time
No, not this time, you cannot turn around

Go for what's right, this is your fight
Tremendous power is in your hands
Conquer the fear, care âbout what's real
Don't let the agony kill your dreams
Better start right now

Something that looks like a loss
Might turn into a win
Winners they never quit
Quitters never win

There is no other way around this time
No, not this time, you cannot turn around

Go for what's right, this is your fight
Tremendous power is in your hands
Conquer the fear, care âbout what's real
Don't let the agony kill your dreams
Better start right now

Go for what's right, this is your fight
Tremendous power is in your hands
Conquer the fear, care âbout what's real
Don't let the agony kill your dreams
Better start right now
