It was not my own ambition to become a prophet
I was just a boy when I heard the call
For my teachings I was beaten
Mocked and often ridiculed
Almost starved to death locked up in a tank

Hear my voice, mark my words
I am here to warn you
For your kingdom will burn in flames
From the north, to your doors
Comes a gruesome disaster
Sound the trumpet throughout the land
Now's the time for you to repent

If you do not like the message
Do not blame the messenger
Change your evil ways
You brought this on yourselves

Hear my voice, mark my words
I am here to warn you
For your kingdom will burn in flames
From the north, to your doors
Comes a gruesome disaster
Sound the trumpet throughout the land
Now's the time for you to repent

Hear my voice, mark my words
I am here to warn you
For your kingdom will burn in flames
From the north, to your doors
Comes a gruesome disaster
Sound the trumpet throughout the land
Now's the time for you to repent
