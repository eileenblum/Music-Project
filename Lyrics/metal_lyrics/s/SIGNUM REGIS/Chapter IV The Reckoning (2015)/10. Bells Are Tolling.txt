Hope for a better day
May soon come your way
You never know
Who's at the door
Who's to come
What's to be done
Tomorrow is a mystery

Bells are tolling, in the open air
Angels singing
You hear it everywhere
And there's no more pain
Left to feel in vain
For you

A time to love again
A time for peace again
A time for war
Is now gone
A time to hate
Does not await
Today is a gift of god

Bells are tolling, in the open air
Angels singing, you hear it everywhere
Bright lights shining, all through your way
Beams are gleaming and brightening the day
And there's no more pain
Left to feel in vain for you

There is a time for everything
And a season for every activity
Under the heavens
A time to be born and a time to die
A time to search and a time to give up
Whatever is has already been before
In its time all has been made beautiful
In the human heart there is eternity
Yet no one can fathom what god has done

Bells are tolling, in the open air
Angels singing, you hear it everywhere
Bright lights shining, all through your way
Beams are gleaming and brightening the day
And there's no more pain
Left to feel in vain for you
