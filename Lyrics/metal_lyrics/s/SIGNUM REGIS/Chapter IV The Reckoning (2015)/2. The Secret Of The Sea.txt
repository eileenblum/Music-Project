As I gaze upon the blue sea
All those pleasant visions haunt me
All the old romantic legends, all my dreams

They keep coming back to me

Like the waves on a shore
Where the sand as silver shines
Flow its unrhymed lyric lines
Unveiling the ocean's secret
Till my soul is full of longing
I can feel the thrilling pulse
That the heart of the ocean
Sends through me

In each sail that skims the horizon
In each landward blowing breeze
I behold that stately galley
And I hear those mournful melodies

I can hear the helmsman chant a mystic song
I wish I could learn the secret that it holds

Like the waves on a shore
Where the sand as silver shines
Flow its unrhymed lyric lines
Unveiling the ocean's secret
Till my soul is full of longing
I can feel the thrilling pulse
That the heart of the ocean
Sends through me

I can hear the helmsman chant a mystic song
I wish I could learn the secret that it holds

Like the waves on a shore
Where the sand as silver shines
Flow its unrhymed lyric lines
Unveiling the ocean's secret
Till my soul is full of longing
I can feel the thrilling pulse
That the heart of the ocean
Sends through me
