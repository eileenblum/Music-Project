Clothed just with camel's hair
Leathern girdle âbout my loins
Spent my days on desert sand
I'm sent to baptize in this land

The kingdom of god is at our hands
Repent and believe
All heaven doors shall open wide
Great things shall you see

I baptize you with water
Make straight the way of the lord
Behold the lamb of god
He takes away the sins of the world

I saw the spirit coming down
As a white dove from heaven
This is my testimony
He is the son of god

I only tell the truth, I fear no one
You'd have to cut off my head
To quiet me down

I baptize you with water
Make straight the way of the lord
Behold the lamb of god
He takes away the sins of the world

I baptize you with water
Make straight the way of the lord
Behold the lamb of god
He takes away the sins of the world
