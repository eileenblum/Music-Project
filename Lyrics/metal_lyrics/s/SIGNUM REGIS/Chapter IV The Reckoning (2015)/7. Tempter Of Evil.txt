Now take a look down and see the splendor of this world
All kingdoms I own
I'll give them to anyone I want

You would not ever be in need
âcause it all would be at your feet
Your sword would rule the nations till
I get back to take your soul

Don't trust the liar
Never telling you the truth
Playing with fire
Won't do any good for you
Tempter of evil
Wicked deceiver

The castles of gold
All goblets of glorious victory
All this i'll give you
If you will bow down and worship me

You would not ever see misery
Your rod would change history
You'll hold the throne of this land till
I get back to take your soul

Don't trust the liar
Never telling you the truth
Playing with fire
Won't do any good for you
Tempter of evil
Wicked deceiver

You would not ever see misery
Your rod would change history
You'll hold the throne of this land till
I get back to take your soul

Don't trust the liar
Never telling you the truth
Playing with fire
Won't do any good for you
Tempter of evil
Wicked deceiver
