The kingdom of heaven
The kingdom of heaven is near

Proclaim the good news
The kingdom of heaven
Has come now near
We're on our way

Like a sheep into the midst of wolves
Dragged before kings and governors

We raise the dead, we heal the pain, we cast out demons
We hold the truth, all in his name, we are free men

We take no gold
We take no copper in our belts
No bag for the journey
We let our peace come to you

We are hated because of his name
If they hand us over, we won't fail

We raise the dead, we heal the pain, we cast out demons
We hold the truth, all in his name, we are free men
