Evil is rising once again
I can now smell it in the air
Twisted minds moving on with their plan
Sociopaths to rule all men

This is no time to give up again
Now is the time to stand up and yell

No man escapes when freedom fails
All the best men will rot in filthy jails
And those who cried "appease! Appease!"
Are hung by those whom they tried to please

Citizen spies and skynet drones
Highway checkpoints, martial law
Training for slave mentality
Collective guilt, insanity

Eyes in the skies, are now watching you
You're being taxed for everything you do

No man escapes when freedom fails
All the best men will rot in filthy jails
And those who cried "appease! Appease!
"are hung by those whom they tried to please

Oh... We are on our way
Oh... We won't go astray
Oh... We are on our way
Oh... We won't go astray

I wonder, how did we come to this point?
How did we lose all sanity?
As we turned away from god
We let all hell break loose

No man escapes when freedom fails
All the best men will rot in filthy jails
And those who cried "appease! Appease!
"are hung by those whom they tried to please
