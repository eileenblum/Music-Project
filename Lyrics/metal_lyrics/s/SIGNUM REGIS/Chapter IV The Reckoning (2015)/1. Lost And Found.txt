I've seen where rivers flow
How strong the wind can blow
I've seen the end of the rainbow
I've really seen it all

At the edge of the world
There is no pot of gold
But that's how far I had to go
To find out where's my home

Sailing âcross the ocean
To be near you
Sailing âcross the sea
To be finally free

Can you hear me through the night
I'm reaching out to you now
No matter what they say about me
I know you won't turn me down
You never turned me down

I've seen the world from the sky
I've seen it upside down
But i've never seen so clearly
There's more than meets the eye

Sailing âcross the ocean
To be near you
Sailing âcross the sea
To be finally free

Can you hear me through the night
I'm reaching out to you now
No matter what they say about me
I know you won't turn me down
I was lost, now i'm found

Can you hear me through the night
I'm reaching out to you now
No matter what they say about me
I know you won't turn me down
You never turned me down

Can you hear me through the night
I'm reaching out to you now
No matter what they say about me
I know you won't turn me down
You never turned me down
I was lost, now i'm found
