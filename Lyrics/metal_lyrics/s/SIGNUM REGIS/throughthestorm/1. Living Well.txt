There's a shadow
All around me
Seems like I'm not the fortunate son

There's no rainbow
To surround me
And the rain keeps on falling down

I went through hell, but I am back
Ashes are still on my shoes

Yet, I don't seek any payback
Peace of mind is what I choose

I've been mistreated
But not defeated
Despite the pain I am living well

Hate never helped me
Now you can't stop me
For my best revenge is living well

Deep in your heart
You feel empty
When there is no place left for love

Oh, you need it
Just like water
To quench the thirst in your mouth

Can't fight a shadow
Hanging all over you

No way to move it
Only to step outside

Deep in your heart
You feel empty
When there is no place left for love

Oh, you need it
You can't fight it
You just need an open heart
