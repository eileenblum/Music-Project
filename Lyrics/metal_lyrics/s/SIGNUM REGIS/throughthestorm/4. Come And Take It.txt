Summon all the country's finest
Patriots who hear the call

In the path of parlous danger
You are being pushed to the wall

When loss of liberty is looming
As it happens here and now

In the hearts of freedom's vanguard
Resonates the siren sound

There's a bad moon on the rise
Shining right into your eyes
Constituting rule of lies

Here we are again, on our piece of land
In the shadow of true peril

Waving freedom flag, armed with guns we stand
If you want it, come and take it!

Now, come and take it!

Never asking for protection
We are armed with guns our selves

If you want to confiscate them
Take them from our cold dead hands
