A lamp to my feet
A light for my way
Is every word you say

The poor ones you see
You care for the lonely
You hear the ones who pray

Our only king
Peace you will bring

Your word is with me
It stands firm eternally
The wicked are waiting to destroy me
But your laws sustain me
Yeah!

You are my guide in the night
I want to follow your light

You're my hiding place
A shield for my soul
You take me by the hand

You never forget
What you have promised
Our fathers in the holy land

I keep my faith
Unto the end
