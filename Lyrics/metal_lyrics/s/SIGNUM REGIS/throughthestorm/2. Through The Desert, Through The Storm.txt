This is the end of the journey
It's been all enough for me

I've seen it all before
I've heard it all before

Time to move on to a better place
This feels like a cage, there is no more space

Just like a bird, I long to be free
That's how this life was meant to be

Through the desert,
Through the storm, in the sharp wind I go
Raging fire, driving rain, a wind hurricane

Days of sorrow are now gone,
I'll soon find my home
No, you cannot stop me now,
I am on my way

I might lose it all
But I want to take the shot

There's nothing you regret more
Than a chance you let go by

Time to move on to a better place
This feels like a cage, there is no more space

Just like a bird, I long to be free
That's how this life was meant to be

Through the desert,
Through the storm, in the sharp wind I go
Raging fire, driving rain, a wind hurricane

Days of sorrow are now gone,
I'll soon find my home
No, you cannot stop me now,
I am on my way
