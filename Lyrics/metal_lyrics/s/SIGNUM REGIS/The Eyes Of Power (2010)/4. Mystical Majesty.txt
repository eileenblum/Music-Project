We're the chosen one endowed with majesty
We're the wisest
Worship, serve the gods with zeal

Now as the crown's been placed on our head
The fire's gonna burn again

Ever again kindled sacred fire
The flame that it brings
Founded again to perpetuate our name
The name of the king of kings

We're the strongest one
We bravely lead to war
Hunting lions as did our father before

Behold the greatest eye of power
We shall come and dominate you all

Ever again kindled sacred fire
The flame that it brings
Founded again to perpetuate our name
The name of the king of kings

Ever again kindled sacred fire
The flame that it brings
Founded again to perpetuate our name
The name of the king of kings
