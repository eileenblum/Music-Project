Under the eastern blue sky
Siege tower stands still, so high
Leans on sacked town's huge bricked wall
No one's down there, no one at all

Only the howling of the wind
May be heard outside
It's just an overwhelming pain
You could feel inside

See the endless line of slaves in chains
Disappearing from the sight of the scenery
Dura europos in ruins remains
Heaven, cloudless skies above
Echoes with tragedy

Dead bodies lay all around
Some left trapped under the ground
What lies behind such cruelness?
How could one be so merciless?

Only the howling of the wind
May be heard outside
It's just an overwhelming pain
You could feel inside

See the endless line of slaves in chains
Disappearing from the sight of the scenery
Dura europos in ruins remains
Heaven, cloudless skies above
Echoes with tragedy
