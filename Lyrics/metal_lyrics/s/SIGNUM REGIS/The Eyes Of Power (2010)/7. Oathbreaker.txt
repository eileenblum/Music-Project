Twelve thousand riders
Headed east
Fought for the kingdom
Fought the beast
Slaves, not their master
Feared no disaster

I was the winner
Risked my head
'cause he called a loser
Me instead
Mean slave, warmonger
Hero no longer

Oathbreaker - evilmaker
Madness filled your mind
Oathbreaker - evilmaker
You've been left behind

So what was I to do?
When in this unstable world
King did not heed
God's covenant... no more

He filled the tombs
With noblemen
But that will not
Happen once again
Now I'm the master
Fear no disaster

On and on, still I wondered
On and on... but I had to decide

Oathbreaker - evilmaker
Fallen from god's grace
Oathbreaker - evilmaker
Gone without a trace

So what was I to do?
When in this unstable world
King did not heed
God's covenant... no more

Oathbreaker - evilmaker
Banished from this world
Oathbreaker - evilmaker
As had been foretold

So what was I to do?
When in this unstable world
King did not heed
God's covenant... no more
