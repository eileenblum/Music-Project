Dragons made of silk surround his chariot
Shining armours, chanting
Sending minds aloft
Though times are so hard
Now it's time to greet with joy

Hail the master of the world
Glorious and bold
Victor by land and by sea
Get down on your knee
Bring light and flowers for he has come
Salute him 'cause he's the one

Purpleborn - noble, lorn
World of thine - earthly or divine?

Here he comes wearing a jewelled diadem
Few will meet him or kiss his purple robe's hem
He has got the power of life and death, untold

Hail the master of the world
Glorious and bold
Victor by land and by sea
Get down on your knee
Bring light and flowers for he has come
Salute him 'cause he's the one

Purpleborn - noble, lorn
World of thine - earthly or divine?

Hail the master of the world
Slowly growing old
Victor by land and by sea
Will he ever be?
Bring light and flowers for he has come
Salute him 'cause he is the one

Purpleborn - noble, lorn
World of thine - earthly not divine
