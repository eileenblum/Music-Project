Now all round the world
The end times seem to unfold
The swords have been drawn and
Mornings bring no dawn

Two decades of war
Like never seen before
Is that what we see
Our final misery?

There's no glory in this world
That lasts for good
In the end it always fades away
A few understood

Guided by pride
Vengeance or greed
We all would die
Die as the destroyers of the world

We shall never know
The day we'll die
We will have to face it
Eye to eye

As far as the sea
Destruction and debris
They put us to the sword
Mock all that we adored

So hungry for gold and
Slaves that could be sold
That all we can save
Lies far beyond the grave

There's no treasure in this world
That may bring peace
In the end it may pull us all down
We'd fall on our knees

Guided by pride
Vengeance or greed
We all would die
Die as the destroyers of the world

We shall never know
The day we will die
We shall live forevermore
Don't you cry
