Here is the dust and the heat
Finally trapped where we are
Soon there'll be nothing to eat, for us
Really it got that far

Where the ten thousand once marched
We have to march today
No bridges here that would overarch tigris
That stands in our way

Who could've guessed you'd be gone
No battle would be won
Who could've guessed
We'd be on our knees at once at last

Climate so dry
Where we have been trapped, deployed
We might all die 'cause you believed
You're the one who'd destroy
Natio molestissima

Bad omens, ominous signs
Followed our enterprise
Chasing those glorious times of old
You did not compromise

Prideful and greedy for more
You took that fatal turn
Ships that we needed before
You ordered to be burned

Who could've guessed...

Mountains so high
No escape yet no return
We might all die 'cause you ordered
All the ships to be burned

Who could've guessed...

Climate so dry
Where we have been trapped and deployed
We might all die
'cause you believed you destroyed
Natio molestissima
