[Verse:]
There's always a choice
which way to go
even if you're the King

If you don't let us go,
to worship our God,
you will see major signs

[Chorus:]
the water shall turn to blood
lice shall rise from the dust
hordes of frogs come out of water
hailstorm shall strike the ground

[Verse:]
stretch out your hand
toward the sky
darken all of the earth

let Egyptians see
the weakness of Ra
the folly of their belief

[Bridge:]
one might wonder
how dour the King must be

how much longer
will it take till we are free?

[Chorus:]
no cure for plague of boils
no hope when thunder spoils
no escape from the darkness
no point to fight our God
