[Verse 1:]
I was only a simple man
A shepherd of the flock

Never I felt like a leader
who was chosen by the Lord

I was not young either
Over eighty years old

[Chorus:]
But on the mountain of our God
I saw the angel of the Lord
In flames of fire He appeared
Plans to his servant he revealed

[Verse:]
Our Lord is almighty
he can turn things around

he can make blind man see again
and lame man walk

so why all the worries
when He is my guide

[Chorus:]
there on the mountain of our God
I saw the angel of the Lord
In flames of fire He appeared
Plans to his servant he revealed

[Outro:]
Mountain, Mountain Of God
