[Verse:]
never I thought I could be
still I cannot believe
I am the chosen one
chosen by our Lord

He heard the cry of his children
He's seen what's been done to them
surely He visited
the Kingdom on the Nile

[Bridge:]
there on the holy ground
I've seen the flame of fire

like noone seen before
on the Mountain of God

[Chorus:]
I was sent to you
to break the chains of slavery

lead you to the land
where milk and honey flow

the Promised land
slaves no more
the Promised land

[Verse:]
eloquence isn't my forte
I'm also lacking in speech
but I'm not alone here
I've got all I need

Aaron, the Levite is with me
knowing he can speak well
He will be my spokesman
and I will lay the signs

[Bridge:]
Hear the sons of Israel
what I've got to say to you

The Lord saw your misery
heard the groaning and cry

[Chorus]
