[Verse:]
in foreign land,
yonder the Red Sea
in the Nile Valley
lies the place where I was born

my brethern enslaved
by Pharaoh's orders
affliction and pain
Children of Israel

[Chorus:]
hear Pharaoh now what we say: Let us go!
God's on our side you shall obey, Let us go!

[Verse:]
Better you not
ignore our words
for you don't want to learn
Lessons I give you with my rod

[Chorus:]
hear Pharaoh now what we say: LET US GO!
God's on our side you shall obey, LET US GO!

[Verse:]
in God we trust
Him we will woship
He will redeem us
always He keeps the covenant
