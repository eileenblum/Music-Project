[Verse:]
you are the last one
you still can not give in
your obstinent heart
asks for the final plague

[Bridge:]
no one will be left behind, all firstborns will die
only doors with marks of blood Angel Of Death is passing by

[Chorus:]
heading for our freedom, pursued by the enemies
as we go across the Red Sea,
Pharaoh shall taste our victory

[Verse:]
six hundred chariots,
with warrios on them all
surrounded by clouds
and by water walls

[Bridge:]
they all ran for their doom, straight to the waters grave
all of them found their tomb, none escaped that rave

[Chorus]
