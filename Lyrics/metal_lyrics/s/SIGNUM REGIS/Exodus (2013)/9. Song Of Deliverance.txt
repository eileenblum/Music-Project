[Verse 1:]
I'll sing to the LORD
for he's highly exalted

Both driver and horse he's hurled
into the deepest sea

The Lord is my strength
and my only defense;
he's become my salvation
he shattered the enemy

[Bridge:]
Who is like you in holiness?
Who is like you in majesty?

[Chorus:]
Give thanks to the LORD
for he is good,
his mercy endures
forevermore

what can all mortals
do against me?
when he is with me
he'll set me free

[Verse:]
Better to take
refuge in our LORD
than to put oneâs trust
in mortals of this world

I shall not die,
but live in happiness
you surround me with
songs of deliverance

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
