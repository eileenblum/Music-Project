[Verse:]
Do you think I'm foolish?
And Iâll let you go?
I am ruler of the Nile

I make your lives bitter
And your bondage hard
I will bury you alive

All Hebrew sons shall you cast into the Nile
I watch as they die with a smile

[Chorus:]
Pharaoh, feel my wrath, I shed your blood
Pharaoh, almighty and divine

[Verse:]
I don't fear your God
I don't fear your rod
Sorcerers are on my side

Masters of black magic
Spells that give me might
Demons will eat your heart out

White and red crowns on my head
Show how far I monger dread

[Chorus:]
Pharaoh, feel my wrath, I shed your blood
Pharaoh, almighty and divine

[Verse:]
I ignore your cry
I don't mind you die
You are here to build my throne

All Hebrew sons shall you cast into the Nile
I watch as they die with a smile

[Chorus:]
Pharaoh, feel my wrath, I shed your blood
Pharaoh, almighty and divine
Pharaoh, feel my wrath, I shed your blood
Pharaoh, almighty and divine
