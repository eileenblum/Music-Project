Some say the world was made to be
a place of being, reality
all things you touch, can hear or see
is all you need to know

They say to stick to life itself
a well-known book, a given shelf
and all that may have crossed that line
they never ever show

Were we meant to be bare of fantasy?

Never Neverland
looms all around you

won't you comprehend?
starfire burns in your eyes!

Long time ago when we were young
old stories told and rhymes were sung
but those days have been lost and gone
we never wanna know!

Why don't we ever want to see
the gift of creativity
like any other gifts we have
but hardly ever show

Were we meant to be bare of fantasy?

Never Neverland
looms all around you

won't you comprehend?
starfire burns in your eyes!

Were we meant to be bare of fantasy?

Never Neverland
looms all around you

won't you comprehend?
starfire burns in your eyes!
