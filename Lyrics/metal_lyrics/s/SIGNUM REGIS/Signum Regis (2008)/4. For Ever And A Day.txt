Time...slowly flowing
time... where is it going?

won't it be ever stranding?

the time has come to meet your end
wash away your castle's sand, take you far away

Pain...drops of sadness
pain...feels so endless

the world seems so pale and silent

the candle burns, but you've been gone
is it time for moving on? hold on evermore?

Farewell
for ever and a day
we'll meet together anyway

when the time will make us leave this world
we'll meet all again...one day in paradise!

Mind...ever pondering
mind...always wandering

when will it find its own place?

the time has come to meet our end
we shall join you, see the promised land, we all hope

Ever for ever and a day
hope is our one and only way

when the time will make us leave this world
we'll meet all again...one day in paradise!

Ever for ever and a day
hope is our one and only way

when the time will make us leave this world
we'll meet all again...one day in paradise!
