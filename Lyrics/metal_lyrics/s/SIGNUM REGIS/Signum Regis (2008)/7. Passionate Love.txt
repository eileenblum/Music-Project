At the end of the day
when all light fades away

I long to feel you
holding you in my arms again

And when your lovely eyes
Keep on giving me signs

I know I will share
All of my love with you tonight

Oh, just make it last forever more
Without your love my heart would sore

I'm here to give you all my love
just let me show you now

Every move that you make
Every breath that you take
Will let us know how
Thet our love is passionate

Just make it last forever more
Without your love my heart would sore

Can't you see
I'm here to give you all my love

You've got start to let it go
all my love for you

I give my love to you

Can't you see
I give all of my love for you
