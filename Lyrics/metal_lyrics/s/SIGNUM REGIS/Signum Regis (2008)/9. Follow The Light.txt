Stronghold of crowned with a shade
Dark tower lone, the one man has not made

Blood-stained rough walls, dungeons, dismay
You feel a thud of your heart, you smell decay

Wherever you may now be
Whatever brings you there

Do not let fear rule in thee
Well will you fare

Don't fear the night 
Soon no darkness'll round you

Follow the light
And you will find the right way out

Dethrone the night!

Darkness all 'round, this unholy place
Prisoner's found, the king lost without a trace

He speaks some words, finally tries
handing a key, a map while he slowly dies

Wherever you may now be
Whatever brings you there

Darkness all 'round, this unholy place
Prisoner's found, the king lost without a trace

Handing a key, a map while he slowly dies
