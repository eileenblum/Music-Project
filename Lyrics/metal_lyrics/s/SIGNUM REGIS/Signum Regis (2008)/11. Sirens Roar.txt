Blessed are all who
don't let greed rule their minds
blessed are all who
don't have envy in their eyes

'Cause kings of earth now take a stand,
to war again!
their rage will perish all their men,
dust will remain

Sirens roar, troops march to war
blood will flow, blade cuts flesh and bones
warriors fall

Wealth and the means,
flow like rivers to outlying seas
fortune is lost, taken by the enemies

Will mankind never evel learn
to live in peace?
Will history come back again
to bring us peace?

Sirens roar, troops march to war
blood will flow, blade cuts flesh and bones
warriors fall

The spring wind brings us rising hope
for better times
we pray to the Lord to end this war,
to save our lives

Sirens roar, troops march to war
blood will flow, blade cuts flesh and bones
warriors fall
