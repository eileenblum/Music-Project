Now as you have claimed the throne
power and glory you own

future seems grasped in your hands
everything on you depends

Woe to you!
pride's on the way to your mind

sad still true
heart is what dies behind

Bright days of glory
may turn to shame

bright days of glory
no one's recalling your name

though you might stand tall
there is no rise without fall

Now when you're so strong and bold
no matter what we've been told

mirror is blinding your eyes
you have no ears for the cries

Woe to you!
pride's on the way to your mind

sad still true
heart is what dies behind

Bright days of glory
may turn to shame

bright days of glory
no one's recalling your name

though you might stand tall
there is no rise without fall

Bright days of glory
may turn to shame

bright days of glory
no one's recalling your name

though you might stand tall
there is no rise without fall
