So fierce and bold
at the time when tides were good
now weary and cold
provision less, no food

The battle was won
but the triumph did not come
the fortune is gone
no aim 'cause there is none

The full moon is rising
there in the Eastern sky

The Then Thousand marching
too late for them to cry

The distant walls of Babylon
won't meet their eyes anymore

No oath could stop
those who planned the treachery
the way to the top
has turned to misery

The rest wend their way
through the mountains to the sea
the price you now pay
oh mercenaries

The full moon is rising
there in the Eastern sky

The ten Thousand marching
too soon for them to die

The distant walls of Babylon
won't meet their eyes anymore

Mercenaries
your fearless eyes shed tears
you fell alone

Dreadful memories
the end is drawing near
you're heading home

The full moon is rising
there in the Eastern sky

The Then Thousand marching
too late for them to cry

The distant walls of Babylon
won't meet their eyes anymore
