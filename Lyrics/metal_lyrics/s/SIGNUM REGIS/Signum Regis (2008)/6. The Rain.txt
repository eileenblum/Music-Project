When all hope seems gone, fading
and time has hurt your mind

The pain is here, non-ending
and no escape you find

Then from high above suddenly, somehow
rain will fall you'll see
rain is on the way
and then you will feel gradually relief indeed

You will feel the rain...draining all the pain
no pain will remain

When no one comes to help you
and you feel left behind

There's still a chance left for you
you are one of a kind

Right from high above suddenly, somehow
rain will fall you'll see
rain is on the way
and then you will feel gradually relief indeed

Then from high above suddenly, somehow
rain will fall you'll see
rain is on the way
and then you will feel gradually relief indeed

You will feel the rain...draining all the pain
no pain will remain
