Finally, 21st century is here
but it's clear, something's gone wrong
we feel the fear

Restless, heartless
people are more and more hopeless
coldness, falseness rules them
while emptiness devours their souls

Lord, spread your shelter all over the world
core of the universe is growing cold

Do not let mankind stray here all alone
lighten our hearts
don't let the turn to stone

I believe
that's not a dream you wished to live
keep your faith
you're not the only one, you see

Shapeless, spaceless
candle is burning with endless
brightness, warmness for all
the faith is the source for the hope

Lord, spread your shelter all over the world
core of the universe is growing cold

Do not let mankind stray here all alone
lighten our hearts
don't let the turn to stone

Lord, spread your shelter all over the world
core of the universe is growing cold

Do not let mankind stray here all alone
lighten our hearts
don't let the turn to stone
