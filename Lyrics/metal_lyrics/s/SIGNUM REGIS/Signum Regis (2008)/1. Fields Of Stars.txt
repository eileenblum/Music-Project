Sometimes I gaze
at the edge of universe
the silent realm and the fields of stars

Far in the haze
time as it seems flows like in reverse
it brings the fear, leaves no scars

But the world below, just the one we know
has a different pace
not the like reality, immortality
out the outer space

But one day...
black hole gate shall open wide
lock away the evil inside
we shall walk the fields of stars

Sometimes I try
to reach tah distant shore
of the otherworld that I see

No, I can't fly
but all I've been looking for
is surely waiting there for me
on the other side

But the world below, just the one we know
has a different pace
not the like reality, immortality
out the outer space

But one day...
black hole gate shall open wide
lock away the evil inside
we shall walk the fields of stars

But one day...
black hole gate shall open wide
lock away the evil inside
we shall walk the fields of stars
