Watch you leave this world to find your heaven is gone
Saw you crucify your mind your soul left unsung
Heard you death-defy your eyes saw you crawl inside the blind
Know you left this world to find your heaven is gone

Watch you leave this world to find your heaven is gone
Saw you touch the end of time and fall form the sun
Felt you climb inside the light thought it held the final sign
Know you left this world to find your heaven is gone

The light is gone when the life is gone
You are closing your eyes no soul to cry
And all that you said is falling away
The light is gone when the life is gone
