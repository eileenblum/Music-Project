And when the earth cracks and slides into the sea
You will hear the cries of your kind you will feel the weight of your crimes
And when the death black cloud eclipses the sky
You will feel the break of your mind you will know the end of all time Lord take you

Bow down for your salvation
Bow down before your end
Lay down for your destruction
Countdown to your last prayer
It is coming down on you

And you watch your cold skyline crumble and fall
There is nowhere to run no saviour will come
And all vacant stares and possessions are one
In the wreckage beneath in the graves at your feet Lord break you
