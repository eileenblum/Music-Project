Slow descent you are spiralling down cold earth ushering out
Worn lives a river of waste blind eyes unworthy of grace

Clouds fold you are swallowing ground
Then it is silence sweet silence falls across the Earth down
The sickness is cured then it is silence sweet silence you freed the earth

Slow descent you are spiralling down last words before dying out
Fall short a desert of names last cry of a world gone extinct
