Face down lying in your bed of prayers
While you sell yourself, pieces fall from you
So your begging for your own destruction
With your lifeline tied in sell yourself

Under a broken sky under a broken sky
Open and lost you lie under a broken sky
Under a broken sky under a broken sky
Open and lost you writhe under a broken sky
Let it not be said can I feel
Let it not be said your suffering is real close your eyes

Head down shaking with your eyes rolled back
No one knows your name feel your time coming
So the ground kicks out beneath your feet and
Leaves your dead weight hanging end your time
