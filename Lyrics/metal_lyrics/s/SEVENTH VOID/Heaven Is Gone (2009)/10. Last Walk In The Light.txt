Last stop on the train last stop on the train tonight
You are riding alone you are riding alone tonight
Move on and you roll the dice move on and you roll the dice
You are going to pay the price last walk in the light

Last light of the sun last light of the sun tonight
You are walking alone you are walking alone tonight
Move on and you roll the dice move on and you roll the dice
You are going to pay the price last walk in the light

And your will is strong and you are rolling
And the shadow is long and you are moving hard
And your will is strong and you are rolling
And the shadow is long and you are moving hard
Last walk in the light last light of the sun last light of the sun tonight
