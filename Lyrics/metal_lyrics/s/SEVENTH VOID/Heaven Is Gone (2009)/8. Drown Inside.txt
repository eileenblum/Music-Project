Hole inside me swallow me in your bitter water drown in fear and sorrow
Hole inside you you tremble slowly but you feel nothing
Reach for the surface and drown and I know you are drowning inside
Drowning in you drowning

Know I am nothing that you cannot reach me and I cannot feel you
Lay your soul in silence die and come back
Your feature has washed down but your eyes remain
Fixed on the sky but you are blind and I know you are drowning inside
Drowning in you drowning

Hole inside you is going to send you to hell
Hole inside you is going to send you to heaven
Hole inside you is going to send you to heaven
Hole inside you is going to send you to heaven
