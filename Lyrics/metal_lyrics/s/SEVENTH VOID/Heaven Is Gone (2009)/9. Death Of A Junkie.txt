For all the fears inside your head for all the times you craved the end
And now your world looks down on your closed eyes their faded prayers for your wasted life
For all the pain inside your soul for all the time lost in yourself
And now your world looks down on your dead eyes
Their helpless tears wrapped in the lies around your soul

For all the thorns built in your crown for all the death pulling you down
And now your world looks down on your warm grave their faces turned from the death of a slave
Your worthless life has been in vein you spread the earth and bury your name
And now your world looks down on your warm grave
Pieces of them caught in the chains around your soul

All you have said and all you have done lives inside the ones you wronged
All you leave is all you trade for the dying around your soul
Around your soul around your soul
