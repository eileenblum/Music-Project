Your soul is dying now along with your mind
You crave the missing peace that you will never find
Your pulse is racing and your time is running out
You know the room is closing in on you now
It is closing in you are sinking

Your god has abandoned you there is no hope in sight
You pray in silence but you cannot see the light
And now your darkest hour you are going down
You know the room is closing in on you now
It is closing in you are sinking

Rising out fallen back the sky has gone
Your body has down take your soul to nowhere
