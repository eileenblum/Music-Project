It drags you down and bends your mind
It drags you down and takes your life
Now you are soul-down lying on your slab
Take the hit and run and now you are damned
Killing you slow breaking you down
Killing you slow breaking your will and your soul

Brace yourself the shadow's coming down
Mouth is open fingers reaching out
Now they will find you sinking in your cell
You should have known it would come to this
Killing you slow breaking you down
Killing you slow breaking your will and your soul

Taking its toll on your mind and the walls start to breathe
Eyes are watching lose control of your mind
Dark suspicion turns you cold the walls are listening
Taking its toll lose control taking its toll lose control
