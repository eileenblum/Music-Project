Inside your eyes I see the snake in your soul
A smile inside you as you wait for my fall
You think I am blind but I can see through your lies
It is over it is over

Your shadow's hanging over my head
You make the sun go out
You make the sun go black inside me
Your shadow's hanging over my head
You make the sun go out
You make the sun go black inside me

Inside your world I feel the death of my dreams
I would rather die than see you profit from me
Know I would destroy myself to break your control
It is over it is over

To save myself going to break my chains
To save myself going to save myself
To save myself going to break my chains
To save myself going to save myself
