You are so different
You're two of a kind
I ain't got your knowledge
But hey, you don't got mine
You'd cross a big ocean
To get what you want
But here in the darkness
You don't know where you are

With all of your heart
You were searching for friends
And all of your heart
Was looking for love, once again

I'm to scared to close my eyes
I'm even more scared to open them up
I had a wish that I'd never been born
While I was hiding there, in my thoughts
In the eye of the storm

As a child you felt haunted
You never found
Those screaming voices you hear
Deep down in your mind, you'll find
You have to end it
And let go of this fight
Just one way to solve it
There's no other way out

Just wounds in the past
And nobody knew
But now when you're dead
You'll find your sweet love at last
