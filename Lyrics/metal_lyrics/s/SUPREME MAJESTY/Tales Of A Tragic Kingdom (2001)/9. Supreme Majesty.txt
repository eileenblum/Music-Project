Born with a predestined role
A heart with a brave knight's soul
My fate has a duty to fill
Be a king by my own hand I will

The path lies ahead, got no time to waste
There's no retreat, forever bound
To my god-given task
I will reach for the stars
be the one and the only rising above ....
Yield to me and my might
Kneel before your ruler a supreme majesty

Enemies fall by my steel
Supreme, to no man I kneel
For fallen there's no time to mourn
Through battle a warrior is born

I will reach for the stars,
be the one and the only rising above ....
Yield to me and my might, 
Kneel before your ruler a supreme king

The blood that stains my sword
Bears mark I am your lord
Before leaves fall to ground
Through power I will wear the crown

Victory is in my hand
Behold, I've conquered the land
By morning the prophecy's met
Yet all now I feel is regret
