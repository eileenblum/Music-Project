Pain, remorse, regrets
You cry yourself to sleep
But no one can hear you weep
Pale and white of fear
Can't stand another day
You have to find a way

Can't hold on to all your misery

Let it go
There's no reason to cry
Let it go
Got to stop asking why
Let me show
There's a meaning to it all

I have tried to learn
What lurks behind the door
At the end of the road
None will know the truth
It's a fight you're bound to loose
Your pain is of no use

A spark of light, hope is in sight
Demons of the past, don't make them last

Hey, I'm yours, your mine
We'll leave it all behind
Together we'll survive
Day by day go on
Just don't step through that door
Then all this is no more

Just let go of all your misery
