3000 years ago, in the land of egypt
Pharao's first born child,
Dies in the bloom of her youth
High priest they gather,
To summon an evil spell
To bring back her soul,
But in darkness she will dwell

Behind the sweet mask of beauty
Rest a beast foul as the very depths of hell
Enchanting, seduces the week one
She tears out your soul and forever is gone

Queen of egypt, buried in a crypt
A tale of sorrow is her
Yours to, if you don't beware

One night each seventh year,
Rising from the grave
Blackened heart stone-cold as ice,
Her soul was never saved
Don't walk in her path,
Stay out of her way
If her eyes are on you,
You'll never get away
