They gather up, all around, demons of the past
Vicious eyes behold their wrath
The pain forever last
What can I do, where can I run, to hide is to die
Trapped in limbo upon this earth
All I ask is why

So I cry, shedding the tears of life
Wasting the years to try, seek out the light
Leave me be, you can't save what's left of me
Not of this world I am, to proud to fight

Dark, shadows without form, no purpose terminating
The dark light of truth
Not for their eyes to see
Laws of happiness, a product of termination
I can't obey their foul commands
This world is not for me

Escaping the night, you close your eyes
Fooled you are safe, believe in their lies
The purpose is hidden, beyond your week mind
But I'd stay in the dark, if I just could close my eyes
