Seems like eternity
Since leaving my homestead behind
Now it comes back to me unwind
Crossing the wastes
God knows I've travelled afar
Following a vision of you, like a northern star

Now that I'm here, I'll never leave you
You guided my way to our castle that's home
Now that I'm here, I'll never leave you
In the kingdom of time, together we'll roam

I've felt insanity
I've been a searcher for all of my life
There was no meaning to it all
Stumbling in the dark
Like a blind man that can't see the light
Your faith is what keeps me alive

You are the key to our sun that will rise
Like drops of the rainbow, upon a solemn sky
We'll be together, for the rest of our lives

We are two wanderers
Two lost souls left on our own
The dream is ours to fulfil
Life is a time of pain
A race that can not be won
But come let's ride into the sun
