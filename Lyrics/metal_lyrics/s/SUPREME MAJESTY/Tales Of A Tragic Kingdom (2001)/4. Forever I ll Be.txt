Your eyes are cold, I see it clearly
There's something that's all wrong
Your silence it speaks, I feel it sadly
That we should part our ways

Can you look into my eyes
And not see the sadness they hold
Can you take me in your arms, just for a while
And tell me, this is all gone

You turn away, you don't believe me
Or take me for a fool
No more to say, just walk away
Know I'll be mourning you

Before you go, come on and tell me
Remembering days, when you walked beside me
Together we would win the world
Those days are gone now, nothing but emptiness
Will I ever learn to live without your love , no
