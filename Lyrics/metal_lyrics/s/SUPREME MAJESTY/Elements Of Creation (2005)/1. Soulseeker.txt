[Music: Tobias Wernersson &amp; Chrille Andersson]
[Lyrics: Daniel Andersson ]

I am lost without a reason
Finding out no way
Now I see a nameless horror
Wrought of endless fear

Walk alone
through blackened shadows
Eternal grief is mine
I challenge hell's deepest fires
To claim what should be mine

Those dark times I feel in dismay
Seems there's only pain in my life
But I, I will not fall

[Chorus:]
I'll make a stand
King of this land
I'll be like fire in the night
Then you will know
This is your foe
I'll be like fire in the night
I don't need your cross of guilt
I am a fire in the night

Formless shapes of my own terror
See them point at me
Wretched foes, my silent jury
Sentence me to burn

Feels like I'm lost - have no soul
On this road, I walk alone
But I, I heed the call

[Solo: Tobias Wernersson]

Believer, truth seeker
Cold eyes of pure mischief
Redeemer, storm bringer
In skies of black born of grief

Now I, I am immortal
