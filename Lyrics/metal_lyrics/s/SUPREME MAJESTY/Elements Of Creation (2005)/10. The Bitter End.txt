[Music: Tobias Wernersson]
[Lyrics: Daniel Andersson]

Born from silence,
bound for silence
There's no turning back
Why keep searching for
a truth you will not find
And end up in black

Life's like a bad charade where we
Are actors on the stage

[Chorus:]
I know, though we can't live forever
I'm staying 'til the bitter end
Still, if nothing is to stay until forever
What matter does the bitter end?

Mind's intriguing, soul's deceiving
Black shadows must be gone
From forever, 'til whenever
The show must go on

I'll play my part until the end
Until the curtains fall

[Solo: Tobias Wernersson]
