[Chorus:]
Die, I'm dying in a dream
No one can hear my screams
Surrounded by a night I can't fight,
I could be caught here in eternity

My eyes are shut, and I fall to sleep
Not long before, it all starts again
The same nightmare, once more
If I don't wake up,
I'll be lost in eternity

The faces, the demons
Tearing me apart from inside
The whispers, the screams
Paralysing my terrified mind

[Solo: Chrille Andersson]

Will I wake up at all,
or will I die before dawn
I can hear my reaper,
as I run for shelter
Closer, closer,
I can hear him breathe
Closer, closer, closer,
I can feel his scythe fly
