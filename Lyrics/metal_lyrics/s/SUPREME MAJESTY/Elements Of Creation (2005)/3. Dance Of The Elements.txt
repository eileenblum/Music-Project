[Music: Tobias Wernersson &amp; Chrille Andersson]
[Lyrics: Daniel Andersson]

Like a fire bursting, flaming skies are torn
Thunder strikes, echoes in the air
Through the mist of aeons, thousand souls are born
Minds awaken, thoughts are shaped, reborn

There are great powers in the air
And from the void, tranquility, itself unaware

[Chorus:]
Hear the voice, Desire
Echoes up from nothingness
Calling forth each power,
joined in a dance of elements
Hear them breed, come fire
Each one kind, earth, wind and rain
Swirl together in the dance of the elements

See the lady, the creator of all kind
See the void, molded by her hand
Universe is slowly swaying to the sound
Of her all wise nature, godly stature, profound

Mysteries growing in the night
Princess of time, in ecstasy,
riding through starlight

[Solo: Tobias Wernersson]
