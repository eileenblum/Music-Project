[Music: Tobias Wernersson ]
[Lyrics: Tobias Wernersson]

Standing alone in sorrow
Wake up now the smoke has cleared
Feels like there's no tomorrow
But no one can see your fear

Fight against the demons in your mind
You can feel it coming from behind

[Chorus:]
You'll see a light across the sky
If you surrender you will die
Never look back, remember you're on the run
No one but you can break the spell
Leaving your life a living hell
Follow the signs, away from the evil one
... Spellbound

Now when the world stopped turning
Got everything you desire
The armour of flames keeps burning
Your courage will fuel the fire

[Solo: Tobias Wernersson]
