He was coming from the cold
Didn't know where he was but a
purpose he had to follow
There was laughter all around him
People mocking his visions and
prophecies deemed as hollow

Then the sky crashed down
And the spheres collide
They would hide in fear
Feel the darkness near

Hey now, fallen star
Your soul was not meant to be free
Fire, across the sky
This time he knows it's for real
Hey now, fallen star
Breaking up seven seals
Fire, across the sky
This time he knows it's for real

Riding on through endless skies
On a steed pearly white as the
sun-sparkling mist of morning
With a mind set on just one mission
Save the earth from the void, be a
guardian of all that's righteous

Then the sky crashed down
And the spheres collide
People hide in fear
Now the darkness is near

Struggling with the beast for an age
A final blow falls hard through his heart
Silently they fall to the ground
United, both as one, one as all
