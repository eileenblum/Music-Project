[Japanese Bonus Track]

Maybe the first time I got you inside
It was a moment, a scary cold night
Stood there and watch you, Jack Daniel's
supporting my thoughts

Sailing away on this cold winter night
Afraid of the danger the shadows may hide
Time will soon tell that this battle has come to an end

Denied those thoughts through all those
years. Without you by my side I'll fear
That the mask that I'm wearing soon will
fall off and leave a stain
In spite of that, I will not die in vain

(Now hear those)

Screams from my shelter, to far from the sun
Haven of calm starts reloading the gun
Blueprints of life, won't be able to save me
this time. Which one of us is without any sin
Right in between where the bullet went in
I'll never surrender, never surrender alive

Dark are the thoughts that occurred in my head
Walked on the path to the valley of dead
The demons I hide will not cease to exist 'til the end

End of the story with scars in my face
Secrets revealed and my hide-away place
Embraced by the shadows,
I leave my own future behind
