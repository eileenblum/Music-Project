Come a little closer
And let me feel your warmth
Feel your skin towards mine,
feel the passion burn inside
We are all that matters
Let us hide here for a while
You and I, and leave our worries,
all that's bad behind

Cause tonight, you fulfilled my life
And tonight, I want to hold you so tight

So please don't leave without a sign
And please be here when sunlight
breaks at dawn
When the night walks on home
And if you're scared of letting go
I will be waiting here forevermore,
right until the end of time

I have dreamed about you
Through lonesome endless nights
You were there beside me, even
though you're far away
Through a stormy ocean
Through the pitch-black depths of time
I have sailed afar and nothing's ever felt
like home

But now your here, and fulfil my life
You're here tonight, I will hold on to you tight
