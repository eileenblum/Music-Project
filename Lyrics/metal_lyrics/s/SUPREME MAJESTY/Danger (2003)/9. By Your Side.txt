A tear is trailing down
As raindrops are falling from the sky
The grief, heavy on your soul
Your thoughts, just keep on asking why

Each breath lasts eternally
With pain and with hunger unfulfilled
You're trying to reach out
Remembering a voice inside your head

Cause you know, this time is worth waiting
And for sure, we'll meet again someday

I know that it's hard
It's tearing me apart
We can't go on
But love will still find a way
One step at a time
Feel my heart as I
Stand by your side
So close but yet far away

You stare through the looking glass
Impaling your mind with just one glance
You shiver, as shadows
Sweeps by and embrace you in a dance

Then you know, that I will still be waiting
On this side, keeping this flame on fire

You rise and walk out the door
Move on, shed your fears, let life go on
