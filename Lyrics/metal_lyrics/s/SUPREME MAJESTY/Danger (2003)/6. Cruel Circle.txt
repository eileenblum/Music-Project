Devoured by a beauty
Got no chance to escape
And a voice, calls from inside,
you can't run and hide
I'm keeping my distance
Don't want to intrude
Is it so, I'd rather not fall,
than risking it all

Love, will find a way to lead you astray
Making you cry and beg for mercy
Love, will eat your heart, aim its cruel dart
Make you let go, but do you really want to know

I'm trapped in a circle
Won't get out of this cage
I have reached the end of the line,
I'll make her heart mine

She looks and then smiles at me
Her words stabs and leaves me in agony

A feeling of anger
A feeling of pain
I reach out, freeing my mind,
and leave all behind

The world keeps on turning
This heart will stay strong
I'll go on, search for the one, 'til her heart is won
