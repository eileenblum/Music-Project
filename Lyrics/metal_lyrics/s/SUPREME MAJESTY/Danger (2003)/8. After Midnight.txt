My heart is on fire I'm burning
A storm in my mind
For all of your love I am yearning
All else left behind

Out of control, you make me whole,
I must surrender
Tonight, I'm letting it out
We're going to fly until tomorrow

You and me after midnight
You and me are one

We knew what our hearts were needing
Without no hope
I've tried to stay strong to the feeling
But now I can't cope

Oh, you lift me up, to the top,
of this existence
There's no end to it all
Let us try, living the fantasy

We're stuck in this cage of desire
We will not get out of this fight
Surrender your will to the fire
Let's do what feels right
