Into this world, without no fear
No one around to rely on
Daylight relieves, the secrets of tomorrow

Children will learn, hope will return
Guardians of hope will be stronger
Message from god, I will try to follow

You better listen to the preachers
Before the anger, and the rage takes over

No, there is no chance
When wind sweeps the land
Wipe out the footprints in the sand
Oh no, we'll never surrender
No, there is no chance
We will demand
We are the heroes of our lands
No, no, we'll never surrender

Seems like a dream, nothing will change
Shadows been hiding a danger
I will not rest, in presence of a stranger

I'm all alone, fearless I am
Angels won't cry any longer
Soldiers who die, only make me stronger

With all your thoughts and faith around you
We are not broken, hear the angels call you

Rising faith within you
Freedom, strength will need you

In need of some piece, movement of faith
Words from those priests were my saviour
Now I can sleep, beside my guardian angel

Here I was born and raised to fight
This is my land here will I live and die
