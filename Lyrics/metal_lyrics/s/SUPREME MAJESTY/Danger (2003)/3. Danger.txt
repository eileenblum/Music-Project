I've seen a sign, at the horizon
I've seen a dark shape in the midst
of night. You see the signs, but don't
believe them. Just heading forward
'til the end of time

Watching as the distrust, spreading its
disease. We're dancing with the devil's
whore. Our world have gone insane,
this time we've gone astray

Danger, danger
We've lost it somehow
Seems like we're strangers
No matter what I'm still in love

You turn away, and keep pretending
The blackened seeds we plant will cease
to grow. Our soothing words, disguised as
comfort. In truth we're aiming arrows at
our hearts

Nothing is forever, nothing will prevail
until end of time. I have to believe, we
can make it through. We have to see it
clearly, can't keep living on just day by day
Do you still believe, we can find a way

Danger, danger
We've lost it somehow
Seems like we're strangers
No matter what I'm still in love, with you
