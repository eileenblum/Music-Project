In times of trouble
When times are hard
That's when ambition makes its move

Plays out like clockwork
One simple rule
A simple trick
Just take your pick
The majority's all fools
And soon to lose their souls
Yes, soon they'll lose it all

Burn! Witches burn!
She's innocent
Burn! Witches burn!
When fear turns cruel
Burn! Witches burn!
But she's done nothing wrong
Burn! Witches burn!
You're all just fools

Tend to your own affairs
Stay out of this!
Burn! Witches burn!
Burn! Witches burn!

Tonight spells trouble
Tonight spells gloom
This rabble-rousing mayor speaks
And Caldwell town is doomed

Fear turned to frenzy
With torches held on high
I couldn't save her
There's no way she could hide

That night I lost my soul
That night I left it all
I left it all behind
I left to save my...
I left to wipe my...

Burn! Witches burn!
She's innocent
Burn! Witches burn!
When fear turns cruel
Burn! Witches burn!
But she's done nothing wrong
Burn! Witches burn!
You're all just fools

Tend to your own affairs
Stay out of this!
Burn! Witches burn!
Burn! Witches burn!
Burn! Witches burn!

I am and have always been innocent of that which you accuse me. Until now!
A curse upon you, Mr. Leibniz, sir.
Your children, your children's children and every child henceforth born in this town will be guilty of serious black magic.

Burn! Witches burn!
She's innocent
Burn! Witches burn!
When fear turns cruel
Burn! Witches burn!
But she's done nothing wrong
Burn! Witches burn!
You're all just fools

Tend to your own affairs
Stay out of this!
Burn! Witches burn!
Burn! Witches burn!
Burn! Witches burn!
Burn! Witches burn!
