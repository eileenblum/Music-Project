So many roads
So many choices in this life
So many wishes
And this hope that never dies
I never hesitate
I know it can be mine
And if I choose to be
A master of disguise

So many give their life
Without a second doubt
Too many die alone
Don't die without a fight
So many towers
But no wizards ride the skies
I'll take my chances with this ride
As long as I'm alive
As long as I'm alive

So many mean so well
But always do you harm
Too many die in vain
Why some will take up arms
I never hesitate
I know this life is mine
I'll tell you what I need
Without you I'll be fine

Too many grains of sand
And snakes hide in the grass
So many hours
And the walls are made of glass
I never hesitate
Don't care about the prize
I'll take my chances with this ride
As long as I'm alive
As long as I'm alive

And when the night comes down
It makes no difference
And when the night comes down
I stand my ground
As long as I'm alive

If you're still standing now
I guess you've got it made
Out of this camouflage
Out of this old charade
You've built your paradise
I've seen it so I know
Too many lives are lost
And plenty more to go

Don't sell me paradise
I know this heart of stone
Hell-bent on sacrifice
Leave me the hell alone
Too many hearts
Too many minds, too many doors
Too many question
And you've heard them all before
Too many broken wheels
Revolving ever more
Some never will decide
Some always seek control
I'll take my chances with this ride
As long as I'm alive
As long as I'm alive
