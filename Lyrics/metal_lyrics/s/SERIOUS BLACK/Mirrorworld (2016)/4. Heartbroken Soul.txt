Changing colors as I walk along the street
Just like last fall, I'm here
Can't imagine such a change of scenery
Would make a difference to me

And now I find
It all so strange
And not the way I thought it'd be

Can't deny
This summer is over
Can't you see I've just a
Heart-broken soul to give?
Tell you why
It's already over
I'm just another weary
Heart-broken soul

Hand in hand we made our way
Across the bridge
Now I'm here all alone
Can't deny the hurt inside
That love is gone
Pretending this choice was my own

Just another broken heart
Just another broken soul
Just another broken heart
In another, just another
In another broken mind

Can't deny
This summer is over
Can't you see I've just a
Heart-broken soul to give?
Tell you why
And over and over
I'm just another weary
Heart-broken soul

Find another broken heart
From another broken soul
Why can't you see I've just a
Heart-broken soul to give
To any other broken mind
And any other broken heart
I'm just another, weary,
Heart-broken soul
