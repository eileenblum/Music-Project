I see no shinning in your eyes
There is nothing we should hold in line
I've lost my key to your soul
We tried so hard to built our lives
On our dreams we dreamt in former times
But ended up in sorrow
All the feelings we ignore
I am broken, you're just cold
We'll never be the same again

What we've loved, what we've adored
Is dying from inside
I can't live this pain forever
All our memories, let it go
We cannot turn back time
We have lost this love forever
We're just dying hearts

Would there be a second chance
You and me could set the world on fire
No lies and hate would break us
We would die and fighting for
All our moments, still want more
This love would last forever
Is it time, for us to return?
To start over again?
One last breath, ready to fall
Awaiting for the dawn
To end this, now or never
