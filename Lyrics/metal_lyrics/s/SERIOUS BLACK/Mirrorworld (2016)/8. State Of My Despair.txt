Trade on your life inside
Buy everlasting lies
Find all you need tonight
Then hide inside that electric sky

We wantâWe needâYou'll find

Time enough to circle 'round the sun
Light enough to realize it's gone
When you find there's nothing left to buy
You stand aside, watch life pass by

I realize there's
Nothing can't be done
But time that's lost
Won't ever come back round
In this moment
I reflect a lifetime shown me
Now I know
The state of my despair

Now I know I'm not afraid to show
I'm breaking down inside
The cracks appear so clearly now
The framework of my life
comes crashing down tonight
It's time you know
The state of my despair

Give up on your dreams and call it love
Well, all I see's a world that's come undone
Before too long there's nothing left inside
You stand aside, watch life pass by

Despair under the sun
Is everything I've got
I have to change my ways
Now I know what I 've become
I see what I have done
My life was passing by

I realize there's
Nothing can be done
'Cause time that's lost
won't ever come back round

I'm not the only one
To find myself all
Broken up inside
The whole world is falling and now
The framework of your life
Comes crashing down
And now I know you know
The state of my despair
