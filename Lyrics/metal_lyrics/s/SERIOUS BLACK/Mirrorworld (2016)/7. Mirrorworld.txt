Can you tell me
The way this world disappoints you
And I will show you
The scenes behind that wall
And is the fabric they weave for you
Much too frail
Or way too dark?
Let me show you there's more
Oh, there's more

Is this all there is?
Have we made the grand last stand?
No more boundaries
No uncharted lands to explore
Has this journey
This grand transition
Made hollow what was whole?
Let me show you the door
Oh, there's more

Don't let go!
Don't let go!
I said don't let go
Don't let go!
Now let go!

Lost in a mirrorworld
That's all we ever were
Lost in a mirrorworld
Can't find the door
Let me out!
Lost in a mirrorworld
Don't leave me here
Get me out!
Hear my final words
Lost in a mirrorworld

You let go
I let go
You let go
Any second now
I let go
You let go
We let go
Now let go!
