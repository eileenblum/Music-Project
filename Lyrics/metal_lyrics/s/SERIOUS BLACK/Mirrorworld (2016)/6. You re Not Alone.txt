There's so much darkness in the world
Don't live in fear of death
He's not our master
No, just remind yourself
Your time on Earth is short
It's time for us to truly live

No second round
No heaven found
Except the one
Where we find love

This life is all we get to live
Don't you believe them
There's no god in heaven
No prize awaiting
No award for sacrifice
Still there's a reason to believe
In life like never before

'Cause there's a light
When you give love
It reaches deep inside
And so I'm never alone
When you give love
With all your heart
I give you all I am
And everything I can
You're not alone

Let's make a promise you and I
To never waste this life
To take our chances
Burning bridges
Tearing all defenses down
With open hearts we stand so tall
Never, ever, alone

'Cause there's a light
When you give love
It reaches deep inside
And so I'm never alone
When you give love
With all your heart
I give you all I am
And everything I can
You're not alone

'Cause there's a light
When you give love
It reaches deep inside
And so I'm never alone
When you give love
With all your heart
I give you all I am
And everything I can

'Cause there's a light
When you give love
It reaches deep inside
And so I'm never alone
When you give love
With all your heart
I give you all I am
And everything I can
You're not alone
