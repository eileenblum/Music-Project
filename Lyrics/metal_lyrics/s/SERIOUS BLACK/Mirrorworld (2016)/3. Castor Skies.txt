[Verse1:]
In our near distant future
Can you see such a thing?
I could dream of a dream
Filled with such wondrous things.

Well, it's surely imagined:
I'm a light to the moon,
And the Earth starts to roll
Lights out too soon.

[Pre-chorus:]
Where are you now?
Living your life on a sun-punished ground,
Tilling the land with the knocks of the plough?
Tell me, I'm dying to know.

[Chorus:]
Reaching out for Castor skies
We might ever never die.
Be the first ones out alive,
Don't you wonder?

What it's like to roam at night?
Endless wander, endless flight,
Be the first ones out tonight,
Don't you wonder?

[Verse2:]
So we gather our fortunes
Out of many machines,
And the day is to go
For these things I've seen.

Well, it's surely imagined
When the Sun burns the Moon.
Well, once leaving Earth
But a second too soon.

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Starlight, shadows,
Paint your face so everyone
(is) broadcasting dreams you have found.

[Chorus]
