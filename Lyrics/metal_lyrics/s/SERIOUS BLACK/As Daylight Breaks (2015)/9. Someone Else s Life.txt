[Bonus Track]You pull me in and hold me close
I can feel your beating heart
This pounding pain brings me back again
It's a constant race on your part

Please be kind we're out here alone
This life's the one constant I know
Given time and a true, open mind
You'll see how I live inside
And I can show you how

I turn reality away
So I can live another day
No matter where I turn
I'm leaving everything behind
And turn to dreams of every kind
Cause when I'm there
I'm not living someone else's life

To leave this world reflected in your eye
Can't wait another day
Can't you see? I'm not free
Reality imposed its will on me

Try facing life without a heartbeat
Try chasing demons of your own
Breaking in to close an open mind
To find you're trapped inside alone

I turn reality away
So I can live another day
No matter where I turn
I'm leaving everything behind
And turn to dreams of every kind
Cause when I'm there
I'm not living someone else's life

But here's the world again
Wave after wave of crushing pain
Wave after wave after wave
After wave after wave
