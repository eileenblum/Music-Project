Ten times the time it took
To open up my mind
Is the time I've lived without myself
As I let the inside out
And now I see me everywhere
Yet every time I turn
The mirror changes faces
And the faces always tell me

You dream - you hurt
Life is twice divided
We live and yearn
To fill the void inside
You dream to learn fate is undecided
But live and learn
Nothing's on your side

Some say I had it coming all along
Some says it's everywhere and nothing's ever wrong
My mystic mind twists my dreams and turns
Tells me I will burn
Tells me I will burn

Ten times the madness grows
And it beckons all along
Familiar faces everywhere
But their names are all so wrong
I love the word "intention"
An extension of the soul
And though I find I'm losing mine
I intend to save you all

You dream - you hurt
Life is twice divided
We live and yearn
To fill the void inside
You dream to learn fate is undecided

Some say I had it coming all along
Some says it's everywhere and nothing's ever wrong
My mystic mind twists my dreams and turns
Tells me I will burn
Tells me I will burn

Some say I had it coming all along
Some says it's everywhere and nothing's ever wrong
My mystic mind twists my dreams and turns
Tells me I will burn
Twists my dreams and turns
Tells me I will burn...
