Come share the night with me and dream of home
Alive at least a nightmare ending
Somewhere in the darkness there's a place for us
Distant past, forgotten future
Waiting now to

Talk to you talk to you
Today you open your mind
And hear it talk to you
This storm is yours to find
Let it talk to you
Listen to the storm

Stay listen to the storm inside of me
When I'm alone it rages strong
And I'm afraid there's something wrong I can't make right
Listen to the storm and tell me
I can talk to

Talk to you talk to you
Today you open your mind
And hear it talk to you
This storm is yours to find
Let it talk to you
Listen to the storm

Somewhere in the darkness there's a place for us
Listen to the storm then brave the dark
No one lives forever yet you carry on
Night after night after night after night until dawn

Somewhere in the darkness there's a place for us
Listen to the storm then brave the dark
No one lives forever yet you carry on
Night after night after night after night

Somewhere in the darkness there's a place for us
Listen to the storm then brave the dark
No one lives forever yet you carry on
Night after night after night after night
Night after night after night after night
