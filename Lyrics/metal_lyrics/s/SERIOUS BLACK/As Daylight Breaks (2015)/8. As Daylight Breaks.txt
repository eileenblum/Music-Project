I'm sorry dear
I know I've failed you once again
Tell me what's this truth
That can't be told?
I can't go on

It is not what it used to be
It's just life you know I've lost the dream
The feeble fire of a broken soul
Life expires it flickers in the cold

All this seems so never ending
Drifting with the wind
The writing's on the wall
As daylight breaks
A thousand fallen angels
Shed their tears in vain
Against the wind the march goes on

When I'm alone
I cry and hope that you're ok
I know what I should do
But always fail
Words won't help you
And the guilt is mine to bear
I see my bitter end my love
This love won't change

And as the days grow dark
As hope gives way to night
A darkness settles over me
Just one shred left of light
This love...

All this seems so never ending
Whispers on the wind
The writings on the wall
As daylight breaks
A thousand fallen angels
Spread their wings and soar
Into the wind till they fall

And feel the fire
Burning in their souls
To find desire
A treasure in the cold

All this seems so never ending
Whispers in the wind
The writings on the wall
As daylight breaks
A thousand fallen angels
Spread their wings and sing
Of hope that soars
As daylight breaks
