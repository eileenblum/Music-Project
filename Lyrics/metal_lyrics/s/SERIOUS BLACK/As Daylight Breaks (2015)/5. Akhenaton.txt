Rising in the desert a temple of the sun
I am forgiving so come to me
City in the sun
Dancing shadows stir the night
Powers move and shift
And I'll rise again

With the passing of time
Like the ever-breathing Nile
I shall rise again
Like the stars, the moon, the sun
When all seasons come undone
I shall rise again

Lift your eyes and see I hold the blackened sky
To wake the sun and welcome morning
And when you see the magic light brings to your eyes
You know I was - I am and, oh, I shall become I shall become

With the passing of time
Like the ever-breathing Nile
I shall rise again
Like the stars, the moon, the sun
When all seasons come undone
I shall rise again

Tell me you're the son of the sun
Tell me you're the son of the sun
Tell me you're the son of the sun
Akhenaton
