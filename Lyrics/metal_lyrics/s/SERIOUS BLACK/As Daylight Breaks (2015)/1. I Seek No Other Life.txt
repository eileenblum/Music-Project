No promises hold me now
No time and no place is announced
The thousands that worry how
They're simply obsessed with their plans

Inside the walls come down
Outside the rains fall down

I've told you a thousand times
The time and the place must be now
My friend, let's not worry how
We simply let rip at their plans

Inside the walls come down
Outside the rains fall down

I live today
I live tonight
I stand alone and I alone decide what's right
So when tonight has come
Just when the hunt is on
I seek no other life

No promises hold me now
No time and no place is announced
My friend, let's not worry how
We simply let rip at their plans

Inside the walls come down
Outside the rains fall down

I live today
I live tonight
I stand alone and I alone decide what's right
So when tonight has come
Just when the hunt is on
I seek no other life
