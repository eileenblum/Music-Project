Out in the desert the sun and burning sand
I left your message now I hold out both my hands
As you just shake your head I know it's understood
You never listen but I say I think you should

Some lie! Some lie! Cover up a trail of murder
This operation so bold yet still sublime
Around - around, tailor-made to suit your purpose
Don't believe what you've been told
We've nothing left at all

Stone cold and reckless messiah's burning land
I got your message got it holed up in my hands
It's all just shake 'n' bake I hope it's understood
Some never listen but I say I think you should

Some lie! Some lie! Cover up a trail of murder
This operation so bold yet still sublime
Around - around tailor-made to suit your purpose
Don't believe what you've been told
We've nothing left at all

Shards and splinters in my soul
Bloody trail of murder still
You think you're in control
But this trail goes further
