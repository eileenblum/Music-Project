Tell me what I see here
Cause I'm lost
Looking for a future
For a time I saw it clearly
And we nearly had it all
But now it's gone
And I can see us failing

They've been watching
They've been waiting
They've been biding their time

So when the lights go out you'd better run
Nothing you can do here son just run
Live to fight another day tomorrow
Fight for all you're worth, but now you run
Somewhere down the line you'll find the one
Somewhere in the past you find the order
Setting fire setting fire to the earth

There's no time, believe me
But I'm here back in time to help you
There's a time to make a statement
There's a time to set things straight

They've been watching
They've been waiting
They've been biding their time

So when the lights go out you'd better run
Nothing you can do here son just run
Live to fight another day tomorrow
Fight for all you're worth, but now you run
Somewhere down the line you'll find the one
Somewhere in the past you find the order
Setting fire setting fire to the earth
