You and I we're worlds apart
But here we are
Like a night awaiting storm
We know we are
Meant to walk beside the beast
With hollow hearts
Left to brave a night of stars

Trailing behind I kept eye on a sky
Painted in tears and the blood of the fallen
Line after line of this endless detail
Facing the storm of the dreams they have stolen

Follow them blindly, you'll die
This night will decide where our company lies
Follow them blindly you'll die

Sealing my fate I volunteer and now I drift among the stars
They said they'd meet us here to turn the final key

Silent we glide through this star-studded night
Facing the years and the paths we have chosen
Night after night and we know it prevails
Line after line and the faces are frozen

Follow them blindly, you'll die
This night will decide where our company lies
Follow them blindly you'll die

Sealing my fate I volunteer and now I drift among the stars
They said they'd meet us here to turn the final key

Follow them blindly, you'll die
This night will decide where your destiny lies
