[Bonus Track]Once your world was a happy place
Thought you knew what it would bring
Every part of you every single play
There were million ways to win

I saw the tears in your eyes my love
As you threw your cards away
Oh, the pain you're in the stakes went up
As your heart got in the way

And I say ride out, ride free

Fly on like you own the sky
You can ride upon the wind
Fly on like the eagle, fly
Ever higher on the wind

But once the sorrow fades
And your pain is tucked away
Think your world can wear another face
You might as well just stay

And you marvel at the star-lit sky
As we gaze into the night
At this moment I feel lost in time
I just hope we got it right

And I say take heart, take me 

Fly on like you own the sky
You can ride upon the wind
Fly on like the eagle, fly
Ever higher on the wind

Fly on like you own the sky
You can ride upon the wind
Fly on like the eagle, fly
Ever higher on the wind
