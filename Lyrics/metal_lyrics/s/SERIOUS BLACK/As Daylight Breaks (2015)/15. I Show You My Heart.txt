[Bonus Track]We sail the seas of madness
Stand silent in the sun
We harmonize with downcast eyes
An hour less to last

What's haunting me - this hollow man
So shallow, so hard, so pale
Asking me what I would be
If only I could have my way

I'm surprised to find you standing here
Like a siren in the storm
You say that I alone can't try to set it right
So like a sentenced man I run
All too sure that what's been said can't be undone

We sail the seas of madness
Stand silent in the sun
We harmonize with downcast eyes
We harmonize

I show you my heart, take it apart
Lay it all out for you to chart
There's a world in there, can you see it?
Every detail, every part?

I show you my heart, take it apart
Lay it all out for you to chart
There's a world in here, can you see it?
Can't let two worlds fall apart
I show you my heart

The time I know is now
So I share with you my past
To freely speak what's on my mind
from the status of our prime
To the mysteries of a million misheard rhymes

We sail the seas of madness
Stand silent in the sun
We harmonize with downcast eyes
We harmonize

I show you my heart, take it apart
Lay it all out for you to chart
There's a world in there, can you see it?
Every detail, every part?

I show you my heart, take it apart
Lay it all out for you to chart
There's a world in here, can you see it?
Can't let two worlds fall apart

I show you my heart, take it apart
Lay it all out for you to chart
There's a world in there, can you see it?
Every detail, every part?

I show you my heart, take it apart
Lay it all out for you to chart
There's a world in there
Can't let two worlds fall apart
I show you my heart

Show you my heart
