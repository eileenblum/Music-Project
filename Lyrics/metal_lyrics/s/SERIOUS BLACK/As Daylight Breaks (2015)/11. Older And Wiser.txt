Don't like society?
Then you can't help but see
You've rabid dogs upon your heels
Not feeling like the rest?
Just take another test
Gauge each emotion that you feel

Keep in mind
9 out of 10 ain't bad

Trapped in bureaucracy
Or lost in ecstasy?
No matter which I'm sure you'll yearn
To learn that heresy
And acts of god and me
Are machinations of this world

Keep in mind
9 out of 10 ain't bad

What do you do when all that's coming down on you
Says that you're older - you're older
And every day you see the lines on every face
And you feel older but none the wiser

Enraged by apathy cold hearts in atrophy
A generation quite disturbed
The iron curtain fell now life's a private hell
Perpetually unperturbed

Keep in mind
9 out of 10 ain't bad

What do you do when all that's coming down on you
Says that you're older - you're older
And every day you see the lines on every face
And you feel older but none the wiser

Tell me it's true - why don't you
Tell me it's true as we grow older
We should grow bolder
Tell me it's true 'cause I would love to be like you
Older and wiser, too
