I have feared life enough to hide in sorrow
I have lived most my life inside my mind
I always thought there'd be time come tomorrow
I'd find you friend and to this end I'd start my life and go
High and low, high and low

Now I'm here life is clearly light and shadow
Nothing can stop me from leaving now
The darkness starts to fade
Now I'm told there's no tomorrow
Nowhere left to go, nowhere left to go

High and low

You can be given too much time
I may be leaving soon but I'm sure to remember
You can believe me when I say
No one will listen when you pray
No one receiving

High and low
