I am sound asleep tonight empty whiskey bottlesfullmoon casts it's rays
Through my open windows curtains move slighty like stirred by a breeze
A fleeting shadow enters furtively cold air fondles my skin frightening yet
Pleasing unclear sobs shape to a female voice she speaks to me in sweetest
Tongues her unpure whispers ravish my soul in perdating tunes uttered by the
Evil syren before the sailor gets lostin vicious sighs moaned by perfidious
Statues before the wanderer turns to stone oh how I already know those
Words I have been waiting for your infamous chants how sweet they sound
To my ears chastly and seductive perfume of poisonous flowers I was longing
For your shadow summoning your thirsty ghost desiring your presence
Unblurred to absorb the blood from my veins I was yearning for your hungry
Lips to drink from me till my wounds are unbleedind and let me be the prey
Of my mistress
