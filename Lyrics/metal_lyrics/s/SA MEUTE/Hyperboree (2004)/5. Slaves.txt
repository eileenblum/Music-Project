I push the prisoner to escape to seek for a better prison
The desperate to get away with a rope and try his luck
Again I replace dictatorship with tyranny change anarchy
For chaos quit a master for a mistress drop gods for
the tormenting void I am the sand grain in well oiled
Sysems the so-called margin of error the virus in the
body of community A sailing backwards towards the
Wind instinctive however few feel my heat I am the
Flame of rebellion and sabotage that smoulders and
Burns in the hearts of those who strive for freedom
Slaves ! A liberty with no guard no clear way shown
No guide a total freedom of total war where only the
Strong survive it is that fire that distinguishes persecuted
Wolves from the zombie slaves it is the scoria from
Hell's furnaces that from the cradle mark Lucifer's
Children doomed to see black where others see white
I'm Don Quichotte fighting the wind mills for imbecility
Triumphs and exults and each day gains more disciples
Sailing backwards towards the wind instinctive however
Few fell my heat I am the flame of rebellion and
Sabotage that smoulders and burns
In the hearts of those who strive for freedom
