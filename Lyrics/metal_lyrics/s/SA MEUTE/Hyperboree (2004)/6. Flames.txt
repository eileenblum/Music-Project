My Dryness is infinite more and more I feel the solitude of roaming between
The same old stones of my walls wich I know inside out yet can not leave
Mournful is my immured existence in this withering fortress barricaded by
Immense unfertile forests the woebegone winds that once were murmurs are
Now endlessly assaulting my eaglenest in irritating howlings
Waouuuuuuuaouuuuuwa seasons follow seasons bringing moroseness and
Wrath only the sight of blood and sound of pain can make me laugh
Someone else is knocking at my cyclopean door outside the red death kills
The rich as well as the poor then in the leaden hours of the black night !
Contemplate a very old painting depicting a sunrise over my very mountains
In flaming colours that I have once seen that I have once seen and
Forgotten since long gone is the craftsman who could attend to the flashing
Gold sky seeming to fucking ablaze the trees and set the whole planet on
Fire the arson scene was hastily seized from the top of some old tower the
Wolrd in flames for sure is the pyromaniac's last fire the world's been raped
And killed and burnt yet still I am not dead I don't really know where I'm
But there it's me the head is it real or is it all just happening in my mind
Standing on the ashes of what used to be my kind
