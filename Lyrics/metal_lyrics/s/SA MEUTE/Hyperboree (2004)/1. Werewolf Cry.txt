I am of the race of those nuts who every lunary month access for a two nights to the throne of madness as almighty sovereigns and rulers of the dark in the gloaming.
I wander in the midst of the doleful moor.
WAAAAAAAOUUUAAAAOUUUAAAA.
Waiting for the painful pleasures of spasmodic metamorphosis and a thousand demons to invade my body and unroot my angel soul to give me the strength of ten and provide me with the cosmic powers.
Tonight is moon of madness bright and full.
She will rise from the east and with her will arise eerie howlings from everywhere so sharp will become my ears that
I will hear my consanguineous brothers cry.
A werewolf crying to the moon.
A werewolf crying to the moon.
Choking with anger.
I am transforming nails and murderous claws hair is monstrous fur my jaws are those of a beast.
My teeth are fiendish daggers.
Feeling no compassion but
I did not anyway.
All my memories gone like ashes with the winds.
My nostrils are tracking the smell of human flesh.
My nostrils are tracking the smell of human flesh.
As I enter the world of sempiternal blood thirst.
As I enter the world of blood thirst.
Eternal glory to the moon.
A werewolf crying to the moon.
A werewolf crying to the moon.
Eternal glory to the moon.
A werewolf crying to the moon.
