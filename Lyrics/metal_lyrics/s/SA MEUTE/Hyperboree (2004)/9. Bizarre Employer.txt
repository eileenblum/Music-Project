Anchor is Weighed my vessel departs from, the shore down
There amidst oblong boxes and rats I'm lying in the
Darkness of the hold my presence unsuspected from the
Crew who carried me on board yesternight speaking about
The bizarre employer they've never seen him know not
Who he is the contrast is to ship his fucking boxes who
The hell knows why they're filled with bloody earth but
One casket contains not of his native soil... Master on
The land I'm still master on the seas provoking finest
Weather storm or disease a pact with mighty Mefisto has
Made me what I am in times when lives were lived with
My blood I signed my name I initialized the clause of the
Pact from wich one cannot retract unbelievable small
Letters something about my soul's ownership...
