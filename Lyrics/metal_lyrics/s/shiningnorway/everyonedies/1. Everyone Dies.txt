You still alive
I've been waiting for you
You take my hand
Come and let me show you

Hold onto your soul
Midnight strikes and skin goes cold
Time stops
The end unfurls
Let me take you to the underworld

You, you
Can you see that nothing ever lasts
Do, do
What you need 'cause life is fading way too fast
'Cause, baby, everything dies
Baby, that's a fact
Doesn't matter what you do
You don't come back

Everything dies
Yeah, a fact's a fact
Gotta take it to the edge
And don't look back

Now it's us again
Listen to the echo
Knuckles white as snow
Don't look down and don't let go

Through the darkest night
Travel at the speed of fright
Now six feet below
Off to where the boatman rows

You, you
Can you see that nothing ever lasts
Do, do
What you need 'cause life is fading way too fast
'Cause, baby, everything dies
Baby, that's a fact
Doesn't matter what you do
You don't come back

Everything dies
Yeah, a fact's a fact
Gotta take it to the edge
And don't look back

Come to the light
Come to the glow
And I'll never let go

You see how they shine?
Drowned in the glow
Hold on to my hand
Can you hear how they cry? Cry? Cry?
When you're letting go

Don't die
Don't die
Don't let go
No, no, no

You see everything dies
Baby, that's a fact
Doesn't matter what you do

Everything dies
Yeah, a fact's a fact
Let's take it to the edge
And don't look back

Everything dies
Everything dies
Everything dies
Everything dies

'Cause, baby, everything dies
Baby, that's a fact
Let's make it to the edge
And don't look back

Take it to the edge
And don't look back
