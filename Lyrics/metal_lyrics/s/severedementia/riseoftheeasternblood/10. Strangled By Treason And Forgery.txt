[Severe Dementia - Epitaph Of Plassey]

With delight, that's not noble
Aided by the betrayed humanity
The conspirators beam
Took the Bengal, by Treachery
Must be the son of fiend

The march towards Plassey
In every doable way
The end of the last independent

The needs to imprison Bengal alive,
They drooled like serpents
The patio of Bastard sons, the vessels of death
Rise against slavery, Rise against blasphemy
Rise against faggotry, The backstabbers

He won it by promoting treason and forgery
British rule in India had an unsavory beginning

A great prince was dependent, on my pleasure
An opulent city lay at my mercy
He won it by promoting treason and forgery
British rule in India had an unsavory beginning

Its richest bankers, bid against each other for my smiles
I walked through vaults which were thrown open
Piled on either hand with gold and jewels
He won it by promoting treason and forgery

With delight, that's not noble
Aided by the betrayed humanity
The conspirators beam
Took the Bengal, by Treachery
Must be the son of fiend

Rise against slavery, Rise against blasphemy
Rise against faggotry, The backstabbers
