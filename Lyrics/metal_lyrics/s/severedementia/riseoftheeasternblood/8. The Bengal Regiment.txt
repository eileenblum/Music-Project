[Severe Dementia - Epitaph Of Plassey]

Slay them in the name of Bengal
Slay them in the name of Loyalty
Slay them in the name of Purity
Slay them in the name of Bengal

What sayest thou o Siraj?
Shall you provide thou justice thou reign?
Shall thou spare them who commit us to the flames?
The arsenal

May their flags thaw in the Bengal cannonade
May their ashes be scattered all around Plassey
May Monsieur Sinfray grind their bones

O Man of the Artillery
Open the onslaught against the Firingi
I witness the aloofness of the Bishash Ghatok Mir Jafar

Thou hath stood at a distance
Thy summoning the embittered Jafar
Retort you dare not

Let there be chains on thou arms
Let there be shackles on thou neck
Let there be chains on thou arms

Bishash Ghatok Jaf-fuck-ar Ali Khan

In the heat of the work of carnage,
Whilst victory and triumph were
Visible on the side of the Bengal regiment...

Valiant Mir Madan fell on
A vindictive cannon grasps thy right hand
Thy men, let the corpse of the martyr be carried into the tents

I march ahead and slit their throats
Throats of those who dreamt of enslaving my Bengal
Marching gallantly, gushing recklessly
The blood of infested Firingi fags

Thou hath stood at a distance
Thy summoning the embittered Jafar
Thou hath stood at a distance
Thy summoning, Madar Chod Jafar

Slay them in the name of...

I march ahead blindfolded
Slashing them wide open
Suddenly heavens laughed upon me
They jammed my mortars
