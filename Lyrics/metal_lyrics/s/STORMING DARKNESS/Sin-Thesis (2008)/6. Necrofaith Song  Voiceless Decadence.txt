[L./M.: Sinpreacher]

I don't remember previous life
My found existence is lighted other light
This star is engulfed by the ugly space
Night of collapse, delirium of necrofaith
I go by the nameless path of deprivations and impassivity
Life a blind which deprived of eyes himself
To never see, but to stay
Under your spell forever
You sounds on the stings of madness
By the piercing melodies of suffocating abyss
And the flesh turned in ruins of melancholy
And sorrows pour into blasphemy
Breathe of Night... eternal narcosis...
Fate of precipice is discerned in thousand fera vortex
Damned triumph don't grow silent here
Song of necrofaith...
Message of inevitable temptation
You are my lie, you are my truth
