[L.: Sinpreacher, M.: Sinpreacher, Sabledoom]

Crimson tongue of doom sunset greedily lies horizons
Earth is still cold...
Life envious loop of the hungry graves
Into infinity of coming black night

Lead shroud of cold is a precursor of beginning
Wounds open for arrival of my legions
For Sabbath at black night of soul
World is crowned by demonic obscurity

In the spiral vortexes of Aeon
Dark archetype of boundless Will
in the great formation
Dragon's orgasm will give a seed
Let gardens of devastation will rise
With flowers of sin and flame

Fire will bring Darkness
Where God is hidden
Summit of eschatological manifestation
Impertinent incest between Sun and Moon
Eclipse of gods - awakening of
Black night of soul

Black night of soul
