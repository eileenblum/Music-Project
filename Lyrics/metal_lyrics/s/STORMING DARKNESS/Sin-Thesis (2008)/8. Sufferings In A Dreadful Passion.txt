[L.: Sinpreacher, M.: Sabledoom]

Through the blood, through the essence
Essence of Sin
Open the sufferings in freadful passion
Pathological dreams will turn out
by Lilith's love

Cold gaze of your beauty
I'll satisfy a sorrow in eternity that dies in you

Unknown emotions pierce life the knives
Escalation of dark force, sublimation of fear
Ecstatic perception of unity with essence...
Cacophonous symphony of fate

Your sacral lust
Reality become bare in chaos of your speech

Look at these deep wounds, they don't bleed anymore
Just sepulchral haze is around
Hellish dogs will be leaders here
In this dominion of emptiness, mighty emptiness

Through the law of god
Through the essence of imperishable truth
Here is no nothing
Here is SATAN
