[L.: Sinpreacher, M.: Sabledoom]

Weaved of worms
At the flaming gates of the lust sun
Sunset is blacker and blacker
What is caressed by a tongue of Leviathan

Eaten by the spawns of the lowest dimensions
disease is deeper and deeper
Ulcers of bottomless wounds
Emit the sulphuric exhalations

Weaved of worms
In the woods of a morbid solitude
Total holocaust landscapes
More terrific and closer

Buried in the belly of untime
What is nourished by obscure souls
There, where was a life...
No nothing, except of filth and despair

Weaved of worms
Dead forever
Black putrefaction
Satan's carrion
