[L.: Sinpreacher, M.: Sabledoom]

Endless Mother!
You listen to the hissing of Serpent
I accepted your gifts of inmost cold and hatred
Blood in my veins carries venomous message of Horns
Mutilated by horror of Abyss ... in monolith of Death
You are in my prayers

Pain! I behold your madness in my wounds
I feel vibrations of Hell in my convulsions
My Night is coming...
Mother - Night

Return through the life, return to Death
Perfect ritual of destruction
Experience of black disease
Fall into bosom of absolute enslavement

Memory decayed
In circle of black depressive winds
Prayer is fathomless
Chalice full of divine presence
Prayer is Night
Die with me and...
Return to Mother-Night
