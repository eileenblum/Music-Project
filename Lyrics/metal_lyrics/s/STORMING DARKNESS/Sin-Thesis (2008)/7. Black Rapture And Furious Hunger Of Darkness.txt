[L.: Sinpreacher, M.: Sabledoom]

Living human carrion!
My values amounts to your corpses
Black rapture rising!
From the depths of eternal triumph of plague

Day is strangled by deep sunset
Souls in the dead dreams
swarm life worms
Bodies in the lustful waiting of salvation
Ashes of reality... ashes of memories

Listen to my preaching!
Malign postulates  - seeds of the dreadful sickness
Gospel of Omega!
Destroy all your fears, found the true Horror!

Share my black rapture!
Featureless sacrifices of world of sorrow
Taste the curse of fallen ones
Legion of christened ones by furious hunger of Darkness!

In the name of unholy Spirit!
Symbols of Hell shine in the universal blackness
Eternity blazes by the flames of truth
Inexhaustible light of Master!

Black rapture and furious hunger of darkness
Black rapture and furious hunger of darkness
Black rapture and furious hunger of darkness

In the name...
Symbols of Hell...
Inexhaustible light...
We are buried in him...
