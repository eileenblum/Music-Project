This is a dying world,
Filled with a dying breed,
Every choice, Guilty pleasure
My heart to find the need
We come with tongues like fire
To heal a broken land
We bow a generation devoted to no man

Bow to your knees,
We are no disease
Bow to your knees!

[CHORUS:]
My God, my God these nails are leaving scars
I'd tear down the sky but just to find your heart
I'm so afraid of what my hearts become 
I'm staring down the barrel of a loaded gun.

Leaders will fall, Leaders will rise
We won't take their compromise
Every choice Guilty Pleasure,
I'm crying out on my knees
We come with tongues like fire
To heal this broken lan.
We bow a generation,
Devoted to no man.

My Flesh is weak
But my spirit is strong!

THESE KNEES WILL BOW TO NO MAN.
