What will happen next?
Will the house burn down?
Or will it fade away?

I was born on the 13th
Haven't you noticed?
The angels has forsaken me

Run away
Don't you stop
Get as far away
As you can - Away from me

Run away
Don't you stop
Get as far away
As you can - Away from me
Everyone I touch
Starts to feel the fear
Or starts to feel the pain

Don't get close to me
I'm the devil in disguise
Just run away

I'm constantly in fear
Fear of losing you
So don't get close - Just run away

Run away
Don't you stop
Get as far away
As you can - Away from me
Run away
Don't you stop
Get as far away
As you can - Away from me

I'm constantly in fear
Fear of losing you
So don't get close - Just run away now

I'm constantly in fear
Fear of losing you
So don't get close - Just run away

Run away
Don't you stop
Get as far away
As you can - Away from me
(Don't get close - Just run away now)
Run away
Don't you stop
Get as far away
As you can - Away from me
(Don't get close - Just run away now)
