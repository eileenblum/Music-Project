Could this be the end of my heartache?
It even haunts me while I'm awake
I would never forsake

Will you break this fortress inside of me?
Will you make a stand or let it be?
Will you break me free?

Is this an ordinary story?
Will it ever turn a page?

Silence Broken - Can you hear the beat of my heart?
You have broken the defence to my heart
You make it beat like it was made of fire
Look into my eyes - I'll never say goodbye

Who would've ever thought infatuation would break my fall?
It struck me like a concrete-wall
You broke the defence to my heart
I'll never tell you lies
Never leave you behind
I'll be right by your side
Break my fortress now

Will she keep going through the night?
Now that she have me in her sight
I want to feel her fire light

Break this iron-cage to set me free
Look into my eyes - There is no goodbyes
I'll never say goodbye

Is this an ordinary story?
Will it ever turn a page?
Silence Broken - Can you hear the beat of my heart?
You have broken the defence to my heart
You make it beat like it was made of fire
Look into my eyes - I'll never say goodbye

Who would've ever thought infatuation would break my fall?
It struck me like a concrete-wall
You broke the defence to my heart
I'll never tell you lies
Never leave you behind
I'll be right by your side
Break my fortress now

Nothing that's worth having comes easy
And it's like the way they say
If there's a will there's a way

Silence Broken - Can you hear the beat of my heart?
You have broken the defence to my heart
You make it beat like it was made of fire
Look into my eyes - I'll never say goodbye

Silence Broken - Can you hear the beat of my heart?
You have broken the defence to my heart
You make it beat like it was made of fire
Look into my eyes - I'll never say goodbye

I'll never say goodbye
