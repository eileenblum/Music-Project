[feat. Richard Sjunnesson From The Unguided]Welcome to the apathy within
A washed up vessel free from sin
Alone on his throne
DEAD AND GONE

Call us a product
Label us a fraud
You half-assed conduct
TELL ME WHO WE ARE

Simplistic addict
Cheap gimmicks is part of the fad
Erase every trace
COVER ME IN ASH

WE WON'T GIVE IN TO YOU
WE WON'T DIE FOR YOU
WE WON'T GIVE IN TO YOU
WE WON'T DIE FOR YOU

And it feels like
There's nothing wrong
BUT I AM ON THE VERGE OF BREAKING DOWN
You'll see that
I'm still undone
DYING AND TRYING FOR FAR TO LONG OH

Blend it - Mend it - Can't fucking stand it
Every step of the way is pitiful

So upset the balance and make it
STOP

Paint the past on my skin
To incite the prototype
Tearin' it away with my nails and teeth
AFRAID OF WHAT'S BENEATH

Maybe it's just a phase
Becoming a new-born traitor
That feeds on the popular shit
THEY CATER

WE WON'T GIVE IN TO YOU
WE WON'T DIE FOR YOU
WE WON'T GIVE IN TO YOU
WE WON'T DIE FOR YOU

And it feels like
There's nothing wrong
BUT I AM ON THE VERGE OF BREAKING DOWN

You'll see that
I'm still undone
DYING AND TRYING FOR FAR TO LONG NOW

When I close my eyes I watch the whole world bleed
The ghosts in my veins abhor my every deed

The ruins in me - Built by my insecurities
I lost myself years ago - In the darkness down below

Can you hear me? Can you hear this cry for help?
I'm drowning in my dismay - I can't find my way

I can't find my way...
I CAN'T FIND MY WAY OUT

And it feels like
There's nothing wrong
BUT I AM ON THE VERGE OF BREAKING DOWN

You'll see that
I'm still undone
DYING AND TRYING FOR FAR TO LONG NOW

And it feels like
There's nothing wrong
BUT I AM ON THE VERGE OF BREAKING DOWN

You'll see that
I'm still undone
DYING AND TRYING FOR FAR TO LONG NOW
