Mine is not to reason why,
It's just to do or die
Running from the insanity
Time passes by...

Stalking down the enemy
On our life depends
Compassion ends
Not all are fortunate to get through the day
Some passes away
Endless insanity is what they find
Soldiers of Misfortune, life is so unkind

These haunting memories
Can't be erased of human waste
Not all are fortunate
Death always near
Taken by fear
Endless insanity is what they find,
Soldiers of misfortune just wait for time
To damn their mins
These men are killing blind

Mine is not to reason why,
It's just to do or die

Memories will never leave
After the wars end,
He must give in to madness in him
He can't escape
It is too late
Ruthless insanity coming with time
Can't see his future,
Mentally blind
A damaged mind
This world is so unkind

Soldiers of misfortune
