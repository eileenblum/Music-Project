As I lay back and look to the night sky,
New realms become visible to my eyes
When I return back to reality,
I wonder what is right to believe

Waking to a new day and it's fate,
Facing this world, breeding hate

A storm in the silence

Gazing into the glass screen of doom,
Depression sets in, destruction looms

A storm in the silence

To sacrifice my sanity would kill me
Room to breathe to set myself free

A storm roars around my brain
Silence within keeps me sane
I must escape to deal with life
A change in the world eludes my sights

A storm in the silence
