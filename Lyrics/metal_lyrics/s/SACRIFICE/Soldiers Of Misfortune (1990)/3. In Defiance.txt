In defiance to you
Your nightmares are coming true
Gain at the expense of me
Nothing in your life will ever come free

Parasite who is full of praise
Fuck your deceptive ways
The beliefs that you hold
Help you accomplish useless, futile goals

You cannot be trusted
I watch your plans unfold
How long will it be before you sell away my soul
In defiance we will take you away
To a place where you never
See the light of the day

Victims of your senseless greed
We must all take heed
We are not slaves to your world
Your ideas of life are nothing but absurd
