Looking across the giza plateau of sand
The tombs of the kings on the horizon they stand
All meanings have been lost through
Winds of ancient time
Why did they leave us this monumental sign?
The kingdom of the dead conceals the mystery

All meanings lost through times antiquity
Concealment of intention, arcane faces of stone
Dissension will uncover the knowledge,
Lost unknown

Lost through time

The mystique behind the Egyptian desert
The answers remain locked away
The stone prism of the skies
Shines as the sunlight descends

Descending lights scorch the plains
Returning kings back to reclaim
