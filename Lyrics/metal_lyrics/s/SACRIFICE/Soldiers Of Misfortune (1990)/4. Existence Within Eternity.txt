Messages sent are intercepted in
Trance-like states
Deciphering transmissions relating
To our fate
Gazing into starlight brings undertainty
To our minds
What lies beyond the demise of mankind
Eternal souls will be there be existence within eternity

Outrider, riding out beyond the astral sphere
Lost souls communicate,
The solution is near
Answers to our questions exist within eternity
Supernatural dreams deny our mortality

In dream states we see a light in the black
A foresight beyond the life we know
Through darkness we see infinity

Only the flesh will die
The body of light will leave
The truth will be told
Existence within eternity

Immortality beyond the wall
Impassable in life
Eternity
