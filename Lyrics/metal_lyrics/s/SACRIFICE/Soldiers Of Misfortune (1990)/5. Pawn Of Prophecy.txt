Trapped in life with peace of mind,
Leaving the past behind
Destiny has been planned if born again
Relevations sets your fear, armageddons near
A mental crutch, a resisting hype,
To end your life

Evangelize the population,
Send in mind deception
Contribute to sow the seeds,
And his greed
Prophecize catastrophe,
Control the pawn of prophecy
Dishonesty will bring you down,
Firebound

Pawn of prophecy, life is fading away
Leaving you in dismay

At dawn the bells ring summoning me
I cannot live my life following this prophecy

Senility, easy prey, your mind fades away
Feeding off your sickly state, it's too late
Crushing all your shattered dreams,
Things are not as they seem
Robbed of all your dignity,
Now you're free

Pawn of prophecy, life is fading away
Leaving you in dismay
