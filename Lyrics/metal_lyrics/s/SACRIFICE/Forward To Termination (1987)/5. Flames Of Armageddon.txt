[I. The Resurrection]

Again I can breathe, have not seen the light for years
My spirit has wandered, instilling human fears
Brought back to bring forth misery
Watch me as I arise from the sea

Wear my mark, give me your hand
Follow me by revelation's plan
Evil reborn, the demon seed
Once again, I have been freed

[II. Manipulated by Will]

With power to control I grasp all the weak
Twenty-four elders are who I seek
The fourth angel scorches with his fire
Follow me by revelations plan

Wear my mark, give me your hand
Follow me by revelation's plan
Evil reborn, but nothing is gained
All is scorched by Armageddons flame

[III. The Nazare Awakes]

Visions fill my eyes, holy rebirth it seems
His return from the skies, phantasmagorial dreams

I abjure baptism, your faith depletes
All in fear of these words I speak

[IV. Armageddon]

The two-edged sword brings my demise
The end brought by the one I despise
A one hundred year reign, the abyss still burns
The battle not over, I will return

Earth is now infernal land
Scorched by revelations plan
Evil reborn, the demon seed
Once again I've deceived
