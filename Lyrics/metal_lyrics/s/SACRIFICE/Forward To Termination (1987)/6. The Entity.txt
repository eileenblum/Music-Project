Ghostly apparations in the dead of the night, haunting you
The plane of existence where I am trapped, crossing through

Through your mind you see, trapped with clairvoyancy
Reality is lost
Born in the twilight hour, I exist; her eyes devour
Fulfill my ghostly lust

Into your dreams, I feed on your fear, I attack
My aura appears, vitality grows, the mirror cracks

Through your mind you see, trapped with clairvoyancy
Reality is lost
Born in the twilight hour, I exist; her eyes devour
Fulfill my ghostly lust

Progressive entrapment takes your thoughts
The planchette no longer conveys
Through the porthole I enter your plane
The incubus now invades
Progressive entrapment takes your body
Your brain no longer controls
Born in the chime hours to see
My immortality unfolds

Go back to hell
The plane of existence I've crossed through, terrorized
The physical state which I've regained, immortalized

Through your mind you see, trapped with clairvoyancy
Reality is lost
Born in the twilight hour, I exist; her eyes devour
Fulfill my ghostly lust
I appear, the medium sees, aura surrounds, she believes
Materialization of my soul
Through your eyes you see, I am finally
Taken by the entity
