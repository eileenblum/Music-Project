The wheel of life turns forever
A horizon begins to each that dies
Transmigration follows every soul
Must we all live an endless life
Afterlife's spell

Afterlife's spell
The end is birth
Earth is hell

Dream of the kingdom are shattered
You will never enter heaven
We all must live eternal life
Living in the torment of death

Afterlife's spell
The end is birth
Earth is hell

The wheel of life turns forever
A horizon begins to each that dies
Transmigration follows every soul
Must we all live an endless life

Afterlife's spell
The end is birth
Earth is hell
