Your mind has silenced now, screaming souls await
Chemiclas sent through your blood, they decide your fate
Suicide overwhelms to end your life in pain
A world filled with hate, what else to gain?
You're just trapped in your mind, no one can you trust
Leave your thoughts behind, for death you lust

Feel the rush, destroy the mind
Saved from hell
Cyanide

You've dropped in the poison now, the chemicals infest
Deterioration felt to end all your stress
Life planned destiny falls to the ground
The end is very near, will silence be found?
Excruciating pain, the world you despise
The air filled with hollow cries

Feel the rush, destroy the mind
Saved from hell
Cyanide

Your mind has silenced now, screaming souls await
Now you have left behind your world of hate
Forgotten victim, who now to trust
Human overwhelmed with suicidal lust
Life ends sinfully, no cares you died
You've no time to realize, your brain lied

Feel the rush waste your mind
Bound for hell
Cyanide
Feel the pain, how you died
It's too late
Cyanide
