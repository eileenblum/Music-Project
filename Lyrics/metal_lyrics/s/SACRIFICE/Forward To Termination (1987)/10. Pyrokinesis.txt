I feel the fire burn my mind
Infared thoughts sent through me
Armed with burning intellect
Destroy and let my power free

Pyrokinesis

Child prodigy of the abyss
When the red light filled my eyes
Mental abilities unlimited
Flame burns whoever defines

Pyrokinesis

Burning eyes
Screaming cries
Telepathy dies
Destroy

Kill with psychic command
No one can withstand the heat
Their inferior brains alight
Hells brainstorm defeats
