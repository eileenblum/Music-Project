Energy generates to make waste of this earth
Reactor overloads, we inherit a curse
Cannot avoid the radiation intake
Cannot correct the irreversible mistake
No hope to restore these lands of no return
Living are tortured, like souls in hell they burn
Bone marrow weakens, their bodies weak and ill
Technological mistake has left thousands killed
Scorched skin peels and dripps poisoned blood
Exotoxic fallout begins the radioactive flood
Ungodly corpse-like figures walk the wasted plains
Torn flesh burns 4s the nuclear acid rains
Radiant clouds from and contaminate the sky
Travels with the wind, all the living begin to die
Through the sea it flows, the waters turn to waste
Decimation won't stop until all life is erased

Nuclear winter sets in, your body weak and cold
Nothing to consume, your food diminishes
Hunger strikes you now, deteriation's pain
Sickness does not leave your life soon to end
No hope to restore these lands of no return
Living are tortured, like souls in hell they burn
Now each day through torment you are led
This is the day the living envy the dead

The future is bleak for the nuclear reactors' pawn
Deformed mutated children in the years to come
Destruction and decay is what the reactor sends
Each dawn we see the light of the dead
