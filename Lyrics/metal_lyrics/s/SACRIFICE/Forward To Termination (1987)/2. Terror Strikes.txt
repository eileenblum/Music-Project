Running, searching, hiding to restrain
Before I ravage all
The hate that is burning in my brain
Makes my violent tendencies rage

Terror strikes, this is what you have done to me
You are to blame for my killing energy

Return animosity given to me
It builds up and explodes
I will not show leniency
I am trapped in this void

Thrown into the pit to burn
For my final sins
I cannot live this life of hate
Back into the womb
