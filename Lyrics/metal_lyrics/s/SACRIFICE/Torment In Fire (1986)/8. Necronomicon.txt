Ignite the candles of hell burn to my coven's spell
Bound by human flesh recite the book of the dead

Necronomicon

Black forces open the grave death is now my killing slave
Rising souls of the damned hide in the pentagram

Necronomicon

Follow through the trees possessed souls lurk to kill
Raped you lie by the forces of hell released to die
I am the necromancer the dead eat your mind and soul
Maggots fill your eyes black magic takes your life

Necronomicon

To the gates of hell I return hades fires once again burn
Coven rejoices rites are read back to hell return the evil dead
