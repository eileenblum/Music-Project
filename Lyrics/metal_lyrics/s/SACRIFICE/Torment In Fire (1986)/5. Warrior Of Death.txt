I kill without mercy and with ease
I put away whoever whenever I please
Don't try to stop me you think you're brave
But when it's all over you will be in your grave

You look at me your eyes show hate
Too bad for you I'm going to mutilate
I will rip out your guts and your eyes
Don't bother fighting flee and be wise
Don't try to fight me can't you see
Don't try to fight me the only way is to flee

Many have come long before
But they all wound up dead on the floor
To be a warrior of death you must pay your dues
But you should know that I never lose

Choose your weapons a club and a knife
It's no good I want your life
I am bent on revenge my sacred trust
In a matter of moments I will turn you to dust
