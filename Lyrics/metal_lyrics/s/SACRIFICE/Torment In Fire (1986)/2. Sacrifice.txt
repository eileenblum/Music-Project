Put her on the altar, tie her down secure
She will soon die, her soul is still pure
Her body is trembling it's filled with fear
She'll lose the life which she holds dear

The dagger is ready to do it's evil deed
On her decayed corpse I will feed
Tie her legs and arms ready to read the rite
Now I feel the force of satan's might

Under baphomet she is bleeding fast
With the corpse indulge in a bloodbath
Pray to the master that this will suffice
Split her skull for this altar sacrifice

Tears on her cheek, sweat on her brow
It's time to die I will kill her now
Death has come to deliver her fate
We don't do it for love we do it for hate
