Good turns to hellish evil in one dark bloody night
Now there is satan's darkness where there once was god's light
Evil ones watch as the holy church goes up in flame
God deserts his people and gone back from where he came

Slaughter the good and holy cast then to the fires of hell
For you are satan's children under dark unholy spells
Kill the christians make their blood spew
Bring upon death for you are his chosen few

Torture in hell for the followers of christ the liar
God watches his christians dying tormented in satan's fire
No way to escape the demons, hell's few are blessed
Oblivious to life for you are beyond death
