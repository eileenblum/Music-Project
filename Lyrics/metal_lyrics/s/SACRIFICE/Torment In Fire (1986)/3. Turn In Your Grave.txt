As I come at your door I'll have you scream for more
I'll make you run and bleed
But when I leave you will fucking scream
Your death is near
Taken by the force of me you'll never be set free
I'll make you turn and die
Buried to lie forever my soul is much too clever
I'll torment you endlessly

Darkness surrounds you there is no escape
As I torture you your mind is filled with hate
But the forces of evil you are my slave
Turn in your grave

I am on an endless search trying to escape the church
Look through my evil eyes you'll see through all lies
Be one with my soul fear my present state or it will be too late
I'll make you run and bleed
Buried to lie forever my soul is too clever
Torment you in fire
