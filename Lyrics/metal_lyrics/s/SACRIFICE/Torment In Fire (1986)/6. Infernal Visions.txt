Conscious mind is closed off to reality
Mutilation of my soul comes in gradually
Nightmares of flame come into sight
To hell my mind takes its subconscious plight

Death in dreams, hellish thoughts
Infernal visions battles been fought
Trapped in mind waiting for daybreak
Already dead I can't awake

Maggots feed upon the brains of the demised
Death is real I've slowly died
To the ruler of the abyss I've been beckoned
From the world of reality I've been summoned
