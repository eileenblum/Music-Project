Sorcery to give me force
Towards the church I feel no remorse
Invoking satan for my work this night
Now you will feel hell's might

Witch hunt to destroy my reign
I will throw you into torment and pain
Stalking through evil I see them die
Burned at the stake under god's lie

Tormenting rage fighting the fire
The flames of death are rising higher
Tied to a stake witchcraft is my end
To the abyss my soul now sends

Priest reads his rites vomit strikes his face
To heaven now I will disgrace
Priest soon dies his followers now learn
The warlock of hades will make them all burn
