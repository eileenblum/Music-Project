Taunted and controlled by hell demons in my mind now dwell
Speaking in voices that aren't mine darkness and my soul combine
Forces make me take the knife want me to take someone's life
Slit the throat blood has begun don't even know what I've done

Shadows through the dark arise watch me stab my prey, she dies
Illusion controls my mind, it cries try to stop my action defied

Society calls it homicide just because the person died
I murdered by the demon's mind my thinking now has been confined
Darkness cannot leave my brain more killings maniac insane
Chanting rites I don't know evil power continues to grow
