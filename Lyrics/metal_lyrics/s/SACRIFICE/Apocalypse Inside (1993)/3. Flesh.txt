I see a vision
Daydreams of something I
need
Before I wake from this daze
My sense of wrong has
depleted

Memory under amnesia
I must have this flesh

Fallen to psychosis
No way can I comprehend
I've lost all control over
Actions you can't prevent

Memory under amnesia
I must have your flesh

I turn to face you
The lifeless color of skin
A victim of another
That resides within

Memory under amnesia
I must have her flesh
