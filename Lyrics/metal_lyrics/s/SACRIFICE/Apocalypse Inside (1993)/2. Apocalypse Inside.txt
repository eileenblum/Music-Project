Inside is consuming
Anxieties domain
Declining will within myself
Is so hard to contain

My time running out will I
survive
My life wastes away still in
decline

Inside there is nothing
When there once was concern
You do not exist to me
The point of no return

My time running out will I
survive
My life wastes away still in
decline
My trust you have defied, hate
personified
Mental suicide apocalypse
inside
I am losing myself, you don't
want to find me
Alone with what I have become

Inside with myself now
And I cannot get free
Can't get out from under my skin
And escape misery

My time running out will I
survive
My life wastes away still in
decline
My trust you have defied, hate
personified
Not indemnified apocalypse
inside

I am losing my mind, remaining
hidden inside
Alone with what I have become
