Ruins lie before my eyes
Left here by those that passed
Still repeats day by day
Tomorrow can't always hold

The lifeblood to go on, continue
As we take from the old
We lose, no gains-endtime
cannot be changed

They didn't see our lives before
When this decay began
All that we breathe today
No way to purify

The lifeblood to go on, continue
As we take from the old
We lose, no gains-endtime
cannot be changed
These ruins lies before me, we
still destroy it

These ruins of the old
Disguised as paradise
Left for the new to rebuild
But we cannot save

The lifeblood to go on,
continue

As we take from the old
We lose, no gains-endtime
cannot be changed
These ruins lies before me, we
still destroy it
