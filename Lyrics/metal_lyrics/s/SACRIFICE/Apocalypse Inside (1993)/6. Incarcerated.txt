I feel alone in a life that has
filled me with hate and strife
As a child I fell into a dark
abyss I failed to get through
Now I must pay for all of you
fools that ignored my call

By these walls walls we are kept
sedated
Incarcerated

Deathrow holds me convicted
of sins that have not been
committed
Suicide makes this his grave
as we remain forever enslaved
A queer prepares to die, don't
tolerate his kind inside

By these walls walls we are kept
sedated
Incarcerated

Pain, Alone, Inside this hole

A lifetime left to repent crime
nothing left for me but time
Can we escape this torture,
insane methods of law and
order
From your world we fell, to
spend the rest of our lives in
hell

By these walls walls we are kept
sedated
Incarcerated
