Control binds all
Under restraits
Hidden motives
Dictate a way to live

Freedom Slave
Freedom Slave

New religion
World of disorder
A sublime campaign
Rapid decline but masses
contained

Freedom Slave
Freedom Slave

Conformed ideals
To share the world
Deny freedom
Slavery
A new conflict
An insurrection
Slave to no one
Wealthy tyrants watch us
suffer

A wheel in the hate machine
Obscured and can't be seen
Conditioned not to question
A subliminal suggestion

The power of the master
Leaves us all to suffer
The dying won't be saved
Kept as freedom slaves

Freedom slave
Freedom slave
