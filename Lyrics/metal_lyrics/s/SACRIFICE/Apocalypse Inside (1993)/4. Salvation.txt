Mother of salvation stands all
alone
Save yourself expendable

Feeling the rain pour down like
bloodshed
Look to skies, darken our
lives

Lunatics take over the insane
asylum
No provocation but still beat
the war drums

Feeling the rain pour down like
bloodshed
Look to skies as it darkens
our lives

Constructing a wasteland to
imprison the damned
Salvation
A life giving womb that has
been exhumed
Salvation that fools us all

Forbidden knowledge we can't
comprehend
A lost civilization can't be
reborn
