I have become your feared creation
I am the arsonist in your incineration
Open the window of opportunity
And I will strike, give me justice

I will always take an eye for an eye
You will not deny
Give me justice

I am the catalyst, I am the martyr
But I won't sacrifice your torment
In hellfire

Your fear is how I feed
My solitary need
Your remorse is in vain
Oh
I will always take an eye for an eye
You will not deny
Give me justice

[Lead: Joe Rico]

Your fear is how I feed
My solitary need
Your remorse is in vain
Oh
I will always take an eye for an eye
Until we are all blind
Give me justice now
