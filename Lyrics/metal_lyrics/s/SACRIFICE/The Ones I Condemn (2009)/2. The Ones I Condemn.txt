The ones that I condemn
Feel the wrath of vengeance breaking you
Unforgiving, unrelenting
You begin to fall
Decline, descend
No hope
No escape, judgment of despair

No deliberation, mind is clear
The hammer falls
Strike the final nail
Seal your fate, with my hate
Descend, decline
Sell your soul to god

The ones I condemn
Granting you no amnesty
Because we stand as the elite

[Lead: Joe Rico]

Prosecute the transgression
And our mark will be made

[Lead: Joe Rico]

The ones that I condemn
Will be struck
By our fury, by our rage
Belligerence
Show no pity
No mercy, unrelenting
Exile the condemned
The ones that I condemn
