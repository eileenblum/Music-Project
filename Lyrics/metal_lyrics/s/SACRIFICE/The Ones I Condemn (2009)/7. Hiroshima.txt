The blast begins it's devastating wave
Nothing can protect, no one can be saved
The beast has risen, ground zero to the sky
In seconds, eighty thousand die

Hiroshima

Flesh peeling in strips
Not many have survived
Agonizing pain, the fortunate die
A hell on earth, no way to resist
Everything you've ever known has
Ceased to exist

Hiroshima

The corpses burn in piles on the streets
Their ashes and the fallout cover all beneath
We strive for war, not to survive
Humanity desires death more than to stay alive

Hiroshima
