Blow up, give up to decay, rot away
Feel this death kiss blow away
All your remains

I can feel the pain
Our blood, it falls as rain
All that you hold dear taken
The devil's martyr

I die, you die for all that is
Sacred in my life
I take your soul to burn in hell
We sound the toll

I can feel the pain
Our blood, it falls as rain
All that you hold dear taken
The devil's martyr

Pentagram, Pentagon
Satan lives in religion
Crescent moon, crucifix
Terrorist, 666

I can feel the pain
Our blood, it falls as rain
All that you hold dear taken
The devil's martyr
