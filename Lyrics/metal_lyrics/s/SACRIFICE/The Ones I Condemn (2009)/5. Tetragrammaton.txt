How do we pray
To save this soul
When all our faith
Left long ago

Amongst the filth, amongst the rot
Decay and disarray

How do we mourn
This fallen one
When all our fates
Were damned as one

Amongst the filth, amongst the rot
Decay and disarray

Tetragrammaton
Burns

How do we mourn these fallen ones
Whose lives will reflect the setting sun
While I breathe while you cry
Remember something we all too will die

How do we mourn this fallen one
When all our fates were damned as one
All these years... to follow, none
Defy all until the war is won
