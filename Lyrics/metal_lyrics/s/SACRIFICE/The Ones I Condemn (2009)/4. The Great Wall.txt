The tide has risen beyond the mouth of god
Drowning in death and suffering
Drilled and disciplined the legions rise
They will not disobey

The bait is set
Our deception
Stoke the tower
Defend the gates
Empire calling
Battalions fall
I know my enemy
You don't know me at all

My victory wuill be swift
Execution of our revolt
Your end is near
I survive beyond the gates
Of the great wall

As I look down
From this stone wall
With my arrogance
As you now fall
The art of war
Is to deceive
I know my enemy
My dying friend
