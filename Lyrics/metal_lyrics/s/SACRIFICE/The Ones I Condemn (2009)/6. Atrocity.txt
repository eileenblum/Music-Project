I have been reborn under
The fallen light
Attack the blameless, violence
Ignite

In pools of timid blood
Darkened skies will rain

This cause becomes a cancer
Spreading a violent plague
Like a locust swarm, no life will
Remain

In pools of timid blood
Darkened skies will rain

Darkness envelope me, to make
My conscience fail
Commit indignities to the
Weak and frail

In pools of timid blood
I begin my reign
Darkened skies will rain
No life will remain
Atrocity insane
