A vacant stare that can not be forgotten
The emptiness of a body drained of soul and life
The moment is here, the time to pay the price

I deliver sorrow
I bring temptation
I induce the end
I am desolation

I answer none
A haunting curse
Every reflection
Extinguished for eternity

I bring desolation

A haunting curse
Hollow expression
A countenance
That will remain
Close your eyes
Feel the presence
Of the departed
Calling out your name

Desolation alive
Forever I will remain
Close your eyes
And see your fate

When you look forward
You see my face
Waiting for you to expire

When the last grains
Of sand run through
Your fingers I will be there

When you are alone I am right behind you
Turn around and look into the endless void
You know my name, you know what I bring

I deliver sorrow
I bring temptation
I induce the end
I am desolation
Alive
