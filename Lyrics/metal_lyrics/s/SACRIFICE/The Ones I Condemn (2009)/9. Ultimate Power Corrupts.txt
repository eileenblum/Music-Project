Sovereignty devoured, all are oppressed
Rise up, stand up, and hold up
To be struck down
Jear me, fear me, are you with me now

Confront
Ultimate power corrupts

Warfare fuels this progress
Sacrifice your child
Keep the peace with killing
Paying with your blood
Hear me, fear me, are you with me
Fight on
Confrost
Ultimate power corrupts

Tyranny, domination
Authority
Oppression always fails

Fight on, confront, rise
Ultimate power corrupts
