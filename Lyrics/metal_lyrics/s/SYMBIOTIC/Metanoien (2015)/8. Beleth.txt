in the shadows where the secrets lie
the great being of pale skin, fallen angel
emerges with our lifeless satellite
see the 5-point star

listen
invocations
inhaled
the essence

taste
the sacraments in my thick blood
touch my fragile face
as you do with your lover
petting intimately distant light 

All my skin enjoyed your skin one day
my whole night lit on my modest
word without future.

unusual views on the bark of trees
rooted in eternal light sources
present when the clock shows the arrival time
not when your lacerated soul cries for your presence
Intoxicate me with your words
guide me on the road where the night is the new day

the excess of light blinds everyone, 
ocher autumn reborn

when you whisper a lullaby
my time will be over

I will rest in your arms
burning blue

Beleth I will cry your name, emerge my lord
awaken all our children
we obey your command, master
We are all one
we are all one
we are all one
