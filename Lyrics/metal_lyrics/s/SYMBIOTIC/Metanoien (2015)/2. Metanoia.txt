When the sunset ends,
When there is nothing more to do
When everything seems to be far away, but you can touch it

hidden mysteries in Crystal coffins
I still have a path to go
tinged with the ocher colors of that autumn
My pupils are impregan of blood
Of those who are still down here
there is no place for lamentations
there is no place for regrets 
We feel the dry leaves beneath our feet
We drown in shooting sunsets
Claiming our mortality consumed
consumed by the mutual scorn
Our pale congregation increased, 

my skeleton rests inertly 
on those pillars that say the past
My wandering essence is still stranded in this place
apathy is my only feeling
my home this overwhelming fog
Rooted to the past
staying alive by the lifeless light Of the moon

Satan let me leave this earthly House
The death with mocking smile touching my face

it plays with my future
Somehow I wont leave this place

I want to be forgiven
I want to be forgotten
Between rooms of rain and sunsets is my essence

infinite spectrum

My soul refuses to leave these cloudy corridors
Shackled by my ghosts
Humiliated by my past
Let me melt me with the Moon
for every dusk to flee with the supreme one
I will disappear with the morning star
