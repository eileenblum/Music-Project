In this labyrinth without end
they are the shadows that haunt me
those wounds that time does not heal

Repeat with a hymn and its echo transforms everything
it touches to ashes
they return to the grate chasm
each line has its own stories
and they emerge with each call of our moons
You can still feel the blood running

The piercing screams echos repeats again and again
in this abyss everything is beyond space and time
in corners of our minds

The faceless souls, with weak Features?
those souls are the sailors in these halls
Do you recognize them? Do you recognize me?
they are spectators that you've accumulated
in all funerals
Those who contemplated the decline of your
Lowest passions
Now present on the cornices of the buildings,foundations
Of hatred,lie,revenge,indifference

The stories will be repeated
You will never find rest

you will be the viewer of your own deeds
of how you get rid of the corpses raped by the system
the sharp blades of the saw
slice the skin, bones and muscles
As thick liquid flows poisoned with hatred
Now in the room you are just one

She is just a dispossession decomposed flesh
