Sowing terror to those who challenge us
let light consume them
showed as a luminaire
spreading life-giving heat,
And hint after towering mountains
The aurora in glittering colors

To the thunder of the hulls,
the flocks breaking with stillness
pale fields
Embrace the earth with
His dark cloak to
Bring the rain of light
he will emerge over weak
he will bring a new era
he will be one with his brightness
the pain and helplessness of those fallen flows
That only served as pawns in this earth
Those that built their faith on false urns were betrayed
By beings who extended his hand

spreading life-giving heat,
And hint after towering mountains
The aurora in glittering colors

To the thunder of the hulls,
the flocks breaking with stillness

Do not save us from the sadness, solitude,
do not treat us with the tenderness that makes us ill
Give us pain, squeeze us between your hands,
pull out our intoxicated heart
