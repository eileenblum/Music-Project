Believing minds, randomly moving in any direction
slowly destroying the world
staying awake, in entire cloudy nights

planning to convert them in no more than
dispossession and ashes

Sought desperately to leave my mark
on this island of the universe

You can see it, you can feel it
The hell under the orb that we have built
Hordes of death, hordes of destruction

fragments of an ancient civilization that remain
marked for eternity

I keep myself isolated from this abyss
Minimum contact to feel that this is the end
Our decline is imminent
carrying on my shoulders
the weight of this hecatomb

my ears bleed, my hands are tied
Angels and Demons in the same place
They are all guilty

I keep seeing all fall
you build your own grave
you build your own doom

This is the disgust I feel toward you
The hatred that I have with your faith
Chaos and uncertainty reign your mind
I don't see the star any more
I only see darkness
