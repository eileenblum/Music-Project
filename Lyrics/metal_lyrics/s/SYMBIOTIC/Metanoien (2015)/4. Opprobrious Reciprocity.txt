I am a pale being
My aching branches
support my forehead
while your shaded veil
Floods of oblivion over me

In me the light
it rusts, it ends
it freezes the time and paralyzes the stars
I teach the truth

The wise sampling the unknown.
Finally my hands opened the door to Ethereal
between my hands you will rest

allow me to torment man
that without conscience to the abyss is thrown
lies are their victories
lies are their glories
Lies are your illusion.

I will cure your damage 
and your wretched screams
Vanishing the beats of your heart
I will cure your damage 
and your wretched screams

I deliver myself to you, not by submission but by choice
Show your divine grace to the sceptic

Let darkness consume them
The flooding light shall not blind us
