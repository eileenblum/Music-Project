For hundreds of years, man
has been living with the knowledge in his hands 
and he was forced to coexist with other humans
depending on each other to survive

Now man wants to kill his own race,
creating biological experiments
genetic mutilation
traumatizing the people
nothing to be done
nothing to be done 

There is no god
There is no faith
There is no god

The human race is losing
I can see their purpose
I can see their end
I can see their last time on this land,
a land of death
Breaking the protocols
we entered a new era
in which discoveries destroy---
the deplorable balance, that we have yet
now open your eyes, see this destruction
and pray for your soul 
watch the disease 
it's no longer a secret
there is no god

there is no god

the recognition of knowledge
calls the process individuation 
so universal stories have been created 
to help ease the tension 
The Veil of Forgetfulness covers our consciousness 
The Veil keeps us focused in one universe, 
working on a single 'life itinerary'
While infinite numbers of alternative

spin and unfold all around us. 
here on earth there is no option,
We must be the change that finish with the oppression

Where is the salvation? 
Where is the progress?
wanted to cover our eyes with false prophets
delaying evolution,_
there are no secrets anymore
tortured minds,
Only able of corrupting 
existing for their own benefit

Now man wants to kill his own race 

Delaying evolution
For hundreds of years, man
has been living with the knowledge in his hands 
and he was forced to coexist with another humans
traumatizing people
nothing to be done
the recognition of the knowledge
so universal stories have been created
