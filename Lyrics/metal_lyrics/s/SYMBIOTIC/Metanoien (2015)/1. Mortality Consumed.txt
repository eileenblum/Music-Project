attached to this sudden notion I have of you
When an avalanche of Gospels shudders my ways
There is only the wind and words in ashes
every time it is more diffuse

There is no pain or madness, only you as a premonition
flooded of sour nostalgia, my pores
The time severs the agonizing, observing its fruits,
Interrogating all my whims
The hell is your skin consumed by heralds of the night,
that with modest anguish i contemplate
These suffocating streets
where rain and i were one

your delirious laugh deafens the pain of the decapitated one
Hours impregnated with cowardice and false hope
I still hope to return everything that you fucking gave me

I want to drink those tears intoxicated with hatred
dismember these walls that still scream my name
Echoes that are tearing my soul and lead me to the delirium
Returning to the same stream where my reflection
is more diffuse every time
