In the quiet stillness of the night
Path away toward darkness
Home that saw my descendant grow
Roof that shelters my beloved.
Listen to me she said, leaning her hand on my chest
In red must be stained this ground
I am the soulless incarnation
The one who could see the dismal gallery.
Among sighs and solitude take my essence.
With majestic agony let the hate consumed me.
No more free souls, I must finish with your pain.
In the deepest dark you'll see when your blood spills
And your heartbeat disappear.

Crime? Guilt? Remorse? I don't know it in me
Extinguishing its luminous aura is my duty.
Death is the darkest way, but the shortest.
The tears are shed, shred their skulls mercilessly
One by one fracture their ribs and lacerate the skin
Soon you won't feel anything.
Your wrenching screams decorate this premature autumn
Two glass caskets, three corpses

The rain will wash this face without expression
Two graves without name
Two graves without epitaph.
