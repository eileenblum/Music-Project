Where the rocks touch the sky, there is no difference between day and night
Eternal pale light, penetrates the hillsides, that painted with blood were
Orbs in geometric position are aligned, accumulated energy to the black transmit
The echo of the trumpets have rumbled against the clouds, the hour has come
When the lightning strikes the top of the great mountain
Will open the forgotten path.
Obey the designs of the devourer of the dead
Roots of the evil forces cling to their flesh
Suffer the possession of the nauseating priest, has vanished your freedom
The waves flood their rotten soul
Hosts of depravity
Infection of the spirit bloody scream in agony
Obey the designs of the devourer of the dead
Roots of the evil forces cling to their flesh
Suffer the possession of the nauseating priest, has vanished your freedom
The waves flood their rotten soul
Hosts of depravity
Infection of the spirit bloody scream in agony

The great eye of the black mountain feeds on you
Your hearts will be withered
Timeless cycle of energy
Puppets, pile of useless bones under my orders are.
Purified shall be their homes no more laughter, no more breezes of faith.

Listen to the whispers the devourer of dead calls
Breaking a young spirit is easier
Let the children leave to the call of the rain
The transmission has initiated.
They will fall.
