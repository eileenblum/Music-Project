The moment has come.
I've descended to a place from which I can't escape
Can only see my shade projected on these walls
Maze of sickness, come and go familiar ghosts
Sailors of the time, disfigured faces in agony.
The panic seizes me
My eyes are balanced in a red vortex
Pendulum of illness
The reflection of the sanity, is gone from my eyes...
The fear will never go, I'm paralyzed.
I still feel the ground pass between my fingers,
Can still hear the screams

Cannot focus my point of view on anything only
The passage of the time.
Isolated from all inanimate,
In this place I feel like dying
One by one the immaterial demon
Has cursed us.
