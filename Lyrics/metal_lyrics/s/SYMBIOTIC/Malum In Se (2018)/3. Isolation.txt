Monotonous beings slaves of their own morbid thoughts
Slowly moving at the edge of this top hill
The voice calls me, smoothing ear
With rough and grunting sounds
Taking this feeling of gray exile
Mildew epitaphs, suspended in isolation, plundered mausoleums decorate this land
The light on my skin does not burn as well, only warms my essence
I listen to soft whispers, that announce that the star king will have its daily funeral
Soon the moon will kiss this field
Cease the Victorian lullabies
Shed this blood that it no longer wants, which no longer needs to flow
This has no end, I am still falling without reaching any part
Mildew epitaphs, suspended in isolation, plundered mausoleums decorate this land
The light on my skin does not burn as well, only warms my essence
I listen to soft whispers, that announce that the star king will have its daily funeral

They throw me to the black abyss
Breaks my face, dismembered my limbs, lacerate my soul
Lacerate my soul
The moon will give orchids for burials to come...
Have taken me with their pale hands, and with inhuman force
They throw me to the black abyss....
