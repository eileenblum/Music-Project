The color of this room
The light of the decaying moon.
Doesn't mix with the purple of this crystal box.
Contour contracted lips of habitual paleness
Eyes that lack of brightness
Birth after death!
Birth after death!
Ghosts will suffer the mourning of their own death
Lost in a sea of black spells and altered reality
Intact eyes that won't see shine our star
Morbid example of death imitating life
Intact eyes that won't see shine our star
The horror walks among us
You are the new victims of the absurd
I'm the devourer of souls
You never be able to see his face grow
Shatter in the mirror of time.

They can not escape, they can not rest
Cyclical notion, mistaken escape.
The horror walks among us, you are the new victims of the absurd
I am the devourer of souls
They can not escape, they can not rest
Cyclical notion, mistaken escape.
