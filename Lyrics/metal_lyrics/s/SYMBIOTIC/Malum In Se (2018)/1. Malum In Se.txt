The nightmare about which we never speak,
Everyone in the sleep or the wakefulness have seen this woman.
The one who painted pale and cold aura,
Beyond the dark veil she watches and stalk us
Waiting to incarnate, the orb, the essence, she watches us
Pale and cold aura, beyond the dark veil, she watches us, stalk us.
Blood swirling in the purple neck that hangs from the ceiling
Cries from the stillborn.
Rotten flesh joining the ground
It crosses the souls of the weakest
Almost beastly, they become animals
What a horrible night to have a curse

Fine and immeasurable purple mist drowns me
Fine and immeasurable purple mist drowns me
She seems sad and afflicted
The eye of the great raven saw us
Remind us the one who built the necropolis
In each dead hour I have tried to get away from her.
Nobody has return, of the fog no one can leave
We can only wander and get lost in it
In the mist all the stars die
Unknown the strange guest who lives in our souls.
Nobody has return, of the fog no one can leave
We can only wander and get lost in it
In the mist all the stars die
Unknown the strange guest who lives in our souls.

My heart now lives in the shadows
The eyes are closed, the ears ignore and the voices are quiet in the ground that loves
Silence
"Cernis qua vivis, qua moriere latet"
"Cernis qua vivis, qua moriere latet"
"Cernis qua vivis, qua moriere latet"
All the stars die.
