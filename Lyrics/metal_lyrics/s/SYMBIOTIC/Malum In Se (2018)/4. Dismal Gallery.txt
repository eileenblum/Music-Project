Black clouds have accumulated over the town.
The wind blows so strong that the trees seem to have will.
They shake off and twist as if something was bothering them,
Hurting it, annihilates inside.
The paths of this village now forgotten by the light.
Dance and calls me, seducing these five senses.
Poisoned by hatred and despair.
Crows rush against the rocks, brutally beating their wings and skulls
With dementia their bodies are shattered,
Thick and icy blood paints my skin spread
One by one they fall from the mountain, all come to die here,
I cannot stand to contemplate this massacre
Disturbs my perception and pulverizes my mind.

Was it possible to distinguish what was happening to me?
Could I only attend to the call of death?
Black-winged creatures, with their corpses flood everything that is around me, embrace the horrible nature
Of their suicide, embrace the dismal gallery, the messengers of the inanimated, radical purge.
Shout that I, must exterminate every source of light.
Weak souls
Forever in the darkness.
