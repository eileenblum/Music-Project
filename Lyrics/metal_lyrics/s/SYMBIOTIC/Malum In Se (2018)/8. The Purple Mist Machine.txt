The purple mist has flooded this land
I'm locked up with this beast,
Unreachable energy

The great force,
The tesseract rises, I can see through the mist, the course of time...
Glide as liquid silver, Themis and Neith emerge, to intervals...
Fluorescent light, ultraviolet radiation.
Everything happens, so slow.

Somehow, have to end this nightmare
Somehow have to defeat it, piroplastic flow strikes me
I've been thrown against these sharp edges
The tesseract rises, I can see through the mist, the course of time...
Defense is useless,
Escape impossible
Surrender to his whims
Saw his eyes and a thought crushed my mind
Without words exchanged
Terror that feels perpetually
From the misery of two worlds.
