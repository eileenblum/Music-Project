Licentious feasts they've started
Malicious incantations
Collected hate to bind the night

Their fragile souls they've buried
The breath of life has faded
Four Crown Princes of Hell

Remember, I took Isaiah's bane
I'm stirring when my disciple's pray.
I hear them cry out for ecstasy

Beyond the Gates of Mayhem
Lies insanity - Tower of Belial.

I followed streets full of pain, full of anger
I sought for the traces once more.
Invading the tombs with a martyr's intention
My limbs all but tired and sore

Remember, I took Isaiah's bane
I'm stirring when my disciple's pray.

Remember, I took Isaiah's bane
I'm stirring when my disciple's pray.
I hear them cry out for ecstasy.

Beyond the Gates of Mayhem
Lies insanity - Tower of Belial.

Remember, I'm waiting patiently
With fading lights they come to comfort me.
And I came so far but you're gonna fall.

Lord of Lies, let us kindle your pride
Wading through the blood for the final fight.

We walk those streets to scare them out
We honour your sins, it's your name we shout

Remember, I'm waiting patiently
With fading lights I take their sanity
And I've got what they were yearning for
They gonna die, join my majesty
