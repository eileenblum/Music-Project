Beat me to death, just give me a reason
What for I still should return.
To this place where we once pledged allegiance
That became hostile and stern.

We write people's tragedy
Until the curtain falls.

When reason crumbles
(It's a third moon rising)
And night prevails
When good will stumble
(It's a third moon rising)
Then we all give up our faith.

Give me a break or confirm my convictions
That this story was not meant to last
I think 'forever' just falls into fiction
And our hopes belong to the past.

We wrote people's tragedy
Until the curtain falls.
Guess fate has a tendency
To surprise them all.

[2x]
When reason crumbles
(It's a third moon rising)
And night prevails
When good will stumble
(It's a third moon rising)
Then we all give up our faith.

We wrote people's tragedy
Until the curtain falls.
