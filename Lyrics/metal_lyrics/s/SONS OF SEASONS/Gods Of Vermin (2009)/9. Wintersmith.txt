The days have grown darkerAnd clouds are hanging low.The hills once spread lush and greenSnow's falling where the roads have been. So little her confidenceBut still she walks strong.I'm born from the season's danceTo men I belong. Winter's alive, one splintered soulNo heartbeat inside.Breathing the cold, uncertain strideTrying to feel, to be next to her. The cold is coming closerAnd the harmony is lost,This burden that lies on my soulAnd in my hand my people's hope. My maiden's uneasiness, her anxiety,To put all those fears to rest is a task given to me.  [3x]Winter's alive, one splintered soulNo heartbeat inside.Breathing the cold, uncertain strideTrying to feel, to be next to her.
