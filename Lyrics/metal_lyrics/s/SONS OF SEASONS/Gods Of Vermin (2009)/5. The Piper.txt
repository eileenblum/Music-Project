Searching the hills afar, unbroken grounds.Tasting the scent of vine, tongue's lullaby. He ascended from earth's dark embrace,Sulphuric spawn.So he blended into man's mundane waysAnd decided to wait. Why do they say that despite all the laughterEvery man feels some sadness inside.Don't know if it's true but I'm bound to believe it,Taking their children into summer's night. He took them allHis hungry soulTheir spirit's innocence. ObedienceThe piper's handsPlay melodies divine. Why do they say that despite all the laughterEvery man feels some sadness inside.Don't know if it's true but I'm bound to believe it,Taking their children into summer's night. Maybe it's time for my soul's own salvationEven the haunted feel sadness insideDon't know if it's true but I'm bound to receive itThus this pretension is unspoken right.
