I dream of days when things went right
Release the anger of our past
Old memories they are crawling deeper.

It never hurts to try this thing
That is what they say
That season changed those times
I'm here to stay.

Out of the dark now I'm free
Saw their patience fading.
I create another world to be me
Break the curse and don't fear it.

A vicious theory of so-called wise men
A firm of standing, their rise impending.
Conserving the dying, the act of so-called wise men
Defying the pain I have to fight unto the end.

This time we let go fear Create a whole new environment here
If not we're all damned to go down.
This time we let go fear to leave a long trace of dust and tears
If not we're all damned to go down.

I walked alone in autumn's light
Released the anger of the past
Old memories were crawling deeper.
I heard the sound of angel wings
Despite what they say.
That season changed my life I longed to stay.

This time we let go fear Create a whole new environment here
If not we're all damned to go down.
This time we let go fear to leave a long trace of dust and tears
If not we're all damned to go down.

They try to be the ones who make things real, who work with fear
The ones providing antidotes, the ones who run all things in here.
So now the time has come to make my point, to shoot my gun
A hole into the atmosphere creating a new celestial sphere.

I fly too high: cry over me!
Oh well, I didn't see it coming, so I get down - on my knees.
Oh well, here I go now!
