Brain-jamming ignorance reviving,While marching down streets we've seen once before.Into puddles of mud they're divingFlying like insects around a rotten core. Feed me from a dead tree ('cause I see)I see shadows of a dead man, he is rising again. Shame of this nation incitedThe scum of the wastelands is strumming the old chords again.Raising their fists to the doctrines of hate,Verminous ideology.The leader is calling, resistance is fallingSmall-mindedness spreading too fast. Feed me from a dead tree ('cause I see)I see shadows of a dead man, he is rising again. Feed me from a dead tree ('cause I see)Once we have supremacy we're creating new divinity.  [4x]I see shadows of a dead man.
