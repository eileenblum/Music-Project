Control, they hold on to this ray of light.
Their mind's cheating the old frames of time.

And they all fear our freedom inside

Like a blind man's resolution to see again
But the truth lies beyond the sun.

Denied to go down the streets unrestrained
This right to walk without saying my name.
What they do is raise capacity
To observe the hive's affinities.

And they all fear our freedom inside
Pushing on until all chances have died.

Like a blind man's resolution to see again
But the truth lies beyond the sun.

(We are gods, we don't save, we don't save)

Like a blind man's resolution to see again
But the truth lies beyond the sun.
His attempt of retribution, consistently
Is a threat to society.
