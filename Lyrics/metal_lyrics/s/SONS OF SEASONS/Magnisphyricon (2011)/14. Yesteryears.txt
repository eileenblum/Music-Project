Safeguard in times of need, a scheme to face demise.
Something is calling old memories into the light.
This sleeping draught released me.

I recant my intent to reshape this scene, to revive a fading dream.
I'll stay, live here for eternity, I rest, here I rest in peace.

Won't you share those feelings with me?
If pain or delight, such varieties I've known.
After all the sand of time is a cruel thing.
Helpless I am standing, disintegrating.

I'll stay live here for eternity, to heal and to tell my tale.
I'll stay, to elude life's travesty,
I rest, here I rest in peace.
