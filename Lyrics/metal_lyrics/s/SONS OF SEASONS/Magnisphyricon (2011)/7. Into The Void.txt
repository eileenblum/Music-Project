All these hours feel like wintertime,
withered days, grey and cold.
In my confinement I seek the stars,
princes of space,
candles of God.

I sing my song, my rhapsody,
but in the end the words just
slip away.

I've lost whatever I have had,
while the plague erased what I have
once been.

This is the first step to extinction,
life's last monstrosity.

Mental foundations just disappear,
elusive descent into the void.
My destination is oblivion,
blindfolded angels harvesting my brittle soil.

White noise is filling up my brain,
my last illusions, they lose their shape.
This is the first step to extinction,
life's last monstrosity.

What I have found, what I have lost,
in Purgatorio.

Life's play dark scenery,
the actors veiled in grey.
Cruel lies, brave honesty,
just drift away.
