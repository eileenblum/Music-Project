Indoctrinate your stupidity,
your bone-dry book of rules,
on someone else than me.

To incarcerate free speech of mind,
gender equality,
marks you as dumb and blind.

I'd rather poison
the air I breathe
than risk the chances
for your defeat.

Follow me, follow me,
bring your curse on me.

Bury me, bury me,
bring your pain on me.

Your hate leaves me high and pure.
I am Guilt's Mirror.

A circus full of clowns
rotten brains, a bunch of dicks,
ruled by God or politics -
retarded intellects.

Some barking extremists
won't change the life we chose.
A test of tolerance,
face modern age's
antagonist.
