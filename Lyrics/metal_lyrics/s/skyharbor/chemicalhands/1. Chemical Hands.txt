Drowning in chemical seas
Trying to cleanse the memory
A proof of life

Deprived of all senses
Embrace the nothingness

Pull me in synthetic hands
Bury all the past within
Denial is the symptom
Choke the words
Breathe it in
Bleed the veins of life again
A nihilistic vision

Drifting on starlight
Moments of clarity
Crash down on me

I'm on a search for truth

Illusions to swallow
Halos become the noose

Deprived of all senses
Embrace the nothingness

Pull me in synthetic hands
Bury all the past within
Denial is the symptom
Choke the words
Breathe it in
Bleed the veins of life again
A nihilistic vision

Senses all deprived
Erase and sanitize
Promising new life
To let go

Digging up the extramental

Senses all deprived
Erase and sanitize
Promising new life
To let go
Enchained to ground
I'll never fly again
With crystal eyes
I am entombed within delusion
I fall again
Reflections haunting
The broken melody
Of my shattered heart

Senses all deprived
Erase and sanitize
Promising new life
To let go
