I'll never know how something so alive and fine
Can see behind the sun
I'll never know how someone so beautiful
Could pine away

Cry...we're free again, Celestial

I don't know why you can't fight me, resist, abide by fists
Back to back and it's time you knew now that this is all you had

When we are rejected we lose our way, we're terrified
When we are protected the stars shine light into our lives

I lost my way, I'm fine
I lost my way
I lost my way
I don't know and I don't care

Cry...we're free again, Celestial

I fell down undiscovered
I'm broken waiting for this endless day to come
Please don't turn off the lights we're having the time of our lives

I don't know why you can't fight me, resist, abide by fists
Back to back and it's time you knew now that this is all you had

As life burns out age old earth rolls on
Lights fade out, away

As daylight dies the world will turn it's back on you
As daylight dies the stars will shine for you
Don't want to feel like this anymore
Don't want to lose my way again
