Behind the walls we seem to know
We have faith in too many things and we just don't know what to choose
We have control over everything and we could stand to lose it all

I believe we are a supernova. Born onto a dying star

What if we had known, but what if we were never meant to know?
Behind our star
What if we had known, but what if we were never meant to know?
We die stranded here
Would we survive, or would we die?
Behind our star
We want this to be over

We believe in so many things that we just don't know what to do
We have faith in too many things that we just don't know what to choose

Supernova, tell us once again, will we ever know?
Tell us who we are
Born onto a dying star

Home again
When will I be home again?
We want this to be over

Tell us who we are
We want this to be over, although we need it so badly
