Lines. The question's left alone
I will hold on to this for as long as I remember your face

For the love of my brother
You've taken time. My friend. My providence

Take the time to talk
Walk with me a while
Break a promise
Throw an arm around
Seize the day

I watched you go inside
Take your name this time
Watch me do it
Let me break the tide
Breaking water

My hands are still
The words are one to shake
Shiver me
The three us will move
Water demon

The names are on my hand
I write your name again
Sever honor
Being by myself
Playing time

The game is ill. I stand here conquered
These lines on paper won't mean shit if I don't let them go

The ink of sanity. Drained upon my guilt
I promise to

Hold on to your pictures
Never take what you're given. Never mend on the bend

Do away with your resolve
Lines on paper fading. I've given into this mess

Take the time to talk
Walk with me a while
Break a promise
Throw an arm around
Seize the day

I watched you go inside
Take your name this time
Watch me do it
Let me break the tide
Breaking water

My hands are fucking still
The words are one to shake
Shiver me
The three us will move
Water demon

The names are on my hand
I write your name again
Sever honor
Being by myself
Playing time

Never spoken. Never scarred. On me

These shores tonight. They pray
