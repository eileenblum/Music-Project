Children... we stand and fight
Message... we stand and fight
Children... we stand and fight

All these days are numbered, lets play the waiting game
One by one the fallen will get to take the blame

Elegant, all of them but some thing's missing, it's more than just happiness
They feel cheated, all of them, everyone
They feel defeated, it's serious suffering, when will this change?
Boy, you just shove it
Game for a feeling
Your time is coming
Ever closer now

Slowly we move in, and so we start again
Only our finest can hold them in the rain

Blinding white noise. Times have changed
Blinding white noise. Times must change

So hard bending light, someone tell me how to get through the TV?
How to get through the damn hole?

Once again I begin losing all of my senses
