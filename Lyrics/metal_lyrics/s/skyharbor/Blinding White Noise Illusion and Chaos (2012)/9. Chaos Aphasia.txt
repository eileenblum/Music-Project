Catch. Take it and run. These words were built to hold you down. Never obey.
Spread your toes, let it burn.
Feel the wind. You've given in to the desolate march of chaos. Flying.
Dig into the ground below.
Take the pill. You're digging a place so secret. Lies will fall. You will soar.
Part the wind. When you've burned your world around you, bridges are all that (remain).

Run. Push. Away. Into the sky.
The ground. Propels. Your will.
And I hate
Defining the winds
And I hate
You run to fly.

Lay back and observe the mess you've made of the children in your mind.
When you're running at those speeds, you don't fall.
You collide

Catch. Take it and run. You've armed yourself to take the sky. Break the cast.
Spread your toes, let it burn.
Feel the wind. Deliver the words you'll never forget. Silent. Brooding.
Dig into the ground below.
Take the pill. They'll never see your going.
Lies will fall.
You will dig.
Part the win. When you've burned your world around you, bridges remain.
When you burn. The bridges. The water will rise.
The ground. Propels. The sky.
And I hate
Defining the wind
And I hate
You run to fly.
