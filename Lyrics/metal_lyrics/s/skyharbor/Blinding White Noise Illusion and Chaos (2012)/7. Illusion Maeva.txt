Alice making me pay with temptation
I stray far from wonderland to a place of war
White rabbit suggests that I take a few pills
And drink some shit that I've never even seen before

Fields of green and hearts of stone surrounding me
Make for glorious undertones
A pack of cards thrown in my hand
Forgiving castle walls just turn to sand

Are you following me as I try to explain?
Mad Hatter is here, messing with my brain
Are you curious now? Dis-functioning in the clouds
I spent far too long milling in this drain

Fields of green and hearts of stone surrounding me
Make for glorious undertones
A pack of cards thrown in my hand
Forgiving castle walls just turn to sand

Don't lose the fight and look back
It's time to dance
We're alive, come together and you'll know this is India!
It's so damn hard to let go
But take a chance
And survive, come together, embrace life this is India!

Holding out a hand hoping I'll believe her, that I'll understand.
Tell me isn't this the truth, choosing to ignore her, what if it was you?
Tell me how do we get so wrapped up in our own world?
Kill all the lights, this is the last time. This is the last time everything is grey.
Everything is grey, everything is grey.
And you know they got us on the run, killing as life goes on
Same old story, yeah? Same old story.

I can't find myself, I'm sure I live for something but as
My minds eye will tell these little fingers are disgusting not by choice
I'll think of something but I'll save some for myself
Boys don't believe, don't believe, don't believe it
Think about, think about, think about it
Don't believe, don't believe.
Be careful what you say because anyone could be listening
