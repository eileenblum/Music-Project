I still miss you, how do you fare?
An angel came to me, pulling me back again
With a loving despair

So everybody dies
Everybody drifts away
Everybody dies

I feel lonely, come home swiftly
Even though I tried holding you back again
I'm still slipping away

Pray for the love, for the need to be free
For someone you can hold

So everybody dies
Everybody drifts away
Everybody dies
