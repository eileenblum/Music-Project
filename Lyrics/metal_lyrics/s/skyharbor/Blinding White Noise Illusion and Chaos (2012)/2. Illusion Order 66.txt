Hold on, don't lose the order
You know it's okay to live and learn
How long would you suffer before you sacrifice the sun?

How many times have I been here?
I can never tell
Playing with fire feels sincere
Even though I'm in hell

I won't fight the one
I turn away from order

So strong, you learn to love her
Like a child so unaware
How come we all recover?
You know it's okay to be compared

How much death have I been near?
Far too much to tell
Nothing scarred me more than fear
I step forth to tell

I won't fight the one
I turn away from order
We reverse the cell again
I won't fight the one
I turn away from order
