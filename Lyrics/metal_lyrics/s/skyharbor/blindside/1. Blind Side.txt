I am just a lost soul
Searching for the sun
Will it wait for us
Drift away from us

I'm another cold soul
Reaching for the light
Bound by these chains I cannot break

Drain me empty
Buried in deep

Leeches
Liars
Blindside
Karma
Rise, leave them all behind
Carnivores swallowing the earth

I won't be a lost soul (not another lost soul)
Casualty of broken dreams (in my dreams)
Forfeit all you know
In cable streams
Floating vessels on the wire
They'll speak for us
Reflecting us

Distorting the truth beneath the veil
Drag deceit until the skin starts to bleed
Is it hard to see with two faces
Does your tongue get tied
Talking from the sides of your mouth
The truth can only bend so far

Screens cracked
Push back
Breathe new life

Drain me empty
Buried in deep
Leeches
Liars
Blindside
Karma
Rise, leave them all behind
Carnivores swallowing the earth

Blind us
Bind us
Take it all
Eyes of wisdom
See it all
I am just a slave to you
I won't give you what you want
