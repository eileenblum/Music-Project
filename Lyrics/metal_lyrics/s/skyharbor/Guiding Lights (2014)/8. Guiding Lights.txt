I refuse no rivers.
Itâs a revelation that I discovered.

Iâll follow your many guiding lights,
And tear away through your love.
Iâll follow your many guiding lights,
And now I tell youâ¦
To follow me under, far below.
The deeper the secrets, far below.
Iâm pulling you under, far below.
The deeper the secrets, marry every lie we told.

Hidden by a shadow cast by the street lights,
Black walls are closing in fast tonight.
Iâm abandoning all my thoughts and hiding here
By the firelight in a motherâs open arms.
But you know itâs never over when the pain begins to come,
When everything around you falls apart and comes undone,
And you fail to take back what youâve done.
Now the tears start to fall and panic brings me to my knees.
You choke me on the floor and grip my neck so I canât breathe.
Just take a bow and then you make my bodyâ¦
Hollow, hollow, hollow.

You know my name.
You know my fate.
Take my shame, my shame.
Take my pain.
Wash away the blame.
Follow me down,
Follow me down,
Follow me down to solid ground.

Thereâs a presence around you as the colors start to blur.
To have a passion for painting letters and comprehending words.
Be prepared to understand itâs not the world at fault,
And there will always be somebody to catch you when you fall.
Show me how to live,
Teach me how to tolerate.
Encourage me to give,
Empower me to love and celebrate.

Iâll follow your many guiding lights,
And tear away through your love.
Iâll follow your many guiding lights,
And now I tell youâ¦
To follow me under, far below.
The deeper the secrets, far below.
Iâm pulling you under, far below.
The deeper the secrets, binding both the worlds we know.
Follow.
