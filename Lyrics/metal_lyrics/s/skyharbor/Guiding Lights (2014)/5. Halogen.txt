Now wake me up and Iâll follow on, and run
around with these familiar faces. Discover
revelation. This evanescent blue, Iâll find you.
This information is confirmation that weâre set
to lose it all.

Raise up the world. Rain down your souls.
This information, this evanescent blue is
confirmation that I know I canât be wrong

Satisfaction left for dead, armor for my weakened
head. Separate to devotion. I recognize that weary
head, nothing to be left unsaid. Never before, ever
did I ever have that feeling.

Rain down, pour my soul.
Rain down, pour my soul.

Back and forth, back and forth straight into
my arms. If youâre waiting for love, then donât
do it alone.

Back and forth, back and forth straight into
my arms. Where did we go wrong? Where did
we go wrong, so wrong?

Where did we go wrong, cos this has gone
out of control.
