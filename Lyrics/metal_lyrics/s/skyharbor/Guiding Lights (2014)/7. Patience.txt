Sleepâ¦ stay asleep.

My soul yearns for one last look at you
Before I leave you here to be hidden within idyllic peace
Itâs the perfect memory and I keep it close to me

Bound with wire
Cut me deep into the seams
Flow the colours of the queen
I live like Iâm the only one, the fragile one that fights to survive
Crown the liar
Buried deep beneath the cross
Tainted hearts forever lost

Sweet treasure, let go of all you know
Sweet treasure, you are the one, you are my only true pleasure

Now watch me burn it all down, parasite town
Far down below itâs a fight for survival
So scared as I am of you
Iâll burn it all down, parasite town
I call this survival
So scared as I am of you, parasite town.
