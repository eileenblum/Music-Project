Weak and feeble, poor mind. Overcome, pack of
lies. Lonely world. Future sound.

Stay asleep, there's so far to go. All I ask is please
donât fill your life with treasure and nothing more.
Never let your temper take control, never choose
to love somebody then sell your soul.

Iâll wait for you, and youâll find it so mysterious. All
the beauty you will discover. All the stillness seems
so serious. Dive deep into the colours.

Stay asleep, there's so far to go. All I ask is please
donât fill your life with treasure and nothing more.
Never let your temper take control, never choose
to love somebody then sell your soul.

Stuck inside this daydream once again. I remember
dancing vividly under innocent midnight skies and
street lights. I keep waking up.

As I sink into the sand my time has come, and Iâm
waiting for the endless tide to come. I give this
lonely world future sound.

Pretending not to feel like a liar. I am. Pretending
not to feel like a cynical and wretched soul. I give
this world future sound, oh little boy.

If what I see is real, then you are my miracle.
