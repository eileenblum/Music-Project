Once more, you're a part of this never ending
burning fire. Bring some peace to my tired eyes.
Take this higher when angels sing with voices of the night.

I dream of endless light, a life I sacrificed. I walk
through endless night. Then I'm gone again.

Once more, we're a part of this constant motion.
Give me the strength to keep my body going. Hide in
darkness till the day is done. Exposed to so much
danger, pacifying strangers. It's a story that I wrote
for you, listen closely as I break through. This effigy
is spinning free.
I dream of endless light, a life I sacrificed.

The flood of power will be overwhelming. Run, hide
until it's over. Didn't you see I was sinking? I was
drowning overboard. I awaken.

Sleep with tainted thoughts until the day that you
grow old. It's a forgiving notion. I've never been
so emotionally blind, I'll never give up and drop,
and I know I'll never come back down from here,
resisting gravitation. The stars have never been unkind,
the galaxies burn into and I know they'll never leave my mind.
Life is constant motion, the moon is round
but has two sides, the light shines deep into
and I see myself in those blue eyes, you
are my incarnation.

Crying eyes, give me clarity within the darkness.
Hide away until the day is done. Reveal to me your
nature, secret prying stranger. It's the greatest day
you'll ever know. Save me from these crying eyes.

Give me strength to keep my body going. Hold my
heart and let the blood flow. Exposed to so much
danger, pacifying strangers. It's the greatest day you'll
ever know. Save me from this drowning state

Give in to the flood. This is my last devotion to you.
Give in to the endless flood. This is my last devotion to you.
