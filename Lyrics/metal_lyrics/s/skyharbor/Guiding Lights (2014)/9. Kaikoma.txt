Would you pull me in or push me out? The gold
coronaâs what I dream about. Pale skin and crystal
eyes, a power that I canât deny.

Stay close to me, come lose yourself, walk into
the bitterness.
Come to me, undo yourself, innocently
discontent. Stay with me, come lose yourself,
far into the wilderness.

far into the wilderness.

A bind so strong heals my heart. I live a spiritual
and supernatural life. Prayers behind every scene.
I just canât be alone.

We are taken, we are frozen.

You are the winter biting, piercing my skin
the storm may come, malevolent fun but I am
still here alone.

We are taken, we are frozen.

I look deep down inside, discovering the truth.
I can see the fool that froze the sky with pale skin
and crystal eyes.
