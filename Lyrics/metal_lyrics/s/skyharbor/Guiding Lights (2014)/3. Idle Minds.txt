You rose above, transcended all, now I suffer and
take the fall. I gave you all that love could give, but
karma called. Scrub up, operate on this blood red
stone. Here we go! I try not complicate but this is
not a celebration now. No, Iâm moving on.

You rose above, transcended all, now I suffer and
take the fall. I gave you all that love could give, but
karma called. Who, who are you, if I can be so bold?
Oh, did you let it slip to the ones who came
before? We live in an isolated, unforgiving world.

Everyone deserves to be righteous, free
and satisfied. If I can do it myself, then you can do
it yourself. Every time I fly away I leave my body
behind.

Asphyxiated on this cold hard floor, you are the
ivy and you take control. Please let me go, release
me from your stronghold. I see the consequence
of open doors. I get the sense that Iâve been here
before. I see the consequence of open doors.
This honest lust has made me want you more.

Here stands my guilt intent, pretending to let go
here for the final time. Statue of a broken line.
Pretending to let go here for the final time. You
are the ivy that suffocates these crooked limbs and
these rusting walls. Idle minds forget the past.
Idle minds are doomed to pass.

Donât be afraid, be victorious. This sudden urge for a
needless thought. Close the door, the night is ours.
The need for change is in us all.
Donât be afraid.
