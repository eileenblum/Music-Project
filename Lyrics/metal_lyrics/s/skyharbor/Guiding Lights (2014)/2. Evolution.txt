I stare into the night
Passing shadows under glistening light
When you light that flame
I see visions dancing in your eyes

Let me burn
We are created by the energy
So if this is evolution
And infinite possibilities
Let me burn
This is evolution

Look into the sky
See the hunter hiding from the light
When you hear the sound of rain and thunder
Run into the wild

You don't need to envy me
'cause you got everything you need
Take my hand and follow me

Don't be afraid
It's just communication
You'll never have it all
But it is in our nature
The need for more

You don't need to fight it
Just let it go
There'll be no limitations
Take me far

Burn
Burn
Burn

Let me burn
I'm the energy
This is evolution
And infinite possibilities
Let me burn
This is evolution

Don't be afraid
It's just communication
You'll never have it all
But it is in our nature
The need for more

You don't need to fight it
Just let it go
There'll be no limitations
