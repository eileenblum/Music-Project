Come close to me, promise everything, donât tell a
soul, letâs just begin. Stiletto tied and bound to me,
the sound of silk and skin to skin. A close embrace,
a lusting grin, entangled in a web of lust and sin.
A kiss of death, the speed of sound, youâve come to
take my innocence.

Donât hesitate, your gift sets me free. And the biting
feeds the lust in me.

No thanks to this state of undress, you drag me in
hand on my chest. the beat of life will satisfy, poison
lips I wonât deny. A close embrace, a lusting grin,
entangled in a web of lust and sin. A kiss of death,
the speed of sound. Do you feel the beat of life?
forgive me, oh wonât you forgive me?

Donât hesitate, your gift sets me free. And the biting
feeds the lust in me.

Youâre slipping through my fingertips, you bring me
to my knees. Itâs over and Iâm cold.

In this fine allure, keep it to yourself. I need your
love. In this fen allure, the biting feeds a lusting,
beating heart. I trust in you and carelessly strip you
down. Living, living by the words lâamour.
Playing by the rules no more. Living by the words
lâamour, lâamour, lâamour. dangerous eyes,
tempting sighsâ¦keep them to yourself.
Strip me down.

Youâre so warm and slipping through my fingertips,
you bring me to my knees. Itâs over now.
And I wonât hesitate, your gift sets me free. And the
biting feeds the lust in me.
