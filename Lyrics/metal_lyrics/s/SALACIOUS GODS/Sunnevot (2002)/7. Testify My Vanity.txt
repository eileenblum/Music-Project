Henceforth thou shalt despise his name
Pray for absolution
In poor absurd tongue
Blood flows Locust swarms
The flamboyant throne The mules jaw
Funeral pile flames ate heretic flesh raw
And thereof I testify in blood

Ten commandments
Shattered chaos reins
The voice of god is silent
My boot rests on his face
Daylight fades firstborn die
Bloodstained doors The sulphur rain
On Sodom and Gomorrah burnt his eyes
He survived to avenge them blind

Hollow-eyed breathes of plague
His warhorse of skin
And bones half decaved
Waving a sword with nine blades
Leaving Askengris skies in his wake

Testify my vanity
