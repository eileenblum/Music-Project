Years have passed since that night
Still the scars are fresh and alive for those involved
A mother deep underground
A father to a cell forever bound, the child nowhere to be found

Spiritual deception once showed its face, an evil passed on through its blood
A wicked grim incentive that cloudy day when horror stepped through their door

Journeyed to the east far and long ago
Once a feeble child but now has grown, still black in his soul
His uncle, the poor man worked hard yet unsuccessful
To feed his fatherâs leverage

Spiritual deception once showed its face, an evil passed on through its blood
A wicked grim incentive that cloudy day when horror stepped through their door

Meanwhile, aging in a bedlam, innocent still took the blame

He was sane when he entered but those walls drove him mad
Conjuring up a grave revengeÂ 
Kept his diary closest when he finally broke out
Time for them to alas reunite

Compelled to place his vengeance upon the bastard progeny, his only creed
As he arrived to the house old Damfee waiting outside

Gnawed and faint, leaning on his frayed cane

Damfee
âWhy did you come here?â

Father
âBring him before me, he must die
I shall have his head, you cannot deny me thatâ

The old man grinned and whispered
âThings are not all what they seem, I once brought forth a demon
That had its way with your wife one night, her uterus defiled
Raped by the demon, befouled all heavenâs light
Please close your eyes and come inside my homeâ

He then followed Uncle Damfee, when he looked there was a rancid setting
Everything was just appallingly dirty, in front of him stood the lost child
In frustration he attacked the androgynous child of evil
In the background there stood Damfee chuckling at the whole damned spectacle

All turned black âtil he later woke up
In his cell with the padded walls that he once left, was it a dream?
Ripped out was a diary pageÂ 
On it written all that happened in that godless phase, in someone elseâs
hand-writing

Spiritual deception once showed its face, an evil passed on through its blood
A wicked grim incentive that cloudy day when horror stepped through their door
