How did I get here, surrounded by snow
Strong winds keep tearing the flesh off my bones
Frost and cold wants my soul, thrown into a blizzard led by crows
I hear them croaking to taunt my unfair demise

Finally I give up all my strengthÂ 
Thereâs no point resisting when Iâm dazed and lost forever in this white and
wintry hell
Then I see what looks to be a light
Could it mean salvation, I start crawling towards it unbeknown of its purpose
and plan

On my hands and knees I pull myself, my muscles ache from the storm
My heart is pounding hard and out of time
Then I see the light as I lie there rippedÂ 
Vanish out of sight, down the entrance to a crypt
Down the hole I go into the unknown

Slapped in the face by the smell, itâs so foul and hints something evil here
dwells
Still I keep going for what could be worse than the weather outside
Seemingly this place should be a peaceful haven
I keep pressing but where is the light that saved me
Getting further down the dungeons narrow passage
Fail to realize the gate behind me closing

I light up a match to find myself covered in blood spattered cloth
Something is telling me Iâm not alone in this wretched sewer

A puff of air blows out my tiny flame
As a snorting, gnarling sound approaches me fast
From every direction, this is it
Cornered by a horde of godless creatures, canât flee

I see myself get massacred, disjointed by these entities of demon
Their glowing eyes lights up my death bed
Tears me up and leaves me gutted, seems they found it inside my dead body
My soul was all they wanted in the end
