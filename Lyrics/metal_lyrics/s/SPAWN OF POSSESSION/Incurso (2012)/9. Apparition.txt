Heavily secluded from all but faith, a family in hiding from the worldÂ 
Firm praying, blind loyalty, reciting words divine, from the eldest to the
youngest one
Their sheer belief in the sonâs return, if not stayed true, in the abyss would
burn

The apparition, a messenger of the eternal scripture
Phantom of shine, disembodied and descent of heaven
The apparition, her appearance was so realÂ 
Without suspicion, all the prayers of the family were finally heard

On a humid spring evening when the idyll couldnât be more perfect
Out from their flower garden, through the blinders came an overwhelming light

They gathered on the porch and stood and watched in awe
Angelic deity, so clean, like the purest dream
Their fingers laced together, as they dropped to their knees worshipping
Happy pearly tears, oh such beauty lives

Sweet angels dei look up on me, the apparition spoke with a silky yet whirring
voice of wonder
You have been faithful to the omnipotent, I come to grant you a challenge of
life
Time to show your true worth to the Lord

A paradise awaits the few undoubtingÂ 
To measure up and prove them self abiding
Fulfill the needs of dominus

Then it disappeared, the unearthly seer, left the witnesses impaired
Now they knew for sure that praying was the door to his holinessâ embrace
The parents and younglings went inside and began chanting pages
In front of the altar that they had built next to the tepid white tile store

The apparition, she came and gave them hope
The apparition, why would she dupe, poor the people thought

Their black bound bible got scrutinized, inside the fatherâs head a voice would
rise

Which said
An unbeliever (the filthy child) among your flock (I order you to punish)
Your scrupling daughter (that whoring freak) is against us (and make her bleed)

He yanked her arm and pulled her outside, shoved her to the dirty wall of the
tool shed
While hearing the apparition
Whipped her good âtil it got messy, grabbed an axe he was steered by frenzyÂ 
Just do it the voice kept ranting

As he cut away his little girl, someone walked up behind him screaming begging
Cried in panicÂ 
He turned around and saw his loving wife, without a blink he then knew to
attack herÂ 
Voice kept praising
Feeding her the hatchet as the apparition kept applauding the spouseâs
onslaughter
Limbs was flying
The only child remaining was his body who saw the whole thing from the kitchen
window
Shocked in terror

Then the voice said I shall appear, you have proven yourself worthy
Bring me the last life of your family
Called the boy out then came the light, there it was the apparition
Reached out for his traumatized sonâs small hand
Free from sin youâll come with me

The apparition, a messenger of the eternal scripture
Phantom of shine, disembodied and descent of heaven
The apparition, her appearance was so realÂ 
Without suspicion, all the prayers of the family were finally

The apparition changed form into a contorted creature
Held the child in its bosom and vanished in a laughter
The father now roams around the little flower gardenÂ 
Godâs work he did it with pride, the final lock on the gate is now open
