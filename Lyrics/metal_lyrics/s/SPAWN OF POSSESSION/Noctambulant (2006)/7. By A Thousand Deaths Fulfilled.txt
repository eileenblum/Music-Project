[Words by Renvaktar, Music by Bryssling / Karlsson / RÃ¶ndum]

My cloven tongue speak such words of silk, Irresistible
I sow dreams, lies they will want to swallow, they give while I collect.
Affection, pleasures so forbidden only the strong can withstand and endure.

Predatorily instincts, find the right type of lust.
Needed for my cause I contract scavengers, beggars, murderers and whores.
The scum of this earth is to be the foundation of my ascent
Feed my glory, my wisdom now.

By a power strong and intense I've been selected.
To concur and seduce, once a pawn but soon to rule in glory divine, in glory divine.

With my serpent eyes I acquire love and with the strongest hands demand all obedience.
A thousand lives for one

Freely given through their pain I'll reap what I have planted in this sour soil.
And my grave will shed light upon the forsaken.

The Icon in my own congregation I am.
I enter my podium encircled by outcasts.
My apostles and lovers all those cheerful faces.
Hysterically laughing their way through this hymn to my person.

By a thousand deaths fulfilled.

[Solo: Karlsson]

When I open my mouth to speak they'll engulf my words life dogs, screaming.
Shouting prayers directed towards the one and I, whom are far superior.

I taste the energy flowing from a thousand naked, beaten creeps, sweaty limbs entwined.
A mass of feasting flesh, Individuality at last abandoned.

Differences erased as my children adjoin through blood and bondage.
Entangled, thousands turned to one.
A collective mind under my control lead by my will, kneeled before me
By a thousand deaths fulfilled.
