[Words by RÃ¶ndum, Music by Bryssling / RÃ¶ndum]

Silently I step unto my faith, I feel acceptance now, a righteous path they'll grant.
Slavery is all I leave behind, the weak are silent now, bowed down in their own filth.

Across realms never travelled, rupturing climates, the sun is lost
Dragged through this endless gate, the unseen guides whispers for the unseen way.
Breathless air infuse me, calm I absorb the chilling wind.
Black is what lies ahead, in fear I am no more, I shall greet its pain.

Luminous at last, my broken soul with torn off wings through spiteful greed I shall find peace.
In my own greed.
I seek what I should dread, longing for the kingdom high, the promise left to serve my kind.
In my own greed.

Shielded from, the past I leave behind, another day is rising and in its womb, my desire.
The gift, sent that I possess, arried with pride, earned before this time.
Death, inept to claim my stained soul, this journey I have tekn, swept me before its hands
In life came clarity at last, I am of the forgotten, my spirit is dead.

[Solo: Karlsson]

Blinding lights as one to be reborn, uplifted and redeemed, my being their spawn.

[Solo: Karlsson]

I'm the beast that ate my putrid soul in conflict with the earthly, the fleas of mass disgrace.
Harmony, of which I have been robbed, my course is sacrilegious, I honour every step.

Treading forth as I realize I am there to dwell in my might, come solitude.
Seasons passed in my wondering lost for words, perpetual I shall remain.

[Solo: Karlsson]

Luminous at last, my broken soul with torn off wings through spiteful greed I shall find peace.
In my own greed.
I seek what I should dread, longing for the kingdom high, the promise left to serve my kind.
In my own greed, it shall so be.
