The birth of the child was observed to provide a spirit unknown with a body
The mind it was damaged to shreds ripped apart but the flesh of the spawned one was captured

From beyond, terminal, evil is born, plucked from god, without stop
-the rites of possession begun
Now awake, not of life, born in hate, sent to feed, demon horns
-the omen`s been shown

With age it grew on pain it feed at last it was fertile to spread it`s
offspring
The soul got sick in never seen ways uncontrolled by the illspiritual rage

A craft was brought to split the visions
Crawling naked on the floor, exorcist fleed for the door,
Tried to outrun the unclean whore
Possession in a wicked way, unholy powers drained the rests of it in pain
Followed the abomination
The light that was did disappear, it vanished into the thin air,
A dirty atmosphere
Possession in a wicked way, unholy powers drained the fucking soul in pain

The soul ripped to pieces - Evil Demon
The senses won`t escape it - Evil Demon
Hateful obsession - Evil Demon
Spawn of Possession - Evil Demon

[Solo : Karlsson]

The frenzy will got twisted and dim
The muscles stopped obey the force, the mind shutted out the speaking
voice,
He felt a change and got a choice
Possession in a wicked way, unholy powers drained the rests of it in pain
A sudden life flash altered the course
He couldn`t stand the pain no more, the shotgun end went down his throat,
One trigger pull would have end the mourn
Possession in a wicked way, unholy powers drain the fucking soul in pain

It didn`t get messy they got to him first against his will strapped in a jacket
Thrown in a cell and declared as insane wacked through the calming injections

From beyond, terminal, evil is born, plucked from god, without stop
-the rites of possession begun
Now awake, not of life, born in hate, sent to feed, demon horns
-the omen`s been shown

No cure was found and the question remained what would cause this insistent aggression
For the one that is born through the darkness impure - Spawn of Possession

The soul ripped to pieces - Evil Demon
The senses can`t escape it - Evil Demon
Hateful obsession - Evil Demon
Spawn of Possession - Evil Demon
