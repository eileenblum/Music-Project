Haunted ground of evil soil was placed on this earth
The fool of man intruded its core
Despite these facts a house was built

The one supposed to be above can't
Undo what the evil has already done
Within these walls of dirty death the
Reign of unholy is spawned
The family happy, with joy in their eyes
Unlocked it and brought it to life
For now they will desecrate something
Untouched and evil shall suffer their son

"Written in blood"
"Disgrace your father, pigs"

The boy was marked the force of old wanted his soul
He felt it, coming as it took control
Beyond all penance, the boy was bound to serve

Screaming, convulsing from the pain
The boy is now possessed by the house

Window, infested with flying vermin
Stalking, feel it's all around can't touch it
Voices, tell him to obliterate his family

"Look at them, they're pathetic"
"Kill them, you worthless swine"

Believing the words that were spoken
The house gave him strength to make it happen
He did it at night while they were sleeping
To fire the gun felt overwhelming
The familty stood without protection, for the
Amityville horror was now upon them

The one supposed to be above can't
Undo what the evil has already done
Within these walls of dirty death
The reign of unholy is spawned
It came from the cellar deep down
From its core and held them in its fatal grip
For the bastard creation a spirit
Unknown is entombed in the bowels within
