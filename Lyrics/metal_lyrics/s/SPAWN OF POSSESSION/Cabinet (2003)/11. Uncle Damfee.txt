Darkened clouds was watching over the house
Father sleeping mother reading
From the good book to their child

Mother's in the rockinchair
By the fireplace reaching a fanatic stage
Preaching load and clear the words of delight
The child suppose to take pleasure instead
Felt sick and distressed

Glimpsed the axe, getting up from teh bed, grabs the tool get that crone
Unaware of he child behind the mother kept
Babbling while the child raised the axe

Struck hard, struck fast, must punish parent
Burst the crown in pieces, walls got
Draped with substance
Starring without a word
Purified from mothers nagging with full force
The child kept striking
Litter was now disposed
Kissed the rest of her cheek
Dropped the axe and tore her bible
Feeling fine...

The child left the scene ran of into the woods to
Vanish while the daybreak kept coming
Father awoke as someone
Knocked on their door

Shocked by the sight
Outside stood the mob
That would lead
His persecution

Couldn't speak after what he had seen
Labeled insane and locked up in a dark asylum

The Diary....

Travelled east the child found warmth and shelter
Located its relative uncle Damfee
The child opened up and told its uncle its secret

Damfee said, with a nervous trembling voice
"He's been exposed the father of mine"
"I thought he was dead but obviously not, his spirit awoke"
