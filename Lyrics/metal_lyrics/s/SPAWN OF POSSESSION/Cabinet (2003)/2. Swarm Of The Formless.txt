Stricken from below, the inevitable travellers
A mighty demon horde, on wings
That brought them through the storms
Was no of this earth
Still it was not flesh they craved
The smell of human souls
Made them rage upon this world

Legion
The wrath of gods
Sent as formless hordes they swipe
Endless might, swarming
Steamed by pain to ravage earth
And claim its light

Fire strikes the earth as it
Commence non shall live
Chaos rage the world humans
Turning as they run
On abyssal command they
Punish the weak with their laws
They came to claim the throne as
They conquer every living soul

Legion
The wrath of gods
Sent as formless hordes they swipe
Endless might, swarming
Steamed by pain to ravage earth
And claim its light

Theough demonic penetration
The legion of the formless ones
Are swarming demigods
Spread like plague it withers the earth
The pain, the black, deeds of Pazuzu

Stricken from below, the inevitable travellers
A mighty demon horde, on wings
That brought them through the storms
Was no of this earth
Still it was not flesh they craved
The smell of human souls
Made them rage upon this world
