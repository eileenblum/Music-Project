Septic spirit establish birth
Gruesom and enormous pain it will inflict
Convulsion the breeding of a
Demon reached its final stage of tormentation

Rubbing my swollen throat
I feel a movement inside my chest
Dirty voices vocalize through my mouth
I am now a host
A premonition I never felt
It wants my body as I feel it working
Tearing withing an warp my screams

What I'm becoming I never knew was real
It slowly takes in charge
My skin is changing colour
My eyes are empty black
The soul I through was shining
Is deformed and strangely intact

Resistance is pointless I know it'll dominate
As I deliver my self to its domains
"Hidden in flesh"

Scratching my skin from the inside
I snort, I foam, I bleed through my eyes
Hidden in my flesh I know it's real
Ravished my soul
Time to set out on a killing spree

I kill against my will
My soul has showed me true abomination
They're not much of a choice
I try to fight it but my weird
Movements is beyond my control

Rubbing my swollen throat
I feel a movement inside my chest
I killed those people, steered
By evil I slay, can't stop my actions
I am soon to die for all I
Care there's no heaven for me
For it lies hidden deep down in my soon rotting flesh
