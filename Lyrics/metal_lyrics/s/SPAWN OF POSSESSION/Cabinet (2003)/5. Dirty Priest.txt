A rotten unclean spirit deep inside a host to the depraved
Grime embrace the thoughts
Beyond the goodness of this world appears a deformed grotesque
To hell it takes the soul

Try to take away the darkness psalms are read to make it vanish
Evil forces now are in this soulless fucking body
P o s s e s s i o n
Kiss the cross the priest is chanting fuck your god the demon whisper
I will make this body see the suicide temptation

An unclean spirit dwells deep in this heart
It kills the dirty priest of evil cause
God`s man lies soakt in blood he`ll never live
The blade is pointed right there between ribs

[Solo : Karlsson]

Unearthly will
A covenant with darkness eyes are starring black o so cold so dead
The knife is hacking holes into the stinking flesh of the dirty priest so
die
Suffer the demonic possession
Blasphemy has cleansed him it`s time to cut the head of the pig the priest
A lunatic of evil no remorse when he kills himself no tears just kill

[Solo : Bryssling]

[Solo : Karlsson]

Shadows cover the filthy body he`s soul now rests in gore
Demons takes the whore
The reverend seemes to be possessed reborn unpurely spawn
To a wicked force unknown

An unclean spirit dwells deep in this heart
It kills the dirty priest of evil cause
God`s man lies soakt in blood there is no life
The stabs within his chest cuts from a knife

Tried to take away the darkness psalms were read to make it vanish
Evil forces now possess this soulless fucking body
P o s s e s s i o n
Kiss the cross the priest was chanting fuck your god the demon whispered
I have made this body see the suicide liberation
