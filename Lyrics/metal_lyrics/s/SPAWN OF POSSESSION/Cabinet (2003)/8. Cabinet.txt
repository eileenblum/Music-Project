Years of strain, obsolete forgotten, but was never dead
Rise from the ash of hatred
Haunting ways kept alive in secrecy, from the light of day
Mankind behold possession

The ones that was not did return in an order to perform
Nothing but a relentless havoc
Forces insurgent - nothing shall persist
Ruthless ways of ancients scourge
The souls of those believed to conquer
Wicked infliction - from the cabinet

Forged through deep affliction, demons in shape of angels deceive
Those who dream of the cabinet
Sweating their sheets as they know it's real

No one can rid this evil
Churning the spirits

A slumber in fear
Abomination reveals tales from a sickened crucifix
Pulse is rising fast, can not wake up at all, something has occupied the dormant soul

Redeem
It fears the light, hides within the mind alive deep inside
As it perminates, closer to insanity
Visions of rapid lights, another dimension opens wide

A gaze of shade by night it came
Never would a simple human understand
The evil that was spawned within the cabinet
A realm concealed that no one leaves
The mind forever trapped in a catatonic state
But while the body sleeps the soul gets ripped to shreds

A world of dark a place that never leaves a soul to find peace
Darkness everywhere timeless voids beholds this plane of nocturnal

The ones that was not did return in an order to perform
Nothing but a relentless havoc
Forces insurgent - nothing shall persist
Ruthless ways of ancients scourge
The souls of those believed to conquer
Wicked infliction - from the cabinet
