Time to satisfy your appetite
Time for human misery
Rest in pain, insanity
Believe it's life's reality

Dead or alive
Permission to survive
Two thousand years of misery
Don't believe in sanity

We march through the colonies
We march towars the enemies
Our moral never fades away
We are the soldiers of Mars

Punished by the glaring lights
By ecstasy and pain
Emotions
I'm prepared to become merely insane
On towars the relicts
You have glorified one day
I can see the dustclouds
I can see us fade away

Turning
The wheels of life, the wheels of steel are burning
Contortion
All those bad days really killed emotions

So move
The Tomb
