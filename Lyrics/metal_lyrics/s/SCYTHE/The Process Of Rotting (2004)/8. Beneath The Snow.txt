Beneath the sun in this endless black
I tried to speak a word but I'm never comin' back again
Never comin' back to the places of delight
I am wisdom, this world sucks
Now I am aware, I wasn't sleeping in the past
Completely forgotten oblivion recovers
Years and years are going by blackbells the Darwinism
Oblivion recovers, nothing here remains
Growing in my mind
Fear the time of my returning
Wisdom comes with energy
Under the sun
I am blinded, thrown into darkness
We are fallin' away from ourselves
I am blinded, too dumb to hear yeah
Nothingness, nothingness, nothingness remains
Everyday the same things not to see the sun
Captured here forever until the world is gone
Break out from your chains it's time to be yeah
See the ridiculous ones
I am blinded, thrown into darkness
We are fallin' away from ourselves
I am blinded, too dumb to hear yeah
Nothingness remains
Everyday's the same
