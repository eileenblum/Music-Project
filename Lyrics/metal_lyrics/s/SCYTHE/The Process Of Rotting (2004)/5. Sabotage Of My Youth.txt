I invoked this life somewhere below my feet
Decided to go through this world alone
I can't understand what all the fightings for
Can you tell me all the wrong things I have done?
Sabotage, sabotage where are you?
Faults, mistakes, manipulation
Years when I was searching for directions are mistaken
Sabotage of my youth

Can you imagine how I loved you darlin`
The whole time, the whole length of my youth
Can you remember how it was like
To redecline again...

I can see reflections of my past
Many people when I look around
Faults, mistakes, manipulation
But I can't see you and me anywhere
Sabotage, sabotage where are you?
Faults, mistakes, manipulation
Years when I was searching for directions are mistaken
Sabotage of my youth

You are a bright light, love and lust
A brainstorm in my head
I can't express my feelings
Words are much too weak for that
Suffer, endless mourning
A flower for my sadness
I can't express my feelings
Words are much too weak for that
