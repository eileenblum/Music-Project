Through snow you walk in silent thoughts
The frozen scream on the fields of winter
Demanding in strenght your last desire
Emotions like fire

Wandering through times of sorrow
Only to reach this enjoyable fun
"Hinter den Bergen siehst Du die Sonne"
Son of the winter

Emotions like fire
Just like once in your life
You're looking straight stranger
And I rise cause my dream has come
Son of the winter
The fortress is the place you we're born
Once in early times
Son of the winter

And after your journey the miracle will happen
You'll arrive during the night
And now no more darkness will surround you
You are the light
This night you are the one
And even now you have to go on again
Protection is you moral
Son of the winter

Gestern schaute ich gen Himmel
Ich sah die Sterne am klaren Horizont
Ich ging allein durch warme Sommern'chte
Zu schaffen mir Erinnerungen
Unsere Zielle unerreicht
Von dannen gezogen in stillem Hass
Gebeutelt von Jahren des Grams
In die Knie gezwungen
Zu sehen was wahr ist
Rache...

Emotions like fire
Just like once in your life
You're looking straight forward
And I rise cause my dream has come
