Spent the days disobedient to the crowd
Learned to dislike, learning to hide
Spending the days in disharmony
Disgust is the key

(Spending your life in pain [repeat])

Deeper and deeper into a vortex of fear
Disillusions plot my way
Spending the days in disharmony
Bring dishonour upon them

Spent the days disobedient to the mass
Learned to dislike, learning to hide
Spending the days in disharmony
Spending the night in pain

Years ago in the light of day
I realized a path in the snow Many days were falling to the ground
Guide of the night you are the master

Disinclination
