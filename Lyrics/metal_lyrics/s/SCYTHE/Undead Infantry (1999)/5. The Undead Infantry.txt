The Darkened Shape Has Embraced The World
And Brings Out In The Open The Dreams Of The Dead
By Ruling This Earth On The Living To Fulfill The Enrichment Of Power
The World In Chaos People Flee
Religious Fucks Try To Escape The Endless Count Of Loyal Shells
Shedding Blood As A Well Spring From Which Will Be Spelt
The Remaining Christians In Denial
That The World's Been Handed To Lord Belial
All Dead Now Bow To The Chaotic Kings
And Rot In The Darkest Heart Of The Flames
Untold Prophecies Unfold To Thee
The Deceased All Form The Undead Infantries
Promises Told To Us Have Been Centuries Of Lies
God Ignores Us As Belial's Army Rapes The Earth Of Its Life
Ancient Kings Bless Thee For Possessing Me
My Body Roams The Earth Freed To Join Your Minions Creating The Necropolis 
Cities
Our Souls Left To Die And Wither Away
Hear The Thousands Of Corpses Cry Over The Empty Graves That They All Left 
Behind
Numberless Servants To The Arch Fiend Unite
Sacrifices Endless Towards The Banishment Of Light
The Undead Will Fight Until The Last Christians Die
As The Lord Forms The Goat They Kill Us With Pride
Come Forward Cowards Your Souls Have Been Denied
Come Forward Humans Of Unwanted Wastes Of Time
Come Forward Sinners Now Granted The Ability To Help Destroy This World
And Create The Necropolis Cities
