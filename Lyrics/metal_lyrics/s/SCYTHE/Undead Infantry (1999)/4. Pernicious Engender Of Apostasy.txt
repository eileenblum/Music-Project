As Life Seemed To Transcend Us All
Destruction Lied In The Path Of Redemption
It Was They Who Had Brought Forth Religions
To Convince Us All Of A Superior Being That Had No Existence
Why Have You Not Compelled To Dominate And Drain Us All
Our Minds Controlled By The Impure Thoughts Of Actually Being Saved At All
Lurid Thoughts That Recreate In The Minds Of These Beings
We Won't Be Resistant If You Plan To Kill Us All
The Vampiric Nocturnal Breed Has Beckoned Me
From The Orbital Heavens Above We Shall Soon
Be The Next Victims Of This Blood Lusting Species
And Become The Life Pods For Their Blood Letting Savagery
The Vampiric Nocturnal Breed Has Beckoned Me And I Endure The Impurity
Once We Reach The Altar In Power This Was Written
Their Warfare Will Surround Us And Kill Us
Why Have You Not Compelled To Dominate And Drain Us All
Our Minds Now Controlled By The Impure Thoughts
Of Those Lurid Thoughts That Recreate In The Minds Of These Beings
We Can't Be Resistant If You Plan To Kill Us All
From The Orbital Abyss They Brought We The Populace Eternity
So What God Do I Await Then If Wiped Away Or Brought Me The Sacred One
