Oblivious To The Silence
It's Time To Awaken
The Fumes Of Souls Being Inhaled By Satan
At The Moment Of Unconsciousness
The Horns Of The Uncremated Pierce Throughout The Embers
And Stabs Them With Anger
For Thinking They Might Get Mercy The Flames Arise
And The Burning Souls Remain Awake Moaning In Pain And Sorrow
Regretting The Lives They Didn't Ask For
Not Taking For Granted The Promises That Could Only Be Given
Or Granted To Us By Our Lord Satan
In Despite Of Faith They Had When They Were Living
The Unholy Son Could Have Handed Them Any Life
That They Wanted To Be Given
But The Burdens Of Their Bloodshed Had Fled Them All Into The Pit
The Foolish Mortals Had The Chance To Sell Their Souls
Instead They Chose To Suffer On This Pathetic Earth
And Pray To The Fag Who Won't Save Them Now Cause They All Been Cursed
They All Lived Lives Of Excrement Spit Upon By Mankind
Shunned Away From Humanity
And Ended Up Killing Themselves In The Search For God
The Moaning From Hell Grows Louder As They Witness
The Arrival Of The New Tortured Souls As The Master Fiend Prepares For War
He Swore He'd Bring Life To His Plan Of Brutality
At First They All Had Faith Until They Were Forsaken
Satan Lied Beneath Them All Waiting For Them
To Have Their Souls Taken For Cursing The Holy One
For Stabbing Themselves With Their Crucifix
For Thinking If They Killed Themselves They Would End It All
But Now They Al Will Suffer Underneath This Pathetic Earth
And Pray To The Fag Who Can't Save Them Cause They All Been Cursed
They All Lived Lives Of Excrement Spit Upon By Mankind
Shunned Away From Humanity
And Ended Up Killing Themselves In The Search Of God
The Moaning From Hell Grows Louder Now As They Witness
The Arrival Of The New Tortured Souls As The Master Prepares For War
He Swore He'd Bring Life To This Plague Called Mortality
Demons Wade Through The Souls That Remain Aglow
In The Blood Red Ocean Of Sorrow
The Spirit Inside You Don't Mean Shit
It's Now Time To Give Yourself Up To Satan
