Fire! Lights the night - ablazin'in the Nothern sky
Vastlands in my mind - suffocation, morninglight
Castlewals are sleeping - silent eternity
Abyss of the night called darkness

Frozen in years
Silence remains
Pasttime forever...

Darkness is my guide through the everlasting woods
Frozen dreams of pain arise
I will roam with my horse tonight
I'll enter the castle once again

Frozen in years
Silence remains
Pasttime forever...

Darkness is my guide through the everlasting woods
Frozen dreams of pain arise
I will roam with my horse tonight

Frozen in years
Silence remains
Pasttime forever...
