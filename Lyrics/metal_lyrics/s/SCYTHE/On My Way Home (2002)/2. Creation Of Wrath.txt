Anger I experienced my whole life
Faced with hate now one more time
Suffering from the influence of other ones
I don't wanna live like that

Hope it dies at last but has already passed away
Creation of wrath
I don't want to speak no longer in your face
Time is going by
Creation,
Creation of wrath
Ruin
Of the weak

Punishment is in my eye
Re-decline - so do I
I never wanted to be a part of this shit
I never asked for fame
Creation,
Creation of wrath
Ruin
Of the weak

Creation of wrath - Ruin of the weak

I hold the banner in my strong hands
I wish the past to return
I implore the night to begin
Again
Anger I experienced my whole life
Faced with hate now one more time
Suffering from the influence of otherones
I don't wanna live like that

Creation of wrath
