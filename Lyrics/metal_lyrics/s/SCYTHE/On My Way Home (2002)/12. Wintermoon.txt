One day while arising from the mountains of frost
You will see the vanished sun and soon
And soon you will find the answer
You will find it in the wintermoon

On from the fog through the forest
With the glaring frost in your neck
Through the times after black winterclouds
On the way ... back...

One day while returning from the botton of life
And you'll see the sun again
The tune that's following the spirit of night
As I see my one again

I'm back with the remains of a glorious time
And keep on walkin' through the coldness
Keep on walkin' through the coldness
Keep on walkin'...
