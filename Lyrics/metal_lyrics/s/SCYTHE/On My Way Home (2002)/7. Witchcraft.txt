Woods of darkness I have to bring you a gift
The everlasting youth, the childhooddreams again
Nowhereland returns again, frozen times forever
You are my desire
Sunset prepares me for the long way
Through the mist and the depths of this forest
Vast mountainsides appear in darkness
Witchcraft is the blood

Novembermoon freezes the air and my lust
Nocturnal emotions arising in eternal nights
Aimless, bloodless, forever
Aimless, bloodless, forever

I, a bird in the night
A flower in the moonfog
A light in the sky
A wizard in the wind

Witchcraft is my desire
Is my destiny
Is my karma...
