Shadows and doubts and dispair
Unholy words in my ear, circeling through the spheres
Glaring lights of gloom
There is no tomorrow
Once in the past
I was the light
Passing through the days of live now...

Come out to see it's all myself
Who is insanity, embodies the darkness

Time will never roam again
This darkness is leading me to myself

Sorrowdreams - it's in myself
The yearning for shadows in the dark

Look around - it's nothin'but this emptiness
I have experienced

Running - the forest is the dark
Be sure you'll come to an end before life starts
Drifting - becoming a part of the old
Nowhereland is alive
Alive...

Memories - rooted in the past
Nocturnity - is the future
Drifting - becoming a part of the old
Nowhereland is alive
Alive...

Shadows and doubts and dispair
Unholy words in my ear, circeling through the spheres
Glaring lights of gloom
There is no tomorrow
Once in the past
I was the light
Passing through the days of live now...

Fading away - this is the end of suffer
The winter is leading you to solutions
Summerskies of blue
This is the future
Future...
