Moments of sorrow - burnin'tears on my face
A moment of emptyness - thoughtless dispair
In the evening darkness comes over the land
Silence in the forest...

In the distance a thunderstorm
The stars and the fullmoon shine on the path

Winter cold and frosty in my veins
Captured in my body...

(I am free)

Death - the end of life is reality
Reality's when we die
Mighty Lord of the woods have mercy with me
Remember how little we are

Screams in an empty room - screams of pain and sorrow
The anguish of past so clear and near
In the evening darkness comes over the land
And brings the truth upon us

In the distance a thunderstorm
The stars and the fullmoon shine on the path

Winter cold and frosty in my veins
Sea of Rhun

Rhun
