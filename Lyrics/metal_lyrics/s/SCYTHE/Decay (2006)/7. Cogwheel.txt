Time...
A little thing that I call my mind
You and I just to stay a while
Years of silence, sleeping and decay
Stay with me just another day
For I become fulfillment, strong and calm...

Whatever - Times are changing
Whenever - Years are breaking
Wherever - I wake up so
I am just a cogwheel in this world

Seas of silence and decay
It is just, just another day
And I am able just to walk on...

Whatever - Times are changing
Whenever - Years are breaking
Wherever - I wake up so
I am just a cogwheel in this world

Dreams...
Nothing seems to be unreal now
Waking up, walking back somehow
I see myself free now in this maze
So I am here to stay...

Whatever - Times are changing
Whenever - Years are breaking
Wherever - I wake up so
I am just a cogwheel in this world
