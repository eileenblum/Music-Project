Somewhere in between I found the silence
I found a place of calm for you and me
And I, I am a bird
In this place I decided to stay with you all night

And there's no pain but calm
Everything turned out to be silent
I decide to run
Running away from what it's worth to live
To run means to keep the truth away
Let us run from where we're from - once

A glimpse of the eastern sunrise
Through the valleys, through the vastlands of fire
And I, I am a bird
I can see now
And death becomes a friend
I am one with all
My hands are cold but I can see...

A glimpse of the eastern sunrise
Through the valleys, through the vastlands of fire
And I , I am a bird
I can see now
And death becomes a friend
I am one with all
My hands are cold but I can see...
Everything is silent
but I have the key to live
See what this has made with me

See what this has made with me
See what I became throughout these years
See what this has made with me
I cannot live; I have failed

It took so long to realize
Things might change with future days

I'm not running away...

Somewhere in between
I found a place of calm
And I decided to live
Again from now on

...somewhere in between

Children sleep
And nothing more
And like the sun
We are one
From now on
We control
And I have told you
Not to go
In this place of calm we stay
Nothing more to hear or say
And I am one,
I am one with all...
Sweat and tears
Years and years
The grief of life
And nothing's left
For you and I
We decide to stay

Now I am little more
I only have to choose noone at all
I won't believe a single word
But still I know the right way to get home...
