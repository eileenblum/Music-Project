My illness was grief
I was amazed
How bad things turned out to be
No time for myself
No time for anyone in this world

Regretting my life
Regretting my failure
Of being right here in this place
And nobody could ever imagine
How bad things turned out to be

And noone can enter my world
Noone is seeing this maze
It's still a part of myself
I am running away

Running into a maze
Entering I was amazed once
Everlasting pain in myself
Noone could imagine this world
Can you see me right here?
Can you tell me this world?
Unable to see
Through the walls beyond my days

Running away
Starting my day
In the mist of loss
Nothing of me sees this world

Waking up in my cell
Help me out this is my personal hell
Everyday is lost so stay with me
Inside my walls of pain
I have everything to lose
Noone has patience with me
I am the loss of this world
So tell me what it's all worth
Walking up and down my cell
The whole day is gone
Years of patience and regret
I'm still suffering from it
And noone seems to be amazed

Running away
Starting my day
In the mist of loss
Nothing of me sees this world...

Trying, help me out again...

I wake up
What have I become?
One day I will be here again
In this world my son
I have faith in future days
I have nothing more to say
Tell me where the sunrise's gone
I can see nothing at all...

Sound of silence tell me more

On my way home...
