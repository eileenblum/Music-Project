Sun of sadness I am on my way to you
27 falls have we spent together in this world
I am here to stay, I have to run away
I am here to play, I am here to call the black rose mine

Pretending not to see - Nothing seems to be unreal

A fleeting glimpse you saved - I thought it was your reflection
Don't be worried we all have to pay - I am not better at all
And noone could imagine myself - Pretending not to see
A fleeting glimpse you saved from me - This night I will mourn
I will mourn...

I will stand above all - Can you see myself in tears today?
Son of sadness we all have to pay - Today, tomorrow we all have to pay
I'm not here to play - I am here to call the black rose mine
I will mourn...
