Morninglight had come not it's the end
Don't have any reason to be me
The first and painful part of my revenge - Estranged
Worlds still burning feel my vengeance - now...

Summer rain... the bitterness of years, read my lips
Nothing to fear as long as you're afraid...

Starting my journey through this world
Unafraid of all the things tomorrow might bring, so be aware!
Tearing down my enemies with pain
Unafraid of all the things tomorrow might bring, so watch this game!

Confusing moments are the key
Now slay them all down in your revenge
I never had the time to be myself, no time to breathe
Doors are closed now, you have failed
It's my turn to slay them down
With bitterness of years
I know what it means to feel this solitude and grief
And now be sure I will return my pain

I'll release my pain so be aware
Take a look around everything's gone away
It doesn't matter how for you and me
So I won't be afraid of things to come
Now it's my turn to slay them down
With bitterness of years
I know what it means to feel this solitude and grief
And now be sure I will return my pain

A whispering noise I can hear now
Tunes are new to me

Waking up in another time
Days are passing by
Never again you will realize
The pain...
I do not belong to this place
No longer be amazed
Glad to see some people
Never ever again

Now it's my turn to slay them down
With bitterness of years
I know what it means to feel this solitude and grief
And now be sure I will return my pain

Starting my journey through this world
Unafraid of all the things tomorrow might bring, so be aware!
Tearing down my enemies with pain
Unafraid of all the things tomorrow might bring, so watch this game!

Morninglight had come not it's the end
Don't have any reason to be me
The first and painful part of my revenge - Estranged
Worlds still burning feel my vengeance - now...

I don't have a reason to believe
Won't forget about what used to be
Morning light will come to bring an end
Today
World's still burning feel my vengeance
DEATH!
