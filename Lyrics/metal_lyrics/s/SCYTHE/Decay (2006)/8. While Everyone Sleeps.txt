Towards the past I run
I am still noone
And beneath the sun
Everyone is calling my name

Weeping, crying - Suffering all day
I am here so why not run away?

Remembering - I have faith in future days...
Believing in myself - I have the change to run away from here

Labyrinths, autumn and myself
Through the mist I walk in silence - From now on...

Starting my way while everyone sleeps
Changing times have I seen throughout these years
I am living but I do not see - I am hiding so I can be
Suffering all day in this eternal maze
With this state of mind I lived for years
While the world changed I was not there - I am still away from here...
