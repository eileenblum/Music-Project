It's time to know
It's time to turn around
I decline
I am on my run again

And everyone
has changed their mind somehow
I am here tonight
to stay with you again

I am waiting
Soon escaping out of me...
I am wondering
I am someone else I see...

Days go by
It's time to turn around
Clouds are here
I cannot see the light of day

No matter what
No matter how
It's all about myself
I stop to hide away

I am waiting
Soon escaping out of me...
I am wondering
I am someone else I see...

Anything that used to be
I still remember everything today
I won't forget a simple word
I want to lose my wrath
