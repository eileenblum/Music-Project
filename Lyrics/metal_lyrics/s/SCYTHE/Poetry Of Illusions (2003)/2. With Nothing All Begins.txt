Throwing myself into loneliness these days
Forced by everyone but nothing seems to be like once...

I have no direction in this game
I don't have to grow no longer
Nevermore

Nothing's where I had begun once
No more stories to hear
I don't have to grow no longer
I don't need noone 
Nevermore
Evermore

With nothing all begins
And all the dreams that vanish make me stronger in myself
I don't have to fear the future
Don't have to fear the lies 'cause I already have seen what's going on
afterwards...

Can you tell me what it means to you when you hear me saying that I love you since years?
I'm aware of the answer now, I went through it all
Through the emptiness of my life
Through the nothingness
I always promised you more
I always promised me more
More to have and more to see
And everything's impatient - the same with me

I don't have it in my hands
With nothing all begins
Summer's gone too soon
Pleasures much too short
Put out the light
I won't begin again
