This is about something that will never be
And never ever was
A special kind of something which we'll never experience
Nothing gives us the past

Neither hope nor future but present
Here and there hopeful, familiar faces
Something is in me
A vision of you and me

I remember us when we were young
I remember there's no return
But this has nothing to say because you'll remain in my memory

Dreams - now I catch the sun
Reality it has become my dream and the other way round
This is a part of our new hope for a life which is maybe new for us
To grow means to realize that time is running 
I remember us when we were young
But this has nothing to say because you will stay in my memory

A vision of you and me
