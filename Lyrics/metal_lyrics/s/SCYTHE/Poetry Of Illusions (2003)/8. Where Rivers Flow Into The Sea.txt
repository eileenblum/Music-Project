In times when I don't know why
whether to dream or to die tonight
Still I have one reason to stay
You are a river to me

I have seen the skies tonight
Also I have seen a sun - alive
Once I gave my world away
Now I have one reason to stay...

Yesterday has passed away 
Memories linger on in me
I will see it all again in spring
Nothing more passes away
Where rivers flow into the sea

Follow all the rivers to the sea
All will be another dream of you and me
In times when I don't know why
You are a river to me

I just need someone in my memory
I have no need for you physically...

Sorry for the time I wasn't here
You are a river to me
