Set me adrift
As a snow dressed memory
Seal me with your troubles
Encased by your misery

Watch me float away
As your pain subsides
The cold sea will engulf me
Bless you, love of my life

The snow soon turns to rain
And the chill permeates my skin
I'm crystallized in this frozen grave
Lost in a sepulcher of ice

We both knew what was right
And you knew all along
My death would bring us joy
How could we have waited so long?

Fashioned by blood and tears
All your efforts were in vain
We could have lived forever
But died just the same
