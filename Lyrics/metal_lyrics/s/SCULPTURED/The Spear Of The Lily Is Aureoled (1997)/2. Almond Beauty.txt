As the snow fell to freeze the moment
For a brief pause in our Winter sonnet
She looked up at me with her eyes
Her almond beauty had melt the ice

The harsh winds, began to chill
But with her warmth, my heart she did fill
The night's crystal showers had ceased to be
The snow was no match for her almond beauty

Your eyes gave life to the forlorn sky
A beam of sienna had burnt through the sky
Just like my heart, your flame runs deep
So warm the Earth, as you did me

Lay me down and take me in
And as the Earth warms us within
Your body molds unto mine
Like a single sculpture (standing, against time)

I lie beneath you, in awe of your light
Take me, hold me, have me, tonight...

Diamonds are frozen tears
Shattered upon the cold ground
Echo in their hollow silence
And sadness upon my weary frown

Meadows of frosted sweetness
Wars with Winter's winds
But, with her almond beauty
This season is brought to an end

Lay me down and take me in
And as the Earth warms us within
Your body molds unto mine
Like a single sculpture (standing, against time)
