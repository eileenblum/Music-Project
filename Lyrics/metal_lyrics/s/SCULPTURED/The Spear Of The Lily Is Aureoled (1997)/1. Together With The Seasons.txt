As Winter fades, and Summer begins
We lie embraced as light hits the
Garden Entangled in green vegetation
Swallowed by the Earth's rich ground

Leave mankind
Come join us in the Garden of life
Strip your human
Connect with buried ages

Dew surrounds us, like stars above
And chill greets the air
She says to me, "I hope we'll never go."
But we must prepare for the  Winter snow

Forget mankind
Come join us in the Garden of life
Wash away your human
Connect with buried ages

Here in the Garden
Away from it all
This life I know
Here in the Garden
Alone with her
Nothing can go wrong

What can we do to further remove ourselves,
from the shallow world of mankind,
while our world  grows so cold?

Being inside each other is no longer enough,
Winter's frost can cut in, and drifts
of his endless snow.

The pathways start to corrode, insect
and serpents have hid away.
Shall we join them and escape the cold?
As well as humanity?

Sweep away the dirt and take our last breath
Together lets sleep forever
Let this Garden be our elaborate tomb
And the roses our epitaph

Exit mankind
Come join us in the Garden of life
Murder your human
Connect with buried ages

Here in the Garden
Away from it all
This life I know
Here in the Garden
Alone with her
Just another forgotten age...
