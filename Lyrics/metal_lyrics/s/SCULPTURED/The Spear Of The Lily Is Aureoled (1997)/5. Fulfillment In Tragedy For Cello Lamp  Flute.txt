[Instrumental]

[This piece is strictly atonal, which means that there is no key, tonic or harmony employed through out the entire piece. Instead I have used a technique called "Twelve tone". This is a method of composing where all twelve tones of the musical scale are only related to one another. Not one note is more important than the other. Please take the time to allow yourself to become well acquainted with this piece and only then will you become one with the beauty and passion contained in atonal music.]
