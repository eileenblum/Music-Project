[words &amp; music by Don Anderson]

As it snowed, the efforts of his toil gave in 
To a white, crystal veil that blankets the dead 
Just as well, sometimes you couldn't look at them 
Snow covered all and the harvest would dream again 
He worked alone and the ground was so frozen and cold 
Later, many would be taken by his strength and vigor 
But all the more by the interiors of his psyche 
And the craftsmanship of his labor 
Time had granted many companions 
Upheaved from the Earth, sometimes in pieces 
Now assembled into a personal museum 
Dust covered all and he would never be alone again 
Can you not see the helplessness on his face? 
Condemn the man who was always alone 
He was no more a ghoul, than a pathetic angel 
Without a full appreciation of what he had done 
Can you not see the loneliness on his face 
He's better off dead, he should have never been born 
What now, what can be done? 
Burn the past and burn what could become
