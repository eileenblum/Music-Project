[music and lyrics by Don Anderson]

Wrapped in letters 
Glowing darker than before 
The world is full of sound 
Space and silence filled 
Bedrooms alight 
As dusk surrounds 
And chill smoothes the air 
Time is running out 
Did anyone see me? 
Had anyone notice me leave? 
I was gone by the early morning 
Left with the sun behind me 
Sirens filled the air 
As pages are swept with the wind 
Time had recycled 
Just keep your eyes on the sun 
Tears dampen the Earth 
Everyone dies 
All heads were in place 
As dust covered their eyes 
When day had turned over to night 
And under it's dark veil I had found 
I'd catch the sun by the early morning 
And be gone by it's golden peak 
The mornings dew had moistened the air 
And it had settled upon my brow 
The world seemed young and fresh 
Then a soft light appeared ahead (its time to run) 
Did anyone see me? 
Had anyone notice me leave? 
I was gone by the early morning 
Left with the sun chasing me
