[music and lyrics by Don Anderson]

This is why the morning is so beautiful 
Even though my stomach feels so ill 
I can see the sun peeking at me 
Anxious to dry the dew covered world 
And I sow myself into the Earth 
And my skin takes on the dirt 
And I bury my tears in the Earth 
As my blood feeds the world 
And I bury my tears in the Earth 
I live each day 
Digging myself away 
Buried beneath the sound 
Of time passing by 
What the sun took away 
Remains here today 
Alone in the world 
Embraced by the Earth 
The ground is richer at this time 
And the plants are green and damp with rebirth 
And I bathe myself in the Earth 
And my skin becomes the dirt 
And I bury my tears in the Earth 
As my blood drowns the world 
And I bury my tears in the Earth 
I live each day 
Digging myself away 
Buried beneath the sound  
Of time passing by 
What the sun took away 
Remains here today 
Alone in the world 
Embraced by the Earth 
I live each day 
Digging my grave 
To rest beneath the ground 
While time begins again 
Once the ages are rebuilt 
As they were before 
The sun will be watching 
And morning will fall again
