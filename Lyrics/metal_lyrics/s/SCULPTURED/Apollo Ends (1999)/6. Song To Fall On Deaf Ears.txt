[music &amp; lyrics by Don Anderson]

This is a song to fall on deaf ears 
And these are words not meant for you to hear 
If sound is the death of silence 
I had hoped that you'd stay for the evening 
Then I am constantly in mourning 
I had planned to wake you by the early morning 

If sound is the death of silence 
Then I am constantly in mourning 
This is a song to fall on deaf ears 
Have you ever seen the sun rise? 
And these are words not meant for you to hear 
Have you ever felt so sick in your life?
