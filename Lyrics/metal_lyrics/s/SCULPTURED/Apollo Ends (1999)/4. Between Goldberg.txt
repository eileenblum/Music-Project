[music &amp; lyrics by Don Anderson]

Goldberg's variations had permitted sleep 
And the turning in my stomach had awakened me 
The dim blue light through my window 
Had all but calmed me 
I would stay up late into the night 
Until the sun had warmed the Earth 
Gripping at patterns of the morning 
Fighting the sequences before my eyes 
The sun rises and my panic begins 
I've spent all night sick to my stomach 
As if imagination were a disease 
I'm tired, and I hope the sun burns us all 
The Night was 
complex and 
I could not 
break free it's secrets 
I wake with 
the sun and 
I'm ill with 
the sun
