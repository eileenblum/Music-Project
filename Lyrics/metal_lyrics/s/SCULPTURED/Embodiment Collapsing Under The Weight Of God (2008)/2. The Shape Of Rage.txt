The shape of rage
Twisted, angered geometry
Contorting flesh
Changing my anatomy

Take away
This healthy human form
And replace it
With broken, mismatched bones

My blood flows for its life
Muscles tighten, my skin is dry
Breathe the air that keeps it growing
Surrender flesh so it can mold me

The shape of rage
Growing, disabling
Mark the host and
Survey the territory

Architecture of a
Violent history
Embodied in flesh
And ripping internally

Contusions mark my once soft skin
Shapes once perfect now disfigured
Unfamiliar to friends and family
Unwanted by those around me

I fear something
Inside of me
What can it be?
Revolutions; the spreading of disease

An open body
Abjection
A subject caught
With organs and with signs
Take them out
And rearrange them
A corporal drift
Corrupted, deconstructed

I'm not in control
Of this body
It has taken me hostage
I'm carrying my own, my own death sentence

The shape of rage
Twisted, angered geometry
Contorting flesh
Changing my anatomy

Take away
This healthy human form
And replace it
With broken, mismatched bones

My blood flows for its life
Muscles tighten, my skin is dry
Breathe the air that keeps it growing
Surrender flesh so it can mold me
