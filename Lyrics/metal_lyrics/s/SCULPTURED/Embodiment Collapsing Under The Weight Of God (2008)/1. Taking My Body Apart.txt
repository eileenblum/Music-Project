Assigned a final signified
Completed and defined
Rip my throat and cut my hands
Undo the body and break its sign

The judgment of god
The judgment of the word
A final claim that will inscribe
All the meanings of the flesh

You'll find the terms of god
You'll read the words of god
You will suffocate
Under the weight of god

Do not look for a response
God's silence is all you'll find
Your skin
Is your
Very own prison

Take my lungs out
Take my heart out

I'll fly in the face of god
I'll flood the heavens with my blood
Cut my veins and splatter the walls
I'll leave a mess for him to find

Will there ever be a word?
Will there ever be a way to speak?
Now that my body is empty
Can one speak without organs?

You'll see there is nothing
You'll learn there is no one
You will be condemned
As an organism

There is nothing outside the world
Nothing written upon your heart
Your faith, your Christ
Is an affliction

Take my lungs out
Take my heart out

Take all this away, let everything die
Take my body apart
Don't look to him as you die
Tear my insides out
Take all this away, let everything die
Take my body apart
Don't look to him as you die
Tear my insides out

Somehow I am always left wanting
I want to know if there is something
Even if it means taking myself apart
I'll begin at the throat and work my way down

Put aside each and every organ
I am moving towards becoming-inhuman
I will not be an organism
I've had it with god, I am moving on

Take all this away, let everything die
Take my body apart
Don't look to him as you die
Tear my insides out
Take all this away, let everything die
Take my body apart
Don't look to him as you die
Tear my insides out
