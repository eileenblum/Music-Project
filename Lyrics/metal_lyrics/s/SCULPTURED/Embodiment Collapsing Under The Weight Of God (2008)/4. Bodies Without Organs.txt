Crush all meaning
Disrupt all signals
Arrange the body's signs
And organs
Take these insides out and replace them with noise

Noiseâwhen there is no
God; a noise so
Loud it would shake the sky
And begin to
Take these insides out and fill the world with noise

The heavens shine upon us
And fill the world with meaning

Some time ago when I was sick
I would vomit so much that I would want to sew my mouth completely shut

A body sealed up
Unable to breath
Unwilling to eat or to be a body that is disciplined

The world is without meaning
No heaven shines above us

Bodies without organs
Nothing more useless than an organ
We are bodies without organs
There is nothing more useless than an organ

Bodies without organs
Nothing more useless than an organ
We are bodies without organs
There is nothing more useless than an organ

The burden of god
The questions left unanswered
And some unspoken
Will he answer for the ways we die?

And when we die
Will we finally know
Why life seemed like such
A long and painful process of dying?

The heavens shine upon us
And fill the world with nothing
Reflecting every weakness
We'll stare back at ourselves

Bodies without organs
Nothing more useless than an organ
We are bodies without organs
There is nothing more useless than an organ
