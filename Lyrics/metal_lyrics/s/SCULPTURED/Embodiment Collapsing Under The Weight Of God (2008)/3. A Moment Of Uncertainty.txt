How is it that I could lose a faith I never had?
Where is god? where is god?
Is that too much to ask for when there is so much proof to the contrary?
Answer me, answer me

God's silence is either a sign of his absence or humor

Is it amusing that everyone dies?
Are you laughing while you hide?
And is it a joke when things fall apart?
The faces that you've carved will all come apart

It is pathetic how so many signs point toward your nonexistence
Between you and me...
Yet you have done nothing to show the world that the world has any purpose
...you have a lot to answer for
