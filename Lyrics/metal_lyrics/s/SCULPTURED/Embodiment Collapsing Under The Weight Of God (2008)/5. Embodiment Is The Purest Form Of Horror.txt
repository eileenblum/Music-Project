It is a fear of mine
That there is something not right
An ill and unstable feeling
What will happen next?

I look toward you for strength
You show me that you are helpless
In sickness we are alone
And I know that we'll die alone

Everything will fall apart
And nothing can compare
To the ways that we die
And dying is just one of the things we do
That makes the world seem real
Everything will fall apart

How will I die?
Quickly, suddenly, without warning?

Time will not be kind to
All the things that we hold dear
There's nothing that we can do
To stop the decay of...

...our lives
Our lives are an archive
Of days long wasted
And hearts left broken

And even if we were to
Find someone that we could love
Would they be with us when
The light goes out of our eyes?

Everything will fall apart
And nothing can compare
To the ways that we die
But dying is just one of the things we do
That makes the world seem real
Everything will fall apart

There is nothing that can keep us well
There is nothing that we can do, when
Love is not enough, when
We die, we all die alone
