Where is the passion of belief
Inner movement one can live
Rule is to take but not to give
You saw a dawn banishing night
Did what you thought was right
To revive the world that is in need

Home was a shelter, now you are displaced
Tools of order that hunt you and chase
Bring the storm for those in disgrace

Now starts the game
And the scene is drowned in grey
Where fate decides who is hunter, who is prey

Our hands were joined, in unity we knelt still
But as a trenchant blade is the world surreal
Our reconciliation burning in my heart
Is now torn apart, like Judas I feel

It's not my will what must be done
I'm not the only one
Oath is the bound that holds me down
A wheel of time signs "the die is cast"
Grinds men into dust
And you shall burn in stake at last

In my wild dreams I hear breaking ice
Water's arms do embrace, baptize
Tongues of fire devour your cries

Life for a life, but its path becomes now vain
Who will hear my pray
Redeemer twice betrayed?

Our hands were joined, in unity we knelt still
But as a trenchant blade is the world surreal
Our reconciliation burning in my heart
Is now torn apart, like Judas I feel
