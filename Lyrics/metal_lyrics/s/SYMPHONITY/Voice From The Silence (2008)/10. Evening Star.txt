I see the light, piercing the night
The evening star, a dark horizon
Oh, it's so clear, still it's not near
Shines so far away...

I see the light, burning, so bright
But this time there's no space for wonders
Yes, it's all clear, no hope, not near
Lies so far away...

I've been counting those passing years, time goes by
Am I foredoomed to loneliness? Won't you tell me?
I've been drowning in my own tears, still I cry,
Feel the presence of weariness... won't you heal me?

Time goes by mending our hearts
And soothing our minds
Giving us hope that we shall meet
Someday, somewhere

I've been gazing at the stars tonight
Can not reach you there, but still can see your light
My heart is beating, yearning and bleeding
But I know that it's not true I'm forever lost to you

I see the light, burning so bright
A lonely star, a dark horizon
Watching alone, turning to stone
Silent words, I pray

Where is the way? Needless to say
That this one only leads to dreaming
When it's all clear, plain and sincere
You're so far away...

I've been counting those passing years, time goes by
Am I foredoomed to loneliness? Won't you tell me?
I've been drowning in my own tears, still I cry,
Feel the presence of weariness... won't you heal me?

Time goes by mending our hearts
And soothing our minds
Giving us hope that we shall meet
Someday, somewhere

I've been gazing at the stars tonight
Can not reach you there, but still can see your light
My heart is beating, yearning and bleeding
But I know that it's not true I'm forever lost to you

I've been counting those passing years, time goes by
Am I foredoomed to loneliness? Won't you tell me?
I've been drowning in my own tears, still I cry,
Feel the presence of weariness... won't you heal me?

Time goes by mending our hearts
And soothing our minds
Giving us hope that we shall meet
Someday, somewhere

I've been gazing at the stars tonight
Can not reach you there, but still can see your light
My heart is beating, yearning and bleeding
But I know that it's not true I'm forever lost to you
