In the ruins of our lives, lost the sense of it all
We have left our dreams far behind
Just awaiting your call
Through destruction and pain we have gone
Always one more step down
Now we see that the time has come
To stop and turn around

The glory of paradise
We've already had in our hands
But everything turned to dust
Now look at us where we stand

Give us a sign bring us the light
Give us the answer to all our cries
Take us away far from this live
To different spaces and different times

Don't leave us here with questions in mind
Bring us salvation and save us from crime
Show us the way out of the night
Save our souls from the beast deep inside

See the cold fear in our eyes
Once our future so bright
Running restless through this time
Our own enemy to fight

The glory of paradise
We've already had in our hands
But everything turned to dust
Now look at us where we stand

Give us a sign bring us the light
Give us the answer to all our cries
Take us away far from this live
To different spaces and different times

Don't leave us here with questions in mind
Bring us salvation and save us from crime
Show us the way out of the night
Save our souls from the beast deep inside
