And then you walked away just slowly disappeared
For the rest of my live I'm searching you

Eyes of fire - lips of a queen
Hot desire came over me
I saw you walking down the avenue
And I saw my dreams come true.

You're the queen of beauty
You're the sunlight for me
I can only think of you

And then you walked away just slowly disappeared
And all your traces have been smeared
Now I know definitely what I am gonna do
For the rest of my live I'm searching you

Every morning you're my first thought
The smell of your hair still fills the air
I see your picture every day,
Every night to God I pray

Will I ever find you?
Will my dreams all come true?
Will this journey ever end?

And then you walked away just slowly disappeared
And all your traces have been smeared
Now I know definitely what I am gonna do
For the rest of my live I'm searching you
