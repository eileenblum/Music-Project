Snowy streets I walk alone, thinking of the past
Now the silence comes to me at last
Washing white the core of me
All the dusk that used to be
Filling up my mind for so long

Snowy streets I walk alone, Thinking of you
What I know is that my heart is true
There's no shadow over me
There is nothing I won't see
Won't live for the past, no!

In silence forsaken... awaken
Hearing echoes of my soul
Retrieving, receiving the meaning
There's an answer once for all

It's not fate that I would fear, not any more
There are thousand reasons to live for
Silence conquers emptiness
He's the Healer, nothing less
Guides me through my way home

In silence forsaken... awaken
Hearing echoes of my soul
Retrieving, receiving the meaning
There's an answer once for all
