Falling again into the void and the dark
You're loosing your dreams,
leaving your longing far behind

Pain! Your heart in flames, your mind in chains
The walls of stone are closing in
Defining all your life

True is what you see, no fear no dreams
Left in the world so grey and mean
Caught in the cage of gold and steel

Fly! Open your mind!
Search for the cure for your imprisoned heart
Keep for you the key
And open wide the gates of fantasy
Live your dreams!

Riding the wind, Wonderland's waiting for you
You walk in your way through the desert of planet Dune

Now your mind is free
To face your fear
To break the chains of slavery
To walk against the stream

All the things you see cannot be real
You've got the right to imagine
To dream and follow your dreams

Fly! Open your mind!
Search for the cure for your imprisoned heart
Keep for you the key
And open wide the gates of fantasy
Live your dreams!

Pain! Your heart in flames
Your mind in chains
The walls of stone are closing in
Defining all your life

All the things you see cannot be real
You've got the right to imagine
To dream and follow your dreams

Fly! Open your mind!
Search for the cure for your imprisoned heart
Keep for you the key
And open wide the gates of fantasy
Live your dreams!
