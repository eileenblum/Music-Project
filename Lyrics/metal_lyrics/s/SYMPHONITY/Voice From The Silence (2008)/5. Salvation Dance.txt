The signs of running time
Are hollowing your scars
You see an approaching deadline
Things have come too far
Living lane is drowning in grey
Where's the Lord to obey?

In hunger for redemption, saviour you deify
A mirror of reflection, veiling true and lie
You feel great embracing your fate
No more torture untamed

Here marching through time, pied piper arrives
Hear his tune that rules your mind
Salvation in eyes, too late (to) realize
Your life has been sealed by his crime

See rats behind the leader, leaving all estate
It's the nature of a believer, conform to the faith

With fury unbound (you) can't hear the flute's sound
Heading for a rock and fall down

Here marching through time, pied piper arrives
Hear his tune that rules your mind
Salvation in eyes, too late (to) realize
Your life has been sealed by his crime
