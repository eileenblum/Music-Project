Of ceaseless dominion, void and without form
Here, virtues reign...
Knowing not the self, nor from whence we came
Here, dwelleth the slaveâ¦
Born and bred unto benighted submission
I serve sacred command,
And yearn the cradle of its chains

In thralldom divine; unfound, motionless and blind
Here, we remain...
Dying one thousand deaths, as each dawn fathers new name
Here, "home" is but a graveâ¦
Disenchanted by the feigned arms of rapture
I count the sands of time,
And feed upon its grain

I stay; restrained... unwanting to yield these confines
I praise and pray unto thee, each and every day and night
Yet still I lay bare; coveting an end to this plight
....May thy cup runneth over, and soon fall the sweetest wine?

Breath begets breath
Each echo like a step
Ringing onward, unveiling contrast
Enkindling within, as they last

In this desolate crypt,
This cave of mirrors;
Resounding reflections birth illumination

"Dost thou see me now; a distant flare, a blazoned cry?
Hast thou forsaken me, the image thoust left to die?"
My portrait shines upon the deep, usurping a shapeless stillness
For a single shadow cast, has begun this catharsisâ¦

"I see now a second self, a lone and blazing star;
And with thy lips, a brush... I paint its pathways afar"
An effigy of the flaming one, unearthed and fostered into darkness;
For on the wings of song, I become its duality incarnate

"Between these horizons, I stand;
Hand in hand, silhouette and man
...The light of the firmament, the light of this land"
