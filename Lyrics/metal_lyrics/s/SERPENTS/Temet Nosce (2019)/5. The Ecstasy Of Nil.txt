Such bliss!
For in death, "Thou" nor "I" exists...
'Tis an unutterable and nameless thought.
Such bliss!
For here, true love lies betwixt...
'Tis a solace ye vassals eternally sought.
Such bliss!
For evermore, alone and glorious...
'Tis a joy only the sage hath wrought!
I am!
...The seer and the seen
...The merchant and the pearl.
I am!
...The king and the queen
...The ain soph aur!
Woe unto thee!
...Ye children of the land of dreams,
For under the cozen's crown, thou art a slave!
Call unto me!
...Ye children of the land of dreams,
For thou art servants of the grave!
