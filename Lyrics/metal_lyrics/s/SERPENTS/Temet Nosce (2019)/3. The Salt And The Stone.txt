Another dawn
Screaming at the spiteful sun
"O' amorous ray!
Why hast thou fallen short of this place?
...Why deny thee thine embrace?"

In riposte, twin ravens speak in omen
Of divinations to befallen

[Ravens:]
"Sentenced to wander unto obscurity...
An abomination; festering.
To drift amongst the waves,
Amidst the shadow sea;
He drifts... unto mornless eternity."

Without respite
This augury consumed
"O' ravenous fate!
Unbroken by these wanton inequities
...I will writhe onward unto serenity!"

The constable supplicated extinguish
Bellowing of baptismal rebirth

[Ravens:]
"Destined to ascend above fallacy;
'Tis only a revelation... a prophecy.
To tremble in rapture,
Amidst the rising sea;
We shall laugh... as twilight swallows he!"

Witness!
A lone vessel
Sailing towards the somber unknown
Cloaked in shadow
Piercing the tapestry of endless night
Discordant chatter
Welcoming a return as the womb is sewn
I float on
Letting go of all worldly plight

In victory, the ravens roar in ecstasy
For the great transmutation has begun

[Ravens:]
"Unaffrighted to reveal this mystery;
Death... or whatever it may be.
To gaze upon such splendor,
Amidst the starry sea;
Liberation... shall be thy legacy!"
