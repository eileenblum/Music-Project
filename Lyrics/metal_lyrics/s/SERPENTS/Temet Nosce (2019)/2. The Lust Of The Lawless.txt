Feral youth fears not;
For within me, restless lovers lay entwined
Side by side...entangled in the mind;
Wild is the flame that illuminates the house of Gemini

Desirous, yet without way;
Chaos becomes my only constant

I am strychnine;
A scavenger maddened by the gall which lies beneath
With all might and munitions now unsheathed;
I've come to reap this world of weeping and gnashing teeth

From these ashes, comes a new way;
Dissolution is my only constant

If it is willed, then so it must be
Those who seek to torch the bastions of belief;
Shall sow the seed whence I came
...And of it's vine, ye flourish and remain
Harvesting glories I hath proclaimed,
Daggers must arise in defiance of god's name;
To cut from the earth, from Eden's tree
...And eat of it's fruit, the delights of this release

'Vi veri universum vivus vici!'
[English translation: "By the power of truth, I, while living, have conquered the universe!"]
