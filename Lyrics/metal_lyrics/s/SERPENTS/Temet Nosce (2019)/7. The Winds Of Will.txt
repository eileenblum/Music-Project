A winter tide triumvirate, severed the tongues of men;
And within it's frost, lie still ye brothers' hearts
Starved of the sun; stifled cries to the cold night sky...
Carry not, but fall, upon the vast crimson snow

Afar, a hermit now stands at the frozen shore
And with a single tear,
He declared the oceans to moan and roar

The Earth, how it groans; frenzied by the old one's gift
His broken plea unlocked the gates of the abyss
A call unto me... for woe hath usurped my domain
Withal, I shall breathe, into he... who awakens me

From "pauper to pasha";
A vow bestown upon my diadem
Once more I return,
To remit the bounty for the bastard of Bethlehemâ¦

Freed by a thunderous quake
A wolf is unleashed from his chains
Beholden for this new life
I now join the summoner's campaign
For it is written
When divided, become one snake;
And god himself shall be slain...

Swift, severe, and without mercy
My titian blade thrusts unto the heavenly throne
Falling flames rain on all below,
Engulfing the ivory stain of the world as you've known
For it is on this day,
The flesh hath prevaileth over the lords of stone
For it is on this day,
My will is done and in it's splendor... I must roam
