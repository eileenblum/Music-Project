No will to live in this world.
A wasteland plagued by social disorder.
Cast aside to comply, we have been silenced.
Bleeding for normalcy, the essence of the slave.
Find truths from a haunted past doomed by pride, we've dropped the
gavel on our fate.
a congregation of the evil man; deceiving, paralyzing, and controlling
the primal mind.
lords of upheaval, executing our demise.
an ancient scripture, dictates this execution.
absolute regression towards a course for destruction.
you hold close the word of "hope"?
this is existence.
this is punishment.
we've fallen unto persuasion by dissolving intellect.
unquestioned desecration by our own idle hands.
breeding a new race fathered by consumerism, the illusion portrays a
sense of security.
acceptance of this madness, feeds a war machine.
imprisoned, not know what is truly "free".
while jesters of the media provide ironic distraction,
a congregation of the evil man; deceiving, paralyzing, and controlling
the primal mind.
lords of catastrophe, executing our demise.
an ancient scripture, dictates this execution.
no longer will we devote all of our lives.
a legacy of tyranny i've grown to despise.
in hopes of empathy, these words must be realized.
prepare for the crowning of hypocrisy...
