The time is now to know my pain
I want you to live your life in agony
tell me why do you live, when the both of us should die?
a well deserved bloodbath left in the wake of those who deny
your tongue should be your noose, no more perdition for you
all've forgotten, that "you" were of my faith
i find solace in the thought, that you will never know all you have lost.
strength empowers this purpose, a conviction to this belief
we are seeking, a greater vision, greater than all those before
begging for your chance to see another sun
a life of aspiration or a fucked sense of worth?
undeserving of a right to call yourself a son
this corruption plagues our faith
a corruption of a vision
this corruption plagues our faith
The time is now, to know our pain
we want you to live a life of suffering
tell us why do we live; when all of us should die?
A well deserved bloodbath left in the wake of those who deny
humanity disgraced, but we shall see this through
a cycle to eradicate the filth that lives in all of you
witnessing man die aside both our worlds are purified
salvation has arrived
I have exiled the unworthy by act-ing on this vengeance
I have gained the unworldly by issuing man's consequence
silence speaks restless throughout the skies
a gratitude to the teachings of our wise
no peace, an allegiance towards man's lies
a disregard to the teachings of our wise
there's no rejoice for your damned, clinging to these bastard ways
all is lost as you submit to a servant-like state
this strangulation takes hold, we are now justified
this cycle will not end with your fucking "lives"
