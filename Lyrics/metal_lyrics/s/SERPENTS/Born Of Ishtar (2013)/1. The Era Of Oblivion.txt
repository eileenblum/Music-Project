behold!
man's resonating tale of dissonance
hell's generation of hollow beings
deifying a perception of a common king
a plea from desperation, this obsession rots within
dwelling in the chasm that enthralls this obedience
a struggle towards the stars, the lifelong sin
torn down, raped, a design for our existence
empty stares of nothingness, a parade of living dead
we bathe in Fama's filth to cleanse our heavy heads
submerged into distraction, we've lost actuality
stimulated by the obstruction of our technology
all are unified in pain, suffering in harmony, convulsing in these chains;
enslaved by this venom coursing through humanity
we stand blinded in awe, arise, the era of a demigod
a lamb led to slaughter, oblivious to reality
all are unified in pain, suffering in harmony, convulsing in these chains;
enslaved by this venom coursing through humanity
we stand blinded in awe, arise, the era of a demigod
like children led to slaughter, oblivious to reality.
(this never-ending void, one by one we are consumed
an immortal alliance slowly executes a prosaic doom
self inflicted demoralization, a fallacy, our concept of time,
methods of desensitization, a precursor, to all's decline.
constantly searching for something that was never there
discovering the worth of nothing, an end to all's despair
tear the flesh from my bone
cleanse me of this disease
make me feel alive again
pain, please sustain me
dead inside, nevermore, nor subjected to this melancholy
satisfied, evermore, the key to unlock our ascendancy
we've betrayed the gift of time seeking comfort in commodity
a crusade waged on crimes brought forth by your inhumanity
a plea from desperation, this obsession rots within
dwelling in the chasm that enthralls this obedience
a struggle towards the stars, the lifelong sin
torn down, raped, a design for our existence
