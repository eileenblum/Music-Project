Overlords, enforce a communion of hidden agenda.
Man is pounded into submission by the word of fellow gods.
But life endures, amongst deceit.
A spirit damned, bred to believe in individuality forever weeps...in defeat.
A laughable sense of "reality"; a belief in a hideous beauty.
A global state of confusion in worship of the American dream.
The superstitious dissolve the substance of life for the free.
Our own chains weighing down all brothers and sisters, keeping our
sights to the ground.
Never to bite the hand that breeds, obedience is born; the end of the
rebel sound.
Orchestrate! a solution of servitude, the works of an ancient design.
Bludgeoning the ripe mind by broadcast, a subconscious propaganda to allign.
Ensuring the bloodline of fools, a selective abuse unto man's rules.
The tongues of our deceivers convert all non-believers, applause
enslaves all in this global theater.
All praise the beast! whether be friend or foe, all shall consume to
satisfy a soul's woe.
Your children born in vein, for they cannot truly live.
Institution polluting fragile minds, promising solittude in separation.
Take Back!
The purpose of life has been forgotten.
Individualism, struggling to survive.
Never to align, to become one fucking race.
To value what is to truly live.
Never underestimate the power of your mind.
The veil has been lifted, the signs brought to your eyes.
Perceive to believe.
Weakened but not oblivious, man is a product of nature.
Educated, emancipated; a revolution in consciousness.
A lust for information, a gateway to liberation.
We are dominion, a minority of the informed.
A secret society to enlighten the lost forevermore...
