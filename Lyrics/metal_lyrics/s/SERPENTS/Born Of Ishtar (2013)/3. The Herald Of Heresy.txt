A forgotten past of innocent bloodshed has been silenced, under the
cloak of a beautiful sign.
A dictation, a tainted portrait of purity; The interpretation, an
ancient divinity lost in translation.
Opened eyes.
Closed mouths.
This word was never alive.
Realize!
That doubt was murdered to survive.
Romantic persecution in lot of a father's name.
Ritualistic disillusion disregarding aeons of shame.
The pointed finger of a modern inquisition; Where is forgiveness?
Insanity from confusion; What is this sickness?
Hypocrite!
You bring forth an unforgivable darkened age!
Your search of paradise wherein you've become the slave.
Leave us behind, behind in the shadows of your "kingdom".
The stars will align, delivering us both unto eternal freedom.
March forward into darkness, oh crusader of light.
Become one with the heartless, engulfed by endless night.
March forward into darkness, perdition remains out of sight.
Scorned and betrayed, no warmth of a father's embrace, you've lost all
meaning in this crusade.
These words dictated by woken eyes, a message for you in hopes you've realized.
Fear and faith, disguised to be one in the same, chasing what one cannot obtain.
These words dictated by woken eyes, a message for you in hopes you've realized.
