All Kingdoms fall,
as the monuments
have before them.
Stone and steel, bonded together by the blood of the begotten.
In truth, 'tis a fragile design, a poor bond.
fertile lands cloaked by what sustains life, a harvest doth not flourish...neither should an empire.
There are no kings in this domain.
Land is the law.
Nature.
(Man is a bastard son, ungrateful in it's blessings.
Such fools, unable to see the fate staring back from a far.
A destiny delivered unto themselves through premonition, through "divine" tongue.
They march to the hymns of a hypocrite, a king of lies, backwards into oblivion.)
No such divinity is of this world,
yet for aeons you have bent at the knee.
Born and bred into submission.
Stone and steel, bonded together by the blood of brothers and sisters.
In truth, 'tis a fragile design, a poor bond.
fertile lands cloaked by what sustains life, a harvest doth not flourish...neither should an empire.
There are no kings in this domain.
Land is the law.
Nature.
Pray to no gods,
Prey to no gods.
