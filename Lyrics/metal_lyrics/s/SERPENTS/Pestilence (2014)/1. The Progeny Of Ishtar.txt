Our story begins on present day Earth.
The sands of time have now run out.
The guardians of mankind are no longer able to contain this...disease.
A funeral march unto a new Aeon now resonates throughout the land, deafening with each blow.
Curious minds feast thine eyes on these giants, only to be blinded by the sight.
The scriptures tell tales of this day...
As it was foretold by the herald of the serpent beast, she comes.
Upon the Pestilence horse the Annunaki ride, the alpha and omega.
To usher in a new dominion!
To reclaim supremacy for the newborn heir!
Hear us now!, ye bastard descendents of Eve.
Sound the bells of thy absolution!
