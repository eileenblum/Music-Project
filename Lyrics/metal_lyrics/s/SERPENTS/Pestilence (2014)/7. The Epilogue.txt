A fertile earth now stands alone in the cosmos.
Reborn.
Awaiting the seed of a worthy suitor to begin anew.
Forward into an eternity spent in hope, she will wait.
As it is above, it is below...remember?
For the creation is a mirror into the design of the creator itself.
Inheriting traits of an architect seeking the answer to it's own flaws.
The echo of one's imperfection and the desire of it's reform, resonates onward with each creation.
Each entity will look to the heavens above them, as their forefathers have...waiting to begin anew.
An untraceable answer.
An endless cycle.
An unforeseeable end.
Such is the tragedy of existence...
