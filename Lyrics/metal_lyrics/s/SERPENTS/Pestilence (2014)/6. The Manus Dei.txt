Like a pack of wolves tearing at the game of the hunt.
Mouths drenched in the blood of it's prey,
leaving it's corpse to the soil.
The murder of innocents.
Human trafficking.
Public persecution.
A trail of "being" resemble such carnal violations to nature's law.
A perpetual offense against thine creation,
A ceaseless infraction against thine kin.
There is no courtroom on this Earth corrupt enough to punish these deeds.
There is no gavel heavy enough to sound off it's deafening sentence.
(A defilement of innocent flesh, a desecration of the temple.)
An eternity of torment will be thy penance.
An eternity of torment, you fucking swine.
(Applause echoes throughout generations as death is on display.
...Ages have come and gone with no sign of intervention.)
A global metastasis, transmitting affliction to the heart of the world
With each beat, with each pulse, disease spreads.
leaving her corpse to the stars.
The rape of innocents.
Human mutilation.
Public oppression.
A wasteland of "being" resemble such carnal violations to nature's law.
A perpetual offense against thine creation,
A ceaseless infraction against thine kin.
There was no courtroom on this Earth corrupt enough to punish these deeds.
There was no gavel heavy enough to sound off it's deafening sentence.
(A defilement of tainted flesh, a desecration of the ruin.)
