Drums like thunder shatter the still
A pulsing is shaking the ground
The gods of Metal have send us to you
To blow your ears with our sound

Messengers of steel we are tonight
Gathered in the circle of our might
Messengers of steel we are tonight
Fight to break our chains and reach the sky

The time has come for us to cross the line and break the seal
Come with us and join us on the road to our kingdom of steel.

Primal screams tear down the walls
Two axes will teach you fear
The taste of Metal is in the air
`cause now we are finally here

And here we stand preachers of steel
Spikes and leather our skin
The servants of Metal are here tonight
And now let me hear you sing

Line Up:
