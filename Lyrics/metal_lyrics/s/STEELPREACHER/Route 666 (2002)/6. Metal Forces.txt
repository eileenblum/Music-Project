Can you feel the power inside you
Can you feel the fire in your soul
The flame of centuries

Can you hear the call of the wild
The savage within you
Primal fury

The secrets of Metal we will keep
ItÂ´s our guiding star
The kingdom of steel weÂ´ll defend
DonÂ´t you know who we are

Defenders of faith
The knights of our time
Eternal glory will always be mine
Keepers of power
The night will reveal
Metal forces rule the steel

See our brothers standing side by side
United we are strong
Power and glory
