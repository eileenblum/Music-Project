My life seemed senseless, boring and absurd.
But I knew thatÂ´s not a life for me
One day IÂ´ve heard that song,
it was fast and loud and mean
and this song made a change deep in me
For all to see

Drinking Â´n banging
And Metal to the end
So itÂ´s got to be
Drinking Â´n banging
And spit on every trend
Makes me know IÂ´m free

Leather and spikes, tonight we strike
Gods of Metal hear my call
Patches and chains, music that maims
So catch your breath - Metal till death

Playing Â´n banging
for you here tonight
Bangers side by side
Drinking Â´n banging
I know you want the same
So letÂ´s do it all damn night
