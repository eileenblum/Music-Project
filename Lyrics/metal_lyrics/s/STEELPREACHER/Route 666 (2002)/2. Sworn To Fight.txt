Thunder and lightning are raging
A thunderstorm darkens the sky
The mighty returns from the land high above
Now unbelievers prepare to die

Out of the storm clouds the Thunderer appears
Holding his hammer up high
Descend from Valhalla the hall of the brave
Await my soul on that day I die

Sworn to fight for Metal
FIGHT FIGHT
Fight or die in battle
DIE DIE
Side by side
