So if you wanna know me, there's one thing you should know
It ain't easy to explain, but it is easy just to show you

No matter if it's booze or beer
I just wanna make it clear

No, we don't get drunk, we don't get drunk
We just get awesome
No, we don't get drunk, we don't get drunk
We just get awesome

Don't you say I've had enough, just because I'm on the floor
'cause right now it's clear to me, I can do everything and more

No matter if it's booze or wine
I'm getting better all the time

No, we don't get drunk, we don't get drunk
We just get awesome
No, we don't get drunk, we don't get drunk
We just get awesome

And when I drink the seventh can, I fuckin' feel like superman
And when I'm done with all the case, I might just awesome all over the place
I might just awesome all over your face

No, we don't get drunk, we don't get drunk
We just get awesome
No, we don't get drunk, we never ever never get drunk
We just get awesome, sexy, handsome and cool

And now we get drunk, and now we get drunk
And fuckin' awesome
And now we get drunk, and now we get drunk
And fuckin'
