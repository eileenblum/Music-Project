Autumn time, the witches rise again
Lock the door and fear the witches bane
The clergy warns "beware the wicked crones,
They'll drink your soul, eat your flesh and bones"

Falling leaves â the raven's flying high
Hunt the witch â we shall make her die

Oh oh watch out
The seasons of the witch
Oh oh watch out
The seasons of the witch

On the hill, when the light is gone
No man ever saw what is going on
Celebration, invocation-rite 
In the full-moon light

Falling leaves â the raven's flying high
Kill the witch â don't you ask me why 

Oh oh watch out
The seasons of the witch
Oh oh watch out
The seasons of the witch

Life can't be ended, death is just an illusion
And I'll be transcended â for now, but I will return

Seasons of the witch
[â¦]
They will find you, they will make you burn
Seasons of the witch
[â¦]
Lost and hell bound, there is no return
Seasons of the witch
[â¦]
Don't fear the end my friend, don't fear the seasons of the witch
Seasons of the witch
[â¦]
My time will come again â there'll be the seasons of the witch
Seasons of the witch
[â¦]
