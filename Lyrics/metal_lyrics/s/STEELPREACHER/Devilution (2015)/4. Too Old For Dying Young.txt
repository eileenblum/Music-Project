We were born with the lust for freedom
Much too young and wild to tame
Free at heart, born to be a rebel
And the world was ours to claim

Were it days? Were it weeks?
It feels like yesterdayâ¦

All those years â where have they gone?
Blood, sweat and tears and now we're too old for dying young
Time takes it toll, waiting for none
And now we're too old for dying young

Looking back on all the things we've been trough
Stories of those days long past
Enjoy your life, the time that's given to you
Cause the wheel of time turns fast

Were it days? Were it weeks?
It feels like yesterdayâ¦

All those years â where have they gone?
Blood, sweat and tears and now we're too old for dying young
Time takes it toll, waiting for none
And now we're too old for dying young

Time flies by as you will see, so hold onto every breath
Don't you fear to die one day, fear to die before your death

Old man, stand up, do it one more time

All those years â where have they gone?
Blood, sweat and tears and now we're too old for dying young
Time's on our side, nearly outrun
And though we're too old for dying young
I'm not already done

â¦ not already done !
