Darkness and snow, the sunlight has faded, the age of the wolf has begun
We fight to the very last man, or the battle has won
Clash of the swords, blood spilled in madness, let arrows fall like hail
Men fall side by side, but we shall prevail

And we'll fall to the ground with honor
And we'll die with steel in our hands
And we'll make our way across the rainbow-bridge
Up high to the immortal lands

Asgard awaits, high in the sky
All men who died with honor and pride
Carried away by Valkyries up high
Asgard is holding a place for those who die

Kiss of the blade, bloody and gruesome, I lay down and gaze at the skies
War and pain fade away, as I close my eyes
In twilight we dwell, our calls fade in darkness, no Valkyries, no rainbow, no sign
I curse the gods and the brave, "revenge shall be mine"

And we fall to the ground into darkness
And we turn away from the light
Descend to the realms of the underground
Embraced by eternal night

Dark is my soul, dark is my path
Feeding the flames of vengeance and wrath
Betrayed by the gods â forever denied
Asgard is holding no place for those who died

Disciples of war â swearing allegiance
Wrath of the gods â brought us to fall
Forces of hell â breaking the gates of the underworld

We arise from the void of the darkness
And we storm the gates in the sky
And the hall of the brave shall be no more
And the gods shall learn they can die 

Asgard's aflame â forever gone
All gods up high â forever undone
One with the dark â forever we fly 
We ride till the end of all days and haunt the sky
