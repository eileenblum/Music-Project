Facing death,
I am sure you feel the end is drawing near
Hold your breath,
Look into my eyes and face your darkest fear

Hellbound, lost and never found
Spawned to burn this world to the ground

Oh oh, we're creatures of the night
We are demons without name, born of fire and flame
Our time has come again
Devilution

All alone,
In the ruins of what we've used to call the earth
Is this hell,
Or is it just the hallowed ground for our rebirth

Hellhound, which way will you choose
When all ends and hell's breaking loose

Oh oh, we're creatures of the night
We are demons without name, born of fire and flame
Our time has come again
Devilution

Feel the fire,
Burning down below since the dawn of time
Your desire,
Set it free and all the world will be thine

Power, once it is unleashed
You're the lord, the devil and the beast

Oh oh, we're creatures of the night
We are demons without name, born of fire and flame
Our time has come again
Devilution
