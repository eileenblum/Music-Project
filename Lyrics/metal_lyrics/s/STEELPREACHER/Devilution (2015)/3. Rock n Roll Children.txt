There has been a time when we used to rock it
There has been a time when we used to roll
Well it seems to me nothing lasts forever
That's the way it is, time will take it's toll

But what's that sound in the streets at night?
'cause that sound makes me feel alive

We are rock'n roll children
We are the soul
We stand all for one
And one for all
We will rock tonight and forever

Flying high again using tons of hair-spray
Putting on my face and my jeans sit tight
Play some MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e, Tigertailz and Poison
And the glory days will be back tonight

What's that sound screaming in my head?
What's that sound waking up the dead?

We are rock'n roll children
We are the soul
We stand all for one
And one for all
We will rock tonight and forever

We are rock'n roll children
We stand all for one
We will rock tonight and forever

We are rock'n roll children
We are the soul
We stand all for one
And one for all
We will rock tonight and forever

We are rock'n roll children
We are the soul
We stand all for one
And one for all
We will rock tonight and forever
