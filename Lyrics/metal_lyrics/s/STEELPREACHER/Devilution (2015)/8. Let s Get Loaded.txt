Hey you, what's the matter?
Why you're down and blue?
Well I tell you something
You should rather do
You've gotta get up and shake it off
You've gotta leave it all behind
Grab the world by its balls
And make up your mind

When life's a mess
And all is sad and grey
You will always hear me say

Let's get loaded â oh yeah
Let's get loaded â all right

When it's one of these days 
And you feel sad and small
So hey listen buddy
Here's your wake-up call
You've gotta cheer up and have some fun
No matter what they say
Live this day like your last
And do it every day

When life's a mess
And all is sad and grey
Do it right â do it d.o.a.

Let's get loaded
Loaded all the time
Let's get loaded
Loaded all the time

Let's get loaded
Let's get loaded
[â¦..]
Let's get loaded
Loaded all the time
Let's get loaded
Loaded all the time
