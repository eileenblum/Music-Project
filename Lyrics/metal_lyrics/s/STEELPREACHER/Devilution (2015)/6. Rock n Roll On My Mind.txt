This is a song about a little thing called rock'n rollâ¦

Down at my favorite bar, it's my great delight 
Just get another beer and raise some fuckin' hell tonight

No matter who you are, where you're coming from
Join our side it feels alright and rock with us all night long

I've got
Rock'n roll on my mind
Rock'n roll all the time
Rock'n roll on my mind
Rock'n roll till the day I die

The only thing I really want â well I'm just a man
Give me some more beer and booze and here I fuckin' go again

No matter who you are, where you're coming from
Join our side it feels alright and rock with us all night long

I've got
Rock'n roll on my mind
Rock'n roll all the time
Rock'n roll on my mind
Rock'n roll till the day I die

I tell you something baby, I was born to rock
You better live with it or you can suck my fucking cock

No matter who you are, where you're coming from
Join our side it feels alright and rock with us all night long

I've got
Rock'n roll on my mind
Rock'n roll all the time
Rock'n roll on my mind
Rock'n roll till the day I die

Rock'n roll â I want it
Rock'n roll â I need it
Rock'n roll â till the day I die

I've got
Rock'n roll
Rock'n roll
