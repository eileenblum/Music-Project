Gazing at sea, restless I stare night and day
Longing for home, for too long I've been away
I don't fear no storm or the beasts of the wild raging sea
Lurking in darkness
Cast off the ropes, we're setting the sails the trade winds will carry us home

Ivory shores touching a crystal horizon
A city of silver and gold â Atlantean dawn
Keeper of power and wisdom untold
Far beyond the western sky
The ocean empire thrones â forever more
All hopes and dreams are lying ashore
Atlantean dawn

I have been sent to subdue the wild savage lands
"God" I've been called, but they just don't understand
Teaching the wild and thus the seed has been sown
Growing in the darkness
Cast off the ropes, we're leaving this lands the trade winds will carry us home

Ivory shores touching a crystal horizon
A city of silver and gold â Atlantean dawn
Keeper of power and wisdom untold
Far beyond the western sky
The ocean empire thrones â forever more
All hopes and dreams are lying ashore
Atlantean dawn

No thunderstorm or rogue wave will ever keep me away from home â where I belong â¦

Endless waves are touching a blackened horizon
No city no silver no shore â Atlantean dawn
Where is the island I'm searching for 
Drown into a hell of water
An ocean empire lost â forever more
A kingdom forgotten, a legend â not more
Atlantean dawn
