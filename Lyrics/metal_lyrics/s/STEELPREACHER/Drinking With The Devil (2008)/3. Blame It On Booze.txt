The week is over the work is done
It's time to rock and have so fun
So I gather all my dole
Hit my favourite drinking-hole

It's time to see
What you've got for me
Baby I'm born to lose
Don't blame me just
Blame it on booze

Beer is fine but even quicker
Does the job a glass of liquor
With the will to succeed
I increase my drinking speed

Blame it on booze
When I'm gettin' corny
Blame it on booze
When I'm gettin' mad
Blame it on booze
When I'm gettin' horny
Blame it on booze
When my breath is bad
Blame it on booze

...when you're down on your knees
For it was me who cut the cheese

I overdraw the farting game
I shit my pants - oh what a shame
