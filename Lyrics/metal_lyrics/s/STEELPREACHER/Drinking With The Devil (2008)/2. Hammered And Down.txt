You tell me to cut my hair and get a job
Fancy clothes, polite friends and finally grow up (LISTEN)
I will live my life my way and take it day by day
And I won't change a single thing, not matter what you say

Don't you stop
Drink until you drop
Hear our call
Together we drink, united we fall

You will find me, yes you'll find me...

Hammered and down
Hammered and down
Hammered and down

If you feel like we do, our Metal's just for you
Won't spare a single beer 'cause we're the drinking crew (and if)
You're addicted to school stuff and haven't changed in years
You're the keepers of the faith, to you we raise your beers

Beer's up high
Drink until you die
Bang your head
Don't you stop until you're dead

Till they find you, they'll find you...
