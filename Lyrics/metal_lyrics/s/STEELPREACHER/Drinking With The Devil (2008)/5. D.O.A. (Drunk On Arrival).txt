Headin' for a show, we start our drive
Had some beers too much when we arrive
Empty bottles are falling off the car
Hit the stage, you know we are...

We are D - O - D.O.A.
We are Drunk on arrival, so they say

Party time tonight, but still got time
Gettin' on the edge and start to pine
It is one idea of a kind:
To get some beers and gettin' blind...

We are D - O - D.O.A.
We are Drunk on arrival, so they say

Wanna ride my bike tonight
And to drown my spite
Drink some booze till I lost my sight
And take a trip in the dead of night

When I hit that truck I feel no pain
From above I see my bike - and brain
My funeral looks quiet bizarre
'Cause all my friends are here, they are...
