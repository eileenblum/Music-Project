You came tonight to see our show
Looking for some meat to blow
You see me - you see me
Nothing but a common slut
Looking for someone to fuck
You want me - you want me

Don't you call it esteem
Don't you call it wet dream
Because to me it is nothing but
Bitchcraft

Just to see me play and sweat
Is enough to make you wet
You want me - you want me
You would sell you heart and soul
Just to stuff your filthy hole
You need me - you need me

Sleazy hair and cheap perfumes
Getting balled in backstage rooms
Nymphomaniac in the buff
Getting screwed by everyone
Is bitchcraft in the rough

Teasing squeezing hold me tight
You just want get laid tonight
You need me - you need me
Just a walking S.T.D.
A gonorrhoea guarantee
So leave me - so leave me
