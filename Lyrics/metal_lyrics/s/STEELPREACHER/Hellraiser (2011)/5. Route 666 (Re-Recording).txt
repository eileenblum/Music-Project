Roaring thunder is calling from the sky
We've heared the tolling of thy bell
Pounding engines ride on glowing wheels
Heading for destination hell
Rush on faster there's no turning back
Hell is for us the place to stay

Red hot iron swallows gasoline
The horizon is burning in the dark
Riding faster through the open gates
Knowing that Hades awaits

Route 666
On the road to hell
Route 666
Living fast dying young

Raise your heads and start to be alive
Feel the embrace of hell
Way down faster reach our promised land
And leave this world behind

Wind of eternity
You're the one to bring
Tunes of destiny
Which we live and sing
