Goin' to the city
It's been a long day
Still I'm feeling shitty
But in five beers I'm  gonna be ok

Living on the fast lane
Tomorrow I could be dead
Won't regret or complain
Play it loud I wanna bang my head

Get down - hellraiser
Raising hell tonight
Live fast - hellraiser
You know it's gonna be
It's gonna be alright

All I really know
I don't need much in life
Trends they come and go
But heavy metal it will survive

Never gonna give in
That's not the way for me
Life is just for living
I was born to be wild and free

Hellraiser - bang your head shake your brain
Hellraiser - born to raise some hell
Hellraiser - metal overkill
Hellraiser - raisin' hell tonight
