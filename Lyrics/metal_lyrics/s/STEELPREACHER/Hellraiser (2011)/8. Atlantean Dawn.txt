Gazing at sea restless I stare night and day
Longing for home for too long I've been away
I don't fear no storm
Or the beasts of the wild raging sea
Lurking in the darkness
Cast off the ropes we're setting the sails
The trade winds will carry us home to

Ivory shores touching a crystal horizon
A city of silver and gold - Atlantean dawn
Keeper of power and wisdom untold
Far beyond the western sky
The ocean empire thrones - for evermore
All hopes and dreams a lying ashore
Atlantean dawn

I have been sent to subdue the wild savage lands
God I've been called, but they just don't understand
Teaching the wild and thus the seed has been sown
Growing in the darkness
Cast off the ropes we're leaving this lands
The trade winds will carry us home to

No thunderstorm or rogue wave will ever keep me
Away from home - where I belong...

Endless waves touching a blackened horizon
No city no silver no shore - atlantean dawn
Where is the island that I'm searching for
Drown into a hell of water
An ocean empire lost - for evermore
A kingdom forgotten, a legend not more
Atlantean dawn
