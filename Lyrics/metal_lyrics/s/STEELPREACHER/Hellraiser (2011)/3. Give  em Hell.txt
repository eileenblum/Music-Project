See no fear in my eyes cause I was born to fight
The spotlight is on me the crowd is going wild

And you know here comes the pain
And you'll never be the same
Feel trembling start again

Give 'em hell
Give them hell

I sacrifice my body
Each and every night
Blood and sweat and tears
Living for the fight

And you'll know I am the game
And you'll never be the same
Feel trembling start again

Give 'em hell - with all my body
Give 'em hell - with all my soul
Give 'em hell - with all my mind
Give 'em hell - you've got me whole
Give 'em hell - my greatest pleasure
Give 'em hell - my greatest pain
Give 'em hell - a body wasted
Give 'em hell - a life in vain
