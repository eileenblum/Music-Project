Do you fear the end of the dying day
When warmth and light are fading away
When shadows of night lead you astray
And creatures from hell are stalking their prey

All hope is gone forever
When they strike it's your final farewell
See the angels flee in terror
They will fall to the forces of hell

The legions of dark have come for your soul
Take it to hell and burn to coal
The end's drawing near and there's no return
Say your last prayer - get ready to burn

Hellfire you shall know my name
Riding thy winds one with the flame
Hellfire ruthless be thy reign
The legions from hell shall rise again

From the abyss of the underworld
Rise the lost - in fire reborn
Fearless souls reforged in fire and flame
They will take all heaven by storm

All light is gone forever
As their souls fall under our spell
See the angels fade into darkness
As they fall to the forces
They won't stand the forces
Yes we are the forces of hell
