Oh for many years now we have been around
We've played every stage in every town
This is what we love this is what we do
Bringing heavy metal and beer to you

I say - hey come on
Now it's time to rock and fuckin' go insane
Don't slow down - now it's time to drink
And shake your fuckin' brain

The only reason we are here
We want metal we want beer
So make your stand and let it hear
We want metal we want beer

Nowadays music is nothing but shit
Makes you wanna cry makes you wanna spit
The people wanna rock the people wanna roll
The people want some music played
With heart and soul

Heavy metal maniacs are filling up the halls
Blowing off the roof tearing down the walls
Wanna hear the screams the roaring of the crowd
Wanna hear some metal and I want it really loud
