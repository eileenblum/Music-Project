The clock strikes midnight
Darkness all around
But you don't close your eyes
You know I'm waiting
Hungry for your soul
Fear your demise

Feel your end's drawing near
The dreamweaver
I'm your master of fear
I feast on your pain
The dreamweaver
I kill or drive you insane
The dreamweaver's reign

Hellcome to dream-world let the fun begin
I just want to hear you scream
So why don't you just start to realize
This is more than just a dream

There's a world inside your my mind
A place behind your eyes
Where dreams become reality
And nightmares come to life

They won't leave me
They won't leave me alone
