We're drinking hard from nine to five
We drink as long as we're alive
The party is on, it's half past four
But there's trouble at my door

Party time ain't no crime
Pulling jokes on cops is wasted time

Oh oh I'm locked and loaded
Heavy drinking ain't no crime
Oh oh I'm locked and loaded
Locked and loaded for a time

Arrest and cuffs won't stop the fun
This fuckin' party has just begun
The night's still young - just five o'clock
So we start the jailhouse rock

Party time ain't no crime
Offering beer to cops is wasted time
