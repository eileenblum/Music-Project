Can't stand this life no more
Hear my wicked engine roar
And you know you know I have to go
Make you cry making you bleed
Hell knows I'm addicted to speed
And you know you know I won't let go

Kickstart my lust for life
And I am on my way

And then you see me ride into the night
The open road is our delight
I wanna ride - riding tonight
Riding hard side by side
Just let me ride - into the night
Riding fast running wild
I wanna ride - riding tonight
You better jump the track
We ride to hell and back

Ride for the thrills searching for kicks
On the route six six six
And I grin as I'm increasing pace
As I ride it comes to me I shout
Hell yeah I'm wild and free
And I laugh as hell winds twist my face

Don't you know the time has come for me
Start your life and ride to hell and back
With me tonight
