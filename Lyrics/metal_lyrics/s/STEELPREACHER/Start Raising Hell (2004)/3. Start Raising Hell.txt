Every Friday - like rehearsed
In my throat a mighty thirst.
I get my denim full of verve
Just to get what I deserve.

Glasses up high, play it loud !
Time to join in the banging crowd
Now hear my yell

START RAISING HELL
Tonight I'm on the run and
START RAISING HELL
Gimme beer until I'm done and
START RAISING HELL
Cause you know it's got to be
START RAISING HELL
Why don't you as well
START RAISING HELL

Beer and Whisky - one by one
But this night has just begun.
Bring it on, I wonÂ´t refuse
Nuke my liver with some booze !

Beer and Metal's what we need
Our pleasure and decay
Drinking and banging all damn night
Until the light of day.

Glasses up high, play it loud!
Shut your mouth and drink it out!
Until you yell START RAISING HELL....
