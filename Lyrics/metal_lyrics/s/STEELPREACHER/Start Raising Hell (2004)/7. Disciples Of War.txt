They came from the south
And their numbers grew
Burned down our homes
The eagles' banner blew

We won't adore
Your roman gods
You started war
Now pay in blood

Ride - Fire burns the skies
Bloodshed and cries
WonÂ´t take it no more
Raise your swords up high
WeÂ´ll make them die, weÂ´re
DISCIPLES OF WAR

Fire eats flesh
Steel merge with bone
Rip off their hearts
Force them back to Rome

Ride - Fire burns the skies
Bloodshed and cries
WonÂ´t take it no more
Hide from the light
Strike in the night, weÂ´re
DISCIPLES OF WAR
