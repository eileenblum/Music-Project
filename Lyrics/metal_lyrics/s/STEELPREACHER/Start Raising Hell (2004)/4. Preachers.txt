Through hell and fire
Through blood and death
Gonna hunt you bastards down
Hunt you till your final breath
WeÂ´ll show you whimpy bastards how to play
Loud and with devotion â thatÂ´s the one and only way

DonÂ´t dare to deny
Hail Metal or die
Watch your back
Tonight weÂ´re coming for you for you

PREACHERS
The Heavy Metal Law is our ideal
PREACHERS
Bring you metal that is real

WeÂ´ll show no mercy
We show no fear
WeÂ´ll make no prisoners
We spare no beer

Through hell and fire
Through blood and death
Gonna hunt you bastards down
Hunt you till your final breath
We will hunt you whimpy bastards, make pay
WeÂ´re the steel predators and weÂ´re coming for our prey
