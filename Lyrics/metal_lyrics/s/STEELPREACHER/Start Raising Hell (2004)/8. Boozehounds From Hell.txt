WhoÂ´s that poser standing there between me and my beer ?
I beat that bastard 1, 2, 3 for smalltalk IÂ´m not here
I down the glass, the shaking stops but that was not enough
Sorry folks but when IÂ´m sober IÂ´m a little rough
I order just another one, no wait â better ten
Come on chick, hurry up, the shaking starts again

Addicted to the liquid gold

Drinking like hell, barfing as well
Boozehounds from hell we are called
So grab your ass and better beware
The Boozehounds from hell assault

A poser shows up in my bar and wants to hear some KORN
I drop my glass of whiskey now and laugh at him with scorn
âYou wanna be a metal head, maybe I can assist
Metal reigns supreme you Fuck, the rest tells you my fistâ
After some more Whiskeys my bladderÂ´s filled again
I try my best but itÂ´s in vain â I can not hit the can

Splashing all my liquid gold
