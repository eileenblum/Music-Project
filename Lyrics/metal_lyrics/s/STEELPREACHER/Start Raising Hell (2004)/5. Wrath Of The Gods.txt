From the temples of Aswan
To the shores of the sea
IÂ´ve been the high priest
To praise and foresee

Caught by the guardsmen
Convicted to dwell (in darkness an fear)
A curse of immortality
A living hell

The sands retain
In tortures and pain
Trapped in insanityÂ´s reign
ItÂ´s the wrath of the gods

I call you Anubis
What ever it takes
Make me return to the living
To unleash the plagues

CanÂ´t stand this strain
Release this bane
All thatÂ´s left it is pain
ItÂ´s the wrath of the gods

[Spoken:]
...and he stretched forth
his hands towards the heavens,
and there was darkness
throughout the land of Egypt

I will attain
Death, torture and pain
Only ruins remain
And the wrath of the gods
