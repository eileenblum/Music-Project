Take a look at me now and you see what I mean
My walletÂ´s always empty, my clothes are never clean
SpendinÂ´ all my money for records and for booze
And when the record starts to turn, it start to infuse

This is my life, this is my way
DonÂ´t live tomorrow but today

I bang my head
Till IÂ´m dead
DonÂ´t you know
IÂ´M FUCKING METAL
Shout it out
Loud and proud
CanÂ´t you see
IÂ´M FUCKING METAL

Long hair, denim, spikes and leather, patches and tattoos
And when you start to mess with us, you will get a bruise
But if youÂ´re into metal, the case is very clear
First we do the fighting and then weÂ´ll have some beer
