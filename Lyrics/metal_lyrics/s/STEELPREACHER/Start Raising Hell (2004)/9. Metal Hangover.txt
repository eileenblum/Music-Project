Waking up, I feel like hell
ItÂ´s just 2 pm
The worldÂ´s turning like a carousel
I donÂ´t know where I am

ThatÂ´s nothing special
`cause IÂ´m a drinking man
I donÂ´t repent a thing
And IÂ´d do it again And got a fucking...

METAL HANGOVER, METAL HANGOVER
Back from the dead â pain in my head
METAL HANGOVER, METAL HANGOVER

IÂ´m jumping up, my bowel hurts
ItÂ´s completely clear
Drink too much and youÂ´ll get the squirts
But first I need a beer

ThatÂ´s nothing special
`cause IÂ´m a thirsty man
ThatÂ´s nothing special
`cause IÂ´m a Metal fan

METAL HANGOVER, METAL HANGOVER
Back from the dead â pain in my head
METAL HANGOVER, METAL HANGOVER
