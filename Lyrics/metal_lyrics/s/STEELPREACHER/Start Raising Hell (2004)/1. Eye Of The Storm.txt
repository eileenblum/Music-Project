With dark clouds as itÂ´s disciples
The evil was born
An omen of darkness is rising
The signs point on storm

WeÂ´ll make our stand
We wonÂ´t back down
When others flee
We hold the ground

Armed, ready to fight
We have to face the eye of the storm
Nowhere to hide
We have to face the eye of the storm

Storming through legions of darkness'
Fighting the shade
Countless lives shall be ended
By passing my blade

Just like thunder roaring
Our horns shall asound
By our steel you shall suffer
Our rage is unbound
