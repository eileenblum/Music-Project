[Lyrics by Susana CatalÃ£o]

Boobs are a perfect creation,
Always worthy of adoration.
They look great in a slow motion race,
And theyâre always ideal to get to third base.
Breasts are so awesome they come in pairs,
Theyâre built-in airbags that everyone stares.
Boobs are cool to squeeze and they even float
And into the cleavage you can motorboat .
In their 20âs theyâre nice and firm
In their 30âs and 40âs still round but a bit worn,
However in their 50âs and further on
Theyâll make you cry for whatâs forever gone.

Boobies come in various shapes,
Sometimes theyâre big as melons others small as grapes.
At times they are perfect others lopsided,
Now and then theyâre perky and their nipples misguided.
There are big nipples boobs and those just hanging,
Some are known as pillow tits that are very good for camping.
Super sized breasts can suffocate a guy
Migrator and wanderer titties can leave you with a black eye.
Every so often nipples get hard when its cold,
You should always seize a booby before it gets too old!

Sadly not all boobies make sense,
They can happen to be of a fat, greasy dude that suffers from flatulence.
Booooooooobs!
