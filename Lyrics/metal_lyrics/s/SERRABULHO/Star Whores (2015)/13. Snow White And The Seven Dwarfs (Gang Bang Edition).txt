[Lyrics by Susana CatalÃ£o]

People say she is inoffensive
But her sex is quite intensive.
Keeps a Kamasutra by the nightstand
And has a massive mammary gland.

Sometimes she uses a vibrator,
Others she just bangs a sailor.
They say she is as white as snow
And always has someone to blow.

The other day with nothing to do
She just wanted someone to screw.
As she was starting to pray
The seven dwarfs came in the way.

It was quite a pleasant score
As the dwarfs went down on her.
They seem to have the perfect proportion
To perform an oral incursion.

But sadly they all have a very small prick,
So she had to carry on in pursuit of the magic stick.
Go on snow white with your Clitassaurus Rex
Keep on with extramarital-sex.
