[Lyrics by Susana CatalÃ£o]

I am a sad Winnie,
Wrinkly and skinny.
Always with a bad hairstyle
Never have a shag worthwhile.
Live tightly with two nuts,
Now only desired by flatulent buts.

Used to be such a stallion,
Could hump a whole battalion.
Never lacked of pussy,
Waxed, shaved or bushy.

Life of a Penis!

Sometimes they were morbidly obese,
Others they smelled like cheese.
At times I went for the experienced ones,
Others for the catholic nuns.
But I really loved the virgin cunt
Where one could go treasure hunt!

People called me mushroom head,
My fame was quite widespread.
Always found a first-class vagina
Even if it was in China.
Once I was constantly erect,
Nowadays I am forever wrecked.

Can only get a Viagra boner,
From now on Iâll be a loner.
I have crabs and incontinence,
Herpes and impotence.

Canât even get manual decompression
Since my owner is handless.
A hard on would be a bless,
To save me from this great depression!
I am a sad Winnie, wrinkly and skinny.
Always with a bad hairstyle
Never have a shag worthwhile.
Live tightly with two nuts,
Now only desired by flatulent buts.
