Awakening the midnight sun,
You can feel the smell,
You see the black-wind rain

Lost soul out of conscience,
Seeking the voice of his own god

Never self-betrayed,
Never feeling shame
The hope of morality lost
In the old streets of the town

Rolling,
Down the church of self-destruction
Crying,
Is the bell for self-destruction!
Endorsers,
Calls tonight...for self-destruction!
Broken bones,
For his glory!

Wake up once again
Heading the north...
To the ancient mountain!

Absinthe
For the drunken ones

Crumbling down again,
Now lay on the green
Shaking the ground!

This forest is paradise
Is all i need tonight

I want to roll...
Down the church of self-destruction
