Some time ago,
Some losers heard my songs
They came and me
And told me shit

Misery ruined my life,
Ignorance killed my art

I'm just a miserable, miserable man
With my miserable voice
I'm just the solitary, solitary one
With my miserable theme

If you could hear the laments,
Screaming down my bed
You'll see...
I'm so alone

And all the comments and
The lies all over me...
No! i don't give a fuck

I'm just a miserable, miserable voice,
And what you hear is what i am
