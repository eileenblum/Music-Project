Miserable dead man walking
Down the miserable way
Watching mirrors in the sky,
Like the ravens always do

Now the ferryman...said the clue
Can the river reach the end?

Dead man walking
Dead man walking
Dead man broken inside,
Dead man give me your hand

Feel the sunrise in the morning
But fall broken in the sun
Solitary boy is crying
Down the miserable grave

So tell me ferryman, is this real?
Nothing will never be the same

Now the river said the truth

Pm-alone and broken inside

Dead man broken
I'm broken inside!
