I saw you down the river
I killed you in my dreams

So now
I see you in my...
I fell you down the...
I killed you in my...
I see you in my hell

Some times i thought
That you were born
To make this world
A worse place to live in

In my life there is...
Just no forgiveness

No!
It seems that all the hate is coming back in you
(i'm am not the only one)
No!
He will never hear your prayers,
And today, is a good day to die
(it doesn't matter to. me)
No!

See you in my hell...
