Ghost of (...)

I feel you breaking my spine
It's this place...
Remembrances of our past

I'll never forget
Words of empty will
But why... why my heart!
Can't beat alive without you?

Have you ever felt?
The sorrow and regret...
Can't you understand?
I will fall tonight

Dies the ghost, my darling
Comes tonight to burn you alive
My forgotten hopes are... tonight
Dying for you

Cries the moon forever
All this hate is killing in vain
Lover out of spite... i am
Deep from hell
I'll play for you

Diamond shining night
You can't carry on my despair
I will follow...
The broken and the damned

Have you ever seen
The loneliness in me?
They can't understand
Her smile means death to me
