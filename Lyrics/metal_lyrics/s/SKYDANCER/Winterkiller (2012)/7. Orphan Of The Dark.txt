Remember me for the crimes that I made and decisions I took 
So remember me with the hands on the fire and across a lonely street

The night uncovers now his shelter, 
to dance the ballad of the stars

The hours are passing by, 
watching me standing alone 
I'm an orphan of the dark, 
waiting the morning to rest

Sometimes I feel the breath of death, 
when I am trying to sleep 
The neverending circle of fate, 
makes no difference from you

So remember Me 
It's the only way to read the signs of my memory 
Forever goes on...the road of decay with no future behind

The night uncovers now his shelter, 
to dance the ballad of the stars
