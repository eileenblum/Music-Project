One man standing in front of his self with nothing to say 
Illusions: A light in the shade of the night

Eternal disease

This man, standing in front of the void 
will open his mouth, will give another lesson of greed 
No one will care

The perfect mind with no regrets, 
destined to spread the evil 
Broken smiles over the hell, 
he has no brothers by his side

Forget me now that I come to the Earth 
My role has been done here 
I don't know why I had born 
No reason to carry on, nothing to lose.

It's here ...the only way out of your brain, in front of your face 
Two steps to carry the weight of the world: 
Your destruction 
There's no need to give any reason of this, they can't understand 
Blind them...showing your plan to the world 
No one will care

The plan has failed and I don't care, 
it's better to continue with this gray 
A little time now I will rest, 
it's better to continue with my inner-self

Nothing to lose
