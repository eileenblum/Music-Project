The darkness falls 
No eyes on her

The black dressed woman moves into the clouds 
I lay dying in the ground

Death is in vain 
I must return... 
I know I must return... 
There's no turning back...

This trip to hell and back didn't mean anything 
I've lost my senses, I cant return

Deleted, erased, forgotten by the world 
Another lonely soul 
I'm crossing the north
