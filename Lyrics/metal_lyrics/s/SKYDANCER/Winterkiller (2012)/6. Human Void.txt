Shadows watching upon an innocent man 
His empty hands show the sorrows he has passed 
A senseless war in the name of holy lies, 
and mankind disappeared

So Mother Earth, please stop this madness 
I can't conceive another genocide

One more day of raging fire 
in this torture chamber called religion 
Divinity is proud fighting day by day 
Humanity is lost

The Human Void begins to rise, when the night is falling 
Always comes the same conclusion 
The sands of time will bury your soul by the shores of death, 
no God will keep your memory

Coming down to earth under the sign of the cross 
to show the world the power of money

No respect for philosophical thoughts 
just an endless faith
