Misguiding the way day by day, surrounded by nothing 
the sound of their blood it's boiling inside me

I can't be proud of this, 
I didn't choose this path 
Maybe one day he'll leave, the inner rage it's killing me

The evil for the evil, it's nothing more than this. 
I cant control myself tonight 
Cruelty guide your hand, that's the execution protocol

Devil itÂ´s calling my name, I cant avoid the call 
He haveÂ´s the tools of despair, they all are set to fail 
He's unbound forever...

Now all it's said and done, and I have reached the bottom 
but all the hate has gone away 
The inner rage sleeps for now
