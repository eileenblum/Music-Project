( -Â¨ Now, come bloody winter rain, sending shivers to this place, 
cause this forest is alive, full of forsaken windÂ¨ )

A wanderer used to hide on the twilight every day 
With a torch as only guide, oblivion ruled his mind:

The Lord Of The Winter

Once awaken the forest wind, he summons the spirit of this land 
Skye's are getting grey, inspiration growing high!

On dead leaves I see destiny, it's full of your greediness, 
so I know I must stay on this season of cleansing rain 
Now the forest whispers my name, comforting me 
The shining drops helped me to stay into the waterfalls

Finished the ritual, the wanderer leaves the land 
Walking into a serpent path, he harvested the cold:

The Lord Of The Winter

To another time, another place...his steps he'll carry on, 
to seek the spirit and start the circle again

On dead leaves I see destiny, it's full of your greediness, 
so I know I must stay on this season of cleansing rain 
Now the forest whispers my name, comforting me 
The shining drops helped me to stay into the waterfalls
