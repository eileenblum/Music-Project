So many years in hell I've been 
So many nights of overwhelming guilt

...and my past had followed me... 
The days of grey, will never let me rest

Make me pay for my sins, 
reach the point of no return 
Itâs this what you call redemption? 
Make my life a living hell 
misguiding me day and night 
It's this what you call redemption?

...and on an angry day I heard... 
the Holy Light, was calling for my name

He awaken the flames of revenge 
Enough for now., to live in this empty shell
