Cruel wind of fate, you had cross this land
When the shadows fall carry on your way

I'm the only one who ever cared about me
I never owned your god, just be my own demon

I don't know why you had to rip my tongue
Now you left me alone, so alone...

I'll surrender... everything went wrong
Nobody will come, cause nobody will care

Cruel wind of fate, i don't wanna walk no more
Cause you are life. i'm am just departed

Opposing some resistance,
Maybe i can reach tomorrow
But now... i cant keep just holding on

I don't know why
Why they left me so alone
I'm departed, i'm departed.,
Stop playing now with my life
