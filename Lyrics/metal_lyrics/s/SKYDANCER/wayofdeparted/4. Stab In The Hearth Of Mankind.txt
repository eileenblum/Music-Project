Mother Gaia cries the death of a thousand sons
Still the sorrow will prevail on her mind

Empty souls always serving to nations,
And global conscience is feeling ignored

One of us is an agnostic suicider,
In the other hand he prays the grace the lord

Stab in the heart of mankind
In the heart of...

Stab in the deep of my hands
A wound in the deep of my eyes

You will never see the light again

Never trust in who i am

Follow the path of a mental disease,
Claim for the supremacy of the iron fist
