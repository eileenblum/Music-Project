Torn between day and night
Death in the forest cries

I have released my harm for the dying
Now is time to close the gate,
The ferryman waits...

Come, walk the path with me, a season of change,
Your demons and sorrows must now be released

I knew the lord of the lake,
Dressed with a pale moon
He don't take care of my sins,

... he just embraced me...

Now reaching the end, screaming their name
Your demons and sorrows must now be released
