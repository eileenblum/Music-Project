Welcome to "no-tomorrow" land,
Where the man come's to face his end

Deep down, deeper down
Where the trees cover the last ray of light

Find a place for the broken-hearted
Hope is here hanging down the rope

The sea of trees comforts the mind of lost lovers,
Taking the time to wait for them in the other side

For those who cried,
For those who lost their mind
For those who are dead in life....
Wait in the other side

I'll never forget what happened between us
The distance can only make me feel depressed
The never-healing wound bleeds over and over
I cant take it any more
Meet me at aokigahara

Rest for now, you're not alone
Rest for now thousands of corpses around
Rest for now, joinin' the nature forever

Run.. cry.. there's no hope in life
