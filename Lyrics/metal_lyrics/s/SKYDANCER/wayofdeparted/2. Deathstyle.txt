Destruction of an era, destitution of death-illusion
Nobody seems to stand and nothing is eternal

I saw manipulation, man-kind is lost
Society crossed my way and then torn me apart

Leave alone, i made my death style
Building my life upon the scum

Just killing time i made my death style
Teaching the others how to feel

Insurrection of population, war against yourself
Suicide become last hope and nobody is around

The inner forest raises dead, but an angel wait's you there
The hidden treasure is you soul, can't you recognize it?

I saw manipulation, it is the end times
Society failed again, you' re another walking corpse
