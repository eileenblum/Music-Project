Rage from skyes
Freezing the air
Crossed today

My rhyme:
Land of lusk

Guide my hand
Earth and Sky

Time will go on
Defend your ancestors

Fall to madness
Rot in hell,
Defend your ancestors

Men from north
Tried to break here:
Crossed the line, raped my land

This dawn I will fight

Guide my hand
Earth and Sky
