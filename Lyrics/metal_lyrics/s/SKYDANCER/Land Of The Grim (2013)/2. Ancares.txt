Since the beggining a tale of sorrow
Redeemed the obscurity
For my creation a forest God
Was protected from luxury

A sanctuary
Created for his solitude
The eternal lifetime
Protector of the woods
Spirit in the rain,
A whisp freezes the air"

I said
I will stay in the forest
A million years
Nailed here

Forever
I will stay, I will resist
And fullfil my deal

Then I was torn forever
To became messiah of mankind
All these cowards from misery
Crossed my way
And never let me rest

"He is the one
Who guides my hand
As servant this fortress
Protector of the woods
Spirit in the rain,
A whisp freezes the air

I said
I will stay in the forest
A million years
Nailed here

Forever
I will stay, I will resist
And fullfil my deal
