Day by day
I still remenber
Everything you have done wrong

In memoriam
Of those who cried
And the families you broke

The evil seed
That you have planted
Remember us why are we here

I don't care for mankind
I am One: Revolution
I don't care for mankind
I am One:Revolution

So the Devil have spoken
Spreading the fear forever

I have no time
To change this world
And the darkness is my guide
