A swamp made of gray
Lost soul into nowhere
Departed from the light
Standing in the shades

A corpse on the water
Corrupted by the time
Now the flesh is gone,
Purity remains

Away from the lie
All the burden disappears
Hope and despair drowned together,
Busted heart remains

The Mankind is so cold...
The future is so dark
Life is agony,
Death can make her free
A unspeakable being
Is pushing from within
The swamp is now her tomb
Beauty rest in peace

Away from the lie
All the burden disappears
Hope and despair drowned together
Busted heart remains
