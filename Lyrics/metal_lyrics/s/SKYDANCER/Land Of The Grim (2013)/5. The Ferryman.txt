Torn between day and night
Death in the forest cries

I've released my harm
For the dying
Now is time to close the gate

Walk the path with me
Season of change
Demons and sorrows
Must now be released

"I knew the lord of the lake
Dressed with a pale moon
He don't take care of my sins
And just embraced me"

So come,
Walk the path with me
Season of change
Demons and sorrows
Must now be released
