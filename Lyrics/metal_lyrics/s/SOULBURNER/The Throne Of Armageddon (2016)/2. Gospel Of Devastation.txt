Victory is now revealed,
A great Beast ov Torment being fertilized.
Ye sixth son ov an immaculate soul being sodomized.
Ye art ov butchery, crowned in burning flames.
Stormily conception ov a cursed child

Dominion.
Armageddon.
Kutulu.
Leviathan.

I am ye primal instrument ov torture,
Blasphemy made flesh.
-Ye Great Demon-,
With splendorous pride.
Condemned to ye underworld.
Ye glittering Horn-Crowned,
Father ov Sin.

Dominion,
Armageddon,
Shaitan,
Leviathan.

Before ye creation ov cosmos,
A battle between forces ov light and darkness,
In the impenetrable Night.
âMay those who curse days curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathanâ.

Preach the Gospel of Devastation.
Spread the Gospel of Death.

Conjuration of a Flaming God,
Shammash,
O' Kakos Daimon.
The watcher angelos, who does not care
What they watch!

Dominion,
Armageddon,
Moloc,
Belial.
