Moral decay, disease,
Dementia symptoms.
Catastrophe unprecedented.
Bestial carnage, cannibalism,
Massacres, genocide,
Annihilation, extermination,
Onflagration,
Supreme evil charge.

Blackening sun,
Rot being, civilization burnt.
Eternal famine,
Shameful fearful flock.

Philosophy of Mass Destruction

Satan's workshops,
Lost souls,
Manipulation preys.
Temples of Lies,
It is time to conquer.

Philosophy of massive destruction

King of world, hell on Earth,
Nuclear holocaust.
Maximum expression,
Insane endless ambition.

Blackening sun,
Rot being,
Civilization burned.
Eternal famine,
Shameful fearful flock.

"And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy".
[Rev 13:1]

The name of blasphemy!
