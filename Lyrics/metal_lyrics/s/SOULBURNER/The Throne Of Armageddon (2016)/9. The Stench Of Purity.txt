Proud sons of a worthless God,
Release your demonic pride.
Children of the darkest souls,
Fight by my side.

Marching over conquered lands,
Fly away and kill.
Blessed by the King of Shadows,
Rebel and do your will.

Possessed by crawling madness,
Their kingdom will be my throne,
Hidden beneath their scum,
The Stench of Their Purity.

Victorious over conquered lands,
Fly away and kill.
Blessed by the Fallen Angel,
Rebel and do His will.

Possessed by crawling madness,
Their kingdom will be my throne,
Hidden beneath their scum,
The stench of their purity.

King of Terror,
The Dark Messiah.
Azazel is my name.

See me coming,
For your soul.
I crave your pain,
Sacrifice.

Taste the pleasures
Of my blood.
I crave your pain,
Sacrifice.

Nations corrupted by my words,
Religions blackening their souls.
The pleasure of pain is my dogma,
Poisoning their souls eternally.

Victorious over conquered lands,
Fly away and kill.
Blessed by the Fallen Angel,
Rebel and do His will.

Possessed by crawling madness,
Their kingdom will be my throne,
Hidden beneath their scum,
The stench of their purity.

I am the serpent god,
Come and reign with me
At the left hand
Of the Beast.

Messiah of abomination
The pleasure of flesh is their
He can smell your carcass
He is behind your steps
Laughing
Taking revenge for his children
