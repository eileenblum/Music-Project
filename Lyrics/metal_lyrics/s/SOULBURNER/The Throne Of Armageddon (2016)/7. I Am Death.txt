I am Azrael!

I am the Call of the Fallen Angel,
The announcement of an endless war.

Prince of gruesome domination,
I am murder.

Pain,
Torture,
Suffering.

I am the corruptor of nations,
The kingdom of lies,
The majestic burning fire,
I am Death.

The bloody satisfaction of your torture,
The instrument of a merciless pain.

Taste the Pleasure of Darkness,
My claw beneath your skin.
I am the Hand of the Butcher,
The destructor,
I am Death.

Behold the arrival of the fallen angel,
The rebirth, the coming of the darkest Eon.
Soon I will be close enough,
To burn your filthy beliefs.

Taste the madness of Darkness,
My poison blackening your soul.
I am the path of the sinner,
The corruptor,
I am Suffering.

Your cries will never be heard.

Through the eyes of the snake.
The kingdom of sins.

Pain,
Torture,
Suffering.

I am he corruptor of nations,
The Kingdom of Lies,
The majestic burning fire,
I am Death.

Arising from a crematory of souls,
Killing all bastards saints,
Blackening the heart of mankind,
Hoisting the flags of Sodoma,
And corrupting the angels hearts.

I am the corruptor of nations,
The Kingdom of Lies.
I am the Serpent
That has turned into Murder,
Turned into the Almighty Death.
