[I]

From the Throne of War and Pain,
The flames reach all the skies,
Ready to exterminate the world
The Beast,
The King,
The Dragon,
The Holocaust in the Flesh.

A cloud of fire and steel,
Heralds of metal shine.
The flaming sign of Hell.
Prepare to die,
To suffer,
To burn,
Never ask for mercy.

Never ask for mercy.
Countdown to Armageddon.

[II]

A great army full of hate,
Great warriors fight with me,
Full of pride and rage,
The Beast,
The Blood,
The Sword,
My soldiers never feel afraid.

The Gospel of the Horned,
Have reach the eternal seas,
Doomed the world will be.
The Dragon,
The Force,
The Flame,
Forever will burn just for thee.

Never ask for mercy
Countdown to Armageddon

[III]

From the Throne of War and Pain,
The flames reach all the skies,
Ready to exterminate the world.
The Beast,
The King,
The Dragon,
The Holocaust in flesh.

A cloud of fire and steel,
Heralds of metal shine,
The Flaming Sign of Hell,
Prepare to die,
To suffer,
To burn,
Never ask for mercy.

The end is here,
The Flag of Hate,
The Throne of Blood.

The Beast is here,
The Death arrives,
The Hell is unleashed.

Countdown to Armageddon

There is no more time for your kind.
Your existence is just a waste of cosmic energy.
The eclipse of your age has arrived.
The Countdown has reached the Eternal Doom.

Countdown to Armageddon

[IV]

A great army full of hate,
Great warriors fight with me,
Full of pride and rage.
The Beast,
The Blood,
The Sword,
My soldiers never feel afraid.

The Gospel of the Horned,
Have reached the eternal seas,
Doomed the world will be.
The Dragon,
The Force,
The Flame,
Forever will burn just for thee.
