I invoke thee Lucifer,
High Priest of the Apocalypse.
Grant me with the power of Eternal Fire.
Let the flames of this Unholy War
Rise proud high up to the sky.
Let these flames bring eternal death.

May the blood rain from the skies.
May the fire rise from below.

I invoke thee, Oh Lord Belial,
High Priest of the Holocaust.
Guide our path with your iron fist,
Let your chaos rule upon this world.

May the blood rain from the skies.
May the fire rise from below.

May your fire banish all life (from this Earth).
May your fire cleanse the flesh (of mankind).
May your Dragon flames purify.

Like tongues licking this dying world,
I summon the hot winds of death,
That will turn this world to ashes.

In the final hour of creation,
I summon the Apocalypse,
That will drown this world into fire.

"And I will show wonders in the Heavens and in the Earth:
Blood and fire and pillars of smoke.
The Sun shall be turned into darkness, and the Moon into blood,
Before the coming great and awesome Day of the Lord"
[Joel 2:30-31]

Rise Leviathan!
