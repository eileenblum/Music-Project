In the night something comes
He wants to take your soul
Lust for pain, out of hand
Gather strength to fight against the

Demons...
Demons...
Curse... demons curse
Demons curse

Since you were a child
You always showed your wrath
Gathered demons
To feast on your soul

[Lead: ArÃ©valo]

Your faith I'll crush
Your soul I'll claim
Eternal downfall
Will be your gain

[Lead: ArÃ©valo]

Evil minds give us wars
Massacres, holocausts
Satan's got
His way
It's the triumph of the

Demons...
Demons...
Curse... demons curse
