I'll take my wrath
From the ancient ones
I don't want respect
I want them to fear and hate
This is my war
There's no remorse
The wild hunt
Now will begin

War
Death will possess
War
I'll destroy your faith
War
Ride of the dead
War
They reborn in me
Die...you will die
Look at the sky, you will die
War
Barbarian ethics never dies!

Rise your sword
The wild hunt began
Gods of war
Give me strength
I'll break your bones
And crush your skull
My eyes are flames
The sky turns to grey

Sacrifice of the sheep
To the gods on the solstice
Warrior souls, come to me
It's time to be free...
Powers of the dark
Awaken inside,
The ritual has begun
Warrior souls come to me
To fight by my side
