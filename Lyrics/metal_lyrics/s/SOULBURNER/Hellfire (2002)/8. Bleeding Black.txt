Raging plague entombs the church of Christ
Pestilent infestation all over the world
I am thy blood, what they abominate
I am the one baptized in fire

I'll spit at their God
I am your slave
I'll cut my veins
I'm bleeding black!

I am the Devil's breed, ravaging the world
Plundering at will as I walk this earth
Unleashed horror, blasphemy incarnate
Rituals of black blood, the ones that gave me birth

That's the sign of the chosen ones
We invoke the almighty curse

We invoke the ancient gods
Under the sign of raging hellfire
I'll cut my veins!

Under the sign of the flaming sword
I am your slave!

[Lead: GarcÃ­a]

Under the sign of raging hellfire
Eternal damnation
I'm your slave!
I'll cut my veins!

We are the murderers of divine grace
Obey the infernal legions' command
Pain unleashed, your soul is on fire
Slowly your blood becomes black!
