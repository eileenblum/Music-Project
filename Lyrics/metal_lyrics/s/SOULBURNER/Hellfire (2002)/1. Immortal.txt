Ancient rituals of blood
Opened the gates of hate
Unleashed from my dimension
To feast into the reign of flesh

Waiting...
Immortal...
Body...
To reborn...

I'll turn this universe into pain
Procreation of a new form of life
Supremacy of the coming race
Eradication of the unclean

Ritual carnage
Warfare begins
Baptism of fire
I shall reign for one thousand years!

Thousands yet to be slaughtered
Evil empire rises again
Rise from the ashes of pain
For the true evil never dies...
"Facing a power yet greater than knowledge,
An enemy that can't be understood"

Ritual carnage
Warfare begins
Baptism of fire
I shall reign for one thousand years!
