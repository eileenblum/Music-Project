Sentenced to fight
This is their sick show
We are close to Rome
Maybe we'll die

So take your sword
To kill is their command
Fight 'til death
From death you will live

Centurions will attack
Will Christians survive?

Shadows and dust
That's what we are
The stink of Rome
Depraved throne

Who gave you the power of God
So much blood on your hands
Depraved throne
The worst sickness of all

We are their toys
Play the game of death killing
Fight 'til death
From death you will live
