You might live
Your normal life
Nothing to worry about
Think you're free?
Well, think again
'cause you're my prey
You're the flesh
To feed the dogs
That are hungry again

Morbid pleasures, infest their minds
Their lust for blood, your flesh feeds them

Your time has come
And the nightmare
Has just begun
Open your eyes
In front of a video cam
You're a snuff star
Hold your last breath
This is your time

To be a blood-covered star

It's all true, all for real
All you feel is pain and fear
The sickest show in the world
Audience wants blood for free
The sickest show in the world
Movie ends with a gunshot and your scream
