Liar!

Follow me
Follow me
I'm the light
Your money I want
By the grace
of Christ
Kill your faith
Kill your faith
That's my command
Believe my lie
I am the wolf
Among you sheep

Killing your faith
Killing your faith
We are killing your faith
Unholy worms of Christ
Infesting your mind
Corroding beliefs

Liar

Hunger
And misery
Is all that I give
I bring the cross
For you to kiss
Your ignorance is bliss
Kill your dreams
Kill your dreams
Forbidden to think
Believe my lie
I am the liar
Feeding your faith

Sell your soul
The end of the world is near
Prepare yourself
Repent on your knees

Damnation!
