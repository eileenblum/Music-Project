Terror invades the earth
Pain goes on and on
No mercy, torture, rape
None will survive on the

Flesh garden
Survive
Nowhere to hide
Survive
Fight for your life
Survive
This breath is your last
Survive
Life denied

Rotten echoes of death
Decapitated, burned
They're so vicious for us
Nothing will remain on the

Flesh garden
Survive
Nowhere to hide
Survive
Fight for your life
Survive
This breath is your last
Survive
Life denied

Torture gives them pleasure
Their faces show no emotions
Evil kingdom rises
Death is their flag
None will survive

The dawn of a new order is their path to glory
Facing a reality of agony
Death is enthroned forever

[Lead: GarcÃ­a]

Lands forgotten by God
Carnage goes on and on
Fear takes control
War is imminent

Flesh garden
Flesh garden

Find yourself tortured and dead.
