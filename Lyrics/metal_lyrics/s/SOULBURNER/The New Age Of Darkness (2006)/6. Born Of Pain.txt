Spawned into this world
To join our misery
Born of pain in a world
That will reject you
It was not love but lustâ¦ what brought you to this earth

The unwanted seed,
Blessed by agony and despair
Under the chains of remorse regret
Abortion won't save you
Your fateless destinyâ¦ is to be born

Theyâ¦ say you're dyingâ¦ since the time you're born
Wellâ¦ you were deadâ¦ since you were conceived
Destinedâ¦ to never beâ¦ to never enjoy the pain of existence

Your fatal destiny is to be born
None will ever hear your silent scream

This sick world warmly greets you
The path for you has been decided
Is the destiny of the unwanted pariah
Not from love, you are born of pain
