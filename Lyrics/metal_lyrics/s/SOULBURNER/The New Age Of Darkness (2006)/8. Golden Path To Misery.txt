You kill, you cheat, you rape, you steal and suffocate other minds
But you, don't worry, you're just god's favorite creature
Servant moral, perpetual disgrace and with blind obedience
You hide in your feeble faith, your foolish religions are your golden path to misery

Why are you so stupid?
God won't save you now

You lie, you hate, you blind, you fool and poison all their hopes
But you, don't worry, you're just god's filthy ambassador
Servant moral, perpetual disgrace and with blind obedience
You spread your feeble faith, your foolish religions are your golden path to misery

I despise your loathsome lust
For your self-inflicted pain
To be sodomized by
Your cross is what you're praying for

You follow a dead cult that no longer means anything
An evidence of your weakness but for you it's your whole life

You break, you crush, you burn, you bend and subdue all their souls
But you, don't worry, you're just god's begotten bastard
Servant moral, perpetual disgrace and with blind obedience
You reek of your feeble faith, your foolish religions are your golden path to misery
