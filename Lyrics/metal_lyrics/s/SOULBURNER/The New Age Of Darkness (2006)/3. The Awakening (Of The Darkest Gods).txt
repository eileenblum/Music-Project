Open are the gates of fear and sorrow
Now your fears become a reality

You will hear the screams of their souls
The ones lost in the fire of the abyss
Now their weeping fills all the sky
And the reign of the light soon will fall

Is the time of the dark revelation
When hatred will be our new religion
Is the time of the awakeningâ¦ of the darkest gods

Prepare yourself for the river of pain
That will run across this damned world

Feel the black fire purifying your soul
The sword of the darkest ones enslaving your world
Open your eyes, this is not a nightmare
You'll be crushed by the fangs of the beast

You'll accept the reign of the dark ones
You will die by the Hell's sword of the truth
You'll know that your beliefs are a lie
Your soul will be one with the dark

Darkest gods awakening
Darkest gods awakening

Open are the gates of fear and sorrow
Now your fears become a reality
You'll drown in the river of pain
That forever will flood this damned world
