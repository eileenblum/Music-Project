Welcome to the greatest carnage
Of the 20th century
The stench of rotting flesh
Rises high up to the sky
The cries of horror fill
The corridors of madness

Blackest rites to satisfy
The ancient gods of warfare
For the procreation of a new form of life
Inverting the cross and twisting reality

The death storm
That we created
Is our real tribute
To the darkest gods

This trail of corpses will satisfy
Their elemental thirst for blood
We'll enthrone the ones who forever will rule this world
We're the dwellers of the depths of the abyss

Unholy rites
Burning the skies
Our mission is done
All life denied

Hell... on earth... will be our new order
A dawn... for the entities... that guide our hand
Hate... will conquer... in pain we will reign... supreme
