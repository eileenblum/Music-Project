It has always been like this
I damn the day I was born
You say that light guides us all
But for me darkness is my home

I despise you creatures of the light
I'm engulfed forever in darkness
Black clouds absorb me
Into its cold embrace

I will kill blind ones by your grace
I will love watching them fall on their knees
I will stain with their blood all the way

You are the chain that binds this world
God of the weak, god of the lamb, you are the scum

I want to poison the blood of the lamb
I want to darken the shine of your god
I want to see the fall of your souls
I want to be your cold embrace of darkness

Forever swallowed, in utter darkness

I'm gonna restore the new age of darkness
I'm gonna invoke the eternal blood storm
I'm gonna take away any peace from your world
I'm gonna be your cold embrace of darkness

Forever swallowed, in utter darkness

I will see your blood on my hands
I will crush your feeble beliefs
I will stain with your blood all the way

You are the chain that binds this world
God of the weak, god of the lamb, you are the scum
