Time has come, you'll feel my wrath
Unleash my vengeance upon you now
Your soul will burn in the hell of my hate
Your torture is all that I dream

Hatred!
Impale your head
Hatred!

Soon you'll face your biggest fear
As you know your end is near
Feel my hands around your neck
Choking you 'til your last breath

Breeding lies and harvesting hate
Desperately searching for a way
To hide away from your mediocrity

Liar
Loser
Bastard
None will ever remember you

Liar
Loser
Traitor
Your mask soon will fall

You'll reveal as you really are
An innate liar, a loser at heart
Your existence is nothing but a joke
You were just a waste of sperm

Hatred!
All my hatred flowing free
Hatred!

Liar
Loser
Bastard
None will ever remember you

Liar
Loser
Traitor
Your mask soon will fall

I want to see your blood on my hands
I'm going to erase the smile of your face
I want to see your blood on my hands
You're the fuel for all my hatred

Hatred
Anger
Deception
Your blood on my hands

Hatred
Anger
Deception
Your blood on my hands
