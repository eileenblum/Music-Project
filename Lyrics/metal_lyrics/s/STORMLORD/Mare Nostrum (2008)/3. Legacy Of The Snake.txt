[music: Caprino, Giglioni; lyrics: Bucci]

Stones on the altars are the icons where you live,
The only way for the disciples to sanctify the snakes
You keep many treasures,
The foundations of your realm are made of gold,
Bhogavati, where dreams chase reality

[Chorus:]
Ananta, the snake, where the master sleep
Kaliya, the king, slave to Krisna's dance
By water, by fire, the underworld they rule
By water, by fire, by fire, by fire

...All enslaved by Shiva's grace
Gods, watch upon us,
Let us reach the Shakti and leave all this pain
Called existence, let us be one with you

Bowls are now empty, we deprive our bodies of all the food for your glory
Great naga come free us all, at last - free us all, now
Kadru

Rise, ancient gods of nirvana, from above they stare
Cosmic lights drop on the earth from the lord Ganesh sacred eyes

Come worship, come worship the naga's flame
Their karma, their karma lives on
We bow down, we bow down to naga's faith, praying the gods

Stones on the altars are the icons where you live,
The only way for the disciples to sanctify the snakes
You keep many treasures,
The foundations of your realm are made of gold,
Sacred naga let us reach your splendour

[Chorus:]
Ananta, the snake, where the master sleep
Kaliya, the king, slave to Krisna's dance
By water, by fire, the underworld they rule
By water, by fire, by fire, by fire
