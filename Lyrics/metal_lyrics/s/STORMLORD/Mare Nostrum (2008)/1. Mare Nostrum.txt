[music: Caprino; lyrics: Bucci]

Across the sea they live, plotting against us all
A constant shade laid over our empire
A rusty nail into the eternal city's crown
Now is time to wield the deadly iron and to sail on

A thousand ships, the roman pride,
By Scipio's hand they're led to war

[Chorus:]
Rise, rise, let carthago pays
Sail, sail, across the sea
Rise, rise, let carthago fall
Fight, fight, 'till the end

The cato's worlds burn in the heart of every man
The salt must be spread on the ruins, nothing will remain
Oh mighty lord of shadows, hades, we're calling you

Come witness our triumph
Carthago delenda est
Neither gods must dare Roma,
On your knees or die

And once again the eagle hammered on these wasted lands,
Will show the power of roman soldier's steel

[Chorus:]
Rise, rise, let carthago pays
Sail, sail, through the sea
Rise, rise, let carthago fall
Fight, fight, 'till the end
