[music: Caprino, Bucci; lyrics: Bucci]

Machines are treading on our ruins,
By human hands they were built to serve us all
Face the revolution, time to leave our thrones behind
This is the day when the robots walk the earth

[Chorus:]
No flesh, no races in the age of cyber Christ
No blood through the bodies, neon karma is closing in

No room for weak emotions, pain or tears
The mankind spawn, watching us through metal eyes

Welcome my sons
My new Messiah

Staring at the clouds where laser angels fly,
Future looks bright

Gaze into a moon whose circuits light the night,
Gleaming through the rain
We celebrate our end

One mind to rule the nations
Mankind: inferior breed
One doom: annihilation
Mankind: evolution's prey

Let us burn

[Chorus:]
No flesh, no races in the age of cyber Christ
No blood through the bodies, neon karma is closing in
Neon karma is closing in, let your kingdom come
