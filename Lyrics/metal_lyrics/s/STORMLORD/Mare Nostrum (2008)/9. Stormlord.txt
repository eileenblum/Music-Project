[music: Caprino, Bucci; lyrics: Bucci]

When the light vanishes behind the clouds
We raise in sign of victory our weapons to the sky
As he comes the heavens are trembling

Under the mark of glory he was baptized in blood
 From the darkness of the night skies
The stormlord will ride, ride again

We kneel before you bringer of fear and pain,
Lord of the rain and lightning hallowed be thy name

Raised by fire and thunder immortal he became
 From the darkness of the night skies
The stormlord will ride, ride again

And when the battle is raging his fist will lead
All of us to the sacrifice
On this day, we will fight 'till death

Soldiers we are glorybound, the storm is on our side
Resound the horns louder, stormlord will be our guide

Burying in dust all the enemies' corpses, grass in bloodlike red
Some cowards try to run away, but no one must survive
All the omens tell our victory, no mercy
And the hostile steel we shall not fear,
We head for a doom of triumph
