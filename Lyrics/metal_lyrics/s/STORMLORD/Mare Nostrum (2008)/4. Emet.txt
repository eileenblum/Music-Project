[music: Caprino, Bucci; lyrics: Bucci]

I am the soulless muddy giant,
 From the water and the earth I was born
Yes, I am a creature of the Rabbi,
To protect the walls of the ghetto I live

Sons of holy writings, where magic and pure faith become as one
I am Yossel
See my body growing, I'm changing my stature day by day
I'm the Golem

[Chorus:]
To serve you all - this is my mission
I'll serve you all - no, I don't want the shem to be torn asunder

Restless and obedient, the guardian of the synagogue I'll be forever
Even when my body will return to ashes and to dust I'll be there
Ritual has begun - Emet

Spell all the letters of the name divine,
The sacred mystery of god
With the clay of the Moldava
Creation and denial must be engraved on my forehead
The Menorah's burning, the ritual begins,
In circles he walks around me while praying
My lord, I'm breathing!

I am the soulless muddy giant,
 From the water and the earth I was born
Yes, I am a creature of the Rabbi,
My mind is empty, to live, I need commands

Emet

As my existence comes from the power of a world,
My end is tied to only one letter whose presence changes
"Truth" into my death
Emet, Emet is the word
