[music: Bucci, Caprino; lyrics: Bucci]

These painful days now left behind engraved our souls,
Frustration and anger paved the path to our rebirth
Never forgive, never forget, again we rise
As you can see, betrayals, once again we're standing tall

Among the ruins fire burns, stronger than fate
When sorrow ends, it comes the time to face our weakness
Let the doors open wide to the
Dimension: Hate

Erase the past
The scum will face its doom
The scum will laid to rest
Drowned in blood

Embers below the ashes can burn the toughest skin
So beware, you liars, vengeance is a hidden blade
Catartica - all the ideals fall
Catartica - in the end, mercy lies buried in dust

My soul hides a song of melancholy, a tune from the times
When the gold at the end of the rainbow was kept just a whisper away
Collect the suffering and channel it inside,
A new light will crawl through the night and shine brighter than sun

Hypocrisy infects this earth like pestilence
The darkest sin of mankind, emptiness of mind,
Is turning humans into cold machines
And like machines of iron, they will leave nothing behind

Among the ruins fire burns, stronger than fate
When sorrow ends, will come the time to face our weakness
Let the rage led us to the
Dimension: Hate

Erase the past
The scum will face its doom
The scum will laid to rest
Drowned in blood
