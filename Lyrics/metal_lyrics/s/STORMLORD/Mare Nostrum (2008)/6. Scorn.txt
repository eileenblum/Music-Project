[music: Caprino, Bucci, Giglioni; lyrics: Bucci]

Brother on the bloodfields, father of all wars
I cross the heart of every human being
Don't trust if they are weeping,
The enemies are wolves among the sheep
Empathy it's a lie

And my face you'll see at the end of every weapon
Steal another life, the scorn you must embrace
And my call you'll hear while searching deep inside where
Breeds the will to kill, the scorn, the scorn you must embrace
The scorn you shall not fear

Blood is running faster, pumping all the adrenaline,
There's no time to think before the final rush

The leaders are now screaming the commands,
Honour, valour and obedience blind your mind
and choose your faith...now take my hand

Soon this blood red ground you'll walk
Can't you hear? It's the call of the battle,
In the name of scorn you'll fight
So trust your fury, I will justify your sins

When the day it's over, thousand bodies lie,
The victory is tasting not so sweet
Just call me primal instinct or call me the way you like the most
Since I belong to yourself

And my face you'll see at the end of every weapon
Steal another life, the scorn you must embrace
And my call you'll hear, while searching deep inside where
Breeds the will to kill, the scorn, the scorn you must embrace
The scorn you must embrace
