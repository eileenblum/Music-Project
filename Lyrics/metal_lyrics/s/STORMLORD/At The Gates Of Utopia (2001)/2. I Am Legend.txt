[music: Bucci/Giglioni/Scazzocchio, lyrics: Brigida Costa, inspired by the novel "I am Legend" by Richard Matheson]

Hear me! I'm the last one left
of a long gone kind,
I stand alone
But as sun sets and darkness falls with hundreds voices the air comes alive

And every night they're comin' out for me
With hate filled rage they try to force
their way inside
Knocking and banging they pound the door
And they thrash the windows' boards... the roof... the walls...

Listen! I'm the one your kids will be taught to fear, I'm a scary tale
'cause when sun shines the Earth is mine, 
that's when by my hand you will die

And every night I fight a war that's lost
Aware that even if I'm killed I'll live in your minds
Forever and ever I'll haunt your dreams,
My memory'll be enough to chill your spine

One more night shatters my nerves, and shreds my sanity away
Starving they scream their hunger as they try to draw me out
One more sunrise breaks the spell, releases me from this hell
To cast me into a new nightmare where nothing I knew has remained

I'm what you'll never be again, one of a kind
I am your fear
... your hate
... your doom
I am legend

Hear me! I'm the last one left of a long gone kind, I stand alone
But as sun sets and darkness falls with hundreds voices the air comes alive

And every night they're comin' out for me
With hate filled rage they try to force their way inside
Knocking and banging they pound the door
And they thrash the windows' boards: the roof

One more night shatters my nerves, and shreds my sanity away
Starving they scream their hunger as they try to draw me out
One more sunrise breaks the spell, releases me from this hell
To cast me into a new nightmare 
where nothing I knew has remained
