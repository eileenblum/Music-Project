[music &amp; lyrics: Bucci/Giglioni/Scazzocchio]

In shame we defile
Before our enemies
Forced to march
Under the Samnites' Spears

Seven years of wars
Have led us to this ruinous end
Seven years of wars
Were fought in vain

On a hostile ground that seemed to be
Protecting the Samnites
We were fighting though in our hearts the light
Of hope shone no more
Among the southern mountains lost
We quickly tired

With no supplies left exhausted we starved
Led by deceit towards our doom
Trapped in gorge, surrounded by woods
We were overthrown

In shame we defile
Before our enemies
Forced to march
Under the Samnites' Spears

Step by step, one by one
We bear the humiliations
Of facing our foolishness'es symbol
As we march we can hear their voices mocking us
Laughing, screaming, crying out their scorn
Our mouths are filled with the bitter taste of shame
Poisoning the blood - in our veins
Killing all our pride

On a hostile ground that seemed to be
Protecting the Samnites
We were fighting though in our hearts the light
Of hope shone no more
Among the southern mountains lost
We quickly tired
