[music and lyrics by Stormlord]

No man who beheld her could not fall
She had eyes of diamond and silken hair
Such a beauty was consumed inside

The fire of pride burned in her heart
That fire so many led to ruin
Ended by being the cause of her disgrace

Medusa dared to compare herself
To the golden armed daughter of Zeus
An affront the goddess could not bear

A revenge so cruel made her who
Was once by all loved and admired
Become a monster feared by the whole mankind

Medusa's beautiful hair turned to
A tangle of poisonous snakes
Horrible scales covered her skin
Her eyes grew cold

Her gaze as sharp as wind in a winter night
Could chill the blood in the bravest heart
Turning into stone whoever dared
Into those hollow eyes to stare

Her fate was so fulfilled

She lurked quietly in her cave among
statues of stone
Brooding over her hate
Shrouded in shades

Medusa dared to compare herself
To the golden armed daughter of Zeus
An affront goddess could not bear

A revenge so cruel made her who
Was once by all loved and admired
Become a monster feared by the whole mankind

Those who beheld, froze in fear
Drained of all their life
At the sight
