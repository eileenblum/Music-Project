The wind was whipping my face
glory is what I craved
As I proudly rode unaware, 
that soon I'd meet my fate.
Onwards we marched.
When the light of day light up
the field we were drawn up
ready to attack
the armies met with a deafening clang
yelling their battle
cries up to the sky
The Oracle "Most of man will fall
decimated by barbarian blades
hades waits, women mourn
'cause by twilight they'll be gone
to the Kingdom Of The Shades"
May Mars be by our side
a vang of brutal pain, I feel onto my knees
the steel as cold as ice cruelty bit my flesh
and I passed through...
I stand in dark, shadows crowd the bank
of the river styx
Hesr them moan
Slowly I approach the waters dark and thick
a boat is getting near 
for my last voyage
Burning eyes of fire, ancient bones
boatman of Hades sails to the bank, 
the time has come take me away

[Charon:] "You know the price, pay me and
I'll take you to the other side
the silver coin I keep in my mouth
is what I owe you.

[Charon:] Get aboard. 
I'm leaving light behind
Hopeless eternity is now calling me.
Once with honour I fought, fear I knew not, 
butchered my enenies lied, 
cities fell at my feet, forever gone
(are those days of glory)

[The Shades:]
"As we touch the ground Cerberus snarls guarding
this grim place. Hades welcomes us all with a 
sombre, warm embrace to the Kingdom Of The Shades"
