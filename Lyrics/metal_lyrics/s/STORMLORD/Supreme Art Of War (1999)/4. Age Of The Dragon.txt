"Veniet dies quo fulgor supra terram ubi ab 
aeterno sine nomine loca sunt surget. Ales se in 
caelo, rursus  ostendet deus. Novae aetatis 
initius flammis sacris vastatricibus lustratae, erit"

Blazing flames shine in the obscure skies
the desolation is in our hearts
freedom in spirits, glory in the soul
in remembrance of an ancient age
the over sea is keeping the secret
and magnificence of winged god
to bring us free from tiranny
the legend of the golden dragon is alive
Thunders of war, from a dark abyss
announce is coming from the over sea
to bring the peace, to give us freedom
to spill the blood of dark tiranny
for the ancient splendour
in name of the freedom, in name of the war
Lord of the  dragons now we are calling you

[Chorus]
"Brothers of fight, the time has come at last
raise our swords with pride and might, naked
steel will gleam tonight,
in the battle we shall win, for this glorious land"
Come from the sea, above the light
Lord of the dragons now we are calling you
I dominate this ancient lands with cruelty

your realm is over
pray me, believe in me, glorify me 
your realm is over now
Strong soldiers, brave warriors, (get) ready for the conflict
the ancient steel will bring back the peace
the sacred fire will burn the clouds in the sky
now we wait for the age of the golden light
The Age Of The Dragon
