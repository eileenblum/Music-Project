Immortal Heroes crusaders of justice
born in the abyss brothers of steel
unite they're marching through fire and thunders
wielding with proudness the sword of the woods
Hear Their battle cry
Hail Their sacred might
A thousands battlefields devoured by fire They've left behind
when the shades of war fell upon Their realm by cowardly hands They were dethroned
Now the time has come, the seeds of grief are grown up
in silence They return where no evil must dwell
Immortal warriors few they're in number
but cold and sharp are Their deadly bright blades
five fearless soldiers, one strong desire
the annihilation of the wicked spawn
Hear their battle cry
Hail their sacred might

Look at the far horizon - Riding the sunset they come
brave fighters ready to die - Under the sign of the sword
the target's achieved at last - The scarlet kingdom besieged
axes held high in the air - Fighting with unfaded rage

"A dawn of glory is blessing the land 
the battle is won, we hail you
the silver shadows of this victory
are leading your fate to honour"

Nothing but memories lasts, far remembrance of a gruesome past
now dead and gone like a stormy winter night in a bright spring day
a thundering pulse is coming from the twilight of the battle
how many legends will rise

Immortal Champions bringers of freedom
the cruel tyrant defeated he weeps
century of madness are ending this day
Lords Of The Storm your wisdom we enthrone
