I know the burden of being the chosen one,
every step I take the world seems to judge

I know the fire that lurks in every man,
someone calls it love, some other just desire

Torn between flesh and divine,
human drives against the Faith,
tell me, what should I choose
as Dido weeps my name?

Never I will rest my mind
sheâs my love, I must leave her
Dying a bit inside
as Dido weeps, as Dido weeps my name

Vast looming walls and towers 
begun and left undone, 
the works are broken off,
no more the city grows
Slave to this passion, we left ourselves behind
A sweet oblivion, a sin in the eyes of the Gods.

Torn between flesh and divine,
human drives against the faith,
tell me, what should I choose
as Dido cries my name?

Never I will rest my mind
sheâs my love, I must leave her
Dying a bit inside
as Dido cries, as Dido cries my name

âVenus, release this life
Hades, please, receive my soulâ

Forgive me, Queen of Carthago

The shining of a pyre reflecting on the sea
as my fleet is sailing away to distant shores
I feel your sorrow, I wasn't strong enough
to be your lover and not the bearer of Fate

Torn between flesh and divine,
human drives against the faith
Tell me, what should I choose
as Dido curse my name?

Never I will rest my mind
sheâs my love, I must leave her
Dying a bit inside
as Dido curse, as Dido curse my name

âVenus, release this life
Hades, please, receive my soulâ

Goodbye, my wretched queen
