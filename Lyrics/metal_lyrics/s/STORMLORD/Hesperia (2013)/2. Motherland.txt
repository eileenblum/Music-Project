For the Queen of Gods, the blazing fire
Was soaring high through a blood red sky
And weaving a shroud of crimson ash
And distress made for my fleet!

âWe were the fallen!
We are the chosen ones!
Once, we were fallen.
Now, we are the chosen ones
Of Ilium! We are the sons!

The foaming waves are calling, 
why canât you hear them?
Listen, the wind is screaming your name!
You shall answer! 
Acesta must be left behind, 
Thatâs the will divine!

We were the fallen!
We are the chosen ones!
Once, we were fallen.
Now, we are the chosen onesâ

Thus Nautes spoke:

âAeneas,
Now gather your soldiers
As the sun begins to set!
The skies command you
To bring back the glory of Troy!

Sail on!
Forget all your regrets,
Ride the waves and cross the sea!
To find an homeland, 
To bring back the glory of Troy!

Fato ti volle ramingo,
dai lidi violati da Ulisse
ti spinse per mare e per terra 
sino a lambire le italiche coste
Soffrendo l'ira celeste
nel Lazio porrai nuovi Dei
ed il sangue latino dei padri 
che sopra quei colli ergeran Roma 

The time has come
To gather the warriors!
Beyond the horizon lies the hope!
The skies command you
To bring back the glory of Troy!

Sail on!
Forget all your regrets!
Ride the waves and cross the sea
To find an homeland,
To bring back the glory of Troy!â

Follow your fate.
Out of the darkness a shade arose!
Follow your fate.
Father, speak to me again!
Follow your fate.
Of Dis Iâll wander the nether halls!
Follow your fate.
âTill my breed will be revealed!
