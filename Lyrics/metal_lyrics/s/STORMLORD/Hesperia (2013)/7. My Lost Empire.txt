Too deep for words
The grief my mind is calling back now
The fall of Ilium will blind my eyes with salty tears
Of Hector, the ghost stole my dreams
A feeble warning to save my life

Voices from the past
By moonlight I can hear them screaming
Up to the sky
Close to my heart
The memory of Troy remains
My lost empire

Our men
Like a leaf against the storm
In one night they were swept away
I was loyal to the shadows
Sword held in my hand
My faithful son and wife by my side

Forty soldiers born from the horse
Havoc bringer made of wood
Were the ruthless makers of Trojan doom

Close to my heart
The memory of Troy remains
My lost empire

Not even the sovereign
King Priamus The Wise
Was spared from death
Under the pale shade of a sacred altar

Achilles first-born child became among the sinners the worst man Pyrrhus

Too deep for words
The pain brought by this bitter story
Whose remembrance will blind my eyes with salty tears
This dying domain was a cradle of flesh
Where from blood and fire the eagle rose

Voices from the past
By moonlight I can hear them screaming
Up to the sky
Close to my heart
The memory of Troy remains
My lost empire

And when the world will fear your name
It will bow to my lost empire
And to those who gave their lives for you to claim the crown
For you to shine
