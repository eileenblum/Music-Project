Like nomads of the oceans
we searched for the land 
the prophecy told us about
Countless losses to fulfil this dream
Like mermaids the shores were singing: 
âCome sailors, for too long now
the salt has been thy lover 
and the chant of the wind thy serenadeâ

When the strength will leave your limbs
the voice of Gods will thunder:
Onward to Roma!
Ancient Mother waits for you to seal an oath divine
Onward to Roma!

These words, the priestess of Cuma,
possessed by the Archegetes,
spoke to the heir of Dardanus
prophesying war and victory

âI will lead you 
beyond the swamps of Acheron
This bough of gold
will be the key to wastelands yet unknown
Many trials lie ahead,
the path of darkness
you should not walk unless your faith is strongâ

When despair will grip your will
the fallen ones will cry out: 
âOnward to Roma!â
Ancient Mother waits for you to seal an oath divine
Onward to Roma!

âEn huius, nate, auspiciis illa incluta Roma imperium terris, animos aequabit Olympo, septemque una sibi muro circumdabit arces, felix prole virumâ
[trad.: âBehold, O son! By his auspices shall that glorious Rome extend her empire to earthâs ends, her ambitions to the skies, and shall embrace seven hills with a single cityâs wall, blessed in a brood of heroes;â - Liber VI, 781 â 784]

Be thy charge, Roman, to rule the nations in thine empire,
to crown peace with justice, 
to spare the vanquished and to crush the proud

When the strength will leave your limbs
the voice of Gods will thunder:
âOnward to Roma!â
Ancient Mother waits for you to seal an oath divine
Onward to Roma!

Onward to Roma
Onward to Fate
Onward to glory
Onward to Roma
