"Drag the witch to the forest,
so that she wont do any harm again.
Don't let her get away,
hold her! Tie her to the stake!"
"None of you will ever be safe from me,
you can kill me, but I just won't go!"
And in the silence she spoke her curse
"Executioner, quick! Come, bring the mask
the iron mask that will send her back to hell"
And a creepy mask was brought,
it had devilish features and spikes on the inside,
it was put to her face then a hammer
was brought, God no!

Putrid flesh still so alive mangled face
still holds its charm
consumed by rot she waits
to feed again a leach, a living dead
Those who pass by take my advice
and hurry home before sunset

"Executioner, quick! Come, bring the mask"
No mask will send this demon back to hell
