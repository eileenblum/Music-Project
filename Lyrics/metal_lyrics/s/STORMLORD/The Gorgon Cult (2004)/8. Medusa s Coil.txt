Let me tell you a story
happened to me
that changed my life
and will chill the blood in your veins
Lonely I was roaming
unaware of what could lurk beyond the hills
hidden in twilight's shades

Chutulu's spawn
older then time and space themselves
through the cellar floor it rises
Chutulu's spawn
a twisted geometry in her sight
The horror

The sky turned to black
I reached for a near shelter,
a gloomy house where an old host
was keeping a grim tale

He told me about the girl
who stole the soul of his son, she led the house
to ruin and pain and still she haunt that place:

Chutulu's spawn
older then time and space themselves
through the cellar floor it rises
Chutulu's spawn
I must escape from this dark mansion
Terror rising

Her long black hair it seemed to live
Reminding the ancient myth of Medusa

"Do you want to see the: thing upstairs?"
was the old man daring me?
"Stare at her portrait and she will come back to life"
and the painting started to move:
again: and again: and again
As I saw her image I understood
the truth was more than meets the eye
She incarnated the ancient ones
that should not exist
the unholy Necronomicon's forgotten breed
Possessed by fear I found my hand wielding the gun
shooting with frantic speed
'till the painting was destroyed
I ran away from that place and later on the road
a farmer told me that that house
was burnt six years ago
