Samnites,
the bravest breed of Mother Earth
thousands
of warriors hungry for revenge
swearing
to reach the victory
or to die gallantly
axes in hands

Under the holy curtain they
become as one

Those who
dared to refuse the sacred ritual:
their lifes
were taken by the soldiers' knives
slaughtering
the cowards with no pride,
in front of all the crowd
no one was spared

Sixty thousand chosen men
for war were gathered

Sixty thousand golden shields
were held overhead
shining bright

"over this battlefield
'till the last drop of blood we'll fight
gods, take our souls with you,
hear the oath of the legion"

Fearless
the legion is marching
for the honour of the Samnites

Under the holy curtain they
become as one

[In remembrance of the "Legio Linteata" (Aquilonia, 203 a.C.)]
