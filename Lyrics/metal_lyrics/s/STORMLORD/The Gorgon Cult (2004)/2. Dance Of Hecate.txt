It's getting close to midnight
the ritual shall begin
raise all the burning torches
to the queen of the moon
Hecate,
whose name is howled at night
at the crossroads
where three roads meet
let her take you down to the underworld

Hear as I invoke the name
of the wise old crone
who knows curses and death
and does not fear them, no!
Mother of darkness reveal me
the secrets of your shrine tonight!
It's getting close to midnight
the ritual shall begin
raise all the burning torches
to the queen of the moon
three faces, one goddess
dancing with dead souls by the light of the stars

Dance with me beyond the Styk,
where the crossroad is placed
where Persephone is enthroned
dance with me
Hecate
"Bright goddess who walks in darkness,
to you is sacred the snake which casts off its skin
to live again,
the black dog howling at the everchanging Moon
and the eternal yew,
which brings both life and death.
Hecate, shine upon us!"

Only your touch of wisdom
can light the souls on their path
while walking through
the Kingdom of the Shades

She who holds the knife that cuts
the thread from life and death I pray!

It's getting close to midnight
the ritual shall begin
raise all the burning torches
to the queen of the moon
three faces, one goddess
dancing with dead souls by the light of the stars

"Triple one,
I entreat your presence
at these sacred rites,
hear my call,
descend from your throne
and release the songs
of thy granite stones"
