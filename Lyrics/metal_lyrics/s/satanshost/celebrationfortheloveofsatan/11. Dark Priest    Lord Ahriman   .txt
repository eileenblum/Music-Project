I am Forever Ordained, A Dark Priest of SATAN
An Ambassador, To His Infernal Empire

I Have Crossed, The Gates of Hell
Ruler on Lands, Un-trodden
In Here the Present Now, Destiny Shining Down.
Ruler on Lands Un-trodden

Now as I Become, This Devil Incarnate
Adversary; Against Everything That you Believe
By Incantation, Spells of Chant
Through Fire, Flame And Blood Spilt
In the Name of SATAN, Revelation...666

Returned in the Image Of SATAN.
Now in Flesh; Living Demon

From All Blackened Depths, Where I Arise
Out of the North, Where Winds Blow Cold

I Am Old; Lord BELIAL

A Dark Priest, Demons Unleashed

A Dark Priest, Devouring You!!!

Summoned Forth, Evocation
Call upon, Dark-Divine

LUCIFER-LEVIATHAN-SATAN-BELIAL

Grant unto Me Wisdom
Grant unto Me Power
On this Witching Hour

A Dark Priest, Demons Unleashed
By My Will, By My Hand

[Lead]

Inside thy Black Mass, Realms of Darkness
Gathering Midnight-Power, Souls Will Bind Forever

In this Black Bible: Satanic Witchery
Demonic Netherworld Energies

Dark Priest, Demons Unleashed
Dark Priest, Devouring, Dark Priest

Feel this Wicked Evil,
As it Eats your Soul and Feeds on All your Energy

In No Reservation, Devoured; Incantations
Beckoned by the Night Divine

Echoes of Our Chants Are, Demonic Salutations;
In Reverberation

Feel this Wicked Evil, As it Eats your Soul and
Feeding on your Energy
