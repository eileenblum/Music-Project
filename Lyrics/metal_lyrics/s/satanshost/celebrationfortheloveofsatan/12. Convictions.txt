Born out of Darkness, Millenniums arise!
Tempters of inequity, Endless Sacrifice!

Convictions- Revealed before all eyes
Convictions- Unholy Lord of Flies
Convictions- All truths become a lie
Convictions

Your god all ready dead, faith ruined lives
On your knees ashamed, the abyss spits its penance

Convictions- Revealed before all eyes
Convictions- Unholy Lord of Flies
Convictions- All truths become a lie
Convictions

No regard for history, pathetically pursued
Suicide in sorrow, savior turns to dust
Hypocrites in league, the idiot parade
Ensemble of Evil, shall now forever reign!

Hate-evoking-reaching-for the truth!!!
Sinister-Sentinels spreading secrets of life!!!!

[Lead]

Governments and religions, mass enslavement of men
Collection of dead souls, empowerment of kings
On the wings of destruction, they engorge in their dreams
Infernal Magick, enlightment will set you free.

Spiraling into oblivion, as you fight for your soul
Jubilant pressed Demon, drink the blood of the old
Spiraling into oblivion, as freedom unshackles
Nations of oppression, obliterated before all

Fly, threw the plight, with delight, dedicate your soul
Cries , in the night, with sorrow, the veil of life dissolves

Burning falling ashes, of all deceit and lies
Flickers of Purity, burns before our eyes

Satan, Leviathan
Lucifer, Belial
Satanâs Host will lead
To Truth and Law

Convictions-
Convictions-
Convictions-

Satan, Leviathan
Lucifer, Belial
Satanâs Host will lead
To Truth and Law
