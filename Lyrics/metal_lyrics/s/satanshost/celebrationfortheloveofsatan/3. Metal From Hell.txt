Metallic battalions declare raging war
âWe shall take the world in our hands!â
Prepare the altar
Bell, Book, Dagger and Scourge
Supreme ritual
The power of Hellâs at our command

Devilâs dance in the moonlight
You can hear the fireâs roar
Corrupt thy nations at midnight
âWeâre the vicious dogs of war!â

Ten thousand warriors pounding
âMETAL FROM HELL!â
Screaming arise
Come from the land where Satan dwells
We shall serve until the end
As Luciferâs friend

Weâre the power
Weâre the force
Weâre Metal-
Metal from Hell
Where Evil dwells!
Metal from Hell
Where Evil dwells!

Soldiers of fortune
March for the Anti-Christ
Each warrior shows the Satanic sign
The smell of rotting flesh
A wasteland full of Death
Proclaiming we shall cause sacrifice

Devilâs dance in the moonlight
You can hear the fireâs roar
Corrupt thy nations at midnight
âWeâre the vicious dogs of war!â

Ten thousand warriors pounding
âMETAL FROM HELL!â
Screaming arise
Come from the land where Satan dwells
We shall serve until the end
As Luciferâs friend

Weâre the power
Weâre the force
Weâre Metal-
Metal from Hell
Where Evil dwells!
Metal from Hell
Where Evil dwells!
