We are the secret chiefs of thy world
Striving to find people who know
The meaning of true Evil

Welcome to our Kingdom of Hell
Take your time, find your place
Unleash the savage wings of destruction
Is this real, no, it must be a dream

Pay salute to the warriors of Lucifer
Dark prophets of the 21st century
We proclaim the standard of Satan
Is the standard of the strong

This is the dawn of the age of fire
Satanic wisdom takes its place
Unholy blessings of the children of Evil
Founders of the master race

We are Hell â Hell Fire
We are Hell â Hell Fire
We are Hell â Hell Fire
We are Hell â Hell Fire Club

Welcome to our Kingdom of Darkness
It wonât be long till you find your place
In Hell!

Is this real, no, it must be a dream
Is this a dream, no, it must be real

Pay salute to the warriors of Lucifer
Dark prophets of the 21st century
We proclaim the standard of Satan
Is the standard of the strong

Unleash the savage wings of destruction
It wonât be long till you find yourself
Under our spell!

Is this real, no, it must be a dream
Is this a dream, no, it must be real

Pilgrims of the age of Fire
Manifest in my desire
Unchained are the Legions of Lucifer
Pay tribute to the Syrians of old

This is the dawn of the age of fire
Satanic wisdom takes its place
Unholy blessings of the children of Evil
Founders of the master race

We are Hell Fire
We are Hell Fire
Hell Fire
We are Hell Fire
Hell Fire

We are the secret chiefs of thy world
Striving to find people who know
The meaning of true Evil
