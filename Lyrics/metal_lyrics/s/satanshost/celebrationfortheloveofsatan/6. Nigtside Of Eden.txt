Thunder from crimson skies
Where all Demonâs conjured
We are the ones who live under
Purgatoryâs Hell

Behold to the powers of the night
A true heart of fire
Burns for all eternity
Our legacy will grow

[Chorus]
In the vein of Satan-One celestial voice
Screams within the Nightside of Eden
Words of darkness defined
Burning within candlelight
On altars of flesh wisdom came to life

Barren is our crypt
Consciousness dissolved
Awaken primal spirit lost
Upon this unholy flame
Treacherous centuries solved
Reclaiming our throne
In unity evolved
Abyss spewed liberty

[Chorus]

Spells of lust and love
In a garden of poison
Majestic as she lurks
With the powers of the night
To open Hellâs Infernal gates

Within the Nightside of Eden
Temptation is your liberation
As they plant the seeds of Satan
In Satan our Savior you shall Rejoice

Burning down the charred walls of heaven
Within your imagination
Newfound senses of life, as the serpent exposed the lie
The fruit of knowledge and time, as the black hole bends the truth

Concentrated energies
Formless in thought
Black matter evolves
Immortalized carnal flesh

[Chorus]
