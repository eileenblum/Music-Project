Drawing Sigils
And now these Ancient Symbols
Weâre Summoning, Forth the Devil
Stains of Red, Black Satin
Under the night, We attack... We attack

Stone Chambers, Sacred the Isolation
Supernatural, Conjurations
Black candles burn

The night is filled, With Energy
Nocturnal Powers, We consecrate
Between the voids of silence, Awakening
Unconsciousness, Tunnels Setian
Eliminate your Enemies, A Bleeding Entity
Annihilate, Annihilate their Will
By your Desire, And your Belief

Raw pulsing Power now unifies
Unleash a New Power, On this Witching Hour
Form what lies within, Freedom that Devours
An Entity, a way of Life
That Consumes Life Force
Summoned from the page
Darken Rage: Satanic Grimoire
