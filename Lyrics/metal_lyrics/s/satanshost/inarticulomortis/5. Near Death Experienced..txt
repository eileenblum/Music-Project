A deadly anxiety triggers the epinephrine,
Leaving my body ascending out through the skull.
Vital all signs have seized, unconsciousness.
No tunnel, no light; Nocturnal ambience.

A glimmering glimpse into a paradise unfore seen,
Knowledge in knowing of things ~life after life.
Recovering gifts healing &amp; prophecy awaken life!
Gone beyond, Destitude.
Mortified~Ostracized Decomposed~Cremation
Burn!

Sorcery~
Ceremonial rite;
From dust we came
To dust we shall return.

Near Death: Experienced!...
Near Death: Experienced!...

Whole being, Suspended Kai.
Raptureâs demise~A sacred insight.
Hypnosis of sacrilege; A barren gate toll
Enter alone... Immobilized domain
Now disarrayed, Fear has turn to hate
Numb insane. Desolate death
Bereaved black force; Ancient sacrifice.
Nuances come alive, Dark wings soar.
Metals transmute ethereal elements:
Manifest alchemy.

Embraceable infinite parody
A molecular cycle continuing,
Universally one transcendent whole.
There is no sin as we know it here on earth
Only errors &amp; lessons of balance directing us.

Sorcery ~
Ceremonial rite;
From dust we came
To dust we shall return.

Near Death: Experienced!...
Near Death: Experienced!...
Reign Flashbacks ~ Reincarnate
Born!!!
