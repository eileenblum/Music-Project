Drones
It is foretoldÂ : Battles favor honest men
Wake up, this is fucked
There will be no reward in believing there is time to reform the masses or salvage the truth
ALL IS LOST
Fear is a monster that feeds on conjecture
Dulled by design; the world's greatest war is waged on your mind
Fear is a monster that feeds on conjecture
Time is a bastard that lives for disaster
Bear Witness:
We hold you in contempt for treasonous acts
We hold you in contempt; the line has been drawn
We hold you in contempt, and we will be heard
We hold you in contempt
Lo
It is foretold: villains almost never win
Wake up, this is fucked
There will be no reward in believing there is time
To reform the masses...
Fear is a monster that feeds on conjecture
Time is a bastard that lives for disaster
Release yourselves, free your mind
The time has come and man must die.
Behold: The weak, they find eternal sleep
We hold you in contempt
We hold you in contempt
We hold you
