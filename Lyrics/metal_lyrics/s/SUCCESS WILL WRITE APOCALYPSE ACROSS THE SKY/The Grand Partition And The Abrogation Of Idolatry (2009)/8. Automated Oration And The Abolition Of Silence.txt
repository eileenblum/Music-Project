Talking box... shut up. Shut the fuck up.
Endless instructions creating a constant waveform
Breathing life into dead air with arrogant bullshit
God help, I can't stop talking
God forbid there's nobody listening
Turn your back and I'll get louder...
Nobody listens when everyone's heard
Bleating, endless instruction... conjecture and paranoia
Losing the grip of sanity
Forces have destroyed your reality
The grandeur of it all seems beneath me...
But in the end of it all, it's all that will be left of me
Your mouth is a natural disaster
Your mouth is a natural disaster
Calling forth storms, plagues and violence... your silence can end this
Envision this:
The extinction of sleep
Every speaker is a vulture beneath.
Overdosed on information, comatose with resolution
Breathing life into dead air with arrogant bullshit
Creating a constant waveform of arrogant bullshit
Your mouth
