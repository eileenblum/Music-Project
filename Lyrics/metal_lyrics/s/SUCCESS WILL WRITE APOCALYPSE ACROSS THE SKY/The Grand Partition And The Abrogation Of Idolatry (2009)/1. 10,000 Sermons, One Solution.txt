Again it speaks
The voice of challenge
It calls to us from the highest point
Awake, demand your right of passage
Reverse settings installed inside your mind
Spoken in tongues known by all
Yet as strange to you as knowing what is right and what is wrong
Again and again, it calls again and again
The plea is real, reclaim the world...
Arise, it speaks; but can you hear?
Arise, it speaks; but can you feel?
Arise, it speaks; but do you care?
Arise, it speaks; and you must wait no more...
No more
You must wait no more
No more
WE MUST WAIT NO MORE
Arise, it speaks; but can you hear?
Arise, it speaks; but can you feel?
Arise, it speaks; but do you care?
Arise, it speaks; and you must wait no more...
Bestowed the choice is everlasting
The change is all we know that's real
The pain consumed must be revealed
The change is all we know that's real
The pain consumed must be revealed
Again it speaks
The voice of challenge
It calls to us from the highest point
