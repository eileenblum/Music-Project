Maggots writhing beneath the trembling ground of the New Vatican
The Holy Heartland
Moral inversion through practices of god
The Holy Heartland
Christ opens his mouth as worms fall from the sky
Christ opens his heart as worms fall from the sky
Vermin enthroned where sleeping giants lie
The golden idols are convulsing
Mahdi defiles the American soil
Orgiastic polygamy
Moral inversion through practices of god
Inbred and ebullient with open arms to disaster
Lo he will rise, and murder, murder us for our sins.
He will rise.
He will rise.
