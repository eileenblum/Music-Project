Willingly they barter progress for distraction, unified by their nebulous agenda
That with no need for sight will outgrow its eyes
Over time growing obsolete, devolving at great speeds; and becoming what it feared most: amorphous black energy
Cattle
Batteries
A wavelength lacking static, concepts are incomplete
A mockery of progress fulfils the prophecies
Retarded
The debasement of rights: you've created your lack of discourse tenfold
The ensnarement of hands, through the numbing of the mind
The undoing of man! Behold!
Get USELESS
Act HELPLESS
Play VICTIM to the system
You're USELESS
You're HOPELESS
NEBULOUS
Nothing begets nothingness; you know that you've asked for this
Numbing in extremity, and invocation to the end
Battle Apathy
Those with no need for thought have outgrown their minds
Over time growing obsolete, devolving at great speeds and becoming what it feared most: amorphous black energy
You asked for it
