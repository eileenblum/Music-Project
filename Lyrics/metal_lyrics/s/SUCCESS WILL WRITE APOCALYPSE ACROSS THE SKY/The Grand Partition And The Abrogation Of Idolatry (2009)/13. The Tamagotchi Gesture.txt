Endgame
Dominate
Undo everything
We renounce the world
Paradigms must be laid to waste, to face a greater enemy
Distractions will negate your reactions
Abandon these gestures of nothing... you're in danger
Bullshit amusements
Malignant
Relentless
Illusions of grandeur and valor...
In the blink of a life, you've wasted your breath
The Peace that you speak will find you in death
And nothing accomplished... fail
Failure
You nullify yourself with every indiscretion
You're divided, misguided
You never saw this coming because you left yourself behind
I warned you
NO splendor
NO savior
Obsolescence
Cowards feign innocence
Shrouded in malady
Fate knows no patience and will bear no sympathy
That with no need for sight has outgrown its eyes
Those with no need for thought are losing their minds
And the blame is all yours
Behold... Fail
Failure
You nullify yourself with every indiscretion
You're divided, Misguided
You never saw this coming because you've left yourself behind
I told you
No savior
In the blink of a life, you've wasted your breath
The Peace we all seek will find us in death

...and nothing accomplished
