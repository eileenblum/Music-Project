You came into my life
Like a bullet in the head
Shock me down, make me moan
Ride me 'til I'm dead

Fire your arrow baby
Straight at my heart
Make it happen baby
Tonight's burning hot

Fire your arrow baby
Make it happen baby

You rocked my world and my life
Will never be the same
Baby, I will let you take the blame
The fire's in your eyes
I'm full of thrills and chills
I know you want the same thing as me

Fire your arrow baby
Straight at my heart
Make it happen baby
Tonight's burning hot
