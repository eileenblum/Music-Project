Feel the need of a crazy night
My heart starts beating so loud
The black sheep of the family
Hot tires well sticked to the ground
Mark my grace, what an infinite space
Shoot down the highway of lights
A rolling stone in flesh and bones
Leaving the desert behind

It's my turn to fly
Your turn to cry
Down in the street of life road to hell
Right down 'til the end
Just some other bends
Down in the street of life road to hell

Falls of gold, treasure untold
Don't try to stop now
Be the dream, be the sin
The devil claims his own crown
No one can tear me down
Engine screams, forbidden dreams
Now every brake is gone
Time will come in mode: speed on
A rocket towards the sun

Undying shadows I can see
Somebody's calling me
Leave my soul in a black hole
The time has come for me
There's no magic spell
When hear devil's bell
Down the road to hell
Just one empty shell
Is my last farewell
Down the road to hell
