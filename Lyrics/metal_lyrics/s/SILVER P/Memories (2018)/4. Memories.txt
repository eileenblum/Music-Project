Mind blows
Sometimes I think's the right way
Sometimes I feel I'm just
A breath of winter wind
Scars bleed
I know I will regret those times
But we would never have gone
Down the same lonely road

Hear you singing
Confusing my head
Memories seem to live
Before my eyes

Here I stand
In this broken chair
Wondering, "How could I
Forget your name again?"

But those days are gone and
There's nothing left for me
In my darkest hour
Nothing I can see

Feel I'm drowning
In this sea I'm dying
No one hear me crying
All my life in shame

Hear you singing
Confusing my head
Memories seem to live
Before my eyes
