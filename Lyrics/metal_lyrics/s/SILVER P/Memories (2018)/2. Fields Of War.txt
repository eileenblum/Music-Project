Staring eyes around me
Watching every move
Leave no time to choose
There's nothing more to lose
Rain is falling down
My head will standing proud
Hopes are gone away
Won't face another day

Someone's is taking me down

Brothers fall beside me
Lifeless in their eyes
They're shadows in the night
Searching for the light
Sirens scream above us
Cannons so loud
Dreaming yesterday
Escaping from today

Someone's tearing me down
Smell of hatred around

No more sunset on fields of war
No more nightmare on fields of war
Raging lonely armies
Fight against the wind
Keep their lives alive
Is only fantasy
No matter how strong it is
No matter how will beside
We'll fight against each other
For eternity

Someone's tearing us down
