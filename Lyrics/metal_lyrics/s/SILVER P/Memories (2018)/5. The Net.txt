Fake reality. Ghost identity
Live connection to nothing

Mind facilities, suck vitality
Look how deep we are falling

Blinding my eyes, with only lies
Now it's time for me to kick you ass goodbye

Broken glass I see, wild insanity
Flying out road to nowhere

Before our lives turn into golden jails
Before our cries lock up in cage of despair

Blinding my eyes, with only lies
Holy symphony, in wrong tonality

Deafness fills up our ears
Blinding our minds, tell only lies

Open your eyes, start kick their ass goodbye
Blinding my eyes, with only lies
Start kick your ass goodbye
