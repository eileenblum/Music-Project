I feel so tired, I feel so lonely
Once in my life, just once only
Don't wanna hear what you say to me
So get out my way
You've told me lies, you've told me bullshit
Hate the people that to do this to me
Don't wag your dirty finger at me
Now show me the real you

I hate
Almost everyone of you
I hate
Everything you gonna do
I hate
More than you will never now
Don't wanna waste my time with you

Don't wanna see your nasty walking
I don't even wanna see you talking
You'd better know there's no joking
Play it straight down the law
Hate your ways, it's time to be gone
Hate the way you take the mask on
How did you hide your life for so long?
You can cry n your own

I hate
Almost everyone of you
I hate
Everything you gonna do
I hate
More than you will never now
Don't wanna waste my time with you
