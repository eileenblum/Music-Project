Darkness falling
Evil spirits calling
Tears are flowing from my eyes
The ocean's rising day by day
Earth is crying out for change
People's starving now
They need us just today

Wind
Fill my sails and take my breath away
Out of this world
Out of this earth
While you still can

Rain's stopped falling
Holy walls are crawling
Dreams are fading, far away
Rivers drying
Fores slowly dying
We mistreat the living
And no one cares
The time has come and we ignore
We're in the path of nevermore
I don't know if I can fight this anymore

Wind
Fill my sails and take my breath away
Out of this world
Out of this earth
Before it's too late

Wind
Fill my sails and take my breath away
Out of this world
Out of this earth
But now it's too late
