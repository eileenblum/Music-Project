In the streets, candle burning, ritual has begun
Memories, now release your cold stream right on me
In my dreams, time is running down

So let me tell you a story tonight
A tale of something warm and bright
How my life's been turned into
A vision in heaven
A shade in light

I tell you a story tonight
A tale of something wrong and right
How my life's been turned into
A prison in heaven
A shade in light

Lost in dream
Show me what's inside the place I live
Ancient steams
The only thing that give us hopes to see
Now I'm free
To spread my wings and fly over the seas
They are calling memories

Hold on, take as much light as you can
Hold on, take as much life as you can
And start all over again
