Watch our decaying nation
We are the kings of the fools
We wait to burn in hell

Night and day, they call me the lion
Fight and stay is all what I want to do
Silent decay, approaching the evil
Fire and flames, in a chilling last embrace
Watch our decaying nation, getting hollow
The king of the fools
Watch our decaying nation, we have no shame
We have to burn in hell

Come, lead my soul stormrider
With your horse made of flesh
You send me the stormrider to set me free
So lead my soul stormrider
We trample down our enemy
You send me the stormrider guiding my fantasy

Devils and demons are always within you
Behind the facade you can find the beast
All they betray, makes your soul hollow
Fire and flames burn you to the ground
You are a miserable coward
Scum of the world
You are the king of all fools
Hey, we want the change, it's not too late
'Cause we care about

Come, lead my soul stormrider
With your horse made of flesh
You send me the stormrider to set me free
So lead my soul stormrider
We trample down our enemy
You send me the stormrider guiding my fantasy
