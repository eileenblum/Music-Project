A storm rage through my soul
When you step out through the door
A night full of devotion
Desires in the air
The glance of deliverance in the white
Of my eyes
I know I found a part of heaven in
Your lies

Pleasure time fades in black nights
What you fear is what you hide
Take your heart to the wild side
Remember all the nights we tried

I feel the sun arising, chasing away
This dark shades
A spark of life to light the fire
Tonight we burn the sky
The wounds are finally healing
And now a new dawn will rise

Nothing will stop me on the road of love
