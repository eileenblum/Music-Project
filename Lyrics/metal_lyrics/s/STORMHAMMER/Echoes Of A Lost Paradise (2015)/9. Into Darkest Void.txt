My memories are disappearing
I can't remember, but I had another life
A better life for me
Embellish visions of a blind
Long time ago
But it happens it was yesterday
Colors fade to black

On my way faraway, I thought I have to go
On the of my heart, the silence began to grow
What I have always been, no more colors in my life
The last breath in my life is filled with dust and dirt

Sometime feels so alone, I have no longer much to lose
The cover of my life turns into a darkest void
Sometime feels so alone, I have no longer much to lose
The cover of my life turns into a darkest void

Somebody kicked me out of my dreams
I can remember, reality embraces me
I've try to find another way, another solution
The end does not justify the means

The world disappears in chaos in destruction
We have no longer much to lose, all turns into darkest void
The world disappears in chaos in destruction
We have no longer much to lose, all turns into darkest void
