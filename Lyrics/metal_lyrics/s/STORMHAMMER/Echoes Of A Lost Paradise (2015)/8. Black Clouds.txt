I feel your breath in my neck, but no one is behind me
Ugly memories (slowly) rise out of nowhere

Beyond space and out of time, I slowly float over the line
Burning all the s down, I drown in a strange sound
Do not look back
The future is full of surprise
The only thing you have to do, is to break this chilly ice

You lose yourself in black clouds, never looking back
Something is behind me, or is it in my mind
You lose yourself in black clouds, never find the track
Something is behind me; this fear will strike me blind

I am tumbling in the sky I shiver in an ice cube
Count the seconds of my life, while I'm waiting for a new dawn

Beyond light in a black hole I'm wandering from pole to pole
I burned all the s down I'm lost but never found
I can't get back
The future is full of surprise
The only thing you have to do is to break this chilly ice

I feel something is changing, changing all my life
These black clouds break chilly ice
And now I found an exit in this never ending game
Guided by the holy flame

Force of our fate, force of our heart
