How was it like before?
If someone should ask me

In the beginning everything was very easy
I had a stuffy simple life
I was nobody without a goal
A victim of society, a victim of myself

(Your heart) is wide as the ocean, wide as the sea
I wish you have a better life
Sometimes it's hurting me
Wide as the ocean, wide as the sea
I wish you have a better life
That's it, what I want to see

The devil on the right screams: you've done very well
The angel on the other side, the same damn me to hell
What is going on with you?
What do you think you're doing here now?
What do you think you're doing here now?
