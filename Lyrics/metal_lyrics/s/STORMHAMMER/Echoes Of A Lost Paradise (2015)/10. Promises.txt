You touch me inside the depth of my heart
And wake up feelings, they breaking me apart
Don't stop lying, the truth hurts too much
Hold on to your promise, use it for a crutch

There comes a time to keep all promises
There comes the time and you will see

And when you fall in a hole. No one's to the fore
They keep no stand. And you know life is a whore
And when you stand alone. No one is on your side
Just give your best and you'll see that the strong survive

Learn to distinguish, learn to choose the right
The time will come and you can see the lies
Stop the liars, before you fall down
Stop them now, don't turn into a clown
