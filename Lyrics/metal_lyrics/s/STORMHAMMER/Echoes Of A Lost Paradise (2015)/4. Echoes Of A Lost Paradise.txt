Of mans first disobedience, and the fruit
Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
Brought death into the world, and all our woe
With loss of Eden, till one greater man
Restore us, and regain the blissful seat
Sing heavenly muse, that on the secret top
Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire
That shepherd, who first taught the chosen seed

Standing with my back to the wall and drifting at the edge of time
Ruled by the kick to survive, and blowing you out of my mind

The hour glass won't turn, while the sand has run out
The keeper of my time, will guide me through your fraud

So lead me back home to the fire
Yeah burning deep inside my soul
Can you feel my desire in that chilly hole?
Feel my time will come

Lost in the shadows of the darkness in your heart
The shade of a flame sends a fresh beam
To keep me alive and to take you apart, now
I hear echoes from our lost paradise

How long is it since you left me? I can't remember my sweet vole
The time is ripe; I left this place, leaving my comfort zone
Now my time will come
