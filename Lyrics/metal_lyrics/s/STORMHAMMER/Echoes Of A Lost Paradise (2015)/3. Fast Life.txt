We're running slow, we're running fast
But we scurry past her piece
We are chasing what we miss, but we never
Get to an end
Our dreams we want to cash, from our
Last money account
Most got grind in daily mill
We grasp for meat and then we pay the bill

Hey come to me. Come to the point
Before you're gobbled by fast life
Now come to me. Come to the point
Before you are swallowed by the maw of
Fast life

We running slow, we running fast
Nothing's ever seems to last
Adore the power of the speed
The best is usually at your feet
Our fate and destiny, or do we have even a choice
Listen to your inner voice in every beat and
Streak in our life

It's the struggle of my life
Born to fight until I die
I hear some voices in my head
Paralyze and stun me until I'm dead
