Take a breath and say your prayers
See lord blood will pour again
On all banners blow different names 
Don't you pour out the vials of wrath 
Madmen make double games in holy war

Warship got in satanic fire
The flame of hate licking higher
An ordeal again starts holy war
How can you bless bloody battlefield crimes?
We have done in your name it's a shame
Stop holy wars

You're too young to die
Stay away run for your live
Say why shall we die
Run away will to survive

Angry old men with a heart full of hate
Stealing your soul and selling your fate
All for heaven's sake in holy wars
Go out for blood kill for your god
You die for a hypocrite nut
Turn your prayers wheel

You live for doomsday holy books deadly shades
You want boys to pray dirty looks our future fades
You're too young to die
Stay away run for your live
