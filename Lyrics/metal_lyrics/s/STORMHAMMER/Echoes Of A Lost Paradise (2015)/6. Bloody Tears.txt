Feel the vibrations of an upcoming thunderstorm
The bright light of the flash illuminates me my way
My soul is burning at the point of no return
The journey of life is no dead end street anymore

Bloody tears whenever running down
Leave scars and wounds remaining forever
Lost in the eternal nightmare of my memory
Hey are you strong enough to bear your destiny?

Now you know appearances are deceiving
And all your defeats are just thorns of the roses
You can make a mistake but take care who tastes your blood
Life appears in a bright light while your step out of the void

Bloody tears whenever running down
Leave scars and wounds remaining forever
Lost in the eternal nightmare of my memory
Hey are you strong enough to bear your destiny?

I feel these vibrations, whenever I fall down

Now I am proud, because I have fought for my freedom
Can I resist and all the vices washed away?
(I found my freedom)
