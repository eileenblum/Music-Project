Fighting for the empire
While all values expire
Lethal weapons in my mind
Main stream propaganda strikes me blind

The maiden puppets on the thread
Of mammon's head
Welcome on board Nagelfar
Hel will break the rule
Of the polar star

Ancient legends come to life
Restless spirits of the other side
They destroy the light of the rainbow
They have to prove their mettle
In a stupid useless battle

Stars colliding in the sky
Demons dancing in the smoke of the blight in the burning air
On my way to Valhalla
I don't look back and never turn around
On my way to Valhalla

History repeats again
Evil shadows crawl across the land
They repeat the lies of the good and bad
They have to prove their mettle
In a stupid useless battle
