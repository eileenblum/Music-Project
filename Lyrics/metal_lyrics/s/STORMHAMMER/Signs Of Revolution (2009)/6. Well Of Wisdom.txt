Coming home real world out from the wars of conquest
Unkempt fields where your future lay to rest
For their rise you have been ruined in honour
Snap at crumbs that drop off abundant tables

The sword replaces the word as law
Twelve wooden boards are steaming insatiable greed
Driven by fear

Life will grow through pouring reminiscence
It still flows while you sitting on the fence
Give them eye trouble with a holy water
Well of wisdom be on the inside
Well of wisdom

Blood will flow as power's bonding agent
Leaders rise on victory's blazing scent
You're allied with the devil
Who obscures your will

Life will grow through pouring reminiscence
It still flows while you sitting on the fence
Give them eye trouble with a holy water
Well of wisdom be on the inside
Well of wisdom

Your greed powers your weapon
Might's turning to right
Your mind is aiming to heaven
For a glory fight

Life will grow through pouring reminiscence
It still flows while you sitting on the fence
Give them eye trouble with a holy water
Well of wisdom be on the inside
Well of wisdom
Give an eye
