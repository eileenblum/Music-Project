You're feeling inside, life's beyond of your lies
Your poisoned mind is all wallowing in vile vice

Angels die for a new age at doomsday

Brood of hell
You came just to stain our sanctuary
(Stand side by side with Abaddon)
I feel darkness and pain, before the storm
Creepy sounds the horn, we fire the match

You wish you never were born, fly a flag

My heart is chilled, frostworks in summertime
I saw hell, black and white
She rings my bell calls from the other side
She rules the night and this day

Wandering through the darkness
Through depths of despair
All our hopes for release, vanishing in the air

Angels die for a new age, at doomsday

My heart is chilled, frostworks in summertime
I saw hell, black and white
She rings my bell calls from the other side
She rules the night and this day

You wish you never were born, fly a flag

My heart is chilled, frostworks in summertime
I saw hell, black and white
She rings my bell calls from the other side
She rules the night and this day
