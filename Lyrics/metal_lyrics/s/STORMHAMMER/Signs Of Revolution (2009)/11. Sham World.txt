My fate seems to rive
All the dreams of my life
All occasions rush
On highways just like the nights in the nights

Sham world what's your life?
Sham world hang on to your love

Walk on water you believe in me
Don't forget the spirit I could be the way
Won't you follow to the point of no return
You can't stop the fire in which you burn

Sham world what's your life?
Sham world hang on to your love

When you like tomorrow forget your yesterday
Will your dare to follow?
Your dreams thorny way in this vapour
You breath in thin air
It's my passion to live in that flair

Won't you follow to the point of no return
You can't stop the fire in which you burn

Sham world what's your life?
Sham world hang on to your love
