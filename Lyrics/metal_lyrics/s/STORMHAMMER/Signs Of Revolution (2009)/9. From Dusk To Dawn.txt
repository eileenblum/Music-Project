I feel the flame in your heart slowly fade
And all your dreams vanish in the shade
I still feel at the turn of the tide
The last beams fall into the night
I close my eyes and open my mind
Memories fly with the clouds in the sky
A wistful glance sweeps out of my eye
I walk on air love always flare (in magic nights)
I whisper your name and I wish to hold you tight

Just you and me wandering from dusk to dawn
In these magic nights our hearts melt to one

Wake up shake up your chimera
So shut up your sepulchral voice which put a spell on me
At the edge of the night appears a beam of light
I feel the flame in my heart
Save your soul and save your heart
I walk on air love always flare
I whisper your name and I wish to hold you tight

Just you and me wandering from dusk to dawn
In these magic nights our hearts melt to one

Memories fly with the clouds in the sky
A wistful glance sweeps out of my eye
I still feel at the turn of the tide
The last beams fall into the night
I close my eyes and open my mind
I feel the flame in my heart
Save your soul and save your heart
I walk on air love always flare
I whisper your name and I wish to hold you tight

Just you and me wandering from dusk to dawn
In these magic nights our hearts melt to one

Just you and me wandering from dusk to dawn
In these magic nights our hearts melt to one
