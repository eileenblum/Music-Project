We came from the sky seed in the wheel of life
We're returning when we die in shady world we thrive
We're trying to reach our aim, stronger everytime
We're starting a new circle to meet our destiny
What you will bring to bear finally is there to go on

On the other side, all spirits take a ride
Climbing through the tide

Bridges to eternity
Melt rainbows into light, close the gap of night
Bridges of eternity
Are crossing time and space are made of cosmic haze

The night will fall to cast of bondage
No can't beyond the grave
You'll follow the call and you will ride for a fall
On the glory road of the brave

On the other side, all spirits take a ride
Climbing through the tide

Bridges to eternity
Melt rainbows into light, close the gap of night
Bridges of eternity
Are crossing time and space are made of cosmic haze
Climbing through the night on the other side
All spirits take a ride

Are crossing time and space are made of cosmic haze
Begin inside your mind lead to the end of time
