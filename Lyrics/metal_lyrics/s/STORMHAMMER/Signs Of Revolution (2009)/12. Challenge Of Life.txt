Close to the drive of the eternal wheel
I feel the breath that keeps me alive
I worship the vine, I can thrive and die
I praise to the lord, I scarify

Wandering through hell
I remind my fate under your spell I can't keep my date
Pass the deadline
Touch the eyes, if a new sunrise

(It's now)
We face the challenge of live at the line of good and bad
(Hail the sisters)
When you tempt providence you fare alive the bringer of light
(The hammer will fall)
I cause the strike

I feel the burden of ancient guilt
Stealing my energy, my power wilt
My eyes getting blind, my eyes can not see
My fire's fading in misery

Darkness damasks your face, behind your grease paint
The moon never shows grace without the radiation of the sun
The origin leads to the only truth

Close to the drive of the eternal wheel
I feel the breath, that keeps me alive
I worship the vine, I can thrive and die
I praise to the lord, I scarify

(It's now)
We face the challenge of live at the line of good and bad
(Hail the sisters)
When you tempt providence you fare alive the bringer of light
(The hammer will fall)
We face the challenge of live at the line of good and bad
(Hail the sisters)
When you tempt providence you fare alive the bringer of light
(The hammer will fall)
The hammer will fall
