Building the walls to shelter your own world
Deriving hope 'til it will be furled
Better civil rights made you a pleasant might
More respected than terrified

You tried to find the missing link in vain
The cock will crow the wulf tags on his chain
Forebodings in the air but no one will care
Don't cast the warnings to the winds

Now is the eve of downfall your power structure's hallow
Seeds of decay are shooting up
The turn of tide's heralding
Omens of agony

I feel it there coming my pain and agony
I can't stand the sight of my pain and agony

Forebodings in the air but no one will care
Lurid lull before the storm

Now is the eve of downfall your power structure's hallow
Seeds of decay are shooting up
The turn of tide's heralding
Omens of agony

You tried to find the missing link in vain
The cock will crow the wulf tags on his chain
Building monuments to carburize moments
Petrified eternity

Now is the eve of downfall your power structure's hallow
Seeds of decay are shooting up
The turn of tide's heralding
Omens of agony

You can't stand the sight
Omens of agony
We live on the edge of eternity
Omens of agony
I feel it, there coming my pain and agony
