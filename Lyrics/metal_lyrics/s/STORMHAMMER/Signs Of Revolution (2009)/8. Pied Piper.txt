Everyone tells me
The old fake of self destination
We're movin' on
We can't go wrong, guide my remote control
Dancin' on threads
Invisible threads of hidden persuaders
They know you desire
Lighting the fire to blow your mind

You dressed to kill
Is it your will to love up your ego
Paintin' you face
Shootin' a lace of fashion talk in your mind
We hang your threads
Invisible threads of his melody
He knows your desire
Lighting the fire to blow your mind

He catches your dreams and promise fulfilment
We're live in a lie, head in the sky

We follow the whistle with radiant smiles
Follow the pied piper his promise bequites 

Drown in the sound
In the underground of wishful thinking
We're movin' on
We can't go wrong chasing horizons
Dance to the sound
In audible sound of the faker
He knows you desire
Lighting the fire to blow your mind

He catches your dreams and promise fulfilment
We're live in a lie, head in the sky

We follow the whistle with radiant smiles
Follow the pied piper his promise bequites
