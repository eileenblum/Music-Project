Hey you came with me
Scratch in your faith into my heart
Here come thee pent up with anger
Ready to ride for a fall

Watch out the same old vultures
Look out for prey
Cast an eye upon you
You won't care about the snares
Puffed up vapours in the air

You will give vent to your rage
You will breakout of your cage
One word unchains the best inside men

Heroes are bleaching the letters of legends
Blood paves the way
Heroes fight for the right of conceptions
For a fair world

Signs of revolution, signs of revolution

Yearning, burning, turning on the wheel of time
The grim rapers raving through the land
You and I, eye to eye reach for the sky

Heroes are bleaching the letters of legends
Blood paves the way
Heroes fight for the right of conceptions
For a fair world

Signs of revolution, signs of revolution
