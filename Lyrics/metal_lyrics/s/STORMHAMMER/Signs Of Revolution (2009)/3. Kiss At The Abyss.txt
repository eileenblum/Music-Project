You put out the destructive flames
You gave the people bread and games
Marple wraps the world of brick
Reason state was your splendid trick
Beyond all praise in the dawn of Roms Golden Age

Kiss at the abyss, revel in debauchery
Kiss at the abyss, believe in fun guarantee

In the dark grows the brood of the snake
The worms know at all of your roots
The cattle's eating up all your fruits ready to relish
We tell you - hybris goes before a fall hear hell's distant call

Kiss at the abyss, revel in debauchery
Kiss at the abyss, believe in fun guarantee

Beyond all praise illuminate your history in reveling poetry

Kiss at the abyss, revel in debauchery
Kiss at the abyss, believe in fun guarantee
