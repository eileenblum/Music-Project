What ever I do is to pass another line
Wherewer I go I know I'm led by the nine
In a flash I ride to the depth of my mind
Whatever I find lead's to the source of life's grind

Close to the edge of eternity I learn to see my fantasy
Child of the night

You and me are dancing through the shade
"To ride on a razorblade"
We won't stop until our dreams made the grade
"To ride on a razorblade"
My fantasy is guiding me we both are made
"To ride on a razorblade"

Whatever I did was to keep the inner flame
Wherever I was outside the pervious frame
Was a trip to light up the lost paradise
Can you feel the wonderful touch of the sunrise

Close to the edge of eternity I learn to see my fantasy
Child of the night

You and me are dancing through the shade
"To ride on a razorblade"
We won't stop until our dreams made the grade
"To ride on a razorblade"
My fantasy is guiding me we both are made
"To ride on a razorblade"

You and me are dancing through the shade
"To ride on a razorblade"
We won't stop until our dreams made the grade
"To ride on a razorblade"
My fantasy is guiding me we both are made
"To ride on a razorblade"

You and me are dancing through the shade
"To ride on a razorblade"
We won't stop until our dreams made the grade
"To ride on a razorblade"
We both are made "To ride on a razorblade"
