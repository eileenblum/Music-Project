Evil powers penetrate the navel-string
Feeds his heart with deadly charm
His black blood gives proof of the true king
Your empire raise on unavenged harm

Lucifer take hold on me
I`m your servant straight from hell - mans` spell
Under cover of the night
IÂ´m preparing your death flight - tonight

Lord of darkness soon comes the hour to drop your mask
Lord of darkness give me the power for my task - drop your mask

Eerie shadows creep out of the slit of time
See crows gather in dusky sky
The lurid silence is his baneful sign
Ominous rings Kassandra's cry

Lucifer take hold on me
IÂ´m your servant straight from hell - mans`spell
Under cover of the night
IÂ´m preparing your death flight - tonight

Lord of darkness soon comes the hour to drop your mask
Lord of darkness give me the power for my task - drop your mask

Your dark cloak covers the whole wide world
While you all are collecting souls
And all the belfries are ringing in vain
None can find the light to escape the pain

Lucifer take hold on me
I got an angel's sympathy - agree ?

Lord of darkness soon comes the hour to drop your mask
Lord of darkness give me the power for my task - drop your mask
