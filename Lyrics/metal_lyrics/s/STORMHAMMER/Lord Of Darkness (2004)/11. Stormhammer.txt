We set our seal to the clank of steel
We`re a heavy metal band
The fires scintillate
Conjuring up the fate
We feel it burning in our chest

Welded in the forge of hell
Supplied with a magic spell don`t tell
Elemental force bursts out
Hear the gale shout

We are StormHammer
And we`re striking like a bold from the blue
We are StormHammer
Feel the flash leaping over to you

Can`t you feel our hearts are true as steel
Forged in the melting chambers` flame
We are ultra mundane
Kings of the metal fane
Don`t you play the devil with me

Never mind the centuries
Guarding timeless treasuries
Suddenly we can take shape
Bouncing out a the cloud cape

We are StormHammer
And we live for a heavy metal rave
We are StormHammer
I think we all ride on the same wave

We are StormHammer
When we get cracking your pussies get so wet
We are StormHammer
If you can`t join us baby drop dead

We are StormHammer
And we`re striking like a bold from the blue
We are StormHammer
Feel the flash leaping over to you

We are StormHammer
And we live for a heavy metal rave
We are StormHammer
I think we all ride on the same wave
