Lost in my mind I try to catch the rainbow
Far away all you distant stars are shining so cold
You cried shame upon my name
I've only myself to blame

Push off I'm dead beat
Caught in restless brain

The endless sea of sullen inspiration
Far away you left me in a nightmare
Don't ever wail, you never deceive me

Push off I'm dead beat
Caught in restless brain

Let off steam revealed when I lose you
Let off steam revealed when I lose you
Metal heart of steel
Metal heart can't feel
Metal heart of steel

Fade away cruel demimondaine
Leave me hurt, my face so fussed with blushes
You are an ice saint you freeze up my soul
Again and again and again
Push off I'm dead beat
Caught in restless brain

Let off steam revealed when I lose you
Let off steam revealed when I lose you
Metal heart of steel
Metal heart can't feel
Metal heart of steel

Let off steam revealed when I lose you
Let off steam revealed when I lose you
Metal heart of steel
Metal heart can't feel
Metal heart of steel
