Cancroid cells will penetrate the world wide web
Infect it with the kiss of death
They blaze their trail through firewalls
Waiting for the lethal call

They will do it on the sly
You`re doomed to die

Cyber mortis is a click away
Minds are not meeting keep the fiend at bay
Cyber mortis itÂ´s not not remote
They will kill you like a bat out of hell

Lights are fading on these days
Pride is turning into hate it cuts two ways
Activate a sleeping cell

The irony of hate is you pay in your downfall
Spinning at the wheel of fate
Lurker's ensnare you in your threads
Awaiting big brother's date

Everywhere at any time
Life`s not worth a dime

Cyber mortis is a click away
Minds are not meeting keep the fiend at bay
Cyber mortis itÂ´s not remote
They will kill you like a bat out of hell

Cyber mortis is a click away
Minds are not meeting keep the fiend at bay
