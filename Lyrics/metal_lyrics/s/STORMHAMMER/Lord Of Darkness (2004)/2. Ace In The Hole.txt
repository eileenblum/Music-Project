Breaking out of my life`s soap
I`m on the prowl I`m on the road
Bitten with a strong desire
I dive into a sheet of fire

I`m not swimming with the current
I kick up a big storm
My emotions are a torrent
Not easily, not easily to form

My time has come to take control
I heed the voice right from the bottom of my soul
I show my hand
My ace in the hole
I`m dancing on your grave
Your heads will roll

One smart apple smells the new trend
Knows the source of jive
The pack follows the lead lemming
Lured by the flashy life

I aim for the sky
I am on my way
Now it's up to you
Please don`t follow me

My time has come to take control
I heed the voice right from the bottom of my soul
I show my hand
My ace in the hole
I`m dancing on your grave
Your heads will roll

Now it's up to you
Please don`t follow me

My time has come to take control
I heed the voice right from the bottom of my soul
I show my hand
My ace in the hole
I`m dancing on your grave
Your heads will roll

My time has come to take control
I heed the voice right from the bottom of my soul
I show my hand
My ace in the hole
I`m dancing on your grave
Your heads will roll
