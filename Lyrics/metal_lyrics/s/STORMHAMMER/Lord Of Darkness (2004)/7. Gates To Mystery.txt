Close your eyes and ride on your feeling
First you dive into a black night
Sleeping powers slowly start free-wheeling
A wake will drag you to your darkest site

Run into a raging blast
A ship emerge on sheets of fire
With a spindle at its mast
Weird shades spinning fateful wires
We thought you know

Guide me the way to the midnight mountain
Through gates of mystery
Light pours out a purple fountain
Through gates of mystery - mystery

You standing at the borderline
Return illuminated or insane
Beware of the grasp of the water jug
Just take care about what you hug

A ship emerge on sheets of fire
With a spindle as its mast
Weird shades spinning fateful wires
We thought you know

Find your way to the midnight mountain
Through gates of mystery
Light streams out a purple fountain
Through gates of mystery

Weird shades spinning fateful wires
Sriven by the blast

Find your way to the midnight mountain
Through gates of mystery
Light streams out a purple fountain
Through gates of mystery

Find your way to the midnight mountain
Through gates of mystery
Light streams out a purple fountain
Through gates of mystery
