Silence lies heavily on the town
The wise old man is standing on the mountain
Looking to the future
Destiny whispers his name
Inside his heart a fire burns, the fire burns

Time turns life backwards
Forgotten souls swim in the ocean
The time is running out on you

The wise old man says
Close your eyes and you will find your dreams
The wise old man says
Hear the voice from deep inside of you

The cold moon shines
Wolves howling into the stormy sky
There a thousand ways leading to nowhere
Broken eyes in the mirror
The hourglass is standing on the table
The time is running out on you

Time turns life backwards
Forgotten souls swim in the ocean
The time is running out on you

The wise old man says
Close your eyes and you will find your dreams
The wise old man says
Hear the voice from deep inside of you
