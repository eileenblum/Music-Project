Wincing in embers of puppy love
You're spinning the wheels in reveries
Decay!
Come sorry ass
Come take the time

Time for living feeling mating
Time out of mind
You have been shined
Time was when mirage made you blind
Nay the hardest nut time will grind

In smoke and mirrors
You yank my chain
I break out the cage of vagaries

Time for living feeling mating
Time out of mind
You have been shined
Time was when mirage made you blind
Nay the hardest nut time will grind

I break out the cage of vagaries

Time for living feeling mating
Time out of mind
You have been shined
Time was when mirage made you blind
Nay the hardest nut time will grind

Time for living feeling mating
Time out of mind
You have been shined
Time was when mirage made you blind
Nay the hardest nut time will grind
