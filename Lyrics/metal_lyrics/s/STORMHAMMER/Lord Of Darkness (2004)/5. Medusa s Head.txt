You hide away at the world`s edge
Your sight`s as ugly as a deadly snatch
Who can stand the chill in your eyes
I see frost works rank round your soul
Eternal winter storms will keep you cold

Your hairs are vipers which let tongues dart
Spitting out poison from your evil heart
IÂ´m falling in love with the beast
The loathing has to decease
The hero`s blade ain`t bring us release

When she dies a magic horse will fly
Out a medusa`s head
Don`t believe these chilly eyes will die
In medusa`s head

You`re a challenge for the poor wretch
For all who got lost at the cruel world`s edge
You look with that chill in your eyes
But could not see your destiny
Out of nowhere the blade kills you foully

When she dies a magic horse will fly
Out a medusa`s head
Don`t believe these chilly eyes will die
In medusa`s head

Who can stand the chill in your eyes
The power of hate never dies
At her sight everyone will paralyse

Never take a look into the eyes
Out a medusaÂ´s head
Don`t believe these chilly eyes will die
In medusa`s head

When she dies a magic horse will fly
Out a medusaÂ´s head
Don`t believe these chilly eyes will die
In medusa`s head
