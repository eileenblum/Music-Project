The blinding rain clouds your eyes
don`t try to deny me
On empty promises you ride
Don`t drag your ass around in my fane
In a bleak mind dreams slowly die
Dreams will die
The break was when I crashed the gate

Here I am your private fright
The phantom of the night
Here I am my chilly breath
Has the foully smell of death
I hide in every face
Deep in your horror maze
You straying through the shades of fear
You`re captured in a frozen tear

The birds will sing at all times
Scoff at your worn soul
The sun is rising in the sky
You feign to be dead in your black hole
You can`t lock away a shadow

Here I am your private fright
The phantom of the night
Here I am my chilly breath
Has the foully smell of death
I hide in every face
Deep in your horror maze
You straying through the shades of fear
You`re captured in a frozen tear

Here I am your private fright
The phantom of the night
Here I am my chilly breath
Has the foully smell of death
I hide in every face
Deep in your horror maze
You straying through the shades of fear
You`re captured in a frozen tear
