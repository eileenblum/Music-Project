See the phoenix rise in southern skies
Paralysing my heart's sight
Scythe is gliding in mystic air
It makes you shiver
Fate is hard to bear
Which way leads me out of my doubt
Which way leads me out of this bad trap

Seven gates, what awaits behind?
Seven gates my way is hard to find
My fate I'll fulfill blind
Seven gates trace out the maze of my mind

Petrels raising in my soul
Blow away the clouds reveal the stars
Babe stars made just for us
Writing your name
Touch me make it come true
Forever mine
Repeat chorus
Don't break my heart again
Give me all your love
Touch me and hold me tight
Take a flight through this night
