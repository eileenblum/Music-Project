Masquerade who am I
I don't trust in anyone to survive
Here we hide we fuss and we fight
Never feeling the heartbeat of life
Deadly blight we all crave for love
I don't mind you feed me with hopes
Chain reaction we want you

[Chorus:]
Destiny
Feeling no pain
Destiny
Give me an aim

I feel mean, doubt it heals
Imprisoned in circles, chained to a wheel
Masquerade ride the beam
We all reach for the stars
Led astray we fall into the deep
I don't mind you feed me with hopes
Chain reaction we want you

[Repeat Chorus]

Put it right return the crown
Far away I hear the silent cry
Chain reaction we want you

[Repeat Chorus]
