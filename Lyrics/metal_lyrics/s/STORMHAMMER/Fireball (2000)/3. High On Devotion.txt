For your love I climb the highest mountain
I ride through the dead of the night
Be aware of the poisoned fountain
When you reach the top of delight
Luxury is what you admire

[Chorus:]
Lay down love on a funeral pyre
High on devotion
Sell your soul for your greedy desire
High on devotion

You got rich wrapped in veils of power
Feeling strong while you're dying inside
Getting cold in your diamond tower
Guilt shall shine where you hide
All alone with a cup full of sorrow
A flat taste straps your throat
Empty hearts are afraid of tomorrow
The price of wearing a fur coat

[Repeat Chorus]

Wreckage of love in a high on devotion
