Receiving the message we pray
I never believed in this nightmare
We try to displace your return
My flesh creeps but they want us to dream on
Listen to the death toll and dirges in the air
The end of the world is not far
Hell fires try to deceive you
Illusions are what you adore
Tonight demons roving free
We fight and draw back into the sea

I believe in sacred hearts
Pure like a new born child

Your light guides through the night
I believe in sacred hearts
They are not poisoned with greed

We fight and break through the night
Pandora's box opening screeching
I see signs in the sky
The four horsemen ride again
I hear them scream in the night
We never return to the saviour
Will we ever find the door
Tonight witches reign the land
Tonight god's angels are banned

[Repeat Chorus]

Tonight demons roving free
We fight and draw back into the sea

[Repeat Chorus]
