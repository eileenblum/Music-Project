We are here on the rock
While the sun sets in a purple sky
I hear the sound of waves
Holding your hand with a silent sigh
Summer wind is blowing through your hair
Stars fall in the sea

We take a glance at the beach
All dreams vanish in the sand
Children playing strange games
With dead birds in their little hands
Summer wind is blowing through your hair
Pain crushes your heart
But why, but why?

We are the guardians of the night
We are the soldiers for your life
We save your soul
I'm the keeper of my own
We are the guardians of the night

We are here on the rock
While the sun sets in a purple sky
I hear the sound of waves
Holding your hand with a silent sigh
Summer wind is blowing through your hair
Stars fall in the sea
