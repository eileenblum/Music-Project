Shadows of evil crawl through the land
Darkness forever and ever
An angel in armour has to be sent
For values worth to defend
You have yours and I have mine till we die
The star of war's blood shine in the sky

[Chorus:]
Fire beams wasting your dreams
I don't believe in your world
Fireball no scream at all
I don't believe in this world

It's like in Vegas the big video worlds
War-games without body and soul
I push the buttons to save the earth
Missiles light up the sky
You have yours and I have mine till we die
The star of war's blood shine in the sky

[Repeat Chorus]

You have yours and I have mine till we die
The star of war's blood shine in the sky

[Repeat Chorus]
