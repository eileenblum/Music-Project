I'm a clone with a desperate heart
A test tube baby top of science art
They're all opening the skies for me
I'm the future we create
God look at my fate
Unveil it now men's dreams come true
Test solutions demystify
Secrets of life I never die
I'm a non-aging man lost in your brain
I'm strong and I'm insane

[Chorus:]
Forever, forever young
Forever, forever young

Time turns on, stubborn its wheel
Oh bitter change for me
Johnny's gone I never found my freedom
Live in vain I'm lost in my pain
Time is cruel stealing my friends
Daddy's gone can't join his way
Goddamn time I'm losing guts
Let men never dream again
I die in my brain in my brain

[Repeat Chorus]

Forever dive from darkness to light
Seven gates in this endless flight
If we got a chance we did it again
Eternally doomed to do loving in vain
Lost in my pain
