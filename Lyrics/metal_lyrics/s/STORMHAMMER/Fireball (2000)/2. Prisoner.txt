Do not trust a stranger
He might be out of mind
You don't see the danger
How can you be so blind
Things are not how they seem
How can men be so mean
He grabbed what he was denied
To satisfy his pain you died

[Chorus:]
Prisoner inside his mind
Prisoner the pain makes him insane
Prisoner he rapes and mutilates
Prisoner the trust fades away

Who cares about the victim
We leave 'em to their fate
Lost in desperation
Pine away, abate
A dream became a nightmare
It's too late to care

[Repeat Chorus]

Things are not how they seem
How can men be so mean
He grabbed what he was denied
To satisfy his pain you died

[Repeat Chorus]
