Children of the dawn
At the brink of their fathers' graves mourn
Remind us of the done wrong
The distant ringing of the bells announce the king's approach

Dawn is embracing their hearts wrapped in ice
Dew falls from dawn's children eyes
Dawn is embracing their hearts wrapped in ice
Dew falls from dawn's children eyes

Shadows dance upon the graves
Into the glance of a new morning
The daily fight between darkness and light
Fallen angels dread haunting this holy place
At the edge of decay
The gorge of hell they face
While dawn's children slip into the day

Dawn is embracing their hearts wrapped in ice
Dew falls from dawn's children eyes
Dawn is embracing their hearts wrapped in ice
Dew falls from dawn's children eyes

Dawn is embracing their hearts wrapped in ice
Dew falls from dawn's children eyes
Dawn is embracing their hearts wrapped in ice
Dew falls from dawn's children eyes
