For far too long we suffered under your yoke
Grief turned to wrath the voice of freedom awoke
That's the last straw now we're ready to rise in arms
Rabble's curse gathered to break his charm
His enraged heart sweltered venom all over the land

We can't understand

Striding the blast of demonic raiders
If you find heaven you gonna find out tonight

Seek the light of the white candle
Disdaining fortune only kills
The flame is too hot to handle
But guides through the misty hills

The owl shrieks and you're numb by fear
Avoid to sip of the poisoned chalice
Amber of evil your heart sears
Chase away the mind of malice

The cry of freedom howled out in the desert air
The waste of blood was it foul or was it fair
Striding the blast of demonic raiders
If you find heaven you gonna find out tonight

Seek the light of the white candle
Disdaining fortune only kills
The flame is too hot to handle
But guides through the misty hills

Seek the light of the white candle
Disdaining fortune only kills
The flame is too hot to handle
But guides through the misty hills
