Take the holy oath of allegiance
'til death does you part
Guileful shines the street of chance
Are you still true at heart?
Every star dies away

Whip I can hear your slash cut in your flesh
Bleeding vows run out cold of that gash

They call it breach of faith
You've gone bad ways

Kiss you started a fire I am in heat
Unrestrained devote to a real treat

You call it breach of faith
I paved the way

Dare the leap in the dark
When the wild one is calling
Hear the leader bark
When the night is falling

I'm the thorn in the flesh of your promise
Bitter tastes to receive Judas' kiss

They call it breach of faith
I've gone bad ways

I am the mean decoy
While the wild one is calling
I'm born to destroy
Want to see men falling

Don't try to bury lust in canting dust
Blood runs hot feel it break through the crust

They call it breach of faith
Break out of that cage

Dare the leap in the dark
When the wild one is calling
Hear the leader bark
When the night is falling
