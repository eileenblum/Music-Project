Listening to voices which rumble incessant inside
He runs embarrassed he's haunted with the fury's shade
In the twilight zone
Rings the swan song
And the boatswain comes

In the dead of the night
When the sinner's soul died

Between two fires a lot of dreams ended in smoke
He was determined to see how his happiness broke
In the twilight zone
Rings the swans' song
And the boatswain comes

In the dead of the night
When the sinner's soul died

A faded beauty for too long has wallowed in vice
She sees in the mirror her demands now are ostracised
In the twilight zone
Rings the swans' song
And the boatswain comes

In the dead of the night
When the sinner's soul died

While the moon did shine bright
At the Styx seamy side
When the sinner's soul died
