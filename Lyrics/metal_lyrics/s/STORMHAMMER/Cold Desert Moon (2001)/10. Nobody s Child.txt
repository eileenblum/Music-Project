Look away you might see children cry
I glimpse their dead eyes while I pass by
Bodies are slight they will sell' em tonight
You'll find need everywhere nobody cares

In this world you're nobody's child
Doomed to go your own lousy way
No one warms their cold hearts they're nobody's child
There's no mercy till the end of all days

With French bread pretend to care
Spruced up with false charity
In the night of pity the glamour glares so bright
Unveiling their ice cold cheeks

In this world you're nobody's child
Doomed to go your own lousy way
No one warms their cold hearts they're nobody's child
There's no mercy for them all

Look away you might see children die
They rummage our waste while we're passing by
Open your eyes and don't shut your mind
Faint hearted men pretend they are blind

In this world you're nobody's child
Doomed to go your own lousy way
No one warms their cold hearts they're nobody's child
There's no mercy at all for nobody's child
