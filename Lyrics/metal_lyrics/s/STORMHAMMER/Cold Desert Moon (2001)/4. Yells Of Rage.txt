An eye for an eye
Your black spite clouds the sky
Now you row
We beat you on your brow

You've gone too far now my blood seeth with hate
You unbarred the sealed gate

All pent up rancour now blazes it's trail through the crust
You turned the knife in the wounds of pride 'til they bust
My belly wall explodes and I rave outta my mind
There's no way to bring me to reason

The fire is out of control
My eyes flash with anger and I can hear

Yells of rage
Are conquering the land
Take the gage
All the evil can't be banned

Yells of rage
Are pealing in the haze
Take the gage
Blood is seething in that blaze

We came to blame eternal grumblers for their sin
They gibe our lives 'til I jump outta my skin
You canted sympathy
Just means a red rag to me
Don't bottle up grief inside your soul

The lights are out the fuse is blown
My eyes flash with anger and I can hear

Yells of rage
Are conquering the land
Take the gage
All the evil can't be banned

Yells of rage
Are pealing in the haze
Take the gage
Blood is seething in that blaze
