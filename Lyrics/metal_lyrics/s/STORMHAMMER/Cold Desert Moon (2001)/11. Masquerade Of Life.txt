I'm standing by the window
The rain is falling coldly
Thoughts are dancing in my head
The world sleeps in silence
Darkness touches my body
Thousands of fiery eyes
From the other side of life
I want to get out of this masquerade

Masquerade of life - I want to get out
Masquerade of life - set me free

I can feel the change in me
The fire bird in my soul burns
I'm a wolf in a bad time
I'm not running in a pack
I'm fighting for a better time
Inside of me it's so empty
Pictures of the past pass my eyes
Silver arrows in the wind

I'm fighting for a better time
Inside of me it's so empty

Masquerade of life - I want to get out
Masquerade of life - set me free

Masquerade of life
Masquerade of life
