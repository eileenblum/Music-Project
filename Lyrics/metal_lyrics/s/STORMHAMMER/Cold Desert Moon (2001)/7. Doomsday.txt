What is behind the final door
Misgivings show an open sore
Your disbelief brings on decay
Soon we all know the time of day

I see it before my mind's eye
The flames of wrath blaze through the sky
Avenging angels in their chariots
Bringing down the scorching breath of death

Can't follow the ray of light
Cause it's the day of doom
Can't follow the ray of light
The hope dies tonight

The sisters turning on their wheel
The sun was black the moon was red
When the lamb opens the seventh seal
A black cloud calls up deadly threat

Can't follow the ray of light
Cause it's the day of doom
Can't follow the ray of light
The hope dies tonight

I wish you had the second sight
You burn in this fire rain tonight
Every blow tells in a long run
Our destination has begun
Still your soul remembers every dead
What you've done finally goes to seed

Can't follow the ray of light
Cause it's the day of doom
Can't follow the ray of light
The hope dies tonight
