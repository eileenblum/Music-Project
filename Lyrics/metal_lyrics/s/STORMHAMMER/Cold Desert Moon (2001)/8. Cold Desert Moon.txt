Before day you cross the floor
Abandon me so lonely
Luck's an enticing whore
Guarding the flame of love

Craving in moonlit nights for dawn
The king will strike the pawn
Strength prevails you can't deny it
All our vows turned out a lie

I make my way out in the cold
My buried heart starts to unfold

I feel flaring up the fire
While I wallow in the mire
In my mind I am in tune
With that cold desert moon

Silver rays at the horizon
Make my fears look phony
Who can I rely upon
I've to fight alone

Wandering through dreary nights of doubt
My heart is on the scout
It's your chance so baby try it
Don't follow in the cry

Finding your way all by your own
Under the sway of the unknown

See the stars glaring above
Sending you the spark of love
In my mind I am in tune
With that cold desert moon

See the stars glaring above
Sending you the spark of love
In my mind I am in tune
With that cold desert moon
