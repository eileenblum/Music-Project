Time will take him to a site where sleeping fires glow
The last dragon's fight once here ended with a blow
The blade crashed the gate through his mail of scales
He was convulsing with pain all his strength turned to remain
A blood-red tear dropped from his eye
He's keeping this feeling inside
And it crystallised in the dragon's tear

Feel his memory flow
Step on his wings and you'll know
If it's the way you want to go
The cry of dismay fills the air
Don't waste our earth without care
Live and let live or down you go

They just ride him out of spite 'til fires start to glow
In that drag he thrives
keeping this feeling inside
In the turn of the tide his mind's wide awake
Now he feels what's on the stake
There's a shine
He's under the spell of this charm
The necklace will do him no harm
Cry the dragon's tear

Feel his memory flow
Step on his wings and you'll know
If it's the way you want to go
The cry of dismay fills the air
Don't waste our souls without care
Live and let live or down you go

Mother bears three sons tonight a dire fate begins
In the lack of drive for harmony and insight
They ride for a fall at the tide of chance
When the half-moon crosses the star
You now well Armageddon isn't far
Remember your mother now son
You're feeling the feeling you're one
In the dragon's tear

Feel his memory flow
Step on his wings and you'll know
If it's the way you want to go
The cry of dismay fills the air
Don't waste our blood without care
Live and let live or down you go
