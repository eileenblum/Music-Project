Kings are killing in the name of the law
The crown empowers all this creatures
Men of the street have to lick 'em the paw
They're oppressed by false preachers
Those who commit breach of faith
Are condemned to death by fire

Men are tormented in the name of the law
Livin' in misery's life in the raw

They are tortured in the name of the law
They are burned on funeral pyres
They are oppressed in the name of the law
They are dying in the name of the law

Snares of the devil are blinding the world
They're chasing after shadows
You only survive as a curl
In this world reigned by heresy and slap-stick shows
They lock your soul in dungeons
Where it's finally starving to death
Kings are obsessed by hunger for more
They're speaking with the tongues of liars

Men are tormented in the name of the law
Livin' in misery's life in the raw

They are tortured in the name of the law
They are burned on funeral pyres
They are oppressed in the name of the law
They are dying in the name of the law

Epidemic disease will cover the land
While the lords adore their reflections
Of splendour and luxury
In the headway streets the rats gaining ground
While the knell is ringing continuously

Men are tormented in the name of the law
Livin' in misery's life in the raw

They are tortured in the name of the law
They are burned on funeral pyres
They are oppressed in the name of the law
They are dying in the name of the law
