Open the window, look outside
In the East Sun has risen and the morning is bright.
In the morning starts life, in the morning starts day,
But at home you hide and forever will stay.
You are a ghost filled, with sorrow of your long living years
Why not finally answer your life "no" or "yes".
You obtain in the mist of your mystical dreams
Now your home is a cup full of painful screams.
But it happens you can leave the torments behind
In this beautiful day you completely decide
To continue the life in your imagined world
Where the flowers grow, where's not darkness and cold.
Shut the doors, turn off light,
Close the windows and wait
Till the smell of death comes
And remove pain and hate.
Flavor of Paradise is the key to the gate
Made of crystal and gold monumental and great.
You don't know what you'll meet but the limit's behind
And your way leads to distance fancy and light.
Follow the voice of your innermost dream
But remember you'll never retreat.
You see a woman created of air and steam
To the Garden of Death your soul she will lead.
