Where the clouds are like the birds and the mountains are high
Two millennium long lives and old human tribe.
No one of tribal folk wished to go down the road
And all the new things htet were brought were an awful load.
They had a leader and severy laws
Which everyone obeyed with horror.
The nature gave them many gods
And all of them brought only sorrow.
For many years rained sacred paradise
And generation changed the generation
But once in mountains a stranger rised
As beautiful mysterious creation.
He told term if they leave there duty
They would discover just another world
Where passion rains with the help of beauty
Where there is no killing pain and cold.
He also added to that people main
That Gods are the phantoms that don't exist
And all the scenes of nature he could explain
And they would find there no mist.
But one who opened his heart,
Tried making good for poor folk
He only planted hateful dark
In souls by his amazing talk.
Who wants to leave his home of pains
And break all household in cruel way
To wath the dance of wind in plains
It's better to take stranger far away.
What happened to him only age knows
He fell beneath the sky and holy ground
But when the Moon is full the ghost shows
Disturbing peace it wanders all around.

He was, he is, he will be mighty
The genius is a danger to the rest
Impossible to live with this society
And loneliness for genius is best.
They are the children of awful nightmares,
Their blood is poison that kills all the fairs
Wise is who lives under transparent wall

In the bright castle which is hated by all
