The light of you star is goin' out
And you are left alone.
Everything that was spend
Covered once and for all.
The wind is blowing through your soul
It passed your body like shell.
As if Cold chains
Your arms and legs.
Death for you is reality
You life is only dream
Day by day, year in year out
Changes of fate.
The road is cutting through your throat,
But this is the only way.
Here you can't see any wall
And you're not alle to turn.
Steps are turning into pain
Moment into eternity
Nobody did't ask you to stop
No one could hear you scream
