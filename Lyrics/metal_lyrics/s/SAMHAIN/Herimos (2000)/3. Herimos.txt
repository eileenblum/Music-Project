In a vast sea of long lost times
Stands a granite rock of stable names
It splits the skies with it's top
It has been erected by the great
To rule the will of the masses
They promised benefits instead of freedom
Storm often raged in this sea
And hacked the ships that dared to sail alone
Into small splinters many fell victims
To the stable rock and many heroes
Who fried to fight with it
Were turned to dust
The raging storm, the waves hit the granite
The raping storm, the fear never sleeps
And you alone challenge them
The hero will die, but spirits is immortal
Bonfires burning high upon the rock
Filled slayers killers dreams with fetid smoke
Following their feast of blood
And this feast still lasts another methods
Turn our life to granite rock shadow
The threat is still alive
It's up to you how to take
The granite power and your fate
To breathe the air of total freedom
Or to wait for freedom up in heaven
That has been promised from above
And to be submitted to the will of the mighty
The raging storm, the waves hit the granite
The raping storm, the fear never sleeps
And you alone challenge them
The hero will die, but spirits is immortal
