My second chance they gave to me
To try my life again
A vanguard of the light and peace
I will become again

I will fight my enemies
The dark black of foes

Crafting my fate I become
The new bright newborn star

Giving light for all to see
Restart my new life now

I would go through depths again
To see you smile before me
I would turn the universe
To feel your skin upon me
I know I failed, to rescue you
From the dark depths of death
But now I know, I will be with you
When all of this ends
