From the dust of stars
A magic place is born
See creation's love
Point of space without a soul

Wicked hatred
Violent thoughts
Age of fouls
Spirits upon
I refuse to see it like this
I refuse to see it like this
This world deserves better
This world deserves better

And now my path that lies ahead
To undo the damage evil did
To cast a ray of hope where it's black
Where once were meadows 
They will be back
