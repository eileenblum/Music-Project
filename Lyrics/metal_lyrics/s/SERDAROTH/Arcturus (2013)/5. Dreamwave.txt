From the blackness of the hair
Of the bearer of my world
A dream is born like the
Waves are born in waters
It warns me as forever
Of the darkness in my path
I owe this one thing to her
I owe her to light that path

Memories fade away
And the only thing that stays
Are images in my dream
From the one that fades away

Memories fade away
And the only thing that stays
Are images in my dream
From the one that fades away
I must hold on to my final dream
Will it show me your face?
Will it tell me how to win this time?
How can I all of this erase?

Memories fade away
And the only thing that stays
Are images in my dream
From the one that fades away
