Transform matter to soul
A journey between the stars
To find the pale blue dot
One of the Ancient Worlds

And now I know the path
That leads to evil and all that is black
The birthplace of men and the foul Son
Where armies of destruction
Lay waste to the ground

Transform matter to soul
A journey between the stars
To battle darkness of their Son
