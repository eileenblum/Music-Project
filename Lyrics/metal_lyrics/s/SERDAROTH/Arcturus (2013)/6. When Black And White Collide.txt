Birth of black, sign of life
From the nothingness I rise
My essence is black thought
My body is dark space
Full of black, fear my thought
From the nothingness I kill
Surrender to me now
Or I can make this world your hell

The skies of Earth will shatter above
All will see the blackened sun
Furious storm will cleanse it all
Bringing light to the dawn (for us)

I have come to see you go
To your nothingness return
Destruction is your game
Seeding chaos in your name
Now I have all the strength
To make you pay for all
Through pain you earn your fame
But now I end it all

You lost your way when you first lied
Your flame burned down when a soul died
Corruption is set into your being
I have come to try and set you free

The skies of Earth will shatter above
All will see the blackened sun
Furious storm will cleanse it all
Bringing light to the dawn
