Vengeful fires cover me
My time to strike is now
The Black Wind stronger than ever before
My shield withstands his blows

Flaming glare of energies
Blinds all the lesser beings
Their fate hangs in the air
Their fate stares at their faces

The firelands beneath impel me
My last strike will be now
The Black Wind's shield is weakened by now
My Light will burn him down

The Black Wind stared at me
Never was so weak but still free
To cast one final spell on me
To lock me in dark for eternity

My last blow drained him
He fell right before me but
Cursed me to a faraway place
Dungeons and maze, escape must be

The Black Wind stared at me
Never was so weak but still free
To cast one final spell on me
To lock me in dark for eternity
