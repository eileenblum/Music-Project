I first saw their Moon
And the stars in the sky
Reborn on the black of night
On uknown shores I lie

I then saw the Earth
It was right before my eyes
A wash of light over the dark
Now their Sun before my eyes

As I stand before the road
I see millions of my pieces
Of whats to be my soul
As I walk upon the Earth
I know a journey lies before me
I must be bold and strong

The stars foretold the birth
Of a man with a strength to live
To see beyond all life and misery
But a soul with a blackened heart
Is out there to make all men bleed
Treacherous path that lies ahead
I must face death to be free

She taught me all I know
Knowledge of everything beyond
I'm prepared to face the War of Life
