Disturbed in a peaceful state
Struck from unknown point in space
Evil weakening our world
Desperate calls for help I hear
But none from the one so dear
Her voice lost in the pain

Her hands robbed of softness
Her face without a smile
How one can be so vile?
They cast spell so evil
When they took her life with help of
Magic from the Ancient Worlds

So they took her away
Dark power back from the day
Evil will return

Evil will return
