As I see the light that pulls me up
Darkness is fading away
Unbound and without a form
I have yet to see the day
The sins that brought me to this world
Behind me they stay
No more evil, no more war
My soul will find the way

I climb and I cannot fall
The one that helps me I can't see
White essence purifies
White spirit sets me free

White spirit sets me free
No more burden, no more sin
White spirit sets me free
No more burden, no more sin
