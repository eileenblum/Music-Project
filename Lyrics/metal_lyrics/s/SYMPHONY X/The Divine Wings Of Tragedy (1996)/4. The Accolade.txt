[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller]
[Lyrics: Russel Allen]

Into the morning sun
Down his chosen road he rides to
save the world
Cross of crimson, robe of white
Sworn to the quest for the rest of
his life

Play shields and wooden swords
Slaying dragons as a knight of
Arthur's Court
Trained to kill, to sing a song
Youthful hope to right the wrong

Sons of Antioch
An angel's voice cries out to him
Free the holy lands,
bring peace to it again

Across the seas through sands of time
Knight of the Templar
A charging steed through lands unkind
A legend forever

A heart of gold pumps within his metal skin
A noble line he carries on

[Solo]

Braving the bloody din
Silver spurs are justly earned by
strength within
Squire to knight,
like prince to king
Chalice of life completes the ring

Into the morning sun
Down his chosen road he rides to
save the world

Across the seas through sands of time
Knight of the Templar
A charging steed through lands unkind
A legend forever

To see the light he spent his life
to understand
The sword he once held tight,
falls forever from his hands

Across the seas through sands of time
Knight of the Templar
A charging steed through lands unkind
A legend forever
