In the house of my master
Behind the gate there is a bed
Oh, I hear laughter
I forged the iron bars that
someday will imprison me

Ooh, mother will you help me
Mother will you help me
To find a reason to go on

Out of the ashes of my youth
- I rise a man
And through the eyes of truth
- I finally understand
The way

I've been beaten with his words
and whipped with his lies
He will not break me down no
matter how hard he tries
Pray for my lost soul
Out of control the storm inside
me rages on and on and on

Mother will you help me
Mother will you help me
To find a reason to go on

Out of the ashes of my youth
- I rise a man
And through the eyes of truth
- I finally understand
The way

[Solo]

Out of the ashes of my youth
- I rise a man
And through the eyes of truth
- I finally understand
The way
