[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela]
[Lyrics: Russel Allen, Michael Romeo]

It was seven score and sixteen more
A dreadful scene to behold
Marble silhouettes, white
statuettes
Forever gaze into time
(Caught in a web between life and
death)

Visions dance throughout the
night
In the pale moon light
In the witching hour

Haunting minuet, immortal duet
Dance to the waltz of the souls
Stillness falls upon the aging hall
The fading chimes echo midnight
(Caught in a web between life and
death, life and death)

Visions dance throughout the
night
In the pale moon light
In the witching hour
