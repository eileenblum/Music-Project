Iâve been betrayed
By the angel of death
And the serpent who stole her last breath.

Feeding the flame
Though I pray for the best,
I prepare for the worst, just the same.

Dominator â Subjugator
Locked in an apocalypse gaze
Desecrator â Devastator
Set my world ablaze

In my darkest hour â with âthy kingdomâs powerâ
Hear my song and hear my plea
Put the pieces back together â nothing lasts forever
May darkest hour â let it beâ¦

Grant my request
Darksome master of pain
Incarnation of all thatâs profane.

Without a prayer
Under six black wingâs flutter
And six mouths of screaming despair.

Born a Liar â Falsifier
Trapped in this damned infernal maze
Crucifier â born of fire
Set my world ablaze

In my darkest hour â with âthy kingdomâs powerâ
Hear my song and hear my plea
Put the pieces back together â nothing lasts forever
May darkest hour â let it beâ¦

In my darkest hour â with âthy kingdomâs powerâ
Hear my song and hear my plea
Put the pieces back together â nothing lasts forever
May darkest hour â let it beâ¦
