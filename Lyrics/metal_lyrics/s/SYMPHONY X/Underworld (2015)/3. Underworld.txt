Treacherous words rise from the mist
From envious eyes and poisonous cold, pale lips
Gluttons of pleasure - Gluttons of pain
Vengeance by sevens - My sweet cursed children of Cain

Thrashing and clashing with specters
Hiding from the light - demons of death
Chaos and anguish perfector
Stealing their last dying breath

Driven by greed, slave to addiction
A massive decay of a most foul contradiction
Spirits of lust piercing the air
Writhing with sins of the flesh etched deep in their stare

Descend the abyss ever faster
Hidden from light - demons of death
Cursing the black-winged master
With their last dying breath

Soar through the flame
I call your name
Wrath and might get me through this night
Can I make it right? Or will you remain?

IÂ´ve finally realized, that long after laughter dies
I can't undo the things I've done - oh, the things IÂ´ve done...
When will my dark skies disappear - I long to see the sun

Soar through the flame
I call your name
Wrath and might - get me through this night
Can I make it right? Or will you remain... in hell ?
