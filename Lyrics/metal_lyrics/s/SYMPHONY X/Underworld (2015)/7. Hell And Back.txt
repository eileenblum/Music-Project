I have led the lamb into the slaughter
Ice flowed through my veins
I was my own worst enemy, still hellish memories remain.

I have shown the serpent into the garden
And wore the Mask of Cain.
Take a look in these eyes, where the past evil lies â
And feel my pain.

Oh â the hell's hounds drawing near
â¦ And my conscience isn't clear

I'm the one who whispered the words to Judas,
I'm the hangman's noose.
Though I try to repent, in a valiant attempt â
It's no use

I'm the judge, the jury, the executioner
Oh, the things I've seen
With an eye for an eye, kill the man, kill the past, kill the dream.

Oh â the hell's hounds drawing near
â¦ And my conscience isn't clear

I've been to hell and backâ¦
And I can't justify believing the lie, I slowly fade to black
Learning to live and die â I'm learning to fly.

Under the moonlit glow â I just can't let it go
Words spoke in vain, now fall like a silent tear.
As shades dance by candlelight â in the dead of night
And all of the things I yearn slowly disappear
And now there's nothing hereâ¦

Riding the storm, heading for a fall
I curse you all â be damned.
Through the haze, the sword that cuts both ways
A line is drawn in the sand.

Iron-bound â a will as cold as steel,
To conquer all and divide
Striking with an iron fist of will
I will not be denied.

On and on and onâ¦ No quarter asked, no quarter given.
On and on and onâ¦ Never forgotten or forgiven.

Thunders rise from the terror's eyes
Scorched by a heart drenched in black.
No return, I will watch it burn
Now there's no turning back.

On and on and onâ¦ No quarter asked, no quarter given.
On and on and onâ¦ Never forgotten or forgiven.

I've been to hell and backâ¦
And I can't justify believing the lie, I slowly fade to black
Learning to live and die â I'm learning to fly.
