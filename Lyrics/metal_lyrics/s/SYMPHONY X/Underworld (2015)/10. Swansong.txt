I stand alone
As my world comes crashing down
Some things are never meant to be
Accept your fate cause there's no second-time around
"ItÂ´s not the stars or sky that shapes our destiny"

Just a fateful glance
Just a fleeting chance in the wind
Gone forevermore

Hear my song, carry on
Through the lost and lonely air
Still I sing, can it bring
All the things that I desire?
With you, I wouldn't change a thing
Just for you, I'd do most anything
But now youÂ´re gone
And my swan song echoes on

I walk alone, like a stranger in this town
Is it best to fail or never try at all?
I face the shadows, as the sun is sinking down
"Some rise by sin - and some by virtue fall"

Just a fateful glance
Just a fleeting chance in the wind
Gone forevermore

Hear my song, carry on
Through the lost and lonely air
Still I sing, can it bring
All the things that I desire?
With you, I wouldn't change a thing
Just for you, I'd do most anything
But now youÂ´re gone
And my swan song echoes on

Goddess of shadowy play
Whose boundless power, divides the night from the day
Plains of woe, eclipsed from all sight
And wrapped forever in the darkest depths of night

Hear my song, carry on
Through the lost and lonely air
Still I sing, can it bring
All the things that I desire?
With you, I wouldn't change a thing
Just for you, I'd do most anything
But now youÂ´re gone
And my swan song echoes on
