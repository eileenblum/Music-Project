Steal away through the land of the dead â
Where angels fear to tread
Over mountains, the sky, and the sea.

Feel the light bleeding from a new moon â
Escape from the hands of doom
I never thought I could change what would be.

Break the chains of fear
I wonât shed another tear

The rise and fall
Although I fight like hell, thereâs just no certainty.
My battlefield lay scarred with empty victories.
Running from the past, from a lifetime of lies.
But the legend never diesâ¦

Here comes the horror, here comes the pain â
Flying too close to the flame
Into darkness, now falling from grace.

From the nine realms of woe, I arise â
Vindication in my eyes
Lines of tragedy carved deep on my face.

Break the chains of fear
Now it all seems crystal clearâ¦

The rise and fall
Although I fight like hell, thereâs just no certainty.
My battlefield lay scarred with empty victories.
Running from the past, from a lifetime of lies.
But the legend never diesâ¦

The rise and fall
Although I fight like hell, thereâs just no certainty.
My battlefield lay scarred with empty victories.
Running from the past, from a lifetime of lies.
But the legend never diesâ¦

The legend never diesâ¦
