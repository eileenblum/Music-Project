Realms of desolation - where phantoms frighten beasts
Through fiery rain, the screams of pain, eternal, never cease

Hell's abomination - boundless chains of woe
With mighty stride, the horsemen ride in a sable blackened glow

Into night - into fury
Horse of crimson she rides
Blinding light - kiss of fire
From the depths, arise

Wasteland of confusion - where nothing's as it seems
Beneath the skies, the daylight dies
Destroyer of all dreams

Bringer of misfortune - monarch's great abyss
And by his side - the queen of lies - unleashes fury's kiss

Into night - into fury
Horse of crimson she rides
Blinding light - kiss of fire
From the depths, arise

Feels like the sky is falling
My demons calling my name
From the other side
I'm being buried - feels like I'm buried, buried alive!

Bring down the hammer with furious anger
ItÂ´s me against the world
Bring down my fists with flaming malice
ItÂ´s me against the world

Into night - into fury
Horse of crimson she rides
Blinding light - kiss of fire
From the depths, arise
