Through me you pass - just take my hand
The ferryman whispers my name
The course has been set - lord of the damned
To the banks, over river of pain

We rise and fall - with the tide
On through the gates, where shadows await
See the glimmer of gold in his eye

"The bridges have been burned - never to return"

Sail away - on the winds of Charon
Take me to the distant shore
Lead the way - on winds of Charon
By the Gods, I can't ignore
The sight of his face - shrouded in death's cold embrace

Through me you pass - to the lacrymose plains
Though my passage comes with a price
A sky without stars is all that remains
To the shores made of fire and ice

We rise and fall - with the tide
Just say the word - cause there's no return
To the coast where the true power lies

"The bridges have been burned - never to return"

[2x]
Sail away - on the winds of Charon
Take me to the distant shore
Lead the way - on winds of Charon
By the Gods, I can't ignore
The sight of his face - shrouded in death's cold embrace
