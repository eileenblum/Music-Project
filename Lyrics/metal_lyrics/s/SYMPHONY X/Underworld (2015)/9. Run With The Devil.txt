Iâm on the run, nowhere to turn, theyâre on my heels
Lost in the maze, where do I go?
Am I insane, itâs just a game of life and death
Stay the course and ride the flow.

I cross the bridge, Iâm at the gates
Iâm out of breath, chasing the clock, Iâm out of time.
I hear the dogs, I feel the claws rake down my back
Thereâs no escape, no peace of mind

Oh â Just hold on
Oh â Just hold on
Iâm on my way to youâ¦

Run with the devil â run for your life
The truth of the moment, it cuts like a knife
Chasing a shadow â still chasing a dream.
When itâs âdo or dieâ, you know thereâs no in betweenâ¦

I see the fiends, theyâre on the move, they strike with fear
Give them the slip, I duck the blade
I knuckle-down, I roll the dice, I dance with death
Lost in the realm of light and shade.

My path is weak, it falls away, I feel the heat
The fires of hell beneath me rise.
Caught in a trap, thereâs no way out, walls closing in
Is this the hour of my demise?

Oh â Just hold on
Oh â Just hold on
Iâm on my way to youâ¦

Run with the devil â run for your life
The truth of the moment, it cuts like a knife
Chasing a shadow â still chasing a dream.
When itâs âdo or dieâ, you know thereâs no in betweenâ¦

Iâve searched the depths of hell to find the key
Iâve wasted time â now time has wasted meâ¦

Run with the devil â run for your life
The truth of the moment, it cuts like a knife
Chasing a shadow â still chasing a dream.
When itâs âdo or dieâ, you know thereâs no in betweenâ¦
