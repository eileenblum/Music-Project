[Lyrics: Thomas Miller, Russel Allen]

Garden of ice, ivory trees dimly glow
Maiden in white, led by lanterns of stone

Captured-by the light of moon
Diamonds and Jade-dressed in ashen blue

From the North, a mistress dressed in silvery blaze
The feel of her kiss steals my breath away
In the night, shadows dance through lucid doors
With a pale and frigid gaze

Lady of the snow, calling me
Her silhouette awaits in the cold
A kiss of stone, tempting me
Radiant lady in white, Maiden of the Snow
A winter's stare through veils that still my sight
In the night...she calls

Bound by this passion, I'm begging you please let me go
There is no escaping the feeling, I can't fight anymore

My desire echoes from a tale of ancient lore
As before, mystery fills my eyes
Beauty and bliss, I feel the hands that hold me now
I surrender myself to the night

Lady of the snow, calling me
Her silhouette awaits in the cold
A kiss of stone, tempting me
Radiant lady in white, Maiden of the Snow
A winter's stare through veils that still my sight
In the night...she calls

Lady of the snow, holding me
Her silhouette awaits in the cold
I can't fight anymore
