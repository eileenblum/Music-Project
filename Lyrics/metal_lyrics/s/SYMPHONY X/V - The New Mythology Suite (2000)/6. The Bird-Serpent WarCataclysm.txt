[Lyrics: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella]

Mocking the ways of Justice - the
Serpent's Dragon - Vultures ride
Storming the Gates of Seven - no mortal
man shall break our stride
Our flames engulf your good works and
our terror reigns supreme
Dark beasts that do my bidding by
thrashing, tearing down your dreams

"Gather 'round chosen people of the
Grand Design
Scorn the prophet's words - 'the device
of our demise'..."

The crumbling earth beneath the
weapon's roar -
Raining fire from shore to shore
Neptune's might - the storming waves
rise to make the Kingdom's grave

And all Atlantis cried - a million souls
crying out
Save the child from the Sea - she must
carry on
The secrets and technology shrouded
deep in mystery -
only One will carry on - Carry on...

"...the perservation of Balance was utmost
importance, and cast into the sea was the
child Ma'at, to find a new land...riding on the
breath of Poseidon..."
