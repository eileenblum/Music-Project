[music - Romeo, Lepond]
[lyrics - Allen, Romeo]

Lurking out of sight
Night shall fall and feed my frenzy
Beneath an eerie moon a change comes over me

Eyes glow by candlelight
a face divided in the mirror
my psyche ripped by daggers of my alchemy

Side by side with myself again
As midnight's curse descends on trembling hands

Oh - save my soul
losing control when the bells toll

Savage on the prowl
In the lamplight's glow - nocturnal
my breath hangs like ghosts in the evening air

This ill effect - a vile creation
of my design - abomination
the madness rages on and on...

Side by side with myself again
As midnight's curse descends on trembling hands

Oh - save my soul
losing control when the bells toll
Oh - feed my soul
I'm in control - when the bells toll

Oh - save my soul
losing control when the bells toll
Oh - feed my soul
I'm in control - when the bells toll
You'll be forever mine
