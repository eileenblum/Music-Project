[music - Romeo, Pinnella]
[lyrics - Allen, Romeo, Rullo]

I awake - without the sun
encased in walls of steel
terror so real - it blinds me

Rancid darkness steals my breath
The Pit - on the edge of death
The wells of Hell know not my name

I slip away...into black I fade away

Terrified - to the left and to the right
Spirits of the Damned, iron shadows cast
Hear my desperate cries
Shrieking demon - far and wide
praying for this breath to be my last

Awake again - paralyzed
I'm shackled to this alter
sacrificed to their God

'Inch by Inch and Line by Line'
The Blade - descending lost in time
The fiends of Doom they call my name

I slip away... into black I fade away

Terrified - to the left and to the right
Spirits of the Damned, iron shadows cast
Hear my desperate cries
Shrieking demon - far and wide
praying for this breath to be my last

"The Inquisitorial vengeance
had been hurried by my two-fold escape,
and there was to be no more dallying
with the King of Terrors..."
[Edgar Allan Poe - The Pit and the Pendulum]

Terrified - to the left and to the right
Spirits of the Damned, iron shadows cast
Hear my desperate cries
Shrieking demon - far and wide
praying for this breath to be my last
