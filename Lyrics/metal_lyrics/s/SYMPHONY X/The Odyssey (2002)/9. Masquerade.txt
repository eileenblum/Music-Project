[Bonus track]

Shackled in darkness
The forbidden portrait confined to its frame
Unbroken silence
A total misfortune and shame

Raging obsession
This mask of opression
It hides your aggression from view
This tearing suture
Renounces the love he once knew

You sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth
You disguise your insolence
Don't deny insanity - mediocrity

[Chorus]
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies

A fallen fortress sees him beneath starless skies
Subsiding deeper - the final farewell in his eyes

Unspoken hero
Distrust and thrusted within surmise
Seizing intrusion to unveil his clever disguise

You sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
