[music - Romeo, Pinnella, Lepond]
[lyrics - Allen, Romeo]

Needless to say, another day has passed away
Yet everything, and nothing, has changed
Awake I lie, my thoughts get lost up in the sky
Needless to say, nothing will change...

Maybe a mystic - with fortunes to tell...
Surrender my coin at the old wishing well...
Maybe the stars will align in the night...
To show me the path that is right

'Would've been's and 'could've been's
they waste my days away
the colors of my life dissolve and fade to gray

So many paths of promise
Indecision poisons my mind
If only I had seen the signs - so blind

Oh, so blind...

Oh, Yet I must journey on - on and on

A haunting vision torments me
It smothers and steals my dreams
I see an old man in the mirror
cold and bitter starring back at me

Here I am - at the crossing of life I stand
On my own - looking down the road
Hear my cry - answer me
Still I'm searching yet the truth is unknown - though the night is cold
I walk the road alone
