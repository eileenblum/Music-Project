[music - Romeo]
[lyrics - Allen]

Alone I traveled through the mountains
Led by a star fading west
When I came upon an ancient ruin of a church
and it was there I stopped to rest

Then the black and gloomy night that chased my footsteps
crashed down on me like a wave
Whispering through the trees and eerie breeze
carried a voice beckoning me to be her slave

In a whisper she said...

Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Embrace the night

From the black and twisting shadows rose a woman
beauty alluring to the eye
Oh her devilish grin, her moonlit skin
and long dark hair flowing down around her thighs

As she approached I felt the evil growing stronger
I waltz with the wicked within
Frozen in my place, she kissed my face
and in a storm of passion bathed me in sin

In the madness...she said...

Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Embrace the night

Then she weaved a mist - and cast me into the shadows

"Come with me, love eternally, forever mine"
"Set me free - in death we'll dance eternally forever and ever..."

As so the light, cast down from the heavens,
washed over me like wave
I awoke, it seems, from some crazy dream
only to find I was standing at her grave

In my nightmare...she said

Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Embrace the night

Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Don't ever leave me- never leave me

Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Embrace the night
