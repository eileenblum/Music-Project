[Japanese Bonus Track]

Yeah yeah

Sailing across the seas far and wide
We alone pierce the gloom of the night
We search for answers to riddles all this time
And with the sunset, our land fades from sight

Heading out (we are)
Far from home (and we)
Seek to conquer the great unknown (the great unknown)
Riding steadfast (on the)
Breath of God
We'll reach for the stars and beyond

Mission status: All systems go
Counting down the engine's light, ooh
Blazing progress, our beacon sears the skies
And with the moonset our planet fades from sight

Heading out (we are)
Far from home (and we)
Seek to conquer the great unknown (the great unknown)
Riding steadfast (on the)
Breath of God
We'll reach for the stars and beyond

Yeah yeah
Ride the night

Heading out (we are)
Far from home (and we)
Seek to conquer the great unknown (the great unknown)
Riding steadfast (on the)
Breath of God
We'll reach for the stars and beyond (Reach for the stars!)

Heading out (we are)
Far from home (and we)
Seek to conquer the great unknown
