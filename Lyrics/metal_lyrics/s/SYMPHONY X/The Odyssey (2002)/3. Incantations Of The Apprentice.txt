[music - Romeo]
[lyrics - Allen]

Through eerie reach of ancient woods
where lumbering mists arise
I journey for nines moons of the year
to where a land of legend lies

Deep within a stony lamp-lit hall
under falling grains of sand
Magic eyes glance magic pages
turned by magic hands

And as he spoke I watched in awe
A God's aura in his eyes
Master of all

Darkness fall - Spirits arise
Lord of Storms - Blacken the skies

With heavy breath, I break the seal
howls echo through the room
Blood lettings of a black Raven's heart
Conjure up the wraiths of doom

I cannot heed my Master's call
Lakes of Fire - writhe and swell
Foolish eyes - while spying Prophet's pages
unleash Barons of Hell

And as they rose I watched in awe
A God's aura in my eyes
Master of all

Darkness fall - Spirits arise
Lord of Storms - Blacken the skies
