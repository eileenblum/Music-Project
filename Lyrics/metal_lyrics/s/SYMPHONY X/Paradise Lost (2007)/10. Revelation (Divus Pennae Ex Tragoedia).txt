Against the wall - they see you
nowhere to run, nowhere to hide

Heroic Mask - The cracks are showing
a Faceless God to shape the Perfect Lie

Wounds of Hate have pierced so deep
they never die - my revenge is bittersweet

Lost in the night wandering alone
Try as I might to escape the fight
It never lets me go - I've got to find a way
A way to Rise above it All

Savior or the Fool - the mystery
fades into the cruel shade of night

This broken disguise can not comprehend
what was, and will be.... until the very end

Wounds of hate have pierced so deep
they never die - my revenge is bittersweet

Lost in the night wandering alone
Try as I might to escape the fight
It never lets me go - I've got to find a way
A way to Rise above it All

...oh, where the North Wind sleeps -that is when
we'll meet again... oh, where the shadows creep
into Twilight, I'll descend
Good and Evil, it never ends
You're just a means to an end

Lost in the night wandering alone
Try as I might to escape the fight
It never lets me go - I've got to find a way
A way to Rise above it All

Lost in the night wandering alone
Try as I might to escape the fight
It never lets me go - I've got to find a way
A way to Rise above it All
