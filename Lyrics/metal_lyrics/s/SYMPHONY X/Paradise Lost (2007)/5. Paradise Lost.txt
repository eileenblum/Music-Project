In the cold misty morning
gleaming rays awake the dawn
Here I stand - a stranger in this land
does your conscience betray you?
falling from grace -
feel the sun on my face
does desire still hold true?

Mystified by her beauty -
does the hunter pity his prey?
Under starless skies all
Love must die and fade away

Take my hand - divine or damned
Make a stand, seize the day
Yours or mine, damned of divine
Draw the line, come what may...

Looking down from ethereal skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all must say their last goodbye -
to Paradise

My yearning is silenced by angelic skin of white
Love conquers all for heaven's fall
this faithful night.
Yours or mine - damned of divine
Draw the line - serpentine...

Love is a tragedy
all that I have, all that I'll ever need
is right here inside
Let the winds of freedom be my guide

Looking down from Ethereal Skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all must say their last goodbye -
to Paradise

Looking down from Ethereal Skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all must say their last goodbye -
to Paradise
Say goodbye, goodbye, hold on!

...so I've cheated and I've lied
been the victim of foolish pride
and I've begged and I've crawled
and I've battled and bled for it all
now I'll savor the downfall...
of Paradise

Looking down from Ethereal Skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all will say their last goodbye
to Paradise
