Above all - high and mighty - will like a towering
steed - a Web of Conceit that I weave
More...wanting much more - grasping with
Envious Eyes - dark desires lead to words
that cut like knives

Frozen in your tracks... No remorse
Embrace the rack - Twisting down your spine
... 'till the End of Time

It's Fire and Ice - make the Sacrifice
No one there to catch you when you Fall
It's Shadow's and Sin - Enemies Within
You'll be fine, so cross the line and Damn it all

Slip into Shades of Nothing - yesterday's
promises die - More, taking more than I need to
bleed you dry

Cut your throat - Abandon all Hope 'blood-money
lusting' portrayal - Break the trust from dawn
to dusk bring down the curtains on you final
act of betrayal

Empty hands recoil... feel your Blood begin to boil
Tails and Fangs or Doom - violently consumed

It's Fire and Ice - make the Sacrifice
No one there to catch you when you Fall
It's Shadow's and Sin - Enemies Within
You'll be fine, so cross the line and Damn it all

Virtue or vice? Will you pay the price?
When there's no one to catch you when you fall
...so Damn you All...

Give me hot-blooded yearning - infect and pollute
all that's pure - more than my heart can endure
Vengeance and Fury - Screaming
and eye for an eye - lashing out in Anger
I curse the sky

Demon Song is sung - first your ear ... and then
your tongue - Wear this Mask of Fire - and burn
for all you're desired

It's Fire and Ice - make the Sacrifice
No one there to catch you when you Fall
It's Shadow's and Sin - Enemies Within
You'll be fine, so cross the line and Damn it all
