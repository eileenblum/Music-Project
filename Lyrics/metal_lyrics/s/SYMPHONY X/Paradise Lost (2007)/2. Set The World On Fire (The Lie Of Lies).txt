[Music: Romeo, Lyrics: Allen, Romeo]

God-like perfection
reflect in these eyes
reaching for my place - With stars on high

Damn the betrayers
Through twilight, I fall
Headlong flaming - I curse you all

There's no turning back
falling deep into the sweet collapsing black

[CHORUS:]
Fly with me - forever higher
And with these wings,
We'll Set the World on Fire
Fly with me - through scorching skies
You and I - The Lie of Lies

I'm the Master of Illusion
Minister of sin
Two - faced snake - wicked - shedding skin

I will forsake you
Destroy and unmake you
With all my might, I will take you down

There's no turning back
Falling deep into the sweet collapsing black

Fly with me - forever higher
And with these wings,
We'll Set the World on Fire
Fly with me - through scorching skies
You and I - The Lie of Lies

Don't leave me - you need me
only I know the way...

[CHORUS]
