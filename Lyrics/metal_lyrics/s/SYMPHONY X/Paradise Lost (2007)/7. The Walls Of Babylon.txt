Down the plains - come Hell Riders
blood of ice and hissing breath
Consumed by this lust - into battle
staring down the Eyes of Death

Skies of Red - Winged Thunder Breathing
Lightning Fire - Invaders - Light slayers
Cut down the fiends and betrayers
Dark destroyers - can't avoid or deny us

War Hammer of the Gods
Bring down the Walls of Babylon

Legions of Lies- beating down the Lamb
Wings of War, they pulverize
Wrath is my name - feel the Hatred
hurling defiance toward the skies

Skies of Red -  Winged Thunder Breathing
Lightning Fire - flesh churning - blood burning
the gears of War, ever turning with conviction
Malediction is King

War Hammer of the Gods
Bring down the Walls of Babylon

So here I stand -  beyond Apocalypse
God of Pain - in lethal stealth
Casualty of Pride - I will never be denied
A Lord of War... at war with Myself

Skies of Red -  Winged Thunder Breathing
Lightning Fire - earth shaking - bones breaking
the Hand of Fate dominating
one by one the Stars are Falling

War Hammer of the Gods
Bring down the Walls of Babylon
