Covenant of pure corruption
sink my teeth deep into you
Solemn oath of sheer destruction
Nightmare, through and through

In that hour - I'll devour
Hope is swallowed up in Pain
taste the venom - feel the power
coursing through my veins

I'm corruption
I'm destruction, through and through

Trust in me... for I will set you free
with a Serpent's Kiss
with a Serpent's Kiss

Be my lights and I won't stray - make me beg;
make me pray
Tell me when to laugh or cry - when to live
and when to die

Forgotten and betrayed
Rotting and decayed
left to wither - without a voice
left to slither - without a choice

[solo]

Crucifier - spitting fire
say your little empty prayers
This empire - growing higher
To this spite I swear

Sharp tongue severs - like a razor
swimming in a sea of rage
Vindicators - masqueraders
all the world's my stage

I devour
I empower - god of pain

Trust in me... for I will set you free
with a Serpent's Kiss
How could it come to this?
with a Serpent's Kiss
