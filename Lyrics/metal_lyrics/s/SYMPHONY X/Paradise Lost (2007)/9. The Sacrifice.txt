Your eyes, singing to me sweet lullabies
while you lay there in submission
Forbidden desire
alone in the moonlight hearts afire -
burn away our inhibitions

When the stars lose their fire
And night steals the morning away
Forever and a day
I will stay - I will stay here with you my love

Sacrifice, a heartbeat away from paradise
All my reason's giving way to temptation
Fear and Shame - looking for someone else to blame
We're devoured by these foolish accusation

With every fleeting breath I take
Maybe our love was a mistake
Eternal life - I'd trade it for
One moment beside you...

When the stars lose their fire
And night steals the morning away
Forever and a day

When the stars lose their fire
And night taked the morning away
Forever and a day
I will stay - I will stay here with you my love
