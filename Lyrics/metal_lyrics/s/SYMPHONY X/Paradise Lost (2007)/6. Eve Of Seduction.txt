It's alright - no need to question
Taste the night - just close your eyes
it just takes one bite

All you need's in my possession
Just believe - come take my hand, tonight and
trust your dreams

I'm falling all to pieces, slowly losing control

Can it be true?
Why can't you see - I'm Burning for You
There's no disguising my desires - what can I do?
All you will know - give me your heart
give me your soul
I'll tear it apart, so long as you'll never let me go.

On your ear - a whisper, fallen
Show no fear - go spread your wings and fly
shed no tears

Pleasure's pain - I hear it calling
feed the flame - within becoming kin with the
Sons of Cain

I'm falling all to pieces, slowly losing control

Can it be true?
Why can't you see - I'm Burning for You
There's no disguising my desires - what can I do?
All you will know - give me your heart
give me your soul
I'll tear it apart, so long as you'll never let me go.

Can it be true?
Why can't you see - I'm Burning for You
There's no disguising my desires - what can I do?
All you will know - give me your heart
give me your soul
I'll tear it apart, so long as you'll never let me go.
