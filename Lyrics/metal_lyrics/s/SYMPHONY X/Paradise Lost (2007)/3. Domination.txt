All along the waste and wild
legions of lost scream in pain
A million shattered destinies
all slowly drowning in tears of flame

Break the chains around your necks
lick your wounds you Dogs of War
Raise your banners ever high
and ravage the Babylon Whore

I, with darkest insurrection, victimize
Hail the horrors, all hail and sanctify
...my Domination

Rotting from the inside out
ripping away to the core
A million lies unite as one
slaughtering innocence for evermore

Sound the mighty drums of doom
march to this black heart of fate
Clawing, tearing, slashing deep
defiantly fighting our fate

I, with darkest insurrection, victimize
Hail the horrors, all hail and sanctify
...my Domination

Turn the waters red with rage
burn all the earth shore to shore
Open wide the Gates of Hell
defile the Babylon Whore

I, with darkest insurrection, victimize
Hail the horrors, all hail and sanctify
...my Domination
...my Domination
