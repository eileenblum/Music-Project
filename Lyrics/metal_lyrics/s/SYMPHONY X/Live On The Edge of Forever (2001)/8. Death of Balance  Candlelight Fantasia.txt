[Death of Balance:]

[Music: Michael Romeo, Jason Rullo]

[Instrumental:]

[Candlelight Fantasia:]

[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela]
[Lyrics: Thomas Miller]

Just one more night
One more score
Another question in my mind,
can't take no more

Kissing the tears form my face as they fall
To the ground in silence in twilight and faded time
Spirits cold, with no love
Bells ring the lonely chime
Candle fires
These lit dreams can't burn alone

Winds of change bring songs upon my memory
An empty heart and soul intoxicates me
This darkened page orchestrates my final destiny
Not knowing what, what tomorrow will bring

From within the mirrors eyes
I'm forced to run away and hide
I feel those mystic eyes subside
Through passages in time
I'm prisoned and locked behind the door
Lonely roses slowly wither and die
