[All Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller]

[Part I - At the Four Corners of the Earth]
[Lyrics: Romeo, Pinnela]

On the edge of paradise
Tears of woe fall, cold as ice
Hear my cry
Renounce, have you, thy name
Eternal is my pain

Eternal is the pain that leads me
to the thrones of temptation
Eternal is the pain that leads me
to the thrones of temptation ...

[Part II - In the Room of Thrones]

[Instrumental]

[Part III - A Gathering of Angels]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo]

There was a time ...
When nine choirs sang the
endless melody of light
Music of the spheres
There was a place ...
Where mortals embraced thunder
and majesty
Their fate lay in our hands
Feel my wings slowly fading -
forever lost in time - I cry

[Part IV - The Wrath Divine]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo, Thomas Miller]

The burning conflict I'm feeling
It summons me to descend into
the other side
And just beyond the stars blazing
A beam light from a red, velvet
moon illuminates me

I will devise, from perfect skies
A dark and vengeful day
Faith and mercy gone astray

With strength of infinite measure
The mighty sword divides order
from chaos in the kingdom below
And from the mansions of glory,
This empty soul cries out one
final plea ...
The end has begun

Our worlds collide, now in
disguise,
You'll feel the Wrath Divine
Tears of woe fall from the sky ...

[Part V - The Prophet's Cry]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo]

The prophet cries
Vast battalions rage on in the sky
Rising from the north
- the bringer of war
Eve of destruction
Summon all who have 'power
over fire'
Impending doom from shore to
shore

Standing on the edge of paradise
I sacrifice my truth and loyalty
Seven deadly sins consume you
all, a dance with death
I taste the victory

(Eternal is the pain that leads me to temptation)

Rising from the north
- the warrior prince
Judgement without compassion
eyes of fear
Like the river Styx,
the gates of hell -
"Abandon hope all ye who enter here"

The prophets cry
As armies fall from the edge of
the sky
The Prince of truth, now the
bringer of war

The day of wrath
Banish all kings from the face of the land
Dominion for strength is my
name

[Part VI - Bringer of the Apocalypse]

[Instrumental]

Eve of Sacrifice/Armies in the Sky/Dies trae

[Part VII - Paradise Regained]
[Lyrics: Russel Allen, Michael Pinnella]

Looking out on a blue sky
I can see a new world arising
Like a prisoner unbound
I feel the power and the majesty
again

Looking up to the heavens
I can see what I left behind
Beneath the stars, moon and
warm sun
And all I know,
is my paradise has begun ...
