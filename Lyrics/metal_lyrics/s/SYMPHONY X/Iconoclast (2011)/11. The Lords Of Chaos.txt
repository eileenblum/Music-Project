Forged in blood, carved in stone,
Right before your eyes, youâve always known
See the truth inside yourself, see the world like no one else
Oh, if only you were king, you could change everything.

Canât you see what theyâre doing to you and me?

We rule, we fly
Above the lights of the neon sky
We fight, we cry
The Lords of Chaos will never die

All you see must be destroyed
Your destiny you canât avoid
Show them all your demon sign
Tell them all to get in line
Thereâs no time to waste
Its poison but they canât taste it.

Donât you see what theyâre doing to you and me?

We rule, we fly
Above the lights of the neon sky
We fight and we cry
The Lords of Chaos will never die
Will never die.

The quick and the dead
Moving fast theyâre in your head
Infection spreads in the blood of the damned

The truth and the lies
Itâs all the same, itâs just a game
You see, day and night you hold them in your hands, ohâ¦

Oh, canât you see what theyâre doing to you and me?

We rule, we fly
Above the lights of the neon sky
We fight and we cry
The Lords of Chaos will never die

We rule, we fly
Above the lights of the neon sky, ohâ¦
We fight, we cry
The Lords of Chaos will never ever die
