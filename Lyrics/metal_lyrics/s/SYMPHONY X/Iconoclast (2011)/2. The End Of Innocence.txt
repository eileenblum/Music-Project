Bite your tongue
The blackened sun
Will curse the moon
Skies of fire
Nothing's worth a damn

Calculate
Anticipate
Your every move
Beware
The ruthless hearts of man

Feel my pain
My words are in vain
I believe it's the end of innocence
Don't look away
Oh, hear what I say
I believe it's the end of innocence

Cut and splice
a fierce device
Degenerate
Sons of light
Synthetic gods, our man

Crushed beneath
The dragon beast
Breathing hate
Your blood
Your blood is on their hands

Feel my pain
My words are in vain
I believe it's the end of innocence
Don't look away
Oh, hear what I say
I believe it's the end of innocence

The world is dying
The precious sands of time
Are running out

We are the fallen
Made obsolete
Methodically phased out
...Feel my pain

Feel my pain
My words are in vain
I believe it's the end of innocence
Don't look away
Oh, hear what I say
I believe it's the end of innocence
