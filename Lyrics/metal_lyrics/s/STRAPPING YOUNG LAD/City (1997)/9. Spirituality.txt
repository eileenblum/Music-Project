I'm right here where you left me experimenting
Bored out of my fucking mind...
Please, give me a sign, please, show me a sign
Please, show me that you're alive

Thereâs got to be
Another way
Another place for me
Please, help me, please...

You'll never be what you try to be if you want to be it
God help the king of nothing

It's getting late
I'm getting old
And every night I just sleep,
We never talk

And every night,
I look to the sky
And pray the god to hear me...

And if thatâs all there is
â¦if this is it
Won't... won't someone tell me

'Cause I'm so fucking sick of all you
Sick stupid people

Ooh-oh

Leave me alone

(...I finally found a way out of here...)
