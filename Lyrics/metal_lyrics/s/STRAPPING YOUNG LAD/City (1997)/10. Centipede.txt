[Japanese version bonus]

So what man?
So what?
It leaves me too low...
And it pushes me out
It leaves me behind

...all of my life
...all of my days

Your woman...
So what?
She leaves me in doubt
And pushes me down
It leaves me behind

...all of my life
...all of my days

All that I'm going through
Your legs when these would do
...know when it's over
This "no one" left no one behind
