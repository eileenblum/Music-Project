Play that stupid piece of shit!
Oah!

Aah!

Hey! Devo!

I've got a feeling
With the wrong people
And I can't control my thoughts

I wish that I could sleep
And just get this over with
This is only high school bullshit

I was warned
Absolutely numb
No good around people
Everyone knows and watches me

How did I get here tonight?
What am I doing here?
How did I reach this state?
How did I lose my sight?

I'm lost
I'm freaking
And everybody knows
Everyone's watching

So here's all my hopes and aspirations
Nothing but puke
God, I'm so lonely...

(The human brain
An unbelievable complex of nerve cells
That turns sound vibrations into pleasure
Meanwhile the passage of blood
One step at a time
Will continue to be?
Even after it has been removed from the body)

I feel so alone, alone
(Thought I'd tryâ¦
Thought I'd feelâ¦)

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Why do I gotta be such a stupid bastard?
Are you dump bugger?

I just want to feel

I was warned
Absolutely numb
No good around people
Everyone knows and watches me
