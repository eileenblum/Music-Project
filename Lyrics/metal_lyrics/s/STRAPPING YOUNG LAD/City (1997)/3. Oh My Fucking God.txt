[Spoken:]
Well, gentlemen, a great deal of money has been invested in this project and we can't allow it to fail
There are no difficult tasks, each action must simply be adapted to the challenge.

Demon
Dream of god

There is no insanity, rather a super sanity
More suited for life at the end of the 20th century
Where everything is art,
And everything is trying to express it,
Where everything is art,
And everything is trying to communicate it...

All intelligent beings sleep the dreaming of dreams
And they've all come up to meet me tonight
Although while in the morning, all their wonder and their
Glory was turned ugly and quite simple
Like a venue when you're loading in gear

This night
Is when it all changes

Sexuality, eroticism in asexual persuasions.
Man or woman, makes no difference in the outcome
No fashion, no tolerance for stupidity or ignorance
..."Adidas" or "The Arch Deluxe"...
And time is now an object

Oh, my fucking god...
Oh, I'm fucking god...

Oh, my fucking god...
Oh, I'm fucking god...
