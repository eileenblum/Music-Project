[Spoken:]
A geological event of cataclysmic dimensions

On and on, it's on and on
On and on, itâs on and on
No one knows why, no one knows why
A new time, new ways
New thought, new age

On and on, it's on and on
On and on, itâs on and on
Say goodbye! say goodbye! say goodbye! say goodbye!
No one knows why, no one on and on
A new time, new ways, new thought, new age

Tired of waiting
Tired of fighting
Tired of waiting for fucking nothing
Sick of lying
Sick of trying
Tired of waiting for fucking nothing

Tired of hating, bored of dying
Tired of waking from the dreams of morning

Sick of trying, sick of whining
Tired of waking from the dreams of morning

Tired of waiting
Tired of fighting
Tired of waiting for fucking nothing
Sick of lying
Sick of trying
Tired of waiting for fucking nothing

...underneath the waves...
They're underneath the waves...
Theyâre underneath the fucking waves...
They're underneath the waves...
