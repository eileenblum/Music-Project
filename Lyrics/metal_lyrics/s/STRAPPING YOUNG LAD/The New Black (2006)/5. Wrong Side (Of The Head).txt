Woke up screaming on the wrong side of the head
Dreaming of demon's who'd be better off... better off dead
Now I know I'm accountable for the things I've said before
But I just can't shut up, shut up, shut up, get up, get up, get up and get out the door

SO LET'S SING VOLUMES FOR THE SOULS THAT AREN'T FOR SALE
INDEED LATELY THERES BEEN HELL HOUNDS ON MY TRAIL

Woke up screaming on the wrong side of the Zen
So get up(x7) and say the words!
Say the word and I'll be gone
Say the Word and I'll be gone

Say the word and I'll be gone for ever, and ever...
(Get up, Get out)
Singing the good for the bad in the age of the fall
Now the enemy plays for the whole fucking world

[Solo 1 - Dev / Solo 2 - Jed]

Sooner or later the nights with the satyr
Will bring back the memory
Leaving you money and time

Sweet locomotive with you is the motive
the beauty, the agony mixes the honey with grime
Sly imitator, the cats in the cradle, the dogs in the stable will
Always remain on your mind

Sooner or later it comes to the table reminding them all
That the memory always was mine.
Wake up running in the only way I can
This type of dependency turns a boy into a man!

Now I know I'm accountable
Now I know I'm responsible
NO PEACE FOR YOU LITTLE MAN!
Say the word and I'll be gone
Say the word and I'll be GONE!!!

Say the word and I'll be gone for ever, and ever...
(Get up, get out)
Singing the good for the bad in the age of the fall
(Singing the good for the bad in the age of the fall)
Singing the good for the bad in the age of the fall
Now the enemy plays for the whole fucking world!!!!
