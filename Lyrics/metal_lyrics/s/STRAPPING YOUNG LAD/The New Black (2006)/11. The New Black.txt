Lord over creation
Hands across the nation
Woe to human kind
Woe to human kind

(STAND BACK) - You burn the medic
(THROWN BACK) - I'm broken
(STARE BACK) - Attack, attack, attack
(THE NEW BLACK!!!) - THE FACE OF CREATION

Woe to you mankind

And it can never be held in stasis
What on your mind?
WOE TO YOU MANKIND

(STAND BACK) - You taste the taste
(THROWN BACK) - I'm broken
(STARE BACK) - Attack, attack, attack
(THE NEW BLACK!!!) - THE NEW BLACK

SLEEPWALKING
Your lack of vision is the division
Theres no vision in your mind, back the FUCK OFF
In time... Same thing as... but off

With the vision in mind
Superficial is time
Inquisition the mind in the FACE OF CREATION

In morning they will come alone
And we arise as if a new day's dawned for everyone
But now we know... as much as we don't show...
OUR WORLD HAS BEEN BLACKEND
