Fuck you

Dance, you fuckers

[Bif Naked:]
We're all fired up and ready to go
To give it all up at the metal show
Don't play it up and don't play us some love
Just play this shit on the radio

Fucker
You fucker
Fucker
Get out of my face, get off my case
You're a fucker
You're all fuckers
And I don't fucking care

I've said it before, now I'll say it again
It was all too much for the Alien
So heavy metal, fuck it, rock
We're doing it for you, baby

Fucker
You fucker
Fucker
Get out of my face, get off my case
You're a fucker
You fucker
And I don't fucking care

Watch behind my eyes
Watch behind your face
Just understand it and see the little fucker

Like I give a fuck!

Fucker
You fucker
Fucker
Get out of my face, get off my case
You're a fucker
You're all fuckers
And I don't fucking care
