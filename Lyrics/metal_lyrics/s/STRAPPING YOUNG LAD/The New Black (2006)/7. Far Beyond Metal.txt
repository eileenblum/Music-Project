COME ON
King Raul beat off
Fucking strength
King Raul beat off
Fucking strength

Now that the music industry's ill
And we're the fucking antidote
One line and you're outta control
Yeah, you fucking suck!

HEY!
King Raul beat off
Fucking strength
King Raul beat off
Fucking strength

Oh, you ironic pop-rock fuck
Don't you fuck with METAL
One line and you're outta control
Yeah, we fucking OWN YOU!

King Raul beat off
Fucking strength
King Raul beat off
Fucking right

Can't wait to feel it again
And I need to feel, whoa
When I was somebody else
When I was just a boy

METAL!
(come on)

[Solo / harmonized lead]

[Dev:]
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE MAGGOT MASTER!

[Oderus:]
Now in the halls of the necro lord
Flash of fear when he sees my sword
Raped his woman, smoked his bone
Leave a booger underneath his throne!

King Raul beat off
Fucking wank
King Raul beat off
Fucking...
FUCKING WANK!

So... I...

Can't wait to feel it again
And I need to feel, whoa
When I was somebody else
When I was just a boy

METAL!
