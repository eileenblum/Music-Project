Penetrate and desecrate my soul
Penetrate and decimate them all

God, have you always be listening to me
Hell has a way with the pros
Give me the strength
Give me the strength now to know

Penetrate and demonstrate your guiding
Every word and every note and everything at all

God hasn't always been listening to me
Hell has a way with the pros
Give me the strength
Give me the strength now to choose

It's in your nature to fear
Fearing the cracks in the earth

SYL!
SYL!
SYL!
SYL!

Yes, it's in your nature to fear
Fearing the cracks in the earth
Oh God, it's human nature
Fearing the cracks in the earth
