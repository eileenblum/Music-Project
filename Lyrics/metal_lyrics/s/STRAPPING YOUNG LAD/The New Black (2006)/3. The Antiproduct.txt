I am the Antiproduct
Rotten to the core
Sell me the Antiproduct
Rock me to the core

Sell me, tell me
I'm the only one
I am the Antiproduct
Rock me to the bone

I am the Antiproduct
Quantum-mechanically pure
So you will show me, be automatic
We must be perfectly sure

Sell me, tell me
I'm the chosen one
I am the Antiproduct
Rock me to the bone

For sale!

I am the Antiproduct
Rotten to the core
Sell me the Antiproduct
Rock me to the bone

I am the Antiproduct
I am the Antiproduct
We are the Antiproduct
We are the Anti--

Anti-god-damn!
