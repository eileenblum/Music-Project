Because we love you
We return to rock you

Become to
Because you
We want you

Workers are going home
Workers are going home

Once you've been alone
And everybody knows
Work begins alone

Workers are doing time
For you, there's nothing now but time

Once you cross the line
And everything is fine
Work starts in the line

What do we want?
Hate!
Do you want to know why?
Because we love you
We return to rock you

What's the matter, little man?
Uncomfortably you believe (we want you)
What's the matter, little man?
We warned you

So you have mercy
You know why now

Become to
Because you
We want you
We want you

Become so
Be controlled
We want you
We want you
