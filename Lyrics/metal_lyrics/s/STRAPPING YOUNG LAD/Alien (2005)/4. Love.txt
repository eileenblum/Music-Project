(Fuck it!)

(There's no external way to tell when a woman is ready to recieve)

MARCH!!!

LOVE... is a way of feeling
LOVE is a way of feeling less alone
So what's all the fuss about?!?

"FUCK IT"

LOVE: the paradox of needing
OH LOVE,
MAKE WAY FOR BREEDING

GIVE IT TO ME! GIVE IT TO ME!
FUCK YOU AND YOUR TALK OF LOVE!
I know what I stand for; I STAND FOR ME!!!

I'll wait for the night to come
So far, suicide at home
For I'm not the man you know
This love it's about control

OH WHAT A FEELING!!!!!
OH WHAT A FEEDING!!!!!
Know the chosen ones ARE HERE!
ALL HAIL!!! ...SHIT

(FUCK IT!)
I'll wait for the night to come
So far, suicide at home
For I'm not the man you know...
This love, IS ABOUT CONTROL

YOU FUCKERS!

ALL IN THE NAME OF LOVE
ALL IN THE NAME OF LOVE
ALL IN THE NAME OF LOVE
