I wonder why
Need you to try
And on the way,
...reeling...
...feeling...
BURN!

I've seen your shine
It seems divine!
But by the way...
...you're clouded...
I'M CLOUDED???

AAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!

Don't tell me SHIT!
Don't you tell ME fucking SHIT!

BORING, YOU'RE BORING BORING YOU'RE
BORING, YOU'RE BORING, YOU'RE BORING,
YOU'RE BORING, YOU'RE BORING ME INTO MYSELF!

SHINE ON, SHINE ON, SHINE ON...

I wonder why
Need you to try
But by the way
YOU'RE CLOUDED...
WE'RE ALL CLOUDED BOY!!!
