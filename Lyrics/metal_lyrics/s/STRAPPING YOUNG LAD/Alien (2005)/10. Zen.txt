Oh, did you think that I was KIDDING???
Oh, DID YOU THINK THAT I WAS???
Oh, too late, too late...
Aw, TOO LATE MOTHERFUCKER!!!

MUST REMEMBER TO KEEP BOTH FEET ON THE GROUND
EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE IS TURNING ROUND

Then... we're the only ones
We're GODS, not demons

ZEN
ZEN
Zen...on the way I'm feeling
Zen...on the way we're feeling

On we go...we're waiting now...

Are you looking at me?!?
...Why do you keep looking at me?!?
...am I not merciful?

YES!!! we're the only ones
We're GODS AND DEMONS

ZEN

Zen...on the way I'm feeling
Zen...on the way we're feeling
Zen...on the way I'm feeling
Zen...on the way we're feeling
