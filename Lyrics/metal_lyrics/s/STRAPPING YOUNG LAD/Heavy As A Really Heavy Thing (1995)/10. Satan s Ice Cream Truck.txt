C'mon little kiddies
Have I got a treat for you.
At first it tastes all yummy,
Then you start to turn blue

[chorus:]
I'll be back again next week.
Bring your friends, we'll have an ice cream treat
Mom don't like it, but he don't give a fuck
Kids come running for satan's ice cream truck

Come on, and ask you mommy
Your pennies are in hand
If you need more than your tummy,
You can get inside my van

[repeat chorus]
