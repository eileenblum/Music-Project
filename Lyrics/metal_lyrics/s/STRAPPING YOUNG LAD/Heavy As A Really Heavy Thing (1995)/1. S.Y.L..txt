[Spoken intro by 3-years-old Devin Townsend:]
"This is a play Devy - spelled Devy. I like me who wants to play, play to Devy? And then once there was a bear out there... a real live bear... and he... ate the kids.â

I am the coming of a new age
Past your shit by far
I was a puzzle in your sick life,
But will never be a piece anymore.
Because I worked through your fucking bullshit
And I worked through your fucking lies
Now I'm working on the edge

With a thousand times the stress,
So I can damn you down to size.

Hey!

I worked in your fucking warehouse

I worked in your fucking dream
I worked on the edge of the product community
and found that nothing's what it seemed.
I fucking hate you [7x]
I fucking hateâ¦

Devy worked in the corner of the piss yard
Bored and plagued by pain,
Devy got a taste of the corporate community,
And never went back again.

Hey!

I worked for you fucking bastards
I worked for your fucking lies
I went and pissed away too may fucking opportunities
To try and make you fuckers feel right
and I fucking hate you... I fucking hate you [6x]
I fucking hateâ¦

[Chorus:]
I am the coming of a new age
Stained we still stand tall
I am the coming of a new age
And I will never fall
I bear the questions of a new time
Seen but never heard
I've seen the comings of a new time, get ready...
âCause here it comes.

pushing your incompetence,
And racial views aside
And never now,
Until death again, is there anywhere to... hide

It starts here my friends,
My brothers and sisters,
The courage to show what is brave, and not to be weakened
To stand it through, by any length

To look into the eyes,
And have the strength of men who say "fuck you"
I won't do what you tell me... "fuck you"
I don't care who you are... "fuck you"
I'll never stop believing... "fuck you"
And I'll never be the one who takes the heat in the name

Of the remorse that isn't pushed into a hole
Waiting now, and packing down
Into the open spaces we must go and not be frightened
As children we came,
As children we go,
So never look behind you, never look behind... "fuck you"
it isn't a decision... "fuck you"
it's a sign of greater things... "fuck you"
and a loss will never matter... "fuck you"

[Chorus:]
I am the coming of a new age
stained we still stand tall
I am the coming of a new age
and I will never fall
I bear the questions of a new time
seen but never heard
I've seen the comings of a new time, get ready...
âCause here it fucking comes.

Strapping Young Lad
Cheesy metalhead
Go

âHowdy, welcome to A&amp;W. My name's Devin. Can I take your stinkin' order?â
