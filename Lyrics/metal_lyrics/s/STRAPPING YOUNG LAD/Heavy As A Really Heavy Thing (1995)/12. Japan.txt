[Bonus track]

Time waits for no one
No holy saviour came again
It's here now, my old friend
And it's time to go home...
Back to the stars
Now I know how it sounds
But I know how I feel
And this boredom kicks into the aligned
The invisible and the divine
And the lights upon the hill at night
They have followed me young
And into tomorrow No time for you
Time alone
This time I think I've found it
Goodbye my love
It came for me
I'm going back to Japan
