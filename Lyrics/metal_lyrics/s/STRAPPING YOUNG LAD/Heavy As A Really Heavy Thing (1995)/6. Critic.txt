All is calm, and all is right

You took the call, you took the fight
I'm finished here, I'm on to the next
This time, this time, this time, this time, you call
All you are, is all you are

All is cold, and all is dead
It's time, it's time, I need, I need you

Mora

Help me end my nights in here
And help me get this water clear
All is calm and all is lost
You call, you call, you call, you call me

Mora

Critic... you're the critic... you're the critic

In the night I lay awake

I know it's cheating baby,
But I know I have a right
And in the dawn I see the question
A bleeding wrong forcing right

Sometimes night I can't stop thinking
And I'm calling it a soul strike
