Drive,
He's trying,
To tempt me, take me, down me, rape me, fuck her...
Fuck yourself, you'll never take me live,

Goddamn this sun,

Go, he's not the one

Take this away... july, july, july
Bring me rain.

Drive,
Keep calm,
These are only just illusions
And whatever has been said
It has now gone completely wrong
But keep your head, don't freak...
Keep your eyes upon the road,
And just don't think about that room... oh holy fuck
Oh holy fuck, oh holy fuck

Goddamn this heat
Christ, goddamn this shit

Take this away... july, july, july
Bring me rain

He said "I know that you know that I am the one"
"you know that I've found a way..."
Don't die on me, don't leave me alone!!!
Give me this chance and I'll make it the last,
I will never succumb
I will never succumb.
