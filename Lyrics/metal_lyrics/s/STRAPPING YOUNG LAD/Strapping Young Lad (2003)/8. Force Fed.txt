Animal, you're an animal...
You're a goddamn fucking animal
It sucks you in... pulls you in
No one knows

One never breaks if you never bend
Don't ever try, don't ever win

Animal, you're an animal... you're a goddamn fucking animal
Face your fears: you gotta face your fears
You gotta ride...

We're young
We'll find a way to love again
And we'll find a way...
Find a way to the world
And we'll find a way...
Force Fed to the world

No shades of grey... just seas of red
To bathe in what makes you whole
What makes you whole?
