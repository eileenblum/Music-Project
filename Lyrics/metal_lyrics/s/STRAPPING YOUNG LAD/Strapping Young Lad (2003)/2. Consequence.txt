Human Mind, Human Soul...
Human Weakness
I love you... I love you...
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

No... no one
No pride at all

I see devastation and I'm ready to BURN!
My skin is infected

Quiet now, Quiet now... Quiet Human
I love you... I love you...
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

No... no one
No pride at all

You Fail
I am Temptation... your Saviour
Now your Soul dies...

You won't survive
Nothing will ever survive...
Filling the void with nothingness

All rise... Satan steals you away
Hate Springs eternal
I see devastation and I'm ready to BURN!

My skin is infected
And I never...
Never...
There's no release
