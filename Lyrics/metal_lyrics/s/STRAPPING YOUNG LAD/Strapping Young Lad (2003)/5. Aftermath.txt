Give us a reason for coming of war
Fighting for Jesus through prices of oil
See how your demons are forming a wall
Burning and beating and raping them all

Reaching for something
When nothing else matters
Buddha to Krishna through Jesus and Allah
See how your demons are forming a wall
Burning and beating and raping them all

Far from here... we'll light away
So unclear... we'll find the way
To war... we ride
