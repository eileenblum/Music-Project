Praing yourself,
Do you know what you're doing?
Point blank when you hear what I say
No way you can wash away nature...
Do you know what you're doing...
Do you know what to say?

Dripping... Seeping
Dripping... Leaking
Dripping... Cabbages

Grazing away
Do you know what you're feeling?
You fool... do you know where you lay?
I'm gone, there's no answer... it's over
Do you know what I'm saying...
Do you know what I'm saying?

Dripping... Gigbutt
Dirt Pride... My pride
Dripping... Bunksock

Bathe... Bathe...
Commiserate...Commiserate...

I'm not about helping hopeless
Bored when I wash them away...
Internal a body at war with itself
And the bleeding I do... it's for me

Dripping... Seeping
Dripping... Leaking
Dripping... Cabbages

Bathe... Bathe...
Commiserate... Commiserate

Praising yourself
Do you know what you're doing?
Point blank when you hear what I say
No color, no code, no creed... WAR

Wash my fucking balls
