Don't need to speak up to make myself clear
Don't wear a face of some phony looking real
I've got commitment no loose cash won't buy
All of my actions are here to testify

Fuel now the engines and see
The embers glowing inside
I'd burn up myself just to be
Rust on the chrome surfaced lie

Your confidence is erected like walls
Of concrete selfishness as a momentary pose
Peel off the skin and it's easy to see
Who's in command of this weird machinery

Live ammunition is piled up inside
My mind is loaded with reasons locked in ice
Can't find a way just to crack it in two
This tainted globe I inherited from you
