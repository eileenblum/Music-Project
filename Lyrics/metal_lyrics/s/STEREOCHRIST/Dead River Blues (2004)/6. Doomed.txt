Frail images of my dissolving life
Seem to finally fit now into a great new disguise

How many days to pass me by
To find my way and come around
To let it out to let it out
And have it all outside

Lord send me relief
These feet just wanna rest now
To gather a little faith
You gotta find some peace of mind

Don't wanna end up crying like fools
If you can't open it up you're doomed

All alone is the self behind the mask that it wears
You gotta feed him with the seeds of pride he wouldn't eat so polite
