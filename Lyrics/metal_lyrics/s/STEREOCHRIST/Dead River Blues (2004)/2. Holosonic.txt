Envisioned myself this way
A face into the light
My deserted eyes seem so deranged
Empty blue as the sky

Here I am a loaded gun
Can't seem to take no aim
Throwing all my empty shells away

Angst-ridden and weak within
And cold shivers down my spine
Swallowed my pills to tune me into a loose Frontin ride

White noise is all I hear
Floating around all
Over the air I breathe
Almost made me drown
The images I can't see
Are a gallery that won't
Ever be the same
As it used to live inside

Envisioned myself this way
A face burnt by the sun
My weary eyes would tell you tales
Of never healing scars
