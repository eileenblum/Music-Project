Railroad through my head
Trains a roll just passing by
And time to time they just let the steam out
So the brain never comes around

This feeling's old
Like a pile of stone
These wounds I hide so deep inside

Yeah I got a 4-track mind
Trains of thoughts just come and go
And time to time they just get me thinking
Why do I feel so alone

All along the river flowing dead
Shepherding my ghost into this illusion I am trapped in
And you don't know just what it feels to live like that
Befriended by the sour inhibitions
And even more depressed

Waves roll down this world
We're just wreckage left behind
Surviving like those paper boats on
This water raging wild
