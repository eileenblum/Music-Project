You are so worn out you just feel
No, no you'll never be free from this spell
Seeing yourself so disgusted
And falling deep in despair

Said you can't see the light
With face to the ground
Just kept on fooling yourself
All your life

So now you're caught in the headlights
They're burning like eyes in the cold
But the shade of your hard times
Is cast on all you behold

Cos that is the way
You used to get things done
In the shade of the moon noone
Can see you smack the sun

Is there something you're hiding?
It ain't gonna right all your wrongs
Or just the beauty inside this
Pose incites you the most
