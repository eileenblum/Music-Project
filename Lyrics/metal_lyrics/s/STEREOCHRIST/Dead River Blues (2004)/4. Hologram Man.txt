Born and raised in velvet years under a shiny glass sky
Blessed for all the times to be kept in safe delight

And the sun always rose for tomorrow
Saving your dull days from dying down

It's a hell of a life to live
Blurry visions ruin the eye
In this hologram all I see
Is fading now

Void is filling up your days still you believe it's all right
Satisfied in your castrated way and never a moment of doubt

It's a hell of a life to live
Blurry visions ruin the eye
In this hologram all I see is fading now

Trapped in this pixel cage
Balanced and safe from harm
Getting high on this your sweet soma to keep you numb
