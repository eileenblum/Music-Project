On my way down ain't noone there to share my pain
Am I falling into the same ole trap again

Always obeyed to the very call that incites my soul
So I must follow another path to lead me right back home

I'm on my way back home
Swimming right back through the haze
I'm on my way back ooh
You'll never know how it feels

A million times now I've seen the devil inside me so clear
Yet I can't kill it only send it to a hollow sleep

It's the way back home
That I tripped so many times
"And I've been carrying my load
Down the long winding road"
