When built, the damage done
The all-absorbing eye
With ball and chain
Against the grain
Where lost tomorrows die

Feeding storm
Yet the walls still stand
Changing form
King of nothing on a throne of sand

Cannot break out of this maze
Said to leave a deep trace - once designed
What has been fought since day one
In a war never won - now defined

[Lead: Gardberg]

This deadweight of the soul
A state of siege upheld
The worlds i weave
Of make-believe
In waking dreams expelled
The more the truth distorts
The less the mond is a blur
Thought correction
Resurrection
Patching up the future

Feeding storm
Yet the walls still stand
Changing form
King of nothing on a throne of sand

Cannot break out of this maze
Said to leave a deep trace - once designed
What has been fought since day one
In a war never won - now defined

Void of anguish
Nourished by isolation and self deception
Subconsciously i must have felt as awe and dread increased
My nightmares will soon all be so vivid and visible
The punishment came to strike

As the roots come undone
Bit by bit, one by one
Ripping out any chance of control
Life is caught in a haze
Preying on rainy days
Giving rise to a shell of a soul

Watch fate take wing!

As the roots come undone
Bit by bit, one by one
Ripping out any chance of control
Life is caught in a haze
Preying on rainy days
Giving rise to a shell of a soul

What thrives in hiding
And on fear
Is making itself known
Like doubt in the clear
A shared illusion
Shown and destroyed
The error perfecting the void
