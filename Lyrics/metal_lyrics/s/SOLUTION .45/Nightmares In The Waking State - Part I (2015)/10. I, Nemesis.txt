Changes come as seasons go
Camouflage will hide no such scar as mine
Anger and fear versus emptiness
This strange vendetta tears at the heart of my soul

You cannot save me
Nobody can

A firm refusal to die
But barely holding on
To whatever that is near
Obsessions and madness
Come as unforeseen saviors

So run from me, just run
Cause no matter what I may want
I am sill going to hurt
Do not try to change this
I stopped so many years ago
I humbly accept and remain
Almost begun liking my stay

You cannot save me
Nobody can

And when you have been here
For as long as I have been
You will slowly turn, becoming part of hell itself

[Lead: StefanoviÄ]

You should be full of fear
To really have to live by your words
In an ever ongoing everyday war
Not chosen nor played by any set of rules
Your appeasement and naivety
Is an insult, it nauseates me
One day in my prison
Your will to live would perish quickly
We are not the same
I have become something else
So vastly different
Oceans and depths
Filled with only hurt
From here to there
No equal do stand by me

[Lead: StefanoviÄ]

I, nemesis

My hell
My heaven
Your nightmare
My world

And when you have been here
For as long as I have been
You will slowly turn, becoming part of hell itself
