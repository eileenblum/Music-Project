Ever - ever and again
Calling in, striking blind
Setting up a claim for the throne supreme
Always - always at a stop
Constant sameness, well in hand
Crossing paths no matter how far apart

I know holding the line against myself
Will just brace what cannot be cast out
As though bridging the void in which I dwell

Under - under various forms
Keeping off, bending rules
Grinding down the sun once risen in vain
Order - order of the stray
Reckless yearning, punished will
Entering a state unknown to the mind

I know holding the line against myself
Will just brace what cannot be cast out
As though bridging the void in which I dwell

With the seasons we change as one, body and soul
The shadow of my shadow
The abyss that makes me whole
