Cannot clear this hideaway
Building walls inside
All I see is what now lies before me
Set aside the cutting edge
Navigate the clouds
Ride the non-existent of its cobwebs

I know this trail only too well
Leading astray my control
The time has come to break the spell
Once and for all

Jaded patterns of the mind
Making terms with fate
In the watches of the night I am set free
On the hunt for exit roads
Ways of shedding skin
Something that will give the key another turn

I know this trail only too well
Leading astray my control
The time has come to break the spell
Once and for all

At the far end of despair
Where the sun departs
The bare bones of reality
Reformed in dreamlike states
Altered source
The sticking point
Materialized in the flesh
A new form of hell
Bleeding heavens dry

I know this trail only too well
Leading astray my control
The time has come to break the spell
Once and for all
