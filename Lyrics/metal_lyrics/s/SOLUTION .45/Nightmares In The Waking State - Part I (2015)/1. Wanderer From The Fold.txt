Like an empty hourglass
Time has come to a halt
Where the overthrown is now rebuilding
Shifting to a sight unseen
Set against the obscure
In this breeding ground of doubt and yielding

Fear without a stop
Without restraint
As the world goes I must keep my head
Clear out of the way
Out of this hold
Latching on to all I used to shed

[Lead: Gardberg]

When the wolf is at the door
On the hunt fo a change
Unreality becomes existence
Cannot burn this frostbite off
Everliving ordeal
Always close at heart, yet in the distance

I am the wanderer from the fold
Through aimless days I drift alone
But never on my own
What is part of me
Is also part of you
Sleeping in the nameless depths
Waiting to come to the throne

Fear without a stop
Without restraint
As the world goes I must keep my head
Clear out of the way
Out of this hold
Latching on to all I used to shed

I am the wanderer from the fold
Through aimless days I drift alone
But never on my own
What is part of me
Is also part of you
Sleeping in the nameless depths
Waiting to come to the throne

The day of death never came
No funeral, no dark exit
The nights of murder and breathing shadows
I watched the sun rise
