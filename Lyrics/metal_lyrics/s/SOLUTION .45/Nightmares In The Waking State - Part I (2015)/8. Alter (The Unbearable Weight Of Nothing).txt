Laid out smokescreens
Blaze the trail
Fear triumphant
As I fail

The dream incinerator
A black hole on the rise
The darkness generator
Casting its shadow

Alter, set to ride the wings of the unknown
Alter, old tomorrows now adjusting
Alter, an agenda carving change in stone
Alter, the unbearable weight of nothing

Range of vision
Narrowed down
Lucid breathing
As I drown

The dream incinerator
A black hole on the rise
The darkness generator
Casting its shadow

Alter, set to ride the wings of the unknown
Alter, old tomorrows now adjusting
Alter, an agenda carving change in stone
Alter, the unbearable weight of nothing

[Lead: Gardberg]

The cold shield broken through
Transparent passage
The onset of a storm
Gathered in the ashes
Across the sands of time
Beyond the frontier
Where voids form the patterns
You will find my sphere

Alter!
