Welcome into my maze
A labyrinth of concern
Once clear and easy to grasp
Now point of no return

Gateways, backwards though time
Curtains falling on every morning's sun

In spite of myself
I am bleeding ascendancy dry
Restructuring shells
Where my vision will not turn a blind eye

Welcome into my maze
A labyrinth of concern
Once clear and easy to grasp
Now point of no return

No tomorrows grace will end this - what is known as the dark night of the soul

In spite of myself
I am bleeding ascendancy dry
Restructuring shells
Where my vision will not turn a blind eye
This newborn despair
Cannot take away my bearing wall
Yet in disrepair
As I am winning where losing is all

This journey will be long, I know
Though it appears to take me nowhere
It has me retained
It might have no end, no salvation
All I can do is dream
And at the same time curse all hope
