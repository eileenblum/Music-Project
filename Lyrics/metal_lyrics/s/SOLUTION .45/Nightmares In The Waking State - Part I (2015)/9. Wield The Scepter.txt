The blaze of a dying sun, lighting up the skies
An extinction watched from behind a two-way mirror
Broken source of energy rebuilt
Piercing through the multiple shields

I cannot see, nor can I hear
Senses blocked, as I am trying to get back
If I set free the change I fear
Will I be thrown off the track?
On the razor's edge of fate, wielding the scepter

The beast does not change and the beast is hungry
A scent beyond the compass of the human mind
Here where the limits are indefinite
And reason is on a hiding to nothing

I cannot see, nor can I hear
Senses blocked, as I am trying to get back
If I set free the change I fear
Will I be thrown off the track?
On the razor's edge of fate, wielding the scepter

[Lead: RandÃ©n]

Tried to turn away from the truth denied
When the enemy is your will deified
Torn inside all through

[Lead: StefanoviÄ]

Phasing out of loss, constraint and despair
Like a closing wound, yet beyond repair
This tide is running strong
Phasing out the chapter
The now is where you belong
Awaiting ever so long
This tide is running strong

I cannot see, nor can I hear
Senses blocked, as I am trying to get back
If I set free the change I fear
Will I be thrown off the track?
On the razor's edge of fate, wielding the scepter
