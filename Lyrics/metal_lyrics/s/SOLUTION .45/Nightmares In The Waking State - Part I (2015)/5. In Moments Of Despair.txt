At the heart of innocence
Outlooks torn and shadows trenched
Found a shelter from the wind once blowing hard
Fearsome stories laying claim of a beast no man can tame
The remains of shattered hopes and visions scarred

Yet another thorned embrace
As if all falls into place
On an ever-changing path to the unseen
Where defiace comes to feed
Captured struggle shall be freed
A new nightmare born with every waking dream

Day in and day out
Always at my side
By reason of doubt
Cannot bridge this great divide
Way in and way out
Crossing swords with pride
The odds you now shout
From the deadlocked halls inside

When the tide is on the turn
And the ropes around you burn
Cutting out the deadwood of the sightless host
Under mind-expanding skies
Failed conceptions cleanse the eyes
It is in moments of despair we live the most

Day in and day out
Always at my side
By reason of doubt
Cannot bridge this great divide
Way in and way out
Crossing swords with pride
The odds you now shout
From the deadlocked halls inside
