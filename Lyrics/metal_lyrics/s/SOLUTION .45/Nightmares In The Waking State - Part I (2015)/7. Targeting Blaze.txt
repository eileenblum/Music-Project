Targeting blaze
Like a mass of fire
Climbing higher
Targeting blaze
Never to retire
Poisoning desire

See the shift in cold print
Born in the blink of an eye
Will I ever be the same?

Targeting blaze
Always near in hiding
Endless, biding
Targeting blaze
Till no longer guiding
What is now colliding

See the shift in cold print
Born in the blink of an eye
Will I ever be the same?
Laid siege to all at once
Torn in the blink of an eye
Time to play the waiting game

Inside I have known
The source of my fears
Even so it's all
Beyond my control

See the shift in cold print
Born in the blink of an eye
Will I ever be the same?
Laid siege to all at once
Torn in the blink of an eye
Time to play the waiting game
