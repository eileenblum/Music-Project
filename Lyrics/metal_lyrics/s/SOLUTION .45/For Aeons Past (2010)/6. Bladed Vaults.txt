[Music by Stefanovic/Alvestam, Lyrics by Stanne]

Never again to be the fool
Now I know that all
Is going away
Wait and daylight is done
We are terminal

Will the time of my life
Be one out of time
So seal me off from time
Our final night
Within vaults
That I have been dreaming of
Forever where life is denied

Never again am I to blame
Barred from prying eyes
And coming dismay
Wait and my time is gone
In back of the blades.

Will the time of my life
Be one out of time
So seal me off from time
Our final night
Within vaults
That I have been dreaming of
Forever where life is denied

I cannot even falter
In the safety of
What this shallow life
Has forced me into

I chose confinement
Inside the bladed vaults
The day will not come
When our punishment is over
I am taken part
Torn asunder

Will the time of my life
Be one out of time
So seal me off from time
Our final night
Within vaults
That I have been dreaming of
Forever where life is denied

Will the time of my life
Be one out of time
So seal me off from time
Our final night
Within vaults
That I have been dreaming of
Forever where life is denied
