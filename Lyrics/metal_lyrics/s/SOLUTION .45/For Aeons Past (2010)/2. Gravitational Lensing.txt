[Music by Stefanovic/Alvestam, Lyrics by Stanne]

Into what goes on forever
Beyond perspectives lost
Kaleidoscope vision
Introspective display
What hides in plain sight

Force it into my head
Now is the only time
Hiding behind a lie
All I know

I cast the fire

[Chorus:]
Inside these hours
All alone
For I am in denial
Though never again will I
Direct my shields
Against another
But turn it on myself

Come back
To something I need
Come back to misery
Living the misdirection
All I know
The further off center
My lies become

Force it into my head
Now is the only time
Hiding behind a lie
All I know

I cast the fire

[Chorus]

No sight - unseen
No light - in between
Gravitational lensing
What they see
Is bent around my lies

Around this black hole
I have found myself again
Brought out the answers
For my seeing eyes only
Travelling in circles
I have found myself again
No way to face it straight
Inside the lonely

Here in the night of nights
Where nothing shines
I brought the flame down
On it all - unforgiving
In time the flame will die
The only hope I have to find
To never deny, never regret
The masquerade is over

As long as I cast the fire

[Chorus]
