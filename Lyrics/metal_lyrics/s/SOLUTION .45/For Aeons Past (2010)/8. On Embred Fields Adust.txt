[Music by Stefanovic/Alvestam, Lyrics by Stanne]

I am the one
That hides in flame and fire
Who takes you under
And brings you in

When the silence is all
No day before night
The burning plains
Are my light and my home

Striking down
The unfortunate ones
Black days forever
Leaving behind
Everything in sight
Cannot take me

What no man has seen
Awaits me far down below
On embred fields
Embred fields adust
Now I know what time is life
Forevermore gone
Is this the end?

When the silence is all
No day before night
The burning plains
Are my light and my home
They say never again
Decision is mine
No longer hiding
In darkness alone

Force it to stand
Unending down
Black days forever
Now upon me to
Turn the tide

What no man has seen
Awaits me far down below
On embred fields
Embred fields adust
Now I know what time is life
Forevermore gone
Is this the end?

What no man has seen
Awaits me far down below
On embred fields
Embred fields adust
Now I know what time is life
Forevermore gone
Is this the end?
