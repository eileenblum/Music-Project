[Music by Stefanovic/Alvestam, Lyrics by Stanne]

One night
I found what was missing
The thread that attaches
Us all together
Without us knowing
Our nexus
By this we stand parted
We challenge
What we do not know
These mindless masses
Will now take us
For a journey

Nowhere fast to the end
Let nothing lasting remain
Ripping the wires,
From failing structures
And build my self again

One night
I found what was missing
The thread that attaches
Us all together
Without us knowing
Our nexus

[Chorus:]
I have never been
Alive like this
The strings attached
I will make my own
I have never been
Alive like this
Behold my legacy
I have built a wirethrone
My wirethrone

My wirethrone

One too many times
I have failed to answer
To your questions why

Here on my throne of scorn
Concealed walls cannot hide
I have torn out,
All that supports me
To never be whole again

The more I am straining,
The less I attain
What has been built,
All in vain
The more I am gaining,
The less I sustain
Another wellspring to drain

[Chorus]

My wirethrone

The more I am straining,
The less I attain
What has been built,
All in vain
The more I am gaining,
The less I sustain
Another wellspring to drain

[Chorus x2]
