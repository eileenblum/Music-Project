[Music by Stefanovic/Alvestam, Lyrics by Stanne]

Left to devices
All of my own innovation
To the screaming end
Of what has always been
Whenever the dying is calling
I will go
To last reasons jagged edge

Now I know for what I am
Is wrong again

Out by the ledge
Out of reach
Further now to
A close beyond

Why are we trying to live
When all we know
Is just how to die

Left to abide defeat
In the long gone past
Not knowing this might be
What will tip the scales
Still nothing will fail me
As I am going through
The line simply
Must be crossed

Now I know for what I am
Is wrong again

I hear the dark
Smell the fear
Nil at hand
But a close beyond

I never brought anybody
To where our faith is gone
I am the last unrepentence
Bringing down the hail
Of storm and fire
Now for once I am on my own
Must make a final decision
Against this driving force
Or else I will find it
All in vain
I never asked to be challenged
The pain I bear is mine
And mine alone

Now I know for what I am
Is wrong again

Why are we trying to live
When all we know
Is just how to die

Why are we trying to live
When all we know
Is just how to die
