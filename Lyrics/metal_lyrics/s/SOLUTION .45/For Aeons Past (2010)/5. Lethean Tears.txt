[Music and Lyrics by Alvestam]

As time goes by
All eventually
Comes full circle
Just turning end for end
Where benightedness
Tip the scales
And once the fire
Has been lit
The mind's eye closes anew
Through endless ages
Ever lapsing into old ways

A denied tomorrow
Calling on yesterday
Headway in reverse
Only shadows reach
The light of day

Another sun
Now sets within
On the torn apart
Not to be found
Again therein
Bleeding dry the heart
Once more a dawn
Now wearing thin
Broken work of art
A can of worm
Incisive burns
Of the dark

Whatever comes now
Nothing but a
Reflection bygone
Restored continuum
And the tide
is on the turn

A denied tomorrow
Calling on yesterday
Headway in reverse
Only shadows reach
The light of day

Another sun
Now sets within
On the torn apart
Not to be found
Again therein
Bleeding dry the heart
Once more a dawn
Now wearing thin
Broken work of art
A can of worm
Incisive burns
Of the dark

Ruins
Laid in without cause
Sourceless call
For silence
Self-supporting fear
unaware abidance
Firm like ropes of sand
Past that go for nothing
Come leathen tears

Another sun
Now sets within
On the torn apart
Not to be found
Again therein
Bleeding dry the heart
Once more a dawn
Now wearing thin
Broken work of art
A can of worm
Incisive burns
Of the dark

Another sun
Now sets within
On the torn apart
Not to be found
Again therein
Bleeding dry the heart
Once more a dawn
Now wearing thin
Broken work of art
A can of worm
Incisive burns
Of the dark
