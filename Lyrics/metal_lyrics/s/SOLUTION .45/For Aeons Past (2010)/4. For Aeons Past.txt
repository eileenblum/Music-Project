[Music by Stefanovic/Alvestam, Lyrics by Stanne]

We cannot sleep forever
Nor can our dreams awake
Mindless our souls are taken
Another future forged
From a dying past

Darkness it feeds me
In this eternal dream
Just barely breathing
Found inside
Of the endless mizmaze
Forever kept in
A never dying shade
Through failing daylight
Saw the dying
Of hope and faith

Not again
Get away
I want to hear it
What I know
Cannot be seen alive
I will never find a way
To make you
Take it back again
What has been
What will be
Another turning
Of the truth
You will find
On your own
In time you will see
Where you have been
For aeons past

Been for aeons past

I am not needed
But for a darkness past
A vision bleeding
Into worlds
At the end of all time
Forever secret
A never spoken line
In fevered slumber
Aeons pass again and again

Not again
Get away
I want to hear it
What I know
Cannot be seen alive
I will never find a way
To make you
Take it back again
What has been
What will be
Another turning
Of the truth
You will find
On your own
In time you will see
Where you have been
For aeons past

Will time ever see me
Knowing all along
What I found in a dream
Gone astray
Will it be there waiting
When I am alone
And the aeons collide
As we go down

We cannot sleep forever
Nor can our dreams awake
Mindless our souls are taken
Another future forged
From a dying past

Not again
Get away
I want to hear it
What I know
Cannot be seen alive
I will never find a way
To make you
Take it back again
What has been
What will be
Another turning
Of the truth
You will find
On your own
In time you will see
Where you have been
For aeons past

Not again
Get away
I want to hear it
What I know
Cannot be seen alive
I will never find a way
To make you
Take it back again
What has been
What will be
Another turning
Of the truth
You will find
On your own
In time you will see
Where you have been
For aeons past

Been for aeons past
