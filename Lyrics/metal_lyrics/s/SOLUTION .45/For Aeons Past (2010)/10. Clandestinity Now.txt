[Music by Stefanovic/Alvestam, Lyrics by Stanne]

Walk away from the nightmare
Total eclipse of the mind
Eyes that have always been blind
Replaced by a different kind

What has been all around
Gone through my time
Forever dreaming in red
Said the sane to the blind
Stay far away
Forever or bygone

Why I cannot
Forsee this end of me
Now befallen my lost kind

What I have found
Is what defines me
Push the past away
Down here alone
Not to return
here I will be
Holding on to something
Turn away from all
A life now concealed for me

What has been all around
Gone through my time
Forever dreaming in red
Said the sane to the blind
Stay far away
Forever or bygone

What I have found
Is what defines me
Push the past away
Down here alone
Not to return
here I will be
Holding on to something
Turn away from all
A life now concealed for me

Awake in the dark of my hiding
Far from the world
Where the lies cannot reach
And the hours pretend

Not let into what is mine
Never share what I have found
From the world I am gone

Ways of the dark now trespass
Coming to claim what is mine
Eyes deceive believers
Upset indifferent minds

Misgive in our light of day
Perceived in darkness
All that I see now
Pitch black
Future obscure
This has to be

Am I now
What is to come of misery
I have yet to see how
All our thoughts
Are weakened by
This dying world
Selfchosen ending
Come to pass on this last
Day of reckoning
Greet the end of reason
Cannot face the strength
Of the ones gone to faith
To shield forever

No more
Will be of what we were
And will we ever be coherent
All for this only to remain
Not faced with
The ultimate standoff
When I am waking up alone
The wall
Is still wrapped around me
No one witnessing
My own passing away

Home is hell to me now
Here is salvation
Fall from the heights
Of safety
To the darkest of depths

What I have found
Is what defines me
Push the past away
Down here alone
Not to return
here I will be
Holding on to something
Turn away from all
A life now concealed for me

Mistreated by life again
Deceived by darkness
All that I see now
Pitch black
Fear is in me
This cannot be

No more
Will be of what we were
And will we ever be coherent
All for this only to remain
Not faced with
The ultimate standoff

Nothing more
Will come from the union
Of reason and faith undying
Lost now
In the mazelike passageway
of argument and false claims

Rage now to the sound of
Total resistance of life
Eyes so blind forever
Drawn from the innocent mind

Leave it all behind

So lost in time
Forever and always
Remember the way it was
Seemed to last
In fear of the now
In fear of tomorrow
And all that has yet to pass
Out of our reach
We are going nowhere
Faster than ever
And there is no way
We will be last

A level further down
Deep below
Begin on a journey alone
The way I want to see
It all end
Something never to be shown

Told through the dreaming
Time and again
In our dying
Speaking now to the end

We favoured the laws
Of insanity's logic
And braced the storm
Of humble advice
To the unfathomable depths
Of secrecy
We pray for
Clandestinity now

What has been all around
Gone through my time
Forever dreaming in red
Said the sane to the blind
Stay far away
Forever or bygone

What I have found
Is what defines me
Push the past away
Down here alone
Not to return
here I will be
Holding on to something
Turn away from all
A life now concealed for me

What I have found
Is what defines me
Push the past away
Down here alone
Not to return
here I will be
Holding on to something
Turn away from all
A life now concealed for me
