[Japanese Bonus Track]What if the tales are true
The reversal of all we know
GraspingÂ 
On the other side
Are the ones now wanting in

What if we set the scene (the scene)
To break our thoughts and minds to pieces
Confined to this forever
Call from beyond the other side
Is now breaking through
Spirit side dreams of life

What of the stories told
What is in the insipid code
TracingÂ 
The facts back to life
Spirit side dreamingÂ 
Controlling us

What if we set the scene (the scene)
To break our thoughts and minds to pieces
Confined to this forever
Call from beyond the other side
Is now breaking through
Spirit side dreams of life

On the recieving end
Of spirit side dreaming
Opposite sidesÂ 
Of the spectrum
Of time and space

Call from beyond the other side
Is now breaking through
Spirit side dreams of life
Call from beyond the other side
Is now breaking through
Spirit side dreams of life
