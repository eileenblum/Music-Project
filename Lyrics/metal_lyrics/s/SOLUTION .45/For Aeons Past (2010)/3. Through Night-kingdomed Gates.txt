[Music by Stefanovic/Alvestam, Lyrics by Stanne]

Forever dreaming
Way down
In the blindsighted night
For I just try to avoid
Giving out inside (inside)

Only way out, now
Through
Night-kingdomed gates, go

Whoever is the closest
The end
Of this journey within
Can see the future and all
That it holds for me

Go, find what is veiled
Behind
The night-kingdomed gates

Time and again
I find myself forgiven
By uncharted forces
Out of reach
And now I know that
Everything
Must end to start
The healing
To resume with hands
No longer chained

I am he debtor
For all savings graces
Of time
The means
Excused by the acts
That we keep concealed

Only way out, now
Through
Night-kingdomed gates, go

I have never been here
The outskirts
Of sanity's halls
As far as it will go
And as long as it takes

Go, find what is veiled
Behind
The night-kingdomed gates

Time and again
I find myself forgiven
By uncharted forces
Out of reach
And now I know that
Everything
Must end to start
The healing
To resume with hands
No longer chained

I am the one
That has to try and reason
There are no boundaries
And nothing to forgive
Once through this gateway
There is no reversion
What now remains is that
With which I cannot deal

Time and again
I find myself forgiven
By uncharted forces
Out of reach
And now I know that
Everything
Must end to start
The healing
To resume with hands
No longer chained

Set ahead
