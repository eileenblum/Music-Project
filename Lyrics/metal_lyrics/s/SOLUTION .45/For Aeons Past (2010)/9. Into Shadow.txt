[Music by Stefanovic/Alvestam, Lyrics by Stanne]

You have given desire a name
These tremors I have felt
Are the remnants of dying
Whenever you are gone
From our days
I am alone
All that we had will now end

I know I am not to blame
I know you do not feel the same
Whatever I did
Wont you please forgive me

You brought down
The heavens again
Set stage for my pain
Tragedy and disaster
And suddenly gone on your way
So alone
All that we were is now lost

I know I am not to blame
I know you do not feel the same
Whatever I did
Wont you please forgive me

Never again
Cannot take the pain
We were once
Now we are nothing
I am half alive
Gone into shadow

I know I am not to blame
I know you do not feel the same
Whatever I did
Wont you please forgive me

Why wont you please forgive me!
