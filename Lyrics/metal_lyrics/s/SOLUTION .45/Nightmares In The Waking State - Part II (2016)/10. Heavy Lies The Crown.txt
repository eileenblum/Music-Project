At all hours of the day and night,
We are one (we are one)

Lost between here and forever
Far away from time and space
In a dream of now and never,
I awake

No source in sight
The world is a vortex
A ten-ton weight of nothing
Black hole incarnate

Turn the edge of fear
Final goodbye?
Heavy lies the crown
Wound to heal the breach
Seen with the mindâs eye
Heavy lies the crown

Gone through fire and water for a relief

Self-medicate of darkly meditate
Those dark clouds over your head
Frustration, anger and hatred
You know them so well by now
