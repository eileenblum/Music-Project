Sudden realness
Cast in shadow
Shifter in the sands
Broken silence
Torn agenda
Slipping through my hands

In wait
Slowly turning
The fear of fear itself
Attached yet disconnected
Here at the end of my rope

An inescapable dream
My guiding light
At the root of this two-faced night
An inescapable dream
My inner sight
In the dark where our worlds unite

Time now freeze-framed
Truth revalued
Future yesterdays
Cyclone chamber
Nightmare sequence
Falling out of grace

Against better judgment
I let the sea walls burst
Crawling minefields blinded
Forced to rush into extremes
