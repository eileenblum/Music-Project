Brought back to the scene
Of answers letting go
A shift burning still
With questions down below
Through me, spiraling
The storm that never passed
In search of an end
A quest from first to last
In full blast

With cold piercing nails
Sunk into my world
I am holding on for all Iâm worth

Once more reason fades
Into a blinding light
Far gone, taking heed
The wisdom of hindsight
And so, as I walk
Into the afterglow
I see signs of life
Among the veils of woe

With cold piercing nails
Sunk into my world
I am holding on for all Iâm worth
As time passes by
Grip is losing out
At a loss while waiting for rebirth

Pain is the sense of comfort
Fear is the state of mind
Born of the ghost in hiding
Hope of a different kind
