You must trust the worst
That may wait
Is losing to this death
The ending you swore to evade
In such a defeat
By making distance
To this state called life
You will see how nothing means nothing

It came with paradox
Could not be dealt with nor transformed
Powers it held
All you allowed yourself to lose

So you try to see and explain
How the world is twisting and turning
You paint pictures in your head
To make sense out of the senseless

Chain connector
