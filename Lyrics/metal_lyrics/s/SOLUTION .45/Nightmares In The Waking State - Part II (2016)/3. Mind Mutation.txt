In the arms of recreation
In the presence of defeat
What is hanging in the balance
An alliance incomplete

A nightmare serving many masters
The unreality that should not be,
Now holding me against the power of endurance
Where time and tide wait for no man
The immortality that could not be,
Now under lock and key

Once the wheel has come full circle
Transformation will take aim
Massing up on the horizon
To a new dawn laying claim
To break a journey
To stop the blood
To quench a fire
To stand the flood

Chain of thought
Never letting go
Will not clear away until itâs gone
Set ablaze
Ever and again
Sun and shadow are at daggers drawn
