Caught in the wheel of fate
A leap in the dark
Lost to incompletion
Living the part
Exit strategies
Smoke and mirrors
In its shadow nothing escapes
The piercing errors

Off-guard
Source unleashed
Closed circuit dreaming
Unbound
Fear the beast
Kept out of sight
Transformed
Mind besieged
Course alteration
Undone
Sense decreased
The faint pulse of light

Delicate world of glass
Under the skin
Once sprung from a standstill
Raging within
Shapeless to the eye
Cold emotion
What will never fall to the ground
Now set in motion
