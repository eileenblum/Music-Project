[Lead: Gardberg]

Running away far from it all
Lying in wait yet riding for a fall
The line of fire denied
Exit through a sense of void inside
The entering phase complete
What lives another day
Silence â triggering tipping the scales
An easy prey
Now being thrown to the wolves
Here dies another day
Guidance â withering shadow prevails
From sources stray
Its life it pulls
No man's land a monstrosity built on sand

Battled thought strength inhaled
Roles reversed change unveiled
Focus caught host exhaled
Weakness cursed [2x]

Running away far from it all
Lying in wait yet riding for a fall
The line of fire denied
Exit through a sense of void inside
The entering phase complete
What lives another day
Silence â triggering tipping the scales
An easy prey
Now being thrown to the wolves
Here dies another day
Guidance â withering shadow prevails
From sources stray
Its life it pulls
No man's land a monstrosity built on sand

In the end when the unpleasant truth
Comes crawling out of the woodwork
Cherished illusions and attempted escapes
Turn to gleams of light in the dirt

What lives another day
Silence â triggering tipping the scales
An easy prey
Now being thrown to the wolves
Here dies another day
Guidance â withering shadow prevails
From sources stray
Its life it pull
