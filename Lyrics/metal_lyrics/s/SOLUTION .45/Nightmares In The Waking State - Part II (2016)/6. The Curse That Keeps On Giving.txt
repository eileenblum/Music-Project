On ghostlike fields
Under a strange sky
Cannot cross the void
No matter how hard I try

And so this nothing becomes
My all (my fall?)
Through which I have to crawl

The curse that keeps on giving
A fire without a flame
The curse that keeps on giving
A changing that stays the same 

Used skeleton key
Thereâs no setting free
Told to be forever
Standing the test of time

Will not let it ride
Yet turning aside
Innermost rain shadow reaching
The end of the line
