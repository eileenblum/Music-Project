A darkness formed in broad daylight
Relief and scare in one
It fell exposed, yet unannounced
A storm cloud chasing the sun

Time and time again
The ground gives way
On the world now thrown
Blind to what is feared
The wretched seed
Of the downfall sown

All exits fastened from within
A scarred design in chains
To yield obedience to what is veiled
A constant change of lanes
