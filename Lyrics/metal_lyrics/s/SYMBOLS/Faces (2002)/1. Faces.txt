[Music: Demian Tiguez / Rodrigo Mello, Lyrics: Rodrigo Mello]

Faces look inside of me
Crazy and magic people feelings make me strong
Faces show me who I am
Right now all this people make my spirit grow
We are on the stage
Watching this great eyes
We are ON the stage
Playing to embrace them
We are ON the stage
Rocking forever
