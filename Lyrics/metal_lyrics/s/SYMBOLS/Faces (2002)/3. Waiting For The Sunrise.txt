[Music: Demian Tiguez, Lyrics: Rodrigo Mello]

Waiting for the sunrise
Looking for another piece of me
Avoiding the sorrow
All night long

IÂ´m lost in this island
Searching a shelter in my mind
Putting out the fire
Of my soul

I should go over the concepts
To survive in this place without words

Living for the moment
Dreaming about words and feelings
Looking for the way out
On my own

IÂ´m waiting for the sunrise
Maybe the world is waiting too
IÂ´m lost in my mind
And I feel the world lost inside of me

Now my senses are stong
And different things my mind can perceive
Now I can see tangible things
Building our society
