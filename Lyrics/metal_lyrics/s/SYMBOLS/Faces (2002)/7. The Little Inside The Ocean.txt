[Music: Demian Tiguez, Lyrics: Rodrigo Mello]

Oh my heart in vain
Is falling into the pain
There's no more sense to get up
Out of bed again

In the morning sleep
I'm Dreaming sudden dreams
Of my inner self

All there I need
From this world
Is inside of me
All I could change through the time
Is myself

Oh my heart again
As always feels the same
PoundS of confusion that
Haunt me through my mind
I wanna fly Away
And flow free like the wind
Only a voice of the ego shuts up!

In the morning sleep
I'm Dreaming sudden dreams
Of my inner self

Breathing the air slowly and evenly
Closing my eyes I can see my Silent soul

I am the little inside the ocean
