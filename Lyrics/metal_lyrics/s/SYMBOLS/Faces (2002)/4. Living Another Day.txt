[Music: Demian Tiguez, Lyrics: Rodrigo Mello]

It seems that space and time
Just pass by
Where am I?

There's something wrong
I feel like falling

Oh! What is happened to me?
Oh! What's going on

Turn on the lights
It's the end of the line

I can't see my body alive
I can fly
Strange feelings make me happy
Oh! whats happened to me?
Now I undeRstand, I died!

I just can't believe it's happening
In my mind faces and some places arise!
In my heart, all the people that I loved

Turn on the lights
Pass through my life
There's no more future!
Turn on the lights
Here's another side of life!

Turn on the lights
Pass through my life
There's no more future!
Turn on the lights
Only the spirit survive
