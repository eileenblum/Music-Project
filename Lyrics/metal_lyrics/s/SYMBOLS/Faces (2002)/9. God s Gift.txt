[Music: Demian Tiguez, Lyrics: Demian Tiguez / Bruna Favero]

Every night I feel in my soul
And I see changes, my mind, my spirit and future
All the time life goes on
Feel as new part of mine
God gave me a Gift
All over the time
I feel you by my side
Fill in my life
I need you by my side

Tell me why we're one
Wherever the place
Happy or crying
I'll always believe in
Close your eyes
And feel the sun
It's the only one
Like mother and father
Waiting a son
Learning true love
Leaving behind
My old life

All over the time
I feel you by my side
Fill in my life
I need you by my side
Time after time
I wan't you in my life
Believe in my heart
Come running
To my arms
