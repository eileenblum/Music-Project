[Music: Demian Tiguez / Fabrizio Di Sarno, Lyrics: Rodrigo Mello / Fabrizio Di Sarno]

He is an archer
Searching for an answer
Memories are flying
Like arrows tHrough the space
All these victories
No matter how they were before
What's going on?
All the truth is bursting his soul

Lonely, the silence sayS
That the target is far from his aim
Lonely, inside his heart
Its the last inner fight in his life

Only the balance
Keep the rivers flow
LiVing the moment
He knows the power of mind

Oceans of know edge are waiting for him
Giving him the chance to reach the land of peace
Oh! He will win
Now the silence is part of his being
