[Music: Demian Tiguez, Lyrics: Fabrizio Di Sarno]

Through an empty heart
Remains a fading flame
There is a DIME light
There is a restfull place
Love hurts your feelings sometimes
But I still believe in it

I had a lonely night
I couldn't see your face
But there's a silent hope
No matter what you say
Oh, we can't throw that away!
Tell me you won't go
I see your hazy eyes.
But I won't give up, this time, MY LOVE
No matter how hard you try to scape
From this hidden desire. Oh my heart

Bright times will be waiting for your heart.
