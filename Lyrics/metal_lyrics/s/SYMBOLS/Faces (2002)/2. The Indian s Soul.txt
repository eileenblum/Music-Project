[Music: Demian Tiguez, Lyrics: Rodrigo Mello]

Hills on my way
I'm standing in the rain singing
My time to pray
Love will never end

Feeling again the touch of winds
The magic inside my heart

Trees on my way
I'm standing in the raiN living

My time to PRAY
Trust will never end

Feeling again the touch of winds
The magic inside my heart
Feeling again fields of fortune in my hands
The sunshine in my mind

The good red way shows much more, muchmore to pray
The good blue way shows much more, muchmore to say

Feeling again the touch of winds
The magic inside my heart
Feeling again fields of fortune in my hands
The sunshine in my mind

Feeling again the touch of winds
The magic inside my heart
Feeling again fields of fortune in everywere
In my thoughs I have to find
