Happiness is something
People hardly achieve

In this perfect Babel 's Tower
All this rottenness makes me sick

You are living in ambition
And you don't have regret

It just stinks and don't you notice?
All this greed is in your veins!

But all could change
Start with you!
You could really change
With this we can go on!

Can you feel this madness?
The power is blinding and killing!
Can you feel this sadness?
So you will pay for never more!

Happiness is in your mind
And you must believe

In this perfect union of power
All the hope must still remain

We live in this same fucking place
And you musn't forget

Our miracles are our magic
And with them we'll reach our aim

Can you feel this madness?
The power is blinding and killing!
Can you fell this sadness?
So you will pay for never more!
Can you feel this happiness?
If you can give you can earn it!
Can you feel this success?
It's the name of dictated game!
