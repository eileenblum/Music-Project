[Demo Version]

Can you think about it?
Children dying everyday
They can't get their away (Africa)

How can we close our eyes?
Leave out their dreams and broken hearts
They don't have a chance living in misery

Sometimes I turn the TV on
And I feel like screaming
Many people just like me
Wait the time to fade away

Can you think about it?
A child cries for one day more
Cries with all her faith (dream on)

They don't deserve it
And die without a hope to survive
We have to believe and save Africa

People in the hole world that nothing can about it
Try to help and bring their hope again
Man of power turn thir back and kill in the silence
People must forget them and go on
