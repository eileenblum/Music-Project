[Demo Version]

Come with me into the mirror's place
Look yourself, see your face
Get out of here and fly high in your mind
Where are you, search and find

Only you can make your way
Only you can try again
Your heart and your soul
Together will protect you, my friend

Turn of the lights and see your self inside
Who are you?
Is any pride?

Dreams and reality in the same frame
Trust in you!
Scream your name!

The days will come to make your hope return

The days will come to make your heart feel
What's more trust
Believe yourself forever
Or you'll have begin again
