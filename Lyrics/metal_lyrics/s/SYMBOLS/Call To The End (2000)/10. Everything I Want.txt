So many times you tried to let me know
That for so long I'm out of your shore
So this time I'm gonna let you go
'Cause honey, I don't want you more

I met a girl who really turns me on
She's so hot
Just one more look I'm waiting for
She teases me right on the spot

Hot lips, long legs
She's got everything you don't
So smart, so pretty
She's got everything I want

It's really boring being with you
And that's the reason I'm getting out
You turned my life a real mess
Oh shit! I'm getting crazy with you!

I met a girl and now I just think of her
I must confess I felt in love
She's just so perfect, I can't believe!
