[Demo Version]

We are living the age of the stars
We are trying to find our salvation
We are going to live on Mars
We are leaving the light to dark!

No feelings
No scruples
We've gotta change our minds

Remember the profecy:
"Black Sun, Blood Rain, Fire Sky"

Please stop the wars
Peace on and on
Please stop the wars

We have no one reason to be proud of
The future is bad
Science studies other kinds of life
And we forget ourselves

It's time to wake up
Time for union
Time to break the walls

Why so many questions and no answers?
Why so many tears?
All the signs are in front of our eyes
But we can't see it there
