[Demo Version]

In this junk room
The Golden Statue shines
In the middle of the night

In this lonely room
Forgotten Gods woke up
They wanna their revenge

Sons of Lord
Do you know what it means?
The faith is a gift and a dream
And just you can know it

But we always could come back to Lord
And He will set us free from the curse

The Gods curse will come
And the end is near
There's no way out

In this hopefull room
I beg peace to them
I don't wanna die
