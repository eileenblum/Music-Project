Arise destroyer!
It's the call to the end

By the force and the religion
Has born the evil again

But through the stars
The dream remain's
You don't fade away

Over here althrough these wars
We must be strong and keep fighting on

Please don't run away
We've got a lot work to do
To keep us feeling alive
Would it be a dream come true?

The vew millennium will come
And it must not be doomed
And the will of ahnging must be
Inside of you
