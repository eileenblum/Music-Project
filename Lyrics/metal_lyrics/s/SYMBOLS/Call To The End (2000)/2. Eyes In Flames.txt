Look at the sky and tell me what you see ?
Warplanes flying to kill the enemy
In the name of their fatherland

People are dying everywhere
All the difference we can't forget
Allienation we can't allow

If we try to save the world
And change towards a new curse
(What's the meaning of the signs)

There's no time we've change our minds
Turn life into a dream

In the streets the danger is near
Furious people kill themselves for fear
The wickedness will rule the man

Life became a hell 'cause of the greed
(I can't believe, why do they it?)

I think they will never change

Just war, just pain
Look out
Afraid, so many lies
No doubt
The flames in their eyes
Reveal the caos
The order is unreal
