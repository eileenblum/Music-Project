Imagine the future
I don't like what I see there
From eastward to westward
Destruction desolated us all

Just hating and raging
Feel up there desperate minds
Not taking, just giving
Would it be the best way

Not keeping, just sharing
Maybe just I'm a dreamer...

Devastating everywhere
The judgement day came through
But on contrary of what we thought
The evil where left behind
All yours tears keep falling down
But no one really seems to care
All the sinners paid by staying alive
But now the blessed rest in paradise

I tried to forgive the things you've done
Maybe you don't believe but I tried so hard
I know these days are gone, but they don't let me go
I just can't believe in the shits we've done
