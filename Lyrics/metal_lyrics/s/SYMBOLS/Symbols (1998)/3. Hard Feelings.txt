I hope to live more to take care of you
I can wonder why to me is not enough
I was living without reason, when I saw you
You changed my mind and soul,
You changed all my life

I have no choice
I must close my eyes
To give all my love
Don't be afraid

It's always the same
I lost my mind
And when the night falls I try to keep the faith
Someday I will know what you really mean
I need to find someway I gotta have you

I dream all the time
I wanna make you happy
Always by my side
Always together

It's a hard felling (that) I can't understand
Now doesn't matter, I'm ready to move on
It's a hard feeling (that) I can't understand
It's unfair, but together we can win
