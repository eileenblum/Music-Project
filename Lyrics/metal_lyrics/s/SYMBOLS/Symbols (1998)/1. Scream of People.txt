Madness, desire, blood
Sadness, anger

Dreams about happiness, cry and pain
I'm waiting for a reaction from somebody

All people are screaming, now I can't hear you voice
All people are feeling, they don't have many choice
All people are dreaming, about a better world

So many ways to drop him down
Conviction made aware
This pain is hard and burst my heart
Infecting all our hope

Deceptions
Illusions
This I will always have
Sometimes I want to die
