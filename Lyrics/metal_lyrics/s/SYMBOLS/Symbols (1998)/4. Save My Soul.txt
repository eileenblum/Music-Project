Can you remember about the promise you've made me
I'm trying to find out, a clear way
Help me to get out of this darkness I'm scared
I swear that I don't wanna do it for bad

Help me, save me, I can't cry anymore
Save my soul

Open my eyes and tell me what I must do
Guide me to away, I could survive
All what I feeling in my heart is sadness and pain
Everything in my life is so stange

Help me, save me, I can't cry anymore
To set me free, I'm sorry, I can't open this doo

Trying to fly with my mind and soul
To the sky, save my soul
One more time, I can't support this lies
In my life, save my soul
