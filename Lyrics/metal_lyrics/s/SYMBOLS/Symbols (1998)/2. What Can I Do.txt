Lonely nights again
Suddenly your face has disappeared
In front my eyes

The light that cheers my soul
Fill in the emptiness of my heart
My pride stays alive

I don't believe in love no more
I can't release my emotions
So now it's time to open all the doors
Across the fear
I feel that I can win

I wanna live
I wanna fly
To recover all my dreams
High like an eagle
Eagles flying to the sky
So long
I need to find again my hope
