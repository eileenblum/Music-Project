How could I try to forget you
If I can't stop loving you...
I've been waiting for so long darling
And I coudn't leave you now

Our lives are so together
And for yo we are just friends...
I can tell you my devotion
'Cause I'm begging for your love

My life is all yours,
My love is all yours,
My life's all yours,
The love's all yours,
That I just can't do it now...

Baby you must be mine tonight
I can't wait you anymore
'Cause my heart is crying hard for you
We must make love all the night
In my life, I just loved one time
And I'm sure it must be you
And now, I will invite you to...

Make love through the night...
