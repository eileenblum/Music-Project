The heart wonât cease a beat
Prevailing despite my disloyalty
Perseverance of purgatory
A mind now rotting, distorted with disease
Burdened with despair

Creating a serene illusion
Losing the glimpse of the fatal delusion
Fate I have tempted and with knives I have danced
Have I paid my debt, was the full price exacted?
Am I being misguided by the velvet glove?
Am I the bringer of rapture, the bearer of the darkest days?
The pressure ever mounting, I can feel my spirit break
Will I leave a legacy of woe?

I cried the swansâ song though in error I sang
The purest notes of its melody reverberate
Echoing all of my shameful sins
Echoing all of my shameful sins
Mesmerising and haunting
Echoing all of its whisperings

The phantoms of uncertainty haunt my visions edge
Slowly gaining substance, then fading into smoke
In the mist I see my bravery reflected
I find myself lost in the workings of lifeâs complex faith
The reality rift distorted by the sleeping shift
These sands constantly fluctuating in a sway too foul
The heart and mind waltz discordantly
Mimicking structure but failing at grace
Tranquility is but a flicker of a memory

In the forms of my family I entrench myself
Trusting that through loveâs misleading lies there will be some sanity
My wish is to end the desperate dance of dissonance
Though the present skies seem bright and clear
Itâs for the futures bitter promise that I now fear

I no longer believe in the terrible lie that we forever call âHopeâ
