Released from the martyrs chains
Primal force unleashed
I reign now once again
Released from the martyrs chains
Primal force unleashed
I reign now once again
This is the beginning of the fucking end

I destroyed the tapestry of the ages
Unravelled the weave of history
These threads now dissipated into the void

Aeons of mistakes left to breed and evolve
Birthing blight and carrying contagion
My essence shakes with purpose and passion
The flower of annihilation blooms

Harbinger, wiping clean the slate
Of wrath and rage my soul is buried beneath

A disease ignored without halt
In their putridity I am entranced
Potential squandered without fail
A cosmic stain
The perfect aberration

Cleaving all asunder
Scratching and scraping at the very fabric of existence
I am that which mends
I am that which rends
A complete revision, violent abolition
The systemic and gruesome design
I will not cease until their souls I have reaped

Finally the peace of the purge
Purified and perfected
All the machinations disrupted and ended

My purpose beckons alluringly
Only one flame burns brightly
Now we must dance
Alone in the emptiness, all creations erased
This is our destiny
This is how it was meant to be
This is our destiny
This is how it was meant to be

Exiled
Despised
Fratricide
A god will die
Exiled
Despised
Fratricide
A god will die
A god will die
