Delayed no longer
Castigation, the tone of judgement rings
Twins of creation and desolation
Reunion or retribution?
Finality looms in the heavens

The ages of separation have brought the oaths to breaking point
The constant dance of dreams and doom
Each second poignant, fraught with tension and fear

(Death speaks)
âI bear the wounds of fratricide
Blood of my blood
A reign of errant neglect
Mirror of my soul
Your trace scattered to the abyssâ

Burdened by the weight of bonds once had
The severed ends still clinging to the soul constantly
Burdened by the weight of bonds once had The severed ends still clinging to the soul constantly

(Death speaks again)
âOnce, we were whole
Towards perfection we did grow
In unison we did develop and thrive
But you disregard your purpose, destiny now scorned
Creationâs flame brightly blazed beyond control
Callous architect I rid this universe of youâ

(Life speaks)
âBrother, my villainy is beyond redemption
For each second that passed I grieved for thee
But it is forgiveness I plead
In reverence I offer myself
Let us mend this rift and become whole once more
We can reign as king, sovereign souls
Let us cease the cataclysm
Together we shall cultivate creationâ

Betrayals
I shall revoke your stain on the realms
I will dismantle your very essence
Overthrown

Now alone, the emptiness echoes my lack
I, everything, am bereft of life

I embrace existence
Confronting my cowardice
Released, my bonds disband
My spirit dissolves
Atonement I attain
Life and death, united for eternity
The void silent once again
Peaceful, quiet, forever purged
Peaceful, quiet, forever
