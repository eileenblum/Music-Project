[feat. Mark Poida of Aversions Crown]Almighty sundering
Precursor to death
Descendant of failure
Elemental energy now swarms in myriad devastation
Arrested by the pattern of turmoil
We are entombed in the horror most foul
Exposing our fragility
The mortal bonds break
And the threads of time unwind and fray
Oh, giants of nature
I am the tyrant of sin
Depose me, smite me, but just leave humanity be

The ground spews forth masses of flame
Oceans of mayhem now crash down on the land
Air now thick with the scent of the dead
This is the ground where the dark god treads

The shadow now cast over the waning sun
Black as pitch, the demonic negation of light
Despair now hangs thick with a toxic scent
The devourersâ presence engulfs with malignant storms

Purge

Deconsecrated
The ashes in the winds bear the remnants of life
The product of a vile master plan

The ruin and chaos guided by wretched hand
(Mark Poida)
Shuddering, the earth heaves a final sigh
We bear witness to the ascendance of darkness.
Ushering in the final silence
The fable of salvation
There is no blinding light of deliverance
This is Perdition's Throne
My final home
