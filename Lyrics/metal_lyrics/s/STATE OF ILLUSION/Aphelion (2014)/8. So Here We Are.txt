Take a breath and see the truth that lies beneath
A heavy heart caused by a planted seed
And I will fall into your arms again
But will you keep from swaying in the wind?

The storm will come to blow us away
And when it's done will you remain?

So here we are again
Letting our preconceptions win
I followed my heart while you chased your stars
Then you let your walls cave in
And take my heart with them
They took my heart with them

Take a breath and see that I will never leave
And I'll walk this road until I've achieved my dreams
And you will falls into my arms again
And I will keep from swaying in the wind

A life of loneliness won't help you reach the end
And you will find no rest
Because you wander down this road
All alone
