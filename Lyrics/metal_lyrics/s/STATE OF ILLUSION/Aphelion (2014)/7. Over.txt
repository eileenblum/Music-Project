Will you never learn to shut your mouth?
Open up to let the ignorance out
At night you dream of your perfect world
The voice of reason is seldom heard

Be careful what you wish for

The more you say, the less you think
And I can't fight you anymore
The more you take, the less you gain
In my eyes, this is over

Say what you will about my life
Let heaven judge our souls this time
