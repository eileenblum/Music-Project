With each step, I confess I feel you slip away
Drift away
Take the time, read my mind--you'll see me lose control
I lose control
You're all I have

If you could only see through my eyes
If only you weren't so blind
You'd see each step you take
Makes my heart break
Makes my heart break

I'm alone, I've become so cold
I give you what's left of me
You're all I have, just grab my hand
And I'll give you a broken man

With each step, I confess
You're all I have
You're all I have
