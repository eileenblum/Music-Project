Another night, I can't sleep again
And in this light, I can see no end
And I can't rest my weary eyes tonight
Inspired by this dream I have to chase
Always

I'm not afraid of falling, you see
Because I will get back up again
And I will brave the darkness because I
Will keep on pushing until
I have reached the end

Apathetic world, I have freed myself
The grip you had on me, it has worn out
And I won't compromise who I am inside for you
For you

Just walk away, because I'll never change
I've dug my own grave

I will reach the end
