Well, the hands begin to fade
And time slips away
And everything has changed
I feel so incomplete
I feel so incomplete

And I can't live without you here anymore
I can't breathe
But as the walls crash down around me
The waves are slowly rising to carry me
Back to you

And our time begins to fade
And our hands slip away
And everything has changed
Just give me one more day
Give me one more day

I can't breathe
