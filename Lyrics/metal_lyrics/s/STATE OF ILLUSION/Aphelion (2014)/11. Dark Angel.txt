I know you have no wings, but you play the part of the angel so well
And after you lull us all to sleep, then you'll creep right in
And make a mess of everything
But why can't you see
I don't believe your messianic lies?

I'll keep on looking to the sky
You lead, I'll never follow
Because there's no tomorrow

Dark Angel, be gentle when you send in the rains to wash us away
Dark Angel, without you, we'll make it through the darkest day
Dark Angel, don't you know? Where you lead I won't follow
Dark Angel, with you in control
Then there's no tomorrow

You'll never die for me but you play the part of the hero so well
And after you lull us all to sleep then you'll creep right in
And make a mess of everything

Dark Angel, be gentle when you send in the rains to wash us away
Dark Angel, don't you know that there's no tomorrow?
Dark Angel, don't you know? Where you lead I won't follow
Dark Angel, with you in control
Then there's no tomorrow
Because there's no tomorrow
