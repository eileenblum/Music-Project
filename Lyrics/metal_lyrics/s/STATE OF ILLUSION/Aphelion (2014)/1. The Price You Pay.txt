Breathe a breath of free air, isn't it what you wanted?
Or do you even care about the path you've chosen?
Look around and see the damage you're still doing
Look around and see the hell in which you're living

And I'd love to be the one to pull you from your grave
But it's time for you to wake and see the ugly mess you've made

Blame it on a bitter pill, blame it on your pain
Blame it on the ones who only ever gave you everything
I breathed life into your lungs, but who am I to say?
They did all they could to save you
And their heart's the price you paid along the way

Did you break away, free from the chains that held you?
Or were you just afraid? Afraid that the truth would seep through?
A knife in the back of the hand that feeds you
Bitter is the taste of blood that we once knew

And I'd love to be the one to pull you from this mess you've made
But it's time for you to wake and see you're standing in your grave
