He packs his bags, not knowing if he'll ever come back home
No turning back, this is the path he chose to walk alone
He'll never know the countless thoughts and prayers that follow
He'll never know the hearts that have been broken

He's a hero and a friend
His angel in heaven watches over him

Each night, I pray the winds will bring him safely back home
And he'll walk away from the nightmare and finally see the sun
He'll never show the scars that left him feeling hollow
He'll never know the pride he has awoken

A hero, a hero and a friend
