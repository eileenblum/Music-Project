Another tear, she feels she's lost it all
Another pill, all it took for you to fall
Another stone to throw at what remains
Another rose to lay upon your grave
You stole her everything, the day
You walked away

Let another liar's lullaby be the wind beneath your wings
And another tempting sirens cry lend you imaginary peace
But in the world you leave behind, you know you'll come to find
All this time, your life was just another alibi

Another scar is all that she can take
Another lie to cover up the trace
Another swear to the heavens filled with rage
Another prayer with a hope that you will change

But there's still time to change your life

So, let another liar's lullaby be the wind beneath your wings
Let the siren tempt you one more time for another day of peace
But in the world you leave behind, you know you'll come to find
All this time, your life was just another alibi
Just another alibi
