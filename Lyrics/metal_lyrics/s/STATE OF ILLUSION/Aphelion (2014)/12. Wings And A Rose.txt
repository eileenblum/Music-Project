The time has come for us to say goodbye
I did all I could to make you fly
Consciously, you chose to walk down the fiery road
And you cast off your wings and hold onto your rose

You fall to your hands and knees
Praying, "Father please forgive me, for I know not what I do"
But I know you
You knew it all along, but you weren't strong enough
And now there's nothing left that I can do
It's up to you

Alone you gaze into the future that you've made
The life you've lived cannot be erased
You sit and wait for a savior to take you away
But until you find yourself, nothing's every going to change

You take what the Giver's given to you
And this is what you choose, this is what you choose
And I'm always in the distance and I'll never give up on you
But to send a prayer to Heaven is all that I can do

The time has come for us to say goodbye
I did all I could to make you fly
I tried
