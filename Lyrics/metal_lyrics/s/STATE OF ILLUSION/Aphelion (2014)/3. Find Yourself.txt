It's over now, but the shadow still remains
Like a ghost from the past that won't go away
How could so much love bring so much hate?
But you always saw things differently

You tried so hard to carry on
But now your soul is bleeding
Your pride could only save you for so long
And now you find yourself
You find yourself alone

The mirror will show you who's really to blame
Always the victim, you couldn't live with the shame
Medicate your imaginary pain
But you always had to run away

I tried so hard to carry on
But now my soul is bleeding
I tried to save you for so long
But now you find yourself
You find yourself alone
