In my dark and empty heartland
Shadows paint the walls
And from what I can remember
I've deceived you all

In my dark and empty heartland,
Sorrow keeps moving in
And nothing seems to be changing
This everlasting sin

I've let it slip away, stabbed in the back
Stuck in all this madness, I'm about to crack

So let these murky waters take me home
I don't want to be here left alone

In this broken barren wasteland
Hope's my only friend
And my wounds they seem so lonely
Will they ever mend?

In my dark and empty heartland
Shadows paint the walls
In the reflections from the mirrod
I see a portrait of a whore
