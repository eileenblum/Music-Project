I don't dare to speak
Isolaton complete
But you don't understand
Don't you know I'm innocent
Swallowed by indifference
But you don't seem to fucking care now do you?

Escape is all we need
To a place called disappear

I would give anything to see you smile again
Like I did last summer
I would give anything to feel alive again
But I guess it counts for nothing

With confidence aside
You face another tide
Your fragile strctures break

In a single empty stare
In just one breathe of air
This time your innocence will fail you

Show me how to live again
Why can't you show me how to live again
