I look straight into your eyes
Another stranger passing by
And it keeps me wonder,
were we meant to be?

And I can rest here at your side
In the darkness that you hide
Just reach out and lay your hansds on me

[Chorus]
In sorrow's kitchen will dance
Taste the wine, take a chance
Leae the rest of the world behind
Come with me this is our time...

In sorrow's kitchen we will make it last
In sorrow's kitchen...

I will listen as you speak
But don't turn on tricks on me
And don't answer me
with the same old question

So let us walk into the night
I will be your guiding light
Cause underneath the masquerade...
I know how you feel

In sorrow we will dance
Taste the tears of romance

Won't you come with me?
Won't you come with me?

[Chorus]
In sorrow's kitchen we will dance
Hurt each other time after time
Spend the rest of our days in tears
Come with me my precious...

In sorrow's kitchen
