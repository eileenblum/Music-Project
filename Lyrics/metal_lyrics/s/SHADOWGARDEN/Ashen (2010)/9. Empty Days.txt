The shadows are closing in
Haunted by the breathing shame
And I know, I can not be be forgiven

My tears made out of sin
Blinded by the heart
And I know, I can't go on

So I leave these empty days behind me
I put my head into the noose

Hey, Hey
So I leave these empty days behind me
C'est la vie
So long

With darkness in my eyes
I reach for the other side
And I know, I'm on my way

As the noose gets tighter
As I fear the dark
I know, that I've been forgiven
