I try to find a way, to crompehend with the mess I'm in
I find it hard to stay,
surrounded by emotions so sickening
I can not breathe, in quicksand you know

It's been a long hard road... of unsound thinking
But I keep moving on, meanwhile I'm sinking

It's breathing down my neck
All the times we spent doing nothing
I wasted all those years,
While the years made a waste of me

I can not breathe,
In quicksand you know
