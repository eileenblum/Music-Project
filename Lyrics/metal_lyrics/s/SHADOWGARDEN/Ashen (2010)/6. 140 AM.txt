One burning winter night,
I saw the world through a different light
Euphoria she smiled at me and took me by the hand
Connected through drunken ties,
bent out of shape just kill some time
We're losing ground as we speak,
We better walk away

I didn't mean to be the one,
But I can't make up my mind

We're moving down, down, down
As your hand slips into mine
And without a sound
The world comes crashing down
We pray to the moon, to keep our secret
I won't forget the time, we walked into the light

Yet another cross to bear,
I didn't think I'd really care
With the noose tight around my neck,
I struggle to survive And every time I disappear
Into drunken pastures of despair
I search the light that we once shared,
though my hearts says walk away

We're moving down, down, down
As your hand slips into mine
And without a sound
the world comes crashing down
We pray to the moon, to keep our secret
I won't forget the time, we walked into the light

With no time left to spend
At 1:40 AM
