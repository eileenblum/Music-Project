There's no one here, no one to be
The end of life will set me free
I close my eyes, but still I see
The tears running inside of me

Like an autumn leaf, I decline

To live but to be dead inside
Sweet solitude, for you I've cried
Dim the lights, hold me tight
The sorrow is my only light

There is no happiness, inside of me
only darkness, running free
I close my eyes, but still I see
The tears running inside of me

Like an autumn leaf, I decline

To live but to be dead inside
Sweet solitude, for you I've cried
Dim the lights, hold me tight
The sorrow is my only light

To live...
