Can you see the shadows on the wall?
The tragedy of watching us fall
I can feel it all coming down...

Can you see the shadows on the wall?
The tragedy of watching us fall
I feel it coming down

Feel free to save yourself
Before it all goes up in flames
The fire casts its shadow

In the ashes that we crawl
Lies the witness to our fall
Now we rest in failure's arms

Let us end this wicked game
Cause nothing will remain the same
We were nothing but a shadow play

Tried to swim against the tide
Nothing grows were I used to hide
The addicition is strong within us

There is no saving grace
Out of time out of place The world around us starts to burn
