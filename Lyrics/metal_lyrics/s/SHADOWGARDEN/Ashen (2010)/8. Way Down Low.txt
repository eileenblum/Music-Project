I did you wrong, there's no point in saying
That we can't go on, I've seen it in your eyes
I live within and I know that it hurts you
I watche the distance growing colder with each lie
(with each lie)

I'm way down low
Where the darkness grows
I feel way down low
And I'm begging you, please
Resurrect my soul

It's been too long, it goes without saying
So I move on, no point in dragging you down
I've felt the seasons turn,
I watched your hale burn
No second chance,
No fake romance can save us now
(save us now)
