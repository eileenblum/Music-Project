seen it slighty odd
That the world we live in
Would to have its course
Rising to the top of existence

Our darken brains
Lust for a domination
Perceive mere illusion
And the reality disappears

Ancient myths
Of eternal civilizations
It is a worthless memory
Of venerable fortune tellers

An indivertible end
Not with a highter power
From our indifferent souls
Vegetating from day to day

There are a lot of unknown secrecies
Uncover of many
Remains only on us

The time will come
Majestic silence
Thunderstorm discontinues it only
Remind of a
Long ago civilization
A moss overgrown stone graves
