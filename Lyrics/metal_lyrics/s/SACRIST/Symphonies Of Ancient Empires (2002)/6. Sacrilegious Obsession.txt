Pallid face
Looks to dirty mirror
With a hoary frame
View get she angry
Her beauty slowly decay

Frantic shouts
Which no one hear
Deep in underground
Damned by her master
Frustrated human life
For awful nobility
With no mercy

Virgin in vesture
Reflexioned the candlelight
Reach hand for embrace
But from the chest
The insidious knifes
Rise forward

In the dark passage
Lead to the scaffold
Approach the light
It is not the saviour
But coming devil
In the womans body
To destroy all beauty
And in perverse minds
Satisfy the lust for eternity
