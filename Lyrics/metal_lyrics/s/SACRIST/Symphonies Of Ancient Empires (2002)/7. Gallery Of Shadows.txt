To know answer the questions
The future in the next flash
My mind would get of
The hopeless feelings
The fear of an eternal solitude
Between the grey shadows

Knowledge of unknown
Brings the souls pain
I am bleeding from thrusts
And dying...

My heart is jailed in the temple of grief

I want to leave and shout..

That voice would to wrest
From the all interior
But the silence knock me again
On the ground
I can't rise ..i'm lost

But over my infirmity
Straiting to feel the light
From somewhere comes the shine
Is this the answer I'm looking for
