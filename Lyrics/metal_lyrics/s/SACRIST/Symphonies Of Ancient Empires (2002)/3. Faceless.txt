There is hidden mystery
In the cave of cold
No one of us
Can guess that we will get
Slaves of our ancestors
Which lost their faces
For ever

For a long centuries
They were hidden here
Waiting for the longed-for day
All eager here
Like a ravenous beasts
We are only a defenseless victims

Faceless in cape
Stealing our strength
We are slowly get weak
They will drain our power
In sleep
You are awaking
Near to be death

This dead bodies
Live only of us
Once
Will stay here
The bones in pales
From dust to dust
You can defense
But nothing to change
