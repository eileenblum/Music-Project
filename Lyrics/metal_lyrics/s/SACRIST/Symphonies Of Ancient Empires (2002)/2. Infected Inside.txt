Awaking of dream
In cramp and pain
Alone and desolate
In strange place

The heat perhaps burn my eyes
Whipping by tempest unmercifully
Feeble members steady bound
Paralysed body in the sign of infinity

Cruel punishment to disobedience ones
Who created the lawns into their own picture
Screaming of beats killing me inside
They calling the death
Murders!

My internals laying down beside my legs
Hidden in dust and blood

Poisoned thorns growing through my brain
My body and soul given to them for a vain
Without fight
