There are no humans
There are just flesh
Billions of jaws
How to swallow they know best
Flesh eat flesh
Kind of the same kind
Here are no souls
Just delusion of the mind

Instincts of hunger
No tears of mercy
Blood in theyr eyes
Fresh flesh cryes

Smoke on earth
Cold froze hearts
Giants fell
But not insects
Especially cockroaches, they are still alive

So here is no the end
Evil reborn
It's got new flesh
Blood became warm
Hands got swords
Explosions of megatons
Steel squashes live meats
Existence became not so sweet

History tends recur
We are approeaching the new end
That will heal the planet from parasites
From midget gods on the earth

Behold the new end is here!
