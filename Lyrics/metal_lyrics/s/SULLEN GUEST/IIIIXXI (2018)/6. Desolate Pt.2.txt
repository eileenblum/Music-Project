Full moon
Swamp of doom
She's hanged
Silence in the room

She has gone
Did not wait

Another Fall
She was true to black
Sullen for all
Fed up by humans crap

Candles of faith
Scent of wreath

Another funeral
Long dark hall
Coffin glides slow
Just ghouls glow

In silence... I see her
In silence... Why she smiles?
In silence... May she waits?
In silence... We dream on

Nails tear troat
My soul growls

I dig one more pit
Like zillions of them on the mother earth
That hides all remains
Of love and pain

Just sleep
Sink into my dream
Come and find me
In the garden of Eden

In silence... I watch you
In silence... Please don'wail
In silence... Touch my cold skin
In silence... Gimme last kiss
