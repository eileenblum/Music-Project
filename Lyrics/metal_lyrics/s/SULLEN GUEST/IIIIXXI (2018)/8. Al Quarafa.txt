My brain remembers the collor of green fields
Taste of oxygene
Sand between teeth and dust in my eyes
That's what I feel
Thirst and pain
Sorrow of deprivation
My soul is so ill
All skulls look the same
I try to forger the shame, but I could not kill myself
Am I insane?

Wasteland
It feels that we live here forever
Wasteland
Hell is so common
Ruins and sand

What was destroyed would never rise again

Stench and cold leak through veins till my heart
Parasites know where the blood is

The globe, our tiny home
"sanctuary of cloud cuckoo land"
Given us by Lord
Finally was swallowed by morbid greedliness
And shited out

What was destroyed would never rise again

New world of desert
Borderless of hunger
Feel free to wander
Along with grim reaper
Search for the meaning of anger and dye

Cemeteries, cold caves, graves - saves your bones
Are you live or dead, vultures will find you

The globe, our tiny home
"sanctuary of cloud cuckoo land"
Given us by Lord
Finally was swallowed by morbid greedliness
And shited out

How to understand this nightmare for real?
Where children are dissecting for healing
Where hearts are deprived for feelings
Monsters are created for killing

Maybe thats are just scary dreams?
Where king is dying like a pig
Maybe it is just subconscious disease?
And we are all so mentally sick.
