I have exhumed her skull from the dark
My dear beauty, drowned in blood.

You are still smiling even though scars are so deep
To eternal inanity our souls creep.

Even if it is so cold from your being now
Teeth shine like pearls in dusk through rot
Your bony fingers didn't loose that silver cross
The simbol of painful being under heaven's fog

In those bottomless black gaps I see
Where happy eyes must be
I sink unwillingly in that eternity
And kissing you, please, give me your disease

Let's dance, forget that grief from the past
I cry by holding your fragile remains
I spin and lift you to the sun, we'll burn away fast
Now your are forever mine

It is all illusion, I understand, I am not insane
I know you are somewhere beyond

I wish, I beg that you would wait for me
And then the time will stop, it'll freeze forever

When we will meet again
We will join each other in hell
It's hell
Real hell
Forever
