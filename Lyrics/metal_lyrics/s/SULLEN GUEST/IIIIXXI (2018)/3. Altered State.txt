Between the East and West
In the deep forest where pagan Gods slumb
Woods under snow rest
Do not wait for Sullen guests

World was weak, sick
Earthlings were tired, ill
Stench of sulphur from prior hell does not dissipate yet
Perfect time to sow evil seed to wounded field
Routine season of Global bloodbath, behold began again

For those who was born at a wrong place and time
There opened Purgatory gates
Motherland becomes hell on earth
Satanâs servants play its evil games
In between of truth and lie
Where tracks for Deathâs train were laid

Just one way, without escape
Without an option to rewind the time

Day by day living dead live their usual lives here
Rising fumes mean that some of them are already free
âARBEIT MACHT FREIâ
Cerberus does their jobs so well
Long row of unfortunates go through Zyclon B to flame

Inscets bites let you know that you are not dead yet
Dirty rats are out to steal your last bread
If your neighbour is already cold
You will get his meal and wardrobe

And that's the moment when the gates of Hell opened
Maybe the Gods of forest heard your prayers and choked
Finally you could run if you could, but where...
When snow and cold wait for you without remorse
Ask for a bullet,
Ask for a bullet,
It could help you
To escape
How clever you could be
You could not reveal the meaning of life here!
