Today or never
To choose from two different ways
Hard to tread
But demons persuade

Swiss steel made in mind to heal
Penetrates deep to inner realm

Decision to kill
To cut life before...
What heart could feel
When flesh for you is just divine whore

In educated hands
With sterile gloves
Small cold claws
Under dino lights...

Thunder growls
In serene sky
River of blood flows
Outside peaceful life goes

Foetus is already dead
You could see its crushed head
Emptiness you have got instead
Is graveyard somewhere near?
