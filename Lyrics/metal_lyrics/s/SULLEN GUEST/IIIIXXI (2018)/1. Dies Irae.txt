You think you will live forever
In your little, perfect world?

Love for your life will become hatered,
Earth will burn, when Judgement Day comes.

There will be no exception
For all life on the Earth
Mysterious symbols are becoming
Clearear and threatening.

Dies Irae dawns

Your empty talks and your shiny trash
Will have no value anymore

You will have to accept your destiny
Smiles will get erased, fear will emerge

Dies Irae dawns

Your are searching for a speak of light,
Peace of mind or signs of hope...
Little wish to escape to somewhere, to be gone
But your flesh is engaged, belongs here, where...

Oh mystery!
Obscurity devours our lives
Screaming voices will rob you of your mind,
But still you will understand
That you only have several seconds until the End

Your only friends will be:

MORBUS, CURA, TIMOR, DAMNUM,
DOLOR, TEDIUM, ODIUM, MORTEM!
