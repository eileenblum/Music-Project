Countless times we have been beaten, we have fallen to our knees.
Having everything we build turn to dust in our own hands.
Grasping at the shards, trying to pull it back together.
But it's not meant to be and it will never be again.

Our only choice left is to embrace our pain and use it to stand back up.
For once you no longer fear death, can you choose to live.

Cold ashes on frozen ground
I see the rain coming for me again
Looming over the horizon
I will stand here waiting for the end

You got up and started again, but you will fail and you will fall again.
Time and time again with only one end in sight.
You can remain motionless, or you can choose to walk or run.
One thing is certain that whatever you choose it will still draw nearer.

So choose, choose now, before the choice is made for you.
And when your time comes, will you greet the sullen guest as an old friend?

Cold ashes on frozen ground
I see the rain coming for me again
Looming over the horizon
I will stand here waiting for the end
