Empty hallways
Shattered glass
Silver rivers
Running past

Damn the gods, forget my name,
Take back each and every blessing made
Bestow upon me
The curse of the abyss
So I may find eternal peace
Damn the gods, forget my name,
Take back each and every blessing made

Into darkness I ascend
Seeking closure for myself

Frozen winds, carry my fate,
Bring back my remorse for life betrayed
Bestow upon me
The curse of the abyss
So I may find eternal peace

Into darkness I ascend
Seeking closure for myself

And the shapes in the mirror
Twisting, turning, getting clearer

And my fears from within
Taking form to be seen
Of a demon in my name
Of a demon in my name

Empty hallways
Shattered glass
Silver rivers
Running past
