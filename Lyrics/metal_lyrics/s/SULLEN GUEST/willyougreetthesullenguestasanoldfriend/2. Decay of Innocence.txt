Let your innocence decay

You will obey
And you will suffer
You will obey
And you will suffer
You will obey
And you will suffer

You can't deny
And you can't resist
You can't deny
And you can't resist
You can't deny
And you can't resist

Let your innocence decay

I still sleep with my eyes open
Hoping to catch a glimpse of you
I still wait in the cold night

Envisioning you
And if the night is over
Before I get to see you
I will remain in this place
'Til time takes me

Thoughts suffocating my life
With dreams of you
With dreams
That will never die

So take my hand
Let me show you the dark
Take my steps
Follow me beyond

You will obey
You will obey
You will obey
And you will suffer

Let your innocence decay
