Walking the streets of nowhere
A stroll in the dark alone
Unwilling to be seen
Unlikely to be known

If making the problem visible
Then urging for a solution
What's dwelled in the dark
Might not be meant to see

Those eyes - watching, disturbing
Demise - of one's free will
Disguised - crawling, searching
Whats not seen, can't exist
Bereaved in denial

A chosen path of existence
Is it, or is it not?
A grudging admission
A reminiscence so distant

If making the problem visible
Then urging for a solution
Whats dwelled in the dark
Might not be meant to see

Those eyes - watching, disturbing
Demise - of one's free will
Disguised - crawling, searching
Whats not seen, can't exist
Bereaved in denial

Slating the needs of man
Craving for so much less
Inner peace and the sweet relief
Is laying close at hand

If making the problem visible
Then urging for a solution
What's dwelled in the dark
Might not be meant to see

Those eyes - watching, disturbing
Demise - of one's free will
Disguised - crawling, searching
Whats not seen, can't exist
Bereaved in denial
