Whatever happened to you
Both body and mind
Carried away by ignorance
A soul going colder day by day

There is nothing left
But agony and deceit
And bitterness so sweet
Deceiving your dreams

It's a predictable end
Going out of control
Act alone
The transgressor within
Is now your guide
You drift away

Reigning in silent words
Speaking words not meant to hear
Building fences high and strong
Creating a world of your own

There is nothing left
But agony and deceit
And bitterness so sweet
Deceiving your dreams

It's an unavoidable end
Going out of control
Act alone
The transgressor within
Is now your guide
You drift away
Seeking no answers at all
The decision is already made
Follow just follow
The transgressor within

Follow, just follow
A need to give is growing stronger
Taking over even more, day by day
Soon there will be no more regrets
Feeding itself from the core
Infesting and moulding
To be the only option available
No more second chances
Act alone

Senses fluctuating again
Telling you things that you can't handle
Lashing out, tearing down
It's useless to resist anymore

There is nothing left
But agony and deceit
And bitterness so sweet
Deceiving your dreams

It's a predictable end
Going out of control
Act alone
The transgressor within
Is now your guide
You drift away
