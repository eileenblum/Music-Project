A glimpse over this field of sorrow
It's more than meets the eye
But in the eye of the beholder
It's telling secrets and a lie
There is no room for mistakes
Tresspassing to the point of no return
Voices from within
Are my only witnesses to this madness

The truth is hard to see here
As I am twisting your minds
If I fall
I'm taking it with me down
Esoteric remains

All eyes on me
The logic beats the word
Awaiting to see
Endurance beats the restless
I'll never give in
It would mean an impossible ending
The breakdown of me
Must never occur
Must never occur

A vague premonition
That is all there is
Escalating to a nightmare
But here's nothing to see...

A vague premonition
That is all there is
Escalating into a nightmare
But here's still nothing to see

I'm giving you nothing instead of something
Or was there anything I forgot?
Hesitation is never an option
Then in a second it's all over...

The truth is hard to see here
As I am twisting your minds
When I fall
I'm taking it with me down
Esoteric remains
