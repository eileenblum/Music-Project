The experimental lust
Should have been the warning itself
Instead it quenched the thirst
And the life of the ignorant

Unrestrained is the pain
What can't be seen can still be felt
And erase everything
No one is safe...
No one is safe...
Sent to a certain death
Without knowing at all
Just do as you are told now
And let us handle the aftermath
Rely on us

Devastation

The ruins are standing cold and dark
Here in the land of the wolves
As mankind suffers the punishment
They will outlast us all

Another number for the statistics
Another soul burnt to ashes
Whatever you say cannot persuade us
The facts are well hidden and denied
They will never see daylight again
Locked in and the key is thrown away
Buried in the ground
So poisoned

Denial

Boundaries bound to be broken
Promises, a failure of man spoken

A once so flourishing society laid to waste
Unleash the plague and see them scatter
See them suffer and die

A disastrous decision
At the cost of everything
The source is shut down
The bleeding has stopped
But you'll never know

Transparent

The ruins are standing cold and dark
Here in the land of the wolves
As mankind suffers the punishment
They will outlast us all

The ruins are standing cold and dark
They will outlast us all
Mankind suffers the punishment
The lesson is ours to learn
