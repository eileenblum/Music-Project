[Music: Hanner/Edlund; Lyrics: Hallin]

Lifeless symphonies playing on the last refrain
So malignant and cold
This is music for the dead
and the primitive chords,
embraces me like a cold winter storm
A symphony of destruction, a hymn for hate
Realizing that feelings comes from within,
oh your hatred spirit!
Run through my veins

[Chorus:]
Come to me
Breed through me
Live through me 
Bleed for me 
Die for me 

The music is about to end, and so is my pain
The hate is running faster inside my skin.
The veins are broken. The hatred is released
Chaos and frustration inside of me

[Chorus]
