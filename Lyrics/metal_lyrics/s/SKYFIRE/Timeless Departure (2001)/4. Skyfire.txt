[Music: Edlund/Hanner; Lyrics: Bjork]

A tale long forgotten, fallen into oblivion
Man's reality and dreams was erased,
on this great day of wrath
Mortal man, no one can save you now
Not even your pathetic gods
The day man feared is soon to arrive
Chaos was to rule these lands
All hope was gone and fear was born
Fear for the day of destruction

[Chorus:]
Great thunder roared the heavens,
as if the sky was on fire
Majestic lightning and neverending rain
Mother Earth has lost her control

This is the final story
To be told from this earth
The rest is silence
