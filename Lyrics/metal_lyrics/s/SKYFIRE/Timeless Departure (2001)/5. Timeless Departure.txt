[Music: Edlund/Hanner; Lyrics: Bjork]

This time there is no turning back
Like dust in the wind I will wither away
Deep down I feel this is the only solution
As I face my haunting destiny
I no longer feel the pain I once did
My feelings are different than before
I see everything in black and white
But you are still by my side
Am I to blame, or is it someone else
Emerging from everything that is filled with life
Forced to live here on this planet
But we have a choice between life and death
Not able to comprehend my inner self
One part of me is still not ready to let go
Emotionless I strive towards the silent end
Will I reach it this time?

[Chorus:]
Preparing for my final departure
As I behold the crescent moon
I am still in control of my life
As I make my timeless departure
