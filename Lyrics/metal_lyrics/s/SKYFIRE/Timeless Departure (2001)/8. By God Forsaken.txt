[Music: Hanner/Edlund; Lyrics: Hanner]

Face the truth, the truth that we live in
This life is losing its burning flame
I cannot feel, no longer deny it
We are this world's forsaken...breed!
My God, is heaven upon me?
We've spent a lifetime in this deep, cold, daze
One life, one man, this is our God's sacrifice

[Chorus:]
Look at my life
What do you see?
Where is the light, that used to be?
Can't you see what you're doing to me?
My soul is fading away

Spread your wings, and fly away
From this, prodigal world
Have no fear, you child of mine,
You'll see, your time will come
