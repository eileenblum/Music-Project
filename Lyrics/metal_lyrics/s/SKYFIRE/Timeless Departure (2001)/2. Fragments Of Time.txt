[Music: Hanner/Reinholdz; Lyrics: Hanner/Bjork]

Time is our master and only time can tell
If the prophecy will be fulfilled
Travel by night and fear the day
Here the legend begins
When aggression meets chaos destruction begins
It's a battle you just have to win
The spell is not broken, the battle is not won
This ancient foretold story has begun

[Chorus:]
Fragments of time creating unholy patterns
As reality fades life is moving backwards

Follow the path you believe in
Continue to fight until victory is here
Join us in celebration
Your land is lost and shall forever be
