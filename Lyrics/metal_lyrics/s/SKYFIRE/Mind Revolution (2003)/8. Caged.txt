[Music: Hanner / Lyrics Wenngrenn]

The silence ends with a thunderclap
The sky turns black again
A roar from the sky
Makes the silence feel so wonderful
My eyes are open again
I can't see more than unclear (shadows)
Shadows that seem to follow my path
Lightning burn my eyes

A slumber, a silent and deeper sleep
The smell of rain
Burned by the lightning within
Unknown is this pain

The clouds lie silent like a cage
around what used to be
I can not reach the other side and
you can not reach me
The clouds lie silence like a cage
around what used to be
Stuck within this cube for all time,
from this place I can not flee

The whispers make me insane
I can not shut them out
No longer in control of my body
I close my eyes, dreams emerge
A new thunderclap awakens my mind
It is all like it used to be
I am trapped within my own imagination
Who has got the key to the gate?

A slumber, a silent and deeper sleep
The smell of rain
Burned by the lightning within
Unknown is this pain

The clouds lie silent like a cage
around what used to be
I can not reach the other side and
you can not reach me
The clouds lie silence like a cage
around what used to be
Stuck within this cube for all time,
from this place I can not flee

Slowly the clouds loosen their grip
I can see the other side
My dream end as many times before
Alone I stand again...

A slumber, a silent and deeper sleep
The smell of rain
Burned by the lightning within
Unknown is this pain

The clouds lie silent like a cage
around what used to be
I can not reach the other side and
you can not reach me
The clouds lie silence like a cage
around what used to be
Stuck within this cube for all time,
from this place I can not flee
