[Music: Hanner / Lyrics: Wenngrenn]

A euphoria, you live in a dream
Wake up and smell reality's flower

Unwanted emotions stuck like a
thick layer of glue; weakness
It will break you down, make you
blind, in a way never
experience before

Trying desperately to get this
feeling out of my mind
But every time I try it's just like
"something's dragging you back"
Believe me
Release me from this evil spell
so I can be whole again

Unwanted emotions stuck like a
thick layer of glue; weakness
It will break you down, make you
blind, in a way never
experienced before
Before and after, hatred toward the lie
You live in euphoria

Trying desperately to get this
feeling out of my mind
But every time I try it's just like
"something's dragging you back"
Believe me
Release me from this evil spell
so I can be whole again

Indifferent to what you speak of
Your words have already been spoken

Blinded and unaware of the truth
No own way of thinking left
Filtrated emotions, where is your true spirit?
You have not lived this life

Trying desperately to get this
feeling out of my mind
But every time I try it's just like
"something's dragging you back"
Believe me
Release me from this evil spell
so I can be whole again
