[Music: Edlund / Lyrics: Wenngrenn]

Where is the sun? I hope it's gone
Only rain makes my world fade to grey
Slowly marching to a future unknown
I glance on what was, did I evolve to fast?

You can not reach me
You are lost in your own lies
I want to penetrate your soul
Is there anything that's dead in what is alive?

You spoke the lie, I lived your lie
Unaware of what was to come
A silent whisper, my final call
Slowly marching... towards

The death, such a relief
Uncloud the sky for me
Violins playing at my funeral
Will you remember me after all?

Memories left on earth and in mind
Will we ever understand what is inside?
A new hope, is this true?
Never mind the voices, I go my own way...

You can not reach me
You are lost in your own lies
I want to penetrate your soul
Is there anything that's dead in what is alive?

You spoke the lie, I lived your lie
Unaware of what was to come
A silent whisper, my final call
Slowly marching... towards

The death, such a relief
Uncloud the sky for me
Violins playing at my funeral
Will you remember me after all?

The death, such a relief
Uncloud the sky for me
Violins playing at my funeral
Will you remember me after all?
