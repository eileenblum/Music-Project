[Music: Edlund/Hanner / Lyrics: Sjogren]

Nowhere to go, I'm drifting off
I once was told to trust
In nothing but the eternal heights
And the stars are calling my name

Falling through skies of a new dawn
Nothing can ever change what I've become
I used to be the one in life
Seeking challenges and distant paths

Still, shadows haunting me
In fragments of what used to be
The illusion slips from my hand
As I arrive in newborn land

Heaven is blackened by clouds
Like a Masquerade with the stars
But an aura of starlit energy
Unmasks the biggest lie of all

Before my dusk the image fades
The sky is bound to fall
Nevermore shall I return
The mindless thought is gone

Thunder and rain keeps us from sanity
This journey will never end
Denied by our human vanity
Unclad by the revolutionary mind

Still, shadows haunting me
In fragments of what used to be
The illusion slips from my hand
As I arrive in newborn land
