[Music: Edlund/Hanner / Lyrics: Wenngrenn]

One thousand questions searching answers
A silent laughter from the other side
I am trying to master the madman in my mind

I must remain calm, wear my mask
Where are the walls that I built?
No, this isn't my fault, I shall feel no guilt

Phrases colliding from different directions
A vortex of words inside my mind
My deepest thoughts, I try to hide

My life is passing by again
All my experience as images
You can not see what is inside
You can't understand what haunts my mind

A new beginning, a new end
I will never learn how to fly
Pictures of the past, passing by

A white lie written on lips
A path not meant for me
You can not see what is inside
You can't understand what haunts my mind

A silent end, a lost soul
Carrying more than he can bear
A lost soul at his silent end
The dreams inside he fears

A silent end, a lost soul
Carrying more than he can bear
A lost soul at his silent end
The dreams inside he fears

Lies...
Guilt...

A silent end, a lost soul
Carrying more than he can bear
A lost soul at his silent end
The dreams inside he fears

A silent end, a lost soul
Carrying more than he can bear
A lost soul at his silent end
The dreams inside he fears
