[Music: Edlund/Hanner / Lyrics: Wenngrenn]

Double-barreled in your opinion
Trying to be one you never will be
Hiding your true face behind a mask
And you think you will gain respect?

Indifferent to what you give
Indifferent to what we receive
The strength is in myself
Loneliness is no decease

A wall around my precious castle
Nevermore an open book, become a labyrinth

I won't open the gate again
No one shall enter: nightmare
I am staying the way I am
Disgusted by your feeble attempts
to come inside

Indifferent to what you give
Indifferent to what we receive
The strength is in myself
Lonliness is no decease

A wall around my precious castle
Nevermore an open book, become a labyrinth
Pleased with my dream
I won't let it fall apart
