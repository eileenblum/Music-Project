[Music: Edlund/Hanner / Lyrics: Sjogren]

The eternal breath is calling
Ever to be sanctified
There's nothing like the pain
And the hollow sound of silence

The time has come
To tell the tale of a thousand years
The time is now
To whisper the ancient secret

Yesterday, filled with hubris
Now I met my superior soul
The wrath of all forgotten
Twisting my body, bending my mind

Nothing is what it used to be
From an emptiness divine
Once lost in the immense void
Now a molten core deep within

The speed of light, the sounds so clear
Stone cold, as I touch your withered face
Oblivious to the nature
You give hail to the higher ones

Mind the revolution
Revelation in my mind
This is the only solution
When all is left behind

The way things are, the way things were
There is no trust in telling lies
This time we won't look back
Till we reach our final destination

This is the great disaster
Crawling from beneath
Mournful, the final words are spoken
Without life I must remain

The truth lies for me open
Struck by the ricochet
Damned by the world going faster
This is the great disaster

Evolution complete
The choice is made.
Racing for perfection and superior forms.

Some things were meant to be
The fact is so clear
Nothing lies before us
It's all so vague

The source we all descend from, always obsolete
Turning from instincts and inner peace

The way we were, we still can't focus
Tomorrow brings us one step closer to our fate

The speed of light, the sounds so clear
Stone cold, as I touch your withered face
Oblivious to the nature
You give hail to the higher ones

Mind the revolution
Revelation in my mind
This is the only solution
When all is left behind

Once again we all will see
Destruction and shattered harmony
But in the end it's all so clear
Another time is near
