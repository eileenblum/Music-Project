[Music: Edlund/Hanner/Jonsson / Lyrics: Sjogren]

Reach out and talk to me
We're heading towards unexplored lands
Never to look back
At this world of deceit

Searching for an answer
When freedom is forever gone
We will bring back life
To the lands of despair

All alone
True in soul
The world arises from the call
Chaotic spirits
In control
The life you knew is soon to fall

Where is your god, once above all
You cannot trust him anymore
Fools of the living
living a lie of the dead

Wasted lives and endless pain
Falling reigns is what I see
Earth will tremble and remain
Sharing thoughts when all is free

Mindless patterns, shapes of insanity
Leading your way
Self destruction and genocide
Thoughts beyond control

Searching for an answer
When freedom is forever gone
We will bring back life
To the lands of despair

All alone
True in soul
The world arises from the call
Chaotic spirits
In control
The life you knew is soon to fall

Reach out and talk to me
We're heading towards unexplored lands
Never to look back
At this world of deceit

Searching for an answer
When freedom is forever gone
We will bring back life
To the lands of despair

All alone
True in soul
The world arises from the call
Chaotic spirits
In control
The life you knew is soon to fall
