[Music: Hanner / Lyrics: Sjogren]

I've conquered my mind, wait for my soul
Silence is all, there's no hope, lost all control
Twilight has come, the ultimate nightmare is here
Inherit the dark side of life, the hunted is near

Nowhere to run, no where to dwell
Once struck by the furious pain.
This can't be real!

The dark side
Has taken over me
I feel the beast inside me come to life
As I leave the human soul

Frightened by shadows, fiends from within

The gloomy eyes I see, caused by the never ending sin
So cold the night, burning sensations are coming through
A new dawn will break, hope will arrive but nightfall too

Can't see the light, a shelter of emptiness
Awakened by powers buried deep inside of me!

I wake up in anguish...cold sweat and shattered thoughts

Nowhere to run, nowhere to dwell,
Once struck by the furious pain.
This can't be real!

The dark side
Has taken over me
I feel the beast inside me come to life
As I leave the human soul
