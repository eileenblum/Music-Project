Behold here lies the godless world
of defiance as fragile walls
These shallow ties of blood are
already destined by time

Unfold the endless wave of
decadence as light disappears
Commence the final countdown
to this damnation game
Clear your mind tell me what's real
The answer you find is always
coloured by your belief

Unsloved is the question of
guilt and innocence as chaos rise
Historic acts of boredom
can't be undone

Believer now choose your fate
Illusions from the past have made
the outcome reversed
Believer now enter the gate
Meet with the darks side or
forever be cursed

So you mortal soul the choice
you make is yours
The storm is coming and nothing
can change its course

Behold here lies the godless world
of defiance as fragile walls
These shallow ties of blood are
already destined by time
