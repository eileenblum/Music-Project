Headless and complex through
stars and above
The witness of time is forever lost
A culture of wisdom, an era of pain
Focus beyond the body and soul

Expendable will be forgotten
By the forgotten and the mad
Perpetual rivals in this war
Principality of destruction

Evil and mindless
The broken ones stand tall
Defected by infest
The forceful time must fall

This spectral divinity
Burning through time and space
Trapped by the unholy trinity
This is a dead man's race

Empty eyes behold what is left
Empty eyes in the fall of mankind
Watching, hollow and fading
Drowning in a man's hypocrisy

Staring into the void
Wishing for an astral breakthrough

But no one is to be found
In the world of forlorn

Darkness whelming us
Darkened by the spectral mist
Another bound infinity
Bound to unspoken lies

Evil and mindless
The broken ones stand tall
Defected by infest
The forceful time must fall
