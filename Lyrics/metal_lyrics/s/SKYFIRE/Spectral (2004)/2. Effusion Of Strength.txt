When you infuse that feeling of guilt
Claim your authorship of the world
A brightened orchard of truth
To burn your trenchant eyes

Your supremacy breaks down
You rattle on the floor
Giving you what you deserve
But still you wish for more

My cordless connection to your spine
Rewind all visuals but keep the sound
Every little twitch of my fingers
Pulsates in each piece of your mind

Fragile emperor battered down
Floating in the void of lost thoughts
Bitterly you sting spears into me
But Merely rash my face

Gone in a wormhole and no one
Knew your name
