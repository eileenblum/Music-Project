Frustrated by the pace
that kills creativity
The evil within gives
anguish to the outside
Creating chaos that is
canalized on to others
Through time and space,
day and night
The darkness grows stronger,
suffocates the life

Slow down, analyze your thoughts
Act now, before you get caught
Slow down, analyze your thoughts
Act now, before you get caught

Wake up with a sense filled with pictures
It's hard for you to choose your path
Everything is a maze, a burden
that you have to bear
It's time to hunt for what is missing

Slow down, analyze your thoughts
Act now, before you get caught
Slow down, analyze your thoughts
Act now, before you get caught

Total darkness with blinders
before your eyes
You are sprayed the trouble to
see the misery
The sense of knowing that
something is wrong
Appears in every decision
you make

Caged by the grasp
that your subconscious has
taken on your sense
Echoing teasing laughters
that make you feel singled
out and hunted

Hard to find tranquillity
enough to fall asleep
Everything stands in
your way in the
path that you've choosed
Frustration about the time
that is lost
Your inner self becomes
a hell that spreads to the outside
