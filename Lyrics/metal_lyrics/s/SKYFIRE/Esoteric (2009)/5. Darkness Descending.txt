Questions remain unanswered
The will to prevail grows stronger
To now know becomes a failure
Proceeding with blindfolded eyes it seems

Impossible to break through
Decisions made to shatter this heaven
Reluctantly it's made so clear
That it's never meant

To come in from another side
To have a lock from another angle
Showing the signs of a great disaster
But who will master

The perception of life...
Reduced the further we go

Witness another fall
Indecision abundant
Darkness descending
A disease neverending
Scars burnt unto our skin

Cover it all within
Facing the facts in denial
Lost to the creation of time
As allegiance is sworn

The inconvenience (upon)
Is taking its toll

Travel through excess
An evocative ride between evident fears

Coming in from another side
Having a lock from another angle
Contemplating the great disaster
That no one will master

The timeline has come to an end
Replace and proceed

Witness another fall
Indecision abundant
Darkness descending
A disease neverending
Scars burnt unto our skin
This is another fall
Indecision abundant
Darkness descending
A disease neverending
Scars are one with our skin

One with our skin
