The world moved out of my mind
I made it fiction
When I should have given it time
But still there was no caution
Acting like someone else

Restraining the bitterness
The ironwall won't give in easily
Emptiness, caught while burning
Solitude, live by learning

Bargain for more
With every step further
Withdraw from sanity
And make friend with misery
As the last ditch in this mystery

Realizing the extent
Watching destruction with grief
It will never be the same again
So where is the relief?
Where is the end?
