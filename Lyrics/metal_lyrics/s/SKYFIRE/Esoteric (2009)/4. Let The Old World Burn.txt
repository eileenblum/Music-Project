Embrace the darkness
As the night appears
A time I no longer fear
I inhale the cold air and feel how it's soothing my soul one last time

Banned from this world of silence
Now lost to the world below
Don't utter a word
Just go
Go

Nevermore shall we return
Me, myself and I
It's time to let the old world burn
It's time to let go of control

At this point there is nothing holding us back
Listen to the voice within
Close your eyes and let go
Feed the flames and watch them grow

Banned from this world of silence
Now lost to the world within
Don't utter a word
Just go
Go

What is there to mourn?
The effort was a waste
Don't try to comprehend
Answers there are none
Answers there are none

Exemption awaits
As the ending scene is closing in
Go now
And forever be gone
A masterpiece of failure
Your work here is done
