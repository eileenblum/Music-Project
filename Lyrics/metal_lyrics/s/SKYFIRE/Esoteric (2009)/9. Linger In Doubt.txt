Everything can lose its meaning
Sometimes there is a reason why

Words on the screen...
Those words on the screen
Revealing something and still
Telling nothing
One sentence after another
Searching for you

Something is wrong here, somebody must know
Too torn inside to see it with non judging eyes
Feed us more with these words on the screen
What do we do?

Where do we go?
When answers run out
Left alone
Linger in doubt
Nothing seems to make sense anymore
You disconnect from reality

Searching just to find another way
To explain how and when, where and why
Do you deny?
The words on the screen tell something different
Do you chose to believe?

When answers run out
Left alone
Linger in doubt
Nothing seems to make sense anymore
You disconnect from reality

Silence is broken again
Awakening the monster inside

An indication got hold of you
It was seducing your mind
The first level is now clear
But lies got you nowhere

Left alone
Linger in doubt
Nothing seems to make sense anymore
You disconnect from reality

When answers run out
Left alone
Linger in doubt
Nothing seems to make sense anymore
You disconnect from reality
