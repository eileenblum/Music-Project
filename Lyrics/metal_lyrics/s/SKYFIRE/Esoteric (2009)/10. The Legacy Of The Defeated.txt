So much in vain you might think
When it's over everything is lost
Too late to negotiate
Accept or regret it
What once was so cold
Is melting and vanishing

The grand scheme has failed
And the wrath has only begun
Fierce and aggressive
It's piercing through

Who will remember?
The legacy of the defeated
In the long run
It's collecting years in the dust

Overwhelmed by the massive appearance
A breathtaking setback
Over and over
The last scene repeats
Caught barehanded
And disarmed by reality

Emptiness
Silence
What is left
Emptiness
And silence
Is what is left
Images slowly fading

Truth detected
By others neglected
It's like a virus spreading inside
Eating itself out
What's written in blood
Is worth nothing when it's forgotten
