Alternate reality
Digging deeper and deeper
Construct emptiness
Out of nothingness
And erase the compassion
Fragments in time
Moments irreplaceable
What's yet to be found
Surrenders to the ignorant

In order to be free
The mind is set to believe

Under a pitch black sky
Where the light is all so absent
With despair in sight
A growing form of indifference

In broad daylight
Zombie-like we walk
Seconds in a decade
Is giving life to the lifeless
It's inside, it fails
The diversion is relocating
And taking a new form
Claiming for even more

Construct emptiness
Out of nothing
And erase the compassion
It's inside, it fails
The diversion is relocating
And taking a new form
Claiming for more...
Even more

The skyline is fading
Surroundings are lost
It is a distorted vision
Addicted to those who proceed
