Born out of clouds of stardust
The cosmic void markes my grave
Homewards to eternity...
My visions are carved in stone
And planets retain my pride
Dissolved into the galaxy...

A dream from a shadow of smoke
Formed a fragile being
Mind shall fade and dust remains
The cosmic heart unveiling

Lords of terrestrial domains
Shall vanish as frail thrones fade
Nothing shall remain...
My struggling emotions return
To the place where time is born
The stars shall drown my pain...

Through spectres of time to horizons of space
At the utter eternity's ground you will gaze
Millions of splinters shall melt into one
Borders unite, all structures are gone

Trapped in a room without walls you have been
The Veil of Maya, deceptive and mean
Now that a thousand stars twinkle in your eyes
Mediocrity fades, let infinity rise!
