I am reborn from my demise
In astral spheres and unknown skies
My soul is wandering aimlessly
No calming influence in me

I am behind the shores of time
Where day is night and all entwines
A flickering of eternal flames
In distant spheres lost powers tames

Strange visions in groundless void
Bring forth an image of entirety
Silent forces have gained control
It is all within, the gate to infinity
