In the dephts of infinity
Invisible, the shadowgate
Of dark matter is the key
To reveal the ancient's fate

Frozen tears on marble ground
Atmospheres reflecting darkened void
Sunlight gone to utter black
I am one with this desert of frost

Stars drown when aeons have passed
Falling down to the everlast
Time bleeds and tears will remain
Death needs to end my pain

The final singularity
Time and space are heading to one
An heir of cosmic legacy
Is ready to be gone

The absolute zero point
A statue of the universe
I am lord of creation
Paralyzed in permafrost
