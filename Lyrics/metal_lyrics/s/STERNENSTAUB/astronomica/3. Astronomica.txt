"Ancient Alexandria, site of cumulative knowledge, cradle of enlightenment
Levelled to the ground by the children of the crucified one,
Wiped away in blindness..."

The library, I have seen its shade
Wittnessed how dignity and wisdom did fade

Ignorance! The flames of arrogance...
An act of indifference towards what was in our hands
And turned to dust

Look to the stars, the mirror of the past
Now you seek to learn what in those flames did burn

The cosmic secrets will be revealed to me
The pyramides donate their knowledge of eternity
At astronomical dimensions I have glanced
We will regain it when mankind has advanced
