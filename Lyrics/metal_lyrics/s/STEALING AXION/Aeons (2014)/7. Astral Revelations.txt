Silence encumbers me like the smell after the rain. Darkness is all I see. All I feel is pain. I'm waiting for life to show itself. I'm waiting for time to pass. I'm sick of this lifeless prison cell. I'm sick of this timeless mass. Closer, drift towards the light. No way out... No way to fight. Desolate, impeding light. This vision has stole my sight. Empty hearts and empty souls. Precious life, just burning coals. Is this all I have to show for a life I've never known? Closer, drift towards the light. No way out... no way to fight. Desolate, impeding light. This vision has stole my sight.
