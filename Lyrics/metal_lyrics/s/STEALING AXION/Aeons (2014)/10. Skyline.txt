(Reflects off my eyes) Tragic nightmares so familiar. Endless taunting, cries from nowhere. (A place I recognize) Pain that led to chaos, hear the masses crying out for help. Losing my life. Burning skyline blinding. (Reflects off my eyes) Through the window I see clearly. In the window, I see me. And out of the darkness of my mind, I've uncovered the things I hoped I'd never find. A mystery solved, I don't want to accept my death. I know I'm being punished. Losing my life. Burning skyline bleeding me. By my hand, I wiped away humanity willfully. I scarred their faces. I drank their blood and left them bleeding. I stole their lives. I cleansed the Earth. I tore this whole thing down. Lies, I've been living all this time. I'm tired of forgetting... all my life... all this time (and I rise). Rise. Rise from the ocean. Conceal my screams. Lost in the motion. Dying silent.
