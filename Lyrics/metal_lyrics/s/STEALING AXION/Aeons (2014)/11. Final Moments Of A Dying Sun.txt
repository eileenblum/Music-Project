A distant flicker in a silent universe. A fading glimpse of passing time expiring. Beyond all reach and forgotten in the ruin, a star dies out... and no one knows. A lonely soul, not a martyr not a savior. Now there's nothing left but time expiring. A man that's saved. On the inside I'm forgiven, and I cry out... but no one knows. Found determination. I've found the will to live. I remember what I am, and why. Gaining speed as I fall into oblivion. The destination fades to black. Expiring. Across dimensions I can feel the rift embracing. A star dies out and leaves a hole. Lost determination. I've lost the chance to live. I remember who I am, and why. Why? I changed who I was, but am I good enough to try? I learned who I am, but am I strong enough to fly?

No.
