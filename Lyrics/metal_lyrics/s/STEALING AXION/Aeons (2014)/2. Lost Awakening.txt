Rise from the ocean of my dreams. Hear my voice, it's silent. Trapped in my mind, searching endlessly for what I am inside. Isolated memories, hostage to my sanity. Free me. Lost in the motion. Living through the scenes. Rising from the ocean. Waves can't drown the screams. Light hits my eyes and reveals the solitary cell from my eyes. Death escapes. Postulated truth becomes my ignorance, I'm blind. Eluding the ideals of cognitive thought and left to die. I'm confined, awaiting the facets to build my self realization. Cast away from everything, I escaped my destiny. Existence begs for questioning. Finding what is real from what I know, truth lies in the darkness. Truth lies in the darkness. Who am I?
