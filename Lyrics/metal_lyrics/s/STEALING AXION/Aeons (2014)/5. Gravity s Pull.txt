I lied to myself. I know where I'm going to end. I'm staring ahead as it burns me. I don't know what can save us now, I know that we're falling into the sun. I wake up when I close my eyes, escaping reality. Going back is all I know, my consciousness is my nightmare. I don't know what can save me now, I know that I'm falling into the sun. I'm lost in the melancholy thought, trying to reason through. Visions keep running through my head, but something evades me always. Where did I go wrong? Now we burn ourselves to learn ourselves. Waiting for my death, reflections in my eyes. Only one hope left to live on inside me. I don't know what can save us now, I know that we're falling into the sun. I wake up when I close my eyes, escaping reality. Going back is all I know, my conciousness is my nightmare. We must learn ourselves to earn ourselves.
