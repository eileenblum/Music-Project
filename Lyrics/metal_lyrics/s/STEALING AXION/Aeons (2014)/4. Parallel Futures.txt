No sound, just everlasting pain. The flicker of eyes remain. A pale face blaming everything. Guilt maintains. A sound escapes. Calling me... It's calling for me... Ending lives are reaching for me. Calling me... They're calling for me. Reaching down, I close my eyes. I hope for death... fear subsides. And the shadows encompass all of this, and I awaken. The voices always carry. Calling me... Calling for me... Calling me... They're calling for me... In the wake, I survive everything that I try. I'm awake, millions die. Is this truth, or do I die?
