Flash before my eyes. I'm awake. I'm alive. I remember the sky. Moments left behind. Buried. Returning to who I am. Connecting everything. Everything connecting. Memories exile me. Sent away to die. Reversed dreams manifest to life. Time, the constant restraint. Pulling me closer... If only I had control. Walls contain my fate, and inside I'll find escape. Dead ends lead to nowhere. Reaching destitution. Pausing self destruction. Climbing for a future. Death becomes a clubhouse needing a new member. Sealed in the container, thrown into the embers. Tracing every thought I've had through my life. I've seen it all. Exiled, reliving everything as it was. Not as I saw. I lived a lie, and now I'm free from me. Tracing every thought I had through my life. Changed me. Awake and rethinking everything that I was. Defined my life. I saw, I lived a lie and now I'm free... from me
