Hold me down, chains that bind me, as they scream murder. What have I done? Mortified... I can't see the blood. Something seems wrong... I know their faces, they burn. They haunt me from within. In a distant dream I was set free. I wanted to save them. I can see the eyes of the children. I can feel the pain rushing back as if I was there. Nothing separates this dream from reality beyond my own confused volition. Slave to my own vision, how could it be I haven't woken up? A year passes in a second but it still feels endless. The ending with no beginning is what will destroy me. Yet I sit in silence, floating in a void... weightless... and timeless. How could it be? I haven't given up.

Searching... always come up empty. Feeling conciousness betray me.

Reaching... always touching nothing. Sleeping doesn't make it better.

Losing everything I've known. Losing everything I've been. Losing everything I've done. Come to life inside my head.

I lie awake.
