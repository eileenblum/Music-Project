Earth... it seems so far away. Uncertainty saturates my mind. Space, alone it welcomes me. Floating astray... aimlessly in time. Memory, the blinding face. Memory, a world away. Memory, a past mistake. Memory, I can't escape. Memory, a deeper place. Memory, in dreams awake. Darkness feels cold against my skin. Alive, I don't know how I came to be. I'm reaching. A single hole shows endless space, I strain to see the light. Moving on to some place unknown... unseen. Living through my faded dreams. Finding my identity. Moments... Deep inside... All of this... died... Questioning everything... Left behind... Why am I lost?
