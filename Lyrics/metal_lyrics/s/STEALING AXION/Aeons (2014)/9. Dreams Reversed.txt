Something tears the fabric of my truth. Nothing feels right (you've got to grasp what you have lost). Forcing into darkness for the answers. I've only fooled myself. Universe... Welcoming... (look past what you have known) Memories... Distancing... (so unaware) Universe... Collapsing... (look past what you have known) Memories... Reversing... If I have known my life, what are these gaps that cloud my reason and take hold of me? Where is the light? Why am I suffering?

Wake me up

So hard to take, my life is breaking. So hard to fake, my mind is waking.

Backward thought, forward thinking. Forward though, backward thinking.

Help, I don't want to believe. Finding that what I've seen is calling me, testing me, redefining everything I've been. Nothing is the same anymore, I'm a prisoner sent away from myself. Saving the fallen, they blame me. They're calling. I'm reaching for something. It's all coming from nothing I've known. Rebuild the past into something that's new. Truth is not something I've seen. Changing my mind about me. Feeling my pride die. Changing my life finally. This feeling inside lied to me.
