Bound to what I know, it's so unclear.
Waiting for the moment when everything will fall.
No one understands, and I know how I must sound.
The truth is overwhelming, but ignorance it calms me.
Who am I (Ignore it let them burn.)
to decide? (They don't believe you, let it go.)
Who Am I (Nothing can prepare them.)
to just hide? (The world we know is gone.)
Who am I?
The pressure of it all encumbers me.
My head is in my hands. I'm wishing I could forget what I know.
Who am I (Ignore it let them burn.)
to decide? (They don't believe you, let it go.)
Who Am I (Nothing can prepare them.)
to just hide? (The world we know is gone.)
Who am I?
Calculated cold conundrums can convey complex plans.
I can try to believe,
this is all meant to be.
