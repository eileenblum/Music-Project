Tell me, am I forgotten? 
lonely, so is the world. 
all these years, hiding here. 
Tell me, why are you searching. 
Running, I'm running away. 
years ago, I felt so 
cold. 
I'm cold. 

I threw it all away, 
since no one would listen, 
no home, no life, no family, 
everything was taken from me. 
Everything I said, 
they ignored every word. 
Covering up the only chance, 
for existence. they tore me 
down 

growing dark, 
eventide, 
looking back, 
deep inside, 
countless lives, 
fade to black, 
on my hands, 
can I go 
back? 

grown 
I've grown 
grown 
I've grown, 

I'm showing, The path to salvation. 
Listen, The steps won't be clear. 
all these years, hiding here. 
hiding, from those who opposed me. 
believing, that something will give. 
sacrifice, everything 

growing dark, 
eventide, 
looking back, 
deep inside, 
countless lives, 
fade to black, 
on my hands, 
can I go back?
