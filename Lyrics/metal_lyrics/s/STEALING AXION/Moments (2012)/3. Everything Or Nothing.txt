Suffering can it start with anarchy? 
Why would that be happening? result of a failing country. 
Technology cracking and degrading. 
Addiction calling. Industries will topple, breaking. 

floating away, 
escaping judgment day, 
all I want is truth, 
give me something, 
everything or nothing. 
you all think I'm bluffing 
fuck you. 

with disarray, 
the world will melt away, 
all I want is truth, 
give me something, 
everything or nothing. 
you all think I'm bluffing 
fuck you. 

Monopoly, can it end economy? 
Is that what you wanna see? people screaming money burning? 
anarchy, summoning the cavalry, 
attack civility, martial law now means nothing 

floating away, 
escaping judgment day, 
all I want is truth, 
give me something, 
everything or nothing. 
you all think I'm bluffing 
fuck you. 

with disarray, 
the world will melt away, 
all I want is truth, 
give me something, 
everything or nothing. 
you all think I'm bluffing 
fuck you. 

what I see is destiny
