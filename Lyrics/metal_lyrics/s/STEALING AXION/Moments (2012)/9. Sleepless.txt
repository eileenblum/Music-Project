A rainy summer storm. 
rejuvenates a dying ground. 
it hadn't rained for days and days and days. 
a start again where everything is found. 

they're left with memories. 
tears from pain of tragedy. 
a mourning son bereaved. 
angelic whispering. 

long after disaster. 
societies emerge. 
when information's lost, 
they turn to written word. 

I lie awake and dream of the future. 
A million people that start anew. 
Transcend the past, and hope for tomorrow. 
rebuild it all, and destroy ourselves again in time. 

outcast farther, 
relapse martyrs. 
outcast martyrs, 
relapse farther 

I lie awake and dream of the future. 
A million people that start anew. 
Transcend the past, and hope for tomorrow. 
rebuild it all, and destroy ourselves again in time. 
in time. 
in time. 
in time.
