failing, systemic poison, 
spreading,living, 
circuitry breathing, 
gears are turning, 
waking, heretic bleeding, I'm 
breaking, ruined beneath 
mass reverie. 

in reason, 
I find my way, 
no resolve, 
No meaning 

You're wearing me down, 
I've done what I can to help you, 
you're so far away, 
I don't know how long I want to wait. 

wasting, hourglass draining, 
step back there's a mask on the face of 
opportunity, open your eyes 
the illusions revealed, 
gears are turning, 
see the warning, 
see for yourself 

crazy, you're crazy 

soapbox preacher 
who believes you 
outcast martyr 
saving the world? 

break the charade 
leave us be, we're at peace

malformation [x2]

No, You're wearing me down, 
I've done what I can to help you, 
you're so far away, 
I don't know how much I can take. 

Growing away from all I've ever known 
Feeling betrayed, mocked and thrown away to die 

To die.
