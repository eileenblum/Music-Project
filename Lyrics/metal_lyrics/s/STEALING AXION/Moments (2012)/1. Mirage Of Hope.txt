listen, the end of this world is coming too fast, 
we must embrace what's going to happen learn to adapt, 
you laugh, but I guarantee someday you'll see, 
everything you know will be set free. 
I know it sounds crazy, that's what they said, 
there's proof all around the common ground, you've gotta open your head, 
you don't want you to live, you want you to die, 
so they can obtain the ultimate control over life. 

All of this, everything that's real to you, 
Nothing left, Nothing left, Nothing left at all. 

Loud, the voices of reason. 
Proud, my voice of treason. 
Now, give me something to believe in, 
People tell me that I've lost my 

Mind. 
No. 
Fuck. 
Them. 

All of this, none of this is real.
