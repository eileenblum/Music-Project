The synapses pulse 
Distorting ideas of true imitation 
Creations repulse 
Enforcing the feeling that's always impeding 
Intrepid, yet undecided 
Incoherent scrawls across this page 
We break away 
exploring surroundings, so sick of expounding 
With no delay 
We refine this process, this rhythmic abscess fails 
This infection's a perfection 
Pull away from this rejection 
Birth inside resolving the weakness 
Silence the inner demon 
Draining the thoughts away 
Crawling along the line 
Fearing the worst again 
Feigning the hope to try 
Persistent word 
Eclipses failure 
Repeating time 
Can cause the change 
But in the end, the emptiness remains 
My words start disappearing from the page 
No matter how much I try to remember 
It never comes back, I'm forced to surrender 
The mystery, this absence of memory 
There must be something out there that can aid me 
Why have I built these walls? 
This nightmare has become my downfall
