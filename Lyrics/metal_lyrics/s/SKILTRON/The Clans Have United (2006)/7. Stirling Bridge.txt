Advancing at midnight by hundreds we are,
All over the highlands we are coming down.
At morning we have almost reached the forth.
The battle is close, we already smell the blood.

At dawn we can see foot soldiers crossing.
Along the bridge, waiting to form.
A hand picked group is holding for them.
The flags got high, we charge now.

We charge now.
Over them, now.
We charge now.

Over them, now.
The bridge falls down.
Commoners against
A thousand horsemen knights.

Over them, now.
The bridge falls down.
Over them now.
We charge now.

At dawn we can see, foot soldiers crossing.
Along the bridge, waiting to form.
And a hand picked group is holding for them.
The flags got high and we charge now.

In the gateway to the north
On the bridge we have shown the rules,
To them, and now we have their flesh
Spreading around, and we will
Hang it on our necks.

On the bridge we have reached the victory
On the stirling bridge, the victory.
