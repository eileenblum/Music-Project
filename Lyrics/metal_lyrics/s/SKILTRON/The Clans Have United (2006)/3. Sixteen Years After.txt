Now itâs the time, the day has come, we canât hesitate.

We are expecting the signal, to attack, to protect,
And straight we will stand.

We remember well the once named guardian said:

Now I am here, follow me and see,
This is forever, you musnât forget
Youâll have to go on even if I die
Remember my name and keep me alive.

Sixteen years will pass before the revenge,
But when it comes it will be the day.
The day when they learn and know who we are.
We are not a rebellion, we are much more than that.
