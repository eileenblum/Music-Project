Hey! hey! we are in the forest,
To meet and join them.
Hey! hey! weâve just come here,
Ready to make a pact.

The meeting was fixed at midnight,
At the north point of the old town.
Where the sun doesnât shine in winter.
Unquenchable thirst of revenge.

The internal matter is over.
We are ready to fight.
For the present and future,
Screaming loudly we are:

Gathering the clans!
Gathering the clans!
For the present and future.
Gathering the clans!

Over thousands of endless years,
We always knew it, this belongs to us.
Itâs a pride and we feel it,
And that is the reason
Of all that we must care in life.

We live to learn how to be honest.
We die thinking it isnât fair.
Until that moment we couldnât know
The real meaning of life itself.

Now we are ready and heedful.
Weâll never fall again.
For the present and future,
Screaming loudly we say:

Gathering the clans!
Gathering the clans!
For the present and future.
Gathering the clans!

Gathering the clans!
Gathering the clans!
For the present and future.
Gathering the clans!

Gathering the clans!
(we are ready and heedful)
Gathering the clans!
(we are ready to fight)
For the present and future.
Gathering the clans!
