Who are they and why theyâve come here.
Donât let me go, donât let me be a sheep.
We donât need to see the promised land.
This is our time and we will not to leave.

They believe in fairy tales,
We believe in mother earth.
See yourself and better try
Coming back to the past and get a real life.

Donât waste your time trying to reach the sky,
Without wings you will never gain.
You have a wrong and boring way to live,
So I donât want to be part of that.

Shameful people who believe
In a silly senseless book.
Laughing loudly at them we are.
Pagan soul and mind.

Pagan soul and pagan mind.
A flamed heart of warrior pride.
Pagan soul, that we have.
And that itâs all we want.
