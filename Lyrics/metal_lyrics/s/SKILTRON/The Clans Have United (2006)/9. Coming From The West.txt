Coming to help from the west, showing willpower themselves.
Without fear they came, joined us till the end
To prove they can reinforce any noble couse,
Brotherhood from other blood giving us their word.

Restless after riding and running all the night,
No matter how far, to fight with pride they are.
As true warriors theyâre born and fighting they will die,
Leaving all they have to defend their lands.

Coming from the west, they were all, they were help.
Guided by ourselves, we could do it, thanks to them !

Outnumbered furious troops without nothing to lose,
The worst nightmare unexpected the time has ever made
Almost bare men, but with a filled heart.
Bravery as anymore the history would show.

Devotional men who have a strong soul heritage.
Countrymen or not united weâll be more.
As true warriors theyâre born, and fighting they will die,
Leaving all they have to defend their lands.

Coming from the west, they were all, they were help.
Guided by ourselves, we could do it, thanks to them !

Coming from the west, they were all, they were help.
Guided by ourselves, we could do it, thanks to them !
