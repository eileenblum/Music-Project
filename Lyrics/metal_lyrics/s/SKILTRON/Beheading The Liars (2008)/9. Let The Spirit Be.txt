As an axe for the hangman.
As the hammer for justice.
Looking for something healer,
I found the way I was searching.

Trying to get back what is mine,
Purity and hope will be one again.

Through my hand i could make it.
Here I am and know that
I have tasted it so now i can tell,
As a wise man said,
It's a dish best served cold.

I didn't let my spirit falls.
I will be what i have to.
From the dark i can see the light,
Otherwise I would be like you.

Don't try to make me as you are,
You don't even have a heart for yourself.

Through my hand i could make it.
Here I am and know that
I have tasted it so now i can tell,
As a wise man said,
It's a dish best served cold.
