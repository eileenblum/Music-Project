Follow the wind without thinking about it,
Breaking it all, facing the storm!
Fearless and faster than everything else,
Avoiding death, even in hell!
Taking the baton, heading the race.
Becoming the wildest, go for them!
Freeway the road, get to the end.
No step back.

Roaring like a lion,
Hitting up the night.
Come and cross the fire,
Need to get some more,
Ruling all the world.

Turning it all down,
Fast and wild!
Leading all the hordes.
Born to be the one,
Fast and wild!
Going high, going loud.

Rising from ashes, leaving the darkness,
Writing grounds and fields with blood!
No time for tears, show no remorse,
Only a few will survive!
Damned horizons are coming today.
Revealing the day, crashing the fate!
I'm loading the weapons, follow me now,
Time to fight.

Roaring like a lion,
Hitting up the night.
Come and cross the fire,
Need to get some more,
Ruling all the world.

Turning it all down,
Fast and wild!
Leading all the hordes.
Born to be the one,
Fast and wild!
Going high, going loud.
