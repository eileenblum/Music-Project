Don't you be surprised
Listening to these words,
It's what you have earned,
I'm what you've done.

You deserve nothing,
I wish you all the worst.
Yeah! it's me who's talking,
I'm what you've done.

Anyway I'm grateful
'Cause now i can differ
The really honest people
And the shit that you were.

Don't you be surprised
Listening to these words,
Now it's time you pay
The evil you have done.

For trying to turn me into misery
Skinning, stabbing and laughing at me.
This is my payback and I hope you don't mind
That I'm stronger than ever, I am still alive!
