Today I am going to talk about
A certain way of life which I can't understand.
I don't know why you waste your time
Trying to save your arse when the night has already come

You must know we don't want to listen
So leave us alone.
Praying is nothing, open your eyes,
Don't be a slave of dying.

Speak for speaking, that's not my style.
If I tell you something, I'm sure of that.
I don't need proofs, it's all at sight,
If you can't see that, so you're blind.

You must know we don't want to listen
So leave us alone.
Praying is nothing, open your eyes,
Don't be a slave of dying.

You must know we don't want to listen
So leave us alone.
Praying is nothing, open your eyes,
Don't be a slave of dying.

You accuse me of heresy, and I'm proud of that,
At least I enjoy life as if I could fly.
It's something that you must learn instead of so much talk,
What for you want to live bothering human kind?

You must know we don't want to listen
So leave us alone.
Praying is nothing, open your eyes,
Don't be a slave of dying.
