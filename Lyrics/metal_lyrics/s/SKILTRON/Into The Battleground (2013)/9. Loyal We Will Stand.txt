We've been marching together
We've been sharing this way
Always true to our ideals
Today we are still here

Without betraying our feelings
Like many others did
Our trail will remain forever
Like the fire and wind

Rebel blood in our veins
Since the very first day
Side by side we are standing
We are forging our fate

Many will fall - Only a few win
We'll keep on marching until our last breath
Reaching the top - The strength of our will
Loyal we will stand

There were those who tried to
Get us away from here
Now they see that their attempt
Has backfired on them

We are keeping the treasure
That they'll never have
Our honor is spotless
We have signed in blood

With snares and bad faith
They have built their sentence
Sinking deep into their failure
And nobody cares

Many will fall - Only a few win
We'll keep on marching until our last breath
Reaching the top - The strength of our will
Loyal we will stand
