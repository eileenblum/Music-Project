You just fucked with the wrong bull
And now you'll learn a real lesson
I will teach you who I am
And why you'll never be like me

Your fate has been sealed
Your game has ended
Surrounded by blazes
You are crying like a bitch

Besieged by fire
Too late to beg
The flames will burn you
Burn you to death

And it won't be enough
To see your body after it's been burned
I'm going to pulverize your bones
Making you disappear
From the face of the earth
And no trace of you will remain

Besieged by fire
Too late to beg
The flames will burn you
Burn you to death
