Walking in the meadows
Eating the grass
There is a rabbit
With no talent or light

You are not going to last
Living in my footsteps
The rope is getting thinner
And this will be your end

Looking from below
Squeaking with envy
Wishing me to fall
You just can't be quiet

You desire what I have
It's something you can't buy
It takes years to earn it
With work and sacrifice

The rabbit who wanted to be a wolf
Born to be a whistle, don't get to be a horn
The rabbit had to learn the hard way
And now he knows this is my place

The friends of the rabbit
As stubborn as him
They're cut from the same cloth
Like father, like son

Maybe in the end
You'll be a bit smart
And finally realize
Only the strongest prevail

The rabbit who wanted to be a wolf
Born to be a whistle, don't get to be a horn
The rabbit had to learn the hard way
And now he knows this is my place
