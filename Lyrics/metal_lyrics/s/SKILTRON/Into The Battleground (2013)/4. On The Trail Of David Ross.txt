In southern Glasgow he was born
With the name of David Ross
Inspired by those who'd fought before
He took a pen as strong as a sword

First was Wallace then came Bruce
Bonnie Prince and many more
Mounted on his two-wheeled horse
Riding every single road

Down to London he did march
To pay tribute to the great hero
An epic journey to Smithfield
And he made it!

On the rail of David Ross we are
And we'll keep his legacy alive
On the trail of David Ross we stand
As he did for Scottish freedom

Fighting bravely for his roots
Over hills and glens he walked
Crossing rivers, sailing lochs
And enjoying a fine Scotch

He wrote of Wallace, Rob the Bruce
And Charlie Stuart - Scottish Lore
Mounted on his two-wheeled horse
Proud warrior in hiking-boots

And today is time to give
Respect to him for what he did
While all men die not many live!

On the trail of David Ross we are
And we'll keep his legacy alive
On the trail of David Ross we stand
As he did for Scottish freedom
