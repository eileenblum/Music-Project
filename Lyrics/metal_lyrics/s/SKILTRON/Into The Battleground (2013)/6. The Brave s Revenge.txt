My revenge is coming this way
Through the same hand that built this ship
I'm still strong on this path
Holding up my flag!

If you don't see me for a long time
Don't think I have been defeated
I was just saving my strength
Now I'm back again!

The Brave's revenge
The only reason you're still walking
Is 'cause I'd rather you bleed to death

The Brave's revenge
The Brave's revenge
I'm gonna let you bleed to death
Then I'll be delighted to dance on your grave

You're just a bad replication
Without any imagination
A hilarious fool copycat
And like that you will die!

You quit your god then quit your tunes
What is the next thing you'll give up?
You never had what it takes
That's our difference!

The Brave's revenge
The only reason you're still walking
Is 'cause I'd rather you bleed to death

The Brave's revenge
The Brave's revenge
I'm gonna let you bleed to death
Then I'll be delighted to dance on your grave

My bagpipes sounded first
Yours are just a pipe dream

So, you think you are a warrior?
Face me! And then you will see
I'm gonna rip off your head
That's what you deserve!

I advise you to be careful
Your reckoning day is coming
You'll end up falling, I know
'cause you don't have the balls!

The Brave's revenge
The only reason you're still walking
Is 'cause I'd rather you bleed to death

The Brave's revenge
The Brave's revenge
I'm gonna let you bleed to death
Then I'll be delighted to dance on your grave
