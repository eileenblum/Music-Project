In May the British army was summoned by their King
And sent towards the continent to fight against the French
Finding defeat at The Battle of Fontenoy
They're killed by the thousands

Bonnie Prince then took his chances
Leading the Jacobite Rising
Marching with his men straight down
To the Lowland's Fields

Trying to stop this rebellion
John Cope went to Fort Augustus
But he failed in the intention
Of persuading the Highlanders

Armies march in Prestopans
Stuart and Murray lead the Clans
Pipes and war cries guide the steps
Waiting for the Highland Charge

Armies fight in Prestonpans
For the glory, for the pride
Pipes and war cries sounding loud
All over the battleground

Edinburgh town now belongs to Charles
Brave son of James Francis Edward Stuart
In his hands the crown will shine
Supported by the Clans
By the Firth of Forth, Charlie took his throne

Armies march in Prestonpans
Stuart and Murray lead the Clans
Pipes and war cries guide the steps
Waiting for the Highland Charge

Armies fight in Prestonpans
For the glory, for the pride
Pipes and war cries sounding loud
All over the battleground
