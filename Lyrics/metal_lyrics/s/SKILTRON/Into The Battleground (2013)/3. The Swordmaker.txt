He came from the Highlands of the north
That's where he got his father's temper
Devoting his life and working hard
The hammer is falling again!

Skilled in the art of forging steel
Shaping the blade of the ultimate sword

The Swordmaker
Giving the Clan the weapons to fight
The Swordmaker
Leaving his personal unique stamp

Now settled on the Lothian Fields
The Handle remains fit and strong
With his tireless hands, despite the time
Sharpened and ready to kill!

Skilled in the art of forging steel
Shaping the blade of the ultimate sword

The Swordmaker
Giving the Clan the weapons to fight
The Swordmaker
Leaving his personal unique stamp
