Brave, strong, bold and wild
Roaring loud his battle cry
Red lion ready to crush
Thirsty for enemies' blood

Flying the flag of the Lion Rampant
Carried to war - Eager to fight
Standing our ground where we'll live and you'll die
Leading the army - The Lion Rampant

Unwilling to agree the terms
Uncaring for the banner of truce
Our fury is wildly unleashed
We aren't here to sue for peace

The thistle is blooming to the open sky
Bagging Ben Nevis then heading to Fife
The truth is in the one who has
The real passion of the Highland Clans

Flying the flag of The Lion Rampant
Carried to war - eager to fight
Standing our ground where we'll live and you'll die
Leading the army - the Lion Rampant
