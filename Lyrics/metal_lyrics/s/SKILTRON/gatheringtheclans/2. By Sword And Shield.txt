Swords and shields ready for war.
Blood and courage into the battle.
Armies whose marching makes the earth shake,
Never being afraid of those they will face.

Tartans and bagpipes have joined in fury.
The clans have united along the country.
The rivalâs blood again will be shedding,
Dyeing the lowlandâs valleys and rivers.

To face the tyranny, for us it's and will be a must,
And it's a right fight against them.
Sharp your steel and ride your horse
To the victory we go!

Savage and brave men are forging their destiny,
So in the future they will not repent,
For giving it all, their names and their lives,
Remaining engraved for posterity.
Tartans and bagpipes will keep the marching,
In the earth, in heaven, in eternity.
And finally then, forever and ever,
The pride of the country will shine again.

To face the tyranny, for us it's and will be a must,
And it's a right fight against them.
Sharp your steel and ride your horse
To the victoryâ¦â¦

To face the tyranny, for us it's and will be a must,
And it's a right fight against them.
Sharp your steel and ride your horse
To the victory we go!
