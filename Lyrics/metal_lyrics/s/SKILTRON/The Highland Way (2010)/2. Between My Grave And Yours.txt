My time walking on this land is fading away
But I have no complains, I've done it well
I'm wondering if you can feel the same
Or maybe you realize you've been wasting your days

Now we both lie
But my name lives on
My legend begins now
Between my grave and yours
There's one difference:
Mine doesn't have a cross
My destiny is not heaven or hell

Watching the fire fall all over my ship
Sinking into the sea, down to the depths
Like those that in the past inspired who I was
Now I am there with them and they're proud of me

What have you found in your so beloved paradise?
There's no turning back, you are doomed forever

Now we both lie
But my name lives on
They will remember me

Between my grave and yours
There's one difference:
Mine doesn't have a cross
My destiny is not heaven or hell
