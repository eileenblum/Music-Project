Trying to get what I have in mind
I felt the need to go far away from here

To a place where I can find myself
Pre and real, honest and free
And now I am there

Come and join in the Clan
Lift you spirit and raise your hands
it's our meaning of life
A nation of freedom where Pagans stand

Just believe in yourself
It must be your own will, share it today
it's a reason to live
A nation of freedom till eternity
