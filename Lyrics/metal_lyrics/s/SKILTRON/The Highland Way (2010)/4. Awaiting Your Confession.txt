2000 years of death and lies, that is what you brought
But today we are here to end it now
You have sentenced millions of lives
Thinking you had some king of gift

All we ask is justice for those who died
To feed your ambition
So they can rest in peace

We are waiting your confession
Now it's your turn
Awaiting your confession
Now it's your turn to be hanged

Your arguments are not accepted, where is your god now?
You are about to taste your own medicine
There's no compassion for someone like you
Not even your prayers will save you

And now we know what divine justice means

Centuries of death and lies came to their end
From now on, the Pagan law rules over the world
You ll never deserve to be part if it
Not even your prayers could save you

All we ask is justice for those who died
To feed your ambition
So they can rest in peace

We are waiting your confession
Now it's your turn
Awaiting your confession
Now it's your turn to be hanged
