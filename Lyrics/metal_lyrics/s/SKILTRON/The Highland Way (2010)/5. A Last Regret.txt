Many years have passed
And it seems like you forgot
Forgot it all
But for me it was
Like a ghost living inside
While I harvested my hatred

A last regret
Will it come from you?
I think it wont

A last regret
Will it come from you?
It won't come at all
Your persevered pride
Was always by your side
(Your only friend)

You have never known
What feelings are and what
What are they for

A last regret
Will it come from you?
I think it wont

A last regret
Will it come from you?
It won't come at all

If you look at me now
Maybe you ll know
What I was I'm not anymore

And you would know
Something that
You should've known about
A long time ago

A last regret
Will it come from you?
I think it wont

A last regret
Will it come from you?
It won't come at all
Actually I don't care
