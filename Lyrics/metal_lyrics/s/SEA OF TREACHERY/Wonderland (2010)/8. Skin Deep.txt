Riddled with sickness, confined to a bed; the sickness dwells inside you in that now vacant chasm. This scourge has left you defiled and broken, forgotten and alone. Your once angelic beauty gives way to complete filth. Oh gorgeous how you've fallen, it's a real tragedy; the shameful life you're leading will bring your downfall. But baby in your future, in all honesty the shameful life you're leaving won't save you from anguish wrought from solitude - a viral suicide. This punishment against you is more than being used. Their greed and brazen insouciance are homicidal. But you were a willing subject, far from unaware. The risks were there before your eyes Ruined, you wretched whore. Defiled, you are a crimeless victim. Ruined, you begged for more. Lifeless, you're a walking carcass. You pray the retrovirals will boost your immunity. But now the cancer's spreading; you've sealed your fate. There was a fairness in your voice. Get up, get back, get away from me. But the inflection that you gave, it made the world tremble.
