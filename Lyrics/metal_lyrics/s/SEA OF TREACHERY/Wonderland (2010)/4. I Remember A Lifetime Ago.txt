Crushed by the agony of a silent oppression
Cold sweat envelopes me as I gasp for breath
Each of these track marks tells its own horror story
My hands are shaking, I haven't slept in days

There's no denial (we'll burn out)
I know what waits for me (far before we)
The calming hand of death (ever learn to)
Is almost in reach (it's almost in reach)

There is no promise
There is no future
There is no promise
There is no future

Dry your eyes 
You know we'll never tell
And if your secret was that hard to keep
We would fall
We'd fall!

I have no option, I'll throw it all away
I've sold my soul, I've lost my mind
There's no one I can turn to, in whom to confide
My ghost confronts me and I can't look away

Dry your eyes 
You know we'll never tell
And if your secret was that hard to keep
We would fall
We'd fall!

Look at what I've become
A shell of a man
Look at what I've become

Dry your eyes 
You know we'll never tell
And if your secret was that hard to keep
We would fall
We'd fall!

My desperation signals my untimely end
The thought of staying painless
Is all I have left!
