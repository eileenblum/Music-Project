Why haven't I felt like myself?
What are these voices in my ear?
I know that it makes your skin crawl
What are you scared of?
You don't have a choice
And try as you might 
You cannot silence us
Can you hear me now?

God, they all are around me
I can't see straight what is wrong?
Breathing is labored, the world is bent
What is all of this dissonance?

Who are these voices that are speaking to me?
A chorus of insanity, oh, how can this be?
All these voices
They are the bane of my existence
What did I do to deserve such torment?
When did I get this lost?
Reality seems so far away
The world is slipping from my grasp
Maybe I should just swallow my pride!

Save your strength now
Before you fall away
Hold on, don't give up
We will save you!

Back to a world of silence
And I've never felt so hollow
These pills merely subdue them
But I have total control
Back to a world of silence
And I've never felt so hollow
These pills merely subdue them
But I have total control!
