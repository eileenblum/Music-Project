It seems we're coming down to the wire,
it's sure been one hell of a ride.
To sum it up I hope you're satisfied.
I've been dragging you through it all 
while you tried to stand up to the machine.
It's not all so bad.
I hope you learned your lesson now.
It's more about acceptance just dumb yourself down.
The more you fight, the more you make it worse for yourself.
But now that we're here,
it should all be easier.
It seems we're coming down to the wire,
it's sure been one hell of a ride.
To sum it up I hope you're satisfied.
Just go with the flow,
like I've always said.
And stop trying to be what you aren't,
you're a walking contradiction.
