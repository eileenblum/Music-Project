Crashed! They were sisters in fortune; the serpents they struck them at the darkest of nights. Two ships sharing a gravesite, homogenized like a pile of bones. Virtue scorned in favor of mere survival. This is not the place for heroes. This is desperation in its truest form; many fail to escape their splintered graves. Virtue scorned in favor of mere survival. This is not the place for heroes. Clocks won't turn back to save us now. We won't forget that we have a chance. Finding solace in the hope that we have, this fragile lifeline is our only way out. Clocks won't turn back to save us now. We won't forget we have a chance. Go! And then the sun came up, a tiny shred of hope. Good timing for a promise to get back home. The light within never waivers, never dies. Instead, it saves you from this. Failure to find shelter in this hell of ice assures you pain that you'll never recognize. This is our destiny, you can't turn these ships around. Clocks won't turn back to save us now. We won't forget we have a chance. Finding solace in the hope that we have, this fragile lifeline is our only way out.
