[Lyrics: Ole Borud]
[Music: Ole Borud &amp; Peter Dalbakks]

I cried when you left home
I shed my tears alone
I once held you in my arms
And I kept you warm
We were so close, a father to son
But now you are gone

[chorus]
Please tell me why you had to leave me
I still wonder why
One thing I know, I will be waiting
For your return

Your heart is slowly growing cold
Your spirit is dying, wasting your soul
Losing hope, strangled by fear
Still you choose to live a lie
Do you not believe I could still love you?
Well, I proved it on a cross

[chorus]

Don't walk away
There is a room made for you
You belong to me

I still love you
