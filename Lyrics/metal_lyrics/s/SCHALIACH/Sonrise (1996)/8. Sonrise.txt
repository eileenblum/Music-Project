[Lyrics &amp; Music: Ole Borud]

Walking up the hill
To be crucified
Carrying a cross on His shoulder
He is a thorn apart
Body weakening
Carrying the sins of all the world
As He dies
Entering the kingdom of death
Taking the key

Sunset
The sky is black
The darkness takes authority
Sunset
Their hearts are black
They killed the Son of God

Three days after death
Mary takes the oil
Langing to anoint Jesus body
She arrives the place
Only to find out
The stone is rolled away
And the body gone

Why did she seek the living among the dead
He had risen from His death-bed

Sonrise
An empty grave
Only His garments were left
Sonrise
The prince paid
Blood has been shared
Sonrise
The Light is back
And it will never fade away
Sonrise
He brings us back
To the author of life

I am released from death

Light of life
Light of love
Shine on me
