[2005 re-release bonus track]

"I am viewing myself
Through the purple filter
How it all disappears
The stain that once covered my heart
By the hand of grace
I am granted a second chance
Taking away
The veil that once covered my eyes

I am leaving the past
Focus changed
Empowered to see the truth

I am looking forward
There's a light ahead
Through these eyes I see
What is yet to be
Immortality, is my reality
I'm connected
To the force of the Son..."
