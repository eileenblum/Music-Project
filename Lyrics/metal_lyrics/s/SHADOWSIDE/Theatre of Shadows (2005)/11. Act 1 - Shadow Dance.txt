As the sun goes up
And comes the morning
The shadows start to hide
As the darkness go down and down

With the light comes the blaze
With the pain comes the suffering
Deep suffering inside of brains
And souls burn with the lightening

Screaming - Cheering - Shocked
At the finest spectacle
Glory - Magic - Wonder
On the theater of shadows
Crossing outer space
Can't you see this ain't a dream?
Announcing the final fate

So let the shadow dance begin!
Dancing all night long for a chance to live
Dance all the pain and fear away
Dry all the tears you have been crying

The fire burns in the sky
And we look for a hideaway
Dark clouds will fight for the salvation of our race

Slowly they start to take control
To spread everywhere
At last there's something to keep the light away

Screaming - Cheering - Shocked
At the finest spectacle
Glory - Magic - Wonder
On the theater of shadows
Crossing outer space
Can't you see this ain't a dream?
Announcing the final fate

So let the shadow dance begin!
Dancing all night long for a chance to live
Dance all the pain and fear away
Dry all the tears you have been crying

[Solo]

Thunderbolts enlight the sky
Darkness spread fast high and low
Opposed natures will unite
Shocking the world above

So let the shadow dance begin
No longer mankind lives on an evil dream
Stronger arises power in my hands
There's no more human blood being spilled in vain
