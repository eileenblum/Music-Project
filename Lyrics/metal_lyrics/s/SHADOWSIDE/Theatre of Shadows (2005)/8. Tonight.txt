Come on, wake up, my friend
Enjoy your last day on earth
Years passed by and it's our turn
To make them scream in pain

I have no choice - they'll kill our kind
They'll let some live to make them cry
So now

We're gonna die tonight
This is the fate for all mankind
They're gonna die tonight
So stand up, look ahead
Let's fight, don't be afraid

Remember when you were young
And dreamed to change the world
Now don't you say you can't
You're here to take your chance

I have no choice - they'll kill our kind
They'll let some live to make them cry
So now

We're gonna die tonight
This is the fate for all mankind
They're gonna die tonight
So stand up, look ahead
Let's fight, don't be afraid
