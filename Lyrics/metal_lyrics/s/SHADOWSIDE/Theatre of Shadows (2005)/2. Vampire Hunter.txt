In the dark starts their kingdom
Blood's their food, they're the evil
Attacking humans with their strength
They are dead but they live

These strong fast creatures
Control the nightlife of the cities
Fear sunlight, the faith
Their main enemy is me

Sun is my weapon
They have no chance
Pray for their souls
Vampires now are past

I'm the Vampire Hunter
I'm the strength of the Earth
I'm the Vampire Hunter
I'm the hope of the world

Without guns I kill them all and
Send them back to where they come from
Raise from hell, Satan's with them
They will run away from here

The creatures of the darkness
Push our souls into the sadness
Crosses are vain, the tale ain't right
I'm the only mankind's light

Sun is my weapon
They have no chance
Pray for their souls
Vampires now are past

I'm the Vampire Hunter
I'm the strength of the Earth
I'm the Vampire Hunter
I'm the hope of the world

[Solo]

[2x]
I'm the Vampire Hunter
I'm the strength of the Earth
I'm the Vampire Hunter
I'm the hope of the world
