Look around you
Is this a good place to die?
Will you give up and think there is no
No... no... no paradise?

We'll find the way
To make our dreams come true
And see the way for us
So stop searching like a fool and
Look within your heart!

Get rid of hatred
Spread the word of love
Then close your eyes and feel its taste
You can do it, its not too late!

Shout and our voice will be heard
No one can turn us down
Nothing will stop us and
We will stand as one!

[2x]
We want a miracle to live
In a perfect world
Come and take my hand
And we can make it happen

Sometimes don't you find yourself
Oppressed and feel like you have no right
To be what you really are and need
To be like everyone

Stand up you should not accept
That you can't be unique and don't
Believe when people say that who
You are ain't good enough!

Shout and our voice will be heard
No one can turn us down
Nothing will stop us
And we will stand as one!

[2x]
We want miracle to live
In a perfect world
Come and take my hand
And we can make it happen
