You're not alone and you do have someone
To love and to trust
Let me take you to my paradise
In your land your heart will be crushed

Don't run away from your destiny
Cause you've got the power in your hands
Close your eyes if you can't see
The paradise and the magic land

This is your final chance
Never let it go
This is your last chance
To follow the light and find
The Kingdom of life

Now you're in the kingdom of life
Let my angels protect your way
My guides will tell you no lies
Enjoy then, you found your way

This is your final chance
Never let it go
This is your last chance
To follow the light and find
The Kingdom of life

Don't hide away from the peace of your mind
Come with me and don't make yourself blind

[Solo]

This is your final chance
Never let it go
This is your last chance
To follow the light and find
The Kingdom of life
