A blood curtain is on my window
Thanks to greed death comes from far beyond
You fear being in your home
Killing has no end

Bodies lie on the floor
Joy for some, sadness for others
I'm walking through mine fields
Carrying dynamites

Red storm, red storm
No predictions of when it will be over
Terror, oh terror
I'm lost, I'm forgotten in the middle of this...
Red storm, red storm
No predictions of when it will be over
Terror, oh terror
I'm lost, I'm forgotten in the middle of this war

Tones of bones are seen everyday
All my enemies are striking back
Children will become adults
Defenseless as a kid

Bodies lie on the floor
Joy for some, sadness for others
I'm walking through mine fields
Carrying dynamites

Red storm, red storm
No predictions of when it will be over
Terror, oh terror
I'm lost, I'm forgotten in the middle of this...
Red storm, red storm
No predictions of when it will be over
Terror, oh terror
I'm lost, I'm forgotten in the middle of this war
So run from danger
And the eye of fear
The war is closer
The peace's so far away

Red storm, red storm
No predictions of when it will be over
Terror, oh terror
I'm lost, I'm forgotten in the middle of this...
Red storm, red storm
No predictions of when it will be over
Terror, oh terror
I'm lost, I'm forgotten in the middle of this war

(Inside of the red storm...)
