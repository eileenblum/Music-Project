You're in the place where
The day and the night
Meet each other
Starting a fight
The love and the hate
Are walking together
It's your imagination
Playing with your mind

The world you are seeing is full of illusions
Inject in your vein
Magic for your brain
It's just like a drug takes control of your soul
Fooled by a dream
Won't help if you scream

Afraid of yourself in a freezin' night
You run away again
But there's no place to hide
Illusions will chase you -
Wherever you go
Your Choice is to accept
And live in the unreal world

The world you are seeing is full of illusions
Inject in your vein
Magic for your brain
It's just like a drug takes control of your soul
Fooled by a dream
Won't help if you scream

[Solo]

The world you are seeing is full of illusions
Inject in your vein
Magic for your brain
It's just like a drug takes control of your soul
Fooled by a dream
Won't help if you scream
