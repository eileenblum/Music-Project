Slowly it came up, spreading fast
Be wise, the shadow's here to stay
We are the ones to take your mind
We're here to get you high
Your eyes will burn when the day comes
So come on, stand at our side

Come and you will see
How good it feels tonight
Take my hand and follow me,
Arises this world for eternity

Hey! Shadow won't fade
We're here to dominate, there is no light without a shade
Hey! Shadow won't fade
We've come in your way to represent a brand new reign

Devasting as a hurricane
Rocking the world around
Everywhere, inside your empty hearts
We'll be there all the time
So hear my voice echoing loud
Wild roar in the night

Come and you will see
How good it feels tonight
Take my hand and follow me,
Arises this world for eternity

Hey! Shadow won't fade
We're here to dominate, there's no light without a shade
Hey! Shadow won't fade
We've come in your way to represent a brand new reign

Hey! Shadow won't fade
We've come in your way, to make you scream inside
Hey! Shadow won't fade
We're here to dominate
Hey! Shadows won't fade
We're going nowhere, so make way!
We're here to stay!
