Here I stand
I see the stars so far away
As slowly the sun comes down on me

Locked up
Tied up in my own bed
I scream but I know I can't be goin' mad

I'm dreaming
I'm running
I'm spreading, spread my wings
I'm seeking
I'm reaching
I'll find what I've been looking for

I will travel 'round all the universe
Where I belong, where I know I'll always shine
The wind blows in my hair, I've cut the wire
And I'm flying, flying as the Queen of the sky

Once again,
I fall but I know I can make
And show that I can't fail this way

I'll climb
The highest mountain in the world
To get closer to my destiny

I'm dreaming
I'm running
I'm spreading, spread my wings
I'm seeking
I'm reaching
I'll find what I've been looking for

[2x]
I will travel 'round all the universe
Where I belong, where I know I'll always shine
The wind blows in my hair, I've cut the wire
And I'm flying, flying as the Queen of the sky
