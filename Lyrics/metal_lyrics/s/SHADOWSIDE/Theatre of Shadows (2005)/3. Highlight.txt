A poor desperate man
Doesn't know what to do
Doesn't know what's wrong or right
Seems so close to kill or die

Lonely he moves on
Moves on with his tough life
No love, no money, nothing
Only his will to stay alive

Cruel times shattered dreams
Fire on water, death on life

[2x]
Highlight - Hope is the last to die
Highlight - There's always a light in the end of the ride
Highlight

Goin' through darkness
Blinded by the fog
No wood for his fire
Wishing he had a warm coat

From the shadow a creature comes by
And the fear it rules and says
"Don't be afraid and take my hand
And say farewell to the dark side"

Cruel times, shattered dreams
Fire on water, death on life

[2x]
Highlight - Hope is the last to die
Highlight - There's always a light in the end of the ride

[Solo]

Highlight - Hope is the last to die
There's always a light in the end of the ride
Highlight - Hope is the last...
...There's always a light in the end of the ride
