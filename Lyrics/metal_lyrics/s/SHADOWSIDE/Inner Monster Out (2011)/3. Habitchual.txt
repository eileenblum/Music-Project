Feeling the need to do it
One more time again
Temptation reigns before
I stop and start the end

Blurred into ecstasy
This animal starts to bite
Sinking its teeth deep
I lose the will to fight

Rewind this pain
Let me start again
Crawling into my world of torturing

I can feel
This surreal
Through the day and night
We're left behind
With this fear
Alone here
There's more pain inside
There's no time left to cry

Trying once more again
To deny my own desire
Seems like my hand are tied
I need to cut the wire

Losing control again
Of my actions and fate
I have to give into pain
But I can't lose the faith

Rewind this pain
Let me start again
Crawling into my world of torturing

I can feel
This surreal
Through the day and night
We're left behind
With this fear
Alone here
There's more pain inside
There's no time left to cry

I can feel
This surreal
Through the day and night
We're left behind

I can feel
This surreal
Through the day and night
We're left behind
With this fear
Alone here
There's more pain inside
There's no time left

I can feel
This surreal
Through the day and night
We're left behind
With this fear
Alone here
There's more pain inside
There's no time left to cry
