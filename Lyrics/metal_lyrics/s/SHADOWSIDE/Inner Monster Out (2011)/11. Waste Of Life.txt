We don't know right from wrong
We cannot discuss rationally
We're not allowed to think anymore
Just eat the bullshit they feed us on the screen

We are the toxic waste
Polluted minds that just go with the flow
Devouring the disgraced
Cheap entertainment, fluoride, and GMOs

We are straying
They got us

Hypnotized
By our own conventions
We follow
We're numbers
Renounced
Power of decision
We're stillborn
Inside

We swallow all excuses
We are the sheep misguided and led on
We'll take all the abuse
And even thank for all the pieces we are thrown

Un-oriented
They'll get us

Hypnotized
By our own conventions
We follow
We're numbers
Renounced
Power of decision
We're stillborn
Inside

We are straying
We are the disgraced
We are straying
We are the disgraced
We are straying
We are the disgraced
We are straying
We are the disgraced

We are straying
They got us

Hypnotized
By our own conventions
We follow
We're numbers
Renounced
Power of decision
We're stillborn
Inside

Hypnotized
Hypnotized
A waste
A waste of life
