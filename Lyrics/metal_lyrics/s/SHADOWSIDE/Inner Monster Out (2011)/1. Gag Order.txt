Once more I open up the door
A group of people stare
I try to ignore
Overcome by fear

I wear the mask and try to be
Assured, witty and sweet
I choke on my thoughts
All my lines are blocked

A simple answer would suffice
(I hear them whispering)
My mind is rushing, I'm in silence

The storm calls me back home
Nothing to feign
I won't personify again

The storm calls me back home
Nothing to feign
I won't personify again

I look up to the pitch-black sky
Sounds of rain loud outside
Alone I give out
I let myself down

I sing to quieten this shriek
of nostalgy in me
Wary in my words
All thinking is blurred

I can't express what's in my mind
(Why did I say nothing...?)
No one knows what I hide inside

The storm calls me back home
Nothing to feign
I won't personify again

The storm calls me back home
Nothing to feign
I won't personify again

[SOLO]

The storm calls me back home
Nothing to feign
I won't personify again

The storm calls me back home
Nothing to feign
I won't personify again
