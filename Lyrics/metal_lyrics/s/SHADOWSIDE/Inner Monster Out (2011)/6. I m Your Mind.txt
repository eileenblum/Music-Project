You can hide nowhere
I'll be always there
When you're about to fall
I will see it all

You can try to run
But I'm everyone
I am in your

Brain
When you think you're alone
I am the one
Keeping you company
Pain
I am there to remind you
Of all your faults

Haunting you at night
With the reason why
You can't sleep at night
Crave for peace of mind

Brain
When you think you're alone
I am the one
Keeping you company
Pain
I am there to remind you
Of all your faults

Tied, under restraint
Your thoughts are taint
You fall and run again
I know your darkest lies
I can hear your silent cries

Brain
When you think you're alone
I am the one
Keeping you company
Pain
I am there to remind you
Of all your faults
