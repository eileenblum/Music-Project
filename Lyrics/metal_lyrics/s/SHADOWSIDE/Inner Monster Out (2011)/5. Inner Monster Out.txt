Walking down streets in the night
Searching for clues
(I dare you to try)
(I'm smarter than you)
I'm working your head
Understanding you
(I dare you to try)
(I'm smarter than you)

I can gather what you do
I'm just like you
I can grasp your point of view

That side of me I never knew
Before I tried walking your steps
Inside of me resides a wild nature

I figure out your motivations and needs
(Accept what you like)
(And how good it feels)
Keep telling myself this is a good deed
(Accept what you like)
(And how good it feels)

When I let my darkness take control
Your one true soul
I will find out where you'll go

That side of me I never knew
Before I tried walking your steps
Inside of me resides a wild nature

One who fights the fire of hate
With the atrocious
Can slide and get caught like a bait
To the ferocious
He who bargains with the shadows
Deals with the wicked
He can cross a line too narrow
Get morals twisted

I let my darkness take control
Such a side of me I've never known
Before I tried walking your steps
Confusing my role
Your delusional tragical soul

I can gather what you do
I'm just like you
I will find out where you'll go

That side of me I never knew
Before I tried walking your steps
Inside of me resides a wild nature
