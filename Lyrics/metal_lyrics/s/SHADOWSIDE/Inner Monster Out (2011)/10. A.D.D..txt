Oblivion shields the world around
Voices all fade away
The more you talk, the more I'II drown

Unable to act socially
I will storm out
The restlessness in me screams loud

A thousand seconds fly and turn to
Hours wasted, life suspended
Words just seem to always slip by
I lose control

Cannot keep track of what was done
Don't know what I just said
Too sick of all the boring chores

Always late, never start and end
Nothing gets done
Can't keep track of my racing thoughts

Reckless actions rule my nature
Bursting out for every mistake
Zoning out, I lose my focus
I'II take the wrong course

I am living in my own
Distrait reality
Can't keep track of racings thoughts
Inside my head
Bursting out for every small
Mistake that people make
Too sick of all boring chores
My mind has gone astray

I am living in my own
Distrait reality
Can't keep track of racings thoughts
Inside my head
Bursting out for every small
Mistake that people make
Too sick of all boring chores
My mind has gone astray
