Guilty free
I will degrade and tease
I'm your sparkle, make you smile and live

I'm your sunshine
I'm your beacon light
I am your salvation, a secure temptation

You pretend
You want to be my friend
All you try is to be by my side

All nights you are drawn to me like
a bug is pulled by light
Your darling cries and waits for you
Bestow misgiving on the ones
That never leave you alone

I am the innocence you wish
You could have kept, you had within
I am the evil that you hide
That lives inside you everyday
When you ask me the reason why
I screw with your mind, make you cry
You'll find the answer deep inside
Just close your eyes

Sanctify
Yourself when by my side
Bury deep all disregarded lies

Meagerly
You act the part you play
Enduring misery I will be your escape

You know you'll never touch me like
You dream of when you hide
Unreacheable, I'm the one
The peace you seek
You'll find it in my face
It brings you to disgrace

I am the innocence you wish
You could have kept, you had within
I am the evil that you hide
That lives inside you everyday
When you ask me the reason why
I screw with your mind, make you cry
You'll find the answer deep inside
Just close your eyes

You know what I am
An Angel with Horns
