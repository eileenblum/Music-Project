Where are you?
Gone again after a smile
Who and what are you?
That vanishes like charm

I don't care
People tell me you're made-up
There must be a reason
Why you're out of sight

Dressed in white
Uneven and untrue
Reality is a point of view

Stand between me and the chaos out there
Do not walk on me again
Bring heartsease and more anxiety
My shivery friend, sweet enemy

Mocking me
Right before my eyes
Make all of my friends
Believe I lost my mind

I close the door
Too frightened to see you
I make myself look like a fool

Stand between me and the chaos out there
Do not walk on me again
Bring heartsease and more anxiety
My shivery friend, sweet enemy

(Stand between me and the chaos out there)

Stand between me and the chaos out there
Do not walk on me again
Bring heartsease and more anxiety
My shivery friend, sweet enemy
