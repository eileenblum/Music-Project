Angel he claims he once felt
No trace of it is left
To die is gain
Will not cry anymore and in vain

What should we wait for?

Colder than her lifeless heart
He smiles, celebrates
Tranquil eyes
Looking at us, he says a prayer
Life goes on

He questions not her torment
He fears not how it ends
Thoughts of his bride
Will dry all his tears

Colder than her lifeless heart
He smiles, celebrates
Tranquil eyes
Looking at us, he says a prayer
Life goes on

What should we wait for?
It's party time

Colder than her lifeless heart
He smiles, celebrates
Tranquil eyes
Looking at us, he says a prayer
Life goes on

Colder than her lifeless heart
He smiles, celebrates
Tranquil eyes
Looking at us, he says a prayer
Life goes on
