In deepest joy I take thee
I promise love for eternity
I'll kneel to thee and clean the blood
That deep red stains the floor

In the name of love
Violence finds its way inside
I crave for more

A private beating, public kiss
Of this ill-treat is my bliss
I spread the skin-color disguise
My mask for bruises that I hide

In the name of love
Violence finds its way inside
I crave for more

In the name of love
I'm loyal till the day I die
Can't get enough

Love me
Hurt me
Kill me
Force me
Make me obey

Love me
Hurt me
Kill me
Force me
Make me obey

In the name of love
Violence finds its way inside
I crave for more

In the name of love
I'm loyal till the day I die
Can't get enough
