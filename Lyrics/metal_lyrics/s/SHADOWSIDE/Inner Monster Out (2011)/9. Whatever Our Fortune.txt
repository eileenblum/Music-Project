Blasted, destroyed, all brought to ashes
Blackness in the sky
The lust for riches and power
Of one man brought the demise
Of almost all life
All but few children survived
On their shoulders the hope lies
To hold up they strive

Whatever our fortune
We strain 'til we stand no more
Whatever our fortune
We're bound to the core

He looks outside from his deathbed
Calls his son and cries
Begs him to repair his damage
To forgive his sins
He ravaged nature with obsession
It succumbed to his oppression
He gives out and leaves his child
With a mission in mind

Whatever our fortune
We strain 'til we stand no more
Whatever our fortune
We're bound to the core

Come rain or shine
You just keep on breathing
Block the sounds of suicide

Whatever our fortune
We strain 'til we stand no more
Whatever our fortune
We're bound to the core

Whatever our fortune
We strain 'til we stand no more
Whatever our fortune
We're bound to the core
