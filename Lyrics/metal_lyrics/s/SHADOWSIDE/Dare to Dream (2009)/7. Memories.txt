When it feels I've crossed the line and went back way too far
I stagger and I all and open the scar
I'm an errant on the run, a stumbler come undone
But I can't help if it's tattooed on my skin

I just happened to realize I belived in my own lie

All the memories I've put asied
I hid them byt they're still alive inside
All my past and all my history
Are hard to carry but I just can't leave behind

When I catch my myself with thoughts of people I once sought
I see I eas so blind and clean up my mind
Now I know well who they are, reality hits hard
Disguised myself in rage and never faced the pain

I just found out that I had to try to not submit to self-denial

All the memories I've put asied
I hid them byt they're still alive inside
All my past and all my history
Are hard to carry but I just can't leave behind

I just happened to realize I belived in my own lie

All the memories I've put asied
I hid them byt they're still alive inside
All my past and all my history
Are hard to carry but I just can't leave behind
