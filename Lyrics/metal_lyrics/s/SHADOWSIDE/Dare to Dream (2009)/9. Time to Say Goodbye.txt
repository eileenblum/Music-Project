I'm still in this darkened room
Nothing else but me and you
I see it all, even that picture on the wall

A drink, a kiss, I'm under your control
those hours made it all worthwhile
Never felt like this before

I can still hear the blues
And there's no tomorrow
Right now is eternity
No one can take that from me
I can still taste the wine
And hear your voice in my mind
My sweetest dream
It's time to say goodbye

I still look inside your eyes
I touch you face, see your smile
You know that I'm yours tonight

A wake-up call and I sleep alone
So cold, was so secure with you
But now you're gone

I can still hear the blues
And there's no tomorrow
Right now is eternity
No one can take that from me
I can still taste the wine
And hear your voice in my mind
My sweetest dream
It's time to say goodbye
