Late at night
Coming home after a hard day
And no one knows again
What's going inside my head

Streets are jammed
Still long hours till I'm there
Look trough thw window, it's all the same
There's no one who seems to care

No one will ask me what is going on
There's no such place like home
I'm only safe when I'm alone

Fly - when the tears of joy I cry
I'm blind with open eyes and
Far awat, in another land
I read my sense in life
Fly - with the wings of freedom I ...
And on my fall I rid myself of chains
That would hold me back to rise to
My peace inside

One more day I get up in the morning again
Work for a name without a face
In this stone jungle that I live

Everyday I do what doesn't matter to me
There is a small plant on my desk
I'm gonna take it and run away

The boss will ask me what is going on
Just get your work done
He won't miss me when I'm gone

Fly - when the tears of joy I cry
I'm blind with open eyes and
Far awat, in another land
I read my sense in life
Fly - with the wings of freedom I ...
And on my fall I rid myself of chains
That would hold me back to rise to
My peace inside
