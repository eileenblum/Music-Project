Hideaway - Hide before you fade away
Hideaway - Hide before they take you away

Hideaway to forget the truth long lost and left behind
To bury that forever
Run away just to hide what's lost and must be left aside
In the dawn it will be gone if
She just runs away, far away from all mistakes
And just lets the mask fall off of her face

The she'll kneel with the whole world
Laid on her shoulders
And hope she's strong enough
She will think she's dead
Think her faith is gone
But she'll get up one more time and
Scream to everyone

Hideaway - Hide before you fade away
Hideaway - Hide before they take you away

Whe it feels she will have to wait
Forever and a day
To release herself from all the pain
It is when she's closer to being delivered
Peace of mind
In the morning it will be gone if she just
runs away, far away from victories
Remember hoe the world is contradictory

She will get up one more time
and walk back home
In her beauty so sublime
She'll be idolized and carried on their shoulders
until they hunt her for the uncommited crime

Hideaway - Hide before you fade away
Hideaway - Hide before they take you away

Hey - what would you say if you were to blame
For everything I don't understand?
You'd say you know how it is but you were never like this
I'm the prey

Hideaway - Hide before you fade away
Hideaway - Hide before they take you away
