Watch the kid die and be horrofied
Those monsters, they drag him, his belt is still tied

Be sick, be shocked, cry, call out his name
You pretend life is just a game

Cry and try to realine
You cannot deny

Let's change our name right now
To Nation Hollow Mind
Tell me what's going on
The party is running wild
Day after the kid died
How could you let it go?

Party nation brings the fun your way
Empty and shallow joy all of the day

Brainwashed people are everywhere
If it's not good news than they just don't care

Cry and try do understand
This won't ever end

Let's change our name right now
To Nation Hollow Mind
Tell me what's going on
The party is running wild
Day after the kid died
How could you let it go?

Try to educate your mind
What will you become without respect?
