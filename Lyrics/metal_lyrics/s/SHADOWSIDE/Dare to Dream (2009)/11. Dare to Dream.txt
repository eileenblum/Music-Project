Your life is shit, you feel betrayed
You're down with nothing left to say
Crumbled in dismay

They will say you are insane
But look who's mad at journey's end
Your thoughts are just nonsense

They'll call you screwd-up mess 
twisted genius with no future
That's why you'll keep on going
to prove them wrong at the end of the road

Dare to dream, to feel, to make it real
Dare to try and make it right
Dare to challenge everyone who sys it ain't for you

When you're shattered into pieces
They'll break you and then walk away
But you'll get up once again

You're called the freak, the geek, a weirdo
Thet's what they say but you don'y care
special is not made on large scale

They'll call you screwd-up mess 
twisted genius with no future
That's why you'll keep on going
to prove them wrong at the end of the road

Dare to dream, to feel, to make it real
Dare to try and make it right
Dare to challenge everyone who sys it ain't for you
