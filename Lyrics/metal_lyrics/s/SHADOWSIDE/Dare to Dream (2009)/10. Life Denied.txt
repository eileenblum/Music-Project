Where was I when all my friends were bleeding
When my generation was out seething
Why do I never get to see outside?

All I see is blinding light in here
Trapped by windows and no one is near
I just feel the shade of condescension

So I try to reach out
For my spirit, my mind

Is there a way for you to understand?
I scream my lungs out but no one can hear
Show me a way to leave the quicksands of space and time
For my request for life was denied

I wanna play a part in reality
Know my creation has finality
I just want you to let me be

I need to fell disturbed and hurt and ill
Need to cry, to fear to feel
I just need you to let me try

So I try to reach out
For my spirit, my mind

Is there a way for you to understand?
I scream my lungs out but no one can hear
Show me a way to leave the quicksands of space and time
For my request for life was denied

No! Save me
No! Come back for me
No! Release me
Will you return the life I gave?

Is there a way for you to understand?
I scream my lungs out but no one can hear
Show me a way to leave the quicksands of space and time
For my request for life was denied
