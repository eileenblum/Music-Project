Mother - I hear you screaming in despair
Father - I wanna make you understand
These people around me can't help in anyway
Angels are coming, I hear them singing in my head

I do not fear
Don't cry for me
It's peaceful there
I wish you could see
I'll hold your hand 
When I'm gone
I'll wait for you there

Now is the time for us all to move on
I'm flying so high above the world
Someday I know we'll meet and be just one
I'm trying to reach out to you

Brother - I need to help you on your way
You need to know you will always have me
Don't lose control, it's not worth losing your soul
Just have the patience to wait, your time will come

I do not fear
Don't cry for me
It's peaceful there
I wish you could see
I'll hold your hand 
When I'm gone
I'll wait for you there

Now is the time for us all to move on
I'm flying so high above the world
Someday I know we'll meet and be just one
I'm trying to reach out to you

I don't know why it has to be like this
I miss the ones I leave
But I leave no kids and no one
To go on with my legacy
Don't cut short the mysery you fell
You'll be alright
Just try, why must you be in pain?

Now is the time for us all to move on
I'm flying so high above the world
Someday I know we'll meet and be just one
I'm trying to reach out to you
