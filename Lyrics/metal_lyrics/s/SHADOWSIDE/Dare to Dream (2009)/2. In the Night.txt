I'm a threat to all your hopes and dreams
A danger to your lifelong precious schemes
You gamble and take your like to extremes
It's all on the line but can you still trust me?

I never wanted to break down this way
There's nothing to be done, you drive me insane

In the night
I will teat apart this shroud
I will scream your name out loud
I will feed the flames
In the night
I will spill it all out
I will shout it to the crowd
I will play your game

I'm addicted to this wild ride
A sick obessesion wanders trough my mind
Openly enslaved, my hands are tied
Shackled tight the secrets deep inside

I've had it way too long, I need to scream
I need to but don't want to be set free

In the night
I will tear apart this shroud
I will scream your name out loud
I will feed the flames
In the night
I will spill it all out
And will shout it to the crowd
I will play your game

When I try to show you what you've done
I read the pages I should have turned

In the night
I will tear apart this shroud
I will scream your name out loud
I will feed the flames
In the night
I will spill it all out
And will shout it to the crowd
I won't play your game
