I'm trying to tell you
I have gone so far
The stories that should be forgotten
Are still hanging on my mind

Trough a lifetime of
Make belive kind lines
Stuffed with your vain disdain
Shivery eyes, pure see-trough lies
From the kinf of Superbia reign

If my dreams are left to drown, would you care?
You'd stand proud in the crowd and walk away

Ready or not, here I come
Finding my way into this world
Gotta stand strong and take it all
One more day

Barefoot on the bloodstained road
You left me there on my own
Soaked in redness of my raw truth
Face what you have made me go trough

Fake smiles, backstabs, insincerity
Small talk and flattery
Everyone looks their best
With a dead heart in their chest

When you refuse to aid a friend, then you lose your soul
It's when you wash your hands clen, you fall

Ready or not, here I come
Finding my way into this world
Gotta stand strong and take it all
One more day

Can you stand proud
If you drown
You'll lose your soul
You know you'll fall

Ready or not, here I come
Finding my way into this world
Gotta stand strong and take it all
One more day
