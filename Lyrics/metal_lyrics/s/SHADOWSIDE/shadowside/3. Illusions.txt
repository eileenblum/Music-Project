You're in the place where 
The day and the night 
Meet each other 
Starting a fight 
The love and hate 
Are walking together 
It's your imagination 
Playing with your mind 

The world you are seeing is full of illusions 
Inject in your vein 
Magic for your brain 
It's just like a drug takes control of your soul 
Fooled by a dream 
Won't help if you scream 

Afraid of yourself in a freezin' night 
You run away again 
But there's no place to hide 
Illusions will chase you - 
Doesn't matter where you go 
Your Choice is to accept 
And live in the unreal world 

The world you are seeing is full of illusions 
Inject in your vein 
Magic for your brain 
It's just like a drug takes control of your soul 
Fooled by a dream 
Won't help if you scream
