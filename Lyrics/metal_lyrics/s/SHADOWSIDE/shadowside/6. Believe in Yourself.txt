Tell me why 
You keep yourself in fear 
All of us 
Must do something to be someone here 

All our dreams 
Coming true if we believe our power 
The voices unheard 
Will be loud as the sound of a thunder 

Go for your dreams with the strenght of a warrior 
Face all the evil in your way 
Fight for you thoughts and don't ever stop 
And you will reach the glory 

Believe in yourself  
Heaven's at your side  
Always working for you  
So fight for the chance of your life  

Imagine we are 
Flying above the sea 
The birds in the sky 
Telling us how it feels to be free 

Find out who you are 
Staring yourself at the mirror 
Tell yourself "I can" 
And realize all your dreams 

Go for your dreams with the strenght of a warrior 
Face all the evil in your way 
Fight for you thoughts and don't ever stop 
And you will reach the glory 

Believe in yourself  
Heaven's at your side  
always working for you  
So fight for the chance of your life  

Show all the world you can walk on your way 
Let them all know you've got enough strenght 
Don't be a slave, you have wills and have rights 
Be the owner of your life
