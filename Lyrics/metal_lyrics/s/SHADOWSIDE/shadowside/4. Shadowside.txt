When the night begins it's fall 
And the darkness fills the Earth 
You should see the scene of the dawn 
See the life burn in the ground 

Now it's up to you to decide 
Choose your way - to live or to die 
The Killer is walking at your side 
Fool - don't lose your mind 

The Nightmare just began 
Shadows, mirrors are all around 
Souls rising from their graves 
Waiting for justice and peace 

Now it's up to you decide 
Run - enter shadowside 
Where the souls remain in calm 
Without light - without light 
Without light 
In the cold 

Choose, choose - choose, choose 
Lightside or shadowside 
Choose, choose - choose choose 
Two paths to be walked 
choose, choose - choose, choose 
Find the freedom of the death 
Choose, choose - choose, choose 
Rest in peace or feel the pain
