There's a place I try to go, so far from here
I close my eyes, I try to, to disappear
I look around in my own way
But what I see I never, never really know
I wander 'round until I feel it coming on and then it's
It's time to go
I don't want to be here, falling out of place
Confusion's the consensus, fighting for my space

Can't stop the running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me

I lived it, I live it, it's not easy to say
I felt it, I feel it, it's just another day
It scares me, why does it dare me
You know it aint a fair fight
Pain overtakes me, it tries to break me
You know that something aint right

Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Set my body free

They don't make no seatbelt for the mind.
So I can't fasten up for this ride...

Running away, can't stop the runaway emotions
Not right, can't fight
Can't stop the runaway emotions
Fighting, hiding, can't stop the runaway emotions
Hypnotized, paralyzed
Can't stop the runaway emotions

Can't stop the running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions

I hate it, I hate me, like my consistency
I've seen it, I see it, I'm talking literally
So much lying, too much denying
It's time to face the facts
You can't help me
These cards were dealt me
Play out the final act

Now you got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
You got them running, can't stop the running
The runaway emotions in me
Set my body free

Oh no, you really done it this time

Can't stop the runaway emotions
Can't stop the runaway emotions

There's a place I try to go, so far from here
I close my eyes but I can't, can't disappear
