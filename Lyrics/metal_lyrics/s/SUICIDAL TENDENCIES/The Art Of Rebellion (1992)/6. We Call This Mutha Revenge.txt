Is this the beginning or the end

This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge
This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge

Best not be talking to me, not with those words you said
I guess I'll have to accept your invitation
To toast you upside your head
Everything has got a start
And everything has got an end
And every action has a side effect
We call this mutha revenge

This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge
This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge

Don't know if I'll blast, maybe I'll just throw
Maybe I'll kick down something special
But believe me, you're gonna know
Should have thought before you got it started
'Cause everything has got an end
Ain't no sloppy fool that's innocent
We call this mutha revenge
Revenge, revenge
This is the beginning of the end

This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge
This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge

I've seen loc'sters come, I've seen loc'sters go
But the only real loc'sters
Are holding down six feet below
Everything has got a start
And everything has got an end
Every action has a side effect
We call this mutha revenge

This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge
This is revenge, we call this mutha revenge

You're putting up a front, we're gonna tear it down
Had enough of your sorry ass 'tude
I don't trip no stare me down
You should of thought before you got it started

'Cause we're the ones that make it end
Ain't no sloppy fool that's innocent
We call this mutha revenge

Revenge, revenge
Revenge, revenge
