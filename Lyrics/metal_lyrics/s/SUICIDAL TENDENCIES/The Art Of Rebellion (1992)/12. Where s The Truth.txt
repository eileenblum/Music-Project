Late at night, that's the time I can't forget it
Sail the darkness but this ain't sleep
Heard the sound, could it be I got the message
But the message wasn't intended for me
Can't you see there's a madman working
He's putting in overtime
Too content with the sweet scent of denial
You're oblivious to the signs

It's a struggle for the reason
But it's the only thing I know

No surprise, here's more lies and you still are wailing
What the hell are you saying
And you're fly fly flying with lie lie lying
Where's the truth, where's the truth, why you lying
Truth abuse, what's the use, it's not a game you're playing
Do you know what I'm saying
And you're high high hiding with lie lie lying
Where's the truth, where's the truth, where's the truth

I'm not you, you're not me, that's the difference
So you can't deny we're the same
What's the point, that's what sticks huh exactly
Take a second helping of the blame
Not a scare not a bomb not a warning
A condition that no one should doubt
There's a tick tock tick tock
Ticking in my head you gotta get out

Yet I cannot deny the reason
'Cause it's the only thing I know

No remorse, danger course, and you still are wailing
You don't know what you're saying
And you're fly fly flying with lie lie lying
Where's the truth, where's the truth, why you lying
Sick in thought, disease you've caught
Is it a game you're playing, do you know what I'm saying
And you're high high hiding with lie lie lying
Where's the truth, where's the truth, where's the truth

It's a struggle for the reason
But it's the only thing I know

Too much tweak, dosage leak
And you still are wailing, what the hell are you saying
And you're fly fly flying with lie lie lying
Where's the truth, where's the truth, why are you lying

Set to lose, why you choose
It's not a game you're playing, do you know what I'm saying
And you're high high hiding with lie lie lying
Where's the truth, where's the truth

Where's the truth, where's the truth, where's the truth
Where's the truth, where's the truth, where's the truth
You're lying!
