Counting on nothing,the numbers get higher
Blinded by reason, you're asleep at the wheel
Confused understanding, with a slip for the hold
Squeeze past the pressure, you're asleep at the wheel

A magical moment
Is it too much of a good thing
Recycled in memory was
It too much of a good thing
Why can't you remember
Is it too much of a good thing
Preserved in it's danger
You're asleep at the wheel
Blank stare and a whisper, but who are you judging
I thought you were different
You're asleep at the wheel

A special assignment
Is it too much of a good thing
Unlocked underpressure
Was it too much of a good thing
Confined unforgiveness
Is it too much of a good thing
A new kind of danger, you're asleep at the wheel

Hope in revision, slight miscalculation
It all goes in stages, you're asleep at the wheel

A blank stare and a whisper
I thought you were different
But who are you judging
I thought you were different
You're asleep at the wheel
