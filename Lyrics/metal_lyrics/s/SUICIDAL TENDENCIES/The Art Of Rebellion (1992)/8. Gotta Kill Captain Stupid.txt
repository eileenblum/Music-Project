Ah damn, we got a lot of stupid people
Doing a lot of stupid things
Thinking alot of stupid thoughts
And if you want to see one
Just look in the mirror

Gotta kill Capt. Stupid, can't you see him?
Today we start the new way, we're Suicidal
Gotta kill the old way, we'll make it better
Won't you join our mission, don't be stupid
Got to kill Capt. Stupid
Got to kill Capt. Stupid

Brother killing brothers, what up with that?
Can't you see there laughing, that aint funny
Babies making babies, that aint love
You just got screwed over, get some respect

Got to kill Capt. Stupid
Got to kill Capt. Stupid

And I don't understand why
People be bringin' Capt. Stupid in there lives
Treating him like a super-hero
Glorifying him when he aint nothing but a super-punk
And you see, you're the one who's gonna have to stop him
'Cause you're the one that started him

Oh, what's that?
So, now you say life sucks
Well, ninety-nine percent of it's
What you make of it...
So if your life sucks, you suck

What's that crap you're smoking, playing the fool
Waste your life for nothing, when your something
What the hell you thinking, mind pollution
Got to get back control, it's your life fool

Got to kill Capt. Stupid
Got to kill Capt. Stupid

What's that now?
Ah, so you're scared to do something about it
Well, you better be scared not to do something about it
'Cause if you don't kill Capt. Stupis
Capt. Stupid gonna kill you!
Got to kill Capt. Stupid - fool
