In this world without harmony
Where there's no peace and there's no sanity
I can still survive and survive peacefully
Until that moment when you crash down on me

Cause I'll
I'll hate you better
Cause I'll
I'll hate you better

You better watch how you direct your hate
Or you'll receive part of my natural trait
Before you send off, you just better wait
Cause I aint got time not to retaliate

I'll, I'll hate you better
I'll hate you better

I'm not trying to threaten or to decieve
I'm just enlightening you so you wont be niave
I'll tell you one thing that you better believe
My hate is better to give than to receive

I'll, I'll hate you better
I'll
