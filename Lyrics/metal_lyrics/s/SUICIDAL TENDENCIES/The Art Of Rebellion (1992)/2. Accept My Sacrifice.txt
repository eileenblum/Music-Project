No destination set
I daze along till something finds me
Where I've been I'm not sure
I cannot see the tears, they blind me

You know that something ain't right
It's a sacrifice
Why must I pay this price
Accept my sacrifice

An emptiness so full
I cap it off with expectations
A sight not to behold
I cover all in explanations

It's a sacrifice
No no no no no
It's a sacrifice a sacrifice

Sailing off of course, directions lost
There is no exit
The captain's abandoned ship, now mutiny
How could I suspect this

It's a sacrifice, it's a sacrifice, accept my sacrifice
It's a sacrifice, it's a sacrifice, it's a sacrifice
Accept my sacrifice
