Free--can anyone show me the way to free?
Free--does anyone know which way is to free?

I aint here to dought you, just heard so much about you
Wont you save a place for me
I hope you'll let me choose you
I never would abuse you
Please accept my sincerity

Free--I want you
Free--I need you
Free--which way's it to free?
Free--I want to hold you
Free--I want to know you
Free--Can you send me to free

Although some may deny you
I'd really love to try you
I need this opportunity
My past has been divided
My future, I'll rewrite it
Change my life if it need to be

Which way's it to free?
Which way's it to free?

Free--Can anyone show me the way to free?
Free--Does anyone know which way is to free?

Gimme some free...Which way's it to
Gimme some free...Which way's it to
