We are gathered here, to get your slam on!
We're gonna do what we do... slam!
Slam city, slam city, slam city, slam!

We're thrashing around and something's 'bout to go down
If you can't take a hit
Then what the hell you doing going into the pit
Pain is the gift that used right won't let you quit
Bruises are the trophies won from the hits
So if you get into the way of what a pity
'Cause you know you'll be going down when we meet in slam city

Slam city, slam city, slam city, slam!

You're feeling the rage
You're loving flying off the stage
It's all such a blast
To knock someone silly when the groove kicks your ass

You can't blame us for blowing off some steam
You envy us for making our own scene
I said it all before and I'll say it again suicidal
We ain't here to mosh we fuckin' slam

Let's get this cyco pit
Going crazy with some cyco hits
Ready to get your slam on? Slam!
Slam city, slam city, slam city, slam!

We're holding it down
When the circle cloese all around
Now we're making a wall
And we're knocking over suckers like we're a human bowling ball

You can't blame us for blowing off some steam
You envy us for making our own scene "Cyco family"
So if you get in our way of what a pity
'Cause you know you'll be going down when we meet in slam city
This is the last chance
To get down with your slam dance
Hold it, hold it, hold it, slam!

Going on the attack, somebody's gonna get jacked
This punk ain't no punk
So you better move away or you're gonna get slam dunked

Slam! Slam! Slam city, slam! Slam! Slam city
Slam! Slam! Slam city, slam! Slam! Slam city
Get your slam on! Slam!
