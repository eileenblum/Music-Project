Smash It!

I got bruises scars and broken bones
One of a kind I can't be cloned
Meditation would be a sin
I love my homie, adrenaline
I've had fears and doubts and lots of pain
Suffered lots of loss, for little gain
While your rules say I can never win
I still love my chances, adrenaline

I'm fired up today's the day! 
I can't be stopped, there ain't no way!
The bodys used to get it done
But the mind is where this battles won

Charge charge charge, bash bash bash... adrenaline
Fight fight fight, smash smash smash... adrenaline

Smash It!

Racing down a hill at 8 adrenaline
Slamming surfing motocross or skate adrenaline
Caco slamming in the pit adrenaline
Riot pigs marching in adrenaline

I can't be stopped, today's the day!
Refuse to fail, there's no way
My destiny's in front of me
This moments like an eternity

Bash bash bash, smash smash smash pure adrenaline
Smash smash smash, bash bash bash pure adrenaline

Adrenaline! Adrenaline! Smash it! Smash it!

Racing down a hill at 8 adrenaline
Slamming surfing motocross or skate adrenaline
Caco slamming in the pit adrenaline
Riot pigs marching in adrenaline
