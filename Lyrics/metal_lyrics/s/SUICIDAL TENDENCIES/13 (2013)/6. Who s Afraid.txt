I wanna know something
Who's, who's, who's afraid to get cyco?

I make up my own rules, don't you remember me?
I still don't give a damn, why can't you look at me
I got a lot more to take, you think you know me?
A Cyco's got a right to know

Who's afraid of a cyco?
Get caco, a Cyco's got a right to know
Who's afraid of a Cyco?
Get cyco, us Cyco's wanna know

I get straight to the oint, you don't know me
I magnify what's inside, you think you know me
And plus I give you my soul, you can't ignore me
I don't conceal or don't disguise

Who's afraid of a Cacy? A Cyco's got a right to know
Who's afraid to go cyco? This Cyco wants to know
Yea, I wanna know
Who's afraid of a Cacy? A Cyco's got a right to know
Who's afraid to go cyco? This Cyco wants to know

Ain't no stopping a Cyco, ain't no stopping a Cyco
Ain't no stopping a Cyco, ain't no stopping a Cyco

I got a feeling coming over me, another battle with reality
Redefining what's called sanity, the Cyco's gonna do it all night
Can't stop that feeling that's inside, that very very special
Part of me
The opposite of a lobotomy, a Caco's gonna do it all night

Let the Cyco's get cyco, let the Cyco's go cyco, let the cyco's
Be cyco all night
Let the Cyco's get cyco, let the Cyco's go cyco, let the cyco's
Be cyco all night
Let the Cyco's get cyco, let the Cyco's go cyco, let the cyco's
Be cyco all night

Can't stop that feeling that's inside, that very very special
Part of me
The opposite of a lobotomy, a Cyco's gonna do it all night

Who's afraid of a Cyco? Who's afraid of a Cyco?
Who's afraid of a Cyco? Who's afraid of a Cyco?

Can't all just get along?
