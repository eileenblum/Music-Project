I was railroaded, framed and unjustly found guilty
Then again I was the judge and the jury
I was bashed, beaten, bullied and left battered in the alley
You can chaulk it up to another self inflicted tally

Stand up with conviction, give your demons the eviction
Do not waver, show trepidation
Stand up with conviction

I looked straight into the eyes of evil and I was shaking with fear
Oh Lord how I hate it when I look into the mirror
I fell so far I'd have to climb a mountain just to touch the bottom
I try not to let you see them, but the demons yea I got'm

Stand up with conviction, give your demons an eviction
Do not waver, show trepidation
Make your stand with conviction
Stand up, stand up, stand up, with conviction
Stand up, stand up, stand up, with conviction
Make your stand with conviction

It was so weak and fraile the first time that I meet it
But then it grow so big and strong from all the pain that I feed it
It turned on me so quick that I didn't understand it
But then again it turned out just the way I planned it

'Cause I was down...
Yea I was down
Down down down down down down low
I was so low I had to climb a mountain jut to touch the bottom
Down down down down down low
Make your stand with conviction
You can not make a stand... if you're afraid to fall
Make your stand
Stand up, stand up, stand up with conviction
Make your stand, make your stand, make your stand with conviction
You gotta make your stand, you gotta make your stand, with conviction
