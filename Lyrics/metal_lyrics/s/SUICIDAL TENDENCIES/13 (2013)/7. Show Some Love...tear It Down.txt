Show some love... show some love, tear it down!

I wouldn't sing it if it wasn't coming from my heart
It's time to bring the people back together that governments
Tear apart
And I refuse to be a victim, of corporate media tricks
And I'll never, never, never accept status quo politics

They try to tear us apart, they try to bring us down
They try to hold us back, tear it down
They try to tear us apart, they try to bring us down
They try to hold us back, tear it down
Show some love, tear it down, tear it down

Show some love, tear it down, tear it down

I got to teach about the real world, 'cause they're afraid to
Teach that in schools
And you'll never ever get nowhere blindly following other
Peoples rules
And if you think that I'm negative, then no one's ever shwon you
Real love
'Cause there comes a point in everyone's life, when they've had
Enough.

They try to hold us back, they try to bring us down
They try to tear us apart, tear it down
They try to tear us apart, they try to bring us down
They try to hold us back, tear it down
Show some love, tear it down, tear it down
Show some love, tear it down, tear it down

I'm calling out for a new kind of love
One that won't break down when things get tough
I know I may sound like I'm full of dreams
But I still believe we put our hearts and minds together we can
Do anything!

They try to hold us back, they try to bring us down
They try to tear us apart, tear it down
They try to tear us apart, they try to bring us down
They try to hold us back, tear it down
Show some love, tear it down, tear it down
Show some love, tear it down, tear it down
