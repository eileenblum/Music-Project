Life, can't live with it, can't live without it
Life, can't live with it, can't live without it

I wish I could touch you, the way that you touched me
If I could have touched you, things would of ended up differently
All the sadness, all the regrets
All the what could have beens, and all the whit ifs?

You know that you touched me, and I'll never be the same
Now I wish I could touch you, 'cause all we feel is the blame

All the emotions, all the should have beens
All the remorse that forces all of this spin
All the confusion, all these questions that burn within

I wish I could touch you, we need to find your touch
How I wish I could touch you, we all need the touch
Now I wish I could touch you, we gotta find the touch
How I wish I could touch you, we need to feel the touch
Lord I wish you could touch us, we gotta find your touch
How I wish you would touch us

So don't you try to tell me, that it's all God's plan
'Cause I'm sure he's up there crying a whole lot more than I am
And if he exists, then it's always such a shame
'Cause how hard it must be to watch over all this pain
And I say this as a father and a son
Who never thought that he could be filled and touched with so much love
And I would do anything, give anthing at
'Cause it just tears me, how it scares me, that they won't be
Touched before they fall

Life, can't live with it, can't live without it
Life, can't live with it, can't live without it
