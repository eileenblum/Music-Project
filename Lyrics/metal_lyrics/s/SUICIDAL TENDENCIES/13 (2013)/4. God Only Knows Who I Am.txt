Everybody is born, but not everbody lives
And just because you may be breathing
That don't mean that you are living

I'm not that person, that you want me to be
I'm not that person, you better face the reality
I'm not that person, so don't tell me that you understand
'Cause I am the person, that nobody can

No, no, no you don't get it!
No, no, why can't you get it?
No, no, you never seem to get it
That's why I say just funk it and forget
No, no, no you don't get it
No, no, why can't you get it?
No, no, you never seem to get it
That's why I say just funk it man forget

I'm not that person, that would sit alone and cry
I'm not that person, that didn't care if I lived or died
I'm not that person, that you used to slap around
I am the person, that'll beat your ass down

No, no, no you don't get it!
No, no, why can't you get it?
No, no, you never seem to get it
That's why I say just funk it and forget
No, no, no you don't get it
No, no, why can't you get it?
No, no, you never seem to get it
That's why I say just funk it man forget

And God only knows, and God only knows
And God only knows, and God only knows

No, no, no you don't get it!
No, no, no you don't get it!
No, no, no you don't get it!
No, no, no you don't get it!

Dear God how come it takes a lifetime to live, but only a second to die?

And God only knows, who I am
And God only knows, who I am
And God only knows, who I am
And God only knows... no, no, no you don't get it!
No, no, you never seem to get it!
No, no, why can't you get it? 
No, no, no you don't get it!
