Living the fight, fighting to live
This ain't the end
Fighting to live, living the fight
This is where it begins
You got to make every single second count
You got to make every single heartbeat count
Fight to live, living the fight
It's headed straight for your mind
So many way it can take you out, it's a battle that we'll all face sometime

It's so hard to watch you fighting to live
I wish I could give you, the strength to begin
To win the battle of your demons &amp; confront all your doubts
To remind you of what you should be and what really ruely counts

fighting to live, living the fight, fighting to live

Fighting to live, living the fight, do it again
Living the fight, fighting to live
Stay strong to the end
You gotta make every single moment count
You gotta make every single breath count

I'm so proud, to watch how your living the fight
To be so strong, against such odds, and to show so much might
Although it doesn't seem fair that anyone should have to face such a trial
You still counter the pain and anger with such an angelic smile

Fighting to live, living the fight, fighting to live

Living the fight, fighting to live
Fighting to live, leaving the fight
You got to make every single second count
Living the fight, fighting to live
