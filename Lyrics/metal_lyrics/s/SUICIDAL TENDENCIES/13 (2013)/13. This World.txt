I serve my heart up on a platter
The world laughs at me like I don't even matter
You grab my hand just to squeeze too tight
You cause me pain just so I'll feel your might
You cast your vengeance so easily
Again found guilty in absentee
So why's it when everybody looks at me
The always judge me for the things they can't see?

I take your suffering and I eat it like dessert
I'm not a masochist I just can't stand to see you hurt
But every time I think of you my heart and mind disagree
You know I'd love you, why won't you love me?
The voices in my head keep me up all night

Fighting over and over about what's wrong and what's right
So many people have done me wrong, I had to stop the list
'Cause it got too long
You do me wrong yet I still care
there's not a thing that I won't share
I can't win the fight to prove my love
'Cause you're a hawk and I'm a dove

I'd like to show the world my love
I'd like to show the world my love
I'd like to show the world my love
But this world don't deserve my love
I'd like to show the world my love
I'd like to show the world my love
I'd like to show the world my love
But this world don't deserve my love

This world don't deserve my love, this world don't deserve
My love
This world don't deserve my love, this world don't deserve
My love
So I'll save it all for God up above, so I save all for God
Up above
