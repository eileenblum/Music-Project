This ain't a celebration, this ain't a celebration
Pissed off like a mutha it's just par for the course
This ain't a celebration
I've felt a lot of things but never felt remorse
This ain't a celebration
If you go digging inside my head watch out where you probe
This ain't a celebration
I got some messed up shit inside my frontal lobe
This ain't a celebration

They turn the furnace on inside me
The anger burns inside my head
But there's one thing that they didn't count on
Is that I'll fight, fight, fight until the end

This ain't a celebration, this ain't a celebration

The give and take was I give and you just take
This ain't a celebration
Trapped in a situation I'm desperate to escape
This ain't a celebration
Pulled on me way to hard you triggered the silent alarm
This ain't a celebration
I only get violent to minimize the harm
This ain't a celebration

I got pure hatred on the one side
I got an itching for revenge
I got the power all inside me
'Cause I will fight, fight, fight until the end

This ain't a celebration

This ain't a celebration, This ain't a celebration
Pissed off like a mutha it's just par for the course
This ain't a celebration
I've felt a lot of things but never felt remorse
This ain't a celebration
If you go digging inside my head watch out where you probe
This ain't a celebration

This ain't a celebration no this ain't a celebration
This ain't a celebration no this ain't a celebration
This ain't a celebration no this ain't a celebration
This ain't a celebration no this ain't a celebration
