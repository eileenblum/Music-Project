Well I just had to turn off the radio
But not before I heard thirteen songs about love in a row
Well I don't know what the next song's gonna be
But I know how the words are gonna go
They'll be singing "Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby I
love you so"
So won't everybody sing along cause her comes just another
love song

I need you like I need a hole in my head
I need someone to steal my money and wish I were dead
I need someone to always put me down
And everywhere I go she wants to hang around

Do you really even think dreams come true
Do you really even think you'll find something wonderful and
new
Do you really even think someone's waiting for you
Do you really even thiink that love is near
Do you really even think it's me dear
Do you really even think I want to hear-but I still say
I won't fall in love today

I need a chick who's got expensive taste
Who's not afraid of whose money she wastes
You expect me to buy you a diamond ring!
Well I suspect I'll buy you not a thing!

Well I could tell you you're the only one I love
And how your eyes sparkle like the stars above
And that I carry a picture of you in my heart
And as long as we live we'll never be apart
And that you're the most important person in my life
But I can't handle a girlfriend, how am I gonna handle a wife

Love-hate love-hate love-hate love-hate love-hate love-hate
love-hate love-hate
I love, love, love to hate you but I'd hate, hate, hate to
love you

I could promise all my love to you
But that would take me only a second or two
And if you're waiting to be my one and only
You're gonna find out what it's like to be awfully lonely
Your song was alright for awhile-But now your tune's gone out
of style

You want to cuddle and hug all night
But I'm going out with my friends tonight
And I don't need someone to act like my mother
I already have one-I don't need another

But she sure looks fine
After a bottle of wine
And she's out of sight
When my mind's not right
And I'll promise you anything dear
