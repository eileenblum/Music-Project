Easy easy, it's not easy
To say what I feel when nothing seems real
Not easy, it's not easy
To be someone's friend when the pain it never ends
Not easy, it's not easy
To keep up the fight when nothing turns out right

Easy I got to take it easy, I got to take it easy

Easy it's not easy to open your heart when love's torn it
apart
Easy it's not easy to hold your head high when you want to sit
and cry
Easy it's not easy to fall on your knees and say Lord help me
please
Easy I got to take it easy, Oh please, please, please easy

Easy easy it's not easy
Gotta gotta take it easy
It's not easy
It's never easy
