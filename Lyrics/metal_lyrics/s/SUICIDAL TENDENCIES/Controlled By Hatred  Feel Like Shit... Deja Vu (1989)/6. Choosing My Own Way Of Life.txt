My life
People don't try to tell me how to live my life
Don't try to fill me up with false hopes and lies
Show me the truth they say they'll show the light
Don't try to tell me I'm wrong when I know I'm right
Cause I don't need it, I don't need it, all I need is
Choosin' my own way, choosin' my own way of life

I'm mad as hell and I ain't gonna take it
And if you think I am I think you're fuckin' mistaken
Lock me in, but you can't lock me out
You can cut off my tongue, but I'll still scream and shout

Choosin' my own way of life-what up?
Cause I'm choosin' my own way of life

I'd rather have a penny than a heart of gold
I'd rather die young than do as I'm told
I was never one to turn down a fight
I gotta sleep all day so I can rage rage rage all night

Hell I don't need it, I don't need it, all I need is
My destination is my own decision
Living fast is my only religion
Trust no one cause I'm no fuckin' fool
Learn on my own I don't need no school

Choosin' my own way of life-what up
Choosin' my own way of life-straight out
Choosin' my own way of life-ain't it my life
Choosin' my own way of life-and I don't need nobody else
