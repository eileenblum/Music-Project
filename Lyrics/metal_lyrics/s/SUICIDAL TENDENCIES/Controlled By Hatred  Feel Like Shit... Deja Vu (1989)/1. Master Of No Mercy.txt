Fuck it!
He's a carrier of death, a stork in reverse
He blesses you with sickness
Cause love is a curse
The arsening in your Koolaid, the bomb in your mail,
He disappears in motion
But leaves a bloody trail

Drop to your knees, humble you pray
But can't put off your judgment day

There's a knock at your door, who could it be?
You got a new friend that's gonna set you free
He's making a list, he's checking it twice
No amount of money's gonna stop this vice

No mercy, no mercy, no mercy. You want mercy?
No fuckin' mercy! Oh no
With the wink of an eye, a snap of the finger
Now the smell of death is all that lingers
A doctor of death with a PhD, a specialist in pure misery

See you fucked with him even though you knew
And now your worst nightmares all come true
You scream and shout you beg and plead
But he's got your soul and that's all that he needs

He's the master, master of no mercy, no mercy, no mercy
