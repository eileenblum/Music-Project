I tried it your way, it got me nowhere
Now I'm doing it my way

I'm feeling good, good, good
I wanna get bad, bad, bad
Forgot about the hurt, hurt, hurt
It's driving me mad, mad, mad
I'm going on a trip, trip, trip
I'm headed on a ride, ride, ride
I'm floating out to sea, sea, sea
I'm going against the tide, tide, tide

I don't need your approval
You'll get no explanation
I don't care what your thinking
All be told it's a cyco thang

It's a cyco thang, it's a cyco thang
You can take those flowers and shove the
Cause there ain't no hippies at this party

I ran into a hill, hill, hill
But that's O.K. I'll climb, climb, climb
I'm never giving up, up, up
I still got all my time, time, time
I wanna take it fast, fast, fast
And then I'll take it slow, slow, slow
You can not make it stop, stop, stop
It's my time to go, go, go

I know what I'm doing
I know why I am here
I got my way of living
And I don't care if you understand
Right now nothing else matters
I forgot about the pain
i got something that's better
All be told it's a cyco thang

Cyco, cyco, cyco, cyco
Eine, meine, minnie, moe
This one's died, that one can go
It's how I do it in an intellectual find
Oh my, blowing up my mind
