A rat, a rat, I think I smell a rat
Don't stay stand there get the poison and the bat
Don't be squeamish, there's nothing wrong with that
A rat, a rat, got to kill a rat

No one likes a rat
How to kill a rat

Got to kill a rat

A rat, a rat, damn another rat
They're even worse than a little fluffy cat
Don't just stand there shoot 'em with a gat
A rat, a rat, how to kill a rat

No one likes a rat
How to kill a rat

well I may not have the best of manners
You'll never ever hear me say please
But I ain't here to mess with nobody
I'm just here to get myself some cheese

And I'm too smart to eat the rat poison
And mouse traps really are a bore
I'm looking for something of an extra challenge
Won't you call the exterminator

For fun I like to wait for him to ambush
Then I dash and slash and scamper cross the floor
Well I'm too quick for him, he'll never catch me
He'll just chase me till I'm tired and I'm sore

And I'm too smart to eat the rat poison
And mouse traps really are a bore
I'm looking for something of an extra challenge
Won't you call the exterminator

A rat, a rat, I think I smell a rat
Don't stay stand there get the poison and the bat
Don't be squeamish, there's nothing wrong with that
A rat, a rat, got to kill a rat
