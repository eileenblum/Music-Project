I never said I don't like religion, I just don't like TV
You say I got a bad attitude, around you that comes naturally
You say I need more compassion, I can forgive, I just can't forget
You say control my temper, but when I feel like shit, I feel like shit

Cause I was born to be-ST!
And it'll always be-ST!
Don't get down on me-ST!
Cause I'm down OG-ST!

Why can't I ask any questions of what you say is true
Am I supposed to believe anything or just everything said by you?
And how can you call me stupid when you don't understand what I say
And how can you call me evil, have you spoken to God today; and what did He say?

Cause I was born to be-ST!
And it'll always be-ST!
Don't get down on me-ST!
Cause I'm down OG-ST!

Not afraid to die-ST!
Just you promise me-ST!
You got to carry on-ST!
You gotta carry on-ST!

As long as your heart beats...pledge your allegiance!

You can call me ugly, but I still dress the way I choose
How you gonna judge me; you've never taken a walk in my shoes
Why don't you ever trust me when I'm smiling; is it a sin to have fun?
And why should I repent when there's nothin' wrong with anything that I've done

Cause I was born to be-ST!
It'll always be-ST!
Don't get down on me-ST!
Cause I'm down OG-ST!

Not afraid to die-ST!
You gotta promise me-ST!
You got to carry on-ST!
You gotta carry on-ST!

Pledge your allegiance
