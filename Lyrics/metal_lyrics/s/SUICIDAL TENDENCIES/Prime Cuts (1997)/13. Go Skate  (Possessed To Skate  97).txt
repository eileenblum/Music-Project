[Louiche Mayorga/Mike Muir]

Let's skate!

Seemed like such an innocent toy
He was an All-American boy
Got a skate at eight years old
Now the story can be told

Beware he's possessed to skate!

Skating takes him up in height
He's a pilot on a modern flight
See him flying through the air
Well if he don't land then he don't care

Cause he rips-he rips
When he skates-he skates
He never hesitates...
He's the wizard on the wheels
He's a modern gladiator and he ain't got no fears
So skate!

He shoots the pool like a launching pad
If it ain't insane then you can't get rad
Skating is all that's on his mind
Well he's skating radical all the time

Cause he rips-he rips
When he skates-he skates
He never hesitates...
He's the demon on the wheels
He's like a modern gladiator and he ain't got no fears
So skate!

Possessed to skate!

Looks like a magic carpet ride
Six foot airiels inverts backside
Optical illusion it must be
Well he redefines insanity

Cause he rips-he rips
When he skates-he skates
He never hesitates...
He's the wizard on the wheels
He's a modern gladiator and he ain't got no fears
So skate!

Doesn't understand why you'd wanna walk
Ain't got time to sit and talk
Used to be just like you and me
Now he's an outcast of society

Beware he's possessed to skate!

Possessed to skate!
Possessed to skate!
Possessed to skate!

Possessed to skate!
Possessed to skate!
Possessed to skate!

Possessed to skate!
