[Mike Muir/Mike Clark]

You talk your shit, but I ain't listenin'
And I don't do no ass kiss'n
Now here's the point that you've been missin'
No fucking problem at all

Ain't got no fucking problem
I got no fucking problem at all
Ain't got no fucking problem
I got no fucking problem at all

You ain't alive, if you ain't livin'
You waste your life whinin' and snivelin'
So buckle up cause now I'm drivin'
No fucking problem at all

Ain't got no fucking problem
I got no fucking problem at all
Ain't got no fucking problem
I got no fucking problem at all

No fucking problem at all
No fucking problem...

You think you know everything and more
But a surprise you'll be in for
Add it all up and you got no score
No fucking problem at all

You play the part, that I got no use
Don't mean a thing cause you got no juice
I live in a peace, I don't need a truce
No fucking problem at all

No fucking problem at all
No fucking problem at all
No fucking problem at all
No fucking problem...

I got a piece, but not to the puzzle
No time to think staring down a muzzle
I rise above and watch you fizzle
No fucking problem at all
