[Mike Muir]

What's he saying?

Yeah...just...a little...closer...

What's he doing?

It was, I know, by the corner...yeah
Sitting in the darkness...yeah
I didn't see it, but I know
It tries to hide sometimes, he he he
But it can't fool me...no
Because I had this thing, it's the way I see
The way I see when my eyes are closed
A conception of misconception
It's really quite, shall we say...
The really beautiful thing!
This is certain things that I've come to find
In my communications that never existed
Certain understandings that I've come to realize...yeah
But I don't believe it...no
Not for second!
It wasn't really truthful in the ways that I, that I, that I, that...
They're here right now...yeah

I wasn't meant to feel this...
I wasn't meant to feel this...
I wasn't meant to feel this way

I wasn't meant to feel this...

...

Counting on nothing............Uuuuuuuh...
The numbers get higher.........Ai ai ai ai ai...
Blinded by reason..............Uuuh ah uuuh ah...
You're asleep at the wheel.....Yeeeeeea...

Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...
Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...

Confused understanding.........
With a slip...for the hold.....Ai ai ai ai ai...
Squeeze past the pressure......
You're asleep at the wheel.....

A magical moment
Is it...too much of a good thing
Recycled in memory
Was it...too much of a good thing
Why can't you remember
Is it...too much of a good thing
Preserved in its danger
You're all asleep at the wheel...

Blank stare and a whisper, blank stare and a whisper
But who are the judges, who are you judging?
I thought you'd be different, I thought you'd be different
You're all asleep at the wheel, you're asleep at the wheel

A special assignment
Is it...too much of a good thing
Unlocked under pressure
Was it...too much of a good thing
Confined unforgivingness
Is it...too much of a good thing
A new kind of danger
You're all asleep at the wheel...

Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...
Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...

Hope in revision...............Uuuuuuuh...
Slight miscalculation..........Ai ai ai ai ai...
It all goes in stages..........Uuuh ah uuuh ah...
You're asleep at the wheel.....Yeeeeeea...

Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...
Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...

Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...
Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...

A blank stare and a whisper....
I thought you were different...
But who are you judging........
I thought you were different...

You're asleep at the wheel...
