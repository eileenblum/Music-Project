[Mike Muir/Mike Clark]

Taste like addiction
Smells like addiction
This is addiction

Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction

You haven't eaten in days and your gums are bleeding
Swearing to God the pipe's all you're needing
It's robbing or stealing or turning a trick
You do whatever it takes to suck on the Devil's dick

The more you feed it, the harder it is to tame
Taking in the Beast, playing it like a game
Lying to yourself saying the same old shit
"I don't need it, I just don't want to quit"

Taste like addiction
Smells like addiction
This is addiction

Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction

The hunger of addiction calls
There's nothing romantic about going through withdrawals
You're craving a sample well, here's just a taste
Picking and scratching the scabs on your face

Your life support system's a syringe
Killing a piece of your soul every time you binge
Praying to God and begging for forgiveness
Knowing damn well that you can't keep going on like this

This is addiction
Feed the addiction
This is addiction

Taste like addiction
Smells like addiction
This is addiction

I won't give up the plot but here's a few surprises
Muscle spasms, you're puking as your temperature rises
Led off to slaughter like a heard of cattle
The demons inside have won the battle

The Devil takes another soul to burn
What does it take for another fool to learn
The ritual's over as another one dies
The ritual begins as another one tries

It's a feeding time...
It's your feeding time
It's a feeding time...
It's your feeding time
It's a feeding time...
It's your feeding time
It's a feeding time...
Feeding...the monster!

Cursing at God and praying to die...
Cursing at God and praying to die...
Cursing at God and begging to die...
Cursing at God and begging to die...

Taste like addiction
Smells like addiction
This is addiction

Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction

Cursing at God and praying to die...

Cursing at God and praying to die...
