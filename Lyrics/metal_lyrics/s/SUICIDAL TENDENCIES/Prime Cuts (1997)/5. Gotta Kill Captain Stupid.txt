[Mike Muir/Mike Clark]

Ah damn, we got a lot of stupid people
Doing a lot of stupid things
Thinking a lot of stupid thoughts
And if you want to see one
Just look in the mirror

Gotta kill Captain Stupid, can't you see him
Today we start the new way, we're Suicidal
Gotta kill the old way, we'll make it better
Won't you join our mission, don't be stupid

Got to kill Captain Stupid
Got to kill Captain Stupid

Brothers killing brothers, what up with that?
Can't you see they're laughing, that ain't funny
Babies making babies, that ain't love
You just got screwed over, get some respect

Got to kill Captain Stupid
Got to kill Captain Stupid
Got to kill Captain Stupid
Got to kill Captain Stupid

Kill him, kill him, kill him
Gotta kill Captain Stupid
Kill him, kill him, kill him
Gotta kill Captain Stupid
Kill him, kill him, kill him
Gotta kill Captain Stupid
Kill him, kill him, kill him

And I don't understand why
People be bringin' Captain Stupid in their lives
Treating him like a superhero
Glorifying him when he ain't nothing but a superpunk
And you see, you're the one who's gonna have to stop him
'Cause you're the one that started him

Oh, what's that?
So now you say life sucks
Well, ninety-nine percent of it's
What you make of it...
So if your life sucks, you suck

What's that crap you're smoking, playing the fool
Waste your life for nothing, when you're something
What the hell you thinking, mind pollution
Got to get back control, it's your life fool

Got to kill Captain Stupid
Got to kill Captain Stupid
Got to kill Captain Stupid
Got to kill Captain Stupid

Kill him, kill him, kill him
Gotta kill Captain Stupid
I gotta, you gotta, I gotta
Gotta kill Captain Stupid
Kill him, kill him, kill him
Gotta kill Captain Stupid
I gotta, you gotta, I gotta
Gotta kill Captain Stupid

What's that now?
Ah, so you're scared to do something about it
Well, you better be scared not to do something about it
Because if you don't kill Captain Stupid
Captain Stupid gonna kill you
Got to kill Captain Stupid...fool
