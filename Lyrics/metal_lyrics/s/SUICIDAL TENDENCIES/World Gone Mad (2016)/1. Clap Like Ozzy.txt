Clap like Ozzy [3x]
Slam like a beast!
Clap like Ozzy [3x]

Battle of the masses confusion
Strength and belief are not an illusion
Embrace their laughter, to power on
Forget their faces, they'll soon gone
Wreck the walls that hold you back
Born again maniac!
It's your journey, you'll laugh and cry
But live to live, don't live to die

[Chorus:]
Death is coming, there's no place to hide
But while we're living, give it a hell of a ride
Time waits for no one, on that you can trust
So live life with purpose and you'll ride that rush

Clap like Ozzy [3x]
Slam like a beast!
Clap like Ozzy [3x]

Sucking on the kiss of death, funny how they think they're blessed
No horoscope or destiny can justify this agony
Silhouettes of lost potential when every day is not essential
Procrastinate the long good bye
Live to live, not live to die

[Chorus:]
Death is coming, there's no place to hide
But while we're living, give it a hell of a ride
Time waits for no one, on that you can trust
So live life with purpose and you'll ride that rush

Now take a secondâ¦catch your breath
Now think about what you wanna do
Don't let anyone stop you!
Now take a second
Catch your breathâ¦do that thing you do!

Do that thing you do! Do that thing you do!'
Do that thing you do! Do that thing you do!
Do that thing you do!

Clap like Ozzy [3x]
Slam like a beast!
Clap like Ozzy [3x]
Slam like a beast!
Clap like Ozzy [3x]
Slam like a beast!
