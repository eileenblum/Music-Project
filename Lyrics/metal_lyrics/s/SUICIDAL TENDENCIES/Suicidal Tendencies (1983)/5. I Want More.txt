Don't wanna pump nobody's gas   I want more
Don't wanna kiss my bosses ass  I want more
Don't wanna take the first job I find   I want more
Don't wanna dig coal out of a mine      I want more

Slaving in a factory a different kind of insanity
Feels like I'm locked in a cage
Working like a maniac, gave myself a heart attack
For a job that pays minimum wage

Don't wanna work at the golden arches   I want more
Don't wanna wash rich mans cars         I want more
Don't wanna be nobody's gardener        I want more
Don't wanna be a garbage man    I want more
