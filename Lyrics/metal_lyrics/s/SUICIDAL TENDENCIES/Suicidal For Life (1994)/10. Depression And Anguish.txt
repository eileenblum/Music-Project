Travels thru my veins poisoning my soul
Makes me hate myself, makes my anger blow
Suffocates the hope - eats away my will
Traps in all the hate - depression

And I don't wanna feel this way - but I can't stop it at all
And I don't wanna hurt no more - but I can't stop it at all
And I don't wanna lie here numb - but I can't stop it at all
And I don't wanna have to give in - but I can't stop it at all

Depression - it's got me I fought it - it whupped me
Depression and anguish the poison's inside me

Why can't I just make it end - I'm tired of feeling this way
Why can't I just let me be - I'm tired of feeling this way
Why can't I just have a break - I'm tired of feeling this way
Why can't I just go away - I'm tired of feeling this...

Depression and anguish the battle can't take this
Depression is poison the damage is all done
And I don't deserve this oh, no
And I don't wanna feel this no

Digs into my heart roots sprout thru my brain
Plants it's ugly thoughts growing wild again
Shuts all systems off, locks me in a haze
Traps in all the hate - depression

And I don't have the strength to scream, but here it comes again
And
I don't have the sense to cry, but here it comes again
And I don't have the will to fight, but here it comes again
And I don't have the choice to quit, and here it comes again

Depression and anguish the battle can't take this
Depression is poison the damage is done
Depression it's got me I fight it but why me
Depression and anguish the poison's inside me
