For a moment it seems
That this moment won't end
So I pray for the end
Wasting my time, waiting for mercy
You sold me out just for the joy of hurting me
So I pray for the end

Rest my child and be still
Tortured thoughts become real

My heart stops such a rush
Causes me to go numb
Wonder what next will come
Sitting alone in my misery
I'd like to mike.

What more can I do?
What else could I do?
Fucked up feelings - kill
What else could I do?
What else can you do?
What else could I do?

I lost again, once again
I don't know where to start
Now I'm back at the start
You lied when you told me it would save me
Now taste the fucked up feelings you gave me
I lost again, once again
