I leach off you when things are good
I'm there to kick you when you're down
But when you need me I'm not there
You're such a bummer when you're down

Let's see - what you need's a friend
They say - that all you need's a friend
I know - what you need's a friend
Hello - I could use a...
What you need's a friend - all you need's a friend

And of course we always share
So what I want you better give
And what is yours is mine
And what is mine you can't have

I'd do anything for you - anything
Just you ask me and it's done - anything
But everything has its price
You should have read the fine print ha-ha!
Friend. Hi, friend. Friend. It's me friend!

What you need's a friend. All you need's a friend
What you need's another friend. You never can have
enough friends. Don't you wanna be my friend?
I'm so glad you're my friend. Sucker

Of course you know who I am
And I'll never let you forget
You are stuck with me forever
Or until you have nothin' more to give
