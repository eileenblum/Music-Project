No bullshit

I hate the things you believe
Your truth is built upon lies
I can't believe in a trend
I won't be living no lie

No bullshit

I hate everything you say
I ain't got time for your shit
I refused to be played
I won't be living no lie

No bullshit! That's where I stand
No bullshit! That's how I'm living my life

No bullshit

I hate the way that you are
I can't believe in your ways
I refuse to be hip
I won't be living your lie
