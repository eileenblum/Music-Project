Yea won't you come and get me
I can feel your fear
Yea so if you think you're lucky
I'll be right here!
Ain't no right if there ain't no wrong
And you're wrong to think I'll do you right
Yea I'm fucked up baby, fucked up just right

Yea won't you come and stop me
I can sense your fear
Yea so if you think you've got it
I'll be right there
Ain't no bad if there ain't no good
And it's good to know I get you bad
Yea I'm fucked up baby, fucked up just right

Fucked up just right fucked up that's right

Yea won't you come and hate me
I can smell your fear
Yea so if you're feeling crazy, I'll be right there
Ain't no hot if there ain't no cool
And it's cool to know I get you hot
Yea I'm fucked up baby, fucked up just right

Yea won't you come and hurt me
I can taste your fear
Yea so if you got a death wish
I'll be right here
Ain't no right if there ain't no wrong
And you're wrong to think I'll do you right
Yea I'm fucked up baby, fucked up just right

It makes no fuck'n sense that makes no sense to me
Can't make no fuck'n sense that makes no sense to me

You make no fuck'n sense that make no sense to me

Fucked up just right!
