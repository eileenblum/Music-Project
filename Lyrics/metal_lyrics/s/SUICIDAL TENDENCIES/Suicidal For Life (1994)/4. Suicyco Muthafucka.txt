Tippy toe thru broken dreams
There goes a little fucked up piece of my brain
Didn't need it anyhow, didn't use it anyhow no way!
My minds been soakin' up so much shit...
now it's cured not like healthy
But cured like marinated dried out fuckin piece of meat

Suicyco muthafucka, suicyco muthafucka
Don't take no shit from no one
Suicyco muthafucka, suicyco muthafucka
Said if you ain't suicidal, you ain't shit

Snap crackle pop it just stopped being funny
Don't know what was said
But don't know if I like it
There's always something funny that just ain't funny
I ain't no muthafucker, never had one never really wanted one
But that don't mean your daughter's safe
Guess that makes me a daughter fucker
Running thru a place I swear I'd never go smash it wow
Never know it could be so much fun,
I remember it now
I remember it now... just like it never was
There's always something funny that just ain't funny

Suicyco muthafucka, suicyco muthafucka
Don't take no shit from no one
Suicyco muthafucka, suicyco muthafucka
I'm suicidal for life

I got to think in a different way
The old way got me nowhere
The new way got me somewhere
But nowhere where I wanted to go or where I belong
I gotta go back to the old way
I tired of people looking at me funny
Not knowing who was in control and who wasn't
Yea I'm not and that's why I'm in control!
Yea fuck it up, fuck it up again,
makes things a hell of a lot simpler
Suicyco muthafucka
