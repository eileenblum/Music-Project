Oh yea, back again. Hope you've enjoyed our little excursions.
Tipping, toeing thru the mind of a muthafucka that need's
a little fuck'n stomping on. Yea, but don't take it wrong,
see we ain't trying to tell you how to think, we're just
trying to get you to think. And we ain't trying to control
nobody, we want the people (individually speaking) to be
in control, to know who they are and what they want to be.
Yea, and question authority, what the fuck but not for sake
of argument, but because you took the time to analyze it
and you found a better fuck'n way, not just a fuck'n excuse
to complain. And beware of people who try to use you as
statistic to back their claims of power, that use you simply
as a vehicle to get themselves where they want to, with no
reference to your best interest except for their disclaimer
that their best interest is your best interest.
And remember... cool is only 3 letters away from fool!
