Evil evil evil
You make me feel so
Evil evil evil
You make me wanna get

I tried to shield my soul from you
But your evil sleeped on thru
Cause you're evil
I tried to hide in thought but I always end up caught
Thinking about getting evil evil
I don't know why I fight this feeling
When I should take it out on you

Evil evil evil
You make my thoughts turn to
Evil evil evil
You make me wanna get

Delaying the suspense, destroy all innocence
And my thoughts turn to evil evil
Cooking up the hate du jour, the symptom is the cure
And I'm gonna get evil evil
It's the last thing that I wanted
But it's the first thing I should get
Make mine evil locked in evil

As my resistance is spent my actions get all bent
And it's time to get evil evil
My morals reach the junction
Where my conscience stops its function
And I'm gonna get evil evil
It's the last thing I was thinking
So it's thing that I'll do

Evil evil evil evil
