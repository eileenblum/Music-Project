You talk your shit, but I ain't listenin'
And I don't do no ass kiss'n
Now here's the point that you've been missing
No fuck'n problem at all

Ain't got no fuck'n problem, I got no fuck'n problem at all

You ain't alive - if you ain't livin'
You waste your life whining and sniveling
So buckle up cause now I'm driving
No fuck'n problem at all

You think you know everything and more
But a surprise you'll be in for
Add it all up and you got no score
No fuck'n problem at all

You play the part - that I got no use
Don't mean a thing cause you got no juice
I live in peace I don't need a truce
No fuck'n problem at all

I got a piece but not to the puzzle
No time to think staring down a muzzle
I rise above and watch you fizzle
No fuck'n problem at all
