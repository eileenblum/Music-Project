I wouldn't mind.

Every messed up feeling has its day
Every screwed up person gets revenge
Every jacked up moment will come back
Every twisted thought will have its shot

I wouldn't mind seeing you shaken with fear
I wouldn't mind hearing you screaming in pain
I wouldn't mind hearing you cry like a baby
I wouldn't mind hearing you beggin' for your life

Makes me feel the joy rise thru my soul
Makes me think that there's hape after all
Makes me wanna shout and jump for joy
Makes me feel the purpose after all

I wouldn't mind seeing you shaken with fear
I wouldn't mind seeing you screamin' in pain
I wouldn't mind seeing you dead!
I wouldn't mind.I wouldn't mind.
I wouldn't mind seeing blood squirting from your veins
I wouldn't mind hearing you beg for your life
I wouldn't mind.I wouldn't mind seeing you dead
