My mind kept a freakin'...
My mind kept a freakin'...
My mind kept a freakin'...
My mind kept a freakin'...

All night long...
All night long...
All night long...
All night long...

My mind kept a freakin' all night long...
My mind kept a freakin' all night long...

My mind kept a freakin' my mind kept a freakin'...
My mind kept a freakin' all night long...

My mind kept a freakin' all night long...
My mind kept a freakin' all night long...

Hey Charlie Monroe
I want you to know
You are my hero

I was so blind
Till you gave me a sign
You opened up my mind

Charlie Monroe...

Now I can see so clear
Left behind all my fear
Following the voices I hear

From Charlie Monroe...

My life is, bad break after bad break!
My life was, mistake after mistake!
But then you, you taught me how to let go!
Thank you, Charlie Monroe... a modern hero!

Hey Charlie Monroe
I sent you more dough
I need your help bro

I've hit another wall
A long and painful fall
Why won't you take my call?

Charlie Monroe...

Times shouldn't be this tough
Life shouldn't be this rough
Why won't you bail me out?

Charlie Monroe, ex hero...

[guitar solo]

The time has come!
The time has come!
The time has come!
The time has come!

Oh, silly me, I forgot you don't speak backwards
Well let's just say; you're in for a big surprise, ha ha ha ha...

Wake up Charlie Monroe
How quick the times can go?
You reap what you sow
Goodnight Charlie Monroe

You're the worst kind of dope
A sad pathetic joke
Give me the lynching rope
Where's the tree and the rope?

Awake for your wake, your wake
You sick pathetic fake, sick fake
It's time that you should know
You're dead, Charlie Monroe

Enjoy what you got!
Death to the despot!
Charlie Monroe is dead!
Long live the new Charlie Monroe!

My mind kept a freakin' my mind kept a freakin'...
My mind kept a freakin' all night long...

My mind kept a freakin' my mind kept a freakin'...
My mind kept a freakin' all night long...

My mind kept a freakin' all night long...
My mind kept a freakin' all night long...

My mind kept a freakin' all night long...
Charlie Monroe is dead!
My mind kept a freakin' all night long...
Long live the new Charlie Monroe!

My mind kept a freakin' all night long...
My mind kept a freakin' all night long...

My mind kept a freakin' all night long...
Charlie Monroe is dead!
My mind kept a freakin' all night long...
Long live the new Charlie Monroe!

My mind kept a freakin' all night long...
My mind kept a freakin' all night long...
