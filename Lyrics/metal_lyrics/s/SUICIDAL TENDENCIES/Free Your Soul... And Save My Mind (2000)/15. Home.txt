[Mike Muir / Dean Pleasants]

[guitar solo]

To feel the sun when the sky says rain
How can you explain?
Can you explain?

To feel your lips when you're not there
But I don 't care...
I don't care...

You make the water taste like wine
When you're on my mind...
Always on my mind...

[guitar solo]

It's been so long and I've gone so far
I don't know where you are...
Tell me where you are...

But in my thoughts there is a mist
Do you even exist?
Do you exist?

Do you even exist?!

[guitar solo]

If you find me take me home...
I've lost my way and I want to get home...

Home...
Home...
Home...
Home...

I've wondered lands so full of sin
I can't even begin...
I won't even begin...

I've read the book and prayed at church
And still I search...
But I still search...

And I'm still searching!

[guitar solo]

If you find me take me home...
I'm scared and lonely and I want to go home...
I'm so tired and I need to get home...
Won't you please help me find my home...

Home...
Home...
Home...
Home...

There is a void inside my soul
And it's taken its toll...
It's taken its toll...

At night I stare off into the stars
And I don't know how far...
Is it really that far?

Home...

I can hear your voice such a calming sound
I've come around...
Are you around?

And when I sleep I'll dream of you
And what I'll do...
When I get back to you...

If I get back to you!

[guitar solo]

If you find me take me home...
I'm scared and lonely and I want to get home...
I'm lost confused, where is my home...
Won't you please help me find my way home...
If you find me take me home...
If you find me please take me...

Home...
