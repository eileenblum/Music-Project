[Mike Muir / Mike Clark]

[guitar solo]

Sometimes I wish my head would just explode!

Self-self-self, I wanna...
Self-self-self, I gotta...
Self-self-self, I'm gonna... self destruct!

Self-self-self, I wanna...
Self-self-self, I gotta...
Self-self-self, I'm gonna... self destruct!

I can't fight this urge, to self destruct!
I can't seem to stop this urge, to self destruct!

Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!

I got the urge to self destruct!
I need the urge to self destruct!
I got the urge to self destruct!
Can't stop the urge to self destruct!

[guitar solo]

Self-self-self, I wanna...
Self-self-self, I gotta...
Self-self-self, I'm gonna... self destruct!

I can't fight this urge, to self destruct!
I can't seem to stop this urge, to self destruct!

Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!

I got the urge to self destruct!
I fight the urge to self destruct!
I got the urge to self destruct!
Can't stop this urge to self destruct!

[guitar solo]

Where is the sunshine of my mind?
There is no sunshine in my mind!
How can I be everything to everyone?
Where is the sunshine of my mind?
When I don't want to be anything to anyone!
There is no sunshine in my mind!

I just wanna make the pounding in my head freakin' stop!

Self-self-self, self destruct!
Self-self-self, self destruct!
Self-self-self, I wanna... self destruct!

I can't fight this urge, to self destruct!
I can't seem to stop this urge, to self destruct!

Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!

I got the urge to self destruct!
Can't fight this urge to self destruct!
I got the urge to self destruct!
Can't stop this urge to self destruct!

[guitar solo]

Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self de-struct!
Self destruct!

No...
