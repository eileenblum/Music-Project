I hate Pop Songs
They think they're clever, I think they're wrong
I hate bubble gum punk
They got the look but the music is junk

I hate anyone that savors
The foul stench of this months flavor
And hell is a place that you can go
If you like disco or techno

Pop songs
Pop songs
Pop songs
Pop songs

Hi boys and girls
come on and get happy

I hate Puff Daddy
And his friend the dead fatty
I hate the grateful dead
But I'll be grateful when the rest of them are dead

I feel like I'm on pins and needles
How many bands can rip off the Beatles?
And every day there is another
Band that got big by playing a cover

I hate pop songs
I hate pop songs
I hate pop songs
I hate pop songs

lala, lala, lalalalalalalala

I hate Celine Dion
Titanic Song makes me wanna moan
And if I hear another love ballad
I think I'm gonna have to toss my salad and

I hate teen idols
they got signed by old farts with fancy titles
There's nothing worse at least to me
Than stupid lyrics with a lame ass melody

I hate pop songs, pop songs
I hate pop songs, pop songs
I hate pop songs, pop songs
I hate pop songs, pop songs

Pop songs, I hate pop songs
Pop songs, I hate pop songs
