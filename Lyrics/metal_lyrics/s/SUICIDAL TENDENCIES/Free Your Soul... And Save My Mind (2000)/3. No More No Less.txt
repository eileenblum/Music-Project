No More No Less
It takes more than A just making a fist,
It takes more than just getting pist
You gotta make your stand and resist
You Gotta Resist or You'll cease to exist
No More, No Less

[Chorus]

No more No less
No more No freaking less
No more Not a Penny less
We're taking what we deserve,
Ain't setting for second best

How can you see what I see
when everybody's coming down on me
How can you twist the list
and expect me not resist Ha ha ha
How can you explain all the pain
that goes terrorizing my brain?
Now you'll face a man that understands
that violence is the best plan its cyco time again!

[Chorus]

No more No less
No more No freaking less
No more Not a Penny less
We're taking what we deserve,
Ain't setting for second best
No more No less
No more No freaking less
No more Not a Penny less
No more No Less!

How can you call it cheating
if we're too smart to get caught
Come on everybody
let's show them what the fuck we got
Its time to get cyco
let's tear this mutha out
Anytime, anywhere, without a doubt, we're gonna take you out!
