[Mike Muir / Mike Clark]

I got mutation baby...

I'm sinking inside a dream
Cemented in make believe
I'm pointing, why can't they see, have you got mutation baby?
The demons inside a tree

So have you been mutated baby?

I got mutation!

I'm blazing unchartered paths
Challenging the ghosts of the past
Confusing the sacred oath, I got mutation baby!
Antagonize the caustic host

Mutation!

I got mutation!
I got mutation!
I got mutation!
I got mutation!
I got mutation!

I got mutation baby...
I got mutation baby...
I got mutation baby...
I got mutation baby...

Have you got mutation?
Have you got mutation?
Have you got mutation?
Have you got...

Mutation!

I got mutation baby...

The essence that anger builds
The terror that knows no guilt
Sensation that has no bounds, have you got mutation baby?
When the spirits all make the rounds

Have you got mutation?

Yes, I got mutation!
How do you make, how do you break?
Yes, I got mutation!
How do you break, how do you make?

Have you got mutation?

How do you make, how do you break?
I've gone mutation!
How do you break, how do you make?
Yes, I've gone mutation!

How do you make, how do you break?
I've gone mutation!
How do you break, how do you make?
Yes, I've gone mutation!

I got mutation!
