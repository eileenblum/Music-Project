[Mike Muir / Mike Clark]

Let me see who's bored...
Let 'em know you're bored...
Let 'em know you're bored...

All aboard the bored...
Yea we know you're bored...
Yea we know you're bored...

The children of the...

Children of the bored...
Children of the bored...
Children of the bored...
Children of the...

The slogan on the TV says just do it
We say just screw it
You say you're living happy ever after
Pardon my laughter
I've heard it all before, that sound of silence
Here comes the violence
Failure to you and your expectations
Economic incarceration

Children of the bored...
Children of the bored...
Children of the bored...
Children of the...

It's plain to see that you can't see my reason
Can you see my reason?
It's plain to see that you've sold out to their treason
Sold out to the treason
You got the answers to the questions that don't matter
Questions that don't matter
Now try to explain my pain when my brain splatters
Splatters, splatters, splatters

[guitar solo]

Just admit you're bored...

Let 'em know you're bored...
Let 'em know you're bored...
Let 'em know you're bored, bored, bored, bored, bored, bored!

Yea you know we're bored...
Yea you know we're bored...
Yea you know we're bored...
