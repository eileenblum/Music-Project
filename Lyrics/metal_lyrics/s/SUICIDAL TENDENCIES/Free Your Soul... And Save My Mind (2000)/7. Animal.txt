A ha ha ha ha...

Animal!
Animal!

I'm an animal, an animal, an animal!
I'm an animal, an animal, an animal!

Everything you do just makes me wanna bite you...

Every little thing...
Every little thing...
Every little thing...
Every little thing...

Every little thing, that you go and do
Makes me wanna give it wrong back to you
Every little thing, that you do and say
Raises up the anty of the price you'll pay

I'm an animal, an animal, an animal... I love to fight!
I'm an animal, an animal, an animal... All day and night!
I'm an animal, an animal, an animal... I can bark and bite!
I'm an animal, an animal, an animal... Yea you heard that right, ya!

And everything you do just makes me wanna bite you...

Every little thing...
Every little thing...
Every little thing...
Every little thing...

Every little thing, that you go and do
Makes me wanna give it wrong back to you
Every little thing, that you do and say
Raises up the anty of the price you'll pay

And everything you do just makes me wanna bite you...

Animal!
Animal!
Animal!
Animal!

I'm an animal, an animal, an animal...
I'm an animal, an animal, an animal...

And everything you do just makes me wanna bite you...
