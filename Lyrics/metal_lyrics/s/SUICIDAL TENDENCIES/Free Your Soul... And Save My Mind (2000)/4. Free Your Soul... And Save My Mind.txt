[Mike Muir / Mike Clark]

[guitar solo]

December 27th, 4:30 in the fucking morning. Sleep? Ain't no fucking sleep here, not with all these fucked up thoughts bouncing around in my fucking head, destroying every fucking thing it touches. Yea, this shit's been going on too long, but it's all coming to a fucking end, right now!

Free your soul and save my mind
Look in my heart and you will find
All the pain that lives in you
Is breeding inside me too!

Free your soul and save my mind
I'm begging you to be so kind
There's so much power in your frown
Your sadness just brings me down!

What you gonna do?
If they won't give it back
What you gonna do?
When I ain't got your back!

Free your soul and save my mind
You wish you were dead, I feel like I'm dying
If this is the price you pay for love
I feel sorry for God up above!

Free your soul and save my mind
Everything I can think of I'm trying
What does it take to make you listen?
Can't you see your soul is missing?

What you gonna do?
If they won't give it back
What you gonna do?
When there's no turning back
What you gonna do?
If you can't get it back
What you gonna do?

So what you gonna do?
So what the fuck you gonna do?

Free your soul and save my mind
Look in my heart and you will find
All the pain that breeds in you
Is fucking killing me too!

Hide behind your emptiness
Your soul is buried in an abyss
To make room for all the lies you believe
Your goodness is forced to leave

Free your soul and save my...
Free your soul and save my...
Free your soul and save my...
Free your soul and save my...

Free your soul and save my mind!

[guitar solo]

Free your soul and save my mind!
Free your soul and save my mind...
Free your soul and save my mind!
Free your soul and save my mind...

Free your soul and save my mind!
Free your soul and save my mind...
Free your soul and save my mind!
Free your soul and save my mind...

Free your soul and save my mind!
