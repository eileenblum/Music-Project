[Mike Muir / Mike Clark]

[guitar solo]

Give me back the beat...
Bringing back the beat...
Give me back the beat...
Give me back the beat...

My tears, a declaration
Emotional perspiration
Denial, another dead end
Admittance, it never should have been

I got to get away!
I...
I got to get away!
I...

Bring me back the beat!
How did I get this monkey on my back?
Bring me back the beat!

Heartbreak, it's what I plan on
Regret, faithful companion

I got to get away!
I...
I got to get away!
Bullenium...

Gotta-gotta-I got to get away!
I...
Gotta-gotta-I got to get away!
Bullenium...

Bringing back the beat...
Bringing back the beat...

The highs don't seem to get so high, but the lows can sure get low
The lies get more pervasive with the bullshit's steady flow
Bringing back the beat...

Another year has come and gone, but what has really changed?
You cannot put a price on the heartache that I've gained
Bringing back the beat...

I seem to be more accepting of the things that don't get done
And oh so quick to concede all the battles that should have been won
Bringing back the beat...

Oh Lord, please help me!
Here comes, the new bullenium!
Oh Lord, please help us!
We're in, the new bullenium!

[guitar solo]

Bringing back the beat...
Give me back the beat...

Bullenium!

Give me back the beat...

Bullenium!
