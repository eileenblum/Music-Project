[Suicidal Tendencies]

You got, I want
You got, I want
You got, I want
You got, I want

I can't tell you why you're crying
I can only tell you to wipe your tears away
You see something that's inside me
I think I'll save it for a rainy day
I don't need no constitution
To tell me what is wrong and right for me
C'mon take it little honey
I want to tell you baby what you see

[CHORUS]
You're gonna take al lthat I'm giving, yea
What's the matter can't you see
You know I'm taking, you're not giving
Oh baby, baby, please please please please

I'm not sure what I told you
I'm only sure that it wasn't true
You said I told you that I love you
Well there's a thousand others just like you
You said I used to be romantic
Well now I don't need to be anymore
You want to talk about commitment
I think I want to show you the door

[CHORUS]

You got, I want
You got, I want
You got, I want
You got, I want

Love me, hold me tonight

I can't tell you why you're crying
I can only tell you to wipe your tears away
You see something that is inside me
I think I'll save it for a rainy day
I don't need no constitution
To tell me what is wrong and right for me
C'mon take it little honey
I want to tell you baby what you see

You got, I want, I want now
