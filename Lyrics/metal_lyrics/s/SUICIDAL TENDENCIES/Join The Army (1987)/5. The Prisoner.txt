[Louiche/Mike Muir]

You're the prisoner locked in your cell
You're living in your personal hell
Invisible bars block your view
They don't exist except for you

Free, why can't you see how easily
You could break those bars right down
New freedom found, travel around
And find out exactly why
Give it a try, living the lie
And try to solve the final clue
See if it's true, found out just who
The real enemy is you

Don't be afraid
Don't be deceived
A new world for you
Can be conceived

Don't tell me 'bout how the world isn't fair
How you'll live your life how you choose
I don't want to hear another excuse
How it ain't your fault when you lose

And you're the prisoner
Your mind's diseased, my mind is cured

I was the prisoner but never again
My worst enemy is now my friend
Brainwashed, you'll probably believe
I gave it up for a new reprieve

Free, why can't you see how easily
You could break those bars right down
New freedom found, travel around
And find out exactly why
Give it a try, living the lie
And try to solve the final clue
See if it's true, found out just who
The real enemy is you

You say you're political
I say, "Screw that, you're just a fool."
