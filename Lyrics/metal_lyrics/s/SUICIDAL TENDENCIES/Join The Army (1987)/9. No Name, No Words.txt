[Louiche/Mike Muir]

I close my eyes, yet I still see
I can not hide from what's inside of me
I hear my thoughts, but they're not clear
And now I tremble with fear

[CHORUS]
No one can tell me what's sane
You see the tears I cry
But you can't feel my pain
No title can classify me
I'm a person with feelings
A number I refuse to be

Don't try to live my life
You cannot talk for me
Now I'm on the brink, brink of insanity

Sometimes I stare into space
I try to think about another place
Where happiness I'll see
I'll find a place for me and find some sanity

Sometimes I look at you
And I wonder what will I do
Will my mind stay intact
How will I react, will I do any harm to you

Open my eyes, but I can't see
Maybe the hatred has blinded me
There's not a sound, yet I still hear
Now the pain is so clear

[CHORUS]

Sometimes I stop to think
Or maybe my thinking just stops
Doesn't matter anyway
No one hears what I say, I'm on the brink of insanity

Well I know him but not his name
In everyone, yet not the same
Play with the cards i'm dealt, worse I never felt
I'm playing a sick man's game
