[Rocky George/Mike Muir]

Welcome to the year of the cyco
It's been a long, long wait
Welcome to a modern blitzkrieg
With peace, I can't relate
Welcome to death now you'll love it
Once in a lifetime treat
Say goodbye to peace and order
You and my terror will meet

My best friend is misery
My girlfriend is insanity
My father is revenge

My love for you I must confess
With my knife you passed the test
I'll love you till the end

Evacuation of my mind
In my body no heart you'll find
Where there's death I lurk

Empty stare incoherent
Screams of pain, love to hear it
Take pride in my work

They say two wrongs don't make a right
Well maybe that is true
But I can't describe the feeling I get
When I take revenge on you

Forgiveness is the key to destruction
But you can't open my door
Repentance, you're indecision
I hesitate no more
Tradition is the root of all evil
So now I water the tree
Salvation, an all-time sentence
So now I walk away free

Two wrongs don't make a right
But they make me feel a whole lot better
