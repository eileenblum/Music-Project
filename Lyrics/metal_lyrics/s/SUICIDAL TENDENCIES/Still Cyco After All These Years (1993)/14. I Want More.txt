[Mike Muir/Mayorga]

In times of trouble fall to my knees and I look to the sky
Cause me, me I want more
The classification of our heart's a sin
Cause me, me I want more

Don't wanna pump nobody's gas-I want more
Don't wanna kiss my boss's ass-I want more
Don't wanna take the first job I find-I want more
Don't wanna dig coal out of a mine-I want more

[CHORUS]
Slaving in a factory, a different kind of insanity
Feels like I'm locked in a cage
Working like a maniac, gave myself a heart attack
For a job that pays minimum wage

Don't wanna work at the golden arches-I want more
Don't wanna was no rich man's cars-I want more
Don't wanna be nobody's gardener-I want more
Don't wanna be no garbage man-I want more

[CHORUS]

I sit and reflect about all that I've learned and all that I've seen
Cause me me I want more
The memories come and they go away
Cause me me I want more

Don't wanna pump nobody's gas-I want more
Don't wanna kiss my boss's ass-I want more
Don't wanna take the first job I find-I want more
Don't wanna dig coal out of a mine-I want more
I want more
