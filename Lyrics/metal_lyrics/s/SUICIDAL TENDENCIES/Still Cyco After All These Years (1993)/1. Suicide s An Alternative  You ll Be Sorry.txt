Sick of people-no one's real
Sick of chicks-they're all bitches
Sick of you-you're too hip
Sick of life-it sucks

Suicide's an alternative

Sick of trying-what's the point
Sick of talking-no one listens
Sick of listening-it's all lies
Sick of thinking-just end up confused
sick of myself-don't wanna live
Sick and tired-and no one cares
Sick of life-it sucks

Sick of politics-for the rich
Sick of power-only oppresses
Sick of government-full of tyrants
Sick of school-total brainwash
Sick of music-top-40 sucks
Sick of myself-don't wanna live
Sick and tired-and no one cares
Sick of life-it sucks

Suicide's an alternative

Sick of life-it sucks
Sick and tired-and no one cares
Sick of myself-don't wanna live
Sick of living-I'm gonna die

Suicide's an alternative

Well I've got a little story to tell
About a little red-assed punk that came from Hell
He said Satan's been looking especially for me
He said Satan's got a paper gonna set your body free
He said power and glory, bitches for screwin'
All in your name and all for you today

Oh yeah
Power and fame, all in your name
All the gold and bitches you ever could have

Oh yeah
You'll have power, fame, all in your name
All that you want, all that you need
Everything that you ever could read
Anything anything that you ever would need
Well sign the paper that's all you do
Sign the paper it's ready too
Anything there it's all for you
Well this is all you got to do

So I looked him in the eye and I said
"Fuck you you little red-assed goblined-breathed horned-hed motherfucker!"
Cause I don't care too much about gold
And I don't really give a fuck about what you've been told
And I don't really care for anyone looking after me
Cause I'm a meaner son of a bitch than that fuck ever could be
