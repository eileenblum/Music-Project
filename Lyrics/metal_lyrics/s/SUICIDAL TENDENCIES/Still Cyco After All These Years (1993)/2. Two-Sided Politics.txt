I'm not anti-society, society is anti-me
I'm not anti-religion, religion is anti-me
I'm not anti-anything, I just wanna be free

Fascist state, no freedom
Unless you control yourself
Use self-expression, lose your freedom
You're undesirable, go straight to jail

Kill someone in a war
Get a medal, you're a hero
Protect yourself in everyday war
You're a minority, you go straight to jail

I'm not anti, anti's anti-me
I'm not anti-government, government's anti-me
I'm not anti-politics, politics is anti-me
I'm not anti-anything, I just wanna be free

Innocent, never guilty
High-class lawyer, you are rich
If you're poor, must be guilty
Even if innocent, you go straight to jail
