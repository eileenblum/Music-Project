Father forgive me for I know not what I do
I tried everything but I'll leave it up to you
I don't want to live, I don't know why
I don't have no reasons, I just want to die

[CHORUS]
I'm a suicidal failure, I've got to get some help
I have suicidal tendencies but I can't kill myself

I'm tired of this way of life, my patience has expired
I'm barely just 20 but my life I will retire
I went down to a rifle store, I bought myself a gun
I point it at my head but I couldn't get the job done

[CHORUS]

I took all my mother's sleeping pills
I jumped off a freeway bridge
I drank three kinds of poison
And drove my car off a ridge
I beat myself with a bat
Put a noose around my head
I overdosed on heroin
But I'm still not dead

[CHORUS]

Death may not be the answer
It can't be all that great
But me I'm not into living
With life I can't relate
By some masochistic reasoning I think that it will be fun
I want to start my second life now
So shoot me with your gun

[CHORUS]

I'm looking forward-suicidal
I'm really bored-suicidal
You wanna die-suicidal
Then die-suicidal

Honestly-suicidal
At the game-suicidal
At my school-suicidal
At the bar-suicidal

Suicidal
Suicidal
Suicidal
Suicidal
