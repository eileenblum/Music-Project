Tense atmosphere in the air
Riot written everywhere
Riot squads coming from over there
Time to go home if you're square

[CHORUS]
Riot squad bas their heads
Kick their ass until they're dead
I want to be a fascist pig
Love to fight what a thrill
We don't stop until we kill
I want to be a fascist pig

Throw a bottle in the air
Put them up to their dare
We'll just laugh while they stare
Let them hit me see if I care

[CHORUS]

Get attacked by them
You'll never heal
They'll rob your conscience
Your sanity they'll steal
They'll beat your brains until they spill
That's the fascist favorite meal

[CHORUS]
