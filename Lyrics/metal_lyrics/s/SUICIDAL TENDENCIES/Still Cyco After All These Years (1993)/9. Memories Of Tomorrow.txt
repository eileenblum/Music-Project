B-1 bombers in flight
Trident missiles in the air
MX missiles underground
Protect us till we're dead

[CHORUS]
Memories of tomorrow-too late for sorrow

Push the button
Kiss goodbye the nuclear arsenal
A-bombs flying off their ramps
Nuclear bombs explode

[CHORUS]

Radioactive people
Search for medicine
Pray for shelter
Kill for food

[CHORUS]

Mass starvation
Contaminated water
Destroyed cities
Mutilated bodies

[CHORUS]

I'll kill myself
I'd rather die
If you could see in the future
You'd know why

Memories of tomorrow
