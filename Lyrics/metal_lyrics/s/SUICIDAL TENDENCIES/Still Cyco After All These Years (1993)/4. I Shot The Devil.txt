I shot Reagan, I shot Sadat
I'm gonna shot you dead in heaven you'll rot
You're gonna rot in heave, hear an angel's voice
You're too bad for hell, although it's you first choice

Rot in heave, you're too bad for hell
Rot in heaven, cause you're forgiven in hell

I shot Lennon, I shot the Pope
I shot the devil, now you ain't got no hope
You're gonna rot in heaven, hear an angel's voice
You're too bad for hell although it's your first choice
