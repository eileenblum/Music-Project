[Muir]

Pressures charging try to stall - Pound my head against the wall
I've been feelings this for way to long
I've been fighting this for way too long
Something's bout to happen - get out of my way
Something's better happen - get out of my way

[Chorus:]
Scream and shout - let it out
Rip it out - Scream and shout
Scream and shout - let it out
Break it out - Scream and out
Scream out [5X's]

Hypnotized, Analyzed - A sorry attempt to sanitize
When I've been feelings this for way too long
When I've been fighting this for way too long
I guess I'll do it my way - your's don't work
I'm left to do it my way - your's don't work

[Chorus]
