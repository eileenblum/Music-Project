[Muir]

I'm harmless won't you help me
I'm sickness only you can heal me
I promise that I always be there
I'm naked under my clothes

I'm feeling naked
I feel naked

My heart's bleeding why don't you help me
I'm screaming but still nobody hears

Helpless and naked
Helpless and naked
Helpless and naked
Naked, naked, naked, I'm naked

I'm harmless till I hate you
I'm tasteless that's why I'm with you
I'm sensless even on payday
I'm naked under my clothes

You saw me naked, you saw me naked

I'm saddned by all my failures
It's a good thing
I real good things I don't try

I miss you whenever I'm with you
Cause I thought that,
I thought that you were someone else

I saw you naked,
I saw you naked,
I saw you naked,
Naked under our clothes
We're all naked under our clothes
