[Muir, Pleasants]

I don't know what it is
But I'm acting like I know
I don't like what I see
But I never let it show
You can not understand
What you were not meant to find
So I lock it in a vault
Halfway up my mind
Halfway up my head

Halfway up head
Halfway up my head - that's where it got stuck
If you're trying to change me - well you're just out of luck
I know what I am and how I must be
Halfway up my head

[Chorus:]
Halfway up my head
It got stuck
Halfway up my head

Halfway up my head in a back of a file
I put up a front with a wink and a smile
All of the things that you've done and you've said
Halfway up my head Halfway up my head

[Chorus]

When I don't know what to think
Then I don't know what to say
When I don't know what to do
I still do it anyway

So if I sound confused
You're listening all wrong
I take it piece by piece
And I cut what gets to long
Halfway up my head

Halfway up my head
That's where it got lost
Don't like what you said so the message got tossed
You can not lock up what was meant to run free
The spirit in me, the spirit in me
I don't ask for no help and I won't
