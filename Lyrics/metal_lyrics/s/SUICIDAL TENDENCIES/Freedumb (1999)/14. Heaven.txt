[Muir, Clark]

I'm so excited today I'm gonna die
But I'm going to heaven so there's no reason to cry
God says he loves me and I love him too
Yes I have struggled, but but now suffering's through

I don't want you to cry
I just wanna say
I'm so excited today I'm gonna die
But I'll live forever so it's not really goodbye
God has a plan for me and a plan for you

So there's no reason to cry
There's no reason to cry
Cause I'm going to heaven
I'm going to heaven
Yes I'm going to heaven
I'm going to heaven

Over head such a shinning light
As playful angels hover in flight
In the blindingly brilliant pure white
A sensation so peacefully
My soul rises separates from my body
The pearly gates I can now clearly see
I've gone to heaven
Hallelujah
I'm so excited again I'll never die
I'm up heaven so there's no reason to cry
