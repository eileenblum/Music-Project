Original from the westside, S.M. and Venice
Now we're grown to be a worlwide menace
Say what we want cause I know how to back it up
A cyco like me just straight don't give a fuck

and in case you might not know
I'm insane suicidal
Rolling hard with notarious family
We're as bad we want to be

Cause in my life there's only one guarentee
That suicidal I always be
And further more you don't want to forget
We don't take no shit !

We are family
Everyone that's a down sui
We like it hard and loud
And we are always down and proud
