[Muir]

You've heard about the war in my head
And I've been known to wake the dead
I'm not evil just possessed to skate
And feeling like shit, just don't feel great

Built to survive,
Built to survive,
Built to survive,
I'm built, I'm built, I'm built to survive

So much time spent alone
And I'm still searching for my home

Built to survive,
Built to survive,
Built to survive,
I'm built, I'm built, I'm built to survive

Had my scrapes with the law
Is that your mommy that I saw ?
They tried to ban us from L.A.
But every dog has his day

Built to survive,
Built to survive,
Built to survive,
I'm built, I'm built, I'm built to survive
And we're built to survive

It's 1999 and going cyco's all that's on my mind

Controlled by hatred lost again

What I don't need is a friend
I want more you fascist pig
We are family, we live to live

Built to survive,
Built to survive,
Built to survive,
I'm built, I'm built, I'm built to survive
