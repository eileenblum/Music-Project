[Muir, Clark]

Quack quack wop woop

I'm about to get my thrill
And I don't it from no funny ass pill
I'm about to straight break loose
I could fight it but it ain't no use
I'm about it this far away
From going off and making someone pay
I'm about to buy myself

Quack quack wop woop

I'm about to toss and turn
No sleep tonight I got a lesson to learn
I'm about to throw a fit
I can't seem to find the time to quit
I'm about ready to roll
Light on my feet with my gutted soul
I'm about to get my thrill
Anyway I will

I'll buy, I'll buy myself
I ain't got, I got noone else
I'll buy, I'll buy myself
When i go on sale

I'm about 105
Died years ago, but I'm still alive
I'm about 17
It's time to reinvent the punk rock scene
I'm about one inch small
When it seems that's noone cares at all
I'm about to buy myself

Quack quack wop woop
