[Muir, Wackerman]

Teach me and I'll teach you
If you need a hand I'll give you two
Respect me and I'll respect you
Disrespect me and I will destroy you

Gaigan kaera
Gaigan go home

Don't come back
Don't come back

Hope for the best expect the worst
This life it ain't no curse
Respect me and I'll respect you
Challenge me and I will destroy you

Gaigan go home
Don't come back
Don't come back if you ain't suicidal
Gaigan go home

watch what you say watch what you do
Cause I can give it back times ten to you
You challenge me so I will destroy you

Gaigan kaere
Gaigan go home

Gaigan kaera
