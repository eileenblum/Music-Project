[Muit, Pleasants, Clark]

I hurt myself so I can heal myself
I wanna get sick
I hate myself so I can love myself
I wanna get sick

I, I wanna release, I wanna get ill,
I wanna get sick
I, I wanna go off, I wanna get ill
I wanna get sick

I feel my best when I am at worst
I wanna get sick
I fight myself to make peace with myself
I wanna get sick

I, I wanna go off, I wanna get ill
I wanna get sick
Sick sick sick bbb get sick, ya get sick

I confuse myself to understand myself
I wanna get sick
I punish myself to replenish myself
I wanna get sick

I, I wanna release, I wanna get ill,
I wanna get sick
I, I wanna go off, I wanna get ill
I wanna get sick
Get sick get sick get sick
