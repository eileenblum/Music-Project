[Muir]

Too much time on my hands
Too much salt in my wounds
Too much pain in my heart
Too many things to regret
I've been thinking
The cause of my confession
I've been thinking
The cause of my oppression
I've been thinking
What's causing my depression
I've been thinking
Because of my depression
Won't do that change again
Continuous lies never end

I'd hate myself if I thought like you
I'd have to hate myself to do the things you do
Cause I ain't like you
I ain't like you

Too much getting no where
Too much waiting to see
Too many lies have been told
Too many things thought in my head
I've been thinking
The cause of my confession
I've been thinking
The cause of my oppression
I've been thinking
What's causing my depression
I've been thinking
Because of my depression
Stand up small hypocrite
Your full of lies your full of shit

I hate myself sometimes that's true
But I can't hate myself enough to be like you

I ain't like you
I ain't like you
I ain't like you
I ain't like you

Dirty job rearrange
Smoke it up just taken change
I can not hate myself
I can not hate myself enough to be like you
