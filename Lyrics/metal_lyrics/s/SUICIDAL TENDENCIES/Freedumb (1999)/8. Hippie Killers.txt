You're not educated you're just regulated
You're not educated you're just regulated
So if you're tired of getting pissed on
Until you get yourself our system
We don't need your help no way we're OK

Anarchy for me, fascism for you
anarchy for me, means fascism for you
We don't need no rules anarchy
Suicidal punx
We don't need no rules no way
Wedon't need no rule no way, we're OK
We're hippie killers
We're hippie killers
We're hippie killers

No drugs smoke or drink
Hippies suck that's what I think politicians
I don't buy it
Try to contain us, we're gonna riot
The original hippie killers

You're not regulated
You're just not educated
You're not regulated
You're just not educated
So if you're tired of getting pissed on
You better get yourself our system
We don't no rules no way we're OK
We don't need no rules no way
We don't need your rules no way, anarchy
We're the original hippie killers
We're hippie killers
We're hippie killers
We're hippie killers
No pills, trips or hipie weed
Suicidal's all that I need
Truth, respect and lots of pride
in us they live, in you they died
We're hippie killers
We're hippie killers
We're hippie killers, anarchy for me
We're hippie killers, fascism for you
We're hippie killers, anarchy for me
We're hippie killers, fascism for you
We don't need no rules no way !
Anarchy suicidal style
