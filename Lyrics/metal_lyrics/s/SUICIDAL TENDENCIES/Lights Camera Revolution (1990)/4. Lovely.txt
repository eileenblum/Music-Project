Screwed up people everywhere, but I ain't got time to care
I feel lovely, la la la lovely
All kind of souls down to the curb, but me help, don't be
absurd
I feel lovely, la la la lovely
Cause it's a problem of society, if it don't affect me and I
feel lovely
As long as I feel lovely yea
Oh so lovely!
Ans I'm not guilty of your abuse, see it's all self-induced
and I feel lovely
Everything's so lovely
All your kind are like a pollution, look 'em up quick that's
The solution lovely
Wouldn't that be lovely?
So tipper babe don't you remember me?
Now I'm kinder, gentler and so happy
It's lovely!

La la la - as long as I feel lovely, yea
La la la - and I feel lovely, yea
La la la - and everything is la la la la la la la la lovely
La la la
La la la la la la lovely

Everything is so lovely
I think I'll throw a party
Won't you come along darling?
It's a surprise party for me
Simply because I feel lovely!
If everything's so lovely... then why don't I, why don't I,
Why don't I, why don't I feel lovely?
Lovely, la la la lovely, la la la lovely, la la la lovely
