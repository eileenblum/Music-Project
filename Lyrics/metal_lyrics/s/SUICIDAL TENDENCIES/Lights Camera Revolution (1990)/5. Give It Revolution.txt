Throughout all time and history
The world's been mauled tyranny
Now we're refusing to take it
The worst evil the world has saw
Were crimes defended by the "law"
Deny our rights and we'll break it
You got to break the chains that hold you down
Crush the tyrants to the groud
Freedom cannot be legislated
We'll bow down to no other one
The Father and His Son
They can't deny what he's created
Most wars never should have been thought
But this is a war that must be fought
We'll take a wrong and we'll right it
The greatest weapon of the fascist
Is the tolerance of the pacifist
We've got to stand up and fight it
We'll give it

You got to give it revolution, give it revolution
We're gonna give it revolution, give it revolution
You got to give it revolution, give it revolution
We're gonna give it revolution

Well you can put a bullet in my head
But you can't kill a word I've said
You got the disease, I got the solution
No matter how much or more you try,
you can never ever make this martyr die
I give it revolution
Revolution!
You could put a bullet in my head
But you can't kill a word I've said
Give it revolution
No matter how or what you try
You can never ever make a martyr die
Give it revolution
Revolution
