Extra, extra, read all about it!
News flash, read all about it!
Here comes another scam and don't you doubt it
May make you laugh, but it aint funny
I can't believe the things they do for money
Another show that needs to get rated
Just gotta alittle bit more hatred
We interrupt this program to tell you
Disco's out, Murder's in
Kill it!

Goody, goody, another commotion
One more time, in slow motion
The mountain wont come to Mohammad
Let's keep our fingers crossed and maybe we'll bomb it
La da de da da de de da da
All kind of la de fuckin' das
Disco's out, Murder's in

If you wanna go far, we'll make you a star
Not looking for filler, just a serial killer!
It's got to be violent to make it a highlight
If we show it enough
Well, everyone will think it's alright

Disco's out, Murder's in
Kill it!  Kill it!
