I'm tired of always doing as I'm told
Your shit is starting to grow really old
I'm sick of dealing with all your crap
You pushed me too hard now you'll watch me snap

Whack, whack - what's wrong with your head?
I can't believe a fuckin' word you've said
Whack, whack - what are you dead?
Permanently done, gone to bed
Whack, whack - out of your mind
I think you'll like it if you try it some time
Whack, whack - if you look you'll find
I'm whacked, I'm whacked, I'm whacked - get whacked
I'm whacked, you're whacked
Let's go it's whack time

Get whacked - gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme some whack time
Get whacked - all I need, I need, I need, I need is some whack
time
Get whacked - get whacked

Ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do
I'm gonna save my best whack for you
Bbust out hard in a brand new way
Now every second is a psycho day

I'm whacked - and I don't care no more
I'm whacked - right down to the core
I'm whacked - like never before
I'm whacked, I'm whacked, I'm whacked, I'm whacked
Get whacked, won't you follow me
Get whacked, what fun it'll be
Get whacked, and do it naturally
Get whacked, get whacked, get whacked, get whacked
It's whack time!
Whack time - get whacked
Whack time - get whacked, get whacked, get whacked
Whack time
Get whacked, get whacked, get whacked
It's whack time!
Get whacked - I'm whacked, you're whacked, let's go it's whack
time
Get whacked - gimmee, gimmee, gimmee, gimmee, gimmee some
whack time
Get whacked - all I need, I need, I need, I need is some whack
time
Get whacked - get whacked

You don't want none you got that right
When I get whacked it's not a pretty sight
One-quarter scottish, three-quarter insane
Ay, think I've gone a little flat in the brain
Whack, whack - what you got in your head
Another word, another lie that you've said

Whack, whack - your mind is dead
Permanently done, gone to bed
Whack, whack - what do you know?
This ain't no script, this ain't no picture show
Whack, whack - up away and go
Get whacked!
It's whack time - get whacked!

Won't you see me later you'll see me right now
If you think I'm crazy I'll show you just how
I know what's scaring you the most about me
This mo-fo be getting whacked naturally

Get whacked
