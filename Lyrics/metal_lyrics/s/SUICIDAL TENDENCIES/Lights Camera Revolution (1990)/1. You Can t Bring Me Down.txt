What the hell's going on around here?
First off-let's take it from the start
Straight out-can't change what's in my heart
No one-can tear my beliefs apart, you can't bring me
You aint-never seen no one like me
Prevail-regardless what the cost might be
Power-flows inside of me, you can't bring me
Never-fall as long as I try
Refuse-to be part of your lie
Even-if it means I die, you can't bring me

You can't bring me down!
Who the hell you calling crazy?
You wouldn't know what crazy was if Charles Manson
...was eating Fruit Loops on your front porch

Time out-let's get something clear
I speak-more truth than you want to hear
Scapegoat-to cover up your fear, you can't bring me
You aint-never seen so much might
Fight for-what I know is right
What up-you got yourself a fight, you can't bring me
Stand up-we'll all sing along
Together-aint nothin' as strong
Won't quit-we aint in the wrong, you can't bring me

You can't bring me down!

Bring me down - you can't bring me down!
Bring me down - you can't bring me down, no!
Bring me down - you can't bring me down!
Bring me down - you can't bring me down, you can't bring me
down!

Tell them what's up rock!
You can't bring me down!

Bring me down - you can't bring me down!
Bring me down - you can't bring me down, no!
Bring me down - you can't bring me down!
Bring me down - you can't bring me down, you can't bring me
down!

So why you trying to bring me
So why you trying to bring
Well you can't bring me down

Just cause you don't understand what's going on
...don't mean it don't make no sense
And just cause you don't like it,...don't mean it aint no good

And let me tell you something

Before you go taking a walk in my world,
...you better take a look at the real world
Cause this aint no Mr. Rogers Neighborhood
Can you say "feel like shit?"
Yea maybe sometimes I do feel like shit
I aint happy about it, but I'd rather feel like shit
...than be full of shit!
And if I offended you, Oh I'm sorry
But, maybe you needed to be offended
But here's my apology and one more thing...Fuck you!
Cause you can't bring me down

Bring me down - you can't bring me down!
Bring me down - you can't bring me down, no!
Bring me down - you can't bring me down!
Bring me down - you can't bring me down, you can't bring me
down!

You can't bring me down!

Suicidal!!!
