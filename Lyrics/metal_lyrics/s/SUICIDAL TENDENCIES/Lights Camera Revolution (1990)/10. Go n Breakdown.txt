Quieres chigaso, conmigo, tu lo tienes
Por vida y por muerte holmes!
Breakdown a motherfuckin' breakdown
Breakdown ain't that a bitch!
If you like magic, here's a trick
Snap my finger, now I'm a lunatic
Ain't no threat straight out fact go head up you'll get jac-
ked!
Went to school at u. of hell, favorite course was kill and
tell
Gratuated head of class, majored in kickin' ass
Did hard time to get my master, wrote the book on personal
disaster
I don't need to phd to be a doctor of fuckin' misery
Psycho's insane, they say I lost my brain, but I gave it away
If my mind's gone bad don't go off feeling sad cause I chose
it that way
Cause it's a breakdown, I'm go'n breakdown, I'm gonna break
Ain't no you can do
Cause it's a breakdown, a motherfuckin' breakdown, gonna
Break you in fuckin' two
What you got, come and show me
Think I won't, you don't know me
Live or die, it's all the same, life or death, it's just a
game
Make you an offer you can't refuse, pull out the gat, sorry
you lose
Put a disclaimer on the crypt, sorry holmes, finger slipped
I broke a main now it's headed for my brain and my mind goes
Thumpty thump thump
Pinned shot eyes, don't come as no surprise it ain't no dance
The bump and the dump
Cause it's a breakdown, I'm go'n breakdown, I'm gonna break
Ain't no you can do
Cause it's a breakdown, a motherfuckin' breakdown, who said
that
Nightmares don't come true?
Breakdown, breakdown, breakdown
Stick out your head I'll stick out my finger
Kick you in the balls now you're a soprano singer
Rush to my head, whacked and hyper
Now it's time to pay the piper, time to pay the piper
Thought you were smart, now you're lying in a cart, you ain't
Resting six feet below
Your reservation ain't got no hesitations you don't need to
Pack no bag where you go
Breakdown, I'm gonna breakdown, I'm gonna break ain't no you
can do
Cause it's a breakdown, a motherfuckin' breakdown, I'm gonna
Break you in fuckin' two
Cruise the streets on a hustle, show 'em what's up, flex the
muscle
Whacked-out mind on a roll, leaving behind a violent toll
Don't take no chemist to understand the equation ak47, a litt-
le persuasion
Your fear is like a compliment, now you're the production of
my environment
Don't flap no lip, don't shoot that crap
Timebomb for brain don't know when I snap
Breakdown
My strategy I do a psycho attack, you know my set I'm a maniac
Breakdown
Do as they say when in rome, blast the sucka then get home
Breakdown
Concussion to the skull, jugular severed chalk it up another
187
Breakdown
Breakdown, breakdown, breakdown, breakdown
Jack be nimble, jack be quick
Fuck you jack, I be a lunatic
