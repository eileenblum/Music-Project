Lost it! I'm caught in a rage
Like an animal locked in a cage
Now I look into the barrel of a gauge - doom!
Made me into a fool
Experimented on me like an animal
Turned me into a common criminal - criminal!
I lost it, but I gotta get with it
Motherfucker, now you're gonna get it
I ain't one that'll sit and forget it

I got into a war I can never win
Where the nightmare never ends
And I don't know what I'm saying
Got into a war with reality
That motherfucker it was waiting for me
And I lost again!
I lost again!

Took my dreams, ya left them there shattered
Took my hopes, ya dug in them and they splattered
Took my mind like it didn't even matter
Entered a world that I didn't belong
Thought I could take it but I stayed too long
Thought I could handle it, boy was I wrong!

Fighting a war I can never win
Where the nightmare never ends
And I'm not into playing
Got into a war with reality
That motherfucker it was waiting for me
And I lost again!

Lost it! Lost again!
Lost it! Lost again!
Lost it! Lost again!
I lost it!

I went to war with reality
That motherfucker he was waiting for me
I never thought that this could happen to me - damn!
Down so low that I can't no higher
When I was burning you put wood on the fire
You ain't nothing but a goddamn liar - liar!
Took all my strength now I tremble and drop
You got to be down to go over the top
Oh, god can't you make the laughter stop?

Died in a war I could never win
Where the nightmare never ever ends
And I lost again
Got into a war with reality
That motherfucker it was waiting for me
And I lost again!

Liar, killer! Lost again!
I lost!
Murder, killer! Hell I lost again!
No! No!
Cleanse me from your evil
You broke your promises!
What did I do to deserve this?

No one to save me from it!
Oh, lord plese have mercy
And now I've come to see it
Something's gone wrong with me
I guess I got lost in reality
Hell I lost again!
Sure ain't easy, hell I lost again!
