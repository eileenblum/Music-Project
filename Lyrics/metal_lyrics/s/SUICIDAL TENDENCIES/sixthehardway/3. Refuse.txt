Refuse, refuse
Refuse to bow to any man
Refuse to deny my rights
Refuse to self-destruct
Refuse, refuse
Refuse to condemn my soul
Refuse to sell myself out
Refuse to destroy myself
Refuse, refuse
Hold your head high stand up tall
Watch how quickly that'll make the cowards fall
Refuse, I refuse
Respect your body and challenge your mind
You'll come out a winner every single time
Refuse, I refuse
I refuse
Refuse to destroy my mind
Refuse to live your lie
Refuse to appease the enemy
Refuse, refuse
Man made titles shouldn't impress
Terminate them like a pest
Refuse, I refuse
Play this game just like a toy
Celebrate what you destroy
Refuse, I refuse

Reject, renounce, refuse, destroy
Reject, renounce, refuse, destroy
Reject, renounce, refuse, destroy

You never reach a point as low
As when you want to reap more than you sow
Look in the mirror and you will see
Your potential worst enemy

Refuse to conform my thoughts
Refuse to control my pain
Refuse to be a guinea pig
Refuse
Reject, renounce, refuse, destroy!
