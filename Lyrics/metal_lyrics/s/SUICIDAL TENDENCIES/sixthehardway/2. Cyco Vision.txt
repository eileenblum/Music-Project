You tell me what I wanna hear
I hear it all with my ears
But that won't do me any use
So I use my eyes to see the truth

I've got cyco vision
I use cyco vision
I said cyco vision
I see with cyco vision

It doesn't matter what you say ... bullshit
It only matters what you do ... no shit
You cannot take the easy way out with me
'cause I got cyco vision

You put a smile on your face
To try and hide behind your lies
But it just magnifies the pain in your soul that I see with my cyco vision

When you think with all your might
You change right to wrong and wrong to right
But it stays the same to me
'cause I got cyco vision
