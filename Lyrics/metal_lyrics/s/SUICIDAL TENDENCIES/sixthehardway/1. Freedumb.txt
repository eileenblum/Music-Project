Peace through politics - is a fallacy that does not exist
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom
Where's your freedom? We got your freedumb
Get your freedom, I got your freedom
Truth is hard sell but I know what goes over well
Lies and cheap and free so the profit margin works
exceptionally

Where's your freedumb I got your freedom
Get your freedumb we got your freedom
