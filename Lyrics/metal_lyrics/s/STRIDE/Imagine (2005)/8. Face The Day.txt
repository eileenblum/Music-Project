Anxiety weighs on my mind,
I'm living life on borrowed time
Never one to walk away,
Taking time to face the day
And as the hours pass,
A feeling's drifting over me
If dreams die it's such a travesty

When it all seems so far away,
Then my mind tells me to turn
And face the day
Then comes tomorrow---
What will I say? What will I do?

When I get the chance,
To make my dreams come true
I'll have no regrets, no remorse
When the time is right,
That's just what I'll do
Cause all I have is a dream...

Another day sets by the sun,
And now my dream is left undone
One more sleepless night's begun,
I see the shadows mocking me
And as the hours pass,
A feeling's drifting over me
I reach out and try to hold on...

Another night has come and gone,
This feeling's held me for so long
It's getting hard for me to say,
I need some help to find my way
And as the hours pass,
Morning comes to comfort me
I reach out and try to hold on!
