Untie.. Untie the wires that bind you
Push away.. Push away when the walls come closing in
Transcend.. Rise above each moment
Ignite.. Fire your jets and ride upon the wind

Now there's no greater feeling
When it's all in your heart and soul

Imagine a cherished moment,
Let your mind be free
Just close your eyes, and breathe in deep
Imagine a simple notion,
To set your mind at ease
Now open your eyes, Begin to believe

Untie.. Untie your heart, your mind
Look away.. look away and you'll see the truth
Re-design.. Re-design your frame of mind
Ignite.. Fire your jets and ride upon the wind
