Animate the lives within your circle
Elevate the lives in your scene
Replicate the times when your needed
Separate and you'll hide your dreams

Everything you do affects us all the same
And if you fail to try it answers with pain

Now it's time to fly, so free your heart
And those who follow
Know their lives will turn to gold
Cause everything you do affects us
All the same
And if you fail to try it answers with pain

Ahh, situate your life and feel the freedom
Decorate your mind with a show
Re-create and you'll find the hidden secret
Celebrate, and just let yourself go
