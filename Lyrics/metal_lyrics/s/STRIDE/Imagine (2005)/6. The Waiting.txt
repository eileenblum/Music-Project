See me, upon the clouds as they roll by
Feel me, you need to know that I'm inside
Dream of me when you're tired
Close your eyes
Free me, it's OK to live your life

Now I hear you're calling out to me
For yesterday
You know that I will bear the wait
But now I fear you've fallen so far
And you've lost your way-Someday

So believe me, I'm always with you
By your side
Speak to me, I need to know
That you're alive
Your need for me
Makes you want to run and hide
Free me, let me go into the light

Now I hear you're callin' out to me
For yesterday
You know that I will bear the wait
But now I fear you've fallen so far
And you've lost your way-Someday

Now I hear you callin' out to me
About the wait
You know that I will bear the pain
But now the fear is gone and
Together we'll go on
