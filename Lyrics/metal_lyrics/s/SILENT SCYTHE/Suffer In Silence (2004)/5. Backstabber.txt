The tears that I have tasted
The trials you put me through
Our paths will never cross again
You'll submerge, I'll descend
The years that I have wasted
The blood I spilled for you
Broken trust will never mend
The loss of yet another friend

The lies that you have spoken
No feelings left to spare
Father, look me in the eye
And tell me yet another lie
The promises all broken
Your cross I have to bare
My mother lost by suicide
A broken family can't survive

You stabbed your knife
Between the shoulders
That used to carry you
But now we are through

Eye for an eye
Eye for an I

The wounds that you had opened
The scars you left behind
Haunt me to this day and still
I have a drop of blood to spill
It's me against the world
There's anger still unheard
Emotions left to rot and die
It's time to claim another eye

You stabbed your knife
Between the shoulders
That used to carry you
You stabbed your knife
Between the shoulders
That used to carry you
But now we are through
I wash my hands of you.
