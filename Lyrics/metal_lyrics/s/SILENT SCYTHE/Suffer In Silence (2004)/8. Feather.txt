To never mention the past
To never speak her name
You point your finger
But was she to blame
Did she bring shame upon you?
Was she such a disgrace
Never mentioned in your prayers
Denied a resting place

In this perfect world of yours
You discriminate
The ones who ended their own lives are
Victims of your hate

Heaven locked the door
And threw away the key
Since all of god's children
Are guilty as sin
With no cross to bear
And no god to believe
My burden is light as a
Feather from an angel's wing

I never feared the dark
I never dreaded the light
Just another failed father
Who neglected his child
If there were angels
Surley we'd need preachers then
Do I have to end this life
To see my mother again

In this perfect world of yours
You discriminate
The ones who ended their own lives are
Victims of your hate

Heaven locked the door
And threw away the key
Since all of god's children
Are guilty as sin
With no cross to bear
And no god to believe
My burden is light as a
Feather from an angel's wing.
