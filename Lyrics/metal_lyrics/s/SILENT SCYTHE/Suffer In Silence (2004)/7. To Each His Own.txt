Battered - Torn
Apathetic scorn
Tattered - Worn
Wishing I was stillborn

Broken nails scratch the face
Until it bleeds the pain
Breathing fear into the lungs
Until I need the strain

Confiscating, generating
All the things you're forsaking
Escalating, Elevating
All the things I'm hating

No redemption
Hatered has grown
I seek no pardon
From this day: No mercy shown
In the end: To each his own

Ruptured - Crossed
Emotion's holocaust
Future - Lost
No matter the cost

Nervous hands touch the skin
Refraining from the cold
Left without, dead within
Detain a broken soul

Confiscating, generating
All the things you're forsaking
Escalating, Elevating
All the things I'm hating

No redemption
Hatered has grown
I seek no pardon
From this day: No mercy shown
In the end: To each his own

You... cannot kill what's already dead

When judgement comes: To each his own

No redemption
Hatered has grown
I seek no pardon
From this day: No mercy shown
In the end: To each his own

"In birth souls have no equal
Inside good versus evil
In life they're deceitful
Lost amongst the people
In death there is no sequal
In death we're all equal".
