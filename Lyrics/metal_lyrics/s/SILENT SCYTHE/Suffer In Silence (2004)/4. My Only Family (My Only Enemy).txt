My longing for sorrow
Will never cease the pain
Longing for tomorrow
Will never ease the strain
These are the tears I wept
Troughout the years
Unleashing all I kept
Returning all my darkest fears

When night falls and darkness calls
Open the closet revealing a monster

My only family: My only enemy

Am I the Noble Savage
The beast in my reflection
A demon forced to scavenge
Amongst human affections
My spirit's fading fast
Will I live another day
Haunted by a broken past
Leave when you've kissed the pain away

When night falls and darkness calls
Open the closet revealing a monster

My only family: My only enemy

My only family: My only enemy.
