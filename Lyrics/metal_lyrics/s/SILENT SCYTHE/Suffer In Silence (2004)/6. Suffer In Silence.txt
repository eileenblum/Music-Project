Life is slipping through these fingers
None of your concern
The whisper of a dead soul lingers
Never to return
A pain that hurts but never shows
Still remains unheard
Just a silent whisper echoes
Without a single word

Father, your neglected one
Has no place to roam
Father, your defective son
Is coming home

Suffer in silence
Screaming in the dark
Hiding the violence
Extinguishing the spark

Watch these eyes as they flicker
Stay away from me
Losing myself so much quicker
Red is all I see
Turning sicker by the minute
Nothing left to kill
This life, I refuse to live it
Against my own will

Father, your blistered one
Has no place to roam
Father, your twisted son
Is coming home

Suffer in silence
Screaming in the dark
Hiding the violence
Extinguishing the spark

You broke the trust of your own child
Lying through your teeth
Poor excuses stack in piles
A life of conceit
In the twilight of your mother
Acting shameful
Let me be, don't even bother
The truth is painful

Father, the conceitful one
You're on your own
Father, the deceitful son
Just like me you shall remain alone

Suffer in silence
Screaming in the dark
Hiding the violence
Extinguishing the spark

Father, your neglected one
Has no place to roam
Father, your defective son
Is coming home
Father, your blistered one
Has no place to roam
Father, your twisted son
Is coming home
Father, the conceitful one
You're on your own
Father, the deceitful son
Just like me you shall remain alone.
