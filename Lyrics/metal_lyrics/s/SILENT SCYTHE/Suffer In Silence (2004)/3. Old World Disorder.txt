Old world disorder:
Divinity laid down to rest
This is the closure
Reality ripping through the flesh
With no place to hide
I'm stripped from all beliefs
It's time to turn the tide
On gods and deceit

The air in my lungs felt suffocating
Reality almost lost
Every breath I took was so frustrating
No patience to exhaust
Never to fear retaliation
Be that as it may
The fall of your gods' creation:
Old world disorder ends today

Home of disorder
My family torn to bits and shreds
I've seen too many seasons
Of way too many deaths
Free from a family
Dysfuctional from greed
Thriving on lost beliefs
On love through deceit

The air in my lungs feels suffocating
Reality almost lost
Every breath I take is so frustrating
No patience to exhaust
Never to fear annihilation
Be that as it may
The fall of your loves' creation:
Old world disorder ends today

Tasting my own blood
For the first time
Tasting my own blood
For the last time

The air in my lungs felt suffocating
Reality almost lost
Every breath I took was so frustrating
No patience to exhaust
Never to fear retaliation
Be that as it may
The fall of your gods' creation:
Old world disorder ends today.
