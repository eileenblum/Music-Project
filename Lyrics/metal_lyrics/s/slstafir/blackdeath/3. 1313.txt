13:13
Woke up on a winter day.
Feeling fucking mean,
decided to stay.

13:24
Feeling sick and tired,
canÂ´t take this any more.
Presence no longer desired.

13:43
The thought keeps hunting me,
burning desire to break free,
to get away, to escape, to flee.

13:51
I see it so clear
By now all hope is gone,
thereÂ´s only fear.

14:02
CanÂ´t delay this much longer
It is clear what I have to do.
The feelingÂ´s getting stronger.

14:12
Got out of bed, still no sun.
Decided to kill myself.
Picked up a gun.

14:28
Felt a sudden urge to live on
but it was too fucking late.
Half the headÂ´s fucking gone!
