Forever forgotten, despised, unknown
With stories to tell of legends unborn
Sickening silence becomes your grave
But will you surrender to those not so brave

Sun will burn these forests
Of your childhood
Snow will cover the traces
Of the city that once here stood

Remeber the stories
Written by the old
For sharing the wisdom
Is what you have been told
Once you are there
At the silvery gate
Begin with your quest
And follow your fate

Kings will come and kings will go
Rulers of the land you call home
Could you believe their mouths filled with lies
Betrayed you'll be in times ahead
