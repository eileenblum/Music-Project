I entrust my fate into your hands
Colliding my thoughts and your flesh, again
You'll be the one to cause my pain
Without you I'd be a king in my own land

Look for the knowledge
Search for the truth
Words are your knife

Mind and soul, are those just words
known from before
In stone you'll sleep
Forever, in your eternity
Love and hate are united in your own fate
In time you'll live
Forever, in this eternity

You speak to me in an unknown tongue
Hoping that I will give up my dreams
Once you are done with telling lies
Distrustfull I'll move away from my own fears
