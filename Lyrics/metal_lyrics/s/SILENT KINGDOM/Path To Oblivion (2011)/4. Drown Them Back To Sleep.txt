You never look back
To see what you've done
Your mind is so black
You cannot hide
The ones you have left
Mean nothing to you
But now is the time
To repent or to die

The promise you shall keep
Drown them back to sleep
Into the lake so deep
Drown them back to sleep
Where light can't be seen
Drown them back to sleep
That promise you shall keep

Your sould will be drowned
Into the lake of sin
You'll never be found
You'll never be seen
The fire shall burn
Your flesh and your bones
You'll never return
From under the stones
