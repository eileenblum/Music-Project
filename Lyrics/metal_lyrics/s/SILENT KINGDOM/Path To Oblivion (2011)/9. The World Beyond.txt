Within this shadow
I can see you're hiding
With your mind so hollow
I can see you're denying

What once was truth
Now is a lie
What once was a virtue
Now will die

Now I can see
What causes your fear
Fear of unknown
The world beyond
Now I can feel
What you can not feel
Fear of unknown
The world beyond

As nights pass by
I can see yo're running
The more I try
The more you're denying
