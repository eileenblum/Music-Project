Out from the night
They are running away
To search for the silence
To search for the land
Ages are gone
They'll never return
Illusions are here
Forever to burn

Forgiveness do you expect
In nothingness you shall dwell
With fear of tomorrow's day
Fulfilled with emptiness and pain

Will you walk my path
Without love full of hate
Will you be the one
To live in my own fate

Straight into the sun
They escaped this time
Nothing has left?
To look behind
Hearts are shattered
Turned into stones
Forgive and forget
Will happen no more
