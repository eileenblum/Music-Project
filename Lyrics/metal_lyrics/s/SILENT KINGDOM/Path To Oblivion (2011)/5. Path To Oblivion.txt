So you try to preach your truth
Yet your words mean nothing to me
Do you really think I am hurt
And that my wounds will never heal
I shall follow the path
Nothing you say can come between
This road leads to light
With eyes it can't be seen

Silence will fill your heart
Right at the very end
You have been told

Path that leads to the oblivion
Will heal or hearts forevermore
Path that leads straight into your soul
See the light and let yourself go

At the end of your life
Will you surender or will you fight
Never deny the force you felt
So deep inside, before you left
