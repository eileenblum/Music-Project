Once there was a time
When sun would speak to us
When nights were cold and dark
We would travel for days and months
Just to get to the holy soil
That would take us far and beyond

Stones would speak to us
About towers of gold
About people who tried
And the ones who will fall

Come and see what lies below
Words mean nothing
When everything's told
Come and take this truth
Carve it into your heart
This life of yours
Will be your own fight

Now we know the world is lost
But our hope lives inside
For the day will certainly come
We shall keep the flame of truth
Burning high above your lies
Enlightening ignorant ones
