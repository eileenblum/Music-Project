Above the snow cold winds will blow
Inside these woods red hearts will glow
Can you hear my son, can you hear te laughter in the night

Ruins of the world now standing before me
Shadows are tall, trying to deny my being
Visions are born from dirt and ice blue sky
From nothing he came with wings larger than world

From dust we'll be born again
With nothing but our own deeds
Can you be the sun of our days
Can you be our light of always

Now time has come to move away
From mouths that have nothing to say
Leaving behind your empty words
There's nothing here in this world of ghosts
