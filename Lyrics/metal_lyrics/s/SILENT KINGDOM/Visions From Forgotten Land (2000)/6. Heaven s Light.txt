Fly into the sky knowing that time has come
To reach the heaven's light
Pain will never be the same
Love is here to stay below this veil of hate
Lies will die inside our eyes
But hate will live inside our minds

As I'm looking throug the windows of light
I though I may never see
But again those dreams had crossed my mind
And I felt that time is near

Holly world you will see
Light will die but not in me
Summoning these words I speak
Heavenly I will feel

Look and see this light will be
Our saviour in greed

Hear this voice that speaks from deep inside of you
Evil lurks behind these words and will take you right to the dust
