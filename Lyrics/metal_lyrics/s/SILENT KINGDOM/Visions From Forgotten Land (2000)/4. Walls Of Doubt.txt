Locked inside the silent world
Beyond the sounds to hear no word
Seeing things to them unknown
Through the life with dreams destroyed

There is nothing inside that should be fulfilled

Are they clowns for us to see
They are wictims of our philosophy

Walls of doubt, silence and fear
Subscounciousness thoughts they will never hear
Inside these lies there will never be
Tolerance our justice will beat

No one outside will care for them
To laugh or cry that choice is left
Happyness they can not reach
False truth they must preach
