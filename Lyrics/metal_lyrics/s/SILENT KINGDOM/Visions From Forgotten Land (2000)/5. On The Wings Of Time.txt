Stars are shining bright
On this winter night
Through the wind I see
That distant light

Trees are showing me the way
Mountains covered with snow
Like lost and never found
Doors from the other side

Centuries that are left behind
Am I here just to remind
Ghosts of these forgotten halles
Like shadows they will fall

There is no clock to show me the time
Lights are fading away together with my life
Through this dark haze I can't see nothing
I must go back to hide my rage

Stars are dying now on this cloudless sky
On my path I will be lost in time
