Nature has awoke from its sleep
As I'm standing like witness no sand can I see
But it grows in me
Like serpent of yours I will be
Mountains in wasteland I'll reach
They remind on dunes I once saw
Silence I am following now
In eternal forests I'm king

In wasteland forests hear his cry
Bellow his garden he sleeps and dreams
Songs of ocean wakes him up
And with a new day old search beginns

Help me to find my way
Take me out of here
Somewhere where I can see
Visions of life I seek

Let the stars be your guide
And let the wind be your friend
With ancient wisdom of time
Your search will find the end
