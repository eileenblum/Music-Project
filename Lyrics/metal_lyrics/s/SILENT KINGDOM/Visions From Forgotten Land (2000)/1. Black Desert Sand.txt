Motherland you will see
In this place I shall naver be
But it seems to me that colours
Ain't the same they used to be
Silence that I hear in this kingdom of sand I'll live
But desert is a place made just for you and me

As the daylight fades away
It seems that light just wants to stay
But wounded sun needs its rest
Bellow the darkness to find its nest
As the wind whispers me the secrets
And makes its figures in the sand
I'm standing here watching this beauty
Made from the black desert sand
