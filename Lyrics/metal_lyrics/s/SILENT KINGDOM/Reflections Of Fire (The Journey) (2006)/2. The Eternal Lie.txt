I dok dana nestaje
Kraj izvora zastade
Da se vode napije
Zedan dalje ne moze

Vladar tada ustade
Gleda, oci ne vide
Zar da slijep ostane
Od izvorske vode te

You told me once that life
Isn't worth of living
So what other truth, except for lies,
Do I have?

Remember now, this life will pass
So look beyond
Something is there, unknown to man
So seek and find

And this night I will watch for the stars
Silence and desert will hear my cries
Lost do I feel within this ocean so deep
Follow me there where darkness is your
Only friend

Voices of night are calling me to you
My flesh is taken, my tongue is ripped

Why do I need your diabolical thoughts?
Why do I hate your mystical mind?
Where is the end of this terrible nightmare?

And so it ends right here, forever
Or is it my long lost wish
That's gone with you

Remember now, this life will pass
So look beyond
Something is there, unknown to man
So seek and find
