So you shape the truth the way you want
If I could speak your words
Unspoken lies, dead dreams
Swallowed by the art of deception
With blasphemy of those who are denied
And cast out by their own kind
Within our broken bones they will put
Their inverted truth to bleed
For we do not believe

Throw my rotten heart
Lock my mind away
Shut my eyes
And rip my tongue out
Still eternity has no mercy
Neither does your gods

Lost, our perception is wrong
Lost with those who feed on despair

Without excuse and with deception almighty
Our eyes will be burned
And flash eaten away

Greed is stronger than faith
Faith is weaker than mind
But hunger feeds on fractured bones of truth

Summoning eyes are calling the emptiness
No one can hear the cries of slaughtered ones

Behind the glass hidden are those
Creators of hypocrisy, masters of betrayal
Eaters of souls
Nothing but lies can persist here
Voices of innocent, wretched and doomed
Are shuttered by the stone cold walls

I saw them hide away from my eyes
I hate them yet I love them
For they are me

There will be no turning back
For this journey has just begun
Of lies made are we, or lies are made by us
We shall return to nothing, to earth,
To ashes, to dust
We are hostages of our own destruction
So seek salvation in greed

Look through the eyes of a blind
And see what he sees
Same as the moon, he rises to die,
We will travel this life

Lost, our perception is wrong
Lost with those who feed on despair

Throw my rotten heart
Lock my mind away
Shut my eyes
And rip my tongue out
Still eternity has no mercy
Neither your gods

Summoning eyes are calling the emptiness
No one can hear the cries of slaughtered ones
