There was a time when I was blind
To see the truth,standing before my eyes

"Through the time I will come to you
Your dreams will all come true
I am the master of night
To give pain that you deserve
I will nevr have mercy for you
I'll be your fear and pain"

"Like snake I'm crawling to you
I'll be the lastone to tell you the truth
Lights are out now I want what's mine
Will your pain be enough to hide..."

"Tonight-final revenge will completly be mine
Beyond unknown borders I will cross
To reach the place where I will find my peace"

You took away from me my life and dignity
And now I'm lost in deepest darknes where my eyes can't see
