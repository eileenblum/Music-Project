Stars are shining bright
On this winter night 
Through the wind i see
That distant lights 

Trees are showing me the way
Mountains coverd with snow
Like lost and never found
Doors from the other side 

Centuries that are left behind
Am i here just to remind
Ghousts of these forgotten halles
Like shadows they will fall 

There is no clock to show me the time
Lights are fading away together with my life 

Through this dark haze i can't see nothing
I must go back to hide my rage 

Stars are dying now on this cloudless sky
On my path i will be lost in time
