And I didn't know that stories
Were told long ago, and this desert
That I'm dreaming of is so silent
With their screams above
Laughing, unknowing that
Pain is to cry
Weeping in sorrow, hate and distrust
Yes he is the one, the dreamer
The one that will come
Cold heart has he, the false one
The one that will rise
Seek night my son
For I shall teach the truth
Sear no flesh nor blood
Be their dark desires
Look the sun is about to meet
His silent shadow which he could
Never see
What does this means
Asked ones with sinfull knowlege
Of lies weaved
From the east storm is coming
No it isn't, they lie, they can not see
West is a beast
The false, the one you should fear
