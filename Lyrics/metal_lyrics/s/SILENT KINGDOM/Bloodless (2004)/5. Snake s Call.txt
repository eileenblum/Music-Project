Even if I give my life
Would that mean dying?
Should I seek forgiveness of His
Yes I paid my lies to darkness
And all that I can do now
Is to assure you that
Centuries will turn into one
So you can see
What he had done to the world
Hear me-be deaf to my calls
Call me-say nothing at all
Reach me in dreams
Of the wretched souls
Yet they call my son to be a liar
Blind was I or is it not
Was this illusion that I have witnessed
Or was it a snake's call
That brought him back to life
