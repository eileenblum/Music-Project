And so it beginns
With darkness in his eyes
Day turns to night only when
She sings her silent song
Standing and waiting
For the end to beginns
She has no questions
He has no fear
With beast aproaching
With sun frozen in its glow
Should they seek for a shelter
To save them from this
Gathered storm
To search for a shelter
When words
Are spoken to treasure
Rest of them believed
In the false, the lord
