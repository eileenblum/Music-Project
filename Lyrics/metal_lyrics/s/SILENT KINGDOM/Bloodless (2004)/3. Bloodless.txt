And I've dreamed about
Kingdom of death, about the place
Called suffering
And while he's spreading
His wings of agony
Blue as a sky and black as life itself
It carries me there where I'll dream
About place called suffering
I look now into the river
Bloody with leafs
They fell onto her and us
It looked like styx, that river,
But than I saw the truth
While the wings of fantasy
Are closing upon me
I know that it is not a styx
Neither it is...
Bloody she were
Bloddless they are
Cause they choosed that way
And damned are ones
Made of fire
