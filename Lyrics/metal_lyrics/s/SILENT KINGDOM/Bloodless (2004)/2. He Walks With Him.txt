Tell me now my poisoned angel
Who's life are you going to live now
Which sun will you choose
To warm you when winter arriwes
Will you summon them
With words weaved of gold
Or will you claim
Faith of your own
Am I not thy beloved son
Are you not their father,
Their dark in agony
Abandoned in a world
Of someone else's illusion
