And so now I'm going again
For a second time
Your lies will crush our
Already broken hearts
When beauty disappears
Nothing will live no more
And we will find ourselves
Lost
Condemned to hate
And eternal lies
Despised in damnation
Where insanity hides
What ever we do
Their voices speak truth
But there is nothing inside
To tell us what's right
Lost, when will I be able to feel
Despised, humiliation will be
Our savior in greed
Look, see what is real
Deep down inside
Witness you are to
Their miracle of lies
