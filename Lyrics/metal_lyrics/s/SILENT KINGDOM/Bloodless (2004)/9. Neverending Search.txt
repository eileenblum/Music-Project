As they reached the sign
No, voice from darkness said
No man can be inside of me
Their eyes gone blind
They couldn't believe
But horror inside will
Never leave them alive
And there in the mist
Of the ancient walley
He stood and spoke
With ancient thongue he spoke
Your kind shall
Be destroyed by night
And I will feast upon remains of
Your miserable souls
I will be the light
That you seek in the night
And I will live
As long as you want me to live
