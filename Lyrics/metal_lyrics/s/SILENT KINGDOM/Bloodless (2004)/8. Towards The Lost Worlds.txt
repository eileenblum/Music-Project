My journey has begun
Towards the lost worlds
My mind is unleashed by those
Who trapped me once
Your eyes are blind
Your ears are sealed
Towards your dead end
I will not go
I see your lust for blood
You feel my claws on your heart
Yes I shall feed upon your fear
And rip your mind apart
Lies... I heard your voice
Lies... are all that is left
We live in a world
Surrounded by walls
Of ignorance, destruction
And lies
Why... I can not speak
Why... I do not know
