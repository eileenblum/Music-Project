the fire that leaves no scars sears my flesh
it fills me with fear and wonder

an heir to the secret power
an heir to the flame
I am adept in the ancient
well versed in the arcane

the blood of the chosen flows within me
it fills me with strength and passion

as fire, through my veins
the knowledge I've acquired
it burns and consumes me
and reveals what eyes can't see

as a furnace fueled with flame
the power that I've acquired
it permeates and animates me
and raises me to transcendency
