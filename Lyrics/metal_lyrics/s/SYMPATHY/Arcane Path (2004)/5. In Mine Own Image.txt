with anthropomorphic certainty
I enthrone my deity
inevitable reality
raised within mine own mind
in the resemblance of me
god is my will's extrusion
it is I who has created him
and my will shall be done
should I not worship him
and so honor myself

and when I bow
I praise the one
to whom I give
life

the pleasure that I feel in worship is my own
the prayers of my heart are offered to myself
how could I not
create myself as god
the substance of my faith is grounded in desire
the essence of my faith is the form of myself
how can I escape
this emotive state

I adorned myself with jewels
with gold and finery
clothe myself in purple
I raise myself an altar
petition my desires
there is no god unless I am he
