shrouded in obscurity, forces of divinity
burning light and majesty
beyond apprehension, empirical cognition
servants of the immortal throne
ever acting for the will of enthroned deity
never ceasing, never tiring
endless execution of their obscure rites
before the altar of the ancient one

as the shining ones to thee pay their homage
I shall bend my knee in fervent worship
I will take the oath that there shall be no other
and with this flesh, may your will be done

their visages are as the burning light of purity
terror and fear beyond compare
the beating of their wings is the roaring of the ocean
their ardor belongs to the lord of sabaoth
songs never cease to ring throughout the temple
as the smoke from the altar fills the air
their voices sound like the crushing weight of thunder
as their hordes sing praise to the ancient one

hordes, of fiery creatures, of ancient beings, that eyes can't see
droves, of mighty warriors, almighty's agents, defend the chosen
hosts, of divine legions, the dread armies, serve my master
swarms, surrounding me, upholding me, protecting me

As the shining ones to thee pay their homage
I shall bend my knee in fervent worship
I shall take the coal unto me that is offered
and with its fire shall this flesh be cleansed
