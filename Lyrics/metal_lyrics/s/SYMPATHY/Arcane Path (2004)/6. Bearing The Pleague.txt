my flesh bears the plague
unleashed by man
corruption prevails
consume this body with decay
its tendrils are lithe
piercing within
to the spectral heart of man
my mind burns with fire
unbound in my soul
corruption prevails
to fill my heart with hate
is it disease
or is it become
inseparable from me?

enslaved to the passion
ignited within
tasting the power
of this depravity

Am I
Am I the master
of my own
destiny
Am I
Am I the pawn
of this plague that I bear
have I
have I be born
as the
as the scion
of hate
of my hate
and this infirmity

my flesh writhes with disease
my mind rots with dementia
my will embraces desolation
the love of decay consumes me
