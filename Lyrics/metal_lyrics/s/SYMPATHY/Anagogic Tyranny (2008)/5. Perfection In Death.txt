[Music: Derek From, Lyrics: Derek From]

Serene ecstasy
The most beautiful is most terrible
Euphoric reverie
Isomorphic with brutality enraptured in horror
Grasped by the profound
Death cult
Where beauty is terror and terror is sublime

Each nail a blissful stupor
Each thorn the deepest delight

Each wound bleeds of pleasure
Each insult evokes ecstasy

An inversion of values
The most treasured, the most revered
Becomes the archetype of beauty
And all others pale by compare
The moribund tempts with sweet elixir
And death becomes both pleasure and pain
I am enraptured in gory allure
I am become a lover of pain

Oh let me taste again of the flesh of God
Oh let me run my hands along crimson scars
Oh let me see again the thorns buried deep
Oh let me hear again the gasping shallow breath
Come and taste flesh from the dying God
Come and feel the flowing crimson scars
Come and see the embedded thorny crown
Come and listen to breath that whispers sweet

Serene ecstasy
The most beautiful is most terrible
Euphoric reverie
Isomorphic with brutality enraptured in horror
Grasped by the profound
Death cult
Where beauty is terror and terror is sublime

An inversion of values
The most treasured, the most revered
Becomes the archetype of beauty
And all others pale by compare
I am enraptured in gory allure
I am enthralled with the disfigured
I am become a lover of pain
Perfect beauty the death of God
