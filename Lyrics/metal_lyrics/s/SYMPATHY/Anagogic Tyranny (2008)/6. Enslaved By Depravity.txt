[Music: Jeff Lewis, Lyrics: Derek From]

This shard of glass reflects only poorly
The terror that I have become
Its razor edge elicits longing
Beckons of release from pain

The memories are a plague to me
My regret destroys respite
Ghostly figures accuse me of my sin
And no release can there be

Offering confidence
Offering certainty
Offering complete total sleep

No choice remains
Driven unto murder
Consumed with a burning rage
That makes me stronger
It gives me purpose
A captive bound to serve and die

I am the beast that does its bidding
I am the monster I abhor
I sanctioned death. Yet I'm the instrument
Fulfilling the will of others

Offering confidence
Offering certainty
Offering complete total sleep

Now in my cell I pray for death
Now that my mind is awake
Now in my pain a deep remorse
For what I've done

Bathe now my wounds my love
Rest my head on your hate
I taste your blood on your lips
The crimson of my regret

Now in my cell I pray for death
Now that my mind is awake
Now in my pain a deep remorse
This shard of glass finds my flesh

No more confidence
No more certainty
Only exhilarating freedom
