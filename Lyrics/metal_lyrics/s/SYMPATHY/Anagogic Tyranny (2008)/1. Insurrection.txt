[Music: Jeff Lewis, Lyrics: Derek From]

Too long I have cowered
I have become a slave
To my own thoughts
I must conquer myself

I am the hand of plague
I am the anger poured out
I am the scion of resolve
The insurrection
I am the birth of violence
I am the hungry gaze
I am the soul's unrest
I am my destruction

Beaten down in fury
Taken what was once mine
I am consumed and spent
I have been subdued
Plagued always with doubts
Bruised and broken by chains
Freedom's taste forgotten
I am a prisoner

I am the hand of plague
I am the anger poured out
I am the scion of resolve
The insurrection
I am the birth of violence
I am the hungry gaze
I am the soul's unrest
I am my destruction

Begging now before me
Captors that once I feared
Now their teeth are broken
Their cruelties repaid
Breaking out of confinement
Bursting out of this tomb
Desolate my jailers
Now I arise to kill again

I'm the insurrection
I'm the insurrection

These chains no longer bind
As shadows they melt away
These walls that withheld the truth
Shall fall into decay

Silenced no more I must speak
Condemn those that earn death
I have pledged to destroy the dross
Shake off the controlling grasp of all tyrants

Too long I have cowered
I have become a slave
To my own thoughts
Set free from control
Trackless and unburdened
Now I conquer myself
