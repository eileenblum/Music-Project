[Music: Derek From, Lyrics: Derek From]

I am not conditioned. I still feel pain
Of a thousand knives in my flesh
Hanging from the meat covered walls
Skin stretched tight caught in hooks

Freezing beneath northern skies
Burning at the touch of flame
Tasting fetid sickening smoke
Hear the beast that calls my name

Prisoner and captive of a failing war
I am condemned to die
There's no escape from this scene of my demise
Here nailed upon these walls

Freezing beneath northern skies
Hear the beast that calls my name

The cold embrace of decaying hands
Grasp my body once again
Putrid breath from cadaverous mouth
Bathe my wounds in its filth

Stripped of my footings
The foundation of my soul is upended

Deluded by pain and
By the concept of mankind's demise
I draw forth the beast
That resides deep within my heart
I unleash the soulless haunted scathing
Fury from within me

Freezing beneath northern skies
Burning at the touch of flame
Tasting fetid sweet the scent of death
Hanging caught by hooks in my flesh
Smell the rotting odor of war
Hear the beast that calls my name
