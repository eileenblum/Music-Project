[Music: Derek From, Lyrics: Derek From]

Treacherous villain condemned to die alone
Hangs caught between the earth and sky
Blazing hatred deep within his breast
Spewing venom
Yet the beast who must attend his death
Rails not against the driven spikes
The cost of life is that one must die
Sacrifice

Drive steel through my hands
Force it through my feet
Cut me deep with knife edge
The pain is my balm

Taunt me make me stronger
Mock me set my resolve
Kill me slow with torment
The pain is my balm

Take not away this grief
It enshrines resolve
Withhold not your abuse
It brings fortitude
Cease not the endless mocking
For I draw from it strength
To draw forth the beast within
To set free the beast within

A mind torn in two
Half shrinks and balks
The other stands in spite
Firm against injustice
Only through this death
Can freedom truly reign
And set this prisoner free
To taste once again the blood of my enemies

The beast that bears my name
Comforts me in death
Knowing it will rise
To take control and
Reanimate the soul
Reenergize the man
Renew all of him
Become one with me and become all of me

As I await the end
This scene is emblazoned
Upon my dying mind
Imprinted upon the soul that will become the beast
