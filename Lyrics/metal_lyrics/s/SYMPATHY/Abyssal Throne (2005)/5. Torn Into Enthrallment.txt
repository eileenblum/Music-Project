Brain patterns alterd since birth
To serve the higher cause
Pawns of twisted vision
Manipulate to do thy bidding

It is easy for them
To control us this way
To think is obsolete
Therefore no way to question their rule

A mindless, lifeless zombie
To walk the rest of it's days
There's only one law to serve them
All else results in termination
Breeding is done by means of test tubes

It seems strange to me to end up this way
Torn from my state of being
Stripped of all my worth

I can no longer feel
What is now being done to me

I have awakened
Yet cannot move
Paralysis has stricken me

I pray for death
Yet cannot speak
Enslavement now possesses me

Bleed, bleed
You scream at me
Draining
Worthless is my soul you say
You feed the lie
To collapse my will
Feed, feed
On what's left of me
Eating away the life I once lived

You left me in your wake
Or so you think
Vigilant in your plans to deny
You will not overtake
To win the stakes
I will not cower to your lies
Your foolish greedy mind
Is filled with selfish pride
It will bring you to your knees
Flailing in the cess
This convoluted mess
The origin of your disease
