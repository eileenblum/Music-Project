Cast to the earth, the sages have told
The great deceiver the serpent fo old
Is bound to the earth to wander its planes
Inflicting his darkness, increasing his throne
Deepest regions infected below
Performing their rites in abyssal realms
Hiding themselves from the all seeing eye

Now is the hour of reckoning
Now shall the powers be unsurped
Now the axe stands readied to fall

Scourge of the ages
Rendered now insipid
Deposed and feeble traitor
Reign forever impotent

Your kingdom stands in turmoil
Your Rebellion is undone

All that remains is now cursed
Harbinger of the impending warth
Reflected upon the anguished skies
Unveiled within the barren soils
Upon these earthly planes
No baleful scion can stand

The kingdom of this world
Had become the kingdom of our God

Scourge of the ages
Rendered now insipid
Deposed feeble traitor
Reign forever impotent
