You await your final hour
With fear you loathe the end of days
Each moment you're closer to your grave
Infected spirit, filled with angst and dread
Accusing demon, your end draws high

Unbound restless
Serpent of hate
Consume the lifeless
While the furnace you await
Venomous viper
You'll live eternal death
In Hell's fiery pit

The Bride will rejoice
When she sees your fate
Cast to outer darkness
Your torment won't abate
For the Lamb has defeated you
As he hung dead
And the Lion will destroy you
And will do as he has said
