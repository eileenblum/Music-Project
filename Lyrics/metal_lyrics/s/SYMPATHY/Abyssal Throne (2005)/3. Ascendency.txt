I am given power
I am given strength
Ancient forces dwell in me
I have drank of knowledge
I have embraced wisdom
Deep secrets upon aeons

With strang ecstasy
I embrace the hope
Of a certain rebirth
To awake with the fathers of old

That wich once was hidden
Now seems clear to me
I am reborn

Take me down to the ancient graves
Of those who passed this ember
That has burned into me as a fire
I will shroud their tombs whit honor
I will name them among the blessed
For their faith has been instilled in me
I have taken all the offered
I am now their incarnation
For thier God has come to dwell with me
I have taken oaths as they did
I am sealed as once they were
I am an ascendent progeny
