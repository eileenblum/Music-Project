Curse my name
Beat my brow
Drive your claws
In my flesh
Cause me dread
Cause me doubt
On my heart

Yet I give no ground
Here I remain
Bear all your torment
Withstand all your pain

Against the gates of Hell I will stand
In my Enemy's land I will occupy
Against dark forces and evil
I will not sway, turn back or bend

Breaking through your lies
Tearing down your strongholds
Casting down your Gods
Beating them to dust

If you slay me
As you did my Master
Then I will rise
Just as He has done
