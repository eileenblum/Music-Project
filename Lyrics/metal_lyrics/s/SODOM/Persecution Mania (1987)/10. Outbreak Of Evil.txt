[Bonus]

It's time to die
Death stands behind the door
Satan sends his warriors
Demons break out of hell

Shrill cries
Angel dies
Shrill cries
Outbreak of Evil

With sword and axes
The fight hard
In the massacre
They feel the hot smart

Shrill cries
Angel dies
Shrill cries
Outbreak of Evil

No one survives
People will destroy
Souls like hell
Where devils make a toy

Shrill cries
Angel dies
Shrill cries
Outbreak of Evil
