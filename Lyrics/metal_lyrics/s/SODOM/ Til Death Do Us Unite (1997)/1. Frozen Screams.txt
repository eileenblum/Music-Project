Sexual urge
Unleashed energy
Repressed for so many years
No more continence
Dreams of smashing
Let ablaze this dark abyss
The fruits of my life
So fully developed
Burned up to a crisp
Hatred turns to apathy
But now the beggar changed into a king

I cannot hear the frozen screams
My mind feels so much flattered
I taste the blood so warm and sweet
A mournful desirous charade

Playing with my sensual toy
I see it down below
My fingers touched the creature's neck
Seduced me to move on
My plans get true without repent
For whom I shed a tear?
You have to pay the righteous price
'til I get jailed again
