Mankind can be bind
But not the words of god
Idioms are free and flourish
Ulmight 'cause sensible

BRANDISH THE SCEPTRE
Mistress of all cults
Cursed is your body
Until all severed end nears

Angels force be immortal
In presence of all the true
Stars grow in lonely nights
When the watcher rise

Intelligence awake to harmony
Barious terrible fears
Borrow symbolic mystery
Spiteful eyes in face of beaty

BRANDISH THE SCEPTRE
Monarchist is orbain
BRANDISH THE SCEPTRE
Prestige get paralyse
