[1) The Announcement]

It was a time when tyrants ruled the Earth
Mankind's malice showed no remorse
His self created empire troubled him highty
All pursuit of honor was so mighty

A father of three sons, called Noah, appeared
Inspired by God and religious
He shall be rescued from all that wanted flesh
Flying with sons, women, and beasts

[2) ...The beginning... (Invasion of the deluge)]

Noah realized all to the protector's command
Alive on the ground
Fourty days and fourty nights
It shall be rain in the land of promise
On the seventh day heaven's gates get open
Waters covered even great mountains
All what a living odem possessed, died
And got exterminate

[3) Well of deep get clog, rain sink away]

The waters decrease
Noah open the windows of his wooden ark
As the ground dry up he leave the dark
With all the living creatures
Increased by Himself, fulfilled the Earth
Fear and terror turn away

[4) God said:]

I will never more, cursed the Earth
For mankind's will
Their thoughts are evil in their youth
All I've done I repent
So long as Earth lived
Shouldn't stop sowing and crop

Frost and Heat
Summer and Winter
Day and Night

Who spilled human blood
That blood gets spilled by human being

...And Noah realized all
To the protector's command
