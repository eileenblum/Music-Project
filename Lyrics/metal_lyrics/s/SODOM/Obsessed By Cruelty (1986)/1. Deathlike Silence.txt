A twilight was in my mind
Fulfilled of suspended bare foreboding
Great erhaulted forms of life
Touched me by my nightmare
Feel the inflamed impression in my soul
Appeared that I get blessed

DEATHLIKE SILENCE
DEATHLIKE SILENCE

Trustful eyes look up to me
Bring they harm in my exsist
Terrible things revelated the curse
A petual attemp to blasphemic cruelty
Revelated me to that what I am
I hear it, feel it the weird...

DEATHLIKE SILENCE
DEATHLIKE SILENCE

Grasp the sneep tamed snake
Drink fertite poison without ingure
Men spotless and pure heart
True secret as grave
Master of earth and all on it

No reason to vespair
Ready to fo though hell
Always known the fate
Morbid addication to pain

Talk to me in a prophetic sound
I am choosen to saw the true
That have rage as no earthly calamity
Looking for the centre of labyrinth
But its known in my unconscious mind
Escape to myself coined of envy

DEATHLIKE SILENCE
DEATHLIKE SILENCE

No reason to bespair
Ready to go through hell
Always know the fate
Morbid addication to pain

DEATHLIKE SILENCE
DEATHLIKE SILENCE

Fortify at a namn abness of deep
Intinite space of human existence
Broken is my lords foul work
Burst rebellious shouts of deads
All accurse by...

DEATHLIKE SILENCE
DEATHLIKE SILENCE
