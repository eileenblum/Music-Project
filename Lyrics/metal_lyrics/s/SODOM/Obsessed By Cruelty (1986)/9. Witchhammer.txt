The gallows are prepared for magic creatures
Hangmans are ready to burst their axes down
They want pull the hammer down to fair wemon

WITCHHAMMER torment bressed ladies
WITCHHAMMER greedy looked eyes
WITCHHAMMER burning souls
WITCHHAMMER malice rice

Lameing qui te in streets of black death
Terrible monsters, nasty gnomes and mean
vampires
The lewness of millions massed
Want pull the hammer down

WITCHHAMMER torment bressed ladies
WITCHHAMMER greedy looked eyes
WITCHHAMMER burning souls
WITCHHAMMER malice rice

Rites without law command by high priests
Execute is the sentence by churchs monarchy
Patriotic society liberate from human rubish

WITCHHAMMER torment bressed ladies
WITCHHAMMER greedy looked eyes
WITCHHAMMER burning souls
WITCHHAMMER malice rice

WITCHHAMMER
