Under the seal of secrecy
Nobody will come to know the truth
Inpore with impeccability
Heinous deeds coming soon

Freaks of nature
Push matters to extreme
Freaks of nature
Resolute to defeat

Shady and envenomed
Feeble human monsters
Born to be exhibits
Deplorable strangeness
Devoted and obedient
For fear of being whipped
In a state of negativity
There is no retreat

Freaks of nature
Push matters to extreme
Freaks of nature
Resolute to defeat

They abuse before their master
The freak show can begin
Their sun is set they have to suffer
Death is deliverance
Thirst for revenge they flock together
With clubs, knives and all their weapons
To fight for rights and dignity
Slave driver is killed the freaks are freed

Freaks of nature
Push matters to extreme
Freaks of nature
Resolute to defeat

Freaks of nature
Push matters to extreme
Freaks of nature
Resolute to defeat
