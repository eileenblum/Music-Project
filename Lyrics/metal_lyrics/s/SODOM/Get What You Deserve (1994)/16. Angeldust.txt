[Cover : Venom]

Living, running
Out on the streets at night
Searching, hoping
For the right connection because I
Need it, want it
You know I've got to have it
Takes me higher
Than anything I know

Angeldust
Need a shot to see me through the day
Angeldust
Want a lot I've got to get away

I live my life
Like there is no tomorrow
Take no chances
I'm drowning
All my sorrows because I
Need it, want it
You know I've got to have
Takes me higher
Than anything I know

Angeldust
Need a shot
To see me through the day
Angeldust
Want a lot I've got to get away
I've got to go

Laughing, crying
Every night and day
I know
You know
That I'm a different man because I
Need it, want it
You know I've got to have
Takes me higher
Than anything I know

Angeldust
Need a shot to see me through the day
Angeldust
Want a lot I've got to get away
