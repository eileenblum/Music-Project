My attitudes
Will leave you paralyzed
Sadistic thoughts
That you will never realize my god
Don't wake me from this dream

Yell of rage
Inordinate
Maliciousness
Insanity

You can't escape
You gonna pay the price

No captures
Caught between the lines
No captures

Nated proud
It's just a fight to cover
All your hopes
Praise me in the name of endless wars
Don't wake me from this dream

Not secure
Around the world
I am the one
Who'll bring you down

I will descent
Until I reach the end

No captures
Caught between the lines
No captures

This is my kiss
Within a bite
Brings darkness to your light
Help me to say the promised word good-bye
Don't wake me from this dream

I despise
You recognize
Close your eyes
The order to die

No captures
No captures

I despise
You recognize
Close your eyes
The order to die
Nothing but
A pack of lies
Nothing but
Deceit

No captures
No captures
No captures
