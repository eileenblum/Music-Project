We've been called to defend our freedom
Our grief has turned to anger
We've seen the decency of loving people
Deliver them from foreign danger

We'll never rest
We're not relent
Until the day you get condemned

Axis of evil
Must be opposed
Axis of evil
Justice will come

Strike'em down for god and liberty
To stand in a mindless world of hate
In the name of all humanity
Before the growing life decays

We will not fail
We will not tire
Rebellion to the godless crime

Must be opposed
Axis of evil
Justice will come

A faithful world behind the war
Nothing remains but endless peace
That's what we'll always fighting for
The bad will fall at least
We should be proud of our glory
Because of our past
The time is right to realize
We'll standing to the last

We've been called to defend our freedom
Our grief has turned to anger
We've seen the decency of loving people
Deliver them from foreign danger

We will not fail
We will not tire
Rebellion to the godless crime

Axis of evil
Must be opposed
Axis of evil
Justice will come

Axis of evil
Axis of evil
Justice will come
