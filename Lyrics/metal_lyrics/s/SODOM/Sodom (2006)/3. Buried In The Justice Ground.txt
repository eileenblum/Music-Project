You can't ignore the warning signs
Strategies of hidden lies
You can't replace the truth by guns
Escape from all the wrath

Corruption
Selection
Murder and ritual washing
Depression
Regression
Triumph of increbulity

This made is forged in sacred tire
Disguised behind the holy war
Platoon leader's battlefield
To bring'em democratic law

Illusions
Confusions
Instinctive superstition
Worshipping
And praying
Revenge could be so sweet

Buried in the justice ground
Buried in the justice ground

You can't ignore the warning signs

Buried in the justice ground
Buried in the justice ground

Still waiting for deliverance
To stop the evil on the march
Insanity within our dreams
It's peach until eternity

Invasion
Of freedom
Extinguished optimism
The anger
The hunger
Morphine to hold the fire

You can't replace the truth of guns

Buried in the justice ground
Buried to stop the evil on the march
Buried in the justice ground
Eternity
