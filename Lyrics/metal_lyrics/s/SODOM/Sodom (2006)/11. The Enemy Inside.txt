Insanity holds me tight
The lowest forms of my life
Fortification and gleam
To start the fire in me

Breaking all the rules
To breed my fear through you
Wrath is all you can see
Murder in the first degree

The enemy inside
I'm gonna lose my mind
The enemy inside
Waiting for the crime

Why have you been so blind
No religion feeds my mind
If blood runs warm and red
I'll leave you when you're dead
All promises I'll break
Every smile is just a fake
You're waiting for my caress
Incubation of your ashes

The enemy inside
I'm gonna lose my mind
The enemy inside
Waiting for the crime

The enemy inside
The enemy inside

Why have you been so blind
No religion feeds my mind
If blood runs warm and red
I'll leave you when you're dead
All promises I'll break
Every smile is just a fake
You're waiting for my caress
Incubation of your ashes

Tell me what you want to be
Your dream is my reality
Messing around with a gun
Can't undo what I've done
Can't undo what I've done

Reaching for the sky
Somebody's help to respite
Uncontrolled satisfaction
Response to your reaction

The enemy inside
I'm gonna lose my mind
The enemy inside
The enemy inside
The enemy inside
The enemy inside
The enemy inside
Waiting for the crime
