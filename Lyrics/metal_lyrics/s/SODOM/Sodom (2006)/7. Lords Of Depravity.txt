Awaking when the sky turns red
Spilling blood upon my face
The evil takes control
I'll follow your advice

Now I'll rape
I'll slash
I'll dominate
I will degrade

The silent calls of solitude
Believe me that I just want you
When I feel you deep inside
Waiting for decline

Now I'll pray
I'll love
I'll disappear
I will demand

You! Outside the truth
Open your veins
Try to seduce
Passion can't wait
Kiss of decay
And you will see
Lords of depravity

Without a doubt a find refuge
Anomaly or is it you
Exploring pleasures of my sin
Your death is all I see

Now I'll hate
I'll die
I will revile
I will reborn

You! Outside the truth
Open your veins
Try to seduce
Passion can't wait
Kiss of decay
And you will see
Lords of depravity
