Blessed to taste a life of sin
My mind in constant pain
The piece that's always left behind
Just a morbid game

Taking your reverse
Open up your eyes
Your intact world will be destroyed
My short breath is by your side

There's nothing I can do
To stop me now

Wanted dead
The final sacrifice
Wanted dead
To preserve my reign

Who will write my story down
My emptiness to fill
The ocean of my hopeless thoughts
My hand for you to feed

Emotions blazed on fire
Segments of my life
The smile that's on my twisted face
Another sign that lies

There's nothing you could do
To stop me now

Wanted dead
The final sacrifice
Wanted dead
To preserve my reign

It's never been too late
Just to ease the pain
Caught between your legs
Suffering the dead
Reign upon your world
I've never sworn the oath
The secrets kept so long
I'll tell you now

Blessed to taste a life of sin
My mind in constant pain
The piece that's always left behind
It's just a morbid game

Taking your reverse
Open up your eyes
Your intact world will be destroyed
My short breath is by your side

There's nothing you can do
To stop me now

Wanted dead
The final sacrifice
Wanted dead
To preserve my reign
Wanted dead
Wanted dead
