They want to see our castles burning
False religions from a wicked spell
Commit crimes in ice cold blood
The tortured souls to dwell

Born dead creatures live again
Paralyzed to kill themselves
Reality that disappears
Forever buried dreams

The hate is spreading far away
Or in the neighbourhood maybe
When even life's collapse begins
Just what we need

Bibles and guns

Seems like monumental struggle
Of good and mighty evil
Everlasting devastation
Until the death redeemed

Born dead creatures live again
Paralyzed to kill themselves
Reality that disappears
Forever buried dreams

The hate is spreading far away
Or in the neighbourhood maybe
When even life's collapse begins
Just what we need

Bibles and guns

The debris covered our hope
To sleep the endless sleep
Peace no longer rest in my brain
My victim just for me

Born dead creatures live again
Paralyzed to kill themselves
Reality that disappears
Forever buried dreams

The hate is spreading far away
Or in the neighbourhood maybe
When even life's collapse begins
Just what we need

The hate is spreading far away
Or in the neighbourhood maybe
When even life's collapse begins
Just what we need

Bibles and guns
Bibles and guns
Bibles and guns
Bibles and guns
