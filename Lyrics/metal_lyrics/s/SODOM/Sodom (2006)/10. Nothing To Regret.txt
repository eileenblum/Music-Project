The smell of death is all around
Cold violence we adore
The daily deeds man for breakfast
Shall life renew these bodies of the truth
Abused visions and shattered dreams
From this pain and misery
Just pray to summon up the dead
Condemned to the capital punishment

You rule the world
You drink their blood
Betray their souls
You think you've

Nothing to regret
Wounds are bleeding flesh
Illusions of freedom
The symbols of your destiny

Prophecies of blasphemies
The reverence that died within
They are creeping upon you
Hatred venom seeping through
You want to be the master's blast
Ain't no promises that will last
Feel increasing mindless pain
To the epicentre of my hate

You rule the world
You drink their blood
Betray their souls
You think you've

Nothing to regret
Wounds are bleeding flesh
Illusions of freedom
The symbols of your destiny

You rule the world
You drink their blood
Betray their souls
You think you've

Nothing to regret
Wounds are bleeding flesh
Illusions of freedom
The symbols of your destiny
