World pacification
The shadows will return
Insidious conflagration
When life begins to burn

Awake that's sleeping deep inside
Slumbering mercenaries
Disclose the mass demise
Forsaken generosities

When daylight disappears into hell
Unholy clouds of death prevail

Sacred warpath
The gods within the guns combined
The book of lies for faithless minds
Sacred warpath
That keeps the emptiness inside
Crusades the dawn of time

Sliding down the drains
Summoning the elder void
Eating up your brains
Dissected umbilical cord

Endless bleeding skies
To overcast the battleground
Blood seeping from my eyes
Death aiming at my heart

When daylight disappears into hell
Unholy clouds of death prevail

Sacred warpath
The gods within the guns combined
The book of lies for faithless minds
Sacred warpath
That keeps the emptiness inside
Crusades the dawn of time

[Solo: Bernemann]

Who is the enemy and friend?
Who looks a lot like me
A fellow man with friendly fire
Who'll be the first at least

Everything that moves at night
Will kiss the bullet's lead
Your blood in different colors
Heralding doom without a pact

Sacred warpath
The gods within the guns combined
The book of lies for faithless minds
Sacred warpath
That keeps the emptiness inside
Crusades the dawn of time
