Lewdness tearing me apart
It demands my blood as sacrifice
Impaled and stained on a spear
While searching for perpetual cure
The darkest coffin be my throne
Searing faith upon my soul

Through countless prophecies I rode
My retreating was resolved
Where is god to reign supreme
Death instead of silken slumber
My life forever be

In belligerence
In belligerence
In belligerence
In belligerence

Thriving on hypocrisy
Trapped in dark divinity
Harassing fire shreds my skin
Predestinated for the sin
Unwillingness has been erased
Just escaped the gates of hate

Through countless prophecies I rode
My retreating was resolved
Where is god to reign supreme
Death instead of silken slumber
My life forever be

In belligerence
In belligerence
In belligerence
In belligerence

In belligerence
In belligerence
In belligerence
In belligerence

I count disembodied extremities
Unwillingness has been erased
Can't hold my breath when blood is shed
Just escaped the gates of hate

Through countless prophecies I rode
My retreating was resolved
Where is god to reign supreme
Death instead of silken slumber
My life forever be

In belligerence
In belligerence
In belligerence
In belligerence

In belligerence
In belligerence
In belligerence
In belligerence
