Getting closer to the gasping prey
To learn the need of private war
Hand in hand with rotting death
Return to god in parts
Without remorse

Damnation on my rusty skin
Curtain fire in my head
Unconsciously killing all the dead
Just fire and forget

Abstracted deep in lust
Just fell in love with guns
Don't wonder
You are a part of rolling thunder

Rolling thunder
Rolling thunder

I struggled with myself
When I looked into those hollow eyes
Upheld that fragile honor
That disappeared into the endlessness of time

You are a part of rolling thunder

Rolling thunder
Rolling thunder

I chose the path of blind dissension
I never woke up when I heard the cries
My everlasting hate to be revealed
As kids were dying by their mother's side

I earned the seed of retaliation
Destroyed the fruits of human race
Desensitized by blood and ichor
Returning home with a bag on my face

Abstracted deep in lust
Just fell in love with guns
Don't wonder
You are a part of rolling thunder

Rolling thunder
Rolling thunder

I struggled with myself
When I looked into those hollow eyes
Upheld that fragile honor
That disappeared into the endlessness of time
