I have faced the war too many times
Just saw an endless void
Evil was delivered by a claw
When I inhaled the mighty ghost
Life and death long written down
Unwilling to copulate
When demons answered to my call
I was conceived by fiendish pain

Here I am
In a shadowland
Here I am
In retribution
Within my world that I despite

My body is taller than my soul
The helping hand is out of reach
Laying visions on the grave
An occult urge to feed
My ragged wounds are rubbed with salt
Agitation behind the eyes of faith
Barbed wire holds me tight
Insanity that keeps me sane

Here I am
In a shadowland
Here I am
In retribution
Within my world that I despite

Upon a stake of fear I rest
Flesh returns to earth
With wide open eyes I raise the dead
Waiting for release

God's commandments disobeyed
Signed with kosher blood
Silence has been broken
The path of hell is what you chose
Don't mutilate my body
Don't shoot me full of holes
Death retakes the storm of life
Impenetrable soul

Here I am
In a shadowland
Here I am
In retribution
Here I am
In a shadowland
Here I am
In retribution
Within my world that I despite
