No mercy
No sympathy for you
Unbounded
My urge is so impure
Ingenious
I will find your trace
Can't stand it
The beauty of your pain

In my world you're left alone
My claws so deep inside your heart
Prey drive and disorder
Coldblooded slaughter

Maltreatment
Your innocence declined
Reflections
That never reached my eyes
No comfort
To mitigate your fear
Confessions
That never touched my eyes

Don't try to run, don't try to hide
My wheezing breath so close behind
Forever caught in my domain
Be sure that you will not escape

I am the alpha leader
Pitiless and greedy
Your death conserves my species
Predatory instinct
Predatory instinct
Predatory instinct
Predatory instinct

Unending
My hunger is my guard
Defaced
My inner peace of mind
Trailing
Rooting out your nest
No one
Will ever find your rest

Under the stimulus of hunger
And no control to terminate
I lose all my inhibitions
I'll leave your shell exsanguinate

I am the alpha leader
Pitiless and greedy
Your death conserves my species
Predatory instinct

I am the alpha leader
Pitiless and greedy
Your death conserves my species
Predatory instinct
Predatory instinct
Predatory instinct
Predatory instinct
