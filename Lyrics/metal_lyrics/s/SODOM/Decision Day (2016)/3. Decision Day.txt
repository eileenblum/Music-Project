My inner conflict
My frantic face
My desperation
Waiting for the final breath
My wrong belief
My fateful deeds
My aweless pride
Hope to reach the other side

I saw my comrades
Yielding up their fate
They passed away
With water for their final grave

Decision day

With doom beyond
The hell invited me
To leave this world
With dreams of liberty

Decision day

Your blind courage
Your iron will
Your senseless orders
War will end in victory
Your machine gun fire
Your ruling liar
Your battle ground
Soaked with blood of honor

I saw my comrades
Yielding up their fate
They passed away
With water for their final grave

Decision day

With doom beyond
The hell invited me
To leave this world
With dreams of liberty

Decision day

Their cold anger
Their despite
Their misanthropy
For men who fought and died
Their megalomania
Their reign of terror
Their armored life
A godless hail of fire

I saw my comrades
Yielding up their fate
They passed away
With water for their final grave

Decision day

With doom beyond
The hell invited me
To leave this world
With dreams of liberty

Decision day

Surrounded by the death
Along the beach
The doomsday just released
So close in front of me

Decision day
Decision day
