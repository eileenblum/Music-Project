Repudiate your frantic face
Can't confess this bluff
My eyes are betraying that what I see
That defiles my blood
Laughter from the holy ground
Conflict within my dreams
The evil shines through the skies
Awakened by hateful screams

Hoping, praying
For those who collapsed
Craving, invoking the peace
Cursing, despising
Sectarian killing
Armageddon is near

My god is not my master
And prayers just to hell the lies
Light disappears in darkness
Into your wooden eyes

Who is god?

The testament divines the fact
My life is gone before I die
A place of insincerity
Where just dead bodies lie
Your hell will be my constant pain
My inner brokenness declines
Be sure that you're the chosen one
That last face you'll see is mine

Hoping, praying
For those who collapsed
Craving, invoking the peace
Cursing, despising
Sectarian killing
Armageddon is near

My god is not my master
And prayers just to hell the lies
Light disappears in darkness
Into your wooden eyes

Who is god?

Lost in the cryptic kingdom
Can;t pass the point of death
Everlasting superstition
Engraved in spineless flesh

Hoping, praying
For those who collapsed
Craving, invoking the peace
Cursing, despising
Sectarian killing
Armageddon is near

My god is not my master
And prayers just to hell the lies
Light disappears in darkness
Into your wooden eyes

Who is god?
