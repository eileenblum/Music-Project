You're crawling like a desert worm
Praying for graciousness
Trapped within my obscure dungeon
Staring through the darkness

Your god is just an apparition
Your misbelief's warning dead
Don't ignore the warning signs
We've got the gold, you've got the lead

Exposed to my arbitrariness
'Cause death means nothing to you
Disconnected from reality
Wherever you will find refuge

Into a strange lost world
Into a strange lost world

Belligerence and conflagration
Hateful echos from the sky
Blind and faithful unto death
Desensitized humanity

Your god is just an apparition
Your misbelief's morally dead
Don't ignore the warning signs
We've got the gold, you've got the lead

Exposed to my arbitrariness
'Cause death means nothing to you
Disconnected from reality
Wherever you will find refuge

Into a strange lost world
Into a strange lost world

The holy hunter becomes prey
His armor is destroyed
Condemned just by a single shot
To tear the war out of your head

Exposed to my arbitrariness
'Cause death means nothing to you
Disconnected from reality
Wherever you will find refuge

Into a strange lost world
Into a strange lost world
Into a strange lost world
Into a strange lost world
