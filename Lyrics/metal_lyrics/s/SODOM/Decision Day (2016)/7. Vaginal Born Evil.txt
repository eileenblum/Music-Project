Shaded reality
Consecrated lunacy
The crown of creation defiled
Abhorrence in their eyes
Oppressed aberration
Disintegration
Doomed to destruction
Helpless subjection

Inseminated with greed
Hostage of terror
Victimized fellow
Marching to break the peace
Legions of agony
Blind insanity

Vaginal born evil
Satanic but divine
Vaginal born evil
Ruthless and blind

Raised up swords
Unleashed force
Ritualized decapitation
Life termination
Hallowed stones
In the hands of gods
To kill by lapidation
Licentious persecution

War spreading through the air
Imprecation
Brutalization
Salvation fall into despair
Violence growing
Through bloodless veins

Vaginal born evil
Satanic but divine
Vaginal born evil
Ruthless and blind

The dead remains alive
Selective terror
Invasive pleasure
The holy world in shattered state
Dehumanized
Buried minds

Vaginal born evil
Satanic but divine
Vaginal born evil
Ruthless and blind

Shot down in a blazed of glory
Suicidal and unholy
But stand the spitting fire serpent
The truth will dominate the end

Vaginal born evil
Satanic but divine
Vaginal born evil
Ruthless and blind
