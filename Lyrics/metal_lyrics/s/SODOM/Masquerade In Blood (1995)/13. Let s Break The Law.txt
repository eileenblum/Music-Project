[The Anti Nowhere League Cover]

I'm goin' out on the streets and I'm feelin' fine
But if you wanna fight me and I don't know why
Yeah I wanna get dirty all covered in mud
But you turn on me all I see is blood

Let's Break the Law here tonight
They wanna lock me up and throw away my key

I'm out with my lads and I'm feelin' mean
Well we ain't that good and we ain't that clean
We don't really care if you're black or white
But we'll do it now until it's light

Let's Break the Law here tonight
They wanna lock me up and throw away my key

Let's break the law tonight
We're givin' the law tonight
We'll settle the score tonight

Let's Break the Law here tonight
They wanna lock me up and throw away my key

I'm goin' out on the streets and I'm feelin' fine
But if you wanna fight me and I don't know why
Yeah I wanna get dirty all covered in mud
But you turn on me all I see is blood

Let's Break the Law here tonight
They wanna lock me up and throw away my key
