War!
Nuclear warheads are ready to fight
Total destruction the only might
We are all suicide, without brain
People are running and dying in pain

Burst command till war!

The overkill is near
Nobody feel the heavy fear
Thousand megatons dynamite
Wait to kill one life

Burst command till war!

We live our life in grieved desire
Our hopeless is getting higher
You cry for freedom, but nobody hear you
The end of the world is true

Burst command till war!

War, war, war

Burst command till war
Burst command till war

War!
