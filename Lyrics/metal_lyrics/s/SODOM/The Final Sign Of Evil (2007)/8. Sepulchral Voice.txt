Dark deathknell call you to the throat of the glowing hell

Lights of exist become extinet and you read the epitaph of your grave

You are the chosen messenger of hell
Come execute your instruction with spell
You got magic power to all
In league with Satan for holy ghosts fall

The sepulchural voice

Love to drink the blood of the slut adore the bestial rite
Eat the virgins heart warm and sweet destroy the unborn holy meat

You are the chosen messenger of hell
Come execute your instruction with spell
You got magic power to all
In league with Satan for holy ghosts fall

The sepulchural voice

Mysterious groans torment your mind
The shadow of evil make you blind
A funeral song out of the burial place
Damned you to hell from the human race

The sepulchural voice

You are the chosen messenger of hell
Come execute your instruction with spell
You got magic power to all
In league with Satan for holy ghosts fall

The sepulchural voice
