Warriors of hate
Ready for the slaughter
Hellish balls of fire
No promise to surrender
Rising from the dead
Possessed by bestial lust
Pain and despair
Around the godless Gods

Sons of hell
The sons of hell
Can't you hear their screams
Sons of hell
The sons of hell
Nightmare to your dreams

Satanic rituals
The sin we gonna pray
Reaper's breath is near
The devil's endless reign
Thousand deads there lie
Murdered by the sword
Demons and their bodies
Delivered by the Gods

Sons of hell
The sons of hell
Can't you hear their screams
Sons of hell
The sons of hell
Nightmare to your dreams

Searching for your haunted soul
Burn them in the silent night
You are the chosen one to die
You are the final sacrifice
There is a world of endless pain
Created by the denials
They will return to hell and back
No more time to pray

Walls of fire
No surrender

Possessed by evil
Lords of Satan

Possessed by evil force
There is no escape
Victims of your sins
Last human race
Candles all around
Within forgotten souls
Claws of Lucifer
Satan's work is done

Sons of hell
The sons of hell
Can't you hear their screams
Sons of hell
The sons of hell
Nightmare to your dreams
