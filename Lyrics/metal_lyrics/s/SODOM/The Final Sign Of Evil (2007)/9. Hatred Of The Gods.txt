The soul that pines for eternity
Coming from the dark
Dweller of the twilight void
Ripping off my heart
When hell is freezing over
Never ending pain
Driven by your violence
The evil in my brain

Hatred of Gods
Hatred of the Gods

Warriors of haunted souls
Desire for the kill
Rituals of flesh and blood
Spreading Satans seed
Lords of hellish terror
Leading me the way
The day of wrath is near
Thousand lives yo break

Hatred of the Gods
Hatred of the Gods
Hatred of the Gods
Hatred of the Gods

Master of the sacrifice
Total Holocaust
Revealed your endless fear
On the altar of the Gods
The silent call of solitude
Now the time stands still
Into abyss of hopeless time
Do whatever you will

Hatred of the Gods
Hatred of the Gods
Hatred of the Gods
Hatred of the Gods
