The sin Of Sodom...

The final sign of...

Desert plains, the human race
Guilty breed, no love, just hate
Mighty lord, holy lot
Abraham, sulfur rain
Sulfur rain

A city on the desert plains
Defied by human race
Immortal life and sacrifice
Bring 'em to their knees
Armageddon's battlefield
Rising up the pentagram
Victims of a wicked world
Satans war machine is done

The sin of Sodom
The curse of God
Revenge for proud disgrace
The sin of Sodom
The curse of God
Destroyed the world in just a day
Destroyed the world in just a day
Destroyed the world in just a day
In just a day

Lord rained down the burning sulfur
Punished to the guilty breed
Separate the human nature
Replace the love into the hate
Walking through eternal fire
Realized that they have to fail
Delivered them from blind desire
Leave the death behind

The sin of Sodom
The curse of God
Revenge for proud disgrace
The sin of Sodom
The curse of God

Destroyed The World In Just A Day
Destroyed The World In Just A Day
Destroyed The World In Just A Day
In Just A Day

The sin of Sodom
The sin of Sodom
The sin of Sodom
The sin of Sodom

Holy men virgins cry
Pregnant by their father's seed
There is no Prayer to survive
Deep inside misdeeds
The sky felt down to cover up
Burning flames that rise will be
Devastation of the Gods
To set the spirit free

The sin of Sodom
The curse of God
Revenge for proud disgrace
The sin of Sodom
The curse of God
Destroyed the world in just a day
Destroyed the world in just a day
Destroyed the world in just a day
In just a day

The sin of Sodom
The sin of Sodom
The sin of Sodom
The sin of Sodom
