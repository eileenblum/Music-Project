The shadows of hell curse your life
And no more time to pray
The reason for your destiny
When mighty Satans claw awaits

Ashes to Ashes
Ashes and Dust to Dust

Glaring eyes are watching you
Destruction is your inner fate
Storming rain from hateful skies
Before the angry sun will rise

Ashes to Ashes
Ashes to Ashes
And Dust to Dust

Your flesh is put on serpent fire
Your soul for them to feed
Awful painful death desire
Blinded by deceit
Prophecy, eternity
Time is running out
Inhuman black reality
Ripping off your heart
Ripping off your heart
Ripping off your heart

Ashes to Ashes
Ashes and Dust to Dust

You'll be gone into the past
Welcome to your end
Hallowed by your sacred name
Possessed by evils depth

Ashes to Ashes
Ashes to Ashes
And Dust to Dust
Ashes to Ashes
Ashes and Dust to Dust

Raised upon the silent grave
For thousand Years to dwell
Revealed the fire from abyss
Across the haunted fields

Ashes to Ashes
Ashes and Dust to Dust
