The sacred princess of the damned
They steal my soul and suffocate
Mighty lords of evil reign
Condemned me to the hellish flame
Feeded by eternal fire
Scorn of God will always rise
Voices from the holy chamber
Keep the fight and no surrender

You will die by the legions hands
Murderer uncontrolled
Among the lords of Satans land
Past away by demons swords
Tortured lives that will remain
Torment souls embrace the skies
Godless souls received the hate
Place where Angels die

Calling hordes of blasphemy
Thousands deads of destiny
Coming from the blackend sun
Awaking in the crimson mud
Revealed the shadows of the doom
Sodom is the fathers son
The leaders of malevolence
Looking forward to the end

You will die by the legions hands
Murderer uncontrolled
Among the lords of Satans land
Past away by demons swords
Tortured lives that will remain
Torment souls embrace the skies
Godless souls received the hate
Place where Angels die

Sodom, Legions, Lord, Hate
Evil, Dead, Holy, Sacred

The sacred princess of the damned
They steal my soul and suffocate
Mighty lords of evil reign
Condemned me to the hellish flame
Feeded by eternal fire
Scorn of God will always rise
Voices from the holy chamber
Keep the fight and no surrender

You will die by the legions hands
Murderer uncontrolled
Among the lords of Satans land
Past away by demons swords
Tortured lives that will remain
Torment souls embrace the skies
Godless souls received the hate
Place where Angels die
