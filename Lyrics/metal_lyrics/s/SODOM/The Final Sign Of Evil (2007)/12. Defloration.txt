Rape, Abuse, Pain, Might

Defloration,penetration
Laughing silence, glowing eyes
Defloration, excruciation
Heartbeats like a distance fight

Fear, Greed, Desire, Lust

Defloration,penetration
Laughing silence, glowing eyes
Defloration, excruciation
Heartbeats like a distance fight

Awaking the beast, ready to kill
Branded nightmare on your skin
Sacrifice, you're number one
Sinners delight, don't try to Run
Seeking the blood, no control
Coming through
Let it flow
Defloration, penetration
Defloration, penetration

Your fate is sealed, around this night
For whom you cry, You pay the price
Just you and me, there is no lord
I'll curse You
To another world
To another World

Flesh, Tears, Smell
Screams, Blood, Dead

Defloration, penetration
Laughing silence, glowing eyes
Defloration, excruciation
Heartbeats like a distance fight

Line-up:
Tom Angelripper - Vocals and Bass
Chris Witchhunter - Drums

This album is what "In The Sign Of Evil" should have been in 1984.
It contains re-recorded songs from the first EP, "In The Sign Of Evil" and seven never-before-heard tracks, all of which were originally written for "In The Sign Of Evil", but were never released because of the label.
