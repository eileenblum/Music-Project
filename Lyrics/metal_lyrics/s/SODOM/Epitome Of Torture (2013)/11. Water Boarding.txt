[Limited Edition / Digipak Bonus Track]WATER BOARDING 
HYDROPHOBIA 
WATER BOARDING 
BREAKING MY RESISTANCE 

PERFIDIOUS HANDS THAT CAPTURED ME 
THANATOPHORIC AND BRUTISH 
CONDUCTED ME TO MY PERDITION 
MY COUNTENANCE TO BANISH 

WHICH HELL WILL BE MY HABITAT? 
ANTICIPATE THE WORST 
FOR WHOM I BATTLED DISBELIEVERS? 
MY PRAYERS PASSED UNHEARD 

CONSTANT DRIPPING AROUND MY FACE 
LIKE A BRACING SUMMER RAIN 
SEDUCED ME WHILE I FELL ASLEEP 
EMBEZZLED ALL THE PAIN 

WATER BOARDING 
HYDROPHOBIA 
WATER BOARDING 
BREAKING MY RESISTANCE 

BECLOUDED EYES THAT SCREAM FOR SIGHT 
SWIRLING LUNGS THAT WHEEZED FOR AIR 
NECROTIC SWALLOWING REFLEX 
CALL ME TO MY VERY END 

I WILL DIE LIKE A DESERT-ROSE 
I`VE STARED THE FACE OF MOON 
THE DEATH IS COUNTING FADED FLOWERS 
DEACTIVATED RULES 

I SAW MY LIFE IN A REFLECTION 
OF THE PRIDEFUL MAN I USED TO BE 
I`M YIELDING TO MY GODLESS FATE 
AND NITROGEN RUNS THROUGH MY VEINS 

WATER BOARDING 
HYDROPHOBIA 
WATER BOARDING 
BREAKING MY RESISTANCE 

LET ME OUT OF HERE... 

WHICH HELL WILL BE MY HABITAT? 
ANTICIPATE THE WORST 
FOR WHOM I BATTLED DISBELIEVERS? 
MY PRAYERS PASSED UNHEARD 

WATER BOARDING 
HYDROPHOBIA 
WATER BOARDING 
BREAKING MY RESISTANCE 

WATER BOARDING 
HYDROPHOBIA 
WATER BOARDING 
BREAKING MY RESISTANCE
