CONVULSIVE HUNGER FEEDING ME 
PANTRIES SEEMS EMPTY WITH BITTER MEAT 
IT`S NOT ONLY GLUTTONY 
WANNA CARRY THOUSAND FELLOWS INSIDE OF ME 
AROUSES ME LECHEROUS, I NEED TO UNFOLD 
SMASHING YOUR BODY AND DEFILE YOUR SOUL 
THE SLIGHTEST CLUE HOW IT MUST FEEL 
TONIGHT I WILL FIND SOMEBODY TO KILL 

MY PALATE IS ANXIOUS FOR THE TASTE OF MY SPECIES 
SEDUCED THE WILLING VICTIM TO TEAR IT TO PIECES 
IT'S PALPABLE NOW AND I MAKE IT COME TRUE 
IT PREVAILS OVER REASON WHAT I'M BOUND TO DO 

SHREDS OF SKIN, A SEA OF PULSING MUD 
ALIVE ANEW BY YOUR RAGING DEATH 
I'M THE GOD OF BLOOD FOR ALL TO SEE 
A CANNIBAL OF LUST - THAT'S ME! 

THIS PALLID FACE WHEN HIS BLOOD OOZED OUT 
DELIGHTFUL PAIN, BUT THERE WAS NO DOUBT 
WE CHOKED HIS PRICK, I WAS DRAWING THE LINE 
NARCOTIC TOXICATION HE WAS GONNA BE MINE 
HOW BLACK THE SAP OF DISEMBOWELS COULD BE 
MY GIZZARD CLENCHED, STARTED GNAWING HIM 
THE GLISTENING GUTS EMBELLISHED THE HOOK 
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW LONG HIS AGONY TOOK 

THE ROASTED GALLBLADDER SMELLED LIKE MAWKISH GREASE 
HIS GORE WAS FETID LIKE A BLOOD DISEASE 
WHERE ONCE WAS A MAN, IS A GNOME LEFT NOW 
I HAVE DONE IT STILL NOT KNOWING HOW 

SHREDS OF SKIN, A SEA OF PULSING MUD 
ALIVE ANEW BY YOUR RAGING DEATH 
I'M THE GOD OF BLOOD FOR ALL TO SEE 
A CANNIBAL OF LUST - THAT'S ME! 

CHOPPING HIS LIMBS MADE ME SICK 
ALL BLOOD AND BONES UPON THE RICK 
RED SECRETION, I SCUFF THROUGH VEINS 
DARK BLACK WATER, PUNGENT PAIN 
GUTS AND ICHOR ALL AROUND 
MY EARS STILL HEAR THE SPLINTERING SOUND 
FIBRES OF NERVES AND SKIN REMAINS 
I WILL RETURN IN CRIMSON RAIN 

NOTHING FOR ME AND FOR YOU TO REGRET 
I REALLY OWN MORE THAN I'VE EVER HAD 
LOOKING BACK IN MY DARK SHRINE AND SEE 
A SPIRITUAL SIN - THAT'S ME! 

SHREDS OF SKIN, A SEA OF PULSING MUD 
ALIVE ANEW BY YOUR RAGING DEATH 
I'M THE GOD OF BLOOD FOR ALL TO SEE 
A CANNIBAL OF LUST - THAT'S ME! 

SHREDS OF SKIN, A SEA OF PULSING MUD 
ALIVE ANEW BY YOUR RAGING DEATH 
I'M THE GOD OF BLOOD FOR ALL TO SEE 
A CANNIBAL OF LUST - THAT'S ME!
