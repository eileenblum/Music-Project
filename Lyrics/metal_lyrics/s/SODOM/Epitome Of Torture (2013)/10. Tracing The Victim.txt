INHERITED FRENZY INSIDE MY HEAD 
I WANNA LIVE ON, BUT I AM CLOSE TO BE DEAD 
A SPOT ON MY SOUL THERE SINCE ANCIENT TIMES 
ALL MY FOREFATHERS WERE PURSUERS OF CRIMES 
TWO SUNKEN BLACK EYES LIKE MOONSHINE 
THEY GLANCE AT YOU AND SEDUCE YOUR MIND 
YOU THINK I'M YOUR BABY BUT I NEVER WILL BE 
INGENIOUS I MOAN: 'YOU MEAN NOTHING TO ME!' 

THERE YOUR SCARF LIES AHEAD 
HOW I WISH YOU WERE DEAD 
WALK WITH ME THROUGH ENDLESS DREAMS 
I NEVER WAKE UP, WHERE I FELL ASLEEP 

THREE STEPS TO THE GATE AND I SMELL YOUR FEAR 
I FOLLOW THE TRACK AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE 
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS, WE BOTH COULD DO 
TRACING THE VICTIM, WHICH IS YOU 

I ONCE FELT AFFECTION AND SLOSHED OF DESIRE 
ONE LOOK AT YOU AND MY SOUL WAS ON FIRE 
I NEGLECTED THE FACT I WAS BORN IN DISGRACE 
THE LAST THING I`LL DO I WILL FOLLOW YOUR TRACE 
SEGREGATED I LIVED IN BLIND DECEPTION 
I SILENTLY SCREAMED WITHOUT GETTING RECEPTION 
NOW YOU WILL SEE WHAT I HAVE BECOME 
SATIATE MY DESIRE, I LEAVE NOTHING UNDONE 

THERE YOUR SCARF LIES AHEAD 
HOW I WISH YOU WERE DEAD 
WALK WITH ME THROUGH ENDLESS DREAMS 
I NEVER WAKE UP, WHERE I FELL ASLEEP 


THE LAST TIME I RAPED YOU, AND HIT AND BETRAYED YOU 
DON'T LEAVE ME, RETRIEVE ME OR I KILL YOU, BELIEVE ME 
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS, WE BOTH COULD DO 
TRACING THE VICTIM, WHICH IS YOU 

CLEARLY I SMELL YOUR CLOYING SWEAT 
IN THE ENCHANTED PARK WE FIRST MET 
BE SURE THAT I`M SELECTED FOR THE KILL 
I'M CLOSE TO YOU INSIDE YOUR SKIN 

THERE YOUR SCARF LIES AHEAD 
HOW I WISH YOU WERE DEAD 
WALK WITH ME THROUGH ENDLESS DREAMS 
I NEVER WAKE UP, WHERE I FELL ASLEEP 

THERE YOUR SCARF LIES AHEAD 
HOW I WISH YOU WERE DEAD 
WALK WITH ME THROUGH ENDLESS DREAMS 
I NEVER WAKE UP, WHERE I FELL ASLEEP 

THREE STEPS TO THE GATE AND I SMELL YOUR FEAR 
I FOLLOW THE TRACK AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE 
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS, WE BOTH COULD DO 
TRACING THE VICTIM, WHICH IS YOU
