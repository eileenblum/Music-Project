AS I START A CHASE 
STALKING IN THE NIGHT 
MY PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED 
CAUGHT IN A DESPERATE PLIGHT 
VOICES OF THE DAMNED 
INFECTIOUS CLOUDS OF DOOM 
SOUGHT TO MAKE MY PATH 
IGNORE THE LIES OF TRUTH 

EPITOME... 
EPITOME OF TORTURE 
MISLEADING... 
MISLEADING MY DESIRE 
EPITOME... 
EPITOME OF TORTURE 
NO CHANCE FOR... 
NO CHANCE FOR YOUR REVIVAL 

NOTHING LEFT INSIDE 
INSANITY RELEASED 
FALLING DOWN WITH HATE 
JUST UNDISCOVERED DREAMS 
STIMULATED SINS 
SERVED WITHIN TEMPTATION 
ERASING YOUR DECEIT 
VIOLATE YOUR DESTITUTION 

EPITOME... 
EPITOME OF TORTURE 
MISLEADING... 
MISLEADING MY DESIRE 
EPITOME... 
EPITOME OF TORTURE 
NO CHANCE FOR... 
NO CHANCE FOR YOUR REVIVAL 

YOU BREAK THE PEACEFUL SILENCE 
PENETRATIVE SCREAMS 
DECIVILIZED MY GRACE 
STIRRING UP MY BLOOD 
...MY BLOOD 
...MY BLOOD 

EPITOME... 
EPITOME OF TORTURE 
MISLEADING... 
MISLEADING MY DESIRE 
EPITOME... 
EPITOME OF TORTURE 
NO CHANCE FOR... 
NO CHANCE FOR YOUR REVIVAL 

NO CHANCE FOR YOUR REVIVAL 
NO CHANCE FOR YOUR REVIVAL 
NO CHANCE FOR YOUR REVIVAL 
NO CHANCE FOR YOUR REVIVAL
