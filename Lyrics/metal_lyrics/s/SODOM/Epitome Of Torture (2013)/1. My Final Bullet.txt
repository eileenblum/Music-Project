CAN`T STAND THE HOPELESSNESS 
CRINGE AT SOUND OF EVERY GUN 
A SINGLE GOD FOR ALL OF US 
THE ONE YOU LOVE IS GONE 
WHAT YOUR DEATH IS ALL ABOUT 
VICIOUS GAMES OF ENDLESS FEAR 
WE CURSED THE BATTLED GROUND 
THE SKIES AND ALL BETWEEN 

SALVATION IN MY PIOUS HAND 
THEY`LL NEVER BREAK MY OBEDIENCE 
IT`S GOOD TO HAVE A FINAL BULLET 
IT`S NOT AS FRANTIC AS IT SEEMS 
THIS LITTLE LEAD TO SET ME FREE 
IT IS MY FINAL BULLET 

MY FINAL BULLET 
MY FINAL BULLET 

A WHISPER COULD NOT LOUDER BE 
THAN A SHOT INTO YOUR DESTINY 
IT WAS THE DAILY CALL TO HELL 
NO PLACE FOR OUR SOULS TO DWELL 
NATIVE BLOOD AND BRAVERY 
EMPOWERED BY THE SOVEREIGN 
FOR THOSE OF US WHO FIGHT THE STORM 
FOR THOSE THE CONFIDENCE IS GONE 

SALVATION IN MY PIOUS HAND 
THEY`LL NEVER BREAK MY OBEDIENCE 
IT`S GOOD TO HAVE A FINAL BULLET 
IT`S NOT AS FRANTIC AS IT SEEMS 
THIS LITTLE LEAD TO SET ME FREE 
IT IS MY FINAL BULLET 

MY FINAL BULLET 
MY FINAL BULLET 

THE HAND THAT LEADS MY COGITATIONS 
THY WILL BE DONE 
FROZEN NECROPHOBIA 
A PREDULE TO THE VERY END 

I REALIZED, I`LL NEVER DIE IN BED 
GOT ANOTHER DOOM INSTEAD 
FOLLOWING THE CURSE OF LIFE 
THE CONFLAGRATION JUST BEHIND 
MY NAME IS CARVED IN A MOURNFUL STONE 
STILL BEFORE MY LIFE IS GONE 
I`LL BE THE LAST UPON THIS GROUND 
THE LAST WHO`LL SPEND THE KILLING ROUND 

SALVATION IN MY PIOUS HAND 
THEY`LL NEVER BREAK MY OBEDIENCE 
IT`S GOOD, TO HAVE A FINAL BULLET 
IT`S NOT SO FRANTIC AS IT SEEMS 
THIS LITTLE LEAD TO SET ME FREE 
IT IS MY FINAL BULLET 

MY FINAL BULLET 
MY FINAL BULLET 

THY WILL BE DONE 
THY WILL BE DONE 
THY WILL BE DONE 
THY WILL BE DONE
