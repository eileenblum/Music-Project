THERE IS NO ACT OF DESPERATION 
INSATIABLE DESIRE FOR THE KILL 
YOU`LL NEVER FIND YOUR ISOLATION 
ERASING YOUR DECEIT 

MINDS COLLAPSED TO SMITHEREENS 
DEAD JUST FOR A WHILE 
DANCING WITH IMMORTAL SOULS 
WHEN VICTIMS PASSING BY 

CAN`T FREEZE THE SMILE ON YOUR FACE 
CARESSED ON SACRED GROUND 
REJECT THIS PEACEFUL PLANET 
IGNITE YOUR SHIELDING SKY 

INVOCATING THE DEMONS 
THE SEED I`VE SOWN TO EARN 
INVOCATING THE DEMONS 
CAN YOU HEAR MY HUNGER ROAR 

DREAMS OF INVENTED FANTASIES 
REALIZED BY BLUNTED FEAR OF GOD 
TO CROSS FORBIDDEN BOUNDARIES 
TO DRINK YOUR SACRED BLOOD 

DESCENDED FROM A LOADED GUN 
A VIOLENTLY REGRESS 
LOST DIGNITY IS DEATHLESS 
GONE WITHOUT A TRACE 

MY SORROW FELT BY THOSE WHO MOURN 
PERISHED BY COMPLACENCY 
BLUDGEONING AT MY INSTIGATION 
JUST WANT YOUR FALSE DOCILITY 

INVOCATING THE DEMONS 
THE SEED I`VE SOWN TO EARN 
INVOCATING THE DEMONS 
CAN YOU HEAR MY HUNGER ROAR 

THERE IS NO ACT OF DESPERATION 
INSATIABLE DESIRE FOR THE KILL 
YOU`LL NEVER FIND YOUR ISOLATION 
ERASING YOUR DECEIT 

MINDS COLLAPSED TO SMITHEREENS 
DEAD JUST FOR A WHILE 
DANCING WITH IMMORTAL SOULS 
WHEN VICTIMS PASSING BY 

CAN`T FREEZE THE SMILE ON YOUR FACE 
CARESSED ON SACRED GROUND 
REJECT THIS PEACEFUL PLANET 
IGNITE YOUR SHIELDING SKY 

INVOCATING THE DEMONS 
THE SEED I`VE SOWN TO EARN 
INVOCATING THE DEMONS 
CAN YOU HEAR MY HUNGER ROAR 
INVOCATING THE DEMONS 
THE SEED I`VE SOWN TO EARN 
INVOCATING THE DEMONS 
CAN YOU HEAR MY HUNGER ROAR
