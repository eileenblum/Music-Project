WHEN WE CAME AROUND TO GRAB YOUR SOUL 
DEATH INSEMINATED MARTYRDOM 
CREATED LIKE A DREADFUL WARNING SIGN 
A PROMISED LAND TOO TOUGH TO DIE 

SHATTERED DREAMS 
PSYCHOTIC CRIMES 
BITING TRUTH 
CONTEST YOUR FADING ZEST FOR LIFE 
RETAKE YOUR PLACE 
IN GLOWING HELL 
NO SYMPATHY 
THE EVIL AND NO WILL TO BEND 

SELF-DESTRUCTIVE ATTITUDES 
THE PEACEFUL WORLD BORN TO BE REFUSED 
YOU CANNOT HIDE THE FACE OF DEATH 
REALITY THAT SEEMS SO DASHED 

S.O.D.O.M. 
RISING FROM THE DEAD 
S.O.D.O.M. 
RUNNING THROUGH MY VEINS 
S.O.D.O.M. 
WE'LL BLOW THE NIGHT AWAY 
S.O.D.O.M. 
SET THE WORLD ON FIRE 

MISLEADING FAITH ERASING YOUR DECEIT 
TRAPPED WITHIN THE SEED OF SINFUL DREAMS 
PRAISE THE GLORY LORDS OF DEATH`S DESCENT 
DON`T NEED A GRACIOUS GOD WHEN HELL COMMANDS 

PROPHETS OF RAGE 
TREMENDOUS WRATH 
DISMEMBERED SOULS 
DISFIGURED CHUNKS OF MEAT 
BREAK THE CORE 
OF HUNGRY MINDS 
THE RULING LORD 
A FIGHT ON ENDLESS BATTLEFIELDS 

SELF-DESTRUCTIVE ATTITUDES 
THE PEACEFUL WORLD BORN TO BE REFUSED 
YOU CANNOT HIDE THE FACE OF DEATH 
REALITY THAT SEEMS SO DASHED 

S.O.D.O.M. 
RISING FROM THE DEAD 
S.O.D.O.M. 
RUNNING THROUGH MY VEINS 
S.O.D.O.M. 
WE'LL BLOW THE NIGHT AWAY 
S.O.D.O.M. 
SET THE WORLD ON FIRE 

S.O.D.O.M. 
RISING FROM THE DEAD 
S.O.D.O.M. 
RUNNING THROUGH MY VEINS 
S.O.D.O.M. 
WE'LL BLOW THE NIGHT AWAY 
S.O.D.O.M. 
SET THE WORLD ON FIRE 

S.O.D.O.M. 
S.O.D.O.M. 
S.O.D.O.M. 
S.O.D.O.M.
