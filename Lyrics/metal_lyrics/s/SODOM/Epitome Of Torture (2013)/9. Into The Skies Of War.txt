CASTING SHADOWS ON A GREENISH MUD 
I`LL CROSS THE PLAINS OF DAWN 
FOUL STENCH AND OPEN WOUNDS 
A BALEFUL CRUSHING STORM 

ONLY CREEPING DEATH CONTEST 
FOR THOSE WHO NEVER LIVED 
BLOOD CANNOT BEAR REALITY 
HEAVEN IS OUT OF REACH 

INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 

HERETICS SEND TO BANISHMENT 
WHERE THERE IS NO RETURN 
THE TRUTH KEEPS CALLING US TO HELL 
THE AXE CAME BREAKING DOWN 

WHO`VE SEND US ALL THAT MISERY 
THE PROPHETS MESMERIZED 
SHINING BONES INDICATES WHAT HAS BEEN 
HATE PASSING THROUGH THE LINES 

INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 

WE GOT NO CHOICE 
IN A WORLD OF ANARCHY 
TAKING UP THE GUNS 
NO MORE PHILANTHROPHY 

INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 

THE FLAG RAISED ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP 
WE KILLED FOR THOSE WHO COULDN'T KILL 
THE BULLETS FLY WILL NEVER STOP 
WE NEVER SHED A TEAR 

THE SEED OF HATE ACROSS THE LAND 
REMAINS IN FIELDS AND VAULTS 
THE PRICE OF FREEDOM PAID 
IDEOLOGY DEFORMED 

ONLY CREEPING DEATH CONTEST 
FOR THOSE WHO NEVER LIVED 
BLOOD CANNOT BEAR REALITY 
HEAVEN IS OUT OF REACH 

INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR 
INTO THE SKIES OF WAR
