HE PUNCHED THE NAILS INTO MY HANDS 
INFILTRATING ALL THE PAIN 
HIS HOODED EYES ALIGHT 
STARING AT ME THROUGH ENDLESS TIMES 
SLAUGHTERED BY THE HOLY HAND 
FATE IS SEALED AND NO ESCAPE 
LEAVE INHUMAN HELL BEHIND 
BLOOD SPILLS ON HONEST GROUND 

STIGMATIZED 
STIGMATIZED 
STIGMATIZED 
STIGMATIZED 

WHILE YOU PRAY YOUR LIFE TO KEEP 
VINDICATED PROPHECIES 
AWAKING PENITENCE INSIDE 
UNFOLD WHAT PROPAGANDA HIDES 
DECEITFUL DEATHLIKE SILENCE 
BLOOD OF PATRIOTS AND TYRANTS 
ENCHANTED SOULS WILL NEVER REST 
RIOT WITH A HORRIFIC SMELL 

STIGMATIZED 
STIGMATIZED 
STIGMATIZED 
STIGMATIZED 

OBSCENITY 
IMPERFECTION 
ACCENTUATE 
MY DESPERATION 
CRUCIFIED 
ON A VIRTUAL STAKE 
BESTIALIZED 
INCURABLY INFECTED 

STIGMATIZED 
STIGMATIZED 
STIGMATIZED 
STIGMATIZED 

STIGMATIZED 
STIGMATIZED 
STIGMATIZED 
STIGMATIZED
