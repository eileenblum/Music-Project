I HEARD THE BULLET PIERCE HIM THROUGH 
UPON THE ENDLESS WIDE RANGE 
GUN-SMOKE LIKE A WINDING SHEET 
I KNOW THAT HE COULD NOT ESCAPE 

HUNTING DOWN THE SCAMPERED RATS 
AND THROUGH THE SCREAMS SOME HORSEMEN DASHED 
CROSSING DOWN THE HALLOWED FIELDS 
AND FROM THE HEIGHTS THE THUNDER PEALED 
A BLINDING MUZZLE FLASH 
CONFLAGRATION BLAST 

DANCING WITH THE WISE MAN`S DEATH 
SCATTERED BONES AND TATTERED FLESH 
THE RHYTHM OF THE WAR DRUMS HUSHED 
INTO THE ENDLESS DESERT`S TIDE 

A BLINDING MUZZLE FLASH 
CONFLAGRATION BLAST 

SHOOT TODAY 
KILL TOMORROW 
ONE MAN`S GUN 
IS ANOTHER MAN`S SORROW 

SHOOT TODAY 
KILL TOMORROW 
ANGRY SHARPS FROM FAR BEYOND 
NO QUARTER WHEN THE BULLET STARTS 
IN BLINDING FLAME AND STRANGLING SMOKE 
MY EARS ARE STRAINED TO CATCH THE SOUND 
A VOICE THAT RANG FROM A REDSKIN THROAT 

A BLINDING MUZZLE FLASH 
CONFLAGRATION BLAST 
UNVEILED THE GLOOMINESS 
I HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP 

SHOOT TODAY 
KILL TOMORROW 
ONE MAN`S GUN 
IS ANOTHER MAN`S SORROW 

SHOOT TODAY 
KILL TOMORROW 
ANGRY SHARPS FROM FAR BEYOND 
I FORGED THE LAW FOR THOSE WHO DIED 
AMONG THE DESERT FRONTIER LINES 
FADING LIFE LIKE DYING EMBERS 
AND TURN THE ENEMY TO STONE 

KILL... 
SHOOT TODAY...KILL 
KILL TOMORROW...KILL 
SHOOT TODAY...KILL 
KILL TOMORROW 

I HEARD THE BULLET PIERCE HIM THROUGH 
UPON THE ENDLESS WIDE RANGE 
GUN-SMOKE LIKE A WINDING SHEET 
I KNOW THAT HE COULD NOT ESCAPE 

HUNTING DOWN THE SCAMPERED RATS 
AND THROUGH THE SCREAMS SOME HORSEMEN DASHED 
CROSSING DOWN THE HALLOWED FIELDS 
AND FROM THE HEIGHTS THE THUNDER PEALED 
A BLINDING MUZZLE FLASH 
AND IN THE GRAY OF DAWN 
THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT 
45/70 CLEANED IT UP 

SHOOT TODAY 
KILL TOMORROW 
ONE MAN`S GUN 
IS ANOTHER MAN`S SORROW 

SHOOT TODAY 
KILL TOMORROW 
ANGRY SHARPS FROM FAR BEYOND 
SHOOT TODAY 
KILL TOMORROW 
SHOOT TODAY 
KILL TOMORROW
