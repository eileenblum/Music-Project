Feigned death throes
Feigned death throes

Your feigned death throes deceived me
Your false dead eyes released me
Although your blood still flows
It's only feigned death throes

I tear you and you'll like it
I drink you 'til you're weak
Death itself with ugly face
Through pores of bloody skin

Feigned death throes
Feigned death throes

Engrained misanthropy
Sowed the seeds of death
When hatred amplifies your pain
I am the one who pulls the string
There's no way left for you to win
I knew you would not stay

Your feigned death throes deceived me
Your false dead eyes released me
Although your blood still flows
It's only feigned death throes

I tear you and you'll like it
I drink you 'til you're weak
Death itself with ugly face
Through pores of bloody skin

Feigned death throes

With feverish eyes i stare
Through shadows in the moor
You don't know what you'll have to bear
I'm standing there alone
'til someone comes along
A loaded pistol in my hand

Split second in despair
So you planned a fake
While you heard your bones all break
Arise this glory day
I will survive i will defeat
Destroy the man that I've become

Feigned death throes
Feigned death throes
