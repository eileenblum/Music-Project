Distinction of hatred
Finally revealed
The fears that you dread
Shattered are your screams
To this world where i am god
Drowned into the fire
I ll terminate your nest
And reach your demise
Pollutes the ground a rotten red
Hope will be no use

A styptic parasite
Caught to survive
Sovereign from hell
Deadly virus so impure
Styptic parasite
Unseen or in disguise
Thrashed and revealed
Evil spreading out of my soul

Seeking
Killer
Instinct
Result of endless years

Crying of denials
Craving your blood
Stillborn black dreams
See you tremble
When your hidden panic grows
Remain within the circle
Unspoken words of death
Reclaim my broken past

An evil thrives inside my soul
The darkest place i know

Like a styptic parasite
Caught to survive
Sovereign from hell
Deadly virus so impure
Styptic parasite
Unseen or in disguise
Thrashed and revealed
Evil spreading out of my soul

Deadly virus so impure

Seeking
Killer
Instinct
Result of endless years
Deprivation
Resignation
The pain so deep inside
Deprivation
Resignation
The pain so deep inside

Like a styptic parasite
Caught to survive
Sovereign from hell
Deadly virus so impure
Styptic parasite
Unseen or in disguise
Thrashed and revealed
Evil spreading out of my soul

Styptic parasite
