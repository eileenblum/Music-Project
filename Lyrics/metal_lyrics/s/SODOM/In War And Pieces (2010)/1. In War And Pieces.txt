Contempt of sanity
A domination of the beast
The end of you and me
Cruel die the least

Dark is the night for all
Deplorable we try to crawl
Hollow the dead we fear
Nescient why we are here

One man's meat is another man's poison
One's blind street leads another to reason
Dark alleys of the death seamed with corpses
Gore rotten beds of carred skin in tatters

Fractured minds, impure dead visions
Puking downwards with derision
Raping souls of carnivores
Soaking butchered to the core

Rupture the sluice of mental sewage
Don't shed a tear down on bony pewage
Now you know how fetid death breathes
I'm leaving you in war and pieces

In war and pieces
In war and pieces

Dying creatures gonna burst asunder
About maltreated sobbing bodies i wander
Dark heaven lowering above us all
Angel of death, can't you hear my call

Blain on the head of selective retention
Splinters to remove the intolerably tension
The adumbration of mental plague
Broken eyes peer wide awake

Rupture the sluice of mental sewage
Don't shed a tear down on bony pewage
Now you know how fetid death breathes
I'm leaving you in war and pieces

In war and pieces
In war and pieces

Die by my hand in the same dark prison
In your head you will keep the vision
Leave this live with shattered brain
Slightly driving you insane

In war and pieces
In war and pieces
In war and pieces
In war and pieces
