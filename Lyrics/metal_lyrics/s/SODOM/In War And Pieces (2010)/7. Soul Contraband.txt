Release the breeding ground of my hate
The planet shakes from my atomic weight
I am the enemy i want to see you fall
Every move you make is under my control

To all the prayers in this world
My cries will leave this mud unheard

Salvation
Damnation
Born unwanted
Godless
No bless
Fight
Destroy it

Soul contraband
Soul contraband

Life and love is hidden from my eyes
Lost in the paradise of sacrifice
Millions follow and millions lost
Lay down to die without a final sound

Watch a broken nation die
Words of wisdom are denied

Decrepit
Misguided
Presumption of death
Release
A pulse
You ll never understand

Soul contraband
Soul contraband
Soul contraband

I am your destiny
Get up from your knees
Scream for your soul
There is no more hope
Caught in my rage
Terminated
There is a storm
At the horizon

Soul contraband
Soul contraband
