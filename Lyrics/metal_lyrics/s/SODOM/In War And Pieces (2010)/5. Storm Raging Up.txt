With false security life passes through my eyes
Obliterated souls just memories remain
I am the adjuratory dance of the flames
Transforming into the holy shapes

I can't control the rage
Everlasting pain
No distracting foes
I'm gonna be your god

Storm raging up
I'm ready to set this world on fire
Storm raging up
Flaring up my hate
Rise and destroy
Rushing to the flash zone
Bombing of the black stone

Wearing the mask of eternal gloom
A radical conviction confirming to the doom
Cutting the throat of humanity
Replacing the boon by the dark agony

I can't control the rage
Everlasting pain
No distracting foes
I'm gonna be your god

Storm raging up
I'm ready to set this world on fire
Storm raging up
Flaring up my hate
Rise and destroy
Rushing to the flash zone
Bombing of the black stone

My love is buried somewhere underneath
Can't follow the rules of your society
Start the war for a thousand years
Into the glory arms of despiteful death

Removal of the grind
Wake up before you die
Stimulated sins
Absorbing through your skin

Storm raging up
I'm ready to set this world on fire
Storm raging up
Flaring up my hate
Storm raging up
Storm raging up
