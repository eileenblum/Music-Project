Self inflicted inner strain
Copulated with insanity and hate
My hunger got materialized
Underestimated spite

Throats and faces circumvented
Externally altered and disfigured
Trapped within this lurid nightmare
But i want to keep you by my side

Nothing counts more than blood
A pal remains so deathless
Never turn your back to god
Nothing counts more than blood

Fouled up beyond all recognition
Slashed the pain to a higher position
Death will never frighten me
Contradictions seed to kill

Inconsistency with my religion
Can't decide my vic selection
The final captures can't elude
Above destructive attitudes

Attitudes

nothing counts more than blood
A pal remains so deathless
Never turn your back to god
Nothing counts more than blood

Voices from the damned, i want to leave
When dreams begin to cease

Hear the sound of the marching man
At far beyond machine gun rang
You don't know what you're fighting for
The burning world reflects the war

Dead bodies served as rifle rest
And protection when the bullets blast
No retreat from hell's domain
When hunters become prey

Become prey

Nothing counts more than blood
A pal remains so deathless
Never turn your back to god
Nothing counts more than blood
