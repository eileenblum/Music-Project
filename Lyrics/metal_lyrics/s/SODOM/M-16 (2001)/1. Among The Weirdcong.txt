Seems like dead men want to leave their graves
Point to anything they love to hate
Broken skulls reflection all around
Execution, blood beneath the walls

Aggressive jungle war
Breaking through the lines
Slaughter according to your evil rites

Your death will be methodic
Gonna lose my way
Among the weirdcong
Machine gun fire chain reaction
Shredded brains
Among the weirdcong

Antipathy to the gloating face
Dissection til your soul will leave again
Impact shock absorbs my energy
Bullets cutting through the rotten meat

Aggressive jungle war
Breaking through the lines
Slaughter according to your evil rites

Your death will be methodic
Gonna lose my way
Among the weirdcong
Machine gun fire chain reaction
Shredded brains
Among the weirdcong

Your death will be methodic
Gonna lose my way
Among the weirdcong
Machine gun fire chain reaction
Shredded brains
Among the weirdcong

Emotions died, extinguished deep inside
Impurity made blood turns into wine
When I saw my friends impaled to death
Dishonoured and condemned their strength

Aggressive jungle war
Breaking through the lines
Slaughter according to your evil rites

Your death will be methodic
Gonna lose my way
Among the weirdcong
Machine gun fire chain reaction
Shredded brains
Among the weirdcong...
