No emotions to take your life
Confrontation with the dead inside
Wasted thousand centuries
Now fighting for the endless peace

Adrenaline control
Forever fixed my soul
Curse by my side
Judgement in disguise

I am the war
Never disarmed
I am the war
Within my heart
I am the war
Supreme command
I am the war
Living on the edge
I am the war

I smell the rats of mendacity
Napalm for your nudity
I practice what I preach my god
Dehydration of your blood

Adrenaline control
Forever fixed my soul
Curse by my side
Judgement in disguise

I am the war
Never disarmed
I am the war
Within my heart
I am the war
Supreme command
I am the war
Living on the edge

I am the war
I cannot build but I can destroy
Insanity concealed
All the structures have been lost
Totally decease

I am the war
Never disarmed
I am the war
Within my heart
I am the war
Supreme command
I am the war
Living on the edge

Infected by unnatural aggression
Driven by abnormal death selection
No antibodies that fixed my mind
No teardrop dims my savage eyes

Adrenaline control
Forever fixed my soul
Curse by my side
Judgement in disguise

I am the war
Never disarmed
I am the war
Within my heart
I am the war
Supreme command
I am the war
Living on the edge
I am the war

I am the war...
