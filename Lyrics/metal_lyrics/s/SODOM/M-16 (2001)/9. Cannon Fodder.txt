I feel like someone's watching me
Don't know where the enemy is
The night brings bad dreams to my mind
Maybe the girl that's by my side
Potential killers extremely mauled
Machine gun fire all around
Into the eye of a hurricane
The ultimate end

I got no power to survive
Empty thoughts of suicide
Psychotic wounds that never heal
You put the crown of thorns on me
Cowards in the grip of fear

A fox the chicken disappear
Creation of the lifeless rules
No return
All my heroes
Fighting legions
Crucified in flames
Cannon fodder
Rivers of red
Russian roulette
Gambling hypocrites
Cannon fodder

No scream will ever intimidate
Upon the dark side of a man
Walk among the bursting grenades
Ghosts of Vietnam penetrate
Burning towns up over there
Teaching freedom death parade
Snipers pointing accurate
Living on the edge

All my heroes
Fighting legions
Crucified in flames
Cannon fodder
Rivers of red
Russian roulette
Gambling hypocrites
Cannon fodder

I feel like someone's watching me
Don't know where the enemy is
The night brings bad dreams to my mind
Maybe the girl that's by my side
Potential killers extremely mauled
Machine gun fire all around
Into the eye of a hurricane
The ultimate end

All my heroes
Fighting legions
Crucified in flames
Cannon fodder
Rivers of red
Russian roulette
Gambling hypocrites
Cannon fodder

All my heroes
Fighting legions
Crucified in flames
Cannon fodder
Rivers of red
Russian roulette
Gambling hypocrites
Cannon fodder
