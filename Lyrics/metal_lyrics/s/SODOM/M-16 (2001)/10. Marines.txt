Inclination for the rock'n roll war
Under the flag of peace and law
Your native country to set it free
In the air, on land and on the sea

For their honour and their golden crown
Swing the judgements glory hammer down
The patriot within their valiant heart
Keep'em hungry for the liberty love

Hatred just a tool the aggressors to control
Into the jungle's depth, into the desert storm
Caught between legions of hate
Caught beneath malefic eyes of fate

Seems that we are doomed to drown your hopes
Marching to the destiny, no attitudes to lie
Don't want to leave that battlefield without a sign
Engaged to the rifle by my side
Marines
They're fighting for you
Marines
They're dying for you
Marines
Keep your honour clean
Marines

You are the chosen one securing the world
Universal soldier to the bone
And for my brothers you'll get what you deserve
Down the bloody road to war

Marines
They're fighting for you
Marines
They're dying for you
Marines
Keep your honour clean
Marines
Out in the killin'fields
Marines

Marines
They're fighting for you
Marines
They're dying for you
Marines
Keep your honour clean
Marines

You hear the mine clicking under your feet
You know you have to go
You hear the trigger of a foreign gun
To bury all your hope

Ever pave the way for endless peace
Self-sacrificing 'til you have the world to leave
For the common people honest generation
Just you can stop the human disintegration
