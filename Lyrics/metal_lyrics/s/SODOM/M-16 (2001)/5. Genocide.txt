This is the dark side of humanity
To liberate treacherous insanity
You can't ignore the truth behind
That followed us until the end of time
You see the stars when the night is done
You see the death when the life is gone
Confused by the rules who'll take control
There is no god

The sacred halls of truth
That bitterness on youth
I heard the whispered tales
Of glory and of death
Of immortality
Into their destiny
We fight the holy fire
While feeding Satan's flames

Genocide
Elimination
Demented minds
Genocide
Extermination
Tortured lives

Sitting on a time bomb with a primitive design
Wish we got the spirit and the power to survive
The final day is close to us the right to live refused
Who gonna wake'em up to kill the multitude
No revolution set us free to break the line
Answers lost before somebody asking why
Just one bullet left for perpetual sleep
Locked up in a cage kicked away the key

The sacred halls of truth
That bitterness on youth
I heard the whispered tales
Of glory and of death
Of immortality
Into their destiny
We fight the holy fire
While feeding Satan's flames

Genocide
Elimination
Demented minds
Genocide
Extermination
Tortured lives

The sacred halls of truth
That bitterness on youth
I heard the whispered tales
Of glory and of death
Of immortality
Into their destiny
We fight the holy fire
While feeding Satan's flames

Genocide
Elimination
Demented minds
Genocide
Extermination
Tortured lives
