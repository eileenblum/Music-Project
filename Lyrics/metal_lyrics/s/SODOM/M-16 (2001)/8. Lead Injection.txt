Firepower in the hand of a madman
Hell is gonna burn
Crushing 'em down, pounding away
At the point of no return
Painful screams growing near
Metal cutting your breast
Laughing when you lose control
Pollution guarantee

Creeping and crawling why do you cry?
Pathetically prayers by your side
Caught beneath my blood erection
Lead injection

Assault attack, the rifle's blast
You are my soul insane
A product of a brutal world
Killing just a game
Hatred burns with desolation
Pleasure for the blood
This must be the dead man's day
The truth in crimson mud

Creeping and crawling why do you cry?
Pathetically prayers by your side
Caught beneath my blood erection
Lead injection

Creeping and crawling why do you cry?
Pathetically prayers by your side
Caught beneath my blood erection
Lead injection

Swinging the judgement's hammer down
Glory 'til the end
Now you wish you had a god
Now evil in your brain
Bullets left the gun straight ahead
Awaiting your cancerous breath
Will touch you when you're still alive
And left you when you're dead

Creeping and crawling why do you cry?
Pathetically prayers by your side
Caught beneath my blood erection
Lead injection
Creeping and crawling why do you cry?
Pathetically prayers by your side
Caught beneath my blood erection
Lead injection
