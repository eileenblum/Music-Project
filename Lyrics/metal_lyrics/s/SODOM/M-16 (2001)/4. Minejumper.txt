You know there is a reason
Why you never shouldn't trust
As their fury got released
Undertaking blast

Jumping on a mine

Can't find refuge
Your reign can now begin
Ignoring your triumph
Summon up the dead
Tormenting nightmares
Revealed my darkest fear

Dancing with the devil
See the staring eyes of rage
Violence is just a friend
Walking on the right way

Jumping on a mine
Jumping on a mine

Can't find refuge
Your reign can now begin
Ignoring your triumph
Summon up the dead
Tormenting nightmares
Revealed my darkest fear

Shellshock shades of darkness
Valiant demise
I see my rent remains
'cause my celebrations still alive

Jumping on a mine
Jumping on a mine

Can't find refuge
Your reign can now begin
Ignoring your triumph
Summon up the dead
Tormenting nightmares
Revealed my darkest fear
