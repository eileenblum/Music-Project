Forbidden art, journeys beyond by a solitary moon
I fall to the godflesh, how many years here
travelled have I? alone I must seek thou
centre, O BLACK TATTWA souls divide but mine
clutch, clung, I dissect, dissect, dissect, dissect but still
will not let go. Benediction! time agony the mind of the
father calls to thee, conceive how thou pure offering
mind &amp; matter: make them same! PREDICTION! you will not stand
the side of the moon the sperm is rot painted in hues superhal
DEATH &amp; AGONY. watch the vineage acid flows overseas impale the sons
aborted Christ's "A SEAM OF GOLD FOR A CROWN" the light of the world glows within
by balance of DEATH and generation as we dance as we slay close to the
great Prince of AIR! Deny O Maya's veils of sin, come forth as ye may
WHIRLING OF WAR XUL, dominates the vessel where in
vomit, fever &amp; plague, set into the drain the astral body followed by

and multiply as commanded via pentagram reversal tapping into weary &amp; dualistic
fears of the unworthy parasites bleed in hell drinking INCUBUS sudden impalation
dead at birth, blood by swastika no oaths no calls EXTERMINATION vengeful wind
element how long have they been there trapped in my psyche
Atzhiluths are demons every noise a conjuration introduce a catatonic
Kenosis the thirst of the fifth ascend on the FORESIGHT ASMODEUS will dawn
this avernal breathing holy lord of hosts holy crown drowned in
VIRULENT ABOMINATION
SINKING TOOTH
