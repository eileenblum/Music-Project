invoketh beyond necessity
DREAMER our corrupt
and useless hierophant
abhorrent curse over him
destiny we'll bring. MURDER HIM
oh plead YHSHWH, I A o'rep!
9 DROPS OF IMPURE BLOOD
Fall on the crowd of Malkan
thou hast come before
me over lesser
gods abhorr thee
ALL THE TREASURES
OF THE AZURE ARE REVEALED
DESCEND TO Chiva you feel the
Violation you obscene lamb
of god invoking yourself in the
FIRE OF BAAL
Folly's doom is ruin

your image is received in
the eye of the devil
invoke him with the
pure heart to stay within
we pass on from luna to
mercury &amp; mars of the
all-father's shadow you
catch a glimpse

and then from beneath the earth's chasm
the one who holds the balance has now
been set free BEHOLD!!!!!!
fire without smoke burns without
care. rush through everything
WITCH-WATER it flows
in thine cup; ye loose not one drop! the powers
of the wave endowed in thy son and daughter
of mighty ones! return to the seat of power
within NOX burn upon their brows of splendorous serpent
and from heavens echo a pattern the holy
word is scattered set to offer us thee answer
how WHIRLING FORCES!!!!
AROUSE FROM YOUR TOMB
to smite the firmament for the gods
are now blackened with fear &amp; hate in
themselves all-devouring for man has created
gods in thine image
and a black sun shall
rise as we meet within
now thou shalt see that
the gods in the rift is thou
self-made Osiris made perfect
within the PITCH-BLACK FIRE
of SET giving
Libations to the
goddess and
I'm still pleading
for the end

ALL BLOOD IS
POURED UNTO
THEE
