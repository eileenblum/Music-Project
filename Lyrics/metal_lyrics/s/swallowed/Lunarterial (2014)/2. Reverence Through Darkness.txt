As I descend upon your
Throne of DEATH
Let me taint thyself
For your circle is bleeding
WITH YOUR FILTH
O holy duke of hell
sight in the feet
shewn the sigh
of ruby receive its scale
black soul inverse
within the voice of
lightning flash in the tomb of
dark winds are blowing in EDEN
the constraints of the soul are yielding
BATHE IN THE FIRE
shallows of the soul intruding
The colden jaws of DEATH are seething
DOGS OF WAR ROAR
the eye of the darkening
of the severed SON
the sea is the gateway fall into the
ABSU! preforated mess
angelick I resume to skin you
tapping &amp; bleeding pious angel
I REJECT YOU! slaughter of the paroketh life's odour expel
from your mouth
GOAT OF FIRE
bless in furnace 
bless in seizure
drown in sorrows
ORIEN ARITON
PAIMON AMAIMON
and the first true key of alchemy
is the knowledge of EVIL
so come seventh one
arouse from your throne
in EDOM
