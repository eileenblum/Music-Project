Does the mist of doom parasite them
My arteries spray a message; you are them

Pulse gushes out warm blood
Arterial tear fissures the ground

What I taste like is gangrene
Melting silhouette is my true form

I saw it as a vision 
through the other side
Echoing depths I am surrounded by
The dying misted in the blood stream
