Innocent and young thrown to the street
Terrified and lost we bark at the moon
Drunk and stoned we found our way
In the dark, in the dark
Braindead and sick, life in the fumes
We fell to our knees at the tower
Begged for mercy, begging for mercy

Street Child - What have you lost, what have you found
Street Child - Has the weight of time been hard on your shoulder
Street Child - Where have you been, what have you done
Street Child - Just looking for your way back home

Below the lights, below monoliths of modern times we bleed
The blood of generations born free
Wrapped in chains and bound by fate we scream
And it echoes, it echoes

Street Child 
Street Child 
Street Child 
Street Child 

Secrets, were they so hard to tell, so hard to keep from me
You took me down the road of agony
Walking tall our heads were held up high
But we stumbled, we stumbled

And in our dreams we walked on water
We felt the need to believe
But in the desert we were reckless
And the last page of our lives were lost in the heat, 
It crumbled to dust
