Our clerics and healers are murderers and dealers
Sinners disguised as saints and the Christians are counting
Their money is mounting in vaults of dead children and pain

Building a wall each brick we put in place sows the fate of our race
Building a wall we are much too blind to see what is right
Turn our backs shut out the light, on their lives
Building a wall each time we knock it down another king of death is crowned
Building a wall but our ignorance makes that bridge too far
Building a wall they are smothered by it's shadow, left to hung upon the gallows
Building a wall we are just heathens of the street
Sending news of their deceit, to the world!
We are sending to the world for our lives!

And the churches that tempt you with heaven and hell
Just want your cash through the lies that they tell
While the babies are dying their mothers are crying
But pleas for help are smothered by the few

Are you willing to take some of your hope and share it with those who have none?
Cause the dreams that you weave may be your own
And the payment the lives of the meek but the sickness is spreading
From sick evil minds preaching the law of their hell
And the Christians and Muslims are killing their cousins spilling their blood in the sand
