Insanity near erotic insomnia
Over the brink the emptiness feels so cold
Trapped in this hole trapped in eternal pain
Love is the demon caught from behind

Feeling like death drug induced coma
Blind to the world heart of stone
Walls closing in nightmares of you
You pushed it too far I am nobody's' fool

Suicide from love suicide from hate
What did you want me to be?
What did you want me to be?
Lying in trash brain dead from booze
What did you want me to be?
What did you want me to be?
Afraid to let me fly free what did you want me to be?

Training my mind innocence lost
Lunatic time sickness the cost
Bury my love rotting deep inside
I am turning the tides it is your turn to die
