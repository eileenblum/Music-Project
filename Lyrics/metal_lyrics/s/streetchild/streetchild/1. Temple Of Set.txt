The fury of violent destruction
A chorus of voices in pain
Mist-Maze, torture caves of insanity
Anubis holds Osiris' name

You must heed the word
Don't disturb the temple of Set
You've breathed your last breath
Death awaits in the temple of Set
The temple of Set

The temptress, the goddess deceived you
She sucks out the life from your blood
The sacred eye shattered to pieces
You have no hope this far beyond

You must heed the word
Don't disturb the temple of Set
You've breathed your last breath
Death awaits in the temple of Set

An expanse of space lies beyond you
The sea to the home of the dead
Feeding the rivers of sorrow
And the evil men dream in their heads

You must heed the word
Don't disturb the temple of Set
You've breathed your last breath
Death awaits in the temple of Set
The temple of Set
