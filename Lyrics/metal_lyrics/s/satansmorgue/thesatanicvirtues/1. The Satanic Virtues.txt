Satan represents vital existence
Instead of spiritual dreams.
Satan represents pure wisdom
Instead of hypocrisy.

Unstoppable ruin will be here
Screams and rains of fair.
If desire is freedom
Welcome to Satan's kingdom.

Satan represents kindness to the mouthed
Instead of showing love to ungrateful.
Satan represents revenge
Instead of showing course or abuse

Unstoppable ruin will be here
Screams and rains of fair.
If desire is freedom
Welcome to Satan's kingdom.
