Outside the window I peek at the world parade
Oh, how can people find their own way?
So many faces passing by every day
Alone and cold, my future's nothing more
than a confused stain in a distorting mirror maze

You can guide me through the mirror
define a sharp outline of my
obscure reflection
You can see what I can become
and teach me how to bring the light
when darkness falls

Silent, I strain my ears trying to capture
between this mystifying noise the only note
which can resound crystal clear in my core

You can guide me through the mirror
define a sharp outline of my
obscure reflection
You can see what I can become
and teach me how to bring the light
when darkness falls

That future's hidden in your eyes
That note is in your voice
You can bring the light

You can guide me through the mirror
define a sharp outline of my
obscure reflection
You can see what I can become
and teach me how to bring the light
when darkness falls

You can guide me through the mirror
define a sharp outline of my
obscure reflection
You can see what I will become
together we will bring the light
where darkness falls
