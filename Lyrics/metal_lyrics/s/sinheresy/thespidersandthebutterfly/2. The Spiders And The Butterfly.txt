A winking of light in the shadow down
you followed it without suspicion and now
slowly your conscience is fading away
smothered by a painful torpidity haze

Helpless you're wondering how and why
you end up paralysed by invisible wires
a flash of awareness, finally you see
the spiders close on in the web they're weaving

Slimy and spiteful, they can't recognize
that they're merely leading a pretence of life
butterfly, you've got nothing to share
with those cunning treacherous planners of traps

Fly, fly away...

Let them play their low-comedy
and die away in their meanness
They don't deserve but pity
Their whole lives are not worth
a single beating of your heart

You dance in your flights with all rainbow's hues
the sun and the breeze kiss and caress your beauty
who hatches in darkness is envious of this
and tries to constrain you in the same poverty

Fly, fly away...

Let them play their low-comedy
and die away in their meanness
They don't deserve but pity
Their whole lives are not worth
a single beating of your heart

As you thrashed around to hole the cocoon
you must find the strength for this new birth
Your spirit belongs to the sky
they will not prevent you from flying

Look, how small they seem from here
from the heights of your freedom
They don't deserve but pity
Underneath your wings blows the passion
they can not know nor even steal

Let them play their low-comedy
and die away in their meanness
They don't deserve but pity
Their whole lives are not worth
a single beating of your heart
