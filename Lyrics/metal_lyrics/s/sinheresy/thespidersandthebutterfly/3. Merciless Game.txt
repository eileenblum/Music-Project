You cannot try to escape from me!

Hey! Do you think that it's over?
I'm not through yet with you
Down in the spiral of your untold obsessions
you know I can drag you everywhere I want

Aren't you tired of playing
hunter and prey with me?

Oh, really I don't need to hunt you
you were and you are always in my hands

Grip my heart in those hands
tear it at your whim

Merciless game, I submit to my fate
a target too easy for your unerring aim
Torment and delight in these wounds sublimate
I will always be your slave

Aren't you tired of playing
hunter and prey with me?

Merciless game, I submit to my fate
a target too easy for your unerring aim
Torment and delight in these wounds sublimate

I will always be   You will always be
I will always be   You will always be
I will always be   my slave
your slave
