Here you are for the nth time lying on my bed
pressing on my body that you know only too well
Do you want me? Hurry up 'cause time is running fast
make me yield to your betrayal and feed your lust

I can't resist temptation Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Don't you know?
she isn't enough to erase you Â  Â Who plays with fire
my goddess of pure pleasure Â  Â  soon gets burnt

Use me 'til you'll vent on me
your blame, your rage
Temptation flame
Use me 'til you'll hear me scream
your name again and again

You're the one who's treading reason and morality
but it's me who in the end will figure as the bitch
so confess that you love madly this exciting thrill
then return to her pathetic crawling on your knees

I can't resist temptation Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Don't you know?
she isn't enough to erase you Â  Â Who plays with fire
my goddess of pure pleasure Â  Â  soon gets burnt

Use me 'til you'll vent on me
your blame, your rage
Temptation flame
Use me 'til you'll hear me scream
your name again and again
For you I am a doll to play with
and to throw away
Temptation flame
Use me 'til you'll dirty me
with all your shame

Use me 'til you'll see me bleed

Use me 'til you'll vent on me
your blame, your rage
Temptation flame
Use me 'til you'll hear me scream
your name again and again
For you I am a doll to play with
and to throw away
temptation flame
Use me 'til you'll dirty me
with all your shame
