Soon it will be again November
and my memories will pull me back
to the days I used to sleep in your wings
oh, I'd give my whole lifetime to be still there

I don't care if someone thinks
I'm a fool 'cause I still
wear the jewel you gave to me

Just me and you know what we
have passed through these years
laughs, glances, kisses and tears
In a small place of our hearts
I'll be forever yours and
you will be forever mine

Kept and broken promises on your lips         Could you ever forgive me?
for my choice I can taste no more                Give me another chance
but sometimes I wish I could embrace you    to live my dream
how I miss the tender warmth of your skin     In my silences I still love you

I don't care if someone thinks
I'm a fool 'cause I still
listen to the song you sang for me

Just me and you know what we
have passed through these years
laughs, glances, kisses and tears
In a small place of our hearts
I'll be forever yours and
you will be forever mine

Bright, you walk in the light
oh, I pray you, don't look back

Just me and you know what we
have passed through these years
laughs, glances, kisses and tears
In a small place of our hearts
I'll be forever yours and
you will be forever mine

We will be forever us
we will be forever us
