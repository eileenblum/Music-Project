Unreality becomes concrete
in the vacuity behind my lids
as I slowly fall into a disturbed sleep

Wandering my mind's deseases with
a subtle sense of poisoning
I can vaguely perceive that soon you'll creep in

Lost in the shadows
haunting my head
Make me yours once more
in your nightmare

Insolent you rummage through my fears
you violate my memories
creating a distorted world of spectral deceits

I give in to you wrapped in these veils
Oh, daylight is too far away
and I know my praying will lead to no other way

Lost in the shadows         "I'm the cloud that the moon covers
haunting my head             I'm the shout that suddenly breaks the silence
Make me yours once more      I'm the touch that makes blood run colder
in your nightmare            This night I'll be whatever makes you shudder"

Lost in the shadows         "I'm the cloud that the moon covers
haunting my head             I'm the shout that sudden breaks the silence
Make me yours once more      I'm the touch that makes blood run colder
in your nightmare            This night I'll be whatever makes you shudder"
