So - come on
for there is nothing wrong
we are - the same
kids we were before
Just - a bit
more cheeky, less naive
Stunned - you see me
and I guess you're wondering

Who's this girl, she falls and stands up again
teeth and claws, she faces the world today
Can't believe when I realize that in me
she now raises the admiration of a man

We're made for sin, why don't you let yourself go, it's unavoidable
When clouds are full of electricity it takes no long to the storm

Don't - deny
it's written in your eyes
your - desire
perfectly matches mine
Up - to now
we've just joked around
but - this time
lust crossed all the bounds

Tell me please, how can I handle this?
Out of control you're driving my fantasies
Take the chance and it's enough a glance
to understand how I want to kiss your lips

We're made for sin, why don't you let yourself go, it's unavoidable
When clouds are full of electricity it takes no long to the storm
We're made for sin, why don't you let yourself go, it's unavoidable
When clouds are full of electricity it takes no long to the storm

Above us darkness is burning
Lightnings and thunders, my senses fired up by your touch
The first drops of passion are falling down
can't ask the sky to stop them now

We're made for sin, why don't you let yourself go, it's unavoidable
When clouds are full of electricity it takes no long to the storm
We're made for sin, why don't you let yourself go, it's unavoidable
When clouds are full of electricity it takes no long to the storm
