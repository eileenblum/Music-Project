"We are justice, we're compassion
we are pride and faith
We are loyalty, we are guilt and grace
But above this there's a lonely
star we have to follow
to elevate our humanity"

Summer blue skies
without shadows, your eyes

Yours, dark waters
where a rose petal floats

Each other we chose
Unknown the reasons our hearts know

'Til the edge of the world
this I swore to damnation and beyond
'Til the edge of the world
with a kiss you have my sword

Where the Angels shed blood and tears
for the sake of their sons
we are picking the flowers of their perfect gift
Such a wholehearted freedom and peace
For the sake of our immortal souls
our steps will lead us to love

Can't withstand the
incoming tide of blessed desire

'Til my very last breath
I'll be faithful to my commandment
'Til my very last breath
I will serve and protect

Where the Angels shed blood and tears
for the sake of their sons
we are picking the flowers of their perfect gift
Such a wholehearted freedom and peace
For the sake of our immortal souls
our steps will lead us to love

"How much do we owe to
the love of Elua?
A white dove flies above
this chosen earth"

Where the Angels have shed blood and tears
for the sake of their sons
we are picking the flowers of their perfect gift
Such a wholehearted freedom and peace
For the sake of our immortal souls
our steps will lead us to love
