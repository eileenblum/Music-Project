Time to break with past
the siege in my head
drives me insane
One after the other
my every try to stand
is vain

I put up walls
of bitterness and contempt
against your constant presence
I put up walls
of sorrow and disappointment
and yet I'm defenseless

No distance can save me from
the gravity of your world
It's never the last fall
I know it is only my fault
but still I'm not strong
enough to let you go

What can I do now
the air is foul
of memories
Breathing is so hard
to confess I'm gone down
for egoism

I put up walls
of arrogance and ambition
I brought your love to mistrust
I put up walls
of excuses and pretensions
and all crumbled in dust

No distance can save me from
the gravity of your world
It's never the last fall
I know it is only my fault
but still I'm not strong
enough to let you go

I put up walls
of bitterness and contempt
against your constant presence
I put up walls
of sorrow and disappointment
and yet I'm defenseless

No distance can save me from
the gravity of your world
It's never the last fall
I know it is only my fault
but still I'm not strong
enough to let you go
