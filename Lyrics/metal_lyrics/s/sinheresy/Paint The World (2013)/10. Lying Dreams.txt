[Bonus Track]Every night I am consumed
by dreams that never, never come true
but I always fall asleep
hoping in another, another lying dream

I fear the truth in your smile
oh, my heart still, still desires lies

Lie to me
one more time
lie to me

Don't wake me up
the dawn is grey
these dreams instead rock my soul
with their ipnotic melodies

I know it's just an illusion
but does it really matter?
Enchanting mermaids' voices
my sweetest mates forever
I know it's just an illusion
but does it really matter?
Enchanting mermaids' voices

Lie to me
one more time
lie to me

Don't wake me up
the dawn is grey
these dreams instead rock my soul
with their ipnotic melodies
Don't want to face  
reality
I'm on the abyss of fantasies
somebody save me or push me down

I know it's just an illusion
but does it really matter?
Enchanting mermaids' voices
my sweetest mates forever
I know it's just an illusion
but does it really matter?
Enchanting mermaids' voices
