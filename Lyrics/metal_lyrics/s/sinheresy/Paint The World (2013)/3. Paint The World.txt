I won't fade anymore
in this greyness you're
a canvas where I can paint the world
From now on I know
I won't fade anymore

Hues of amber and gold
scudding with the autumn wind
as the leaves were falling at my feet
Falling at my feet

Streaked with cobalt shimmers
waves were breaking on the cliffs
but I couldn't see anything

Anything but
I won't fade anymore
in this greyness you're
a canvas where I can paint the world
From now on I know
I won't fade anymore

Twilight gives way to dawn
Black gets brighter with soft
indigo and purple shades

Through your eyes
now I see it all
I find a new inspiration
There are no lines
that I can't trace out
and I can free every emotion

I won't fade anymore
in this greyness you're
a canvas where I can paint the world
From now on I know
I won't fade anymore

What's the colour of a kiss?
Is it crimson or blue-green?
I can't describe it but on your body I can draw it
I can draw it

I won't fade anymore
in this greyness you're
a canvas where I can paint the world
From now on I know
I won't fade anymore

I won't fade anymore
