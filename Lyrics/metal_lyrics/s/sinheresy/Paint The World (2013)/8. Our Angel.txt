You left us, little wonderful child
If fate exists, it wasn't kind with you
You left us, while here we all were waiting
for you to live and grow up together

But at the time of your arrival suddenly
you changed your way

You flew in the sky like an angel
maybe up there they needed you
Even the greatest love in the world
wouldn't have kept you here, you already knew

You left us dismayed, full of tears
of sorrow and with our hearts broken
You left us, but you aren't absent
you are invisible

You keep your eyes surely celestial fixed on ours
swollen with crying

You flew in the sky like an angel
maybe up there they needed you
Even the greatest love in the world
wouldn't have kept you here, you already knew

"A photo and two prints, lovely memories of you
they will accompany us... forever"

You left us, but this moment will pass
time will heal this deep wound
and in our hearts, in our lives
we will always have our angel, you
