Don't want to talk 'bout what future is hiding
Don't want to listen to a paranoid babbling
Ready or not, we do need to survive it
Play your best cards
One man can be at the height of his success
One man can be on the brink of disaster
A wink of an eye and they are in each other's place
Play your best cards

Let's go on a bender and pass the hangover
We can turn soulmates, enemies, lovers
... simple friends? We can drink again!
Play your, play your best cards
Somebody says it is matter of tactic
Somebody says you have just to be lucky
but what we know for sure is we do know nothing
We do know nothing

Play your best cards
Right to the end

Come and go when you want
and set at rest your mind, you cannot call the tie
Rise and fall, game is on
This crazy gamblers' life leaves everyone behind
