Everyone of us hides a story made of scars
and sometimes shelters in a corner
So vulnerable, human heart's an animal
that doesn't want to break cover

If you want to back down I'll try to understand
but I just can't help it
I would, if I could give you a new innocence
so, please don't fear my caress

Everyone of us has to face more than once
that feelings are just a delusion
So much wasted time making a fool of our pride
just to come to the bitter conclusion

I know, it hurts to mend all the shattered hopes
but would you truly tell me
that it isn't worth pricking yourself with its thorns
if it's done to pick a rose?

I can't promise you eternity
but bare your soul for me
Whatever it takes, you won't regret
having yourself let go once again
Take me and make me as you want
I'll feed your dreams with my love
You're trembling and I can see what you feel
inside you a shy bud's already blooming

I can't promise you eternity
but bare your soul for me
Whatever it takes, you won't regret
having yourself let go once again
Take me and make me as you want
I'll feed your dreams with my love
You're trembling and I can see what you feel
inside you a shy bud's already blooming
