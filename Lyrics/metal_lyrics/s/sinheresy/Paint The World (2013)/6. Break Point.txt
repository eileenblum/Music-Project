Honey, is that a smile on your face?
You should come off your high horse
you're just a little simperer

Washed out the conceit and the make-up
nothing indeed is left of you
What the hell makes you think you're so cool?

Get away from my sight
as soon as you can
or I won't be responsible
for my actions
I'll kick your teeth!

This is my last gentle advice
listen with attention then
don't complain I didn't warn you, girl!

Get away from my sight
as soon as you can
or I won't be responsible
for my actions
I'll kick your teeth!

You dare to criticize me
thinking you're somebody
but haven't you understood it?
If you don't want to swallow
one by one all your words
you better give up this losing war

There is no place for both of us here
there is no place for both of us here
There is no place for both of us here
there is no place for both of us here

I waited down to the wire
but now my patience is over
Prepare to be under fire
This is the showdown, I'll make you grovel!

You dare to criticize me
thinking you're somebody
but haven't you understood it?
If you don't want to swallow
one by one all your words
you better give up this losing war

There is no place for both of us here
there is no place for both of us here
There is no place for both of us here
there is no place for both of us here
