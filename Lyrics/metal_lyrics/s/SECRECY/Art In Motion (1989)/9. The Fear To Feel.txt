Dark silhouettes
Dance on the wall
Surrounding me
Old photographs
Of days gone by
Staring at me

You have torn a hole in my life
Can you see me now
I can't seem to grasp why you're gone
Can you hear me now

My tears can't fill the empty space
You left in me
In silent cries and bleeding eyes
I hide away

You have torn a hole in my life
Can you see me now
I can't seem to grasp why you're gone
Can you hear me now

Infinite loneliness
Infinite loneliness

Catching a glimpse of what else
Of what else may be beyond
Of what else life is about
On borders to infinity
Eternity's so far away
And yet so near

I see myself
From out of a mirror of weakness
Stand beside your grave
Pretending you'll return to me
Somehow, somewhere, sometime

Inside a hole of despair
In bitter oppression I dwell
I suddenly begin to know
What you meant to me
Tearing out all that is left inside me
Can't follow
Can't follow you to where you're now
Leading me to driving me
To infinite loneliness

I see myself
From out of a mirror of weakness
Stand beside your grave
Pretending you'll return to me
Somehow, somewhere, sometime

I see myself
From out of a mirror of weakness
Stand beside your grave
Pretending you'll return to me
Somehow, somewhere, sometime
Infinite loneliness
