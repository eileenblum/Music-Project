I remember all the times
The song, the melody, the rhyme
Recurring in my mind when I met you

But it feels so strange
Is this all arranged?
All arranged by you
Yeah was nothing true?

And now you look past my eyes
As if you're waiting for a vice
To have a cause to leave again

You're going to take it without a feeling
Making your relation tactical
Do you really want to offend me in this way
Don't say: what do I care

I behold
You're so cold
Live and win
By your maxim

You say all your freedom's gone
You're sure of where you belong
Now you must budge from my side

I don't understand
Don't you need a hand
A hand of tenderness
What do you repress?

So we're here at daggers drawn
After calm now comes the storm
I never wanted this variance

You're going to take it without a feeling
Making your relation tactical
Do you really want to offend me in this way
Don't say: what do I care

I behold
You're so cold
Live and win
By your maxim

Never go back to where you come from
You gotta act with intellect

Oh it feels so strange
Is this all arranged
Was nothing true
Is this all arranged
Is this arranged
Arranged by you

Never go back to where you come from
You gotta act with intellect
Never go back to where you come from
You gotta act with intellect
