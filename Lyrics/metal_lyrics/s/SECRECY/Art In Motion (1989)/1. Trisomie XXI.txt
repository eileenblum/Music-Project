Now I'm here
You had the fun 'fore I could feel
Child to me
You called me sweet 'fore you saw me
My first word was not the word it used to be
Realize my fate is not your merciless!

You want to share my love
Feeling that it's right
You know the consequence
Holding me tight
Look what you're doing to me
Feeling that it's good
If you love me this way
Please let me out

I want to touch the sun
Want to feel a look of pride
Never float on clouds of lust,
Never tears cried out in pain
Feel my eyes
Be with me

You told me
You'd always be my helping hand
Good or bad
You'd always stay in tune with me
But to be a son of the lunatic ones
Means to be everything but sweet, loneliness

You want to share my love
Feeling that it's right
You know the consequence
Holding me tight
Look what you're doing to me
Feeling that it's good
If you love me this way
Please let me out

I want to touch the sun
Want to feel a look of pride
Never float on clouds of lust
Never tears cried out in pain
Feel my eyes
Be with me

I want to touch the sun
Want to feel a look of pride
Never float on clouds of lust
Never tears cried out in pain
Feel my eyes
Be with me
Feel my eyes
