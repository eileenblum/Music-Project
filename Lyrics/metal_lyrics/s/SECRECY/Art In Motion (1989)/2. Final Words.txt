Come take my hand
I'm standing here just waiting for your sign
My lessons in new ways
Have really changed your mind

Now you can see what seemed far away
Live in two worlds
You'll fade away if you wanna stay
Speak final words

Your cowardice is killing
All the feelings which rose between us
What yesterday seemed almost clear
Will today just be a lie

The other side
You try to show, to show them the new way
But you look in dull eyes
There's only black only white

Now you can see what seemed far away
Live in two worlds
You'll fade away if you wanna stay
Speak final words

Fade away
If you stay
What's to say
When the grief of choice is endless
Other side
Black and white
Stupid sight
You must tear apart what's senseless

Fade away

Now you can see what seemed far away
Live in two worlds
You'll fade away if you wanna stay
Speak final words
When the grief of choice is endless
When the grief of choice is endless
When the grief of choice is endless
