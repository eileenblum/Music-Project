Faster than fast
And better than best
We're gonna reach it
We've set our task
Demands to fulfill
While some of them still
Behind greed and need
What counts is thrill

This time I won't get away
This time no fault will come my way
This time I won't get away
This time no fault will come my way

Running down the memories
Wrapped up in desire
Oh after the fall there's nothing at all
But tears of an end and a smile for a friend
Keep on

Want to believe
Can I receive
Want to believe

But something was wrong
You can't get along
Searching to find the weak and the strong
These times of love come from above
They're the result of feeling and shove

This time I won't get away
This time no fault will come my way
This time I won't get away
This time no fault will come my way

Running down the memories
Wrapped up in desire
Oh after the fall there's nothing at all
But tears of an end and a smile for a friend
Keep on

Running down the memories
Wrapped up in desire
Oh after the fall there's nothing at all
But tears of an end and a smile for a friend
Keep on
But tears of an end and a smile
For a new beginning
