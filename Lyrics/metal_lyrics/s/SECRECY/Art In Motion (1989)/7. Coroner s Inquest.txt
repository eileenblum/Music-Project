For me there's nothing left to hide
They try to blind and scorch my mind
A change into a chrysalis

Truth is often bitter left unsaid
But I see the shadows in my hands
Sears of my loneliness

Self-knowledge, repressions, forthcoming fear
Which brings me to justice the ending is very near
Repentance of my conduct judges only myself
You can't be here but I need your help

The fading childhood argument
Degradation, I'm losing friends
The outcome of my decadence

Escaping on the wings of dreams
I've left behind all misery
I've gone through in reality

Self-knowledge, repressions, forthcoming fear
Which brings me to justice the ending is very near
Repentance of my conduct judges only myself
You can't be here but I need your help

Oh, I remember, the shadows in my hands
These signs of sorrow
They were my only friends
The silhouettes of guilt, a murderer's residue
Significations that make my cry insane

Self-knowledge, repressions, forthcoming fear
Which brings me to justice the ending is very near
Repentance of my conduct judges only myself
You can't be here but I need your help
