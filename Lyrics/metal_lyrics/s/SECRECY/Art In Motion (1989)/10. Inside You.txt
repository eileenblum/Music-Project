You turn your back from right to wrong
You realize dreams and hopes are long gone
Longing for the days that once had been
You socialise with fantasy and other dreams

Inside you're searching
Aiming to master the vile
Hatred is that what's
Inside you

Gazing at stars of the night
You realize, there's no path to the right
Do you understand that it's yourself
And no one else who reaches what you want
Inside you, inside you

Inside you're searching
Aiming to master the vile
Hatred is that what's
Inside you, you, you

Inside you're searching
Aiming to master the vile
Hatred is that what's
Inside you, you, you
