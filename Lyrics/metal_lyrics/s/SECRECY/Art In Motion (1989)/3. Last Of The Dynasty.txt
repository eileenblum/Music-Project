Chosen to be the one
To be the heaven's son
Lord of ten thousand years
You've to forget your fears
Must not show no tears

Last of the dynasty
End of your monarchy
Taken away
Your home will fade away

Ruler of all the land
Your reign turns to an end
You're forced to leave the town
They disallow your crown
Now you are dethroned

Last of the dynasty
End of your monarchy
Will you return?
First time you're real concerned

Forbidden city, China's ancient heart
This is the place where you have lived apart

Return and seize control
Cope by fair means or foul
Abused as a marionette
You ever had been led
Those times, you can't setback

Last of the dynasty
End of your monarchy
Will you return?
Now prove what you've learned

Wish of returning still remained a dream
History tells that you have kicked the beam
Wish of returning still remained a dream
History tells that you have kicked the beam

Last of the dynasty
End of your monarchy
Will you return?
Your home will fade away
