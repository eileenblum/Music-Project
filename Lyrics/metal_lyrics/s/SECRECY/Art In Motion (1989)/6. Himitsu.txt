I want you to tell your tale
But hesitation gleams in your eyes
What is it what makes you afraid?
With your feelings I don't wanna dice

Please tell me just the truth
Stop to pretend
And I'll comprehend
Never try to abuse
The words you say
I am your friend

Light my mind
Let my knowledge grow
Fight the enemy in yourself with candour
It detains you believe me it's true

Please tell me just the truth
Stop to pretend
And I'll comprehend
Never try to abuse
The words you say
I am your friend

Secrecy's your order
Come show me all your fears
Secrecy's your order
This must decay

You'll be sure if you do your task
You yourself have to tear down the mask
Now look inside, what do you see?
You get afraid when you see the debris

Burst your inner fear and free your reliance
Stop to obey your mistrust
And give yourself a chance
You're leather wrapper with the notice
Top secret, beware of this

Secrecy's your order
Come show me all your fears
Secrecy's your order
This must decay

Secrecy's your order
Secrecy's your order
