The morning has just begun
Good morning to everyone
I'm sorry I'm down again
Just tryin' to get up again

[Chorus:]
Can't you understand
Don't want to ruin your day
With my silly hate
Just can't understand
And I'll never accept
Those lives wasted in vain
What is it for?

Don't you get me wrong
This won't last for long
I just had a bad dream
Of a soldier's last scream
[Chorus]

[Chorus]
