I Masquerade

I'm not me
You're not you
What if I let
You see through
...my disguise
Would you leave
Would you stay
At my side
Or run away
...away from me
Beyond all pretence
What else would remain
Whatever you'd find
Would you stay the same

Let us stop
This masquerade
This poisoned game
Before it's too late
...to be true

II Dawn

No more hiding pain in shade
No more wearing a masquerade
