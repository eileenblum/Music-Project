Hello, do you remember me - ID DID NOT FORGET THOSE YEARS
You look as if you work too hard - OH, YES I GUESS THAT'S TRUE
What about the ideals you had in '68
To me it looks like you are now what you were fighting.
You were fighting then

[Chorus:]
It is ideological - all thoughts you might have
The pictures in your mind
Caused by social history

I CHANGED MY LIFE AND SETTLED DOWN
IT'S RESTFUL, PLEASANT, WELL TO ME IT'S OKAY, YOU SEE -
My friends live the same way
It must be the influence of society
That creates successfully
A new dictated ideology

[Chorus:]
It is ideological - all thoughts you might have
The pictures in your mind
Caused by social history
Consciousness - the only way to understand

All my thoughts - Ideology
And your thoughts - Ideology
My ideals - Ideology
No free will - Ideology
But in the past - Ideology
And what does last - Ideology
To understand life and men - is there a hope?
[Chorus]
