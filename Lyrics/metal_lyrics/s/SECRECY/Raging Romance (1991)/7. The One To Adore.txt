Ever have been a strong man
Conscious of the will to survive
Make my life with my own hands
Sure there was no one to rule my life

I was to proud -
To believe in a higher leader of life - never!

[Chorus:]
But the truth came to me
Love was filling the heart in me showed 
me the one to adore
Showed me things never seen before

He got the power of money
Was a rich man, so he felt so save
Ever dreaming of status of wealth
But this status locked him in a cage

Those iron bars -
Were created to keep all their slaves apart - from god

[Chorus:]
But the truth came to me
Love was filling the heart in me
Showed me the one to adore
Showed me things never seen before

She never felt religious
Magic's spirit was filling her mind
Evolution - her basic belief -
Destiny - they should see but they're blind

Lies all around

Enticement for all who don't care what's allowed
She says...

[Chorus]
Opened for me the door
Let me see I was blind
All my love for your light
