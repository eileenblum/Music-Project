Hear my 
bleeding heart...
The first to leave was the thunder
Long eight years were enough
Who can follow you?
The next one's for each a wonder
His words you can hear now
Try to understand

All success - what worth now?
Going on - tell me how
Perception seems so clear
But there's fear

[Chorus:]
The wall of sorrow keeps us asunder
So we got times of tears
No power to hold
No strength for a friend

Some hearts are in deep depression
Love's butterfly's dying
Is this divine proof?
The music is fading 
slowly
If reality calls us
Heavy metal's end?

Reaching for a higher aim
We will not be the same
Our union - shivering
Shall we sing?

[Chorus]

Life's meaning - what worth now?
Going on - tell me how
Reaching for a higher aim
We will not be the same
