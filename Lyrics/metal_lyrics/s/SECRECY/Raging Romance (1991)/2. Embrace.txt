A new truth's surrounding me
Reflecting what I used to be

I read the word and doubt it still
But it says the promise'll be fullfilled

I feel the change and don't know how
my deepest hope it starts to grow ...and grow

I roamed the world's philosophy
Searched for an aim to set me free

Could it be, the answer's here?
Right before my eyes so clear?

A new warmth, like an embrace,
Saves me from mind's endless maze ... endless maze
