Everytime, every whisper turned to cold
You just can't hide your heart of stone
In this life you have almost lost your faith
Stay here tonight until the storm fades away

One day I thought
I heard you cry when I was gone
One day I will come
I hope I can see your smile

Sometimes life doesn't have a meaning
Every frozen kiss is like shivers down my spine
In this life you have almost gone away
Don't stay tonight your heart will blow

One day the sun will shine
Other day the dead will rise
One day I will die
