An eternal life
Waiting for your love
Let's leave
Be free

I am a broken heart
Don't tear me apart
Let's leave
Be free

You're my love and death
Follow your heart

Falling, falling
You're my love and death
Follow, follow
Give me your heart

The story of my life
Such a perfect life
Let's leave
Be free

I gave you my love
Don't ruin my life
Let's leave
Be free

You're my love and death
Follow your heart
