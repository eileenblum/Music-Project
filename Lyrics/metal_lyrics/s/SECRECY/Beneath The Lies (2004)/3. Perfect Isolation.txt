I'm in perfect isolation
Surrounded by people
But in perfect isolation
Surrounded by pure noise
But still in perfect isolation
Surrounded by your voice
Surrounded by your arms
Surrounded by your breath
But still in isolation
Alone in isolation

I'm alive and you are all dead to me

I'm in perfect isolation
Surrounded by a sea of people
But in perfect isolation
I'm not dead, I'm alive
But still in perfect isolation
Surrounded by emptiness
Surrounded by foolish people
Surrounded by a dark light
But still in isolation
Alone in isolation

I'm alive and you are all dead to me
