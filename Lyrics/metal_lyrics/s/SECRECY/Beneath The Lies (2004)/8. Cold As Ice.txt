Strange days, strange nights
Bad feelings in my mind
Strange ways, silence cries
Always walking in the night

In the darkest nights
My thoughts are always dark
I see vampires in the night
They're thirsty for my blood
Trying to get my soul
They're always in control

You have to run
You have to hide
Don't go away
And never say goodbye
Don't ever try
Refresh your mind
Don't ever cry
And look behind

My heart is like a stone
As cold as the coldest ice

Strange people dressed in black
Trying to find a place to hide
Strange rumours, the night cries
Always running from the sun

My heart is like a stone
As cold as cold as ice
