Believe in wisdom
Believe in mankind
But the wisdom of mankind
Is nothing but a myth
Believe in passion
Believe in life
But the passion of a lifetime
Is nothing but a myth

I believe in magic
Believe in love
I believe in freedom
Believe in you

But the magic of love
Is nothing but a myth

Believe in people
Believe in freedom
But people's freedom
Is nothing but a myth
Believe in beauty
Believe in wildness
But the beauty of wildness
Is nothing but a myth

But the magic of love
Is nothing but a myth
It's magic it's the magic of love
