I can hear someone saying
I'll be back, will you cry for it?
But I'll be dead, will you cry for it?
Cry for me and I'll cry for you
Who's talking and who's crying for?

I can hear someone screaming
I'll be out, will you cry for it?
But I'll be alive, will you cry for it?
Cry for me and I'll cry for you
Who's talking and who's crying for?

Please show me the light
At the end of my own tunnel
Show me what's wrong, what is right
How love always tumbles
When confronted with temptations
And all kind of frustrations
Now it's time to pray
Time to think and say
