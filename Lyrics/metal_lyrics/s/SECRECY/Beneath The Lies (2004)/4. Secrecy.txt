Hey you look me in the eyes
And tell me what you see
Another shining silhouette
Crawls inside of me
How can you describe
The changes that I live
When whispering darkness
Doesn't let me breathe

So what can I say
When there isn't a way
That reveals what covers the night
Silence is embraced
By those that wouldn't change
Turning darkness into light

In a sacred why
Death is on my side
That is the design
That is craved in my life
I'd rather walk lost
And alone in the dark
'cos I know the truth
Will tear us apart

There's no other way
To keep me safe
From the ignorance of mankind
I only have to face
That's a sad disgrace
If I have to hide beneath the lies
