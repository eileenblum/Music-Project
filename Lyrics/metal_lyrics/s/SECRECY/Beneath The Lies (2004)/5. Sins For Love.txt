The pain is so strong
Strikes my heart and soul
My body is trembling with cold

I hear strange cries
Everybody has died
And I will survive

I am what I am
But most of the time
No one gives a damn
Suffering is in my mind
Wondering what can I do
To show you
That I still
Love you

Sins for love
Sins for pain
Sins for love

My lips are warm and dry
I feel you inside
This is the longest night

Like poison in my blood
I hear your soul cry
And I'm feeling so shy

Sins for love
Sins for pain
Sins for love
Sins for love
Hiding my pain
Sins for pain
Confusion in my brain
Sins for love
