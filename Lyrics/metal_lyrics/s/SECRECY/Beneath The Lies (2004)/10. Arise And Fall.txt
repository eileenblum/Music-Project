Dark comes the night
Death comes in disguise
Here comes the crow
To carry your soul

They erased your light
They took your paradise
They joke on your face
And some said it was faith

Fly on
Fly on
Arise and fall

Like a bird in the sky
I wish I could fly
Another time another life
And you must say
Goodbye

Fly on the crow's wings
Hear the rain sing
See through his eyes
You can see the stars shine

He is the passenger
He could be a stranger
He's the flame that kept your soul
Knowing you're the devil's son

Please look into my eyes
Let me lead you to paradise
Do you believe in angels?
Do you believe in god?
