You're just a child
Innocence in your desperate cry
You know the face of death
Dream with a man jesus christ

Disease in your eyes
Mysticism gone with your smile
Once life now a memory
The wings fall from the butterfly

Agony is deeply disguised
The appearance of neon lights
Did not avoid the pressure
Of dirty hands in your life

Scream loud to the dark night
You forget the sunshine
You can't leave the ancient labour
Sweet and dangerous as wine
