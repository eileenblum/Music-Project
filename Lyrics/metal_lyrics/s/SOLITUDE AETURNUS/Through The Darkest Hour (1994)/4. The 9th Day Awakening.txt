"The day has dawned
But not the light
Clouds like black ink
Spill through the sky
I feel an anger Pulsing through my veins
All injustice
Driving me insane

Another novice dark soul
Crawls into sight
Twilight hands of murder
Carve faces in the light
Distant new worlds 
Whispers of their names
Stand up for battle 
Time to make a change

No tomorrow...

[CHORUS]
Strombringer hear me
Down for days
The rain will end
Strombringer hear me
Down for days 
Free again

Blind lead the blind
Devoid of truth 
Disharmony of madness
An orchestra of doom
Can't believe you let them
Tell you what to be
you've locked away tomorrow
and given up the key"
