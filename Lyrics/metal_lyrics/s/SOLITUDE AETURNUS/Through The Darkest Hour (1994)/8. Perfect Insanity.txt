"Sinister formations
Laughing in my head
The thorn of your existence
Drives me to the edge

Vile sweet serpent
Slither trance begin
Such a pitiful submission
Seduction fighting sin

[CHORUS]
Perfect insanity

Into oblivion
Into oblivion...

Don't blame me 
For all that's happened
I love it where I am
Beside this crimson lamplight
Flickering in my head
It's better here alone
No one will ever hear

And when the darkness
Blinks the eye of the sun
It will be me standing at home
And you...
Beginning to run

Exhume the force conception
Bodies dead since birth
Your life is prostitution
It's payment is a curse

Bathe the souls in talons
Prison the world in bonds
You dogs of Sodom
Raping the angels of gad"
