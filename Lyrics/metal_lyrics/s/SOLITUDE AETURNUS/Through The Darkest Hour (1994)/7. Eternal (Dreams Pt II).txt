Somewhere a shadow I shall be 
Existing inside eternity
Finding there my every move

A world without a need for time
Forever I walk where others hide
A burning thirst I feel inside
Strike me down-my soul to fly

[CHORUS]
Eternal
The infinite wasteland
Immortality's great demand

Alone in desperate salvation
A vision in ghostly dreams
Unknown to light or darkness
I possess the void in between

Can memories replace my existence
Does it matter in the end?
Which eternal path we've taken
Be it truth, deception, pain or fear"

[This song is part II of the "Dreams" trilogy. It explores the darker side of]
[immortality and even asks whether it is ultimately desirable. To live forever is]
[to have no hopes or dreams, nothing more to be gained, only endless]
[existance....-Lyle]
