"Emerald figures shining in darkness
Forty souls are locked in stone
A thousand eyes open to see
The wolves of ruin devouring me
Dying hearts of unkown voices
leave my hope under fallen stars
Their beating echoes only pain
Their blood red lips call out my name

Specters of somber sullen face
Piercing pale dry light of fire
Mirror's like silver maryrs
Falling from the sky
The clouds that line the bed of sleep
Pound with thunder underneath
My tired eyes that strain to see
All that reigns inside of me

[CHORUS]
Haunting the solace
Of the sleeping world
The darkness falls like lead

Haunting the Obscure...

Specters of a somber sullen face
Piercing pale dry light of fire
Voyeurs in my hour of darkness
When is it that they will rest
Like kings they come in deepest night 
A crown of thorns for lack of sight
To rule with voices cast in lead
Echoing forever in my head"

[Nightmares.-Lyle]
