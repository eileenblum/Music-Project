"Leave me now my weary soul
Like the rain of sorrow falls
Through the cracks of crumbling stone
Deep within my walls

See me now my empty life
Throw away all your lies
The tears for all the angels
Will never reach the sky

[CHORUS]
The shadow and the sun
Are no longer one
Have I lost the light?
Shatter my Spirit tonight

I've given all that I can give
It never seemed enough
My blood is in this fire 
Burning all my trust

Another face of a sunless day
Another moonless night
I must surrender to the dream
I can no longer fight

I cannot pretend...
This is the end

So leave me now my weary soul
My sorrow here is spent
These foolish lies that we deny
Are taking all we give"

(a short passage by Lyle Steadham)
Through the Darkest Hour was written during a time when the band was involved 
with a label change and uncertainty plagued the future. The music as a result 
grew darker, harder, and more experimental. The lyrics also reflect this time of 
despair. Songs deal with the aspects and experiences of depression and anger, 
sometimes keeping an eye on the light at the end of the tunnel, but often times 
not. I tried to create different types of dark imagery in much of the lyrics 
instead of always trying to necessarily make a point. These lyrics are by far 
the most personal to myself and the other band members. We hope to identify with 
those, like us, who have been through their own darkest hour.
