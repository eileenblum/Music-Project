"I walk in the sands of Eden
Where the blue pyramids sleep
I close the world behind me
For my future soul to keep

longer than I want to know them 
Spawning dirges fill my veins
A ritual reaction
I drop the face and play the game
I growl at familiar strangers
The sands are needles there
The dust will crawl in anguish
Like the bones inside my lair

[CHORUS]
Move You fall And we die

Move into the circle 
You fall on your knees
And we die here waiting
You fall on your knees

Won't somebody tell me why
Somebody please show me where
I lost that dream sensation
In this bitter midnight air
We melt inside of centuries
Awaiting new arrivals
Dressing in lost shadows
like costumes for the dying"

[This is the dark side of drugs and black magic, an appropriate addition to the Darkest Hour.-Lyle]
