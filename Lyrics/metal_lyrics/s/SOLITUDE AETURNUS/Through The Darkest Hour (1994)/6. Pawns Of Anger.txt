"Distant faces
Cold dark eyes
Another lonely place to hide
False intentions
Vague disguise
The veil of fear you stand behind

Forbidden fruit
Frozen time
Blind ambitions draws your line
Awaken
Arise
Or never break these ties

Deception lingers like pain
you always harvest the lies
you make believe

[CHORUS]
Another lie from the pawns of anger
Midnight sons of death
They ring the bells of darkness
Breath the burning air...
so go ahead and kneel or bow
I will choses to stand
Until the end
Until the end...

There's blood on the walls
A mask in the hall
A killer in your midst
Pray he does not wake
Before the dawn"

["If you listen to fools-the mob rules." Ronnie James Dio 1981 -Lyle]
