Moments last to our closing eyes
No one gets out alive
The ring of truth bears no weight
Of prophesy none too late

The glassy eye of measured time
A witness to our mortal lies
On we stride our love behind
Too blind to see the other side

Destroy
The hourglass
Unchain the sands of time

Fly on...
Return our chance for life

Pouring sand... Drowning souls
Rising... Falling... Beyond control

Tears of hope now lost to me
Cast upon the ancient sea
Forever trapped behind the glass
Tomorrow now becomes the past
