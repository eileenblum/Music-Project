Today I weep
And who shall do the same
For empty halls and shadowed flames
For kin that nigh remain

Tonight I sleep
And nightmares have their reign
In grayish dawns and visions gone
The world is not the same

Tomorrow see
A lonely child in pain
His father torn in tides of war
But tears cannot regain

I cannot believe
As I see the fading sun
The child has turned and gone away
The future now is done
