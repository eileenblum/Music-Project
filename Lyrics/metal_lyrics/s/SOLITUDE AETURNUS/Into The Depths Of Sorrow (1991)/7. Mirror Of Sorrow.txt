In a blackened blur of crowding clouds
I dropped my sorrow among the leaves
I took my place as wise men do
As the storm prepared its release

Through raging winds and weeping skies
I sat in the loneliness of solitude
I washed my eyes in growing streams
Earth's resistance
True magnitude

As black sky faded to blue
And again the Earth felt the sunrise
A silver mirror stood before me
Bequeath of the silent rainbow
A beautiful mirror of radiant splendor
As ominous as the autumn moon
It brought upon me endless wonder
Yet spoke of some unknown doom

As I reflect back on this day
No words could ever tell...
I saw my world
But could not see myself

In strange visions
And through the windows of dreams
We solemnly gaze beyond
What is revealed to our eyes
Exists already in our minds
