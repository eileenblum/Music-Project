It's devastation that we've taken
Shaping form with faceless smiles
Laying to waste all the miles
And hours of memories like fading bells

Soil and sodden we kiss the ground
Below the nameless tears of trees
Weeping in their forgotten willows
The eyes that cry like wishing wells

These are the nameless
Better beware
These are the nameless
Faces we wear

And know that we are ever there
Inside the room you lay your bed
In everything you've ever said
And every fire you've ever fed

Secrets hidden from the light
Buried in our children's hearts
Immortal now they dream the dreams
That no one thought they could conceive"
