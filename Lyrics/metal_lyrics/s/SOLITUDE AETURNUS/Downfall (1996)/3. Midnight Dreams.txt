"Welcome to this world...
Transformation supreme
I am sleepless from the power in my veins

My past is gone...
Incantation serene
Entering the threshold of a pure disease

These Midnight Dreams
Stolen from god
Just to make you believe
In these Midnight Dreams

No longer pain
Damnation in me
My body fits the guise of infamy
Cleanse myself within
Discard this bitter skin

you here at my side
Look into these lupine eyes
It can't be so far away
Nothing can keep me chained

Nothing left to hide
Alienation complete
What I am is all I'll ever need

The time is short
Humans are weak
Breaking down the doors inside of me"
