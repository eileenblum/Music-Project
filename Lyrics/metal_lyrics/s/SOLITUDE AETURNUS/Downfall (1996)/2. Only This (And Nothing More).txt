"We all fear the word extinction
So we bite the hand that feeds
The same teeth that clean our neighbors
Father pery we eat

Drifting in the hollow heavens
It's always more than we can see
And all the children scream to someone
starving on defeat

Only this and Nothing more
Only what we care to see
Only this and Nothing more
Shall be lifted evermore

What are the names they call you?
Copulation short of steel
Like parasites we hate to shelter
Mother pray we heal

Feel the burial in my chest
Kiss the unborn skin
Words like fucking helter skelter
Lonely razors in the wind

Have we finally gone too far?
Nothing more to bleed
And now these daggers lay before me
All I'll ever need"
