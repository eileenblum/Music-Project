"Slipping forward
with a propensity for madness
tethered but taut
reality at the tip of four fingers
or is it insanity?
yesterday was my tomorrow
but today is my problem
do i know what i know?
do i think what i think?
it has never left my side
nor ever left me alone
but always eludes me
my elysium..."
