"Alive here be another's choice
I return the gift to my maker
Relinquish the pain
Of the intimate stranger

Sing with golden tongue
For my brother's eternal rest
He was me and I was he
In these halls of sorrow

In this chapel of burning
Whisper to me

Worn out memories burn
He's calling to me again
Like a passing friend
bowing at my window

In this chapel I burn
My soul's true dark home
Beckoning endless tears
that mystic figure i fear

The autumn dance of fire
the faces laugh alone
To meet me tomorrow"
