"The only answer is annihilation
Everything taken from the eternal fountain
Ungrateful beasts
Demanding more than should have ever been given

Blind to our own transgressions
We've condoned this atrocity
The problem only multiplies
Darkness begetting darkness

We've lost our hold
Giving Up is easiest
A sea of Hatred

Apprehension and fear make our decisions
Allowing innocent lives to be lost
Searching for harmony
We stick to our own
While others try to divide

I'm afraid that now it is too late
The only thing left now is to huddle
Together And Wither"
