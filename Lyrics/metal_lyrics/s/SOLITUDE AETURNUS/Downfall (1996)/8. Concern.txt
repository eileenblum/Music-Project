"Losing my grip on concern
The endless circle mocks my existence
Only sparks of beauty bind me to this plane

The simplicity of doing-drowned
And now you know why I die
I've found the fear deep inside

Motivation no longer a factor
Only sparks of hope push me away

Cretins of wishful thinking
We delude ourselves
Aspirations reaching no fruition

[Chorus (x2):]
Where is it that we go?
What is it that we seek?
What is it that we want?
Why do we receive what we receive?"

Trying to exists within the walls of reality
But what's the point?
the universe revolves alone

Talking to myself the words get lost
Shimmering sparkles catch my eye
and slowly fade

[Chorus]
