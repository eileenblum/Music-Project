Out of the sun appeared three men
Or so it seemed to be
Abram saw and rushed to greet
These godlike entities
Prepare a feast my chosen wife
That we may honor these
A festive mood soon turned to grief
When told their destiny
The leader spoke of degradation
That was close at hand
Came to verify a grievious outcry from the land
Be the people righteous souls
Then this I want to know
But if the accusation's true
To then my wrath I'll show

Where angels dare to tread
Where angels dare to tread
No one is forgiven unless they know the word
How can you speak what you haven't heard

Up to the gates of Sodom went Emissaries of the Lord
Lot was there and bowed to them
As Abram did before
Leave this city with wife and daughters
Unto the mountains thee
Death will come to sinners glory I tell you flee

Where angels dare to tread
Where angels dare to tread
No one shall be saved unless they see the signs
How can you see when you are blind

A chill is running through me
Remembering that day
Thoughts of pity and sorrow
For those about to die
It would seem as though the world will never change
On again this night
Thread the angels and I...

To be continued...
