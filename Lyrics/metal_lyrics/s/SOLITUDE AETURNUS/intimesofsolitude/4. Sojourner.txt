Raise the sails on the ship of life
Set a course that will take you far
Open seas aren't hard to find,
With some faith you can reach the stars

Rise above your troubled self
And you'll be surprised at what you find
Inner peace in the realms of light
As the mortal world is left behind

Distant worlds where I long to be
With just a thought I'm almost there
Sailing high upon the starlight
Skimming clouds without a care
Sojourner...

Darkness fades when I think of light
The power rests in what's behind your eyes
Deceitful men aren't hard to find,
They haven't faith so they preach their lies

Rise above these foolish wretches
See them cower as they burn your flesh
And though the flames are rising high
The curse is on him who cried out witch

Distant worlds where I long to be
With just a thought I'm almost there
Sailing high upon the starlight
Skimming clouds without a care
Sojourner!

Condemned for what he dared to teach
They labeled him a heathen
Yet ways of God he preached

Stoned by all the men of hate
And burned upon a cross
Till darkness fills their stage

They cried the day he took his leave
They begged for his return,
For the light again they screamed

Sojourner!

Oh, mother Earth, I beg of you
Release thy hate and I shall forgive
For there is eternal love
And without this love you cannot live

I shall return upon the wind,
The clouds shall be steps up to my door
One day the door will open wide
And you shall see that I have not died
