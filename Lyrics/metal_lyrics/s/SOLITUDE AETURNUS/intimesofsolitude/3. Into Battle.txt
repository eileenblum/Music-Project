Harken to the voice
Of the insane prophets of Hell
Calling out to all the foolish men
And so the papacy will listen

It is your destiny
To take the sword from the fallen angel
The world is filled with anger
As the flames are fanned by the hand of God

You are the sacrifice,
The mark that you bear has its price
Into battle the heathens are led
As heretics so shall you die

Baptized in fire
Men of wealth now vie for power
Crusaders marching,
Using piety as their disguise

On a clear winter night
When Nibiru on high
Reveal to man the antichrist
As children march to die

For you who've heard
The voice of the deceiver
He feeds his puppets lies in kingly garb
This monarch shall arise

Exploiting millions candidly
He now assumes his role
In priestly garb,
Hell take away your soul

It is your destiny
To take the sword from the fallen angel
The children scream for vengeance
And the chosen one from among them rises

You are the sacrifice,
The mark that you bear has its price
Into battle the heathens are led
As heretics so shall you die

Revel the liar,
I'll live to see your legions cower
The rapture's calling out its warning
Into battle...
