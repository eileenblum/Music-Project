A mental aberration
thrust in to such
a perfect world
I am wrong 
you are right
what can I do - to please
I could never see with your eyes
This is the season
of a falling moon
Torn from above
I could never see with your eyes
I could never think with your mind
Visions destroyed
I bow before
MY PERSONAL GOD
