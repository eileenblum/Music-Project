Pulled to the twisted spiral stairs
you falling down
The promise of the treasure bright in our eyes
Our movement sure
We fool ourselves
Taken like chattle in the gates of their keep
Shrouded in ignorance we bow at their feet

[CHORUS]
Sacrificing the world outside
to suffer mental pictures in my mind
To drown in delusions

Pulled to the twisted spiral stairs
you falling down
Unpainted pictures trick the blind to see
Our thoughts clear
We fool ourselves
