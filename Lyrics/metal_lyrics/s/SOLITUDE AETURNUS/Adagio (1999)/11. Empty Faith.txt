And by the hands of my god I wash myself clean
With the rivers below
That flow into my mind
Falling through the abyss of life
The shadow that is mine engulfs
Pulling at - bending - My realization
(No this cannot be)
(No this should not be)
Looking forward I see the nothingness that approaches
Perhaps I'll embrace the intangible
(Spinning a web around your world)
