Insanity's circles continue their motion
Whispers of words fall to the floor
mental battles fought and won again
Tripping through haze - Hate and anger revel
the words within my mind sing songs of praise 
Melodies of unkown
A dying world of life engulfed upon itself
Visions marred by thoughts - Setting ourselves on
Indulging myself in dreams of never realities
Groping for meaning - We eventually fall
Tomorrow is always there
Hopes for a new day we enlighten our souls 
As we bleed ourselves - We spawn rivers of doubt

Insanity has thin walls
