Eating from the sacrificial - tainted bowl
Ripping out the roots our our conciousness
We all go blind

into the void

[CHORUS]
By the hands of - doom
Pushed to the - wall
Fear the inescapable - you all will fall
No one is spared - you all will crawl

Burning out from the rhetoric - holy words
We sell our souls
