Flesh peeled exposing the rotting scent of death
The center of damnation
Tears shed falling into the abyss
Sorrow wraps its arms

On knees I bend wounds enrapture
Breaking â writhing â Godâs pain eternal
Into oblivion once again â sights focus
With blind resolve â killing the child

[x2]
Born from life
The stench of pleasure
Drowned in failed visions
A rip through time

Destroyed and beaten â a black shadow looms
Destroyed and beaten â the shadow looms

[x2]
Born from life
The stench of pleasure
Drowned in failed visions
A rip through time

Take me
Laid â exposed
And dead
A world bears upon
This wretched creature

The prayers of relief â soon unanswered
The child â further into the dark fades
Obliterated by the hands of the now dead
Upon my side they rest

No longer wishing for life
The child lets go
The child lets go
Buried in blood
