Paths illuminated by hell's fires
Floating onward to end's demise
Turn to see the once was
Turn to see what was
This spirit flails with twisted motion
Another claimed by Godâs delusions
This spirit flails with twisted motion
Another claimed by Godâs delusions

With a weary heart
Accepting defeat
Soiled from within
Tainted by existence

Softly speaking with tongues of anguish
The calm invades breath the foul air
Composed of nothing I return to nothing
Composed of nothing I return
Reclaimed again the beauty departs
Wings of life never gain flight
Reclaimed again the beauty departs
Wings of life never gain flight

With a weary heart
Accepting defeat
Soiled from within
Tainted by existence

Goodbye to the known
Embrace the black hell
Names for demons still unknown
Floating onward to end's demise
The calm invades breath the foul air

This spirit flails with twisted motion
Another claimed by Godâs delusions
This spirit flails with twisted motion
Sightless as the flesh tears

[x2]
With a weary heart
Accepting defeat
Soiled from within
Tainted by existence
