Numbing the pain
Pathetic creations of unresolve
Pain controls from within
The dark knows me well
Draining my essence as I sit in silence
Walking empty through the rest of my days

Barren plains filling the void
Winds that chill, frozen in all movement
Repeating followed patterns
Days last for nothing, cold, so cold

Staring blindly into spiraling circles
Another injection of peace subdues
Am I tired or am I losing touch
Three stand before, binding the lost

Shattered days, shredding my skin
Bleeding the essence
The essence of black
The essence of black
The essence of...

Confusing the mental, emotions they fall free
Unrelenting and ceaseless
Split in two by night and day
No balance to be had

Shattered days, shredding my skin
Bleeding the essence
The essence of black
The essence of black
The essence of black
The essence of...
