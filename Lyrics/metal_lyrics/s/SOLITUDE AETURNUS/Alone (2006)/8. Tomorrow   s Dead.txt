Awash in waves of darkness
Light creeping, unwelcome

Visions behind these eyes
They melt into rivers of death
A burning desire, rips and tears
Drifting endlessly, days pass

Give me breath
Give me love
Give another day
Donât let me fade

Sorrow bleeds these veins
Another hour of loneliness
Waiting as the world falls apart

Give me breath
Give me love
Give another day
Donât let me fade
