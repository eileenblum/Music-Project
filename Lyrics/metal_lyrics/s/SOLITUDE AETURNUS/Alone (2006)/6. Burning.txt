Thoughts collide, raping shreds of sanity
Invading my mind through light and dark

A vision of beauty, spreading wings, envelope my soul
Breathing life, releasing the pain
Lighting flames upon a darkened path
Awaiting reprieve, one image burns

I no longer control myself
Pushed and pulled
beyond my strength
Eyes that shine, words unknown
Pushed and pulled
I no longer control myself

Awaking by chance, the spinning circle grows
A oyre fir rest, this body now limp
Silent prayers recite themselves
A pacing motion, well maintained

Dancing softly, a world stands still
Damp with sorrow as wounds yet bleed
Mindless tomorrows, havoc calls my name
Lucid and alone, death calls my name

I no longer control myself
Pushed and pulled
beyond my strength
Eyes that shine, words unknown
Pushed and pulled
I no longer control myself

She sends a voice, angelic sounds
Touching a heart, shrouded in mist
Lifting the veil, to receive the black
An angel descends, Godâs greatest gift
