A burning hate that grows
As the oneâs released from within, within my sphere
Tomorrow brings only plight
Another day of nothing
âPraise beâ to the one, the one that gives

Treasures, only a token of misguidance
A lie only to be lead and to be followed blindly
Release the pain
Follow your word
How can one, one believe
When hell is all that is given

Where is the truth
Where is the light
Where is the peace
Where is God
Where is the truth
Where is God

Desires to be
Desires to live

Who, who is the God
Forever spinning
Forever dead
Bent and twisted
A pleasure only you behold
Make the meager weak
Love they god and behold
Praise be

Where is the truth
Where is the light
Where is the peace
Where is God
Where is the truth
Where is God

Desires to be
Desires to live

Heaven is not far
but tied I go nowhere
Visions of life to be
are wasted thoughts
and time continually
beaten and dragged through life

Where is the truth
Where is the light
Where is the peace
Where is God
Where is the truth
Where is God

Desires to beâ¦
