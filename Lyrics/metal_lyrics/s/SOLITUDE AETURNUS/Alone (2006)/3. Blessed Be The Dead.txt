A dream, a lie
Nothing to be
A death, a loss
God gives nothing

Dreadful delusions
Blissful peace
Why do I ache?
Must find release
A nagging pain on and on
Back laid, sky above
Why do I ache?

Changing perceptions
A vision slowly dies
Pain within slowly grows

Save me, I fall
Again I fall
Save me, Iâm lost
Again Iâm lost
Blessed be thy dead

Dreadful delusions
Blissful peace
Why do I ache?
Must find release
A nagging pain on and on
Back laid, sky above
Why do I ache?
