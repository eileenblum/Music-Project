Setting sunlight embraces my body
As I stand upon a precipice of death
Faceless as the dark descends
Reclaiming a once vivid soul

Torn from this plain, not ready yet
Taken into the ethereal
Visions never achieved, lifeless and broken
A moment in time, wiped from existence

[x2]
Twisted and tainted
Black emotional pain
Drawing on lifeâs blood
Drowned by the hand of fate

Horizons with no movement, forever still
Falling rain, washing the dead
Mocking the motionless eternally damned
Dreams unfulfilled, dreams unfulfilled

As weakness takes hold, and binds
Screaming in silence, words falling, never heard
Taken into the dark dreams of substance
Bent beyond repair, beyond repair bent

Twisted and tainted
Black emotional pain
Drawing on lifeâs blood
Drowned by the hand of fate
