Sunlight fails you
The darkness falls
upon your â pale soft skin

Wet, dripping pain
bound by black
lucid dreams â from injected steel

[x3]
I see the sadness falling from your face
You cry out loud

The mounting fear
A muffled cry
Wide open â eyes spilling life

[x4]
Youâll still be waiting for the light
Waiting
