Hide your fucking smile 'cause I know you're betraying me, get out of my face!
(I see) you're pretending to be an honest man, your whole life is a lie
Try to be yourself, all the stories that you tell are false, so take off your mask
Because of you we're living in chaos, chaos...
You should be scared, like a rat in a cage.
Run away n' protect from me.

I want to know, the reason of your fall
No more apologies,
I don't believe your words
And I want to know, the bad that you have done
No more apologies, the liar is behind me

You'll pay for your sins, our lives don't deserve this plague, hail to apocalypse!
Friend of everybody, enemy of everyone, your future's the loneliness
(I'm) rising from a cruel deception, burning the remains of truth, the damage is done look into my eyes, the anger is flowingâ¦

I want to know, the reason of your fall
No more apologies,
I don't believe your words
And I want to know, the bad that you have done
No more apologies, the liar is behind me
