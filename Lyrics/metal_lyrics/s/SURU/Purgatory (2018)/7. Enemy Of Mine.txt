Pain is running through my veins like blood, but I know this is my sacrifice
I've been the misfit since I was a child, they're trying to change my mind

I don't want to be you, you're the other one
Forced to pretend, that you and me are the same
I just want to be me, I'm the only one
Against the world, world of bitterness

All my life, all your lifeâ¦ we're here together as eternal twins
Once we fought, once we died but live. You're the enemy, enemy of mine.

What are you all waiting for? Should I know: what do you expect from me?
I fail (yeah I fail) I'm failing every day but I learn from my mistakes
I'm so tired but I'll never give up

I don't want to be you, you're the other one
Forced to pretend, that you and me are the same
I just want to be me, I'm the only one
Against the world, world of bitterness

All my life, all your lifeâ¦ we're here together as eternal twins
Once we fought, once we died but live. You're the enemy, enemy of mine.
