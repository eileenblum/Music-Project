Drowned in the swamp of sadness, a cruel life full of regrets
Pessimism and disappointment, just the last man on my earth
It's a struggle against the darkness, I'm damned since I was a child
No one can help me to save my soul, son of sin I amâ¦
Always guilty of all the faults
I'm suffering in this world

Once more I fall down on my knees
Once more I escape, no way out, no way out
Once more, I hide myself behind a mask
Another poor man who dwells in the purgatory

Too late for absolution, so far to cross the line
The void is my obsession, I feel the end inside
It's not time for redemption, all prayers were not enough
There's no faith in my conscience yet, just shadow in myâ¦ blood

Once more I fall down on my knees
Once more I escape, no way out, no way out
Once more, I hide myself behind a mask
Another poor man who dwells in the purgatory
