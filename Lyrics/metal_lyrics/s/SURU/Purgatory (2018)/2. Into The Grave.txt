Grey is the color of my lips, the kiss of doom
Would you take me in your arms? A cold embrace
Call me when you need my blood, my name is farewell
Gimme love and darkness

I will follow you 'til sorrow, I'll fall into the grave, take my soulâ¦ I will pay
I will follow you 'til death, I'll rest into the grave, take my lifeâ¦ I will pay

Fear of oblivion, I'll be a dead memory
Buried deep inside your freezing heart, I dwell
With your sweetest smile I pray to disappear
Kill my light with sadness

I will follow you 'til sorrow, I'll fall into the grave, take my soulâ¦ I will pay
I will follow you 'til death, I'll rest into the grave, take my lifeâ¦ I will pay

Under the threshold of tears
Slowly I escape from myself
Inside the forest of shadows
I walk alone, I walk alone

I will follow you 'til sorrow, I'll fall into the grave, take my soulâ¦ I will pay
I will follow you 'til death, I'll rest into the grave, take my lifeâ¦ I will pay
Into the sorrow, into the graveâ¦ take my soul I will pay
Into the sorrow, into the graveâ¦ take my life I will pay
