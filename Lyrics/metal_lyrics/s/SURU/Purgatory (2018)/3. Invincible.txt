Stupid and envious are trying to destroy our world
With lies you hurt us but we're stronger than ever before
(We) Refuse the false words, we hate the empty honesty
Your dark intentions, we recognize them in your faceâ¦ in your face.

The fight is forever, it's hard to walk on this path
The result of effort is killing our high hopes
The future is over, the end is coming to stay
But we're survivors, this life is worth living

You come close to me
Oh no, we won't be alone anymore
If you fall I will be there to help you
I know (that) together we're invincible
Invincibleâ¦ I knowâ¦ we're invincible

All I want you to come close to me
Oh no, we won't be alone anymore
If you fall I will be there to help you
I know (that) together we're invincible
