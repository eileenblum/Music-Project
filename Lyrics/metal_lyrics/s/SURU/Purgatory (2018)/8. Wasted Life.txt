I wish I could dream without fear and
Not to live against those rules anymore
My deepest passions are dying every day more and more dammed to extinct
Times goes by and I'm the same
Growing fast but nothing changes
Chronos paints my dark hair white
Young inside, outside full of scars

Craving for a sign to find the better path, to save my mind
But reality reveals a wasted life

Tomorrow brings me sadness,
Today is still unknown
I want to forget the past 'cause I was so alone

There's a wall in front of my fate
Future says you'll not be there
Desperation runs into my blood
I want survive just before I die

Craving for a sign to find the better path, to save my mind
But reality reveals a wasted life

I'm trying to be myself, (and I know) you won't win my war, I'm the only one
(But) I'll take my boots away, (I give up) the world is too much for me and I have nothing
