Descend into hell, grotesque what I am
Take a look inside chaos reigns in my mind
Impossible to find, no, the logic of life
Ascend to sanity escape from madness

I've crossed the line, void is the end of the road, one step and fall again but I love to walk
It seems I need, to feel bad, when things go well, addicted to pain, addicted to pain

My brain works like the ghost, of an architect, who always destroys and builds without, distinguishing good from bad

Descend into hell, grotesque what I am
Take a look inside chaos reigns in my mind
Impossible to find, no, the logic of life
Ascend to sanity escape from madness

It seems I need, to feel bad, when things go well, addicted to pain, addicted to pain
