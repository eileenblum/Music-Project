I used to be a good man, doing my best for them
Now I see it doesn't worth, and I'm evil
I bring the plague, my word will rot your souls
You'll hear my name, they usually know me as Death
Are you prepared? It's time to pay for your faults
Don't be scared if you're pure

Fear me, sinners. 'Cause I am the apocalypse
I am pain, there's no cure for me
I am hate, feel the darkness within

Here comes the purge, I'll take the blackened hearts
No more to say, my fate's to punish
With no regrets, the end is the best choice
I'm nemesis, born to judge

Fear me, sinners. 'Cause I am the apocalypse
I am pain, there's no cure for me
I am hate, feel the darkness within
