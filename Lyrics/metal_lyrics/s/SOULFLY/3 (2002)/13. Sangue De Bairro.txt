[These are the names of the members of Lampiao's gang!]
[They were outlaw rebels that would steal from the rich and give to the poor]
[(like a Brasilian Robin Hood).]
[When they were captured,]
[their heads were decapitated and displayed in the square of the city of Recife, Pernambuco.]

Quando degolaram minha cabeÃ§a
Passei mais de dois segundos
Vendo meu corpo tremendo
E nÃ£o sabia o que fazer
Morrer, viver, morrer, viver

[Translation:]
When they cut off my head
For more than two seconds
I watch my body shake
And I didn't know what to do
To die, to live, to die, to live
