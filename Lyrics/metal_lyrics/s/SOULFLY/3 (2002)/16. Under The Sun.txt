[Originally covered by Black Sabbath]

Well I don't want no Jesus freak to tell me what it's all about
No black magician telling me to cut my soul out
Don't believe in violence, I don't even believe in your peace
I've opened the door now; my mind has been released

Well I don't want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No I don't want no one to tell me where I'm gonna go when I die
I wanna live my life; I don't want people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself, 'cause no one else is true

Every day just comes and goes
Life is one big overdose
People try to ruinte
I can see through their frustration

People hiding their real face
Keep on running their rat race
The ante is risen once a week
In their world of make-believe

So believe what I tell you, it's the only way to fight in the end
Just believe in yourself, you know you really shouldn't have to pretend
Don't let those empty people try and interfere with your mind
Just live your life and leave them all behind
