Namaste

Come around, come around
Predatory jungle law
Come around, come around
Predatory jungle law

One
One soul
One heart
One man
ONe truth
One tribe
One life
One god

Come around, come around
Predatory jungle law
Come around, come around
Predatory jungle law

Embrace one feeling left inside
The more we breathe
The more it takes my breath away
Everything you do
Everything in you
Everything you do and say
Doesn't wash it all away

Come around, come around
Predatory jungle law
Come around, come around
Prdatory jungle law

One
One fate
One rise
One sky
One breed
One pain
One Light
One fire

Come around, come around
Predatory jungle law
Come around, come around
Prdatory jungle law

Embrace one feeling left inside
The more we breathe
The more it takes my breath away
Everything you do
Everything in you
Everything you do and say
Doesn't wash it all away

Come around, come around
Predatory jungle law
Come around, come around
Prdatory jungle law

Namaste
