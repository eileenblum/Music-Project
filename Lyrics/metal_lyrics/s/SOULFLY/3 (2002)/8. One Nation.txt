[Originally performed by Sacred Reich]

A vision of unselfishness, a union of black and white
One nation of all races, it's clear within my sight
I see it clear, no hate, no fear, no soldiers sent to die
A state that's free and thrives on peace, no greed, no threat to life

We won't build the weapons of war which looms over your heads We'll not feed the war machines that lead our youth to death
We won't close our eyes to the atrocities which abound

We won't stand and watch until we're six feet underground

The future is our burden, we can't stand and watch
As the world around crumbles, opposing armies march
We work towards our goal: one nation - unity
And you must be the convert who works towards world peace

Muthafuckers around us who stand and say no way
Opposing lessened armies, they say are here to stay
But no one knows until we try, what we all can do
I won't watch children die, it's up to me and you

Our world is divided, the boundaries have been drawn
Ideas are decided by where you have been born
You can't judge people by the government of their land
They're flesh and blood like us - why don't you understand?

The future is our burden, we can't stand and watch
As the world around crumbles, opposing armies march
We work towards our goal: one nation - unity
And you must be the convert who works towards world peace
