No follow no trends
We know you are too fake
The song remains insane
And we are here to stay
Against all odds we go
Follow out hearts and sould
We'll take you to the unknown
Our message to the world...

Last of the Mohicans

Out tribe spreads everywhere
"Sell-Out" I say fuck that
You better show respect
'Cause we're not like the rest
The rhythm and the rage
The blood spills on the stage
Oh god give me the strength
And guide us till the end...

Last of the Mohicans
