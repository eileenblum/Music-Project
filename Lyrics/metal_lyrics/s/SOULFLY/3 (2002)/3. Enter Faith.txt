Now...
Frustration turning, turning around
Stomping the feet, moving the ground
All the barriers unbound
Unexplained, it can't be found

Now...
Motivation comes from beyond
Purity like the unborn
Riding the storms
The storms

Enterfaith
Deeper and deeper in every way
Enterfaith
Penetrates the wound again
Enterfaith
Deep and deeper everyday
Enterfaith
Penetrates the wound again

Now...
It's not what you see, it's what you feel
You can not explain, but it's so real
This is our fate, no one can kill
From birth, this has been sealed

Now...
Forever and ever without an end
Follow your heart, never pretend
The last will be first, it has been said
So I say

Enterfaith
Deeper and deeper in every way
Enterfaith
Penetrates the wound again
Enterfaith
Deep and deeper everyday
Enterfaith
Penetrates the wound again

Faith...On and on
Faith...To carry on
Faith...No transgression
Faith...Is a weapon

Faith is a weapon
