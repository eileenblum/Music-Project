Fighting for your soul
Defending what is yours
Arm in arms, I and I and All
Fire is within
Bleed for your belief
Come on and bleed with me

Chuan-Tzu" Rules of war
A warrior is reborn
3,000 years before
Not, we won't give up
Not, we won't back up
And we'll never let go

Destroy'em down
Destroy'em all

Fighting for your soul
Defending what is yours
Arm in arms, I and I and all
Fire is within
Bleed for your belief
Come on and bleed with me

Destroy'em down
Destroy'em all

Downstroy
