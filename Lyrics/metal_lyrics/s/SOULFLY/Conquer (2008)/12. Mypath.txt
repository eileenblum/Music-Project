[Bonus Track]MY PATH, NOT YOURS
I FOLLOW NO ONE
MY LIFE, NOT YOURS
I'LL LIVE, ON AND ON
MY FIGHT, NOT YOURS
AND I'LL FIGHT THEM ALL
MY PATH, NOT YOURS
AND I'LL FOLLOW WY SOUL

MY WAR, NOT YOURS
AND I'LL FOLLOW THE STORM
MY SOUL, NOT YOURS
AND YOU WILL BE GONE
MY ROOTS, NOT YOURS
AND I'LL FOLLOW MY SOUL
MY PATH, NOT YOURS
SO FUCK YOU ALL

MY PATH - NO REGRETS, NO REMORSE, FUCK THE REST
MY WAR - NO SURVIVORS, NO ESCAPE, NO RETURN
MY FIGHT - NEVER ENDS, NEVER FADES, NEVER DIES
MY PATH - NO REGRETS, NO REMORSE, MY PATH...

MY RULES, NOT YOURS
AND I WILL GO ON
MY BLOOD, NOT YOURS
AND I'M BLEEDING THROUGH
MY WORLD, NOT YOURS
JUST LIKE IT WAS BEFORE
MY PATH, NOT YOURS
AND I WILL FOLLOW MY SOUL

MY PATH, MY WAY
AND I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY
MY OWN INNER SELF
FOREVER I REBEL
MY PATH, MY FIRE
THE FLAMES ARE GETTING HIGHER
MY PATH, NOT YOURS
AND I'LL FOLLOW MY SOUL

MY PATH - NO REGRETS, NO REMORSE, FUCK THE REST
MY WAR - NO SURVIVORS, NO ESCAPE, NO RETURN
MY FIGHT - NEVER ENDS, NEVER FADES, NEVER DIES
MY PATH - NO REGRETS, NO REMORSE, MY PATH...
