You are the enemy
You are the enemy ghost
Unleash within
I turn you soul to dust
You are the enemy
You are the enemy ghost
The Oath is broken
I'll take and crush your world

You are the enemy
You are the enemy ghost
Declare war
I turn your soul to stone
You are the enemy
You are the enemy ghost
The fear killer
I fucking stand alone

I'm calling all the spirits, In this ritual killing
I'm calling all the spirits, Rise above and rise within
I'm calling all the spirits, In darkness we scream
I'm calling all the spirits, Rise above and rise within

I'm calling all the spirits, Killing instincts
I'm calling all the spirits, Rise above and rise within
I'm calling all the spirits, Sacrifice all things
I'm calling all the spirits, Rise above and rise within

You are the enemy
You are the enemy ghost
In Desolation
But were never alone
You are the enemy
You are the enemy ghost
The world is exploding
Their souls are burning...
