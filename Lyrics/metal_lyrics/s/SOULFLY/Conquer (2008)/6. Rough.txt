Doomsday calling
Karmas burning
Seeing black
Chaos forming
Vulture culture
Total rapture
Killing kingdom
Now has come

Make it rough, fucking rough
It's how you land
Not how you fall... [2x]

Incendiary...
Mercenary...
Seeing red, you turn to ashes
Eclipse comes, blot out the sun
You crash and burn
You trash and burn

Make it rough, fucking rough
It's how you land
Not how you fall... [2x]

Hostility...
Brutality...
I'll blind the world - reality

Against the world we're coming rough
The king of kings designed me though

The riots, the bombs
The city is a tomb
corrosion, corruption
Unleash destruction
Critical time, critical mass
Make it rough, killing fast
Make it rough, fucking rough
It's how you land
Not how you fall... [4x]
