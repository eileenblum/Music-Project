Up from the ashes of despair and loss
Years of enslavement now come with a higher cost
Bureaucracy, you chose to rule with fear
Now feel the wrath that comes from all those years

You choose to shut your eyes, now repent

Rise of the fallen, suffer the hand you dealt yourself
Rise of the fallen, the fallacy of fractured wealth
Rise of the fallen, ignore the parts of your machine
Rise of the fallen, drink from the fountain of your poisoned dream

Destroy the world and all the wars we're on
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust will come
I, the destroyer of both worlds
Born from the womb of insult I come

You choose to shut your eyes, now repent
You choose to shut your eyes, now repent

Rise of the fallen, suffer the hand you dealt yourself
Rise of the fallen, the fallacy of fractured wealth
Rise of the fallen, ignore the parts of your machine
Rise of the fallen, drink from the fountain of your poisoned dream

Drink from the fountain of your poisoned dream
Bled from your machine
Choke on the spirits that you tried to eat
Now on you they feed

You build the part, now you play it
We become the master, drown in all the laughter
Law from below, now you obey it
Death comes never faster, this is the disaster
