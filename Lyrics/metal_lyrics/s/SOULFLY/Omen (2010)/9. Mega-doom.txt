When the great number seven completes itself
Games begin at the tomb side
Not far from the turn of the millennium
The dead will rise out of their graves

Visions of things to come, visions of things undone
Visions, immortality, visions, reality
Visions of prophecy, visions of lunacy
Visions beyond the grave, visions behold the name

Near the gates and inside two cities
Two hitherto unimaginable scourges will occur
Hunger and plague within
Outside people are put out to the sword
They will call for help from immortal God

Visions in red, visions of nightmare
Visions of your soul, visions of your world
Visions, the sky, visions, the night
Visions of screams, visions of dreams

When the great number seven completes itself
Games begin at the tomb side
Not far from the turn of the millennium
