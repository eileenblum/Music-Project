Fall into ashes, hole of the imperium
Rise of the fallen, come to the omen
Lords of chaos awaits, signs of the times
Cold and dark approaches, brutal depression arrives
Arise

Great depression in a fraction
The empire is gone
Great depression in a fraction
The empire is gone

Forward and don't look back, never stop and rest
Forever your spirit should go away, away from it all
Sky, blood red, rise beneath the sky
Fly to nowhere fast, survive the massive test
Survive

Great depression in a fraction
The empire is gone
Great depression in a fraction
The empire is gone, gone

Skulls and crossbones lay dark fear and decay
Slow finding its way, crawl out of this plague
Numb, you don't feel it all, womb maggots will crawl
Frozen and paralyzed to life, crumble, the empires die
Die

Great depression in a fraction
The empire is gone
Great depression in a fraction
The empire is gone, is gone

Fall into ashes, hole of the imperium
Rise of the fallen, come to the omen
Lords of chaos awaits, signs of the times
