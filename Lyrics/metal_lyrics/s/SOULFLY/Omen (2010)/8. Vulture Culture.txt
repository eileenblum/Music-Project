Vulture culture is here to stay
No tomorrow, no today
In no man's land they lay to waste
Vulture culture is here to stay

Vulture culture is here to stay
Paradise lost beyond the grave
Search your soul in dark land
Vulture culture is here to stay

Vulture culture
Vulture culture

Vulture culture is here to stay
In the walls and in your brain
Final conflict at the gates
Vulture culture is here to stay

Chaos mongers are on their way
Change the future in decay
Lose your soul in anyway
Vulture culture is here to stay

Vulture culture
Vulture culture

Bleed the skies above
Blood red clouds will form
Bleed the skies above
Vulture culture comes

Vulture culture is here to stay
Your soul is dark, your soul in pain
Allied forces come to play
Vulture culture is here to stay

Propaganda lost in vain
Nothing to conquer, nothing to gain
Reality you must erase
Vulture culture is here to stay

Vulture culture
Vulture culture

Vulture culture is here to stay
The killing kingdom in display
Dog eat dog, man hates man
Vulture culture is here to stay

Piece by piece they go insane
Where the poison hits the brain
No one hears a word you say
Vulture culture is here to stay

Vulture culture
Vulture culture

Bleed the skies above
Blood red clouds will form
Bleed the skies above
Vulture culture comes

Vulture culture is here to stay
No tomorrow, no today
In no man's land they lay to waste
