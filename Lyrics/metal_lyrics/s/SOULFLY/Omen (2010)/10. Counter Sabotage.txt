Counter sabotage will bring them to demise
Counter sabotage will bring them to demise
Counter sabotage will bring them to demise
Counter sabotage will bring them to demise

Truth hits one and all
Soul keep from falling
Control your thoughts and mind
Corrode your thoughts and mind

Feel nothing at all, scream but no one hears
Fall and can't get up, visions of things to come

Cannot speak, cannot speak never
Cannot speak, cannot speak never

Rule, rule your world, fate cannot be touched
Slow, the worms will crawl, crawl from inside out
Deep, deep inside you feel, escape to nowhere fast
Destroy all your demons, lay and laid to waste

Cannot speak, cannot speak never
Cannot speak, cannot speak never

Counter sabotage will bring them to demise
Counter sabotage will bring them to demise

Lost, cannot be found, worms are coming out
Blind, you cannot see, face your reality
Strength, beyond strength, scars are deep inside
Lies you cannot hide, alive, alive you rise

Cannot speak, cannot speak never
Cannot speak, cannot speak never

Control your destiny, slaughter your enemies
Sabotage, one and all, watch, watch them fall
Die, forget your lies, sky will fall tonight
Obey 'til the end, end is now in hand

Cannot speak, cannot speak never
Cannot speak, cannot speak never

Counter sabotage will bring them to demise
Counter sabotage will bring them to demise
Counter sabotage will bring them to demise
Counter sabotage will bring them to demise

Counter sabotage will bring them to demise
Counter sabotage will bring them to demise
Counter sabotage will bring them to demise
