The river runs red
The sky falls in your head
The river runs red
Another death ahead

Bloodbath and beyond
Bloodbath and beyond

The river runs red
The fall of the west
The river runs red
I'll give you my hate instead

Bloodbath and beyond
Bloodbath and beyond

The river runs red
Welcome to the end
The river runs red
Bloodbath is everywhere

Bloodbath and beyond
Bloodbath and beyond

The river runs red
In the kingdom of the dread
The river runs red
The hate of the land

Bloodbath and beyond
Bloodbath and beyond
