Die, your fate is sealed by lethal injection
Tried by a jury of false perception
Lied to, they bribe you
Submit to the wrong correction
Your final dose is a lethal injection

Your time has come, it's time to die
Your soul is heavy, your heart is dry
Inner fear takes control
Say goodbye to this world

Die, your fate is sealed by lethal injection
Tried by a jury of false perception
Lied to, they bribe you
Submit to the wrong correction
Your final dose is a lethal injection

Judgment falls from the sky
Lethal injection, you die tonight
The bleeding starts, your life passes by
Darkness falls, the end of life

Die, your fate is sealed by lethal injection
Tried by a jury of false perception
Lied to, they bribe you
Submit to the wrong correction
Your final dose is a lethal injection

Die, your fate is sealed by lethal injection
Tried by a jury of false perception
Lied to, they bribe you
