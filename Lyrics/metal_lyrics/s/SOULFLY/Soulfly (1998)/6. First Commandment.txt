Murderer - covered in sangre
Murderer - blood on your shoulders

Karma - how does it feel?
Karma - to take a life
Wailin'- wailin' in vein
Wailin' - you'll reap what you sow!!

Thou shalt not kill
Thou shalt not kill
Thou shalt not kill
Thou shalt not kill

Lie to yourself - lie to your friends
Now lay and wait you fucking
Rapist - you'll have no redemption
Burn - Burn - Burn muthafuckas

"I might just come after you
I just might come after... but you'll never know...
Broke the first commandment"

Thou shalt not kill
Thou shalt not kill
Thou shalt not kill
Thou... face your judgement
