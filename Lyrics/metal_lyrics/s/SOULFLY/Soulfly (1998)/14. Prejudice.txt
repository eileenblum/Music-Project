Shame of all nations

What seeds do we plant in an infant's mind?
Seeds of destruction
And don't you trust their kind?
This hate is deep-rooted, get rid of the weed
Destroying the harvest
Of peace that we need

Prejudice
Shame of all nations

We got to live in the same neighborhood
When you take a man's life it don't mean that you're good
Same blood runs through your veins
Your hate proves you're insane
See a man's face but you can't see his heart
Don't even know him but you tear him apart
Them kind of things, they're just killing off the Earth
Madness, mayhem, we must desert...

Prejudice
Shame of all nations
Breeding hate, don't need no segregation

If dirty people are all I can see
Then in their eyes the same dirt covers me
Take off the blindfold, it's time to enlighten
Come out of the wickedness, step out of the night
One man's agony is another man's joy
For self satisfaction we're prepared to destroy
One man, one earth and one destiny
To kill Satan and give God the glory...

Prejudice
Shame of a nation
Breeding hate, dont cause annihilation

For real...
