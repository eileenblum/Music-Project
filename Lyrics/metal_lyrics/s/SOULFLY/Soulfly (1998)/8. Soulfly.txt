"We sat outside the studio at night, among a few candles, and
closed our eyes for a minute. After that, we jammed straight
from our hearts. We didn't play for ourselves, but for the ones
no longer with us in flesh, but always with us in spirit. God bless.
Until we meet again. Soul fly... fly free!" - Max C.
