Can you hear the sound of an enormous door slamming in the depths of Hell?
The possibility of Life's destruction
Can you hear the cries of pain, the mournful sound?
The possibility of life's destruction

Can you hear the sound of an enormous door slamming in the depths of Hell?
The possibility of Life's destruction
