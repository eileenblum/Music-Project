I am what I create
Believing in my fate
Integrity is my name
All that I am doing
Can never be ruined
My song remains insane

Eye For An Eye

Got to watch my back
Got let my heart
Belive one day I'll fly...
To reunite the tribe
To find a better way
Fucking envy changes everything

I hit the bottom
You don't understand
Pain...hate...pain
To be born again
Arise again
I believe is the only way...
