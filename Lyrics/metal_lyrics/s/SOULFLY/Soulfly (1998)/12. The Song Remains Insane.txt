[CHAOS]
This world is a chaos, this life is a chaos CHAOS!!!!!!!

[ATTITUDE]
Live your life
Not the way they taught you
Do what you feel
Survive the jungle
Give me blood
Give me Pain
These scars won't heal

Can you take it
Can you take it
Can you take it
Motherfucker

What were you thinking
What a wonderful world
You're full of shit
Leave it behind
They don't care if you cry
All is left is pain

I won't take it
I won't take it
I won't take it
No

[THE SONG REMAINS INSANE]
The song remains insane
I remain insane
