We're cannibals all around the fire
The heart of jungle is my power
Born of darkness and slaughter
We're fucking savages chanting war!

Kill, cut, scalp - all your bodies
Kill, cut, scalp - all your souls
Kill, cut, scalp - all your heads
Kill, cut, scalp - all of you...

Hunting down they come for you
Sacrifice enters your doom
Bleed for your sins and bleed for me
Civilization under siege

Kill, cut, scalp - all your bodies
Kill, cut, scalp - all your souls
Kill, cut, scalp - all your heads
Kill, cut, scalp - all of you...

Consuming human to stay human
Force-fed children of scum
Consuming flesh to grow flesh
Radiation up in ashes!
