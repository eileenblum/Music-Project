[Limited Edition Bonus Track]Brainwashed zombies
Hypnotized by TV
Shubhuman animosity
Shroud of insecurity
Downtrodden exploitation
Striving for perfection
Fear of rejection
Powers of deception

Fuck, fuck reality
I say fuck, fuck reality
I say fuck, fuck reality
I say fuck, fuck reality
I say...

Infest your weak minds
Subconcious landmines
Reverse into decline
Dysfunctional life
I am the epitome
Burden breaking the mold
Holy, the war
The living suffer

Fuck, fuck reality
I say fuck, fuck reality
I say fuck, fuck reality
I say fuck, fuck reality
I say...

Infestation, confrontation, provocation - planet dies
Incineration, pacification, regression - mankind dies
Deception, regression, extinction - all of life
Subservience, dominance, negligence - man must die

Brutalized, sacrified, sanctified - you will die
Holy war, execution, gas chamber - firing squad

Slaves to be sold
Shackled to the bone
Broadcast noise pollution
Televised execution

Fuck, fuck reality
I say fuck, fuck reality
I say fuck, fuck reality
I say fuck, fuck reality
I say...

Invented, never repented
For the sins that killed my skin
