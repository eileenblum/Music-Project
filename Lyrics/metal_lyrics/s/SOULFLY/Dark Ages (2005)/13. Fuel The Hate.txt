Fuel this hate
And you'll never be the same again
Now I'm feeling again and again
Fuel this hate
And you're living on the edge again
Just like we felt back then
Fuel this hate
And you'll never be the same again
When you just don't give a damn
Fuel this hate
And you're living on the edge again
I don't give a damn...

Fuel this hate
And you're living on the edge again
Just like we felt back then

And you'll never be the same again
When you just don't give a damn
Fuel this hate
And I'm living on the edge again
I don't give a damn

Sometimes - suicide - genocide - suicide
I don't give a fuck if I live or die
Sometimes - suicide - genocide - suicide
I don't give a fuck if you live or die
Sometimes - crucified - terrorize - crucified
I don't care about this fucked up life
Sometimes - crucified - terrorize - crucified
I don't care about your fucked up life
Sometimes - suicide - genocide - suicide
I don't give a fuck if I live or die
Sometimes - suicide - genocide - suicide
I don't give a fuck if you live or die
Sometimes - agonize - open arms - agonize
Let the world burn tonight
Sometimes - agonize - sacrifice - agonzie
If it's up to me - sacrifice

Fuel this hate
And you'll never be the same again
Just like we felt back then
Fuel this hate
And you're living on the edge again
Happiness, I don't understand
Fuel this hate
And you'll never be the same again
There is no other way
Fuel this hate
And I'm living on the edge again
Let them feel the pain

Um, Dois, Tres, Quatro...
Past the point of no return..
Past the point of no return...

Sangue morto, amaldiscoado

Sangue morto, amaldiscoado..."
