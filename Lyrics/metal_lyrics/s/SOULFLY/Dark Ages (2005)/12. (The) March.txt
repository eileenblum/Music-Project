Dark ages upon us
Hate surround us
Fear embrace us
Tragedy behind us
Media brainwash us
Spirits guide us
Weakness expose us
Memories behind us

Journey in front of us
Roots under us
Strange attracts us
Inner voice calls us
Envy destroy us
Music lift us
Scars remind us
Spark ignite us

Everything will pass on
We must go on
Everything will pass on
We must go on
It's up to us...
It's up to us...
It's up to us...
