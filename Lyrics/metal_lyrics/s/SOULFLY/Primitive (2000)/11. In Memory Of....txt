[w/ Cut-Troat Logic]

Yo, life's web wants me in debt and tries to collect my breath as ransom in return for my soul's silhouette.
How deep does shit get? Is it worth the Bentleys and jets in this jungle of sheer cons and devils with
breasts. I mean does everything happen for a reason, the change of seasons, even the slugs screamin' to
stop you from breathin'. It seems we're all a target in this mosh pit. The world be spinnin' lopsided, that's
why I have my logic. 

We are what we are - musical contrast/sound clash/bomb blast 
We are what we are - musical contrast/sound clash/bomb blast 
So don't tell me how to act - how to be - how to live 
We are what we are - forever live or die 
Don't tell me how to act - how to be - how to live 
I am what I am from beginning to the end 

My conspiracy theory threatens national security, speaking clearly, you assholes don't hear me. Walked the
psychopath of Timothy Leary when cell therapy wasn't curing me, God put fear in me, scaring me. RIP
Kamau Jahi, quiet warrior with dignity, still with me spiritually, forever in memory. Cut throat - who ill as me?
Soulfly. Flight attendants ain't got shit on me. You reap what you sow, so I try my hardest to harvest good
crops regardless if most artists are garbage - with godless content. To be honest, the chronic plus my
fondness of alcoholic products held my spirit in bondage like convicts. Gettin' blunted wasn't pungent,
overabundance of dumb shit had me living low-budget. Conflict. Indo had my mental growth stunted, cut
friends out my circumference I used to run with. Rose above it. Fuck thuggin' and clubbin', I got one in the
oven, plus my girl's talkin' husband - she buggin'. My method of flowin' expression through poem, salt of the
Earth like the ocean - God's chosen spokesman. Creation to cremation, to be blatant - fuck Satan - paper
chasin' motherfuckers facing damnation. Girls actin' fly with no interest in aviation - fuck station - radio
waves is just radiation.

We are what we are - musical contrast/sound clash/bomb blast 
You don't feel when I bleed, when I scream, when I feel 
We are what we are - forever live or die 
You don't know how I feel, what is real, what's the deal 
I am what I am from beginning to the end 

Cutthroat Logic - the newest extension of the Soulfly Tribe from now until the day that I die. Can't you tell by
the pain in my eyes that with this music I will bring my dream to life. Stressed the F out, losin' my mind, I
wanna blow up right now but I know it takes time. Like slanging saxs to takin' elbows across the state lines,
from 22's to tec 9's swag to kind. Underground to worldwide, I will never die, forever my words in my
rhymes they gonna keep me alive. So onward I strive each and every day of my life az I fight to keep
K-RAB's dream alive. Forever my better half from fightin' to makin' cash. Some things in life are fucked up -
wish I could take 'em back. But I live life with no regrets so I just look back on life and laugh.

In memory of D-LOW I carry this pain 
We are what we are - I know you understand 
In memory of D-LOW I carved your name 
I am what I am from beginning to the end 

Got Catholics in confession and 5-percenters studying lessons while the youth smoke Buddha for blessing.
I hear you fuckers on vinyl praising false idols - claiming Gods and dogs and other fraud titles - to rival. My
recital's laced with the Bible, life is just a time trial - I'm trying to make the finals. March madness in the land
of savages - I'm stranded, a magnet for static so I combat it diplomatic - nomadic - what I'm tatted - my
cross my only baggage - roots go back to Africa, I'm not Asiatic. Brothas mastered mathematics and still
they can't add it. My quest isn't cabbage although it's nice to have it - rock the planet - like volcanic magma
fragments - as my lava cools a lot of fools take me for granite. I just wanna meet the trinity and live for
infinity - laugh at the enemy - when I get there who cares who remember me - on Earth. Since birth my
dome had afro turf - ask the nurse - I heard a verse that said - "who's last is first" - so I keep my flesh
humble 'cause I'm still-skinned like Rumple - average a triple double and keep my game subtle - jam
harder - than Vince on all ballers from bench to starter since I slaughter holler - murda - on Shawn Carter -
no honor with robbers - so I pray to my godfather and my conscience isn't bothered by how I get my dollars.
