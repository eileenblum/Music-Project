From your mouth shit comes out
I know what you're all about
Spreading lies and misery
Why don't you face reality

Deceiver - Spawn the bastard
Deceiver - Your grotesque existence
Deceiver - I vomit on you
Deceiver - I curse your soul

With this dagger, I kill the leper
Accuser of all, I the rapture
Come back from the dead to fuck with me again
Sucking my bloody veins, your shame has no end

Deceiver - Your filthy corruption
Deceiver - Your mental abortion
Deceiver - Your terminal cancer
Deceiver - A slave to your master
