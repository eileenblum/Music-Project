[Digital Edition Bonus Track]Master 
Master
And who made him my masterâ¦
Involuntary
Servitude
Punishment comes for youâ¦

From the cradle to the grave
Slave- slave
Remove the chains - emancipate
Slave- slave

Injustice
Oppression
For whom there is no protection
Retribution
Insurrection
The middle passage in action

From the cradle to the grave
Slave- slave
Remove the chains - emancipate
Slave- slave

I will
Arise
And Slay my enemies tonight
Whippings
Mutilations
And limb amputations

Grind, captive, confinedâ¦

Deep within
Has Been
The anguish of my soul
Face down
To the Earth
Through the skin you'll see my bones

Grind, captive, confinedâ¦

Zumbi E O senhor das querras
Zumbi E O senhor das demandas
Quando zumbi chega
E zumbi E quem mandaâ¦
