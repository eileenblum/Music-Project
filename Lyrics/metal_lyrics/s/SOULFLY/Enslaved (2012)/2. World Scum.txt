Bloody century is upon thee
Revolution, war and disease
Earthquake, the cities falling
Catastrophe will kill the east
There will be fire
There will be famine, drought and plague
We will succumb in the arena
Thumbs down to seal our fate

World scum
Bloody century eclipses the sun
Blood scum
The generation of sin returns

World scum, world scum
Bloody century eclipses the sun
Blood scum, blood scum
The generation of sin returns

Down at the gates, the gates of hell, open and fell
Jfk shot in the head - conspiracy
Auschwitz - they breathe zyklon b
Gas chamber they all marched in...
Many shall come, many shall go, many shall learn
Many shall live, many shall die, many shall burn
One thing is certain, we all share the guilt
We'll die alone in the house religion built

World scum
Bloody century eclipses the sun
Blood scum
The generation of sin returns

World scum, world scum
Bloody century eclipses the sun
Blood scum, blood scum
The generation of sin returns

Procreation of the wicked
Mass slaughter of the weak
Mustafa and his children
Knife down and kill the living

Eternal devastation
Eternal devastation

The brutal human instinct
The spirit of inhumanity
Scum of a species failing
Holy war - death knell tolling

Eternal devastation
Eternal devastation

Assassination of the czar
No more kings - no more czars
Damnation on the rise
Baptized by fire

A warning i see in these eyes
You cannot put a price on life
Holy purge will crack the sky
Terror screaming in the dark

H-bomb - dropped out on the front
Hiroshima - nagasaki - brutality
Armageddon draws a meggido
The final war - the antichrist and jesus
Arise descendents of babylon
Judgement day has come and gone
Words of hate, words of filth and on and on
Influence for generations beyond...

The final war - the antichrist and jesus
The final war - the antichrist and jesus
The final war - the antichrist and jesus
