We're legions connected
By the blood that we share
We charge it, we march it
In this land of despair
Our banner in blood
We carry to war
With shields and spears
The killing fear

Legions - God of war
Legions - Calling you
Legions - Hades fall
Legions - March of doom

Confront them, destroy âem
Smash them all
Their putrid carcass
Laying on the ground
Spartan warriors
Bravest of all
Their bodies piled up
Form a human wall

Legions - God of war
Legions - Calling you
Legions - Hades fall
Legions - March of doom

Bloody purge - Total scourge
The gates of doom will open soon
To Hades - you're coming
The gods of war are calling you...

Legions - God of war
Legions - Calling you
Legions - Hades fall
Legions - March of doom
