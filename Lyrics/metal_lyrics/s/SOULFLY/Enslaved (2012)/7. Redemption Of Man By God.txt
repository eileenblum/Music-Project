Shed... Kill... Shed their blood
Eradicate... Mass murder

The mark of the blood
Spare the first born
Penalty of death will pass over
The dark angel to kill the unborn
Unless you have the blood on your door

Telling truths - Unspoken
Telling lies - Unbroken

Venom of the snake
Bite becomes warm
You feel it hit without warning
Coil the serpent, take up arms
It's all the same in the hands of God

Testify - Unspoken
Ruined lives - Unbroken

Redemption of man by God
Blood redemption, blood redemption
Redemption of man by God
Blood redemption, blood redemption

Shed... Kill... Shed their blood
Eradicate... Mass murder

Snakes of Christ
Who come out tonight
Prepare yourself for sacrifice
Snakes of Christ
Who come out tonight
Prepare yourself to arise...

Redemption of man by God
Blood redemption, blood redemption
Redemption of man by God
Blood redemption, blood redemption

Shed... Kill... Shed their blood
Eradicate... Mass murder

"The killing of the lamb
And the Sprinkling of the blood
Of the lamb on the lintels
And on the door post of the
People on the night when the
Death angel passed that wherever
He saw the blood on the door post
And on the lintils that he would
Pass over that house and the first
Born of that family would not be killed.
When the shed blood was significantly
Applied and they were free
From the penalty of death.
When I see the blood, I will pass over you."

The redemption of man by God
