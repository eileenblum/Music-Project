And now you're walking, walking alone
With all this blood on your soul
All this injustice was fucking done
Amnesia, that is so fucked up...

Your hands are red
Your face is so green
This nosebleed don't taste so good
Feel me when I plead
How can you sleep
Living with this leech
Bloodstained and broken
Now you're at my feet

All your guilt won't wash away
Till you die it's here to stay
It's too late to change your fate
There's no god working for you

Time has come now pay for your crime
Time has come now pay for your crime
Blood - Blood - Blood - Revengeance
Blood - Blood - Blood - Blood on the soul

What I would do to see you
Face to face, there's no way I can say
I won't just kill you myself
You must pay but I know...

All your guilt won't wash away
Till you die is here to stay
It's too late to change your fate
There's no god working for you...

Time has come now pay for your crime
Time has come now pay for your crime
Blood - Blood - Blood - Revengeance
Blood - Blood - Blood - Blood on your soul

(Dana, justice will be served)

Revenge, I'll take it to my grave
D-Low in me forever lives
They can take your memory away
But they can't take what you create...

Blood - Revengeance - Blood - Blood - Revengeance
Blood - Blood - Blood - Revengeance
Blood - Blood - Blood - Revengeance
Blood
