[Digital Edition Bonus Track]Judasâ¦ Liar... Judasâ¦ Liar...
Judasâ¦ Liar... Judasâ¦ Liar...

You keep saying lies, pretending that you're right
I see through you disguise, I'll see to your demise
You can fool some people, some timeâ¦
But you cannot fool all the people, all the timeâ¦

Why don't you stop your bullshit, stop fucking around
You're just betraying yourself and looking like a clown
You hurt so many people I can't keep the count
Why don't you face  yourself and turn your life aroundâ¦

No more lies, no more lies
I cannot take your lies
Kill the lies, kill the lies
Now it's eye for an eyeâ¦

Bastard
Traitor
Loser
Bastard

Scumbag, scumbag
A life you never had
Judas, judas
To me it's like you're dead

Bastard
Traitor
Loser
Bastard

Bastard!!!
