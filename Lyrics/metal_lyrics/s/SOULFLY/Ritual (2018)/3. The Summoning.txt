I walk the path of divination,
escape the shackles of subjugation.
Labor and beauty was divine,
a barren land I leave behind.

Broken bones,
bloodlust, war drums,
and swollen lungs.

Will you take my soul,
will you take my world?
I fear no one!

The strength I summon...

Extermination came of age,
our innocence tortured and chained.
Exploited by your own reflections,
your golden kingdoms, rotting infections.

Smoking stone,
breach of trust,
dethrone, I bleed alone.

Will you make me whole,
will you make me holy?
Into the storm I run!

The strength I summon...

The sickness, the rapture, the furious
rape, tyrants I fear, tyrants I hear.
The cosmic sun blind us and guide us,
you envy the dead, the future unclear.

With loaded hands...
âExecution!â

Will you take my soul,
will you take my world?
I fear no one!

The strength I summon...
