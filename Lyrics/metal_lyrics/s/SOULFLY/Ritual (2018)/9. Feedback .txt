Vanishing point of the black top,
shithole venue smells like rot.
A thousand nights I left behind,
another tribe, another time.

Feedback, feedback!
Um, dois, trÃªs, quatro,
not a fucking regret!

A brotherhood at stage right,
a circle pit night after night.
A congregation packed full of sinners,
another road, another winter.

Feedback, feedback!
Um, dois, trÃªs, quatro,
not a fucking regret!

Broken bottles thrown in a fight,
cannot move, sold out tonight.
Stage dive, no fucking glamour,
tonight's show, it's all that matters.

Feedback, feedback!
Not a fucking regret,
not a fucking regret!

Many were cursed and many alive,
carry a torch for those who have died.
Carve your skin, a mosaic forever,
never say die, never say never.

Never say never!
No regret...
