"From the throne came flashes of lightning,
rumblings, and peals of thunder.
Before the throne seven lamps were blazing,
these are the seven spirits of God."

Fire born
from the emptiness,
lost souls,
faith relinquished.

Red skies, red skies!
Thunderous, thunderous,
thunderous, thunderous.

Demonized!

These omens, Jupiter's gaze,
visions of raising Caine.
Prayers torn asunder, these
hollow grounds breed murder.

Drowned God, drowned God!
Thunderous, thunderous,
thunderous, thunderous.

Demonized!

Are you judging my morals
and my lack of faith?
Intolerance of nothing
that is sacrosanct.

Disgracing the arrogant,
I'll craft my throne from pestilence.
Malevolent, you're nothing,
you're all dead to me, dead!
