Sky burns, no return, you
sweat the hate from your flesh.
Rejoice through the void,
consumed by loss of breath.

Human greed is our destruction,
the abyss of your seduction
Demure, suffer, the grief
a burden to bear.

No pain, walk on fire,
holy mystic aura!

Cenobites I know your kind,
dead behind the eyes.
Self-inflicted cenobites,
dead behind the eyes.

Endless, deathless,
a cryptic inner fear.
Whatâs left, the wretched,
and those who speak in your ear.

Eviscerate your own impressions,
die along with your transgressions.
Menace, penance, horrific
path to ascension.

No pain, walk on fire,
holy mystic aura!

Cenobites I know your kind,
dead behind the eyes.
Self-inflicted cenobites,
dead behind the eyes.

All the flesh eaters, skin crawlers,
they tear you limb from limb.
Blood feeders, Hellraisers,
these vermin feed my rage.

Dead behind the eyes!

Do you purge fire, shed light,
or let them come tonight?
Nephilim, Seraphim,
the lost paradise.

Cenobites I know your kind!
You're all dead, so fucking
dead behind the eyes.
