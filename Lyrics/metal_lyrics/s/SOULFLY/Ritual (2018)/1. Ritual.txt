Refugee, silence, agony
crawling back to me.
My inner Hell set free!

Sacrifice,
acceptance at a price.
Solidarity!
fuck you, I am integrity.

Insurrection!
Ritual aggression!
Ritual, Ritual!

Culminate while we instigate.
See my scars of hate,
this is the new dark age.

Build upon a war
that canât be won.
Infernal agony just
set me free.

Insurrection!
Ritual aggression!
Ritual, Ritual!

When you're facing the end
your pilgrimage begins.
Order out of chaos,
order from disorder.

Ritual, Ritual,
order from disorder.
Ritual!
