Chain link and concrete,
blood on the streets.
Different eyes and hair,
the scales of justice don't care.

Chain link and concrete,
blood on the streets.
Foreboding God Complex,
she never knew she was next.

Like Devils in uniform,
forced traditions to conform.
With the coming of caustic hordes
casualties become the norm.

Can you hear them?
Let them speak!

New dark ages ice my veins,
net worth different at birth
to protect and to serve.
Fuck that, are you insane?

When they fall, they fall strong,
real strength lies in resolve.
Dead justice has failed us,
rogue power, crooked laws.

Can you hear them?
Let them speak!
Can you hear them?
Let them speak!

"Na fronteira entre o cÃ©u e o inferno,
22 milÃ­metros de ferro!"

Testimony of survivor's tale,
triumphant verdict, the dead don't care.
Unseen terror, a horror dream,
guardian lost, what does it mean?

Chain link and concrete,
blood on the streets.
Different eyes and hair,
the scales of justice don't care.

Chain link and concrete,
blood on the streets.
Foreboding God Complex,
she never knew she was next.

She was next!
