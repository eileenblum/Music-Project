Under the blaze of the midnight sun,
to wreak destruction forward we go.
Expose the pain, now you reap what you sow.
Plague and storms, they will return.

Cut from life, face the light.
Cut from life, face the light.
Born to suffer, buried under,
Godâs Hammer, under rapture.

Cut from life!

Aeons descended from the Heavens,
ever defiant, open your eyes.
Abomination of desolation,
no one leaves until itâs time.

Cut from life, face the light.
Cut from life, face the light.
Born to suffer, buried under,
Godâs Hammer, under rapture.

Cut from life!

Igneous ophidian,
darkness inversion.
Splendor of all thatâs inhuman,
rapture, rapture, rapture.

Immortal ascension,
divine intervention,
killing intentions,
self-immolation.

Rapture...
Cut from life!

Holy gospel of savage faith,
grotesque glory reclaimed.
Rapture, rapture, rapture!

Primitive weapons for sacrifice,
pagan fire, poison messiah.
Rapture, rapture, rapture!

Rapture...

I see where the demons dwell,
fighting for your life.
Like lambs to the slaughter!
