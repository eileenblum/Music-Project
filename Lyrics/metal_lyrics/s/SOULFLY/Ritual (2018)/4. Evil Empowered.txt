Bow down to the
greatest corrupter,
the second coming of
the Antichrist unearthed.

Live with a curse,
kill in the name of God.
The Devil's won!

Knife in the back,
we ignored the truth!
Rise above, rise above,
rise above, rise above.

Can you see through the
veil that covers you?
Rise above, rise above,
rise above, rise above.

Evil in place of power!

Awoke by a thief in
the night of retribution,
pandemic welcoming of
your final solution.

We are cursed,
an idol to be your God.
The Devilâs won!

Knife in the back,
we ignored the truth!
Rise above, rise above,
rise above, rise above.

Can you see through the
veil that covers you?
Rise above, rise above,
rise above, rise above.

Evil in place of power!
