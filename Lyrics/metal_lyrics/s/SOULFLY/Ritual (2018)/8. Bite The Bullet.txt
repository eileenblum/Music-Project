I am part of the war,
I have been here before.
Grease the tires, spill the blood,
innocence dragged through the mud.

Anger, fear,
rising contradiction.
Suffer, pester, carrying
this affliction.

Bite, bite the bullet...

I am the master of my enemies,
feed the lions, on the run,
crosses covered, weighing a ton.

Power, hatred,
ashes in your mouth.
Demons, shadows
turn you inside out.

Bite, bite the bullet...

Only hate remains...

Hostile visions
beyond resistance.
Grotesque, hollow
I am becoming.

Summon warriors,
Gods of the old.
War eternal,
war immortal!

Bite, bite the bullet...
