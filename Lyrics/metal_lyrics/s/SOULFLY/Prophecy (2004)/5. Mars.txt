The new millennium is here
The smell of napalm and fear
All this confusion and mass hysteria
Welcome all to the new frontier

This fucking hate gets bigger and bigger
Consume ourselves in nuclear fear
And let me tell you that's the real enemy
How can you kill what you cannot see

I am Mars the God of War
You bow to me like you did before
I am Mars the God of War
You bow to me like you did before

Gas masks and AK-47's
Now you won't see the gates of heaven
Blood fire destroying weather
To blow you away, blow you away forever

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Chemical warfare and the bloodlust
Sign of Mars in a time to come
Mankind has finally done

I am Mars the God of War
You bow to me like you did before
I am Mars the God of War
You bow to me like you did before
