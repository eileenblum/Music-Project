What is wrong with humans from beginning of creation
Brutal dem a never gonna change no I
Father give dem life dat dem turn to sufferation
Politics dem worship in dem rage
They will never make to rule my life
No matter what takes I'm breaking their breaks
With Jah love humanity survive
No matter what takes I'm breaking their breaks

In this world that seems so lost
Are we warriors, are we not?
So many battles I have fought
So many more, I'm a soldier of God
Men against men I don't understand
Hate breeds hate in this rat race
We against you, watching you fall
Follow me know, blood of my blood

In this world that seems so lost
Are we warriors, are we not?
So many battles I have fought
So many more, I'm a soldier of God

Tribal war
Jungle law
Follow me now
Blood of my blood

Moses, Moses where are u?
Please! Show up tell the children what to do
