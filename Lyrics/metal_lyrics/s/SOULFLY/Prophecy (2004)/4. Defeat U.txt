So you say that doesn't interfere
And you don't care what happens here
But now I know what's your inner fear
'Cause what we had you were never near

My scars tell the story of destiny's deceit
I remain undisputed and blind to its defeat

It won't - Won't break me
It won't - Defeat me
We will - Will break you
We will - Defeat U

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger they say
I live like that in every way
Surviving on the razor's edge
Integrity until I lay to rest

It's me who's out for blood, soon all the floodgates open
Integrity's my only friend, prepared to fight its omens

It won't - Won't break me
It won't - Defeat me
We will - Will break you
We will - Defeat U

Fire spreads killing fear
Muthafucker your end is near
Can't bring me down
In a sea of shit you drown
