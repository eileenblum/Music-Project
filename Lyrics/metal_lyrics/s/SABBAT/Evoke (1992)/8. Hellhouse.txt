[Kanashibari part 3]

Older, rusty, in this house, the shadow of the ****** is wondering about
Black crows fly out from the roof, they tell you the end of your omen
You can't turn back once more, possessed you by the evil, in this house
Transforming you as living dead, you too, must wonder about in this ground
Hellhouse......
Fire of candle strangly light, lighting up black &amp; blue sore the walls
The mirror of distortion on the wall, the shadow of the evil goes through th mirror
The otherside of closed the door, hearing the voices of the veil's spell
Wrapped up you by devil's bells, opening the gate of hell to this ground
Hellhouse......
"Oh ~ I've been to hell and back to same place, my possessed here,
I'm a master in this house, get my soul of immortality,
In the mirror is my bed, torture guest to this house,
For atonement for my sins, new flesh sacrifice souls are ~~~~~~ "
Older, and rusty in this house, a bright hungry, the fangs of the evil
Beasts in hell call for evil spirits, singing the song of house's curse
The shadow of the evil laughing at you, you, you can't escape to outside
Transforming you as living dead, you too, must wonder about in this ground
Hellhouse......
