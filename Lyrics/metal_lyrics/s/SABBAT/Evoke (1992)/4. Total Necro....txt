When the fog eats storms, hear desire of raising zombies
When the thunder rapes ground, know voice of ghouls

[*] Manitous have flown down, the evil crosses the evil
Opened the gates of abyss, riveting onto magic circle
Possessed by total necro......

When the illusion freezes sun, feel blackness of crows
When the lights united darkness, hear fangs of madness
When the lust drinks terror, look harmonizing black &amp; red
When the oath calls devastation, know bleeding heaven in dark

[* (repeat)]

Hail to Satan, welcome to devil's paradise
Unknown beyond to whirlpool of the damned
