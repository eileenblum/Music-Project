Down the stream, more down in the Styx
Deep muddy water, no mercy streaming

It not given, favor of god
Gave devils' smile, dark terrible screaming

* Stream of pain, or color of sin
The sin is choose one this, and cross the Styx
Looks like paradise, or seems like return
But it is, river of hell

Five rivers of Erebus, the thrilling Styx
It is like a death, most hatefull streaming

If drink this water, memory of exist
Joy sorrow all lose, and lose in hell
