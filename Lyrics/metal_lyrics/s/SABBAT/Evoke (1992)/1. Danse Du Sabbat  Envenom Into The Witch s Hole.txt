Flirting with devils &amp; witches in the sabbat's feast
They get it off in the darkness &amp; evil
Incubus, Andras, Lucifer, Asmodeus
Abaddon, Marchcias, Astaroth, Bellzebuth
Drink up nectar of sacrifice's blood
Choose dancin' naked witches
They're waiting endlessly indecently
Open witches up wide

* Envenom into the witch's hole
Into the darkest hole, into the witch's hole
Cold seed, liquid of yellow ~~~

Sabbat gets climax, screaming of the beasts
Burning on, dark of the night, the wings fly away ~~~

Envenom ! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Insert ! Oh ~ !!
