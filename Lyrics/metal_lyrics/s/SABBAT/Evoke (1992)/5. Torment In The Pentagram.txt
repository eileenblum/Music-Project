The lord Satan, magic night, the believer, offer your body
Black candle's fire surrounds you, sacrifice young animals

[*] Blazing spell on the alter, possessed the devils flying
Freezing your soul in pain &amp; hate, you've got a fall of hell
Torment in the pentagram
In the sea of blood, storm of spells
Torment in the pentagram

Now in here sleepless grave, no death to you
In the poisoned crys, into your soul, bring moment of bitter
While you watch beasts eating away, your corpse without soul

[* (repeat)]

Offered your soul, in return for your mind, in full of revenge
The torment changes into fire of revenge, brings death to hatefull the man
