Devils were created by Satan for servants from hell
Satan was created by you for fallen angel to hell

[*] Godforsaken creations are digging the grave to destruction
You're godz of Satan, you're godz of eternity

Silly you were created by god for govern the universe
But you who created Satan, gasping, wasting, decaying

[* (repeat)]

Blissfull you can't know coming along dread,
Even if the greens blaze up in black
Blind you can't wake up from evil mind
Even if the blues dying to red
The lord of creations who own the seven deadly sins
On hell ! The seven deadly sins on hell ~ !!

Raging mother ground began to spout out bloodfire from hell
Raging mother sea &amp; sky began to uncover ways to hell
