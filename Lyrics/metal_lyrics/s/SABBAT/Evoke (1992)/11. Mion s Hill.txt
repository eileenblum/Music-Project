Run - run to Mion's hill
All witches who wear the black clothes
The devil's ceremony is opened now,
The times which curse them has come
Sacrifice ! Kneel in front of the devil' king
Sabbatical magic tonight !
Learn the evil spell from him
With a shout of the devil' king,
The fire blazes up, by and by,
Your body becomes dirty by the sword
The witch disappears into the fire

[repeat]

When the day breaks,
The witches fly up for the sky
When the fire went out,
They swear that we meet them again
