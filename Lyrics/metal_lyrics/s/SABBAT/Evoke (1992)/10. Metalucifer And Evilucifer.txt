Swear by faith of black bible
Take the swords of brave warriors
Immortalize damned greedy souls
Break through terrible fate
This battle needs magical evil
And revengeful steel
I give you wisdom of the evil
I give you megaforce
I'm a metalucifer
The holy brightness &amp; the dark magic
I'm an evilucifer
Now or never is the time to unite them
Ride on death horses, praise steely bloody swords
Kill all of false idols, destroy ! For you no mercy of gods
