Why do you want an eternal life ?
Why do you look for the immortality ?
Does to live long have the meaning ?
In this desolate world, what do you want ?
Do you fear blind the beyond
A spring of Lourdes, what is there here ?
Man is mortal, one of all mortal creatures
You must die and be born

*
I give this magic drugs to you
This drug that all is lost, be void
The elixir of life gives you a true hell
Surely you must look for death

Why do you want an eternal life ?
Why do you look for the immortality ?
Do you want to live as the gods ?
Want to watch many pains and tortures

[repeat *]
