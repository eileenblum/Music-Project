A steam whistle blows
Doubtful strange sound
In the middle of the quiet night
Smoke's given out
Doubtful strange smoke
With give off a nasty smell
Envelope in a dense fog
At fog to meet
A light burn in the darkness
Lucifer's train
Carrying some selection
Start running heartlessly
Heavily move
Oh-! Voice of sorrow resound painfully
No-! Nobody can stop that dark vehicle

*
Ghost train, black gate of hell
Ghost train, darkside of this world

In the dark train
Uneasiness drift in it
Confusion in my mind
Un experienced
Bottomless strange fear
Tremble with oppressive strain
Spirit is go mad
In may body
Against my heart struggle
One's pain finish
One's pain begin
In the next world
Heavily start
Oh-! Voice of sorrow resound painfully
No-! Nobody can get off that dark vehicle

**
Ghost train, black moving coffin
Ghost train, long way to death

Un experienced
Bottomless strange fear
Tremble with oppressive strain
In the ghost train

[repeat *]
