Satan ! Satan !
Searching from hell to hell
Angel ! Black angel !
I've got a complete way

*
We kiss the wings of Satan
In answer to his calls
We're signed on black bible
With our own blood
We trust in Satan
Through the laws of demons
We trust in Satan
Swear to live in the dark

Father ! Parson, priestess !
We give mega-brutal death
Sister ! Virgin sister !
We fuck like a beast

[repeat *]

With the blessings of Hades
We'll outlive our rules
We can grow strong
Satanic royalty !
Die Harrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrd !!!

[repeat *]

We, we trust in Satan
In Satan we trust.........
