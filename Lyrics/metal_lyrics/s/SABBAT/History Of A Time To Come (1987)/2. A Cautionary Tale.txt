Faustus begin thine incantations,
take good care to draw thy circle true,
by God must you prevail -
for if you fail these
demons make a meal of you.

Your soul shall be their meat -
a kingly feast for them to eat,
beware your future at hand,
alas for thou art dammed.

[GOOD ANGEL:]
"Faustus seek repentance,
abjure this evil art,
cease this wretched wickedness
and cleans thy foolish heart,
for the evil that once served you
has made of you a slave,
and transformed your bed of roses'
to a premature grave."

Then in a mighty flash of light
before thee Mephistopheles appears.

[FAUSTUS:]
"I charge thee go and change thy shape,
for you fill my soul with fear.
Now swift-as-hell back to the fire
return an old Franciscan Friar."

[MEPHISTOPHELES:]
"Mortal command me while you can,
For surely thou art dammed."

[BAD ANGEL:]
"Faustus be thou resolute
in what thou wilst perform,
ignore these righteous idiots -
their trinity to scorn,
for years of depravation you receive eternal life,
but fame and wealth and maidens-fair
are by far the better price."

[FAUSTUS:]
"Temptations all around me,
is there nowhere I can turn?
Hellfire is all about me,
now I know that I shall burn,
I face excommunication for the error
of my ways - to burn in Hell for all my days.
Bell, book and candle, candle, book, bell,
forwards and backwards to damn me to Hell.

Jehova I beg thee have mercy on my soul.
Be gone foul beast that stands before me,
my God! The midnight hour chimes,
oh Lord have mercy he comes for me,
I haven't got much time.
I am awake this is no dream,
I cry - but terror takes my scream,
and now my future is at hand,
also for I am dammed."

[GOOD ANGEL:]
"Think for just one moment
and I'm sure that you will see,
the moral of this story -
that what shall be must be.
He who gives his soul to Hell,
must dare to pay the price,
he versed in divinity must
live a noble life -
OR ELSE HE IS DAMNED!
