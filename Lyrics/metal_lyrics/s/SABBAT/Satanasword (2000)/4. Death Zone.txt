There is no on every side
Phantom of past runs after coming
I have nothing to go any place
Unwilling to walk too
I am bound hand and foot
Only nihility on every side, but only phantom is alive
I am now between the devil And the deep blue sea

I don't understand reason for live
Just before going mad
Black death alighted and smile to me
Go mad, Here is Death zone
Pass the time but not change of scene
Wherever I go, ways of doing life, of unchanged time
I have nothing to object of future
This is the worst situation to live
I am pain, but nobody aware of me
I can't control of myself
Sad expectation in the nihility world
Strain my ears to phantom

I don't understand reason for live
Just before going mad
Black death alighted and smile to me
Go mad, Here is Death zone
I don't understand reason for live
Just before going mad
Black death alighted and smile to me
Go mad, Here is Death zone
