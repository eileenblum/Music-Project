Going through the deep forest of silence
When moonlight shines the ground through the fog
Towering on the hill, majestic ancient castle
Freezing shadow of black, emitting from all white walls

Sleeping in the underground room, sleeping in a black coffin without a cross
Locked evil life as an evil dream, but, darkness &amp; moonlight bring awakening

Someone's daughter, Sacrificed, the daughter is a maiden, the maiden is beautiful, pure without lie
The holy cross has no light, rusted holy water, mirror is a blind decoration, and all has no power

Dracula, looking for virgin's blood
Dracula, wandering at midnight
Dracula, phantom of Transylvania
Dracula, illusion of Transylvania

Walking through the forest of a witching midnight
When moonlight shines a city through lust
Nocturnal beasts obey under control of the dark law
Freezing eyes of blue, enslaved time &amp; heart

Sleeping in the underground room, sleeping in a black coffin without a cross
Locked evil life as an evil dream, but, darkness &amp; moonlight bring awakening

Ritual teeth of love approach gently to the neck, no bloody scene, a beautiful kiss of hungry love
Maiden's ecstasy of love, it changes pure blood into the soul of life to fly to the night sky again

Sleeping in the underground room, sleeping in a black coffin without a cross
Locked evil life as an evil dream, but, darkness &amp; moonlight bring awakening

Sleeping in the underground room, sleeping in a black coffin without a cross
Locked evil life as an evil dream, but, darkness &amp; moonlight bring awakening
