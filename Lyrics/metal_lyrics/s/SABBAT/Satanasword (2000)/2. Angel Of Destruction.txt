Hell is laughing at a new dawn
Rising rainbow of black
Over the mountain of corpses
Nightmare soars into the sky

Blood washes blood with blood
Terror brings stormy delight
Blood burns blood with blood
From evil queen's evil dark hole

Godforsaken, Son of death, Angel of destruction
Terminator, Master of death, Angel of destruction
Angel of destruction

Rain doesn't reach the ground
Decayed future, Raped creation
Angel's smile, dancing wings
It's temptation of destruction

Blood washes blood with blood
Terror brings stormy delight
Blood burns blood with blood
From evil queen's evil dark hole

Bestial god's, Karma of death, Angel of destruction
Unholy final, ecstasy of death, Angel of destruction
Angel of destruction

Godforsaken, Son of death, Angel of destruction
Terminator, Master of death, Angel of destruction 
Bestial god's, Karma of death, Angel of destruction
Unholy final, ecstasy of death, Angel of destruction
Here must be a grave of mortals
The mission is total destruction
Riding on the wings of Satan
Destroy under the sign of blasphemy
Angel of destruction
