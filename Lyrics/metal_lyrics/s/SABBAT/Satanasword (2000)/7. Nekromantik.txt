Close these eyes silently, and sleep peacefully
No fear, no pain, I look at my face
Lying down in weeds, terrified goddess
I realize her mercy, I have mercy, but, don't hesitate

You committed a morbid evil sin, the poisoned devilish soul into hell of torture
No light of heaven for you, for you, there is no R.I.P
I'm falling into a blazing black fire, Nekromantik
I go to hell with pleasure, I'm a masochist and sadist
I welcome the wrath of god, Nekromantik
I'll return to the next world again, call me a "Born devil"

Swimming with dazzling and tender shining lights
I look at my big flower, made by my sweet memories
Binding hard, her naked body, into the wet spring
Deeply putting myself into, playing pleasure, drunk with her

You committed a morbid evil sin, the poisoned devilish soul into hell of torture
No light of heaven for you, for you, there is no R.I.P
I'm falling into a blazing black fire, Nekromantik
I go to hell with pleasure, I'm a masochist and sadist
I welcome the wrath of god, Nekromantik
I'll return to the next world again, call me a "Born devil"

Female cat's crying in the dark light, let's show mercy on you
Hands on the neck stopped the pain, mortal agony has finished
Laying the sad corpse on the soil, no cross, no grave
I notice an offensive smell, but I don't notice a deathly smell

Purely, youthfully, streaming, crossing the river
Going far through the wonderful green forest
Cutting &amp; hacking the flesh &amp; bone, delight in the bloodshed
Bating away the chunks of flesh, I taste a beauty-taste, drunk with her

You committed a morbid evil sin, the poisoned devilish soul into hell of torture
No light of heaven for you, for you, there is no R.I.P
I'm falling into a blazing black fire, Nekromantik
I go to hell with pleasure, I'm a masochist and sadist
I welcome the wrath of god, Nekromantik
I'll return to the next world again, call me a "Born devil"
