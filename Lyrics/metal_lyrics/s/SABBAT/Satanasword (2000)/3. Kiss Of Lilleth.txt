It's not a dream, it's fuckin' true, kiss marks all over my body
I enjoyed it all, satisfied with her, in the bed of hell's pentagram
My piston was hell speed, as a wild horse, it never become to slow
I got a trip, fell into a trance, floated in please like an incubus

The queen's was beautiful, like bloody red roses, sweet rosesÂ
Mine was wrapped by the smell of the rose, I never saw in this world

Kiss of lilleth, more hard than satan
Kiss of lilleth, more heavy than satan
Witches! Lead me into the chateau of hell, Kiss mine again!

Made in hell, Satan's wine, we've stolen it, drunk on the sofa
She showered herself with the wine of blood, I've begun to pet her all
The queen's love juice is full of bright light, like black coal tar
But, it's fuckin' sweeter than sugar &amp; honey, my lustful blood swelled

The queen's was beautiful, like bloody red roses, sweet rosesÂ
Mine was wrapped by the smell of the rose, I never tasted here

Kiss of lilleth, I loved her more than satan
Kiss of lilleth, mine was deeper than satan 
Witches! Lead me into the chateau of hell, Kiss mine again!

Kiss of lilleth, more hard than satan
Kiss of lilleth, more heavy than satan
Kiss of lilleth, I loved her more than satan
Kiss of lilleth, mine was deeper than satan 
Witches! Lead me into the chateau of hell, Kiss mine again!
