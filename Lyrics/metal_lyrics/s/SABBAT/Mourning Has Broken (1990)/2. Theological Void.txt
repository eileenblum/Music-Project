Evolution the greatest lie
No answers to our past
Indication of certain forms
But only doubts are cast.

Experiment. Could it be
An interbreeding race?
Unshown to us
The Gods who own our face.

Forever watched from the sky
Report on mankind reads
Diseased to die from within
We've condemned all next of kin.

The genocide of mother Earth
As she awaits her rebirth
The cancer cell set to germinate
Our programme will annihilate

Spawning the seeds
Of an alien nation
The master race
Their pure creation

Detrimental effects set to take their toll
Sit back and watch the world.
Watch the world evolve.

Tracing back through the depths of time
Our past is out of line
Patterns found within different religions.

Accept what you will
For it may not be
You can twist reality
Cynical doubts lined with uncertainty.

Spinning the fine line
Tween fiction and fact
These stargazers storytales
No evidence intact.

Spawning the seeds
Of an alien nation
The master race
Their pure creation
Detrimental effects set to take their toll
Sit back and watch the world evolve.

Sewing the seeds
Paving the way - Repeat.
