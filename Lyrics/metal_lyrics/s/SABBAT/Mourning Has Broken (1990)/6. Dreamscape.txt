Broken thoughts which I have seen
Stemming from my childhood dreams
Haunted by surreal fears
Culled from my yesteryears.

With your last breath
You'll endure death
Never to awake
From the dreamscape.

In a world of illusion thoughts bring
Enchanted echoes around me they sing
In this world of subconscious take heed
Of the danger that R.E.M. state will bring

Wake me before I die
A death so calm when viewed from outside.
Cast unto eternal sleep
Reborn a void non entity
Remiaisce of days gone by
Beneath the flood of the moon lit sky

With your last breath
You'll endure death
Never to awake
From the dreamscape.

In a world of illusion never
Believe what seems reality
In this world of illusion always
Play the role that is not all it seems.

Wake me before I die
A death so calm when viewed from outside.
Together locked in this diligent state
Dreamweaving dreams, we both relate
An expression of my innerself
Warping your thoughts upon which I shall rape.
