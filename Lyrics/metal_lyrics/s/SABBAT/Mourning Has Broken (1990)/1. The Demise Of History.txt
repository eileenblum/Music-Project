Can you see tomorrows end?
The spawning of a new God begins
The cities been lost to the war.

Enemy existence is all abound
Death laughs, his begotten playground
The village of the damned is set forever.

There's a city forging in the underground
Escaping the terror that brought man down
Eclipsing nightmares bring the dreams to an end
Look upon the valley of the shadows transcend.

We all prey for the morning dawn
But the sun has died with our saviour,
All we see, the demise of our history.
All we see
is the need for tranquillity
All we see
A veil of conspiracy.

Puppet states are now in place
Times have oppressed the human race
The Empire of the dark has dawned.

Blackened skies beckon forth the nadir
Dramatising escalating fear
The masses flee the abyss in awe.

There's a revolution in the underground
Escaping the terror that brought man down
Eclipsing nightmares bring the dreams to an end
Look upon the valley of the shadow transcend.

Night prevails as a new day's born
We thought out faith would save us
All these lies.
Why all these lies?

All we see
Is the need for tranquillity
All we see
Is the demise of history.

[Narration:]
Pro-creation, manufacture of their master race
Abolition of the meek, only the strong remain
God created man to his own uniform
Birth of a new world through adoration.
