Dazed on the edge of his world
He looks on staring at his past life unfolding
Sail away on the waves of despair
Drowned within the tears that once cared

His kingdom has fallen down
As his thoughts take him back
For one who once treasured life
Now to paint the world black.

Who would believe
What I have seen?
Why has live betrayed me?
My mind the foe
The Judas
That deceived me.

Here we are
At the crossroads
Which way will we turn?

Is there life inside you?
These is life inside me
Can I live, will it ever be the same?
Do you know?

Sail away on the waves of despair
Drowned within the tears that once cared
There's a light shining down on me
My true advocate
My destiny I foresee
No to paint the world black.
