Split the ceiling, crumbled the wall
The bare iron
See inside, see opposite, crumbled place is nihilistic space
Burned color on every side, forbidly drying
The uncanny bug was floated with gleamed before that
I was watching that from afar

After that, the uncanny bugs often appeared and gleamed
I had been watching that from afar, what is that? why? I feel bad
Visible or invisible, Reality or hallucination
Line of the backbone is freezing
My brain is in confusion, no understanding
Am I going insane?

One night, the uncanny bugs appeared when I slept
And crawled on my body
After that, every night, the uncanny bugs appeared when I slept
And gnawed in my body

You were watching that from afar
