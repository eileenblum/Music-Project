Nations that open the gate of den, Fly over the violated mountains of spirit
Conquer the filled spring with pus, Evil forces! Invade peaceful nirvana
The damned roll of thunder without virtue, Crossing the released lightning
When the sword of glory mirrors the lusts, Obey the kings that ride hellâs horses

Laughing at the hanged believers in a nightmare, Lewd Karitimo
Lustful beauty, wanton juice is running over, Drown in the dream of Fuzan
Demoniac beast-child lives a brutal way, This evil wayâs reborn against virtue
Under the winds of a poison-flowerâs smell, Chant the cursed hate with evil law

Evil link, the highest, welcomed you, pray together, blazing spell of the oath
Feel the six deadly heavens in this hell,
The devils are screaming in between possessed your soul and soul
There is immortal vice, Here is the den of Hades

Crowding an evil tower that is built high, Servants under the hungry hellâs lust
Plucking the wings of angles, Offer the bloody fresh heads at the Sabbath
Sacrifices were blown in profane winds, Carved by revealed destiny
Spit holy motherâs ovary, Drink the squeezed holy Karyobingaâs marrow

Evil link, the highest, welcomed you, pray together, blazing spell of the oath
Feel the six deadly heavens in this hell,
The devils are screaming in between possessed your soul and soul
There is immortal vice, Here is the den of Hades

Soul-fire melted into the devilâs land, Torment! Fading the light of Buddha-sons
Call for the future of destruction, Going down! The opened darkness of this world
Evil forbidden souls begin to radiate
Fire to the Shinto shrines, Tiger-beast of evil power from the hellâs north
Bloody sign to intense fire of ruin, Bleed to the Styx with the deathâs axe-hammer
In the anthem of iconoclast

Black wings baptize the bleeding times, Poison winds shine on the beyond
Fire-king purifies you in infinite light, The evilâs ride on the shadows of clouds
This world fades away in the new world to come, Our lust-world opens the souls
The true darkness stands with evil forces, We swear in the stormy doom
The godâs kingdom is gone!!

Evil link, the highest, welcomed you, pray together, blazing spell of the oath
Feel the six deadly heavens in this hell,
The devils are screaming in between possessed your soul and soul
There is immortal vice, Here is the den of Hades
