Buried alive, dying alive, historyâs bog of the past days
Blooming flowers in the graveyard, there is not an only word
Laughing at the times of this world, when the dragon-tiger judges
Weâre again, blest it of ours, the law roars thundering hellishly now

Indomitable eternal soul that awakes at the hell
The silent fire of steel flames again
Golden spirit has been carved deeper than life
Weâre the Samurai, Samurai zombies
Feel the steel dancing in the air as ethereal winds
Weâre the zombies, Samurai zombies
Meet thy fate by the dark celestial ancient steel
Lead you to the highest, without voice &amp; blood, pleasure &amp; pain, sadness &amp; illusion, in thy evil
