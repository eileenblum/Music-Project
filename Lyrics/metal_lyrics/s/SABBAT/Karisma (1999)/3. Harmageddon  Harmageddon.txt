Shedding golden dying tears, Shakanyorai
The destructive wisdoms gather onto the alter, Morbid Buddhists
Greed flies at your soul and dwell, Decayed in order
Feel the final delight in this chaotic world, Amida

Burning with fury, Beautiful sight, Stormy destiny, Mortal welcome
Buddhaâs will into ruin, The eyes of god were blinded
Light of mercy in fatal darkness, Hellâs heaven is to come, Mighty Harmageddon

Crucified sinner on the cross again, Bloody Messiah
Corroded your souls are sacrifice, Unholy saints
Drowned in the sea of womanâs lust, Filthy nuns
Devilâs beasts sing and play to swear , Hymn to victory

Burning with fury, Beautiful sight, Stormy destiny, Mortal welcome
Buddhaâs will into ruin, The eyes of god were blinded
Light of mercy in fatal darkness, Hellâs heaven is to come, Mighty Harmageddon

The glasses are full of the black wine, A glowing kiss of Satan on this ground
Hellâs flag that flutters , Glory to war , Hail Harmageddon

Hellâs falling from unseen sky , By Ashuraâs stormy rage
Mad Kishibogin with a smile, Turning to be evil again
Nightmareâs here to be the pleasure, Itâs here, hell to fight
To bear new blood &amp; seed , Hail paradise creation

Devilâs desire is continued forever, It falls on your soulâs core
The sun never rises in the east, Your future &amp; hope dry up the seas

Shedding golden dying tears, Shakanyorai
The destructive wisdoms gather onto the alter, Morbid Buddhists
Greed flies at your soul and dwell, Decayed in order
Feel the final delight in this chaotic world, Amida

Burning with fury, Beautiful sight, Stormy destiny, Mortal welcome
Buddhaâs will into ruin, The eyes of god were blinded
Light of mercy in fatal darkness, Hellâs heaven is to come, Mighty Harmageddon

The glasses are full of the black wine, A glowing kiss of Satan on this ground
Hellâs flag that flutters , Glory to war , Hail Harmageddon
