You blood in your body
Bright flames black
Your bone in your flesh
Bright metal cold
Born out of motly egg
Made in hell, made by hell
Walk the same way as death
seek for sacrifice

*
Give to you blood
wicked eternal blood
The beast who born from
Dark, back to the dark
Evil Nations !
Under the reverse cross
be born by Evil blood
with us bleed and die

Don't feel the mercy
The sins are your rules
Don't feel the lights
The lusts are your rules
the bell tolls now
Infinite souls voice
Terror begins now
in the pleasure and pain

[repeat *]

Create our music !
Evil Nations !
Melody of Evil Nations !
Create our land !
Evil Nations !
Paradise of Evil Nations !
