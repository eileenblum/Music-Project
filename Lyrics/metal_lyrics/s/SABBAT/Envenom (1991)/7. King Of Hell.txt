Creation of destruction, he can open the gate of hell
Necromancer in pentagram, he's a master of manitou

He has no mortality, he has no sins, he has no times
Burning soul of crisscross, in the name of Satan
king of hell

Peace to war, war to force, he can enjoy all might
Light to illusion, illusion to the dark
He's a master of nightmares
