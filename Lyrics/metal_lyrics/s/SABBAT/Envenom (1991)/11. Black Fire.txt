[Bonus track]

The cursed hill is calling me
no future for you, aimed you by us
Take scattering flesh blood
Devil's wings, give to them, evil wings
Take cursed black fire
Go mad for rite, chant, pray, dance, shout
Insane world now in there
A figure comes out, surrounds us in screams
Poisoned spells, blazing up, into the fire,
We're drawn in, black fire ! Black fire !
Shout it ! Get it ! Dancing, now ! Burning, now !!!!!!
