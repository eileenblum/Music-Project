I love smell of blood, I love terror
I love brilliancy of knife, I love hell

I create light and dark, I create terror
I create pleasure and pain, I create hell

*
I'm running free, I'm running wild
for art, for my life. Everybody calls me insanity
I do anything for great art  the eviler  !

I hated my father, he was a dog
I hated my mother, she was a queen of night
1 was godforsaken poison child
grown my trashblood, I'm a born demon

[repeat *]

My flesh will die, return to the ground
Someday in faraway time, but ! Soul will die hard !
Everybody calls me insanity. I do anything for great art
Live for metalart, die for metalart soul of art of Evil !
