[KANASHIBARI Part. 2]

I'm roaming through in the woods
somebody is calling me from in the dark.
I'm a right mind but I can't control,
my body is pulled by a strange thing.

It leads up to black the hole, the gloomy darkness covers up me
the smell of corpse hang over, the servant of hell whispers to me

*
Com'on here, there is no the pain, sadness, agony...
Your desire will be satisfied, all hope : passion, wish all...

Why do you live on in ugly, dirty, rotten world...
You will be able to get the grace of gods... deathtemptation!
I'm standing at the cliff, in calm winds and tides
He calls me, leads up to here, he says death is immortal life into
the sea by invisible hands, i can see the past of my life
In strange beautiful lights, everything goes nothingness

[repeat *]

I'm falling between white shadow and black shadow
I can see bright lights and flowers, playing children, singing voice
but I can't reach to the circle, I'm falling to darkest hole into
insane fire and lake of high heat, everything goes into eternal
pain...: You're helling in hell now, to lightless grave ! welcome
to hell - Your soul rot on torment to the ground ! - to the dark
bottom - You get gradge and rages in endless pain ! - With the
power of Devil - As and Evil spirit, you'll return to that world !!
... Deathtemptation!
