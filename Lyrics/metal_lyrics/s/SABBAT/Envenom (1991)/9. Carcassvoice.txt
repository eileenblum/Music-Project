Voice of Satan fell from death red sky
Blood of Angels faded away into the torment beyond
Lightless fire of candles on the cross in the grave
I'm one of in there, I can see sea of blood

I'm a normal, I'm a man believe me ! Believe me !
Please ! I'm a son of god ! Don't kill me, please !
Genocide ! Carcassvoice !

Smell of dead bodies without souls to rain of crosses
of blood in the storm of fire balls !
Kill them ! They have nightmares ! Kill them ! Kill them !
They're machines ! They're obsessed by ghost of war !
Under damned filthy holy gods
Locked us in by authority. Controlled by law for their desire.
Break the cage, the chains, destroy the destiny !
