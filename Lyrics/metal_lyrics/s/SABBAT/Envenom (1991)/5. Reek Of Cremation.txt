Burning ! Fire rising, the baptism of Fire
Blasphemy ! Unholy funeral, Evil fire worship
Oh hear the call from the grave beyond
Empty altar awaits it's victim
Reek of cremation !
Nightmare ! Torment in fire, merciless death
Mutilation ! Ripping apart, severing flesh
I devour the charred body
Oblivious lo life for you're beyond death
Reek of cremation !
