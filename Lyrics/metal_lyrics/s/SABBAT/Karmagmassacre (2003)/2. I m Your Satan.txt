[Gezol]

I rape your baby, lover and mother
I give you fatal nightmare every night
I bring the darkest darkness into your fate
I devastate your soul in sabistic pain

Relentless to the bone, I'm black to the core
Into inferno you go
Withering beautiful sight, scornful insanity
Grief is thy name

I beat the ones who bleed
Always hungry I scream for more
I'm your Satan

Hopeful future, I never give you forever
Blind your eyes, I never create littles lights
Drowning you, I never bring the ship of Noah
Bleeding, dying you, but
I never take away your final breath

Relentless to the bone, I'm black to the core
Into inferno you go
Withering beautiful sight, scornful insanity
Grief is thy name

I beat the ones who bleed
Always hungry I scream for more
I'm your Satan

Relentless to the bone, I'm black to the core
Into inferno you go
Withering beautiful sight, scornful insanity
Grief is thy name

I beat the ones who bleed
Always hungry I scream for more
I'm your Satan
