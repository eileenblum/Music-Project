[Gezol]

In the dead of the night, gathered at a master's command
Demons rising, beyond their sleeping void
When one angelwitch spreads her airy wings
Invoked baphomet, sabbatical mass is held

Close your frozen eyes
Open your demonic eyes
In hatred and revenge
Your curse is swelling, burstin' up
To fullfill your needs, evil mission dwells inside
Witches welcome you all to eternal necromancy
Fresh blood of sacrifice drops down on you
Let your rites be rightly performed with beauty

Close your frozen eyes
Open your demonic eyes
In hatred and revenge
Your curse is swelling, burstin' up

Candle's dark shine on a mass of witches
Black magical circle of witches

Close your frozen eyes
Open your demonic eyes
In hatred and revenge
Your curse is swelling, burstin' up

Candle's dark shine on a mass of witches,
Black magical circle of witches
Candle's soul-shine on a mass of witches,
Black sabbatical circle of witches
