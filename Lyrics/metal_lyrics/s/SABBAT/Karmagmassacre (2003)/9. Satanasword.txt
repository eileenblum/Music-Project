[Gezol]

Let the thunder roar begin, let the storm roar begin
No prayer to die in sacred war, raging in blasphemy
The wheel of black fire headed straight to the holy sun
Echoes scream out liberty, the released prisoners from hell

Oh - See the steel glisten in the dark, the sword of Satan
Yeah - Swear before the lord of hell, force of Satan
Sparking in potential ancient bloodlust, the sword of evil
Oh - Summoning six hundred sixty six soldiers of evil

So gracious we will kill as god erased filthy creatures
Where all god's dreams are gonna fall, hold up high Satanasword
So glorious we will fly like the lord in the bloody sky
Where a new world shall arise, swing up high Satanasword

Dying to live, living to die, we're all eternal sinners
Going on with bestial way as devil eats devil away
Blood runs into a poisoned river where the corpses lie
Suck the mixed blood with the extract, cry in blasphemy

Oh - See the steel glisten in the dark, the sword of Satan
Yeah - Swear before the lord of hell, force of Satan
Sparking in potential ancient bloodlust, the sword of evil
Oh - Summoning six hundred sixty six soldiers of evil

So gracious we will kill as god erased filthy creatures
Where all god's dreams are gonna fall, hold up high Satanasword
So glorious we will fly like the lord in the bloody sky
Where a new world shall arise, swing round Satanasword

So gracious we will kill as god erased filthy creatures
Where all god's dreams are gonna fall, hold up high Satanasword
So glorious we will fly like the lord in the bloody sky
Where a new world shall arise, swing up high Satanasword
