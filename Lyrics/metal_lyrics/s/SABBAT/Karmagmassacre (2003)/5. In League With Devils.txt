[Gezol]

Baptized fire burns god's fortress out
The damned shouting an oath holding torches
Calling up immortals, stealing god's sight
Let the dark souls out to play

Summoning the storm, united for revolution
Death plays a rhapsody for victory

In league with devils, dancin' with the dead
In league with devils, chantin' for Gloria, yeah
In league with devils, singin' for dominion, Oh-
In league with devils, dancin' with hell's bitches
Baptized lightning burns blessed trinity out
The beasts of hell howling for destruction to come
Majestically swallowing every shadow whole
Capturing every ray of sunshine

Summoning the storm, united for revolution
Death plays a rhapsody for victory

In league with devils, dancin' with the dead
In league with devils, chantin' for Gloria, yeah
In league with devils, singin' for dominion, Oh-
In league with devils, dancin' with hell's bitches

Warhead's prepared, in the name of dying gods,
Mortals screaming for mercy
It's the time mortals all come to fear,
Into the avenging battle
Let's begin the final doomed war

In league with devils

In league with devils, dancin' with the dead
In league with devils, chantin' for Gloria, yeah
In league with devils, singin' for dominion, Oh-
In league with devils, dancin' with hell's bitches
