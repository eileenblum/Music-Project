[Gezol]

Darkness and fire, under the morbid moon
Exposed delusions, finally
Bloodstained lights, under the poisoned sun
Gods about to die, hail and kill

When the blood rains, open the gates of hell
Across infernal wastelands, sunburnt seven paradises

Bounded by blood, brothers of demons
Spread seeds to be succeeded in hell
Bounded by spell, sisters of demons
In grace, have the eggs to be witches of hell

Doomed by the delusions, into the depths of the dead sea
The sodomized sinners
Pleasures and heavens, sealed by the holy plot
The forbidden crosses, hail and destroy

When the blood rains, open the gates of hell
Across infernal wastelands, sunburnt seven paradises

Bounded by blood, brothers of demons
Spread seeds to be succeeded in hell
Bounded by spell, sisters of demons
In grace, have the eggs to be witches of hell

Brothers of demons, sons of demons, Sacrifice
Sisters of demons, daughters of demons, witchcraft
Brothers of demons, sons of demons, bestial blood
Sisters of demons, daughters of demons, cast the spells
In the name of Satan, in this kingdom of hell

Bounded by blood, brothers of demons
Spread seeds to be succeeded in hell
Bounded by spell, sisters of demons
In grace, have the eggs to be witches of hell
Feeling the serenade ofwitches play,
In the winds of hell's desecration
Heaven is in its breath of Satan
From sodomy necropolis, devils rise again,
Demons
