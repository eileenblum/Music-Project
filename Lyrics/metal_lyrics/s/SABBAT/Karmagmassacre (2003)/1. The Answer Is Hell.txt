[Gezol]

Swimming in the eternal greedy desire
The raped fairies by priests under the holy cross
Devils drink up all water from final mountains
Angels get the source of lust
Instead of the sacred bible

God's creatures built on delusion is rotting away
Mortals are the ones attached to all that is insane
Where are we going in the conspiracy of gods?
You know the reason, you know the nightmare,
You know... The answer is hell!

Screaming of the bleeding moon calls screaming
Of the bleeding grounds
Bloody fire's flames on the top of a black candle
Master gods are in league with lord of Satan
Ashy sun welcomes the darkness without end

God's creatures built on delusion is rotting away
Mortals are the ones attached to all that is insane
Where are we going in the conspiracy of gods?
You know the reason, you know the nightmare,
You know... The answer is hell!

God's creatures built on fake is rotting away
Mortals are the ones attached to all that is insane
Where are we going in the conspiracy of gods?
You know the reason, you know the nightmare,
You know... The answer is hell!

Woah- hell! all hell let loose
Woah- hell! all hell let loose
