You must know them, Lucifer's pride
The seven crosses, Asmodeu's lust
Knock the gates of... Mammon's covetousness
Shall open easy, Satan's anger
Taste your desires, Beelzebub's gluttony
Leviathan's envy, Belphegor's sloth
The seven crosses of damnation
Set you free from the tortures, take total pleasures
Break! Sleep! Sneak! Rape! Devour! Betray!
Precipitating you, but your sins is the God's sins
The Gods creation is Disgust creature
