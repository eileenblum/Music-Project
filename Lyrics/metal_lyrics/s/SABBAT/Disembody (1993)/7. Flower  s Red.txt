What Beautiful, Splendid Flowers
Innocent, Clean, Pure, Flower's Colour
I've Never Felt Such Wonderful Peace
Who? Keeper Of This Paradise
This Flower's Red Is True Red
Into Effulgent Flower's Sweet Smells
Anger, Hate And Sorrow, I Don't Feel 'Em
Times, Noises And Airs, Fading Away
The Flowers Of Bloody Unknown Legend Bloom
The Darkest Children
Know Nothing, Think Nothing, Realize Nothing
Living In The Darkness
Flowers Red The Blood Of The Children
Flowers Twinkle The Eyes Of The Children
Flowers Smell The Souls Of The Children
Flowers Paradise The Bed Of The Children
Children's Voices From Limbo
Ride On Breeze, Will Tell You Bloody Legend
