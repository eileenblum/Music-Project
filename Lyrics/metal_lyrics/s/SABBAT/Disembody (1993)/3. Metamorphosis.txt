Where something coming from?
Coming through invisible the dark
Calling evil in me, when devil and angel
Suffers wicked torture together,
I'm going to change

From dark of black night,
Blood of necrobeast at witching hour
Is this a retaliation of the God?
Or death a conduct of Satan
Angel's smile crumbles down,
Which shall I see, heaven or hell?

Night of metamorphosis,
Coming into my void
In the dark of the immortal
Bringing me a terrible time,
Hell going to change, my soul

Metamorphosed my body, my mind,
Makin' the shadow of insane scene
Is this a retaliation of the God?
Or death a conduct of Satan
Devil's smile also crumbles down,
Which shall I see, heaven or hell?
