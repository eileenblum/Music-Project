Please drag me, out of this place
I wanna be born, give me a voice
My tortures, substitute of lusts
Realize me please, give me a voice

The candle's fire burning on still at the Hades
But you don't notice immortal our souls
Our souls are hellish filthy ugly
On the ways of merciless doom
From the darkside to the darkside, unknown massacra

Not go to heaven, give me my name
Not go to hell, too, give me outside light
Buried alive, far away beyond
But truth is one, profane fate

Killed as midge, cry don't reach
Mutilated body to the trash box
No grave stone, no funeral bells
Evanescent life, unblessed life

Unknown massacra, give me a voice
Unknown massacra, unblessed life!
