Crucified by tormentor
Hunted and tortured, thrashed by priests
Pushed down to boiling water
Endless pain, medieval slaughter

They're the last ones alive, beasts scream for revenge
Breaking the holy spell, necromancy is back

Witching hour, sacrifice, woah
Incantation, to the magical dolls
Stick spikes in... black mass...
Witch hammers

Crucifixion on the scaffold
Guillotine fell down to the neck

Push down to the bottom of inferno
Revenge is mine, agony to mortals
