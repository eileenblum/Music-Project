Rotten mountains crying for pain
Violet fog envelopes the tearful forest
Hell's machine of the reaper breathing out
The blackened sun rising at dawn

This world you never realize
Nobody feels the fear of the dark side
Mortals live in the grievous dominion
Ruining your inner fate
No more time to pray, no knell of the end
Black prophecy flying high
Cryin' for blood, cryin' for death,
The sign of fate nobody knows
Ravens tell

Acid rivers screaming for torture
Muddy gas gushing from the sorrowful lake
Bloody slaughter of the absurd
Godforsaken destiny, forgotten souls
