Decayed, morbid wisdom,
Holy church, the fortress of slave
Devastation, the creation of lust
Human race, guilty breed
Dying holy gods, praise the extinction
Avengers riding on the storm, blessed by the dark lord
Mission from hell, command from hell, total destruction
Destroy 'em all, the domain of gods, total destruction
Pleasure to kill, pleasure to ruin, extermination

Mission of hell, command of hell,
The towering storm singing an anthem of hell
Revelation, the idle prophecy
Holy canon, trap of gods
Mortals, lower creatures
Messiah, running away
Pray for the revolution, the creatures are dead and gone
The ritual of resurrection, the creation comes to the end
Execute the final command
Welcome to the mortal end
