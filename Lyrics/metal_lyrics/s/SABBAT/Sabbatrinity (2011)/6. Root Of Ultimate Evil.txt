Freezing over, cold winter night
The mother and her son were running away
Lying on the iced river of the border
No foods, no drink, no power

Their back is the field of hell beneath the red flag
Heading for freedom, no turning back
Evil force, a bloody star of the red
The sign of dictator, root of ultimate evil

The mother said, "My son, eat me"
When the abyss was freezing over
The son had to decide to leave there
A soul bringing to the free western land
