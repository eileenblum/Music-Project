Witches gathering, Baphomet is calling
Torches flaring up, into the ritual circle
The witches turn the crosses upside down
Turning over the first page of satanic bible
Kiss the sword, kiss the fire
Drink the wine from the skull
Invocation to the pentagram
Burning in the raging curse
Witch's torches
For the devil, a virgin daughter, crucified
The sacrifice screaming, dark night of revenge
Terror of despair raising a flaming curse
Serpents licking up the swollen soul
