Rise in rebellion, desecration, we live as beasts,
The armed resistance, the enemy is over there,
The burning churches, damnation is war cry, it's delight
Waaaarrrggghhh! Dieeerrrggghhh! Beheadaaarrrggghhh!
Demonic swords, maces of hell, no promise to surrender
Salvation army for recapture, victory!
Northern satanism
Christian is pagan, our might mountains,
The spirit is on our side, gracious sea
I'm a son of Satan, I'm a son of Lilith
Pound the legion of Christ, onslaught!
