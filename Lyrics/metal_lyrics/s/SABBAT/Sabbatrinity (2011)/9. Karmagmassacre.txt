Your body knows, your body realizes
Out of control, in the unseen desires
Close your eyes deep, open your eyes wide
No time to dream, blood falls like rain
The heart is volcano, the blood is magma
Boiling in karma, running in your veins
Gushing from the infernal volcano
Gods of fantasy never helps you in eternity
Drowned in the sea of melted karma
The demons run away from the madness
Karmagmassacre
Your ghoulish pride, your decayed pride
No feeling of despair, for the future of greed
Close your eyes slowly, open your eyes silently
No time to sleep, blood devours death (away)
Your poisoned faith, your decayed faith
No feeling of mercy, in the wonderful hate
Under your bibles, take your arms now
No time to pray, bloody chain of revenge
