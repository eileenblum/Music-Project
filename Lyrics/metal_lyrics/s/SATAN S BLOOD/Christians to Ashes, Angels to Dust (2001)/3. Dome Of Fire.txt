Man's not man
Beast's not beast
Before living
No fear of dying

Forever I dream
Forever I scream
A lambent flame of red
That should be the sign
Forever I am
Forever I fight
We raise the sword
Throughout the night

Kissing the lord
Suffer the weak
Let it be ever thus
That's the creation of fire

Forever I dream
Forever I scream
A lambent flame of red
That should be the sign
Forever I am
Forever I fight
We raise the sword
Throughout the night

Violence the way of live
Hit the fools into grave
There is no human being
Who came back from the dead

Man's not man
Beast's not beast
Before living
No fear of dying

Forever I dream
Forever I scream
A lambent flame of red
That should be the sign
Forever I am
Forever I fight
We raise the sword
Throughout the night

Satan's Blood...
Rise up following the black part of soul
The evil messiah is who we search for
Tales of darkness describing his rank
Deciding on life or death

Satan's blood, infects your soul
Satan's blood, darkest control
Time to die, no way to hide
Time to die, ungracious abyss

Covered with blood in visions and illusions
Time to step deeper into dark territory
Destroyed balance as the gates torn free
Let flow red crystals out of your veins

Master of blackened arts
Hypnotic eyes to break your mind
To kill in blood with pride
To listen to the screams of eternity
Mystic circle will close this night
Burn the churches as symbol to fight
The leader of darkness in burning flames
Sacrifice your life in his old games

Rise up following the black part of soul
The evil messiah is who we search for
Tales of darkness describing his rank
Deciding on life or death

Satan's blood, infects your soul
Satan's blood, darkest control
Time to die, no way to hide
Time to die, ungracious abyss

Covered with blood in visions and illusions
Time to step deeper into dark territory
Destroyed balance as the gates torn free
Let flow red crystals out of your veins
