Evil controlling my mind
In my unveiling body of hate
My heart, my malicious tongue
Prays the way to insanity

My mind
Body of hate
Malicious tongue
To insanity

Be the son of the devil
On the path of evil incarnation
I'm above and in you
My ecstasy is in yours

My mind
Body of hate
Malicious tongue
To insanity

Be the son of the devil
On the path of evil incarnation
My joy is to see your joy
Under the inverted crosses of the lord
I take away your life
Save your soul in black dimension
My joy is to see your joy
Under the inverted crosses of the lord

Before you are leaving your body
Pray to the apostle of infinity
You cannot see me
As a stranger but no other god
You are the chosen one
I will lead you to the Lord of Thebes
You are the chosen
I will lead you to the Lord of Thebes

My joy is to see your joy
Under the inverted crosses of the lord
I take away your life
Save your soul in black dimension
My joy is to see your joy
Under the inverted crosses of the lord

My mind
Body of hate
Malicious tongue
To insanity

Be the son of the devil
On the path of evil incarnation
I'm above and in you
My ecstasy is in yours

My mind
Body of hate
Malicious tongue
To insanity

Evil controlling my mind
In my unveiling body of hate
My heart, my malicious tongue
Prays the way to insanity
