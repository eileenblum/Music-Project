Burn the crypts of agony
My ritual has begun
Swallow lunatic
Of Satan's creation
For a life
In the demons lodge

Signed the book of blood
Lead me to the path
Of unholy world of doom
My foot marks the ground

Burn the crypts of agony
My ritual has begun
Swallow lunatic
Of Satan's creation
For a life
In the demon's lodge

Breath of life will flow
Free your soul for all time
The contest for you
An avoidance
For the demon's lodge

Demon's lodge, awake my soul
Demon's lodge, my blood for you

Signed the book of blood
Lead me to the path
Of unholy world of doom
My foot marks the ground

Burn the crypts of agony
My ritual has begun
Swallow lunatic
Of Satan's creation
For a life
In the demon's lodge
