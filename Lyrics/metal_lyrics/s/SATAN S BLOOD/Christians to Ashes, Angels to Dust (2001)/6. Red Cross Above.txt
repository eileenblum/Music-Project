Hear the voice of Jesus Christ
Will bring you peace from heaven
God for you, there will be no compromise
In his old words you'll find no lies
A call to him to take your hand
But you'll awake with the shadow behind

Morbid truth, kingdom of time
Speak the words of emptiness

Altar of blackened arts speaks to you
Will give your live a sense
Hordes of darkness creating a new form of live
Gives me the power to rise again on my undead journey
Awake in blood and fire
To see the world a second time

Red Cross above

Flesh is what I seek
Brains for me to eat
The feeling I get, the power I have
Raise the flag of the damned legions
The feeling I get, the power I have
Come with me into darkness heaven

Morbid truth, kingdom of time
Speak the words of emptiness

Altar of blackened arts speaks to you
Will give your live a sense
Hordes of darkness creating a new form of live
Gives me the power to rise again on my undead journey
Awake in blood and fire
To see the world a second time
