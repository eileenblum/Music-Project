Foresee the fight to heaven creatures
Innocent in white garments
High above, faceless divine
Frantic eyes, too blind to see
Terror zone with open end
Controlled with strings

Freeze your mind the method to kill
See my world of unforgettable horror
Show who you are, the other side of darkest heaven

Selecting in pain
Christians to ashes, angels to dust
Be my slave
Christians to ashes, angels to dust
Cut flesh blood rain
Christians to ashes, angels to dust
Innocence to grave
Christians to ashes, angels to dust

Freeze your mind the method to kill
See my world of unforgettable horror
Show who you are, the other side of darkest heaven

Selecting in pain
Christians to ashes, angels to dust
Be my slave
Christians to ashes, angels to dust
Cut flesh blood rain
Christians to ashes, angels to dust
Innocence to grave
Christians to ashes, angels to dust

Blood drops from your lips
One way to go ahead
Strike down with hellish power
Warriors of hell in time
Ripping lords waiting for you
Life will end in despair and slime
No cross to protect your fucking innocent soul
You shall never rest

Selecting in pain
Christians to ashes, angels to dust
Be my slave
Christians to ashes, angels to dust
Cut flesh blood rain
Christians to ashes, angels to dust
Innocence to grave
Christians to ashes, angels to dust
