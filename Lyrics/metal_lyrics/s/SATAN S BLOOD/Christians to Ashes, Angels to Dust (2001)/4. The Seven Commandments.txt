Let me be the one you believe in
I will save your soul for a live after death

Satan embodies the satisfaction of desire
And not a life of abstinence
Satan embodies the rigorous existence
And not the spiritual fantasy
Satan embodies absolute wisdom
And not a holy self-deception
Satan will give your favor
And no love to the thanklessness

Let me be the one you believe in
I will save your soul for a live after death

Satan embodies revenge
In fact of a fault in a second time
Satan embodies responsibility
To the guys of sound mind
Satan embodies all the sins...
