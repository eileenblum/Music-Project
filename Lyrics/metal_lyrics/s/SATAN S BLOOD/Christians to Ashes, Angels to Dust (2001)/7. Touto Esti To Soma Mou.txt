Come over me
Influence my soul
Split the world
Into heaven and hell
Blue, heal the wounds
Give me peace in time

Moved by the stone down earth
Hordes of terror are awaiting to strike
Following the leader into war

Come over me
Influence my soul
Split the world
Into heaven and hell
Blue, heal the wounds
Give me peace in time

With hoofs of steel
I race on the rocks
Through solstice stubborn
To equinox

And I rave
And I rape
And I rip
And I rend
Everlasting
World without end
Mannihin
Maiden
Maenad
Man
In the might of Satan

With hoofs of steel
I race on the rocks
Through solstice stubborn
To equinox

Come over me
Influence my soul
Split the world
Into heaven and hell
Blue, heal the wounds
Give me peace in time

With hoofs of steel
I race on the rocks
Through solstice stubborn
To equinox

Moved by the stone down earth
Hordes of terror are awaiting to strike
Following the leader into war

Come over me
Influence my soul
Split the world
Into heaven and hell
Blue, heal the wounds
Give me peace in time
