Deep in the vortex... Scattered is life 
Visage of emptiness... Darkness is rife 

Celestial corpses lie still, overthrown 
Shrines to their greatness are wastelands of stone 

Deposed, defiled by the splendour of fools 
Entombed with the flesh they had ruled 
Fallen, makers by their children were doomed 
Trampled limp in time-ravaged ruins 

Slaves, driven mad with envy of gods 
Shades in the dead of the stars 
Here perished aeons of the glory untold 
Now a tale only told by its scars 

Deep in the vortex... Scattered is life 
Visage of emptiness... Darkness is rife 

Flawed by creation, Summoned the will to destroy 
Chained to the ages, burn in the gaze of the stars 

Cold is the vortex, scattered is life 
Gods broken, erased and entombed 
Once reigned a power so ageless and cruel 
Now their pitiless thrones are destroyed 

Beasts, they wrought from dead of the rift 
Now slaves to the makers of old 
Heaven and hell shall be crushed in their wake 
The fate of the universe ridden with scars 

To know is to murder 
To speak is to fight 
And woe is the moment 
When lore becomes might 

Floating distortions 
Of decadent past 
The mighty have fallen before 
Like echoes of battle... on dissident planes 

The tides had devoured their shores 

Omnipotents fallen by knowledge alone 
Forgotten and dead is their reign 
No spoils for the victor but desolate void 
The knowledge of ancients now dead and destroyed 

No purpose 
No masters 
They perish and fall 

The tides had devoured their shores
