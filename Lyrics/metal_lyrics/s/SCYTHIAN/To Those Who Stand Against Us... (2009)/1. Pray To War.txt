Pray to war! 
Cold submission. Kneel! 
Gather the plague of faithful! 
The zealous, the fateless... the cleansing begins 

Doom brigades 
March ever onwards 
Badlands made of flesh 
Iron savage: kill for honour! 

Charge through blood and scattered remains 

Gone are they who ruled before us 
Order was their lie 
Justice found in heartless battle 
In seas of spears we die 

In sacred conflict, men as gods 
Lead armies of attrition 
Slaughter now becomes our privilege 
Pray to war... the new religion 

Purify with death! 

Funeral pyres in thousands 
Expel the souls of endless dead 

Devolved to beasts and hounds of war 
They rip and tear asunder 
Pain becomes their exaltation 
Penitence and thunder 

Taint the skies with murder! 
Hear curses cast with dying breath! 

Silent reek of mass impalement 
Harvesters are swarmed 
Monuments of carrion burden poisoned earth 
No victor lies among them 

Purify with death! 

Pray to war... Cold Submission 
Pray to war... The New Religion
