Fall beneath the glistening sun, on starving earth they shatter 
The spires of an age of gold return to crumbling matter 
Cities of bejewelled splendour, bleak and white as bone 
The symbols of their dominance today are overthrown 

Spires... Ashes! 
Reduced to earth and stone 
Spires... Ashes! 
The winds of change have blown 

Banners raise in thousands, the mountains call our name 
The rivers part before us as the forests rise in flames 
Pillars shake and tremble to the rhythm of our feet 
Their lands will fear our armies and their waters fear our fleet 

Fall beneath the glistening sun on starving earth they shatter 
The spires of an age of gold return to crumbling matter 
That once they lived in greatness comes to nothing in our eyes 
From the bodies of the fallen greater days shall come to rise... 

Cast our eyes towards the east in greater dreams of power 
Oracles sing devastation, nearer comes the hour 
Their pyramids will topple, shattered skies above the loom 
As empires turn to nothing, cry in god-forsaken doom! 

Banners raise in thousands, the mountains call our name 
The rivers part before us as the forest rise in flames 
Pillars shake and tremble to the rhythm of our feet 
Their lands will fear our armies and their waters fear our fleet
