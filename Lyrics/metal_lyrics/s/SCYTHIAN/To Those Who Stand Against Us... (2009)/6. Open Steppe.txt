Alone I stand before you 
O father of the sky 
The open steppe beneath my feet 
As far as falcons flyâ¦ 

Come hear my savage spirit 
Echo past the unmarked graves 
Of those who stand against us 
Of those, who sought to make us slavesâ¦ 

To youâ¦ 
I prayâ¦ 

March onward whores of Persia 
You will never tame this landâ¦ 
You are blind in my dominionâ¦ 
You are insects to my hand. 

Fly, like fearful avians 
Hide in the folds of the earth like vermin 
Submerge beneath the waves you think to command 
Or fall beneath our arrows. 

Hear me coward emperor: 
I will never march to the crack of your whipâ¦ 
My armies will bleed the ranks of your invincible columns 
I will drink from the clefts of your departed head! 

I will punish you 
As you sought to punish me 
Your noble bones will kindle my fire 
As your soldiers kneel in shame. 

Our might is the crushing fist of the gods 
Our rush is the frozen wind of open plains 
Hear your sycophantic prophets 
chant your annihilation. Your fate is written.
