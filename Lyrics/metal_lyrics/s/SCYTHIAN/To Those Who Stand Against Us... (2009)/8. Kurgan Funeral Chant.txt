I return from whence I came 
My body, withered and wrecked 
I feed the earth with my ruin 
my soul becomes a restless entity 

Lay me within my barrow tomb 
And heap my spoils around me 
Slaughter my horses and bury their reins 
So I may ride on glorious shores beyond... 

Send me to meet with my fathers 
And clash with Zopyrion's arms 
to riddle with Agni and watch over men 

Earthen roots consume the fallen 
Our bodies rot, our weapons rust 
Dirge of Hades, howl agony and tears of flame 
Tables set for the glorious banquet of the slain. 

Gaze afar, gaze beyond, 
Into unbound horizons ride! 

Darkened skies branch anew with rising dawn 
Unmade our essence soars to clouded realms 
Fated to be cleansed by feral streams 

Our purposeless being, 
The vision of fools 
The sins of our fathers 
Deposed was our rule 

I sing the funeral chant of my kin, 
In the endless wake of our battles, did we win? 
We sent the weak to the ground 
In the endless wake out our battles, what was found? 

Our Purposeless being, the vision of fools 
Our efforts for nothing, 
The threads of life beginâ¦ to fray 

Hear my final words, for everything returns to nothing. 
Gone, the jewelled spires of splendid cities, 
The victories of invincible armies, 
Gone 

The hordes of earthly kings, their names pass to legend, gone 
Our conquests are forgotten, 
I am the voice of unbecoming 
I dwell without end or remembrance, 

Until ...
