Curse them! Suromatae, 
Pitiless slaughterers 
Routed we stand 
At the edge of oblivion 

Ares - Bringer of death 
Warlord, God of our ancient enemy 
Send your fiery hosts to visit 
Death upon our foe 

Ares... Guide my blade to terrible victory! 
Ares... Send my arrows to pierce their hearts! 

Fearless, we face our end 
With cold indifference 
Mounted, two bodies one  
We kill in harmony 

Flay them! 
Cast their bodies to wingÃ©d predators, earthly scavengers 
Take their heads and mount them 
In the splendour of your hall 

Ares... Guide my blade to terrible victory! 
Ares... Send my arrows to pierce their hearts! 

Leave regrets behind me, 
Travel with the wind, 
My enemies surround me... 
With final words I cry: 
To those who stand against me 
Iâll return to ash and dust! 
Come lead your bastard herd to die 
In mercy do I trust! 

Lift our bows towards the Gods 
We care not if we die! 
Hades fills with weaker men 
Our killing blows did send... 
Cohorts here are gathered 
In gold and shimmering scale 
Our enemies before us 
Their slanted faces cold and pale 

Earth! Swallow them before us 
Sky! Make our serpents fly 
War! Grant their army malediction 
Falcons! Take us skyward as we fall 

Ares... Guide my blade to terrible victory 
Ares... Grant them misery, hell for eternity 
Ares... Send my arrows to pierce their hearts
