Worthless slaves, lick at yours conqueror's heels 
Chained, shackled... march in sorry procession 
Mercy forsaken, laugh at your pride in tatters 
Suffering to the conquered, death for the weak! 

Cries of your women riddle the burning air 
Starving dogs devour you as you bleed 
What gods will deliver you from your pointless existence? 
Suffering to the conquered, death for the weak! 

Tyrants, your sins shall never be forgiven 
Hear the call to insurrection sound 
Envenomed blades shall rip into your backs 
Cruellest death shall visit on your sons 

Lords, makers, prayers fall silent 
Scourge, plague, hunger and blackest defeat 
Thousands strong, ride from distant horizon... 

Obey! Drones in columns, hundreds deep 
Crack on whips of oppression! Tear the spirit from these men! 
Toil! In earthly forges work until your end! 
Pray to funeral gods for mercy, quick and painless death! 

Earth and water: life in total submission 
Dynasties shall spit upon your crude and weakling breed! 
Rule of iron! Feed our armies with your children 
Perish for our greatness, throw your meaningless lives away! 

Dirges sing for the nameless 
We who are erased 
Save our honour 
Spit in the face of the victor 

From empty steppe 
They came to curse our lives 
Blood spilling reavers 
To burn our homes and take our wives 

Obey! Drones in columns, hundreds deep 
Crack on whips of oppression! Tear the spirit from these men 
Toil! In earthly forges work until your end! 
Pray to funeral gods for mercy, quick and painless death! 

Tyrants, your sins shall never be forgiven 
Hear the call to insurrection sound 
Envenomed blades shall rip into your backs 
Cruellest death shall visit on your sons 

Lords, makers, prayers fall silent 
Scourge, plague, hunger and blackest defeat 
Thousand strong, ride from distant horizon 

Bringing Scythian Death
