Mantle of imperium, come fall into my hands 
With terror and oppression I will pacify the lands 
The overthrown lie far below, Impenetrable tomb 
Idols of their godhood heaped in pyramids of ruin 

Cohorts gather! Billions heed my call 
For power everlasting I would sacrifice them all 
Countless numbers, banners hold my name 
The thunder of a thousand hooves is herald to your end 

Deified, cry out below: exalt my hated name 
Like refuse of the ages, I have cast you to the flame 
To those who stand against me I'll return to ash and dust 
Forbidden knowledge, entropy, come... fuel my power lust! 

Master! God King! 
Bestow us with riches and spoils of war 
Rise! Conquer! 
Put our enemies to the sword 

Let fly arrows! 
Shimmering death obscures the sun 
Rush them! Trample! 
Cities are razed to the dust 

Murder their prophets, Effigies slashed 
Idols beheaded... Altars are smashed
