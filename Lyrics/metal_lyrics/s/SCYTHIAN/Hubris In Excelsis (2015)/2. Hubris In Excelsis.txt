The ruling filth comes crashing down 
Perpetual vengeance in false wisdom found 

Hubris: Nemesis 
In the throes of power lust 
Hubris: Nemesis 
Into the depths of Hades thrust 

Upon the grave of a Demigod 
who dared beyond his boundaries fare 
Divine tragedy 
Tears of gods begot 
Yet the death of billions at once forgot 

His chariot in flames 
Son of Gods deceased 
A continent in ash shall witness his fall 

[Solo: von Moller]
