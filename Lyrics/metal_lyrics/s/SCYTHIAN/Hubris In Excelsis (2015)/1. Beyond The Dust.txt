[Solo: von Moller] 

Effluent fumes infiltrate perception 
Blinded eyes with flickered reception 
An incessant haze of mass decay 
Abandoned is the fray 
Devouring souls and convictions alike 
Stripped of honour and our ancient pride 
Soon lost: the foremost divination 
In Original sin - a fanatic's citation! 

Somnambulism reigns 
Regression is now complete 
Civilisation crumbles 
Equal are leper and priest 

Prophecies of deliverance - Logic to the mad 
The dust; It feasts upon their judgment 
Ambassadors of pertinence beckon to the frail 
Descent into the quarters of the damned 
Those condemned unto the dust 
Those condemned by the dustâ¦ 

And yet we call upon tomorrow 
To rise beyond the dustâ¦ 
The dust! 

Imposters infiltrate our ranks 
Obscured by the consequence of fate 
An inexorable force upon the psyche 
As the borders between sentience and deathâ¦ 
blurâ¦ fadeâ¦ vanishâ¦ die! 

In genocide and sorrowâ¦ 
To ascend beyond the dustâ¦ 
The dust! 

[Solo: von Moller] 

In our final hour, acolytes of death 
The dust our master... master's wrath divine 

[Solo: von Moller] 

With dying infant in hand and laboured breath 
Forgotten is the wisdom of our timeâ¦
