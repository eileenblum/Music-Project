[Solo: Iron] 

Parasite blood consumes 
last hectares of fertile land 
History halts to a standstill 
Its tides dead as death itself 

Elders perish, offspring falters 
Bloodlines break in thousands 
Forgotten victims of an unclaimed, nameless epoch 
The longest wait endures 

Religions die, preaching wanes 
No solutions the scriptures hold 
Few yet fly banners of yore 
Herald a vision they never saw 
And never witnessed 

Architects of metropolis past 
Of lethal reactors fuelled by death 
Sacrifice shaped into fortunes of the few 
Until the engine blew 

Pyres of stillborn ancestry warm the night 
The longest wait outlives us all! 

The reek of hypocrisy hangs heavy in the air 
Its venom invades our lungs 
Such welcome cleansing essence; it purifies our souls 
In its wisdom it teaches us 

Venture not to challenge the state of affairs 
Thereâs nothing left to salvage out there 
Just fire, death, and ash 
With prayers fill thy being 
Extinction eclipsed 

[Solo: Iron] 

Now go forth; shine my scion 
Deformed, oblivious child 
Inherit the world for your possession 
Our bane is now thine 

Reanimate this bleak faÃ§ade 
Spoiled with defunct gears 
May this closing act of man be worthy of Remembrance!
