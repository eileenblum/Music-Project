[Solo: von Moller] 

Blazing, spiralling smoke 
Turrets pierce the sky 
Into naught they were dissolved 
Beyond the needleâs eye 
Falling remnants cut the earth 
A mocking farewell 
Choking grip of circumstance 
None to sound the brazen knell 

Hurled thus into the void 
The foulest order of man 
Those prospered few by cosmic justice 
Stripped of this authority 
How do we proceed? 

Now climb through the scorching mist 
False truths in dying embers lie 
Their histories, their travesties 
Leave no page unburned! 

A globing sphere 
Unique, now free of purpose 
Gazes drop in loss as their exodus fails 
Castaways with no redeemers 
Captives of this toxic rock 
To extinction by its masters condemned... was our flock 

Transform we shall this hell 
In their image it was wrought 
From depths of doom to greater days 
Terra shall be brought 
We acclaim their curtain call 
And applaud this timely leave 
Inheritors are we! 

[Solo: Vrath] 

From their desertion reborn is our spirit 
Freed of phantom chains 
Slain lies Mammon at Mercuryâs flank 
Their poison tongues are cut 
The words are ground to dust 

Samarithropia! Our nouveau utopia 
In screaming terror shine in this new-born dystopia 

Great usurper! Salute the slaves! 
False truths in flames they dance 
Our histories, our travesties 
Leave no word unwrittenâ¦
