A rising sun illumes our endemic ruin 
Unravelled suspicions 
Apocalyptic Visions 

A mounting horde appeals against the naked milieu 
Truthâs bitter pill 
Clad in power... ourselves we shall kill 

Submerged in the darkness 
Cursed by Helios 

Collapsing skies 
Tales of cause and consequence 
Obsolete ammunitions now rust past recognition 
A drowning sun blows out the Terran candle dead 
No final petitions, justâ¦ Apocalyptic Visions 

[Solo: von Moller] 

Blame spreads akin wildfire 
Shifting riots within our ranks 
Turns brother into liar 
Paranoia cooks 

Artillery replaces faithful words 
Deceitful traitors 
Betrayers from birth 
Bitter be your end! 
[Solo: Iron] 

[Solo: von Moller] 

A rising sun unveils the darkness of this earth 
Outdated premonitions 
Only a sightless dying age
