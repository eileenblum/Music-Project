Clinging to the scriptures 
Bestowed divine authority 
The earth in flames beneath thy feet 
With the ashes of their sin replete 
Their feeble minds too weak to grasp 
Their fading souls at final gasp 
In tragedy fury is born 
Dethrone the seed of hope forlorn 

In hope forlornâ¦ come the children of celestial scorn! 

Release us from our spurious bond 
Deliver us to a life beyond 
An end to this immortal sanctum 
Awaken us from delirium 

As tyrants feast... at the world's crest 
All hail to us! The cross oppressed 

They falter, they succumb; into dominance they fall 
An unconquerable hurdle under which no man can crawl 
No quarter will be given and no mercy shall be sought 
For an age devoid of empathy a new reality has been wrought 

We'll suffer no resistance 
From the dregs of human existence 
Adorn them, gift them with chains 
As slaves they were born - they remain! 

They falter, they succumb; under butchery they fall 
An unconquerable fervour in the justice of the maul 
No quarter will be given and no mercy shall be sought 
For an age devoid of empathy, a new reality has been wrought 

[Solo: von Moller] 

Destroy the past to dominate the future 
Restore the Gods to satisfy the weak 
A cautionary truth for an apocryphal order 
A paradox repeats in the saga of imperishable slaughter
