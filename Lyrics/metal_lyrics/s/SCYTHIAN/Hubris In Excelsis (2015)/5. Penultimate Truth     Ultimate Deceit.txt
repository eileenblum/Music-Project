Mankind in concrete buried 
Enslavement underground 
For centuries forgotten 
Mechanization-bound 

Terra's surface healed 
The warâs expired past 
Resurrected, thriving fields 
The fruit of greed aghast 

The penultimate truthâ¦ A lie! 

Despotic victors reign supreme 
To keep synthetic dreamsâ¦ alive 
A murderous regime to guarantee 
Ersatz equality for all... to survive 

[Solo: von Moller] 

Subterrestrial masses fed by demagogues above 
With tales of deadly gases 
Nothing left of the world beloved 
Isolated lands, forsaken cities 
In the gaze of palaces and covetous committees 

Now rise, now rise! Let the sun blind your eyes 
Escape from your caskets and cells 
Gamble your lives, unveil their crooked disguise 
Revolt! Arise! Arise! 

Bring us the heads of their prophets 
Serve us their spirits in tatters 

The ultimate deceit 
Their banishment complete 
To vengeance and to terror 
The price of human error 

Bring us the heads of their prophets 
Settle our debts with their blood
