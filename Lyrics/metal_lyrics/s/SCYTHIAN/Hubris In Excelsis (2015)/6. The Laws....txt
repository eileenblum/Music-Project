[Excerpt from âDinosauria, Weâ by Charles Bukowski recited by S. Vrath] 

Serpents of the Gods call upon your hypocrites 
Pray to the fates and the master of the odds 
Cry out in ruinous shouts; your end is near! 

From your defecated thrones we have feasted on your bones 
To mark your pitiful end 
Oh lords of mockery, clamour and shout! 

Master of the Odds, 
Your long unquestioned authority fades to obscurity 
Your servants led to the flame, your name is ground to the dust! 

We hold the spear of destiny 
Cursed with the thirst of a never-ending deicidal lust 
We hunger for your sacrificial blood! 

Your ruinous corpses draped in red 
You speak your names to the keeper of the dead 
O spirits of murder, vengeance, agony 
Howl out in glorious victory... and scream these words aloud! 

The laws of Gods and men are nothing... 
We are the lions of the east! 
The sons of blasphemy around us... 
Your hated relics at our feet 

[Solo: Iron] 
[Solo: von Moller] 

Heed us, kings and high pretenders 
This song written in your name 
Forgotten are your teachings 
Ashen are your houses 
Unrivalled is your shame 

Die! Serpents of the Gods 
Die! Master of the odds 
Die! Your time is over â your end is near
