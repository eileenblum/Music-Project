Punch drunk, dangerous
Cold-hearted retribution
Veins pumping gasoline
No mercy on your bleeding soul
Steal my soul

Psychotic symphony
Her twisted revolution
She loves to watch you die
One flick of the wrist, you go
Now you go

Wastin' time
Lost in oblivion
I'm leaving tomorrow
Burned and blind
Drowned in delirium
I'm falling and fading again
Lost in oblivion!

Bloodshot, crucified
On the wicked side of heaven
Sedated from the lies
She'll torture you for her own game
Her own game

Oh, fatal and dignified
Her curse is your conviction
Insanity and lust
She's coming out to take you away
Far away

Wastin' time
Lost in oblivion
I'm leaving tomorrow
Burned and blind
Drowned in delirium
I'm falling and fading again

Wastin' time
Lost in oblivion
I'm leaving tomorrow
Burned and blind
Drowned in delirium
I'm falling and fading again

I'm lost in oblivion
I'm falling and fading again, again, again, again
Lost in oblivion!
