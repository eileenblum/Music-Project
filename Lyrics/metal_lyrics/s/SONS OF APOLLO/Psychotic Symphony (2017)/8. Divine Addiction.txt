There's a time and a place for it all
Inside and under
Push and pull with your back to the wall
Sinner's design and call, hey yeah

Take a piece of my body and mind
Don't stop to wonder
Through my fingers you'll feel and you'll find

It's my divine addiction
It's all coming your way
Like a blind affliction
This game of lies you know it's beggin' you
Beggin' you to stay

Take a ride through my carnal parade
Tell me, how are you feelin'?
Feel the burn as your body conveys

You're my divine addiction
It's all coming your way
It's like a blind affliction
This game of lies you know it's beggin' you
Beggin' you to stay, hey

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You're my divine addiction
It's like a blind affliction
This game of lies you know it's beggin' you
Beggin' you to stay

You're my divine addiction
Beggin' you, beggin' you to stay
You're my divine addiction
Beggin' you, beggin' you to stay
You're my divine addiction
Beggin' you, beggin' you to stay
You're my divine addiction
Beggin' you, beggin' you to stay
Beggin' you
