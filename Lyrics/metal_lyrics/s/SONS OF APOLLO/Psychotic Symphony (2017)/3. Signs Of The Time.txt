Beneath this poisoned rage
We dance upon the grave this night

This scarred humanity
We crave insanity this night

Yeah, yeah

Through this curtain call
We'll collide and fall
We're all victimized
And dehumanized

But we hold on
More than a miracle
We die for the praying
Hold on
The fight of our lives are signs of the time

Bleeding, we're gagged and bound
This new word terminates my soul, my soul

Choking the loaded gun
Looking inside your vertigo

Hey, yeah yeah yeah

Sipping cyanide
Bodies damnified
Too much time to hate
Re-evaluate

But we hold on
More than a miracle
We die for the praying
Hold on
The fight of our lives are signs of the time

If we hold on
Something has got to give
Now hear what I'm saying
Hold on
The fight of our lives are signs of the time

We hold on
More than a miracle
We die for the praying
Hold on
The fight of our lives are signs of the time

Hold on
Something has got to give
Now hear what I'm saying
Hold on
The fight of our lives are signs of the time
Signs of the time
