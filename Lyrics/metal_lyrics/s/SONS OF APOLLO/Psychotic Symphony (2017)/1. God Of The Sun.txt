Through desert, skies and far beyond the ocean
I am the star that shines eternal glow
Forever you'll know
A cold desire that's feelin' no emotion
I am the fire that burns inside your soul
I'm inside your soul

'Cuz I am the light
Surrender tonight
I am the face of tomorrow
Now I' ve just begun
You can't hide or run
'Cuz I am the God of the sun

I hear the prophet crying out for mercy
Don't lose the faith, I'll heal your wounds again
All over again
Oh, I feel your pain, the rage inside your fury
I see your madness coming to the end
It's over my friend

'Cuz I am the light
Surrender tonight
I am the face of tomorrow
Now I've just begun
You can't hide or run
'Cuz I am the god of the sun
'Cuz I am the god of the sun
'Cuz I am the god of the sun

Through the silence of the night
And beneath the afterglow
This illusion you invite
Fallen temptation
With desperation
You fall
Through wind and light, ya hear the muse is singing
A song of truth through all you claim to know
But you never know
So close your eyes to hear the words I'm bringing
Beyond the dream, you'll never be alone
You're never alone

'Cuz I am the light
Surrender tonight
I am the face of tomorrow
Now I've just begun
You can't hide or run
'Cuz I am the god of the sun
'Cuz I am the light
Surrender tonight
I am the face of tomorrow
Now I've just begun
You can't hide or run
'Cuz I am the god of the sun
'Cuz I am the god of the sun
