Stare at the walls
Pray for reflection
Try to recall
Beg for redemption
Lost amid the lines
Vie for salvation
Solace is mine
Doused in temptation
Now I'm on my way

I'm chirping away at my denial
With my innocence on trial
It's all the same an endless maze
With no tomorrow

I am detained behind the door
It's madness with no cure
I'm locked in chains, drowned in shame
No fear or sorrow

Cause it takes me in
And I can't let go
But I'll never win
In this Labyrinth

Finding my way into the light
By the darkness of the night
A path so clear, release my fear
No strengths to borrow

Cause it takes me in
And I can't let go
But I'll never win
In this Labyrinth

Shows no mercy, we're in denial
One more stage and we'll reconcile
Time stands still in this virtual land
There is no winning this losing hand

Spinning around, falling away
Losing my mind and pounding my brain
Take me down, turning to grey
Gotta get out, help me to escape

I need an answer now
Cuz I'm bound to lose my mind
I'm spinning around and around
But darkness is all I find

Spinning around, falling away
Losing my mind and pounding my brain
Taking me down, going insane
Get me out, get me out, help me to escape

Taking me down, I'm going insane
Get me out, get me out, help me to escape!

Cause it takes me in
And I can't let go
But I'll never win
In this Labyrinth
