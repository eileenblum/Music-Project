Cold shivers on my skin
Your declaration makes me sick
Hypocrisy has no limits
You've burned in hell
Ever since you were born
I don't blame you... I feel sorry for you

Chains of faith... After all... Turn into hate

Mortality and lies
Have let you to this point
Convincing yourself
You and your brainwashed mind
But inside you cry out for answers

Chains of faith... After all... Turn into hate

Time after time we indulge in sin
The ancient fables you follow
Time after time we indulge in sin
It's your sin
My pleasure

Chains of faith... Turn into hate

Don't believe yourself no more
But all you can do... Is to follow... Is to obey
Feeling used but being part of
Something bigger... A fucking lie

Chains of faith... After all... Turn into hate

Time after time we indulge in sin
The ancient fables you follow
Time after time we indulge in sin
It's your sin
My pleasure

Chains of faith... Turn into hate
