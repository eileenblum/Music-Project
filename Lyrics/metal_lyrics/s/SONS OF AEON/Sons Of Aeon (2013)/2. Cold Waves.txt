You're buried
Buried under a mask
No matter how hard I try
I can't reach you
A breathing statue
With an automatic smile
A beautiful building
With no foundation

What a fucking waste
Potential never released
This can't be all there is to give
This can't be all...

I can hear your words
But can't feel the warmth they convey
A running mind, frozen feet
This can't be all there is to give

What a fucking waste
Potential never released
This can't be all there is to give
This can't be all...

If I'll put some faith in you
Will you promise to do the same?
Learn to sail the storm
Through the coldest of waves
Without fading away
