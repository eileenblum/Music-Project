Another brick on top of the pile
It's getting too heavy already
To carry on your young shoulders
You know everything's not in its place
But you have no idea what it is
That is preventing you from
Rising to your own height

A vicious passed on burden
Too invisible to see,
Yet heavy enough to make you crawl
To take all beauty from life,
To steal all ambition

How could you know?
No one ever showed you any other way
No one ever encouraged you to shine
To be what you are and be it proudly
To not let anyone put you in any other mold
But the one you carry deep inside

Another brick on the top of the pile
It's getting too heavy already
To carry on your young shoulders
You know everything's not in it's place
But you have no idea what it is
That is preventing you from
Rising to your own height

A vicious passed on burden
Too invisible to see,
Yet heavy enough to make you crawl
To take all beauty from life,
To steal all ambition

Every night on your knees
Making a silent prayer to a god
that you don't even know
Wake up to another day to see
That everything is still the same

No more faked ambition
Time to put it all in its place
Anything else but hiding in shadows
Let them be you
