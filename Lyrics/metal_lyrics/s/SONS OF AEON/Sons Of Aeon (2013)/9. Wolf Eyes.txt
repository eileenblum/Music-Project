I'll just rest here for a while
It's still a long way
The water in this place
Repels the sunlight
Thick as blood,
The truth lies underneath the surface

Can you see through my wolf eyes,
Past the hate that protects from harm
Like lava,
Clouds seem to follow my every move
I want to give up, but I don't know how

Wish I knew what defines me
Wish I'd get just a fraction
Of what you have
Feel tired,
Find comfort in someone else's memories
This time I'll go all the way to the end

Can you see through my wolf eyes,
Past the hate that protects me from harm
Like lava,
Clouds seem to follow my every move
Wanted to give up, but I didn't know how

This song in my head
It's screaming for closure
Words adrift in my mouth
So many things undone
So many unloved

Don't wait for me
I think I'm better off here
In the city of infinity
