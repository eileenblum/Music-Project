Yes it was here I saw it rise
I saw it collapse
Devotion transformed into a burden
All too heavy for a man to bear
The collected wisdom
And the art of crawling
Vanished when we became strangers

Yes it was here I saw it collapse
I saw it rise again, in a new form
Fire, walk with me,
Don't hide but show me new home

The sand once so thick
Now slipping through my fingers
The wounds once scarred and healed
Now forever bleeding inside

Fire, walk with me
Don't hide but show me new home
Behold the quicksand, my brothers
Our strength was always
To find solid ground

The sand once so thick
Now slipping through my fingers
The wounds once scarred and healed
Now bleeding inside again

In this moment of confusion I wonder
Should I try once more
Would I fail once more

In this moment of final conclusion I wonder
Why don't I even care anymore
