Sight into the future... Does not exist
We need no prophets to realise it
Next breath you're about to take
Could be your last
Drown yourself in hatred, forget the past

This world of confusion
Where moral is just a word
Meaningless and forgotten...
Thing we should not talk about
Souls for sale
Dreams of yesterday... Drifting away

A glimpse of humanity... Does not exist
See the smile on their faces... You'll realise it

Filth holds the reins of power
Rivers are turning red
Irrigate the fields of hate
Sow the seeds of destruction
There will be blood... Where dead roses bloom
