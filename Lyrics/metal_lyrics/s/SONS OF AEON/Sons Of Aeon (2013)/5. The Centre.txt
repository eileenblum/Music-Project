The moment when all trying stops and failure ceases to exist
The moment you sing from the heart with no one to hear it
The moment you put down the guard and know you're safe
The moment you feel all pressure coming down with the tears

The moment when you dive through the layers of pain
To the place where all the questions disappear and all falls into place
