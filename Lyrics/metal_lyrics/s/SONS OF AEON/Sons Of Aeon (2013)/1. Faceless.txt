Keep it inside
All the shit that you've been through,
Just keep it inside

Anger and rage, love and disgrace
Never to be shown
There's no pain, you've had to be faceless
Since the day you were born

Don't let them out,
Emotions forbidden... No don't let them out
Just let them drown
Emotions overrated... Just let them drown

No thoughts
Thinking's forbidden since the day you were born
No talk
Life is overrated since the day you were born
Follow, obey and lie
Bend, collapse and die

Colourless and deadpan
A cog in the wheel
Part of the plan
Obey and kneel

Follow the line
And you'll become one... One with the mass
Stay in line

Just let it drown
Freedom's overrated... Just let it drown

Anger and rage, love and disgrace
Never to be shown
There's no pain, you've had to be faceless
Since the day you were born

Follow, obey and lie
Bend, collapse and die

Colourless and deadpan
A cog in the wheel
Part of the plan
Obey and kneel

Follow the line
And you'll become one... One with the mass
Stay in line
