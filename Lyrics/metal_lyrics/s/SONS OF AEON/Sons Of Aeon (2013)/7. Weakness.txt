Weakness...
Hiding in the shadows
When darkness has taken over your world
Weakness...
To blow out the candle
When flames of hell already burn your soul

Weakness... To raise your sword
When the enemy is already taken down
Sickness... To preach about
Something that you question yourself

You have got to the point of no return
Around you the world
Where everything's false
All those wasted years
Surrounding your meaningless life

Weakness...
To raise your fist
When you're not willing to die for it
Sickness...
Swear an oath
You've already drowning in your lies

You have got to the point of no return
Around you the world
Where everything's false
All those wasted years
Surrounding your meaningless life
