far off the distance I can hear the wind,
breaking the silence, it's calling for me.
out of the twilight I found a new heaven,
I will discover the places I'm looking for.

can you feel my loneliness, can you feel the pain ?
but I see the new life is growing up again.

I was living my dreams, I was too blind to see,
dying for love now it's over.
it's a long way to go and I'm walking alone,
through the gates of the second floor.

men in shadows are taking me higher,
rising together I'm losing my mind.
coming so close to the land where you're living,
I'll try to find you, I'll leave for you.

I was lost and lonely but now I've seen the light
and I feel a new love is leading me tonight.

I was living my dreams, I was too blind to see,
dying for love now it's over.
it's a long way to go and I'm walking alone,
through the gates of the second floor.

[The Hawk:]
the night come and go, wherever it flows,
someone is reaching for me, I believe.
so come here to me,
I will be waiting whatever will be.
