I talked to the wind, he said that I dream
I tried to get out but I didn't want to.
standing alone, feeling the pain,
drying the tears in my eyes.

I talked to the time, he said "don't you cry",
I tried to be free living my life.
looking for you, telling me lies,
but I can't hear your voice.

tell me tales, I don't want to hear the silence,
stay with me 'cause I want to feel your love.
talk to me, I don't want to be so lonely,
cry for me and I won't be forgotten.

I talked to the sky, he said that I die,
I talked to the rain, I talked to the night.
I know that I must wait for a while
and you'll make me feel fine.

I'm waiting for a time to come,
I know you're gonna take me home,
tomorrow you will break the wall
to lead me out of this black hole.
I'm waiting for the time to leave,
I know you're gonna set me free,
tomorrow you will stay with me
and I will find my rest and peace.

I talked to the sea, sound in my hears,
I tried to wake up but I'm sleeping so well.
I talked to the dark lady you are,
heal me, the sorrow I'm feeling.
