[Dame:]
I know you're living tomorrow my lord
but you won't listen to my words.
your will is harder and stronger enough
and you will conquer the world.

[Lord:]
lost in the dark and the fear,
lying away from my dreams,
I'm gonna live anyway,
I won't be playing this game.

[Dame:]
love is breaking my heart,
don't want to lose you.
love is fading away,
maybe I'm going blind.

[Dame:]
I know it's hard to believe it my lord,
I see destruction and fire.
so many creatures waiting for you,
my lord if you only knew.

[Lord:]
love is turning me down
searching for answers.
love is dead in my heart,
I'll keep on telling lies.
