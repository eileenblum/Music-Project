lonely feeling in my heart,
living night and day,
I don't want to let you fade away.
little flower in the sun,
do you need some love ?
I don't want to leave you now alone.

the road to dreamland was so easy,
my will to live was getting weaker,
I knew it couldn't go on forever
but the best days were coming closer.

I'm lost in December days,
my time is over now.
I'm lost in December days,
my time is over now.

[The Hawk:]
now it's getting dark again,
it's a rainy day,
I could never try to fly away.
