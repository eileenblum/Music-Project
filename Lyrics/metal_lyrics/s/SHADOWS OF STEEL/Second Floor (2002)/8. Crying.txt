I saw you crying,
lost in the field,
I saw you crying.

I remember what you said
and the promise that we made,
never understand.
you were living in my dreams,
you were dying on your knees,
crying just for me.

I saw you crying...

I remember what you said
and the promise that we made,
never understand.
you were living in my dreams,
you were dying on your knees,
crying just for me.

no, I feel it's over,
no, I know the truth.
now that you're gone so far
I'm looking back.
no, I feel so lonely,
waiting for you.
it's just a fantasy,
there's no return.

I remember what you said
and the promise that we made,
never understand.
you were living in my dreams,
you were dying on your knees,
crying just for me.
