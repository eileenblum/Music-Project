look in to my eyes,
I could never deny, I'm a sinner.
don't you ever cry
when you're in for the light,
in the darkness.
I remember now
when you stayed on my side,
in the shadow.
I would never have to let you go.

[The Hawk:]
I will come back tomorrow,
fly away and rise again.

distant voices,
I hear they're calling for me,
closer to my heart,
I hear they're calling for me.

when you left me here,
I refuged in my world, I was dying.
paying for my sins and
the bill was too high, going nowhere.
now you're getting near,
I'll be waiting for keeps, not forever.
I would never have to let you go.

all right, I wish you all the best,
goodbye and live your life.
fly away and rise again.

distant voices,
I hear they're calling for me,
closer to my heart,
I hear they're calling for me.
