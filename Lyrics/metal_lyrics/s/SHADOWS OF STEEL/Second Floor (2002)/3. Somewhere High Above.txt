I take a look to the sky,
I turn around with my eyes.
I gaze the moon and the stars,
shining like diamonds, I'm still so far.

crying, I stand alone, trying to
understand a different world.
walking on through that door,
gate of heaven, somewhere high above.

I hear the sound in my hear,
I see the rage of the sea,
I realize it's a dream,
tonight I think I will make it real.

crying, I stand alone, trying to
understand a different world.
walking on through that door,
gate of heaven, somewhere high above.

now I believe I hold the power,
a secret deep inside my soul
and I remember days of glory,
I will come back and give you love.

I don't know where I'm from,
I don't know what I'm looking for,
my days are growing cold,
living so far away from home.

crying, I stand alone, trying to
understand a different world.
walking on through that door,
gate of heaven, somewhere high above.
