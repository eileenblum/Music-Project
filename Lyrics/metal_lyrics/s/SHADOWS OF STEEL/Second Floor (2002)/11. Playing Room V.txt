[Shadow:]
Open your eyes I'm the king of the island
I live between dark and moonlight
I'm made of shadows and this is my kingdom
I'm the lord of the windows
I want to know why you're looking for answers
See the pictures are changing
I know you're coming to conquer the secret
I'm waiting over the land

[Man:]
Tell me where is my time
Lead me under your sign
Tell me where is my time
Lead me under your sign

[Shadow:]
This is you and I see

[Man:]
I believe, I believe

[Shadow:]
There's a light on your way
Be welcome in the room to play

[Man:]
The wind is crying over the sky
Calling the season of twilight
I want to know why the reasons are falling
I feel the shadows are growing

[Shadow:]
Over and over you will know the secret and
You will break in the kingdom
I know tomorrow you will burn away
I'm waiting for you today

[Man:]
Tell me where is my time
Lead me under your sign
Tell me where is my time
Lead me under your sign

[Solo: Steve/Andrew/Olaf /Andrew/Olaf/Andrew/Andre]

[Man:]
How many changes, I know the secret
I see the pictures, how many stories untold
A dawn of winter, I play with myself
I'll close the window, there's no tomorrow for me

Will I find the key to go
Through the gates of a new world
Many ways, so many doors
I won't knock on everyone

[Man:]
Tell me where is my time
Lead me under your sign
Tell me where is my time
Lead me under your sign
