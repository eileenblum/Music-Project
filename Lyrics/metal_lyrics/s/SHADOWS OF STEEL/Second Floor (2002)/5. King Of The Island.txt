the time has come to find the truth,
in the name of god,
my will is stronger than before.
the night is falling on the ruin,
will I ever know ?
why did I see it all before.

[The Past:]
no one answers, seems the end
but I feel out there's a friend.
when I close my eyes, I dream my life,
I was the king of the night.
I realize I lost my mind, now it's too late.

the night has come from far away,
living on my side,
I was the one who gave his life.
the blood is flowing down on me,
now I know there was a kingdom
in this land.

[The Past:]
he's an angel, he's a ghost,
turn away but now he's lost.

I leave tonight to follow my way
and find a reason to stay.
I believe in time will turn away,
vengeance is mine.

when I close my eyes, I dream my life,
king of the island tonight.
I believe in time will turn away,
vengeance is mine.
