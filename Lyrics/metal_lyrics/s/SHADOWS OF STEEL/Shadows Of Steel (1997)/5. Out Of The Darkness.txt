[Solo: Andrew]
I was coming out
Out of the darkness
When I woke up my dream began
Always looking for another world
Until I find a reason to stay
Shadows dancing near a little light
Love was coming back for you and I
I said:
Look in my eyes and I'll make you smile
Tell you stories 'bout the other side
[Solo: Andrew]
You were singing stories I told you
It became my reason to live
Always dancing
So many children
When I woke up it was just the end
Shadows dancing near a little light
Love was running far from you and I
You said:
Tell me another story, make me smile
I'm your gypsy, our love can't survive
[Solo: Andrew]
Many days are flowing, many tears are raining
Now the room is empty and the lies are fading
I can hear you're calling, now you're lonely, baby
Now the man is waiting and the journey's ending
There's an island on the edge
Shadows dancing near a little light
Love is fading to the blackest night
Now I'm learning there's a reason why
Shadows dancing near a little light
