[Solo: Andre La Fisic]
You're a dream of years ago, just the only one
I was living for the sun 'til you broke our love
Only shadows on the wall, I can't believe it all
Still I'm waiting for your call but the hawk has flown
Now I'm living for the night, will I never know
If you're trying to recall, tell me why you're gone
My tears are falling
Gone with the wind
You'll never fly with me
[Solo: Andrew/Andre]
Dreams are rising to the sun of my life
Silver heroes fly
Riding to that land we shall arise
[Solo: Andrew Mc Pauls]
Stand in front the man is waiting
Stand in front the mask is falling
No, you can't be real, you're nor a part of me
Stand in front the man is waiting
Stand in front the mask is falling
No, you can't be me, you can't be me
[Solo: Steve/Andre/Steve/Andre/Andrew]
Will I live or will I die
[Solo: Andrew/Andre]
Alright, I'll die
Echoes in the sky
[Solo: Wild Steel]
Dreams are rising to the sun of my life
Silver heroes fly
Riding to that land we shall arise
