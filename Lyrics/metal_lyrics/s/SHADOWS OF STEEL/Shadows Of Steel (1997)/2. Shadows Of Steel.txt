In the night I want to fly
Out of the abyss of my mind
No I don't know why
My dream is over the sky
Shadows of Steel, creatures of time
Out of my mind there is a light
Shadows of Steel, pictures of life
I will be free when I will die
[Solo: Vic]
Shadows of steel
Shadows of Steel
Life is like a stream
Shadows of steel
Shadows of Steel
Come in to my dream
[Solo: Olaf]
