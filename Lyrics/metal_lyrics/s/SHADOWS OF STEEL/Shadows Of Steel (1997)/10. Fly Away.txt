Fly away, rise again
Fly away, soon or late
Fly away, play your shadow
Smash the windows, fly away
Many voices, many faces
Many questions with no answers
Many windows with no pictures
Many doors are open
Now
I know the castles are burning
Heaven's waiting
I know the seasons are changing
Changing, changing
[Solo: Andrew/Steve/Andre]
I know it's easier to hide myself
There in the corner of my room but
I can try again to look outside and
I can dream to fly away
[Solo: Andrew/Gianca]
Many stairways, many bridges
Many starlights all around me
Many rooms I will no visit
Now the story's over
No
I know the castles are burning
Heaven's waiting
I know the seasons are changing
[Solo: Andre/Andrew]
