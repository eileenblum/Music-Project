[Solo: Olaf]
I am leaving tonight
Darkness and light
I can see my way
Now I feel it's alright
Can't understand
All the cries in their eyes
There's a place nobody knows and
I'm leaving to be there
Lying down on the sand of an island
I saw long time ago
It's a journey through the night and
I see my time is passing by
Dreams are still alive
I'll surrender to that magic sign
[Solo: Olaf]
Am I traveling time
I'll never go back
I'll never return
I can live on my own
I want to fly away from the night
I'll be coming back to the past and
I want to be free
Freedom is all that I need but
I can't get enough in my own world
It's a journey through the night and
I see my time is passing by
Dreams are still alive
I'll surrender to that magic sign
[Solo: Olaf/Andrew]
It's a journey through the night and
I see my time is passing by
Dreams are still alive
I'll surrender to that magic sign
