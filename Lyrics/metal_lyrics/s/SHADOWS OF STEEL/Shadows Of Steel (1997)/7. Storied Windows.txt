[Solo: Steve/Olaf/Andrew]
When I was younger, how many times
I looked up to the sky from the windows of my room
How many times I would have pictured
That windows with colours and stories I liked
In my world there are always been
Things no one never have seen
Now its time to break the seal
Now I long to be free and
I'm painting the stories I want to read
By the end of my dream
Will the pictures appear as I want to see
[Solo: Andrew]
Now I realize all the colours are waiting to fly
Galleries of mind
Finally the pictures will shine on the fortress
Splendour and majesty
It's a fortress of playing rooms
Someone will show me the truth
Now it's time to turn the key
Now I long to be free and
I'm waiting for someone to fly away
Through the windows I see
There's the world of my dreams
I will turn the key
[Solo: Andrew/Olaf/Andrew/Olaf/Andrew]
Now I long to be free and
I'm painting the stories I want to read
By the end of my dream
Will the pictures appear as I want to see
Now I long to be free and
I'm waiting for someone to fly away
Through the windows I see
There's the world of my dreams
I will turn the key
