It's another day as lions
I will find a way back to my world
I want to leave the island
I'm gonna keep on trying
Until I will break into your life
Tonight I will remember
We could have been together
I'm paying for the sins I made
Voices in the night keep me telling lies
Faces in the shade keep on watching me
It's another day as lions
I want to leave the island
I'm gonna keep on trying
Until I will break into your life
Tonight I will remember
We could have been together
I'm paying for the sings I made
I remember when I started
Dreaming about out future
Living our lives in danger
It was just a long time
Since I woke up and I found you
There in that garden we made our promises
Stay friends forever
[Solo: Andrew/Andre]
I'll be there, where my heart is
I'll be back maybe someday
Why did I lose, why did I go wrong
I want to leave the island ...
[Chorus: Andrew/Olaf]
