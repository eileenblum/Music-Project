Shadows of a lonely night
Hear my cry I come back to life
Wings arise and heroes fly
I can see the light of another day
How many days have gone
I'll take a sweet revenge
The power is in my hand
Winds of fire
Now the clouds are burning and
The kingdom falls
I'm the one
Now the wheels are turning and
The shadows rise
Shooting stars, a silver shine
Fading visions of a distant paradise
Many faces in my mind
Pictures of the past, I'll never forget
How many tears have flown
I start a masquerade
You will remember my name
Winds of fire
Now the clouds are burning and
The kingdom falls
I'm the one
Now the wheels are turning and
The shadows rise
[Solo: Andrew/Olaf]
[Dream:]
I am your leader
I'm gonna take you higher
I'm not a loser and I am not a liar
I am your leader
I keep your fire burning
I'm your tomorrow
My sun is always shining
[Reality:]
I am so little
I'm gonna leave you someday
My god is waiting
I'm not alone
[Solo: Olaf Thorsen]
Winds of fire
Now the clouds are burning and
The kingdom falls
I'm the one
Now the wheels are turning and
The shadows rise
Winds of fire
Now the clouds are burning and
The kingdom falls
I'm the one
Now the wheels are turning and
The shadows rise
