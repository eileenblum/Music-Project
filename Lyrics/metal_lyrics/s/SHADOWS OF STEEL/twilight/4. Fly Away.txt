[Heroes:]
Fly away, rise again
Fly away, soon or late
Fly away, play your Shadow
Smash the windows
Fly away...

[The Lion:]
Many voices, many faces
Many questions with no answers
Many windows with no pictures
Many doors are open now
I know the castles are burning
Burning, burning
I know the seasons are changing
Changing, changing
I know it's easier to hide myself
There in the corner of my room
But I can try again to look outside
And I can dream to fly away
Many stairways, many bridges
Many starlight's all around me
There's a room I will no visit
Now the story's over
I know the castles are burning
Burning, burning
I know the seasons are changing
Changing, changing
