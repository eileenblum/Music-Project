[Flute:]
He's crying alone
In to the night
Feeling so cold

[The Hawk:]
I was dreaming with my mind, you were on my side
Now you're gone and days are passing by
Please save me, don't leave me
So take me, I need your love

[The Lion:]
I don't know why Heroes are falling
And there's no time to say Goodbye
I see the flames are burning down to your land
Burning for evermore

[The Lion:]
Can you feel, I send you whispers in your dream
Can you feel...

[The Hawk:]
Now the time has come to pay, I will fade away
And I know it's just another tale
Don't save me, now leave me
Don't take me, I need to go

[The Hawk:]
I want to fly, Eagles are rising
And there's no time to say Goodbye
I see the light, Shadows are fading away
I hear you're calling

[The Lion:]
I don't know why Heroes are falling
And there's no time to say Goodbye
I see the flames are burning down to your land
Burning for evermore
