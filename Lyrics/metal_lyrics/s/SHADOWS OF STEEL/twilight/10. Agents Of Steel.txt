[Agent Steel cover]

Back in the days we first sighted
Their shields gleaming bright in the sky
The light that was brighter than fire
Forced cowards to run out of spite

Masters of metal, agents of steel
Masters of metal, agents of steel
Masters of metal, agents of steel
Masters of metal, agents of steel

Feel the day getting closer
They'll return for the masses to see
I shed a tear when they left us
My heart now bleeds for their coming

Masters of metal, agents of steel
Masters of metal, agents of steel
Masters of metal, agents of steel
Masters of metal, agents of steel

The signs prepare for their coming
Now you know that it's clear
You know that we'll be returning
Once more, but not for too long

Masters of metal, agents of steel
Masters of metal, agents of steel
Masters of metal, agents of steel
Masters of metal, agents of steel
