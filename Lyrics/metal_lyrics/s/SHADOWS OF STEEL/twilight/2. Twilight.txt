[The Lion:]
There was a time when I saw the light
I made a dream and I found a way
I don't remember, I'll never know
Why did I want to open that door
I was lost in the Shadows, oh no
I was lost in the Twilight of my world
No, I don't know why
I walked away so many miles
Deep in my soul I was calling your name
Crying alone I was losing my friends
I found myself down on my knees
I know the end was coming near
I was lost in the Shadows, oh no
I was lost in the Twilight of my world
I was lost in the Shadows, oh no
I was lost in the Twilight, oh no
I was lost in the Shadows, oh no
I was lost in the Twilight of my world
