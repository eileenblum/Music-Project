[The Hawk:]
So far away, deep in the night
I feel the spirits around me
How many times they'll try to take me
And I will fly to the day

[The Lion:]
Now the wind is blowing telling tales of winter
I know the feeling, will you keep me warm
Many leaves are falling and the time is waiting
Slow down lonely, the light is fading

[The Hawk:]
I know, my wings are broken
I know, I will be falling
I pray, my time has come to the end
And there's no answer

[The Hawk:]
Deep in my soul, I hear your call
I feel the whispers and voices
There is no way, life is a cruel game
I will get lost in the dark

[The Lion:]
Only you can hold the key
Of my heart and my dream
I'm a jester, I'm a king
See the world inside of me
Now the fall is getting near
The night is getting cold
Free your mind and close your eyes
We're gonna leave it

[Hawk and Lion:]
I know, Shadows are leaving
I know, Heroes are landing
My love, we'll fly as high as the sun
But there's no heaven

[The Hawk:]
There's a way to follow
I will come back to the light

[Heroes:]
Fly away and rise again

[The Lion:]
...and I will find you

[The Hawk:]
One day I will remember
One day I will forgive you

[The Lion:]
Day as Lions, you know that I'm goin' to
Climb the highest wave of the see

[The Hawk:]
I know, my wings are broken
I know, I will be falling
I pray, my time has come to the end
And there's no answer

[Hawk and Lion:]
I know, Shadows are leaving
I know, Heroes are landing
My love, we'll fly as high as the sun
