HERE I STAND, ON THE SHORE
AND I WAIT FOR YOUR RETURN
NOW THE SUN DOESN'T SHINE
IN MY EYES THERE IS NO LIFE
EVERYWHERE I GO I HEAR YOUR VOICE
BUT MY HEART HAS GROWN COLD
EVERYTIME I LOOK AROUND
I CAN'T FIND YOU NO MORE
I HAVE NEVER FELT SO LONELY
'TIL YOU LEFT MY HERE
I LOVE YOU BUT YOU'RE FLYING HIGH
THE HAWK IN YOU

I WON'T  CRY, TRY TO LIVE MY LIFE
I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE STILL SO FAR AWAY
I WON'T CRY, I WILL LIVE MY LIFE
I LOVE YOU BUT YOU'RE FLYING HIGH
THE HAWK IN YOU
