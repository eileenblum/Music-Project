JUST ANOTHER LONELY NIGHT, NO ONE STAYS ON MY SIDE
GAZING THE MOONLIGHT I HEAR NO SOUND
I WILL REMEMBER IT WAS LONG TIME AGO
WE STAYED TOGHETER BUT NOW IT'S GONE
FLYING FOR THE LAST TIME
RISING ON THE WINGS OF GLORY
PRAYING FOR A NEW LIFE
RIDING 'TIL WE'LL SAY GOODBYE
LOST IN A BLACK CAGE, I CAN'T LEAVE FROM HERE
AND I BELIEVE IT'S A SIN
LIVING MY WINTER, COLD IS THE WIND
I KNOW SHE'S CRYING FOR ME

JUST ANOTHER HOLYDAY, NO ONE STAYS ON MY WAY
GATES OF A STRANGE LAND CLOSE TO THE EDGE
I STILL REMEMBER WHEN I WAS TOLD:
"THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME, I'LL LET YOU GO!"
FLYING FOR THE LAST TIME
RISING ON THE WINGS OF GLORY
PRAYING FOR A NEW LIFE
RIDING 'TIL WE'LL SAY GOODBYE
FALL IN A DARK AGE, I'LL NEVER BE FREE
UNTIL THE END OF MY DREAM
SOMEONE IS WAITING FAR BEYOND THE SEA
HEROES ARE CALLING FOR ME
