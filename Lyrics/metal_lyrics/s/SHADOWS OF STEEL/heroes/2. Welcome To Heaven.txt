THE SEAL IS BROKEN, THE SEAS ARE OPEN
MY TIME IS OVER, I WILL LEAVE FROM HERE
I DREAM ABOUT YOU
I WANT TO COME OVER YOU LIVING TOGHETER
CLOSE MY EYES AND FALL INTO THE DARK
I WILL NEVER RETURN
FIND A WAY TO GO DOWN TO THE EDGE OF THE WORLD
WELCOME TO HEAVEN, I'M COMING CLOSER
OUT OF THE EYE OF THE STORM
WELCOME TO HEAVEN, I'LL LIVE FOREVER
INTO THE GARDEN OF SOULS
MY HOPE IS FADING, MY DREAMS ARE FALLING
WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
I FEEL THE COLD WIND IS BLOWING DEEP IN MY HEART
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME?
