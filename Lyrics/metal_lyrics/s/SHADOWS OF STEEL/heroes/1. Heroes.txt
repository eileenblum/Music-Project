I REMEMBER THE DAYS THAT WE MET
IT'S A LONG TIME, I'LL NEVER FORGET
I WAS YOUNGER AND I NEVER KNEW
WHY YOU CHOSE ME TO BE KILLED
IN THE SKY, THE EAGLES START TO FLY
ONCE AGAIN, CROSSING THE EDGE OF TIME
FALLING DOWN IN TO THE NIGHT
WHERE THE ANGELS DIE
SPREAD YOUR WINGS, FOLLOW THE LINE
TRY TO FIND A WAY
HEROES FLY, BREAKING THE ICE
TOUCH THE RAINBOW'S LIGHT
HEROES FLY, HIGHER AND HIGH
TAKE ME FAR AWAY
I REMEMBER THE STORIES WE LIVED
TRYIN' TO CONQUER AND SHARING A DREAM
IN THE END OF OUR JOURNEY WE KNEW
WE COULD NEVER FIND A NEW WORLD

WILL I EVER KNOW THE REASON
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR?
TIME HAS COME TO LEAVE THE DARKNESS
LIVE ANOTHER DAY
