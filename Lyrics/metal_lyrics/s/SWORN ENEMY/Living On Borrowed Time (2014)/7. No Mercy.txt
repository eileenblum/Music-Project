We try to repress this hate inside
Explode without warning when the moment is right
We're bred to kill its deep at the core

Kill to survive survive to kill
Do what it takes cause your enemy will
Survive to kill kill to survive
Do what it takes to stay alive

No mercy no mercy no mercy no surrender
inflicting inflict your punishment it's now or never
no mercy no mercy no mercy no surrender
inflicting inflict your punishment it's now or never

The power to dominate can't be ignored
The scent of your blood makes me crave it more
Stamp out till nothings left no need for reason
War machine keeps marching on never out of season

Kill to survive survive to kill
Do what it takes cause your enemy will
Survive to kill kill to survive
Do what it takes to stay alive

No mercy no mercy no mercy no surrender
inflicting inflict your punishment it's now or never
no mercy no mercy no mercy no surrender
inflicting inflict your punishment it's now or never
It's now or never
No mercy
Never surrender

No mercy no mercy no mercy no surrender
inflicting inflict your punishment it's now or never
no mercy no mercy no mercy no surrender
inflicting inflict your punishment it's now or never
