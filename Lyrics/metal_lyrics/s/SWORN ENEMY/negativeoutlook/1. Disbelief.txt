Why must we die some aimlessly
i wish i could right all the wrongs
this life we live is our only one
the nightmares i have will never be gone
trus in your feelings their real
you have control of your life
don't fall prey to the weak 
watch as they infect their kind
i can't take it anymore i can't take it anymore
stand tall the truth can't hurt
it can only make you strong
don't be afraid to stand your ground
you knew the answers all along
stand tall the truth can't hurt
it can only make you strong
don't be afraid to stand your ground
you knew the answers all along
