You know that you can't hide yourself behind the mask that you've made you 
phoney I've found out so go tell someone who really cares you betrayed our 
friendship the life long bond was split at the seems we were one in the same 
now watch my smile turn into a stare
you betrayed yourself you betrayed us all there'snothing left ruins are all 
that's left after the fall
if there's one thing i've learned in this heartless world you gotta expect 
the unexpected
All of the lies I couldn't see now i seek retrobution like pouring salt on 
an open wound my rage burns from within Trust me you said these words
I can never foorget the fact that I didn,t see it coming took me by surprise 
behing your facade you hid your shame well the memories will make it hard to 
live through all of this shame from the times that were good and even of 
times of bad we've through it all now im suffering your final gain can you 
honestly think what you,ve done makes it worh the hell you'll have to face 
can you honestly say what you've done makes the hell that you'll have to 
face
