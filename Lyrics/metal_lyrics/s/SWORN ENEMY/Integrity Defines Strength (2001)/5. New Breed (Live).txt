Straight to the top and we won't stop
no holding back prepare the attack
we ain't gonna quit so don't give us shit
our time has come to shine in the sun
the feeling is right it can't be wrong
forge on ahead we will be strong
the mind is a tool makes us wise to the game
we're not in this for all the fortune and fame
stop take a look and see what we've done
this is our fight where the battles shall be won
the time is right now dont think of the past
trying to catch our wave is like walking on glass
we will not fall
the time is right
we will stand tall
we see the light
we will not forget
where we came from
this is a sure bet
we must rise up
take advantage of our youth
the writings are crystal clear
this is our time
pressures on us to see if we'll crack
jump in your face if you turn your back
trying to catch what can't be caught
the teachers are the ones who shall be taught
stope take a look and see what we've done
this is our fight where the battles shall be won
the time is right now don't think of the past
trying to catch our wave is like walking on glass
we will not bow down
