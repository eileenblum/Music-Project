power to fufill your destiny the actions of man speak greater than words 
through your voice I shall be heard why must I suffer in pain was this 
endeavor all in vain I'm treated like the man I am not some figment of your 
imagination the life i lead was pure and true humble servant there for you 
reaching down within my self to deal with life a living hell wash your hands 
of for all its for you I bleed watch me suffer upon the cross your sins are 
what I die for The pain of the guilt you can't hide these tears of blood 
I've cried apon the cross hands and feet torn crown of thorns placed upon my 
head sacraficed for your sins but no one wins cause we're really all dead 
I've created what you have desecrated now all I see is sorrows devistation 
my final hour is at hand give me the strength to face my last stand I wish 
that all could understand like you I am just a man flesh and blood I feel 
the same pain spill my blood the ground will stain now as the end draws near 
the final moment that I fear my sense is strong good will prevail with my 
death the next won't fail
You give me life
life brought me pain
pain brings sorrow
not all in vain not all in vain
everything i do is not all in vain
