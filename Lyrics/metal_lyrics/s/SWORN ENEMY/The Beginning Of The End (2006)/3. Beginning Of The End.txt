Forgive them... of all their sins

Soft spoken with no lies
A man for the people
Not one to beg not one to shout
Teacher to all for what this lifeâs about

Nothing to gain, whatâs so insane
Heâs known better to all just for his pain
Mother dearest waiting to send
Her son to the beginning of the end

This is the beginning of the end
This is the beginning of the end

Fate of millions rests in my hands
Now this do I understand

Rivers of red running through my head
I walk this path alone made up of the dead
The strength of the few runs through my veins
Forgive the killers the bringers of pain

On that morning somethingâs dawning
Ray of light broke through the sky
Save a prayer for our brothers
Consequence of one tiny lie

Father tells me of my journey
To a place I wish to be
But I must forsake my life
And travel down this path of agony

This is the beginning of the end
This is the beginning of .... the ... end
This is the end
