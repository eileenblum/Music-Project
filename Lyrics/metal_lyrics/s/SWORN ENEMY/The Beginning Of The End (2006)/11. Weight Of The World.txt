Believe in yourself
A lack of self esteem just means
I gotta fight harder
Sometimes it feels like weight of the world on my shoulders

How many times have you heard this before
If you could spend one day
In these shoes I'm wearing
Feel the weight I carry then you'd understand

Weight of the world on my shoulders
Then you'd understand
Weight of the world on my shoulders
Then you'd understand

Pressure is not something that should be taken lightly
Stronger men have broken down when faced with despair
Sometimes it feels like weight of the world on my shoulders

I know you've heard it all
If you could spend one day
In these shoes I'm wearing
Feel the weight carry then you'd understand

Weight of the world on my shoulders
Then you'd understand
Weight of the world on my shoulders
Then you'd understand

I know you've heard this before
But this time I gotta fight back
Focusing on positive action
Break away from this negative world
