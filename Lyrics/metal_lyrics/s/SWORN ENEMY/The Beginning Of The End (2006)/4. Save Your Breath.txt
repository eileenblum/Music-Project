I fight for what is mine no control is what I fear
My beliefs I will not change this voice you will hear
This is my life wont change for anyone
No need for explanations your questions ignored
Talk all you want till your blue in the face
Your useless words mean nothing here
You think you got something to say
Well ignorance is bliss

Save your breathe you've crossed that line
Save your breathe you cant take what's mine

Destroy the ignorance mind
Trust you seek something you'll never find
Destroy the ignorance mind
Trust you seek something you'll never find
You'll never find

This is my life wont change for anyone
No need for explanations your questions ignored
Talk all you want till your blue in the face
Your useless words mean nothing here
You think you got something to say
Well ignorance is bliss

Picture this me being like you imagine that for just a second fool
No right to judge me or say what you feel so save your breathe

Save your breathe you've crossed that line
Save your breathe you can take what's mine

I never needed anyone
I'll always stand on my own
I never needed anyone
I'll always stand on my own
