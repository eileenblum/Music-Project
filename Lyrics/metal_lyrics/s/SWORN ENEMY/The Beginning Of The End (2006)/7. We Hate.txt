What I really hate is music like yours
Makes me wanna smash your head through a door
Kill yourself go die
It'd be a better place in my eyes
Must be some kind of sick joke
Fact you exist makes me wanna choke

We hate your music we hate you too
We got our reasons for what we do
You cannot hide you stupid fucks
We really think your music sucks

Where did you come from, go back
You should be hung up like meat from a rack
I can't believe what has become
To a scene that I once loved

We hate your music we hate you too
We got our reasons for what we do
You cannot hide you stupid fucks
We really think your music sucks

I'm burned out I tried my best
Bit I gotta get this off my chest
These cloned wannabes fashion disasters
The best way to describe brings me laughter

You wonder why we hate you
Your existence makes me sick

We hate your music we hate you too
We hate your music we hate you too
We hate
