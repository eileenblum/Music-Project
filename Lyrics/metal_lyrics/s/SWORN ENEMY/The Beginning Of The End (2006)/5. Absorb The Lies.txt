You think you're bulletproof, deception is your guise
False prophet sent to lead the working class demise
We the people stand to lose our blue skies turn grey
Figurehead of a fallen nation time of eternal dismay

We face our toughest battles with a foreign foe
Cells unlike any other you'd ever know

Invaded lands now they won't go
For years and years our soil unknown
Hide your children behind their closed doors
Now watch your 1st borns go fight the war...

Poverty is not a crime
The poor the weak all suffer in time
The first to go stand the frontline
Constantly walking a fine line

Absorb the lies we face deceit
a countries politics based on greed
A better place so we've been told
300 years to soon to be bold

The thought of this makes me sick
to see a country so great
Living in the dark ages
the truth will makes us hate

Invaded lands now they won't go
For years and years our soil unknown
Hide your children behind their closed doors
Now watch your 1st borns go fight the war...

United they won't break us
United won't be broken
United won't break us
United won't be broken

You want war... We'll bring you war!!!!!
