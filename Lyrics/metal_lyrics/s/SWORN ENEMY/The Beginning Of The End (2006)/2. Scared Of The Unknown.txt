Man made we die
Canât escape these thoughts in my mind
Could it be my time here
Gone like mist in the open air

What we create will infect
Everything we touch until the end

Scared of the unknown
Prepare to be alone

Minutes feel like hours
Days seem like years
Final ticking of the clock
Releases all your fears

Somewhere in time
Face the future we leave behind

Scared of the unknown
Prepare to be alone

Man made we die
Canât escape these thoughts in my mind
Could it be my time here
Gone like mist in the open air

Scared of the unknown
Prepare to be alone...

Turn to the light when darkness falls
Shutter from the sight annihilation of us all

In the blink of an eye
The decimation of all of mankind
Wipe away all the sins of the earth
Cleanse the ground a new rebirth...
