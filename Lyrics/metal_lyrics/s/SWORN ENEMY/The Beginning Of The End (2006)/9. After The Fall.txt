We live we die too many questions no answers just why
The pain the hate how much longer do we have to wait
We live we die too many questions no answers just why
The pain the hate how much longer do we have to wait

Put on the news and what do I see
The horror of a nation
Forsake the future of the not yet born
Another day another face

Poverty stricken laid to waste
We keep denying the children crying
Self absorbed in our own damn greed
No motivation to live this life that we lead

After the fall After the fall whatâs left nothing at all
After the fall After the fall we had a choice we made the call
After the fall what's left nothing at all
After the fall we had a choice we made the call
After the fall whatâs left nothing at all
After the fall we made the call

We live we die too many questions no answers just why
The pain the hate how much longer do we have to wait
We live we die too many questions no answers just why
The pain the hate how much longer do we have to wait

Crimes of hate race against race
Truth be told how much more can we take
Violence and anguish death tolls rise
The sins are cast open your eyes
We need to learn from the mistakes of the past

A living suicide it wonât be the last
False hope canât get much worse
Someone tell me why this life is such a curse

After the fall After the fall what's left nothing at all
After the fall After the fall we had a choice we made the call
After the tall what's left nothing at all
After the fall we had a choice we made the call
After the fall whatâs left nothing at all
After the fall we made the call

We all fall down
