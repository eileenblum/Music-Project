What you trying to say to me my time is ticking
Seconds are fading away my hands are tied well
I don't have nothing to say I'm itching inside
I feel myself hitching a ride another dose
Just to keep my body alive

I won't apologize
I have nothing to say
There's no compromise
My life just keeps slipping away

If I fall I wont be getting up this time
No standing tall think I reached the end of the line
The path I choose leading me to my demise
I'm falling fast cant keep living life like the past

I won't apologize I have nothing to say
There's no compromise
My life just keeps slipping away

In this life there are no second chances
No second chances
No second chances

My cards were dealt this hand must be played
My clock is ticking no time for delay
Life is a gamble I still played the game
No second chances are rolling my way

No  second chances
No second chances
No second chances
