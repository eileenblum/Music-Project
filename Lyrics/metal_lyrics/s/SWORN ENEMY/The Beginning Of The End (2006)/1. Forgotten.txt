The time to change is now

If we forget our problems
Our reasons our will to survive
If we forget our problems
Our reasons look back on your life...

And imagine the way
You'd want things to be
Dreaming of a better day
A better way to make a change
There is no need to live by regret

The time to change is now
Forgive yourself for your mistakes
Forgive yourself

If we forget our problems
Our reasons our will to survive
If we forget our problems
Our reasons look back on your life...

Look back on your life
