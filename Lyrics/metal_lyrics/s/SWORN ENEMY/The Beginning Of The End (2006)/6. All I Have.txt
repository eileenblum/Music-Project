All I have

My life my road down hell
An everyday struggle slowly we rot
All I have all I see
All I have day by day is me

Fight these feelings just to get by
Wake up the truth is right in your eyes
This emptiness fills me inside
My fate can not be denied

This fire burns raging through
A life of lies what can I do
No stopping now no turning back
These feelings are all I have

And yet I cant explain them
The only was is throughthis constant struggle
Alone we rot

All I have

My life my road down hell
An everybody struggle slowly we rot
All I have all I see
All I have day by day is me

All these feelings I cant explain
The constant struggle day by day
All these feelings I cant explain
The constant struggle day by day
