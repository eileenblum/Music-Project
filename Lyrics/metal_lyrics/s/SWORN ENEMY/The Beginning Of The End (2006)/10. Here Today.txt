So here's a question I have to ask
Do we take the time can we make it last
A gift so precious we choose to ignore
Now face the facts, no turning back

Wishing for the chance to say the things you couldnât say
Wish it was differently
Taken for granted it may be too late
With every breath closer to death

Suffer the pain of a loss so suddenly
Regret now what could never be
Feeling it can never happen to me
Until you spent so much time on your knees...

No one hears your pleas
With your rosary in hand
You try to understand

You pray you pray you pray and still you pray
But no more today
Everything we touch in an instant
Can be taken away

Never forget the reality of things to come
What could I say
Make damn sure the beauty you hold onto
Doesn't just wash away

Suffer the pain of a loss so suddenly
Regret now what could never be
Feeling it can never happen to me
Until you spent so much time on your knees...

No one hears your pleas
With your rosary in hand
You try to understand
Try to understand!!!

Here today gone tomorrow
Spend this life living in sorrow
Here today gone tomorrow...

Now your pain is gone
Now your pain is gone!!!!
