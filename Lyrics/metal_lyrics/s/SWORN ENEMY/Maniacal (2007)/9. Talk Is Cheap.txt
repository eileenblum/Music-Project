make no mistakes, make no mistake
your time has come, so make no mistakes
thinking what you got is so important to say
so take a step back
your always up
your points are never valid
your words are a waste
what are the chances you will learn?
i guess you weren't tought respect is earned
make no mistakes your time will come
make no mistakes your time will come
and when it does, and when it does i'll be there
i can destroy your dreams
i can destroy your dreams
my thoughts are full of regret
i wanna cause you pain
a little something that you won't forget
make no mistakes, make no mistakes your time will come
and in my day i learned a thing or two
it's guys like you, always learn the hard way
it's guys like you, always learn the hard way
your time has come
make no mistakes, make no mistakes
your time has come, make no mistakes
make no mistakes, make no mistakes
your time has come, so make no mistakes
