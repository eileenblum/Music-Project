no way out
there's no way out
i can't escape
this dream is for real
won't survive the wait
it's something that i feel
gotta get out gotta get out
i've got to get the hell out of here
gotta get out gotta get out
gotta get out gotta get out
i've got to get the hell out of here
no way out
the nightmare begins
no where to run no where to hide
my mind is numb
no one's by my side
hear all the voices inside my head
making me wish that i was dead
theres no where to run to, there's no where to hide
my mind is numb and there's no one by my side
i've got to get the hell out of hear
gotta get out gotta get gotta get out
i've got to get the hell out of here
no way out
the nightmare begins
no way out
there's no way out
no way out
the nightmare continues
i thought i could run, i thought i could hide
i was overcome with fear
i was too blind
now it's over and i've had my say
i have no more words left
it's time to pray
it's time to pray
