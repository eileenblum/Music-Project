we all see, we all hear, we all say, we all see what you want us to see
we all hear what you want us to hear
we all say what you want us to say
fear keeps us blind to the truth
truth and justice
the american way
honor and pride what do you have to say
honesty is a thing of the past
we are products of the big machine
unknowing victims to the fascist regime
kept off guard through propaganda
no one to blame but ourselves
now these dreams have turned to greed
a price we pay for being free
this is the place where dreams are made
we all see, we all hear, we all say, we all see what you want us to see
we all hear what you want us to hear
wealth is the minority
the rest live in poverty
how can we just let this be?
this is called democracy
