right now the way i'm feeling inside
there's no way my destiny can hide
you can't take that from me
my life, my destiny
my life, my destiny
i feel i've fought the good fight in the eyes of my peers
never surrender
never surrender to my fears
i'll choose my path wisely
believe in myself
won't let you tell me that i'm not top shelf
cream of the crop
i won't settle for less
if satisfaction kills desire
you won't be the best
you can't take that from me
cause this is how i see
you can't take that from me
my life, my destiny
try to stay focused
do all that i can
cause in the blink of an eye
it all could end
it all could end
prepare to destroy
lets see if i got what it takes
prepare to destroy
i know i've got what it takes
prepare to destroy
