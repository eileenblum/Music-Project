maybe before too long you'll see the light of day
try something different
you may see it my way
there are things you just can't change
unwilling to negotiate
one track mind
waiting to fight
why won't you listen to what is right
we can't live in the past, we can't live in the past
it's always the same thing
a tale as old as time itself
i get it, i've got it, i've heard it all before
there are things you just can't change
unwilling to nigotiate
one track mind
waiting to fight
why won't you listen to what is right?
not trying to say i'm right, not trying to say your wrong
only see your point of view and thats the way it goes
maybe before too long you'll see the light of day
try something different, you may see it my way
we can't live in the past
i've heard it all before
we can't live in the past
i've heard it all, i've heard it all before
there are things you just can't change
unwilling to negotiate
one track mind
waiting to fight
why won't you listen to what is right?
