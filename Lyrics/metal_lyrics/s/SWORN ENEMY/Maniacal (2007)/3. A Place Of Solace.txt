look inside do i like what i see
there's gotta be more to this
there's gotta be more to this
i keep searching for a place of solace
out of the dark into the light
oh god god please please can you help me
searching for shelter
god's little helper
help make it better for me
piece of mind i desire
i vow to never tire
something's gotta give
i just want to live
searching for shelter
something's got to give
hear my prayers
is it too much to ask
hear my prayers
a place of solace
searching for shelter
god's little helper
help make it better
piece of mind i desire
i vow to never tire
something's gotta give
i just want to live
searching for shelter
something's got to give
i keep searching for a place of solace
out of the dark into the light
hear my prayers
is it too much to ask
hear my prayers
a place of solace
a place of solace
