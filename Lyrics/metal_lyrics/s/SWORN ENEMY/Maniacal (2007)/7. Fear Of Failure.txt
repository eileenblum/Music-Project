it's hard to fail but its worse never to have tried
stop wasting your life in our own doubts
just follow your dreams
you have this fear of failure
just follow your dreams
you have this fear of failure
just follow your dreams
it is what you make of it
and you can do anything
don't you know it, it is what you make of it
just follow your instincts and you can do anything
relish in the dreams of your future
so don't worry about yesterday
you have this fear of failure
just follow your dreams
