from the bottom i wanna rise straight to the top
never weathered from this storm
i'm in the drivers seat
i'll hold my own
gotta do, gotta do what i can
gotta do what i can
never to look back
it's my time to fight
it's my time
it's my time to fight
fight for what you believe
fight for what you believe
you'll witness what i am
the strength that i possess
these battle scars will heal
i'll make it through
i'll make it through the killing fields
it's my time to fight
it's my time, time to fight
fight for what you believe
fight for what you believe
