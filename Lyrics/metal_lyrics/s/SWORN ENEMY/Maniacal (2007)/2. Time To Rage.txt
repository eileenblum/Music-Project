it's time to rage
why do i feel like why do i feel
like i keep wasting away
it's time for change
nothing can hold me back
it's time for change
it's time to rage
here we go again here we go
another sleepless night waiting for a sign
it's time for change
nothing can hold me back
it's time for change
it's time to rage
for years it's been my therapy
all of you been there with me
for years it's been my therapy
on this stage it's time
it's time to rage
it's time to rage
