No matter how hard we try we all fall down
This time I'll take my changes, I've got to fight for mine
These lessons I deeded to learn that, all knowledge
Comes with me
No matter how hard we try we all fall down
No matter how hard we try sometimes our feet
Can't tough the ground
Always a constant battle to make sure my voice is heard
I'll continue to live out my dream passing onto the next my word
Ready to take by force, no matter what's my course
I'm on aone way trip to the end, one way trip
Ready to take by force, no matter what's my course
I'm on aone way trip to the end, one way trip
Never let no one walk all over me, never let my feelings subside
Be careful not to let my guard down, 2faces come in any disguise
No matter how hard we try we all fall down
No matter how hard we try sometimes our feet
Can't tough the ground
Always a constant battle to make sure my voice is heard
I'll continue to live out my dream passing onto the next my word
Ready to take by force, no matter what's my course
I'm on aone way trip to the end, one way trip
Ready to take by force, no matter what's my course
I'm on a one way trip to the end, one way trip to the end
Won't let it end
