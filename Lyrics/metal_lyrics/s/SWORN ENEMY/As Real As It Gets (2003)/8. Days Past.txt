The days of my past now are so far gone
The glory days when the battles were won
The walking down those hallowed halls
The laughing, the yelling, the ruling it all
As I close my eyes I can plainly see
The lunchroom tables and everybody
The jokes that were made, the fun that was had
And all the trouble we got being bad

But time, time can be so cruel
And play with your mind
And you wish harder for those days to find

Time can be so cruel
And play with your mind
And you wish harder for those days to find

Those days are gone forever!

Life rolls on even as we look back
To those days that were treasured
When fiction was fact
I get the chills when I stop and think
How much time can actually pass between each blink?
When I think of all the things that I did
I feel like now in my heart that I don't even live
Can you feel the warmth as you stop and smile?
Doesn't that call you back every once in a while?
While!

The days of my past now are so far gone
The glory days when the battles were won
The walking down those hallowed halls
The laughing, the yelling, the ruling it all
As I close my eyes I can plainly see
The lunchroom tables and everybody
The jokes that were made, the fun that was had
And all the trouble we got being bad

But time, time can be so cruel
And play with your mind
And you wish harder for those days to find

Time can be so cruel
And play with your mind
And you wish harder for those days to find

Days Past!

My heart races back to the days of the past
In my mind I knew that it wouldn't last
So much to miss, (So much to miss!), So much fun
I spend my days reliving thoughts of all that I've done
