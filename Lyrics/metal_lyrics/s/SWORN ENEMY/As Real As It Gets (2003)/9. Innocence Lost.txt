Respect is something you have to learn.
All innocence lost.
For those who have not forgotten,
Where they came from.
The misconceptions of what should be,
A failed life, a torn past.
Living for one reason I've created,
My own destiny.
Countless cruelties bestowed upen me,
Freewill, what a novel idea.
Spend you lifelime living for something.
In the end it's all a lie.
Born just to die in a world of hate - I suffer.
Blood in blood out something go - beyond the grave.
Innocence lost.
Born just to die in a world of hate - I suffer.
Blood in blood out something go - beyond the grave.
Taught to believe.
The imperfections of this human lie.
On the inside the fire rage.
Throught my while existence.
Pour my heart out on this pad.
It does no good for me now.
At the same time, the afterlife doesn't seem so bad.
Born just to die in a world of hate - I suffer.
Blood in blood out something go - beyond the grave.
Innocence lost.
Born just to die in a world of hate - I suffer.
Blood in blood out something go - beyond the grave.
I've made my way, I'll have to deal.
With the fact that there is no changing.
My tomorrow forever.
Be altered by my yesterday.
Some things are meant to be.
If I could change it all I would do it.
In a heart beat.
In a heart beat.
In a heart beat.
One step a a time, I've fallen.
I've fallen too far behind.
Now I think I've lost my mind,
In the end it's all a lie.
