You call me this, you say I'm that.
You want to label me some kind of outcast.
Like a dreaded disease to the environment.
My kind tips the scale of disconcert.
So more power to me cause I'm with it
You think that you're the ones to cime
And get it.
There's no front for me to hide behind.
You want me gone, pick a number and wait in line.
Come as your are - Raise the dead - Fuel the fire.
That explode in my head.
Labels are just a name, I'll stay true to the game,
Labels are just a name, I'll stay true to the game.
You don't know me, you can't see me,
You don't know me, you can't see me.
I've learned to put your shit behind me,
I've learned to put your shit behind me.
Open your eyes, take a look and see,
Open your eyes and take a look and see.
Now the clock ticks down to the moment when you open your mouth.
Why don't you learn to speak,
Cause nobody must have told you that your talk was cheap.
Did I in any way mislead you yo believing?
That there was a chanceI'd leave your daughter grieving.
All the stupids thoughts you had of me in your head.
Sometimes it makes me think that you'd be better of dead.
So just put an end to your tragic whappy life.
A lesson learned, tables turned,
Time to pay the piper.
Come as your are - Raise the dead - Fuel the fire.
That explode in my head.
You got me labeled all wrong.
I survive because I'm strong.
