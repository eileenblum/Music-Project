Get cha' motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
In whatever comes your way

Yeah darlin' gonna make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once and
Explode into space

I like smokin' lightnin'
Heavy metal thunder!
Racin' with the wind
And the feelin' that I'm under

Like a true nature's child
We were born - born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die

Born to be wild
Born to be wild
