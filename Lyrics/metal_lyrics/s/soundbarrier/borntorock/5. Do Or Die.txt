Do or die!
Slowly approaching the beginning of the end!
We've fought a bloody fight
And survived but did not win
We did not come this far
To take a backseat ride
We've learned our lesson well
It's now do or die!

Do or die - do or die
Do or die - it's do or die!
Disrespect total neglect
What did you expect!

A new day's crossing
The horizon up ahead
You'd better prove yourself
Or you're bound to wind up dead
It's either do or die
Only you can decide
Tomorrow may find you well
But today it's do or die!

Do or die - do or die
Do or die - it's do or die!
A disrespect a total neglect
Such a bloody mess!
