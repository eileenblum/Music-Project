Life is for the living
And everyone's got a goal
In this world of illusion
Playing out the daily roll

[Chorus:]
Are you ready to give
And not just to receive
Ready to seek out the world you perceive
Sacrifice all for what you believe
And face the illusion of reality

Are you ready - to conquer the world
Are you ready - to conquer the world

When I watch the sunset on the western skies
Sometimes it makes me wonder
Is it the end of a day or the end of time

Are you ready - ready or not!
Take your best shot - and go!
