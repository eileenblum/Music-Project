There lives a raging fire
Burning in my heart
Outraged with desire
For a life that's long been lost!
Is there no end to my pain
How long must I suffer
I refuse to refrain from blacking out the horror

My heart has endured
Though my life has been strained
But I must rest assured
That I will find the cure
For my raging heart

My blood is boilin' over
Enraged by my thoughts I feel the fire burning
Burning out my heart
Is there no end to my pain
How long must I suffer
There's a need for change
To keep me from going under!

My heart has endured
Though my life has been strained
But I must rest assured
That I'll know peace again
For my raging heart

Outraged with desire
For a life that's long been lost
There burns a living fire
Raging in the dark
I'll never surrender
To the rage born within
I'm obsessed with the glory of peace again

My heart has endured
Though my life has been strained
But I must rest assured
That I will be the cure!
For my raging heart
