From the very start
We knew what we must do
We let the power - come rush on thru
Still not knowing
Just where the power led
We took our chances
We took the dare!

Born to rock
With a fire you can't put out!

Born to rock! Born to rock! Born to rock!

Electric fire
Continuously fueled
By guiding forces
Unseen but yet still proved

Born to rock
With a feelin' that leaves no doubt!
Born to rock! Born to rock! Born to rock!
We're born to rock!

Sworn to rock!
With a fire you can't put out!
Sworn to rock!
With a feeling that leaves no doubt!
Born to rock! Born to rock! Born to rock!
