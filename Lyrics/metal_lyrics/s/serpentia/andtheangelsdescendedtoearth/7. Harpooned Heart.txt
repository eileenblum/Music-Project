Lights swirl inside of me
I know if I didn't open my eyes
I will never be back here again

Don't die my winged shadow

You gave me the power of decision

I'll spit in the face of deceiver
I'll save every drop of my blood
It's only for me and for my roots

Don't fly toward
The death dark horizons
It's not the blood what
Here left on me

His moves become slower
And the blood is all around
My Friend has been punished
By the Almighty Spirit
Don't die...

Nothing's gonna grow on this land
I'll put the heavenly harpoon
Out of your heart
We're embraced by heavenly sweetness

I will never look back again

Born...
