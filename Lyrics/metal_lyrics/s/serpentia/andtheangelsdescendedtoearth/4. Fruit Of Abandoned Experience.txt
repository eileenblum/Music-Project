Oh angel my faithful guardian
Stand always by my side

The way that Angel has shown me
Begins where time is yet unborn
My eyes are tied
Feets wet of blood

Hear words exploding with hatred
I've been punished before
I blamed
Deep in my mind where
Millions stars swirl

I have seen my Angel
And his torment
Suddenly light began
To flow over me

Surrounded me and
I've been swallowed
I awoke back

I awoke back my reality
But the vision of consecration
Was deep and clear

It's my time I have to survive
Knowing still that one of us
Must die

I hear words exploding with hatred
I've been punished before
I blamed
