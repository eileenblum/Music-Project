As a hail of silver coins
We were falling from the
Abyss of decay

Shining with the endless rage
Between the demise veil

You need to seek ingredients
To continue what has been left
Corruption has begun so descend
Into depths
Do you have blood enough
To feed your roots?
To believe and not
To go insane?

Now surrounded by the last
Ring of power - rise!
Purified Being - shine
Your own light and fly!
By the wall of your destiny
Death expects your fear

You'll be send down the darkness
Of your dreams but you'll
Live out that pain once again
With each and every nerve

You'll be put to the final try
If you fall then never see me again
You are the fruit of abandoned experience
