Like a cosmic vargant
I'm passing another corridors, hallways, passages
I'm a shepherd of the comets

Voices of those who left
But not forgotten calling me
From the depths of my veins

I can't refuse temptation
Being all alone
I want to see you once again

Each another disappointment
Seems to be like sand
I'm sinking within
My veins pump mercury
By 40 days I didn't
Experienced a sleep

I opened my eyes finally
But the sand was instead of blood
I tried to see further
But the mirror has blinded my eyes
