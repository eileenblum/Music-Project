I'm giving you life
To let You die.
I'm giving You cross
To make Your life hard
I'm giving You love
To waste Your heart
I'm giving You smile
To stab you in the back!

We are the thorns from the Saviorâs Crown
We are the Sun when all is gone
We are the thorns from the Saviorâs Crown
We are the Sun!

I'm giving You light
To show You real darkness
I'm giving You night
To bring You nightmares
I'm giving You hope
To waste Your time
I'm giving You smile
To stab you in the back

We are the thorns from the saviorâs crown
We are the Sun when all is gone
We are the thorns from the saviorâs crown
We are the Sun!

When all is gone
When all is lost!

My sign will make You fall down
My sign will make you fall!
