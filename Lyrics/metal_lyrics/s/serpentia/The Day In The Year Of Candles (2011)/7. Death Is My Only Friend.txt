Finding myself in sorrow - I suffer...
Shield my face from the light-my other self
Hiding my tears so that they will not take the lie
Of my balance away from Me
I smile at this thing that
I am yet the abyss smiles back at Me...
Spending time with Myself, I have found
That I am my own greatest antithesis

I want You all to bleed so as to make
You understand the bitter taste of pain
That I receive each doomy day

So You shall come to understand-Good
Is no final solution...
So You shall come to understand
that Evil always follows...
What keeps My mind is the thought of evil
The evil that provides my strength to survive!
I shall ascend in my wrath...
Whoever thou art., give me a chance for revenge!
Give Me hope - My words will be heard
