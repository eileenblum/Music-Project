Every time it rains
I get this feeling that the Heavens weep for You
Despite those thousands of stars...
I feel more lonely, almost empty
You wanted me to learn of hope
Yet Gabriel gave me hatred
So are You now ashamed of us?
Or is it what was meant to be?
Free Will won't always lead to Good...it never does

Have we failed You, or maybe have You failed us-Envy
Have we failed You, or maybe have You failed us-Greed
Have we failed You, or maybe have You failed us-Anger
Have we failed You, or maybe have You failed us?
Error,error...

Every time it rains
I get this feeling that the Angels weep for You
Despite those thousands of stars in the Heavens
I feel more lonely, almost empty
You wanted me to learn of love
Yet Gabriel gave me hatred
So are You now ashamed of us?
Or is it what was meant to be?
Free Will won't always lead to Good...it never does

Why are You silent?
Why are You silent?
Is that why You are not there?

The time of changes, is coming now!
This is my time!

Envy, geed, hostility-could any of these be the traits
Which people bear into Your likeness?
I think those lips tell lies; however, the eyes cannot
hide any falsehood...
Is that why You are not there?
Why are You silent?

..Lisa's eyes were the color of hope
-none of which is left within me...
