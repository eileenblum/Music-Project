I wish to smile once again
I feel now that my wings are growing
It hurts that we haven't got home anymore
But all that doesn`t matter
Because our souls are free
And nothing can stop us
We are here for a reason

It hurts that You are not here
But I'm thinking of You
In my day to day thoughts
And I'm feeling You close
In the deeps of my heart
And I'll tell You this

I'm looking at You through my eyes
I'm calling You through my lips
Dream on and I will come to You
Dream on ...
Dream on Lisa
