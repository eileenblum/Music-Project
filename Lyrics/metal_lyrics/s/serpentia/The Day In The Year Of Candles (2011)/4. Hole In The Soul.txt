There's a hole in Your soul
There's a pain in Your name
There's a hole in My soul
There's a pain in My name
In My name...in My name
there's a pain

I thought it would be impossible to fly up
with broken wings
When the storms of faith will return
many homes will be burned
I have the pain You have been looking for
My life is like dark abyss where I was born

Second 

I'll light the candle for You and me
To pay for regret over lost dream
I'll light the candle for You and me
To pay for regret over lost dream

This is the end -they know what
Must be done to fill You up with fear
They are already here -inside of You
Tempted by your failures
Fill Your flesh to let You feel fear
Which doesn`t let You forget
Your head is still full of memories which
Don't let You fall asleep

Break You down!
Gabriel will try to break us down
Break You down
Lucifer will try to break us down
