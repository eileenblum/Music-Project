That feedback will makes Our life dark.
I feel something bad is coming back.
For You, so many things to tell
For me one more day in hell.

Lies, They told me lies
For whole my life I was blind!

That Feedback is making Our times hard,
Because of this nightmare which wasting
My life...
For You so many things to say
For Us another day in pain.

Another fatality show because
Your greed grows more and more!
Another great news from your big eye,
That's why we want to die.

Pain, Pain, pain...

I cannot, I cannot, I cannot trust them!
We cannot, We cannot, We cannot trust lies!
