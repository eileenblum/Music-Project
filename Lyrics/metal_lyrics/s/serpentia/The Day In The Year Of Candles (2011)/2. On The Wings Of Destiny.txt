I'm on the wings of destiny which You want to deny
I need focus on my past,
my runes will help me to fight you back

My heaven will be your hell
My pain will be your pain
My anger will be your grave!

You've buried my mortal life
You've ruined my home and land
You've stolen my son and wife
All of that because of my celestial past

My knowledge was my curse...
My candle was my past...
My enemies I've took their lives

Take my anger, take my pain, take my sacrifice

I became a mortal but You expect Me to be divine
I still remember what lies in my heart
I'm on the wings of destiny which You want to deny
Open Your eyes!
