I just woke up and I know that you are dead.

I want to feel the smell of the wind 
And the scent of the burning leaves again. 
It brings Me back all the forgotten faces. 
I wish I could see Your face one more time...

Trees, Your leaves whisper the thoughts of the wind. 
You did Me a favor as I found myself within You. 
All of Us have our roots somewhere. 
Mine belong to the place I want to forget about.

Wind You know whyâ¦

But I follow a different path...

I wish I could hear Your voices and laughter. 
It would give Me the strength to go on. 
I can hear The blow of the wind instead. 
Instead of families-thousands of Candles at Home.

One home has one candle 
One candle has one family 
One family has one love 
Everything lost.
