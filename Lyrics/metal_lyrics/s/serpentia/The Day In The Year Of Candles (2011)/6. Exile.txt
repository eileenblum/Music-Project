Exile- I've begun my exile
Exile-I've taken my first steps
Exile-To erase my past
Exile-So many roads are closed
Exile-I have chosen to wander
Exile-Where I'm heading there is a bridge
Exile-that gives me my identity
Exile-I will find myself there!

Experience pain and sadness To breaking point
Experience dark deeds and thoughts

If I have only nothing-nothingness is all I have
If I have only nothing-nothingness is all I have
If I have only nothing-that's what I have!
If I have only nothing-that's what I have!
I will find Myself there, I will find Myself...
