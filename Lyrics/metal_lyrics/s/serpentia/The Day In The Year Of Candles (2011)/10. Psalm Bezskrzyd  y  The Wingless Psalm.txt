O' why did You give me no wings
And give me my mind in return
And this heart so heavy
With blood?

So that I will soar on my wings
That I won't have to believe to see
But I shall see to believe
And dream

O' why did You give me no wings?

And why when walking to You,
I walk away from You?
Though I feel that I miss You 
So much.

Wish I could carry light
Though there was one, so I've heard,
Who failed to bear it till the end
And fell

O' why did You give me no wings?

From the darkest valley I call out to You
Still redder than blood,
Darker than a night
With no stars

What if I believe
That all of it is nothing
But loneliness, doubt
And fear?

O'why did You give me no wings?

Take my mind, 
Take my heart
And my eyes and hands today
Away.

The more I want my wings
The more wingless I am
And the less of You I find within myself.
