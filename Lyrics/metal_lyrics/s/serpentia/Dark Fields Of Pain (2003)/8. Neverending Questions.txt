where do we go?
and who has strenght enough
to wander carrying the burden
of that miserable plague?

lifted high by the wind of both millenium,
wind of south that brought the smell
of blood and burning skin.
but where is that purity and belief
drowned in the gore ocean?
four directions in a surface
four arms, four faces of extinction

members of mighty tribe!
torn out of chains
priests of elements unite!!!!
to breathe and shine
to teach and restore the faith in true
gleam that makes immortal.

to feel that wind which smells with freedom
to destroy that black mass of souls possession
ans honest smile for the golden tide.

let`s reap together skin of lamb
whith hides the wolf.
then the time shall come
it would be easier to stare in to the future
than understand of what happened in the past
