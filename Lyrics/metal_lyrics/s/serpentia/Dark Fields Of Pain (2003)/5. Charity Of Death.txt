everyone is looking for something,
i've begun to look for death,
begun to admire her, to love her,
each day we were closer ...
i was imagine her
like beautiful woman,
who will cuddle me,
will love me,
will tear me of reality ...

i was so lonely,
that she became
everything what i loved,
her coolness
touched delicate my body.
at night
she spoke with me
always wanted to hear me ...

once she told me,
that we will soon be together.
then followed the waste
i didn't felt she fairly
i thought that she left me,
until this day ...
when she appeared,
most beautiful than every women
who i've never seen before,
she has caught slight my hand,
and told:
we can be finally together ...
