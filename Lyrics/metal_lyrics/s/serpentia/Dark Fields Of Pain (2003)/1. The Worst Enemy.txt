i will never be the same, after
opening this gate.

my feelings crushed to dust
blown by the wind.

it came to help me in a final duel.
fire fills my lungs.

i became something i was always afraid of.

father ! son ! i'm coming into fire, bless me.

earth, you suffer, i go to pay for what
has been taken from you.

brothers, i know you're by my side
and nothing is gonna cease our ties.

i feel cold breeze of air that death
was breathing.

so many years have passed ... i'm coming back,
strong as never before.

my tears mix with yours, drowning fools.
we're like swans that flew away free from slavery.

from there i can only see the cataclism
and you between.

tell me what you feel when the end is near ?
tell me what you see - your reflection ?

when the skies cry and the earth shakes
the only way is to go with fire and wind
in the eternity.
