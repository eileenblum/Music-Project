every day
when the sun goes down
behind my endless horizon of pain,
descry you ...
i know,
where my sight doesn't reach
you drown each day
and i'm not there ...

every night
when i hear the call
i know - it's you ...
i give you my hand
but you don't detect this ...
your lips are filled with water.

every day
when the sun goes down
behing distant horizon of suffer,
i try crucify my feelings.
i know,
where my sight doesn't reach
waves carry your inert body away
and i'm not there ...
