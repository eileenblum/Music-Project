let`s stand together my friend
to struggle once more against
experience, logic and faith.

your arms await for wings` shadow
every morning standing here at the call,
to destroy humans order
to bring an emotional madness

to die to live to live to die
words you whisper into my ear ...

i`m waiting up the hill to try myself
with the sun once more.

i`m that challenger who deres to rise
and lift high once more
just to fall down again.

today is a day i`ve been waiting for
so long

to went blind to see
to see only blindness.

now i realize that only existence
testimony is important...

narsiuha lend me by hand...
