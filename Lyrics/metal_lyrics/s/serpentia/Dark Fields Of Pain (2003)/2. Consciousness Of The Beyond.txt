unknown fear brings us to ignorance
and ignorance hides what really unknown is.

ancient ages wisdom is replaced
by the idle God of tripple face.

programmed minds return their
harvest to the earth.
eyes subsided into pit of blackness
looking for another suns.

when glowing nebulas will surround
glassy eye of the faithful one,
his heart is gonna shiver for
a long time, convulsing in
a panic extasy.

secrets, penetrating through themselves
scaring with the beauty of cruelty.
stern eye's admiring a frozen sea
that is striking with cold
despite the summer's heat.

here's the one empty and proud
calling himself as crown of the cration.
murderer of what is out of reach.
here they are, careful and merciful
they'll bring the chaos while religions fall.

for written is - we the god.
