Finishing my work,I'm trying to erase my pain,
dinning thorough sadness.
My hands bleed as soul burns deep inside.
Each another day i accept that struggle of
what is important to me.

There's blood of my father down in
this land,and the tears of my mother
can't even wipe it.
Determinism is like a good fundament
to create the new annihilation.

Scratching my revenge I'm using violence
and suffering.
Somewhere deep is what has to come.

Their sacrifice wasn't in vain,but
my answer shall be ultimate,
and the hell we'll prepare-
the place of their rest.
