Cheated by your fate, you're escaping
through another days, being blind to see
that the things that have to come are so near.
Forgetting the sins of your youth, you've
tried to fix your life on, but the final word is mine...

Every passing hour makes you shiver,
cause you don't know what I offer to you...
The peace of mind is what you desire,
the peace of what you'll never be given

You hear me deep inside, and my song shall
take away all your happiness,
it will build the kingdom, it will become
the invisible burden at your broken back.

Is the one you love?
Have you departed it?
I know you 'll never, ever do it!

Temporary is the time when your happiness
is vanishing, so I'll be having fun at your expense.
What would reveal the next day?
Just answer to yourself.

[Ref.]

I am the mystery and I am the solution
I am the destiny so I am the curse too.
You are my slave, and your fate is the toy of mine.
You are the reward for taking care I've offered to you!
