When the timeless emptiness dwells
inside my soul, the fire struggeles
to swallow hunger I feel far so many
years.

When there's nobody I could back for
in my home I became a wanderer.
Day by day much far from home and myself.
In the hidding somewhere between regret and
bitterness.

Touched by Parahlitos I'm looking for
meanings of all.
The trip into my within is my destiny.
Each another eve I feel much more lost.

[Ref.]

Now I know there's no return.
I have to stay here to be forgotten.
Only the wind shall hum the melody of my life.
It only knows who I really was...

When the deed score is unavoidible,
and judgement so cruel,
I, ll be laughing with the tears in my eyes.

Now, awaken after so long time
I have meet just the ruins of my youth.
Only cold experience left instead of memories.
Does my Angel left me?
Or maybe He just died?
I will never know the truth...
The wandering is slowly finishing,
and the wind creates new sounds...

The only truealy friend - loneliness.
