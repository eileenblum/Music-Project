Motivated by revenge, desperately grasping
for air,I strangle...
Eyes turned out to the north,there i will
achieve, what was going to.
Power gets lesser but the shine gives me the chance.

The sore in my back reminds my friend,
it bleeds still reminding betrayal.
Though suffering i can see a goal,
that gives me the hope,for my trip to be finished.
Chill wind eases the pain.

I think I'm the choosen one for the stars
are changing their eternal route.
When the mourning bell's sound flows majesticly,
my chest bears the mark of black,
I know i approache to the point of resolution.

So many time have passed since
i have been send to reveal of what's
been hidden so deep.
I've been buried with the others for 
the secret could sleep undone still.
Your experience failed and it's fruit 
rot down with the last drop of my blood.

Now i came back from the dark fields
to stare into the eyes once more,
and set my fire free.
For i'm the only one ,and the stars 
know about it.
