Water got cold just like my life.
The wander I proceed has turned circle again.
I'm in the beginning of it, or is it maybe the end ?
My heart tries to cheat destiny - once I meant they are
both entwine...

I know I have no time enough, to grant you with what
the fate once took away from me.
Water slowly gets the royal colour.
With the first hallucinations, visions come back,
some have haunted me for whole my life.

When my body is fighting, the mind is feeling serene
I haven't been given, like happiness which the fate
has once taken from me.

I remember the Saturday morning,
as I waited for you, as you rushed so much,
that finally you've never come to me.
I died with you, and fate made me the prisoner of flesh.
Now it has no meaning 'cause I bear that stone which pumps my blood.

[Ref.]

When the days flee together with memories
You've trying to paint my pain.
My face is changing never experienced of happiness.
Now you've laughing at me, 'cause you've sure
I 'll be still alive.
