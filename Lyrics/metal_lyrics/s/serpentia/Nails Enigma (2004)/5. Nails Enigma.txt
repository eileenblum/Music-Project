Abyss in that is suspended my soul,
It lives in me by itself,waits for new meat.
Nails are my cure ,I slowly stick them
into my flesh.

Would it be the only way to salvation?
...to salvation though pain and suffering?
On the dark way each relif is like a curse,
and the larvas wait for new blood...

Who's the one to torture me today?
Who's gonna disembowell that sadness
out of my soul?
Those about the stuppor,they'll not 
find the way.

Lost by word and deed they'll stand
unknown forever...
I'd like to know i feel,therefore
nails are nesessary to find the truth.

Freedom flavour allures me...
Who is that one ,whom I 'll give
the sign of cross now and forever?
Who will be blamed for my failure?
Who will let me rise up?

When the mummbles and moans turn to silence,
and the silence fill me -I will know the truth!
