The cold of your eyes has awoken me
once more, thoughts come back they make me 
remember that place,where I wait for you each 
another day of my defeat.

Something give me hazy hope just to reap me 
from the inside.
I yearn for the sleep so much that my lungs
are heavy of bitterness.

Once like the others I was waiting for wings,
I didn't know you've not the one who could see them.
On the dark fields i live and I deny of divinity.
I'm the part of the place I created

Why weren't you waiting for me, alone now,
somewhere there where your thoughts can't get in.
I know that the stigmats are the part of the ancient times,
They wouldn't allow you to come back and remind
-what the rain has wiped for so long ago.

For once more...
