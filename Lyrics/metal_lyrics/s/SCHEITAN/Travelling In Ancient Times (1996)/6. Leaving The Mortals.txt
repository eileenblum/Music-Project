Time had come to leave the mortal world
The only way to reach far beyond
My last word on earth were heared
I killed myself before the sun

I entered the realm of cosmos
as the five points stood high
I woke up in a timeless dimension
where good and evil were the sides

I found my armies in dimension hatred
For ages they had waited
and now was their time

Leaving the mortals,
to track down and kill Christ
Leaving the mortals,
to seek my hate beyond the skies

Our march began as my words were spoken:
This will be the last day of Christ
And there was a massive roar,
from my army of might
