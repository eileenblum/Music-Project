My sword was lifted,
as the first one came
so delightful - so splendid to rape
I cut her wide open,
tore her heart
My eyes they glimpsed,
this was blackened art

Riding forth, killing God
I'm in battle with angels
Riding forth, killing God
I shall never surrender

With my spear I killed the second
and father God mourned as hell
I watched him through
the black diamond
These pestilent disciples
never had a chance

The last one came forth
but she truly was a fallen one
She came to join my dark horde
the bride of mine she was to become
