On my pale horse I began the journey
through landscapes far beyond
I rode through vast forest
far away from the sun

I took a final glimse at the darklands,
these domains of mine
I marched through the opening
with tremendous pride

Riding to battle the christian lands
Riding to battle,
to tear apart the damned

Reaching the first of the villages
So weak they are in mind
I turned their fate in one day
with my bare hands

Riding to battle the christian lands
Riding to battle,
to tear apart the damned
