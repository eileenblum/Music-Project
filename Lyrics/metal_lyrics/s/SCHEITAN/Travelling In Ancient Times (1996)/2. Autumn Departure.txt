As the leaves fell I wandered forth
with naked trees surrounding me
I now began to reach the highlands
where frost had it's spheres

Time had come to leave a last greeting,
Azagh my friend, your work has been done,
it's time to travel far beyond
And my pale horse died with the smile of a warlock

Autumn slowly departured as I
climbed the frostbitten mountaintops
I felt my wrath become stronger,
for each day they lost their hope

Finally I was there,
at the highest point of them all
I could see all of the wastlands
while watching autumn fall

As the autumn departured,
the lambs of christ heared the last command
As autumn departured
they felt my blood on their hands
