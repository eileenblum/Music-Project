I entered the halls of heaven
I arised for a hunger for god's flesh
Blood to flow, pour it all arround me
Blasphemy destroy it all

Powers of evil
Birthday of darkness
Powers of evil
Dark is the path

Die! I crushed his skull with a hammer
I laughed high, this weak man was no god
I destroyed it all I devastated heaven
God he cried godness was no more

Mesmerized by the path of evil
Entered the halls of heaven
