I've got my scars, my marks of time
Now i've found it, the key of mine
I've travelled far I had to die
Now I own it, this land of mine

I've travelled long to reach this
this imaginary sight
I've lost all worths to be here
at the portals of might

I've seen all there's to see
all there's to hear
Now I'm free

I've been all there's to be
so dark it seems
dead I will be

I watch the dawn, the last of sight
this is truely the darkest night
Release my wrath for one last time
Destroy all living, final work of mine
