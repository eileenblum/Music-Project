I kept travelling forth as the season changed
Queen december brought crystals of ice
I was soon to reach crist domains
And commanded my shadows to rise

My lust for christian blood grew stronger
A hunger for blood and pain
Compassion I felt no longer
A deadly weapon in the winter rain

A beauty of darkest art
December at fullmoon
A beauty born of sinful hearts
December at fullmoon

In distance I watched them dance
And truly this was their last one
I moved closer at my first chance
And the angels stopped their song

A beauty of splendid art
December at fullmoon
A beauty born of sinful hearts
December at fullmoon
