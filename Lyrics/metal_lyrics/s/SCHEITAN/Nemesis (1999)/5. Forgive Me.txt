Never ever a dusted day that won't fall to failure
Never find that belonging stage in which you're my saviour
However I try things seem like you'd love to dismiss me
Wondering why, please tell could you care to kiss me?

When times are hard I just wanna go
To the other side and leave this
Private hell I always walk
If I go, say will you forgive me?
Doing it all just to show you time is right
Come on so say you don't leave me
Doing it all, even carved my blood in stone
If I go, then say you forgive me
