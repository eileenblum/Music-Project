Down the rivers where fury flow
I'll seek the dark, where death may glow
Gonna ride a last time, in the night
I'll thrive on evil, darkened ways
In case you wonder, don't care to stay
Gonna ride a last time, in the night

All alone I'll find my warpath
Kill them deadly darkened ways
Soon I'm gone, don't have much choice left
Going down the devils cage
And you'll always fail to treason
Such a sinful masquerade
And forever dark is the season
Cause I will bring the plague

Don't you weep when I'm gone
I'll never be your crimson joy
Gotta do the "one way", such a sin

Don't you plead forgiveness lady
(cause) once upon... your lips said maybe
It's a case of decision, such a fucking sin!
