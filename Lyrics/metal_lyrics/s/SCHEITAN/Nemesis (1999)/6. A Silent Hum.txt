Stand aside in a Capricorn night
Doing time while the eastern dies
Time slips, make it all seem far away

Watch the sun sing it's silent hum
Care for none as the season's shun
Time slips, make it all seem far away

And what will the blackwinds find
Well I thought... nevermind
Let's revel in dust cause time and tide
won't fail to leave us by
And what's there to left to say
Well I thought... it might wait one day
Let's revel in dust, come syringe seed
and sit to tell me why

Left to die in this autumn ride
Left in sight til' bereavement cries
Time slips, make it all seem far away
What's won when the season's gone
As the ancient's close the sun
Time slips, make it all seem far away
