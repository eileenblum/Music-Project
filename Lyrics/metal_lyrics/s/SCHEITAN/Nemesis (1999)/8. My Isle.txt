Could you take your time
Look into my eyes
Where angels die
There ain't no laughter
Don't be afraid, a reason to pray

Would you listen to
A little song or two
Where eagles fly
There ain't no heaven
Evil may scare, I believe I don't care

Don't you dare to sleep in time
To walk along this path of mine
To lay your hands in rotten soil
Deceive my mind, my thoughts to boil

Could you care to sail
Deep into my dreams
Where sorrow goes
There ain't no prayers
Life it may sway, joy to decay

Would you care to say
Just a while, so say
Where seconds die
My time keeps rolling
It's closing time, I'm leaving my isle
