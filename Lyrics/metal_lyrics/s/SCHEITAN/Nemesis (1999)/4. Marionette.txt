Too damn blind to see what's in front of you
All you ever asked for, it may come true
But well... join the master's game

Too damn frail to find a future too
All you ever wanted, ahead of you
Then again... you'd rather join the master's game

The theatre's open
Come on girl, welcome in and play
Don't you see? It's a sad thing
A marionette in the master's own game

Too damn scared to cut them strings that pull
They seem to last forever, and so I say:
Look away... into your own reality

So damn scared you've built a fortress too
Will you solve the riddle? The maiden tale
And tell... how long's a master game?
