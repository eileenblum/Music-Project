Dominate ways to say, it's an archway
A shot through the heart, going straight down the red lane
My way, I'd love to drag you down

Wasting my days, such a shame, (to) love the black rain
Run down the rail, being hit by a freighttrain
My way, I'd love to drag you down

Gonna end this way
Can't bring life to a higher stage
Without walking away
I'm forced to drag me down

(No) time to play games
Go away, let the sun fade
Dark is my hear, could you tell me the right way?
So say... would you drag me down?
I'm loosing the game, going straight down the red lane
Dark is a soul that's been hit by a lovetrain
So say... would you drag me down?
