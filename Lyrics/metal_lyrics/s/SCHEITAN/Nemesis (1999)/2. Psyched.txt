Have you ever seen them demons passing by?
Have you ever heard em laughing at your cries?

Fight back, such a solid wasteland
You'll never know where the reaper roams
Psyched out, such a solid statement
Going dead where them demons go

Going down the drain in time
To watch them monuments fall
And all you'll ever see is sorrow
Never find your way to go

Have you ever heard them angels singing bright?
Have you ever seen the beauty in their cries?
