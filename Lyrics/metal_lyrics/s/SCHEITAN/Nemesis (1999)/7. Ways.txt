I believe I won't love again
I believe I will hate the pain
In so many ways I prepared the fall
So goddamned hard to repair them all
Seems to me I was born to rage
We walk in different ways

Sunlight, emerged from sinless thorns
Far less than bright
Causing hell in a mind that's torn
The day died, emerged and laughed in scorn
Such a bitter sight
You and I, we'll make the devil mourn
I believe time is closing in
I believe I've paid my sins
Such a fragile state of mind my friend
I'd better fight the demons the devil send
Seems to me I've lost again
Guess I'll walk another way
