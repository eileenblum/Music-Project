Lights strike the sky
As the darkest of night's arrive a fiery sight
I'm alive, fresh is my blood
As the last humans cry
Bombes break the sky
A final raid to erase what's left behind
I'm in command, bombraid aver wastlands

Time to die, to kill the earth in time
To blow this holy place into oblivion

Words scream and cry
It's the day of darkness
And I have arrived
Torments strikes the night
My evil intensions and plans
Get locked in time
Forever say goodbye
Humanity ends, delightful, vicious sight
In my command, bombraid over wastlands
