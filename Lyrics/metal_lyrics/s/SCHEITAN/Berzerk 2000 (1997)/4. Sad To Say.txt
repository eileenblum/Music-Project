Can't help falling down when all my days are grey
Can't help falling down well it's sad to say
Running, screaming, adore the sight
Bleeding, washing away the night

Tell me could you care for a day of mine?
To watch the seconds sleep, to await the tide
Running, screaming adore the sight
Bleeding, washing away the night
