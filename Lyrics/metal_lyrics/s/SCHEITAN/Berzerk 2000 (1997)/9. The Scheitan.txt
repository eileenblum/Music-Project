My evil intensions and work has been done
No more life, I crushed the sun
No more living or dying
No more laughing or crying
Death to all, it was my dream
I've succeeded, It seems
Past conturies, I had my time
Spawned by evil I rised

I lived the spawn of scheitan
I saw it all arise
I have not forsaken
In charge of life's demise

Time to leave, to witness the end
Time to die, never rising again
Leave the earth, never rising again
Leave the earth, never live it again
I will greet the end
