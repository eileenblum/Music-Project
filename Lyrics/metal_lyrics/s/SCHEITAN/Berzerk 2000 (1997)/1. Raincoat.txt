Hell is getting closer, no love no doors open
Will you save me with a raincoat? Keeping all levels safe
And when dying feels ok, ill leave with a safe way
Will you save me with a raincoat? Keep me away from the gate
Could you please go home and leave me alone with my pain

Do I scare you when running away
Left alone in the dark where no angels stay
Caught in prison called time
Will you leave or wait from my sign?
And all I ever do is drain
All those memories who scare in the autumn rain
To bad I have a mortal spine
Who still care for things not of mine
