Back again, for to long closed in slumber
Armed with thunder and lightning
To make the end
What I give is pain, receive my final hatred
It's the night of scheitan
The berzerk has arrived

They're blown away, machine guns bring the thunder
I'm alone disciple (of) all living end
My clips are full, with delight I pull the trigger
A futuristic war, not heaven sent

I arrive with fiery hordes
As lightnings strikes the sky
One assault, all is gone
Wings attack at night

Destroying, all I left behind
Devastatig, all corners of time
