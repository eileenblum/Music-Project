Ever got a feeling that love may scare
That love is evil and evil don't care
Ever losen hope in a silent scream
Everyday I do in my dreams

More than anything, anything
I'm trying not to wonder, trying not to care
Love is but a sting - devils thing
In peace I never wonder, neither do I care
Never again shall I dare

But on the soulside, soulside
I might see you again
Where no evil hunt the lifetide
May I call you friend?
