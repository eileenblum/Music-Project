Deep down my mind
Here in the dark
Is not a first time that I fight my heart

Akin to joy
Turning into defeat
I try to breath even knowing I canât

My faith, your face
All seems to fade...

Crying out tomorrow
Living scenes
In the dark
Missing you!

Once back to life
Dealing with the pain
Daylight have sometimes a thick cold blood taste

Shadows of this ghost
That used to be my life
Hunted my old me leave with no more pride

Your smile, my grief
All seems to colide...

Crying out tomorrow
Living scenes
In the dark
Missing you!
How can someone fall so hard from sorrow?

Living scenes
In the dark
Wishing you!

Oh...
I wonât let us go...
You canât count with me
âcos iâll be there
Showing you
That we still can be!

Living scenes
In the dark
Wishing you!
How can someone fall so hard from sorrow?
Living scenes
In the dark
Wishing you!
