Is not a first time i die by your hands
Or live through your eyes that blasts me with anger!
You fill my chest with black smoke and spite
And for my little gains, I fell your hate burning!
Masquerades every smile and cheer,
Your bless is a curse...
But your envy feeds me!

Hum...
Makes me swear to you...

Is not a first time I fake a smile
Or dodge anyone who tries to damn my life!
So I live today and pay my own sins
I won't hide hide from you
'Cos my will is immortal!

Hum...
Makes me swear to you
Your hate shines bright my star

I pray for you
Be someone new
I'm asking you to involve your heart!
'Cos time shows you
That nothing can't be between me
And my immortal flame!

(The Xaman's speech:
I pray for your soul
To involve and glow
'Cos the force is constantly upon us
Showing you
That my will is immortal)

I pray for you
Be someone new
I'm asking you to involve your heart!
'Cos time shows you
That nothing can't be between me
And my immortal will...
