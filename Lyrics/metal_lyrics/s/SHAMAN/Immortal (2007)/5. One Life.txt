Sun light
A new day is rising
Calling me, hearing me
I know the brightness are path to the knowledge
locking the sun light

Why
Why some of us hear this voice
Even if too long shows
Where it all began

Nothing just goes
On this line
Like in feel strain flows
we're all going back to the start
An endless full circle

Beyond our mind and our soul
Is where lives are controlled
Lifetimes of clash breath inside
Always so nervous

Signs of this future
living here
Dreams from tomorrow
Made by the fire
of the age

In this universe
Through the sunshine way
All kinds of life are the same
In this time line
Through the spinned days
All have been denying that sword
Restful hide
