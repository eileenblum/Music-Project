So now I know
I wonât slow down
My mind will collapse unless I got it!

I canât think straight
Canât concentrate
These things just wonât let me sleep at night...
Waiting for something new

Please Lord!
Help me cross the whole way!
Point me to a better place to get where I should be!

Day by day
I wake up and think
That this is the day that will define me

So now I know...
How far I go!
No matter how hard and long the road goes...
Nothing will take it from me

Please Lord!
Help me cross the whole way!
Point me to a better place to get where I should be!

I swear!
This dream made up my choice!
I just want to live my life and feel alive
As long as I have...

Strength to carry on
Among the losses moving on
Let it go from sorrow
Nothing stops my heart
Strength to carry on
Among the losses
Dreams will rule!!!
