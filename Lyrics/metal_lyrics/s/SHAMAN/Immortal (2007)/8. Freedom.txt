If you never believe in me
So how do you want me to be?
All I have is my own air...

If never you kept some distance
So how you want me to live?
Trust in something beautiful
As long as we both have it!

Hum...
Every step of this way we choose...
I could feel in my neck every link of the chain!

If your heart is aching
So can you imagine my life?
Living day dreams in cage...

If you always believed in us
So how come are you crying again?
Time is something you can't go back
At least for this we had!

Hum...
Every step of this way we choose...
I could die in your arms and tomorrow be back in the
game... Oh yeah!!!

All this time I had to pray
To spread my wings and fly away!
'Cos our lives had to be choked up
Even I sometimes can't buy that
I just tried to realize what freedom really is?

All this time I had to pray
To spread my wings and fly away!
'Cos our lives had to be choked up
Even I sometimes can't buy that
I just tried to realize what freedom really is?
I'm just trying to be free!!!
