So many times I got here
So many times I had to bleed
Crawling and waiting for my...
Chance to charge in silence!

Locking and loading my fate
I have my flair to the wind
History waits for my name...
Be engraved by my own blood!

Pulsing with the land
Anger boiling in the veins
Accurating my aim...
Staking out for the prey!

Becoming friends with the mist
Becoming something else that breathes
Thirsty ready to take place!

Identified goal
Last time to decide: Friend or foe
Right now is just me and you...
Heads up! Coming...!

Burning wish...
Your heart in my hands!
Cold Desire...
My prize: Your head!

So many times I got here
I have my flair to the wind
Accurating my aim...
Instinct ready to take place!

Locking and loading my fate
Becoming something else that breathes
Pulsing with the land
Heads up! Comming...!

Burning wish...
Your heart in my hands!
Cold Desire...
My prize: Your head!
