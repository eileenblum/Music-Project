No matter what, 'cos my heart feels...
This time this line will be fulfilled
If there was no the spot,
For Sure here's the right one!

Once more I'm beggin' for a chance
Once here, they'll never be the same
Therefore we can't forget
Just how this world change us!

And then there's no turning back
No one will bend our fate!

No matter how, 'cos now I know
Sometimes we could be our own foes
If now is not the time
So when can I have this?

And then I'll feel alive
And realize this time is

Now...
No one can't live my life
What matters is what I do
It defines who I am!

Oh, now I have to feel alive
Whatever my fears may say
If I yield it won't be me!

Fight hard for your rights
Just do not give in!
Fight hard for your life
Go! You might get there...
Fight, fight, then more fight
Just, just never never yield!

Trough the mind...
Flying...
Growing wisdom and peacefulness
To realize how small we are
In front of this huge power
Neither pride, nor ego can prevail

Now...
No one can't live my life
What matters is what I do
It defines who I am

Oh, now I have to feel alive
Whatever my fears may say
If I yield it won't be me!
