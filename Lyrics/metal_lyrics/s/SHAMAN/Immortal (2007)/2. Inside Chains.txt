You fall
Hollow visions push you
Into a well of darkness
Thereâs no escaping from the fear

Weakness
All the senses fail
While seeking for the soul
This feeling inside hurts the flesh

Wish for the air
âCos nobody will breathe for you!

Whispers
Voices in your head are screaming
And shouting too loud
You start to like them as a friend

Your mind
Bringing hate so close
Slowly poisoning the heart
Anger becomes your ally

Search for the light
You are what you think
About yourself

Try again
Let the spirit move on
And those wounds will never return
Back to the flesh

Leave the cave
Climb up the wall
Break up your inside chains
