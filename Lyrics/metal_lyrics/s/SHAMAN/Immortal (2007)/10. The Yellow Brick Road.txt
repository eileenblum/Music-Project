Solitary night with the stars
Alone with my thoughts
Moments and flashes of my life
Some great, some OK
And they all show me who I amâ¦

Looking for words to describe
How proud Iâve became
All that was lost, I let go
Real peace lies within
And thereâs nothing more for me to wishâ¦

Oh!
Follow the yellow brick road
Then youâll find
All of those things you ever wanted
And moreâ¦
Follow the yellow brick road
Love can bring to youâ¦

Everything
In this world
All is connected by life
And you know life is love!

Now
Here we are
All that we need to do
Is to never give up
These wounds just make you stronger
Life is pain, but also love, oh!

Oh!
Follow the yellow brick road
Then youâll find
All of those things you ever wanted
And moreâ¦
Follow the yellow brick road
Then youâll find
Everything in life!
