Eyes glazed, facking deeply
What the mirror make you be
Blinded by this blind shell
That someone think it's right for yourself

Ego make you kneel
No room for your soul
Thoughts won't let you grow
It feeds your pain and emptiness

Wipe out all this lime and mold
All inherited from society
Mind is extra-weight, unload !
Free to ride through existence

Eyes glazed, wide awake
Staring at what you could be
Blinded by the despair
That your mind put there selfishlessly

The lamp isn't real
It's light, for sure
Thoughts will overflow
'Till it drowned your heart and soul !

Wipe out all this lime and mold
All inherited from society
Mind is extra-weight, unload !
Free to ride through existence
