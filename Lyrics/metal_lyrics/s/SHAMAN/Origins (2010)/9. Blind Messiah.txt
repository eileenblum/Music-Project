I know, deny my path won't buy me more time
When pages are being flipped.
Time shows, that life will never let me run and hide
Nature always wins!

If Instinct roars or mind gets loaded, the signal will be lost
Self-awareness is way beyond from surface of the heart.

Mirror There's nothing there 'till you let yourself go
Hook up with the Whole
Flux line can be distorted but never can be broke
Life has its float!

Inner-self is overweighed, unless your heart goes on
Love is much more then a word, that's something to live for

If I have it all on my shoulders
Then I'll find relief, just letting' myself go
Sprouting from the seed !
Beyond the eyes where light has no shore
At the higher call !
As a Blind Messiah I go

When toughts and needs are all gone, what's left is raw and pure
Real meaning is unknown, unless you hit the core

If I have it all on my shoulders
Then I'll find relief, just letting myself go
Sprouting from the seed !
Beyond the eyes where light has no shore

Now that I know, what I am here for and to where I go
My blindness was cured by 'seeing meaning'
At the higher call !
