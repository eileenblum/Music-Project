Well, I'm here... I did it!
Destiny fulfilled.
This quest stripped out of me
All I had...
So embrace me, please, I insist...
Hold this new born being that is me.

Old lake, new ground
Before the past, beyond now
Old wind, new found way to blow...

Time and time again
Things kept falling down
All that blood I gave
Never brought me anything more than hate...
What has left of me is all yours now!

Old lake, new ground
Before the past, beyond now
Old wind, new found way to blow...
Yeah!!
Old lake, new ground
Where we're standing still, it's not now
Sign, sealed and delivered

No more than a leaf trying
To resist the breeze's swiping...
From the stone to diamond!

Old lake, new ground
Before the past, beyond now
Old wind, new found...
Where we're standing still, it's not now
Sign, sealed and delivered
