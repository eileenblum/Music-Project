Cold feet, nosebleed, cracked lips,
Lost, yet still alive...
Living through this image floating in front of me

Mesmerized by this view...
Sinking lives away into this vision
All those can break down this connection has to disappear
I'm feeling like a God
So I let myself dive
Yeah, into darkness, oh yeah

Let my breath be taken
Smoothly turning into despair
Oh, now I can see...
My image is drowning me !
