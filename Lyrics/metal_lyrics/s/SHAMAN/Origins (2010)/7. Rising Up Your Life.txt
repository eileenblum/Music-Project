Tired from this errand...
Another dead end
The sun has set too soon today
Inside of me
This new horizon shows no shores,
Loneliness, uncertainty and
Everything seams to grow around me

The whole world is shaking over
That last small breach breaks away
Light kisses my face, as invade all my soul
Rising up to life!

Broke cocoon
The coziness now it's over
All ahead is new!

All alone
Yet at heart felling older
Now I've found my own
All the doors are open!

The whole world is shaking over
That last small breach breaks away
Light heats my face, as invades all my soul
Rising up to life !
