Nightmares, heavy breathe
Feels like twilight zone
No one can help me,
Unless I wake up

I can't feel my arms
Everything else is so cold
Blinded by this veil,
For sure I was marked and cursed
Oh yeah !

Baptized by black rain
Heart consumed by terror
No way, this ain't me,
I am what I live for

All my will is cursed
What's left of me is pain
Please make it go away,
I swear I'll be good !
No matter where I am
These dark clouds have no intent to go away !
It all makes sense now

The mind itself, it play tricks on you
The mind is hell, the stage is set for you
No will, just woe, please, meet your frantic foe
The mind is hell, it's the Inferno Veil !
