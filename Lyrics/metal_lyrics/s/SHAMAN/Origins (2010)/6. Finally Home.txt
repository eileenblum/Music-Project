From where I cam, or where I go
All in between I supposed
Will live on ! Live on and on !

Ashes to ashes, this nonstop dance
What is in between will remain
Converging points, drawing away

Life has always been this way
Recycling thought what seems to be the end !

Frosted in time by its flow
Right between known and unknown
(Dancing away)
Connected by soul and love
Beyond everything in this world
(All is subtle)
When less is more, where life overcome

Oh, nothing is home
Oh, silence will take me

Home ! I've realized where I am !
Where light and darkness are the same

Finally I'm home
Finally I found where I am !
Where eyes can't draw or interpret
