Look around, what do you see?
Caught up in humility?
Too many souls are on their own
Fallen angels moving on

There's more to get, more to find
Feelings of another kind
The choice is set, take it soon
For even you won't be immune now

I'd count it a miracle
If I ever see your smile
Throw away your illusions, dear
Don't keep trusting your own lies

Who's in command of your heart?
Of your hope?
Past thoughts are vague
As they soar high and low

Yet someday, still alive
You will find a will to strive
For someone else will come along
To lift you up, to right the wrong

And you will see within your eyes
Figures that comes back to life
You'll touch the wounds that never heal
Love is raw, it's not for real

I'd count it a miracle
If I ever see your smile
Throw away your illusions, dear
Let me hold you for a while

Who's in command of your heart, of your hope?
Past thoughts are vague, running out of control

There was a time when the fields were green
The world was one, life was filled with something
There was a blue sea, on the horizon
There was a dream of a lasting fire
We bottomed out, life's become so cruel
Along the way, a regardless torment
Is there a cause that we would die for?
Is there a place where the spirit lives on?

Who's in command of your heart, of your hope?
Past thoughts are vague, running out of control
There's more to know and there's much more beyond
The faith that you've lost you will find on your own
