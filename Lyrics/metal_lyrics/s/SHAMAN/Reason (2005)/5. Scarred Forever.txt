There's a chance for you and me
Further away from this believe
When the prayers reach the sky
Cause I know man that you will cry no more

Run, running away, falling apart
Thunder of fate colliding

Everyday I see your face
Through my empty I met this grace
When it's cracking up inside
Cause I know man that you will cry no more

Run, running away, falling apart
Fear of the heart now turning two
Shadows of day out in the dark
Fury scarred forever

And always empty nights are left behind
Always the moment is right you can't deny your faith
Deny your faith

[Guitar solo]

The hatefull lair disturbs the sky
It's time to say goodbye
Along the way a wishing well
Turn off the light let us have
Our last goodbye and then

Run, running away, falling apart
Fear of the heart of turning two
Shadows of day out in the dark
Fury scarred forever

Always empty nights are left behind
Always the moment is right you can't deny your faith
Deny your faith
Deny your faith
