Flowing down inside the stream
Blowing all around
Like another day of spring
Spreading out through the ground

Changing seasons come and go
Before and after life
And the sun will set again
Bringing out the darkest night

Only made to disappear?
Life's a rough stone
And the future, unclear

Wait for the day of your life
That you will meet the unknown
There's nowhere else to go
Wait for the truth, not a lie
It will meet you alone
End of all illusion

Only made to disappear?
Life's a rough stone
And the future, right here
So much pain, suffering and strife
Mystery of death
Brings a new man to life
