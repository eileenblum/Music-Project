You touched yourself with fire
Touching someone else
Your well is dry, you cry out
In search of more success
You left your thoughts in darkness
And one day they'll return
Some other kind of lesson would be good to learn

Don't get all down on me
Don't ever turn away!

Break trough your barriers
Sharpened, diamond-cut
Again you're trapped in lies
Or simply misunderstood?

Just tell me what you need now
To be that someone else
Is that another desire?
It will be your last?

Don't get all down on me
Don't ever turn away!

Leave me alone
Seeds now are raised and grown
Guide me today
Then turn away

Leave me alone
Seeds now are raised and grown
Play me today
Use me, then turn away

Don't get all down on me
Don't ever turn away!

Leave me alone
Seeds now are raised and grown
Guide me today
Then turn away
