I looked inside me
To find myself
To purify me
To cease the pain

[chorus:]
Across that river
A life goes by
Look inside the mirror
And you will find out

In solitude I was born
It terrified me
A veil of mist right before my eyes

I walked in shadows
I drowned in rain
I met the desert and I'm born again

[chorus]

In solitude I was born
It crucified me
Wearing a crown of thorns

I am free now, born to be a man
Emptiness made me understand
What lay hidden deep within

I am free now, born to be the man
Loveliness brushed away the sand
From what's hidden deep within
Shapeless dream without a name
Wrapped in frozen layers of life
Sings the song of what we all are
