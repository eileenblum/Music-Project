Not for a day
Not for a while
You run alone you never satisfied
Oh you've been dreaming for a hundred years

So you begin
To understand
That your lifetime is running through your hands
Oh! Will forgive you for this Trail of tears

There you go out

Someone to know
Easy to find
Full feel your hearts will blew of many kinds
Only will change it for its train of shore

There you go
Hearing voices and noises to go
There you stand
Back in time every hour once begin
There you walk and then...

After a shock
Time to recompose
No bleeding heart
"So the screamings that you feel"

Oh! Will forgive you for this Trail of tears

There you go
Hearing voices and noises to go
There you stand
Back in time every hour once begin
There you walk, my friend!
