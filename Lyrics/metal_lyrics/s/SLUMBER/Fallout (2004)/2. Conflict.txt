cathode rays of sunlight burning in my face
evolution thru convergence
a conflict bred inside

intrigued by desperation
a final struggle yet to fight
as my escape draws nearer
for my retreat to breach the brim

i taint the thoughts of ignorance
unfeed the soil on which i stand
undress my mind from the sting
open the gates, and leave all hope

chaotic atmospherics
repel my rusted mind
all the prints are turned pitch black
a conflict born outside

the hollow trails from what was we
torn apart by an endless tear
i've already been on the inside
reaching out for none
