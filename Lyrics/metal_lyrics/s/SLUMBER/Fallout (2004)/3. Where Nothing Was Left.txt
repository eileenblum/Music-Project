endless halls
deep bottomless corridors
where i have crawled through years of cold dead decay
reaching for something i could never hold onto
gripping around something so withering and fragile

i abused myself to a point where nothing was left
my days had become so gray and colorless
slowly the ashes where sweeping around me
falling deeper and deeper into dusk
now i realize my soul was tainted (in disgrace)

so hard a surface, yet so easily broken...
torn apart by truth and its sickening touch
words came out but were painfully spoken
i never knew it would hurt so much

so hard a surface, yet so easily broken...
