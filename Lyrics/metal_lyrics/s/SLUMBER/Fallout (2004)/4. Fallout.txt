from birth placed in a mad society
feeding on illusions
speaking a tongue of misconceptiousness
forging a machinery of indoctrination

i have found the lock to my golden chain
now where is that key?
is this evolution?
is this the long road of the fallen?
i tried to grab on to life but it flows like water
see my name written in heroin

open eyes, corrupted minds
falling up down from my world
closed eyes, a dying mind
conspiracy, the way to rebirth
break the walls of truth
fallout!

fading.. anguished..
throw me in a sea of filth
