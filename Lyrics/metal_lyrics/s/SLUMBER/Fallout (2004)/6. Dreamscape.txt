in the night when all the pain embraces my heart
when all the fear echoes in my head
i dream myself away clouds of despair
a hand, reaching for help in emptinessin emptiness..

enter the realms of dreaming
a seed of tragedies and tears
silently; dreaming
silently; dreaming my way through

lying in my shelter, beyond mortal being
no one can see, no one can touch
no more fear of crying, for eternity
what's left, is a fantasy world
beyond reality
