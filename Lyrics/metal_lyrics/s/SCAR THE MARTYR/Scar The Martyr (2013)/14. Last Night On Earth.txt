Now I say, do what thou will,
Nightmarish requiem
Pierce the skin as you scream,
Just like the slaughter of pigs
Mask the pain, crown the king,
It's all coming undone
In nothingness, I'm every dream,
I'm everything you never were

Fall, into the cracks of the world
Your kingdom never comes.
It's up to us, it's up to us
Gone, feels like the end of the world
Your kingdom never comes,
Keep crawling to its core
It's our last night on earth

Content to scourge the obscene, impale the nemesis
Lash the spin &amp; the spleen,
Thrown out like scraps to the wind
Atrocity &amp; Disease, a ruthless warrior's ruin
In nothingness, I'm every dream,
I'm everything you'll never be

We fight the horror, cause it's all that we can do
We fear tomorrow, but that won't save us from our doom
With blood* and thunder, we tread the waters
The sky is broken, Keep crawling to its core
It's our last night on earth
