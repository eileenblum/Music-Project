...and so I beckon the seas
The clamor of voices wash over me
The crashing waves of hope, give labour to love
Makes a spiritual beggar that cries out to God
...tied to the ashes you leave
Bleed all of my vessels and pick my bones clean
Pending transgressions, plow the soul from the earth
As I breathe in the venom, she enters my lungs

Under a sea of stars, you're casting your anchor
But you're sinking down...
The sacrilege of everything you hold sacred
Fades without a sound...

Worlds apart and miles away, Cruel ocean: Will you lead us?
To make our final resting place...

...and so I beckon the seas
I beg for your mercy and serenity
Salt in my wounds, I let your spell take control
In the calm of your essence, a spirit is born

Under a sea of stars, you're casting your anchor
But you're sinking down...
The sacrilege of everything you hold sacred
Fades without a sound...

Worlds apart and miles away, Cruel ocean: Will you lead us?
Our hearts are washed upon the shore.

And now there's oceans in between. I watch you slip away.
Go cleanse yourself of all the pain, but it won't wash away [2x]


Worlds apart and miles away, Cruel ocean: Will you lead us?
To make our final resting place.
Worlds apart and miles away, Cruel ocean: Will you lead us?
Our hearts are washed upon the shore. [2x]
