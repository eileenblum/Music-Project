[B-Side Track]Take the face, and wisdoms of your father
Take his place, enter further after
Be the slave, crippled at the alter
Taken shape, running the from the rapture
(save yourself, from yourself, from his system)

'Cause so many who worship sheep
Theyâre drowning in the fire
With the secrets that you keep
Can't be your saviour

No more pain, the eye of your beholder
Penetrate, the skin it turns to matter
Laid to waste, the spawn of your dominions
Infiltrate, the angel and the mordum

'Cause so many who worship sheep
Theyâre drowning in the fire
With the secrets that you keep
Can't be your saviour

Taken the toll, you've crossed the path that is forsaken
Lost all control, can't find your way back home
After the fall, become the hurt that you created
Lost all control, can't find your way back home

CAN'T FIND YOUR WAY BACK!

Depict the soul, dismiss the storm
There's nothing here that's sacred [2x]

[Guitar solo]

Taken the toll, you've crossed the path that is forsaken
Lost all control, can't find your way back home
After the fall, become the hurt that you created
Lost all control, can't find your way back home

CAN'T FIND YOUR WAY BACK! [2x]
