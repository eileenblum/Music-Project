Another punch to the gut,
Another three steps back
I swear it's never ending,
I should've never placed my bets on you
Another push and a pull, A fog of war and attack
I should've seen it coming,
The whole thing's going to hell, All thanks to you

Oh, when I put my faith in you, I sold my soul for you
Oh, I should've never put my trust in you,
That's when I sold my soul for you,
Like a broken man, I'll take the beating

I'm never gonna forgive...
Now we're dead, yeah it's over,
Why you still got something to prove
Girl you better redeem yourself,
I told you once before that we're through,
I'm never gonna forget...
Now it's sad that we're over,
But you know you had it coming to you
You know that I can't pretend,
I'm never gonna forgive, I'm never gonna forget

You got me nailed to the gun, another stab in the back
I should've known your better, took me for granted,
Played me like a fool
You've had your chance,
It was fun and now you're wanting me back
I think I'll see you later
The whole thing's going to hell, All thanks to you
