[B-Side Track]Question our loyalty, a darkness descends
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN IT FROM THE START
The downward spiral I've seen, my only friend
THE THORN IN MY SIDE HAS PIERCED MY HEART
I HAVE NEVER FORGIVEN, ALL THE YEARS OF RESENTMENT
EVERY OUNCE OF FREEDOM IS THE TRUTH
TIP THE SCALES OF THE SYSTEM, AND THE TREATMENT OF RESISTANCE
MURDER EVERYTHING, THE ENEMY LIVES IN YOU

The many men, the chosen, wear a disguise
Into the state of solitude
Symbol of hatred, where your maker resides
For all will what the grief consumes

BRING DOWN THE WALL PRINTS, STONE AND VILE
THEYâRE GONNA LEAD US TO OUR DOOM
YOUR TRINITY OF TRUTH AND LIES
POWER OF GRIEF COMPELS YOU

System of slavery, disgust and dispel
STRIPPED OF OUR EQUAL RIGHTS, WE'RE ROBBED
A new world order again which quick went for sale
BLOOD MONEY SCAB, WE CAN'T BE BOUGHT

The many men, the chosen, wear a disguise
Into the state of solitude
Symbol of hatred, where your maker resides
For all will what the grief consumes

We're doomed forever now, bow down before the burning bridges, crumble away [3x]

The many men, the chosen, wear a disguise
Into the state of solitude
Symbol of hatred, where your maker resides
For all will what the grief consumes [2x]

BRING DOWN THE WALL PRINTS, STONE AND VILE
THEYâRE GONNA LEAD US TO OUR DOOM
YOUR TRINITY OF TRUTH AND LIES
POWER OF GRIEF COMPELS YOU

FOR ANOTHER TYRANNY OF TRUTH
ANOTHER TRINITY OF LIES [2x]
