Forbidden fortress, kneel to the lamb
Bodies lay lifeless, their faces stare
Your hall of mirrors, drag all the waters
Unearth to offer, buried in glass

An all new law, it's like we're looking down the barrel of a loaded gun
Unleash my woes upon the world,
I sing the sorrow for the sinners &amp; their sacred song
An all new law, noble apostle on the altar,
I'm the chosen one. An all new law

My retribution, for what I've done,
My retribution, for what I've lost

Thine evil forces, the clock strikes twelve
Covered in corpses, under the veil
Whore of the hour, heart of the devil
Mark of the master, seek my revenge

An all new law, it's like we're looking down the barrel of a loaded gun
Unleash my woes upon the world,
I sing the sorrow for the sinners &amp; their sacred song
An all new law, noble apostle on the altar,
I'm the chosen one. An all new law

My retribution, for what I've done,
My retribution, for what I've lost

The hearts of darkness, fragile as they seem
They long for more, they're bursting at the seams
The fear that fuels the despair, it's so disheartening
It this feels like redemption, I'm free

An all new law, it's like we're looking down the barrel of a loaded gun
Unleash my woes upon the world,
I sing the sorrow for the sinners &amp; their sacred song
An all new law, noble apostle on the altar,
I'm the chosen one. An all new law
