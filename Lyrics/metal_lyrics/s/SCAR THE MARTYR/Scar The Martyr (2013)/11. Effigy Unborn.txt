You are my lord of the flies
Puncture wounds, carve out the eyes
Through you, live out my demise, decomposition
I wanna peel back the skin, to see the real you within
Remains are all that is left, No legacy to protect
You are the brain, I'm the bride
Unchained, you're burning inside
Slither and crawl through the bile, resuscitation
Tear you apart, limb from limb
I wanna dissect the kill, to cure the sickness within
Sever the sun, disconnect

I feel it slipping away, it's tearing me from the inside out
Separation of faith, I've fallen too deep now
The stench of moral decay...

I'm gonna wear your love, just like a funeral
You are my effigy unborn
I'm gonna wear your love, just like a funeral
You are my effigy unborn
I'll wear your face, nameless to the world...
Gives every meaning to live with your words

I feel it slipping away, it's tearing me from the inside out
Separation of faith, I've fallen too deep now
The stench of moral decay...

I'm gonna wear your love, just like a funeral
You are my effigy unborn
I'm gonna wear your love, just like a funeral
You are my effigy unborn
I'll wear your face, nameless to the world...
Gives every meaning to live with your words

I feel as dead as yesterday in my mind
This pre-existing compulsion forces free the quilt I cannot hide
At last, alone in the sound, of screams, the shrieking surrounds
In my insanity, the voices cover me like a shroud

An unborn effigy, Sleep in your palace of worms
The hellish imagery, An effigy unborn.

I feel it slipping away...

[Chorus 2x]
