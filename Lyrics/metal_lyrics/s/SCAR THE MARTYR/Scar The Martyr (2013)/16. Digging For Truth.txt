[Bonus Track]Abduct the family, we're going for a drive (they're going for the code)
We're plannin' your escape, it's like a scene of a crime (the devil that you know)
Yeah you're rolling out floors, like they're not too fab, it's the same old crap for you
Yeah you look so fine, with a suit and tie, you were diggin' for the truth

You're gonna fade away with time
You'll never hold out long
You're such a bore, make up your mind
This song it doesn't suck
I'm so strong, not insane
You're kicking the dead horse baby!
We're dead, but not today
YOU KEEP ON DIGGING FOR THE TRUTH BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE IT!

We're gearing up to leave, no working sign of life
The time has lost its glow
Swallowed the bitter feel, you know it takes all kinds (Your laugh is a freakshow)
Yeah you're rolling out floors, like they're not too fab, it's the same old crap for you
Yeah you look so fine, with a suit and tie, you were diggin' for the truth

You're gonna fade away with time
You'll never hold out long
You're such a bore, make up your mind
This song it doesn't suck
I'm so strong, not insane
You're kicking the dead horse baby!
We're dead, but not today
YOU KEEP ON DIGGING FOR THE TRUTH BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE IT! [2x]

[Guitar Solo]

Dead and full speed ahead, we're gonna set this town on fire
Full fledged back from the dead, just like with children of the night [2x]

Your gonna fade away with time
You'll never hold out long
You're such a bore, make up your mind
This song it doesn't suck
I'm so strong, not insane
You're kicking the dead horse baby!
We're dead, but not today
YOU KEEP ON DIGGING FOR THE TRUTH BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE IT
