[Bonus Track][originally by Killing Joke]See the sun turn green
From my penthouse window
It's different now
'Cause you've got no shelter
Alienation
By experimentation
Enjoy yourself
This is the new age

Complications [4x]

Ransom the birth
Of a new destruction
It's different now
It's what we always wanted
Alienation
Self-destruct
At the count of ten

Complications [4x]

See the sun turn green
From my penthouse window
It's different now
'Cause you've got no shelter
Alienation
By experimentation
Enjoy yourself
This is your new age

Complications [8x]
