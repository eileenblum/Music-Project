I am the Alpha and the second coming
Fundamental discovery, for the need to create and control
Seek no others, forms or cures before me
Supernatural beings, all encompassing forces foretold

Every martyr crucified, All disciples are denied
Gone is all that's sanctified, justified, redefined
All that's burning deep inside, see the future that you hide
The Universal divide, time is mine, your mind's eye

I'm the Omega, granted you don't know me
Monumental misfortune, for the judgment of swing and lost souls
In the wake upon the eve of destruction,
Plant the seeds of my offering,
Let the order of chains control

Every martyr crucified, All disciples are denied
Gone is all that's sanctified, justified, redefined
All that's burning deep inside, see the future that you hide
The Universal divide, time is mine, your mind's eye

The universal divide, in search of strength and meaning
Sewn from the seeds of your mind, progression of our being.
The universal divide, in search of strength and meaning:
A revelation of time

Degeneration, my definition of yourself
Transcend the faceless, another wasted space [2x]

Every martyr crucified, All disciples are denied
Gone is all that's sanctified, justified, redefined
All that's burning deep inside, see the future that you hide
The Universal divide, time is mine, your mind's eye

The universal divide, in search of strength and meaning
Sewn from the seeds of your mind, progression of our being.
The universal divide, in search of strength and meaning:
A revelation of time

All we are, we'll be again...
Just find yourself and life begins [4x + Outro]
