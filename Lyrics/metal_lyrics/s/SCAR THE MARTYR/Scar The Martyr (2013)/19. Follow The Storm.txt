[B-Side Track]Driven by this desire, reveals your fate
Growing a second skin, reveals your true face
Rescape the rife that colls, a stool, a grave
Watching the death unfold, what thrill it creates

YOU ONLY SEE YOURSELF
DISGUISED AS SOMEONE ELSE [2x]

You could kill off this disease inside, ill be
Be the hope I've waited for so long
Come the fear that feeds the beast in me
Seize the morning and follow the storm

Sinking into the earth, life slips away
Drifting out as you foll, your soul, decays

You could kill off this disease inside, ill be
Be the hope I've waited for so long
Come the fear that feeds the beast in me
Seize the morning and follow the storm

YOU ONLY SEE YOURSELF
DISGUISED AS SOMEONE ELSE [2x]

You could kill off this disease inside, ill be
Be the hope I've waited for so long
Come the fear that feeds the beast in me
Seize the morning and follow the storm
