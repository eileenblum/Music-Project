There's blood on your hands and you're trying to save me
It's your second chance, but you can't save me now
You've done what you can, with a kiss to betray me
So the story goes...What you gonna do now that you're falling
Fallen, just like me...What you gonna do
Now that you're crawling on your hands and knees

My walls are tumbling down, no hope to be found.
I'm breaking down...and I've got nowhere to go.
Tumbling down, walls are tumbling down.
I'm breaking down...and I've got nowhere to go.

I'm dead where you stand, you're so quick to forsake me
The shell of a man, the vows are broken now
We've come to an end, At rest, our love is a memory...
So the story goes...What you gonna do now that you're falling
Fallen, just like me...What you gonna do
Now that you're crawling on your hands and knees

My walls are tumbling down, no hope to be found.
I'm breaking down...and I've got nowhere to go.
Tumbling down, walls are tumbling down.
I'm breaking down...and I've got nowhere to go.

In your word, I never wanted to...
But I hurt the way that I hurt you

[Chorus 2x]
