A servant's oath, to serve your every wish I will
A servant's oath, Sanctum of loyalty I give
Feast of the flesh to mask the art

Pain is your pleasure, empowered by the powerless
You are my master, lord of betrayal &amp; loneliness

A broken soul, it is our bond held by these chains
A broken soul, but I'd never leave you here this way

Prayer for prey, it's in your name, in vain of gospels
Prayer for prey, the cross I bear, I'll bury it for you (repeat)
No pride, I have worn this crown for you
You could always heal my wounds, but you can't stop the bleeding
On trial, you can't hide me from the truth
You could always heal my wounds, but you can't stop the bleeding

Sin is your savior, my scars are all that you have left
Sick as your secrets, behind these eyes, you're someone else
Behind these eyes, you're someone else.

You could always heal my wounds.
You can't hide me from the truth
you can't stop the bleeding. Oh

[Chorus]
