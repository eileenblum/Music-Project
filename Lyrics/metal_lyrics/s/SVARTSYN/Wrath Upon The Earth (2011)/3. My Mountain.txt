In the east god was closer to her than her carotidOn the left hand path my soul is open by Satan's will and his triumph The faith were once doubted at the mountain SinaiThe dagger ready to pierce a god who feared the outcomeI walk far from god where the light were black and red At my spiritual mountain of Sinai, my pyramids of skullsIn darkness where my mountain stands as a crossroad Where at the horizont the path turns left or right, at the beginning of the reincarnation cycleThe opposite-self screamed out when it was aware of itself, my eyes were open I belief in the utter darkness, I belief in closing the reincarnation circle and to break it and close the gate to life Kingdom of death, end of days, my mountainAt my mountain of crossroad the choise have been made Eternal kingdom of death, on the left hand path my soul is open
