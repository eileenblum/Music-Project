Out of hunger and desperationChac, the rain giver, demands bloodlettingCizin, lord of the dead, bringer of famine and plagues A dragon desend from carnage in heaven to enter the kingdom of the underworld No sacrifies is to great, though death is the eternal kingdomThe sacred rituals to please hungry gods, pierce the tongue to speak with the spirit world Bloodletting triggers, the darkest vision in a altered state Serpents rise from smoke to puke out their visionsA dead civilation left a blood drought world Priests are proud, praise deathPraise ritual murder, praise human sacrificePraise the headless body with snakes
