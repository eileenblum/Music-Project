Zu - he who knows, Anzu - he who knows the heavensAncient winged demon, stealer of tablets of destiny, holder of fate He who will establish his throne, he will command He who stood before the great seven AnunnakiBeheaded for the knowledge, he possessed He who knew was rewarded by death, he who remained causing illness and sufferingThe plotting evolving into birdlike demons who cause pestilence Their leader, Lillitu, winged demon with birdlike feet Zu... Zu... Lillitu... Lillitu...
