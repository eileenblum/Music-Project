Lord of the black depths, swallower of the earth
Wrath of Leviathan, hammer of man's dawn
Sword wounds of a man, compare not the steel of a sword

Though they are harmless and the western throne glow with pride
Dragon of the black deep, the utter dark will swallow the essence of life

Master of the throne of the west
Mankind will be drowned and sleep forever in the wombs of death

The hungry deep awaits us, to enter fearless wrath of a bloodthirst dragon

Dragon of bloodthirst

Leviathan... Leviathan... Leviathan... Leviathan...
