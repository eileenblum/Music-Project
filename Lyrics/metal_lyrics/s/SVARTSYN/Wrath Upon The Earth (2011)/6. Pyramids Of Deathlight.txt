Along the vein in the sand have man's faith on earth been foreseen (destend)
A celestial destruction triggered by the sun

Orion was the destination for the faraon after death
Royal tombs pointing to the sky, designed to assist them on their final journey

When Venus peirce Orion, massive tsunamis of sand and brimestone, an unescapeable wall of fire

Royal tombs pointing to the sky, glowing with enchanting deathlight
When the old lion is mad, the deathlight enchants us

The old lion is mad, pyramids of deathlight, a journey in brimestone

After the destruction the old lion turned around
The true masters of the earth will rise again

The great beasts, ancient beasts rise
