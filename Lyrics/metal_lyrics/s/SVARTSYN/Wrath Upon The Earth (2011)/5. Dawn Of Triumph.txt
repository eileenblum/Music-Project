Tides will rise beyond their ken to bite away the shores and the mountain will roar
Earthquakes split the plain to shore, flooding waters rushing in

Will flood the lands with such a din
That mankind comes in muddy ten and snarls about his follow men

Man flees in terror from the floods and kills, rapes and lies in blood

And spilling blood by mankinds hand will stain and bitter many lands
Not every land on earth will sink, but these will wallow in stench and stink of rotting bodies of beast and men

From the distant shore angels of death blow their apocalyptic horn
