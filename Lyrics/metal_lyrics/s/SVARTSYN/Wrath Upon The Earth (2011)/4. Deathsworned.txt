Anunnaki, those from heavens to earth came whom's existence immortalized in stoneCreated slaves of their images, a planted seed which still last after thousands of years Seed of the earth, death from above May the evil wind cleanse the world, may death come to collect its harvest, a deathsworned race Spawn of Anunnaki, spawn of Adam, creator and destroyer, judge and executioner Great massacre of humanity awaits, the depths swallowed once a ancient worldDeep within the keys are sacred, keys to the gates of a forgotten world With open eyes a dragon is a awakened
