In her primordial waters
Mother of all
Silence in it's storming waters
Soaring beyond
The control of earthly chains
As the darkness transcends
And the subconsciousness awakens
In the arms of the old dragon
Dark gods, evil gods in the dark
Here is where
I must leave my shell and go no further
Deeper into the depths
A blue spectra in the
Twilight between life and death
Far beyond the living
I soar beyond time
Facing my ordeals
Receiving the unearthly task
A vision and revelation for my path
Of the unfolded void to come
From the darkness
And abyss of waters
From a two-fold principle
Taking form as Nubur
Creating her eleven monsters
Tiamat
Absu
Ilu Limnu
