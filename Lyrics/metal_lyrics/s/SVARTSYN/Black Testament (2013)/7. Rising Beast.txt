From the wombs of Tiamat it rose
Awaken horned serpent
Crowned in blackened fire
Seven heads of atavistic darkness
Crowns of the bringer of death
Glows like a golden dawn
i have seen it's eyes filled
With dark knowledge
Stirred into it's abyss
A deep without end
Walk the Earth demon god
Walk the Earth demon god
Musmahhu
rising from the cursed waters
Bringer of dark knowledge
Of the subconscious
Rise up
To scorch the shores of man
Burn all
Musmahhu
Crowns of the bringer of death
Glows like a golden dawn
It's abyss...
A deep without end
