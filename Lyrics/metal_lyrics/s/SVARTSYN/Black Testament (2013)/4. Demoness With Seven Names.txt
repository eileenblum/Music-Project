It's the sickness of the night and day
Whose shape is as the whirlwind
Without structure
And without restraint
Of other gods
Sister of the seven evil gods
Lamaschtu goddess
Demoness with seven names
Fill me with venom
Poison my dreams
Touch me with your filthy hands
While I stare into the face
Of a ferocious lion and reek
The stench of children's flesh
it is my will to drain life
By Lamaschtu visiting my dreams
Obliterating one
The serpents in which you hold
You possess wisdom
I dare to seek thy wisdom
Cloak me in your shadow
And nourish me with blood
I walk towards the eternal core
With a trial of severed heads
Ardat Lili bless my waters
And curse my living realm
