Entering the realms of the underworld
Through devotion carved in flesh
Smoke of incense awakened my inner senses
realm of the shaves of the dead
Vast shadow world
My origin of gathering inner strength
Ereshkighal, queen of the underworld
Soaked in blood
Communicates only through my nightmare
Driven by fate of returning to the abyssic ocean
The venom of the void
Within the curse upon the mankind
Once I have been resurrected
Returning to the underworld, venom of the mind
Never will I wake up
Never, never, never...!!
