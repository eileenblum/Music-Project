I gaze far beyond...
Far past the horizon
Through the wall of smoke
I saw the great flood
Ending the first race of man
Open the gate of the restless waters
Dreaming of cities and temples
Yet unknown to man, that will drown
Enlils sinister nature curses man
I hear his whispering hymns in my soul
Forever cursing man
Far beyond the mortal realms
Let me see through the eyes of the Earth
Within the vision came the beast and
With the darkness came death
Surge of water devour...
Swallowing man
Through forbidden paths
Through sunken temples
With cuneiforms walls...
Through the eyes of the Earth
Enlil's lord of the seven storms
Enlil's sinister nature
Speaks in my flesh
