Beyond the vision
And creation of the human race
A being mixed with blood
And clay of the Earth
The flame of Kingu
Hidden deep within
A rising flame
From the vast lifeless dark
Devouring the human
Conscious from within
Beyond the visions
Of withering life
There's a coming of a harvest
Of eternal death
Where man subconsciously
Carve his own tomb
Awaken from its slumber
To storm restless
deep within the soul of man rises
The wrath of dead gods
Slowly devouring man from within
Eating his subconscious
To devour it's conscious
Drawing wisdom from the primal darkness
And placing oneself on the highest
Throne in the darkness
I am a phantom
Carving a temple in stone in the name of
Kingu's black flame
This temple is cold...
Here, there is only death
