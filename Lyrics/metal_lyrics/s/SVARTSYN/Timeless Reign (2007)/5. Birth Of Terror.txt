Ending the dreams of human form
The image of mans desire to suffer lays deep in the unconsciousness
The man adores the shape and the image of you
Since the beginning of time the man adored the comets
Its tail ripping the sky
Sign of the coming apocalypse
Every man had its nightmare; every life had its time
Our time has come and the HALO OF DEATH marks the birth of terror
Our time has come and thousand comets will strike the earth
