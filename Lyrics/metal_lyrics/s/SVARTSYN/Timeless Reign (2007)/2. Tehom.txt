Once were man made for the higher worlds and the black oceans
But as god chained the man he was thrown out from its astral garden
Once we again began devouring the forbidden fruits our hunger grows stronger
From awakening gehinnom to tehom
A journey of a destructive goal
Eternal wisdom lies within
Beyond the reach of any man
The man has always feared what they don't understand
In tehom mysteries shall unfold
TEHOM the man - the last in line to chaos
A gate to world death
