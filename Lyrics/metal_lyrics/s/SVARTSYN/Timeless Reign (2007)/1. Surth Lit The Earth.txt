A tired sun over a western world
A civilization at its end
A dawn of fire
In all corners there will be fire
The symbol of Christ, the chalice full of blood, origins of terror
Angels they sang to the world, starving in pain
And their feathers were in flames
He who has listened to the confessions for centuries, his enemy are many
Dawn of this time has arrived and the four horsemen rode upon the earth
From the north evil spawned
From north SURTH's flames drowned the earth
