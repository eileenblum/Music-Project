Living in sin
Godly chains have since the beginning of time imprisoned us
A prisoner in illusion
With no fear I devourer the forbidden fruits
I came not to this world with peace but with a snake's wisdom and sharp swords and knives
The narrow paths of life will turn to the utter unknown and beyond
My sinner, since the reincarnation began we have slept under Tiamat's dragon wings
My sinner, the path of Hubur burns bright
Awake! My sinner, my destroyer
Geburah - creator and destroyer
Soul is forever to be descending from early chains
My sinner, self inflicted wounds
My sinner, the sinful deeds will give your fame
Isfet will drown every man with his spiritual seed
