Oh, Satan, lord of all
Fire rains from heaven
Ever since the fall your kingdom was set here on earth in the shadows
Its foundation of steel and fire, a forever standing kingdom
A timeless reign
Acknowledge Satan, without for nor shape but victory in any war
Those who stand on the highest pyramid of skulls will see beyond the horizon
A wind that carves in flesh for all eternity
Oh, Satan, lord of all
Destroyer of time
Out of closed eyelids pours the blood of beauty
A war is won
Sitra ahra
