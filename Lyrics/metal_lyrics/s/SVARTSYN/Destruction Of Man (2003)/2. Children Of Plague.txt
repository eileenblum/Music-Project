He who flew the sky was sick
In a woman's womb he spilled virulent seed
Many years later came those who set fires in the horizon
Bleed from open wounds that never healed
Four plague stricken ride on four horses of famine

The seven angels of apocalypse blew its trumpets
And so eyes of the faithful bleed
The last cometh descend the skyline of flames
Followed by its dragon tail
I saw the epidemic from afar
The preaching of the end of time

Death came with the storm and their victims' enemy they never see
It tore a wound in Christ's beloved face

Never receipt God
In perverstic and dreadful sin
Never deny the tempter as the savior
Wrath of God makes my skin

Death came with the storm!

The seven angels of apocalypse blew its trumpets
And so eyes of the faithful bleed
The last cometh descend the skyline of flames
Followed by its dragon tail
I saw the epidemic from afar
The preaching of the end of time
