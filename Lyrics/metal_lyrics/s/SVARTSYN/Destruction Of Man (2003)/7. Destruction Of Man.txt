The thrones in heaven in flames
A beast of starving hunger rises from the sea
Blasphemic names on its head
And ten kings pride glow

I am here as man on earth remembering this time
I saw the last cometh the civilization will ever see

The dragon tail scorched the flesh
Rebels of the great enemy marches

The swansong of heaven...

The swansong of heaven...
Open wide the gates of heaven
So the sea of blood can flow into the mouth of man

I brought pleasures out of chaos
Enjoy thousands of deaths
Destruction of man
