Warm stench of putrefaction
Devastations around the world
All waters submerges and storm
Devastating on blessed scorched earth

Beneath the death mask of each man
The faces are skinned
Dried out
Models of tragedy, an opera of sin
Yet undiscovered creatures from deep will rise and walk as a new man on earth

With destructions hunger
Perversions hunger
Sadistic hunger
The symbols of man

When the fields are theater scenes of the past masks of man never smile again
When the demons are walking on earth civilization is just a memorial dust

Demons walking on earth
