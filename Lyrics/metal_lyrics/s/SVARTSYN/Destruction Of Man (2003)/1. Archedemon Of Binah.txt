Jerusalem glow of mystery
As the wrist burn in manifestations of evil
In cold trance
Total dedication to divine evil
Flesh to mysteries evocation

Down a ladder step came the archdemon of Binah
With the book of revelation
Jesus has walked via Dolores and suffer
Jesus is now buried deep and his disciples preach of terror

Beyond the secret gates of heaven
The archangels in chains and tormented
Satan's semen spills from Jesus' mouth
Where he hang to bleed

Jesus and his followers will suffer
Under Lucifuge rofocale, archdemon of Binah
Submitting to evil and conspiracy

The future that you hold is corrupted
And brings Lucifer's light upon lost paradise
