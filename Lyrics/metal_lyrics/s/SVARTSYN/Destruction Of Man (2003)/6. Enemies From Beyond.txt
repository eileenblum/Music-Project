Way of Chutulu's blackness
In deep water light doesn't reach here
Its children arrive with pentacles

To surface where the enemy is no longer lost
Lost way now found
They meet among us

Lost wisdom with doom written in
Mystic sculptures of revelation
The snake legend have come back
Visions of kingdoms and temples in ruins grow stronger

Enemies from beyond:
Come serpent of old
From gate under the stoney beast
Open and light shines like power

Way of Chutulu's blackness
In deep water light doesn't reach here
Its children arrive with pentacles

To surface where the enemy is no longer lost
Lost way now found
They meet among us
