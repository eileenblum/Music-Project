Evil spawned from open wounds
Heated chains upon my dirty skin
Receiving slashing chains across the teeth

In a chalice of venom wine
Spilt unblessed blood
Kissing with dry lips the devils horn
In despite of revelation of devil's image

Smell the stench of Babylon's cunt
Drinking blood from her chest
Satan's emotionless cold breaths like winter winds in these bottomless eyes
An abyss of haunted evil and reign terror

Spawned from the early days in medieval times
Great enemy of the sinless
Mastema...
