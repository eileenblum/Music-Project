Civilization is earth's cancer which implodes into divine madness
Where the man rises his gun towards his brother's head to feed upon sins
Rise the evil in man and the falseness in man towards chaos

The wrath of God bright as morning star
Creating armies on either shore:
Turning mankind into madness

Bringing the salvation with terror though we are the hands that strangle
Slit the throats of many for pleasure
And stabbing the holy mother that carry miracles of life in the cunt

And be rewarded by his magnificent pain
You and I must die
