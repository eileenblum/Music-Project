Followed by the goatlord under the silver moon
His eyes glowing red and spiders in his hair
He's the devil in the dungeons at night
Worship the lord of the goatthrone
To enter the kingdom, search in the darkness
Deep in the pits of hell

Hail the prince of death
A tyrant dressed in blood soaked leather
In the shadow of the throne
A chalice filled with poison

Raped by his power
Drinking cold blood like wine
Demons summoned to kill
The goatlord is eternal

"Though death awaits your flesh
Your soul will walk this kingdom
Forever worshiping me"
