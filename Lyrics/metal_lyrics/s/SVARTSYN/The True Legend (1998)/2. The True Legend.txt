Time before the beginning epoch
A true legend in the ancient days of Rome
Drank blood in society with Satan
And were offered to become immortal

Towards the home of the birth of the Christian Jesus
Waiting for the  twenty-fourth day of December
In the shadow of sunlight, waiting for darkness
In the darkness, the first and the last day

At midnight to rape the fucking whore Maria
Before the dawn the spirit of Jesus shall be o more
Hunt the Christians into dungeons and kill
Kill... blood must flow

The true legend desecrate Christian skull
Christian dreams are destroyed
In Rome he speaks with the devil
Hail death
