In the forgotten ancient forest of evil
Where the winter was eternal
Once again the blood will drip
From the shadow that hangs in the rope
In the moon cursed grimly forest
Where the winter was eternal
The painful screams echoes
In the dark forgotten sky
Once again the moon glows clearly
As the tears once again touched your lips

The winds of deeply sorrow
Deep as the deepest ocean
In the ghoul-haunted paths of the forest
Where a man used to walk
Long time ago he were totally missing, gone
After few years he were forgotten
But he has now been found
Totally dismembered and buried under leaf

A corpse is found with all it's bones broken
Centuries ago the beast ripped his heart out
The time has come for the return
Alone in the night I walk... waiting
