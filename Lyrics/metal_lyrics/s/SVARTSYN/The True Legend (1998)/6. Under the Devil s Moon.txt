Silence in the darkness
Black shadows struggling through the dark
The silence is breaked by few screams
In the cave of death

Under the devil's moon
The evil spell of death light
Forced into the circle
Where the moonlight used to shine

The devil's moon so beautiful
To watch forever
Deep inside the darkest soul
The power of darkness
