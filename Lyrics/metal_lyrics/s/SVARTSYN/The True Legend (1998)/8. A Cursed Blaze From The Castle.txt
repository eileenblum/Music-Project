The reaper is here
Scent of evil
Blood at the ground
Moonlight has got here
Blaze...
It's at night

A shadow on a tomb
It's another blaze
From somewhere
Somewhere in time
Blood to drink
From the filled chalice
Inside the castle

Into the castle of blood
Dust on the paved floor
A room full of tombs

From inside of a nailed-up door
In the dark torture chamber
Lits the blaze of death
A cursed blaze from the castle
