A demon appearing to the blind
Glowing red eye in its jaw
Like a diamond empowering
The inner vision
Its essence is black
Drawing its vision from this blind demon
From the wombs of Tiamat
And the spirit glows black

Entering my mind
Let me rise with a lower body
Of a snake through smoke
Through the dark portal
Of the burning eye
Of the blind demon

Entering a scorched garden with a sea
A stench of clotted blood
Through inner illumination, seeing motions and art

Beast of death with countless forms
Rise again as a seven-headed beast
Imagery burns within my soul
Filling me with sevenfold emotion

Rise, Musmahhu!

Rise, beast of death
Your seven voices poisoning my veins
Coming swirling as snakeheads vortex
Through the black woods

Rise! Rise! Rise!
