A coming of a presence driving me insane
Alienating me from the physical world
A coming of the end of the world
Prophet
The one of deserts, of solitude

The wind is silent
The horizon is still blood red
Before turning dark
I felt a presence of
A fearful pride and wrath

I saw something in the dark mist
That breeds in nightmares
And brought back fear and horror
That lies within for the world to see

Within whirlwinds of fog
And locusts the snake-headed beast
Transforms into a man-like being
And his eyes,
Reptilian and glowing!

Through his reign the dark agenda will manifest
Through his spoken words and actions under the dark twilight
The grey and the black checkered carpet will be laid before the world
For he to bring withered prosperity to the world under which nations will fall and cities burn!

And he spoke with a voice of death
To bring the man to his knees
