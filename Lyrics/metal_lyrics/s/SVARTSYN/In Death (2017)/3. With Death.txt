Here is the place of death
Where the road of pain ends
On this cold surface where I lay staring into the infinite blackness
There was nothing but darkness at firstâ¦
But a presence of cold!

With Death's hand on my shoulder
My mind is lost
Once I sunk through the surface
Of the black sea to enter a purgatory
Leading to a final void of pain

Bringing aside the blood red curtain and facing the bright light
And the path leading to a hill of crosses

In the light which blinds me,
The mass grants me as a near death prophet

Once again I walk the roads of death
Alongside temple walls in the dark,
Where mummified carcasses hang as trophies
...To the hill where now a stone table stands
There's a sudden storm as I face the stone table
The endless dark awaits beyond the horizon
Here's the end of the human spirit
In the dark horizon I can distinguish a black moving mass

Death!
