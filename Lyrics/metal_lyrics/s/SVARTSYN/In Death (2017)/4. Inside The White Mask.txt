I have seen the depths
And stared into the abyss
In the dark I have seen the true faith of man
The blind man indoctrinated through the dark agenda
Manifested within the structures of the false free society,
In this time of control and programming of your mind

In the devouring darkness where the revelation of the true intentions unfolds,
Like fire marks imprinting my soul

I wore a white mask to hide my human face
And for the vision not being blocked

There's a presence of hate far beyond man's conception in this hostile realm

A race superior to man
Will rise as the world is in conflict
And the man enslaved
Speaking through the elite masters of the earth
Speaking in secret tongues to catatonize the masses

Those who hated mankind rose from the deep,
Wearing black and grey-white striped masks
Their hostile wrath curses and infects this realm
I will rise with them turning myself against the false mass!
