I want to leave this place of a false wealth
Through dark solitude, Death whispers its secrets of the vast wilderness
Whispers I hear from the wild unknown
Staring into the wilderness
A light bearer in the blackness of the woods

A sense of a voice calling from the black
A face that calls
So blue white and reeking of cold
I want to wash the face with clotted toad blood
Twisted witchery in the wilderness
Twisting my mind and soul into the unknown wilderness
Walking beyond the light in the shadow of nocturnal sorcery

Twisting my mind
Iâm an enemy of the structures of the false society
The black woods are the eternal throne
I forge my own will, desires, and destiny!

You are nothing!
A blind slave oppressed and programmed by wealth
With the skull I speak at night
With the skull in my hand I walk into the wild
Holding a chalice up high facing the woods
The black woods are my throne
Smeared in black blood of a toad and followed by a howling black dog
