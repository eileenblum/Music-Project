Out of slumber on the nightmarish path
Awaken from the hypnotic dance of naked trees
Out from this withered scorched woods
A lifeless field of monolith structures rises high
So black...

The black thrones of death
Nothing of this world reeks of such authority
Reaches control over all borders of life and death
A northern throne of total victory
Bringing death and fear to the weak
Bringing evolution through visions of bloody revolution

Glimpses of what on doomsday we shall see

A western throne of bottomless lawlessness
Eastern throne, the destroyer of ancient forms
The negative emptiness and silence
Southern throne, of black light which blinds
And manipulates its surroundings

The black thrones of death manipulates
The glimpses of what on doomsday we shall see

When I saw those ravishing thrones,
My eyes bleed of pride and hunger... Of hunger

Glimpses of what on doomsday we shall see
