The snake that crawled out
Of the tree in Eden
Circled around my soul
And forces his way through my throat
Illuminating me in this vast kingdom
In the twilight of Death

Alienates me from the human world
Exiles me from the living realm

Nephilim spawned from angel
Whom breed with humans
A race of giant
I am a descendant of a half-god
A spirit that originates from an older race

As thick fog dissolves
White-grey giant sculptures
Of a non-human race
Rises before my eyes

As the flesh and spirit remembers
The subconsciousness converges with the consciousness and explodes in fiery images before my eyes
Exiling me from the realms of lifeâ¦ in death
