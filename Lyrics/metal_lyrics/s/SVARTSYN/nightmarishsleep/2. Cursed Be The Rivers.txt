Praying for man to awaken from the sleep of illusion
and flourish from the fruits of death.
He who sacrificed himself drank blood from the gods to rise a blacker sun.
Infecting the mind so the fruits of life withers.
All crops withers and misgrowth.
Essence of the venom,
forever cursing the ground I walk on.
World once flourished is now dark and pale.
All crops wither
to feed a bloodfeasting sun.
A pestilential essence brought into this world
where all crops wither nourishing from the rivers of death.
Man have for thousands of years spilled their blood
to feed his link into this world.
Fertility god, may your waters be poisoned.
Cursed be your rivers.
All feed from a rotten soil.
All crops wither.
All crops wither.
