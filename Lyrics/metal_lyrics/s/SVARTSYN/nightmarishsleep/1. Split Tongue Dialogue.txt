The tower rises high in the dark.
My knife in the ground, I was on my knees my hands touched its rotten soil.
I stare upon its wall until I could see stars. The tower of Babylon.
A voice from the abyss began to speak through
my veins. Unknown to human tongue.
It has opened my understanding. I swallow its
neverborn.
Those thousands voices that spoke onto God
are silent but the shadow of a split tongue
still has its dialogue. And the inner dialogue is
insane.
The inner dialogue infests my earthly flesh
and curses life. Slowly to infect the mass with
its pestilential misanthropic views upon life.
Drawn from realms of nightmare.
Split tongue dialogue in unknown tongue.
Those yellow-red serpent like eyes, let me drown
in this soulless entity.
I listen to its inner dialogue.
