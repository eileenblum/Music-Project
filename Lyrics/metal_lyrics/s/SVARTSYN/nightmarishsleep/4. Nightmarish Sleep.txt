Facing the gates to the land of the dead. Its getting darker and darker as I on a stairwell descend. Beneath the stairwell crawls with serpents and snakes.
Older than the first man.
I walk towards death in a nightmarish fog with a strange
red light. Poisonous violent colour. Death is the eternal path.
Dead but dreaming in this nightmarish sleep.
Gates to the land of the dead. Deeper and deeper into darkness.
Where I leave personal belonging behinds
which binds me to a mundane world.
Let me bring misfortunes back and a infested soul.
Even with carved out eye sockets I could stare into the deep
darkness of death.
My vision will flow freely in the realm of the underworld.
Seven hands with crowns came out the dark infesting my soul with prayers.
Show me the secrets of the underworld Ereskighal.
Infest my mind with your divine secrets.
I sing in tongues my prayer celebrating
the hidden faces whom came out from the dark.
Here in this nightmarish sleep.
As I leave the realm I will ground myself in my temple.
The nightmarish sleep.
I rise through the poisonous violent fog.
