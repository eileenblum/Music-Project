The entity of ancient worlds nourish from the visions of the real world.
Eating from the inside the will to exist in flesh.
I am eternal. Dreams in the flesh.
I walk beyond the limits of the flesh,
in twilight with answers.
My soul is forever corrupt and
my worldview is black.
I have lost of all concept of time in this realm
and the real world is so unfamiliar.
The black is eating my sense of reality.
The realm outside the flesh is my home!
The world is non-existing as I am eternal.
I am eternal. I am death.
