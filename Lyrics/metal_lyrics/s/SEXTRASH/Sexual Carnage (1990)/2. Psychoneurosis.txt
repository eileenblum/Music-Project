[Lyrics by Pussy Ripper - Music by Sextrash]

In your inner world
Deep in your brain

In your dark side
Your mind blows up
With intense impulses
Of evil aberrations
You can't support
And get away, searching
For another victim

You walk on the streets
In dead corders
You see your victim
And take her with you
You arrive in her home
And the her up to her bed
You thrash the woman
And the fades...

Now there she's faded and bleeding
You rape her and laughs of pleasure

Now she wake up and try to get up
You go crazy and thrash her again
You feel that her flash starts to chill
And see in her eyes the darkness of
Death
