[Lyrics by Pussy Ripper and D. D. Crazy - Music by Sextrash]

Screams,
Hate, pound and blood
On a night of sound attack,
The hard core dance speeds
Fuckin'all bastads,
Head massacre
Agony and alcoholic coma
You're afraid os never awake
Never...

And in your thoughts
Just lament and death scare

Illusions
Permission get crazy
Your mind loose the control
Torment your head
And your body is on old aweat
You throw up blood
But you don't
Just afraid of never awake
Never...

Awake!!!
I just went to awake!!!

Alcoholic mosh

Now,
You don't hear anymore noises
And you body is on the ground,
You never get up again,
Never...

Don't have any thoughts
And don't lament anymore
You'll never awake...
