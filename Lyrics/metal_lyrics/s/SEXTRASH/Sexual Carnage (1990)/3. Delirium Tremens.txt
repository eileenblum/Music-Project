[Lyrics by Pussy Ripper - Music by Sextrash]

Alcohol is corrosive but I can't stop
My visions are confused. I feed better
When I'm drunk
My body and mind ask for one more litre
I drink and after being totally drunk
I walk the streets, searching for pleasure
Desire, sadism and luxury, fill up my
Mind...

I walk from bar to bar
Women excite me all the time
But when I touch them
They disappear, like a specter
My mind is disturbed
I don't even know if what I see is truth or hallucination

Now I feel the alcoholic effect is over
My hand shake and I need more booze
I see men in white coming at me
They raise me from the ground and
Dress me a straige jacket
