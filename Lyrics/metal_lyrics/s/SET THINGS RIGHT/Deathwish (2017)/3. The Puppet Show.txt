This is where the madness stops 
This is the end of trusting lies for now 
We fought in vain and smiled with pain 
But when we cry we're just the same 
Did my back hurt your knife? 
I wonder, did the tear crawl back up your face 
It's shameful that I must say 

I drew a line you always cross 
I closed the door; it's you who knocks 
Explanations muted 
These excuses won't turn our clock 
Scratched out the view, erased our past 
A heart in two pieces, hatred won't rest 
You broke the rules we wrote 
This damage will always last 

You place your feet at my door 
Claiming to take back all the things you've done 
A deaf man could hear you're wrong 
'Cause in this web of lies you lose your way out 
You're using a broken gun 
This puppet show ends now 

You blew it all, betrayed the game 
Ignored the right, refused the blame 
Your broken record has produced your own wall of shame 
Tasted the truth of your dream I wasted a whole lot of my time 
So long goodbye to your fake picture perfect life

You blew it all, betrayed the game 
Ignored the right, refused the blame 

This is where the madness stops 
This is the end of trusting lies for now 
We fought in vain and smiled with pain 
And when we cry we're just the same 

You place your feet at my door 
Claiming to take back all the things you've done 
A deaf man could hear you're wrong 
'Cause in this web of lies you lose your way out 
You're using a broken gun 
This puppet show ends now
You place your feet at my door 
Claiming to take back all the things you've done 
A deaf man could hear you're wrong 

You're fucking wrong
