A throwback to promises made 
A throwback to promise clichÃ©s 
Intents and life plans all went to waste 
Inhuman goals hastily chased 
The times I have sinned in life and swore myself "I'll be fine"
The price unpaid but soon enough the great fall will be mine 

We used to drive through all these streets 
Get high and down in the backseat 
And in just one blink of an eye 
Our reckless precious lives flew by 
I wish that I could turn back time 

Day in, day out 
Go hard, no doubt 
Never forget 
Life's not a movie you can pause or start over again 
So breathe in, breathe out 
Each moment counts 
'cause in the end 
Life's a gift and today is maybe all that we get 
'Cause forever never ever lasts 

A throwback to "no's" and rejects 
Missed chances we still regret 
Blunders and fucked ups all down the drain 
Survived the bright worthy pain 
The climbs remain unfinished due our lack of effort 
The crimes declared by this laziness through our so-called terror 

I thought we'd stay forever young 
This sudden sense has me proved wrong 
These grey flat buildings looked so tall 
Green trees so high, our world so small 
I wish that I'd admired it all 

Here I start my grateful life before it's old and sober 
Now I won't waste another fucking day 

It never ever ever never ever lasts
