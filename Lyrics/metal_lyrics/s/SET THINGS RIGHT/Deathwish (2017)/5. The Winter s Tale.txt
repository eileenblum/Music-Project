Keeping my hopes down, no reason to pray 
It's safe to say you've been led astray 
Too far-gone, too far to turn back 
I cannot change the way you are 

You're the star of the dullest play 
Of the worst Shakespeare on earth 
Lights on 
We bow in rows and smile away 
And when the crowd has left you'll change 
Erase the smile from your empty face 
So how can you judge me and say you mistrust me 
When your own disguise ain't reality? 
Lights on 
I cannot change the way you are 

Cheers
Raise the glass high, dive right in 
I'll drink to all times you misguided me 
I am so done with saving you from yourself 

Do you remember a life without tears of misery? 
A greater time, less tragedy? 
You live with an urge to destroy 
The habit of ruining everything 
You turn gold into stone 
Assuring all tales end up tragically 

I cannot change the way you are 

I cared enough to be there 
While you never cared at all 
Attempts gone bad, all torn to shreds 
So ungrateful for the feeding hand 

A life without tears of misery 
A greater time, less tragedy 
You never cared at all 

Keeping my hopes down, no reason to pray 
It's safe to say you've been led astray 
Too far-gone, too far to turn back 
I cannot change the way you are 

Cheers
Raise the glass high, dive right in 
I'll drink to all times you misguided me 
I am so done with saving you from yourself 
Cheers
Raise the glass high, dive right in 
I'll drink to all times you misguided me 
I am fucking done, so take care and good night
