I've felt the sting of betrayal
The bitter taste it leaves 
I, the anguish himself 
The ruthless hatred decaying out of its shell
A quieter fury than the silence of an ancient collapsing lung

This patience's a bomb, 
Circuit switch disabled, about to explode 
Twisting the lack of strain 
I am the nuclear 
I won't behold the pale horse

Countless burdens are crushing my weighed down shoulders
The weight of adjourning intolerant
Strengths are choking 
Fed myself poor
Lost my courage to face all signs left ignored 
My search to end this all turns into obsessions
Depressions will never cease to exist

This life of grief is too hard for me to swallow
It buries bliss so deep in sadness
Unearths the past, awakes the madness
My death wish will free us all from sorrow
Release all pain and hate we've gathered
Hail the wolves who lead the shepherds

Break me, my soaked branches fail to start a fire
Kindle my burning fears
Drown me with gasoline 
The disappointing extinguished me won't carry the light 
I won't carry on fighting
All faith is burned to ashes 
Your empathy won't fix me

This life of grief is too hard for me to swallow
It buries bliss so deep in sadness
Unearths the past, awakes the madness
My deathwish will free us all from sorrow
Release all pain and hate we've gathered
Hail the wolves who lead the shepherds
All faith and love is gone forever
Hail the wolves who lead the shepherds

I'll never grasp it, always bound with the ropes of sin 
I'm far beyond the edge, I'll self-destruct
So pull the plug, break the circle
Will you just pull the plug?

This is my destination 
This is my life salvation
This is my destination
This is my own cremation
