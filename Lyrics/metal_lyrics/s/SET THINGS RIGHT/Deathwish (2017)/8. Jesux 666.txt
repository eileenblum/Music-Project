Convincing all underdeveloped minds 
Manipulating their view on life 
All brainwashed and fed with lies 
'You're broken; you need to be fixed'
Brought to their knees to beg for the hand of the almighty God 
Of their God
They all just blindly trust, due to this ignorance, illiteracy
They all give in; this God delusion is real 

Oh darkness, you're lighting the wrong way 
A way where loving is evil and no one is equal again 
Oh darkness, you're facing destiny 
Turn in the freedom; your God is a demon to me 

My mouth; filled with blood from biting my tongue 
I can't hold it any longer...
What kind of God approves of murder, rape, and slavery? 
Passing the torch to racial imbeciles? 
How can you all worship a religion known for child abuse 
in their church called home? 
I have the truth in my hand
Now let me paint you an image of hell 
You won't believe what you see 
'cause their sins are things they'll never tell 
Where does this go? How was it meant? 
How will this madness come to its end? 
Their morals are gone, their blue turned to grey 
We'll burn the bible; will it fade away? 
Where does this go? How was it meant? 
Will it ever pass by just like a shameless regret? 
Cure the young hearts; let's poison the Holy Grail 

One more time to assure you got it straight 
Our lives ain't just based on some faith 
Open up your eyes and finally realize
The ones you're kneeling for:
This persistence is all just a lie

Let's save the world, fuck religion
