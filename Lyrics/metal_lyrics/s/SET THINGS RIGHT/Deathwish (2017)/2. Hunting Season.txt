We've got to fear them 
Swim back to shore 
These sharks won't go away there is no hope for any of us anymore 
They'll cut us open 
Fill us with stones 
It's hunting season and we're the bait 
They're here to tear us apart 

We cannot just fight and defeat them
It's an ice-cold sea, and it killed the best in me 
I feel the weakness in my bones 
Too dark to see and too cold to breath 
And it killed the best in me 
I feel the weakness in my bones 
They're here to tear us apart 

We had our first shy stint at sinning 
Let's say goodbye for now 
We will reunite at the blue depths 
Where we'll be rotting in fucking bags 
Am I exaggerating? 
Making sharks out of small bait? 
We are face to face with death 
Our hollow lives will end this sad 
We are face to face with death 

They swim in circles while closing in
Their prey has been cut
We are bleeding, we are
Grinding their teeth, their eyes turn red
Their bite's unstoppable
Hear us begging forgiveness 
Their lust won't fade away and their hunger will remain forever
Our bones won't leave this sea, but in dreams we'll always be together 

We cannot just fight and defeat them
It's an ice-cold sea and it killed the best in me 
The weakness in my bones 
Too dark to see and too cold to breathe 
And it killed the best in me 
The weakness in my bones 
I feel the weakness in my bones 
The weakness in my bones 

They're here to tear us apart
