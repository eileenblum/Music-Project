I'm not the sail that takes you there 
I am the anchor that holds you back 
I'm not the raft that keeps you dry 
I am the anchor, the sinking wreck 

No, you can't just leave me here
This is not the promise you made 
Stay with me, just stay awake 
I know we can, I know 
Well, I can't bear your complaining but you're too tired to see this 
I can't remember how long it has been I've seen your eyes this cold 

Let go my hand, leave me here all behind 
So scared to death but nothing left to lose 
I tried, I failed and now I surrender 

Cut the rope, you're better off this way 
Don't drown with me, I'm too deep to save 
I am the wreck â I, the anchor 
You're wasting time, no one hears you pray 
Don't drown with me, let me slip away 
I am the wreck â I, the anchor 

Don't look back, don't look back
And keep in mind we tried it over and over again 
I've got to find another fucking way to work this out 
Stay longer 'cause I don't want to be alone 
Never thought if it could work this way 
Let's sail away from the shoreline into darkness 
The air that I breathe is choking me 

I'm not the ship that saves you 
I am the wave that breaks you
The sinking wreck
I'm not the raft that keeps you
I am the storm that takes you
The sinking wreck

Cut the rope, you're better off this way 
Don't drown with me, I'm too deep to save
