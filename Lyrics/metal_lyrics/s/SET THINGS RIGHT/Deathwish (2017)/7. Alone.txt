We've seen the tides change course 
We've seen the calm wind turn to storm 
Harbour waves have destroyed everything 
(God's hand failed in saving love from perishing) 
All alone, stuck in a world unknown 

When the mighty flood has passed
And everything is gone
I will always sing this song
To find my way back home
Home is where I'm all alone

It's hard to hold fast when all your hopes and dreams are choked by fears 
It's hard to see clear when your eyes are drowned in your tears 
Choked by fears, in your fucking tears
These thoughts won't help or rescue me 
Hell entered our dreams 
All alone, stuck in a world unknown 

When the mighty flood has passed
And everything is gone
I will always sing this song
To find my way back home
Home is where I'm all alone
It comes to an end
I'll try to understand
Over and over again
Just bring me back home

I'm the worst pended, abandoned, uncomprehended man alive 
Not giving away my hand of cards, just gamble, read my eyes 
Oh, hey, I haven't lost it all and rebuilt this life on ground zero 
To fall for this clichÃ© 
My four kinds of aces ain't you raising, facing the royal flush 
'Though I'm never gonna stop until your war game's crushed 
I'm going all-in, win, spin this thing around the clock 
Unattainable heights is what we'll reach
From the bottom to the top
The game has begun, no turning back 
Russian roulette or a deadly blackjack? 
Take a deep breath and spit your rage 
This one-man show against my wolf pack 
A lucky charm won't survive our attack 
We cannot change the cards we're dealt 
Hold my drink please while I rob you blind 

So sick of grieving alone
