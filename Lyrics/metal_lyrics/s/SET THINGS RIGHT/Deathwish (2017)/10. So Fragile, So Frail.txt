If I just could reach the stars, I'd pull them all down 
Light your darkest nights; fill your empty skies 

The start, the birth 
A new beginning of life's journey on a foreign earth 
Ignorance, innocence 
A clear conscience and clean slate 
To you I'm talking nonsense 
Hold fast to dreams, for if dreams die; 
Life's a broken-winged eagle that cannot fly 
Karma nor luck, won't justify 
Pull out the arrow and aim high 

You're so fragile, so frail 
It drives me so insane 
Will you make it through the cold pouring rain? 
You're so precious to me, 
You're a drug, like cocaine 
You will always leave a trace in my veins 

Keep up rushing fast beats of a slow heart 
Push further the close edge 
Sharp goals crystal clear 
Our minds resurrected, aroused 
We'll rise straight through struggle 
As we walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
I will fear no evil for you are with me 
Your rod and your staff 
Rest assured, we'll take what we came for 

I will guide you to the moon 
I will guide you toâ¦. 

If I just could reach the stars, I would pull them all down 
Light your darkest nights, fill your empty skies 
If I just could reach the stars, I would pull them all down 
To see love shining bright in your sparkling eyes
