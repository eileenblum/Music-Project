[Music: Gryaznov; Lyrics: Gryaznov/Markov]

A century
Passed beside me like a dream
Now I feel
All its madness on my skin
A thousand lies
Like a finely crafted guise
Stay behind me in the past

Rumors of better life
Someone's reason to worry
About every single success
Talent without a sign,
A dream for trendy role
Rumors of better life
Find a reason to wonder
Over and over again
How can you make it right
When everything lives and dies

[Solo Oleg]

Rumors of better life
Someone's reason to worry
About every single success
Talent without a sign,
A dream for trendy role
Rumors of better life
Find a reason to wonder
Over and over again
How can you make it right
When everything lives and dies

Boiling sun
Burnt your wings by distant light
The stars are gone
So impassive to your kind
Make a try
Will you climb a little higher,
Will you reach another sky?

Rumors of better life
Someone's reason to worry
About every single success
Talent without a sign,
A dream for trendy role
Rumors of better life
Find a reason to wonder
Over and over again
How can you make it right
When everything lives and dies

Why everyone's so inspired
By rumours of better life?
