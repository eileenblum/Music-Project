[Music: Markov/Gryaznov; Lyrics: Markov]

She is like a star that's shining upon me
Thank God no one can erase her from my memory
I hope she remembers the times that we had
I know that I can't forget

I feel that my sorrow won't leave me alone
I'm lost and forsaken, my heart is turning to stone

I know you're gone
I shall go on
But it's not over, o-oh

It's passing me by, it's always increasing the pace
A smile on my lips, tears in my eyes, I lie
You'd never believe, but I cannot forget your face o-oh
I feel the same no matter how hard I try

[Solo Oleg]

It's passing me by, it's always increasing the pace
A smile on my lips, tears in my eyes, I lie
You'd never believe, but I cannot forget your face o-oh
I feel the same no matter how hard I try
