[Music: Gryaznov/Markov; Lyrics: Gryaznov]

I was murdered
No one noticed
Buried deeply in the nameless grave
Was it my life?
Was it my fate?
Was it everything you've chosen me to take?

Save me,
Now I need you more than ever
God, if you are there
Don't let me fall
Save me,
Here, between my hell and heaven
I believe, that
I still got
Angels around me

I remember
Being someone
Knowing more than I deserve to know
Would you heal me
Would you help me
To stay longer than a day within your world

Choosing
Aims and arrows, ways and manners
God, I need to know
Why am I here
Choosing
Sides and labels, rules and fables
And I doubt if I still got
Angels around me

Are you there?
Let me know
Please, don't leave me alone
God! Tell me, was it fair
That all the angels went away
Why have they disappeared
Gave up my life for many hollow years

[Solo Ilya]
[Solo Alexey]

You feel it's gnawing at your guts like a worm
You need to feed it, but it will ask for more
There's only one way to get it under control
But in the end there's a chance to return your soul

Choosing
Aims and arrows, ways and manners
God, I need to know
Why am I here
Choosing
Sides and labels, rules and fables
And I doubt if I still got
Angels around me

Angels in me
Demons in me
