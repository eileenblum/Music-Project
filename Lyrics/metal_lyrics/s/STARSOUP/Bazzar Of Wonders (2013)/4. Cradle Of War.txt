[Music: Gryaznov/Markov; Lyrics: Gryaznov/Markov]

Listen, mother -
Your son is calling
Light your candle and
Walk through the silent night
He's so lonely
In this mad world
He's just like me
Or... maybe I'm just a child

"Somewhere far away
In a better place
You will find your
Everlasting peace,
Don't you be afraid
Of those dreadful dreams" -
That's what she said to me

But still I can hear
The voices of the wind
Memories of those friends
Who are gone forever
How could I miss the day
That took them all away?
And now they are all asleep
In the cradle of war

Wash my tears out
Turn my fears off
I don't need these
Memories anymore
I was stronger
When I was younger
Now I cannot
Bear this price of war

"Somewhere far away
In a better place
You will find your
Everlasting peace,
Don't you be afraid
Of those dreadful dreams" -
That's what she said to me

But still I can hear
The voices of the wind
Memories of those friends
Who are gone forever
How could I miss the day
That took them all away?
And now they are all asleep
In the cradle of war

Recurring nightmare drives me insane
Undying enemies reborn again

Ripped out of my body my soul will dissipate
Where are the others - there's no one left to hate

And now I know
What it means to stay alone
To you I bow
Rest in peace, my friend
In the cradle of war

I hear the inner voice, I feel the pain
I'll use my last chance, I'll break the chain

Beyond the nightmares I'll make my way
Right through the darkness my fear will go away

And now I know
What it means to stay alone
To you I bow
Rest in peace, my friend
In the cradle of war

[Solo Ilya]

Still I can hear
The voices of the wind
Memories of those friends
Who are gone forever
How could I miss the day
That took them all away?
And now they are all asleep
In the cradle of war
