[Music: Gryaznov/Markov; Lyrics: Markov]

[Solo Ilya]

The dawn is waking, but it's getting darker
The sun is rising, but there's no light at all
My body's freezing, the cold is getting sharper
But fury's shooting up right through my soul
Why should I work when everybody's stealing
No tears anymore, eyes full of salt
It is not me who started killing
If no one's guilty now that's everybody's fault

Social justice and tyranny are intertwined together
The rich are getting richer while the prices rise
Why do you live this way, the stakes are getting higher
The biggest rat might get the biggest prize

Hey! - Hey!
I ain't no superman
Got no superpower,
I just play my cards with the sleight of hand
Hey! - Hey!
I ain't no superman,
A lucky bastard,
I just try to make it the best I can

If there's no road, you cannot run, my brother
No chance to win if you can't decide.
They made us prisoners that spy on one another
The good must get the evil on their side
The system failed, the bolts are clanking
I am the one on the rescue mission
I am the curse of the dirty bankers,
Crooked businessmen and politicians, yeah

Social justice and tyranny are intertwined together
The rich are getting richer while the prices rise
Why do you live this way, the stakes are getting higher
The biggest rat might get the biggest prize

Hey! - Hey!
I ain't no superman
Got no superpower,
I just play my cards with the sleight of hand
Hey! - Hey!
I ain't no superman,
A lucky bastard,
I just try to make it the best I can

[Solo Ilya]

Social justice and tyranny are intertwined together
The rich are getting richer while the prices rise
Why do you live this way, the stakes are getting higher
The biggest rat might get the biggest prize

Hey! - Hey!
I ain't no superman
Got no superpower,
I just play my cards with the sleight of hand
Hey! - Hey!
I ain't no superman,
A lucky bastard,
I just try to make it the best I can
