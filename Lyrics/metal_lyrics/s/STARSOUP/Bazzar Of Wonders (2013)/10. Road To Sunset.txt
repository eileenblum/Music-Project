[Music: Mescheryakov; Lyrics: Markov]

I'm not a fool I know the summer is gone
The days are shorter, and colder the nights
Again I'm alone, and again on the run
The stars are my only lights
The windshield scratches are like the old mates
The growl of the engine, it's keeping me up
The motel don't matter, got the lowest rate
Two bucks a coffee cup

I love the road I love the feel of a car
I like to listen to the sound of the tyres
It's rolling faster than the beat of my heart
The only dream, the one desire

I knew I would have done as I said
This never-ending road to sunset
I'll find it here
She'll hide it there
So why should we all care?
I knew I would have done as I said
This never-ending road to sunset
I cannot stop
I cannot quit
And that's about it

I'm not a fool I know the damage is done
The grudge is bigger, and harder the words
Again I'm alone, again on the run
The seagull's my only bird
I need to press on, I need to get to the shore
I'll find a way out, there's always one
I'll sit on the sand, and I'll sit some more
And stare at the diving sun

I love the road I love the feel of a car
I like to listen to the sound of the tyres
It's rolling faster than the beat of my heart
The only dream, the one desire

I knew I would have done as I said
This never-ending road to sunset
I'll find it here
She'll hide it there
So why should we all care?

I knew I'd make it
I knew I would have done as I said
This never-ending road to sunset
I cannot stop
I cannot quit
And that's about it
