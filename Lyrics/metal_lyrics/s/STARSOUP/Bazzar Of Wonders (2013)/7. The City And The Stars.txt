[Music: Markov; Lyrics: Markov]

[Solo Oleg]

Vivid arts of the mind
A desire to leave
Other places I find
They cannot perceive

What shall I do or write
Trying to find a way out
Against the fall Ð¾f the night
Telepathical shout

See the artificial star
Trusted cell for perfect brain
Our invention lies insane

Compelled to live
With love and hate
Your world it is
What you create

They store the memories when you die
A perfect soul, a perfect mind
A million years is never late
O-oh, o-oh
