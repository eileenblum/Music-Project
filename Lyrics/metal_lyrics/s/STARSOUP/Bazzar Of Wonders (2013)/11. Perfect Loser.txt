[Music: Gryaznov; Lyrics: Gryaznov/Markov]

In every sign of coming day
I see a broken promise
I tried to change -
But stuck and failed
And lost my time as always, cause I

Wake up at twenty five
I brush my teeth at thirty two
I have my lunch at forty nine -
And still I got some work to do
I take a nap till fifty six
Then lay and dream for a few weeks
No, I don't ever need to know
How oh so far I could have gone

I am a perfect loser
Don't you refuse amusing me
I am in love with myself
Through dozen lives I still stay free

Awoke in silence on a stage
I waste my smile for no one
My thoughts entwined, my keys are lost,
I sealed the mind cage where I

Wait a bit for another direction
Then have a thought on my new attraction
I spend a month to find a rhyme
Cause I got so much time
I get again a healthy fun
For sappy dude at eighty one
My stakes are every time so low
I swear to God - you wouldn't know

I am a perfect loser
Don't you refuse amusing me
I am in love with myself
Through dozen lives I still stay free

[Solo Anatoly]

Wait a bit for another direction
Then have a thought on my new attraction
I spend a month to find a rhyme
Cause I got so much time
I get again a healthy fun
For sappy dude at eighty one
My stakes are every time so low
I swear to God - you wouldn't know

I am a perfect loser
Don't you refuse amusing me
I am in love with myself
Through dozen lives I still stay free
