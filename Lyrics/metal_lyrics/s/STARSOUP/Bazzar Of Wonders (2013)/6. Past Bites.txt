[Music: Plotnikoff; Lyrics: Markov]

If you ever find my number
Don't call me cause I won't be there
If you ever notice regret
Don't tell me cause I don't care
It might seem hard to understand
You'd think it can be washed away
My heart was never made from sand
Pain wants to stay

You're living way too fast
I feel like you're insane
And don't you dare preach to me
You never knew my past
You never knew my pain
So don't you dare to teach me

I see you reaching for my doorbell
Don't ring it cause I won't be there
You claim that you know my song well
Don't sing it cause I won't hear
It might seem easy to predict
But might be hard to apologize
You cannot feel, but you reflect,
You rationalize

You're living way too fast
I feel like you're insane
And don't you dare preach to me
You never knew my past
You never knew my pain
So don't you dare to teach me

Never you've had your own fight
Never you tried to feel me
Never you touch my past bites
Never you can heal me

You're living way too fast
I feel like you're insane
And don't you dare preach to me
You never knew my past
You never knew my pain
So don't you dare to teach me
