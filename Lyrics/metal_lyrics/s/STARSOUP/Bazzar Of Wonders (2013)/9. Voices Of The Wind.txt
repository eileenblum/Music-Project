[Music: Gryaznov; Lyrics: Gryaznov/Markov]

I hear how the ocean waves make their way to the shore
I feel how the traces of sunshine reflect off my skin
I see how the children around me are playing their war
But all of this junk is too happy for me to believe in

Cause still I can hear
The voices of the wind
Memories of those friends who are gone forever
How could I miss the day
That took them all away
And now they are all asleep in the cradle of war

I've gone too far
Nothing's left of my life
And nothing's coming my way
The sun goes down
Somewhere deep, in my mind
I hear them callin' again
