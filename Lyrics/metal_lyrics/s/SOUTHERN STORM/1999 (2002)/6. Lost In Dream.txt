[ Adnan Omerovic ]

Your love is like a flame
Burning in my chest
Your blood red like rose dancing slowly on my hand 
Your word is like a fist
Crushing down my lies
Your eyes are the beast I see them feast on my mind

Lonely as I am
Inside my memories

I will never be the same
Cause consequences are deep
And you are the one who's made me ill

Walls are built up in my soul
Making of me two laws
And making of me empty hole

Searching for direction
Which will guide me trough the sea of dream
I can't see what is coming I can't see what is real

Now I'm crossing to the other side
Why must we die
Dream will take my soul away
