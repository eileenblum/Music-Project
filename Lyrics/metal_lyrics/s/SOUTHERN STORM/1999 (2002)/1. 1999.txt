[Emir Hot]

In your strange and misty eyes
There's no pain, no dark, but no one can stop you cryin'
Many words spoken dry
Can be wet if you change the past then you won't die 
Green goes behind circles are in vain
Just the sigh of a generous soul can show the right way

Burning nights and rumors scare
Ocean says inside is a devil's dance
Endless sky like steeled wall
Devil's name engraved in the headless stone

It sounds like storm without a name
Golden dreams unrealized just passing by like wind
