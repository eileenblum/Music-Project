[Adnan Omerovic]

In hope in waiting
I dream my life and dream I live
I see my face
I see my past but something's missed

Day is lost
And life is getting short
Night is coming to take my life and soul

In the hall where everybody fall
In a dream where everybody can feel
Life will be, like misery
Life will be, like misery

Aha get me out of here
From life-dying flame
Wake me up and let me see ...
make me real

I wanna go
But your chains won't set me free
And there's your face
There are your arms around my knees

Day is lost
And life is getting short
From my soul I hear a helpless voice

In the hall where everybody fall
In a dream where everybody can feel
Life will be, like misery
Life will be, like misery

Aha get me out of here
From life-dying flame
Wake me up and let me see ...
make me real

And here I am and there you are
But something between us is making us blind
We live and we die

Aha get me out of here
From life-dying flame
Wake me up and let me see ...
make me real
