[Dario Havel]

Time is healing
Pain I'm going through
I'm on my own again
Pale lights, lonely nights
Minutes are now far too long 
Darkness, sorrow
Feels like there's no tomorrow
Days are hollow
For me is too late
I feel hope sleeps away
Haven't time to say Something that I never thought I would

Was to open hearted and now I see
I regret you meant something to me
With stream of life my dreams will flow
Fragile as they always were

And I'm feeling
Time is healing wounds
I'm on my own again
Pale lights lonely nights
Minutes are now far too long

Now I see
What you fake and what is real
You blinded me
I'm falling with my broken dreams
