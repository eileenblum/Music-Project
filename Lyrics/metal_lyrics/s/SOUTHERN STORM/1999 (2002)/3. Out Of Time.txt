[Adnan Omerovic]

Who will be my love
My savior my guide
When I cross the line of the no time 
The smell of dawn
The chime of the knell
Displacing my soul into the dark cage

What's the point of life when hate is everything
What is the use of me when fear is getting me

In this form I cannot be whole
In this life I can't survive
Through my life time is passing by
Now I see I cannot die

Searching for source
Of restorer of morphe
I felt the breath of solitary whisper

You have got to fall
On the bottom of life
To be displaced into the dark cage
