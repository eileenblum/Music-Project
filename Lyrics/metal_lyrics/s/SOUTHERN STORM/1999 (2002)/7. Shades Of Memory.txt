[Dario Havel]

Life brings moments
You can turn and run
You must face it
It has to be done 
Just ordinary day
As any other
Ordinary thoughts
No dark clouds to cover them

But there's storm coming
And you never know
When rain start falling
That the time will stand still

Shadows of the past
Passing me I see your face
But there's a fact I can't ignore
I can't see you anymore

Dark face coming
And it takes your hand
Now dreams are nightmares
And you go away

So this is last good-bye
Haven't send rain to cry

Forever in my thoughts
Forever in my heart
