I've given up everything 'till it seems so fucking wrong
I've always been tied to you, now the bond is fucking gone
You're just a victim
Of your own decisions
And your desperation
Is like watching an accident

I reject the way you need
To hurt yourself to get to me
I will break away from you
My regret is knowing you

You've thrown away everything and you hope I sympathize
It's kind of like slavery to a world of fucking lies
You're not the victim
Of your own addictions
And your desperation
Now you won't get my sympathy

This feels like slavery
This ends it all
This feels like slavery
This ends it all
