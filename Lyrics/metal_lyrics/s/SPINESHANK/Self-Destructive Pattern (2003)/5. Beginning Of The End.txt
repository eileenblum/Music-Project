The irritation we're pretending not to show
Has replaced the motivation
That I had not long ago
I know that

I don't ever want to be the one
to make you forget it
to make you resent it
to make you repress it
I don't ever want to be

It's the beginning of the end
And I don't know where we lost control
It's the beginning of the end
And I know that I am all alone

Interrogation has replaced the trust we had
Your misguided accusations
Helping me to turn my back
I know that

I don't ever want to be the one
to make you divide it
to make you deny it
to make you deprive it
I don't ever want to be

I thought that we would find our way
I thought our life would be ok
I thought that you believed in me
But now it seems so far away

The life we knew before is gone
There is no compromising
The life you save will be your own
To find your inner senses
