Now your failure feeds the contempt
I can't sedate the way you break me down
I can't relieve the pain
I can't reduce the failure you've become
I can't accept the blame now

Now your failure feeds the contempt

You imitate the things you think
That isolate what I want
I can't get through it's never you
It's showing through and it's wrong

You pushed me too far and I'm tired now
It all falls apart now I'm finally down

I hate the way you turn this all around
So you can bleach your shame
Apology is not an option now
It won't erase the blame now

Now your failure feeds the contempt

It's nothing new I'll suffer through
It's all in you an you're wrong
I compensate, you mutilate
It separated and we're done

I can't sedate the way you're breaking me
You're breaking me down
