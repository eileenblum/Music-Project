I don't think you want to be the one to see inside yourself
I don't think you want to understand that it clouds up your mind
I don't think you want to undermine
I don't think you want the bottomline
I don't think you want to see inside this goal that you've created

No, you don't even listen
You don't even hear me until I scream at you
Now, I see your intention
A new intervention just to wear me down
Breed, selected division
You're on a collison course with your beliefs
Find a new evolution
You're full of sollutions now that you're born again

Reborn like a motherfucking stillborn
All devoid of feeling reborn
All devoid of feeling

I don't think you'll ever be the one to take the blame yourself
I don't think you'd even want to try to see through different eyes
I don't think you want to sacrifice
I don't think you want to fucking try
I don't think you want to step outside this lie that's been inbedded

Think, it's all a delusion
Relieve your confusion when you put me down
Fear, afraid to accept it
You only defend it 'cause it's handed down
Faith, it's all on the surface
It's only convenient when you follow through
No, I'm not gonna give in
You're already beaten when you're born again

It's time to make the cut
And let you bleed for yourself on your own
Of all the things I need
Is just for you to stop from judging me

Sick
So get the fuck away from me
You make me sick
So stay the fuck away from me

Reborn like a motherfucking stillborn
