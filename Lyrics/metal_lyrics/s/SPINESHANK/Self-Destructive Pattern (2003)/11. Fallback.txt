Give me life, give me faith
Give me something to see
Give me life, give me change
Give me somewhere to be
Give me love, give me hate
Tell me what to believe
I don't care who you're imitating

You think the world's beginning
In truth it's really ending
My disillusioned mind is wasting away

Until I break, until I bend
Until I fall back on my faith again
Until my world is caving in
Until I fall back on my faith again

Keep me dumb, keep me small
Keep me closer to you
Keep me still, keep it all
Keep away from the truth
Keep me here, keep me cool
'cause it's already done
Everything is so intimidating

You are the one reflection
Created false rejection
I let you in and now you won't go away

I think the end is closer now
You took the life inside me now
Is this the way you're checking out?
You are the one who's running now

You are the one reflection
Created false rejection
I let you in and now you won't go away

Until I break
