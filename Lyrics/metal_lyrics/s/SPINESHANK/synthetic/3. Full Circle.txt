My mind is only of your demise
But i find that your still ill
My life is nothing but stolen lies
So i look for a life to steal
My kind is livin' a life that dies
But my eyes see human life
This time im starting to recognise
But its pointless to save my life

I've come full circle
I've come full circle
I've come full circle
I've come full circle

Its just the meaning that i
Everything's for a life
Im everything that im supposed to be until i die
I never wanted this but it still happened this way
I just want to repress but you wont let me

If you leave me now i wonder what would happen to my world
Your just a never healing sore..beating me

I tried believing your honest face
Cuz it helps make the time pass by
Unlike that time ive been dead for days
So i mourn rather than confine

I've come full circle
I've come full circle
I've come full circle
I've come full circle

Its all what you did to me
Then i became this way
But still the time slips away
Forcing me to stay i try to stay on top
But you fucked me instead i dont want to commit
I just want to forget

If you leave me now i wonder what would happen to my world
Your just a never healing sore..beating me
