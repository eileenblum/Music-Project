Well i feel that all this becomes this waste that we call life
And its real yet i hate all the things that i've become

Why the smiles become a waste of time i get this empty feeling
Thats only becoming my friend this is gone im home as only you can see
I want to know why this happening to me

Still you try but at times like this i cant believe your lies
And i feel that the same is happening to you so

Why the smiles become a waste of time i get this empty feeling
Thats only becoming my friend this is gone im home as only you can see
I want to know why this happening to me

All myself and its still becoming
All myself and its still becoming
All myself and its still becoming
All myself and its still becoming

I fall asleep inside my head because frustrations all thats left
I cant afford to work this out because frustrations all I

Still we try but at times like this they wont believe our lies
And we know why all of this is happening so
Why the smiles become a waste of time i get this empty feeling
Thats only becoming my friend this is gone i'm home as only you can see
I want to know why this happening to me

All myself and its still becoming
All myself and its still becoming 
All myself and its still becoming
All myself and its still becoming
