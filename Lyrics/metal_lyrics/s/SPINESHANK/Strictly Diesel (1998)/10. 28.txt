[featuring Burton C. Bell (Fear Factory)]

Don't you realize that it has to be
Why did you do this, consolidate my fear

Face down Save face

Growing out of my face, what it represents I need
Why did you do this, consolidate my fears

It's all inside of me
It's depraved
Grows inside of me
And it suffocates

Don't wish...it won't help

Face down Save face

It's all inside of me
It's depraved
Grows inside of me
And it suffocates

Face down Save face
