One time feel the restraint take
Disposed, pull my head away
Fall down, reject what's in front of me
But I feed the open intent
Let you relieve it if it's what you needed to achieve it
Slow down, my breath can it feel right
But they tried to question my insight
And I start to blister without
Flowing through my tongue starts to grow

It's now retired - enter me
Come inside my empathy
It's now retired - enter me
Let it go and you will see

Would you fuckin' try to calm down
What else would you put me through
While I watched what happened to you
Now you say I need to put it all away
Your regret keeps me going cause you beat me to it
You tell me how I should feel
Try and stop always changing what you want to see
Can you keep your higher ground when you look straight
Cause where we fall is where we rise

It's now retired - enter me
Come inside my empathy
It's now retired - enter me
Let it go and you will see

Why we fall, I look at myself, I'm feeling small
And now I fall

For all of my life, is this what you sold me?

One time feel the restraint take
Disposed, pull my head away
Fall down, reject what's in front of me
Still I feed the open intent
Let you relieve it if it's what you needed to achieve it
Slow down my breath can it feel right
But they tried to question my insight
And I start to blister without
Flowing through my tongue starts to grow

It's now retired - enter me
Come inside my empathy
It's now retired - enter me
Let it go and you will see

Do I even fucking care?
