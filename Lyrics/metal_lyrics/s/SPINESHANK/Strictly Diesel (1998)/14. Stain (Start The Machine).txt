[featuring Burton C. Bell (Fear Factory)]

Fall in denial of
I break, I give into myself
Control, I break
I cannot be saved again
Before you take all that was to be mine
Give in because everything you taught will become

Burned - in my mind
Burned - redefined
Burned - sterilized
Burned - why?

Stain all the undeserved
Deny, my insight has become
Control, I break
Suffocate inside me
Before you take all that was to be mine
Break it down cause everything you taught will become

Burned - in my mind
Burned - redefined
Burned - sterilized
Burned - why?

Start the machine...
