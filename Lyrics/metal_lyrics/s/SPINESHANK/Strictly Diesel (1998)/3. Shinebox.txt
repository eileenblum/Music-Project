Confide in you, decide it's true

Forced on me and then you don't like it
Forced on me and then you don't like it
Forced on me and then you don't like it
Forced on me and then you don't like it

I break in two because of you

Forced on me and then you don't like it
Forced on me and then you don't like it
Forced on me and then you don't like it
Forced on me and then you don't like it

Seems to be a crime and so you feed it more
Seems to be a crime and so you feed it more
Seems to be a crime and so you feed it more
Seems to be

So sad, what if you don't like it, you don't like it
So sad, what if you don't like it, you don't like it, you lose

You get it

Don't lie to me...
