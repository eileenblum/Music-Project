I've reached this point
With fear my only fuel
I found my faith
With nothing, nothing to do

Run from you...you're binding me in sin
You've got to...

I drowned my left side
With lies I see as real
I push what doesn't move
I keep forgetting what is real

Run from you...you're binding me in sin
You've got to run
I keep on running from you
Keep on fighting me, come on

Slipper
Whore...you fuckin' whore

I've reached this point with fear my only fuel

Run from you...you're binding me in sin
You've got to run
I keep on running from you
Keep on fighting me, come on

Slipper
Whore...you fuckin' whore
