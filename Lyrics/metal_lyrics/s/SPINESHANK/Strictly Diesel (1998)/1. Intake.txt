Quiet smiles, what you hide
Product of frustration
No regrets for what you feel
Don't pray that it's mistaken

Crawl, starting the machine
Embellish everything that made you want me
Crawl, starting the machine
Regret disgusting thoughts that made you want me

Separate, what you see
Has given sight new meaning
Letting go to use the drug
That's really left you fiening

Crawl, starting the machine
Embellish everything that made you want me
Crawl, starting the machine
Regret disgusting thoughts that made you want me

Open your hand - Close your mind - Now it's real

If you could open up that light socket up in your head, what would you see?
Damn, but it's been closed temporarily
From that it's so sudden, feels like you wanna close
Your muthafucking eyes and take a look in the mirror

Crawl, starting the machine
Embellish everything that made you want me
Crawl, starting the machine
Regret disgusting thoughts that made you want me

Open your hand - Close your mind - Now it's real
