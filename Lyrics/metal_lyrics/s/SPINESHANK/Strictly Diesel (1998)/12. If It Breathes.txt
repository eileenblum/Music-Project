If it breathes -- Choke it

How do I smile this way?
I shed the light but still I rely on
The fear that starts my day
I wonder, I wonder

What has to happen to make you see?
If nothing happens would you feel?
(I've got to take it)

If it breathes -- Choke it

I've stolen this abuse
All I have left is just these scars

What has to happen to make you see?
If nothing happens would you feel?
(I've got to take it)

You grow

Scars

What has to happen to make you see?
If nothing happens would you feel?
(I've got to take it)

You grow
