What do you believe?
Or do you still conceive?
What do you believe?

See what you do to me
You feed off my mind, well then you break my ability
To maintain a 20/20 vision on life
So why not let the pain go...

Detached, crawl inside my head
Open up my mind is all they told me
Detached, and I don't relate to your fantasy
But I'm detached

What do you want from me?
There's nothing left to bleed
What do you want from me?

See what you do to me
You feed off my mind, well then you break my ability
To maintain a 20/20 vision on life
So why not let the pain go...

Detached, crawl inside my head
Open up my mind is all they told me
Detached, and I don't relate to your fantasy
But I'm detached

Away, there's no shame
I can't stop the bleeding

Fall - who killed the lights on me?
Fall - that's how it has to be
Fall - someday you'll come to see
Fall

Don't let it rain, don't let it rain...

Detached, crawl inside my head
Open up my mind is all they told me
Detached, and I don't relate to your fantasy
But I'm detached

Don't you let it rain...
