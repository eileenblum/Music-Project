Forgive me for all you've done

If I led your eyes to see
If I fed your mind with sickened thoughts
Would you consciously conceive
Everything that I have offered you?

Shame
Stronger than
Pride
Stronger than
Hate
Stronger than
Life

If I lied to you would you still believe?
Mend your soul from my little fucking game

Forgive me for all you've done

Have I made your life a mess?
Is your soul perverted just like mine?
Inconvenienced by distress
Let it go, there's nowhere left to hide

Shame
Stronger than
Pride
Stronger than
Hate
Stronger than
Life

If I lied to you would you still believe?
Mend your soul from my little fucking game

Stronger than life
