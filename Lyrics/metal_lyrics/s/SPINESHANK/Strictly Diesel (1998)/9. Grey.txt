Undo this guilt, bathing in filth

Grey that lurks inside of me
Grey, feel I can't take it
Grey that works inside of me
Grey

Slowly I run, hurt me for fun

Grey that lurks inside of me
Grey, feel I can't take it
Grey that works inside of me
Grey

See is all I say - all I see is grey
See is all I say - all I see is grey

Grey...all I see is grey

Undo this guilt, bathing in filth

Grey that lurks inside of me
Grey, feel I can't take it
Grey that works inside of me
Grey

See is all I say - all I see is grey
See is all I say - all I see is grey

All I see is grey...
