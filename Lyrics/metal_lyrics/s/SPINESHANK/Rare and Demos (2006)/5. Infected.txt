I'm infected by you,
I feel so sick
I've always focused on my own impurities
Its the way I believe,
I'm suffering
And you saw it as an insecurity

I
feed the weakness in me
Keep me drowning in my desperation
I'm
getting used to the pain
Feel so honest when its so abusive

Pretend that I still carry on
And my world surrounds you
Rejecting you to break my mold
And my lies around you

I surrender to you,
I cannot think
You are making my decisions for me now
As you crippled my thoughts
And nauseate
When you weaken sedate and keep me down

I!
Tried to give up on you
Tried to throw away my own decisions
I!
take the anger in me
Make me feel like I'm the opposition

Pretend that I still carry on,
And my world surrounds you
Rejecting you to break my mold
And my lies around you

Pretend that I still carry on,
And my world surrounds you
Rejecting you to break my mold
And my lies around you

I'm infected by you, I'm infected by you,
I'm infected by you
You need to let go of me
I'm infected by you (I'm infected)
You need to let go of me (I'm infected)
I'm infected by you (I'm infected)
You need to let go of me (I'm infected)
I'm infected by you
YOU NEED TO LET GO OF ME!
YOU NEED TO LET GO OF ME!

Pretend that I still carry on,
And my world surrounds you
Rejecting you to break my mold
And my lies around you

Pretend that I still carry on,
And my world surrounds you
Rejecting you to break my mold
And my lies around you
