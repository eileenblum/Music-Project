I am not the one that you believe in
I will not become what you conceive and
You're the one who dug yourself a hole
And I'm not there to hear you cry for help
I will not be there (to hear you call for me)
I will not be there (to hear you lie to me)

I, never wanted your intentions
My, time is based on your decisions

I intend to stay away from you
I won't end up the way you want me to
And I became afraid of what you are
And I have failed to speak my mind so far
And I no longer care (to show you sympathy)
I no longer care (to show you empathy)

I, never wanted your intentions
My, time is based on your decisions

You built this wall around you
Who's around to help you tear it down
Can't help you any longer
Pull you under

You will never be
