It dies
Drowned in bottled misery
Decay a design of the therapy
At birth
Broke, it's out of control
Repeating the cycle and evolving down a hole
Constrained
Chained with the force of a tourniquet
But it bleeds and it's out of control
Unhinged
Lost and completely devoid
Running in circles trying to fill another void

This Life
Devised
Demise
Repeating the cycle
This time I die inside
Repeating the cycle again
I am damage this time

I try to reason with myself this time
I've found a trigger to the rage
Diseased with the anger still enraged
Blind
Now it's under control
I'm falling to pieces but I still won't let it go
Too late hate it's out of control this time
Break the cycle at the end  of the line
Consumed
Torn and dying within
Trying to fight but I don't know where to begin

This Life
Devised
Demise
Repeating the cycle
This time I die inside
Repeating the cycle again
I am damage this time

And it comes right back to me
Like a fucking catastrophe

You'll see me devolve to nothing
It's just the way it is
Recognize the damage I've become

I am the damage born again
Cast out the creation of my descent
Degrade
Hate everythign close
I'm over it all but I'm still not in control

This Life
Devised
Demise
Repeating the cycle
This time I die inside
Repeating the cycle again
I am damage this time

And it comes right back to me
Like a fucking catastrophe
