Cut
Pain divides
Your descent
From all the 
Damage that you have become
Blame yourself
Damage done
There is no coming back from this

No absolution from the ones you scar
You see you sorrow through the eyes of a victim
Contamination of the rising star
The anti-vision and design of a fractured intent

Spread your misery conspiracy
The restitution for you life

The depravation of your hidden lie
(Reveals) a muted memory of the damage inflicted
Interrogation with a blinded eye
Creates the scapegoat that
Replaces the need to repeat

Fall
Begin descent
Cannot prevent this life

There's no redemption 
For a life of this kind
And it will bleed out in time
The reckoning
Self-preservation
And the motives collinde
It's just a matter of time
The reckoning

There's no reason now
Design of a fractured intent
Fall
Begin descent
Cannot prevent this life

There's no redemption 
For a life of this kind
And it will bleed out in time
The reckoning
Self-preservation
And the motives collinde
It's just a matter of time
The reckoning
