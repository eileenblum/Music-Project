The curse of darkness falls
Upon the hands of sin
When everybody looks away
The master shuffles
Without guilt to make them win
And we lose another day
They don't give a fuck about you

I want you to know
That you shouldn't be here
Should be afraid of what I have found
I think you should go
Or you'll never leave here
The life that you know is forever bound

Serenity lies in the hearts that still believe
But some of them fall short of faith, are we selfish?
That, in fact we do deceive believing
While we will not say, will not say
They still don't give a fuck about you

I want you to know
That you shouldn't be here
Should be afraid of what I have found
I think you should go
Or you'll never leave here
The life that you know is forever bound

Did you think that I would change?
You're the one that plays the murder
With your absence all in vain
Never see the light of day
It's the path that you have crossed
It's a link of broken chain
It's a coin that's been tossed
It's your life that I contain

I want you to know
I need you to know
Just so you know
They'll never give a fuck about you

I want you to know
That you shouldn't be here
Should be afraid of what I have found
I think you should go
Or you'll never leave here
The life that you know is forever bound
I want you to know
That I'll always be here
Should be afraid of what I've become
I guess you should know that I might just keep you
The life that you've lost and never found
