We were the damage blueprint
Who put the pain aside
It never felt this way
Till we began to die
You have a gunshot mindframe
With a victim style
I've never seen false hope
Decorated with a prettier smile

We divide
It's like you're bleeding out my eyes
We both die
Just like a murder-suicide

It took the second coming
Of the second fail
To make it look so easy
To bury in shallow ground
There's something beautiful
About your suffering
It's a welcome sight
When we're seeing God through bloodshot eyes

We divide
It's like you're bleeding out my eyes
We both die
Just like a murder-suicide

Murder-suicide

Just a little fracture
It's just a little fracture
Just a little fracture
Or a clean break?
It seems you want to heal all your own
You never reject the demons all alone
It looks like we have found a way to die...but alone

Hoping for a savior
But we're beyond God
Leave me where I fall
You decided, done
Needed an escape route
From which we flee
Punishment upon us
We will die alone

We divide
It's like you're bleeding out my eyes
We both die
Just like a murder-suicide

We divide
It's like you're bleeding out my eyes
We both die
Just like a murder-suicide

Murder-suicide
