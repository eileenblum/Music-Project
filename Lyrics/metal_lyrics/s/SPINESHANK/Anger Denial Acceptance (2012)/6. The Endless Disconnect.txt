I see all your reasons why
It's just the way the your memory betrays
You're like a second hand at suicide
It's just defeat of the image you portray
It all serves you
But who deserves you?
It's how you blur out the vision left inside
A clean infection
Your misdirection
It's you delusion that begins the end of you

Now you've fallen to the ground
The kill just compensated
It's all the endless disconnect
That keeps you isolated

Break and bleed until you see the light
No need struggle 'cause it never seems to fade
It all becomes a social suicide
Another way to keep your damage on display
Your faith is empty
Your hope is fleeting
I'm not impressed with
The way you followed through
There's no redemption
You're disconnected
It's your seclusion
That will kill what's left of you

Now you've fallen to the ground
The kill just compensated
It's all the endless disconnect
That keeps you isolated

Your star's fading
You're just a memory
And I expected nothing less of you
It always bleeds
Just for your needs
Now I see exactly what you are

Now you've fallen to the ground
The kill just compensated
It's all the endless disconnect
That keeps you isolated
Now you've fallen to the ground
The kill just compensated
It's all the endless disconnect
That keeps you isolated
