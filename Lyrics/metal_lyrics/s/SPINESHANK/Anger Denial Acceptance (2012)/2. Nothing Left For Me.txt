You found a way to get inside
And see the broken
Reliving such a damaged life
It's taking over
Now you see through fading eyes
It's like I'm disappearing now
You made me who I am
You're everything I hate in me

And now there's nothing left for me

You found a comfort in the wounds
It's like you taste the blood again
The way you go in for the kill
And now there's nothing left for me
You don't exist outside of me
All your selfish purity
Is just a fragile memory
And now there's nothing left for me

Find a way to kill the past
And stop the bleeding
Reduce you to a photograph
That won't stop fading
I look at you and see nothing
You've taken everything from me
I hope you saved yourself
I'll never be the same again

You found a comfort in the wounds
It's like you taste the blood again
The way you go in for the kill
And now there's nothing left for me
You don't exist outside of me
All your selfish purity
Is just a fragile memory
And now there's nothing left for me

I see a ghost of who you are
Now your memory is a scar
The constant need to kill
The senses that keep you tied to me
Just to keep your focus right
You dilute to black and white
It doesn't stop
The fading view of who you are

And now there's nothing left for me

You found a comfort in the wounds
It's like you taste the blood again
The way you go in for the kill
And now there's nothing left for me
You don't exist outside of me
All your selfish purity
Is just a fragile memory
And now there's nothing left for me
