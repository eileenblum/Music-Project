Bury the one I used to know
The memory is fading
Feels like and endless suicide
Degenerating
Withdrawal
Rewrite
You're overcompensating
Suspend belief
Your faith is so persuading

Anger God Complex

Destroy your God and bleed out

Just skin the soul
Expose the core
And medicate it
Then rape the heart and be the Whore
You animate it
Devise
Destroy
These dreams have long but faded
It's true
It's pure
It's not just real
It's all I know

Destroy your God

Anger God Complex

Destroy your God and bleed out
