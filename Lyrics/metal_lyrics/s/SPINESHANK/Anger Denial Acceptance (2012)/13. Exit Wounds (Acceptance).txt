When she feels
Is just short of nothing
But she's still more than something
I can't 
No I can't watch her cry
While she cries
I'm calling out your name
But still resistant
Who assumes the blame?
And then it all comes down
To the suffering you felt
Intended just for me
For me, It's all for me

If you take this all away
And it still keeps bleeding
While your God looked the other way
Did it all mean nothing?

It's sinking in
I'm still adjusting
Below the dream
Was just dysfunction
Memories
I've half erased
Have replaced this life
That's dead and left behind
It's soothing like a murder
What did you bury?
The world that is collapsing
Keeps the tragedy relapsing
And it's gone

If you take this all away
And it still keeps bleeding
While your God looked the other way
Did it all mean nothing?

Conscience broken
Words aren't spoken
Conscience is broken
Words aren't spoken
For me
For me
It's all for me
To see
It's just for me
She fucks him violently
For me
It's just for me
Disease is all I know
Nothing means anything to me
She fucks him violently
For me
It's just for me
Disease is all I leave
For me
It's all for me
It all comes to an end
For me
It's just for me
