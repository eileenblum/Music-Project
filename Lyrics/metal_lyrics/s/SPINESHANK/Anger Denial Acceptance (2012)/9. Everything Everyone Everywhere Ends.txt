What you turned out to be
The fallen and the deceased
Embodied in the body of a fucking liar
You don't belong to yourself
You haven't suffered enough
You're like an answer
To another fucking murder
Show the way God left you alone
Find yourself another answer
Your decay
Is now creating
A venue for another murder

I'll close my eyes
Just to end the this cycle of torture and misery
I'll close my eyes just to see it all go
Everything, everyone ends
I'll close my eyes
Just to end the this cycle of torture and misery
I'll close my eyes just to see it all go
Everything, everyone ends

You're just my endless defeat
Another severed belief
Ad now your wasted life
Is flashing before my eyes
It's just another attempt
To be redeemed of yourself
It's just another way to grieve
The fucking murder
Choke you out
The attention you need
Harmless kill
Just another muder
Your decay
Venue for another murder

I'll close my eyes
Just to end the this cycle of torture and misery
I'll close my eyes just to see it all go
Everything, everyone ends
I'll close my eyes
Just to end the this cycle of torture and misery
I'll close my eyes just to see it all go
Everything, everyone ends

She, she's beautiful
But it's meaningless
The way she fakes that smile
Irrational
She's cynical
It's killing me again
Killing me again

She, well she's beautiful
But it's merciless
Because she closed her eyes
Unreachable
And it's terminal
She's killing me again
Killing me again

Love - Raped and afflicted
Life - Soiled and fucked beyond
Sense - Devised, perfected
Lie - Everything everyone
Ends - Everything everywhere
Ends - Everything everyone ends
Your life means nothing
