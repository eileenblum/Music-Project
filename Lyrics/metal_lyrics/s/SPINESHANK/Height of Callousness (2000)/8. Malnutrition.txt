Dismiss your true state of mind 
'Cause it's too hard to be 
Convince yourself it's a lie 
The guilt you do achieve 
Failure disguised your choice 
You need another voice 
Regrets confirmed your faults 
I need another voice 

You're too far gone 

Disengage yourself 
To replace yourself 
Look right through yourself 
And deny yourself 

Guilt, it's in your voice 
It's on your face 
But it looks malnourished 
Greed, it took control 
And fed your mind 
But it's still malnourished 

The contradictions you live 
Have canceled out the truth 
The desperation you show 
Is just the focal point 
Nothing more than image 
You need anothe voice 
Your faults became regret 
I need another choice 

You're too far gone 

Realign yourself 
To escape yourself 
See right through yourself 
Give up on yourself 

Guilt, it's in your voice 
It's on your face 
But it looks malnourished 
Greed, it took control 
And fed your mind 
But it's still malnourished
