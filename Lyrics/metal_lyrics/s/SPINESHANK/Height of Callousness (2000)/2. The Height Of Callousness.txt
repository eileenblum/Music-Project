My frustration caused the callous 
Turned my senses into spite 
My perception with no conscience 
Made the fear seem almost right 

I was unaffected for so long 
Now I'm fucking ruined 
I was desperation for so long 
Now it's fucking gone 

Can I see it? Can I see it? Can I see it? Can I? 
I can't even recognize myself 
I turned into what destroyed it 
Drown the truth out until it all makes sense again 

I was unaffected for so long 
Now I'm fucking ruined 
I was desperation for so long 
Now it's fucking gone 

Take my fucking conscience from me 
Try to save me from myself 
Turn my fucking thoughts against me 
Now my ways will be dissolved 

Fuck integrity 
Fuck integrity 

My frustration caused the callous 
Turned my senses into spite 
My perception with no conscience 
Made the dear seem almost right 

I was unaffected for so long 
Now I'm fucking ruined 
I was desperation for so long 
Now it's fucking gone 

Take my fucking conscience from me 
Try to save me from myself 
Turn my fucking thoughts against me 
Now my ways will be dissolved 

The height of callousness 
The height of callousness takes over 
The height of callousness 
The height of callousness it's over 

Fuck integrity 
Fuck integrity
