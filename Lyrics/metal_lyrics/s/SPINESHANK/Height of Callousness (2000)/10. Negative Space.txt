I don't have what you need 
You don't know but I still see 
The situation brings me down 

See wasted days inside me 
No changing ways becoming 
Falling away from nothing 
Sobering days, I'm dying now 

I don't care what you want 
You don't know I'm already gone 
The situation brings me down 

See wasted days inside me 
No changing ways becoming 
Falling away from nothing 
Sobering days, I'm dying now 

What I feel everyday 
Keeps everything nice and cold 
I'm not sure what you need 
It's not me anymore 
All of our memories are just a thought away 
Get the fuck away from me 

See wasted days inside me 
No changing ways becoming 
Falling away from nothing 
Sobering days, I'm dying now
