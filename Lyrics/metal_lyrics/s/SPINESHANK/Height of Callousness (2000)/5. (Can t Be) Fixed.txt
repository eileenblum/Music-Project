It goes beneath what I've done 
It's bigger than the helplessness I felt 
It comes around without a face 
And redefines my subconscience again 

I can't be fixed 
I can't be fixed 
I can't be fixed 
'Cause I won't change 
Stall 

Reverse the cause to numb the sense 
It's meaningless if I can't be ashamed 
I latch myself onto the need 
The only thing that isolates me now 

I can't be fixed 
I can't be fixed 
I can't be fixed 
'Cause I won't change 
Stall 

It goes beneath who I am 
And turns into the recklessness I felt 
It comes around without a face 
And redefines my subconscience for good 

I can't be fixed 
I can't be fixed 
I can't be fixed 
'Cause I won't change 
Stall
