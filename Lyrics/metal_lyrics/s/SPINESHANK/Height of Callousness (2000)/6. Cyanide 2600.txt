Your disease is a fucking waste of time 
Turn it on when it fits your needs 
Never mattered that I couldn't feel a thing 
Anything you meant was forgot 

Tear it down, it's what you don't know 
Turn it around because it questions your integrity 
Take it away because you can't control it 
Throw it away because its what you are 

Your tongue's a dying wasted lie 
I've seen through you when you need 
What makes you think it's not your fault 
Everything you were is so far gone 

You don't want to know if you don't get it 
Everything you touch is dead or terminal 
Everything you were walks away from me 
Everything you were is lost 

Realize what you've become 
Criticize to make it all numb 
Separate yourself from your views 
What it takes to redeem yourself 

I can see it start to begin 
Everything that you thought was so clear 
Shutting down what you thought was real 

Giving up to a lesser God 
It's all you're worth and it's all you were 
Shutting down what you thought was real 
What it takes to redeem yourself 

Realize what you've become 
Criticize to make it all numb 
Separate yourself from your views 
What it takes to redeem yourself 

What it takes to redeem yourself 
It's all you're worth...
