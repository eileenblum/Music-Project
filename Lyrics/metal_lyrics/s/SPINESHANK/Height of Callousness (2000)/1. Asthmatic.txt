It starts to tear me down 
Destroyed by what I create 
It left the nerve exposed 
Feels like a lost cause 
Frustration's all I have left 
It's what reduced me to this 
Turned me against myself 
It's still a lost cause 

I can't keep doing this to myself 
But it's the only way to forget who I am 

Your disability 
Kept pushing me away 
It went beneath what's so real to me 
And threw it all away 
I underestimated 
The lengths that you would have gone 
To deny who you are 
You threw it all away

I will keep doing this to myself

'Cause it's the only way to forget who I am 

I never wanted your help
I never needed your help

This failure has to be all mine all mine now
I'll turn my back on myself 
If it's my only way out 
It can only help me if it hurts 

I won't give into, I won't give into... 
I won't become one with your lies

I never wanted your help 
I never needed your help 
This failure has to be all mine all mine now 
I'll turn my back on myself 
If it's my only way out 
I'm too tired to feel anything anyway 

I will keep doing this to myself 
'Cause it's the only way to forget who I am 

I never wanted your help 
I never needed your help 
This failure has to be all mine all mine now 
I'll turn my back on myself 
If it's my only way out 
I'm too tired to feel anything anyway 

I have become one with your lies
