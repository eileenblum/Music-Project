Promises made out of fright
Hands held tight all is calm tonight
I came here looking for a friend
To start again and it's goodbye my love

And everything went wrong today
I close my eyes but you won't go away
And we were raised to do what's right
And not react to whatever's thrown at us
And these games that we play...

Together we try and together we cry
It's us against the world
The hurt that they give 'cause we're licensed to live
It's us against the world

A gunshot echo in the night
No end in sight
I'm in the hands of luck
Came here for some peace of mind
Would you be kind
And help me on my way

And everything went wrong today
I close my eyes but it won't go away
And we were raised to do what's right
And not react to whatever's thrown at us
And these wars that we wage...

Together we try and together we cry
It's us against the world
The hurt that they give 'cause we're licensed to live
It's us against the world

Sister and brother father and mother
Something has got to give can't go much further
And these games that we play...

Together we try and together we cry
It's us against the world
The hurt that they give 'cause we're licensed to live
It's us against the world

Together we try and together we cry
It's us against the world
The hurt that they give 'cause we're licensed to live
It's us against the world
