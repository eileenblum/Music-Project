Like velvet to your touch
I put your name upon my arm
Delicious to my eyes
My bird of paradise

I thought that I knew you
I was so happy
You were my lover
And we were gospel

My substitute for sadness
Like porcelain in pieces

I believed in you I bowed down to you
I was the fool I loved you too
And you took me up and you shook me down
You're Judas you're Judas, Judas

Your apocalypse was mine
My sweet Mary
A tidal wave is coming
Wash away wash away

We drank of the water
Tripped on the rainbow
I was so happy
Is there a ghost of a chance now

Won't someone talk to me now
I'm porcelain in pieces in pieces

I believed in you I bowed down to you
I was the fool I loved you too
And you took me up and you shook me down
You're Judas you're Judas my Judas... Judas

Lover I thought I knew you
Say good bye to the old world
Behind the man eyes of a child
I hear I see you well

Would you talk with me
Come and walk with me
Give me a sign
Give me a clue

'Cause I loved you I was the fool
Believe in me believe in me
I'm Judas yeah Judas... Judas

I believed in you I bowed down to you
I was the fool I loved you too
And you took me up and you shook me down
You're Judas you're Judas my Judas
