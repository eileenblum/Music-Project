I've been going round in circles
History reveals its echoes
Do you show a little kindness
I can see only blindness

I've been searching for salvation
I can taste this desperation
Hide away this face in shame
Come on take me as I am

Come on and save me
Come on and free me
Come on and heal me
'Cause this is my God
I've found my God
This is my love... my love

You are the calm I am the war
Sleeping beauty on my bed
There's a whisper from the life force
And the season's running scared

Come on and save me
Come on and free me
Come on and touch me
'Cause this is my God
I've found my God
You are my love... my love

Blessed are the children
That are raised among killers
The making of an Einstein
The making of a Hitler

Can you hear me
For I'm only bleeding

Come on and save me
Come on and free me
Come on and touch me
'Cause this is my God
I've found my God
You are my love... my love

See me... hear me...
Touch me... love me...
