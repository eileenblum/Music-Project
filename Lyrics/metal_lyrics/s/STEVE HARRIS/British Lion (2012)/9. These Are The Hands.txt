These are the faces I know
This is the land I was born to
These are the people I know
This is the place that I come from

Don't ask me why
Why nothing stays the same
'Cause I've had to lie
It made me who I am

We live and we die
We're willing to try
Do you know who you are

And this is your time
In a new land of crime
Do you know who you are

This is the city I know
Where I was born and abandoned
These are the faces I know
The smiles cracked with the movement of life

And of pace I am a running man
You win and you lose
'Cause nothing stays the same

We live and we die
We're willing to try
Do you know who you are

And this is your time
In a new land of crime
Do you know who you are

We live and we die
We're willing to try
Do you know who you are

And this is your time
In a new land of crime
Do you know who you are

These are the hands that build the future
These are the hands we're one step closer
You were the first to launch a thousand dreams

These are the hands to build the future
These are the hands we're one step further
You are the Son You are the Father

These are the hands that build the future
These are the hands we're one step closer
You were the first to launch a thousand dreams

These are the hands that build the future
These are the hands we're one step closer
You are the son you are the father

Do you know who you are
Do you know who you are
Do you know who you are
