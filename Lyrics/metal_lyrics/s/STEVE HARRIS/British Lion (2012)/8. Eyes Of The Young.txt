Can you recall now the way it used to be
Kicking at the world we didn't need to see
Just you and me

We were young hearts riding in the sun
We never felt the pain
This world was giving everyone

We could do anything and leave the rest behind
And nothing could stand in our way
The truth behind the lies

In the eyes of the young
In the eyes of the young
I want to go back to my days
Back to my yesterdays
When all of my dreams were so real
To the eyes of the young

And through young eyes
I was born to be a king
I didn't know just how
But I'd bring this world to its knees

And those days are gone
The truth is on the streets
In the killing fields of life
Wasn't like this in my dreams

And as my father's words
Slowly fade away
Well those days are gone forever
Only in dreams at night

In the eyes of the young
In the eyes of the young
I want to go back to my days
Back to my yesterdays
When all of my dreams were so real
To the eyes of the young

And as I'm walking late at night
With a memory that'll never die
All the stars are shining
Like tears in my eyes
And I would give anything
To see you again
Can you hear me now... Oh I hear you

Share my dream with me...
