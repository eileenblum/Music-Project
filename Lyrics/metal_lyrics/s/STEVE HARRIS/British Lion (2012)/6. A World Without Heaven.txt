These days seem sad and lonely
True love has passed me by
I want you one and only
Too bad these tears I cry

How many heartaches must we take
How many more times must we break
We've all been caught out in the rain
The rain will fall...
The rain will fall

These days of roaring thunder
Come crashing to our world
No trust no heart no saviour
No place to hide my girl

The cross keeps on glowing like before
I don't want to see it anymore
This world of ours is worth fighting for

A world without heaven
A world where the angels used to fly
A world where the rain falls
Now the rain is falling from my eyes

These days make me want to cry
These days we're all living a lie
We go through life in search for heaven, heaven

The wind blows wild and free now
Got to catch me a ride
My love come follow me now
Don't let my dream just die

'Cause you may not get a second chance
Got to live life the best we can
Tonight I'll chase your nightmares away

From a world without heaven
A world where the angels used to fly
A world where the rain falls
Now the rain is falling from my eyes

These days make me want to cry
These days we're all living a lie
We go through life in search for heaven, heaven

These days make me want to cry
These days we're all living a lie
We go through life in search for heaven, heaven

These days make me want to cry
These days make me wanna die
We go through life in search for heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven
