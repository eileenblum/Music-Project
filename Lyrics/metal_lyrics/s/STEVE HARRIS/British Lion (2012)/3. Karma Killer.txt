With every wish a price to pay
You ridicule but things they do change
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
Deeper and deeper I'm falling

Come, where are you dreamers now
And for all our wrong
We'll make our own history

Karma killer, come together now
Come together now, karma killer

All your life of torment and tease
You're strong in numbers and put us on our knees
I wish I could shed this skin from my body
Voices are calling in your head

Why, why must it be this way
I cry this is your bitter reign

Karma killer, come together now
Come together now, karma killer

Bullets will fly on a cold black birthday
You want to feel what it's like to go down

Why, why must it be this way
And I cry
You've made your own history

Karma killer, come together now
Come together now, karma killer

Karma killer, come together now
Come together now, karma killer

(Judgement is here
Darkness will fall
Into the unknown
Karma killer)
