All that I know is changing now
Winter will come around too soon
Just like the leaves are changing colour
My face is like an open book

All that I see through my eyes
I must have something to believe
Leave me today I'm snowblind
The world is biting at my heels

I used to dream of mountains
That I would climb some day
I used to dream of lost worlds
That I would find some day

Don't tell me it's science that blinds me
But rather I need some true humanity
Let's question our faith and our purity

All that I've done in my life
I have lost friends and brothers
Now that I reach for new heights
Now that I rediscover

I used to dream of pictures
That I would paint some day
I used to live in my fear
I've been reborn today

Don't tell me its science that blinds me
But rather I need some true humanity
Let's question our gods and our purity

I used to dream of mountains
I used to dream of lost worlds
I used to live in my fear
I used to dream of pictures

I read the headlines today
How your young breath was taken away
There was a picture of your friends
Never to come this way again

And you look like someone I know
Open my eyes I must go

The sun goes down I tramp the dirt now
The water's warm and you can't swim
The morn is colder feeling younger
You can lie every once in a while
I read the headlines today...
