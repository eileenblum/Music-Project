Come on

Here they come walking with fire in their eyes
In these lands only the tough can survive
Here in the heartland you hear their cries
We'll fly the colours 'til the day that we die

Hear the sound the backstreet dance has begun
Walking proud the thundering hearts on the run

Left out on a cold winter's night
Just children we've got to survive

We are the chosen ones of the night
So young to be left all alone in the fight
Even though we are the strays
Say a prayer for better days
And they'll never break us down
'Cause we are the chosen ones ... yeah

Just a boy abandoned and left in the streets
Kicked on the outside but inside you can't touch me, no

I'm rising out of the gutters and pain
Take on the world you'll remember my name

We are the chosen ones of the night
So young to be left all alone in the fight
But you'll never see us cry
'Cause we're never gonna die
And they'll never break us down
'Cause we are the chosen ones ... yeah

And we're on the streets
And we're so cold
But we're rising up
We'll be the chosen ones

We are the chosen ones of the night
So young to be left all alone in the fight
But you'll never see us cry
'Cause we're never gonna die
And they'll never break us down
'Cause we are the chosen ones ... yeah

We are the chosen ones of the night
And we're rising up
