As I walk through corridors
Find a room to rest
Lay down there upon the bed
Rest my weary head

A labyrinth in suspension
Open up the veins
Take me to a dimension
Free me of this pain

Everything and all that I know
Is changing now
I wish I could slow things down

You can't predict
'Cause nothing's set in stone
A lesson learned
A lesson that's too late for learning

As I walk this lonely road
The sun begins to fade
There's many Gods and many ways
But I worship the wind

Now I could've done things better
Didn't mean to be unkind
And I could never cause you hurt
The last thing on my mind

Everything and all that I know
Is changing now
I wish I could slow things down

You can't predict
'Cause nothing's set in stone
A lesson learned
A lesson that's too late for learning
