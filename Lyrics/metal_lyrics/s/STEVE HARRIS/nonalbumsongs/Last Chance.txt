I can see it in your eyes
When your tongue is terrorized
Once you caught the scene
Can smear right through

This is through the bads gone wild
And I acted like a child
When this bitterness
Can smear right through

Why do we sit, why do we do
You know weÂ´re nothing else I like
Is this the end, donÂ´t say it is
You gotta give me one more try

ItÂ´s the last chance all night
We gotta get it out that shot
ItÂ´s the last chance
We can work it out, we can goodbye
I donÂ´t know the reason why
IÂ´m gonna stay and not let by

When the wind we work on you
Slab a tingle and come home
We will blood on dry
As hard as stone

Was when the night we swear on hope
We touched bloodworm worm
It discrips some more
Her eyes werenÂ´t out

Beth, I needed you, you need me
NothingÂ´s the way it used to be
Is this the end, donÂ´t say it is
We gotta give it one more try

ItÂ´s the last chance for night
We gotta get it out that shot
ItÂ´s the last chance
We can work it out, we can see it by
I donÂ´t mend that by
IÂ´m gonna stay and not let by

Last chanceâ¦last chanceâ¦last chance
Is this the end for once more

Woooo oooâ¦
