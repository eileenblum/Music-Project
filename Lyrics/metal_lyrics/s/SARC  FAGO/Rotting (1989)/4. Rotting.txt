People are blind with something
Can't make happen their desires
All from their god stinks
The reason must talk higher

Jesus is rotting
Jesus now died

The heart of sinners
Becomes too false
In their sacred week
They remember christ

Now the sinners are celebrating
His false resurrection

Why do you believe in christ?
Why do you believe that he isn't dead?
Why do you believe in those things?
Why do you believe in hell?

I just can say to you
That your lord jesus christ
Had a cruel destiny
And now you just can cry

Your hope is in vain
He will never come back
Jesus now burns in pain
'cause he found death
Jesus is rotting
Jesus now died
