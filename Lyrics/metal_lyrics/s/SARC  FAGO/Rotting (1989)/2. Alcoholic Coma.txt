Trapped in my room
Sodomizing a bitch
I open a smirnoff
And start to drink

After two litres
I go to the streets
Totaly drunk
And fainted to the ground

Through my veins
United with my blood
The alcohol is running wild

I can't stop
This pleasure to my flesh
'cause it turns me so excited

Now the walls are white
People around me
My end, in a hospital bed
Into the alcoholic coma
