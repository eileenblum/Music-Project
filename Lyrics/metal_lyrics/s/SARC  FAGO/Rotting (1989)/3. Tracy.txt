In the dark side of our brains
Can be hidden cruel desires
Sodomy, blood, death and sadism
It's so good to turn them into reality

Tracy you hurt me and broke my heart
Don't giving me pleasure acting so coldly
Putting my lust and feelings apart
Tracy I loved you and didn't wanna do it

Your rotten flesh is now so sweet
Too cold you are driving me to a intense orgasm
Licking your body I realize my dream
Why did you force me to kill?

You lied to me
And just now I can see it

You closed your legs
But I couldn't resist

Now I remember that night of lust
When you gave me your last scorn
Was so tasty to see you dying
And your last breath when
You looked to me
With blood in your eyes

Slowly your flesh
Turning cold like ice
