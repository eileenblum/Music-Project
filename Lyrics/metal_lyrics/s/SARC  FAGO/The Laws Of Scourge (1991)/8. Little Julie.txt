Voluptuous convulsions twisting my soul
So pure and dirty is my passing for you
In my secrets I got my torment
Why did you leave me when I put you my love?

Back to the winter of '87
I still remember that day as if now
You dressed that sweaty blue dress
In front of your home talking to your friends

So with desire you looked at me
Sentencing me with that burning smile

Your sweet eleven years old was an
Eternity of torture to me

But you love me, I know that
And tonight your body will be mine
Come with me my sweet little darling
I will show you a new world
Where you never has been before

In my secrets I got my torment
Your sweet eleven years old was an
Eternity of torture to me
But I don't care if your body is so cold now

I don't need to carry this fuckin' cross
I'm not trying to be the new messiah
What is moral in this stupid world?
You died for me, won't do the same for you

I will put you all my hate
Show me the delights locked in your mind
You don't need to be afraid
Will make you a woman tonight!
