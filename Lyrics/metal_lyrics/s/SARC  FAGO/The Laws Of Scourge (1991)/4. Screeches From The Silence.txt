The sunshine of dawn will born
Rain falls at the end of the night
Wetting your face, your soul
Speed is your way of life

Soon you'll meet your face
Reflected on the wet asphalt
The red of your blood, your blood!!!!
The lights end everywhere
You feel your soul burning in pain
Now you see the face of death
Calling you for a silent kiss

[Chorus:]
Something strange being inside of me
Am I awakening to a new life?
I can't stand this agony
Somebody please hear my screeches
From the silence

Slowly discovering you're alone
Fighting to escape from reality
Bleeding, your body starts to rot
Awakening in a curse of agony

Comething strange compressing you mind
(Your) pain, slowly turns into despair
A despair of a spirit leaving his corpse
Be welcome to your fate!!!

[Chorus]
