In front of my eyes, blinded by tears
I feel that time is passing by
Under lights that hurt my body
Hurt my soul and end my life

Covered by flowers, violet and red
I see those lips that once were mine
I've only some moments before I
Leave you forever
I couldn't say goodbye

Suddenly all is over
Sickness of evil took you from me
I can't stand facing this life
Without your lewdness, I must die

Drop by drop, now I see the blood
Running away from my veins
Now my body starts to rot
I'm fading away

A silent scream echoes my mind
Think that I'm really going
Through the mist I can see your shadow
Offering me your hands

No more time, no more fear
Now everything is so clear
No more anguish, I'm no more alone
The last drop falls, everything's gone
