Vices, madness, passion, hate
Thirst for power and being
Diversion through oppression
Starts an intense reaction

Trying to say something
You can burn yourself
This game has no rules
No mercy, no compassion

There's only school to enter
And only a language to learn
Nobody can escape
From the laws of scourge

Hunted by all the curses
Our destiny is to join this war
Awaiting our friend, Mrs. death
To stitch their last uniform

Fight for what you believe to be right
You just wish and you get (it)
You'll see my friend
We'll gonna win in the end!

You must learn these laws
Or you better kill yourself!!!

Learn how to use your enemies
To manipulate the dolls
To discover who your friends are
And learn how to kill of the false
