A lot of times we find ourselves in trouble,
that we think is impossible to be crossed.
The world seems to conspirate against us,
parents and friends close their eyes to us.

When you think that everything is over,
when you stop to believe in life,
when nothing more makes sense to your existence,
when you start to think that you deserve to die.

Remember my friend
the worst is to come

Remember your friend dead... he is dead!
Remember the brother black winds, he is
in problem with drugs.
Your pretty girlfriend... a car crushed her legs.
All your past of illusions, sweet lies.

Stop to think those bad things,
put out the bullets of your gun,
return that knife to the drawer of your mother.
Don't be coward... be a man!!!
Nobody cares if you go now.
Only you are important,
suicide is no solution for nothing.
your suffering after this act,
will be real and painfull...

When you think that everything is over,
when you stop to believe in life,
when nothing more makes sense to your existence,
when you start to think that you deserve to die!

Nobody cares if you go now,
Only you are important,
suicide is no solution for nothing,
your suffering after this act.
Will be real and painfull!!!
