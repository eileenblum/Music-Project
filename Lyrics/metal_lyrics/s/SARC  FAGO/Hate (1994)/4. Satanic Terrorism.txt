A legion of different hearts
an army of equal minds
same blood in their veins
burning high, pumping hard
brothers in uncomformity
Warriors of same land
Against the conveived reality
fighting until the end
Satanic terrorism
another church burn in flames
Satanic terrorism
Victims screaming in bloody
They are cries in the night
Satisfying their thirst for bloody
Making themselves the law
destroying another church
no one will be like them
wind blowing shows their power
they are an iconoclastic army
marked with the eternal fire
satanic terrorism
another church burn in flames
satanic terrorism
they are men of darkness
