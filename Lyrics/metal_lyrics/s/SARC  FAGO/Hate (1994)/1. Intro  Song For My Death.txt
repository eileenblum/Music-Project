My friend dressed in black
always watching me from some distance
devoted fellow, enemy of the flowers
Mother of the ones who suffer
So many fears, so many loves you
I know that your face is fair
Nothing more will exist
Everything will continue the same

Money, power and blue sky
means nothing when people die
democracy, symphathy, you and I
means nothing when people die
darkness, storms, calm and joys
souls screaming in agony
children playing in innocence
where we came from
we are innocent victims
natural losers
hungries in a banquet
corpses without soul
Repeat chorus
why we fear fate?
why we fear deliverance?
hell is on men's earth
Heaven is on dead's earth
