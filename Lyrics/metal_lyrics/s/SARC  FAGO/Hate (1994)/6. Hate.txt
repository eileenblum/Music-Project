I hate you, I hate me
I hate priests, I hate nuns
I hate my enemies, I hate my friends
I hate religion, I Hate gods

I hate, hate, hate, hate
I hate children, I hate women
I hate men, I Hate dogs
I hate the past
I hate the present
I Hate the future
I hate cars

I hate money, I hate lust
I hate drinks, I hate drugs
I Hate addicteds, I hate lesbians
I hate gays
I hate to hate
