There was a time
when all countries were only one
for divine reasons, scientific laws
the human have different colours
yellow, white, read and black
these are the colours of fashion
the one who created us had cursed us
with the gift of life and death

war after war
we have learned nothing
hate is still alive

In the battle camps
In the wooden shack
In the streets of the cities
orgy of flies
Under your nose
orgy of flies
Over a billion corpses
Orgy of flies

War, hate, anguish and pain
these men, poor humans
So satisfied with others torment
we want the end of this world
never will give change to peace
the flies will forever continue
in their orgy over the corpses
Hate is still alive
