So many centuries before
a stigmatized child was born
legends and fables are told
the truth nobody knows
A humble child
with (a) weak mind
goodness in his heart
Does goodness exist?
revolution through peace
love among worms
impossible ideals
Does peace exist?

Two thousand years have past
nothing that was told was learned
the phantom continues
Nailed at the same hill
Jesus never will come back
His soul cries in agony
(does) the agony exist?
(does) the phantom exist?
A being like that. The perfect man?
A lot of ideals. No answers for nothing
He preached the impossible
showed us the darkness
why we are so sad?
Does sadness exist?

Are you happy? Are you happy?
Poor insane
You got no conscience
about the cancer that devours your soul
see yours friend, see your parents
all infected with the virus of life
don't worry about them
don't worry about you
the cure is near
just take a look to the lead of your gun
