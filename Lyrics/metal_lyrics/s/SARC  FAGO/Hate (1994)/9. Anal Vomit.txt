One more time
we meet ourselves here
I got something to say
you got so much to listen
there's almost ten years
some things had changed
but a lot stays the same
we got the same hate

[?]

why should we conceal
or feign that everything is fine
money can hide but it's not the cure for disease

that causes pain to everyone
(life) cruel heritage
eternal delight
game of the wise

you need to scream with me
putting out all your uprising
free yourselves from conformity
expel your anal vomit
