Day of your death arrive's
inquest are open to you
lies don't be heard
your only sentence is death

Miracles and words don't save you
you never will be the higher
the hour of your death is now
your life don't extend so forever

Christ's death

Satan in hell
a wait for you
you are welcome
to your nightmare

You cry for your father
but he don't remember you...
