Wishing I were dead 
I'd leave the all behind and let it end 
Another day blackened my hate 
Another night could seal my fate 
It's so hard but I try to leave 
To the sky my hearts I give 
My God come down and save this soul 
Trapped in fear and the unknown 
The darkness surrounds me embedded in death 
Raking my last breath 
I've been the enemy 
I am my enemy 
My life descending slowly 
I reach out as I am drowning 
In emptiness I am dying
