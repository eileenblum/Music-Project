In the dark of night 
In my dreams I go to hide 
All I've known of this life 
Is all the pain I have inside 
Helpless agents the reality 
You're crated for me 
I have no choice 
This is all I'll ever be I'll ever be 
A child without a real home , afraid to be alone 
This sickness that you spread like cancer 
Kills any home I have , Longing for a change 
Just like you I became the man I hated to be, The man I'll always be 
The man I hated I'll always be, Fatherless in my heart it seems 
All I've known of this life is all the pain I have inside
