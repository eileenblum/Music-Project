One by one they all fall down 
Torn apart without a sound 
I'm not your hero 
I fall to pieces 
I crumble 
There's only one way out and it's not through me 
Rise above the inner war 
And live like never before 
I'm not your savior inside I'm wounded 
I'm wounded 
And I don't compare 
And I don't have the answers 
But I care
