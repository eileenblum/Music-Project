Death...It's on the tip of my tongue
Lies...Venomous in my words
Death...It's on the tip on my tongue
Lies...Waiting to hurt 
All the pain you can stand I can give you 
If words could kill a man, I'd bury you 
Hate...Has taken over my heart and its
Lies...Spilling unto my soul and I cry
Trying not to hurt you but I do it anyway
