A galaxy of nothing 
Space taken by a name, a life unseen 
Forgiveness unimportance 
Until true love obtained 
Until true love obtained 
This is what exists without you 
There's no hate, There's no love 
There's only nothing, Without you I cannot feel 
I heard only silence, I'm numb with emptiness 
This is my existence, A face without a name, A life unseen 
Forgiveness obtained, There's only nothing without you 
You're all there is in my eyes, Without you I'm blinded 
I'm numb with emptiness, This is my existence
