The Way They look at you is wrong 
They way they don't understand 
It's not right to judge you now but 
You'll get used to this somehow 
Disconnect the leash 
It wont be long until you play the game 
And decide if you belong on your own 
You're not like them 
Your mind is opened
Not all they ask of you
Is what you know to be truth?
To see beyond what they expect
To live without any regrets
Did I force this onto you? 
Is this a curse or a gift? 
To see beyond what they expect
To live without any regrets
