All I see is tragedy
Reality and agony
There's got to be some good left in the world
Hidden away from all this darkness
Leaving death behind
My soul and open wound
See it bleeding through
I'd cry if I could
But I'm immune to emotion
The end injected into desolate hearts
Corrupted bodies not afraid of the dark
Forgotten children of a sickening world
Bleeding from sickening wounds
There's got to be some good left in the world 
Hidden away from all this torture
Leaving death behind
