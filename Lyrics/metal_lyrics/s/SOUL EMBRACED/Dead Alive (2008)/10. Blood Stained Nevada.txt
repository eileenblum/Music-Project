I want you to die, pedophile.
The anger deepens.
Satan in the flesh, your day is coming.
White-knuckle death grip.
I'd crush you with a grin.
Fed to the pigs with nothing left.
Not even the bones.
In a crimson pool you'll lay.
The sickening display.
Her life forever scarred by a bloodstained Nevada.
Because of you, her childhood taken away.
What was once so beautiful, so full of life.
Because of you, she will never be the same.
Her innocence torn away.
She will never be the same.
In a crimson pool you'll lay.
The sickening display.
Her life forever scarred by a bloodstained Nevada.
