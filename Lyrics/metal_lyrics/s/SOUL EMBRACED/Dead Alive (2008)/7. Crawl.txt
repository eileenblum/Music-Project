Crawling out of eternal damnation.
It's time to change your life around.
No more weeping, dry your eyes.
You've come so far.
Time to test your faith.
Look into its face, all that's been misplaced.
All the suffering erased.
Death awaits.
Could you ever find a way to let me in to help you?
Chase the monsters all away, or anything that haunts you.
Will you ever find a way, will you close your eyes with me?
Will there ever be a time you will let me inside?
Standing up in your master's glory.
It's time to prove yourself.
No more weeping, dry your eyes.
You've come so far.
Time to test your faith.
Before it's too late, crawl back into grace.
Look into its face.
Death awaits.
Could you ever find a way to let me in to help you?
Chase the monsters all away, or anything that haunts you.
Will you ever find a way, will you close your eyes with me?
Will there ever be a time you will let me inside?
