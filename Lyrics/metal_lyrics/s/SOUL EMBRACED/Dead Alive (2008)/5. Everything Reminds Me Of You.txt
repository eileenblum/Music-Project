As I awaken from this nightmare, I realize that it is all true.
My life is so incomplete without you here beside me.
How can I go on existing anymore?
Why did you leave me here so all alone with this pain that imprisons my soul?
And now you're gone and all that's left is your picture on a shelf.
Everywhere I turn, when I close my eyes.
Everything in my life reminds me of you.
Everywhere I turn, when I close my eyes.
Everything reminds me of you.
My heart is vacant, so empty and so cold.
Took you for granted, thought you'd always be here for me.
The loving memory entombed in glass, began to shatter each day after you passed.
Why did you leave me here so all alone with this pain that imprisons my soul?
And now you're gone and all that's left is your picture on a shelf.
Everywhere I turn, when I close my eyes.
Everything in my life reminds me of you.
Everywhere I turn, when I close my eyes.
Everything reminds me of you.
