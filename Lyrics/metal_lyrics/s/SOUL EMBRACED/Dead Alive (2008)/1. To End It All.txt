This is it.
I'm at the end of my rope.
My soul, so cold, it seems I'm already dead.
My hate for life around my throat.
This is my chance to say I'm sorry.
Decomposing while I'm breathing.
Is my heart beating?
Will this be the day I decide to end it all?
No more.
I can't go on.
The vultures now circling.
Will this be the day I end it all, end it all?
My hate for life around my neck.
I want to live but I've forgotten how.
My God, is it too late?
This is my chance to say I love you.
At the end of my rope.
Decomposing while I'm breathing.
Is my heart beating?
Will this be the day I decide to end it all?
No more.
I can't go on.
The vultures now circling.
Will this be the day I end it all, end it all?
