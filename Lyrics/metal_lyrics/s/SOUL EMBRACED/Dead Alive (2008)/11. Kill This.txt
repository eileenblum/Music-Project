Trapped within myself.
Unrelenting pain.
A tug of war between the soul and mind.
At times I feel insane.
I don't want to be who I was.
But I'm feeling what I am is lost.
No one here to save me now, my will crumbles into dust.
No one here to save me now, my will crumbles into dust.
The flesh desire, my soul on fire.
Succumbing to my weakness.
I feel the flames burning higher.
Dear God, help me to kill this.
I don't want to be who I was.
But I'm feeling what I am is lost.
No one here to save me now, my will crumbles into dust.
I, the betrayer, locked away in prayer.
Only you can save me now.
Dear God, help me kill this.
