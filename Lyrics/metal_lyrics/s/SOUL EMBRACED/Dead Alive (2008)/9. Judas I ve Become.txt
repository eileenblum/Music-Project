I can't overcome this infectious feeling of death.
It's drained me of what I once was, can't seem to escape.
Can't seem to find my way, can't seem to find my way.
Is this the end of my story?
Have I slipped too far away?
I'm infected by this plague that decays my soul.
An incurable cancer.
Suffering is all I know.
My heart stained with sin.
In your eyes, Judas I've become.
I've realized my mistakes one day too late.
Is this the end of my story?
Have I slipped too far away?
I'm infected by this plague that decays my soul.
In your eyes, Judas I've become.
I've realized my mistakes one day too late.
In the end, forever dead.
Is this the end of my story?
Have I slipped too far away?
In your eyes, Judas I've become.
In the end, forever dead.
