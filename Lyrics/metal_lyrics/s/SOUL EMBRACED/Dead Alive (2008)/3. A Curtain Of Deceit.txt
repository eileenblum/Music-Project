It seems the distance between us grows farther everyday.
By my own actions, without realizing.
Have I done too much for you to find me again?
Have I done too much for you to find me again?
Everything I've got you've given me, with nothing in return.
Now I've turned my back.
Now I've denied you.
Locked away from the truth and in denial.
I sink deeper in this pit behind a curtain of deceit.
The pain that I feel, unexplainable.
My spirit wounded.
All alone I find...
everything I've got you've given me, with nothing in return.
Now I've turned my back.
Now I've denied you.
