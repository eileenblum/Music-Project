All this hate that I've carried.
The hurt that I've felt, that I buried inside.
Tonight it ends and I'll close my eyes on all this that's haunting my mind.
Tonight it ends and I'll wash away all this pain.
And when I sleep I'll dream of you the way it should have been.
This sadness collapses into darkness and I'll hold you within.
I won't say goodbye, only stand beside you.
Promised to see you on the other side.
I could drown in the tears that I've cried over the past.
So many years devoured by fear, wishing every day were my last.
All of my sorrow erased.
And when I sleep I'll dream of you the way it should have been.
This sadness collapses into darkness and I'll hold you within.
I won't say goodbye, only stand beside you.
Promised to see you on the other side.
