I won't be broken again.
My punishment for nothing.
Beaten down, trampled upon.
And I won't be broken.
Without weakness, without regret, my mind is set.
I've reached the breaking point.
It's time I do the breaking.
Like glass, you'll be shattered.
A thousand pieces fall.
And I'll still be standing.
You've tried to destroy me.
To kill the life from within.
But never again, my mind is set.
But never again, there's no turning back.
It's time I do the breaking.
Like glass, you'll be shattered.
A thousand pieces fall.
And I'll still be standing.
My punishment for nothing.
Beaten down and trampled upon.
But never again, my mind is set.
It's time I do the breaking.
Like glass, you'll be shattered.
A thousand pieces fall.
And I'll still be standing.
