Withering, diminishing, becoming what I loathe.
Monstrous and hideous, breaking every mirror.
I can't look at myself anymore.
I can't look at myself anymore.
I can't save what's left of me, my vow broken in every way.
Everyday I become less like me.
Chained to a world I despise.
Death in disguise.
My innocence corroded.
No truth, only lies.
I can't look at myself anymore.
I can't look at myself anymore.
I can't save what's left of me, my vow broken in every way.
Everyday I become less like me.
