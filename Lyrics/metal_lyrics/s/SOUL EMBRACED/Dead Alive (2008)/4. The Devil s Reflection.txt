My honesty, My cruelty, I am my worst enemy.
The darkness within me, a disgusting view to see.
Turn away, it's too much to stand.
There's no disguising what I am.
It's too much to stand.
Its pleasure is pain and suffering, taking over what is unseen.
It's not my image in the mirror.
What dwells inside becomes clearer.
I pray my God, forgive this.
In his kingdom I'll remain.
I pray my Lord will cleanse this and wash away my shame.
Its pleasure is pain and suffering, taking over what is unseen.
It's not my image in the mirror.
What dwells inside becomes clearer.
