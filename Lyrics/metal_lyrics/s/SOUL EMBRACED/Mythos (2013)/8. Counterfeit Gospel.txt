As your life draws close to an end
You kneel before your hollow savior
There will be no peace as you take your last breath
You lay with the beast

Cry to your god one more time
Before you close your eyes
And slip into oblivion
Cry to your god one more time
Before you close your eyes
To die and die again

Who you follow has never conquered death
And canât save you now
What could have been
A distant memory
The torture will never cease
The lie you followed
Canât save you now

Cry to your god one more time
Before you close your eyes
And slip into oblivion
Cry to your god one more time
Before you close your eyes
To die and die again

Damned forever to the abyss
Incinerated in the eternal furnace
You brought this on yourself as you chose
To follow this cheap imitation

Damned forever to the abyss
Incinerated in the eternal furnace
You brought this on yourself as you chose
To follow this cheap imitation

Damned forever to the abyss
Incinerated in the eternal furnace
You brought this on yourself as you chose
To follow this cheap imitation
