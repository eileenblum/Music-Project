Secrecy, systematic deception
Domination of humanity
Forging a new world order
From thrones of skull and bones

Screams of human sacrifice
Echo through the grove
Rituals for the beast
The festival of summer fire

Cremation of care
Erasing conscience
Burnt in the altar for appolyon

Cremation of care
Erasing conscience
Burnt in the altar for appolyon

We will not be controlled
We will fight to the end
Our souls are not for sale
In Jesus name amen
Amen

Blasphemy, Subterfuge
Conspiracy for demonic rise
Halos and crosses are their alibis
Fear takes over as America dies
Murder the savior with politics
Serpent tongues are evident
Lies are breeding conformity
Destroying humanity

Cremation of care
Erasing conscience
Burnt in the altar for appolyon

Cremation of care
Erasing conscience
Burnt in the altar for appolyon

We will not be controlled
We will fight to the end
Our souls are not for sale
In Jesus name amen
Amen
