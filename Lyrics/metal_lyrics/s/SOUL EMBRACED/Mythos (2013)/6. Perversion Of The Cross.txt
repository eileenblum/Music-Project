Youâre respected and loved
by so many in your circle
Using your authority
You manipulate your prey
Into your twisted game
Time after time
You commit unspeakable crimes
Time after time

Their lives torn apart
By your sickening actions
Reduced to nothing
Encased in shame
Their lives torn apart
By your sickening actions
Reduced to nothing
Encased in shame

The innocence of youth
Crushed by the betrayal
Of who was thought to be
The most trusted
Perversion of the cross
Youâve destroyed the most vulnerable
Of the flock

Perversion of the cross
Perversion of the cross
Perversion of the cross
Perversion of the cross
