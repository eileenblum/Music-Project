Justice crushed under tyranny
You tread on me
A serpent strikes in a golden field
The banner of our revulsion

They live while we sleep
The awakening has arrived
War against the system
For them to sustain
We must die
THEY LIVE
WE SLEEP
CONTROL
OBEY

Imminent collapse of all freedom
Future generations aborted
A shattered constitution
The revelation revealed

All encompassing hatred
Fueling this fire
All encompassing hatred
Fueling this fire

The power grab
Against our will
Builds the empire
Your time is nigh
We end the lie
Your death is our
VICTORY

They live while we sleep
The awakening has arrived
War against the system
For them to sustain
We must die
THEY LIVE
WE SLEEP
CONTROL
OBEY

"Our impulses are being redirected.
We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
They are safe as long as they are not discovered.
That is their primary method of survival.
Keep us asleep, keep us selfish, keep us sedated.
We are their cattle. We are being bred for slavery.
The revolution...we cannot break their signal,
our transmitter is not powerful enough.
The signal must be shut off at the source."
