The way they found you
Made this dark angel weep
He knew you had so much more life to live
Reduced to bones
In a trash bag memorial
With a duct tape silencer
Sealed with a heart

Death every day of life
But why this child
Weâre searching only to find
Demons walking among us
Destroying what we love
Just to kill is never enough

Gathering whatâs left of you
Is a heartbroken reaper
Putting you back together
Drives his pain deeper
But in his heart he knows
Youâll be in heaven tonight
With God above forever in his loving light

Death every day of life
But why this child
Weâre searching only to find
Demons walking among us
Destroying what we love
Just to kill is never enough

Death every day of life
But why this child
Weâre searching only to find
Demons walking among us
Destroying what we love
Just to kill is never enough
