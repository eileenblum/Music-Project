I shudder in my skin
Reality turning to madness, TO MADNESS
Unthinkable horror you canât unsay
Please take it all away

God help us
Weâre lost
God help us
Weâre lost

It eats away at my soul
A little at a time
All the hope in the world decomposing
Like a corpse
It eats away at my soul
A little at a time
All the hope in the world decomposing
Like a corpse

Burning children
Televised decapitations
The more we see
The more weâre unmoved
Sickening visions enraptured in disgust
Please take it all away

God help us
Weâre lost
God help us
Weâre lost

The more we canât feel
The more we lose our humanity
The more we canât feel
The more we lose our humanity

The more we canât feel
The more we lose our humanity
The more we canât feel
The more we lose our humanity
