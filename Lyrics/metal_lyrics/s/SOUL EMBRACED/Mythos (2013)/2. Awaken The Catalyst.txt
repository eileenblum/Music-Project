We are the catalyst for your undoing
Creating all the pain ensuing
Unleashing our plague
The hunter becoming the prey

Your cruelty and ruining
Will come to an end
Youâre the killers of innocence
With a twisted crucifix

Swing the judgment hammer down
Swing it down
Crush bone beneath your wings
Swing the judgment hammer down
Swing it down
Crush bone beneath your wings

Your flags of hatred swinging
Like ropes on southern trees
Youâre dead men walking
Awaiting light youâll never see

I deny your 666
Your vile and bestial mark
Your alliance of the west
The evil empire

Swing the judgment hammer down
Swing it down
Crush bone beneath your wings
Swing the judgment hammer down
Swing it down
Crush bone beneath your wings

The devil lives among us
Hiding in plain sight
Megiddo sirens calling
For the dead to rise

Swing the judgment hammer down
Swing it down
Crush bone beneath your wings
