Robes filled with dead mens bones
Invoke the god of this age
Usurping should of the world
Unleashing the demons of goetia
What have you done
Condemned by your own hands
You canât escape the wrath
You brought on yourself

Your jealousy of God
The quest to be immortal
your soul in satanâs grasp
This breath will be your last
Your jealousy of God
The quest to be immortal
your soul in satanâs grasp
This breath will be your last

The sons of perdition
Blasphemous and unclean
Youâre white washed tombs
Caskets of heresy
Youâve denied your creator
Controlled apostasy
Legions destroy us all
Behind a godless cross

Your jealousy of God
The quest to be immortal
your soul in satanâs grasp
This breath will be your last
Your jealousy of God
The quest to be immortal
your soul in satanâs grasp
This breath will be your last

Your jealousy of God
The quest to be immortal
your soul in satanâs grasp
This breath will be your last
Your jealousy of God
The quest to be immortal
your soul in satanâs grasp
This breath will be your last
