[Verse]
What I thought would kill the pain
Only brought more.
I lay dying, my wrist pouring crimson regret and betrayal
I'm dying, praying, bleeding and screaming
Am I too lost to be saved? Am I too lost?

[Chorus]
My God, my tourniquet
Return to me, salvation
My God, my tourniquet
Return to me, salvation.
My wounds cry for the grave
My soul cries for deliverance
Will I be denied?
Christ, tourniquet, my suicide.
