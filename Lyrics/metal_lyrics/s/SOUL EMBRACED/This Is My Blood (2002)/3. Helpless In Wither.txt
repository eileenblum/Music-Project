You are helpless as I was
Did you die inside or slowly wither
Don't cry your soul to sleep
there is hope above
The murder you dream of
The vultures that feed
The savior you dream above
The God that bleeds
I have solace in the light
Blessed unemptiness
the fire calls but there is another
Unravenous and weening
