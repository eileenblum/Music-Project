There's nothing behind your eyes
The windows to the soul
What's beneath your skin
A dead heart still beating
The cold stare of dead eyes
A look into demise
Within decay you rest
In pain and emptiness
Do you wish for more inside than this
Broken life
Do you hate what's within me and what 
I feel for you
