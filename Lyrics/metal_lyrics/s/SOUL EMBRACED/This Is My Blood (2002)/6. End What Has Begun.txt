Uncontious awaken
Bleed away the pain
All that was is erased
My soul reclaim
Forever hold eternal what's
Left of me
This life my disease and dwells
Internally empower
Embrace me in the son
I am weak
End what has begun
Strengthen me
Your will be done
I wish to end what has begun
I'm alone and die inside
Be the light that takes the shadow
From my soul
All tears will wash away with the
Demise of fear
Kill sorrow, kill misery, kill sickness
Within me
