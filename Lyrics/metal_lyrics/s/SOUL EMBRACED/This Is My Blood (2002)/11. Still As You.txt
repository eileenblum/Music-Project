You the sons of darkness 
He saved all the world 
Mercy for you now 
Mercy for you now 
Don't regret you life 
And have it judged by God 
You're forgetting... 

And don't you ever 
Lose no more time 
This time it's still as 
You, no more time 
This time it's stil as you 
There's mercy for you 

I look to you 
And soon I'll follow 
To where the son awaits 
In the promised land 
Move into the light 
And die within thee 
Mercy for you now 
Mercy for you now 

The word will be on his life 
There will be salvation 
The word will be on his life 
There will be salvation.
