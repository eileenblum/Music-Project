You can take my life but you can't
Kill what I have inside
What I have is forever
I hurt I bleed I die
I weep I hate I love
I breathe I need I fall
It's timeless
It's always been
It creates and destroys
The thrones of self condemned
Past wounds heal but the scars remain
I leave behind the tortured parts of me
Baptized in fire
