I cry, I dwell in darkness 
my confort is nothing 
repulsive reality 
how I pray to escape But I 

Fade Away and disarm my faith 

My trials murder my hope 
to hold on is to inject pain 
my heart is cold 
how I pray to escape but I 

Fade Away and disarm my faith 

am I designed to suffer 
a damage creation 
the torment existence 

I Fade away
