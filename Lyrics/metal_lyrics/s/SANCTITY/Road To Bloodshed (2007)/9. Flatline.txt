Morning sun for the last time, warming upon my face
Chills my blood and weary bones
My soul sheds no tears, passing in wonder
Will I ever find my way

I hear you weep beside me
Black shrouded veil wonï¿½t hide your eyes

I know my lifeï¿½s over
Come ride the flatline

So afraid of lies beyond
Will I just turn to dust
Or instead will I be back again
To wander in this realm broken

I hear you weep beside me
Black shrouded veil wonï¿½t hide your eyes

I know my lifeï¿½s over
Come ride the flatline
Thereï¿½s no life left behind my eyes

Another unfamiliar ceiling
There is no return
To anything Iï¿½ve know before
My journeyï¿½s just begun

I know my lifeï¿½s over
Come ride the flatline
Come ride the flatline
Thereï¿½s no life left behind my eyes
