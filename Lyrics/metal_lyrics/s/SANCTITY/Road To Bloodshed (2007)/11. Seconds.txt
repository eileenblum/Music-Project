Your life is ending seconds at a time
You pay no mind to whatï¿½s behind
What did you think would happen now
This angry moment

Cry, cry, cry
Your life is ending seconds at a time
Canï¿½t wait to see what seconds will define

And now youï¿½re stuck, you stupid FUCK!
Donï¿½t even try to find escape
This constant grieving

Die, die, die
Your life is ending seconds at a time
Canï¿½t wait to see what seconds will define
Your life is ending

Great blinding pain
Coursing through my veins
Iï¿½m broken down inside

Your battered cage, you need to vent frustration
Your numbered days, your life is your destruction
Iï¿½m destroying all youï¿½ve got
Weï¿½ll take you down like it or not

Your life is ending seconds at a time
Canï¿½t wait to see what seconds will define
