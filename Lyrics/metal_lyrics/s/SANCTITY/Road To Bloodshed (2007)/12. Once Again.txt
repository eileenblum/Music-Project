Mankindï¿½s past has shown our origins in death
Born from the ash of life; Born from nothing left

Incinerator / Decimator
The end has come once again
How could I fail to see
The truth of it all bleeding into me

Look at the world around you
Burn out the one inside

Incinerator / Decimator
The end has come once again
How could I fail to see
The truth of it all bleeding into me

What will make the next step?
Where will you hide?
Why would you resist?
When will you die?

The end has come once again
How could I fail to see
The truth of It all bleeding into me
Bleeding into me
