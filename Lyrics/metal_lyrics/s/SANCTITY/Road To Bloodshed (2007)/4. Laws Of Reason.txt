Within the screaming system a burning fever hides
Temperature rises in a sea of bodies in the depths the pressure boils
Uncontrollable chaos, madness in the mob
Look at the faces around you, collective conscience for all

Wait for the time to open the gates
Break with fury what it may create

Witness the decay of order
Where is your system now

Then the noise begins to shake the very ground
Chaos in every direction, every face a blur of sound
Wild eyes of the mob unified in sight
Joined by the energy of insanity

Wait for the time to open the gates
Break with fury what it may create

Witness the decay of order
Where is your system now
Hereï¿½s to the fall of the laws of reason
Let the madness out

Ripping pain of freedom
Boundaries overthrown

Witness the decay of order
Where is your system now
Hereï¿½s to the fall of the laws of reason
Let your system down

Witness the decay of order
Where is your system now
Hereï¿½s to the fall of the laws of reason
Let the madness out
