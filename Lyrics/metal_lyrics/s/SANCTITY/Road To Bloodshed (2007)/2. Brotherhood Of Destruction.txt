Screaming with confidence
Lips built to bleed
The war it starts with them
With haunted eyes they feed

Pain on your face, pushing your way through
Picking up the fallen, knowing that itï¿½s you
Tortured eyes in a dreamless mind, I look away
A different kind of blood flows through our veins forever

Canï¿½t help but feel the power
Of something deep inside
Bloody and beaten down
There is no need to hide

Tortured eyes in a dreamless mind, I look away
A different kind of blood flows through our veins forever

Show me your pain, show me your fear
Gather your strength and keep it near

Pain on your face, pushing your way through
Picking up the fallen, knowing that itï¿½s you
Tortured eyes in a dreamless mind, I look away
A different kind of blood flows through our veins forever

Show me your pain, show me your fear
Gather your strength, keep it nearï¿½
