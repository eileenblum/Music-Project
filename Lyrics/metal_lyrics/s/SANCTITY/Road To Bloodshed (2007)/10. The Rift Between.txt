Who could have known when I opened my eyes I would see
The dark angel of my destiny
This must be some kind of dream, not itï¿½s a nightmare
Filled with guilt and shame
All those years a waste of time
Never caring
Who you left behind
I broke your faith in aï¿½

Brothers bond
I see you there forever gone
What can I say, what can I do
The rift between us stands

I should have known when I opened my eyes I would be
The martyr of our destiny
This must be some kind of dream, not itï¿½s a nightmare
Filled with hate and pain

Brotherï¿½s bond
I see you there forever gone
What can I say, what can I do
The rift between us stands

Weï¿½ve lost our way
Stop holding on

Brotherï¿½s bond
I see you there forever gone
What can I say, what can I do
The rift between us stands
It stands
