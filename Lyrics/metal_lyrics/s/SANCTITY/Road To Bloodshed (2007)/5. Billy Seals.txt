Iï¿½ve lost with all the best intentions
Iï¿½ve conquered through with lies
The air is burning cold, so cold

Iï¿½ve come full circle, Iï¿½ve come full circle
From pain to pain
Now one to show me the way

This time I will not fail
Wonï¿½t be left behind again
My life a dismal tale
No way to guess what lies at the end

Itï¿½s so hard to scream when you canï¿½t breathe

Iï¿½ve come full circle, Iï¿½ve come full circle
From pain to pain
Now one to show me the way

This time I will not fail
Wonï¿½t be left behind again
My life a dismal tale
No way to guess what lies at the end

This time I will not fail
Wonï¿½t be left behind again
My life a dismal tale
No way to guess what lies at the endï¿½
