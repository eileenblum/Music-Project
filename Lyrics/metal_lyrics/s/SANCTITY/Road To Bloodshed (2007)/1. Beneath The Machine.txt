Start the needle up again as I crawl to the chair
Anticipate the pain
Feel the charge in the air, sick fascination
Canï¿½t wash away this alteration

Beneath the machine
Constant noise inside my head
Trading blood for ink, into torture I will sink
Beneath the machine again

Sometimes a picture to make heads turn
Sometimes a badge of honor earned
Always a reminder of pain endured
Never a way to say these words

Beneath the machine
Constant noise inside my head
Trading blood for ink, into torture I will sink
Beneath the machine again

Just remember
Itï¿½s all for time
By skin be judged, with my skin define

Beneath the machine
Constant noise inside my head
Trading blood for ink, into torture I will sink
Beneath the machine again
