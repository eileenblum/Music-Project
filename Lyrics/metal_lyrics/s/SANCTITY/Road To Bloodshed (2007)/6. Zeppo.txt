Lingering in darkness, wading through my fears
My hands still bound together
Why canï¿½t we just exist, in a world so pretentious
Bleak horizons bleed disdain
For a mind so determined to reach the sky
On the wings of a dream

Why wonï¿½t you fade away
Into nothing
Why wonï¿½t you fade away
Into nothing

In this day and age of zeppoï¿½s and of slaves
You have been here forever
Anger and impatience always seem to burn
Your vapid sense of life, it breeds you deep into your fear

Why wonï¿½t you fade away
Into nothing
Why wonï¿½t you fade away
Into nothing

Now we stand before you baring all our souls
From within this living darkness
Have you no idea what it takes
To create what we are living
Every moment wrought with despair and elation
We will never be easily stopped!

Why wonï¿½t you fade away
Into nothing
Why wonï¿½t you fade away
Into nothing

Lingering in darkness, wading through my fears
My hands still bound together
Why canï¿½t we just exist, in a world so pretentious
Bleak horizons bleed disdain
For a mind so determined to reach the sky
On the wings of a dream
