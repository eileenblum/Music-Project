Blindness from your own hand
Fall from the edge, join souls with lives untold

Clear your mind of guilt, Pass it down the line
Tithe away your fear, beg for a sign

Lost in shadows, lost in fate
Dim as the road to bloodshed
Scattered ashes, none remains
Blessed or the damned

Bow to nothing, fall to your knees again
Distant redemption, our way of life is death and sin

Lost in shadows, lost in fate
Dim as the road to bloodshed
Scattered ashes, none remains
Blessed or the damned

Find your way to nowhere, lose your face in darkness
And live your life in despair

Clear your mind of guilt, pass it down the line
Tithe away your fear, beg for a sign

Lost in shadows, lost in fate
Dim as the road to bloodshed
Scattered ashes, none remains
Blessed or the damned
