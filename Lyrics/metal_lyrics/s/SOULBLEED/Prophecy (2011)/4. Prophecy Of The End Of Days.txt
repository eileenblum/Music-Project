days of great deception days of great lies
when the fool is set to lead when the wise is scilenced
seven years of madness seven years of relief
is
when
the unmerciful seed
breds

the method of the wise is abandoned
when the young disrecpects the old
when the roots deny thier own identity
the
disiple
surpasses
the master

generations of lust
gerenations full of lies

programed ignorance
mass hypnosed arrogance

generations of lust
gerenations full of lies

raised as sheeps
raised to be guided
