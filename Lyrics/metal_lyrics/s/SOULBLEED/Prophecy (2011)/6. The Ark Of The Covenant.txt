the wisdom of God
offered for sinners and fools
from heaven to bloody earth
crossing the seven skies
under the doom of the spirits it shall lay

why would u create a race
a race that would fill earth with blood
though we praise you lord
yet his almighty know what you dont know

condemned to live an illusionary life
your fate is to fight
its overwhelming lies

for what is after
that lasts
for what is after
that counts

never look back for your sins
for those evil shall never reciece any good

nor the high mountanis
nor the deep seas
nor the fearest beasts
none accepted the knowledge
yet the rushing fool human did .

you will never see the light
you will never be allowed to
unchain your mind
unchain your heart
for your dreams
on the shores of reality shall be destroyed

live in your human denaial
wear your mask
when every other mask has just fallen

an Unworthy
discuised in a human suit
yet u'll never fit in
u'll always remain allienated

fool the eye
fool the ear
fool all your mortal senses
you'll never be abll to fool my soul

shall prevail your hidden truth
all living con is one by one
be one with yourself
feel the pain of being alive
breath the eternal essence of lie
you are just another victim of pride
a moment of lust feel its pleasurable pai
