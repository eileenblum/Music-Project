glorifying Antichrist with blocked mind
unmerciful seed
Bearing secrets from a cold malevolent race
The devout remained but the pagan faded out
deep philosophical Pyramid and
The signature of an open eye
are now clear

For lying passive in the face whilst the enemy reigns
The stench of perfume lied like the semen Barth
sins of the decadent, was born in pain
There will be between the dead and dying

the Prophecies and glory so near

His last attempt to grasp at God
Madness clouded everything
Polluting the honesty of Christ with poisoned words
Go to dream beyond the pale is set to murder peace
Jerusalem and Mecca are last Haven
