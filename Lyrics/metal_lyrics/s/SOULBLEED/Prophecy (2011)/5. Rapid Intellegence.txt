cirlce of endless ignorance
closed circle of ignorants
reflecting your own misery
on others own experience
Judging every one else
based on raped intelligence
you are un worthy ,
ruined your own divinty

[CHORUS ON THE MELODY :]
for your ignorance i shall have zero Tolerance
you will never rape my own intellegence

face the fearst reality
guide the missleaded soul
into the mud pond
your own misery sail
oceans of bull shit
you have been filled with
you are un worthy
like cells of a disease

[chorus on the melody part:]
for your ignorance i have zero tolrenace
for your arrogance i have zero tolerance
will never rape my intelegence
will never rape my intelegence
