WHO AM I
To point a finger
At anyone with other beliefs?

WHO ARE WE
To judge a stranger?
Society has taught us to fear.

Well think again motherfucker!

I stand up against
Anyone who lacks respect for those who differ in thoughts.
I force myself not
to give in to follow those,
who walk the common path.

There is no difference between black or white.
Colors will fade by the end of the night.
The skin is only a package wrap.
But we're too scared to open up our eyes.

OPEN OUR FUCKING EYES!

Acceptance is an easy promise,
But we never see a result.
There is more than black or white,
But we're too scared to open up our eyes.

Open your fucking eyes!

It doesn't matter if your pierced or tattooed.
What an other one hates is what you will like.
It's the love for the art that provides
The motivation to live your own life.

We thank the people who helped build our dreams.
We support them by giving them what they need.
Free music and true friendship
The motivation to live your own fucking life.

HUMANITY!
Let us believe in equality.
EQUALITY !

I stand up against ideals
Forged in closed minds.

Breathe it in and out.
Cleanse your awareness.

The more we accept,
The more we can grow to ourselves.

Born to bow to one another.
They taught us to despise.

Behind a curtain of smoke
Lies your true self within.
