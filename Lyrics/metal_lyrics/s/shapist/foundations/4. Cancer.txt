An abstract living dream
Of a cardboard cut-out meaning
Vivid highs and vibrant lies
of a slowly tearing seam

We are the plague, these are bleeding souls
We need a change, I find that there's a hole inside us all
(Hole inside us all)

Hearts made of wood
You pile into your fire
Burn down your white washed walls
So you appreciate the roof that falls

We are the plague
These are bleeding souls
We need a change
We are bleeding

We are the plague, these are bleeding souls
We need a change, I find that there's a hole inside us all

Terminal viruses
Fluctuating through
An Immaculate portrait of perfection
Mutations progress inside a world in distress
You can't escape the deception
A catastrophic progression
This is the end of an era
This is the start of a new

Hearts made of wood
You pile into your fire
As you dance around
Dizzy you fall asleep
Kaleidoscope eyes
Stare through stained glass windows
Burn them alive, just to see the embers tremble

Starlight is only bright
When the sky is clear
When the sky is clear
We fill our lungs (we fill our lungs)
We fill our lungs with the smog
And hold our breath, until we disappear
