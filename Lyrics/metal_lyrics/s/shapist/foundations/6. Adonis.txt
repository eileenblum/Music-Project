Can you feel the memories drifting into dreams?

Tethered to the thought of discovering a cure
For genocidic consciousness
A drive to become more
Can you feel the memories drifting into dreams?
Across the golden moments are,
Seamless realities

Dire times call for drastic minds,
My grasping hands try to grab at angels stripped of flight
The woods set ablaze by fireflies
I left my fate in their embrace
As they grew into flights of stairs, their sparkling dance
Stole the air from my lungs
A game of change

Lost in Limbo with no shapes to take
Rebirthed by this deconstruction
Where we lie and wait
Falling from the night sky
Like decomposing stars
This temporary sight of things
Haunting shores
Searching for the light

We are the Ghosts of night
Constantly struggling to rebuild ourselves
We are the Ghosts of night
We are the wisps of souls that go dance in the air

Reformation birthed in dying
Wherein the soul that dwells
Is the strength to be one again

With his feathered touch
And by his grace
He grants you eternal life
And by his hand
Reborn are we
Awakened from our sleep
And when we rise
Decrepit and stripped of our wings
We will take to the skies

Lost in Limbo with no shapes to take
Rebirthed by this deconstruction
Where we lie and wait
Falling from the night sky
Like decomposing stars
This temporary sight of things
Haunting shores
Searching for the light
