[feat. Garrison Lee]We're all aspiring to be
So much greater than ghosts
Lately it's been out of reach
My wings have turned to stone
Do not remember me for what I was
Remember me for who I became and forget my flaws

Some live their lives hungry, searching for meaning
Others waste away, underneath the fucking ceiling
Gasping for air, underneath a sea
Of self loathing and misery

I claw my ears to silence all of this ignorance
Trapped in a blindside, of a society
If I could go back in time, I'd change it all
I'd change it all

Oh no,
Nobody knows
We're constantly falling and failing to find
A reason for being alive

Hidden in our souls
Are crystal keys to expansion
And we're dying to feel the light on our skin
In our hands
We've lost ourselves

Have we forgotten just who we are?
Have we forgotten the things that you wanted to say?

Do not remember me for who I was
Remember me for who I became and forget my flaws

This is who we are
The ones you thought you could understand, but you can't and now we
Are moving on
Into the light
A place with consolidation of thought and mind

I'll pray for you, for the sake of progression
But don't mistake this for divine intervention
Everything is just taken for granted
I recognize we're born into false positions

Oh no,
Nobody knows
We're constantly falling and failing to find
A reason for being alive
