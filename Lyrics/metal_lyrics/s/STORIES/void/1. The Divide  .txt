Hear me.
Take a breath of the air we are forced to filter.
Feel the stream we poison, intoxicating the blood of the body that gave birth to existence.
We're nothing more than her.
We are no more vital than this earth, just another layer in a multi-verse.
We are the black hole inside her, the only cause for the chaos we fear.
What have we become? we are killing her.
She taught us how to walk, and now we spit in her face. Don't tell me everything is fine.
Will I ever dislocate myself from this mindless machine.
I can't explain the vexation.Â 
Every time I try and pull myself out from the dark, I have found myself lost in a devolving society.
A generation.
I am a gear in the engine.
Powered.
Destroying.
I am darkness.
