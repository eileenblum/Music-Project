We have been dreading our return to the void for too long.
Restrained from the future as we all cower from the end of human life.
The cyclic structure of existence avoided at all cost.
I made the choice to accept that I will die.
I live with no barricades to hide behind, removing myself from our race.
Too afraid.
Entangling oneself in a deluded force.
We are reprogrammed into the system that kills us.
There is no such thing as dissolution in death when returning to the mystery from which we came.
We're returning to the mystery from where we came.
A road to complete the perfect cycle.
Redefine your lust for life.
Look inside the void and you will find.
Redefine your lust for life.
Realign your mind and realise we only have one chance to create before we complete, to the void.
