Beneath the endless drone that deafens my ears,Â 
I can hear the echoes of a dream I had and it's reminding me.
We are hollow. Calling me to wake up.
A beacon of clairvoyance is forever, completely out of reach.
I've been searching for the barrier separating man and beyond.
A stone sealed door divides the weak from design, and it never opens.
We are neglecting what we should enshrine.
Near the burning lantern light to your feet with light leaking through the cracks of this room.
Realise we can't see everything.
A beacon of clairvoyance is forever, completely out of reach.
Our perception has grown weary of the apparent world absorbing a torrent of focus...
In longing for myself to wake up.
