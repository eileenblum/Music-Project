A flux of energy inside every mind.
We sleep with open eyes, embrace the power of our consciousness.
It resonates within the very core of our being.
Knowledge like echoes, lost to the control of others.
The architecture remains stable, suspended in space and time.
Structures built upon the enforced ignorance of man.
Minds extracted unknowingly.
The implementation of new-age distraction has been putting us all to sleep.
How can you call this living when the links have been fractured and the bonds have been broken?
We are destroying the one thing we have left.
We are all infinite.
Why limit yourself to the expectation of others, for we are all infinite.
No Gods, no Kings, only Man will live to provide any answers.
Wake up.
