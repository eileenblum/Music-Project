I don't know what you've become.
Can you even see your reflection when you look in the water?
I'll blow your face off, there will be nothing left.
I will see the truth you've disguised.
You see this life we live suffers a bitter end.
Why bother lying to yourself?
How can you live without questioning this world?
We can not live forever, we are only human.
So throw away the lies you believe, and destroy the mask you hide behind.
We all die with everything to lose.
Now you must make the choice between freedom or entombment of your mind.
You are tracking the steps of a crowd.
Stop following orders, think for yourself now.
How can you live without questioning this world?
We can not live forever, we are only human.
So throw away the lies you believe, and destroy the mask you hide behind.
Take hold of reality. Plant the seed.
Uniqueness could fall and corruption could grow.
If you keep on swallowing all the lies you have been fed,Â 
You will surely become a slave to your own ignorance.
I'm so sick of this place, the congregation of these faces.
Please take me away where I am free of this mess.
