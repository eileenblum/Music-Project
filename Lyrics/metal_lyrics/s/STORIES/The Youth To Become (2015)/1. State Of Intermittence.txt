How did we get here?
How did we come so far?
We're all divided and trapped inside our thoughts
We've been conditioned by feedback one by one
Transmissions fading without end

If we build this life from nothing more
Than what we were told before

All I ask
Are you still listening?

We draw the lines
And we're breathing the same air
But now we're running out of time
