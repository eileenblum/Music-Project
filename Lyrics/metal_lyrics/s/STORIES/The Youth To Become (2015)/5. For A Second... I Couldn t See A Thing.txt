This room is making me nauseous
I can't hear myself think
My trembling hands keep me from falling
My visions heading straight through this tunnel again
And I can see the way out

Pick me up
Pull me out
I've trapped myself
Under Everything I built to last
I'm kicked down

I'm just someone
With a problem
But no one's listening
They've all been telling me
"It's all in your head"
Again and again and again

Sorry for speaking up
This is a conversation
Not a reading of my rights

So listen
I fear I'm not the only one to blame
Oh god this is it for our culture
And our generation

I lost sight of the future
I'm oscillating back and fourth
So dig me up from this hole we're in
Because I've done it again
I've had this dream where I'm stepping back
I have this dream where I'm looking for my eyes
Because I can't see the way out

Man in the light
Under the pressure
Might need to lie down
Feeling depression
Man in the light
Might need to lie down
He might need to lie for
He's under the pressure

This it it
Life is letting go of
Of what the world told you
You must detach yourself from who you are
To start again
