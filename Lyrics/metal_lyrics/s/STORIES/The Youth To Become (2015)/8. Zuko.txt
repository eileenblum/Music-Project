I know you tried to lay it out
But your bloodlines been a blur
And you're passing through it all

Looks like you've found yourself
Down the road you came from
So carry on with the same abandonment
Just like your father
Another generation apart

We move just like flames
Conditioned by our motion
But this won't be the end
It must be so hard when
They played with your heart but
Just let me show there can be a way out

We're so toxic in the way we talk
How nothing means nothing to us
This is who we are
This is who we are
So try not to hold so tightly
To the hands that keep pulling you deeper
Let me show you
Let me show you the way up

Are you breathing fine underwater?
I've been waiting at the surface for you
To regain control
Cause I can't find it in myself to let go

Why would I tie myself
To the one thing I can't fix
Pulling me down tot the floor
Down to the bottom
Don't act like you're trying your best
Don't act like you've tried before

We are all just a picture
Composed by memory
Painted by what we've felt
So what's the point in opening our wounds?

Looks like you've found yourself
Down the road you came from
Don't carry on with the same abandonment
Just like your mother
Another generation apart
