Dead static air
Sedating every breath
And nothing makes sense
With white noise blaring in my ear
Broken lights have us running blind
In the dark we are burning out
Unexposed and confined
To the world that led us on
As long as there's time left
We are all lost together

We're defined by what we despise
I'm looking for a break in the wall
That we're putting up
To tear a whole in the life that we're breathin' for
Am I the only one who's thinking?
Tear a whole in the life that we're bleedin' for
Am I the only one scared of how this ends?

We're all born into the ocean
With the same thirst
Nothing but salt to dry our insides out

Dive with me to find out
Just how deep this all goes
And why we need it all
I'll try my best to understand
As long as there's time left we are all lost

I can't stand to watch them crawl
Slaves to the world that they call home
I can't stand to watch them crawl
Slaves to the world that they call home
