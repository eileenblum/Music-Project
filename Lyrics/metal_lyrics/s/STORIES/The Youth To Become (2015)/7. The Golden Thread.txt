We were gods in the form of children
Incite the one that resides
Deep in the heart cave
Beneath our skin
I know we're walking onward
Just how well did we cover our tracks?

Grip to what you can
We're falling faster than I can believe
I fear there's nothing to break our fall
Slowing down time to be on the same page

Living in the artists eye
Cut off our tongues and we'll be alright
The words we speak are often meaningless
I'm holding on to the lines
That the ink has marked
From my heart to the world
A reminder that I'm still alive
It was the purest reflection
I am unbound from this world

Carve it deep in the bone;
"I exist for this release alone"
With no reason not to devise
How could you give it away?
Your sentiment for a life lone lie?

Self doubt can not justify your means
To escape a new reality
We hold the keys to unlocking
The doors we're seeking
The revolution
