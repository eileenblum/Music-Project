Speakin' up for the whole world to hear me
Now I'm not so quiet any more
Oh looks like I've come undone
And all I need
All I need is some where to begin
I'm trying to write down my thoughts
They've been kept so quiet and cold
But It gets so hard to remember
Well that's my problem
I've been losing track
Almost everything I've said
What's left to keep me centred?

Oh world take me back
I'm sure I've double crossed my words
I'm repeating the same steps that I took
I keep givin' up
But I can't remember why
I keep giving up
But I can't remember why

Nothing seems to last
Like we wanted
It's all I wanted
Nothing seems to last
All I know is I tried
I tried to bring you life

Do you ever feel like you've forgotten
All that you promised
All that you promised yourself?
Do you ever feel
Like you've betrayed who you are?
And was it worth your heart?

Even though I tried to fix myself
We live to shed our skin clean
Only to leave it out for the world

I keep giving up
But I can't remember why

I hope when I'm gone they'll forget what I said
I hope when I'm gone they remember me
I hope when I'm gone they'll forget what I said
I hope when I'm gone they remember
