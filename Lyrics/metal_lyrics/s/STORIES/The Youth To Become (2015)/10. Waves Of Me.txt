If feels like forever
With my heart upon my sleeve
I'm writing down how it feels
Cause I can't seem to feel a thing
Not through this empathetic reflex
It only hurts the way you hurt when you suffer
The only crack in the world I've had built for me
I'm grateful For
I'm thankful for it all

This is where my body meets its end
I'm crawling with the depressed
I'm crawling through the smoke
Let me carry your hurt
Oh let me carry you
The light that consumes me
Is bright enough to complete me
What's the point?
What's the point?
In letting people fall?
I was given all I need to last
Last a life down here of smoke and fog

Down here we pay for it
But I'll give it to you for free
Down here we pay for it
But I'll give it to you so freely
Oh our connection comes at a price
Down here we pay for empathy

Don't go pulling at the snakes skin
It won't work out that way anyway
Don't go pulling at the snakes skin
It won't work out that way
Cause we're all dying at
The same pace that we should

What's the point in trying to change the cycle?
We're all dying at the same pace that we should
What's the point in trying to change the program?
We're all dying
