Stranded here
I've been counting every day
Waking up I'm waking up
Just to fall asleep again
Oh distant world this is not the life I chose
I'm the only one up here
I'm the only one who knows

Everyone from here looks so automatic
We're all set in motion
You couldn't be more alone tonight
But I still envy your isolation

We're so calloused
We're so calloused
I'm still looking for answers alone
I'm beyond ready to go

There's a hole in this plot
And I'm asking questions about what I'm worth
How to forget what I've been given
And who I am

I've been losing ground for a while now
They said it'd be alright
But I'm seeing things
And I can't sleep at night
Oh and I feel so run down
And running out of
Run down and running out of time

They need to pack it up
And shut it off for good
So flick the switch
To turn the whole thing off

Bled out and left to die here
But I won't let them
Repeat the same lies

I'm afraid to die in the same place
If I could I'd leave you with nothing
But these words
"Time is delicate hold it
Hold it closely"
Don't let them take away your life
Your life from our hands

I know it feels like we're all set in motion
But we cannot can never let it go for anything
