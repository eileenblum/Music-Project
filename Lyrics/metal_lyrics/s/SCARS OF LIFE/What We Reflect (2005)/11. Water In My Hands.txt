My mind spins in circles
Have I done wrong?
It's been since forever that I felt this strong
You turn your head to avoid me
You don't even know me
So far from something to you

You kick me down âcause you need it
So dead inside I can feel it
You're so much better; you've made me understand
You kick me down âcause you need it
So dead inside I can feel it
You're slipping through me like water in my hands

And the anger consumes me
I start to rise
Would be so much better if I'd only try
And you're so quick to judge me
You don't even know me
My stomach turns just to know you

You keep me down âcause you need it
So dead inside I can feel it
You're so much better; you've made me understand
You kick me down âcause you need it
So dead inside I can feel it
You're slipping through me like water in my hands

I know you feel it
What do you want?
False hopes
I have nothing
Strength within
It begins to boil
Can you step out and
Show yourself

Slip...

You kick me down âcause you need it
So dead inside I can feel it
You're so much better; you've made me understand
You kick me down âcause you need it
So dead inside I can feel it
You're slipping through me like water in my hands
