I used to think that you were the best thing for me
I must be blind
Because I feel so helpless and hopeless
We close ourselves out from the world outside

Everything is going to roast between us
the world around us and I won't mind
And this part of you is dead within me
I won't want you I'm alone inside

(Reside!)

I used to think the views we shared were common
I know you lied
The part of me that lives within you
Kill me quickly let the pain subside

Everything is going to roast between us
The world around us and I won't mind
And this part of you is dead within me
I won't want you
(I'm alone inside)

Everything is going to roast between us
The world around us and I won't mind
And this part of you is dead within me
I won't want you
(I'm alone inside)

Face down
No place to hide
Feel my eyes burn
(Because I'm alone inside)

(Yeah)
(âCause I'm alone inside)
(Yeah)
(Yeah)
