My thoughts
I hold back the truth that's unspoken
It keeps, pulling me down
As the seasons change within me,
I'm coming around

It's all these things I say to you
But I feel nothing
It's all these things I said I'd do
But I do nothing
There only empty words

Your head
Is filled with so much shit that's unwanted
It's surely, wasting away
Your first step on a path that's a dead end
I can't understand

I take, from you, a life you only wish you knew
The feelings inside you rage as you dream of the
escape, this someone that you call yourself

Now, these chains are not made of you
Now, there's no one to hold on to
Now, the hope has been drained from you
