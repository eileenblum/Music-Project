I look back to a time
When all of this was washed away from me
Reflect on what once was
Now it's torn apart, its all blurry

Goodbye to yesterday
Inside I slowly break
I'll leave it all behind
As you begin to fade

As you fade away from me
I can no longer see
As you fade away, from me

All that I thought of you
Was nothing more then a mask for me to view
Now that you've shown your face
I see the truth, your just a disgrace

These wounds will never heal
You wanted it this way
I'll leave it all behind
As you begin to fade

As you fade away from me
I can no longer see
As you fade away, from me
As you fade away from me
Leave behind what used to be
As you fade away, from me
