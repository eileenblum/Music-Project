I remember a time when I thought you were the only thing Iâll ever need
The feelings have shattered, you no longer matter
Drown in the wake of your sanity

Now the colors torn
Torn away from me

All the pain in my life you bring
Is killing me
These feelings are numbing
Your presence is smothering
You treated me... like so many nothings

The last words we spoke remind me why Iâll never see your face again
Iâll break from the past
Iâll rise from the ash and watch this life come to an end

Now the colors torn
Torn away from me

All the pain in my life you bring
Is killing me
These feelings are numbing
Your presence is smothering
You treated me... like so many nothings
