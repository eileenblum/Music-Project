A flash flood of emotions hit me
The sound of a shatter I derail finally
This is a moment of self-clarity
The clock ticks faster, the past is blurring
The way I was is quickly fading
My heart doesnât matter youâve taken it freely

The will I haveâs about to break

But my time with you is limited
I feel you fading
Youâre everything my life should have
Iâm overflowing

Now youâre gone and my world is broken
The absence of you a sadness flows through
Fall asleep with your scent still on me
These thoughts of you I cannot break free
I just want to see you again
The waiting kills me, I hold it all in

The will I haveâs about to break

But my time with you is limited
I feel you fading
Youâre everything my life should have
Iâm overflowing

I think youâre far too gone to feel
But that is just my opinion
Is everything we have for real
Or will it all fall to pieces
