Remembering our fractured past like broken glass
It's never ending
I only want to dissolve what was, restores my cause
To fill what's empty
These walls of burden need to go away
This heart can't tear them down

I don't need to
Forever fake a smile
Now our moments past
And all that lasts, I watch it burn

Now you're tearing me apart
Destroy what I knew
All the life unravels from me
A thread held by you

The poison air was thickening and killing me
But I breathe deeply
I stayed with you for far too long but now you're gone
So I can be me
The sting of memories has broken me
They just won't wish away

I don't need to
Forever fake a smile
Now our moments past
And all that lasts, I watch it burn

Now you're tearing me apart
Destroy what I knew
All the life unravels from me
A thread held by you

Dissolve what was
Restores my cause
I need a way
To bring the life back into me

Held by you [3x]
