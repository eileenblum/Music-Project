A pillow lays beside me
No scent of you in the air
I only hear the dust thatâs falling
And no sign of you is showing

Well this is finally over now
Break away from missing you
I need to move through this somehow
No more salt will fill the wounds

Itâs over!

This is the moment after
When you have already gone
This cage is breaks within me
My soul is gone, thereâs nothing to free

Well this is finally over now
Break away from missing you
I need to move through this somehow
No more salt will fill the wounds
Itâs just another day thatâs another waste
My heart will turn to stone

Not again..

This weight upon my chest has lifted when you walked right out on me
