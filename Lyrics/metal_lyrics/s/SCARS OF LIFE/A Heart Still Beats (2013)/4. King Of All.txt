Obscurity to irrelevance
Iâm nothing to you, broken once again
Nothing stems from nothing there
A wall that holds you immune to all I am

A life, that holds, no love
Just a shell of misery
Set me free

All I am I owe to you
This life you stole from me
Iâm just the king of all that lie in ruins can you see

I want to heal these scars I bare
Iâm always trying to see you once again
Forever etched inside of me you walked out of this world so easily

A life, that holds, no love
Just a shell of misery
Set me free

All I am I owe to you
This life you stole from me
Iâm just the king of all that lie in ruins can you see

Walk away from you like I always do, turn away
Iâm the king of all
Just a king of all
Iâm the king of all
Just a king of all
