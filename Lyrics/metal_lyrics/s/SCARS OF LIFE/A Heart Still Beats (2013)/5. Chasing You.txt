This life is like an empty canvas
For you to draw upon
I only want to feel something but now the time is gone
Iâve set a fire in me
Now my backs against a wall

Follow me down
My feelings die after all
Inside Iâm screaming
What had meaning
Now has none

Now youâre so far away
But youâre still close to me
Iâve done what you wanted
Chasing you down the rabbit hole
Can I fix this broken day?

These clouds above my head are crumbling
In a world where I belong
I feel like Iâm suffocating
And the ash it burns my lungs
Is this all Iâll have
Now my backs against a wall

These clouds above my head are crumbling
In a world where I belong

Belong!

Now youâre so far away
But youâre still close to me
Iâve done what you wanted
Chasing you down the rabbit hole
Can I fix this broken day?
Now my worlds been set to flames
