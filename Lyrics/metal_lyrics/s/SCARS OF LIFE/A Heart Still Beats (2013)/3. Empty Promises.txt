This life alone I've held in blindly
A broken part of me
I know all that you wish to see
These things I know I'll never be
I look above my head as the sky burns

And could truer words be spoken
How I failed you
And with every promise broken
Is all I've given you
The life I found is falling down around me... but I still needed you

I only cared for none but myself
A frozen heart again
Nothing but fear resides in me
I only know what I can think
I look to you and watch as the world burns

And could truer words be spoken
How I failed you
And with every promise broken
Is all I've given you
The life I found is falling down around me... but I still needed you
When this is over with, the ties that bind
They will be severed

Nothing but fear resides in me
I only know what I can think
I look to you and watch as the world burns

And could truer words be spoken
How I failed you
And with every promise broken
Is all I've given you
The life I found is falling down around me... but I still needed you

The life I found is falling down around me... I still needed you
