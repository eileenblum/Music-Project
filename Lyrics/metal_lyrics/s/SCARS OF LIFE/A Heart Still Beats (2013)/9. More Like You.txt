Iâm unlike you

How can I change the image looking back when I stare in the mirror
A man before me stands there bathed in self-doubt hatred and fear
But I pound the glass as I keep looking back at a soul thatâs empty and gray

I push away but you keep coming back into me
I am unlike you
What I am is insufficient by your standards
So Iâll be more like you

Iâve kept a lot of the things Iâve wanted to say bottled up through the years
Iâm floating through a river of hope, drowning in an ocean of tears
Remove the cap as thereâs no holding back
Release how I feel inside

I push away but you keep coming back into me
I am unlike you
What I am is insufficient by your standards
So Iâll be more like you

So Iâll be more like you
Iâll keep away from me

How can I mend this
Make you forget this
Grow into a skin youâve made for me
Although I donât mind, Iâm not your kind
Turn my back as you once did to me
