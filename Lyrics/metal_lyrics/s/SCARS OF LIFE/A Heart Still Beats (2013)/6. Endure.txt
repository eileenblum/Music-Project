Reach deep, reach deep in me
Pull out all I have kept in
I just never could see all I could unleash
Let go, let go of me
These walls around me I break them
I'm no longer weak
These feelings start to cease

This fear is slowly fading
Dissipating broken and no more
I thought this was unending
Not forgetting all these things I've endured

All this, all this is real
I just don't know where to begin
The weight of my world, lifts finally
Hold on, hold on to me
These tears of suffering will shatter
I'm no longer weak
These feelings start to cease

This fear is slowly fading
Dissipating broken and no more
I thought this was unending
Not forgetting all these things I've endured

I'm falling away...
And I'm falling away
