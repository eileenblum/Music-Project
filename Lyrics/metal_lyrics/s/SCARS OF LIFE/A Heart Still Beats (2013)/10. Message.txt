Have you ever had to hide
From someone thatâs supposed to love you more than they can say

And you look at me with such distain
Am I real or am I fake
Or is something deep inside of me that you hate
Is there something deep inside of me that you hate

Lying here inside my room
Staring at stick on stars that hide the walls above
Iâm wondering what my life would be like anywhere but here
Like a puddle on an ordinary day

And you look at me with such distain
Am I real or am I fake
Or is something deep inside of me that you hate
Is there something deep inside of me that you hate

With a frozen heart and a broken smile
A shun from you could take me miles
Down an icy blackened river that rots your veins
Is there something deep inside of me that you hate
