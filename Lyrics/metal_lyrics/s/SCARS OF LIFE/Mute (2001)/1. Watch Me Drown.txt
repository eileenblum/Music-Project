Although my mind is open, my heart is tightly closed
with all the hate that holds me, I wish I didn't own
for all the years that pass by, I know I should have changed
how can one man sever, the links that make these chains

And then I see...what my life should be

Im here dying for another chance to make this right
with the guilt I feel I try to piece together my life

And I wish for more then I could
Ever give to you...
and I know that you dont need the
hell I put you though...

Im here with my hands open, confused on what to do
I wish that I could take back, the words I've said to you
And your eyes widen to tell me, how you should have seen
Your mouth spills out all the, words you didn't mean.

YOU STAND AND WATCH ME DROWN!!
