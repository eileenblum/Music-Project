I ask myself how can you walk with him
when you know Im here
How can I watch you move on with your life
just take me away...

My eyes are pryed open
to see the way this hell can make me break
my eyes are pryed open
I know your gone, Im here I'll stay, what for to be your slave
My god..

I ask myself if you took pity on me
and thats why your here
with all the scars you left upon my skin
just take them away

My eyes are pryed open.. NOW!
