You've thrown away all I've given to you
Its not much but its all I ever had
I wish that I could do more for you

And I swallow the pride that remains
I feel so shallow
when you look at me the same

All these years I swear I never knew
what it was that I ever did to you
Sorry that I look the way you feel.

I wish for it to hear you say
call me your son one of these days
I never asked that much from you
just return the love I gave to you
