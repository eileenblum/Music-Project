I think I've had enough
Of useless shameless point of views
I think we've had enough
I just can't take anymore of you

I will never be
What you wanted me to be

I am the one you lost
I am the one forgotten
I have myself
I have myself

I get through a new day
I'm not listening to a word you say
I don't like this
You're never complacent
I'm tired of you

I will never be
What you wanted me to be

I am the one you lost
I am the one forgotten
I have myself
I have myself

I am the one you lost
I am the one forgotten
I have myself
I have myself

I have myself
I have myself

Myself
I am the one you lost
Myself
I am the one you lost
Myself
I am the one you lost
Myself
