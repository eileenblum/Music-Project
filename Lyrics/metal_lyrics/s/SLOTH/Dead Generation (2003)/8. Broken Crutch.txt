A broken crutch you stand
Drinking from your heart
I wept behind these words
Falling in the dark

Buying from your pride
Dealing from your stones
Falling from your life
I've taken all you know
Screams will run away
Clinging to the fall
Yet another day
Wishing all was yours

Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus

Choking from the rain
Crying from the rot
Swimming in your sea
Tubes injecting salt

Screams will run away
Clinging to the fall
Yet another day
Wishing all was yours
Buying from your pride
Dealing from your stones
Falling from your life
I've taken all you know

Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus

The crowd will rise
The crowd will take your selfish heart
Pushing, breathing away

I want you my slave
Crawling on your hands
While licking the blood from my eyes
Oh my god only sees
Where we belong
Where we belong, holding back the silence
Hold me on narrow shoulders
Gave me everything
Gave me everything to lose
Find me the stake
Find me the way home

Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
