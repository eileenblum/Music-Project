We are a dead generation
No one's going to cry for you now
No one's going to cry for you now
They are going to sit back drinking martinis while you
rot

We are all dull and sedated
The real is gone our light is fading

We are
A dead
Gen-a
We are
A dead
Generation

No one's going to cry for you anymore
No one's going to cry for you anymore
Stop waiting for someone
Someone to come along and save you from yourself

We are a lost generation
When will we see?
They are going to sit back watching until there's no
one left to rot
We are a dead generation

We are
A dead
Gen-a
We are
A dead
Generation

No one's going to cry for you anymore
No one's going to cry for you anymore
Stop waiting for someone
Someone to come along and save you from yourself

We are a dead generation
We are a dead generation

No one's going to cry for you anymore
No one's going to cry for you anymore
No one's going to cry for you anymore
No one's going to cry for you anymore
