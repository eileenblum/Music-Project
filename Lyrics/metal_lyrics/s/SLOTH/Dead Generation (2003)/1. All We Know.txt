All we see is all we know
And all we know we see
Deep inside I thought you knew me
All we know we see

All the seeds we've planted bloom
Into our New Orleans
Lonely faces staring at me
All we know we see

Now I am the one who
Now I am the one who sees through you
Now I am the one who
Now I am the one who sees through you

All the steeples standing proud
In spite of darker days
Blues keep raining
Child's playing
All we know we see

Now I am the one who
Now I am the one who sees through you
Now I am the one who
I'm trying to find you
Standing beside you
I am the one who sees through you

All we see is all we know
And all we know we see

Now I am the one who
Now I am the one who sees through you
Now I am the one who
I'm trying to find you
Standing beside you
I am the one who sees through you
I am the one who
Who sees through you
