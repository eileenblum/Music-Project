If words are silenced
Overused
One more insult in my brain
Words are bullshit
And overused
I wish for difference
I wish for a change

You got what you wanted
So here's what you asked for

Nothing new

There's nothing new you fade away
But I will take you anyway
There's nothing new you fade away
Because you choose your hell
You choose your hell

Words are useless
So overuse
One more insult in my brain
So sick of bullshit
So what's the use?
I wish for difference
I wish for a change

You got what you wanted
So here's what you asked for

Nothing new

There's nothing new you fade away
But I will take you anyway
There's nothing new you fade away
Because you choose your hell
You choose your hell

We are fed too much to see straight
There's nothing new, well you fade away

There's nothing new you fade away
Because you choose
You choose
You choose
Your hell...
