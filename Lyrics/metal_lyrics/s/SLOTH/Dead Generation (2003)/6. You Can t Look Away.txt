I have never felt such loneliness
I cry and beat the bathroom floor
There is no one here that understands me anymore
I'm afraid of losing you

You can't look away
I'm already there
You can't look away
You can't look away
I am the one you put down
I am the one right here
You can't look away
I'm already
There...

There is no one here but loneliness
I'm afraid to be alone
Sometimes it feels like I'm clinging to an edge that
knows
I'm afraid to carry on
Carry on
Carry on

You can't look away
I'm already there
You can't look away
You can't look away
I am the one you put down
I am the one right here
You can't look away
I'm already
I'm already

You can't look away
I'm already there
You can't look away
I'm not there

You can't look away
I'm already there
You can't look away
You can't look away
I am the one you put down
I am the one right here
You can't look away
I'm already
I'm already
I'm already
There...
