Visions
In my head
Counting all
Stinking dead
Memories
I have left behind, behind
Dreary night
Barren land
Centrifuge
My desperate hands
My lonely hands

Leprosy
Takes it toll
Never mind
What is sold today
The marketplace has found its fool today
Wanted more
Paid for less
Still my thirst
Dies for this mess

I take away
Useful meaning more
Useful meaning more
Until there's nothing left

Visions
In my head
Counting all
Stinking dead
Today
The marketplace has found its fool today
Wanted more
Paid for less
Still my thirst
Dies for your mess

I take away
Useful meaning more
Useful meaning more
Until there's nothing left...

I will
Breathe again
On my own
On my own
Until there's nothing left
Until there's nothing left
Until there's no one left
Until there's nothing left
Until there's no one left
Until there's nothing left
Until there's no one left
Until there's nothing left
Until there's no one left
