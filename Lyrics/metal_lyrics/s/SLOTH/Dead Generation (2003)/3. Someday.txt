Maybe I gave to you
I'm the darker side of what you knew
Deep inside I am troubled
Deep inside I'm troubled too

I want
Want to believe in
Something worth believing

I just can't keep on pretending
I'm amused by what you're selling

Someday
I am wanting you
Someday
I will find you
I don't believe in nothing
I don't believe in nothing
Someday
Someday

Different times
Feel the same
No one means
Just what they say
Maybe I feel the same
I'm waiting for the next best train

I want
Want to believe in
Something worth believing

I just can't keep on pretending
I'm amused by what you're selling

Someday
I am wanting you
Someday
I will find you
I don't believe in nothing
I don't believe in nothing
Someday
Someday

Someday
Someday
Someday

Someday
I am wanting you
Someday
I will find you
I don't believe in nothing
I don't believe in nothing
I don't believe in nothing
I don't believe in nothing
I want to believe in something
I want to believe in something
I want to believe in something
Someday
