Can we make the billboards any bigger?
We will keep on buying
Make sure we push the sex
We keep on selling
Underage children
Having children
While we keep on blaming the media
Feeding the
Media
For excuses that we make
Media feeding the media
For excuses that we make

Television's your religion
Television's your religion
Television's your religion
Television's your religion

Throw your pacifiers away

It is all around us
It is all around us
It is all around us
Say it
It is all around us
It is all around us
It is all around us
Say it

Man will keep on building
While we keep regressing
There is no one caring
But the TV set
Poor little Johnny
Lost his mommy
To Al Bundy
While we keep on blaming the media
Feeding the media
For excuses that me make
Media feeding the media
For excuses that we make

Television's your religion
Television's your religion
Television's your religion
Television's your religion

Throw your pacifiers away

It is all around us
It is all around us
It is all around us
Say it
It is all around us
It is all around us
It is all around us
Say it
It is all around us
It is all around us
It is all around us
Say it
It is all around us
It is all around us
It is all around us
Say it

It's all around

Media feeding the media
Media feeding the media
Media feeding the media
Media feeding the media
Media feeding the media
Media feeding the media

It is all around us
It is all around us
It is all around us
Say it
It is all around us
It is all around us
It is all around us
Say it
It is all around us
It is all around us
It is all around us
Say it
It is all around us
It is all around us
