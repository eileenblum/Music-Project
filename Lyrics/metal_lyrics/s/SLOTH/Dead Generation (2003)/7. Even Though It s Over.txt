Everything I do
All I say
Falls apart when you won't stay
Even though
We both know
Nothing ever stays the same

I'm not like you wanted me
I can't forget all that
I'm not what you wanted
We go on, and on, and on, and on and on

I will follow you
Until you push me away
If we could just forget it
It would make it easier

Even though tomorrow won't change a thing
Even though tomorrow won't change a thing
Even though tomorrow won't change

Even though it's over
Even though it's over

Everything I do
All I say
Falls apart when you won't stay
Even though
We both know
Nothing ever stays the same

I'm not like you wanted me
I can't forget all that
I'm not what you wanted
We go on, and on, and on, and on and on

I will follow you
Until you push me away
If we could just forget it
It would make it easier

Even though tomorrow won't change a thing
Even though tomorrow won't change a thing
Even though tomorrow won't change

Even though it's over
Even though it's over
Even though it's over
Even though it's over
