Fight for purple, fight for white
All there is is Vikings pride
With pride and honour unto fame
Purple and white will always reign (yeah)

We all stand up, we cheer and shout
'Cause we are Vikings for crying out loud
It's us or them, so raise your voice
Get on your heels, and bring the noise

We are members of the Vikings family
We are viking, we are Vikings
We are members of the Vikings family
We are viking, we are Vikings

We're bound to win, we're meant for fame
There ain't no team that we won't tame
'Cause we don't care how tough they fall
It's our house we run the show

We are members of the Vikings family
We are viking, we are Vikings
We are members of the Vikings family
We are viking, we are Vikings
