[Music - Burtz, Eder / Lyrics - Burtz]

Hey!

Another night, the lights go down
Call of the wild to me
Let them hear the howling sound
Lose control, be free

Hell's breakin' loose beneath my feet
Trembles through the ground
I stalk my prey in the city heat...
Never to be found

[Chorus 1:]
Cause the nighttime... is the right time to explode
Now or never, live it up

[Chorus 2:]
Undercover animal, animal
Undercover animal, animal

Two souls I know inside of me
Man or beast can be
I'll lose my mind to another side...
Wild, untied and free

[Chorus 1 and 2]

Ah! Ah!
OW!

[Chorus 1 and 2]
[Chorus 2]

Ooh, it drives me wild!
Undercover - animal

RRRRR!
