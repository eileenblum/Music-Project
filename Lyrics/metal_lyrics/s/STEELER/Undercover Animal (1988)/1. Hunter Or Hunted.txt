[Music - Burtz, Eder, Pell / Lyrics - Burtz]

Back in the city jungle...
Is back where I belong
Mortality it haunts me (haunts me)
I'm all alone

Don't come within my gunslides...
Cause I'll end your game
It ain't so easy
Survival aim

[Chorus 1:]
Hunter or hunted - is the name of the game
Hunter or hunted - believe I'm back again

[Chorus 2:]
I'll be - hunter... or - hunted
I'll be - hunter... or - hunted

The bait's your body maybe
You better watch your step
One false move and... it will cost your neck

[Chorus 1 and 2]

[Chorus 3:]
Watch out (watch out, watch out) - hunted
Watch out (watch out, watch out) - hunted

[Chorus 3 and 2]

I'll be - hunter... - body shelter - or hunted [4]
I'll be - hunter... - body shelter...
