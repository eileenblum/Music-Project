[Music - Burtz, Eder, Hag, Pell, Mandy Meyer / Lyrics - Burtz]

Wild emotions... rulin' strong
Feel like I walk on a wire
Just one way left, can't be wrong
Come and waste me, set me on fire

A rush... when we touch
And I can't get enough
Take me down, rock me out
You feed me on

[Chorus:]
Knock me out
Knock, knock me out again
Knock me out
Knock, knock me out again

Vice for you it's paradise
Let's be partners in crime
Wildfires ragin' in your eyes
Eat me raw, don't waste... more time

A rush... when we touch
And I can't get enough
Rock me down, hungry for love
You feed me on

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Knock me out
Knock, knock me out again
Knock me out!
