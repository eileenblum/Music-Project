[Music - Burtz, Eder, Hag / Lyrics - Burtz]

Hot tonight, gotta strike
Let 'em feel my stick of dynamite
Sinful, narrow
For long talks before because lust rules

[Chorus 1:]
Tonight - gonna hit and run
I'd die - for a bit of fun
No woman that survived and crawled out alive from my chambers

Beware I'd bad - bad
Beware I'm bad... to the bone
You know I'm bad - bad
You know I'm bad - to the bone
Tonight

Hunt 'em down, one by one
They can't teach you move, kinda pass the gun
So strong
I belong... to the kind that never asks for right or wrong

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2:]
Beware I'd bad - bad
Beware I'm bad... to the bone
You know I'm bad - bad
You know I'm bad - to the bone

Don't worry, you're the next!

[Chorus 2 (2)]
