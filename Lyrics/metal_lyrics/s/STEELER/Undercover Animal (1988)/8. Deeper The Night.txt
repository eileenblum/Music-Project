[Music - Burtz, Eder / Lyrics - Burtz]

Another lonely night
An another lonely road
An endless way to go
Don't have to hide my feelings... lying awake on my own

The gypsy just no one could tie down
All of a sudden... there's a yearning for you
But the wheels keep on rolling
Through endless nights... and other towns

Oh how I wish it could end here
Oh how I'm longin' for your touch
Seems to be years I'm spendin'... alone

[Chorus:]
The deeper the night (deeper the night)
The deeper the night (deeper the night)
The more I'm searchin' for... a reason why
And the further I move... I realize
Something's dying... inside
Something's dying... inside

The screams for encores are reduced to zero
Compared to that voice on the telephone
The heat of a thousand spotlights
Nothing, it's nothing... to the warmth I've known... so well

Before reachin' out for glory
Before reachin' for the stars
Sometimes I wish I could go back... again

[Chorus]

The deeper the night (deeper the night)
The deeper the night (deeper the night)
The more I'm searchin' for... a reason why
And the further I move... I realize
Something's dying... inside

[Chorus]

Dying inside...
