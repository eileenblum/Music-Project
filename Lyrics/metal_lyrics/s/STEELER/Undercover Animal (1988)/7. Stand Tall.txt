[Music - Tommy Newton / Lyrics - Burtz]

I don't know the future
Have no guarantees
But I'm this kind of survivor
More up than down, more strong than weak

[Chorus 1:]
I'll - live it up
Nothing can make me fall
Try - to call the shots
Cause I want it all!

[Chorus 2:]
Ooh, hey
Stand tall
Ooh
Never gonna stop
Ooh, hey
Stand tall
Ooh
And I can't give it up

Know the wheels are turnin'
Does it matter anyway
But my flame keeps on burnin'
And that's the one thing that... will remain

[Chorus 1 and 2]

[Chorus 2]

Ooh, hey
Stand tall
Ooh
Never gonna stop
Ooh, hey
Stand tall
Ooh
No I can't, can't give it up

Ooh, hey
Stand tall
Ooh
Never gonna stop
Ooh, hey
Stand tall...
