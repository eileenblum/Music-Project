[Music - Burtz, Eder / Lyrics - Burtz]

From man to man, take what we can
A new generation
Stand up as one, time has come
New liberation

[Chorus 1:]
Come on... and make a stand
Nothing can match your desire
Oh you won't look back, it's a straight attack
Gettin' higher

[Chorus 2:]
Hard breaks
Hard breaks
No turnin' back
Hard breaks
For too long we have been... on the track

Finding our place, hit to the face
No complication, no
When the battle is won... life has begun... realization

[Chorus 1 and 2]
[Chorus 2]

[Children's choir:]
Rise up!
We've had enough
Build a new... generation

Ow! Ow!

[Chorus 2 (3)]
