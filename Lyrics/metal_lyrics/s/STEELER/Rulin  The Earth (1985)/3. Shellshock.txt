[Music - Eder, Krawczak, Burtz / Lyrics - Burtz]

Uniform, steel helmet, kit bag, machine-gun away
No more ammunition, no rifles or section today
Campaigns against those who are called enemy
Defenceless now lie in the sand
Cowardice, victory, plunder and smash... are shakin' each other's hand

[Chorus:]
Shellshock [3]
Can't forget what happened there in the east
The power of warfare... is still holding me

Captured and tortured them, victory was always gained
Those who supported them suddenly started to declaim
Criminals they called us, heroes no more
Assaulted by the own men
Enemy for the aggression and so
Invasion without any sense

[Chorus]

[Solo: Axel / Tom / Axel]

Campaigns against those who are called enemy
Defenceless now lie in the sand
Cowardice, victory, plunder and smash... are shakin' each other's hand

[Chorus]

Can't forget what happened there in the east
The power of warfare... is still holding...
Shock
Shellshock [2]
Can't forget what happened there in the east
The power of warfare... is still holding me

Can't forget what happened there in the east
The power of warfare... is still holding me

Can't forget what happened there in the east
The power of warfare... is still holding me

[Shouting:]
Stop!!!
