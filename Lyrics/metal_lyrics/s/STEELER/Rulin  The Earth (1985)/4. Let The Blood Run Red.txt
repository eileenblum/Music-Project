[Music - Eder, Pell, Yildiral, Krawczak, Burtz / Lyrics - Burtz]

Full moon above, I walk the street...
To find some whore to make her bleed
In this moon's light my destiny...
Will be to bite and slaughter thee

[Chorus 1:]
A trail of terror on my way
I bring you darkness and dismay

[Chorus 2:]
Let the blood run red
Let - let it run
Let the blood run red
Let 'em be dead [3]

I feel the urge within my jaws
Shining and sharpened are my claws
No hope for you to run or hide...
As I feel lust rise up inside

[Chorus 1]

Let the blood run red
Let - let it run
Let the blood run red
Let 'em be...

Here I come, see the fear... in her eyes
Now she's lost, I'm in love... at first bite

[Solo: Axel / Tom / Axel / Tom / Axel]

[Chorus 2]

Let the blood run red
Let - let it run
Let the blood run red
Let 'em be dead

[Chorus 2]

Let the blood run red
Let - let it run
Let the blood run red
Let 'em be dead [2]
Let 'em be...

Let the blood run red
Let - let it run
Let the blood run red
Let 'em be dead...

Let it run - red!
