[Music - Pell, Eder, Krawczak, Yildiral / Lyrics - Burtz]

[Fills: Tom]

I sleep all day, waiting for the night...
When I'm heading just for the action
My mates with me and the gear's all right
Hope to get... some satisfaction... here

From our cars music fast and loud
Reality is far away
We are here... and we are proud
No tomorrow, live for today

And I know, what I want is...

[Chorus:]
Oh oh, run with the pack... so far away from here
Oh oh, never look back, nothing we have to fear

[Fills: Tom]

Now it's time for the old 'in-out'
Find a bird... and start to shove
Make her scream... and make her shout
This is what... you want from love

And I know, what I want is...

[Chorus]

[Fills: Tom]

[Solo: Axel / Tom]

Oh oh, run with the pack... so far away from here
Oh oh, never, never, never look back, nothing we have to fear, have to fear, have to fear

Oh oh, run with the pack... so far away from here
Oh oh, never, never look back, nothing we have to fear, yeah
