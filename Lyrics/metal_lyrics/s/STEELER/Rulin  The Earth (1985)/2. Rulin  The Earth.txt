[Music - Pell, Eder, Burtz / Lyrics - Burtz]

Summon the people right here
Listen to the resolution of mine
Recognize, we have the right...
To get our might back and fight for today

[Chorus 1:]
They gave us the feelin'... that those who are rulin'...
Are leading the action, are taking away self-confidence
They negotiate, election campaigns, why do you stand still?
This is our world, when do you see?

[Chorus 2:]
We are ruling the earth
Have the right to
We are ruling the earth
Have to fight for

Why do you just talk about... 'them' and not 'us'
Are you too blind to see?
Those who are ruling the earth...
Are voted by yourself a tyrant to be

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

[Solo: Tom]

[Chorus 2 (2)]
