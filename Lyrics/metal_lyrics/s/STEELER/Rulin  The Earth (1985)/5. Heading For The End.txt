[Music - Eder / Lyrics - Burtz]

All my dreams have died and... are all crumbled into dust
I feel the end is in sight now, life seems to be no must
There is no more place to go... but the rapid will to show, to show
What I was worth for them in times... I lived, I wanna die

Winds are rushing through my mind, there's a sense I can't find
And I'm caught just by a pain, fought in vain
Isn't there someone who knows... how to find a senseful side, a senseful side?
All my will to live is gone... taken by an evil might

Now I've got... the dues to pay
No, no, I can't stand
Loss of mine is... on my way...
I'm heading... for the end

All my dreams have died and... are all crumbled into dust
I feel the end is in sight now and... life seems to be... no must
There is no more place to go... but the rapid will to show, just to show
What I was worth for them in times... I lived, wanna die, just die

Now I've got... the dues to pay
No, no, I can't stand
Loss of mine is... on my way...
And I'm heading... for the end

[Solo: Tom]
