[Music - Pell, Eder / Lyrics - Burtz]

Sitting here and watching tides go by... on the sandy shore
Seems to change but it always stays the same
Life is like a pit of snakes sometimes... and just a bore
You've seen it all guy, you know the game

Leaves I saw growing back in May are now... falling to the ground
Seems to change but it always stays the same
You lose your friends, as time goes by they die... without a sound
You've seen it all boy, you know the game

It's the same old circle...

[Chorus:]
Like turning wheels... life is turning, the days... fade away
Like burning flames... life is burning, it's yearning... for the final day

Tried suicide a thousand times... but in vain
You had no guts... but maybe there's... a reason why
You know that you will try again when it... all becomes too much
When you can't go on... living with that... lie

It's the same old circle...

Like turning wheels... keep on turning, the days... fade away
Like burning flames... life is burning, it's yearning... for the final day

[Solo: Axel / Tom]

[Chorus]

Turning wheels... life is turning, the days... fade away
Like burning flames... life is burning, it's yearning... for the final day

Turning wheels... keep on turning all over... away
Burning flames... they are burning like life, it's... yearning away
