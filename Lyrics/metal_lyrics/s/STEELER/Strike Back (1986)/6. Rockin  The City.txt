[Music - Burtz, Eder, Pell / Lyrics - Burtz]

You're a beast undercover, but treated like a fool
Don't give a damn for the others
Cause you've got your own rules

[Chorus 1:]
A bit of rock - rock
Makes you come out of your shell
A bit of rock - rock
Uuh, give 'em hell!

[Chorus 2:]
Rockin' the city
Rock so hot
Rockin' the city

You're chokin' back the anger
Waitin' for your time to come
And when the daylight is fading
Just like a starting gun

[Chorus 1 and 2]

Oh yeah

[Chorus 1 and 2]

Rockin' the city
It's the day of the city
Rockin' the city

Yeah

A bit of... rock
