[Music - Burtz, Eder, Pell / Lyrics - Burtz]

In the dead of the night when there's nothing inside
Can't see for miles around
Then it's time to move, nothing to lose
Take this town!

Thunder in disgiuse
Danger... in the air
Rock the night away... tonight

When the lights go down you can hear the sound
So scream out in the air
Gotta fight the fight, gotta do it right
Come show me... you are there

[Chorus 1:]
Thunder in disgiuse
And danger... in the air
Rock the night away... tonight, tonight

[Chorus 2:]
Night after night, day after day
Gotta let go, turn it up again
Night after night, day after day
On and on

Hey hey hey!

We can burn the ice, no more compromise
A flame you can't blow out
Such a roarin' force, a stampin' horse
Get it now!

Thunder in disgiuse
Danger... in the air
C'mon, rock the night away... tonight, tonight

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 2 (2)]

On and on
Oh yeah
Hey hey hey!

That's the thunder in disgiuse
And danger, there's danger... in the air
