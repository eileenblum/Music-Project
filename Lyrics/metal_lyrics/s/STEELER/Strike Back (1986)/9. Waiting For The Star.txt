[Music - Burtz, Eder, Pell / Lyrics - Burtz]

Silently... desperation destroying... my mind
Can't get it all... anymore, anymore
Alienation... is my only way, yeah
So cruel, so cruel

Reality, or should I believe in something other?
And I'm... catchin' a light... in the corner of my deceivin' eye
Soarin' away from the dark
It's just because... I can't give up

[Chorus:]
Waiting for a star
Hoping for another light
Waiting for a star
Takes me years... all away

Out in the dark
Out there so far see Venus appearin'
Makes me dance
Dance from a high rope
Burns like a pyro, she's got me there
Venus you're just to blame - oh, this is lunacy
Again and again it's the same

[Chorus]

Sly clever woman, you're my saving grace
But only planets can show... a lying face!
A face!

Waiting for a star
Oh, I'm waiting
Hoping for another light
Waiting for a star
Takes me years, takes me years

Waiting for a star
Hoping for another light
Waiting for a star
It takes me years away

Waiting for a star [6]
