[Music - Burtz, Eder, Pell / Lyrics - Burtz]

Anyway you slice it
I've got to get out of this place
No way out now, bash a steel face

When I kick down the doors - all night long
You're takin' part just in a play
Break it up in my own way

[Chorus:]
Like a chain gang in a prison
You're with 'em... for too long
In a chain gang
You're with 'em... for too long

No way out, just a bloody trap I see
Hundred tons of dynamite rocket me!

When I blast down the walls - all night long
You're takin' part just in a play
Break it up in my own way

[Chorus]

A chain gang

[Chorus]

Far too long
Too long
You're in a chain gang - for too long
