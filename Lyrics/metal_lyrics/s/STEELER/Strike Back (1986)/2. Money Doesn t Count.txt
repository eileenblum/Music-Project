[Screaming:]
Money... doesn't count tonight!

Her stiletto heels... got me mesmorized
My blood begins to rise, I'm hypnotized, yeah
Leaned the birds and the bees
Right out on the streets
Your looks gave me a tease
Found myself needing you, needing you to be pleased

[Chorus 1:]
Going out on the town and we'll be out in the streets
Get ourselves unwound
Heading out for the town, the city never sleeps
Turn it upside down, down

[Chorus 2:]
Money doesn't count tonight
Lookin' for fun
Ain't gonna sleep tonight
Till the day is done, the day is done

Because I come from a gutter
Lived one day to another
Oh, how can I break the ice
Surrounding you, I'm longin' for paradise

[Chorus 1 and 2]

Oh, come on hear them
Bad screams in your head
They show me the paradise

[Chorus 1]

Money doesn't count tonight
Lookin' for fun
Ain't gonna sleep tonight
Till the day is done

Money doesn't count tonight
Lookin' for fun
Money, ain't gonna sleep tonight
Till the day is done, done, done...
