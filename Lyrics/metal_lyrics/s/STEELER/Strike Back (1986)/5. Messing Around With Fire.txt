[Music - Burtz, Eder, Pell / Lyrics - Burtz]

Riding a rocket, flashfire burns
Can't understand it, will they never learn?
Annihilation, dead or alive
So trigger-happy, that's our last drive

[Chorus 1:]
Nevermore - napalm machines again
Evermore - lifeless 'till the end

[Chorus 2:]
Messing around (around) with fire (around)
You will have to learn
If you're messing around (around) with fire (around)
You gotta get yourself burned

Enemy curses, aggressions - let go
Can't understand it, fight of friend or foe?
By blind emotion you can't return
Head or collision 'cos we never learn

Nevermore - napalm machines again
Evermore - lifeless - until the end

[Chorus 2]

If you're messing around

[Chorus 1 and 2]
[Chorus 2]

Messing around (around) with fire (around)
Annihilation, dead or alive
If you're messing around (around) with fire (around)
So trigger-happy, that's our last drive

Messing around (around) with fire (around)
Enemy curses
If you're messing around (around) with fire (around)
Agressions

Messing around (around) with fire (around)
Messing around with the fire, yeah
If you're messing around (around) with fire (around)

Messing around (around) with fire (around)
Messing around (around) with fire (around)
Messing around (around) with fire (around)
