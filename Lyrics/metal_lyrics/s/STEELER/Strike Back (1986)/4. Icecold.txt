[Music - Burtz, Eder, Pell / Lyrics - Burtz]

Cold as steel
A look... from her eyes
So innocent... she seems to be
But she's devil in disguise, yeah

[Chorus 1:]
You don't want - to recognize
That you're walkin' on a... razor's edge

[Chorus 2:]
She takes all she wants
Icecold

[Chorus 2]

Lay your life in her hands
She's so neat, yeah!
And soon you're a slave
It won't take long, boy
She'll watch you bleed

[Chorus 1 and 2]
[Chorus 2]

Oh yeah

[Chorus 1 and 2]
[Chorus 2 (3)]
