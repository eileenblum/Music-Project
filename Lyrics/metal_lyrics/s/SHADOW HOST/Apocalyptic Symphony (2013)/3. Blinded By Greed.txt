Corrupted politician, you're just
A pawn in evil game
Lobbying the laws for the force
Without a name

You vote with no shame for deforestation
Don't care about the greenhouse effect
Apres nous le deluge - you say every day
You'll be cursed for your neglect

You are blinded by greed
Master of confusion, kin of devil's breed
You are blinded by greed
Hungry for money, ready for deceit

In union with the criminals
Protecting filthy deeds
You always use your power
To satisfy your needs

You vote with no shame
For urbanization
Ignoring environment laws
Apres nous le deluge - you say every day
The end of the earth is too close
You vote with no shame
For monopolization
The kids we can barely feed
Apres nous le deluge - you say every day
The profit is all that you need

You are blinded by greed
Master of confusion, kin of devil's breed
You are blinded by greed
Hungry for money, ready for deceit

Corrupted politician, you'd sell
Your soul for one more dime
Our patience's getting shorter
You're running out of time

You are blinded by greed
Master of confusion, kin of devil's breed
You are blinded by greed
Hungry for money, ready for deceit
Hungry for money, ready for deceit
Master of confusion, devil's breed
