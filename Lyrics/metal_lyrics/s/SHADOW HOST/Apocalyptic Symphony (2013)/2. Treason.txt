I see your face on TV every day
On billboards and newspapers too
I hear your poisoned voice everywhere
I am sick and tired of you

A man of power with a strong twisted mind
Corrupted and ill to the core
Illegitimate leader crowned by fools
I don't wanna see you no more

Treason, treason - devil in disguise
There's no reason in your awful lies
Masked thief, I don't believe your words
You're a servant of chaotic hordes

Obsessed with wealth
Possessed by greed
Inferno is waiting for you

A man of power had nothing to fear
His servants are under control
Disgusting betrayer, rebellion is near
I don't wanna see you no more

Treason, treason - devil in disguise
There's no reason in your awful lies
Masked thief, I don't believe your words
You're a servant of chaotic hordes

Treason, treason - devil in disguise
There's no reason in your awful lies
Masked thief, I don't believe your words
You're a servant of chaotic hordes
