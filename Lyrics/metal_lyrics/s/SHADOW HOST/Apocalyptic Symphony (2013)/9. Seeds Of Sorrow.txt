What If I could change my life
Somewhere in the past
It makes me sad and makes my heart ache
But we never know what's best
Take it back just for one day
That flashed before my eyes
Will my sorrow go away?
Or the seeds will rise?

And I wonder does it Matter
If it gets worse or it gets better
When we understand
That time goes by so fast
And the pain I have to feel
Is it fake or is it real?
When I realise
I cannot change the past

The decisions that I've made
Were they good enough?
Too soft for life that I Obeyed
And way too rough for love?
Could I start again from here
Will we ever know?
Should my sorrow dissapear
Or the seeds will grow?

And I wonder does it Matter
If it gets worse or it gets better
When we understand
That time goes by so fast
And the pain I have to feel
Is it fake or is it real?
When I realise
I cannot change the past

Take my hand and I will follow
Will you take away my sorrow

And I wonder does it Matter
If it gets worse or it gets better
When we understand
That time goes by so fast
And the pain I have to feel
Is it fake or is it real?
When I realise
I cannot change the past
