Have you ever listened to your body
Your fat and ugly belly has to say
Just one more coke
One cheeseburger, one party
You can't return the life
You throw away

They kill us slowly, they kill us fast
With due respect and with disgust
They kill the promises we keep
They kill us (kill us!) in our sleep

Silent killing!

You eat genetic shit modification
You drink a beer
Just every fucking night
These calories that bring
You sweet salvation
They also paint your ass with cellulite

They kill us slowly, they kill us fast
With due respect and with disgust
They kill the promises we keep
They kill us (kill us!) in our sleep

Silent killing!

Astrology will eat
Your poor soul for dinner
Homeopathy eats
Your brain for lunch
You wallet is the one thing
That gets thinner
Another psychic says
Your ticket's punched

More caffeine, more salt
More good old mayo
You grow your belly
At the speed of light
Your bioactive hypertension chaos
Relieved by piece of cake into the night

They kill us slowly, they kill us fast
With due respect and with disgust
They kill the promises we keep
They kill us (kill us!) in our sleep

Silent killing!

They kill us slowly, they kill us fast
With due respect and with disgust
They kill the promises we keep
They kill us (kill us!) in our sleep

Silent killing!
Into the night!
The killing!
