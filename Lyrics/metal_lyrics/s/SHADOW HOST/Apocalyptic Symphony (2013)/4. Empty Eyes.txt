From nine to five you lose your mind
Become a slave become an empty shell
Robotic brains ignore your pain
They only care that you could serve them well

You know them too, strange dÃ©jÃ -vu
They have no clue, they stare at you

With empty eyes
So indifferent it's scary
Empty eyes
So unconcerned and weary
One thousand lies
There's nothing to respect
One thousand cries
There's nothing to regret

Another drink, another day
The more you buy, the more you fade away
They plant desires, control your mind
Your credit score will always ask for more

You know them too, strange deja-vu
They have no clue, they stare at you

With empty eyes
So indifferent it's scary
Empty eyes
So unconcerned and weary
One thousand lies
There's nothing to respect
One thousand cries
There's nothing to regret

Your office space became your home
Alarm-clock sounds
Boss on your telephone
He screams at his eternal slave
He bought your life
He owns your shallow soul

Empty eyes
So indifferent it's scary
Empty eyes
So unconcerned and weary
One thousand lies
There's nothing to respect
One thousand cries
There's nothing to regret
