Reborn in hate
Hate
They were reborn in hate
Hate

Belief indoctrination
For holy suicide
Forsaken generation
Was given a new guide
Deeply fanatic
Sincerely held
Religious to the extreme
The views of the world
Fundamentally meld
Building a violent team

Reborn in hate
Hate
They were reborn in hate
Hate

Ascetic deprivation
Don't matter - fake or real
Jihad justification
A soul that does not heal
Glorious bombings
Relinquish the pain
Stomping unfaithful to mud
Blood of the fathers
Was not spilled in vain
The best way of meeting your god

The faith overwhelmed his will
Fanatical clutches imprisoned his mind
Brainwashed to hate and kill
Terror ahead, nothing left behind

Reborn in hate
Hate
They were reborn in hate
Hate
