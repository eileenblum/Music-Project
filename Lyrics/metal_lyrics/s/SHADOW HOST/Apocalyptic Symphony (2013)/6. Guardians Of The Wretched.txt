The criminals on a payroll
The guardians of the damned
Your system made her last call
All signals from your brain are jammed
Your soul is decimated
Protecting stolen wealth
Your mind decapitated,
A harvester of filth

So big and strong, grey uniform
Judges on your side
You'll never find, you'll never hide
The little man inside

The first one wasn't easy
Your heart beat like a drum
Reward was much more pleasing
Look what you have become
No thoughts, no will, no conscience
No promises to keep
Just money-flavoured nonsense
For vodka-favoured sleep

So big and strong, grey uniform
Judges on your side
You'll never find, you'll never hide
The little man inside

Your masters know
The time will come
Your sins will start the revolution

The criminals on a payroll
The guardians of the damned
Your system made her last call
All signals from your brain are jammed
The generals of the wretched
Your legions never miss
They kick, and run, and snatch it
Enforcing shameful peace

So big and strong, grey uniform
Judges on your side
You'll never find, you'll never hide
The little man inside
