Seems golden age is over
And something's going wrong
Here comes the understanding
It's bitter clear and strong
Hell is paved with good intentions
Willingly we choose our fate
We're the ones who are in charge
Who swallows the bait?

We pretend we never know
But the mirrors always show
Never wash away our sins
The apocalypse within
Cold and misery inside
A collapse that we denied
Our sorrow's deep and fate is grim
The apocalypse within

Religious obscurity
Mass media profanation
A witch who shatters windows
The mental devastation
Forget the lying politicians
For it's you who chose them all
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
What have we done?

The brains of clay, enchanted
Don't want to see
Don't want to hear
Like dragon's teeth once planted
Our tolerance
Will turn to fear

We pretend we never know
But the mirrors always show
Never wash away our sins
The apocalypse within
Cold and misery inside
A collapse that we denied
Our sorrow's deep and fate is grim
The apocalypse within
