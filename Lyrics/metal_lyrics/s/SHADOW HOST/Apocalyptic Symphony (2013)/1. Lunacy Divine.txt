Welcome to the brave new world, 21 century
Infected by the ancient plague, weâre trapped in misery
Harbinger of apocalypse messiah for the weak
False prophet of the brainwashed slaves, ignorant and sick

Manipulation with subconsciousness throws us in agony
Protector of false promises, religious tyranny
Your true belief is just a fake, a vicious shameful masquerade
Behind the gates of godliness hides xenophobic hate

And now the world won't be the same
Deceitful lies in evil game
Blind eyes can't see the wicked sign
Of lunacy divine
Mankind is running to the end
The new dark ages close at hand
Awaiting us at finish line
See lunacy divine

Betrayed the constitution
Smashing down the human rights
Conspired with government
Perverted evil minds
Eradicate heterodoxy
Blinded by arrogance
Youâre spreading the disease
To control the innocent

And now the world won't be the same
Deceitful lies in evil game
Blind eyes can't see the wicked sign
Of lunacy divine
Mankind is running to the end
The new dark ages close at hand
Awaiting us at finish line
See lunacy divine
