Everyone knows since ancient times
Peasants and emperors alike
Devilish tricks of war and peace
Don't bring salvation

Someone who rose above the rest
Found the answer to this task
Gaining the toughness to control
The population

Break up
The power structure
Foster distrust
You horrid vulture

Divide and conquer
Divide and rule
The ancient maxim
Tyrannic school
Divide and rule
To reign the state
Divide and conquer
The axiom of fear and hate

The king of the hill protects his gold
No glory and blood in the name of god
He needs every slave to encourage
Meaningless consumption

He doesn't cry out for the holy war
He struggles for power, he needs more
"Divide at impera"
His words for domination

Break up
The power structure
Foster distrust
You horrid vulture

Divide and conquer
Divide and rule
The ancient maxim
Tyrannic school
Divide and rule
To reign the state
Divide and conquer
The axiom of fear and hate
