my path begins
in ancient fairytales
forgotten deep in time
in ocean of my daydreams
filled with my tears
I sacrifice my past:

whispering voices are
calling me again
I hear their crying
my heart is bleeding
please keep me from my thoughts
I can't come back

I just look into myself -
now darkest wasteland
I'm asking why I pay this price

lost in the neverending ancient tale
I lose my real face
passing through the age
where I was living in
I'm left alone and there's
nothing left behind my mask

I see through time
forgotten world in past
dream images never been real
why I've got this gift
I cannot die
sometimes it's just a torture to live forever

another day and other life begins
but pain remains and hurts me
only one step through door in memory
returns me to the forgotten land

lost in the neverending ancient tale
I forget my real name
condemned to live between
the shadows from the past
I'm left alone and there's
nothing left behind my back

falling in the waves of my feelings
I'm surrounded by cold walls of experience

there's no escape from fate
I try to stop this game
I must pass this way to the end

my remembrance is like a bridge
in endless time a thread in the dark

lost in the neverending ancient tale
I forget who I am
stranger in journey through the time
I'm left alone and there's
nothing left behind my back
