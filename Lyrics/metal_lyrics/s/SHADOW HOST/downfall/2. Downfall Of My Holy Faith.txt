downfall downfall
I'm feeling down my friend
my faith has gone in twilight thoughts
downfall downfall
I'm falling down my friend
my faith has gone in twilight thoughts

tell me your name
I'm a magic hand
I'm the only one who knows your life
all diseases with which you're ill
and who'll beat last nail
in the cover of your coffin

now listen to my voice
I'll be grave for your last doubts
you can't choose your fate

give me your hand
and your life will go quite
in another way
lead through my brain
come taste my game
I'm the last who wants to heal you

downfall of my holy faith
there's no another ways to end
a game with my gift to foretell
downfall of my holy faith
I staked on fortune and I failed
I'm warned by fate but I tell again

confidentially I tell you:
"you're nailed
to the barrel with powder
I can cut your fetters"
give me your gold
I can break your hope
I'm a fortune teller
where's your card

come come enter my nightmare
prey prey and once I'll hear you
god's slave listen to my words
I will break your chains
so come take part in downfall
of my staggered faith

listen to my voice of lies
I'll find rescue for you
just pay the price

I'm the last who wants to turn on light
I'm the last who wants to give you life
I'm the last who wants to heal you
to use the chaos of your thoughts
I'll never never tell you
how money changed and killed my life

downfall of my holy faith
there's no another ways to end
a game with my gift to foretell
downfall of my holy faith
I get torn by sudden pain
forbidden words I told again

I'm your god
I'm your holy faith
rot in waiting for the end
you've bought the calmness and confidence
I have buried last remains
of my black soul

downfall of my holy faith
there's no another ways to end
a game with my gift to foretell
downfall of my holy faith
I forget my father's face
the gift left me and never will appear again

downfall of my holy faith
downfall of my holy faith
