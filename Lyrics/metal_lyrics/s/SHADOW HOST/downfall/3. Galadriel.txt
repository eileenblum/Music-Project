how much water has gone
since those days
when first elf stepped on the earth
and until now we wandering here
among the world of woven trees!

O stars that
in the sunless year
with shining hand
by her were sown
in windy fields
now bright and clear
we see your silver blossom blown!

Gilthoniel! O Elbereth!
clear are thy eyes
and bright thy breath!
oh! snow - white queen!
we sing to thee
in a far land beyond the sea

Galadriel! Galadriel!
clear is the water of your well
white is the star in your white hand
unstained is leaf and land
more fair than thoughts of mortal men

In Dwimordene, In Lorien
seldom have walked the feet of men,
few mortal eyes have seen the light
that lies there ever, long and bright
long and bright

Galadriel! Galadriel!
clear is the water of your well
white is the star in your white hand
unmarred is leaf and land

Galadriel! Galadriel!
clear is the water of your well
more fair than thoughts of mortal men

O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!
we still remember, we who dwell
in this far land beneath the trees
thy starlight on the western seas
