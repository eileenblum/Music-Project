Standing on the crossroads
Watching sun goes down
What will the future bring?
I lost in thought

Staring at the fire's burning
Watching smoke drifts away
My life flash before my eyes

I'm stranger, I'm forsaken one
That is who I am now â forsaken one
I'm stranger, am I still alive?
If I deserve to die â forsaken one

Snow is falling down
Cold wind blowing at my face
I never thought I've come to this

Was I really banished?
Can't forget what they've done!
Now just a lone stranger
Forsaken one

I'm stranger, I'm forsaken one
That is who I am now â forsaken one
I'm stranger, am I still alive?
If I deserve to die â forsaken one

Bleeding heart and empty soul
Sadness is tearing me
And noone can hear my call
My world is no more

I'm stranger, I'm forsaken one
That is who I am now â forsaken one
I'm stranger, am I still alive?
If I deserve to die â forsaken one
