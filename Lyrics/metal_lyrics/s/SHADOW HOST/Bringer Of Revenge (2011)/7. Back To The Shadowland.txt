Through wild wood and swampland I ride in the night
Seems moment of truth is drawing near
I feel it, this deathtrap is waiting for me now
The gates of hell are open wide night and day...

Back to the shadowland, back to the shadowland
Once again I'm on the way of the damned
Back to the shadowland, back to the shadowland
There I'll find the answers or be condemned
Back to the shadowland, land of the damned

Shadows crawling in the dark, voices whisper in my ear
It might be secret demon's lurk, now it's time to face the fear
Shrouded in a gloomy light, shapeless figure moves to me
I drew my sword prepared to fight - you will die in agony!

Back to the shadowland, back to the shadowland
No way leads off from the land of the dead
Back to the shadowland, back to the shadowland
The land full of anguish and dread

Show me the right way, give me a guiding light
To reach out and complete my guest
Give me the answers, be by my side
And finally let my soul to rest

Back to the shadowland, back to the shadowland
Once again I'm on the way of the damned
Back to the shadowland, back to the shadowland
There I'll find the answers or be condemned
Back to the shadowland, back to the shadowland
No way leads off from the land of the dead
Back to the shadowland, back to the shadowland
The land full of anguish and dread

Back to the shadow
Back to the shadow
Back to the shadow
Shadowland
