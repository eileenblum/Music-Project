I woke up this morning
And wiped cold sweat away
Still can't forget the nightmare
Of something wicked grows in me...

Now I hear the voices inside my head
Clearly like never before
Some kind of whispers, evil and dread
I cannot stand it anymore

There is something I can't understand
Secret lost six feet under the sand
In the north desert, distant and cold
There is only one secret left untold

Beyond the wasteland over the hills
To the black caverns I'll go
Leading by voices I run through the dark
Every night from dusk till dawn

Old gypsy never told me
Something 'bout my fate
Now she's dead and gone
And I feel it's too late

There is something I can't understand
Secret lost six feet under the sand
In the north desert, distant and cold
There's only one secret left untold

I woke up this morning
And wiped cold sweat away
Still can't forget the nightmare
Of something wicked grows in me...

Secret left untold, one secret left untold

There is something I can't understand
Secret lost six feet under the sand
In the north desert, distant and cold
There's only one secret left untold
