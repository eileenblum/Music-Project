I opened my eyes feel the pain inside
Only dead ruins surround me in silence
Is it a dream, or is it now?

Smoldering ashes rise over the ground
Seems no one alive remained there
Dead bodies of my party, blood's all around
I see signs of death everywhere

Eye for an eye, I swear revenge will be mine
I promise you shall not survive
Fear my angry battle cry, eye for an eye!

My blood is still running from the wounds
Shapeless memories slowly destroy my mind
My heart, my soul are gone so far from home
I'm lost, I'm alone!

Someone wake me up from this awful dream!
I don't wanna see what I see!
Oh god, do you hear my silent scream
Or maybe, my lord, you left me?

Eye for an eye, I swear revenge will be mine
I promise you shall not survive
Fear my angry battle cry, eye for an eye!

Eye for an eye, I swear revenge will be mine
I promise you shall not survive
Fear my angry battle cry, eye for an eye!
