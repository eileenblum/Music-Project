Last night I've got a weird dream
When moonlight slowly grows dim
A magic vision rising true
I was surprised, oh, is that you?

I felt warm breath so close to me,
Oh, could it really be?
Your fingers slightly touch my skin
I hear your silent whispering

Beware your dreams, beware your dreams
One day dreams might come true
Beware your dreams, beware your dreams
It may be dangerous for you

Dream comes so strong, so crystal clear
And vision takes away my fear
I recognize gentle embrace
I'm thrown into emotion's maze

Pale shine of stars surrounds me
Passes through my body, makes me free
I feel so strange under your gaze
I can't forget your angel grace

Beware your dreams, beware your dreams
One day dreams might come true
Beware your dreams, beware your dreams
The nightmare creeping next to you

Beware your dreams, beware your dreams
One day dreams might come true
Beware your dreams, beware your dreams
The nightmare creeping next to you
