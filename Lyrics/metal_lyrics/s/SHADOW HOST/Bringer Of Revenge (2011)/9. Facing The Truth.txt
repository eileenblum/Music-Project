Mistress of deception, two-faced unholy beast
This evil-minded witch fooled me without a shame
Vile shape-shifting demon, true devil incarnate
Trapped in a corner she will die in flames!

All hopes are gone
No place to run no place to hide
It's time to pay the highest price

Facing the truth
I finally revealed who I really am
The hand of doom
For my deeds I'll be forever damned

"Not a god blessed hero, you are one of our kind
Same violent mad butcher with twisted evil mind
Small part of shattered talisman, goddamned angeleye
Poisoning your blood for many years, and makes you blind"

All hopes are gone
No place to run no place to hide
It's time to pay the highest price

Facing the truth
I finally revealed who I really am
The hand of doom
For my deeds I'll be forever damned

Revenge is done
And I can never change my fate
The wicked curse is mine...

Facing the truth
I finally revealed who I really am
The hand of doom
For my deeds I'll be forever damned
