Hate, fury, anger boiling in my veins
Dark emotions, smell of blood driving me insane
Don't try to hide on the dark side,
My hunting has begun
Your time is short, prepare to fight,
'Cause revenge must be done

Demon hunter â bringer of death
I am the one who will take your last breath
Demon hunter â angel in black
I am the one who will bring you back
To hell

Screams of your agony â there's only I want to hear
Fall to your knees â your final hour is near
I have no mercy no regrets my truth is by my side
Demonic creatures, spawns of hell you are gonna die!

Demon hunter â bringer of death
I am the one who will take your last breath
Demon hunter â angel in black
I am the one who will bring you back
To hell

Demon hunter â bringer of death
I am the one who will take your last breath
Demon hunter â angel in black
I am the one who will bring you back
To hell
