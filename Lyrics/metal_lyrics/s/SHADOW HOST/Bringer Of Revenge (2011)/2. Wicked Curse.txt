It's dark and cold here
I know it's time to run
Lost in this wasteland
What is done cannot be undone

Now lonesome stranger
I was born as king son
I buried my past life
New chapter has begun

Into the unknown, fear, darkness and pain
I plunged in grief

Curse, wicked curse
True evil damnation upon hopeless soul
Curse, wicked curse
Unholy oppression leads me straight to fall

My father died
With sword in his hand
Defending burning palace
In final stand

My land lies in ruins
Thousands people died
Starvation and plunder
I see in every town

Curse, wicked curse
True evil damnation upon hopeless soul
Curse, wicked curse
Unholy oppression leads me straight to fall

No one have believed my tale
My brother Bourgnir said:
"You ruined our best warriors
In your worthless campaign!
You're guilty in their death
And you shall pay"

My land lies in ruins
Thousands people died
Starvation and plunder
I see in every town

Curse, wicked curse
True evil damnation upon hopeless soul
Curse, wicked curse
Unholy oppression leads me straight to fall
