night falls on the water
the ocean reflects heaven's vault...
she dances on a star's valley
the lovely queen of magic scope
listen to the mermaid's voice from lucid sky
and allow summer night to enter
into your dreams and life
and brush away a tear
when seven songs will melt in night away
hear the songs 'bout day and night
bright stars and the sun
that shines in realms of life
where the mermaids waiting for you
hear the songs 'bout death and life
they'll come through dream
and call your name in this moonlight
to take you away till the morning
the third is 'bout fate
of ocean and time
the pearly tears flowing
on face of the land
and sobbing of rain
returns me to dusk
I found calmness in wandering
through thousand miles
but I'll return with the dawn
hear the songs 'bout day and night
bright stars and the sun
that shines in realms of life
where the mermaids waiting for you
hear last words in breath of the wind
the dawn burned night
and wakes up lovely land
to return you from the dreams
and forget the mermaid's face
but silent ocean placed her tears
on flowers, grass and leaves
the songs of night, of wind and life
melt in dawn away
