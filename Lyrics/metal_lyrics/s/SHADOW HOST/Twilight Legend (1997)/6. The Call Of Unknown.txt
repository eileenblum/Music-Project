I woke up one day morning
to close my eyes again
blood beats in temples:
they're somewhere here
day is turning on the light
and twilight gets away together
with their mortal call
you really know the way
I'll go beyond the line of life
their voices calling for help
I have to go to the other side
please, don't delay me
oh, please, give me a chance
or bilbo'll never find the ring
go out of the mirages
life is just a game
I'm a pawn in hands of fate
it placed me on black check
the way leads me to unknown
far beyond the thousand walls
keep the faith, who stay at home
I'll be off but you'll
stay alone, my friend
the life will burn in fairy-tale
the life will burn in fairy-tale
life will never be back again
from the mirrorland
life will never keep the ring
if I stay at home
I must know last mystery
where hide borders of the life
where is the mort
and what is fate
too long I waited for a sign
I hope I'll be in time
or last shot'll never see the tower
go out of the mirages
life is just a game
I'm a pawn in hands of fate
it placed me on black check
the way leads me to unknown
far beyond the thousand walls
keep the faith, who stay at home
go out of the mirages
life is just a game
I'm a pawn in hands of fate
it placed me on black check
the way leads me to unknown
far beyond the thousand walls
keep the faith, who stay at home
