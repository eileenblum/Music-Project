the roots of our past
lost in the abyss of time
and noone remember
who we are and where we go
the years passes by
and generations changing
scince makes progress faster
people learn and try to find
the answers to all questions
that every day
ask them their life
we try to reach a certain line
of cognition that lies
far beyond the horizon
of our scanty fantasy
I close my eyes I see the visions
of past and future life
I try to get to know the knowlege
beyond the line
I search answers to all questions
that always teased me
beyond the line
I try to find the way
that leads out of this reality
sometimes mankind is
like a little blind child
lost in the eternal night
unexplored phenomenons frighten gives rise
to dusk emotions of our fear
I know
we'll never reach this world
beyond this line
it's just a dream burning
deep in my mind
I close my eyes I see the visions
of past and future life
I try to get to know the knowlege
beyond the line
I search answers to all questions
that always teased me
beyond the line
I try to find the way
that leads out of this reality
beyond the line
I search answers to all questions
that always teased me
beyond the line
I try to find the way
that leads out of this reality
