I came from another world
from the mirror's other side
I'm on my way to nowhere
but I hope to meet my fatherland again
at the end of my time
born as king's son but
now I'm just a stranger
in your god, godforsaken land
lost in your lies
inside this sunless desert
I'm walking through shadows
four mirror walls held me...
forever...
through dream and nightmare
I walk alone
when mirrors rise before me
when faces melt in glass away
the mind leaves me
I know it's time to run
when shadows are really walking
when guardian angel sleeps still
the ancient story ends
and light grows dim
in the mirrorland
I ever knew I have no obsessions
I ever knew I have no obsessions
but faces in mirrors I saw them before
this world lives by laws
of fear and insanity
the lies bears the madness
that grows up in me
I just cry...
don't speak distorted truth
don't bear another lie
through dream and through nightmare
I'll come back now falling...
when mirrors rise before me
when faces melt in glass away
the mind leaves me
I know it's time to run
when shadows are really walking
when guardian angel sleeps still
the ancient story ends
and light grows dim
in the mirrorland
I've lost the road back to my home
I still cannot remember my name
my quest for the light will never end
while the walls of glass
standing still around me
the day has gone and lie has won
when mirrors rise before me
when faces melt in glass away
the mind leaves me
I know it's time to run
when shadows are really walking
when guardian angel sleeps still
the ancient story ends
and light grows dim
in the mirrorland
