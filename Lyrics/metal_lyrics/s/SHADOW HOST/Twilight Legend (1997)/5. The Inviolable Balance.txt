tell me
what's happened to me
what's happened to my soul
I don't know
it looks
like an endless fall
sometimes I feel that
someone else hides in me
it tries to possess me
and wants to break free
sometimes it seems to me that
my reality was broken
and I see black shadow
of my inner self
walls of cold fear
will rise and surround me
and I'll feel rising creature's breath
between two sides I live my life
so far from light too close to dark
walk on the border of the other side
one step beyond - and creature will rise
I keep the inviolable balance
I keep the balance
time keeps the inviolable balance
I keep the balance
my soul consists of two opponent parts
one part is white so another is black
I feel instinctive despair
when it's so close to me
I tried to run away
but it's like
like an opening door without a key
I keep the inviolable balance
I keep the balance
time keeps the inviolable balance
I keep the balance
I understand that white or black force
will never win in my mind
this struggle inside me cannot be stopped
it will be an eternal fight
between two sides I live my life
so far from truth too close to lie
walk on the border of the other side
one step beyond - and creature will rise
I keep the inviolable balance
I keep the balance
time keeps the inviolable balance
I keep the balance
