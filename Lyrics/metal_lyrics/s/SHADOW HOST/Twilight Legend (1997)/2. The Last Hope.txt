when my sorrow is growing
and cold poison is filling my soul
know that
fear increases inside
when sunlight is broken
night falls down on me
I stay alone with my thoughts
where am I falling
when will it end
see beam of hope made its way
through my heart

bright realms of freedom burn in the night
my life is gone forever
darkness can cover the way
from this nightmare
when my last hope disappears
all my life I'm waiting
for this day, for the answer of god
staying alone with my visions
and thoughts
I plunged into warm sunbeams
of the passed days
the night changed my day
from sunrise to sunset
the madness makes me blind
I'm fooled by destiny
I'll never rise again
I tasted the pain
the circle closed
light's falling through the dark forever
bright realms of freedom burn in the night
my life is gone forever
darkness can cover the way
from this nightmare
when my last hope disappears
morbid thoughts and darkest dreams
may be never leave me
I don't wanna know my future
who can tell me what will be
bright realms of freedom burn in the night
my life is gone forever
darkness can cover the way
from this nightmare
when my last hope disappears
will I ever hear the voice of mind
or the way will show me somewhere
any sign of life
answers gone
but last hope
never die
