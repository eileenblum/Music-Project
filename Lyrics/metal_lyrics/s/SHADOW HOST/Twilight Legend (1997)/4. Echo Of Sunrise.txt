sometimes I felt your cold
leave me... save me... leave me... heal me...
leave me alone, my sun,
you know my pain and my fear
have you heard my cry
when I was blinded by your cold light
have you heard?
I am your child, your hope, your dream
just dream that never will become reality
my song bears under the burden of your beams
and turns into insanity
my reflection smiles to me
(from your mirror)
I see nothing except my tears
no, I feel no pain inside
I left my pain in the night
and I accept your poisoning light
no, I feel no fear inside
hear my song as well as I hear
the unborn child's cry
you'll never melt into dew drops
frosen illusions of my fantasy
so freeze now remembrance
they get me back in nightmare
of my broken destiny
you'll never warm my heart
by your crystal tears your cold light
so burn to ashes all years
that I left behind
the notes of my song turned to ashes
and gold runes of book of my destiny
wiped off to dust
no, I feel no life inside
my song is echo of sunrise
a whispering of the dead lowtide
no, I feel no fear inside
hear my song as well as I hear
the unborn child's cry
rising shadows from the dusk
filling up my dreams
I see nothing like your light
to pull me off this pain
leave me... save me... leave me... pull me...
hear these last words of my song
read between the lines of life
it's only echo of sunrise -
I'll never see the morning
no, I see no sign outside
oh, please, release me
from this deadly kind
no, I hear no words inside
take my hand
I stay on the other side
now I'm going far from you
I to meet the dead moonlight
I'm going to the neverland
where the unborn children cry...
