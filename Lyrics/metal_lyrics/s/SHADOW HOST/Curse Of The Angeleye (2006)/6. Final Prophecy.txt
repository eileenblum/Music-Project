I'm The Fortune Teller, And Arzah Is My Name
Old Weak Gypsy, Still My Gift Remains The Same
Come Closer, Stranger, Let Me See Your Hand
I Guess Your Came From A Distant Foreign Land!
I'll Show You The Right Way, Now Listen To Me
And Don't Be Afraid - I'm Not Your Enemy

I Am The One Who Knows The Truth
Remember Words I Telling You
Your Destiny - I Clearly See
Befare Of The Prophecy

Somewhere Far From Here, Beyond The Eastern Sands
Lies Small Forgotten Kingdom, Enchanted Ancient Land
There's A Realm Of Walking Shadows, A Den Of Evil Will
Beware Old Whitehaired Madman, That Rules Those Lands With Fear
Be Quick My Dear Stranger, Time Waits For No One
You Must Complete Your Quest Until The World Is Gone

I Am The One Who Knows The Truth
Remember Words I Telling You
Your Destiny - I Clearly See
Take Care Of The Prophecy

I Am The One Who Knows The Truth
Remember Words I Telling You
Your Destiny - I Clearly See
The Final Prophecy
