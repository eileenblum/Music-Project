Four Month Have Passed We're So Far From Home
Descending From Mountains We See Ughman Below
No Sign Of Creatures, No Human Kind
Only Smell Of Death - We're On The Dark Side

It Seems Our Journey Comes To A Bitter End
What We Are Doing In This Godforsaken Land?

Abandon All Hopes, Who Enter This Place
A Realm Where Your Dreams Will Be Gone
Cold Freezing Wind, Gloomy Whispers In Haze
It Might Be The Quest For The Fearless One

Blurred Shapeless Shadows Moving In The Fog
Reek Of The Decay Slowly Rising From The Bog
Silence, Time Stands Still Before The Storm
Before The Primal Evil Takes Its Ultimate Form

Suddenly I've Heard A Weird Distant Cry
I Felt Gooseflesh Run Up My Arms

Abandon All Hopes, Who Enter This Place
A Realm Where Your Dreams Will Be Gone
Cold Freezing Wind Gloomy Whispers In Haze
It Might Be The Quest For The Fearless One
