The Hour Of Eclipse,
Darkness Falls Upon Me
I Clear My Mind At Once
How Blind I Was To See...

I Opened The Gateways
Should Never Be Opened
Possessed By Angeleye
That Drives Me So Mad

My God, Curse Me For A Fool!
My Hands Soiled With Blood Forevermore
The Shocking Truth I Faced
Astounded Me...

Cast Down On Me Whole Heaven's Wrath
And Slay Me With Your Holy Flame
Burn Me Alive, Crumble To Dust
Though All My Blood Can't Wash My Blame Away

I'm Not The Same
I'm Not Myself No Longer
My Deeds Can't Be Undone
Evil Is Getting Stronger

Condemned I Am
Inferno Is Waiting For My Soul
Damnation 'll Be The Price
For My Fatal Fault

Time To Baptize My Flesh By Fire,
The Only Way To Purify My Sins
To Set Back Crawling Chaos
Before The Beast In Me Finally Wins

Cast Down On Me Whole Heaven's Wrath
And Slay Me With Your Holy Flame
Burn Me Alive, Crumble To Dust
Though All My Blood Can't Wash My Blame Away
