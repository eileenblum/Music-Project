I See Strongest Vision, Never Seen Before
I See Dying Beauty, Crying Out In Pain
Pretty Wings Are Broken, Sorrow Deeply In Eyes
I See Angel Dying, Crying Out My Name

I Hear Words Of Wisdom, Full Of Darkest Pain
Dreamlike Story, Forgotten Ancient Tale

Now It's Time To Believe The Ancient Prophecies
It Foresaw Dark Forces Rising Up Again
Now It's Time For The One When All Hopes Are Gone
And Dark Power Awoke From Its Sleep

"Power Long Asleep Awoken In The Dark
It Makes Some People Turn To Black Evil Will
The Angeleye Once Hidden From The Mortal Man
Has Come Into Your World Again..."

Frightening Emotions Grows Deep Within My Mind
Suddenly Vague Visions Arise Before My Eyes

Now It's Time To Believe The Ancient Prophecies
It Foresaw Dark Forces Rising Up Again
Now It's Time For The One When All Hopes Are Gone
And Dark Power Awoke From Its Sleep
