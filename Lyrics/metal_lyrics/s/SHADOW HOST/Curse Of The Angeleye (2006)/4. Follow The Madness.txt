The Blessed Sage, The Healer
He Used To Be The Chosen One...
One Day His Gift Becomes A Curse

Once He Found An Ancient Scripture
Hidden From The Mortal's Eye
And Deciphers Forbidden Sacred Runes

Arlorn Reveal The Secret Of The Ancients, Elder Race
Lost Behind The Sands Of Time, Thousands Years Ago
The Power He Unleashed, Can't Be Controlled In Any Way
He Was Condemned, Pure Dreams Comes Crashing Down

Follow The Madness, His Power Grows Day By Day
Sorrow And Sadness, He Will Bring Coming This Way

It Was A Talisman Of Magic Power -"The Angeleye"
Kept In Deepest Caves Beneath The Ground

Inhuman Beauty Of The Orb Drives Arlorn Insane
He Lost His Soul And Trapped Within The Madness
Forever He Was Damned, No One Can Help Him Now
Wicked Will Of Angeleye Finally Takes Control

Follow The Madness, His Power Grows Day By Day
Sorrow And Sadness, He Will Bring Coming This Way

Follow The Madness, His Power Grows Day By Day
Sorrow And Sadness, He Will Bring Coming This Way
