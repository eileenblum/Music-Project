Welcome To The Hell On Earth
The Final Armageddon
Our Slender Order
Bristled Up With Spears
Blinded By The Holy Wrath
With Fury In Our Eyes
And We'll Fight
To Our Last Breath

First Move Is Done
Unholy Slaughter Starts
We Have No Choice
It's Time To Die

No Chance To Survive
No Chance To Stay Alive

Hate Filled Screams Of Angry Creatures
Raging In The Air
Lightning Breaks Across
The Blackened Sky
Axes Wield And Arrows Fly
Ripping Through The Flesh
Hear Breath Of Death
In Final Battle Clank

The Die Is Cast
It Seems TheEnd Is Near
Our Last Reserve
Attacks In Deadly Dash
Last Move Is Done
Condemned We Are
We Have No Choice
It's Time To Die

No Chance To Survive
No Chance To Stay Alive
