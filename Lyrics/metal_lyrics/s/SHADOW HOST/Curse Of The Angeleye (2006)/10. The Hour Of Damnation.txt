Finally I Found The Pathway To The Secred Labyrinth
And Now I'm Driven Only By Hatred
Chilling Screams Of Nameless Terrors Ripping Through My Ears
Black Shadows Creeping In The Dark

Blindness Increases When I Enters Evil's Den
Cold Wind Spreading Fear On It's Wings
Countless Creatures Suddenly Surrounds Me
Death Awaits - I Barely See It's Smile

In The Hour Of Damnation
I Choose My Fate
Now It's Time To Descent
Through The All Rings Of Hell

It's Time To Feed My Hungry Sword
With Your Unholy Flesh
I Will Avenge, I Will Dispatch You
Back To Hell
I Left Behind Me Chasing Creatures
I Enter Enchanted Darkened Cave
Cold Ancient Walls With Magic Runes
I See The Angeleye Amid Of The Hall

In The Hour Of Damnation
I Choose My Fate
Now It's Time To Descent
Through The All Rings Of Hell

I Raise My Sword To Shatter The Damned Angeleye
I Condemn Myself To Be Damned For All Time
Darkness Breaks Up With Lightning Strikes And Fire
I'm Falling On The Shaking Ground

In The Hour Of Damnation
I Choose My Fate
Now It's Time To Descent
Through The All Rings Of Hell
