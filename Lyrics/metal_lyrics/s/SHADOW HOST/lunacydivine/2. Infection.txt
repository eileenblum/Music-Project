Another griping headline
Another violent act
Don't vote for toleration
Not us who must adapt
The country and the lifestyle
You so want to enjoy
Is not a place for exile
More like a Broken toy

Infection in our Land
We must defend
Barbaric Feast of Hate
Infection! Vile pest
Unbidden guest
It's time to vaccinate

The life that you came after
Is hanging off the Edge
And we don't want your Laughter
At Our Flag and our Pledge
The pitiful statisic
That comes from savage lands
Fanatic evil mystic
The blood is on your hands
If you want to establish
The right to beat your wife
Go back to where you came from
Don't touch our way of life

Infection in our Land
We must defend
Barbaric Feast of Hate
Infection! Vile pest
Unbidden guest
It's time to vaccinate!

If you can't understand this
Just listen to what I say
You always have the option
The right to go away

Infection in our Land
We must defend
Barbaric Feast of Hate
Infection! Vile pest
Unbidden guest
It's time to vaccinate!
