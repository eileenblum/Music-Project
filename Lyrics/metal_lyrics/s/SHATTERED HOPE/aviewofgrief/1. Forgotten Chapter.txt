Your world is built by lies
Your reality's created by liars
You set a trap in my mind
I cry to you...
...to get in life!

Your blind mind!
Your eyeless soul!
Running for the night
Dead at all!

I was stuck for a while
In this state of mind
I create my own lie
My true,VITAL LIE!

Is this Hell?
Is this Life?
Is this Heaven
without light?

Can you see?
Can feel?
Take my hand
Set me FREE!!

Consolation I find in lies
The emptiness of myself i see
My mind trapped in time
Forever in this VITAL LIE!!
