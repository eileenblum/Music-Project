I wonder if, you could ever define
Your indescribable laxity
Changing cold, strange lava
Become misleading
LIES!!!

Naked I stand, watching these
Unknown, incubating thoughts
We reveal and grow
our fake impressions
You grieve and you taste
The emptiness of joy!!

Vacantly you laugh!!
Skin-deep you are!!
Somehow you wanted that!!

Joyful the face of tranquillity
Prediction in eternity
The odour of mind
Seduces silence
Feelings in a wound
Dreams in multiple ways
Fuck the deadlock
And move over!!

Sinking from the visions of my heart
I see dead clouds surrounding me!!

The voices we loved!!
The promises we broke!!
The changes you thought!!
Perfection,you're in LOVE!!
