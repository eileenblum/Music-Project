Voices from the past
Blank now, without meaning
They come to make me
Remember these memories!

I once thought I had something
A promise of living a life
Without pain and sorrow
But now, only a remembrance is left!!

But no
Please no more, tears, sorrow, pain and lies
Hollow promises and growing despair
PLEASE NO MORE!!!

Time passes by and nothing changes
As I sink myself in sadness
Trying to reconcile
With something I can't bear
With something I fear

Now I lost it all
A word of promise
Precious for me is gone
I shouldn't fear anything else
As nothing is remained for me
As everything passes by
As I lost my courage
As I can't trust nothing!!
