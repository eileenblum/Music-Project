I'm so tired now
Walking this unending path
All that's remained here
Is nothing but sorrow and tears
All that I hear
Is my weeping all these years
Remnants of myself in fear
And darkness never clears

Living all my life in lies
Believing in untrue hopes
Wishing for something
Weeping all alone

Promises forgotten
Thoughts always unspoken
Wishes still unborn
And dreams fade away
I can't find an answer
I can't see the way
For my poor soul
To set it free forever!!

As I farewell life now
I know everything is lost for me
Only loneliness I met
In silence I was left

I have lost myself now
In this painful season
As I'm looking to the snow
I can't find a reason
To understand why
Screams in silence destroyed
I always need to cry
Only sorrow is allied

I lead my soul to this soulless Heaven!
I know that nothing can hurt me but my wishes!
Wishes and dreams of something that will never be the same!
After my soul has died there's nothing left for me!
Sentenced to live in sorrow and counting my tears!
