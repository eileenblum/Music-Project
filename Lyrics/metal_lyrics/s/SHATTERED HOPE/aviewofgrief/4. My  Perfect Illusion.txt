I awake in my fears
My dreams haunt me
I see your face in my tears
With dreams forever lost
My heart beats no more
As night is falling
Wretched thoughts have been born
And my worries are growing!!

Spirits obey me
Lead me to labyrinths
With happiness broken
And sadness has grown in me
My veins are frozen
You didn't look in me
My life is worthless
And my tries hopeless
Again I dream you
Unable to hear
I touch you, I feel you
So weak to live!!

I live in despair
So I have lost my faith
My shadow disappears
Life dressed in pain
I endure for everything
And I live in vain

Now I lead myself to madness
Forever! Eternally!
I hear my soul crying
In hopelessness confined
I live in fear
I live for your illusion
The only thing can heal me
The only lie I believe

Curse my soul and lead me to your way!
Until I awake again to face the truth!
Take what has left of myself...!!
