Waking up in fear, filthy sweat on my body
Your hand no more... on mine
Without you, all alone
Pain, my only friend and guid
You came into my life
Fire burning in the night
Oh, now you have died
All the light in Underworld
Darkness covered my eyes
The trees have dropped their leaves
I wait for you my love, your touch will stop my heart
You haunt my dreams, this wasn't meant to last
Your silent screams - these shadows from the past
Cover me with your beauty...
Eyes full of you...
Death with no meaning...
Embrace me (I've been falling for so long)
Swallow me (There's no escape)
Feel me (Dreams are fading away)
Kill me
Bury me deep inside this dream
Burn my eyes, blinding light...
Wild flower in garden of heaven
Release me from this hell...
