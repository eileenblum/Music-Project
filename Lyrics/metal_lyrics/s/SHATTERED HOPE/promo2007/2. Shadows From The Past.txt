Deadmoon rising
Enlighten the darkness of my soul
As it withers through ages
Waiting this empty dream
Black sky
Showing my fate, my dreams, my life
And I sigh as I walk this
...dead path
Loveless heart cries in pain
All we shared has left me back
It will be no star in my sky
I'll never wish as ever
Same dream forever

Dry my lips with your kiss
Sweet and warm
This rain is killing me
Beckoming one with my tears

Feel every single beat of my
aching heart
You... my death...
