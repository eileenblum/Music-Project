Dead-moon rising
Enlighten the darkness of my soul
As it withers through ages
Waiting this empty dream

Black sky
Showing my fate, my dreams, my life
And I sigh as I walk in this dead path

Loveless heart cries in pain
All we shared has left me back
It will be no star in my sky
I'll never wish again
Same wish as ever
Same dream forever

Dry my lips with your kiss
Sweet and warm as always
This rain is killing me
Becoming one with my tears

Feel every single beat
Of my aching heart
You, my death
