Give me a reason to believe
Tonight that sleep is so quiet
Invading my dreams again
Dark rainbow between me and you

Desire feeds my lust
Hopeless words echo my ears
There's no one I can trust
A river so cold of tears

Drown in fear, failed for your God
Seek for salvation, spill all your blood
Memories still erased, forever insane
So far away, melting in the rain

This feeling is being sacrificed
In the name of true love
Invisible all the right decisions
Slipping around me
Fading visions led by a star
A freezing wind came from very far

Why I have to face myself again?
One moment, one life, just one love
Like an angel came down to Earth
You're the worst nightmare I've ever had

Have you ever waited for something
So pointless for others but for you so deep

Waiting, waiting, waiting but nothing in the way
Please the time has come
This kind of love can't hold me back
So goodbye, I wish you luck

Deep within dark clouds of my life
I stand here alone
Under this moonlit sky
Holding hands with sanity

This feeling is being sacrificed
In the name of true love
Invisible all the right decisions
Slipping around me
And when is nothing left to scorn
You're embraced by this twilight cold
