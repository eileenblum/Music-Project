Only the few who gave their heart
Are able to ease their burden
So hard for anyone to recognize
Their precious love was kept inside
Listen to their whispering souls
Like a sweet melody
And take a journey through
Magic places of dawn

She was all his universe
And knew he'd never leave
His eyes reflect her image
A pain she'd never give
So close to her heart
She's given meaning to his life
Always there for her
Bleeding for her wounds
Scarred his permanent misery
Ruined cheerful daybreak

She sailed for another port
His fears became reality
Separated her way
Denied their own destiny
Moved away from his arms
One last kiss to remember
This entwined past
Love could never blossom

A tragic figure you are
Wounded in her apathy
Don't forget this kiss
That brought you into lethargy
You can't forgive her
As you always did
Your heart is missing
She's all you need

She sailed for another port
His fears became reality
Separated her way
Denied their own destiny
Moved away from his arms
One last kiss to remember
This entwined past
Love could never blossom

Now tears from her weeping eyes
A touch on her cold hand
Dark power in it
Ripped out your wings
But only for a moment
Every night depression it brings
Both Heaven and Hell in one
Yet a body so untouched
You lost your way somehow in her past
For how long this dream could last
