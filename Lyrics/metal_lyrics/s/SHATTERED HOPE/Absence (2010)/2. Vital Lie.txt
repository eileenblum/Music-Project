Your world is built by lies
Your reality's full of liars
Deep light before my eyes
There's no way to get in life

Your blind mind
Your eyeless soul
Waiting for the night
So grey at all

I stuck for a while
In this state of mind
Creating my own lie
This true, vital lie!!

No, I'm heading down
Towards this tragic ending
Never to be seen
Lost for this dream

Oblivion shatters my days
This land met no sunshine
Tired body slowly decays
Dry mouths begging for wine

Time will heal these wounds
Voices in your head
Whispering your name
The feeling remains the same

Consolation I found in fantasy
Morbid thoughts around my head
Seeking for this ecstasy
Emotions I've felt so dead
