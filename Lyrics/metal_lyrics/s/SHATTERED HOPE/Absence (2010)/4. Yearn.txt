My mind flies over the skies
Reaching the madness you'll never be
Escape this world and then I am there
Standing in front of you
Before the river
We once kissed goodbye

Reflections of the past
A few luminous marks
To reveal this dark of me

Beyond the stars
When all is blank
Half-moon dreams
Seem so lucid

Far away
Where death is real
Abysmal thoughts floating
Time will never heal you

Tonight you're my guest
To this suicide scene
Mirror never lies

When no hope is in sight
Let yourself crawl in time
And just look to a distant memory
Realize how it feels to be alive
