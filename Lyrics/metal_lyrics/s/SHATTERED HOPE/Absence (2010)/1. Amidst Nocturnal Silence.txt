Behold, a sinful tear
The one that shed with guilt
Follow this light upon my eyes
Days are passing by in grey

Erase all the feelings moaning in your mind
Amidst eternal promises of love and despair

Beware, hypocrisy comes infernally
Invades your helpless body
Poisoning your innocence
Like salt on your wounds

Tears your heart, drags you down
Fade into dusk
Eternal rain soaks your soul

Grey are the shadows
Follow them but don't believe
These fake illusions
Are everywhere when you grieve

Under this pale moon
Tonight I reign
In my kingdom of dust
Truth seems so vain

Your need for salvation
Stronger than any thought
An unknown destination
Proves you're such a fraud
Just a naked body
Lack of feelings, no sense
Buried from reminiscence

Empty eyes, full of blood
Staring nowhere, you can't hide

You die every time
Your truth becomes a lie

Tears your heart, drags you down
Fade into dusk
Eternal rain soaks your soul

Grey are the shadows
Follow them but don't believe
These fake illusions
Are everywhere when you grieve
