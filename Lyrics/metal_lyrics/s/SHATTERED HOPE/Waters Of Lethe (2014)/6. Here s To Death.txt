âFucking Human Race
Your time is up
What did you think?
This is the revenge of the Unseenâ

Pray to your God
Îedtime story ghost
But until the end
You realizeâ¦
Thereâs only one God
And is called Death
Letâs raise our cups
Whoâs next?

Heâs coming for everyone
So why should I cry for it?
Our existence ends

Pray to your God
A bedtime story ghost
But until the end
You realizeâ¦
Thereâs only one God
And is called Death
Letâs raise our cups
Whoâs next?

Heâs the Great Observer
We are the authors of
Our destiny butâ¦
He writes the Epilogue

Ephemeral joy
All the others will give you
Everlasting downfall
His lethal lust

âFucking Human Beings
Die in anguish
Racist scams vanish
Like never existedâ
