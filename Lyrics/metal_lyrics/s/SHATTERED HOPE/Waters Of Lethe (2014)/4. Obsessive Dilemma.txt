How do they wake up?
With a whisper, a scream or an inner pain?
Buried for so long in the holes of my mind
Access deniedâ¦

Myself and I
Destined to make each other miserable
Itâs Me or Meâ¦ An endless circleâ¦
Where I endâ¦ I beginâ¦

Try to recall my oldest memory
Where am I?
Time is a river

Try to recall my oldest memory
Time is a river
So bear my soul
Where am I?

Myself and I
Destined to make each other miserable
Itâs Me or Meâ¦ An endless circleâ¦
Where I endâ¦ I beginâ¦
