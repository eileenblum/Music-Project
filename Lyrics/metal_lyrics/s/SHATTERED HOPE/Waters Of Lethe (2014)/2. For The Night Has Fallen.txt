There are 1000 ways to get lost
â¦ In your own mind
There are even more
â¦ To find your way back

But not this night
Need is stronger than will

Lost in the city lights
A cold November night

Crave on your knees
Tomorrow youâll be dust

Fear is poison
So contagiousâ¦
Through my eyes
Your bodyâ¦ dismembered

Dim like a winterâs dawn
Pale like the day you were born

The blood should be
â¦ In her body
But whyâ¦
Is it all over me?

Crave on my knees
Tomorrow Iâll be gone

Fear is poison
So contagiousâ¦
Inside my head
Enormous void floats

âGhosts looking for you
In the dark
You canât see us
Butâ¦ We can (see you)

To be chased
By your mistakes
Is a fateâ¦
Worse than death

The hunter of your past
Is here for you again
Donât botherâ¦
Thereâs no escape
Your innocence is lost
Forever in this momentâ

There 1000 ways for you
To die in my mind
Even if youâre dead
I will still kill you

But not this night
Sanity is stronger than need

Fear is poison
So contagiousâ¦
Be brave before
This Gloom stands still

Donât mourn for me Brother
For I have sinned to Deathâ¦
