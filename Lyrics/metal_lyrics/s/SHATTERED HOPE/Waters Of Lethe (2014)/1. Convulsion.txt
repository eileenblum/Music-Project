This door wonât let me out
This bed wonât keep me warm
Untie my bonds and youâll see
Iâm in controlâ¦

Every breath is dying
Can you hear me now?
What I need is unknown to me
And no more thisâ¦

Pain, dear friend from the past
So glad youâre here again
Some people are used to you
Some others might fall
Take a look around you
Before the final call
Alibi is for the weak
Gather up your strength
Puerile ignorance is mirrored
In your childhood fears
Puerile ignorance is mirrored
In the deepest of your sins

No one defines me
The thorn in your side
It has all begun
Convulsions eat your sanity
No one defines you
The thorn in my side
It has all begun
Convulsions break my mind

All the bridges I built
Now they fall to the ground
Each one is my scattered soul
The days I spent to find you

When my eyes blink
World is changing beneath my feet
With a sound, so quiet
â¦As a single stone

Look at me and realize
How this life counts
When all the rest are gone

Thereâs no worst Death
Than the Death of Hope
Do you see God? Is it only yourself?
