Iâm a parasite
I live from your pain
When I come back
You become less
Every time I return
You becomeâ¦ shade of yourself

People who live their lives
Without meaning
Like a puzzle
With a missing piece

Iâm the leech
On your body

To stab a friend in the back
A road unknown in your map
Many nights when sleep was absent
I found a strange truth:
âThereâs no friend to be stabbed
And the road isâ¦ clear now!â
Iâm the leech
On your body
A perfect haven
For this hideous existence
Iâm a parasite
I live for your pain

Everyone has its path to walk
Sometimes they entwine
But when I come back
You become lessâ¦
