Truth, such a burden
Nevertheless we have to carry it
The die is cast
A storm is on its way

Abandoned in time
Swallowed by this vortex
â¦ Of lies and deceit
Frailty in every move
Heavier are the deeds
Engraved in our hearts

Exhale the dirty smoke
Stuck in your jaded lungs
The book of life
Filled with empty words
But we can still read it!

Defy the vows
Bond you to the other side
Everyone has its path to walk
Sometimes they entwine
And we flow together like waterâ¦

The secret revealed
Redemption lost
Truth splinters everything
If I go first
Iâll wait for you there
On the other sideâ¦
â¦ Of the dark waters

Youâve always beenâ¦
The sun in my days
The torch through the nights
The nerves in my brain
Nebula of my skies
The fire in my life
And this is forever!
