I've lived so long before i died 
I would not like to be reborn again 
I'm the end from the begining 
Tired to get passing through 

The complains have not been in vain 
I've already begun to fight 

Life after life feeling alone 
Don't even hear the whispers 

I'm tired to ride 
I can't even live 
Something disturbs me 

It's time to leave this again 

Wake up in into the dark 
And hear the screaming of the lambs 
Yelling for mercy of their souls 
Back to the truth and dead again.
