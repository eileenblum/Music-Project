Driving through chaos
We learn to absorb
The energy around us
Is what they feel as we burn

Came from the unknown
Out of the dark
Abducted and thrown
Can you feel it inside?

Deliver us
From our creator
Hear them,
Prayers of deceit
Deliver us
To our damnation
All those moments
Will be lost in chaos

We have been forgotten
Not only by demons
But your gods
A void senses my bones

It's this vastness
Of his creation
This sense of filth
Is the final breath
