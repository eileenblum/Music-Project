Seeker of souls
Addicted to emotions
Created against the light
Night's roam and beyond

But you've seen us
Shadows all twisted and burned
And youâve dreamed it
Everything will be burnt

Spoken in a thousand tongues
Ghouls who mock your cross
Fear disempowers from abuses
Shadows absorb to feed their lord

Into a pitch black world
Molded and shaped
Feeded by the hills of dismay

Creata sum pascere
Immundus erit vester
