Hang on to a dream
Wrong perception of the mind
I can't nearly see
The day since a long time

Slow death is the price
Forsaken in fire
Embrace the end
My bells toll

Hang on
To a death knell

The gap left
By the divinity
Instincts in the ecstasy
Of death and suffering

Cold soil under my feet
I lost the will to live
My absolute reality faded
Vibrations cut up my skin
