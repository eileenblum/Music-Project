Fire in the sky, blinded through time
Unexpected flesh burning, until bones collide

Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, of the sea
For the angels are come down to you

Paralytic trapped by the light
The relentless ascension
In the sight of an eye
Lawless will be revealed

Sulfur and darkness surround me as whole
Listening to thy laments approach

I drag the sorrow
To my left path soul
I drag the sorrow
To the unknown

I drag the sorrow
To my left path soul
I drag the sorrow
To the unknown

Blinded into the void, above and below
Abomination aeons and beyond

Secrets into our blood
Drawing has been made
Lights are at any places
The relentless ascension has arrived.
