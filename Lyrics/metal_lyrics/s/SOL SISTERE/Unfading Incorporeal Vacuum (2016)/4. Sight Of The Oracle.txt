Constant suffering is imminent
The rope is set for each

Doom to a lost divinity
Foreign is the elite

The eyes of misery
Focus directly through me

Introspection through the hermetism
The sight of the oracle
Has been harvested on me

Thought control as discipline
Their bodies remain brisk

Through them in orden to kill
Pursue it attentively

Introspection through the hermetism
The sight of the oracle
Has been harvested on me

The target is waiting to succumb

Doom to a lost divinity
Foreign is the elite

The eyes of misery
Focus directly through me
