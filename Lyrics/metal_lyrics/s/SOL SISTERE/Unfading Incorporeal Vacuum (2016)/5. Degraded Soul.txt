Unequivocal symptom
The weight of life
Attached to me
The smell of death
Fills the emptiness

I used to have a silence manifestation
Directly outwards explodes your mind
When you reset your reality
Mind destruction is the authority

Physical surroundings no longer exist
Abandoned like a rotting Christ
Decay of life, its only aim
