What am I doing here?
My head is filled with fear
My heart is pounding fast
Twisting and dying fast

[Pre Chorus]
Was it a dream or was it real?
The blood on my hands, so hard to conceal

[Chorus]
Unsure of it all, don't know what I feel
This knife in my hand, the cold taste of steel

[Solo- Cooper]

The waves of emotion
They sweep over me
So hard to control
My dark tendencies

[Chorus]
[Solo- Dow/Cooper/Dow/Cooper/Dow]
[Chorus]
