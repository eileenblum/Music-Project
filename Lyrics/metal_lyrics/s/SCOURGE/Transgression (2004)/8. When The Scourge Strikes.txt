Our armies are advancing
Invading foreign shore
Killing all on first sight
Slicing to the core

Crossing every boundary
We're tearing up the road
Nowhere you can hide
This you ought to know

[Chorus]
When the scourge strikes
When the scourge strikes

Hunting for your blood
Searching one and all
You try to stop the carnage
But we will never fall

Those who oppose us
Will die by our hands
There's no mercy for you
Take your final stand

[Chorus]
[Solo- Dow/Cooper]

Our armies are advancing
Invading foreign shore
Killing all on first sight
Slicing to the core

Those who oppose us
Will die by our hands
There's no mercy for you
Take your final stand

[Chorus]
