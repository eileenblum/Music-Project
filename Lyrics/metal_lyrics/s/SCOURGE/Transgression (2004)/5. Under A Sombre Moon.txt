Sun goes down, night fades in
The darkness on horizon
Evil things begin to stir
Your chilling screams pierce the dusk

Dim shadows, endless voids
Gloom descends upon surrounds
Running fast, sweat is cold
I feel a chill on my neck

[Chorus]
Under a sombre moon
Frost forms in the air
Horrid things emerge from black
Eyes glow an unholy red

[Solo- Dow]

Turn around, see nothing
The feeling of the chase remains
Falling down, I pass out
The hours seem to pass like days

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Feel the dark moon rising
Behold it has begun
Feel the dark moon rising
Horrors of the night will strike

I feel so hypnotized
A feeling of helplessness
Mind is blank, hands are tied
I wonder when I will die
