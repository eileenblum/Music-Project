Ask the dusk settles in
My senses become alert
From a mere man
To a beast I convert

Honing the raw instincts
That are buried deep within
Poised and ready to roar
"Let the hunt begin"

[Solo- Cooper]

On the prowl I seek my victim
Oblivious to him
The thrill of the chase
And now I'm closing in

The feeding frenzy has begun
I have to seek another's blood
Roaming the streets in the dead of night
No one escapes my all seeing eye

[Pre Chorus]
Hunt - kill - prey
Live to fight another day
Stalk - find - feed
I can't deny my primal needs

[Chorus]
The moon is high
My victims rise
On this night
You won't survive

[Chorus]
[Solo- Cooper]
[Chorus]
