I'm physically conscious, yet mentally dead
Wires and circuits, twist within
Walking 'round in a hollow shell
Awake but not really there
Walking 'round in this hollow shell
Living's my cross to bare

Set number of tasks, nothing more
Never changing, forever constant

Condemned upon a straight path
Vicious cycle deeply engrained
Condemned upon this straight path
As I go fucking insane

[Chorus]
Mechanized - Seeming Endless
Standardized - The Levelling Out

My shallow existence, within this box
Trapped in a maze with no escape

Just a robot in society
A puppet on a string
Another Robot in society
Told where to fit in

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Shut tight, locked down, breakable, I'm bound

[Solo- Dow/Cooper/Cooper]

I want to get out of this hell
Just have to find a better way
How long I've been here
No one can tell me
I have to end this
I want to break free

[Chorus]
