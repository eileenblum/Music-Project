Propaganda warfare, they pump you full of lies
You thought that the Nazis died in 1945
Your mind is under guard, by those who've seen the light
Those who want their freedom, you have to stand and fight

[Pre Chorus]
I see the snake not give but take
The serpents bite takes away what's right

[Chorus]
What's the truth?
Where's the proof?
To make me believe
You have to deceive

[Solo- Cooper]

Impose your rules upon us and you will pay the price
You take away our freedom because you know it right
Divinity and censorship all rolled into one
When you meet your maker, my kingom will be done

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo- Cooper/Dow]
[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus]
