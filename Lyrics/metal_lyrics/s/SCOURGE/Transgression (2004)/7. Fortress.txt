Sentenced for life, pleas not heard
Guilty is the verdict you have earned
Thrown to lions, no way out
No one hears you scream and shout

Twisted souls in a morbid place
Four bloodied walls of disgrace
Pray to a god, your maker's met
Within a shelf, your life is kept

[Chorus]
Fortress of death - there's no escape
Fortress of death - your life it will take
Fortress of death - a dead end you face
Fortress of death - you'll never leave this place

Unholy terror screams echo around
In this pit no solace found
Chained to floor, starved of light
To stay alive you'll have to fight

[Chorus]

Deeper and deeper I fall into this hole
I try to get up but I don't know
Maybe I do deserve all of this
Maybe I'm just coming to grips
Am I so innocent after all?
Do I simply obey their call?
No, I will defy!

I'm beaten down by my oppressors
Made to make false confessions
Made to bow down to their rule
But I see the light, I'm no fool
Biding my time, counting the days
Wait for the moment when the minions betray
Vengeance shall be mine

[Solo- Dow/Cooper]

What can you do? Is there no way?
Just try to live though the day
There is no justice, there is no hope
You're here forever, can you cope?

[Chorus]

Fortress of death
Fortress of death
Fortress of death
Fortress of death
