Can't you see
You create your own destiny
Everything is in your command
As soon as you realize that you're hypnotized
The power in you will rise
And force the spell to an end
Age of crawling
We're gonna forget all about it
While the kings are falling
Free men will stand up and shout
Reach for the freedom
And you will find yourself
Livin' in a free world

Can you hear
Voices that whisper from above
United as one we will grow
It's time to realize
That we're not so different at all
Under the same sky, confused and small
Times of changes
Has already begun
While the queens are weeping
We're watching the new sun rise
Reach for the freedom
And we will find ourselves
Livin' in a free world

Not so cold
Ill and scarred, overburden and old
Drowning in depths of our fears
Sooner or later it will disappear

I call to stop this endless war
Torture, suffering nevermore
Give the chance to those unborn
To inhale the scent of freedom
