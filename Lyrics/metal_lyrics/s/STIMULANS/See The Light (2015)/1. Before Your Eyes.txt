Birth of the dark cloud
Forced you down on your knees
All the beauty, now itâs gone.

Squealing and shaking
Deep down in the lake of tears
It's hard to find the way out
When you give in to your fears.

Don't say it's over
Never lay down and die
With the colors and the lights
Right there before your eyes.

To live is to bleed
Yeah, life is pain
But to die is not to heal

Through the valley of shadows
Through mud and icy rain
Try to find the way
For your broken wings to fly again

Don't say it's over
Don't you lay down and die
With all the colors, all the light
Right there before your eyes.
