See that curtain off shadows
Twisting veil, that makes you crawl

Haunts you 'til you go insane
Sharp teeth of the dark force cut
And eat your brain

Becoming a slave of the veil
Waiting that obscure voice
Tormentress that gives you all
Is your drug of choice

No hope - you're becoming a stranger
Blinded - to yourself you're the danger

Giving your body and your soul
Weak mind lets that dark force take control

Becoming a slave of the veil
Waiting that obscure voice
Tormentress will give you all
That's your drug of choice

Giving your body and your soul
So weak, by the hand of the nameless
You will fall

Becoming a slave of the veil
Waiting that obscure voice
Tormentress that gives you all
Is your drug of choice
