Here comes the pain
Calling out the poison tongue
Coming out, the stunning sound
Turning seas to desert ground

Swallow jar of sore
Spit on truth forever gone
Only the end breaks the chains
Empty soul â bleeding heart
Could never find the way in the dark

After all what do you find in me?
After all what do you find still in me?
In my heart made of steel
In my heavy heart

Decision to deny
The gaze of shallow eyes
Abandon the sinking sail
No more living in these lies

Know that I don't care
You're just a thing that I wear
I'm free to say the truth
'Cause of you time is lost
I won't lose another breath, another word

After all what do you find in me?
After all what do you find still in me?
In my heart made of steel
In my heavy heart
