Out there in the distance
Across the lifeless sea
Living on old wooden ship named by god
'Destiny'

I cannot remember
Where I was born
It does not matter to me
'cause I'm now where I belong

Sailing on
Across never-ending seas
Breaking through heavy storm
Wind whip the sail, giving me harmony

Out there where the waves reign
Where love cannot breed
I'm not asking for salvation
There's nothing that I need

There is no reason
I threw it away
Just holding on to the helm
And the spirit leads my way

Sailing on
Across never-ending seas
Breaking through every storm
Wind whip the sail, giving me harmony

Sailing on
Fighting the raging sea
Piercing through eye of the storm
Wind tearing the sails, it's my destiny
