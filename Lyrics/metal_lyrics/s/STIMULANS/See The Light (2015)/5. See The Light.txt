Blind and divided
We crawl into the dark, ignorant so far
Will we ever see the light?
(will we ever see?)

It's time to choose between fear and love
To rise above misery
(or fall into the darkest sea)

Children of the night
Light up your flame
And you will see
The truth that lies
In the depths of your insanity

All those memories, false promises
Illusions steeped in lies
Is it hard to let it go
Is it worth dying for

When your life is about to begin
Chances to win beauty within
(far from sin)

Children of the night
Light up your flame
And you will see
The truth that lies
In the depths of your insanity

Before we heal ourselves
We have to feel the pain
Inside depravity
Then we will fly
Into the mist of eternity
