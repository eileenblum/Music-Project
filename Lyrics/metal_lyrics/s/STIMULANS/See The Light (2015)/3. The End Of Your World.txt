Your world is melting like ice
Brought close to fire
Nothing for you to do but cry
Tears will ease your mind
But won't send you back through the time

You feel the pain
Clearly, it's growing stronger
You could've stopped this reign of fire
While you were pleasing
All of your desires.

I hear your deafening scream
You're tied to this burning land
With no one to call
It's the end of your world

Repent, you sinner â confess
Pay the price
Pay with your flesh and with your blood.
Pain will reside in your soul
Learn the rules of your new home!!!

I hear your deafening scream
You're tied to this burning land
There's no one to call

Dug deep, climbed high
You've made your stand
But now it's time for you to fall
It's the end of your world.
