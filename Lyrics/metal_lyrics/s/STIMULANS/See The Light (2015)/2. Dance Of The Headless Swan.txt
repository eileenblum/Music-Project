In the thick fog
The ill crawl towards it
To find the cure it gives
And hide away from light

It turns into puppet on the strings
On the lake of blood it swims.

The morning after
The bird is still dreaming
About the glamour and gold,
The medals it has won.

If you could just open those eyes
To find that the shine is a the lie.

Dance of the headless swan
Enchanting everyone.

But all the glory,
All that fame and fortune
Slowly fades away
And its heartbeat disappears

Oh, there is no beauty no more
All the shine is gone.

Dance of the headless swan
Enchanting everyone

I'll watch it as it bleeds
To fulfill their own needs.
