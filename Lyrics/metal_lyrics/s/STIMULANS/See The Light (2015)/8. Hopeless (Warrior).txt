Man risen from the ashes
His face was so cold
Wind was getting weaker
World was growing old.

He kept on going, never knowing
What waits in the end
The nature of his kind, leaves all fears behind
Buried under shifting sand.

He walks unarmed, no weapon would help
'Cause what weapon could save him from himself?

Breathing in the agony
He hushes up the sound
Of voices inside his head
And the footsteps on the ground.

He tries to find some meaning
In a world of decay
But faces bleached by oblivion
Slowly fade away

Human lust turned virtue to dust
Sin into an idol of gold
Forsake me not, I'm all that you've got
To have and to hold.
