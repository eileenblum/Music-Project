Taming the beast of light, heavy drinking blurs my sight
As I force it harder dragon's roar soars like thunder

In ajar and tired eyes winding road is twisting and turning
Cold sweat never dries, feel the smell of tire burning

Riding steel dragon makes me high, excessive agressive and barely alive
Riding steel dragon across the sky, free and wild on fire I fly

Losing all control over beast made of steel
Flight leads me to fall as a dream becomes too real

In minds filled with smoke thoughts of reason just awoke
But no memories remain when the pipes shot the flame again

Riding steel dragon makes me high, excessive agressive and barely alive
Riding steel dragon across the sky, free and wild on fire I fly

Losing all control over beast made of steel
Flight leads me to fall as a dream becomes too real

In minds filled with smoke thoughts of reason just awoke
But no memories remain when the pipes shot the flame again

Riding steel dragon makes me high, excessive agressive and barely alive
Riding steel dragon across the sky, free and wild on fire I fly
