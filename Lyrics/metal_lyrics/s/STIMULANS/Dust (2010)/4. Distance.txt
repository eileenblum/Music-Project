Living alone, keeping the distance, far away from happiness and pain
Reaching for a light in the twilight, playing some strange kind of game

When they tell you what you gotta do, when they tell you who you gotta be...
Living on the distance

If they tell you things you don't wanna hear try to close your eyes and embrace your fear
Time is passing and you will never know how to stop it or to make it slow

When they tell you what you gotta do, when they tell you who you gotta be...
Living on the distance
