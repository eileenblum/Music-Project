I feel the struggle between two souls who used to be as one before and I know it's true
Our wounds turn into gaping holes, giving us good reason to raise new walls between me and you

No matter what you do I'll never come back to you

Being myself is all I can be, there's no chance to change me
You said i've cost you too much pain, but your words only in this song remain

Now is not the time to dig through the past, slow down - you're moving too fast, always rushing it all
Live your own life and i'll live mine, the time has come to draw the line, don't you beg, don't you crawl

No matter what you do I'll never come back to you

Being myself is all I can be, there's no chance to change me
You said i've cost you too much pain, but your words only in this song remain

No matter what you do I'll never come back to you

Being myself is all I can be, there's no chance to change me
You said i've cost you too much pain, but your words only in this song remain
