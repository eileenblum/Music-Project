I stood on the pile of broken dreams looking calmly at my life
Try to leave the past behind, tired eyes become blind, no reason to feel the pride

Old mistakes make me realize I was wild
Just a fool trying to be wise, playing like a child.

Half of life spent - oh what a waste, there's so many things I wanna taste
That's why I'm running cause I want it all, I am free now - without control.

In this madness I'll find my role, I hear the wilderness' call
I'm cutting old roots, they dry and they die, I have no reason to cry

Old mistakes make me realize I was wild
Just a fool trying to be wise, playing like a child.

Half of life spent - oh what a waste, there's so many things I wanna taste
That's why I'm running cause I want it all, I am free now - without control.
