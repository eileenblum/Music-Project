I dream about the land without a name, rainfall cleans all the pain
I'm free to glance away without the shame, to live and die in vain

And what I have found no words can tell about
Distant blurry pictures, mystic songs without sound
No words can tell about...

I scream aloud and proud without reply, dream on, it feels the same
And I live that dream again, I wonder why, fearless but losing the game

And what I have found no words can tell about
Distant blurry pictures, mystic songs without soundâ¦
And was it just mine, that land of many sounds
Sight that left me speechless, with no words to say out loud
No words can tell aboutâ¦.

And what I have found no words can tell about
Distant blurry pictures, mystic songs without soundâ¦
And was it just mine, that land of many sounds
Sight that left me speechless, with no words to say out loud
