I hear my voice lost in the mist of your game played just by fools eager to die in my name
Now my sense made of steel drinks from the wells of their sacrifice...

I try to escape to the light of new dawn and find my faith in a distant land free of sorrow
I will find my own way, above the altars rise and shout unspoken words to say...

I must find meaning, feels like i'm winning, the taste of new life makes me high
My body is shaking, my mind is awaking, sleep has no meaning if dream is a lie
It's lost in sacrifice...

Time passes slow, but the light has been shown, it must mean that my path isn't wrong
Waiting for today to pass, trying to take strenght from a new day, unspoken words to say...

I must find meaning, feels like i'm winning, the taste of new life makes me high
My body is shaking, my mind is awaking, sleep has no meaning if dream is a lie
It's lost in sacrifice...

My sacrifice....
