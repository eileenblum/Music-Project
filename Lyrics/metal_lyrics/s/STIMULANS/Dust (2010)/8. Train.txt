Boarding onto train, running from another day
Heavy wagon's our home and we're on our way

First or second class, we don't really care
We just rest our souls, finding our justice there
Still we search for better place to bury the bones
There's nothing left to gain, feels like our life is a train...

While rusty life's dreams stray from the rails
We try to hold on to stay on their trail

Wheels are moving on, sights stay the same
Our escape from time ends in a burning flame
No more wandering, seems we've found our way
Chance to break free from pain, feels like our life is a train...

Lights are fading and I have no one to hold
Nearing end really scares me - why is it so cold

Old memories are just passing by
In my dim, scarred eyes, unprepared for new cries
Still I search for better place to bury the bones
There's nothing left to gain, feels like my life is a train...
