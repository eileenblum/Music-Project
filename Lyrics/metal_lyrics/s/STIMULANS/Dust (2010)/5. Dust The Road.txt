There are some things I didn't choose, fate threw them my way
Making life even harder, giving me a role to play

I welcome the hard times, it's not half of what I can take
I spread my wings over it all and another smile I fake

I've got my head on, always glowing open eyes
And these hands to work it out
I've got my pants on and these boots to dust the road
Never needing fuel to load

It was hard to foresee, this road will have so many turns
I try not to lose myself in this world that slowly burns

So I take another step, a new way opens for me
It's not easiest to take but it gives me liberty

I've got my head on, always glowing open eyes
And these hands to work it out
I've got my pants on and these boots to dust the road
Never needing fuel to load
Never crawl!
Just stand tall...

I've got my head on, always glowing open eyes
And these hands to work it out
I've got my pants on and these boots to dust the road
Never needing fuel to load

Never crawl, just stand tall
Never needing fuel to load
