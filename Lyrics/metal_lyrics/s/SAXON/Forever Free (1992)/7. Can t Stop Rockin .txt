I was laid around bored to tears watching flowers grow
I got my car and drove to town tried to find a show
Cruised around for an hour or two, hunted high and low
I had to find some rock 'n' roll to make my system go

'Cos I can't, I can't stop rockin' (*)
Let me hear that music one more time
'Cos I can't, I can't stop rockin'

I found a club with a neon sign on the sleazy side of town
A battered jukebox on the wall was the only source of sound
A drunken sailor from a russian whaler was my only drinking mate
Then through the door smashed a hundred more, said yeah let's celebrate

[Repeat *]

The party burst straight out through the doors out onto the street
People came from miles around dancing to the beat
From across the street came a real smart suit, said hey I'm gonna sue
But there ain't no sucker with a long legged hooker, gonna tell me what to do

[Repeat *]
