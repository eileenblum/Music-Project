Take me where the eagles fly
Let me drive along the open road
Break away the chains that bind you
Now you're free to make it your own
Feel the engines burning hot
Pounding out the sound
A free man proud

Forever free, riding with the wind in your hair (*)
Forever free, forever free

Take me where the four winds blow
Let me see the magic in your eyes
Just take the shackles from your soul
Imagination soaring to the skies
Journey to the rainbow's end
Searching for the freedom in your heart

[Repeat *]

Take me to the open plains
Let me drive along the desert road
Break away the chains that blind you
Now you're free to make it on your own
Feel the engines burning hot
Pounding out the sound
A free man proud

[Repeat *]
