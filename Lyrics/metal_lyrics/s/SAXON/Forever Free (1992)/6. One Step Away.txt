Just another kid in the firing line
Up against the wall running out of time
Makes no difference what you do
That poisons taking hold of you

No warning, there's danger (*)
This pain is no stranger
You're falling
I hear you calling
Desperation is just one step away

Just another girl with the crying eyes
Up against the odds running out of lies
Makes no difference where she goes
That poison drags her down below

[Repeat *]

Just another day like the one before
Living on the streets running from the law
Makes no difference what you said
That poison's got you in it's web

[Repeat *]
