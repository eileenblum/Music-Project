Get on top, keep it up (*)
Don't let them ever grind you down

Up down, turn around, give a little more
Inside, outside, knocking on my door
I don't need no preacher man telling me what to do
All I want is to live my life, the rest is up to you

[Repeat *]

Prime time, my time, take it on the run
Place your bets, get set, have yourself some fun
Look into my crystal ball, I'll tell you what's in store
Another rich man getting fat, taking from the poor

[Repeat *]

Come on down, hang around, feel like number one
Pump and grind, stand in line, the show has just begun
Don't be fooled by what you see, nothing's ever free
Everyone must pay the price, they're just like you and me

[Repeat *]
