I don't want you to be my slave
I don't want you to work all day
I don't want you to be sad and blue
'Cos I just wanna make love to you

I don't want you to drive my car
I don't want you to go too far
I don't want you to be true
'Cos I just wanna make love to you

I can tell by the way that you switch and walk
I can tell by the way that you treat your man
I can't love you baby it's a crying shame

I don't want you to be true
I don't want you to be blue
I don't want you to make no sacrifice
I just wanna make love to you
