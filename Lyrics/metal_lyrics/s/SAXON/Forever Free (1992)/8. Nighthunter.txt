Creeping after midnight, shadows on the wall
Something in the darkness, hear the footsteps fall
Faces at the window, creatures of the night
Seeking out a victim, somewhere out of sight

Coming out of nowhere, preying on our fear (*)
If you want to stay alive, then keep away from here
Midnight, creeping, shadows, nighthunter

Mist across the forest, the baying of the pack
Hunters in the twilight, never turn their back
When the full moon rises, the chill is in the air
Keep your children safe tonight, the wolf has left his lair

[Repeat *]
