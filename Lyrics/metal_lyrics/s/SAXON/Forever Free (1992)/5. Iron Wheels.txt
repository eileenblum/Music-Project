My father used to work the seam far below the ground
Digging for the coal to melt the steel
But now he lies a twisted man one foot in the grave
Just like the iron wheels that took him down

Just like the iron wheels that took him down

He used to be the fisherman that sailed the mighty sea
Searching for the harvest from the deep
But now the fleets are rusting hulks anchored at the quay
Just like the iron wheels that took him down

Just like the iron wheels that took him down

He used to be the farming man standing tall and proud
Working on the land to sow the seed
But now the buildings stand in shame rotting on the land
Just like the iron wheels that took him down

Just like the iron wheels that took him down
