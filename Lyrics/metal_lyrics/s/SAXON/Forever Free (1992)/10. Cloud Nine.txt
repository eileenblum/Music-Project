People say we're crazy but where's their sense of fun
Take it to the limit, fly into the sun
I'm doing fine
Up on cloud nine
Flying into battle, target on the ground
Screaming out of nowhere, at twice the speed of sound
I'm doing fine
Up on cloud nine

Now gather round you sinners, listen to my song (*)
About the time we raised some hell down in Babylon
I'm a warrior from the skies and you're about to die
So put your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye
I'm doing fine
Up on cloud nine

Taste the danger out there supersonic run
Loving every minute, let the hostiles come
I'm doing fine
Up on cloud nine
Racing through the canyons, show no signs of fear
Static on the airwaves, forget the landing gear
I'm doing fine
Up on cloud nine

[Repeat *]

Sonic boom, there ain't no room up here in the sky
So take your aim, I feel no pain, I'm never gonna die

[Repeat *]
