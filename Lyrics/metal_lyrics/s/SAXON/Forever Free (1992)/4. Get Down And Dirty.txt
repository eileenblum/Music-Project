Working in a drug store
Slaving on it nine to five
Waiting for the weekend
That's when she comes alive

You've got me coming like a freight train (*)
You took my heart away
Now I'm hooked on you
You got to get down
Get down and dirty
You got to get down
Get down and dirty

Walking down the sidewalk
Making all the schoolboys stare
Red skirt and long legs
And looking like she don't even care

[Repeat *]
