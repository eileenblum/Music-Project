Let me tell you what you need
YouÂ´ve gotta set your spirit free
Just hear the power anÂ´ feel the beat
Shout out loud and stamp your feet
Cut me loose but donÂ´t let go
I gotta have more rock and roll
I canÂ´t live I canÂ´t breathe
You gotta give me what I need
CanÂ´t go on canÂ´t survive
I gotta rock to stay alive stay alive
Play it loud anÂ´ turn me on
Give it to me all night long
Loud and proud thatÂ´s what I like
YouÂ´ve gotta get the feeling right
DonÂ´t stop me now itÂ´s in my soul
I gotta rock and canÂ´t say no
I canÂ´t live I canÂ´t breathe
You gotta give me what I need
CanÂ´t go on canÂ´t survive
I gotta rock to stay alive
Stay alive stay alive
I canÂ´t live I canÂ´t breathe
You gotta give me what I need
CanÂ´t go on canÂ´t survive
I gotta rock to stay alive
IÂ´ve paid my dues IÂ´ve been around
IÂ´ve had my share of ups and downs
IÂ´ll never stop itÂ´s in my blood
IÂ´ve got to rock it feels so good
CanÂ´t stop me now itÂ´s in my soul
IÂ´ve gotta play more rock and roll
I canÂ´t live I canÂ´t breathe
You gotta give me what I need
CanÂ´t go on canÂ´t survive
I gotta rock to stay alive
I canÂ´t live I canÂ´t breathe
You gotta give me what I need
CanÂ´t go on canÂ´t survive
I gotta rock to stay alive stay alive
I canÂ´t live I canÂ´t breathe
I gotta rock to stay alive
