Where were you when the red star fell
Did you hear the tolling of the bell
A million people on the streets
They march as one they march for peace
BreakinÂ´ free from the iron fist
The price you pay a deadly risk
Live no more in fear and shame
The hammerÂ´s gone release from blame
The tanks have left the walls torn down
The sound of silence all around
Hear no more the screams of pain
Freedom now the beast is slain
The beast is slain
Did you see the red star falling
Where were you when the red flag burned
The ashes gone the tables turned
One by one the cracks appeared
The overlord no longer feared
The children sing they dance once more
On the streets no signs of war
The strangle hold that held you tight
Broken now no will to fight
The guards have gone the wire torn down
The sound of silence all around
Hear no more the screams of pain
Freedom now the beast is slain
The beast is slain
Did you see the red star falling
Falling down falling down falling down
They marched as one
To see the red star falling
They paid their price
The price for liberty
Did you see the red star falling
Where were you when the red star died
Did you raise your voices to the sky
Forgotten now the fear and pain
Or does your memory still remain
The people held in bonds of steel
It took so long to break the seal
After all thatÂ´s said and done
A million people canÂ´t be wrong
The tanks have gone the walls torn down
The sound of silence all around
Hear no more the screams of pain
Freedom now the beast is slain
The beast is slain
Did you see the red star falling
The beast is slain
They marched as one
To see the red star falling
The beast is slain
They paid their price
The price for liberty
Did you see the red star falling
Falling down falling down falling down
Falling down falling down
