Scream into danger thatÂ´s just what I like
Pushing it harder the feeling is right
Faster and faster donÂ´t loose your grip
Live for the moment thereÂ´s nothing like this
I need the rush  canÂ´t get enough
I got the need for speed
I got the need for speed
Out to the limit  IÂ´m here for the ride
DonÂ´t try to stop me just open it wide
Wind back the throttle your foot to the floor
Up to the red line give it some more
I need the rush  canÂ´t get enough
I got the need for speed
I got the need for speed
Scream into danger thatÂ´s just what I like
Pushing it harder the feeling is right
Faster and faster donÂ´t loose your grip
Live for the moment thereÂ´s nothing like this
I need the rush  canÂ´t get enough
I got the need for speed
I got the need for speed
I got the need for speed
I got the need for speed
I got the need for speed
I got the need for speed
