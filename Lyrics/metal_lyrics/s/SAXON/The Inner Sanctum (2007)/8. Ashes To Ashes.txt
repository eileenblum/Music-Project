WeÂ´ll never surrender
Or give up the fight
WeÂ´ll take what weÂ´re given
AnÂ´ never lose sight
WeÂ´ve all been to the edge and back
WeÂ´re leavinÂ´ no one behind
Ashes to ashes backs to the wall
Brother to brother together we fall
Ashes to ashes never give in
Brother to brother united we win
WeÂ´re shoulder to shoulder
WeÂ´ll never give ground
WeÂ´re stronger than ever
And forever weÂ´re bound
WeÂ´ll make a stand and give it all
When your backÂ´s to the wall
Ashes to ashes backs to the wall
Brother to brother together we fall
Ashes to ashes never give in
Brother to brother united we win
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
WeÂ´ll never surrender
Or give up the fight
WeÂ´ll take what weÂ´re given
AnÂ´ never lose sight
WeÂ´ve all been to the edge and back
WeÂ´re leavinÂ´ no one behind
Ashes to ashes backs to the wall
Brother to brother together we fall
Ashes to ashes never give in
Brother to brother united we win
Ashes to ashes backs to the wall
Brother to brother together we fall
Ashes to ashes never give in
Brother to brother united we win
Ashes to ashes backs to the wall
Brother to brother together we fall
Ashes to ashes never give in
Brother to brother united we win
