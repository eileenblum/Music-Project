Stoke the fire feel the heat
Your chance to burn out on the streets
Smash and grab on the run
Play the game with a loaded gun
The little bird has left his nest
He feeds no more on motherÂ´s breast
On your own you make the choice
Listen to your inner voice
If I was you and you were me
Would you live your life differently
If I was you and you were me
Make your mark use the knife
YouÂ´re following your own advice
What you sow is what you reap
You canÂ´t stop now youÂ´re in too deep
You started life as something new
Innocent until you grew
On your own you make the choice
Listen to your inner voice
If I was you and you were me
Would you live your life differently
If I was you and you were me
If I was you and you were me
Would you live your life differently
If I was you and you were me
Would you live your life differently
If I was you and you were me
Would you live your life differently
If I was you and you were me
Would you live your life differently
If I was you if I was you
If I was you if I was you
