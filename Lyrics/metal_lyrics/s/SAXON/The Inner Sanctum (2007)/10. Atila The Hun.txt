ThereÂ´s something cominÂ´ from the east
Hear the thunder of the beast
Evil shadow Â´cross the sun
A million voices rise as one
Atila the Hun Atila the Hun
Look into the jaws of death
Can you feel the devilÂ´s breath
ThereÂ´s nowhere left for you to run
The scourge of God he soon will come
Atila the Hun Atila the Hun
From the towers of Babylon
To the deserts of the sun
In temples of mighty Rome
To the land of the earth and the stone
The only word that you will hear
The name that brings you panic and fear
Just when you think the killingÂ´s done
A million voices rise as one
Atila the Hun Atila the Hun
Yeah yeah ah yeah ah ah
ThereÂ´s something cominÂ´ from the east
Hear the thunder of the beast
Evil shadow Â´cross the sun
A million voices rise as one
Can you hear them cominÂ´ near
You cannot move youÂ´re paralised with fear
All they bring is death and pain
The life you had will not remain
A mighty empire rising from the east
Will you send an army to defeat
The mounted warriorÂ´s arrows fall like rain
The conquerorÂ´s armies ride across the plain
Atila the Hun Atila the Hun
Ah Atila the Hun
Atila the Hun Atila the Hun
