I was goinÂ´ nowhere
Stuck in this place
No oneÂ´s really movinÂ´
I canÂ´t stand the place
I look to left of me
I look to the right
ThereÂ´s nothing here around me
No exit in sight
I was goinÂ´ nowhere nowhere fast
SomeoneÂ´s gotta help me
IÂ´m goinÂ´ nowhere fast
Chaos on the highway
IÂ´m in a parking lot
I canÂ´t see the problem
IÂ´m sitting here and rot
They blocked to the front of me
They blocked to the rear
IÂ´ve got a hundred things to do
Instead of sittinÂ´ right here
I was goinÂ´ nowhere nowhere fast
SomeoneÂ´s gotta help me
IÂ´m goinÂ´ nowhere fast
IÂ´m goinÂ´ nowhere fast
No signal on the mobile
I talk to myself
I think IÂ´m goinÂ´ crazy
IÂ´ve gotta get some help
I look to left of me
I look to the right
ThereÂ´s nothing here around me
No exit in sight
I was goinÂ´ nowhere nowhere fast
SomeoneÂ´s gotta help me
IÂ´m goinÂ´ nowhere fast
Yeah I was goinÂ´ nowhere nowhere fast
SomeoneÂ´s gotta help me
IÂ´m goinÂ´ nowhere fast
IÂ´m goinÂ´ nowhere fast
