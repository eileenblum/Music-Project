Tell me now do you wanna see the show
Hard and fast itÂ´s the only way to go
LivinÂ´ life with everything youÂ´ve got
Scream and shout take it to the top
Let me hear you screaming
Screaming in the night
Let me feel your power power power
Let me feel your power power power
Turn it on let the night begin
Shout it out let me hear you sing
On your feet the time has come to act
Come with us weÂ´ll take it to the max
Let me hear you screaming
Screaming in the night
Let me feel your power power power
Let me feel your power power power
Hard and fast do you wanna see the show
Tell me now itÂ´s the only way to go
LivinÂ´ life with everything youÂ´ve got
Scream and shout take it to the top
Let me hear you screaming
Screaming in the night
Let me feel your power power power
Let me feel your power power power
Let me feel your power power power
Let me feel your power power power
Scream it again again again
