Sacred towers standing tall
Built in times of guilt and gold
Ancient knowledge lost in time
Forgotten now in hearts and minds
Holy towers a test of faith
Sacred knowledge
State of grace state of grace
Carved in stone your secrets lie
Of raising temples to the sky
When you built this holy place
Did you take a leap of faith
Holy towers a test of faith
Sacred knowledge
State of grace state of grace
HeavenÂ´s light golden beams
ShininÂ´ through in coloured dreams
Gothic sprires in wood and stone
In tests of time you stand alone
Holy towers a test of faith
Sacred knowledge
State of grace state of grace
State of grace state of grace
Sacred towers standing tall
Built in times of guilt and gold
Ancient knowledge lost in time
Forgotten now in hearts and minds
Holy towers a test of faith
Sacred knowledge
State of grace state of grace
State of grace state of grace
State of grace state of grace
State of grace grace grace
