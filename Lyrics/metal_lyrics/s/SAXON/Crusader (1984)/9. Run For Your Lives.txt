[Byford/Quinn/Oliver/Dawson/Glockler]

Danger, danger, there's something in the air
Faster, faster, be careful, you better beware
I had a dream last night, that I saw you burn
There's someone screaming out, screaming out the words

Run for your lives, they set the place on fire
Run for your lives, the flames are getting higher

Burning, burning, fire in the night
Higher, higher, the flames are shining bright
I've got nowhere to run, I was blinded by the light
There's someone screaming out, screaming in the night

Run for your lives, they set the place on fire
Run for your lives, the flames are getting higher

And they were singing
Alay-oh-oh [Repeat]

Danger, danger, there's something in the air
Faster, faster, be careful, you better beware
I had a dream last night, that I saw you burn
There's someone screaming out, screaming out the words

Run for your lives, they set the place on fire
Run for your lives, the flames are getting higher

Run for your lives, they set the place on fire
Run for your lives, the flames are getting higher

And they were singing
Alay-oh-oh [Repeat to end]
