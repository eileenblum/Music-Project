We were standing at the border
Waiting for the man to come
We didn't have a problem
Till he invented one

He said take it easy, take it slow
No one moves
Till I say so

Running for the border
Down in Mexico

We made it to Chihuahua
With the setting sun
The fans were going crazy
Everyone had fun

He said take it easy, take it slow
We've got all day
We'll make the show

Running for the border
Down in Mexico

We met the Federales
They wouldn't go away
So we gave them lots of money
It was all our fuckin' pay

They said take it easy, take it slow
No one moves
Till I say so

Running for the border
Down in Mexico
