In a desert valley
Near the Rio Grande
Through the sun baked wasteland
Cross the burning sand
On the edge of nowhere
In a hidden place
They were looking for the answer
To the power of the sun

From out of the sky came the burning death
Could anyone foresee
The raging terror coming from above
To erase humanity
In a blinding flash came the fireball
Melting skin and bone
It was a mighty city just blown away
Like dust before a storm

There is no city
There are no people
There's only shadows on the wall
Where is the city
Where are the people
There's only shadows on the wall

Children were playing in Los Alamos
Nuclear fusion critical mass
Start a chain reaction
Build the doomsday toy
Split the tiny atom
Your littly boy

There is no city
There are no people
There's only shadows on the wall
Where is the city
Where are the people
There's only shadows on the wall

It was a clear blue morning
On the fatefull day
Silver wings of destruction
The enola gay
Unleash the awesome power
Release it from it's cage
Opening the doorway
To the nuclear age

There is no city
There are no people
There's only shadows on the wall
Where is the city
Where are the people
There's only shadows on the wall
