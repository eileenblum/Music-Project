In the land of Gorron
Far across the Sea
We'll journey there upon the wings of fire
Through the mystic portal
To find the ancient one
The quest to find the dragons lair is mine

Over the mountains
Far 'cross the sea
Follow the legend
Into the dragons lair

The gateway to his kingdom
Lies through the cave of dreams
There before us waits the Dragon King
In halls of golden splendor
Bathed in blood red fire
The mystery of ages waits within

Over the mountains
Far 'cross the sea
Follow the legend
Into the dragons lair

Now we stand before him
The last one of his time
To seek the ancient knowledge of kind
He gives up words of wisdom
In a strange forgotten tongue
Tales of knights and wizards
Lost in time
