We stand here together
Fearless and proud
Raise up your voices
Let the music be loud
There's nothing between us
We stand here as one
The waiting is over, your time has come

Raise up your hands into the light
We stand together 'cause rock is our life
Lift up your voices into the night
We stand together 'cause rock is our life

Rocking together
Into the night
Denim and leather
The feeling is right
Will you be standing
When the music is done
The waiting is over, you  time has come

Raise up your hands into the light
We stand together 'cause rock is our life
Lift up your voices into the night
We stand together 'cause rock is our life

Voices together
This is your song
Here is the spirit
Where we all belong
When we stand together
The bands will play on
