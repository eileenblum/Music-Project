We're on a one way street
Going down the wrong way
We're trying to swim upstream
Against the raging tide
We're on an uphill climb
Right into the headwind
We're standing on thin ice
Fighting for our lives

It's been a hard road
And we're never going back
Till hell freezes over
Till hell freezes over

We're on a crazy ride
Going where the wind blows
We're on the crumbling edge
Waiting for the fall
We're trying to keep it cool
Walking on a tight rope
We're hanging on thin thread
Trying to survive

It's been a hard road
And we're never going back
Till hell freezes over
Till hell freezes over
