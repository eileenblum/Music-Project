When I was a boy I listened to the stories
Of conquerers and heroes of old
Tales of adventure and valiant days
Warrior courageous and bold

Come with me and I'll take you there
Let's open the book of time

Battalions of steel on charging white stallions
Riding out in the dawn
Many will follow and carry the flag
Defenders of faith and the realm

Come with me and I'll take you there
Let's open the book of time

They are calling hear their voices
From the pages of history
Fallen heroes not forgotten
Your deeds of valour, deeds of glory
Deeds of glory

Forged from purest metal, courage made of steel
They stand upon the city walls
Guardians of fait on lonely distant watchtowers
We hear your gallant voices call

Come with me and I'll take you there
Let's open the book of time

They are calling hear their voices
From the pages of history
Fallen heroes not forgotten
Your deeds of valour, deeds of glory
Deeds of glory
