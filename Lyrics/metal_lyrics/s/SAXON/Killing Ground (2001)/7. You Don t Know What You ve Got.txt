Did you take me for a fool I don't think so
Did you think that you could see it in my eyes
You bled me like a stone and left me nothing
But you're the one that's luring with the lies

Up down turn around you're driving me insane
In out there's no doubt you're the loser in the end

You don't know what you've got
You don't know what you've got, till it's gone

Maybe you can think of some invention
To make me see you in a different light
But it wouldn't make a blind bit of difference
Even if you found a second sight

Up down turn around you're driving me insane
In out there's no doubt you're the loser in the end

You don't know what you've got
You don't know what you've got, till it's gone

Give me one good reason why I should believe you
I lost my faith in you and that's no lie
You're heading for a final retribution
I think it's time we said our last goodbye
