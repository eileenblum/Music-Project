[iTunes Bonus Track]You sharp shooter bad loser
You give nothing away
When you took all money it wasn't funny
We didn't get it for free

I'm gonna get back up on my feet
Stop turnin' my life around

You dirty double dealer
Stay out of my life
You dirty double dealer
Get out of my sight

Wheeler and dealer you dream stealer
You got nothin' to say
When I was workin' for nothin' you need stoppin'
You never get away

You're just running around with nothing to do
You're like a dog without a bone

You dirty double dealer
Stay out of my life
You dirty double dealer
Get out of my sight

Now you're runnin' we keep comin'
You're gonna have to pay
When you took the money it wasn't funny
You can't get get blood from a stone

I'm gonna get back up on my feet
An' stop turnin' my life around

You dirty double dealer
Stay out of my life
You dirty double dealer
Get out of my sight
You dirty double dealer
Stay out of my life
You dirty double dealer
Get out of my sight
