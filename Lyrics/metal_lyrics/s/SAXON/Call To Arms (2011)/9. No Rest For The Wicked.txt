Youâre like lambs to the slaughter
Stand in line and wait your turn
I am the destroyer
This thing, you quickly learn
Have no fear and come with me
Enter my reality
I am your hybrid curse
This is my universe

No rest for the wicked
No rest till the work is done
No rest for the wicked
No peace for the chosen ones

Take your chance and start to run
This game of death has just begun
If you die, I still exist
This will be your nemesis

No rest for the wicked
No rest till the work is done
No rest for the wicked
No peace for the chosen ones

Welcome to my sacrifice
Have you come to spend the night?
Have no fear and come with me
Enter my reality
In this place where darkness dwells
You will face your private hells
In my labyrinth of fire
I will build your funeral pyre

No rest for the wicked
No rest till the work is done
No rest for the wicked
No peace for the chosen ones
