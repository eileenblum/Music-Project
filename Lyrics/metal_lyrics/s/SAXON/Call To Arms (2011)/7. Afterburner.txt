I pull the throttle back
Ready to attack
Turn the bow around
Into the wind
Waiting for the rush
Engines on full thrust
We shoot a metal bird
Into the sky

Power screaming, burning
Afterburner, afterburner

Let the eagleâs cry
Launch into the sky
Like birds of prey
They circle high above you
We on the mighty beast
The challenger unleashed
The messengers of death
Will come among you

Power screaming, burning
Afterburner, afterburner
Afterburner, afterburner

I pull the throttle back
Ready to attack
Like birds of prey
They circle high above you
Waiting for the rush
Engines on full thrust
The messengers of death
Will come among you

Power screaming, burning
Afterburner, afterburner
Afterburner, afterburner
Afterburner, afterburner
Afterburner, afterburner
