Iâve been working like a dog
I need some time
Iâve been running around in circles
Out of my mind
Iâve got to pay my bills
And get away
Iâve had about enough
Iâm not gonna stay

Weâre chasing, chasing the bullet
Weâre chasing, chasing the bullet
Chasing the bullet

I need a long vacation
A little bit of therapy
Iâm not gonna get it here
Until Iâm running free
The clock keeps ticking on the wall
Iâm running out of time
Just staring into space
I need a sign

Weâre chasing, chasing the bullet
Weâre chasing, chasing the bullet
Chasing the bullet, bullet

Everybodyâs left
Iâm on my own
Iâm climbing up the walls
I wanna go home
The phoneâs ringing off the hook
The world is on the line
Iâm running around in circles
Out of my mind

Weâre chasing, chasing the bullet
Chasing, chasing the bullet
Weâre chasing, chasing the bullet
Chasing, chasing the bullet
Chasing the bullet
Chasing the bullet
Chasing the bullet
