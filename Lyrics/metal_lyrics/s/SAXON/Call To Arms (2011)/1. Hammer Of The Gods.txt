I see the full moon rising
Across the blackest night
The sails on the horizon
Dragon-ships in flight
Gods are in the heavens
A crack across the sky
Coming with the thunder
Soon youâre gonna die

Gods of war
Stand in fear
Strike you down
With the hammer of the gods
Hammer of the gods

The silhouettes of sunrise
Everything is still
Inside your heart is pounding
Waiting for the kill
Crashing through the silence
Come the Viking hordes
Screaming down with terror
With battle-axe and sword

Gods of war
Straight from Hell
Strike you down
With the hammer of the gods
Hammer of the gods

Prepare to meet the fury
Coming with the dawn
Take your wives and children
Protect them from the storm
Take your stand before them
Fighting to the last
Warriors of the Northland
Soon will cross your path

Gods of war
Stand in fear
Strike you down
With the hammer of the gods
Hammer of the gods
Hammer of the gods
Hammer of the gods
Of the gods
