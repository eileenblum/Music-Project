A telegram came today
Itâs taking me far away
Away from the ones I love
I put my faith in God above

We march toward the sound of distant guns
White fire lighting up the sky
We came to fight and die in fields of blood
Weâll follow the call to arms

I will write you every day
Hope our love wonât fade away
You give me strength to carry on
Until the final day is done

This hell, this hell is where we live and die
We fall, comrades by our side
We pray to make it through another day
To follow the call to arms

If I die, please donât forget me
If I live, I want to live free
We pray to God, these days will end
And bring us back safe to your arms

Iâve saved all your letters
I keep them pressed close to my heart
And they wonât stop a bullet
They just keep me closer to you than apart

We live; we gotta live free
We die; remember me
We pray to make it through another day
To follow the call to arms

Telegram came today
Itâs taking me far away
Away from the ones I love
I put my faith in God above
