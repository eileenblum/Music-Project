It was back in â79
When we rode the mighty tide
It swept across the world
We came together

We never stood alone
Wherever we did roam
This legacy of rock
Would last forever, yeah

[chorus]
Show me your hands
Show me your hands
Raise up your hands
Deliver me

Defenders of the faith
To you this vow we make
When our backâs against the wall
Weâll not surrender

You may be young or old
Thereâs no difference at all
Just raise your glasses high
And sing our song

[chorus]

[chorus]

It was back in â79
When we rode the mighty tide
The music will go on
And never die

[chorus]

[chorus]
