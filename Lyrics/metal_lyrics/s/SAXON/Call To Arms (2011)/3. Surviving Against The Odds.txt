Nobody said it was easy
When your backâs to the wall
We started with nothing
Nothing at all

Just me and you against the world
Thatâs how itâs meant to be
You canât escape the simple truth
That was our destiny
Surviving against the odds
Surviving against the odds

They never thought we could make it
That was never the case
We made a vow to each other
That nothing could break

To stand your ground against the odds
Thatâs what weâve got to do
Together we can face the worst
That life can throw at you
Surviving against the odds
Surviving against the odds

Donât let them drag you down
Keep both feet on the ground

You know we started with nothing
With our backs to the wall
We never said it was easy
Weâve got nothing at all

Just you and me against the world
Thatâs how itâs got to be
You canât escape the simple truth
This is our destiny
Surviving against the odds
Surviving against the odds

Against the odds
Weâre surviving against the odds
Surviving against the odds
