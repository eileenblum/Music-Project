Hear the whistle blowinâ
Another working day
Turn the wheels of power
Earn your daily pay
The blood and sweat of working men
Made this country great
To the kings and queens of industry
Your lives we celebrate

No matter where youâre going
Remember where youâve been
It takes me back to a simple life
I sing my song â the ballad of the working man

The rhythm of the engines
Pounding out a song
Pulling all together
To make this kingdom strong
To every man and woman
Standinâ tall and proud
We dedicate this song to you
Rejoice and shout out loud

Itâs not so complicated
Remember where youâre from
It takes me back to a simple life
I sing my song â the ballad of the working man
Working man

Another round of whiskey
Another shot of gin
The bar-maid rings âlast ordersâ
Get the last ones in
The place is full of laughter
The glasses full of beer
It takes me to a simple life
Thatâs nearly disappeared

No matter where youâre going
Remember where youâve been
Take me back to a simple life
I sing my song â the ballad of the working man
The ballad of the working man
The ballad of the working man
