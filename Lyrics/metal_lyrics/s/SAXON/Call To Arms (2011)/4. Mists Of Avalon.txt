In the mists of Avalon
Sheâs waiting there for you
In the mists of Avalon
Sheâs waiting there for you

With sword of power, forged in steel
Your desire to make the deal
Excalibur is yours to take
Deep inside the crystal lake

In the mists of Avalon
Sheâs waiting there for you
The Lady of the Lake
You must be brave and true
Avalon, Avalon

Mystic powerâs in your hand
Take the blade and free the land
Unite the kingdom sea to sea
Excalibur, your destiny

In the mists of Avalon
Sheâs waiting there for you
The Lady of the Lake
You must be brave and true
Avalon, Avalon

In your heart you must be true
Abuse the power she gave to you
Betray your vows, youâll stand alone
Excalibur, return to stone

In the mists of Avalon
Sheâs waiting there for you
The Lady of the Lake
You must be brave and true
Avalon, Avalon

In the mists of Avalon
Sheâs waiting there for you
In the mists of Avalon
Sheâs waiting there for you
In the mists of Avalon
Sheâs waiting there for you
