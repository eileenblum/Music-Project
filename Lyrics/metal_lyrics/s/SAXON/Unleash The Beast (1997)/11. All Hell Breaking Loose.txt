[Byford/Quinn/Scarratt/Carter]

Dark clouds gather in the east
Calm before the storm
The devil sends his messenger
Hurricane is born
Lightning cracks across the sky
The tempest has begun
Raging forces take control
Destruction soon will come

Tearing up smashing down rolling on and on
Smashing through getting close
The time to run has gone
Twist and turn on its path
Crashing through your valley
This is nature's killing ground
You're in tornado alley

All hell breaking loose coming in your direction
Screaming down across the sky
There is no protection
All hell breaking loose coming in your direction
Screaming down across the sky
There is no protection

Turn your heads towards the sky
Pray for your salvation
You can't stop this mighty force
It's not of your creation
Death and chaos all around
This is not a dream
Caught inside the deafening roar
No one hears your scream

Tearing up smashing down rolling on and on
Smashing through getting close
The time to run has gone
Twist and turn on its path
Crashing through your valley
This is nature's killing ground
You're in tornado alley

All hell breaking loose coming in your direction
Screaming down across the sky
There is no protection
All hell breaking loose coming in your direction
Screaming down across the sky
There is no protection

Lightning cracks across the sky
The tempest has begun
Raging forces high above
Nowhere left to run
Dark clouds gather in the east
The calm before the storm
The devil sends his messenger
Hurricane is born

Tearing up smashing down rolling on and on
Smashing through getting close
The time to run has gone
Twist and turn on its path
Crashing through your valley
This is nature's killing ground
You're in tornado alley

All hell breaking loose coming in your direction
Screaming down across the sky
There is no protection
All hell breaking loose coming in your direction
Screaming down across the sky
There is no protection, protection, protection

All hell breaking loose coming in your direction
All hell breaking loose
