[Byford/Quinn/Scarratt/Carter/Glockler]

You went in the morning
We didn't say good-bye
The friends that you left here
Wonder why, wonder why

I wish I could see you
Just for a day
Tell you we missed you
And ask you to stay
Ask you to stay

To absent friends
This one's for you
This one's for you
To absent friends
This one's for you
This one's for you

You went without warning
We didn't even know
Just like the good ones
It was your turn to go
Your turn to go

To absent friends (to absent friends)
This one's for you (this one's for you)
This one's for you
To absent friends (to absent friends)
This one's for you (this one's for you)
This one's for you

When we're together
You stand by our side
We'll raise our glasses
And toast you tonight
Toast you tonight

You went in the morning
We didn't say good-bye
The friends that you left here
Wonder why, wonder why

I wish I could see you
Just for a day
Tell you we missed you
And ask you to stay
Ask you to stay

To absent friends (to absent friends)
This one's for you (this one's for you)
This one's for you
To absent friends (to absent friends)
This one's for you (this one's for you)
This one's for you
To absent friends (to absent friends)
This one's for you (this one's for you)
This one's for you
To absent friends (to absent friends)
This one's for you
This one's for you
This one's for you
