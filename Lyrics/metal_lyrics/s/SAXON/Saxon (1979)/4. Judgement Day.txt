I don't need your religion (**)
It ain't nothin' to me
I don't want nobody pushin'
Need to be free

You've got to hit hard
I've seen those demons fall
I'm savin' my soul for the final goal

But that day is comin', yeah (***)
The judgement is here
Look over your shoulder
The judgement is here

I don't need nobody knockin'
Knockin' on my door
I don't need nobody sellin'
Sellin' me no more

You're always on the take
All your silly faith
I'm savin' my soul, savin' my soul

I can feel it in the breeze (*)
It's blowin' through the trees
You can see it in the sky
It makes you wonder why

[Repeat *]
I can feel it in the breeze
It's blowin' through the trees
Through the trees

[Repeat **]

I've seen your...
I've seen those dreams fall
I'm savin' my soul for rock and roll

[Repeat ***]

The judgement is here
The judgement is here
The judgement is here
Judgement, judgement, judgement

Judgement day, yeah
