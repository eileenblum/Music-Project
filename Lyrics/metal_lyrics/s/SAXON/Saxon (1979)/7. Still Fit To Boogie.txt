We ain't gonna take it lyin' down
We're gonna stand on our own two feet
When people knock us down
We're gonna get up off the ground
And start all over again

Still fit to boogie (*)
Still fit to rock and roll
Stil fit to boogie
Stil fit to rock and roll

They struggle you down when you try to get up
You can't have doubts in your mind
Take the rough with the smooth
You got nothing to lose
All you need's the will to survive

[Repeat *]

Still fit to boogie (**)
Still fit to boogie
Still fit to boogie
Still fit to rock and roll

[Repeat ** 2 times]

If you're really feelin' down
Take a trip to town
And listen to a rock and roll band
You'll be rockin' and reelin'
Reelin' with the feelin'
Still fit to rock and roll, yeah
Still fit to rock and roll
