Far below the valleys
Hidden deep beneath the snow
There's a man who guards the secret
Of the frozen rainbow
...of all the ages
Lies hidden neath the ice
The man who finds the secret
Holds the power of life

Far below the valleys
Hidden deep beneath the snow
There's a man who's got a secret
Waiting to be told
I've searched through all the ages
To find the hidden truth
The secret of the rainbow
Will never be revealed

I'll find the rainbow, frozen rainbow
I'll find the rainbow, frozen rainbow
