[Byford/Quinn/Oliver/Dawson/Glockler]

Give it everything you've got

Just another kid waiting for a break
Is just bad news
Everybody's working nine to five
You got to pay your dues
But listen to your heart
Don't let them take away your time, no
Forget about tomorrow
Stop waiting for a sign

Ya gotta give it everything, kid
Give it everything you got, whooo
Ya gotta give it everything, yeah
Give it everything you got, everything you got

Can you hear the whistle blowin' in the night
Somewhere down the line
It's calling out your name, baby
Leave your blues behind (leave 'em behind)
If you wanna take a chance
Step right up and ring the bell (ring the bell)
Let me see your best shot
Only time will tell, whooo

Ya gotta give it everything, mama
Give it everything you got, yeah
Ya gotta give it everything, baby
Give it everything you got, everything you got

Just another kid waiting for a break
Is just bad news
Everybody's working nine to five
You got to pay your dues
But listen to your heart
Don't let them take away your time
Forget about tomorrow
Stop waiting for a sign, yeah

Ya gotta give it everything, kid
Give it everything you got, whooo
Ya gotta give it everything, yeah
Give it everything you got, ya

Ya gotta give it everything, mama
Give it everything you got, whooo
Ya gotta give it everything, baby
Give it everything you got

Give it everything you got!
