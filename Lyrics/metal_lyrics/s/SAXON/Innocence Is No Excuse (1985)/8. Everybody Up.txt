[Byford/Dawson]

Everybody up, ah
Whoo

On your feet, I wanna see the whole place jumpin'
Ya, c'mon baby, can you feel the heat
Move up close the boys are out to get ya
'Cause we don't care just what you got in mind

I said - Everybody up, everybody, everybody up
I said - Everybody up, everybody, everybody up

Stand in line we're about to rock you
We all know what you came here for
Stamp your feet this place is really rockin'
Rip it off, I wanna see some more

I said - Everybody up, everybody, everybody up
I said - Everybody up, everybody, everybody up
On your feet, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Up all night we've been getting crazy
Going down 'till you're satisfied
Raise your hands, shout and let me know
I wanna see you wasted from the show

I said - Everybody up, everybody, everybody up, yeah
I said - Everybody up, everybody, everybody up, uh
I said - Everybody up, whoo, everybody up
I said - Everybody up, um, everybody up
Ah everybody up, everybody up, everybody up, get up
