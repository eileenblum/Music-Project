[Byford/Dawson]

Raise some hell tonight

Hit me with the thunder
Tear this place apart
Can't wait a minute longer
Let the music start

I'm running with the tiger
I'm about to kill
Can't wait a minute longer
I wanna feel the thrill

Come on ride the rebel
Raise the Texas yell
Dancing with the Devil
We're gonna raise some hell

Riding on a stallion
The axe is gonna rule
Can you feel the fury
Screaming down on you

Showing you no mercy
We're gonna make you burn
Waiting for the lightning, yeah
You're never gonna learn

Come on ride the rebel
Raise the Texas yell
Dancing with the Devil
We're gonna raise some hell
We're gonna raise some hell tonight

Raise some hell
Raise some hell
Raise some hell
Raise some hell

Outlaw of the highway
Branded by the law
You're dancing with the devil
Make the dragon roar

Children of the future
Hear the rebel yell
Don't wait until tomorrow
You're gonna burn in hell

Come on ride the rebel
Raise the Texas yell
Dancing with the Devil
We're gonna raise some hell
We're gonna raise some hell

Raise some hell tonight
We're gonna raise some hell
