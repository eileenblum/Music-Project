[Byford/Quinn/Oliver/Glockler]

I gave you my love
But you threw it straight back in my face
I should have known better
You're just perfume and lace
You're messing around
You're making a fool out of me
But I've had enough baby
I'm setting you free

But I gave you all the chances
I gave you all the signs
Now who's the lonely one
Were you just a waste of time
Empty promises

I remember the days
When it used to be good
We were always together
We both understand
But something went wrong
White turned to black
So I'm leaving you baby
I ain't coming back

But I gave you all the chances
I gave you all the signs
Now who's the lonely one
Were you just a waste of time
Empty promises

But I gave you all the chances
I gave you all the signs
Now who's the lonely one
Were you just a waste of time
Empty promises
