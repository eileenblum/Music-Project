The queen of hearts she stands alone
Purveying all she sees
Trapped inside the players web
Of cunning and deceit
The bishop in his corner kneels
Praying for her soul
The knights are gathered at her side
To watch the game unfold
Careful where you tread
You may lose your head

To the red queen
The red queen queen of hearts
She is the red queen
The red queen queen of hearts

Like pawns we move and give our lives
While she protects her king
The rook will guard the tower gates
To keep them all within
The battle rages back and forth
Across the chequered board
Until the red king takes his place
The victor and her lord
Careful where you tread
You may lose your head

To the red queen
The red queen queen of hearts
She is the red queen
The red queen queen of hearts

Alice through the looking glass
The hatter waits below
The rabbit checks his watch again
Time is moving slow
The red queen lays upon her bed
Dreaming of the game
The Cheshire cat sits high above
Grinning at the knave
Careful where you tread
You may lose your head

Take your partners for the dance
Everyone must play
The deadly game of cat and mouse
No one gets away
Time has no beginning
The nightmare never stops
Round and round we spin again
Until the curtain drops

The queen of hearts she stands alone
Purveying all she sees
Trapped inside the players web
Of cunning and deceit
The bishop in his corner kneels
Praying for her soul
The knights are gathered at her side
To watch the game unfold
Careful where you tread
You may lose your head

To the red queen
The red queen queen of hearts
She is the red queen
The red queen queen of hearts

To the red queen
The red queen queen of hearts
She is the red queen
She is the red queen queen of hearts
