IÂ´ll be leaving down that road again tomorrow
I donÂ´t know when IÂ´ll be back again
ThereÂ´s a feeling in my heart that I must follow
When I leave you all behind I feel the pain

This is our world itÂ´s who we are
You wouldnÂ´t have me change a thing
Before we go just let me know
Will you be with us to the end

Many more have walked this path before us
I hear their voices whisper in the wind
The piper plays the tune and we must follow
No one knows just what the future brings

This is our world itÂ´s who we are
We wouldnÂ´t try to change a thing
Before we go just let me know
Will you stand with us to the end

We dim the lights and fade into the distance
But we wonÂ´t forget the friends we left behind
To the aching deep inside IÂ´ve no resistance
Only you can make me feel alive

This is our world itÂ´s who we are
We wouldnÂ´t ever change a thing
Before you go just let me know
Are you with us to the end

IÂ´ll be leaving down that road again tomorrow
I donÂ´t know when IÂ´ll be back again
ThereÂ´s a feeling in my heart that I must follow
When I leave you all behind I feel the pain

This is our world itÂ´s who we are
We wouldnÂ´t ever change a thing
Before you go just let me know
We stand together to the end
Before we go just let me know
Are you with us to the end
