We were rollinÂ´ on a boys night
Staying out til daylight
Putting down a glass or two
Laughing like cheapskates
Falling down a staircase
Think of better things to do
Pour another drink man
Time to get a round in
Night has only just begun
WeÂ´re gonna paint the town red
Getting out of our heads
NothingÂ´s gonna stop the fun

More wine more beer
We got to make a move
To make it out of here
We couldnÂ´t walk we couldnÂ´t talk
We were three sheets to wind

We were hanginÂ´ with our best mates
Getting in a right state
Drunker than a box of skunks
Flirting with the bar maid
TryinÂ´ to get the bill paid
Acting like a bunch of punks

IÂ´ve had enough no more
IÂ´m bouncing off the walls
I couldnÂ´t find the door
I couldnÂ´t think on the brink
We were three sheets to the wind

More wine more beer
We got to make a move
To make it out of here
We couldnÂ´t walk we couldnÂ´t talk
We were three sheets to wind

I must have drunk my paycheque
Feeling like a trainwreck
Never gonna drink again
IÂ´m like a bear with sore head
Crawling out of my bed
Must have been a bit insane

CanÂ´t move no way
Just let me lie in peace
DonÂ´t wanna see the day
Not again too much pain
We were three sheets to the wind
Three sheets to the wind
Three sheets to the wind
