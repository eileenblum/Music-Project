Break the camp the plan is done
The mountain waits for you to come
Snow and ice the granite rock
One mistake and you will drop
The summit never conquered yet
Soon youÂ´ll face your final test
No oxygen is taken there
You only breathe the thinning air

This is the land where the earth meets the sky
Standing on top of the world
YouÂ´re standing on top of the world

Inch by inch you near a climb
Up towards the death zone line
Your body claws for every breath
Razor sharp across your chest
Step by step each painful minute
Through the clouds towards the summit
Standing there in majesty
The highest place above the sea

This is the land where the earth meets the sky
Standing on top of the world
YouÂ´re standing on top of the world

Make no mistake descent is slow
Death awaits you far below
Check the rope is good and strong
Take your time donÂ´t get it wrong
To reach the peak is what you yearn
But many go and donÂ´t return
Your body screams from the lack of rest
But no one hears on Everest

This is the land where the earth meets the sky
Standing on top of the world
YouÂ´re standing on top of the world
Standing on top of the world
YouÂ´re standing on top of the world
