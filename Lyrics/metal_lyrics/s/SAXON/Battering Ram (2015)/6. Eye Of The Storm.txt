Howling wind raging free
Shattered land pounding sea
Jaws of death feel the beast
Mother natureÂ´s deadly feast

Nothing stops this deadly force
No escape in sight
From the eye of the storm
The eye of the storm

From the sea the tempest is born
Smashing down defences torn
Heavens wrath unleashed and free
Raining down relentlessly

Nothing stops this deadly force
No escape in sight
From the eye of the storm
Eye of the storm

Stand or run you decide
This could be your suicide
Moving fast towards the shore
Hurricane is at your door

Nothing stops this deadly force
No escape in sight
From the eye of the storm
The eye of the storm
The eye of the storm
The eye of the storm
