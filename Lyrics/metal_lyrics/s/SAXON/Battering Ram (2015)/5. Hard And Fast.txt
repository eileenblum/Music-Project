Ride into the sunset
Without a devils care
Riding fast you lose yourself
The wind is in your hair
The road slips by beneath your wheels
Rolling on and on
See the world go flashing by
Like a bullet from a gun

Driving hard feeling free
Moving fast at lightning speed
Hard and fast driving hard and fast

Out into the country
Throttle open wide
Take it to the limit
Feel the wheels begin to slide
Nothing beats the feeling
Senses overload
When you get behind the wheel
Just let your mind explode

Riding hard feeling free
Moving fast at lightning speed
Hard and fast riding hard and fast

Racing down the highway
Engine running smooth
ThereÂ´s nothing better in this world
Epitome of cool
Listen to the radio
Play your favourite song
RockÂ´nÂ´roll will never die
It just keeps rollinÂ´ on

Driving hard feeling free
Moving fast at lightning speed
Riding hard feeling free hard and fast
Driving hard and fast riding hard and fast
