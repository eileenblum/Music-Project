If youÂ´re feeling weak and near defeat
And your will to succeed slips away
Take a step no safety net
Trust in the the words that you say
No retreat never beat
We all live to fight another day

You can fight against the odds
Stop praying to the gods
When youÂ´re up against the wall
And youÂ´re waiting for the fall
Stand your ground stand your ground

WhatÂ´s the of use of speaking truth
If everything sounds like a lie
CanÂ´t they see that nothingÂ´s free
No matter how much that they try
WhatÂ´s the cost of futures lost
Just stand up and say what you think

If they try to put you down
DonÂ´t let them turn you Â´round
Remember what is right
And donÂ´t give up the fight
Stand your ground stand your ground

If youÂ´ve had enough and life is tough
And they donÂ´t seem to hear what you say
Make a stand play your hand
Sometimes thereÂ´s no other way
If youÂ´re giving in and you canÂ´t win
And thereÂ´s only one card you can play

You can fight against you odds
Stop praying to the gods
When youÂ´re up against the wall
And youÂ´re waiting for the fall
Stand your ground stand your ground
