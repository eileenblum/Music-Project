Smashing out of nowhere bringing you pain
Striking like lighting nothing remains
Screaming like a banshee out of the sky
ItÂ´s never gonna stop youÂ´re all gonna die

GodÂ´s assassin makes no deal
Born of chaos forged in steel
Destroyer destroyer

Is he made from flesh and bone
Or is he just a robot drone
He doesnÂ´t have a soul or heart
HeÂ´s gonna tear your world apart

Desolation coming from out of the sky
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
Destroyer destroyer

Forged in metal made of steel
GodÂ´s assassin makes no deal
Has no mercy doesnÂ´t feel destroyer

Does he come down from out of space
To devastate the human race
Nothing lives to see the day
All your futureÂ´s blown away

Armageddon killing machine
No protection laser beam
Destroyer destroyer
