What is this place across the fields
Where poppies stretch and sway
In Flanders days of war are gone
But memories will remain
Comrades of their different coats
Came to fight and die
From all sides they stood and fought
And fell beneath the sky

Where is this land where I am now a million spirits cry
A generation loved and lost never asking why

It didnÂ´t matter much at all
To the generals how you died
But to your families back at home
You were heroes side by side
The unknown soldier never known
A cross to mark your grave
But we remember what you did
In our hearts you will remain

Where is this land where I am now a million spirits cry
A generation loved and lost never asking why

So wave the flags and say goodbye
To a generation lost
TheyÂ´re marching into history
To the kingdom the kingdom of the cross

Across the Somme and Flanders lay
A generation gone
Came to fight the war of wars
The father and the son
Marching bands and cheers of joy
Sent you on your way
To face the bloody battlefields
And lives just thrown away
An inch of ground was heavy won and lost
Too much a price to pay
Young men lost their future gone
ThatÂ´s all there is to say

So wave the flags and say goodbye
To a generation lost
TheyÂ´re marching into history
To the kingdom the kingdom of the cross

The papers said youÂ´d all be home for Christmas
The politicians sang their battle hymn
Soon the guns will start the slaughter
And the end of innocence will begin
ThereÂ´s no one left that made it home
Their eyes will see no more
Gone to meet their fallen friends
In FlandersÂ´ fields of war

In the kingdom of the cross
Lay a generation gone
Remember they were men like us
Remember everyone
So wave your flags and say goodbye
To a generation lost
TheyÂ´re marching into history
To the slaughter and the loss
Remember a generation lost
TheyÂ´re marching out together
To the kingdom to the kingdom of the cross
