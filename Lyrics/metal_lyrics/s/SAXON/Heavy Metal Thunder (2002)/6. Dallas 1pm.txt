The crowded main street, the scene was set
They check out the view, turn the radio on
Open the case, assemble the gun
Wait at the ready for the presidents run The world was shocked that fateful day
A young man's life was blown away, away, away
In Dallas 1pm White hot lead, in the back of the head
Screaming confusion, shots rip the air
Cadillac racing, cops on the run
They couldn't believe the president's hit The shooting's done, assassins run
Is he dead, no one will say
Around the world the news was flashed
We sat and watched your tragic history The world was shocked that fateful day
A young man's life was blown away, away, away
In Dallas 1pm, 1pm The world was shocked
In Dallas 1pm
We sat and watched
Tragic history
The world was shocked
In Dallas 1pm
