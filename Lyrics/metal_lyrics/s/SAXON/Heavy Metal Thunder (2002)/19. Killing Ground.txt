Follow the piper follow the drum
Follow the footsteps our comrades begun
'Till the battle's, the battle's won
Follow the sabre follow the gun
For King and for Country we stand here as one
'Till the battle's done, battle's done We are brothers in arms
We fight for the cause
Together we stand
Divided we'd fall
On the killing ground
Killing ground Cannons are roaring from left and to right
Into the carnage before us we fight
'Till the day is won, day is won
Thousands have fallen around us they lie
Onwards together we fight or we'd die
'Till the day is done,  day is done
Yeah We are brothers in arms
We march for the cause
Together we stand
Divided we'd fall
On the killing ground
Killing ground Charge into battle victory we cry
Onto the lances our sabres held high
Hear our battle cry, battle cry
The field is now silent conflict is done
Marching to glory through rivers of blood
To our battle cry, battle cry We are brothers in arms
We die for the cause
Together we stand
Divided we'd fall
We are brothers in arms
We die for the cause
Together we stand
Divided we'd fall
On the killing ground We are brothers in arms
We fight for the cause
Together we stand
Divided we'd fall
We are brothers in arms
We die for the cause
Together we stand
Divided we'd fall We are brothers in arms
We march for the cause
Together we stand
Divided we'd fall
