[Byford/Quinn/Scarrattt/Carter]

Turn the wheel of torture
Spin the rack of pain
Now many souls will suffer
To satisfy your game
The smell of death surrounds you
How can you hide your shame
Can we stop this nightmare
Before it starts again

How can you sleep at night
Can you hear their voices in your head
We wrote this song for you
This is your song of evil
Song of evil

Stop this reign of terror
Are we all insane
Crush the voice of freedom
How many will remain
The devil walks beside you
Your souls will burn in hell
Your final retribution
When Satan rings the bell

How can you sleep at night
Can you hear their voices in your head
We wrote this song for you
This is your song of evil
Song of evil
Can you hear their voices in your head
This is your song of evil

Turn the screws of torment
Drop the blade of fear
Hear the screams of anguish
There's no mercy here
The smell of death surrounds you
Your souls will burn in hell
Can we stop this nightmare
When Satan rings the bell

How can you sleep at night
Can you hear their voices in your head
We wrote this song for you
This is your song of evil

How can you sleep at night
Can you hear their voices in your head
We wrote this song for you
This is your song of evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
