[Byford/Quinn/Scarrattt/Carter]

All guns blazing

Back's against the wall
Don't let the system break you
Why make it easy for them all
Barricade your doors
Defend yourself don't let them in
Keep hostile forces from your shores

Don't let them grind you down
Keep both feet on the ground
The battle rages on and on
Going in - All guns blazing
Going in - Get out my line of fire
Going in - All guns blazing
Going in - Get out my line of fire
All guns blazing

Together we will stand
Don't let the sword divide you
Draw your line across the sand
Waiting for the fall
Stand your ground we're digging in
This time we rally to the cause

Don't let them grind you down
Keep both feet on the ground
The battle rages on and on
Going in - All guns blazing
Going in - Get out my line of fire
Going in - All guns blazing
Going in - Get out my line of fire

Back's against the wall
Don't let the system break you
Why make it easy for them all
Barricade your doors
Defend yourself don't let them in
Keep hostile forces from your shores

Don't let them grind you down
Keep both feet on the ground
The battle rages on and on
Going in - All guns blazing
Going in - Get out my line of fire
Going in - All guns blazing
Going in - Get out my line of fire

Going in - All guns blazing
Going in - Get out my line of fire
Going in - All guns blazing
Going in - Get out my line of fire
