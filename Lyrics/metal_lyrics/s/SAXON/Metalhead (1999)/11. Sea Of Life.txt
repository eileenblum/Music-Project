[Byford/Quinn/Scarrattt/Carter]

A single silent bullet
Flying through the air
Will it find it's target
Fate will take it there
Who's name is written on it
No one has a clue
Will it find a victim
Could be you
I have seen the angel
The messenger of death
Riding out across the crimson sky
He comes to take another soul
Away from the sanctuary
He who plays the game
Must surely die

But someone has to pay the ferryman
To sail across the sea of life
Someone has to pay the ferryman
To sail across the sea of life
Sea of life
Sea of life

Your life is held in balance
On a slender silken thread
Weaving through the tapestries of time
We can walk the road together
Can you take me by the hand
Maybe we can find your promised land
I can hear the darkness falling
Somewhere in the night
Reaching out across the cold black sky
Could this be a twist of fate
Your written destiny
Or could the angel simply pass you by

Someone has to pay the ferryman
To sail across the sea of life
Someone has to pay the ferryman
To sail across the sea of life
Sea of life
Sea of life

Someone has to pay the ferryman
To sail across the sea of life
To sail across the sea of life

A single silent bullet
Flying through the air
Will it find it's target
Fate will take it there
Who's name is written on it
No one has a clue
Will it find a victim
Could be you

Could be you
Could be you
Could be you
Could be, could be you

Sea of life
Could be you
Sea of life
Could be, could be you
Sea of life
Could be you
Sea of life
Could be you
Sea of life
Could be you
Sea of life
Could be, could be you
Sea of life
Could be, could be, could be you
Sea of life
