[Byford/Quinn/Scarrattt/Carter]

Have you ever had the feeling
Someone's watching you
Listening to everything you say
Satellite surveilance
Creeping high above us all
Watching every little thing you do

'Cause they're watching you
They're watching me
Invasion of your privacy

There is no place really left to hide
Everything's in view
Can you see the writings on the wall
We live inside a fish eye lense
There's nothing they can't see
Can you feel them staring in at you (yeah)

They're watching you
They're watching me
Invasion of your privacy

They're watching you
They're watching me
Invasion of your privacy
(Come on)

There's a lens on every corner
No one hides from view
Who's behind the camera
No one has a clue

Are we getting paranoid
Or is it really true
Is the camera zooming in on cue
Take the shot, roll the film
There's nothing more to say
It does no good we'll never get away (yeah)

They're watching you
They're watching me
Invasion of your privacy

They're watching you
They're watching me
Invasion of your privacy

They're watching you
They're watching me
Invasion of your privacy

Watching you
They're watching me
They're watching you
They're watching me
They're watching you
Watching you
