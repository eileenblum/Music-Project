Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You're a mind of useless information
I'll make it easy on you
I'll never say what you want me
I'm not a martyr for your cause

What goes around comes around
You're gonna get what's coming to you
What goes around comes around
You're gonna get what's coming to you
You're gonna get what's coming to you, yeah

Can't seem to figure out your problem
I'm just not hearing what you say
You got a mouth just like a shotgun
Go spit your Buckshot out the door

What goes around comes around
You're gonna get what's coming to you
What goes around (yeah) comes around
You're gonna get what's coming to you

I find it easy to see
You're runnin' everywhere
I say to you
I say to you

You live your life outside my back door
I just can't take it anymore
Those seedy games will take you nowhere
Why don't you get yourself a life

What goes around comes around
You're gonna get what's coming to you
What goes around comes around
You're gonna get what's coming to you

What goes around comes around
You're gonna get what's coming to you
What goes around comes around
You're gonna get what's coming to you
Comin' to you
