[Byford/Quinn/Scarrattt/Carter]

Too late now, you wait now
You're out of time
New face now, your place now
Is that a crime
Stop talking, keep walking
You missed the sign

You made your choice
It's too late now
You threw it all away
You're just a prisoner
You're just a prisoner of lies
You're just a prisoner
You're just a prisoner of lies

Control you, involve you
You can't deny
You move me, surround me
You mystify
Can't stand it, won't make it
Just pass me by

You made your choice
It's too late now
You threw it all away
You're just a prisoner
You're just a prisoner of lies
You're just a prisoner
You're just a prisoner of lies

Too late now, you wait now
You're out of time
New face now, your place now
Is that a crime
Stop talking, keep walking
You missed the sign

You made your choice
It's too late now
You threw it all away
You're just a prisoner
You're just a prisoner of lies
You're just a prisoner
You're just a prisoner of lies

You're just a prisoner
You're just a prisoner of lies
You're just a prisoner
You're just a prisoner of lies
Prisoner
