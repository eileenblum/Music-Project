[Byford/Quinn/Scarrattt/Carter]

How come every time you feel real good
Somebody drops you a piss off bomb
How come every time you roll the dice
Somebody offers you the wrong advise
Oh no not again, just when I'm feeling happy
Oh no not again, just when you're feeling fine

Take it slow, don't go fast
Looking good never lasts
Different day same old song
Then somebody drops you a piss off bomb

In and out, round about, try to sort your feelings out
Can you see the full moon rising
Break the spell, ring the bell, trapped inside your private hell
Can't you see the far horizon
Down, down, drag you down, just when you're feeling happy
Down, down, drag you down, just when you're feeling fine

Take it slow, don't go fast
Looking good never lasts
Different day same old song
Then somebody drops you a piss off bomb

How come every time you feel real good
Somebody drops you a piss off bomb
How come every time you roll the dice
Somebody offers you the wrong advise
Round, round, turn you round, just when you're feeling happy
Down, down, drag you down, just when you're feeling fine

Take it slow, don't go fast
Looking good never lasts
Different day same old song
Then somebody drops you a piss off bomb
