We're a hundred thousand strong
Better there are none
At building mighty monarchs of the sea

We bend the heavy steel
Lay the massive keel
The greatest ships the world has ever seen

Pulling all together boys
Slaving for the bosses, boys
Got to meet the deadline now
Pulling all together boys
Made in Belfast
Made in Belfast

Bring the rivets, glowing white
Hammered in till they're tight
Inch by inch, she rises from the quay

Night and day, we toil and sweat
Glad to work, free from debt
Side by side, we forge this legacy

Pulling all together boys
Slaving for the bosses, boys
Got to meet the deadline now
Pulling all together boys
Made in Belfast
Made in Belfast

Wood and steel, gilt and glass
Everything was made first class
Nothing spared, the finest in the world

We see them now in picture books
Built by you on Belfast docks
The greatest ships the world has ever seen

Pulling all together boys
Slaving for the bosses, boys
Got to meet the deadline now
Pulling all together boys
Made in Belfast
Made in Belfast
