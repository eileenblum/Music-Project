Five red lights, nerves of steel
Engines hot, grip the wheel
Lights go out, motors roar
Ram the pedal to the floor
Pushing hard, don't look back
Try to focus on the track

Warriors of the road
Born to fight and win
Warriors of the road
Let battle now begin

Scream into the first chicane
Show no fear, deadly game
Find the pace, your only chance
Feel the tires skip and dance
You've got to keep the pressure on
One mistake, the race is gone

Warriors of the road
Born to fight and win
Warriors of the road
Let battle now begin

Race towards the finish line
Final lap, fastest time
Blasting down the winning straight
Checkered flag, yours to take
Standing on the podium
Number one, job is done

Warriors of the road
Born to fight and win
Warriors of the road
Let battle now begin
