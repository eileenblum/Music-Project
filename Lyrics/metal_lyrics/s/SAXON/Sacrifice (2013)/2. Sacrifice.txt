Hail to the gods, the bringers of fortune
Worship the sun, the giver of life
Follow the steps that lead you to heaven
Sacrifice waits for your beating heart

Blood on stone
Holy priest
No escape
No release
SACRIFICE...SACRIFICE

Enter the temple, the altar of stone
Appeasing the gods, you give up your life
Eyes open wide, the priest stands above you
Held in his hands, your still beating heart

Blood on stone
Holy priest
No escape
No release
SACRIFICE...SACRIFICE

Civilization lost in the jungle
Forgotten in time, the cities of gold
Carved in stone, the stories before you
When sacrifice claimed the still beating heart

Blood on stone
Holy priest
No escape
No release
SACRIFICE...SACRIFICE
