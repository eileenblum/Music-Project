Rising from the ashes
Floor by floor
Reaching up into the sky
Where the eagles soar

The city sleeps, life goes on
Hope is still alive
Born again, the towers rise
Above the New York skies

Rising from the ashes
For all the world to see

Walking the steel
Build them high
Walking the steel
You touch the sky

A thousand lights are blazing
Into the night
Marching on around the clock
Nothing stops the fight

High above the city
The work goes on and on
Racing to the heavens
Until the job is done

Rising from the ashes
For all the world to see

Walking the steel
Build them high
Walking the steel
You touch the sky

Remember the heroes
Remember them all...

Walking the steel
Build them high
Walking the steel
You touch the sky

Rising like the phoenix
Towards the sky
See the mighty towers
Reaching high

Make them strong, work the steel
Build them to survive
Born again the twins will stand
Hope will never die

Rising from the ashes
For all the world to see

Walking the steel
Build them high
Walking the steel
You touch the sky
