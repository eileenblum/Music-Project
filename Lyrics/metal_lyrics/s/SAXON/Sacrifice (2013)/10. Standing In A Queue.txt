Flying in from Dallas
Home to see my girl
I got my backs, I'm ready to rock
I've been around the world

As I came around the corner
The chaos came in view
A thousand silent people
Waiting in the queue

There's got to be a better way to get me out of here...

I'm standing in a queue
I don't know what to do
I haven't got a clue
Why I'm standing in a queue

Driving through the country side
Taking in the view
I stopped to take a little break
Get myself some food

Pulled into the truck stop
I didn't have a clue
Two thousand other people
Waiting in the queue

There's got to be a better way to get me out us here...

We're standing in a queue
We don't know what to do
We're just trying to make it through
We're just standing in a queue

It shouldn't be so difficult
To find a better way
I can think of better things to do
Than standing here all day

Someone needs to get a grip
We need another plan
Let's raise our voices up on high
And stick it to the man

There's got to be a better way to make it out of here....

I'm standing in a queue
I don't know what to do
We're trying to make it through
Standing in a queue
Trying to get to you
Standing in a queue
