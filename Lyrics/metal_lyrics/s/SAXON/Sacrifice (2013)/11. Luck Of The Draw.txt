[iTunes Bonus Track]You want the good life you want it all
Just roll the dice and let them fall
You play the game and try to win
Just spin the wheel your life begins

LifeÂ´s not easy canÂ´t be denied
Just get them bougth and join the ride

The luck of the draw you win or you lose
WeÂ´ve all got a chance
ItÂ´s just the luck of the draw luck of the draw

No golden goose no wishing well
WhatÂ´s on the cards no one can tell
WeÂ´re all the same the rich or poor
We spend our lives still wantinÂ´ more

LifeÂ´s not easy canÂ´t be denied
Just get them bougth and join the ride

The luck of the draw thereÂ´s nothing to lose
WeÂ´ve all got a choice itÂ´s just the luck of the draw

WeÂ´re born the same the rich and poor
We spend our lives still wantinÂ´ more
You roll the dice just let them fall
You want the good life you gotta get it all

LifeÂ´s not easy canÂ´t be denied
Just get them bougth and join the ride

The luck of the draw we win or we lose
WeÂ´ve all got a choice thereÂ´s nothing to lose
The luck of the draw
YouÂ´re rollinÂ´ the dice united or fall
ItÂ´s just the luck of the draw luck of the draw
IÂ´m rollinÂ´ the dice youÂ´re playinÂ´ the game
ItÂ´s just the luck of the draw
