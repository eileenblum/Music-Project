Two thousand years in time
The first of his kind
He dreams and plans of immortality

A dynasty of jade
An empire he has made
All the land beneath the setting sun

You wake once more to rise again
Guardians of the tomb
You live once more to fight again
Guardians of the tomb
Guardians of the tomb

His tomb will lay beneath the ground
Forces will be gathered 'round
To fight his battles far beyond the grave

A mighty army made of clay
Sleeps in death to rise again
Hidden just below the ancient soil

You wake once more to rise again
Guardians of the tomb
You live once more to fight again
Guardians of the tomb
Guardians of the tomb

Through the years, the memories fade
Forgotten now inside his grave
The first in line, an empire lost in time

Until a farmer breaks the seal
The terracotta tomb revealed
To rise again for all the world to see

You wake once more to rise again
Guardians of the tomb
You live once more to fight again
Guardians of the tomb
Guardians of the tomb
