Far beyond the forest in a land of ice and snow
When the full moon rises and shadows start to grow
When man becomes the hunted, screaming in the night
On your knees and pray to God to keep the beasts from sight 

Night of the wolf
Hear them calling
Night of the wolf
Howling at the moon

The hounds of hell are calling, hunting in the pack
Keep the fires burning, never turn your back
Are they in the darkness, watching in the night
Waiting for a weakness before they make a strike

Night of the wolf
Hear them calling
Night of the wolf
Howling at the moon

They're fighting for survival, it's the only thing they know
Far beyond the forest in the land of ice and snow

Far beyond the forest in a land of ice and snow
When the full moon rises and shadows start to grow
Are they in the darkness, watching in the night
On your knees and pray to God to keep the wolves from sight

Night of the wolf
Hear them calling
Night of the wolf
Howling at the moon
