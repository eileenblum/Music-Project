The legend tells of Icarus
Who flew too close towards the sun
DaVinci drew the plans for flight
But never saw his work begun

You'll find the answer
The answer riding on the wind
Man has always looked towards the sky
And dreamed of one day learning how to fly
To soar just like an eagle out of sight
They're searching for the secret
The secret of flight

On the fields the brothers Wright
Wait to launch their maiden flight
Shape the wings, the air will split
The different pressure gives the lift

You seek the knowledge
The knowledge hidden in the clouds
Man has always looked towards the sky
And dreamed of one day learning how to fly
To soar just like an eagle out of sight
They're searching for the secret
The secret of flight

The secret of flight

Through the wars the race went on
To build the planes to drop the bomb
The jet age came at the speed of sound
Einstein's theory breaking the ground

Look for the truth
The truth of how the birds can fly
Man has always looked towards the sky
And dreamed of one day learning how to fly
To soar just like an eagle out of sight
They're searching for the secret
The secret of flight

Man has always looked towards the sky (The secret of flight)
And dreamed of one day learning how to fly (The secret of flight)
To soar just like an eagle out of sight (The secret of flight)
They're searching for the secret
The secret of flight
The secret of flight
The secret of flight
The secret of flight
