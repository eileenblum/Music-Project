An empty space, a cold dark room
You say hello and look for food
The coffees strong to get you there
The clock is ticking no time to spare

Rig the lights, build the sound
Run the cables, check the ground
Haul the gear, set the stage
It's never easy to earn our wage

Sixteen beds inside the bus
Step inside be one of us
A roadie's life is what we choose
And the wheels keep rolling on

Seven nights, seven days
Hauling gear this is our way
Another town it never stops
Keep moving on 'til you're fit to drop

We fall asleep to the sound of the road
On through the night we move the load
It's like a family with ups and downs
But in the end it all calms down

Sixteen beds inside the bus
Step inside be one of us
A roadie's life is what we choose
And the wheels keep rolling on

[Solo: Doug]
[Solo: Paul]

A gypsy's way is what they choose
Not for all but a chosen few
They sacrifice a normal life
To tour the world with no end in sight

They live their life to keep the faith
To get tile band up on the stage
Move the gear, rig the lights
Check the sound, this is their life

Sixteen beds inside the bus
It's where we live be one of us
A roadie's life is what we choose
And the wheels keep rolling on

[Solo: Paul]

A roadie's life is what they choose
And the wheels keep rolling on
