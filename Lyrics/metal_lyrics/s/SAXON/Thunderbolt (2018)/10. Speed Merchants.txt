Turn the wheel start the drift on the turn make the shift
Spinning wheels burning rubber
Hear the engine scream
Revving high reach the limit
Turbocharged born to live it
On the edge give it more listen to the engine roar

Ram the throttle down
Listen to the sound
Speed merchants
Take it to the limit
Speed merchants
Loving every minute

Choose the cars start the fight
Who's the fastest from the lights
Acceleration pure and sweet ram the pedal down
Hit the red line hear the sound
Hold your nerve, you're gaining ground
Charging fast across the line
Hit the brakes and check the time

Screaming through the gears
It's music to your ears
Speed merchants
Take it to the limit
Speed merchants
Loving every minute
Speed merchants
Ram the throttle down
Speed merchants
Don't you love the sound?

[Solo: Doug]
[Solo: Paul]

On the track through twist and turn
Tyres squeal and rubber burns
Who's the fastest on the day?
It's way too close to call
Run the slow mo, take the shot
Motor screaming running hot
Every second like an hour
Petrol heads and raw horse power

Ram the throttle down
Don't you love the sound?
Speed merchants
Take it to the limit
Speed merchants
Loving every minute
Speed merchants
Turn the wheel and spin it
Speed merchants
Loving every minute
