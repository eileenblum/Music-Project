When the bomber flew
It was '79
Make no mistake: it was their time
Living fast and free
The only way to be
The word was on the street: they were the boys to beat

And they played rock and roll, they played rock and roll

They took no sleep
The tour rolled on
To Hammersmith, their battle song
Everything over the top
Giving it all 'til you drop
Adrenaline, leather and sweat
No one will ever forget

They played rock and roll, they played rock and roll

Dealing the ace
Releasing the power
The 80's were hear
This was the hour
Decibels crushing your brain, the closer you get to the pain
Night after night on the run, falling asleep with the sun

[Solo: Andy Sneap]
[Solo: Paul]

Bass like thunder
Drums of steel
Guitars of fury
With lightning feel
Living fast and free
The only way to be
The word was on the street: they were the boys to beat

And they played rock and roll, they played rock and roll
