The mighty ship lies broken on the rocks
The crew lay dead their bodies rot
A wooden coffin washed up on the shore
They drag it to the abbey steps
Buried there and laid to rest
But soon the evil curse will rise again
Bring the cross and holy water
Pray to God to stop the slaughter

Nosferatu creature of the night
Nosferatu darkness kills the light

Underneath a blood red moon
Darkness calls the night comes soon
He rises from the grave to kill again
Bar the gates and windows shut
Turn away don't even look
The Devil's seed is hunting for the prey

Take the vow before the alter
Trust in God to stop the slaughter

Nosferatu creature of the night
Nosferatu darkness kills the light

Beneath the abbey vaults we dance the vampire's waltz

[Solo: Doug]
[Solo: Paul]

Lonely streets the village sleeps
In the darkness evil creeps
The smell of death lies heavy on the air
A lonely soul just walking home
She has the sense she's not alone
With a deadly stare she falls beneath his will

Bring the cross and holy water
Pray to God to end the slaughter

Nosferatu creature of the night
Nosferatu darkness kills the light
Nosferatu creature of the night
Nosferatu darkness kills the light
