Cerberus in the underworld guards the gates of hell
Protects the world of Hades
Where the dead must dwell
The gods look down in anger on this wicked land
The battle of the Titans will be the final stand

Unleash the gods of war
Thunderbolt, father of the sky
Thunderbolt, the gods have sent a sign

Zeus is in the heavens watches from the sky
The gods are on Olympus waiting for a sign
The Kraken lies below them, titan of the sea
Coming for Poseidon to set the chaos free

Unleash the gods of war
Thunderbolt, father of the sky
Thunderbolt, the gods have sent a sign
Thunderbolt, crashing from the sky
Thunderbolt, hear the heavens cry

[Solo: Paul]
[Solo: Doug]

Master of the heavens, ruler of the sky
Homer writes the Odyssey, about the gods on high
Ancient Greek mythology tells the tale of spite and greed
The vanity that comes through power never should succeed

Unleash the gods of war

Thunderbolt, father of the sky
Thunderbolt, the gods have sent a sign
Thunderbolt, tearing cross the sky
Thunderbolt, hear the heavens cry
