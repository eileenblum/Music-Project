Clandestine hunter top of the food chain
Everything fears you strike like a hurricane
Stalking your prey using your senses
Coiled like a spring there are no defences

Run for your lives
There's no escape
From the predator
The predator

Silent and deadly attack with no warning
Pick out the weakest the sick and the fawning
Keep to the shadows stealth is your weapon
Nothing survives your naked aggression

Run for your lives
There's no escape
From the predator
The predator

[Solo: Doug + Paul]

Natural born killers never found wanting
Search for the victim programmed for hunting
Learning from birth honing their skill
There's no hesitation in for the kill

Run for your lives
There's no escape
From the predator
The predator
