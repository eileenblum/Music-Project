There's a place called Camelot
In a land that time forgot
Where lived a wizard the greatest of his time
He used his magic for the good
Defeating evil where he could

Cast the spell make the potions
From the earth healing lotions
Wand and staff wield the magic
Mystic lands dreams fantastic

Dreams fantastic

Enchanter of the royal court
The king and queen's sole consort
He never asked for favour or reward
But behind his back were jealous tongues
The king was old, he had no sons

Cast the spell make the potions
From the earth healing lotions
Wand and staff wield the magic
Mystic lands dreams fantastic

Wield the magic

[Solo: Paul + Doug]

The word went out across the land
Be you noble or lowly man
Free the sword, be the chosen one

But the wizard had a secret plan
To stop the knights from taking land
They need the sword to claim the jewelled crown
Excalibur plunged into the stone
Whoever frees it claims the throne

Cast the spell make the potions
From the earth healing lotions
Wand and staff wield the magic
Mystic lands dreams fantastic

Wield the magic
