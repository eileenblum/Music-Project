Mark the target, take it slow
Don't make a sound, let no one know
Where you lie and hide from view
Through the scope your aim is true
Crosshairs mark the deadly spot
Pull the trigger, take the shot

Sniper! Never asks for reasons why
Sniper! Let the bullet fly

Check the sights, read the wind
Take your time, you're disciplined
Squeeze the trigger nice and smooth
No sudden shock, no sudden move
Keep your calm the patient one
See the kill the job is done

Sniper! Never ask the reason why
Sniper! Let the bullets fly

[Solo: Doug]
[Solo: Paul]

Deadly fire towards the kill
No sentiment, you know the drill
Highly trained you are the best
Super marksman you passed the test
Crosshairs mark the deadly spot
Now squeeze the trigger and take that shot

Sniper! Never asks the reason why
Sniper! Let the bullets fly

Mark the target, take it slow
Don't make a sound, let no one know
Where you lie and hide from view
Through the scope your aim is true
Crosshairs mark the deadly spot
Pull the trigger, take the shot

Sniper! He never asks the reason why
Sniper! Let the bullet fly
Sniper! You're dead before you hit the ground
Sniper! Gone without a sound
