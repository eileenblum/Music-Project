You sailed across the Seven Seas
You brought the mighty to their knees
Sons of Odin, a warrior creed
Trained from birth for strength and speed
The greatest sailors of their time
Across the world your paths entwined
You conquered lands with might and dare
You sowed the seeds and settled there

Take your sword and end my life
I'm born to die in battles fight
Remember me, my deeds of valour
I'll sit with kings in God's Valhalla

Your bloodline lives through kings and queens
A warrior clan with distant dreams
You came and stayed to rule the land
From the frozen North you made your stand
Your craftsmen skilled in steel and wood
The beauty now is understood
Gold and silver the work of gods
You rose above against the odds

Take your sword and end my life
I'm born to die in battles fight
Remember me, my deeds of valour
I'll sit with kings in God's Valhalla

[Solo: Doug + Paul]

Raiders from the North you ventured far
Guided by the burning northern star
You were searching for a fertile life
You found it here beyond the ice

Take your sword and end my life
I'm born to die in battles fight
Remember me, my deeds of valour
I'll sit with kings in God's Valhalla
