[Byford/Quinn/Oliver/Carter/Glockler]

Bad luck and trouble get out of my way
My lady fortune's comin' to stay
Don't need no bullshit, no Mister Big
Don't need no contract, no papers to read

I don't need trouble
I don't need pain
My lady fortune's coming back again, ya
I ain't gonna take it, take it no more
'Cause when push comes to shove
This can be love
So I ain't gonna take it no more (no more)

Bad luck and trouble get out of my face
Your just a loser get off of my case
Can't steel my thunder, ya can't keep me down
You ain't going nowhere stop messin around

I don't need trouble
I don't need pain
My lady fortune's coming back again, coming back again
I ain't gonna take it, take it no more
'Cause when push comes to shove
This can be love
So I ain't gonna take it no more
'Cause I'm movin' on, movin' on

Bad luck and trouble passin' me by
Your days are numbered it's your turn to cry
No time for losers with nothing to say
Sunshine and blue skies heading my way

I don't need trouble
I don't need pain
My lady fortune's coming back again
I ain't gonna take it, take it no more
'Cause when push comes to shove
This can be love
So I ain't gonna take it no more (no more)
