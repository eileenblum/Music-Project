[Carter]

Ya driving me crazy
You're outta control
Your breaking all the rules
Sneaking out your back door
You're nothing but a wild child
Running 'round town
'Cause if there's a hell
Then I'm going down

Somebody call for emergency
Somebody rescue me
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Somebody rescue me
I'm on fire

My temperature's risin'
A hundred and four
You're looking to hot
I'm standing in a heat wave
Your nothing but a sex show
You're makin' me yearn
You're taking me down, baby
And I'm gonna burn

Somebody call for emergency
Somebody rescue me
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Somebody rescue me
I'm on fire

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Somebody rescue me
I'm on fire

[Repeat to end]
