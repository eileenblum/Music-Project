[Byford/Carter]

Cry for the children
Sons and daughters left behind
They walk alone down the trail of tears
Full of heartache, full of fears

Stand with open arms
Waiting for the fall
But who'll be there to help ya
When your back's against the wall

You'll be sailing home before the storm
Through the night into the dawn
On the wind I hear your voice calling
Sailing home before the storm

Why, cried the people
Give me shelter from the storm
They take the road across the bridge of sighs
No more heartache, the other side

Ya stand with open arms
Ya scream into the night
But who'll be there beside ya
Can you see the end in sight

You'll be sailing home before the storm
Through the night into the dawn
On the wind I hear your voice calling
Sailing home before the storm

Sailing home before the storm
Through the night into the dawn
On the wind I hear your voice calling...

Sailing home before the storm
Through the night into the dawn
On the wind I hear your voice calling
Sailing home before the storm

Sailing home before the storm
Through the night into the dawn
On the wind I hear your voice calling
Sailing home before the storm
