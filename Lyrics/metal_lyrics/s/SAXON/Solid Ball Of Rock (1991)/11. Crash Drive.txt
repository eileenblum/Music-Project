[Carter]

I just got the news you're back in town
You're looking for a good time
You're still going down
You're a little too crazy
You ain't gonna last
You're candle's lit at both ends
You're burning too fast

You're going down out of control
You're on a crash drive, baby
(Yeah)

You're talking too much
You've run out of time
You're walking on the limit
You're way out of line
It's a little too easy
To get what ya will
Ya running with the wolf, baby
Ya there for the kill

You're going down out of control
You're on a crash drive, baby
(Yeah)

I just got the news you're back in town
You're looking for a good time
You're still hangin' 'round

You're going down out of control
You're on a crash drive, baby
Crash drive, baby
(Yeah)
