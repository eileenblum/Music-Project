I've been working all day down on demolition alley
Looking down the barrel of a twelve gauge gun
Digging up rocks in this god forsaken valley
Breaking my back in the mid day sun

I served my time I lost my mind (*)
On demolition alley

Days go by but it feels like a lifetime
Dragging me down like a ball and chain
Doing my time just walking in a straight line
It's the only thing I know just to handle my pain

[Repeat *]

One of these days I'm just gonna have to break free
Taking my chances living on the run
There's only one man that can ever really stop me
He's looking down the barrel of that twelve gauge gun

[Repeat *]
