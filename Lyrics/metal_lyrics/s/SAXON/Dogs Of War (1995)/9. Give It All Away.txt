Sooner or later we'll meet the maker
It doesn't matter to me
'Cos I'll be laughing while I'm packing
They'll have to drag me away
I've been around I've been inside out
I've seen it all before
I've had my share of lady luck
Knocking at my door

I'd give it all away (*)
I'd give it all away
Just for one more day
One more day with you

If you ever see the devil
You gotta tell him from me
I got an angel a little angel
Living right here with me
I've been across and I've been to the edge
I've seen it all before
I've had my share of lady luck
Knocking at my door

[Repeat *]
