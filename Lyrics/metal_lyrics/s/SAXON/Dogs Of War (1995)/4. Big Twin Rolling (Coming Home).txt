I got my big twin rollin' thumping out a tune
Following the headlight coming back to you
I don't need no big jet liner don't need no limousine
All I've got's my pair of wheels satisfaction guaranteed

I'm on my way I'm coming home (*)
I'm on my way I'm coming home

Thunder down the highway keeping up the pace
Six hundred miles before me until I see your face
Gasoline and metal hammer through the night
Eating up the freeway makes me feel alright

[Repeat *]

Polished steel and leather the rumbling of the pair
Hear the carburettors sucking in the air
Sat around the engine vibrating every bone
Keeping it together blasting my way home

[Repeat *]
