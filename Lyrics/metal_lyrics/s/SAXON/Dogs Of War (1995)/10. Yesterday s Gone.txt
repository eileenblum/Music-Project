You left me standing here staring at the view
Did you think that I was coming after you
I might have been that dumb a hundred times before
You can take your stinking attitude and shove it out the door
Shove it out the door

I'm tired of your lying and fooling around (*)
You've pushed me too far I'm standing my ground
I've got news for you baby yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone

I can't believe that you would put me down this way
There's not a word of thruth in anything you say
I gave you everything and you threw it in my face
You're running on your own now baby, see who wins the race
See who wins the race

[Repeat *]

I saw you yestersday out with someone new
You've got him on your hook dancing to your tune
Do you think of me when he's in your bed
If you think I'm coming back to you you're off your pretty head
Off your pretty head

[Repeat *]
