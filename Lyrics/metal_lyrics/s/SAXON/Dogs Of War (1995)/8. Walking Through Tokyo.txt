Walking through Tokyo (*)
Visions of the Samurai
Walking through Tokyo
Looking through the dragon's eye

I had a dream about the mighty Shogun
Faded visions of the Samurai
Mists of silk reflections of the city
Dance across the silver blade
Silent temples driving my emotions
Voices whisper from another time
Mystic dreams stretching out before me
Take me through the Dragon's eye

[Repeat *]

I'm drifting slowly on the winds of kamikaze
To the emperor on wings of gold
Cryptic lessons from a long forgotten city
Guard the passage to the inner soul
Sacred mountains reaching to the heavens
Holds the secret in it's frozen hand
Standing proud silent and majestic
Casts it's spell far across the land

[Repeat *]

In my dream I can see the darkness
Draws the veil across the painted sky
As the Geisha gives on dying pleasure
I leave the magic in the land of jade

[Repeat *]
