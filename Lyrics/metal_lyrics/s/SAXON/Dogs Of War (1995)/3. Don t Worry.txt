I'm leaving this town I'm out of the race
I'm packing my bags I ain't gonna stay
I can't stand the pressure building on me
Don't try to stop me I've got to break free

Take me down to the cool clear water (*)
Don't worry about me
Take my time stay a while
Don't have to worry about a thing
Don't you know
I'm going down to the cool clear water
Don't worry about me
I take my time I'll stay a while
Don't have to worry about a thing

They tell you the truth but you know it's a lie
Big brother is watching the eye in the sky
Just take your freedom and throw it away
'Cause sooner or later we're all going to pay

[Repeat *]

They're taxing the rain the water we drink
Just do as you're told there's no time to think
We shouldn't forget what we learnt from the past
Stop looking at life through rose coloured glass

[Repeat *]
