Here we stand underneath a blood red sky
To seek the answer we're all looking for
We build our lives but there's no certainty
They won't be washed away like castles in the sand

[Chorus:]
We're still searching for Atlantis
We're all looking for our shangrila
Searching for Atlantis

Looking back you can't change a thing
In your mind there lies the key
There are many doors that you'll be passing through
Down the winding road to find your xanadu

[Repeat chorus]

You walk the path towards your destiny
Through twists and turns to reach your journey's end
We build our lives but there's no certainty
They won't be washed away like castles in the sand
