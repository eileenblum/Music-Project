We lay our case before you
Let your hammer fall
Tip the scales of justice
Liberty for all

Do you stand for freedom, do you stand for justice
Do you stand for anything at all
We have the power, we have the courage
To make the mighty fall

[Chorus:]
Hear the voice of reason
Let your hammer fall
You're the judge and jury
Gimme justice, give me justice!
Justice!

When you free the guilty
The innocent remain
Can you hear your conscience
Can you see the pain

Do you have the mercy, do you have the passion
Do you have integrity at all
We have the power, we have the courage
To make the mighty fall

[Repeat chorus]

Justice! Gimme justice!

Take the oath of honor
On the Bible swear
Fight for truth and justice
Do you really care

Will you fight for freedom, will you fight for justice
Will you fight for anything at all
We have the power, we have the courage
To make the mighty fall

[Repeat chorus]
