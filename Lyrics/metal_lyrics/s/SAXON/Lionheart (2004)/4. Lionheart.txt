Raise your banners... Raise them high... In your homeland hear the cry
From the battle... Turn to home... Back to England to claim your throne
Six white horses, you must ride, loyal comrades by your side
Prince of lions... The second son... Through the darkness the king will come

[Chorus:]
Lion... Lionheart
Defender of the faith
Lion... Lionheart
Protector of the state
Lionheart

Your crown awaits you... The chose one... Tell the people that freedom's come
Light the beacons... Ring the bells... Sing you minstrels there's tales to tell
Send the message... Across the land... The king returns with sword in hand
Law and order... He will restore... Evil tyranny will reign no more

[Repeat chorus]

Raise your banners... Raise them high... In your homeland hear the cry
From the battle... Turn to home... Back to England to claim your throne
Build your castles... Guard the keep... Behind these walls the city sleeps
No more conflict... The blood is shed... Three gold lions on flags of red

[Repeat chorus]
