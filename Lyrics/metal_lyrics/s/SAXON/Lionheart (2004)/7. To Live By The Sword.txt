To follow the code of honour
Die with a sword in your hand
That is the way of the warrior
Your forefathers left on the land

To live by the sword
You must die by the sword

Trained in the way of the masters
Disciples of conflict and war
The blade of and the bow are your weapons
Your brothers have fought here before

Forged in the land of the shogun
A blade of unbreakable steel
The samurai spirit is with you
To battle you carry their seal

[Chorus:]
To live by the sword
You must die by the sword
Warriors born to be free
To live by the sword
You must die by the sword
Warriors born to be free
To live by the sword

Born in the shadows of Fuji
From out of the ashes you rise
To fight on the side of the emperor
Like many before you that died

You courage can never be broken
Warriors fearless and brave
You follow the ancient traditions
Sworn to your ancestors grave

[Repeat chorus]

To live by the sword
To die by the sword
Warriors free
To live and die by the sword

To follow the code of honour
Die with a sword in your hand
That is the way of the warrior
Your forefathers left on the land
The samurais spirir walks with you
A blade of unbreakable steel
Forged in the land of the shogun
To battle you carry their seal
