Blue bird skimming on razor's edge the legend will be born
The race is on against the clock in the silence of the dawn
The greatest bird to ever fly the fastest of her breed
Pushing out the envelope to break the record speed

Blue water
White lightning
Pushing yourself to extreme
Man and machine

Taking it on to the barrier screaming it right to the edge
At the limit of technology hanging your life on the ledge
You gave up your life for the record you were driven and born to achieve
Your legend will not be forgotten you were the master of speed

Blue water
White lightning
Union of man and machine
Blue water
White lightning
Pushing yourself to extreme
Man and machine

Blue birds skimming on a mirrors edge a legend will be born
The race is on against the clock in the silence of the dawn
The greatest bird to ever fly the fastest of her breed
Pushing out the envelope to break the record speed
