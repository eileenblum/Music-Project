If there's one thing I love
It's flying high above
Breaking through the barrier of sound
It's just like making love
When you're up above
Riding in my bird of silver steel

Forget the time (*)
Ten miles high
Living my fantasies
At twenty thousand feet
Twenty thousand feet, twenty thousand feet

It's the rushing of my blood
That makes me feel so good
I can see the world below just shooting by
Twice the speed of sound
That's how I like to ride
My chariot of steel across the sky

[Repeat *]

If it's faster than light
Sharper than steel
I'll race across the ceiling of the world
Just like a gun
Aiming at the sun
Riding in my bird of silver steel

[Repeat *]

I'm floating in space
The world seems to disappear
Then I awake
Got to get my head back in place
Twenty thousand feet, twenty thousand feet
Twenty thousand feet, twenty thousand feet
