[Peter Byford - Doug Scarratt - Paul Quinn - Timothy Carter - Nigel Glockler]

You called my name
Deep in the coldest blackest night
You saved my life
I heard your voice deep in the night
But in my nightmare I start to scream
In my nightmare this is no dream

Who called my name who saved my life
Deep in the night I heard your voice

I saw the flames
I watched our memories turn to dust
I saw them burn
I walked away not looking back
But in my nightmare I start to scream
In my nightmare this is no dream
This is no dream

Who called my name who saved my life
Deep in the night I heard your voice

Wake up, wake up, wake up

In my nightmare I start to scream
In my nightmare this is no dream

Sometimes I wake
I see the fire in the night
It's only dreams
I hear your voice deep in the night
But in my nightmare I start to scream
In my nightmare this is no dream

Who called my name who saved our lives
Deep in the night I heard your voice
Who called my name who saved my lives
Deep in the night I heard your voice
