[Peter Byford - Doug Scarratt - Paul Quinn - Timothy Carter - Nigel Glockler]

Come hear the story come gather round
About the demon of London town

Come hear the story come gather round
About the demon of London town
I bid you welcome you hear him call
Behind these doors he'll serve you all
Feel the knife on your skin now you pay for your sin
Let the blood start to flow
Full of panic and fear whispered words in your ear

I am the demon Sweeney Todd
Demon Sweeney Todd

Come death and murder that was his trade
He strips your bones for the bargain he made
Below the chamber he cuts at your flesh
A pile of meat is all that is left
Feel the knife on your skin now you pay for your sin
Let the blood start to flow
Full of panic and fear whispered words in your ear

I am the demon Sweeney Todd
Demon Sweeney Todd

They say he's crazy he's just insane
Some say revenge was the reason he came
He was the demon of London town

Some say he's crazy some say he's mad
Some say revenge is what drove him to bad
Was he a vicious black lies?
I am the demon the demon he cries
Feel the knife on your skin now you pay for your sin
Let the blood start to flow
Full of panic and fear whispered words in your ear

Feel the knife on your skin now you pay for your sin
Let the blood start to flow
Full of panic and fear whispered words in your ear

I am the demon Sweeney Todd
Demon Sweeney Todd
Demon Sweeney Todd
Demon Sweeney Todd
