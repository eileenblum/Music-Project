[Peter Byford - Doug Scarratt - Paul Quinn - Timothy Carter - Nigel Glockler]

Take up your sword the sword of the brave
You fight for legion you fight to the grave
For death and for glory your spirit won't die
Legions of steel to battle you cry
Hail to the heroes stand to the last
Gone are warriors they call from the past

Battalion's battalions of steel
Riding out to glory and fame

To march or to die that was your creed
Comrades in arms an army of steel
No one can stand your power and might
Onwards together into the fight
Hail to the heroes stand to the last
Gone are warriors they call from the past

Battalion's battalions of steel
Riding out to glory and fame
Battalion's battalions of steel
Marching out to glory and fame

Legions of steel to battle they cry
Marching to glory their spirits won't die
For death and for glory your fight to the grave
Raise up your sword the sword of the brave
Hail to the heroes stand to the last
Gone are warriors they call from the past

Battalion's battalions of steel
Riding out to glory and fame
Battalion's battalions of steel
Marching out to glory and fame
