[Peter Byford - Doug Scarratt - Paul Quinn - Timothy Carter - Nigel Glockler]

Shooting fast across the sky
Hellcat coming gonna die
Twist and turn you're on the run
Diving fast across the sun

Hellcat, hellcat look into the fire
Hellcat, hellcat build the funeral pyre
Hellcat, hellcat dance across the sky
Hellcat, hellcat where're all going to die

Nowhere left for you to run
Can't escape the loaded gun
See the beast and death will come
The end in Nye the job is done

Hellcat, hellcat look into the fire
Hellcat, hellcat build the funeral pyre
Hellcat, hellcat dance across the sky
Hellcat, hellcat where're all going to die

Ride the beast across the sky
Hellcat coming gonna die
Twist and turn you're on the run
Can't escape the loaded gun

Hellcat, hellcat look into the fire
Hellcat, hellcat build the funeral pyre
Hellcat, hellcat dance across the sky
Hellcat, hellcat where're all going to die

Hellcat, hellcat look into the fire
Hellcat, hellcat build the funeral pyre
Hellcat, hellcat dance across the sky
Hellcat, hellcat where're all going to die
Where're all going to die
