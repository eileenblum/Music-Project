[Peter Byford - Doug Scarratt - Paul Quinn - Timothy Carter - Nigel Glockler]

I was driving down the route doing 185
Just me and my friends out for a drive
I should have seen the trouble looming ahead
Should have known better I was into the red
But I never saw the gun I never saw the law
Hiding in back of a 4 by 4

Caught on a photograph guilty of driving fast
But some days you've got to lose
I'm in the slow lane I've got the slow lane blues
Slow lane blues

They took me to the side and gave me some grief
Said I was crazy I couldn't believe
Good cop bad cop they played the routine
They took away my car I tossed them the keys
Their was nothing on the road when I gave it the gas
I never saw the law we were having a blast

Caught on a photograph guilty of driving fast
But some days you've got to lose
I'm in the slow lane I've got the slow lane blues
I gotta blues

They said I had it coming a matter of time
Driving like a fool ignoring the signs
But I never saw the gun I never saw the law
Hiding in the back of a 4 by 4

Caught on a photograph guilty of driving fast
But some days you've got to lose
I'm in the slow lane
I was caught on a photograph guilty of driving fast
But some days you've got to lose
I'm in the slow lane I've got the slow lane blues
