[Peter Byford - Doug Scarratt - Paul Quinn - Timothy Carter - Nigel Glockler]

Take a plane, take a pill
Need some sleep, feel like hell
In my suitcase that's my life
Thoughts of you cut me like a knife

But long, long gone down that lonely road
But it won't be long until I'm coming home

Another ticket, another town
Here lonely miles, the days drag me down
On this highway going anywhere
I hear your voice when there's no one there

But long, long gone down that lonely road
But it won't be long until I'm going home
Get up

Take a boat, take a train
Need some comfort to ease my pain
Out my window I sit and stare
The days drag by, baby when you're not there

Gone, gone, gone, gone down that lonely road
But it won't be long until I'm coming home

But long, long gone down that lonely road
But it won't be long until I'm coming home
But it won't be long until I'm going home
Yes it won't be long until I'm going home
I'm going home
It won't be long
