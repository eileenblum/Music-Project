[Peter Byford - Doug Scarratt - Paul Quinn - Timothy Carter - Nigel Glockler]

Everything is changing soon the writings on the wall
Just sit there and deceive yourself but everything will fall
The seas will rise across the land and sweep it all away
Anarchy will be the game and everyone must play

Protect yourselves when the dark times come
Protect yourselves you're not the only ones

When you see the warning signs the change will come too late
Everyone will save themselves for we have sealed our fate
The sun will beat upon the earth burning all before
Everything is changing soon nothing like before

Protect yourselves when the darkness comes
Protect yourselves you're not the only ones

Prepare yourself for anarchy soon the end will come
Sit there and delude yourself there's nowhere left to run
The seas will rise across the land and sweep us all away
Everything is changing soon that's the price we pay

Protect yourselves when the darkness comes
Protect yourselves you're not the only ones
Protect yourselves when the darkness comes
Protect yourselves you're not the only ones
