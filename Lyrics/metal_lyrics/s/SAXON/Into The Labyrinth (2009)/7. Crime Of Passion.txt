Turn up the heat don't be discreet just let your feelings flow
Can't get enough you fill my cup I'll drink until I crawl
I can't put out my fire you've got what I desire just give it up to me
What I want is what I see

You're just a crime of passion you're guilty of dragging me in
You're just a crime of passion I'm guilty a fool for your sin

You are the one you load my gun
I'm gonna shoot on sight
Don't make a sound I'm going down
I'll stay until you come
I can't put out my fire you've got what I desire
Just give it up to me what I want is what I see

You're just a crime of passion you're guilty I'm turning you in
You're just a crime of passion I'm guilty of living in sin
You guilty in sin

You fill my cup can't get enough just let the feelings flow
You are the one you load my gun you make me shoot on sight
I can't put out my fire you've got what I desire
Just give it up to me what I want is what I see

You're just a crime of passion you're guilty of dragging me in
You're just a crime of passion I'm guilty a fool for your sin
And just you're just a crime of passion you're guilty I'm turning you in
And just you're just a crime of passion I'm guilty of living in sin
And fool for your sin
