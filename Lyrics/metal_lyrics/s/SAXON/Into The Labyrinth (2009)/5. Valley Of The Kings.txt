You must journey across the sea
Find the secret destiny
Burning sand scorching sun
To the land of the ancient one
The hidden tomb the last in line
Lost forever in sands of time
Find the key unlock the past
You have no choice this is your task

In the valley of the kings
There he waits on golden wings
Break the seal and set him free
The golden one your destiny

Waiting there for you to come
A royal prince the chosen one
Move the stone unleash the past
The one you seek you'll find at last
The boyhood king he walks the past
He hides behind his golden mask
Deep inside his tomb of gold
The greatest story ever told

In the valley of the kings
There he waits on golden wings
Break the seal and set him free
The golden one your destiny

Dig my friends set him free
Read the words the prophecy
Death will come on swiftest wings
Whoever moves this sleeping king
Carved in stone the book of death
The pharaohs curse will take your breath

Death will come on swiftest wings
For those who move this sleeping king
Heed you now the book of death
Beware the curse with every step
Shine the light the glint of gold
With racing hearts the past unfolds
Open now for all to see
A pharaohs tomb your legacy

In the valley of the kings
There he waits on golden wings
Break the seal and set him free
The chosen one your destiny

In the valley of the kings
There he waits on golden wings
Break the seal and set him free
The chosen one your legacy
