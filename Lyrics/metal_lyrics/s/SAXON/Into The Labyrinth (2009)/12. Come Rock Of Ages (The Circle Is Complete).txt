[Peter Byford - Doug Scarratt - Paul Quinn - Timothy Carter - Nigel Glockler]

Did you see the signs has the time begun
It was the seventh star of the seventh sun
Round and round this circle turns
The planets all align this is the time
This is the hour we've waited for the sign

Come rock of ages
We worship at your feet
Now is the time
The circle is complete
Come rock of ages

Now the circle turns on the wheel of life
Will the lines converge to a point of light
Round and round we gather here
The planets all align this is the time
This is the hour our destines entwine

Come rock of ages
We worship at your feet
Now is the time
The circle is complete
Come rock of ages

It was the seventh star of the seventh sun
Did you read the signs has the time begun
Round and round this circle turns
The planets all align this is the time
This is the hour we've waited for the sign

Come rock of ages
We worship at your feet
Now is the time
The circle is complete

Come rock of ages
We worship at your feet
Now is the time
The circle is complete
Come rock of ages
Rock of ages
