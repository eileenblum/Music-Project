Ooh,You gotta live to rock

When I was a boy I didn't know what I should do
They said get an education you got to forget about the blues
But I was hooked on rock and roll I got a demon in my soul
I gotta wanting the say I gotta, gotta break away

You gotta live to rock
Never stop
You gotta live to rock
Blow your top

I could have been a soldier I could have been a lawyer
I could have been a teacher what about a preacher
But I got news for you I just dig these rhythm and blues
I was waiting for the day when I could when I could break away

Live to rock
Never stop
Live to rock
Now blow your top

I could have been a lawyer
I could have been a teacher
what about a preacher

Just follow the rules that's what they said to me
You got to get an education you got to forget about the blues
But I was hooked on rock and roll I got a demon in my soul
I got one thing to say you got to let the music play

Live to rock
Never stop
Live to rock
Blow your top

Live to rock
Never stop
You gotta live to rock
Now blow your top

You gotta live to rock
You gotta never, never, never, never stop
Live to rock
You gotta blow your top

Live to rock
Never stop
You gotta live to rock
Blow your top

Live to rock
Never stop
You gotta live to rock
Gotta never, never, never, never stop
You gotta live to rock
