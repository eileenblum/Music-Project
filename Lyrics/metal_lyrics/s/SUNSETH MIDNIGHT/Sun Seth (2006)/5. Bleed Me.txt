[Music: Ricardo Campos / Lyrics: Ricardo Campos &amp; Theo Vieira]

I like the way you pour me down
But shouldnï¿½t ask me where Iï¿½ve been
I need to feel your pain inside me
Just take me on this way out

You cannot feel the plague inside
This unreal, undone desire
Self-control? Iï¿½m down on my knees
Youï¿½re snoringï¿½Devouringï¿½
Itï¿½s time toï¿½

Bleed me again
Iï¿½ve got to feel you inside
Youï¿½ve got to blow me away
Go on and bleed me... Now!
Bleed me again
Iï¿½ve got to feel you inside
Youï¿½ve got to blow me again
Go on and bleed me... Away!

Two worlds collide; one brings me down
Darkness complains without a sound
And then you go so deep, yeah
You called me - itï¿½s time to bleed me

And when you call my name
You come to lay me down
You recreate my pain
Iï¿½m here to be your pawn
Sometimes you call me insane
Sometimes you strap me down
Just desecrate my grave
Youï¿½ve got to bleed me now

[CHORUS]

I cannot feel...
I cannot try...
I cannot move...
I cannot die...
I compromised...
You canï¿½t decide
You cannot deal
You cannot fight
Iï¿½m on your side
You cannot hide
How gods collide
I am desire
I am your fears
Within your tears
Behind your smile
You compromised
Youï¿½ve got to bleed me

And when you call my name
We breed until the dawn
We recreate the scenes
To make this world go round
Sometimes you call me insane
Sometimes you strap me down
Just desecrate my grave
Youï¿½ve got to feed me now

[CHORUS]
