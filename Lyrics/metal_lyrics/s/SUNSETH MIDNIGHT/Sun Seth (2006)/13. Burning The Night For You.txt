[Music: Roger Lombardi / Lyrics: Roger Lombardi &amp; Ricardo Campos]

You put a spell on me honey
You come to make it true
You give me all the pleasure and sow the seeds of lust
You - everywhere - centre of my disgrace
You - everywhere - cover my eyes and take it all the pain

This time Iï¿½ve come for you darling
This time I see the truth
Your lips on my skin
Hearts on the loose, Iï¿½m burning the night for you

Canï¿½t take this feeling honey
Your ways are hot and cruel
Your eyes keep telling me how blue and gone I am
You - everywhere - centre of my disgrace
You - everywhere - cover my eyes and take it all the pain

[CHORUS]

You say the word that makes me feel the pain of love
But after all Iï¿½m getting closer to your heart
You know Iï¿½m burning the night

[CHORUS]
