[Music: Roger Lombardi / Lyrics: Ricardo Campos &amp; Roger Lombardi]

In your arms...
Itï¿½s so easy to make love
But the night... Itï¿½s almost gone
And the wind will take our hearts

And your eyes
Make me fall in love again
While I face a brand new day
We are dancing in the graveyard of your heart

Go on...
Come to play
And I want you
Touch you
Again
Go on...
Come to play
And I fell you
Touch me
Go on...
Come to play
And we kiss to see how strong our love remains

And your lips...
Make my weak flesh turn to stone
But the night... Itï¿½s almost gone
And we need to taste our love

Oh my love
Let's make this moment last
Night is young and we ride fast
We are dancing in the graveyard of your heart

[CHORUS]

And night... Itï¿½s still young in our hearts

And your face
Make me fall in love again
While I wait for joy and pain
We are falling in the graveyard of my heart

And night, itï¿½s still young in our hearts
And night, itï¿½s still young in our hearts
Oh darling, itï¿½s still young for our love

[CHORUS]
