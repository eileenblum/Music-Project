[Music: Theo Vieira / Lyrics: Theo Vieira &amp; Ricardo Campos]

And now I understand
Can you just take my hand?
You should bring some ecstasy for me
A frozen rose in gray
Was born in decadence
To praise the pain inside me

I canï¿½t pretend to be the same
Like a false messiah
Now all my hope is dead and gone
The weakness of a liar

Iï¿½m in fear - I canï¿½t hide
You can see it through my eyes

Now love is gone
Iï¿½ll sweep away
My body is freezing over you
Just call my name
To crush my heart
As Iï¿½ve got nothing else ï¿½cause

I canï¿½t pretend to be the same
Like a false messiah
Now all my hope is dead and gone
The weakness of a liar

Iï¿½m in fear - I canï¿½t hide
You can see it through my eyes

Just take me in or let me out
I just canï¿½t take it anymore
Just take me in or let me out
Just canï¿½t hear me calling
Sometimes I feel like dying
A thousand times youï¿½ve been before my eyes
Just let me go ahead this time
Down on loneliness...

You came to take my hand
Could you just understand?
I wouldnï¿½t leave this ecstasy for you
A frozen rose in gray
A timeless little prayer
To raise this pain inside me

[CHORUS]

Leave me!
Down on loneliness
Leave me!
Just leave me

You can get near but youï¿½ll never get out

[CHORUS]
