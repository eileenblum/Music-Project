[Music: Ricardo Campos / Lyrics: Ricardo Campos &amp; Ricardo Batalha]

Inside my chamber Iï¿½m watching
(The) New worldï¿½s burning
My desert routes are overwhelmed
Like a prison

I had the lordship of the Middle East
(The) Land of contradiction
But my red eyes keep watching you
In a misguided vision

The dark, thereï¿½s no light
The black, thereï¿½s no way back
The sunset, thereï¿½s no sunrise
The night, I stole the day

Iï¿½m the god of the desert
The destructive heat of the afternoon sun
I rule eclipses, earthquakes like a shotgun

Sun! Seth!
Sun! Seth!
God of wind and storms

Protecting sun god from the serpent
Nighttime griever
(But) People used to see me as the embodiment of evil

Solar Barque is going through the underworld
Apep is coming soon
And my red eyes keep the sun god
In a safe vision

[CHORUS]

My spaceship is lifting off
Itï¿½s time to go
Iï¿½m leaving to my outer lands
The Great Bear
Waits for me

I see the sunset coming
Itï¿½s time to go
Iï¿½m leaving to my constellation
(The) Northern sky
Waits for me

Sun! Seth!
Sun! Seth!
God of wind and storms
Sun! Seth!
Sun! Seth!
The image of evil and sin
Sun! Seth!
Sun! Seth!
The god of chaos
