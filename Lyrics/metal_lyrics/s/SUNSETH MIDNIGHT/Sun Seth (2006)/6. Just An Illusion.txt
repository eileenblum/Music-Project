[Music: Ricardo Campos &amp; Roger Lombardi / Lyrics: Ricardo Campos]

Come take my hand
And feel my sorrow
My skin feels you breathe
Too cold to live tomorrow

Oh, my prized
I like the way you touch
My reckless heart

Just words
Just sad tears
Illusions from a naked eye
Just ghosts
Laying on your bedroom floor

Take a look at me now...

Iï¿½m on the road
To nowhereï¿½s end
Call me Mr. Emptiness
Iï¿½m all alone
I fake my name
With a little spookiness
Iï¿½m just an illusion
Live flowing like the wind
See my emptiness
I want you
I need you
But Iï¿½m your Mr. Emptiness
Mr. Emptiness

Come drink my wine
And feel my poison flow
Let it run through your cold white lips
Iï¿½m out for you now

So sweetï¿½
I wish I could tellï¿½
So far, so senselessï¿½

Iï¿½m on my way
My empty trek
Run away (run away)
I warn you
Run away
Go on and fake your love lost
In an empty shell

Just words
Just sad tears
Illusions from a blinded eye
Just ghosts
Laying in your bedroom
Last cold spell

Iï¿½m on the road
To nowhereï¿½s end
Call me Mr. Emptiness
Iï¿½m all alone
I fake my name
With a little spookiness
Iï¿½m just an illusion
Built deep inside your dreams
See my emptiness
I want you
I need you
But Iï¿½m your Mr. Emptiness
Mr. Emptiness...
