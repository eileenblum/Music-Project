[Music &amp; Lyrics: Roger Lombardi]

Iï¿½m leaving
The time to go has come
Donï¿½t fear
My dear, itï¿½s all right

There is no need at all to cry
I know itï¿½s time to say goodbye
But it was fun to play in a good carrousel...
In a good carrousel...

Iï¿½m sorry
Thereï¿½s nothing I can do
My darling
I love you more than life

My eyes become all white and dry
The light is vanishing too fast
But it was fun to play in a good carrousel...
In a good carrousel...
