[Music: Roger Lombardi &amp; Ricardo Campos / Lyrics: Roger Lombardi]

You began to realize
And cried
Not many chances for me
Notï¿½

Itï¿½s kinda hard to understand
Donï¿½t cry
My time is over now
Goodbyeï¿½

Where I belong
The sun will shine upon our faces
Where I belong
Itï¿½s a new time for fantasy

This is the other side
Of life
No fear no problemsï¿½
Anymoreï¿½

[CHORUS]

The wings of death will bring the end
The wings of death will bring the end
The wings of sorrow be no more
The wings of death will bring the end
The wings of death will bring the end
Your sins and sorrows be no more

Itï¿½s time to choose your side
Please, tryï¿½
Not many chances for you
Notï¿½

[CHORUS]
