[Music: Ricardo Campos, Ricardo Batalha &amp; Roger Lombardi / Lyrics: Ricardo Batalha]

Sheï¿½s not innocent!

She has the beauty of the youth
Sheï¿½s always coming back for more
When she laughs
You are there
I have nothing else to say...
Canï¿½t you see whatï¿½s goinï¿½ on?
Youï¿½re only a fool, a toy for fun
Iï¿½m sorry to tellï¿½ ya - oh
Sheï¿½s not innocent!

Sheï¿½s coming back again
Are you ready to go?
Sheï¿½s coming back again
Sheï¿½s not innocent
Sheï¿½s coming back again
Are you ready to go?
Sheï¿½s coming back again
Sheï¿½s not innocent

You have the kindness of a fool
You are in love - Donï¿½t get me wrong
When she cries
You are there
Are you ready to obey?

Sheï¿½s right to take you higher
You want to play with fire
Youï¿½ve got a girl for hire - Bitch!
You are the innocent

[CHORUS]

Iï¿½ve got nothing to say
I ainï¿½t said before
Causeï¿½ itï¿½s better being alone
Than come along with a whore
Sheï¿½s not as shy
As you thought she was
Youï¿½ve got a billion Dollar baby and sheï¿½s begging for more
You are the joke of the day
You have the money to pay
But if you want the girl beware her deadly snare

[CHORUS]
