[Music: Ricardo Campos / Lyrics: Ricardo Campos &amp; Ricardo Batalha]

I donï¿½t wanna cry
And I canï¿½t only sleep
My pain
Needless to say
Iï¿½m here without you
Iï¿½m lost in the air
That breeze I cannot follow
Youï¿½re not mine
But my mouth
Still tastes the wine...

I donï¿½t wanna be like you
I donï¿½t wanna cry for you
And pray
Iï¿½m goinï¿½ away
I hate you darling

Stop haunting me
Deep inside I can feel how love is haunted
Stop haunting me
ï¿½And I canï¿½t pretend anymore

Iï¿½m losing my heart
Flowing like the wind
My pain
Needless to say
I hate you darling
I wish I could tell you
How you made me feel
The worst to date
But my heart
Still bleeds without you...

[CHORUS]

I keep my feelings away
But itï¿½s still, wants to stay
...Itï¿½s you! You!
I wish I could tell... I hate you

Stop haunting me
Deep inside I can feel how love is haunted
Stop haunting me
ï¿½And I canï¿½t pretend...
Stop haunting me
Deep inside I can feel how love is haunted
Stop haunting me
My heartï¿½s still on and now itï¿½s time to go
Stop haunting me
ï¿½And I canï¿½t pretend anymore
