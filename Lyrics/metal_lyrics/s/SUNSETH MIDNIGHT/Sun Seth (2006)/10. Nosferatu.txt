[Music &amp; Lyrics: Ricardo Campos]

Black shivers
Black eyes
Call me at the night time
Black laurels feed my endless love
Youï¿½ve got to meet me, alone in the dusk

And I cry all my river of darkness
Come to me and join the eternal ballet
And let your soul burn, now...

Black wind blows
Black fate grows
In my unnatural lifestyle
Black blood runs through my blackened veins
Youï¿½ve got to meet me, just call my name...

Nosferatu...
Say my name and join my endless dark
Nosferatu...
Dance to me and fill my frightful dreams

Night creepers
Night brides
United for a lifetime
Nightcrawlers smooth your harmless soil
Youï¿½ve got to meet me, like ashes to dust

And I cry all my river of darkness
Come to me and join the eternal ballet
And let your soul burn, now...

[CHORUS]

Come to me...
Come...
