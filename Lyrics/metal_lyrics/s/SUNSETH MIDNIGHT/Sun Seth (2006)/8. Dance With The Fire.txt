[Music: Roger Lombardi / Lyrics: Ricardo Campos &amp; Roger Lombardi]

I was down
And you came
It was hard to believe
So much pain and deceit
But Iï¿½m reborn
Burning
Now Iï¿½m back to retrieve
All the lust lost in grieve

Feel my heartbeat
(Iï¿½m) glad to get your fire burning
Feel my armsï¿½ heat
Fueling your bonfire of hopes
Like a virgin, touch me

Come, dance with the fire of my love
Would you please believe me?
Dance with the fire of my love
Deep inside we burn

All alone
After dark
Like a song out of tune
Like a dream your lips moved
Calling for me
For you...
No remorse, no regrets
No particular care

Only love hurts
When you get too close to feel safe
Only love heals
When you go too far to feel gray
Lonely hearts sweep away

Come, dance with the fire of my love
Would you please believe me?
Dance with the fire of my love
Deep inside you...
Dance with the fire of my love
Would you please believe me?
Dance with the fire of my love
Deep inside we burn

I was down
And you came
And Iï¿½ve got to believe
Thereï¿½s no pain, no deceit
Feel my heartbeat
Burning...
Iï¿½m glad to hold you...

(Iï¿½m) glad to get your fire burning
Feel my armsï¿½ heat
Fueling your bonfire of hopes
Like a virgin, feel me

[CHORUS]
