the nothingness subjugate this world
embrace him and enslave him

the sky is charged by black clouds
indications of fear turns to act
the scream of child is replying in nothingness
clear, bright, longlasting scream

nothingness
nothingness

the dark paths stayed after us
footsteps filled with blood in desert of black sand
here pain lost her meaning

embrance of nithingness
embrance of eternity
