closed in the black cave
so far from the world

life under towns
here is not hate
life without wars
here is not pain

in underground
in underground

closed in the black cave
i heard just echo of bats

in my black hole
i feel here just the dark
neverending silence

in underground
in underground

surrounded by dark
and far away from inhumanity

here doesn't born hate
here doesn't born love
