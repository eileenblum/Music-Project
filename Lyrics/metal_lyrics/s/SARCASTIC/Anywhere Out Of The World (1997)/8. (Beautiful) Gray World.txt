mortal veil feel down on us
scream in agony
mutants and degeneration
deformation of body and soul

forecast of pestilence is confirmed
harmed core of self function

beautiful gray world
beautiful gray world

on every sidewalk the abyss full of our sins
we suffocate with our own remorses
apocalyptic visions
you begin look and instantly avert your eyes
shades of gray are walking on street

everywhere you look, only monotopic action
look straight on our beautiful gray world
optic deceptions in inpure visions
