i see his cynical face
i see his cynical eyes

my sarcastic god
my sarcastic god
my sarcastic god

dissimulation every time, everywhere
dancing fire in his eyes
foreboding is in the air
my god devil die

burning theatre
for my dying god
burning theatre
for my dying god

your sad sarcastic face
your sad red bloody eyes

i feel your pain
you must not die
