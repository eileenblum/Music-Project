The first rays of light fail to reach the ground
Black clouds of ash block the morning sun
The night lingers on though the day has come
A new time begins - time of no one

No hope, no dream, not a single prayer
A thick sulphur mist poisoning the air
The earth shakes and cracks spilling molten rock
Mute screams from lungs seared by acid fog

Slow black rain - skies are falling
Slow black rain - no forgiveness
No hope, no dream, not a single prayer

Now as our world ends
The time of bane transcends
The time of foulest things
Satan spreads his wings

Too late to repent
Infernal torment
Never rest again
Final end - amen

Slow black rain - the time has come for you
