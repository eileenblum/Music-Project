Together alone we walk
Midst the sacrificial lambs
The nameless, faceless, fateless
Together alone we stare in disgust

We bear the burden of knowledge
The aching need to disclose
The truth to be reckoned
Still disbelieved

No other destination
Only the void
All life is bound to dissolve
Into the void
Destination - void

No pity
Only spite
The mindless herd
The swarm of emptiness
Collective ignorance

Accept your destination
Embrace the void
All life is bound to dissolve
Into the void
Destination - void

No light will reach this emptiness
This is the nowhere
No prospect of redemption
No chance to ever end

No comfort of oblivion here
This is the turmoil
Of endless regret of the things
You'll never have again
It's all in vain
Never again

This is the destination
This is the void
This is the dissolution
Void
This is the destitution
This is the void
This is the desperation
Void

Destination - void
Dissolution - void
Destitution - void
Desperation - void
