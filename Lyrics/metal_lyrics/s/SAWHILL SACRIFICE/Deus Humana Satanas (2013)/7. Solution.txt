Mirror mirror on the floor
Sharp shards - the keys to my salvation
Who's the frailest of them all
The protÃ©gÃ© of disconsolation
The face that stares back from the shards
Gives no answer - echoes my distress
The wretched being that dealt my cards
The hand was not dealt for success

They say home is where the heart is
My heart has been dead for years

When you wish upon a star
Each wish will leave a painful scar
No fortune - only distress
Life is made for dying
No order - only chaos
Only one solution

A sharp cut and it's finally there
The doorway to final darkness
Deep red fluid everywhere
I welcome the unawareness
No regret, no going back
No reason why I should exist
As my consciousness fades to black
I only wish I never would have wished

Mirror mirror on the floor

ProtÃ©gÃ© of desperation

A sharp cut - it's finally there
Deep red fluid everywhere
Doorway to final darkness

No regret, no going back
Consciousness fades to black
I welcome the unawareness

When you wish upon a star
