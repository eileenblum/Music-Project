Misguided ones on your sight
Crafting monuments for hypocrite rites
The sacred grove's legacy they overwrite

Heritage they rape and burn
Oblivious of the lesson to be learned
The legacy will have its night
Set on fire the monuments on decisive fight

Behold the justified flames
See them burn down the frames
To liberate man from the bastard's chains

Man with black flame inside
Nature - the absolute guide
Sacred grove's black light
Set the icons of whore all alight
True ancient one from the ashes and flames
Will rise - exterminate the false praise

There is god in man - conception gains
There is god in man - the truth flows in our veins
There is god in man - the heritage remains

Under the northern sky the pagan fire reigns
Gather and fortify sons of the true god's flames
Ride across the blazing horizon
Towards the ancient prosper and wisdom

Black goat's blood shrine
Rise the chalice for a sign
Ascend to bear the burden of the flame
Become the one with no name
The bringer of the black light
Halo, glory, shine
