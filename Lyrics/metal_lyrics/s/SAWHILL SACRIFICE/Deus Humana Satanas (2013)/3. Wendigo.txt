Dead flesh - meal of sin
Make me stronger

Behind every corner
Always one step ahead
Lurking in your closet
Or perhaps hiding under your bed
I can feel your heart beat
You can feel me watching you
Deepest darkest nightmare
Just about to come true

Curse this meal of sin

I feel my power grow
With every stolen soul
Drinking the blood
Making me god

Dark blood - cold and thick
Fill the void - ascend me

Cold touch on your skin
Sorry, this is not a dream
Clawing through your flesh
Laughing at your futile screams
Surrender to your fate
Let the curse take its course
Feasting on your cadaver
Stealing your life force

I feel my hunger grow
With every soul I stole
Drinking your blood
You make me god
