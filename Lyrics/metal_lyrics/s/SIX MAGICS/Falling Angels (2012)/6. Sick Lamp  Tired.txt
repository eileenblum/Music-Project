I've tried to be silent
I've tried to forget
I've been in this uncertainty
Tougher than I thought
Even if I run away it's beside me

I am stronger than I should be
You'll never take my life without a fight
It's my life and I shout it
You'll never take my life without a fight

I don't want this burden
I wanna be weak
I don't need these anymore
Tougher than I thought
Even if I run away it's beside me

This is for the ones who lose all hope
I'm still alive in this world
I'm living my life
My plan is not to die from this

I am stronger than I should be
It's my life and I shout it
You'll never take it from me.
