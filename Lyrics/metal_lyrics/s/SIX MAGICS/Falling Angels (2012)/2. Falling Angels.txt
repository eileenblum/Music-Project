A maniac in action
You look insanely bad
The little circus clown is waiting for his sentence

Now you will hear my dark words
No matter where you are
In the day, in the night
No matter where you are

Missing what you once were
No more lies, no falling angels
Oh, what have you done?
Misery becoming life

Nobody wants the toy knife
You were the common soul
The little child who took the place without a reason

Now you will hear my dark words
No matter where you are
In the day, in the night
No matter where you are

Missing what you once were
No more lies, no falling angels
Oh, what have you done?
Misery becoming life

In silence
In silence
I'll make you hear your conscience
It must be you and me again
It must be you and me again
I'll give you the way to be born again
Meet me at heaven's doors

Missing what you once were
No more lies, no falling angels
Oh, what have you done?
Misery becoming life

Missing what you once were
No more lies, no falling angels
Oh, what have you done?
Misery becoming life
