I'm sick of waiting for the time
This nightmare never set me free
Your time is up their guns are here
The soldiers lead the way home again

Have you seen my old father?
We told you not to hurry
Have you seen my old father?
We told you not to hurry
Have you seen my father?

I'll take another name
I still hear their sad song

I hear a call, nobody there
Their lips won't move I feel the end
Criminal minds oh genocide!
More missing ones more broken wings again

Have you seen my old father?
We told you not to hurry
Have you seen my father?

I'll take another name
I still hear their sad song
Don't blame me for this feeling
The fear of death... no more

Don't shoot lay down your arms
He's just a child, please go away
They shot his father in the back
Let him voice his pain
A slave, the lights are gone
The walls I'll never break
I hear his voice
I'll miss his words
Say my new name, save me!

I'll take another name
I still hear their sad song
Don't blame me for this feeling
The fear of death... no more

I hear his voice
I hear a call, nobody there
I hear his voice
Their lips won't move I feel the end
I hear his voice
I hear a call, nobody there
I hear his voice
Criminal minds oh genocide!
