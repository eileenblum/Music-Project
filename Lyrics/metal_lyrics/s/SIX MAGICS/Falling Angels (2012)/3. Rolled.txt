I know boys don't cry
Even when the life is gone
Silver hair is covering the throne of youth
Trying hard to mend pieces of a broken life
Now I know it's too late to survive

Like a dice you'll be rolled
Symptoms of decay, strength no more
Like a dice you've been rolled
You are growing dimmer in the eyes

Something in the air
Lullaby breeze unsung
I know I'm gonna find my way in life this time
Always in my mind
A memory that will be locked
Every day I will die in its arms

Like a dice you'll be rolled
Symptoms of decay, strength no more
Like a dice you've been rolled
You are growing dimmer in the eyes

There is a time to be born
There is a time to die
There is a time to be born
A time to live

Like a dice you'll be rolled
Symptoms of decay, strength no more
Like a dice you've been rolled
You are growing dimmer in the eyes.
