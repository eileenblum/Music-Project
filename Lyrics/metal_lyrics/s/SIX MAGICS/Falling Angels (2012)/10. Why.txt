One day she told my life will fall again
But she didn't tell me when
Now I'm dying without faith
Without crying

I wake up everynight
My room is damp and dark
My hands are wet and cold
I'm saying why my Lord? Why?

One day you gave me the will to live again
But you didn't tell me when
Mamma!
Now I'm falling look at me
I'm your child

I wake up everynight
My room is damp and dark
My hands are wet and cold
I'm saying why my Lord? Why?

It's like an angel, singing a deadly song
And just the moonlight
All I can see
It's like a tear drop
In a hard winter's night
All sheltered by your hands
All I can feel

I wake up every night
My room is damp and dark
My hands are wet and cold
I'm saying why my Lord? Why?
