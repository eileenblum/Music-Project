To be alone without a soul
Alone
Agonizing I live my life
My sadness here
Pain comes to me
Alone, in this hell
Forgiving myself

How to live
Looking at my past
I feel
All my broken dreams
Never good enough to make them real
Chains of fools
No time, no way
Some voices that call for justice

Everything I don't want to be
I'm just a soul with hidden tears
I had to stop and laugh to myself
I feel the hurt of yesterday
Alone, in this hell
Destruction
It was easier to pretend

How to live
Looking at my past
I feel
All my broken dreams
Never good enough to make them real
Chains of fools
No time, no way
Some voices that call for justice

Destruction!
My life is gone!
Forgiveness!
My curse is gone!

How to live
Looking at my past
I feel
All my broken dreams
Never good enough to make them real
Chains of fools
No time, no way
Some voices that call for justice

Destruction!
My life is gone!
Forgiving myself!
I forgot... how to live!
