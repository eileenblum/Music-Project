I've told myself tonight
The rain and the pain have been here for too much time
I've told myself tonight
I think this feeling is over

Die in peace
It all seems so unfair and dark

It used to be so easy now it's so hard
My very only secret now...
Suicide!

I've seen the bad show again
Adam and Eve are the ones who I don't believe
Tonight leave me alone
I think this feeling is over

Die in peace
It all seems so unfair and dark

It used to be so easy now it's so hard
My very only secret now...
Suicide!

Nightmare, while demons fly
And darkness while angels cry
Nightmare, while demons fly
And darkness while angels cry

Die in peace
It all seems so unfair and dark

It used to be so easy now it's so hard
My very only secret now...
Suicide!
