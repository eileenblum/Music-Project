It's time! Give me something real to change your mind
Tell me when your madness disappeared from your life
Start another war!
Do you wanna go?
We are the problem but nobody wants to see, my friend
You didn't need this
I didn't want this
My hands are tied and my problems are free

It's time! Give me reasons to forget my past
Tell me when the madness of mankind goes away

We have nothing left!
Our lives are dying and we will bury all our dreams
We have nothing left!
We have nothing left and our lives will be forgotten

Live! Live your own desires
Crisis of your life is gone!
Live! Leave the other's dreams
Crisis of your life is gone!

It's time! Give me something that you never gave
Maybe mercy or innocence
Watch another crime!
Should you participate?
Anyway all the crimes are routine
You didn't need this
I didn't want this
My hands are tied and my problems are free
It's time! Give me reasons to forget my past
Tell me when the madness of mankind goes away

We have nothing left!
Our lives are dying and we will bury all our dreams
We have nothing left!
We have nothing left and our lives will be forgotten

Live! Live your own desires
Crisis of your life is gone!
Live! Leave the other's dreams
Crisis of your life is gone!

Die! Die! Die!
Die! Die! Die!
What are we doing for our lives?
What are we conceding for our rights?
Die! Die! Die!
Die! Die! Die!

We have nothing left!
Our lives are dying and we will bury all our dreams
We have nothing left!
We have nothing left and our lives will be forgotten

Live! Live your own desires
Crisis of your life is gone!
Live! Leave the other's dreams
Crisis of your life is gone!
