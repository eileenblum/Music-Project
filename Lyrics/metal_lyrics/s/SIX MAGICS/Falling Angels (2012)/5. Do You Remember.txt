Do you remember the last time we dreamt?
Do you still keep that daydream?

Innocence dying before our eyes
We were so safe every time we played a game

Do you remember?
When we laughed at everything?
After a play time
When there was no fighting
Do you remember?
When our toys were our world?
Now man to man

I wish you could be here
To live a moment from the past
If one is hurt, the other feels the pain

Time to be silly
Our games made no sense
Will you be there to see the thief of life again?

Do you remember?
When we laughed at everything?
After a play time
When there was no fighting
Do you remember?
When our toys were our world?
Now man to man

We changed our lives
Like small adults
Our kind of games
The song we learnt
Now without sound
Deep inside my heart

Childhood is a promise that is never kept
There is always one moment in childhood when the door opens and lets the future in.

Do you remember?
When we laughed at everything?
After a play time
When there was no fighting
Do you remember?
When our toys were our world?
Now man to man.
