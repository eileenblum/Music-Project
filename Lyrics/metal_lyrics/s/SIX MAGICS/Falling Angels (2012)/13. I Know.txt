In my life there is an empty space
The storm in my skin and
The pain of loving you

To love and hate at the same time
The line between the two is fine
Watch me die everyday

Now I want to play from the safe side
Because one of us was wrong
Don't mean the other one was right

You said you'd never let me down
But you make me act like a fool

Where is the friend I had?
Agony inside of my empty heart
You know how to hurt me
To say good bye is the hardest part

This night I think of you without a tear
The fact is that you won't be coming back

You quickly stop the words you start to say
But we both know it must be done this way

Now I want to play from the safe side
I don't want to live with my hands tied
Save me from a lonely life
But you make me act like a fool

Where is the friend I had?
Agony inside of my empty heart
You know how to hurt me
To say good bye is the hardest part

Tell me lies again
Hurt me one more time
You still have the key
Make me act like a fool

Where is the friend I had?
Agony inside of my empty heart
You know how to hurt me
To say good bye is the hardest part.
