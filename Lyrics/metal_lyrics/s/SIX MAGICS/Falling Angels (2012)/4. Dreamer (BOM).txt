They live without a life
Trying to teach you what the rules are
Believe in your own truth
Then what you've decided

Show them your truth
Shout your own law
Tell them how you'll be yourself
Show them your truth
Shout your own law
Their rules are not yours anymore

You're here on your own
Dreaming a dream that is not your world
Justice is just a word
Freedom what you have wanted

Show them your truth
Shout your own law
Tell them how you'll be yourself
Show them your truth
Shout your own law
Their rules are not yours anymore

I see in your eyes
The moments of your life
You see in my eyes
The sadness of mankind

Show them your truth
Shout your own law
Tell them how you'll be yourself
Show them your truth
Shout your own law
Their rules are not yours anymore.
