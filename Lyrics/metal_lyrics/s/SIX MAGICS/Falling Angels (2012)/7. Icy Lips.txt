Another one missing, nobody knew her
Their lies and promises were too convincing
A couple of days and she'll be forgotten
Nobody cares when they'll pay for her...

It's not your fault
Never mind
Their point of view is relative
Nobody knows
Nobody feels
Nobody wants to see
This is your life
Is it right?
Our point of view is relative
Nobody knows
Nobody feels
Nobody wants to see

Dancing in ballrooms you look so pretty
Silent crowds, marionettes, mind control
Why are you sad in that expensive dress?
Where did you come from, where is your life?

Telling lies kissing icy lips
Money can buy your fake love again
Wanna spend another night?
Drinking wine feeling like a queen
Money can't buy it, a fake love is gone
Mirrors on the ceiling

Losing your soul
Your lovely past
Never survive with the money they have
Naked and dying your fake love is gone
Dancing in ballrooms your life is a game

Another one missing, nobody knew you
Silent crowd, marionettes, mind control
A couple of days and you'll be forgotten
Where did you come from, where is your life?
