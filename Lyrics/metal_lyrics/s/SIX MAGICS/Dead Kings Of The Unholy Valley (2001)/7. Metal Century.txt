In the battle
our blood we keep united 
standing tall we face the betrayal

[Bridge:]
Glory we find in the steel 
honor we find in...

[Chorus:]
The melody 
that flows in our veins
rage and the power
steel and the wine
we live in the metal century!
Metal brothers
we have survived through the ages 
sticking together we will sing

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
The melody 
that flows in our veins
rage and the power
steel and the wind
we live in the metal century!

[Both]
[Solo:Nicolas]

[Chorus:]
The melody 
that flows in our veins
thunder and lightning
embrace my sword
we live in the metal century
