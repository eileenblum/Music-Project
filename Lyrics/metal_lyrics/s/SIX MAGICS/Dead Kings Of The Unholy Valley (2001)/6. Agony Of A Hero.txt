[Solo:Nicolas]

Like a hero I am right here
for dead men my triumph is real
Dancing are the spirits and my soul will call
to go for those holy valleys of stone cold

[Solo:Nicolas/Erick]

Never in my life I thought my death
in the purgatory I suffer again
So big my frustration when I think of those days
for so little things I gave my entire life

[Chorus:]
You will not hear my voice 
and my great sword you won't see
only in your memories I'll be
your final day soon will come
My old sword with the death in the steel
riding my black brave horse
my brave warriors side by side with me again
I feel the pride before my eyes
and my sword will not ride again
and all behind me turn black

[Solo:Nicolas/Erick]

Glorified I am right here
for never ending bloody fights
Drowned in my own memories of
war no glory
all the ones who follow me will fall with me

[Chorus]
[Acoustic Guitar: Erick]
