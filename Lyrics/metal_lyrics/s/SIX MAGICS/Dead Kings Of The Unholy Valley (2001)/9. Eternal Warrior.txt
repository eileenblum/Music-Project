In the last reign of the light
the king instructs his beloved son
for he will be the second ruler 
that will bring balance to the light force
Two kings of darkness and sin
have given their lives to the cold hands of death
inside the unholy place
deep in the ground they rest in pain
Two evil clans follow their legacy
the legacy of the dead kings, planning revenge
but in the dark remains a king
and with his fury he will strike
the earth and the light
oh with his army against the light! 

[Chorus:]
To the glory forever
you my son will ride against the evil 
you're the eternal warrior
you will be the last hero
Zerlek the last of the dark dynasty
plans to submit the last hope of life
with his army face the hordes of the light
he fails and he pays for his cruel tirany
The two evil clans take the carcass of the king
and will go to complete the old curse
the soul of Zerlek will rest in this valley
there is one left to complete the dynasty

[Solo:Erick]

[Chorus]
Three knights of the shadows
were choosen by the evil clans 
that will grow eternal pain
they'll kill the king that remains
making the curse that will 
crush the reign of the light
fading away the hope
to all that are-in the town
