[Solo:Erick]

There is a place where
men used to live
a place where the mountains
reach the blue sky
Out of this town
a black dragon lies
time to time a ritual is done
He will guard this holy place
of sinister powers and misery times
looking for a lady
with a clear heart

[Both]
You the great warrior
will have to give
a virgin heart to the
guardian of fire
But this time, your soul choses the light
you won't sacrifice this enchantment that you feel
this wonderful maiden
took your soul away

[Bridge:]
Searching for the way to save
this illusion that you have made 
you fear for your people and the fury to arise

[Chorus:]
Distant old village don't lose your faith in me
don't turn your back again
don't run from your own destiny
and cry out for your pain

[Both]
[Solo:Nicolas/Erick]

The ritual is mine
I suffer for it I believe that I will die
great deep blue lake
you take me back
to the huge glory of my war
All my senses are united
And my blood I will spill

[Solo:Sebastian]

Great warrior brave is your heart
that send me to death in this journey of hate
the great deep blue lake
is turning red

[Bridge:]
Praying for her life the maiden 
knows that she will die this day
crying out with horror in stupor
she will die

[Chorus:]
The sacrifice couldn't stop the drangon's rage
the mystic great warrior
was defeated by the dragon's rage
and his soul rests in pain.
