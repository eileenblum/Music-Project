He was a god, a sacred stone 
his source of power
so many ones have followed you wizard 
Sacred stone keeper of holy light 
Through all the ages
your kingdom will rise
and you forever will be the chosen one 
Those female eyes that made you fall into the darkness
those were the same that took your talisman away
Crystal magic you are my only hope 
I'll cry for freedom
or I will die fighting
my sacred stone my anger is rising 

[Chorus:]
Talisman 
Master of war
your might is far away from here
talisman 
without you now
many of my warriors will die with sorrow 
battles will come with no mercy they will strike 
I can't stand a defeat
[Army:]
Let's march against those hordes united we'll be strong 
I will arrive
they have our talisman for that they'll pay with blood
Two clans were fighting
and one was dying
my warriors standing brave but it was all in vain
the stone was with them

[Solo:Nicolas/Erick/Erick/Both/Nicolas]
[Chorus]
