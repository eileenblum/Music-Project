[Music: E. Avila]

The night is falling
And her wings reborn again
Throw out and hife your bowels
And become a bird
Messenger of the evil, black magic carrier
Server of the wizards
Throw out and hide your bowels
And become a bird

You will fly
To be free for a moment
But your past will be there
Memories will come back
Painful way to avoid real life
Confront you past

Searching for calm
You went to the place.
Place where the wizards live,
Wrong place, horror
You will get tricky answers to your wishes
You've got the power of flying
Now you can evade you pain
Throwing out and hiding you bowels
Your are light,
Now with your wings you reach the sky
You are able to dream and live a different life
You must pay
For you illusion of being free
Cry for help and forget the story
You had your place but it's over
You will be the betraged
You will be the betraged by the wizards
Wrong place, horror
You will get tricky answers to your wishes
You have got the power of...

[Solo: Both]

A wizard provoked the curse,
The sky invited you
You entrails were stolen
And the curse condemned you
A bird you will be forever
Now you will forget and you will be forgotten

A black wizard, the betrayed of your dream
He will turn your dream into a dark nightmare
A black wizard, the betrayed of your dream
He will turn your dream into a dark nightmare

You wish to become human being again
Face your present
You'll never come back to normal life
You wanted to forget for a moment
But that moment turned into eternity

A black wizard, the betrayed of your dream
He will turn your dream into a dark nightmare
A black wizard, the betrayed of your dream
He will turn your dream

You stormy end you will share
You heart will find the rest
You stormy end you will share
You heart will find the rest!
