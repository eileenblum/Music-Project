[Music: E. Avila]

Wretched woman, daughter of vanity
Goddess of a divine race
Lethal mermaid of the seas
Eternal youth rules the ocean
Eternal youth of the southern landscape
Beauty of the golden sand

[Bridge:]
Heiress of the ancient ritual
Sensual dancing of the nakedness
Heiress of the ancient ritual
Takes the soul away from there
Lucky are the men who have never seen her

[Chorus:]
She sends lost souls to the ships
Glory you will win with these hearts
Men touched by your hands
The weight of this cross you will feel
In the lap of her life
He was one more soul
She found him on the sand

[Solo: Both]

She's the one who casts a spell on the men's dreams
Neither veil nor nuptial chant
You are the bride of the seamen
Yoyr zeals of goddess caress their will
Your dancing is macabre and sensual
Perfect mermaid of the waters

Don't be careless
Don't look at her eyes
Lips full of passion and enchantment
Romance between (the) land and the sea
Sinister idyll between waves and sand

[Chorus...]

Another night another singing
Another sailor for the ship,
His right shoulders is paralyzed
And the threartening waves wait for him
He won't be able to survive
I will carry him to his new abode
As one of them he will fly over the sea... forever
