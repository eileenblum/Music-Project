[Music: E. Avila/M. Nader]

Endles anguish haunts you
The deep sea shelters your dream!

Desperated madness blinds you, holds you
In spite of that,
The deep sea shelters your dream!

In the depth I drown my desire,
Desire that turns into a failure
Overwhelmed by your greatness
My illusions shatter like waves against the rocks

Desperated madness blinds you, holds you
In spite of that,
The deep sea shelters your dream!

Far from the sea, my prayers were answered:
A majestic ship that sailed through the ages arrived
The dark forces sent it to me
In my despair I had no choice

[Bridge:]
Damned by your beliefs,
Your life will be eternal in this ghost ship

[Chorus:]
I gave my entire life to sail, my precious dream
Sailing near the island taking souls in sorrow
You have your entire life to sail, your precius dream
Sailing near the island taking souls in sorrow
Destined to haunt through the grey mist
Fear in the eyes that see the great Caleuche!
Destined to haunt through the grey mist
Fear in the eyes that see the great Caleuche!

Desperated madness blinds you, holds you
In spite of that,
The deep sea shelters your dream!

[Solo: Both]

My own flesh despises me
For being selfish and a dreamer
Her voice was my sentence in her dying day
But this was wath I wanted
This I got as her gift

[Bridge...]
[Chorus...]

I will fly across the deep sea
I will fly forever and free
Will the shore the tears have gone
My ship will be my refuge
I will fly across the deep sea
I will fly forever and free
Will the shore the tears have gone
My ship will be my refuge

[Chorus:]
I gave my entire life to sail, my precious dream
Sailing near the island taking souls in sorrow
You have your entire life to sail, your precius dream
Sailing near the island taking souls in sorrow

Desperated madness blinds you, holds you
In spite of that,
The sea possesses you forever
