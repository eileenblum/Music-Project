[Music: G. Hidalgo]

Blinded by the shadow of the undead
I've tried to leave her behind
By running through the night
But the fear remains inside

Beware of
His staring eyes!
Don't lokk back!

I feel a presence beside me
Slithering and singing deadly tunes
You are not alone in this place

Beware of
His staring eyes!
Don't lokk back!

[Bridge:]
Petrified are the ones before me
The basilisk will show no mercy to you

Here I am, drowned in my pain
What could be worse than this endless tragedy?

There is no way to run or hide
My fate is sealed
On this lonely cliff
My fate is sealed
On this lonely cliff
I'll meet my destiny

His staring eyes!
Don't look back!

[Bridge...]
[Chorus...]

Close to the edge
Just before the final leap
He turns around and sees the beast
And feels his shoulder paralysed

A tear falls from his eye
As he worries no more
For he has chosen death
And throws himself into the sea
