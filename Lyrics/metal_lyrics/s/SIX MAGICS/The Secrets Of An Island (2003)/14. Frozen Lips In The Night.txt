[Music: E. Avila]

You had the light in your hands
But it was dispelled in the skies
Now you're here,
In this room surrounded by memories
The cold night covers your dreams
That calm you wounted Soul

Your dream are interrupted
Who is disturbing your damaged heart?
Someone pursues you to stisfy her own pleasure
And without asking why, you fall into her trap

[Bridge:]
Melancholy and desire
Were accompliced
Fear and guilt
Invaded your being
A frightful spectral woman possessed you

[Chorus:]
Loneliness is forever sorrounding
This depressive ghost
Crazy and sad
Desperate woman she is
Lonely men
Frozen lips in the night

Wretched phantom
Beloved you will never be
In vain she will always be waiting for company
Sad punishment to this woman

[Bridge...]

Day break arrived
Yoy wake up from that spell
And when you saw that horrible face
You wanted to leave everything behind
terrified you ran away

[Chorus...]
