Another night and the same singing
Other sailors arrived at the ship
They are brought in the same way I was
Not only my shoulder is paralysed but also my soul
The tragedy of those days comes to my mind over and over again
I should be dead but the old omen damned me to this eternal life
For my disgrace, as one of them I will fly over the sea... forever.
