[Music: E. Avila]

[Trauco:]
Your sacrifice will be my gift

[Woman:]
I guess your repulsive thoughts
Your lover I will never be

[Trauco:]
Don't be afraid. Listen to me!

[Woman:]
Your words make me feel so confused

[Bridge:]
Fear the man who comes across the woods
He will grow on evil seed in you

[Trauco:]
Look into my eyes, you belong to me

[Woman:]
I look into your eyes, i belong to you

[Trauco:]
You will give birth to my son

[Woman:]
I will give birth to our precius son

[Bridge:]
Fear the man who comes across the woods
He will grow on evil seed in you
You'll be condemned for life

[Chorus:]
Island, fear the son of the evil
He's the hater of the men
lover of the forest, he has (the) privilege of
charming virgins
nakedness of the heart, pride, tears
(lover of the forest-nakedness of the heart, pride, tears)

Bitter is the punishment of this innocent lady
Waiting for the unholy day, that day,
Birth of the horrible child

Every night she cries alone
Cursing the man who changed her life
Waitin for the day, that day
Birth of the horrible child

[Solo: Erick/Both/Gabriel]

A new moon noght has arrived
A dark night full of disgrace
Your unwanted son was born
Madness will be the light of your life

[Bridge:]
Fear the man who comes across the woods
He will grow on evil seed in you
You'll be condemned for life

[Chorus...]
