[Music: E. Avila/G. Hidalgo/M. Nader]

Rainy Winters, fertile land
The mother of ohe flowers and trees
Vast the valleys, huge the mountains,
Green the lands in the south of Earth

The large continent
Dismembered and raped
By raging fury
Of the evil one
The strong collision
Between two serpents
Turned this gargerous land
Into a island

The stars are showing that the equinox will come
Uncertain is the future of our land
i have foreseen the truth
The world as we know it will change before our eyes

The large continent
Dismembered and raped
By raging fury
Of the evil one
The strong collision
Between two serpents
Turned this gargerous land
Into a island

[CaicaivilÃª:]
I cam here to claim waht is mine!
We will be crucified!

[CaicaivilÃª:]
Kneel before me, feel my wrath!
I'm CaicaivilÃª
We will be crucified!

I can hear the screams of thousands
While the sea is rising

He's the evil from the sea
And will increase his domains
People are comitting suicide
To avoid the ocean's fury
He's the evil from the sea
And will increase his domains

[Bridge:]
From the mountains high above
The earth is giving a call
Rise from the depth
Our final hope!

[Chorus:]
Gentle spirit helped the people
To scape from the chaos of wrath
Trapped people were transformed into
Seagulls and creatures of the sea

He's the god of fertility
The mountains, he is rising
The lord of the earth
Savior of our land
The evil serpent rises the water
Higher the the mountains
He's the evil from the sea
And will increase his domains

[Brige...]
[Chorus...]

The large continent
Dismembered and raped
By raging fury
Of the evil one
The strong collision
Between two serpents
Turned this gargerous land
Into a island
