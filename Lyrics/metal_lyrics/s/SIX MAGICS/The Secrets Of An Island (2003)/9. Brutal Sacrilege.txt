[Music: E. Avila/S. Carrasco]

[Wizard:]
Our cave will have a keeper

Save him, save him

[Wizard:]
The power of the darkness guides our steps
Under The wickedness of the sorceress
Your son will grow up

[Mother:]
My innocent boy
Is part of my entrails
You will never pervert his childhood

Heartrending scream in the night
The wind says he was given birth
And kidnapped by the shadows,
His mother cried bloody tears,
As a bird of prey the wizard holds the child

[Bridge:]
Keeper of the cave
You will learn to live
Betwitched by wizards
Guardian of the den
Brutal sacrilege
Flesh aberration

[Wizard:]
New blood has been chosen
To hide our secret

Weeping Woman:
Forget this name
You'll never recognize him

[Mother:]
My son belongs to me!
Why does he have to pray!
I cannot stand this defeat

[Chorus:]
She couldn't forget the eyes of her son,
Her pain ended with her life
Suicide was the answer
Twilight of hope

Heartrending scream in the night
Merciful death, desperate choice
Glory of the pagan spectrums

[Bridge...]

[Invunche:]
I am the keeper of the cave!
Enclosed in a monstrous body
Fed with human flesh
Three feet, destiny is full of horror
I am the guardian of the cave!

[Chorus...]
[Solo: Both]
