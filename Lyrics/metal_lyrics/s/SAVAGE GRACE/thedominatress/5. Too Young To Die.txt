The wind in my face drives me back as I'm nearing The edge
A vision of my life's corruption runs through my Head
So many souls have I broken to get where I am
A lonely place in the sun where I can pretend

Too many temptations have lured me
So many illusions betrayed me
And a road of despair lies before me
But I'm too young to die
TOO YOUNG TO DIE

I've made mistakes in my life that I can't defend
I've run out of excuses, I'm nearing my end
Looking down from the top, it's easy to fall
