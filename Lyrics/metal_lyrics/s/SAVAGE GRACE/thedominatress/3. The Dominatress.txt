In the cell below I wait knowing that my painful fate is near
Her silhouette appears, her beauty so disarming, I've no fear
I cry with delight as she unleashes all her fury upon me
Her touch does excite, my body bleeds, but I just beg for more

I know the pain of all who've come before me
I feel the power in her whip as she strikes me
I see the blood in her eyes as she makes me scream
THE DOMINATRESS

My body chained and shackled I beg for mercy as she laughs
The sweet torture takes its toll how I pray to God to let me go
The devil's daughter she may be a sinful sinner's sin for me
Blinded by desire for more blood her caress of leather burns my love
