The fear of darkness fills your eyes
You have no disguise to deceive this new danger
Your heart pounds as it beats
But you cannot defeat the intents of this stranger
Your cold sweat rolls off in streams
You are getting weak, his demands ever greater

Lo, the kiss of death awaits those that have no faith
In the powers that redeem us
Those that ignore the call, they are damned to fall
And they will LIVE TO BURN

The powers of earth that be
Cannot turn the key to unlock all the answers
The secrets of the night will be
The ones that let you see your way into the future
