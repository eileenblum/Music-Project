[Christian Logue]

Destined to forever change, no one lives
To die the same as when they came
Journeys by knights and heroes searching,
Marching, fighting on
To hear truth from God
As we feel the heartache in our darkest
Days of pain learn the lessons from the wise
To survive a thousand lives

[Chorus:]
Tales of mystery, show us the way to find
Our way, tales of mystery guide on

[2nd Verse:]
Legends passed on down through time
Weaved with truths of futures past
We seek to find
Stories of fiery dragons, witches, monsters,
Magic spells
We must forever tell
When you feel the heartache in your darkest
Day of pain let the magic guide you as
You turn another page

[Chorus]

[Lead Break]
