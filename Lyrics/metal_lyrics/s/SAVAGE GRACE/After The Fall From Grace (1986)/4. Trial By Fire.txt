[Brian East]

Disciples of Belial met we
In a silent covey at the dead of night
Chant: Trial by fire
The initiation of blood with the covenant of death
Bind the soul to a compact with hell
Chant: Trial by fire

[Chorus:]
Know not thou of wicked deeds, lascivious
Behaviours and wanton greed
Confess thy sins, purge thy soul, verdict is
Given, cry no more, but bear the sentence of a
Trial by fire
The sentence shall be trial by fire

[2nd Verse:]
Voices raised in a hymn of praise, to the glory
Of abjuration of thy faith
[Chant:] Trial by fire
Eat the flesh of the child's breast and cast
Thy spells with malicious intent
[Chant:] Trial by fire

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Burn witch burn, burn bitch burn
Burn witch burn, burn bitch burn

[Chorus]

Sentenced to be tried by fire
Sentenced to die by fire

Trial by fire
Trial by fire
Trial by fire
