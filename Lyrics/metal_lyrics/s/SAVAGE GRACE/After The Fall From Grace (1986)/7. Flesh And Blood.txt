[Mark Chase Marshall]

A dark reign of ruling upon them, their
Lives full of hope thrown away
Killing life legally, reduction of death in
Perfect race
Taken by force, this world at the mercy
Of man and war

[Chorus:]
Flesh and blood, we are all the same inside
Flesh and blood, we are all the same inside
Six million souls will cry
We will fight to the end

[2nd Verse:]
One mind to bow down to as master, in a body
Of suffering pain
Tortured and beaten by roaches they' re eaten
Living a nightmare, to them just a game
Born to run free
Believing and reaching for what you see

[Chorus]
[Bridge]

[Lead Break]

[3rd Verse:]
The thieves of man' s dignity prosper in their
World of hysterical hate
The lives of the loved ones are trumbled upon,
What gives them the passion to go on and on
Taken by force, this world at the mercy
Of man and war

[Chorus]
