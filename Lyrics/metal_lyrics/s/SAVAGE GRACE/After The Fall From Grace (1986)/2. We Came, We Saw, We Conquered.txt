[Christian Logue]

We are the knights shining in armor
Satisfying desire
A hole in the soul of millions unknown
Void of the feelings we' ve never known
As we look to the stage into heaven
We gaze and our world of pain fades away
But the powers that fear our crusade bring
To bear all the might that their lies can buy

[Chorus:]
And we came, we saw, we conquered
And our call to arms rings on
And we came, we saw, we conquered
And the fire from cities ablaze won't die away

[2nd Verse:]
Power and the glory rits of the holy mesmerize
The masses
Seduced by it all awaiting the call we feel
The essence embrace our soul
In the guys that we take there can be no mistake
We are more than a great escape
None should fear what they know
Nor believe what they' ve told
Let the light of your truth take hold

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
We came to know just we can do when
We let go of our fear
Chant: Have no fear, have no fear
We' ve let our rights be taken away
We believed in their lies
Chant: Give no more, give no more
But we won't let lies stand in our way
And we won' t be bound to any law that fear
Makes us obey

[Lead Break]

[Repeat end of the 1st Verse]
[Chorus]
