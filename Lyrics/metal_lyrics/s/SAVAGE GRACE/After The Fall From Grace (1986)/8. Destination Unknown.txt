[Christian Logue]

Nations rise, nations fall by self - determination
People live
Cultures die, the scythe of progress reaps
Forevermore
Shattered lives, pave their way to ultimate
Salvation
The dark of heart feed their fires of passion
Burning madly for more war

[Chorus:]
And the fools take command, to decide how we
Live, how we die as they need, on the blind
Men lead
Destination unknown, who holds the key to
Find our destiny

[Lead Break]

[2nd Verse:]
As we race toward the edge of global
Self - destruction
Will it be our legacy, to leave this world a
Future without past
Dying lands, born of greed, swell with
Starving masses
The men whose deeds condemn them all, feed
Only their need destroying more

[Chorus]

[Lead Break]

[3rd Verse:]
The time to lie, the time to fear have left us
Without vision
To guide us now, we must somehow let our hearts'
Desire light our way

[Chorus]
