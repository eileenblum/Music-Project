Watching so many nights in the mirror
Knowing my hands killed again
The smell of death lingers around me
And still your fear binds you to the truth

Loving a robber of life bleeds your body
Sharing the guilt for my crimes
Drains your soul
Your young heart
Was once filled with laughter
Now just a void
Filled with pain and despair

You've known me far too long
You can't get away
My crimes of passion you can't betray
The secrets you know won't let you go
You're a prisoner of desperate desire
Fear my way
Fear my way

Watching so many nights in the mirror
Knowing my hands killed again
Your young heart was once filled with laughter
Now just a void
Filled with pain and despair
