I'm a sinner, I'm a fool,
My passion for lust never leaves me.
With my shield, in my blue,
My trap will be sprung upon you
In the moonlight, flesh glows
The object of my cruel desire.
As you scream, beg and plead
I laugh as I punish you harder.

By the day I'm the law, I'm the right.
I'm the fight against evil.
In the night my kiss you'll despise
I'm the terror
I'm the master of disguise
I'm the master of disguise

As I roll on, through the night
Hunting for prey to delight me
Your shape appears, draws me near,
Your body is tried and convicted
Your fate awaits, you can't escape,
Bound by the shackles of justice
My will be done, you must succumb,
To the sentence of sex put upon you.

None will believe, I am the thief,
Stealing virtue from those that I choose.
My path so clear, I am the fear.
I take and I rape with a vengeance.
In the moonlight, flesh glows
The object of my cruel desire.
As you scream, beg and plead
I laugh as I punish you harder.
