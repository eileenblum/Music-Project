So close to the crossroads,
So close to the edge,
To the brink of destruction we are led
Our leaders betray us, their silver in hand
For the sins of their bodies,
Their souls be damned
Lies and deceit fool the masses,
They silence the bold
The truth of the threat to us all,
May never be told

No we can't make the mistake
Not a trace of this race will remain
All the world is at our demand
If we can't end the game there will be no one left to blame
None left to blame

The time to unite is upon us
We'll make our last stand
The roar of our voices
Will shake their command
No hope for the future
No hope for the past
Just pray for the present
It's all that we have
