His heart filled with envy, contempt in his soul
A man with vindictive ambitions beyond his control
Blinded by want and desire his trust bought and sold
His desperate illusions of power never seem to unfold

[Chorus:]
His eyes burn brightly with greed and delight he builds
fortune's from other's despair
He'd sell the soul of his mother for gold
He's the Judas of us all
Betrayer
Betrayer
