All through the night steel by your side
Journey into the darkness beyond southern lights
A mission of vengeance and terror we are the reign
You live by the sword you'll die die by the blade

You stand in my way a fatal mistake
The path of destruction lies lies in your way
Nowhere to run the nightmare is real
There's no way escaping the wrath the wrath of my steel

You live by the sword you'll die by the blade
Stand for the fight your life I will take
You'll die by the blade

On into the night steel by your side
Journey into the darkness beyond southern lights
A mission of vengeance and terror we are the reign
You live by the sword you'll die die by the blade
