[Verse:]
I don't know 'bout this situation
You seem so carefree and shameless
Earning his infatuation
While I'm left alone wooried sleepless

You drown in a sea of confusion
A junkyard of anger and sadness
Don't know if it's just an illusion
Cuz all that seems real is just madness

You're seeking to find liberation
From all that has bothered your mind

[Refrain:]
Open your eyes, and break off the chains of temptation
It's all plain to see
Open your eyes, our lives could be full of sensation
For you and for me all the time

[Verse:]
You think this life's overrated
Too numb to feel any passion
Drugs made your life complicated
Cuz booze is no longer the fashion

Pull yourself out of seclusion
Free up some space in your mind

[Refrain:]
Open your eyes, and break off the chains of temptation
It's all plain to see
No more disguise, join all the rest of creation
Surrender to me
Open your eyes, our lives could be full of sensation
For you and for me all the time
