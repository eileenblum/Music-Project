[Verse:]
She is a lonely hunter
a dancing queen
She needs satisfaction
she needs to be free
so don't mind if you're not
the one tomake her day yeah

[Bridge:]
She makes the decisions
and thinks she's right
And if you remind her
She starts to fight
Be careful 'cause she can turn upside down

[Refrain:]
Do you know that she cheated me all time
I was always true
Do you know it was she who broke the line
Poor fool you! Do you know?

[Verse:]
You think that you are the winner
You caught her heart
Believe me, you cannot keep her 'cause she is too smart
she takes your pride and throws it in the trash
