[Verse:]
I know taht it's a long ago; I've tried to find a way...
I still can't believe what you've done
Now I know that I'm off the track, opened up my eyes
I don't know why I should thake the blame

What is the reason you left it all behind
Only your true words can ease my pain inside

[Refrain:]
Tell me how it feels to be on your own at night
Can you ever close your eyes again?
Tell me how it feels awake, knowing you're not right?
Yeah I guess that you just wouldn't show!.. You just wouldn't show...

[Verse:]
You'll see in a little while your blue-eyed charm is gone
And there will be no one left around

What is the reason for telling all these lies?
You cannot imagine what you compromise!

[Refrain:]
Tell me how it feels to be on your own at night
Can you ever close your eyes again?
Tell me how it feels awake, knowing you're not right?
Yeah I guess that you just wouldn't show!

[Verse:]
Baby I just wonder why you're still in my heart
You filled my life with sadness, but you'll always be a part, forever and ever!

[Refrain:]
Tell me how it feels to be on your own at night
Can you ever close your eyes again?
Tell me how it feels awake, knowing you're not right?
Yeah I guess that you just wouldn't show!.. You just wouldn't show...

'Cause I know how it fells to be on my own at night
I will never close my eyes again!
I know how it feels awake knowing you're not right!
And I wish you'd feel the way I do!
