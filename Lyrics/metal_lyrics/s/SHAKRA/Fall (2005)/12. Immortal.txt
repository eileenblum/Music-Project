[Verse:]
Hear the tale of my lonely life, of emptinesswithout caress
Born thousands of years ago, but I cant't die, I don't know why...

When I look in the mirror it is not me - there's just a young man...
I raise my hands, I am praying that no new day will come

[Refrain:]
I don't wanna believe my eyes - forever young - forever strong...
I just wanna leave this life - I'm all alone - time's moving on...

[Verse:]
All I need is a little chance to hold you close until the end
But someday you'll be grey and old - and I'll move on before you're gone...

I don't wanna be lonely, but I have to - world's growing older...
Take my hand and I'll follow the border - till dawn...

[Refrain:]
I don't wanna believe my eyes - forever young - forever strong...
I just wanna leave this life - I'm all alone - n' time's moving
