[Verse:]
If you can't forget your soorows
seek the darkest place in your soul
Face the reason and you will
find your way back home

[Bridge:]
Be prepared the truth lies inside you
It could be that you're not that strong
It's the only chance, you can break through
Or the winter will be long

[Refrain:]
When the leaves are falling
Take good care
Be carefull what you do
When the leaves are falling
It could be they cover everything around the tree

[Verse:]
It's a long and lonely journey
Through the valleys of your heart
And there's no one who can
show you where to go

[Bridge]

[Refrain]
