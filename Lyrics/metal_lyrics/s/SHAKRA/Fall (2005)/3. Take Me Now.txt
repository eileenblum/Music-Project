[Verse:]
I'm driving lonely, I'll soon be there
Another night, still no one wants to share
I wanna feel you oh right now
And you wanna say "I will never let you go!"

[Bridge:]
I wanna feel you woman, yeah I really do now
Let me feel you woman, gonna get it on!

[Refrain:]
Take me now, feel my hardness in you
That's the way our love has to be
Take me now, feel my hardness babe, take me now, feel my hardness, babe
Take me now, feel my hardness in you, oh yeah!
