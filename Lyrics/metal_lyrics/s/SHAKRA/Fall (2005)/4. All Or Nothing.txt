I've seen a million faces
All around the world
They told a million stories
There's none I haven't heard

I crossed the mighty rivers
I've seen the darkest skies
Untangled every jungle
What is there left to find?

Ain't easy to impress me
You know that

[Refrain:]
I want all there is or nothing
And just the will do
I want it now, can't wait no longer
So here I am
I want just the finest diamonds
Hand it all to me right now
I want all you got or nothing
Here I am

[Verse:]
I've senn a thousand places
I sailed the seven seas
I roamed the deepest canyons
Still ain't enough for me

I bought a ticket
Just the other week

It ain't easy to impress me
And you know that
