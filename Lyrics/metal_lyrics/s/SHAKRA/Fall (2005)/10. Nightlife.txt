[Verse:]
Everyday seems like a repetition
Like a daily soap on MTV
I think it is time for a decision
Triteness ain't no longer fun for me

[Refrain:]
Ready for the nightlife?
Ready to loose your brain again
We're gonna have a good time, let's go insane
Ready for the nightlife?
Ready to loose your brain again
Now the time is right to go insane

[Verse:]
You look like you need a variation
like you need a little change of air
i can try to serve your expectation
Your whole life awaits you right out there
