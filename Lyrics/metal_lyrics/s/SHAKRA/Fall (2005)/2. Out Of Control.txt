[Verse:]
Don't need no reason for my crime
A pain reaction making fine
I am a demon, I break the law
Give me your fever 'cause I need it now

I am the shadow that comes from behind
When you are alone in the dark

[Refrain:]
Out of Control, I won't let you go
I take the light that burns in your soul
Out of Control, I won't let you go
Tell me a reason I already know

[Verse:]
Don't try to stop me I'm on my way
Don't try to move me 'cause here's the place to stay
I don't believe in what others say
Don't yell "keep quiet" or you're gonna pay
