Just like a little boy
Who wants to smash his toys
I pushed it all to the limit
I felt like paralyzed
Could not receive your signs
Just had no feeling for nothing

Now there's a fire
Burnin' in my eyes
I realize
How much I missed that spice

I'm comin' back
Grabbin' my guitar
So here I am
We try a brand new start

Because that's
All that I want
All that I need
And I will be screamin' again

So many times I tried
The shore was out of sight
Thought I'd be swimmin' forever
But if you keep your dreams
And fight against the stream
Nothin' can stop you whatever

And there's a fire
Burnin' in my eyes
I realize
How much I missed that spice

And now I' m back
Grabbin' my guitar
So here I am
We try a brand new start

Because that's.....
