Our love is a wild game
Burning like a hot flame
N' when I touch your skin that's my sin
'Cause my family is waitin' for me

Late at night I'm driving home
Looking for an alibi
Asking myself what I should do
When I hear it again

When the Phone rings twice
You set my heart on fire
When the phone rings twice
Our sign of desire

My heart beats faster
That's my disaster
Like a yo-yo on a string when you ring
I come under your control

Once again I'm driving home
The door is closed and I'm alone
Asking myself what I should do
I'm driving back to you

When the Phone rings twice
You set my heart on fire
When the phone rings twice
Our sign of desire
When the Phone rings twice...
