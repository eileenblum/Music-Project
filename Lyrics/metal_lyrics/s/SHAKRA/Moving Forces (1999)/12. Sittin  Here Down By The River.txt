Where we used to play as kids
Didn't think about tomorrow
Didn't care about a thing

But my smilin' turned to cryin'
All those struggles in my head
Oh if I could only lie there
In the comfort of my bed

Tell me why I feel this way
I'll never understand
But there's one thing I know for sure
I want to live again

Time - it takes a little time
To ease the pain inside
To wash my tears away
Time - it takes a little time
Until the ache subsides
Until I smile again like a child

Little circles on the water
From the tears I hide behind
See my lifeless face reflecting
And can't believe it's mine

Where's the joy I felt before
The glowing in my eyes
I gotta get it back again
And find some peace of mind

Time it takes a little time.....
