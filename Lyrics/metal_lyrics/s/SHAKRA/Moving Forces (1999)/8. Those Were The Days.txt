Was all by myself in never never land
Searching my soul in the desert sand

Memories of the past
Trying to show me the way
But I was too blind to see
And much too afraid

Those were the days
When I was going nowhere
Those were the days
When I had nothing to share

Sitting in the park listening to the sound
Of dreamtime dreams that I never found

Like a hunted wolf on the run
I fled from myself
Running after the sun
Not even thinking twice - don't think twice

Those were the days...

Sitting in the park listening to the sound
Of dreamtime dreams and I'm still around

Memories of the past
Show me the way
Then with my open heart
I'm not afraid - not afraid

Gone are the days
When I was going nowhere
Long gone the days
When I had nothing to share

'Cause nowadays
I am going somewhere
And nowadays
I've got something to share
