I've been on the run
Always on the move
Travelled all around the globe
With nothing left to lose

I've been high and low
Floating with the tide
Many times I've loved and lost
And many times I've cried

Sometimes I wished
I had somewhere to go
Someone to love after all
But I know...

All my money
Can't buy me love
All my money
Is not enough
To buy me love

I've seen paradise
Knocking on it's doors
Lovely voices answering
We're temporarily closed

I've heard angels sing
And I've seen fairies dance
Many times I've sold my soul
For a bitter-sweet romance

Sometimes I wished
I had somewhere to go
Someone to love after all
But I know...

All my money
Can't buy me love
All my money
Is not enough
To buy me love
