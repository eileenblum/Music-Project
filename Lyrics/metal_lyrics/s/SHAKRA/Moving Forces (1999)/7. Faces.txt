Sammy Jo was an ordinary girl
Had ordinary dreams and hopes
And a proper place to stay
What made her crack nobody really knows
When she ran away from home
She threw it all away

Oh see the rainbow there
Oh colours everywhere

I see those faces
Showing all those traces
Of a million tears
Cried over long lost years
Glitter and glory
It's the same old
Things ain't what they seem
And you can't live on dreams
Do you know what I mean

Jamie Lee was an ordinary guy
Lived an ordinary life
In only black and white
Why he changed his mind nobody knows
Now he roams the streets at night
Always hiding from the light

Oh see the rainbow there
Oh colours everywhere

I see those faces...

I see your face
And feel your warm embrace
And I have no fear
As long as you are there
Glitter and glory
Yeah I know that story
But I know what's true
And I'll hang on to you

As I see your face
And feel your warm embrace
I know what's true
And I'll hang on to you
Hanging on to you

I see those faces...
