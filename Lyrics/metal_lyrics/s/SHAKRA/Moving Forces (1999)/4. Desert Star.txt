Mirror mirror tell me what you see
You've known that guy
For maybe fifteen years
You've seen him laugh
You've seen him cry
You've seen him kiss
Love and life goodbye

Now ain't it time to make a change
Ain't it better than to go insane
Must I fight reality
To be the man I really wanna be

Now in my dreams I've seen
A place where I will go
To heal my heart and free
My soul and make me whole
That's where I belong

Desert star - be my guide
Out of town into a new day's light
Desert rain - wash away
Sins and sorrow - make me feel okay

Many nights and bloody many days
I followed the rules before I lost my way
Getting up and working really hard
Always dreaming of a brand new start

Now in my dreams...

Desert star - be my guide
Out of town into a new day's light
Desert rain - wash away
Sins and sorrow - make me feel okay
