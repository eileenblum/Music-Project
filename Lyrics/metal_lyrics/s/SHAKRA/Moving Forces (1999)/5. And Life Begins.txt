Look at the children
And see those hopeful eyes
Look at your brother
A friend for all your life

All these people here around me
I'm lovin' more and more
Now I understand what we're livin' for

Like an eagle in the sky
Spread my wings and fly
And I'm sailin' on the wind
My eyes won't miss a thing
And life begins

Look at the valleys
Flowers everywhere
Look at the mountains
So proud they're standing there

All those precious real creations
I've never seen before
Now I understand what we're livin' for

Like an eagle in the sky
Spread my wings and fly
And I'm sailin' on the wind
My eyes won't miss a thing

Like an eagle in the sky
Spread my wings and fly
And I'm ridin' on the wind
And a new life begins

When the rain is fallin'
And the end is not in sight
I just spread my wings and fly again
To the rainbow in the sky
