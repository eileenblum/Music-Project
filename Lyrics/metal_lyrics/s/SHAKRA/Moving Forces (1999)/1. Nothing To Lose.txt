Out in the desert
Where the lights never fade
We had to stop for the night
Walked down the strip
Temptation all around
Oh god how could I resist

I always take a chance
And roll the dice
Cuz all we do
Is just a game

So many ways-To win or to lose
We've got nothing-Nothing to lose
So many ways-To win or to lose
We keep on tryin'-That's what we choose

We made our way
Back to the Hollywood-sign
Where dreams and hopes unite
Where angels die
And stars are risin' high
Where only the best survive

I always take a chance
And roll the dice
Cuz all we do
Is just a game

So many ways - To win or to lose
We've got nothing - Nothing to lose
So many ways - To win or to lose
We keep on walkin' - The way that we choose
