We all live on this planet
Giant gentle and blue
We breathe and walk and wonder
A place for me and you

Why is it that I wake up
To a new day's light
And how come the starlight
Shines so bright tonight

Tell me bout that wonder
How long can it last
The sun we're living under
Is burning much too fast

We've come a long way searching
For what we think is true
Big machines and bigger dreams
Big illusions too

Every beast we've mastered
Every sea we've sailed
Every fortress conquered
Yet I think we failed

Tell me bout that wonder
How long can it last
The sun we're living under
Is burning much too fast
Tell me bout that wonder...
