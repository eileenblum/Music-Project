More than seven years went by
Since you left the scene
Time enough to think about
What you've done to me

Yesterday I heard you're back
Back in town again
You asked my friends where I live
If my number's still the same

Thinkin' of the times we used to spend
All those little lies you used to tell

Don't try to call me anymore
I don't need your lies
Don't try to call me anymore
Little devil in disguise

I was really enslaved by you
Led by your command
Could not read between the lines
No matter what you said

Now that seems so long ago
Girl I changed my ways
You got your life and I got mine
There's nothin' left to say

Thinkin' of the times we used to spend
Thinkin' of the crap you used to tell

Don't try to call me anymore...
