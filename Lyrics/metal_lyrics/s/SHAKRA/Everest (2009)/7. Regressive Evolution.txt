For millions of years people grew along
We made a big progression
N' every wrong we inverted to right
That makes us better than creatures

But what are we doing now?
We hate without a reason
Takin' a downward trend
Yes we're just mammals, but mammals that brag

Show me now, explain it now, I just can't conceive
Come on and show me now, prove it now
Cause there's no reason for regressive evolution

We are bombing away what we've built with sweat
Follow chiefs 'cause we chose them
We are longing for things that we just can't get
For things that others just show off

See what we're doing now?
We kill without a reason
Takin' a downward trend
Yes we're just mammals, but mammals that brag
