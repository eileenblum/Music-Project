Buddy, so you think you got it under control
You're gonna find out the hard way
Nobody's gonna give you the time of the day
Nothing in life is for free hey

You think you need to do it all right
But you're too stupid to know how

It's all for the money
You'd do anything for it
You really earned it now
Cause it's all dirty money
And you need it obviously
How 'bout a little more

So you look for sugar but you just get the whip
You made a choice, gotta eat it
That wretched sorry look won't help you out now
I hope you get what you needed
