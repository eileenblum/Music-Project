I've been a fool, I see it
You're not the friend I knew
You know me well, you could do better
A great show you pulled off my friend
I almost missed the cue
It's written on the wall in great big letters

Don't need you no more
I made it on my own
Right between the eyes
I got the bullet of your sweetest lies
Saw through your disguise
Don't need you no more

I hope I learned my lesson
My trust is hard to earn
I won't be blinded by those slick words
You need to prove to me now
It's really what you mean
And I won't be fooled just by what I heard

Don't need you no more
I made it on my own
Just myself to blame
Duped by your smooth game
Right between the eyes
I got the bullet of your sweetest lies
Saw through your disguise
Don't need you no more

I should have known it better, I got myself to blame
Fool me that one time the shame's on me
If you fool me twice, then the shame's on you
And surely all of them will finally see
