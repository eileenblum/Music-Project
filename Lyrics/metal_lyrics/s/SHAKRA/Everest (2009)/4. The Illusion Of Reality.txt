Reality seems far away
Noise in my head is here to stay
Long for silence and shades of gray
Lines and edges seem to fray

Feels like a long cold winter in my numb mind
Cold and hard and so goddamned unkind

I learned so much I don't really need
My teachers just filled my head indeed
Illusion takes over fantasy
Couldn't get much higher, higher on me

Is there a way out of this trap
I've had enough of this cheap crap
Tired of always taking the rap
No more aces in my stack
