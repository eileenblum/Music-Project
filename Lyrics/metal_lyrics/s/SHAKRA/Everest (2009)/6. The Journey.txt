Everything is frightening
Everything's averse
No one gives a reason
For this aggrieving curse

No one gives you shelter
Or just a helping hand
Who cares about your troubles
Trapped in your own world

Needed just a piece of me
Now you go your own way
Needed just one great thought in life
To make you strong to carry on

Strive on, grab your wings and fly on
Open up your eyes and realise there's skies
Strive on, though the world gets you wrong
Cease with your own lies, it's worth to pay the price

Once you were a winner
Unattainable
You'd climb the highest mountain
Absurd to think you'd fall

Nothing last forever
But everybody tries
The journey is your fortune
The path is your main goal

Needed just a piece of me
Now you go your own way
Needed just one great thought in your life
I tried to give you more than this
N' you took more and more
You sucked all my energy
To make you strong to carry on
