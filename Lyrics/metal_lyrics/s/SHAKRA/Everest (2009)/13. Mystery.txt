[Bonus track]

I'll never know, it's a mystery
The man in you, don't know 'bout me
My female side, don't care 'bout you
No wonder it don't jell, what are we to do

Why do we try, why do we cry
Believing in everlasting love
Giving it all, waiting to fall
Thinking we can change the world
We cannot change the world

Try not to show, how we really feel
Head held up high, 'cause it's no big deal
The show goes on and my heart's for sale
Nobody gives a damn about my sorry tale
