Now that you have set me free I will let you go
Time for me to move right on, you see
Now don't you cry, please smile for me, fate has struck once more
The truth is it was never meant to be

Looking at my heart, it's a brand new start
Heading for your love, flying like a dove
Homing in on you, nothing I can do
Now I'm trying, trying to forget

Gone are all those distant dreams, they will stay that way
Damned in hopeless fear and pain, it seems
I'm tired of playing this sad game, hope I'll see the day
That love don't mean you have to feel the pain
