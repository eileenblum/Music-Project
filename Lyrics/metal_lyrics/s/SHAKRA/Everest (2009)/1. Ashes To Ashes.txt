Lurking, waiting
Seeking for your smell
Feelings rising
I fell under your spell

Dreaming of a life with you
And you don't give a damn

'Cause when I die I go to heaven
And if it's hell I'll take that too
Someday, I know, we'll be together
Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust

Won't you taste me
I know what you need
Can't you trust me
I would just exceed

Don't you feel just like I do
Who cares, it's all the same
