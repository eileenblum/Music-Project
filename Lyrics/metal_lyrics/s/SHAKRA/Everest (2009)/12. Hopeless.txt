Don't con me Baby
It was such a good time
The reason's forgotten
There's no reason at all

Now here I stand, reach for your hand
And I give in, in to the final sin
Is all I get, just what I deserve?
I'm feeling' hopeless, in despair

Led to believe in those lies
How I miss those clear blue skies
And more than that my guardian Angel
But I know I won't make history

I know it's hard to lose control, I know it's hard to lose control
You really think you're all alone, believe it's true you're on your own

I've been a fool, a little tool
I tried it all and I replied each call
So this is all, all I deserve
I'm feeling hopeless, in despair
