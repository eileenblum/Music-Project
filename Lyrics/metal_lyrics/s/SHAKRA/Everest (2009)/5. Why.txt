I am all alone
No one to call my own
Death comes as release
Give me shelter please

You were my temptation
Resistless cunning Eve
Now where's your ray of hope
You turned it to a soap

N' how could I believe
Our love will last forever
You took me by assault
To palter with my heart

Why'd you cross this final line
I thought that you were mine
And now it's just goodbye
Why'd you play this bad charade
Our fairy tale will fade
Without givin' a try
Tell me why

Bygone times fade slowly
Aching more and more
All persuaded cause
Just raises more doubt

I have to stand aside
No chance for a reaction
Cause' now our destiny
Lies in your little hands
