Another lonely morning
You lay beside me dreaming your reality
You told me 'bout your sorrows
And so that's why you flee into insanity

I'm gonna have my time without you now
I'm gonna have some fun without you now
I know the price to pay, no longer can I stay
You are the reason why the time has come right now for me

You know that I've got patience
I'm not the kind of guy that pussies off and flees
You treat me like your hostage
And that's an easy way to put the blame on me
