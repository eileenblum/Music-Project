I've been sailing for so long and
Hunted for that guidin' light
Was driftin' in murky waters
Desiring stars to make landfall

Don't you know that I was seeking for aid
I hope you are satisfied!
Ain't it clear I crave for some attention
Show me the sunny side

Is anybody out there? Is anybody reaching for my soul?
Is anybody out there? Please call my name

The wind blows cold as the night gets darker
New moon hides his face in shame
Do you believe that it would heal itself
Did you think I'd just take it all
I'm sick of rolling with your punches
Taking all the bloody blame
