You thirteen year old sweet little thing
I am the boy of your dreams
Tell me how old you want me to be
Why don't we meet in secrecy?

I won't show you my picture just for now
You will be surprised by who I am

Let me lie my life to you
Just believe my tales are true
I promise it will be all right
Let me join you for a night

I'll pick you up with my brand new car
I know a wonderful place
I'll show you things you've never seen before
And I am sure we'll enjoy it

We are two of a kind in this pure world
I can hardly wait to see you for real

Let me lie my life to you
Just believe my tales are true
Won't we play a little game?
Ain't it funny we're the same!
