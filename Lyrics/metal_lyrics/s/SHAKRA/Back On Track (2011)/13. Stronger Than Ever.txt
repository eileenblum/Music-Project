[Music: Muster/Blunier/Prakesh]
[Words: Pfister]

People telling me
How I have to be
All I do seems wrong
This just canât go on

What about believing?
Look into my eyes

Canât you see it?
(Iâm stronger)
Canât you feel it?
(Than ever)

Yes, I really know where I will go
What I wanna do with my life and I know
That I am okay, Iâll go my way
So donât try to stop me no more

I am not the one
That I used to be
All my fears are gone
Finally Iâm free

I donât need no hiding
This is who I am

Canât you see it?
(Iâm stronger)
Canât you feel it?
(Than ever)

Yes, I really know where I will go
What I wanna do with my life and I know
That I am okay, Iâll go my way
So donât try to stop me no more
