Hey! My dear mate!
What is the matter?
Have you laid your guns?
Come on tell me
What is the problem?
Leave it all behind
Do you think Iâll let you down?
Do you think youâre losing ground?
No more hiding, no pretending
Show them who you are

Breaking free to the limit
Fill your lungs with pride
Spread your wings
Donât be timid
Get back into the light

Get along on the right lines
Yeah! Youâll be fine
Take control, take the high road
Yeah! You will rise
Youâll be alright
Be true, be you

Hey! My buddy!
What is the matter?
Wake up from your sleep
Break your demons and pray for deliverance
Try to keep the course
Do you think Iâll let you down?
Do you think youâre losing ground?
You donât have to stay in that shadow
Youâre so beautiful

Breaking free to the limit
Fill your lungs with pride
Spread your wings
Donât be timid
Get back into the light

Get along on the right lines
Yeah! Youâll be fine
Take control, take the high road
Yeah! You will rise
Youâll be alright
Be true, be you
