[Words: Prakesh]

Tell me the reason why I had to go
Mother, I just wanna know
Ainât gonna hate you
Ainât gonna blame you
Iâve got the right for a clue

Tell me who am I?
Iâm torn inside
Feeling incomplete
I lost my sight

Iâll be finding the ugly truth
Iâll be hunting for any proof
Iâll be fighting until the last
And Iâll be searching for my past

This is a journey of finding myself
Wishing to be someone else
Always believed in good things in life
This time it cuts like a knife

Tell me who am I?
Iâm torn inside
Feeling incomplete
I lost my sight

Iâll be finding the ugly truth
Iâll be hunting for any proof
Iâll be fighting until the last
And Iâll be searching for my past
