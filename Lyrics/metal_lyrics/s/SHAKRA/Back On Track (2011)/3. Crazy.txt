[Words: Prakesh]

You knock me out, babe, all I feel
Nobody would make it
Iâve got no doubts honâs, itâs real
Nobody could break it
Everythingâs really upside down
Letâs take just another round
Iâve never felt like this before
Iâm begging for more

Youâre fuckinâ crazy
Thatâs what I want
Youâre fuckinâ crazy
Thatâs all I need
Nothing more

You look so hot, cute, dressed to kill
No one minds, no bother
I need the change, you need the thrill
Weâre meant for each other
Everythingâs really upside down
Letâs take just another round
You got me on my knees
Youâre all my disease

Youâre fuckinâ crazy
Thatâs what I want
Youâre fuckinâ crazy
Thatâs all I need
Nothing more
