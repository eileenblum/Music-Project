[Words: Prakesh]

After all Iâm going back to the star
Deep inside I know itâs getting so hard
First I have to learn to walk by myself
I wonât ask for someone elseâs help

Drying tears I wanna cut a chord
I close my eyes nâ letting myself go

Let me find a place
Where I can breeze along
Show me the way
For gettinâ on the run
Iâm setting firm goals
May it purges my soul
Someday somehow
I will find my way back home

I have crept along this one-way-street
Iâm so wiped out need some space to breathe
No one knows where I will be tomorrow
Iâll break away from all these gloomy sorrows

Drying tears I wanna cut a chord
I close my eyes nâ letting myself go

Let me find a place
Where I can breeze along
Show me the way
For gettinâ on the run
Iâm setting firm goals
May it purges my soul
Someday somehow
I will find my way back home
