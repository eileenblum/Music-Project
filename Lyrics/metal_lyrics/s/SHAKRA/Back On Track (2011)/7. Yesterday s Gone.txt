Days were running, days of pain
I was afraid of new mornings to come
So many lies, so many tears
So many evenings I thought itâs not real
Iâve been losing faith in myself
But times will be changing itâll be over soon
Iâm burning, fighting, screaming like hell
Donât wanna know whatâs the truth

Itâs alright, itâs okay
Itâs like the first day of my life
Washing away all the tears that I was crying
Itâs alright, itâs okay
Itâs like the first breath of my life
Blowing away all the clouds before itâs raining
âCause yesterdayâs gone

Times are changing, life is fair
All that we give we get back in some way
So much hope, so much joy
So much pride inside our hearts
And when we are thinking of what we went through
We donât feel no anger, no pain anymore
Weâre stronger, harder than ever before
Donât wanna know whatâs the truth

Itâs alright, itâs okay
Itâs like the first day of my life
Washing away all the tears that I was crying
Itâs alright, itâs okay
Itâs like the first breath of my life
Blowing away all the clouds before itâs raining
âCause yesterdayâs gone
