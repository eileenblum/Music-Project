[Words: Prakesh]

Nothing gets us down
Moving all around
Making all with drive
Itâs great to be alive
Liberty is calling
Heading for the signs

âCause weâre not dead
We are back!

Yes, weâre back on track
Walking tall
Itâs the perfect match
Freedom call
Yes, weâre back on track
No more slain
Itâs the perfect match

Our day has come
Straight on number one
We play our cards right
Gonna blow your mind
Back in the ring again
Downers took an end

âCause weâre not dead
We are back!

Yes, weâre back on track
Walking tall
Itâs the perfect match
Freedom call
Yes, weâre back on track
No more slain
Itâs the perfect match
