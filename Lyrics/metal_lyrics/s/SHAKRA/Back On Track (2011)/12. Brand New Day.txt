[Music: Blunier/Prakesh]
[Words: Pfister]

Late that night we had a situation
Like a vicious circle where there is no end
In such moments there is no wrong or right
All we know is we want to end the fight
Time to rest our minds
Time to close our eyes

âCause the sun will shine again
When there comes a brand new day
Even when thereâs trouble now and then
Thereâs always a way for us

Late last night we had a situation
But today it seems that love is in the air
In such moments when everything is nice
All we need is our love that feels so right
Time to realize
Weâve found paradise

And the sun will shine again
When there comes a brand new day
Even when thereâs trouble now and then
Thereâs always a way for us
