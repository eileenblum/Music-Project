[Words: Pfister]

If you feel like youâre forgotten and alone
Call me Iâm your friend till the very end
If you pay me well Iâll soon be here to tell
Youâre the very best, better than the rest

Money is what you need
To make the world go round and round
(My friend and)
In this world nothingâs free
For Money Makes The World Go Round!

We will never fight âtil 3 oâclock at night
Money makes me do all you want me to
Shall I be the brother that you never had?
Or your drinking mate gonna take my fate

Money is what you need
To make the world go round and round
(My friend and)
In this world nothingâs free
For Money Makes The World Go Round!
