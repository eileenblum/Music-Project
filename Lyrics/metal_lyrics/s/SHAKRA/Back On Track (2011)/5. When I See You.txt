When it comes to love
Sometimes it can be tough
But somehow we got
Never quite enough

I know I can rely on you
You can rely on me
So our journey can go on
I really feel we canât go wrong

When I see you I just wanna hold you
I want you to know that I really care
When I feel your heart beat while I hold you
I will do the best to be your loving man

I donât need too much
To get myself through life
Music and love is what
Makes me feel alive

I sacrifice to find a way
How I can make your day
For my love for you is real
Thatâs why I tell you how I feel

I will be there to catch your fall
When you really need me
When the weight of the world in on my shoulders
I will be there to share with you
Moments to remember
Moments we can hold on to last forever
