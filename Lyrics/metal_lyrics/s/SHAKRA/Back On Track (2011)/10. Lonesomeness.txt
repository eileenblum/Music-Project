[Words: Prakesh]

I remember it clearly when we met the first time
And your smile has been tempting
Youâve taken my breath
But itâs become colder our love on the edge
And the world treats me badly a bittersweet taste

Iâm drifting in darkness
And my emptinessâ staying
Donât shut me out baby
Itâs making me ill
Itâs an overkill

Cannot throw it all away in the blink of an eye
If you left me all alone truly I would just die
Couldnât deal with it and Iâd lose myself
I am pleading letâs have one more try
I need you

And the way we have split up I canât figure it out
Begging for revelation can stand this no more
Memories are painful like a shot through the heart

Iâm drifting in darkness
And my emptinessâ staying
Donât shut me out baby
Itâs making me ill
Itâs an overkill

Cannot throw it all away in the blink of an eye
If you left me all alone truly I would just die
Couldnât deal with it and Iâd lose myself
I am pleading letâs have one more try
