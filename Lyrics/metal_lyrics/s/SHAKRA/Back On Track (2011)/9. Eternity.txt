[Words: Prakesh]

Whatâs waiting on the other side? A so-called paradise
Well is there something after death? Eternity or lies
Judgement Dayâs every day, no one can escape
And now Iâm waiting in my bed for my final fate

And when the time is running out
Will I rest in peace?
Whoâll be waiting over there?
Iâm afraid of dying

Save me, embrace me
Kiss me one last time
Iâll say goodbye for the very last time
I am bleeding
Save me, embrace me
Nothingâs left inside
Iâll say goodbye for the very last time
I am leaving

Release me from this suffering, let mercy come today
Too long I moaned with agony so let me pass away
Cracking up, blew my top, going down the drain
Never wanted to leave this way, father, ease my pain

And when the time is running out
Will I rest in peace?
Whoâll be waiting over there?
Iâm afraid of dying

Save me, embrace me
Kiss me one last time
Iâll say goodbye for the very last time
I am bleeding
Save me, embrace me
Nothingâs left inside
Iâll say goodbye for the very last time
I am leaving
