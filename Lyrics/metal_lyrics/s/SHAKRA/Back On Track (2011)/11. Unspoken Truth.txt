[Music: Muster/Blunier/Prakesh]
[Words: Prakesh]

Under the surface under the skin
Something is waiting to break out within
I am surrounded by loneliness
Drowning in sorrows it burdens my chest

Innocence is bleeding
Realityâs deceiving

Trying real hard to forgive you
Youâve brought me hell Iâve been through
Unspoken things are revealing
I canât go back right now

Misuse of power was passing my way
Leftover anger is ruling my day
Couldnât relate to I was so young
I am so burnt out canât carry on

Innocence is bleeding
Realityâs deceiving

Trying real hard to forgive you
Youâve brought me hell Iâve been through
Unspoken things are revealing
I canât go back right now
