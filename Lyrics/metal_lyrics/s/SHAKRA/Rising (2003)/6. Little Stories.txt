Where are you going baby
With your eyes so bright?
You ain't gonna visit your momma
At this time of night
You're not gonna see your sister
She lives too far away
And not the next door neighbour
She's been away all day

Tell me a story
Like you always do
Another little story
I'll believe it too

You stand there in the doorway
And fill me with you lies
Your painted lips are smiling
But there's that look in your eyes
I know there's someone waiting
Out there in the dark
But as long as you come home to me
I'll be an easy mark

Tell me a story
Think up something new
Another little story
The best you can do
