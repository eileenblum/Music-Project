They all say just toe the line
Don't make any noise
Be like dad and you'll be fine
You don't have no choice

It's my life and I'll decide
Where I'm going now
Find my way through wrong or right
That's what it's all about
What it's all about

Make your mind up and be there
And do it better
Hold your head high in the air
It's now or never

Things get hard and life is tough
Gotta do what's right
Even when the seas are rough
And days turn into night

Don't believe what people say
Listen to your heart
It'll light the darkest way
That'll be the start,
What a way to start!

Make your mind up and declare
I'll do it better
Hold your head high in the air
It's now or never
