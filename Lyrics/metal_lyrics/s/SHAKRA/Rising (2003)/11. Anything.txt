Memories of love, memories of pain
Memories of you and me in the rain
The smile in your eyes, shining so bright
Making me feel like holding you tight

You and me were wild and free
Like two white doves in the sky
So blind with love we could not see
That we weren't meant to fly

And I'd do anything to make you believe me
Anything to make you change your mind
Yes I'd go anywhere as long as you're with me
As long as you are by my side

Feelings of joy, feelings of pride
The feeling of holding you close at night
And look at me know, just what do you see?
The shadow of someone I used to be

You and me were strong and free
Like two eagles in the sky
So blind with love we could not see
That we weren't meant to fly

And I'd do anything to make you believe me
Anything to make you change your mind
Yes I'd go anywhere as long as you're with me
As long as you are by my side
