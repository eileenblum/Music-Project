Tried so long to be someone thought that I'd be the one
I dreamed my whole life that I win the big run
No one told me the reason why my way was so hard
But now I'll face it, give my life a good start

I will never give up
Do the best I can
'cause I know my dream will some day comes true

Rising high up to the sky
Fly so high without fear of falling
Rising high up to the sky
Fly so high without fear of falling down

Once a wise man was talking 'bout the meaning of life
"Wanna climb a ladder, gotta start from the ground
There is never a straight road but I'm sure there's a path
Be what you dreamed of or just stay as a slave"

So I never give up
Do the best I can
'cause I know my dream will some day comes true

Rising high up to the sky
Fly so high without fear of falling
Rising high up to the sky
Fly so high without fear of falling down
