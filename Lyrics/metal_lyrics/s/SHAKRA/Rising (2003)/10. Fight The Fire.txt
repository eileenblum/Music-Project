Saw it on the TV, heard it on the news
Guy who shot his children -- nothing left to lose
Read it in the paper, couldn't trust my eyes
Pretty lady jumping -- and pretty lady dies

It's a wild wild world without heroes
It's a men old world without hope

But I'll fight the fire
I won't surrender
Higher and higher
No I ain't bending

I don't fancy Jesus, I don't feed on hate
Always do it my way till I meet my fate
There might be a reason why we live and die
Why we hurt our loved ones, why we love and lie

It's a wild wild world without heroes
It's a men old world without hope

But I'll fight the fire
I won't surrender
Higher and higher
