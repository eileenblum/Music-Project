The train is waiting down there on the tracks
It?s gonna take me far away, no turning back
Packed my bags and my old guitar
With the words I heard still spinning in my head

I?ve got to run away
There?s no need to stay
Run away
Before the break of day Well, where?s nothing that can keep here no more
And it?s something that I?ve never done before
But it?s time for a new beginning
Time for a brand new start
So to keep the sanity that I?ve still got... I?ve got to run away
There?s no need to stay
Run away
Before the break of day Don?t asking me about my destination
Gonna ride along and get out at a station
And don?t even try to find me
I?ve left you all behind me
And by way of explanation I?ll just say...
I?ve got to run away
There?s no need to stay
Run away
Before the break of day
