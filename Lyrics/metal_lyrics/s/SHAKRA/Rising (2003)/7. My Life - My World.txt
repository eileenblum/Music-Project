When I'm dreaming, you are there
No more hard words, no despair
It's the way it should have been
Then I wake up and there's only me

Broke your promise, broke our dreams
You were never what you seemed
I was foolish, all in all
No running now when you call

This is my life, this my world
I'm the one who'll choose the way to go now
This is my life, this is my world
And what we'd have had, you'll never ever know

Broke your promise, broke your word
Ooh, your smile was a two- edged sword
I was foolish, now one I see
You were never the one for me

This is my life, this is my world
I'm the one who'll choose the way to go now
This is my life, this is my world
And what we'd have had, you'll never ever know
This is my life, this is my world
You thrown away now the best thing in your life
