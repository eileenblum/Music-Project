You turned away and left
Me all on my own
I've tried to call you but
You don't take the phone
My hand is aching from the letters I've sent
Been going crazy since you packed your things
And went

Are you sorry that you've done me wrong?
Are you crying now the nights are long?
Are you sorry that you've done me wrong?
When you listen to this song...

You never told me why
It didn't work out
You never said what
It was all about
I'm going crazy, going out of my mind
Oh baby, please let's give it
Just another try

Are you sorry that you've done me wrong?
Are you lonely now the nights are long?
Are you sorry that you've done me wrong?
'cause my love is still strong...
