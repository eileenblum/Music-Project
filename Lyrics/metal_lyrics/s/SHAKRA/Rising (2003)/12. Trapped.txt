Now raise your hands and feel the power
And left it flow right through your veins
Now you can reach the highest mountains
But just remember you must play

Let me be your guide
And you'll never walk alone
You won't realize
That I steal your mind
And I will never let you know
Never let you go...

Now clear your mind up and start learning
To see the world with different eyes
And when the end of time is coming
You'll be one of those who will survive

Let me be your light
Let me show you how to life
You won't realize
That I steal your mind
But I will never let you know
That I'll never let you go...

Let me be your guide
And you never be alone
Let me be your light
Let me show you where to go
You won't realize
That I steal your mind
But I will never let you know
