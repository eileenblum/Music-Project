Here I'm sitting by the phone
Now that you are gone
Counting minutes, counting hours
Wondering what went wrong

We seemed to be the perfect match
And love was here to stay
Just until that rain came pouring down
And washed it all away

I can hear your laughter
- Everywhere I go
Even when I'm dreaming
- Cause I miss you so

WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE SHARED
WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME
I NEED TO KNOW THAT YOU STILL CARE

Wandering through these empty rooms
Empty like my heart
I feel like lost in space and time
It's tearing me apart
Day and night I wonder why
The magic didn't last
Love is gone and left me here
With shadows of the past
I can hear your laughter
- Everywhere I go
Even when I'm dreaming
- Cause I miss you so

WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE SHARED
WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME
I NEED TO KNOW THAT YOU STILL CARE
