Days and weeks and years go by
You're still the last in line
It's time to make your final choice
And leave your past behind

Tell me what you're waiting for
You're only wasting time
Have you ever seen the other side

TAKE MY HAND
WE WILL FIND A NEW TOMORROW
TAKE MY HAND
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GO

Keep it all inside your heart
What I told you late last night
All your life is in your hands
Whatever you decide

Tell me what you're waiting for
You're only wasting time
I'll tell you what is on the other side

TAKE MY HAND
WE WILL FIND A NEW TOMORROW
TAKE MY HAND
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GO

Open your eyes - We're leaving the night
And Heaven is calling your name
Soon we'll be there - Don't be afraid
I'll be there for you 'til the end

TAKE MY HAND
WE WILL FIND A NEW TOMORROW
TAKE MY HAND
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GO
