Out there in the distance
I hear some children cry
I'm feeling free and easy
Like an eagle in the sky

I really can't believe it
What's going on tonight
But since I felt your heartbeat
There's nothing but delight

Baby's eyes are looking 'round
Crying new melodies
With hands so soft
Conducting symphonies

A PART OF ME - A PART OF YOU
IN YOUR EYES I SEE THE TRUTH
WE NEED CHILDREN TO SURVIVE
A PART OF ME - A PART OF YOU
IN YOUR EYES I SEE THE TRUTH
FOREVER YOU'LL BE MINE
AND THE SUN WILL SHINE

When I hold you close to me
I look into your eyes
Crying turns to laughter
And into paradise

There's magic in this full moon night
I can't believe it's true
I look into the starry sky
Knowing what to do

Baby's eyes are looking 'round...

A PART OF ME - A PART OF YOU
