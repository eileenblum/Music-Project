You try to make me angry
You know I've gone all cold inside
You try to make me see red
But all my feelings for you are long dead

You try to hang on to me
And make me love you again
You try so hard to move me
You just can't see I'm in pain

And I go

GET IT ALL OUT BEFORE IT CHOKES YOU
YOU CAN SCREAM ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT
GET IT ALL OUT BEFORE IT BREAKS YOU
YOU CAN WHISPER OR YOU SHOUT
JUST GET IT ALL OUT

You tell me that you need me
You just can't face that you walk alone
I've told you once it's over
And you just keep hanging on the phone

You cannot make me love you
With every time that you cry
You cannot make me want you
With every time that you die

GET IT ALL OUT BEFORE IT CHOKES YOU
YOU CAN SCREAM ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT
GET IT ALL OUT BEFORE IT BREAKS YOU
YOU CAN WHISPER OR YOU SHOUT
JUST GET IT ALL OUT

You know I do still love you
And you don't want me no more
I thought our love was magic
I want you for evermore

And I cry - Let it all out - Yeah
Let it all out - We can make it

LET IT ALL OUT BEFORE IT CHOKES ME
LETS BE LOVERS IN THE NIGHT
LET IT ALL OUT BEFORE I FAKE IT
LETS BE LOVERS IN THE NIGHT

LET IT ALL OUT - LET IT ALL OUT
LETS BE LOVERS IN THE NIGHT
LET IT ALL OUT - LET IT ALL OUT
CUZ WE'RE LOVERS AGAIN TONIGHT

LET IT ALL OUT
