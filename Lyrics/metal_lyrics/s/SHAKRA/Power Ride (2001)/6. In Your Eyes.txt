You're standing there on the borderline
You're looking for the way
Trying to find your mystic island
Where is the place to stay?

Cause when you look, you will realize
This life is all you've got
You must fight for freedom
Deep inside your heart

Careless whispers - And hopeless dreams
I cannot believe - What it really means

IN YOUR EYES
THERE'S NO MAGIC DEEP INSIDE
IN YOUR SMILE
THERE WAS LAUGHTER FOR A WHILE

You're looking back to the life you've had
You try to hold your dreams
Where's the way back to your paradise?
Is it what it seems?

But you must learn to accept your life
With all the different signs
Then you will get your real magic back
Somewhere between the lines

Careless whispers - And hopeless dreams
I cannot believe - What it really means

IN YOUR EYES...

Enjoy your private memories
But open up your mind
You must live your life today
And leave the past behind

IN YOUR EYES...
