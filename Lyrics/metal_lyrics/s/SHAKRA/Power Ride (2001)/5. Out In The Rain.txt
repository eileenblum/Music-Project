Night after night I've been losing sleep
Lying awake in the dark
How come a heartache can cut so deep
Tearing my whole world apart

Whatever I do, wherever I go
I can't run from the demons inside

WHEN THE PARTY IS OVER I'M OUT IN THE RAIN
WITH A HANDFUL OF DREAMS AND A WHOLE LOT OF PAIN
ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SOMEWHERE IN VAIN
AND THE MEMORIES OF LOVE ARE HAUNTING ME AGAIN

Where is the light that will guide my way
Leading me home through the night
Where is the star that will shine on me
Gentle and friendly and bright

Whatever I do, wherever I go
I can't run from the shadows inside

WHEN THE PARTY IS OVER I'M OUT IN THE RAIN
WITH A HANDFUL OF DREAMS AND A WHOLE LOT OF PAIN
ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SOMEWHERE IN VAIN
AND THE MEMORIES OF LOVE ARE HAUNTING ME AGAIN

Whatever I do, wherever I go
That ol' feeling will always be there
So I just carry on - turn my face to the sun
Till I find myself again in the rain

Out in the rain again

When the party is over I'm out in the rain
With a handful of dreams and a whole lot of pain
Always looking for something somewhere in vain
And the memories of love are haunting me again
