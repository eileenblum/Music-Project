I am the shadow
And she is the light
Shining right down on me
I'm the thunder
And she is the rain
No place I'd rather be

They call her Dirty Mary
She is my delight
Cause she knows how to carry
Me throughout the night
Into the light

SHE'S MY PRIDE
THERE AIN'T NO NEED TO HIDE
SHE'S MY SUN
AND SHE'S THE ONLY ONE

I'm the carina
And she is my sail
Always brings me ashore
I'm the mountain
And she is my peak
I'm not asking for more

I love my Dirty Mary
She is my delight
Cause she knows how to carry
Me throughout the night
Into the light

SHE'S MY PRIDE
THERE AIN'T NO NEED TO HIDE
SHE'S MY SUN
AND SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
