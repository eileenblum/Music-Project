Another lie - You've gone too far
You're the queen of broken hearts
Now look at me - How does it feel
To see a man who's hurt so deep

TELL ME BABY, TELL ME
CAN YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT
TELL ME BABY, TELL ME
AFTER ALL YOUR LIES
YOU GOTTA PAY THE PRICE

Another night - And you're not there
A lonely man - An empty bed
Playing games ain't no crime
As long as there's no heart on fire

TELL ME BABY, TELL ME
CAN YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT
TELL ME BABY, TELL ME
AFTER ALL YOUR LIES
YOU GOTTA PAY THE PRICE

You were all I ever had
You are all I need
Girl I love you, I hate you
What have you done to me

TELL ME BABY, TELL ME
CAN YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT
TELL ME BABY, TELL ME
AFTER ALL YOUR LIES
YOU GOTTA PAY THE PRICE
