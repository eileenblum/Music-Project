You drive a fancy car
Dress up like a gigolo
You live life on the edge
Always in for more
Looking for fun
Out on the run

TOO CLOSE TO THE LINE OF FIRE
SMALL BIRD ON A HIGH SKY WIRE
TOO CLOSE TO THE LINE OF FIRE
TOO CLOSE - BUT YOU JUST DON'T GIVE A DAMN

You pose with pretty girls
Never even know their names
You're laughing far too loud
Driving much too fast
Night is always young
And tomorrow won't come

TOO CLOSE TO THE LINE OF FIRE
SMALL BIRD ON A HIGH SKY WIRE
TOO CLOSE TO THE LINE OF FIRE
TOO CLOSE - BUT YOU JUST DON'T GIVE A DAMN
