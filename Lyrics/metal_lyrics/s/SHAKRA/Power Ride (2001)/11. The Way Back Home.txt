I believe that fallen angels
Are calling me tonight
A lot of pictures, many stories
Battling deep inside

I don't know what easy living means
And I don't know what is true
I hope I'll find the right sign
For my way back home to you

TONIGHT I WANNA BE FREE
LIVING IN MY WORLD OF FANTASY
TONIGHT I WANNA BE FREE
I HOPE I'LL FIND THE WAY BACK HOME TO ME

Whispering voices, different words
Running through my brain
Slowly like an early morning
You call me back again

I know what real life can offer
On my woven path tonight
One step before the door is shut
I find a way back to your light

TONIGHT I WANNA BE FREE

I know what real life can offer
On my woven path tonight
One step before the door is shut
I find a way back to your light

TONIGHT I WANNA BE FREE
