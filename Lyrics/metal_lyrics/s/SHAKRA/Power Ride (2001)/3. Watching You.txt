Don't start a fire - And walk away
Only for the thrill of looking at the flames

Don't fake desire - And turn away
Only for the fun of playing fancy games

You know by now that hearts can break
And that's much more than I can take
Just be aware

I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON YOU
I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON YOU

Don't play the music - If you don't dance
There is more to love than just a brief romance

Don't place an order - If you don't pay
Whisper words of love when you just wanna play

You know by now that hearts can break
And that's much more than I can take
Just be aware

I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON YOU
I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON YOU
I'M WATCHING YOU NOW
