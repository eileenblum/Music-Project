There is no blaming tomorrow
No sacrifice will be forgotten
In my heart I feel no sorrow
Was just your way to solve a problem

Although I know there's no returning
I'm always gonna keep you in my heart

There's salvation you can't keep me down
Only love will remain
Somewhere deep down there's a turnaround
Where hate loses its flame
No more hate

No wrong or right I"ll forgive you
I don't believe in retribution
There is nothing else I can do
My anger's turned into compassion

There's salvation you can't keep me down
Only love will remain
Somewhere deep down there's a turnaround
Where hate loses its flame
No more hate
