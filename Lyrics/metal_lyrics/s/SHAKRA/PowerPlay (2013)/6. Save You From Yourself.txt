It's not an illusion
It's your confusion
You'll see one day
Your way of living
Is unforgiving
It's not ok

You think you're flying
Instead you're dying
Can't ya see
You're going down

I'm not a hero
My amigo
But I know you need help
You will be burning
If you're not learning
How to save you from yourself

I get the impression
That your obsessions
Will make you pay
You keep on going
Without knowing
You've gone astray

I'm not a hero
My amigo
But I know you need help
You will be burning
If you're not learning
How to save you from yourself
