I can fly now 'cause meaning I've found
Time for movin' on
Deeply breathing I'm gonna feel free
I'm gonna let the past all go

I close my eyes to find my guide

What a wonderful life
Gonna take a midnight flight
Where I glide through the stream of my life
Spread my wings and I'll fly
Unified with the sky
It's a wonderful, colorful life
When I'm looking 'round I see it's paradise
In awe again - it's a wonderful life

I used to hold - Hold myself down
But now I understand
I clearly see my way in front of me
The way I have to go for now

What a wonderful life
Gonna take a midnight flight
Where I glide through the stream of my life
Spread my wings and I'll fly
Unified with the sky
It's a wonderful, colorful life
When I'm looking 'round I see it's paradise
In awe again - it's a wonderful life
