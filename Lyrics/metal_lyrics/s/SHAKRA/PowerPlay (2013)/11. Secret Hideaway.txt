We were fading into silence
I was afraid to break the ice
There's no doubt the silence brought us down
Waiting out for better times

I found myself at the crossroad
Was standing there all alone

I have to find another way
I'm longing for that secret hideaway
Somewhere far away
From all this pain
Just need to get away from here

We were living out the wrong life
In a cage of pretty lies
Nothing strong enough for holding on
Laid it down just to survive

I have to find another way
I'm longing for that secret hideaway
Somewhere far away
From all this pain
Just need to get away from here
