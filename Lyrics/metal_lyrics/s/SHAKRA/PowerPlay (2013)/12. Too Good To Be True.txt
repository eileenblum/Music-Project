Yes I was gone way too long
I've got to hang on
Just a few miles from home
Unreal?
And when i step off the train
Will things be alright?
Will you be waiting for me?
My dear...
I've traveled endless miles
So much time's passed
Soon I'll be home at last

I'll have my arms wide open
For no one but you
It's just too good
Too good to be true
And I can't wait to drown in
Your beautiful eyes
It's just too good
Too good to be true
Can this be true?

And then i wake up and see
That I've been sleeping
Hoping the train has not passed my town
And while I'm looking around
I see there's nothing
Apart from four empty walls
Hope falls...

This dream keeps chasing me
Deception's breaking me
Don't wanna wake up and find nothing
Keep turning 'round to see
But you're not lying here
If only I could be with you now
Be with you now

I'll have my arms wide open
For no one but you
It's just too good
Too good to be true
And I can't wait to drown in
Your beautiful eyes
I miss your smile
it's been a while...

Don't let me wake up to find
That I've been dreaming...
