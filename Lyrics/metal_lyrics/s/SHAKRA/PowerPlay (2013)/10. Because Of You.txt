You keep me rollin' - through ups and downs
You keep me movin' on - when I lose ground
The world gave up on me - but you had faith
It feels so crazy but - you gave me strength

Now I've become the man
I want to be
Now I've become that man at last

My life has meaning
My life is free
A new revelation empowering me
Your heart was open
Your heart was true
A new fascination because of you

You keep me rockin' - when i feel down
You keep me holdin' on - for higher ground
When no one gives a damn - you show you care
It ain't always easy but - I know you're there

My life has meaning
My life is free
A new revelation empowering me
Your heart was open
Your heart was true
A new fascination because of you
