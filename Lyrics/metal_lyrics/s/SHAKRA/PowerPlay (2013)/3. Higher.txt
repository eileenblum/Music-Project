I'm getting out - out of the blur
I'm getting in - making a stir
I'm growing stronger - I'm getting loud
I've found my place now - and I'm going

I'm going higher
I'll stand my ground
I have a dream yeah
I'm heading out
I live in the moment
That's all I've got
I have a dream yeah
Just wanna rock

No giving up - It feels so right
No giving in - I've turned the tide
Gambling is over - ain't rolling dice
I know where I'm going - I'm going

I'm going higher
I'll stand my ground
I have a dream yeah
I'm heading out
I live in the moment
That's all I've got
I have a dream yeah
Just wanna rock

I'm growing stronger - I'm getting loud
I've found my place now - no slowing down
Gambling is over - ain't rolling dice
I know where I'm going - I'm going higher
