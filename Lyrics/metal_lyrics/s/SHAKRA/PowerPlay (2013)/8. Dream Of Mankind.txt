A dream of mankind
The wish to fly
Just like a bird in the sky
When I was younger
I had wings too
What a wonderful view

But with the passing of years
Joy disappeared
Sorrows and fears
Brought me to tears

Yes I want
To learn how to fly once again
No more pains
No more chains
And I want
To feel free and careless and then
No more pains
No more chains
Yes I want
To move on and rise once again
Just one - one more time

A dream of mankind
True peace of mind
Without those sorrows in sight
i walked on water
Felt so alive
And now I'm drowning inside

A dream of mankind
Some winning streak
Only for one single week
To hit the jackpot
And all it can bring
Remains a faraway
Unreachable dream
