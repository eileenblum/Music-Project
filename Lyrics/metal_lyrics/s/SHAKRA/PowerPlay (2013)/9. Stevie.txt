Stevie's out for a thrill tonight
Hoping to get on a roll
So far he ain't got
Too much delight
He's living a simple life
Barely able to pay the rent
But he still has lots of drive
Here he goes again...

Yes tonight
He'll go all out
He'll be gambling all night long
Til the dawn

Stevie's in for adrenaline
Wishing to fulfill his dreams
He sticks to his
Castles in the air
His life's like a house of cards
Any moment about to fall
But he never seems to care
Here he goes again...

Yes tonight
He'll go all out
He'll be gambling all night long
Til the dawn
