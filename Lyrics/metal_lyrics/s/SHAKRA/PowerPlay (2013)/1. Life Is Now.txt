Just walk right out
And slam that door
'Cause life is now
Don't look back no more

Turn on the spotlight
And start to dance
You know it's a short life
So take your chance

Life is now
And I'm your healer
I'll show you how
To face your demons

A glass of wine
A girl so true
Or champagne on ice
It's all there for you

Don't waste one minute
'Cause life's too sweet
Get out there and rock
In the summer heat

Life is now
And I'm your healer
I'll show you how
To kill your demons
