What you need is something real
Find a ray of light
Emptiness is what you feel
Dries you out inside

You faked your smile just to please
Change it
No place to hide you must break free
Face it

Speak your mind and take a new stand
Take off your mask - no more pretense
No more lies now make those amends
This is your chance - break free my friend

Half alive you've learned to live
An isolated life
Break those chains and share your gift
Then let your true self shine

You faked your smile just to please
Change it
No place to hide you must break free
Face it

Speak your mind and take a new stand
Take off your mask - no more pretense
No more lies now make those amends
This is your chance - break free my friend
