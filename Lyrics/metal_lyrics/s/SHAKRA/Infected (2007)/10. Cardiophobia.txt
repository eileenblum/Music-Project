[Music: Muster &amp; Blunier, lyrics: Fox]

Comfortless pressure, ants in my veins
Painâs spreading slowly to my neck and my arms
Iâm getting nervous, breaking out in cold sweat
Is this the end or just a panic attack?

Itâs just a nasty dream
Delusion screws me
Nothing is like it seems
Nonetheless it could be
Will I ever live carefree?
Without fear of my death
Itâs just a nasty dream
Until it comes true

In fact weâre all ill, but we donât know it yet
Cowed by media and avaricious meds
Donât wanna think about my final breath
Enjoy my life without a side effect
