[Music: Blunier, lyrics: Fox]

Just one of these lonely nights
Iâm lying on my bed
Sleep seems so far away
My thoughts are in a fight

I get up for a little drink
It may just help a bit
Your smileâs burned into my mind
Itâs written in ink

Could it be that you wonât see me?
Could it be that you just play an evil game?

I wanna be the one
Just be the number one
I swear Iâll be the one who cares
I wanna be the one
Not just another one
I swear Iâll be the one who cares

Now I seem to lose my mind
Iâm up to give a call
Donât know if itâs wrong or right
But my love makes me blind

I hang up, couldnât say a thing
Seems like I lost my voice
Thereâs so much I would like to say
My heart is on a string

Could it be that you wonât see me?
Could it be that you just play an evil game?
