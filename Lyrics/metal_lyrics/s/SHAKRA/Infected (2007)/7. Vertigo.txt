[Music: Muster &amp; Blunier, lyrics: Fox]

It is a lonely rainy Sunday on Hicksvilleâs dirty streets
Only some transient, blurry shadows doing non-essential deeds
No one anticipates, the dire menace waits
Prowling for this sweet young thing
She isnât able to resists them
As they entice her with these words

Come on and join the vertigo
Iâm sure youâll love the snow
It doesnât matter whatâs to come
Or what youâve tried before

A lot of snow fell in the meantime and days are closing in
From time to time she would appear again
Straying, unshod, frail and thin
One day she disappeared
No single word was heard
She was never seen again
But if you listen very carefully
You can hear her softly sing
