[Music: Muster, Blunier &amp; Fox, lyrics: Fox]

Iâm a man whoâs restless
Donât know any frontiers
I live my life, no changes
And break through all barriers

Donât earn a million dollars
But travel âround the world
Your envy keeps distracting you
From you daily routine

Say, how else can I make your day?
Any more bills I have to pay?
What else do you want me to say?
Why do you bother me this way?
Say, how else can I make your day?

You always try to force me
To live my life like you
Thinking itâs unjust for me
To do the things I do

Sure, youâre in a raw deal
You think it is quiet fair
To denounce me anyway you can
To pester me this way

Youâll see itâs no solution
To find your luck through me
âCause I am not salvation
I just live my life free

Sure, youâre in a raw deal
You think it is quiet fair
To denounce me anyway you can
To pester me this way
