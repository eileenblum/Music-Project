[Music: Muster &amp; Blunier, lyrics: Fox]

Now is the time when I have to figure out
Imaginary protection should fill us with pride

You punish the innocent
Your rage is mad
I can hardly have faith in you

I just canât make you out above
Anymore
Where is your so-called higher love?
We need more

Every day I could cover up my eyes
Nothing but cruelty, injustice and evil lies

Born pure, we are spoilt by guilt and grow to waste
And thatâs supposed to make us feel safe

Why canât you just send a sign of assurance?
If you are so damned almighty, take a glance
We long for a little gesture if thereâs still a chance
