[Music: Muster, Blunier &amp; Fox, lyrics: Fox]

Free but so constricted, analyzed self-control
Be good or an example for the crowd
You can take a look but donât touch
You can feel but never taste
Donât swallow, only tasting is allowed

âCause you are, yes you are, part of the master plan
And you are what you are if you strictly hold the line

Now take me to the other side and give me what I need
Now take me to the other side and make my life complete

Only born to pay for someone elseâs intention
The first breath signs a lifelong resolution
You proclaim your situation but nobody ever cares
The system seems to work fine without you
