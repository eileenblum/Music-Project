[Music: Muster &amp; Blunier, lyrics: Fox]

Every time I see you
I canât take my eyes off you
Wishing I could touch your pale, cool skin

I try to be your number one
But you donât mention me
Iâd grab you every star above
Be what you want to be

Youâre playing with fire
Youâre all I desire
Here I am and thereâs no need to pretend
Youâre playing with fire
Youâre all I desire
Here I am and thereâs no need to pretend

You tell me that youâd like me
That you might give it a try
But your favorite game is playing cat and mouse

You once lit my fire
Youâre all I admire, baby, baby
Come and feel my desire
Before I break down and go insane
