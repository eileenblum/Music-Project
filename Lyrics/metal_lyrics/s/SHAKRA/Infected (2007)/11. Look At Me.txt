[Music: Muster &amp; Blunier, lyrics: Fox &amp; Muster]

You stand there in front of me
To join our show, your destiny
You think the man you see lives how you could be

You see my life, itâs full of fun
Touring the world, no need to run
Your childhood dreams come true
However, not for you

Look at me now when Iâm lying here
Look at me now when I fight the fear
Look at me now while Iâm crying
Am I the man you know?
Look at me now, I am near the edge
Look at me now, no one gives a badge
Look at me now, I am trying
Trying to be like you

My picture smiles on TV screens
And even on the magazines
You want to turn back time
But donât know what it means

I treat the girls out youâd like to meet
I break the habit, my world, my lead
Someday I will reach the end of Famous-Street

Iâm just a part of what your mind is longing for
Iâm things you do desire and then even more
Our ways are different ways
We chose them long before
But we both know theyâll carry on
âCause itâs the best for everyone
