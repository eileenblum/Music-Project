[Music: Muster, Blunier &amp; Fox, lyrics: Fox]

Walking down this road Iâve never been before
Itâs so hard to realize the painful truth
And everything around us looks unreal to me

But now my time has come
Please, tell me that Iâm wrong
My love will give you comfort
Make you strong

I donât wanna live forever
I just wanna star another day
And lay here near beside you
âCause you and me belong together
Love is gonna find another way
Iâll never be without you

All those hopes and plans that grew along our way
Will always be a never-ending dream
And I wish Iâd had the time to tell you how I feel

But when the lights go out
Your faith is all I have
Forever to your heart I will belong

Remember how it used to be when we had just sunny weather
Every little thing seemed possible
But even in the darkest times our hearts will stay together
âCause love will find a way, yes, love will find a way
