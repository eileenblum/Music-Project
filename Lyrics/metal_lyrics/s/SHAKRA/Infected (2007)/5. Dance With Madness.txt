[Music: Muster &amp; Blunier, lyrics: Fox]

Deep in the night I hear a scream
But no one it seems is near
Slowly I try to face my thoughts
Hope I didnât wake up in a dream

I wonât keep bogging down into dullness
Iâm stuck between realities
Wanna hold on to my dance with madness and the fear

Thousands of tongues blow up my head
Convincing me of different truths
Amazed and confused it dawns on me
This must be reality!

We are all just like puppets of society
Even if we think weâll win
Somebody else pulls the strings
