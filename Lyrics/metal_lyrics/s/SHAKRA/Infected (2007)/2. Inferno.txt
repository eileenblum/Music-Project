[Music: Blunier &amp; Fox, lyrics: Fox]

I crossed the border, I saw the light
I tried to reach it but then I failed
I have to stay here to pay my dues
Am I forgotten and lost in a ruse?

Why canât you feel me?
I am next to you!
Why canât you feel me?
I am touching you!

Take my hand
Show me the Promised Land
Let me take a look
But donât let me lose ground
Take my hand
Show me the Promised Land
Just a visitor
And not as resident of Inferno

The penitent road I had to cross
Facing all my sins, my whole lifeâs loss
No peace of heaven, just god damned heat
Heart-piercing cries spread the darkest seed
