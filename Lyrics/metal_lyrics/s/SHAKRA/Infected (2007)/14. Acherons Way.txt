[Music: Muster, lyrics: Fox]

Another ferryâs drifting slowly through the stream
Someday I will follow, someday Iâll be free
Silently the wind blows moving misty clouds
I wait until itâs darker, covered by a shroud

Another rainy day is passing by
Another restless day without a try
But tomorrow I will go
Tomorrow I will go away

Something seems uncertain and still it holds me back
Salvationâs calling, craving from somewhere in the dark

Another rainy day is passing by
Another restless day without a try
Another cry of agony vibrates through the night
But tomorrow I will go
Tomorrow I will go away

Iâm still hanging around, think I have run aground
But I know I will have to pay my dues
And I hope that they will not refuse

My time has come for leaving
Iâm taking my last course
And soon Iâm gonna be there to fuse with a sacred force

No more rainy days are passing by
No more restless days without a try
No more cries of agony in the darkest night
Today Iâve gone away
Today Iâve finally gone away
