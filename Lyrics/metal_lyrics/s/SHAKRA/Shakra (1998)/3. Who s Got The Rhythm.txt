Another night in leather, another day in lace
You do it so much better, I got this smilin' face
Your rock gets rolled by money -
any hearts for sale
Like one foot in heaven 'n' one foot in hell

This world you care for is calling my name
This world you fight for will be turning my way

Who's got the rhythm
To turn water into wine
Who's got the rhythm
Are you so divine

And if the road gets dirty you gonna
change your shoes
Cuz white is your color and white is your blues
You travel every city, you can fly to the moon
But you can't buy the rhythm -
you're gonna find out soon

Who's got the rhythm
Do you got the rhythm
