Oh baby look at me
I'll be your friend tonite
I'm gonna make you smile
I'll never make you cry
You think I'm full of lies
I'm not that kinda man
Cuz' when you're feeling down, down, down
Gonna make you feel alright

When you turn your back on me
Gonna live all my fantasies
Better keep an eye on me
Gonna live all my hidden dreams

It's the devil in me
It's the devil in me

I'd walk a million miles
Just to see your face
Hold your pretty hand
Take you to a better place
I swear it on the phone
Swear it eye to eye
You know it ain't no lie, no, no
Let me be the one who cares
