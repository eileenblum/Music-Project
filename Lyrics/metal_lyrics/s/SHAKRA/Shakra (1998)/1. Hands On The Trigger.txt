Without a warning
Out of the blue
Her eyes so hungry
What could I do
She dragged me to the back door
Like a dog on a lead
No kinda resistance
When I spotted the meat

I thought to myself just take what you can
And don't hesitate, I know what it's like
When life gets me down

Hands on the trigger
Come'n'take me higher
Hands on the trigger
And set the sky on fire

Strong desire
And the pourin' rain
No need for talking
Didn't know her name
Then the first sign of morning
And my eyes still blind
Didn't have to see nothing
What I felt was right

I thought to myself just take what you can
And stop asking yourself if it's good or bad
When life treats you right
