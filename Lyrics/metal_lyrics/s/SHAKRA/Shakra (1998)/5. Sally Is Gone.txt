Sally is gone
She packed her bags and hit the road
Just left a note
Saying "Baby, I know
I shouldn't leave this way but I
I gotta go"

She left some pictures and took
he camera and the van
And now I wonder if loving me was just a part
Of her nasty little plan

She came like rain right out of the blue and asked me to
Light her fire
As hot as hell and ringing my bell
she knew I'd fall
For her call

Sally is gone
Guess I knew it all the time
Yet I was blind
Didn't wanna think twice
Head over heels into the pool
Oh, what a fool

She left the dishes, a phone bill, and a broken heart
But if she asked me if I would play this game again
would go right back to the start
