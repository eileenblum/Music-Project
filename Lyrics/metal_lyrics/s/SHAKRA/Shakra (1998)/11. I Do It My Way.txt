I was out on my own
Somewhere down in no man's land
Didn't know where to go
Guided by a stranger's hand

Now I'm wide awake
I open my eyes
I am learnin'
Turn my face to the sun
That's shining for me
Believe in myself on and on

I do it my way
Travel the world
I do it my way
My voice will be heard
I do it my way
Discover myself
Forever I'll try, till the end of my days
On my way

As the struggling goes on
Dreams become so hard to keep
But I'm still holding on
Knowing it's all up to me

I don't need your advice
Don't need your command
I keep learnin'
Find my way to the land
Where I'll be king
Where I will be dreaming again
