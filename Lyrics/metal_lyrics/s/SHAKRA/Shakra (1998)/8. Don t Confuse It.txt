Pretty girl in a magazine
Let's spend a little time
A little love, a little fun
That's what I need tonight
C'mon in and turn me on
I'm ready to explode
And when it's done don't steal away
Don't ever let me go

Feels like I'm dying when you're gone
Seems like I'm out here on my own
I'm lost without you

Don't confuse it
Don't confuse sex and love

Money makes the world go round
I wanna make you mine
I'd give you everything you want
Whatever I can buy
This is not a fairy tale
This ain't Hollywood
You can touch me anywhere
But never get my heart
