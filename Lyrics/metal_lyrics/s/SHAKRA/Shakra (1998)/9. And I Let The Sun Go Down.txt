When I run into the heat I'm longin' for the cold
When I walk on crowded streets I'd rather be alone
Yes, I know I shouldn't think about the things I had
What can I do, what can I say - this morning things look bad

Could have been a hero
Could have been a star
Now I start from zero
And I won't get far

I let the sun go down
I don't really feel alive
And let the sun go down
While I walk in darkest night

The more I step into the dark
the more I close my eyes
Every step could be my last - should I laugh or cry
We all need a place to stay, but I wonder where
Cuz if pain's a part of life joy must be a part of death
