See an old man
Sitting in the dirt
Two golden badges
On his broken shirt
Looks like he's crying
With the rain on his face
And I feel like running
To get out of this place

I can't tell what I feel
Cause it seems so unreal
I just look and listen to him

Down'n'dirty
With a smile on his face
Down'n'dirty

Well he was born
On the wrong side of town
Guess God was too busy
So he couldn't come round
Moonlight and starshine
And the pale blue lightHis only companions
In the chill of the night
