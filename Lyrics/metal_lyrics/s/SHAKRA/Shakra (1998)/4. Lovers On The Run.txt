I'm ready to rock
I'm ready to explode
Got the key to your lock
Hear me I'm knocking on your door
I got love to give
Gonna get my little share
I'm gonna teach you what you never knew
And you'll be safe with me tonight

Better keep moving cause now the heat is on
Better keep moving like lovers on the run

I'm ready to roll
I'm ready to confess
That I'd sell my soul
For a look into your eyes
You got love to give
Gonna get your little share
I'm gonna give you what you never had
And I'll be good to you tonight
