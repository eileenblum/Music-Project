The radioactive spectrum was released in a solitary massively destructive
blastwave. 
billions fall victim to the power of one soul being. 
The black hand reaches across the globe a final time to extinguish the tiny
flicker of mankind. 
You'll be buried up to your neck in sand, and have molten lead poured down your
throat. 
A sky burial is at hand, let the cosmic avian gods flock to gorge on thy sacred
flesh of the earth.
