When summing up the existence of all human kind, There's simply one word that
comes to mind, Labor. 
The Enslaver. 
A tractor beem to the grave, And your all falling victim, Living life as human
slaves. 
You do what your told. 
Your worth is bought, Your worth is sold. 
Growing colder, And getting older each day. 
You do what you can To follow the plan And deplete your lifespan. 
But when it all comes down to it Its all out of your hands. 
Curse these wretched ways! Were throwing our lives away, Its all a waste. 
Awoken from your slumber yet you still tred on. 
Though Its a new day, they'll find a new way to rely upon Yourself. 
Your spawn. Your all just human pawns. 
Before you get the chance to think, You've lost And they've already won. 
You do what your told. Your worth is bought. Your worth is sold. 
Growing colder, And getting older each day. 
You do what you can To follow the plan And deplete your lifespan. 
But when it all comes down to it Its all out of your hands. 
Curse these wretched ways! Were throwing our lives away. Its all a waste. 
Curse this wretched place! We're throwing our lives away, its all a waste. 
Curse this wretched place! There's never been a glimmer of hope for the human
race. 
Now we've got all four limbs pinned against the wall But they can't take away
our pride, we must walk tall. 
Our hatred. They can't take it. 
Whether we run, walk or crawl. 
As brothers we must unite, all for one and one for all! You do what your told. 
Your worth is bought, Your worth is sold. Growing colder, And getting older
each day. 
You do what you can To follow the plan And deplete your lifespan. 
But when it all comes down to it Its all out of your hands. 
Curse these wretched ways! Were throwing our lives away, Its all a waste.
