The globe is a war-field. 
Desecrated contagion scattered throughout this harrowed land grinds beneath my
feet like fallen leaves beneath a deceased tree. 
A bestial river flowing with the blood of the fallen carries severed limbs and
intestines in a twisting current of plasma. 
To self-proclaimed leaders our lives are meaningless. 
These malicious men have cast us into involuntary monetary slavery. 
They are voracious leaches feeding on the free will of humanity. 
Donate your life to government genocide! FEMA coffins lined with human ash line
the corpse paved roads to superlative domination. 
A black plague breeds beneath the ground, but the answers to life do not lie
below. 
They lie within your flesh, and swim through your blood. 
These imbecilic drones are killing for payment in fel possessions until the
murder of innocents becomes an omnipotent obsession. 
The globe is a war-field. 
Desecrated contagion scattered throughout this harrowed land grinds beneath my
feet. 
To self-proclaimed leaders our lives are meaningless. 
These malicious men have cast us into involuntary monetary slavery. 
Our sanity is a shotgun painting the walls in our enemies brains. Spill
Bilderberg Blood!
