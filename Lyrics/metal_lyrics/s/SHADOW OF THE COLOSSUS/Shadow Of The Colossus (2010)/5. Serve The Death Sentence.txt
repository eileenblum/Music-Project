In a tower enshrouded in clouds at the summit of the world, they remain,
Despite a warning. 
A hole is ripped in the fabric of time as the conjuring begins. 
Atrocious and depraved destruction is at hand, as shadows of treachery cover
all visible land. 
Senseless laughter fills the air as corruption is pumped into the soul. 
Humans are waste, and shit they become. 
Cadaverous from the neck up. 
Victims of chemical decapitation, living in a drug-induced "reality". 
The inner eye is stamped out, never bursting forth carrying light to the psyche
subconcious. 
A closed mind is the noose asphyxiating humanity. 
Serve the death sentence! There is no repentance!
