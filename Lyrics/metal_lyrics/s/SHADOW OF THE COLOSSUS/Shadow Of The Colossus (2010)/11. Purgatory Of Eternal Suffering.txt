These days famine reigns. A dark and cold silence lurks the streets. 
The departed lie rotting, pathogens feasting on the mountains of corpses. 
This plague spawned to devour all life then spit it back out mutated. 
To bring about a revolution of species, toxicity, and decay. Rulers of this
planet. 
Very few still live to see the mutations of all rising from their demise. 
To bring about a revolution of species, toxicity, and decay. Rulers of this
planet. 
Maggot-like insects are spawned, from the diseased microbes in their organs. 
And pour from their jaws, Covered in blood and stomach acid. 
They feast on the walls of your heart. 
Anticipate your fate until it promptly erupts. 
The bodies casing is ripped to scraps, revealing a more immaculate creation. 
Dark glowing eyes like those of condemned souls. 
Souls instilling fear in your judgment when their presence is forbidden. 
These days, my time, no longer have a purpose within this purgatory of eternal
suffering. 
To bring about a revolution of species, toxicity, and decay. 
Rulers of this planet. GENOCIDE! The seed planted within, viciously shreds
apart at my soul. 
I'm dying. I can feel it! Organs decomposing cursing this body. 
Our final moments have arrived. 
Endless land filled with bodies. What a horrid display of death and decay, an
exceptional sight for my heart's last beat.
