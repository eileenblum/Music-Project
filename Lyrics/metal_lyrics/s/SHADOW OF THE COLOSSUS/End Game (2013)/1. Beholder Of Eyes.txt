Like paint on canvas, brought to life. Like each swipe of brush look through my eyes, and see in my heart flooded with light. My existence is art. The starry skied night. A gift of pieces, puzzled forever. A part of something better. Put me together, and be my shelter in atrocious weather. Never to be severed like birds of a feather. Beauty resides in the beholder of eyes, tucked inside the simplest of things. So if it lies within those we find, confide into a life and then you'll see just what it brings. Born to be great by inner workings of fate with principles of greatness in mind. So before it's too late disintegrate your hate. Stay true to your purpose this is why we're designed. Beautiful conception. Innocence and lack of deception. Growth in darkness yet emerging bright. A creature of Earth, the nemesis of night. Past untold, future unknown, present is here, now child be born. Beauty resides in the beholder of eyes, tucked inside the simplest of things. So if it lies within those we find, confide into a life and then you'll see just what it brings. Born to be great by inner workings of fate with principles of greatness in mind. So before it's too late disintegrate your hate. Stay true to your purpose this is why we're designed. Birth of a future. Enduring a life. Holding on to what's right, let the light grow inside. Between each flicker, relight the flame. Treat it as a gift, don't play it as a game. Do not dwell upon what others have become. Give your word, you'll never fail or come undone.
