From tears we rejoice. Love's past sorrow cries low beneath my voice. Sounds from within, muffled dissonant torture, but as past times die new fires smolder. Bring back that fire that beats in my chest. That dark cold place had been beaten to death. But something has sparked it's tiny ticks within. I've been shredded apart, but I'd do it all again. This is what I've been missing. An end to my wishing. This cost of living, I keep reminiscing. I need your courage to keep from despair. Your kiss is warm, comfort cool as air. Without love we cannot repair.x2 Inspired by desire, fear tames the fire. Love's bright fluorescent moon. My heart's not a liar, this feeling's required to avoid the impending gloom.
