The future seems no more. The end is near, I'm growing sore. When the body goes limp buried in the floor, I feel for my soul walking out life's door. If only faith was real, there'd be nothing to conceal. This ideal I feel, just has no appeal. Like sand in water, do I disappear. Leaving behind all my loved ones, all those I hold near. Will I leave an impact? An ocean of tears? Or just this statue of flesh left to rot for a million years. I am hiding behind this pillar of skin. Looking out but ignoring the in. In constant fear that the lights stay dimmed, until it's dark and you discover my grim. Bleeding life seems to sink in the Earth. Gives feet to the deep, there is no rebirth. If they discover my pain what would it be worth? So I wish to remain alone, rotting in dirt. These thoughts keep seething. They're boiling in my mind. Afraid there's nothing left but organs inside. I should've done more than feed my pride and sit in this dark shell and hide. BLECK! I am hiding behind this pillar of skin. Looking out but ignoring the in. In constant fear that the lights stay dimmed, until it's dark and you discover my grim. Bleeding life seems to sink in the Earth. Gives feet to the deep, there is no rebirth. If they discover my pain what would it be worth? So I wish to remain alone, rotting in dirt. If you lower me down in the ground, let this soul be unfound. Someone pull the strands of time. Let the forces be unwound. Life is short, I know, but a real long ways to go. Hypnotized when we die. Disastrous, darkened, dimented glow. I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm afraid. This cycle, I feel, is the reason why we're made.
