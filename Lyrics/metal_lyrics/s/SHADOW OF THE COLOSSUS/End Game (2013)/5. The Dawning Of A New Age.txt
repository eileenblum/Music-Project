Consice and open minded
A stronger me
The need to be found
Falls to the ground
And now I'm free

There comes a time, when all of the governing forces of life
Come to a head
And in this time, we do what we can to progress in this life
And get ahead

Shed all of your Inferior doubts
And head forth to find what this is all about

Rise up and conquer
Go forth and get further

This is the dawning of a new age
A new chapter of life
Its the unveiling of a new page
A new chapter of life

Consice and open minded
A stronger me
The need to be found
Falls to the ground
And now I'm free

When pestilence fails, you're tribulations and trials prevail
Over defeat
The future we hail, and raise a glass to what we unveil
And never retreat

Success is measured not by wealth
But the quality of ones life and health

Rise up and conquer
Go forth and get further

This is the dawning of a new age
Its the unveiling of a new page
This is the dawning of a new page
Its the unveiling of a new page
A new chapter of life


Self sufficient
All proficient
Omnipotent
unrestricted

Self reliant
All defiant
Fairly biased
Uncompliant

A new age
A new chapter of life
The unveiling of a new page
An end to the night
A new chapter of life

Consice and open minded
A stronger me
The need to be found
Falls to the ground
And now I'm free
