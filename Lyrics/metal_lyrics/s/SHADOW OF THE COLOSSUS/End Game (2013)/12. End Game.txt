I don't know why
and I don't know how I realized
and I wanna cry
until you're always alive
I might die
if you die

I need you more than ever... before,
and I'd bleed for you forever... and more,
you cant run,
you cant hide,
we only have one guarantee in this life,
but for me just try
to not die

one day you'll find
that were all so dangerously alike
and I wanna cry
until its always a lie
that you'll die
cause i'd die

I need you more than ever... before
and I'd bleed for you forever... and more
you cant run
you cant hide
we only have one guarantee in this life
but for me just try
to not die

I'm falling behind
(just try to dry your eyes)
im wasting my time
(oh my how time flies by)
im out of my mind
(but i know ill be fine)

I need you more than ever... before
and i'd bleed for you forever... and more
you cant run
you cant hide
we only have one guarantee in this life
but I know ill be fine
when you die
