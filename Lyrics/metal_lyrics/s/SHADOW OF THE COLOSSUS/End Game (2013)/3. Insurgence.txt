I must break down and build. I only wish to be a part of this world. Pain, anguish at the expense of thrills. The heat in my heart only causes me chills. Every exit of the needle filled with pills, the blood spills, all things false are instilled. Uncomfortability, disease is killin me, in a pile of shit thats become warm tranquility. Destruction of my conscience to rise above. Misplacing integrity in the caverns of destructive love. Douse the earth in fire so we all can see in the dark. And with our blistered feet we will dance. And for once i wont feel apart. The truth be told is still a lie to the liar. Diseased thoughts. Inspirations expired. Persistant flames fill my veins, bleeding ash. Disengaged from this world. Destruction covers my path. This prison is small and the walls lined with black. Now feast your eyes upon my pestilant wrath. My stomach turns, chest open wide. Noone understands the rampant darkness inside. These robotic pawns, and their diluted minds. Potential is illusion. These people are Blind. Douse the earth in fire so we all can see in the dark. And with with our blistered feet we will dance and for once i wont feel apart. Not even water could extinguish this hellfire. So theres blood in the soil but theres still stars in the sky. Treacherous cries reminds us that were barely alive. x2 Douse the earth in fire so we all can see in the dark. And with our blistered feet we will dance and for once i wont feel apart. Not even water could extinguish this hellfire
