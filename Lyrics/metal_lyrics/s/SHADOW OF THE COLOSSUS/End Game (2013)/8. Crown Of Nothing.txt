Wandering aimlessly. Dead ends are defeating me. Will I mold into the hive minded fool? Anticipation of the golden rule. Now is when I let go of my fears. A life that's pointless brings torment. I'm bathing in tears. Opportunities disgraced so many wasted years. It's time I shut my mouth and open up my ears. An obsession with worldly possessions. Confessions precede apprehension. The world keeps spinning but my heart stands still. I'm falling apart, it's inevitable. I'm falling apart, a fucking waste from the start. Poisonous, putrid mess, meaningless, piece of shit. I will not submit to any of this. Society has engraved in me this false sense of identity. I don't know who I am just who I used to be. Set me free. Society has engraved in me this false sense of identity. I don't know who I am just who I used to be. Please set me free from this crown of nothing. I disguise myself in light, but darkness creeps amongst the night. Living in a plastic world overcame my sight. This shit is over. I'm ending this now. It's time I lived my life. Poisonous, putrid mess, meaningless, piece of shit. Brick by brick these prison walls will fall. All work no play, I'm ill of it all. Society has engraved in me this false sense of identity. I don't know who I am just who I used to be. Set me free. Society has engraved in me this false sense of identity. I don't know who I am just who I used to be. Please set me free from this crown of nothing. Normality has left a bitter taste in my mouth. If wealth and fame is North propel me South. There is an animal that lurks within us all. Existence tangible, I'm making sense of it all. Exiled, Defiled, Cataclysmic denial. Realization, augmentation, this is the art of self excavation.
