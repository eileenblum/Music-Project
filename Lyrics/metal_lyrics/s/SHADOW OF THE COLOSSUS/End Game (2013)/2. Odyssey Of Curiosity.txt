Surrounded by giants, the fear a spirit endures. Discovering the senses that a life ensures. Blind faith without sight, not knowing wrong from right. Reaching out from the womb. Fear is the only resource. Imitating surroundings. Reliance upon those around me. Suffering has never been part of understanding. Converging touch into the small of a brain. Odyssey of curiosity is molded by pain. Testing those that I trust with extreme disdain. Wants and needs that emerge like sunshine clouded by rain. The teachings, and the preachings are becoming me. A brave new soul to this life. The world's a nightmare, by the orders abide. The mind as a sponge, into existence we plunge. What's learned becomes growth letting behaviors inside. Imitating surroundings. Reliance upon those around me. Suffering has never been part of understanding. Converging touch into the small of a brain. Odyssey of curiosity is molded by pain. Testing those that I trust with extreme disdain. Wants and needs that emerge like sunshine clouded by rain. The teachings, and the preachings are becoming me. Trusting warmth within arms. Seeking independence. A slave to the heart. Extensively eccentric. Improvement constantly in form with the movement. Wisdom is birthed within the presence of prudence. Finding truth in the nightmare. Comfort seeding from the love that is born there. Confusion colored on the face that I bear. Analyzing failure comes the confidence I wear. A brave new soul to this life. The world's a nightmare, by the orders abide. The mind as a sponge, into existence we plunge. What's learned becomes growth letting behaviors inside. Surrounded by giants, the fear a spirit endures. Discovering the senses that a life ensures. Blind faith without sight, not knowing wrong from right. Reaching out from the womb. Fear is the only resource.
