When I cross over The Great Divide
Between the souls that reside
In this cold and calculated reality
Whats in the beyond awaiting me?

My heart is racing, the end is here
Ive been constantly fading these past few years
So much left undone, unfelt, unseen
This all feels like some hideous dream

Deserter I am leaving my hollow shell
Surely destined for Heaven or Hell
But what if Hell is just the Earth?
A prison for us all made of dirt

When my soul departs
This void anatomy to explore the beyond
Don't cry for me
I'm far from the evil of humanity

Six feet under, laid to rest
My blood replaced with formaldehyde
Waiting on eternity to return me to this world
The circle of life complete once more

As the flesh melts off my dusty bones
It reveals the frailty of life unknown
All that remains is a stone marker of a memory
Not the mind that used to be

When I cross over The Great Divide
Between the souls that reside
In this cold and calculated reality
Whats in the beyond awaiting me?

When my soul departs
This void anatomy to explore the beyond
Don't cry for me
I'm far from the evil of humanity

Release a storm of cosmic vigilance
I wish to survey my domain of consciousness
All that has ever been, or ever will be
The infinity of time is all within me

When I cross over The Great Divide
Between the souls that reside
In this cold and calculated reality
Whats in the beyond awaiting me?

When my soul departs
This void anatomy to explore the beyond
Don't cry for me
I'm far from the evil of humanity

Release a storm of consciousness
