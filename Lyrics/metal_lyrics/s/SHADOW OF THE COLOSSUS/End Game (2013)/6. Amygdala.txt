Tell me you wish I could be someone else. Someone unrealistic and bleak like yourself. We can learn to love cause I can relate. So expose me for just who I am as of late. I've been searching for years in route for escape. Lost cause, tattered claws, dismembered past. Drowned in dead seas but riddled with moss. Rich with insecurity, my business is thriving. Help wanted flashing in the windows we're hiring. Looking for a soul who inspires the soulless. Good luck friend I wish you well. It's hell but it sure as hell sells. My misery does not want you around. I am a selfish nightmare nothing short of hellbound. Let me be you for a day. I'll make the devil proud. Tell me you wish I could be someone else. Someone unrealistic and bleak like yourself. We can learn to love cause I can relate. So expose me for just who I am as of late. I've been searching for years in route for escape. Lost cause, tattered claws, dismembered past. Drowned in dead seas but riddled with moss. My time is telling the future in past tense sentences. It's all my thought's senses entangled within the barbs of black iron fences.x2 What's this all about? Please figure me out.
