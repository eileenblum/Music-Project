[Music &amp; Lyrics: Janne]

I'm wearing a long black overcoat, a grey knitted cap
And I have a walking stick
Don't care who you are but you know me
You call me "Mr. Death"

My ambition is to destroy all the kids
'cause they are so malicious
Screaming little bastards just fooling around
But they sure look delicious
Delicious

Sugar daddy's here to stay, gonna take your kids away
I'm the course of your weakened health, no use calling help

Stone cold - stone cold soul, eruption
- I want more, emotion
- stone cold soul, destruction
- real hardcore, devotion

Little children playing in their playground
No watches after them, sugar daddy sneaks around

There's no one I can't corrupt
I've bought the politicians and the police
Privaledge to hunt in the shadows
And catch my colours the way I please
The way I please

I'm even sweeter than cream, but I'll make your children scream
You won't see me on the TV screen, I'm real, nasty and mean

Stone cold - stone cold soul, eruption
- I want more, emotion
- stone cold soul, destruction
- real hardcore, devotion

[Solo 1: Roope]
[Solo 2: Nirri]
[Solo 3: Roope]
[Solo 4: Nirri]

Aggressive needs are very hard to satisfy
Enjoy torturing kids and seeing them die
Depressive needs, and you say this is just a lie
Lock up your children and kiss them goodbye

I'm here to stay, gonna take your kids away
You won't see me on the TV screen, I'm real, nasty and mean

[Solo: Nirri]

Stone cold - stone cold soul, eruption
- I want more, emotion
- stone cold soul, destruction
- real hardcore, devotion
