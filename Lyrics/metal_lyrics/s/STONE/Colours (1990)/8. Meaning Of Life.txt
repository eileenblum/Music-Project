[Music and Lyrics: Janne]

So, what is the meaning of life?
White crucifix or a sharp knife?
Seeking truth? we'll seek it hard
And if you find it, send me a post card

Got a career, wear a tie, you want it all
There's nothing you can't buy
"I want my name written in stars
I wanna be the first man walking on mars"

No - you'll never find the true meaning
Never - 'cause you're looking for it inside of yourself

Take a walk in the street, listen to life
Can you hear it's heart beat?
Smell the raw, still rotten meat
Those people aint the same you used to meet

Who might you be - a greedy servant seeking the truth
What do you see - I see me, do you know my daddy
- super freak alien from outer space
- see my big lie, worship me or die

Take an elevator through empty space
Buy yourself a shuttle, and join the never ending race
Take a subway to the center of earth
What on earth could be there, a show where
Mother earth gives birth

You're getting tired of truth stuff
Besides, searching is rough
But have you sought from the right places
Don't give up yet, at least not now
Maybe your colours show up somehow
Have even looked under the bible

[Solo 1: Nirri]
[Solo 2: Roope]

Ride your shuttle once more through space
Look out a window, see god's face?
Then perhaps you'd understand the meaning
Out there, there's nothing for you to be seen
Instead of brain, you get a tiny bean
The further you go the nearer truth you get
No truth I bet
