[Music: Roope and Janne, Lyrics: Janne]

I can't bear this lightness of life
The first sunny day
Everything seems to work out even too easy
Succeed in what I choose to do now
My unwritten law
I always happen to be the best

Sunshine and a blue sky is making me feel
I'm back in life again
White darkness is swept away
Deleted period of emptiness, it's all past now
Forgotten time
Gonna make a fresh start
Nature's growing into colours, I feel the same inside
I'm ready to be the best

Spring - the right time for a new competition
Win or go under - may the best man win
Sing - I won't sing in the rain anymore
Win or go under - the first prize is the sun

No reward for the second place
Gonna win my life
Consolation prize, a place in heaven
But that's afterlife
And I'm only interested in being alive

[Solo: Roope]

Spring - the right time for a new competition
Win or go under - may the best man win
Sing - I won't sing in the rain anymore
Win or go under - the first prize is the sun

[Solo: Nirri]

Sunshine and a blue sky is making me feel
Things aint what they seem
I'm getting cloudy inside
Trying to look like a certain winner but the feeling's gone
I'm falling behind
Stumbled over the second step
Nature's growing but I got stuck, I can't win my own life
But I won't lose my death

Goodbye
