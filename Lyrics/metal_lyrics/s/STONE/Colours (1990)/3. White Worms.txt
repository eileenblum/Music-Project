[Music &amp; Lyrics: Janne]

We're mean, totally out of control
That's the way it's gotta be
We're dirt, worse than nuclear waste
Teaching kids the way down
Messages, evil lyrics put on a spell
Hungry sound, tempting your children to fall

We seduce kids into crimes, the good won't get caught
We lie, present immortal life, colours are hidden to the top
Nightmares, we'll make the worst ones come true
Wet dreams, kids will sink in their beds

Slimy little bastards, fermenting false message
Spoiling this generation, we'd deserve to be punished
We're white worms, biting your skin
Digging holes in your flesh
We're eating our way into your kids' brains

Fatal, life, is now to be served
Mortal man, shouldn't taste the fruits of life
'cause they are full of
White worms

Our noise, paralyzes the senses
Causes damage in the brain
Our fans, they can't be saved
They've failed in their lives
Glassy eyes, see us distorted but real
Easy to lead, violence is the answer to all needs

Slimy little bastards, fermenting false message
Spoiling this generation, we'd deserve to be punished
We're white worms, biting your skin
Digging holes in your flesh
We're eating our way into your kids' brains

Fatal, life, is now to be served
Mortal man, shouldn't taste the fruits of life
'cause they are full of
White worms

[Solo: Roope]

'cause they are full of
White worms
