[Music: Roope, Lyrics: Janne]

Another morning, sunbeams are boiling my head
I wake up to throw up my yesterday
Too late, I can't get out of the bed
This is where I'm gonna stay
Oh shit, now it's all over the place, yellow vomit keeps on flowing
This again, my mouth is as big as my face, upstairs calling?

What have I done, to deserve this, did I even have fun?

Last night, can't remember a thing, guess we had a really good time
Yesterday, nothing was boring, today, nothing's fine

Colours on the wall, see them reaching for me
But if I close my eyes, hear the darkness so fucking loud
Pressure in my head, the hammer's working hard
And my stomach is rolling like an overspeeding spin dryer

[Solo 1: Roope]
[Solo 2: Nirri]

I had it, I'll rip my filthy body up, or what is left of it
No sweat, few beers from a shop and I won't give a shit
What a wonderful day, I deserve this, take a few more
And everything'll be great at least till tomorrow
