[Janne Joutsenniemi]

Lighting a fire in the middle of darkness
Sparks disappearing in the sky
Can't stop staring at the curling fire
Mesmeric magic in the flames

Here I am exploring different stages in Emotional Playground
I need to see what's behind this all
Exploring different stages in Emotional Playground
I have a vision, I have a dream

A peaceful walk through a naked city
Sun is waking up, melting the air
Looks like I'm alone here, and it feels kinda weird
There seems to be no course of time

Here I am exploring different stages in Emotional Playground
I need to see what's behind this all
Exploring different stages in Emotional Playground
I have a vision, I have a dream

My mind's flying with the sparks far out in the sky
I wish you could share this all with me
