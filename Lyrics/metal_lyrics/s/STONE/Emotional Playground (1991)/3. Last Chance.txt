[Roope Latvala - Janne Joutsenniemi]

Who's that man on a hill
Giving people a serious speech
Looks like he would have something for us to teach
Join the crowd, the saint club
Together we shall be one
He gathers his disciples cos it's begun

We don't have to walk on water, we don't need a car or train
We'll take a trip with his private plane
He's the newborn Jesus Christ, wishes everyone on board welcome
We're on a way to his kingdom come

Jesus Christ - Take his hand - Otherwise it's too late
Do it right - Your last chance, come and change your fate

If you feel like giving up cos you can't see no hope
Diseased but they can't find a cure
Believe and you're saved or get your money back
Only non-smoking seats on this tour

Jesus Christ - Catch his look
You'll be hypnotized
Do it right - Your last chance with
Jesus Christ
