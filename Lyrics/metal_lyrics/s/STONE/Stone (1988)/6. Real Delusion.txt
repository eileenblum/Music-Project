Hello, hello boy, it's time to go to bed
To have a little dream
Hello yellow face, don't close your eyes
Maybe they won't open again

I'm just a little boy, but I can destroy
I've got things going on
Got bad nerves, I'm 'bout to explode
So leave me be

'Cos I'm the little boy

My blood runs hot in my veins
If you want action call my name

I can make your looks very funny
Change your usual shape
I will get in every cell of yours
Make you feel well

Do you have a weird feeling like
Something would rip your eyes out
Do you feel the black rain of death
Sowing seeds of horror

I am the little boy

My blood runs hot in my veins
If you want action call my name
Your blood runs cold to the ground
No sign of you is to be found

[Lead: Roope]

Hello, hello boy, it's time to wake up
Did you have a nightmare?
Or did you sleep at all
Was it all
Real delusion?

'Cos I'm the little boy
Yes, I'm the little

The Little boy
