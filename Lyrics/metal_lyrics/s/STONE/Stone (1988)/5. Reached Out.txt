You trapped me in this place like an animal
In it's cage
I'm chained and it's hard to breathe
I need the sunlight to clear up my face
I gotta find my way out of here

You tried to brainwash me but
My mind was too dirty
So you're keeping me down here
Isolated from the civilized human race
Helping them to forget
Twisted minded people

You'd better
Fuck off and die [2x]

Reached out!
I've reached out, I've got a surprise for you
Reached out!
I've reached out, I got one death to do
Reached out!
I've reached out, I've got a surprise for you
Reached out!
Just one death to do

Sadistic party is to begin
And you're playing the lead
I'd love to watch your rotten cropse dance
Your death is all I need
The pleasure will be all mine

You'd better
Fuck off and die [2x]
Pic up your bones and
Fuck off and die [2x]

Reached out!
I've reached out, I've got a surprise for you
Reached out!
I've reached out, I got one death to do
Reached out!
I've reached out, I've got a surprise for you
Reached out!
Just one death to do

[Lead: Roope]

[Lead: Jiri]

Fuck off and die [4x]

Reached out!
I've reached out, I've got a surprise for you
Reached out!
I've reached out, I got one death to do
Reached out!
I've reached out, I've got a surprise for you
Reached out!
Just one death to do
