Hear the sound of music, make it come louder
Make your neighborsrip their ears off
Go to the streets and look at the situtation
Kick those fat asses and
Cry out these words

Bang your head, kill your soul
Let your fucking head explode
Cut your veins, rip your brain
You'll go insane

Overtake, overtake
Overtake your life
Overtake, overtake
Make your body cry
Overtake, overtake
Overtake your life
Overtake, overtake

We're gnna destroy this old fashioned world
*Cos I wanna life full speed and
Fuck this place down
And there comes a man-of-honour, a warhero
It's good to be nothing but you're
Less than zero

Bang your head, kill your soul
Let your fucking head explode
Cut your veins, rip your brain
You'll go insane

Now you, you thinkg that you're something
And you think that you're tough
Still you're just the same asshole
Like all of us
Look out, I'll take you down
There's no coming back
I just wanna live hard and fast

[Lead: Roope]

[Lead: Jiri]

Overtake, overtake
Overtake your life
Overtake, overtake
Make your body cry
Overtake, overtake
Overtake your life
Overtake, overtake
