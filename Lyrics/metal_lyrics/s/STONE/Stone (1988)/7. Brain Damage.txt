I'm just a barf of this civilized world
A spit on it's innocent face
Live no steady life, won't hide myself
Behind a silly mask
Don't fit in the modern life
It don't have what I need
So I've got

Brain damage!

Cloned good servants wearing a smiling mask
Slowly hanged to their own tie
Rules echo in their heads, thoughts stand still
Or they just go around
Their eyes aren't blind but they cannot see
That they are used
Hard for free
I think they have

Brain damage!

Look into my eyes
Don't stare at empty walls
You act like living dead
Haven't you ever tried to live
The real life?

Now it's time
To wake from eternal nightmare
And breathe fresh air
Don't you think it's finally
The time to get free

Time to get free

Brain damage!

Rip off that mask and look in the mirror
Is there anything you have seen before?
You could see all your feelings and thoughts
You haven't had a chance to show
Wake from your nightmares
Look life into the eye
Are you ready to cry
I've got

Brain damage!
