Black curtain is fading the lights out
My eyes are blinded
Sorrow in my head, pain fills my brain
I'm gonna explode unless I get
Speed in my vein

God knows I want to break free
But the pain is too much
So help me, please
I know this ain't the right way out
What could I dou, I couldn't
Face the truth

Fight the truth, forget it
Escape from reality
Killing my feelings and lighting
My brain
The easiest way to forgive myself

Run, hide
Fight, hard
Run, hide
But I'll die

My time is running out, my end nears
I must change, I must see the light
Only god could help me, he'd give
The power
But I can't live without speed
Am I a coward

Run, hide - Try to escape
Fight, hard - But there's no way out
Run, hide - Try to escape
But I'll die - My time's run out

Damage crept up on me, pain turned too high
My brain was overloaded, ready to blow up
What was in my mind before
It was emptied...

[Lead: Roope]

Feeling things suck my brain out
Flaming in my head
Now I'm resting in peace without pain
But there's one thing you should know
I died with joy

Run, hide - Try to escape
Fight, hard - But there's no way out
Run, hide - Try to escape
But I'll die - My time's run out
