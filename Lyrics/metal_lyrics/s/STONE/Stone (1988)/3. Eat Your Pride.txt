Little priest with a little church
Bored with easy life
You want the reputation, the glory and game
What would be the shortest way
To the distant shining stars
Everything is eas with
The name of God

You started a war. said we're
Children of evil
But you'd better take it back
'Cos we're your heart attack

You gotta eaty your pride
Or you gonna die
There's no other way to stay alive

Ain't it little hard to swallow, the biggest
Religious swindle
Just beg your god to save you
From the naughty boys

You gotta eaty your pride
Or you gonna die
There's no other way to stay alive

Your life is in our hands, no mrecy is shown
Did you really think that you could
Destroy us on you own
Huh!!!

[Lead: Roope]

You gotta eaty your pride
Or you gonna die
There's no other way to stay alive
