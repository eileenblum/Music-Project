Got a hair cut, took a shower, shaved and
sprayed macho deodorant
Put on your brand-new jogging suit
Which cost a lot to your dad
And you feel so fresh

Daddy promised to borrow his
mersedes benz
You're ready to show yourself
To your friends
Meet 'em and say "hello"
Think "Ain't I a jolly good fellow"
Then you see ugly long haired dirt bags
Which are farting, screaming and
smelling bad
"Are they really that childish, they
make me feel sick"

Tell 'em to leave this modern place
"You're such a big disgrace"
"Don't you play your music here
What's that noice?"
Now you'll

Get stoned!
Get stoned!
Get stoned!
Get stoned, your ears are bleeding
And you have become stone deaf
Get stoned, and get again until the end
'Till you're stone dead
So get stoned again

See your jogging suit ripping apart
Under it there is dirty black jeans
Take another overdose of music
Your hair's growing long and
Your bored mind is getting crasy

[Lead: Roope]

Get stoned!
Get stoned!
Get stoned!
Get stoned, your ears are bleeding
And you have become stone deaf
Get stoned, and get again until the end
'Till you're stone dead
So get stoned again

[Lead: Jiri]
