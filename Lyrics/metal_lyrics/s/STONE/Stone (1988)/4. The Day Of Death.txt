[Roope and Janne]

You know this is the day
You've come here for a fight
Brave men full of themselves
But you know
This is your final day

You got no chance
To prevent the day

Thousand to one like one to thousand
Twisted faces coming to meet
Their own fate

You are falling to eternity
'cos you're against me
Do you mean this is the holy war
I'm the chosen one
The new messiah

[Acoustic guitar Roope]

Gotta tell you all
Listen to me

[Lead Roope]

You're trying to kill me but it won't
Close the opened gate
It's coming

[Lead guitars in following 8 bars Janne]

The day of death

[Lead Jiri]
