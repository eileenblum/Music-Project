You have big muscles, a long black hair
Play guitar in the cellars, you want out at any cost
This manager here will make you a star
She'll create an image for you
One of those spitting ones...

Kill - While others play, you kill
Praise - Praise yourself, the king of heavy metal

[Lead: Roope]

That piece of advice got you into the charts
You think your fans fear and respect you now
"But I want them to fear me more"

[Lead: Jiri, Jiri &amp; Roope]

I think you are ridicilous and silly
Is this all because of the size of your willie
You play macho man to a 13-year-old chick
You'd love to explore her porcelain with your prick

You dress like if you lived in the iron age
Your intelligence quotient is pretty much the same
Head full of LSD, acting gorilla on stage
Or are you acting at all?

You're a meat mincing machine, "it's so fucking fun!"
You wanna be as sharp and lethal as an x-ray gun
And be as famous as ex-president Reagan
Well done!

The wide wall between your role and true yourself
Is fading away, so you have to choose which way to go
Fear me more!
You gotta go further and further
Fear me more!
Or wake up from this bad dream
Wake me up!
Please, mrs nice manager
Wake me up!
