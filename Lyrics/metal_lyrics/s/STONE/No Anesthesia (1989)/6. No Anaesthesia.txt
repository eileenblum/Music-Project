A white bodybuilding man looking for a delicate boy
Who wants to get submited and be treated
As a cheap toy
Looking for a real adventure? I'm all that boy needs
I got rubberboots, leatherwhip, everything!
Balls full of seeds

C'mon fear me boy, taste my fire, I'm gonna give it to you
WIth no anesthesia!

You read this in one of those magazines
And begin to feel really tight in your jeans
At once you know this one is for you
You're change to be loved and shown your love too

Get down, down on your knees
Make it slippery with greace
This dreams been going on every night
You're sure he loves you 'cos you got it so tight

How do you want it?
No anesthesia!
He's the dentist, you are a patient in pain
No anesthesia!
You're a special client so he locks the door
PLease dear doc, drill my hole with
No anesthesia!
Let's see what you can take 'cos he's no fake

Obey what he says!
Take off you clothes and he'll tie you to the floor
He'll give you a lesson that
You couldn't have dreamed of before

Fear what he says!
Cry you're hurt, beg mercy, yell your
Skin is burning!
For him this is just a start, wait till
You see his little dog

How do you want it?
No anesthesia!
He's the dentist, you are a patient in pain
No anesthesia!
You're a special client so he locks the door
PLease dear doc, drill my hole with
No anesthesia!
Let's see what you can take 'cos he's no fake
