No rain but thick shells
Two rhinos are having a good time
Don't ever get in their way, you're an ant
They'll roll over you
Now you will see what it's like to be
When we are going back to the stone age!

Rhinos rule what you do, your life depends on them
Be quiet and build your hill
Or you'll begin to feel quite ill

The celebration has no ending
They fight and roar screams of joy
Lands gone through vast destruction
Now the land is just a useless toy

Lick their wounds, say you enjoyed the show
The world is like a raging beast
We've gone back to the stone age!

Rhinos rule what you do, your life depends on them
Be quiet and build your hill
Or you'll begin to feel quite ill

[Lead: Jiri]

Now there's no rhinos, died after the final feast
But strong ants will survive, build up a better world

[Lead: Roope]

Back to the stone age!
