Ain't I so nice, mother you're so wice
I'll satisfie your will
You've tied me tight but I won't fight
Because I don't dare to try

A holy place disgrace, after having been
A bad bad boy

You like to see me cry, fact you can't deny
Mother I ask you why?
If I hurt your honour, you push me back into my corner

You want to protect me from the wicked world outside
you keep me in your empire of glass and i'm your pride

I dream of breaking the glass and stepping into unknown
But do I have strength to pull myself over
The wall of fear
What would happen to my mother
Would I hurt your feeligns
Would you still take me back if I missed you too much

[Leads: Roope, Jiri]

Spoke up my mind, mother you're not so kind
I'm back in the corner
I'm begging thanksgiving, "you must be kidding"
Guessed I did dissapoint you, oh mommy, I'm so sorry

A holy place for disgrace, after having been
A bad bad boy

To this white sheep, raising stuck cuts too deep
I think I'm done
The cuts will bleed 'cos you don't have
What they really need

You wanted to protect me from my dream wolrd outside
Kept me in your empire of glass, say bye bye to your pride
