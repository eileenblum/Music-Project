Where are my foes?
Being like shadows intrusive?
They hunted me
Until it was too late
I'm like a doe
So fleet of foot and elusive
My secret trump is
My own last faith
So many times
I had my wings broken and fell
Embraced with thorns
Up to regenerate
So many times
I gathered myself to rebel
My major law is
My own last faith

Be yourself for living
Be open to whom you are feeling
Be closer to the sunlight
When time's gone my hope is
Lost in all these memories
Seeking for the reasons
I will burn down the joy
To create I've got first to destroy
Farewell to my love
When I am forgotten
And dreams will become rotten
I will live in silence

All I need is to see your eyes
See in them your beautiful souls
Feel the beat of your open hearts
Open up your sincerity source
All I need is to become wiser
See you all at a glance
Not causing pain to anyone
Making needless your defence

To stop breathing
Is to stop believing
No faith - no life
Deny evil
Don't look back and have free will
Leaving your past
