Distant light is tempting
To the gifts outside,
Towards never ending
Rainbows and delight
Herald of the future,
What've you brought for us?
Adventures?
Bell roulades?
Don't seek your road
It's in your blood
Permanent scar
Unique as you are
But there is a danger
Leading you to wrath
To remain a stranger,
Lose your unique path

Everyone's a pilgrim
Stiffen at the crossroads
Unknown brim
Appears to him
Don't seek your road
It's in your blood
Permanent scar
Unique as you are

What you search for may arrive alone
There you hear far above,
Something that can't be shown
Where you're near...
The path, unique path...

Free to go or not to
He steps in the mist
Free to chose, he's got to
Give up or resist
Free to leave behind
Frankness... goodness ... fake ...
Stars of a fallen kind
Swimming in the lake
