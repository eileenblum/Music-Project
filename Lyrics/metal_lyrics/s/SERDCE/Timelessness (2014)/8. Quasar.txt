We are losing face
On the struggling way
So many places
We must pay
Those who hold the billions
Make them all with lies
Leaving hungry millions
Just before our eyes

No, but neither you nor me
And they will never make us free
No, neither me nor you
Let's go through fate
To meet deja vu

All shall be gone astray
Nothing will remind of this day
We can reach anywhere
Setting life anew and share
Soul concatenating
Conscious elevating
Putting symbols into traces
Always taking different faces - quasar

Fear feeds the chaos
In our hearts inside
Wasting blood for nothing
Makes their peace of mind
Parasites are hiding
Behind the weakness shell
It is always blinding
Cultivating hell
