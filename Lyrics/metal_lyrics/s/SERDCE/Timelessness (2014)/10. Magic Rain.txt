Knock, knock fades in
Magic rain steps
Fake opinions
Not on your lips
Open all doors
Flowers bloom
Through the downpour
Rainbows loom

After a storm
Comes a calm

Then comes long-awaited peace
Time will be painted with lives

I found myself I can breath oh sky tears
I see the light

Space of the sun
Trees all around
I stopped running
I'm lost and found
Magic rain
Save my eyes
All the words are vain
My mind rises

I'm drunk with rain I can smile I feel no pain
I found my way

Stands still
Clock without hands
Sucked down in a swirl
Stream expands
Knock at my soul
Purify my feelings
Gentle flow
I need it now
