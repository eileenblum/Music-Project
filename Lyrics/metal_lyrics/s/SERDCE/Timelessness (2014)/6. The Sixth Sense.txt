Don't believe in rumors
Sense will show the road
Leading to the universe,
To your real abode

When you've abandoned
Hopes for salvation
All of a sudden
Dawns inspiration
Breaking through the ceiling
Rises a rainbow
Something you're feeling
But cannot name now

Enigmatic treasures
In this final well
Key for every question,
Pearl for every shell

Try again to forget
The pain of growing wings
Now you're falling, so let
Your spirit trust the winds

They will show you the truth
And bestow on you the wisdom source

Listen to no more lies
Your inner voice alone
Can be your guiding light
Live a life your own

Which is higher than peoples' eyes
For you to be self-cognized

Don't leave this sacred place
Here's all origins and ends
And remember to seize the days
Follow your sixth sense
