...I'm following the way of labor,
Following the way of faith's shield...
I'm coming listening to my heart,
My steps are persistence and tirelessness
I'm looking for you,
The land of the worthy and ambitious ones,
Of souls shining with purity,
For you, beyond the eye's reach,
For evil and vice incorruptible land
