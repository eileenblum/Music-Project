Promise me a new life
You know I like it most 
In that's the whole you are
The spiral of the reasons 
Tired to survive
Bring me back my home
And I close my eyes
Waiting for a surprise
Lullaby injection 
Indifference infection
Itâs too late to change or start all over 
Birds still sing, but songs are getting lower 
Things must be pretentious
To make me heady 
Does it mean that I am 
An emotions addict? 
Try to hurt me, fellow 
See Iâm like a ghost 
All your knives and arrows
Are just flying across
Paper soldier, holed chest
Growing older, losing zest 
Women come and vanish 
Streets are full of beggars
Flowers grow and perish
Nothing really matters
Spill of cosmic shower 
In its flight endeavour 
Maybe Iâll recover
Maybe never ever
