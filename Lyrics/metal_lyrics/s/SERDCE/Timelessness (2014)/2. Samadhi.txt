Could you escape yourself
Could you combine two selves,
Where's your harmony's gate,
How would you cheat the fate?
I would chose one truth to follow
I'll endow my heart with sense
I'd look forward to tomorrow,
Let is step inside my fence

Stay in my arms of flowers here
Beautiful life is up to be
Take your chance of feeling free
Can you see Samadhi?

You are just mortal flesh
Pliable to lie as to hash
Are you so poisoned with
Your intoxicant dreams?
I would fight off any liar
Burn myself on lie's bonfire
Dreams are finite, lie's a threat,
But my hope is infinite

Of feeling free
Can you see
Samadhi?
