I opened sanctity of my soul,
Entrusting that image of humanity
I tirelessly gave away the secrecy off all words,
Tearing away from heart sincerity doomed
By misunderstand
I biased the eye of reality on my knees,
Bowing feelings bared with naivet'e to scaffold of envy
The time pouring with misdeeds,
Cause the life is full of them,
Heartless and alien
Spiritual loneliness
Abandoned words are drafty
With dirty discredity backwardly
I'm moving off with numb anguish,
Taking of the mask of sympathy,
Dressing up with spiritual solitude
Exhausted, i solve the task
Of madly mute prophecy
I'm afraid to be mistaken in myself,
To lose patience in fear
Where is that i looked for:
Began without blind end?
Where are those, who i trusted,
Those, who are faceless now?
Spiritual loneliness
