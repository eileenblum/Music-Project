Hands dropped, on my knees
I bury my vim in the ground
Suffocate in false shadow,
And languid fear-i won't live
My will besieged-to blunt my senses
Endowed with wild passion,
Deprived of naivet'e,
Being touched by pure anger,
I'm tied with vanity
Leaving all
Memories, love-my sister,
Of which i'm sick there
Wise tale of hackneyed phrases,
Trace of dimmed offence
Without a backward glance,
I leave the world of other's
Imperishable bottom tired me out,
Weak-will dropped down
Blindly they read from above,
Missing all between the lines
Sink in phantom heights
Forgive my sins
Those, which i won't regret
I'm seeing through our days:
Render lifeless, gorging,
Hoping for idleness, copulating with
Vainness
Touching firmness,
Joining rebelliousness,
Bending under hope,
Fall asleep in dream's hands
Do not trick myself again
