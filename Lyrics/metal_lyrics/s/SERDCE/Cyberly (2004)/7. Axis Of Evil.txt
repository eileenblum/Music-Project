Tear, cut, but we even stand not in place
Breathing lies, drawing apart the vise
Applaud, press down my faithfulness
I know only one: the evil will be rendered
We perish, sink, on the bottom of bottom we moan
Don't live-we just exist, passing by the justice
We chastise the will, breaking the hopes with pain
Burning our nerves, we lose the faith
So-are you free-form?
Yes. i am the god and freedom
Evil-is your real mask?
Enough to ask
I know..., the question is not
Answered. to live in minds
Calm down, all much easier
In creation to pretty?
Reflection will kill you
It is irreversible
And it is in vain
You are dissembling... future is nowhere
Where are you, freedom from love, from god
I'm here, far off life, off poisonous thoughts
Wander, without hope, melting before death,
Rescue lost men, who are before lies
Here it comes, truth-recovery of sight sincere
I stay to be blind to contemptible, haughty
Applaud, press down my faithfulness
I know only one: the evil will be rendered
Axis of evil...
