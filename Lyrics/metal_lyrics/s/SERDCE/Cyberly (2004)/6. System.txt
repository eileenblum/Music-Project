Idleness was disgusted,
Flesh was materialized in creator
Stinking withered,
Sunken faith was contemptible
Death was prayed,
Was discovered in legend
Was fornicated with reason,
Father was beared to blind men
Your eyes smoulder
Shroud yourself with reality
Have a reputation for truth
Break your wattles and twigs
Eyes smoulder
The tear is full of ashes
Leave behind
You good for foolishness was united,
Was reverently doused with lies
They sworn on blood,
And bend from carnage of fate
The side of fire of violence,
Produces' weakness
By great sorrow,
By faceless help
