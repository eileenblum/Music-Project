Loosing my feelings. releasing  myself
You wont understand
My thoughts are awake. weakness feels tired
You're not gonna get me
I'm flying away. not leaving a change for compassion
Run, run again. roots placed good for nothing connection
I despise the life. condemn the death
Rise like a fire between furious flooks
Here die. here-give your head away to the blooks
Freedom is showing off. ugliness is petty
Scutched face-face of harmony,
Touched by icons the preacher of teared up soul
Slauting faith very blind wisdom
I'm satisfied with sacred feed
"me" forbids me to speak of what i am sick
Avaricious craftiness old hope
The edge is a thin-thin string
Not to live life to the end... there to be quiet
Believe- or don't believe, you won't change reality
For brand new paradise day
There is an invitation to sleep.!. to sleep never ending sleep
The end fades away. looses its beginning
I'm sick of eternity which is imprisoned in dirt
My mind sinked, fell to the bottom
Slauting faith. very blind wisdom
I'm satisfied with sacred feed
"me" forbids me to speak of what i am sick
How will be then. i won't forget
Awaken shame of eatings,
A lot of insults and vanity of tiresome faces
Loosing my feelings...
