I want to watch you drown in your lies
The end of your masquerade, a matter of time
Interwining lies, domination, control

What pain will it take
To satisfy your sick appetite
Go in for the kill
Always in sight-prey
The time always right-feast
Feed on the pain-taste
Sorrow made flesh-sweet
Live how you want
Just don't feed on me
If you doubt what i say
I will make you believe
Shallow are words from those who starve
For a dream not their own to slash and scar

Big words, small mind
Behind the pain you will find
A scavenger of human sorrow
Scavenger
Abstract theory the weapon of choice
Used by scavenger of human sorrow
Scavenger

I am one of many that see through your lies
Hiding will do you no good, many seek revenge
Soon to become a victim of what you live to create
