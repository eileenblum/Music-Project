Don't feed me with, amenities of these places
Don't torture me with. the vernal expanses
Don't torment me with the mortal sugariness
Don't love me with your feudal miserliness
I'm sorry for my rebelliousness
Dirt on my knees-freedom is for free
Don't raise forbidden border:
My world is different, the world of disorder
My world is another world
Get burned with mute indifference
Grow roots of imperishable mutilation
Fall on your knees in front of yourself:
Black to white. shadows for light
Give up undefeated zeal
And killing anxious feelings
You'll understand fascinating by pain,
My world is different the world is vain
My world is another world
My world-different world. not for your lie
I see your burning eyes. never mind
Your soul is not here, she does not belong to you
She as blind
Can not sweeten realty with dreams,
You can't bring lethal back to life
Can not defend fallen by nobility,
Can not keep worn-out faith
Do you see your existence?
More primitive, much more obscure
And you understand irreversibly:
My world is different, the world of blind
