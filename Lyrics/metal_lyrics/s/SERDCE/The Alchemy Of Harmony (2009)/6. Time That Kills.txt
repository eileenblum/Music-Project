Am I In A Hurry To Live
Or Just To Be, It Doesn't Matter
Not To Turn Back From Your Path
And Not To Lose Sincerity
Confront A Mishap Face To Face
The Only Truth Here Is
When I Kill Time, Time Kills Me
Time Kills Me
No Use Repeat The Words That Have Been Said
No Truth In Answers To False Questions
No Way To Take
Back The Things That Were Lost
No Time To Hesitate
As Our Future Begins Today
The Only Truth Here Is
When I Kill Time, Time Kills Me
Did You Think To Turn Away, I've Lost My Time To Awake Inside
And My Voice Like Broken Hopes Runs Away To Some Place Wide
When You Live I Am Awaken
When I'm Walking You Shall Live
We Don't Want It All Revealed
Life Is Freed
It's Easy To Gain Authority
From Someone Else's Achievements
But Still So Hard To Be
Tolerant Of Uselessness
And Be Aware Of That
The Only Truth Here Is
When I Kill Time, Time Kills Me
Time Kills Me
