Emotions, Tears, Sufferings
No Honesty They Have Without Understanding-
In Unity Is Everything
And It's Reversible In One Or Other Way
It All Depends On Moments Your
Mind May Hear
And Rise Or Loath
Your Secret Passions
With Wild Prejudice
It Won't Be Pacified
And Fake Delight Will Not Be Taken
Deception Is Accepted Not
There Is One Self That Dares Another One Self That Isn't
There's No Beginning For Commencement
Mind Is Free, Voices Inside Me
No Way For Standard View At All
Serenity Does Not Exist There
But Doubts Are Put To Suffer
With Unavailing Hopes
