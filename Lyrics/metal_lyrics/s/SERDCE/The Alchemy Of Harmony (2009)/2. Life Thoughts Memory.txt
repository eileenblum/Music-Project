The Deceased Can Appear More Alive Than The Alive
Dolls Can Be More Sincere Than The Heartfelt
Hopelessness Can Be Stronger Than All The Sick
And Senses More Anxious Than They Are Suppose To Be
Sometimes Idleness Can Be Covered By Joy
And Hides The Emptiness Behind The Dignity And Choice
We Seem To Be Happy And Self-Satisfied
But The Beauty Is Unseen As It Passes By
Days Are Going Away But Still Are Staying With Us
It's So Hard And Still So Easy To See Them Being Lost
As We Fall For The Sake Of Flattery
As Ungratefully We Ruin Our Memory
To Forget And To Remember All
Is Like Separating A Reality From Illusion
To Remember But To Forget All
Is Like Stirring The Truth With Myths As Fusion
Sometimes Idleness Can Be Covered By Joy
And Hides The Emptiness Behind The Dignity And Choice
Days Are Going Away But Still Are Staying With Us
It's So Hard And Still So Easy To See Them Being Lost
