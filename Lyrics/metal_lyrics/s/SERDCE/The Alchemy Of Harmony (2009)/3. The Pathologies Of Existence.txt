All That We See Day After Day
All That They Are Speaking Of Us Everywhere
All That I See Day After Day
All That We See Day After Day
All That We Breathe Is Just A Pale Shade
Of That Life We All Dream About
Uncertainty-What Is It?

The Burden Of Daily Occurrence It Is...
That's âcause We're Weak!
We Are Hopelessly Sick!

To Return Just For Going Away
Or To Leave Just For Coming Back
Is It A Whim That Parts Our Ways?

And Whose Whim's Make Them Meet Again?

Who Are You And What Are You-
The Pathologies Of Existence?

In Idleness And Pleasure
You Waste Such Precious Time
The Blind Will Not Recover Their Sight
And The Oppressed Shall All Be Blessed In Heaven
Beliefs Will Make The Skepticism Dumb
And Weakness By The Strength Will Be Defeated
