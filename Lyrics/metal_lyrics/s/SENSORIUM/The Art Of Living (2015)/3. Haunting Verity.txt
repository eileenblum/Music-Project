[Lyrics by Ksenia Glonty]

"...A thought awoke. It exhausted and crushed down his ingenuous straightforward mind. He tossed about seeking a way out, a solution to his predicamentâ¦"
[M. A. Sholokhov, "And Quiet Flows the Don".]

[Verse 1:]
Cold shining stars
Hang low over the steppe
Home is so farâ¦
Trying to make the right step
Exhausted soul flounces in search for verity
I close my eyes, hoping to find clarity
Rebellious spirit burns in me

[Chorus 1:]
How many more tears will be shad?
Will this pathway ever end?
But in this never ending night
You'll always be my guiding light!

[Verse 2:]
Futile battles,
A chain of restless days
And boiling metal
Takes hundreds lives away
Harassing questions haunt my thoughts, torture my mind
Leaving behind
Wrinkles on my face
By feverish doubts I'm embraced

[Chorus 2:]
Did our desires lead us astray?
To enemies we now obey!
In bloody crossroads of the war
You're in my heart, forevermore!

[Chorus 2 &amp; chorus 1]
