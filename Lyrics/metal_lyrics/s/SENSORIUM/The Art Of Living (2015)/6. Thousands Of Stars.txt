[Lyrics by Michael Timoshko]

[Verse 1:]
Like an angel
You appear in my dream
You hold me near and I feel a strange fear
Tears are streaming down my lips
You smile, but in your eyes
I am disappeared

[Chorus:]
Thousands of stars
Are drawing your name in the sky
You are so far away and my heart is broken apart
The day will come- I'll take your hand and we will fly away together
I miss youâ¦

[Verse 2:]
What does it mean? One look, one kiss
No more words, no more lies
Just a heart in the corner bleeds to dust
You went out of the shadows and flied
Hunting high and low, looking for more and more
Chasing yourself, playing with your fears

[Chorus:]
Thousands of stars
Are drawing your name in the sky
You are so far away and my heart is broken apart
The day will come- I'll take your hand and we will fly away together
I miss youâ¦
