[Lyrics by Ksenia Glonty]

[Verse 1:]
Wading through a snowstorm
Through frost-bound forests
We tirelessly moving forward, knowing no rest
Rough our hands, severe our spirit
Fearless men of midnight lands!

[Bridge:]
Gods of war will bless our swords
And whispering their last words
Our enemies
Will be brought to their knees
This battle will bring death
We'll fight till our last breath,
Never give up!

[Chorus:]
If one of us will fall
Valkyries will arrive to take his soul
By Odin's side he'll stand
In glory light!

[Verse 2:]
Nourished by winter
Tempered with cold wind
Steadfast warriors knowing no defeat
Ice is our armor, blizzard is our shield
We ride
In moonless night

[Bridge:]
Gods of war will bless our swords
And whispering their last words
Our enemies
Will be brought to their knees
This battle will bring death
We'll fight till our last breath,
Never give up!

[Chorus:]
If one of us will fall
Valkyries will arrive to take his soul
By Odin's side he'll stand
In glory light!

[Choir:]
Valkyries will arrive now to take his soul

[Choir:]
Gods of war will bless our
Swords and whispering their
Last words our enemies
Will be brought to their knees
This battle will bring death
We'll fight till our last breath!.....
