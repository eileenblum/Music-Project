[Lyrics by Michael Timoshko]

[Verse 1:]
There is a light behind that doorâ¦
Keeping their secrets
The walls are hard as stone
Pale moon will show the way
There are no words to say
I am asking you to stay
The wind will tell you
Where to go

[Chorus:]
Moments of hope
Are filling my destiny
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Magic will give you the power
To stop this hour

[Verse 2:]
There is a light behind the darkest side
Keeping its secrets
Like a mysterious mind
The wind will whisper:
"She will be forever yours!â¦"
Bright moon will show you the way
All I'm asking you is to stay!

[Chorus:]
Moments of hope
Are filling my destiny
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Magic will give you the power
To stop this hour

[Chorus 2:]
Moments of hope
Are filling my destiny
Tomorrow is a history
But yesterday became a mystery
Magic will give you the power
To sacrifice the time
