[Lyrics by Ksenia Glonty]

[Verse 1:]
Time is passing by and slowly
Loses its breath
Sun is going down so lonely
In a frosty west

[Bridge:]
Cold spiny wind is blowing
All the hopes away
While fading life is flowing
Into a snowy haze

[Chorus:]
Within a frozen moment
Million flashes sweeping by
Oh, why
It suddenly became so easy
To stop this torment
To spread the wings and fly
Into a crystal winter sky !

[Verse 2:]
Solace is dwelt in
Wide opened eyes
Memories are melting
Like fragile ice

[Bridge 2:]
Soon salvation
Will bring long-awaited end
Reaching primordial creation
Uniting with rough land

[Chorus:]
Within a frozen moment
Million flashes sweeping by
Oh, why
It suddenly became so easy
To stop this torment
To spread the wings and fly
Into a crystal winter sky !
