[Lyrics by Yosef Bartov]

[Verse 1:]
Living in the shadows, where there is no place to go
Living in the shadows, where there is no place to dream
Taking a deep breath to fight against my fears

[Bridge:]
Live the moment to understand the destiny

[Chorus:]
Listen to the silence to find the way
Help me
Save me

[Verse 2:]
Do you remember when nothing was everything?
Lies, cause what sounded good to you determined your choice
Your knowledge is fading, and this battle is just the beginning

[Bridge:]
Live the moment to understand the destiny

[Chorus:]
Listen to the silence to find the way
Help me
Save me

[Chorus 2x]
