[Lyrics by Ksenia Glonty]

[Verse 1:]
You're going up while coming down
Trying to wake up you turn around
Space folding like a house of cards
You're screaming so loud
But there's no sound

[Chorus:]
You shatter
Into little pieces of your fears
You're scattered
Like a beam of lightâ¦ and disappear
[Bridge:]
An eternal darkness spread in all dimensions
It is so glaringly bright- it makes you blink

[Verse 2:]
Open your eyes, lump in the throat
Everything seems normal, but it's not
Making a step outside the bed
You're looking down
But there's no ground

[Chorus:]
Losing your mind,
Being swallowed by the light
Falling so high
Through an endless white

[Bridge:]
Milky tentacles twined around your body
They pull you to the depth of reality collapsed

Lying on the bottom of your consciousness
I dissolve in itâ¦. I've betrayed myself
Save me, I can't resist anymore!
