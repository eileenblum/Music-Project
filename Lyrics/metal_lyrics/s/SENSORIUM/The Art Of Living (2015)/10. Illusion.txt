[Lyrics by Yosef Bartov]

[Verse 1]
Not so far from here
There is are big mountain
Taken by the evil
Look close between the illusions
A new way to fight
No religion to pray
No chance to believe
Just stay quiet and think

[Bridge:]
Different time, same place
No chance to break the illusion

[Chorus:]
Think what happened in your past
Maybe your soul was taken?...
And now you're getting into
A suicide game!
Touched by an angel
Talking deep inside me
He says: "stay with me
The evil knows who you areâ¦

Who you are!"

[Verse 2:]
Words of a banished evil
Are whispering in my ear
For how long shall I hear it?
Remember those times
When everything was so clear?
Fear was just a sensation
To fight against the unreal!

[Bridge:]
Different time, same place
No chance to break the illusion

[Chorus:]
Think what happened in your past
Maybe your soul was taken?...
And now you're getting into
A suicide game!
Touched by an angel
Talking deep inside me
He says: "stay with me
The evil knows who you areâ¦

Who you are!"
