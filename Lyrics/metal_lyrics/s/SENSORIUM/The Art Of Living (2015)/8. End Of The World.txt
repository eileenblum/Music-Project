[Lyrics by Yosef Bartov]

[Verse 1:]
My confusion got to find another way
To tell the untold ... reality
So far I feel a strange reaction
And I can see inside myself
Visions that show me how can I get out of here

Identities I've never seen before

â¦Before!

[Chorus:]
So is this the end of the world?
We need a miracle to carry on
Somehow the pain is gonna stay beneath your skin
Is there a way to get out?

Way to get out!

[Verse 2:]
When does it gonna end?
I'm mentally blind
I take a deep breath
And try to figure out
What the hell is going on?
Black clouds, earthquake
We're inside the stormâ¦

The storm!

[Chorus:]
So is this the end of the world?
We need a miracle to carry on
Somehow the pain is gonna stay beneath your skin
Is there a way to get out?

Way to get out!
