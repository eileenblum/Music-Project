[Lyrics by Ksenia Glonty]

[Verse 1:]
Step into this glassy fragile world
It's so inviting, yet so cold
Being sure that you can break it
Slowly you become its prey

[Bridge 1:]
Mirrors will show you what you want to see
Making real your wildest fantasies

[Chorus:]
They'll make you laugh, they'll make you cry
They drive your fears, control your mind
Find the way out, don't stop your tries
Realm of crooked mirrors made you blind!

[Verse 2:]
The white turns black and black turns white
You can't distinguish wrong from right
Truth is turned from inside out
You're hypnotized, you have no doubt

[Bridge 2:]
Your soul is now distorted, depraved
Mirrors had made you their faithful slave

[Chorus:]
They'll make you laugh, they'll make you cry
They drive your fears, control your mind
Find the way out, don't stop your tries
Realm of crooked mirrors made you blind!
