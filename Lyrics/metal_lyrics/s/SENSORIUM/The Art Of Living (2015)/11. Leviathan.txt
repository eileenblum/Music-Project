[Lyrics by Ksenia Glonty]

[God:]
-The one who contends with the Almighty
One word will he ever pronounce?

[Iov (Job):]
-Here I am, I'm unworthy, what can I answer you?
I put my hands on my mouth!

[God:]
-Everything beneath the heavens is my creation
Even the mightiest of all!

-Breathing fire from his maw
His eyes are like the rays of dawn
Power inside, Fear is ahead
He rises up- storm at his command!

[God:]
 -Would you condemn me to justify yourself?
Would you discredit my justice?

[Iov (Job):]
-Nothing can stand in the way of your intentions
Now I know what a miracle is!

[God:]
Everything beneath the heavens is my creation
Even the mightiest of all!

-Breathing fire from his maw
His eyes are like the rays of dawn
Power inside, Fear is ahead
He rises up- storm at his command!

-Chest of rock, heart of stone
There is no weakness at his bones
His blazing sight will throw you down
King over all the proud!
