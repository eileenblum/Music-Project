[Lyrics by Yosef Bartov]

[Verse 1:]
Proud to pay the price for living
Bleeding in my eyes, not feeling my legs
No one cares about you now
The silence is the solution

[Bridge:]
Screaming without voice
Watching without eyes
Reflections in my mind
Teach me how to lie

[Chorus:]
What if this is a dream?
What if I'm just living beyond this life?
It might be worth to take a close look at infinity

[Verse 2:]
You may think you own the end
Take another way to calm down
Sadness in your eyes trying to explain
Where are you getting into?

[Bridge:]
Screaming without voice
Watching without eyes
Reflections in my mind
Teach me how to lie

[Chorus:]
What if this is a dream?
What if I'm just living beyond this life?
It might be worth to take a close look at infinity

Faith
Consumed
In a
Darkness
Labyrinth

[Chorus]
