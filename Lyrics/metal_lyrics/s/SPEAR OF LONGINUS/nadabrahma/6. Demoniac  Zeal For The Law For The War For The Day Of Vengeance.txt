[Blasphemy cover]

Who has thrown me into the Suffering of Worlds, Who has transported me to the evil darkness?
Grief and woe I suffer in this body-format. How often must I put it on, how often put it off...
Who has carried me into captivity, to the guilty ones. Sons of the vain Dwelling?
Woe woe to the maker of my body
Woe woe to the chainer of my soul
Woe woe to the rebels who have reduced me to servitude.
This tribe of Souls transported here, from the house of life, to the rebels who make war day after day.
