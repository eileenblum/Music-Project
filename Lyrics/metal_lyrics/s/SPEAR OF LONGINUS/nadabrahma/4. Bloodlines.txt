Cut me I bleed
Ancestors
Flow from me
Memories...
Distant past
Invade my mind
With deathlike grasp

Bloodlines
Honour and pride
Bloodlines
Descendants of gods

Feel the pain of history
Tomorrow, yesterday
Dreams, visions, reality
Comes to life, known as me

Bloodlines
Eternity
Bloodlines
We Are Gods
