We're in the shadow of atomic power
Humanity is counting down the hours
The atmosphere is boiling with hate
All buttons, set to obliterate
Armageddon, a holocaust of flames
Infernal force of total war and pain
Mega-destruction in final attack
So be easy, my friend, to cop the flak
Mega-Nutron, Nutron Hammer
Tumultous power, Nutron Hammer
Satan's Voice, Nutron Hammer

Million mega-tons ready to exterminate
Global culture, huh, meets its final fate
Earth lies a shattered burning ruin
A murmur of a new world is brewing
Nuclear winter kills the weak who cower
And the strong and ready win the power
Maybe hope of human restoration
Lies in a warheads devastation?
