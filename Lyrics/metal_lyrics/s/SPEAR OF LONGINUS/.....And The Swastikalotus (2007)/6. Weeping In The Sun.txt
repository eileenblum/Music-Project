Warm tears, sunlight.

A strange heat, feeling discomfort.
Now I'm walking,
But I seem to be
......... In front of my body.

Why is it so slow?
I can't keep up, I'm burning up.
There it is, I'm looking at it!

Strange

I don't seem to be able to grasp
Anything, or, feel the ground.
Beyond an almost magnetic
pull/field
Interaction.

Burning up.
Electromagnetic Vougancy.
