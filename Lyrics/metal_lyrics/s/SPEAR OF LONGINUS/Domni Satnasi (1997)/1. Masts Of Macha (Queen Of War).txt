Macha queen of war
Reaper of the battlefield
Working your magic
With blood of the slain

Cloaked in feathers of the raven
You look on
As warriors fight for your favour
Masts of Macha

A warning to all her enemies
Warriors heedless to her call
Die in the clash to come

She who loves war
Has also to love death
Celebrating a howling ecstasy
Grief and lamentation
