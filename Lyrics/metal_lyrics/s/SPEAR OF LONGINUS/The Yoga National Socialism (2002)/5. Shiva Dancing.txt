I am the dancer, the audience
The stage and the show
I dance divinly. I watch. I know

You are dance
You are all the movements of the universe.
Galaxies complete, planets ( suns.
In the dance we will meet
And you will say. "We are one".

Beware ye of the flesh
For the afterlife cometh...
Like a snake who sloughs his skin.
Like the forgotten dream upon awakening.

Beware ye of the blue throat
Thought impressions of desire may linger...
&amp; gloom to be fulfilled, fear not,
the power of VEL is yours.
