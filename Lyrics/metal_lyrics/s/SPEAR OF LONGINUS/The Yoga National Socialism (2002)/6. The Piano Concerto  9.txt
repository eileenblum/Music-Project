When I look down on this world ( my people )
From this place Akshara ( Artoga ) of the mid-guard
Serpent

I feel such pity......
For my ( our ) saviour ( messiah 0 is such destroyed
And your king, shackled and silenced.......
There be only doom.....pain and disease

...When shall we ( or could we ever? )
Rise again
