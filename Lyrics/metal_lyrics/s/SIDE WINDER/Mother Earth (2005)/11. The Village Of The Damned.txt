Back from the north, where the battle has raged,
I've led the victory.
Since the charge has begun
Mephisto lead my sword! (Hey!)
There's a screaming child,
Inside my hand...

(Glory!) for the king!
They all have to die!!!
I'll murder their children and I will rape their wives!
Till the sun shine in their eyes,
My heart will be in flames!
Only for the king, only for glory!

I have become a dog of war...
I am immortal, I feel no pain!
I've been sent in a purgatory... Yeah, yeah, yeah...
To face my destiny, I've been sent to this Hell:

[Chorus:]
The Village, The Village, The Village Of The Damned,
The Village, The Village, The Village Of The Damned!
The Village, The Village, The Village Of The Damned,
The Village, The Village, The Village Of The Damned!

Here they call me the judge, who brings them a chance!
I am "The Sanguinary!"
I am here to reign (Hey!)
They all have to obey!
They ask me a favor,
They all want redemption...

Suddenly, a flash came,
Mephisto sends me here:
"You are dead my friend, this is my present!
You'll force those poor powder to send me their souls,
Only for me, I am your master!"

Something hard for me to understand,
My people burned my Human shape...
They called me the heretic... Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Sun I've been judge, oh yes, but now is your turn... in...

The Village, The Village, The Village Of The Damned,
The Village, The Village, The Village Of The Damned!
The Village, The Village, The Village Of The Damned,
The Village, The Village, The Village Of The Damned!

(The Village! The Village!) The Village Of The Damned!
(The Village! The Village!) The Village Of The Damned!
(The Village! The Village!) The Village Of The Damned!
(The Village! The Village!) The Village Of The Damned!

The Village, The Village, The Village Of The Damned,
The Village, The Village, The Village Of The Damned!
The Village, The Village, The Village Of The Damned,
The Village, The Village, The Village Of The Damned!

(The Village! The Village!) The Village Of The Damned!
(The Village! The Village!) The Village Of The Damned!
(The Village! The Village!) The Village Of The Damned!
(The Village! The Village!) The Village Of The Damned!

(The Village! The Village!) The Village Of The Damned!
(The Village! The Village!) The Village Of The Damned!
(The Village! The Village!) The Village Of The Damned!
(The Village! The Village!)

The Vi... llage... Of The Damned...
