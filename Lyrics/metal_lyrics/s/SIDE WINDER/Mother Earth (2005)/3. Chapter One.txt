Oooh... In the night when you're sleeping,
When you've just closed your eyes,
Here is the time you've been waiting
For your dreams to be alive...

Winds of the mind, blow in my soul...
Set me free! Yeah!

Oooh... Bird of dream, spread your wings now,
Fly with me, switch on my night!
Fantasy, an open mind
My eyes they'll read my book of life!

Winds of the mind, blow in my soul...
Set me free!
Lord of the night, fly by my side...
Light my dream...

[Chorus:]
Keeper of the mind...
Open the book of time and read me the Chapter One...
Keeper of the blinds...
Be my light, welcome me into the Chapter One...

Oh, Chapter One!

Will you fight the misty morning!
Will you ride the dragonfly!
Will you tame this land of magic!
Will you save the lady's life!

Will this castle be your realm!
Will your key lock darkness time!
Will you cross the rainbow bridge
Before it turns to black tonight!

Winds of the mind, blow in my soul...
Set me free!
Lord of the night, fly by my side...
Light my dream...

Keeper of the mind...
Open the book of time and read me the Chapter One...
Keeper of the blinds...
Be my light, welcome me into the Chapter One...

Oh, Chapter One!

In my dreams I feel the light...
I cross the rainbow, I ride the clouds...
My sword's nothing to fear: I just find my way...

In my book of dream I never die...
Winds of magic caress my lies...
I don't want to wake: I wanna sleep away...

Book, give me the answer... Alone, I'm alone...
Book, give me the answer... Alone, I'm alone...
Book, give me the answer... Alone, I'm alone...
Book, give me the answer... Alone, I'm alone...

Hey... Ooooh... Open the book...
Hey... Read the Chapter One...
Hey... Ooooh... Open the book...
Hey... Read the Chapter One...
