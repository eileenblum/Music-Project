No work, no love, no home:
Forsaken in modern world!
You can't hold the future in your hand,
You can't trust the crystal ball!

They promised you happiness,
Knowledge, pretty women and gold!
Still on the pavement you're helpless :
You ask people for a few coin!

[Chorus:]
Take a look in the mirror,
Because you're always on the run!
On the razor's edge you're now,
And one day you're gonna fall...
...Down!...

They can destroy your life,
But they'll never kill your dreams!
As long as your spirit flies,
You won't belong to nobody!

But in this world of cold stone,
You try to see on through dark clouds!
Hoping for a rainbow to come,
And yet it never rises!

Take a look in the mirror,
Because you're always on the run!
On the razor's edge you're now,
And one day you're gonna fall...
...Down!...

Take a look in the mirror,
Because you're always on the run!
On the razor's edge you're now,
And one day you're gonna fall...
...Down!...

Take a look in the mirror,
Because you're always on the run!
On the razor's edge you're now,
And one day you're gonna fall...
...Down!...

Down!

Doooooooooooooooooooooooooooown!
