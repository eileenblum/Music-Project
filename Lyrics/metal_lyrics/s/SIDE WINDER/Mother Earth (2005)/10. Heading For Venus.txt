Travelling on through the sky,
We're on the way to the stars...
Far away! Far away!
Far away! Far away!

This unknown world we're flying in,
Faster than the speed of light...
But how far? How far?
How far? How far?

Where we are: to the stars!
What's up now? Eternal life...

[Chorus:]
Heading For Venus we all fly,
Beyond the stars, we'll find a life
Different from ours,
And they'll welcome us all...

Heading For Venus we all fly,
Beyond the stars, we'll find a life
Different from ours,
And they'll welcome us all...

Darkness, mystery of life,
Light shows the way to mankind...
Will the future be the past?
Will your anger be a smile?

Searching for an answer,
Starlight tells us history of life...
Far and wide! Far and wide!
Far and wide! Far and wide!

Heading For Venus we all fly,
Beyond the stars, we'll find a life
Different from ours,
And they'll welcome us all...

Heading For Venus we all fly,
Beyond the stars, we'll find a life
Different from ours,
And they'll welcome us all...

Darkness, mystery of life,
Light shows the way to mankind...
Will the future be the past?
Will your anger be a smile?
