[This song is dedicated to Mali]

The day you left us there, like a knife in the back!
Can't you see the emptiness, I feel when you look at me from above?
Medley of pain and regrets, will we meet another day?
Your body shape is lying there, why did you choose this way?

[Chorus]
Dreams at night,
I hear your voice through and empty sky, (Will we catch the rainbow?)
Will we catch the rainbow?
Tears running from my eyes!
Dreams at night,
hear your voice through and empty sky, (Will we catch the rainbow?)
Will we catch the rainbow?
Tears running from my eyes...

Your final judgement came, you're an angel, I've no doubt!
Light my fire at home, I'm cold, feel your heat warm, and I hold out hand...
Sing it loud my song to wipe my tears and rage away!
In time we will meet my friend, and I will join the dance...

Dreams at night,
I hear your voice through and empty sky, (Will we catch the rainbow?)
Will we catch the rainbow?
Tears running from my eyes!
Dreams at night,
hear your voice through and empty sky, (Will we catch the rainbow?)
Will we catch the rainbow?
Tears running from my eyes...

And now, there's Silence...
And now, there's Silence!
And now, there's Silence...
And now, there's Silence!
And now, there's Silence...
And now, there's Silence!

And now, there's Silence... No, no...

Dreams at night!
Dreams at night...
