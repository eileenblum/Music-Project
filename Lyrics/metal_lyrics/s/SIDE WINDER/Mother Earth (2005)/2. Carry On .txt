Wo oh oooh... Oh oh oh oooh...
Oh oh oh oh, woh oh oh, oh oh oooh...

You don't believe in their future
And you hardly trust in what you see...
Contemplating how this world has turned,
You're no longer slave to their own dreams...
You would like to burn the fire
But the ice around you make it freeze...
You would walk over the water
But the river's turned to dry and deep...

That's the way it is! Yah yah yah!

[Chorus]
Carry On! Don't give up,
Bring on hope, build a new world!
Carry On! Carry On!
Carry On! Don't give up,
Bring on hope, build a new world!

You would like to brave the thunder
But when lightning strikes, what can you feel?
You would be the Latin lover
But pretty Juliet she knows the scene!

That's the way it is! Yah yah yah!

Carry On! Don't give up,
Bring on hope, build a new world!
Carry On! Carry On!
Carry On! Don't give up,
Bring on hope, build a new world!

Let your instinct draw you the way
To get set your feelings free! Yeah!
Be yourself, don't obey their orders
If they mean nonsense to your dreams...

Carry On and make it real!

Carry On! Don't give up,
Bring on hope, build a new world!
Carry On! Carry On!
Carry On! Don't give up,
Bring on hope, build a new world!

Let your instinct draw you the way
To get set your feelings free! Yeah!
Be yourself, don't obey their orders
If they mean nonsense to your dreams...

Carry On and make it real!

Carry On! Don't give up,
Bring on hope, build a new world!
Carry On! Carry On!
Carry On! Don't give up,
Bring on hope, build a new world!

Carry On! Don't give up,
Bring on hope, build a new world!
Carry On! Carry On!
Carry On! Don't give up,
Bring on hope, build a new world!

Carry On! Don't give up,
Bring on hope, build a new world!
Carry On! Carry On!
Carry On! Don't give up,
Bring on hope, build a new world!
