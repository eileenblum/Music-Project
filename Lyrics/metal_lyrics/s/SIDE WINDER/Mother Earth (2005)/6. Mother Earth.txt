All across the sphere everyone takes his right to live his life!
We all need new toys making us rich, but rich of what?
To satisfy all those caprice we build and produce more and more!
Oh Mother Earth the caveman has grew really too much now!

[Chorus]
How many signs, until we realize?
Our selfish acts, lead to the end of mankind!
Oh Mother Earth, how long the sun will shine?
How many times do we deserve to survive?

All across the sphere fly clouds full of gas and full of fuel,
Every year the lung of our world vanished into dust...
The whole of the polar crust is bleeding his ice in the beam
The smoke we vomit on your face reopen the hole of your mask!

How many signs, until we realize?
Our selfish acts, lead to the end of mankind!
Oh Mother Earth, how long the sun will shine?
How many times do we deserve to survive?

How many signs, until we realize?
Our selfish acts, lead to the end of mankind!
Oh Mother Earth, how long the sun will shine?
How many times do we deserve to survive?

How many signs, until we realize?
Our selfish acts, lead to the end of mankind!

Oh Mother Earth, take care of you!!!
We don't deserve to live in such a paradise!
