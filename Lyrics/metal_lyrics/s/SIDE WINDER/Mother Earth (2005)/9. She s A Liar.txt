A sunny day, a funny afternoon:
An open gate for another day to come soon, yeah!
With you upstairs, two lovers in the room.
Playing our games, no witness but the moon, yeah!

So long sweet lies, playing with hearts is a danger!
Trapped in green eyes : green like hope and desire...

When morning comes she tells you : "No remorse."
The day after your road she'll never cross!

So long sweet lies, playing with hearts is a danger!
Your words were lies, your sweet voice is nothing but thunder!

[Chorus :]
She's A Liar! She plays with fire, indeed she's so cold!
She's A Liar! She plays with fire, indeed she's so cold!
She's A Liar! She's A Liar!
She plays with fire, indeed she's so cold...
...and alone...

So long sweet lies, playing with hearts is a danger!
Your lips were not mine, just a dream on a picture...

Aaaaaaaaaa, yeeeaaaaaaah!

She can kiss you when the other's away!
Pretend to love one, while it's the other she waits...

So long sweet lies, playing with hearts is a danger!
Trapped in green eyes : green like hope, but they're Liar!

She's A Liar! She plays with fire, indeed she's so cold!
She's A Liar! She plays with fire, indeed she's so cold!
She's A Liar! She's A Liar!
She plays with fire, indeed she's so cold...
...and alone...
