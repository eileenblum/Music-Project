Dark was the sky when flash of lightning - Oh oh...
Gave birth to a snake, then came the shining - No no no...
Blood in the eyes, ready to bite... He was waiting
To become the lord of the night... The almighty!

[Chorus:]
I have no fear! My faith and my beliefs
Are just for the one who hisses... Side Winder take me!
You blow over my life, never steal my dreams,
Strong is the venom that you give... Side Winder is king! Hey!

Then down the stairs, dead man was standing - Oh oh...
He looked at the snake, and started laughing - No no no...
Red was his cloak, a top hat he wore... He was smoking...
The lightning snake blessed him and then... Enslaved him!

I have no fear! My faith and my beliefs
Are just for the one who hisses... Side Winder take me!
You blow over my life, never steal my dreams,
Strong is the venom that you give... Side Winder is king! Hey!

Ha ha ha...

I have no fear! My faith and my beliefs
Are just for the one who hisses... Side Winder take me!
You blow over my life, never steal my dreams,
Strong is the venom that you give... Side Winder is king! Hey!
