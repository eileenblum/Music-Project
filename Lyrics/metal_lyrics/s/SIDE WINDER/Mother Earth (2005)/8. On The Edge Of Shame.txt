A misty dawn, a gloomy town, nothing but an ordinary day.
A slippery pavement, a broken home, shall I leave or shall I stay?

It's two cities, but one people, nothing but curiosity.
They made them part, building a wall, it wasn't so long ago you see...

When politics drive humans blind, and when they play with the peace of mind, (Oooooooh...)
When power brings anger and pain : world on Edge...
When politics drive humans blind, and when they play with the peace of mind, (Oooooooh...)
When power brings anger and pain : we're On The Edge Of Shame...

A sunny dawn, a gloomy land, nothing but an ordinary day.
A dusty ground, a broken stone, shall I leave or shall I stay?

It's one country but two people, nothing but animosity,
They made them part in the name of God, it happens now, who cares you see...

When religion drives humans blind, an eye for an eye as a peace of mind, (Oooooooh...)
When spirits bring anger and pain : world on Edge...
When religion drives humans blind, an eye for an eye as a peace of mind, (Oooooooh...)
When spirits bring anger and pain : we're On The Edge Of Shame...

A misty dawn, a gloomy town, nothing but an ordinary day.
It's two cities, but one people, nothing but curiosity.

Woooh, oooh...
On The Edge Of Shame!
Woooh, ouh oooh! Yeah, yeah!
On The Edge Of Shame!
