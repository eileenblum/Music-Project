Have you ever been that amazed when the light
Draws a Shadow behind you?
Then you're wondering why this spot at your back
Wanders as a part of you...

[Chorus]
Oooh, oooh, can you feel this Shadow's Ghost
That's haunting your path?
Oooh, oooh, can you feel it?
Oooh, oooh, oh oh, can you feel this motion Shadow
In your back?
...overtaking you...

If you could run faster than the speed of light,
And if you managed to get through...
Would you break this link that draws you to your past?
Would the Ghost fly over you?

Oooh, oooh, can you feel this Shadow's Ghost
That's haunting your path?
Oooh, oooh, can you feel it?
Oooh, oooh, oh oh, whatever the speed you run
Your Shadow lasts...
...it belongs to you...

Could you ride over the future, could you find
The key to the door of souls?
The day will come, I know, my Shadow blinds your life!
I was right... Too late for you...

Oooh, oooh, can you feel this Shadow's Ghost
That's haunting your path?
Oooh, oooh, can you feel it?
Oooh, oooh, oh oh, if you trip over
You have to pay the price...
...of your folly...!

Shadow's Ghost
Keeps your past as a memorial,
Shadow's Ghost!
Ooh, ouh oh oh... It will haunt you...
Shadow's Ghost
Will watch your back! Your step! Your fall!
Ooh, ouh oh oh... Forever your crown of shame,
Your crown of shame, crown of shame!!!
