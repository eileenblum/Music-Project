Hold still
Until I come back home
100 days makes my heart sink like stone

Let the noise drown out your thoughts
Turn up the radio
Pretend that you're fine
When you're not

Don't you know I've been waiting so long?
Don't you know I've been wrong?

Try to break before the smoke
Keep, keep looking forward
Just don't look at the wreckage
You might be concerned

I look for replacements
To fill empty space states away
Just give me a reason to come back home
I feel so alone
As the distance grows

I can tell this time
As I slowly lose all hope
This will never work for us

Don't you know I've been waiting so long?
Don't you know I've been wrong?
Don't you know I've been waiting so long?
So long

You said that we'd make this last
But maybe we were wrong

I can't stop the thought
That this road will tear us apart

I know that this road
Is going to be the bend before the break
I know that this emptiness is going to fade
I've given up on counting days

I think it's best to forget I exist
And I'll keep wishing
To one day, to one day
To one day be by your side

I'm sick like a sailor
I've been lost at sea
I see your reflection
It's haunting me, in my dreams
Waves continue to break, but
I'll weather the storm
Just give me a reason
To come back home
To come back home
