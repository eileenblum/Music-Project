All the time I'm falling
You look away from me
Persevere
Give it some time and surely you will

Know what's important.
You sip the cup of life then
Fall in monotony
Rights of Passage

What's happened before me?
Your judgment is blind, but it still sees me

And I don't fear where I'm going
Once again
Every day is all the same,
I fall amongst the sorry and ashamed

Yeah I fall away, I fall away

And it's hard to wake from reveries of doubt
It's hard to wake from doubt
It's hard to wake from doubt

Tell me, why can't you sleep?
No consequence you can lose from

Don't give up, you
You can win
Just don't lose sight of what's within
Show them what you're made of.

I open the door to find you asleep
This note your reading is yours alone to keep

This is, who I am

Listen closely, don't hold back or run
Use your choices to guide the unwilling

I'll find what I've been longing for
If all goes to plan I'll outgrow this place
A chance I must take. I must take.

And I don't fear where I'm going
Once again

Tonight!
And I still haven't a clue
If I'm hopelessly entangled in you
As I fall giving my all
What do I want for this to be?

What I want this to be!
