The city splits
Imperfections high as mountains block my view of you
Forget your past
As I only wanted you to love me too
Me too

I move alone
Till another mistake
Embrace what cold is

You can stretch, stretch yourself thin
When will this end?
You're on your own

Lose it to the guys
You think you need
Oh baby please you've got a disease
I suspect that I am being replaced
I guess it's just a part of your game
Wipe this half hearted look off your face!
Because I can't live this way

I try, try to catch my breath
Take one step to my death
Help me
Take one step to my death

Every day
that goes past without your face
And all I want is out of reach

Oh, I can't reach

You took this all from me
Now I want it back
That was your chance
Now you are gone for good

Come on, come on,
You know all of my regret is yours for the taking
Come on, come on,
Lets see if you're worth your weight in gold

The streets run red with clients you left for dead
Did they still get their bill?
Now I watch your life descend to hell

Come on, come on,
I'm stepping up to the plate
I'm yours for the taking
Come on, come on,
I'm stepping up to the plate

Forget our past
As I only wanted you to move on too
No one needs you to move on

I'm moving
I'm moving on
I can't live this way
That was your chance

I'm setting sail
And there's nothing that I can't reach
With no plot and direction
Reach
Savor this moment
Tomorrow is long
