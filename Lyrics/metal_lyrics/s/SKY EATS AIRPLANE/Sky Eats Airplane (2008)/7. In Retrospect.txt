Go ahead and knock me out
It hurts so good since you're all I've got

The last thing that you said to me
was that you and I were meant to be

Hold my hand and check my pulse
Revive me with just one touch
You'll never want to end this

Go ahead and knock me out
It hurts so good and you're all I've got

No hospital's gonna save you from
a broken heart a broken heart
No arms could reach you and your regrets
Sweet dreams on your last night

I hold your hand and check your pulse
You're already out cold on the floor
Go ahead and knock me out
It hurts so good since, since you're all that I've got

No hospital's gonna save you from
a broken heart a broken heart
No arms could reach you and your regrets
I need you in my life

Don't do this to yourself
You're the only thing I've got
And the only one I want
is never gonna stop
SHE'S KILLING HERSELF TO SLEEP
Sweet dreams and rest in peace.
