You're all wrong
I've got enough
Cheap love to cash out on

Come one, come all
It's gonna be your last chance to see
This ship is sinking
Slowly
And I have given up on every dream
And every ounce of hope

Everything you touch
You somehow find a way to break
Under the veil of love
You set ablaze everything in your way

Torch a broken home
And bury yourself beneath the smoke
Leave her enough rope
And she can escape while there's still hope

Come one, come all
Who wants to be another victim of my insecurities
Come on
I'll take everything you've ever known
And leave you broken on the floor

Try
To follow my scent
I'll kill again
You don't have enough time left
Should I make you beg for your last breath?

Everything you touch
You somehow find a way to break
Under the veil of love
You set ablaze everything in your way

Tell me
Who wants to be another victim of my insecurity?
It's time
You better get in line

We all have our secrets
that we should keep
The air whispers
in my ear
what deeds you've done

I'm back again
I'm gonna be the last one left standing
I wanna be for everything that you're not

I'm back again
This is where your path comes to an end
I wanna be for everything that you're not

That you're not
Everything
That you're not
