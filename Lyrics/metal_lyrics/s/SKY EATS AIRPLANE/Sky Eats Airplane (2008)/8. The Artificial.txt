Hand me your lies
Hand me my keys.

You have to give it all up
When you realize
What you're leaving behind
I wish I was lost,
But this was an alternate destination.

Watch life flash before your eyes and
hope for the best.
Even in this well-lit room,
Where you lay down to rest
You cast a shadow that stabs you in the back

This all began so well,
and was the longest spiral ...
downward I've ever felt.
You would've been the death of me
if I stuck around much longer
These months of sickness felt like I
was sleeping six feet underground.

You can't tell the difference between what's real and not
Find the truth or you will lose yourself forever.

I know it's not all your fault
I knew early on what I was getting myself into.

Go ahead, be my guest, work on everything that closed our door
Everything I worked so hard for

You said you walked the line, but you're the one falling short
Actions speak louder than words.

When you realize
What you're leaving behind
I wish I was lost,
But this was an alternate destination.

With no plot
And no path laid out
I swear I'm not lost
I'm not lost

You were offered the world and turned it down
Shed no tear, and hope to break out on your own
I Refuse to call this place home
