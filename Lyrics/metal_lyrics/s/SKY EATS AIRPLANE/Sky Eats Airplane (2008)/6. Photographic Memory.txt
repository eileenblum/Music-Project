I look on the back of the picture
Just a short synopsis with year and date
We look so perfect
But the truth is
I remembered it was killing me

We lie face down
Hand in hand
There's no regrets
Taped to the back

I got lost on the ride home
With a chance to escape this hold
You're the reason this city feels just like home
When we're together

With you by my side
A camera can make all time... stand still
And make this moment... perfect

What our minds think looking back
Is that we're never coming back

There's no use for this burnt out match
I pace the hallway with one name on my mind
the only name that mattered so much
Is the one who's words I crushed

There's no use for this burnt out match
A dozen puzzle pieces fall onto the floor
Wanting more is all I ask for
I got lost on the ride from
Seeing you

I was too busy
thinking of you
If only you knew

This Photograph doesn't speak the truth
This Photograph doesn't speak the truth
If only you knew

Blinded by
light on the other side
If only you knew.
