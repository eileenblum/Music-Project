So close yet still so far
You can run but you'll never escape
I tried to pull myself together but
I guess its too late

I am the fire in your heart
Go to sleep and wait for the spark
Will you forgive me for this day
My life's a waste

This is the anchor that makes me drown
I hope that you will never live this down
Abandon all your hope just to leave this mess
Out of anyone I should know you best

Watch what a marvel this is
To make your breath stop

You are the gasoline
I am the fire that burns down to the ground
still there will be nothing left

Sweat drips down from my head
As I feel the heat from where I stand
Believe me, I'm not gonna save you
You'll be forever burned alive.
