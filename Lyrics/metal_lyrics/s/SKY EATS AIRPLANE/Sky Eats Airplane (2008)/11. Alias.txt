You said you're fine,
It seems like you lost your mind.
Take what face you find and call it your own
Whatever makes you think you're not alone?

You look into the machine
To escape from the very own life you live.
It's time to bury the only body you have left,
Hold your breath,
Make it quick.

Come close, tell me your name.
You mislead them all,
Even yourself
You've been hiding
From us all
For so long

Let's see your face.

You said you're fine,
It seems like you lost your mind.
Take what face you can find and call it your own.
Whatever makes you think you're not alone?

I'm in love with someone not real
Pack your bags with fake name tags
And leave.

Your biggest secret is a weakness for the truth,
For the truth.

Come close, tell me your name.
Tell me your game.

There's a noose around my neck,
Hold on 'til I cant look back
Anymore.

You're floating high

You're a fake through closed doors
All alone
I've got a life to live but where is yours?
Nicknames you think you are
You think you are

Don't you think I can change? [x2]
Just for you...
Don't you think I can change? [x2]
Just for you...

You're floating high,
You're floating high.

I can't look back.

You said you're fine,
It seems like you've lost your mind. (you left me here to die)
(to die) You said you're fine, (you left me here)
Living your life all alone.
