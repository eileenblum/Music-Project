The veil is drawn
Dim lights in blue and red, crawl up from the cracks,
as I heard the words you said
You said "Don't go!
This place is dangerous they're hunting down, tired souls"
But I'd packed my things and left without one word

For you darling, I'll dearly miss
Don't dare betray me with a kiss And you can't let go cause...
This is our last dance baby, give flesh and bones to this
As snakes, we shed our skin, and begin to part with it

As if I hadn't told you yet, never trust a Southern boy,
for my smile is sweet, and my accent endearing
All the while it's your heart I will be stealing

This is the part where regret will get you,
haunted how he could somehow forget you,
ever danced like you meant it
Our bodies burned, yeah, you felt it
All the while, all alone
Must have known you were losing control of it
Now you're face down, in the stars that back our story's sky

If you could even move, much less breathe
Then we could dance and not just tease
As one flinch brings us closer You know...
This is our last dance baby, give flesh and bones to this
As snakes, we shed our skin, and begin to part with it

Did someone hear your last words? Forgive you all your sins?
No, cause I left no witnesses nor, a single fingerprint
Tune in, turn on, veer off, and drop out
My siren satellite you're circling the stage
