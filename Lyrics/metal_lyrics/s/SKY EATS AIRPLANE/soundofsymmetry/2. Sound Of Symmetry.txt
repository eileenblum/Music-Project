How trails of thoughts are lost inside the pause around you
This is the sound of symmetry, between the ground, and gravity

Standing high, looking down at city lights
In the making of an emergency, I'll turn around and walk away
Did you think I would let you leave?
In the making of this emergency, I'll turn around and walk away...

Well 40 stories never looked so fun, learn to fall with me
Take a chance don't forget to jump Close your eyes and breathe

I'll eat you alive, if you haven't got the timing right
You will be all mine, I'll hunt you down

Cause I stood and watched you define betrayal, I'm right here...
You tell me what you want but never what you need, give me a sign
Cause I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to say it's okay
You show me what you want but never what you need, give me a sign
Cause I'm not afraid...

I'm right here... Through the glass I hide behind,
you dream of things you'll never find
I'm right here... You haven't a clue who I am
But I know you all too well....
