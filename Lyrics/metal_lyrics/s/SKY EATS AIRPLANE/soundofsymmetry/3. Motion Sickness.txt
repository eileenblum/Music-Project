Take aim on treacherous waters
Now comes the feeling of panic and dread
Digital artifacts have replaced the sky
Now hold on tight, and close your eyes
A memory will last you a lifetime

White lace and cigarettes, what an alarming concoction
It picks apart the fabric of my brain
Now it's a simulated excuse,
to try and solve the things that I have left unexplained
Through perilous moments, trial and error
We'll try to find another hero for the day
Please don't expect me, know that you shouldn't
To change around my ambidextrous ways

Look to the sky, at the LED lights They're looking at you
Well my emotions weigh more than diamonds could ever compare
Trust me it's a circumventing issue at last
It's become a maritime nightmare, drifting for days

Inhale for air is salvation See each day like blinding lights
Breathe deep and know this moment won't be slipping
Won't be slipping, won't be slipping, always slipping away
