Take all your regrets,
And throw them aside.
Lets hope that you survive,
The "you deserve better"'s and blatant lies,
told by your closest enemies.
You wanted all I couldn't get
And now you're sick over my treasons.

I hope you never notice,
but what's done is done
And now i can't come back.

I'm just chasing after,
what i can't ever reach.
