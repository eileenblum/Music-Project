I used to be someone you knew,
From the beginning he dreamt of conquering.
The obsession of his life had begun to outdo
Anything anyone had ever done before.

From a clear sky he stared
Upon where he had started from.

All that's left to own is yourself.

I have a cold sidewalk to sleep on
And I brave city walls
That have eaten men alive
I am the hitchhiker
Where will i be tomorrow?
Please feel sorry so they won't have to
The first person that listened to me was you
Where I'm from,
Where I'm going,
Is not important
You'll probably never see me again.

All that's left to own is yourself.
