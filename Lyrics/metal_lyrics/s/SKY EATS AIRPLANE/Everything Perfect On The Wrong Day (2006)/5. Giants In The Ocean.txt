Boundless water in an eternity frame of mind
And all that's lost is our time
Peaks break through open sky that grasps for land below.

Mountains climb and topple on themselves,
Steel breaks wave and sounds lull us to sleep.
All things drift quietly away.

Forget your cell phone man, it won't work here. [x2]

My cameras zoom - it captures all that might embrace it,
Unsteady ice creates the wake in deeper places
Oh darling I can't bear the thought of separation
The years will pass and we'll forget of how this made us.

There is substance in this silence
The proof of what surrounds us.
Photographs are a mirror image
Look deep and see yourself within them.

Seasickness, ancient forests, and water creatures
Keep us from thinking about home.
