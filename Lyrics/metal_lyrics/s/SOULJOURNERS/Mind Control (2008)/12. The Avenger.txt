I heard a tapping, someone gently rapping,
rapping at my chamber door.
It was my calling, my role was falling,
falling to the floor.

It's your turn so the crow cries,
I will never forget you.
Buildings turn and people die,
but real love is forever.

When euphoria starts to crawl up your back,
slammed tight up against the wall.
When that voice inside screams out its call:
"Victims aren't we all?"

Love's the key, unlocking death,
it brought me back here to end this.
I lost my life and many died,
but you and I reunited.

When euphoria starts to crawl up your back,
slammed tight up against the wall.
When that voice inside screams out its call:
"Victims aren't we all?"
"Victims aren't we all?"

When euphoria starts to crawl up your back,
slammed tight up against the wall.
When that voice inside screams out its call:
"Victims aren't we all?"

(Victims aren't we all?)
[x18]
The key to immortality is to live a life worth remembering.
Your dragon's curse is dead this time,
I'm returning to the scene of the crime.
Victims aren't we all?
Victims aren't we all?
