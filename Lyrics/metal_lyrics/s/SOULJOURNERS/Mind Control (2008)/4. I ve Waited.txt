I have waited so long for you.
I was alone, but somehow I knew
that I would find you, I would find you.
Next to you, my internal flame it starts.
Its love for you never fades away or stops.

If love is in our blood tonight,
then my veins are full.
It rushes to my head tonight,
now all I see is you.

Tu eres la luz de mi vida,
tu eres el sol en dÃ­as oscuros.
Buen maÃ±anitas a usted mi amor,
you are the one I have waited for.

Since we met, I have left my past behind.
We're slowing time, we won't have to say goodbye.
You give me life!

If love is in our blood tonight,
then my veins are full.
It rushes to my head tonight,
now all I see is you.

Tu eres la luz de mi vida,
tu eres el sol en dÃ­as oscuros.
Buen maÃ±anitas a usted mi amor,
you are the one I have waited for.

Tu eres la luz de mi vida,
tu eres el sol en dÃ­as oscuros.
Buen maÃ±anitas a usted mi amor,
you are the one I have waited for.
You are the one I have waited for!
You are the one!

You are the one, I've waited
and somehow I knew that I would find you...
That I would find you...
That I would find you...
