Lost my state of mind, feel me floating in my room.
Unconscious without direction.
The time is undefined wrapped up tight inside my tomb...
It's meant to give me protection. Protection.

I opened up my eyes, all my ties are coming loose...
A whole new civilization.
Why am I still alive trapped inside of their abuse?
It feels just like an abduction.

Then you try to escape like a rat from it's maze.
And you can't come awake and you don't even know.

It's a strange night in these crazy times.
You wish you were dead, but glad to be alive.
It's a strange sign when you lost your mind
and you think, "it's just another night" in all these crazy times... 
In all these crazy times.

Dive into the pool, feel the waters chill.
Take a hold for you. 
Am I still alive? Ohh Am I still alive?
Dragged out by your feet... Not controlled by me.
I can't even breath.
I see a darker light, I don't think that I'll survive.
Such a violent abduction.

Then you try to escape like a rat from it's maze.
And you can't come awake and you don't even know.

It's a strange night in these crazy times.
You wish you were dead, but glad to be alive.
It's a strange sign when you lost your mind
and you think, "it's just another night" in all these crazy times... 
In all these crazy times.

And I lie asleep in agitated state.
The nightmare is over 
or was I awake all this time?

Then you try to escape like a rat from it's maze.
And you can't come awake and you don't even know. You know.

It's a strange night in these crazy times.
You wish you were dead, but glad to be alive.
It's a strange sign when you lost your mind
and think "it's better to run for your life" For your life... 

It's a strange night in these crazy times.
You wish you were dead, but glad to be alive.
It's a strange sign when you lost your mind
and you think, "it's just another night" in all these crazy, crazy times... 
In all these crazy times.
In all these crazy...
