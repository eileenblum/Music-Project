It's time to wake up...

The minutes are passing by and I stretch myself so thin.
The shadows they catch my eye I find spirits wandering.
The bloodstains are telling why and I feel it setting in.
The moonlight uncovers lies and I'm left here wondering.

I'm cracking the shells of time and when I look to where I've been.
I'm getting constrasting signs when I try to comprehend.
I'm hiding in my disguise and I think I'm gonna win.
The daylight unmasks my eyes and I see them on my skin.

I feel my tired skin.

My eyes are blind... senses are heightening.
My hands are tied but stronger from fighting
and I've lost my direction to the place where you are
and how do I start to try to cover all these permanent scars?
All of these permanent scars.

The healing, it happens as I trust my faith within.
The darkness is passing by as I play this to the end.
The clutter, it finally dies and I move ahead again.
The spirit surpassing why and I feel it pouring in.
I feel it pouring in.

My eyes are blind... senses are heightening.
My hands are tied but stronger from fighting
and I've lost my direction to the place where you are
and how do I start to try to cover all these permanent scars?
All of these permanent scars.

My body breaks.
My soul starts to wake.
It drives through my veins. Through my veins.
The scars start to fade. Yeah.

All of these permanent scars.

My eyes are blind... senses are heightening.
My hands are tied but stronger from fighting
and I've lost my direction to the place where you are
and how do I start to try to cover all these permanent scars?
