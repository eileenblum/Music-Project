Why can't I break through these walls that conceal me?
My fists are bleeding from pounding on concrete.
Coldness it shatters the hope that I'm hearing,
my spirit's screaming "you'll never own me!"

They're building my room, I'm saying goodbye.
I've gotta break through, through.
They're watching me move,
they're watching me die.
I'm looking for you, you...

Are you, you ready to catch my fall?
Are you, you ready to catch my fall?
(Fall! Fall!)
You ready to catch my fall?

How do I cut through this horrible feeling?
My lungs quit breathing from inhaling toxin.
Numbness, it cripples the faith that I need and
my spirit's screaming "You'll never beat this!"

Feel it screaming out (all alone again),
hear me pleading (all alone again),
see me reaching out (all alone again),
now I'm feeling all alone.
This is burning (all alone again),
my stomach's turning (all alone again),
now I'm hurting (all alone again),
now I'm feeling all alone.
(Alone...)

Are you, you ready to catch my fall?
Are you, you ready to catch my fall?
Are you ready?!
Fall! - [x4]

They're building my room, I'm saying goodbye.
I'm looking for you, you...

Are you, you ready to catch my fall?
[x4]
How do I cut through this horrible feeling?
My lungs quit breathing from inhaling toxin!
You ready to catch my fall?!
You ready to catch my fall?!

(Are you ready to catch my fall?)
[x4]
Are you ready?!
