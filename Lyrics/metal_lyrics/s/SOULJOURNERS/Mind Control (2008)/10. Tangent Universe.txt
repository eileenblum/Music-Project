I feel I'm losing touch with reality
and all I say is broken into static waves.
There's so much I need to ask you,
but I'm afraid you'll tell me
everything will end today.

I tried to save my life,
but I lost my own.
This feeling inside I've never known.
Embracing death, I know this seems unfair.
I know you're hurting
and I know you're scared.

You know I'm sharing
the same air you're breathing,
you can feel me staring,
we're moving through time.
You know I'm trying to fix what's breaking,
every living creature on this earth dies alone...
Yeah!

I feel I'm losing tough with my gravity,
and all I do is fueled by my energy.
There's so much to ask you,
time is just slipping away.
My portal opens leading to my destiny.

This kind of fear I've never known,
(As death draws near)
to lose my life but give you hope.
(It is clear)
Embracing death, I know this seems unfair.
When you wake up tomorrow, I won't be there.

You know I'm sharing
the same air you're breathing,
you can feel me staring,
we're moving through time.
You know I'm trying to fix what's breaking,
every living creature on this earth dies alone...
Dies alone, it dies!

"As I die, I unlock the hope the world needs.
I had to make this decision to save your life.
Wait for me: I will return to set this right.
Don't fear them: they are just a mortal power.
When I return, there will be nothing to stop this.
The end is inevitable.
We can change the outcome of the tangent universe.
As I shift to the other side,
I ascend to a bright realm
where I will stay only for a matter of time.
I will return to set this right..."

You know I'm sharing
(You know I'm sharing)
the same air you're breathing.
(The same air you're breathing)
You know I'm sharing
(You know I'm sharing)
the same air you're breathing.
(We're moving through time)
You know I'm trying to fix what's breaking.
(We're moving through time)
Your sin is burning,
(burning down their home)
'cause every living creature on this earth,
it dies alone...dies alone.
It dies alone, dies alone!
