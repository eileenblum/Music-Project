You can't see anything,
close your eyes remembering.
I'm still here, I'll wait for you.
I need to see you, you gotta break through.
You are crying out loud,
your tears disintegrate.
You can see your reflection,
but can you see your face?
And when day turns to night,
you're all alone with you
and your door is closing,
you're out of view and...

Can you see me? Can you hear me
screaming your name?
Your life can't end this way.

All the ashes of them are blowing you away.
The fire's slowly spreading,
burning down your faith,
and you know it's not right
what they put you through.
Though your life is ending,
I'm still defending you and...

Can you see me? Can you hear me
screaming your name?
Your life can't end this...
Your life can't end this way.
