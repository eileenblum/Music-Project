Staring blankly into the sky,
waiting for answers to float on by.
But nothing comes quickly
and nothing is sure,
so is your triumph
worth all of your hurt?

It's the basis of humanity:
you gotta reach the highest throne.
If you sell your soul for the victory,
then you are alone.
(Sitting all alone)
You're trying to find a reason to live.
(The medicated memories are all I know)
You're trying to find your reason to stay,
but medication's calling me, it's my last hope.

And there's no pleasure in one who dies,
and there's no answers for your demise.
And death comes quickly, and death is sure,
so is your triumph worth all the ones you hurt?

It's the basis of humanity:
you gotta reach the highest throne.
They sell your soul for victory,
then leave you all alone.
(Sitting all alone)
You're trying to find a reason to live.
(The medicated memories are all I know)
You're trying to find your reason to stay,
but medication's calling me, it's my last hope.

You'll find it if you want your soul,
you'll find it if you want your life.
[x2]
If you want your life,
you want your life.
Do you want your life?

It is the basis of humanity:
yeah, we can reach the highest throne.
But if we sell our souls for the victory,
then we will end up all alone.
(Sitting all alone)

We're trying to find a reason to live.
(The medicated memories are all I know)
We're trying to find a reason to stay,
the medication's calling me, it's my last hope.
[x2]

What do you want from me? (We're losing you)
I can't take this anymore! (We're losing you)
Now nothing good could ever be, (We're losing you)
nothing worth the fighting for. (We're losing you)

Everything you see is the devil inside of me.
[x4]
(We're losing you)
[x8]
