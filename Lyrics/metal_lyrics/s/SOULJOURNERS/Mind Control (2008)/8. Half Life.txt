I know that I could find a way
to challenge the rules
instead of just eating them.
I know that there will come a day
when I will decide
exactly what's happening.
You've got the upper hand on me,
your grip is slowly tightening,
crushing if I should disagree.
What have you done to me?

Every time I try to speak free,
you're pushing down on me.
Inject my heart with a vile fluid,
you try to poison me.

Half your life is bleeding out,
half your life decaying now.
Virus multiplying,
you lost half your life...
lost half your life!

"Do what you're told and live today!"
Controlling the cards
instead of just dealing them.
I know I have the right to play,
harness the horse instead of just following.
You've got the tighter hold on me,
your grip is slowly loosening.
You're gonna listen carefully:
you're not controlling me!

Every time I try to speak free,
you're pushing down on me.
Inject my heart with a vile fluid,
you try to poison me.

Half your life is bleeding out,
half your life decaying now.
Virus multiplying,
you lost half your life...
lost half your life!

I was walking, clearing disorder,
and thinking a little bit longer
and feeling a little bit stronger.
I'll start again today.
Now I'm running, feeling the sun
where I'm hoping the load will be lighter,
and knowing the days will be brighter.
It's gonna be OK...

Every time I try to speak free,
you're pushing down on me.
Inject my heart with a vile fluid,
you try to poison me.

Half your life is bleeding out,
half your life decaying now.
Virus multiplying,
you lost half your life...
lost half your life!
