There's something inside our brains
the world cannot contain.
Our thoughts run rapidly,
so fast these eyes can't see them,
and if they take control,
who knows how far they'll go?
They take integrity and throw it away,
the new law says it's time to pay.

Erase my life, destroy my dreams,
there's nothing left, no in-between.
Test my faith against the law,
there's no one left, who do I call
when we are...

Brain-dead, force-fed, unable to cry
and dying slowly, hoping
to see the other side with these eyes...

Bird's eye view up here,
(Am I being chased?)
will the army clear?
(Am I insane?)
Feel them drawing near,
(I am insane)
what just happened here?

They want you to be a member,
your membership doesn't last forever.
Sign in blood and make my God illegal,
small drips of truth on a fire of evil.

You have erased my life, defaced my dreams,
replaced what's left somewhere in between.
A twisted faith, a stubborn law,
there's no one left who I can call.

Brain-dead, force-fed, unable to cry
and dying slowly, hoping
to see the other side with these eyes...
[x2]
These eyes... [x3]
