Wondering where the spark flies to when it's gone
The flame is fading, the candle burns low
So many years, they fade into the dust, the soul
I gave you, it needs to fly back
On that sun stained day I knew you were real
My spirit changed, I made it come back

Cause no words were spoken, no spells were cast
The lies were broken; I saw your face at last

Burn now into fate, your glory's fade to black
Your fires burned my heart; your soul can't journey back

Given a hard life to this, now that it's done my spirit can't roam
I never knew the price I'd pay, in sufferin' and sweat
Would I do it again?
I bear the marks the taint is in my blood, would you set me free, and take me on home
