As you pull me through this mental cesspool
Feelings of anger are seething all through me
My eyes burn red and my blood is boiling
Malevolent forces you've provoked in me

The blaze that lies behind my eyes,
Hatred drives, my muted cries

The tables turn you are now the victim
You scream for mercy but your just ignored
I burn with hate as my flames engulf you
My venom is cruel it's your just reward
Damn you all that laugh and mock me
You'll bear my curse when you hear my song

Once the calmness reigned and I would laugh and sing, with everything
Darkness came to call, shattered around us all
Stole the calm inside replaced it with a crimson tide!
