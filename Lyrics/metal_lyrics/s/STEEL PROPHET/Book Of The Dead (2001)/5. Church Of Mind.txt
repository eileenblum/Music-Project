Welcome to, my church of mind
Step inside, and take the ride
All that's here, is my own view
No one converts; it's not your church

Now I can see we all have our own church of mind
All points of view can exist within my own point of view
As sacred is to me, you don't need to follow my way
We all have our dreams, philosophies in our own church of mind

My sacraments, and rituals
Are my own, my sacred zone
Don't pretend, to know my ways
Each precious life must find it's own church of mind
