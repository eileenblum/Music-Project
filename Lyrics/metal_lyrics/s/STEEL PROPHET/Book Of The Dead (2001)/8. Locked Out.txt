Somehow I got locked on the outside
I'm trying to get back in
Can someone help me unlock the door
And welcome me back inside
Holding out for the answer
Seems like an eternity
Mysteries of the darkness
Concealed in secrecy

Help me I'm locked on the outside
The storm is pitching violently
Lead me in from the outside
Shelter my soul from the enemy

As people look right through me
Their amusement becomes my shame
In a synchronized society
Where the numbers replace their names
Karmic retribution it's a heavy cross to bear
Searching a lifetime for answers
Afflicted with despair
Somehow I got lost on my path
Distracted by deeds of the flesh
I can't silence this voice of oppression
Guardian angels lead my soul to rest
