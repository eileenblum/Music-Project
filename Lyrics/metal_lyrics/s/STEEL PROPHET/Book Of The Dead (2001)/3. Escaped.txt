Leaving now, that's enough
No one here, to call their bluff
For so long, I've had the dream
If I don't go, it's a lifelong scream

Escape! Is calling to me, I've never, ever felt free
Escape! Life is wasted unless, I take this chance and see another way

All my life, inside these walls
So much more, I've never seen
It seems, I would never know
What could be, what's my possibility?

[Solo: SK]

How's my story, going to end
I can't say, it's mine to live
I don't need, a lot of hope
This escape, is my mind set free
