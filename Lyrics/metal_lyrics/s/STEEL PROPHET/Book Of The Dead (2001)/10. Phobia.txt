Ever flowing streams of stubborn morals created to seal the gate
Mankind's biological timebomb, a must see comedy
Limits we place inside slows evolution to a crawl
The beast inside scratches and claws to be free

A cage of solid steel
A lock without a key
Weakened minds wither to dust
Strong words from blistered mouths

Parasites of myths and lies will eat your mind away
The multidimensional universe is gone forevermore
Scavenges your mind for unique patterns you can't conceal
The door to evolution is sealed eternally
