What was the world for me as a child
Full of innocence not yet wild
I thought people
All were good
The world was ordered it was understood
They put ideas in my head

Fairy tales were what they said
Soon I learned you all had hearts of black you beat
And robbed and raped me laughed behind my back
I thought the world mad I hated life
Itself I cursed the god they made and then shoved down my throat
I rebelled to them
All I'd make them pay before they fall

Death of innocence my values died
No reference cut off from my soul
The loss of heart leaves a blackened hole

Now I think I'm on a path searching for enlightenment
I sometimes feel I grasp the thread of eternity within my head
Feeds me power from the earth feel the logic my spirit rebirth
