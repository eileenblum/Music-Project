Misty spirit of ether come into me
Join me as one
Weave us together with many branches

The seed must grow dormant
In a cold earth we wait for spring
One tear shed for love will grow the heart again

And loneliness will pass
As the shadows of angels that linger nearby
Imparting strength the drought leaves us
Stricken on the cracked dry earth

It's a passage of time
We cry for the dead
And pray for joys return
We bow to the grace of who gives life and light

As I gaze into those soft loving eyes
I return to love and warm tenderness
You engulfed me with sweet kisses
Of misty lips drawn unto me
You could not leave
Your heart had bound me and I
Possessed your soul in eternity

We are locked in the embrace
The feelings frozen in time
As light is captured in a photograph
Of us as young lovers
