Science seeks to ascend to god's throne by playing their trade
Creating life on their own
As consciousness' state's forever at hand
They're doomed to wander a no mans land

They seek to become master alone
The key they reveal will only be soul
Smash all your atoms and still you will find
You can't instill life of a real kind

Your failure inscribed in stone
And when you wander through your experiments
You'll see a piece alludes your memory

This puzzle of life creates the stern brow
So active and coaxing the here and the now

Through the dream I saw my own fate on my stone
I could read the date I saw the beginning of life
And learned the secret made in my life
