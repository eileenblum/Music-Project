Rising back from the depths insane are the cries
from his past running away from the truth the anguish
he flees closes fast searching the evil unleashed
from rage that his torment amassed relentless his quest
for revenge from his grave deaths sentence is passed the ghosts
of a time weep for vengeance long dead still the dreams
haven't ceased how law could preside such injustice now
the ravenant's wrath is released stolen before it was time
all the dreams that he worked to create ravaged so mercilessly
he seeks atonement for ill gotten fate striking a bargain
with hell so the crime done to him is repaid striken the
slayers eternal roaming life in the guise of a shade the
price his soul lost forever so the curse of undead can be placed
with the revenant's wrath placed upon them he can rest for he's
suffrage's erased
