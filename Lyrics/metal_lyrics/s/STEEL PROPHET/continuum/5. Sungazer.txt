Sungazer look to the sky 
Seeking truth will you ever learn why 
Your vision's lost from the light of the sun 
As you bask in the hellish light of the sun 

Sings praises to his star of doom 
The light that cast him to his darkened tomb 
What was the path of that light he seeks 
A flaming sphere that brought him to his knees 

Sungazer ride though the planes of your mind 
Seeking truth even though you are blind 
Was your truth the one that was real 
Or is illusion the force you feel 

Sungazer - You live your life out for the sun 
Sungazer - You've Feelings of love for no one 
Sungazer - Forsees and predicts his own doom 
Sungazer - Your place is by the moon 

Sungazer look to me eyes 
The planest turn, do you feel all the lies 
Is the flesh one with the soul 
Are both forces one in control 

You feel the warmth but cannot see the light 
Set for good but you know not wrong from right 
Your weary journey treads the narrow path 
Your site is gone, so sad it doesn't last 

Sungazer feel the sun's force 
You've looked too long opon its source 
Cry your tears but you shouldn't weep 
Locked in the land of eternal sleep 

Sungazer - You live your life out for the sun 
Sungazer - You've Feelings of love for no one 
Sungazer - Forsees and predicts his own doom 
Sungazer - Your place is by the moon 

Sungazer [x3]
