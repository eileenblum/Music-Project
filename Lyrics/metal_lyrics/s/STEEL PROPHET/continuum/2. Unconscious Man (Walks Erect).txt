Preying on scared rabbit glared in the eyes 
Twisted shreds of fabric, cold glare when it's done 
sometimes I think I'm the same, but I'm not 
If they had their way you'd be just drops of fluid 

But who are they to judge you the unconscious masses 
You will enter voids of penultimate storms 
Talons of energy remake a new form 
Nothing is remembered on the surface you've escaped
but paid 

Father beats and rapes you in innocence 
Hands and knees face down the taste you spit 
The taste you spit, don't become again 
One more try to walk erect, the candle flickers 
The storm pursues, the wax burns your face 
triumph atop a wave that descends 
a steadily rising curve we've all won
