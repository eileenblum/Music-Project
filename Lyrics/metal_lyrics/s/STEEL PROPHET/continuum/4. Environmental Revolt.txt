We the people of this decimated planet called earth 
For twenty years have reaped only still birth 
My veins reflecting earth's rivers 
Filled with poison life they cannot support 

People of all races on this planet know economic crash
will mean so much woe 
Corporations in states of denial scream "our system's
good pollution is not what it seems" 
But like all revolution before the throng of justice
will break down the door 
People pleading reform are just the calm before the
storm 

[Chorus]

Stand up for life of the future 
Destroy the way that's ruined us 
Bring environmental killers to trial 
End their reign with a smile 

Inventions coming onto the scene 
Their effects on health remain to be seen 
But once profit begins to flow 
Corporate vultures seize the control 

Once jobs and livelihood is on the line 
They rope you into their clutches like swine 
Revolutions gone down the drain 
Work for them you're just a pawn in their game 

Then they tell you cut back conserve 
Our way can live if our rules you observe 
But you know the whole system's decayed 
To the corporate god our leaders have prayed 

[Chorus]

So you wonder what to do 
Their elections offer no one to you 
You arm yourself to destroy them 
The thought of bloodshed leaves doubt 

[Chorus]

They endorse the death penalty but abortion is a crime

Drugs that make you happy are not to be used 
But it's okay for profit to put poison in our food 
A system for the futures death our governments the
crime
