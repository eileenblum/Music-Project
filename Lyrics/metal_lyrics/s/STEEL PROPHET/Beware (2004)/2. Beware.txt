I hear a voice in my head
He is calling my name
He looks for believers with souls
That want to be free
Giving His life for thee

Can't you see he is the light
His name is a mystery beware!

The ending of life!
It shows you the ways
Afraid of the clouds and the tears
And the sky's turning red
Giving His life for thee

Can't you see he is the dark
His life is yours to keep
In his world there is no time
There are only wonderful beings
But beware!

It's a mystery, it's a mystery

Mystery, I gave you all my being
Mystery, how can I show you the way
Mystery, there is only one
Only for you to be
