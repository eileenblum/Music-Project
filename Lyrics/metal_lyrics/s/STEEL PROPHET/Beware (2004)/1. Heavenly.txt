All together in a sea of madness
We show you what's real
Prowling together searching for someone new
We are truly pure steel

So hang on to your minds
We are here to make you slam
Enforcing is up to you
Get ready go! Get on your own way

All the others tried to satisfy your thirst
Keep turning your wheels
Here and forever we promise to make you burn
The money the thrills

Go hang on to your minds
We are here to make you slam
Enforcing is up to you
Get ready go! Get on your own way

It is time, time is heavenly
Running the world, souls keep running free

Maybe next time you will listen to my words
Steel Prophet is here
It is the pact that we have
To the ends of the earth
Pure metal real steel

Go hang on to your minds
We are here to make you slam
Enforcing is up to you
Get ready get on your own way

It is time, time is heavenly
Running the world, souls keep running free

We got no time running free
The end of time, it's all right here
