Phantoms with wings in hysteria
They're looking to find
Some new children to rule
So don't be so shallow
Don't put up a fight
Letting evil inside you

How could you say
That you saw the face
When you knew He came alive
How could you say
That you had no faith
We follow the king

Lord I miss the time
With chains and leatherette
Show me the chamber
That filled with lust and pain
The kingdom of the undead

It is the right of the human
To believe in a life of eternity
Phantasmagoria has all of the choices
To live on the earth or beneath

How could you say

[Chorus]

Look out you better watch out,
I said look out, you better watch out look out

How could you say

[Chorus]

Lord I miss the time
With chains and leatherette
Show me the chamber
That filled with lust and pain
It's only pain
