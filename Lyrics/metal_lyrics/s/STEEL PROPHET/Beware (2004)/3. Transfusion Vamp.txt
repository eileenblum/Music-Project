I am the coroner yes I am
I am here to take your life
Taking all so you can give it here
You're running out of time

They call me the transfusion vamp
Oh yeah! Yes I am
I'm coming to take your soul away
Now that I know your name, your mind

Introduce me to your friends
So we can have some fun
Calling all the looser freaks
Dead walking in the dark

They call me the transfusion vamp
Oh yeah! Yes I am
I'm coming to take your soul away
They call me the transfusion vamp
Oh yeah! Yes I am
I'm coming to take your soul away
Now that I know your name

Do you feel the burning heat
Inside your bones and flesh
Follow me to that special place
That takes the pain away

They call me the transfusion vamp
Oh yeah! Yes I am
I'm coming to take your soul away
They call me the transfusion vamp
Oh yeah! Yes I am
I'm coming to take your soul away
Now that I know your name
