I see bright lights in my head
Dream that I am falling down
All my past insanity
Is breaking all around

Seems to me time is running out
Lost on the road how to get back
I've lost my way

Age progression fills my head
It's images of you
We tried to make a life together
But you were not true

Seems to me time is running out
Lost on the road I feel the pain
I gave you all I had
Tell me why you looked the other way

Mistress of insanity
Shackle me to you
Remember all the pain
We shared together
It felt so good

Seems to me time is running out
Lost on the road how to get back
I've lost my way, I gave you all I had
Tell me why you looked the other way

Come on my queen don't let me be, no no no
I've tumbled and fallen without a dream
I feel the shame such lonely pain forever
Keep taking my blood I'm fading away

Lost my way, oh want you stay

Come on my queen don't let me be, no no no
Lost on the road oh can't you see
I feel the pain, such lovely pain forever
Keep taking my blood I'm fading my way
