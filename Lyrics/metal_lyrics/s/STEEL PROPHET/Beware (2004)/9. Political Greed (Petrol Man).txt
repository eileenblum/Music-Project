See the children in this fucking war
They've got the money, political deeds
Giving life for a barrel of gas
Becoming victims of corporate greed

I see images of other lives
Screaming dying it's all right here
We all know the world is to blame
No pointing fingers at the USA!
No! We all need patrol man

I was looking at the TV news
And saw the picture of one of my friends
He was bleeding on the ground
Fully surrounded engulfed in flames

I see images of other lives
Screaming dying it's all right here
We all know the world is to blame
No pointing fingers at the USA!

[Chorus]

To hell to political,
To hell to political greed
To hell to political,
To hell to political greed

So when you are driving in your brand new car
Remember the petro that you got the way
To all victims of this dirty war
We thank you all we thank the men

I see the images of other lives
Screaming dying it's all right here
We all know the world is to blame
No pointing fingers at the USA!
