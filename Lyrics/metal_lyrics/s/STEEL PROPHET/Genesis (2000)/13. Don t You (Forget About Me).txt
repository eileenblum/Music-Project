[Simple Minds Cover]

Hey...ooh...
Won't you come see about me
I'll be alone dancing

You know it, baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Givin' evrything inside and out on
Love's strange, so willing in the dark
Think of the tender things
That we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light get in your heart

Baby, don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't you forget about me

I knew you spent above me
Look my way never love me
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down, down...
I knew you recognize me
Call my name or walk on by
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down, down...
Hey...ooh...

Don't you try and peep in
It's my feelings. well, when in the end
I won't harm you or touch your defenses
Valuable insecurity, ah...
Don't you forget about me
I'll be alone dancing,
You know what baby,
Don't you, I take you apart
I'll put it back together at heart

Don't you forget about me
Don't , don't, don't you forget about me
As you walk on by
Will you call my name
As you walk on by
Will you call my name
When you walk away

Oh...when you walk away
Will you walk away
Will you call my name
Will you call my name
