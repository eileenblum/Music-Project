Sometime, when I look up at the sky
The night sky, night sky so vast
I wish, I wish upon a star
Your star, it burns so bright to me

Oh earth and sky, I wish upon your star
Your star's still there
You've gone away, it seems eternally
Your star's still there
It burns inside of me

Long ago, you broke the chains
You travelled on, you sailed the stars
I was left behind
The tears they burned in me
I long to be joined again

My time here, seems like empty years
Waiting to see you again
I believe, oh I do believe
Our circle will start again

[Solo: SK]
