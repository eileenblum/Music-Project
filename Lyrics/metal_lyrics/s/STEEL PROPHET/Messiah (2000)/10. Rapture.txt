Here is wisdom and forgiveness, repent yours sins and be of witness
Retribution into madness, tribulation's years of sadness
Inquisition against christians, eminent is their persecution
Unholy ruler, man of sin, shall force us all to worship him

His globalist plans for a one world government and its assault on our privacy
Personal freedom will soon disappear, under surveillance we all live in fear
Bio chip implants in the wrist or the head, resist his orders, you'll end up dead
Spiritual warfare now has begun, with the light of his coming the battle is won

Holy spirit move in me, sanctify us eternally
Help me father understand, to keep the laws that you command
Now the last days are at hand, then you'll judge the souls of man
Many wonders deceive our eyes, as he blasphemes with splendid lies

Final choices, final destiny, in the valley of decision awaits humanity
So many lies and nothing to believe, tear down the veils, we have been deceived
Eternal life in prison, imagine if you can, no bars or guards to save you
From the torments you'll withstand, you think that evil's in your control
You cant deny that the beast possesses your soul

[Solo: JP]

In the final hour call upon his power, don't hesitate, you might be late
You'll be left behind with the flock of the blind, life is too short to die in your sin
The earth is hell bound, so let Jesus in

Watch therefore, for you do not know
What hour your lord is coming
[Matthew 24:42]
