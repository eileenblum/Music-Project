[Solo: JP]

Since the early dawn of man
Up through the corridors of time
We have searched deep in our souls
Into the caverns of our minds
An empty space inside
A void within our hearts
Difference in cultures
That set the world apart

[Chorus]

A need to return our energy
Towards all nature in harmony

As we evolved our spirits grew
Gave names to gods
We channeled through
Into the earth we planted seeds
Providing food for our daily needs
In the fields men hunted beasts
They honored Pan with mighty feasts
Winter fell their skin gave warmth
Gathered all resources upon the earth
The whispers on the wind
Or the setting of the sun
The lunar stages of the moon
Its gravity pulls us on

[Repeat Chorus]

[Solo: JP]
