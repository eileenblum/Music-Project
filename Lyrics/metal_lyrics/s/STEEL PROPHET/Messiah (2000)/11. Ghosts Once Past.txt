"The first will visit you when the clock strikes one"
"Heed them well, they are your only chance"

He knew it was strange, that December eve
Was it the drugs? His senses took leave

Brought out by the ghost of past, I was but a boy here
My heart was locked up here, my ruin was made this way!

His greed shown in detail, his love drove away, hard as steel was his way

The three ghosts, taught that night, a lesson harder than steel
If these be but shadows of what can be real
I choose to change my ways, a better soul I'll become
The spell was broken by a kiss of light forever changed in his heart
