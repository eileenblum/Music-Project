Why are we breeding destroyers of life
Where have we gone so far wrong?
Nature or nurture sparks the debate
It's gone on and on so long
In our minds we search for the cause
But when we reach our own brains we pause
I ignore my aggression
I can't seem to see
That driver is in you and me

Hid from the light
Blinded from sight
The pressure is built up inside
Hid from the light
Mind knows only night
Atom by atom they're formed

I almost lost my way there
It would have been easy to snap
They always said don't hold it in
Don't bottle your feelings inside

[Repeat Chorus]

[Solos: JP, SK, JP]
