I have a secret hidden behind the wall
Like a junky with needle and spoon
It lies in wait for me
At the fire yesterday
I glanced by mistake and real a line
The line said "I am born"
Dickens an author penned the line

[Chorus]
I have read
Broken the law
I have learned
I have saw

When the sleep was swept from my eyes 
I the fool was seen
A wife devoid of thoughts and feelings 
an empty waking dream
A life spent destroying thoughts 
preserved in revered tomes
Hopes and dreams, poetry, feelings 
that make life real
