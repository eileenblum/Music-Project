Beware psychic welfare
Upon the mind of innocent men
Parasites from beyond our world
Have infested invisibly

Growing fear inside me erupts
Of unknown which comes from above
Abductions of many who claim
To be victims of strange rituals

Celestial visitors returning
Since ancient times
To gather specimens for their research
Belief their is life other than us

In a universe enormously vast
Technology is growing so much
Keeps the human race in touch

[Chorus]
We are not alone in this universe so vast
Intelligent life other than us 
is surely in our grasp
We can only hope that time will soon reveal
Contact from another world
Will prove that this is real
