Look what you've done 
there's no where to run
Your bridges are burned 
you should have learned
Now you are rushing with fear
is the end near!
Helpless feelings building inside
As emptiness takes you for a ride
So go on, feed your arms
Stabbing at your veins to kill the pain

Look what you've done, are you having fun!
Life of misery is what you've become
Your words they lack the truth
Your life is living proof 
how high can you keep your flight
Is there no end in sight!

Why do you keep doing this
Is pain raised to bliss
Don't you care what you are doing
Your future life to keep screwing
Into the grave both feet in hell
Sad emotions is where you dwell
Addicting pain is all to real
The damage done your fate is sealed

Look at your arms, tracks mark the way
You stabbed yourself each and every day
Look what you've done
Are you having fun
Life of misery, in death you're gone
