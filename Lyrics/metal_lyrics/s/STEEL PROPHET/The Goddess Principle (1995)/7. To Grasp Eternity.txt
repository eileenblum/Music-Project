We seek for ways to connect 
To a higher supreme source 
Those that hunger for knowledge 
Set their spiritual course 
Just as a mirror points at another 
Reflects an unending world 
Aeturn divided makes waves of light 
That spark and create all life 
The never ending questions 
Answers beyond our comprehension 
That lead mankind to ponder through 
The mystery of it's dimension 
Time is a circle that measures decay 
And points out change is at our hands 
Can anything happen would seem to be true 
As miracles sometimes do 
Waiting for the Chakras to open our psychic doors 
Of seven vital centers dormant deep within 
The Kundalini will awaken and rise to 
Enlighten us as we manifest through polarity 
Escape this flesh reality, joining from the beginning 
To grasp eternity...eternally 
A soul is eternal, a fragment of the divine 
As a circle turns on comprehend forever more 
Do as thou will as long as it harms no one 
Question all that you believe and know yourself 
Inside and out 
This concept is god! 
Molecules are as one 
All souls are as one, as psychic forces show 
Your pain is mine, I wouldn't have it this way 
So do unto others, our souls are as one! 
Your pain is mine 
I wouldn't have it this way 
So do unto others, our souls 
Are as one
