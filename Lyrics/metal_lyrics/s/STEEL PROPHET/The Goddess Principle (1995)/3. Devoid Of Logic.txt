I know your not evil or wicked 
And yet we let this evil breed 
The flesh that dressed our table took 
From a beast that feels pain like you or me 
We enslaved people of different races 
Until we knew it was wrong 
Now we raise and kill entire species 
Inhumane if dog or cat 
You say they're weak of mind, exploit them as 
We please, the retarded weak of mind shall 
We dispose of too? 
Starving people need the grain, 
That's fed to the herds as they die in vain 
The main user of the water we need, more 
Than half by the butchers of beasts 
25 gallons make a pound of wheat 
25 hundred for a pound of flesh 
Thousands are left dead on the plains 
Our cattle get fat out ways are insane 
Who are we to decide which species may 
Live or die 
Who we breed to serve flesh lust 
Betray their lives and call it just 
We are not above them all, as we believe 
Since Satan's fall 
Experiments to dastardly, poison beasts and make 
Them bleed 
Hitler was a holy Jew, compared to what science 
does today 
If you think them to be right, torture your 
Pet and drain it's life 
Slaughtering life brings high rewards to he who 
Slays, but the blood's on our hands 
Illogic twists it's way as we seek to find 
That we are not wrong 
When a thing suffers needlessly, a rage wells up 
Inside of me 
Who gives you the selfish right, to treat the 
World as you please? 
We are all not here for you to abuse us
