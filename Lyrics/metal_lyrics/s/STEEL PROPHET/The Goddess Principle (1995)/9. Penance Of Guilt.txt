Forgive them father for they have sinned 
Again and again 
Pretending they know not what they do 
When you know they'll sin again 
Many people going down for the ride 
On pedestals of fame in filth they hide 
Use many words that cut like a knife 
Stabbing the heart and draining the life 
Lied and cheated on your spouse 
Swore you never did 
Your evil stays within you soul 
From guilt you can't be hid 
You and all you money, no charity 
For the poor 
Laughing at the crippled, you mock 
And clam the door 
No respect for women, they're just 
A piece of meat 
You steal a bloody profit on things 
That should be free 
Your capitalistic tendencies rot 
Your soul within 
The starving feast upon your blood 
You disregard your sin 
Remorse you will feel 
And you must live with yourself 
Repent your sins 
In guilt you live your final days 
In death free your soul 
Preacher got busted and now he's not preaching 
He is a hypocrite in prison who's weeping 
In a lonely abyss of self pity and sorrow 
Secret sins linger beyond our tomorrows 
Seduced by temptation you taste the forbidden 
Indulge in disguise to keep that side hidden 
Now you are dying in disease you are stricken 
Depression succumbs you near suicide you're 
Christened 
If you could only turn back time 
Re-live your life and erase your crime 
All the pain you've caused others before 
To achieve your selfish gain 
Now your soul is blackened 
And your eyes are deranged 
Your fate is sealed nothing can save you now 
Your try to avoid the truth think you'll escape 
Somehow 
Father please forgive me for life-long sins I've built 
To avoid the fires of hell, eternal penance be my guilt 
Sadistic Aryan fascist 
Your mind is closed with hate 
Burn in hell with your white supremacy 
A bigot will seal their fate 
Hunters of nature's creatures 
That wear their fur with pride 
You'll reincarnate as an animal 
Hunted and skinned alive 
Then upon your death bed 
You'll confess your darkest of sin 
A preacher recites your last rites 
And your stairway descends! 
No! No! No! No! Nooo! Lie! Lie! Lie!
