Visions flash across your T.V. screen 
Synchronized within society 
Scenes of hatred and bigotry 
Engulfed in bloodshed and agony 
Distraught emotions of a weakened mind 
Initiates violence through the media's eye 
Hell only knows what possessed them to strike 
Contorted reality rules their life 
They long to be heros in a fictitious world they've created 
Their wrath unfurls 
Seek victims of an innocent nature 
A tragic story of a child in danger 
Seeking attention in misery evil thrives 
Through a killers eyes 
Death takes it's course through genocide 
Then they take their own life 
The consequences lies not behind 
For now the gates of hell they soon will find 
Their acts of malice are dramatized 
The media renders us mesmerized 
Signs of the time they lead us to believe 
We are damned for which we do not understand 
All justice is behind a system of confusion 
Crime corruption, disease is omnipotent 
Demand for blood and violent entertainment 
We're lost in a void of hopelessness forsaken 
I view the world and I'm not surprised what I see 
As Armageddon unfolds on T.V. 
Confined to flesh in this world of pestilence 
Forever unrest the media has their audience 
Blindly we fade into oblivion 
Enter the new age of babylon
