From the sun out of the east 
A Brilliant light arose 
A thorny crown upon his head 
Cut from a branch of rose 
Through blazing eyes I saw within 
A peace I'd never known 
An aura of color from his head 
A magi of great renown 
Turbulence and war begins 
Death and torture in his name 
Decadence and deceit and lies 
Abjured by him the same 
Trials inquisitions of witches 
Dogmas blighted scars 
But if they could only see within 
The consciousness of the stars 
The trunks of trees he carried 
Up tp this place the skull 
With vehemence and hatred 
The spikes were driven through 
Blackened skis cracked with storm 
Through fears and mocking laughs 
With his death and ascendance 
The reign of Christ begins 
It is written god so loved the earth 
He sent his only begotten son 
To die for mans sins upon the cross 
Repent unto him or be eternally lost 
Damned are the souls enduring tribulation 
History will turn the final page 
The priest and scribes pervert 
The ancient teachings 
In the name of Christ they preach 
In blasphemy 
Soon the seven seals be broken 
And the prophecy come to pass 
And the angels of death and darkness 
Fall to the earth upon which they're cast 
Man will fornicate and worship idols 
The queen of harlots will ride the beast 
The gates of hell will open tribulation 
And the second coming of the reign of Christ
