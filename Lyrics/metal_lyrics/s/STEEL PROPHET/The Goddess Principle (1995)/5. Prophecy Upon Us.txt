Vigilante warrior champion 
Battles of unseen forces that dwell among 
The earth 
Mystic seer of wisdom in solitary trance 
Through divination foresees our future 
In ancient tongue he chants 
Vision of sorrow unfolding 
An apocalypse closing in 
Pestilence devours the realm of flesh 
Humanity engulfed in sin 
Beyond the gates of wisdom 
Received by the chosen few 
Embrace the chalice of knowledge 
Awaken the awful truth 
The wrath of the beast upon us 
In the depths of our soul we feel 
Instinctively within our hearts 
A prophecy engraved in steel 
Lead us not into temptation 
Deceive us not into desolation 
Unleashed hatred in our atmosphere 
Upheaval of war Armageddon is near 
Experiencing changes we can't understand 
We hold onto faith while we still can 
The earth is quaking 
Our cities are breaking 
Disaster will claim many lives 
Murder and scandal 
A burning black candle 
Controlling the spirit of man 
The earth now exists in a deadly abyss 
Darkness has swallowed the light 
Many addicted, seduced by the wicked 
Join the flock of the damned 
Salvation from sorrow 
Deceived they will follow 
Eternally in hell! 
Now is a time to decide 
To search our hearts and to realize 
Our existence is not all in vain 
There's a meaning to life it's not just a game 
We were left behind, now we're caught in the middle 
The future hangs in the balance like a riddle 
So we live our lives for material lust 
Awaiting judgment prophecy upon us
