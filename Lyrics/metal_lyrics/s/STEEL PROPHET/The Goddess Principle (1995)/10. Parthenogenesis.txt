Begotten from an elder age 
History had turned the page 
Were they real I don't know 
Change reveals itself so slow 
They flourished in their temperate 
Crime beyond the boundaries of all time 
Their lives memories hadn't been kept 
Eons past them as darkness crept 
Changes came into their lives 
The strangest feeling they'd never known 
They came to fear their end was near 
What lay around the bend for them 
Virgin birth that they once known 
Began to cease the seeds once sewn 
Antibiosins sprayed their seed to fatal 
Infertility 
Legacy that fathomed time 
Fell prey to our temporal climb 
Sacred Womb Contaminated 
Each Embryonic Cell Mutated 
Atrophy- sins of flesh 
Wickedness- engulfed by darkness 
So it seems the end of their race 
Their organs can not be replaced 
Evolution changes slowly 
Now it's time for them to die 
Atrophy- sins of flesh 
Wickedness- engulfed by darkness 
Degeneration taking place 
They feast on gore 
Their drives misplaced 
Atmosphere of poison gas 
Their lives will not last 
Their virgin birth is now abstained 
To never live again 
Parthenogenesis is stained 
With birth must follow death
