Feel the rush as it tingles, tantalizing my spine 
How many more times can my nerve endings explode 
Jonesing again for that one last dose 
Shove it in my veins until I'm comatose 
[Chorus]
When I'm gone I can't do anything 
The beating of my heart consumes everything 
Finding a cure for this never ending quest 
I battle with the demon, he cheats me with his test 
I have played the fool stuck pins into my eyes 
My rage of hate attacked me haunts my soul and dies 
[Chorus - repeat]
Why does it control everything in me 
When I'm in control I know wrong from right 
But when it's in my blood i can't put up a fight 
Feeling weak and powerless I begin to cry 
How could I betray myself to my loved ones 
cheat &amp; lie 
[Speed chorus]
I kneel before the god that stole my life 
I am still alive in here but don't know how to die 
Emptiness and tortured awash in misery 
My body craves another fix I just wish to die 
All the things I've lost and ruined repentance can't buy 
When I'm stretched out on a slab no rush forever more 
[Speed chorus - repeat]
As my mind breaks/sweats and my body aches/ 
Pushed up are the stakes/ -- / 
Will I live to see/my mind cleared of slavery/ 
My weakness cured by bravery/ -- / 
[Verse I - repeat]
[Chorus - repeat]
[Verse II - repeat]
