Dawning is now a predicted age 
We're overpopulated rats in a cage 
Slowly our freedom begins to erode 
Governmental hypocrisy is bestowed 
It is often said art imitates life 
It seems now we're denied that right 
Only confined to what they want us to see 
They mold our minds to how they want us to be 
Limited creations a fragment of the whole 
Stifled expressions the truth untold 
Freedom of religion, freedom of speech 
So it is written, so practice what you preach 
Contradicting our beginning they disregard the law 
Exploiting all the violence as people watch in awe 
Preference of eroticism 
For individual taste 
If you don't like what you see 
Then get the hell out of their space 
Declaring art obscenity they exclude you from their race 
Slander you in the media they label you disgraced 
Indifferences in all of us and intercrossing paths 
Segregated by bigotry evolutions final wrath 
[chorus]
Do you believe we're really free 
If we can't reflect the world we see 
Reality only black and white 
Does freedom lie between wrong and right 
Who decides what laws will change 
Will liberty and justice still remain 
If this is what the future shows 
We'll all be slaves of mind control 
Has America begun to weaken 
Or revolution began to awaken 
How can you blame us for being defiant 
When our inner voice is silenced 
[repeat chorus]
I don't know what this transposes in reverse 
And if an evil word appears it's not intentional 
Record our political leaders 
And study their subliminal hates 
Censor my words, censor their schemes 
They drove me to suicide 
(society shall sue them) 
The media brainwashed me to love pursuit of things 
And not to trust my inner voice so absurd they still defiled 
Themselves and us by calling it the land of the 
Free and the home of the brave
