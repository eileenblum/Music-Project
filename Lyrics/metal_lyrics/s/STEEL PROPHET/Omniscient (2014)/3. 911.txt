A circle of tyrants devised a scheme
Lofty plans of conquest
Building the Empire of Dreams
Generals gather like witches
Plotting in secrecy
Diabolical plans in their project
for the new American century
Create a crisis
Cause upheaval in the world
The blame the Muslims
A self-inflicted wound
To serve as pretext for war
Perpetual conflict
Theatre wars without end
For Oil, Opium, and the dying dollar

The ultimate of false flags
Mother of conspiracy
Monumental is this lie
Imploding all our liberties
Compliant is the media
Perpetuating fear and lies
Osama Bin Laden, Al-Qaida network
wants Americans to die!
Catalyzing like a new Pearl Harbor
How the Neocons rejoiced
A chance to capture the Caspian Sea
Leaving many dead in their wake
Shock and awe, dropping bombs
Delivering democracy
9/11 on that fateful day forever in infamy

Blood Sacrifice, En Masse
unto the all seeing eye
Their great work is almost done
Three thousand lost for this lie
On that day the world had changed
the gates of hell were opened wide

Opportunity to seize the day
consolidate he world into one
Oppress with tyranny
AmeriKKKa invokes the law
Microchip humanity, tagging cattle
herding sheep
Unfolding is prophecy
the world marvels at the beast

Compliant is the media
Perpetuating fear and lies
Osama Bin Laden, Al-Qaida network
wants Americans to die!
