My whammy bar broke
Last night
I put in the springs
Too tight
I didn't know how to sing
Actual music tones
But I growled my way
to metalness
Intensity

It's my thing
My double bass pedal
Snapped so I got
No swing
My wristband
My denim vest in threadbare
My broken pinky means
My metal horns
Look like I just don't care

666 not 665 or 667
Is everywhere in my metal
ballad blues
666-666-666-666

Ma says
My long hair uniform
Is a cartoon caricature
Like Uncle Dan's boots
And hat
Makes that
Country dude tat
Baggy pants and backward cap
Make a man a legend of rap

My phrygian miner progression
Slayered me
With white powdery anthrax
And the ballad of lieutenant
Marshall stack
Keeled over
In the garage

Asphyxiated
Apparently by the smoke
Of the2 joint
The drum solo
Or the 2 joints
After the drum solo
Or the 2 joints before
The two-hand-tap solo
Erupting from my speakers
As I bang my head
Standing in my leather
Studded sneakers
