There once was a man
Who lived in light
His mind was frozen
But it's all right
It's hard to explain
This mystery in rhyme
One dat he was as
All of us are
But slowly and sure
Ghosts fled from his mind
The light was his food
And water his blood

Light is my way
Escalate
Elevate
Winding
Path

Once it began
It couldn't slow down
Skin was as bark
Muscle atrophy
Roots they became
Leaves were as hair
Movement no more
Joyous and free had finally arrived

Light is my way
Escalate
Elevate
Winding
Path
