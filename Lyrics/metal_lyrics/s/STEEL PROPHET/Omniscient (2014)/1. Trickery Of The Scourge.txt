Once we could see it was all certain
They came to us by night
Somehow disease has spread the scroll
Why do we believe prophecy?
The humans became the pests
The scourge that threatened all life
The earth in her ways devised trickery
Interprets what must be a sign

Leave and you'll save us
Whom lives on will thank us
The prophecy needs us to fade
Lies!
Truth!
Lies!
Truth!

When germs are the species endangered
And insects hold keys to our fate
Plant's lives we've yet to see
The crowds have become as a cancer
The city has paved over life
The glow of technology blinds us
We're pestilence to air, land and sea

Leave and you'll save us
Whom lives on will thank us
The prophecy needs us to fade
Lies!
Truth!
Lies!
Truth!

I see twilight ahead
A fog rises up from the sea
A balance is held in a hand
A veil through which no man may see

Why should I go?
Who tells me so?
What will I see?
Is it just one of her tricks?
Why am I born?
Who gives a care?
Why must I die?
Tell me it's not all in vain?
