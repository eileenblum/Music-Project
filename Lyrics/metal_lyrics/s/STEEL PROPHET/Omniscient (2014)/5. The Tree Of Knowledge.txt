If I were not of the tree of knowledge
But if the tree of life
I imagine
I would be in the moment

Disappear mind is
Clear
When knowledge is
Unattained
The soul unchained
Mind  rearranged
When eaten from
The tree of life

As animals are
And only have instincts
Small communications that might
Be the best thing with no history
To build on
There would be no insidious weapons
Or perversions
Built on past
Remembered lunacies

Disappear mind is
Clear
When knowledge is
Unattained
The soul unchained
Mind  rearranged
When eaten from
The tree of life

But being of the knowledge tree
I must push my species forward
And become
The being that uses
Intellect and imagination
To improve my species
As a whole
Take away want and need
And make love and kinship
Universal and real not just ideal
