Is the world so flawed
You and me too?
What can I do?
What will I do
'til the end?
Bitter end?
Don't accept something
That should be better
Although the say
You're playing god
Or the devil
If right and wrong
Are too clear
Where's the grey?

I could change it
Or remake it
This one or another one
They say everyone has a dream
Why not make it
An 'impossible' one?
May I point out
A key flaw an
Omniscient, wise, caring god?
Made a world
Where the crowning glory
Is things that prey
On each other

In the name of infinity
I
A small humble man
Would make
All creatures as planets
Or plants
Able tu sustain
And create sustenance from
The great solar engine
With no need to think
But still know of oneself
And outside
The problems may vanish
As ghosts
In the night

I could change it
Or remake it
This one or another one
They say everyone has a dream
Why not make it
An 'impossible' one?
May I point out
A key flaw an
Omniscient, wise, caring god?
Made a world
Where the crowning glory
Is things that prey
On each other

The ill will to devour
The humble
In the back stab
Power grab
Made some doubt
The holy father's
Caring for us

I could change it
Or remake it
This one or another one
They say everyone has a dream
Why not make it
An 'impossible' one?

But fallibility, possibility
Failed this world
They preyed he learned
From his mistakes
And created better worlds
We've never seen
But he has
And I hope to travel there
In dreams or death
Afterlife
Attained?
Ha ha ha
