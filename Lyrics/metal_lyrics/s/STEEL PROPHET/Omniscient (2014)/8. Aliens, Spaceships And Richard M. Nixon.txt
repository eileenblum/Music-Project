I thought I saw a UFO one night
But I may have been mistaken
Conspiracy is hard to prove
Even when it's everywhere
And you're the forsaken

Where is that spaceship
That picks up Nixon
And takes him to Watergate
To relive his folly
And change history?

I'd like to watch
Richard sweat
But not believing he was wrong
Makes me see
A bit of myself
And compassion
Or is it hate
Of that part of myself?

But I can't remember
If the UFO was real
Or what my dream
Sought to reveal
In 1974, with aliens
Spaceships
And Richard M. Nixon
When the Milhouse
Burnt down that day
Some crop circle theorist suspected
The aliens
I never did see
But the UFO
I did see that night
May have been that ship
Carrying Richard M. Nixon
They laughed at me that day
But I think I saw Nixon holed up
In the alien cargo bay
In '74, lying on the floor
Putting pieces
In my puzzle
Of Richard M. Nixon
