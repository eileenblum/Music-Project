Appearing in the skies above
So frequent like never before
Light ship crafts abound en masse
Will disclosure see the light of day?
Ancient astronaut theories make light
And understanding of where we are right now
Our modern world of mediocrity
In the religion of technology
Struggle for dominance and power supreme
Engulf the planet in war and pain

Are they our saviors?
Or Ancient Gods of our past?
Have they come to invade?
Or are they here hiding behind a mask?
So many answers that those
in power must know
Hoarding this knowledge from us
to remain in control

Inner ascendance awaking
to higher consciousness
Imminent shift is upon us all
aware or unaware
Battle for Earth unseen forces abound
Armageddon is so very near
who will fight to save us from ourselves?
Before we destroy the earth

Are they our saviors?
Or Ancient Gods of our past?
Have they come to invade?
Or are they here hiding behind a mask?
So many answers that those
in power must know
Hoarding this knowledge from us
to remain in control

Eyes now open from our sleep
True lies false truths be revealed
The hidden now seen are exposed
Before the dawn three days of night
