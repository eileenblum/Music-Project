Sitting here in fear
That can't show
With you all watching
Little beads of sweat
Popping on
My face
7 million miles in space

And I see the stars
like no one ever saw
The stars
when will it be over
And return
I'll be oh so good
if I can just return
To you

With only my thoughts
That always seem to turn
Back to the fear
And claustrophobia
That linger like boogeymen
Under my bed

Soaring thru
Time
Wading through space
I don't want to
Run this race
Where does it
All lead
From this craft
Freed
It takes a lot of trust
To be trapped
In a single room
For 3 months
Or a year
Time to face
My fear
But hiding from it
Is another way to play it
And keep you near
In my thoughts
Are a puzzle
With a piece
I can't seem to find
Hope or faith
I've left behind
In shadows that eclipse
the bright thoughts
Of you
And your smile
We trust
The smile
Even the ones forced from fear
That always returns when
you're a man
In a space craft
And in the closet
I can't dare to look in
Sea diver try to escape
This iron cage
