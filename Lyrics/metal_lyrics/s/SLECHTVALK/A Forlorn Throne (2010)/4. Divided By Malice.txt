[lyrics: Shamgar, music: Shamgar &amp; Slechtvalk]

I lie in this darkness with tears in my eyes,
I weep in silence, but in my heart I scream.
The path that I must take, it breaks my heart,
I fear I'll never see my love again.

I saw the hunger in his eyes as he dragged her away,
The beast that had betrayed me. Oh how I hate him.
Seconds lasted for ages. Did I just hear her scream?
He'll know the meaning of pain when I am done with him.

Torn by grief, I was left for dead
And for a moment I was.

I followed their steps through the wilderness
Determined to take back what is mine.
I wandered the earth driven by grief
Until I finally tracked them down.

I was shocked when I saw a glimpse of her bruised face;
All the love she had for me, he had beaten it out.

I could feel the fire of vengeance burn in my heart.
When I saw her lips kissing his, I could not restrain myself .

I only saw the fear in his eyes as I tightened my grip.
He thought he had killed me, but now I stood before him.
I drew my blade to cut this bastard down,
But my arm was held back by a familiar hand.

Instead of killing him, I cut off his thumbs,
No longer will he wield the sword against my sons.
I would have killed him if she didn't believe his lies,
But he will live down in shame âtil the day he dies.

And now I had my first vengeance
I must hold of the storm,
Before I find myself a way
To win back her love for me.
