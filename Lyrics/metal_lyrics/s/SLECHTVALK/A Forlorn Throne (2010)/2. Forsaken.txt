[lyrics: Shamgar, music: Seraph, Shamgar &amp; Slechtvalk]

My mind is filled with visions of death.
I've abandoned them to their doom.
I've fled the battlefield at the sign of defeat.
What will become of me?

We've walked into a trap, blinded by our pride
All the brothers I have known died at my side.

And now I hide.

I don't know whom I fear most.
Our enemy, or my father the King.
I dare not face him again.
What will become of me?

Too lost in my own sorrow I didn't notice the changing surroundings.
Can't remember how I got here, I think I have lost my way.

I have been led astray from the path that I was following.
The sorry state I am in, it feels so unreal.

I fear that the final victory will not be mine.
This burden causes my feet to stumble
like I am walking to my grave.

I wonder if I'll ever find my way back home again?
Will I live to see my children become better men?

The bitter tears I've shed have clouded my vision
All I see is darkness and death on the path that lies before me.

I would cut out my eyes if that would make it all go away.
But I think this sorrow is mine to bear until the day I die.

Forsaken in this hostile land
Broken to the core
This sorrow is mine
Until the day I die!

I've long searched for death, but couldn't find it, save by my own hand.
But my pride stays my hand, I will go on as long as I can
Though my heart yearns for hope, I'm blinded by my stubbornness
I fail to see my own path leads to emptiness

Torn by guilt, broken to the core, don't I deserve more?
I should have followed your rule, oh father, I feel like a fool.
