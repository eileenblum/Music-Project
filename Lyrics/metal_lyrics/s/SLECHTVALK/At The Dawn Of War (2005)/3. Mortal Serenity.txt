The horde of destruction came riding on the storm
And left my serenity slowly to rot.
This once so bright future now frozen in pain,
A deep dark sadness solemnly rose.
Paralyzed crawling in this struggle unseen,
I felt down, exhausted, and entered a dream.
I awoke and gazed through the mist and the rain,
A gloomy cold landscape, the new dwelling for me.
Forgotten dwelling in this struggle unseen,
A breathless whisper from out of a dark path in mind.
A veil of cold laughter now covers this pain,
The black storms returned and I freely go in.
With this vision of pain, now I march on to war.
Reality sharpened and willing to fight.
New strength burns in me, decided to go.
My fist clenches cold steel, as we hailed our liege.
Hail! Hail!
Voiceless screaming â sleepless dreaming,
Tearless crying â breathless sighing.
âAnd there in a distance,
In the forest bare and cold, â
The pale beauty strays to find me nevermore.
