Silently we marched through forests and marshes
Our arrows waiting on our bows
My men, grim and prepared for the fight
A pale army of soldiers
Yes, we're marching to war

To war

Advance to war, banners high, towards our destiny
Advance to war, towards our destiny

With past battles on our minds
We wander towards the battlefields
The glorious battlefield

And then we reached the treeline of the enchanted forest
And there on heather fields a great battle was at hand
Standing and gazing at the frontline of the battle
A furious warcry filled the sky

Advance to war, banners high, towards our destiny
Advance to war, towards our destiny

And although many have fallen and many will fall in this ancient battle
Our captain blew on the horn and roared out loud,
"At the tips of our swords, they will only find death!"

Death
Death
Death
