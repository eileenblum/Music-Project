A gentle wind, that rustles the leaves, is whispering in my ear.
A bright moon gazes at me through the forest's canopy, lighting my path.

Wandering through the forest, I marvel at it's beauty
All shades of moss, covering the grounds on which I softly tread
Sometimes I sense a wild animal staring in wonder at my appearance
And silently I watch them, wondering if they are aware of what's coming to them

But a strange unnatural noise in the distance startles the animal, and I see it speeding off.
I softly weep, for I know that the days of comforting silence are gone.

Under a moonlit sky, I wander through the forest, marvelling at it's beauty, the serenity, the natural silence

The sky is red with the burning fire of the trees
It makes me weep
I see some heavily mutilated animals, running towards me in panic
I am shocked at the selfishness of the men who thought of this destruction
Of the earth on which I was born and raised

Under a moonlit sky, I wander through the forest, a deathly silence around the scorched ghostlike trees

Even for the creatures of the wild, there is no escape from the wars which scorch the earth
Defeat will mean the final death of us all
