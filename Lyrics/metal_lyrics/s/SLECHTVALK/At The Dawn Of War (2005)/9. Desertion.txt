Loyalty, a fading memory of the past.
The spies of our enemy are within our ranks.
Sowing dissension, inciting revolt
Their poison spreads like a plague.
Blinded to the deception of our enemy,
They deny his existence.
All houses are rising against each other,
The unity of the early days is gone.
The unity of our glory days is gone.
Only a few loyal remaining at our side,
Too few to conquer,
But enough to pose a threat.
Forever loyal to our cause we fight until the bitter end.
In the wake of our steadfast spirits
The hearts of many men are rekindled.
As we charge on the boundaries of our existence,
New armies are mustered to our cause.
