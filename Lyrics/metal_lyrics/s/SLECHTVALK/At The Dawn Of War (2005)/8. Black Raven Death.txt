A falcon was sent into the air by his master,
To begin his hunt for food.
With firm beats of his wings he ascended
Into the sky to begin his search.
There his eyes spotted far below him a black figure
Stirring in the depths.
Circling high up in the sky,
The falcon awaited the best moment to strike.
With great speed the falcon dove upon his prey,
His wings folded to reduce the drag of the winds.
The prey didnât notice the threat from above,
When all of a sudden his sight went black.
Sharp talons piercing the flesh,
Death came swiftly.
There was no way to escape.
The slain bird was heavier then he expected.
The falcon couldnât maintain his altitude.
He felt reluctant to let go of his prey,
But the threat of sharp rocks was at hand.
Then a southern wind went through the air...
Drifting on the warm current,
Carried by the wind,
The falcon quickly climbed again.
He shot through the sky over the forest,
When he heard his masterâs call.
In return the falcon gave a shriek
As an answer to his name.
His master wondered what the falcon was carrying,
The large black shadow he firmly held.
The black raven is dead.
He has killed himself a black raven
An unusual prey for a falcon,
But still the black raven is dead.
