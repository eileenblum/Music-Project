In a time of hatred and despair, I was blinded by the veil you had cast over me. I will not submit to
the terror you'd unleash if I don't do as you please
I have grown tired of you telling what's best for me, for everytime I follow you I find myself (stuck)
in misery. I will draw the line. And you happen to be on the other side of it.

I am not afraid of you, but I'd rather not see your face
For every time I think of you, I'm reminded of my disgrace.

Every day Iâm haunted with what I could have done, but how can I defeat myself for I am my own
enemy? This life has to end, but not in the way that you might want it to.
You try to persuade me to turn away from whatâs best for me, but now I know I must continue for I
want to be freed of you. This is where it ends and I no longer care wether you agree with me!

You talk of freedom and glory, yet what makes you think I am a blind man?
I have seen the fruit of your wisdom, its foul stench wakes me from my pleasant dreams.
what you think will set me free, binds me down in misery.
Once you may have ruled as king, but now suffer my new allegiance!

I'll drown you, my nemesis.
your reign is ending. Now you (will) die!

I am not afraid of you, but I'd rather not see your face
For every time I think of you, I'm reminded of my disgrace.

The battle has been won, but I still have the memories of all I have done, You were my worst
enemy, but now I'm free to turn into a different man than I otherwise would have been.
The memories fade with every choice I make differently and even if I fail you're no longer
controlling me and one day Iâll forget you.
