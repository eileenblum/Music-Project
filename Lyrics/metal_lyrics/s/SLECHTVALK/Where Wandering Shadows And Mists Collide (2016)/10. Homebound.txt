The war drove our army south to fight an invincible foe.
We were left without a choice, but it was our only hope.
Fight now, fight hard, fight 'til the very end!
Our hopes were dashed when our flanks were crushed.
Our blood turned stale and cold when we faced the giants of old.
Fight now, fight hard, fight 'til the bitter end!

And now we're returning home to the lands of our fathers
Where up high in the clear blue sky the glorious falcons fly
We'll find last solace in the arms of our beloved wives
Just to see our children cry when we lay down.

Although our fates were sealed and our dreams lie shattered
By the poison that courses through our veins,
We burned the bridge on our retreat to buy the time we need.
Our only hope is (that) our efforts were not in vain.
Yet our fate was cruel to us as the fire spread to the forest nearby.
In our haste to delay our enemy / the enemies' advance we've brought our country to ruin.

And now we're returning home to the lands of our fathers
Where up high in the clear blue sky the glorious falcons fly
We'll find last solace in the arms of our beloved wives
Just to see our children cry when we lay down to die

By our blood and lives our families are spared
To set sail towards the distant shores of the lands to the north.
