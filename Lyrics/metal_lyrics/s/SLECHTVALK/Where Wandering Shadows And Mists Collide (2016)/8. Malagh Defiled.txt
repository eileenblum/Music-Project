Maggots, is what you were when I found you trampled and broken by the tyranny of the man
who sold all for what he couldn't bear.
We built a kingdom, a crown to man, where none had to suffer,
but it was all in vain when you bent the rules in your favor.

Battles I've fought to keep you safe from harm. I fought the winged darkness,
but when I returned the old ways were gone, you forgot all I taught you.
You betrayed the covenant we had made and now it's you who suffers the consequence
Yet I swore to keep my end of the deal no matter what betrayal you'd do to me.

What you refused to share
What you received for naught
I will let them take
until you bend the knee

you were unworthy when I found you chained and broken by the tyranny I ended.
Now you became the tyrants, I should let them destroy you. But I swore to spare you if you were
ever untrue.

Together we vanquished, together we fought.
But now you'll endure the fruit of your own rule

You are unworthy to receive my mercy, but I can't just let you be destroyed

Together we'll vanquish, together we'll fight.
When I return you to Asternas restored

You betrayed the covenant we had made and now it's you who suffers the consequence
Yet I swore to keep my end of the deal no matter what betrayal you'd do to me.
