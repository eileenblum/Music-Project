I remember she smiled alot,
but when I looked into the eyes she got
I saw the pain she would not share,
she believed that noone ever cared.

I hoped she would open her heart to me,
but through her tears she was too blind to see
that I was always there for her
even though she never cared

I would have carried your burden,
if you just had let me in.

She laughed out loud when they threw her out
through the window I heard them shout,
She was beautiful in my eyes
and I loved her as she died.

And then they blamed me for it all,
that I was the reason of her fall,
like it was my fault the whole time,
but it was their doing not mine.

I would have carried your burden,
if you just had let me in.

Every day I wonder what I could have done more to help you,
But you wouldn't show me your tears, all my words fell on deaf ears.
You were the world to me, I really wanted to set you free .
But your smile was just for show, you made up your mind long ago,

Every day I wonder what to do with those who had hurt you,
Which is why I'll have to let go before the anger consumes my soul.
Know that I loved you then and that I love you even still,
but I can't let you drag me with you, lest I would no longer be the man you knew

Everyday I wondered what I could have done to help myself, but I didn't show you my tears, your
words didn't fall on deaf ears.
You were the world to me, I really wanted to be set free.
But my smile was just for show, I made up my mind long ago.
