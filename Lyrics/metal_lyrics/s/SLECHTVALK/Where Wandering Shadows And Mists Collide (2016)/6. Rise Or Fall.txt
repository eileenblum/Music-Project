Arise my brethren, why are you lying down?
The fight is here now, why won't you take your sword?
Death is final if you won't rise. Rise or fall.

To rise or fall. I know your melancholy feeds your self pity,
but now is not the time. You're not the only one, who'll suffer when you fail.
Rise or Fall.

Your mind is caught by the deception you will fail again and again.
You believe you are a coward.
Have no fear, victory can be yours if you'd only rise and use the sword that was given you

Arise! Dwell on your failures and you've already lost, don't linger in regret.

Damn your pride, you know you need help.
Don't deny your failures or you will do them again.
You think you 're standing, but you've been misled.
Arise or face your ruin.
