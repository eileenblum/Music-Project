We are the unborn you had killed
We are the women you have raped
We are the poor you didn't feed
We are the slain dead at your feet.
We are the bloodstains on your hands
We are the wounds time cannot mend
We are the people you have enslaved
We are the ones you could have saved.

We were the screams you heard that night
When all stood silent 'til first light
We are your courage that failed that day
We are the consequence from your "nay"
We are the people you've let been killed
We are the dreams left unfulfilled
We are the dead of life depraved
We are the ones you should have saved.

We are! We are!
We are! We are!

We are the children that lay dead
We are the blood that has been shed
We are the victims of our time
We are the failure of your line
We are the reason you'll find no rest
Why you twist and twirl inside your bed
We are the burden of your guilt
We are the voice that must be heard

You rode to war to preserve your wealth, but not for us, as if we were less than others.
How can you pretend to sleep at night, when we lay dying at your doorsteps?
(Yet) there you feast on the blood we spilled, for which you believe you'll never have to answer.
'Til you discover on your final day when Justice comes riding in his shining armour

We are the voice that shall be heard!
