They stride forth slumbering, waiting for their deaths to come.
What hope remained to them slowly faded away.

I remember the splendour, the towering halls of those once my kin.
I remember the maidens bright and fair.
I admired their wisdom, the strength of their arms, the glory of their king.
I admired the maidens bright and fair.

Though I departed to a distant realm unknown to me,
I felt inclined to return someday.

As shadows they wander, slowly dissolving into the mists.
their beauty had faded, their strength had withered away

All that my eyes could see was death standing in front of me.
So cold, so cold were their eyes to me.
What was left of their splendour, was all but an ancient memory
No one to answer the children's cries.

I tried waking them from their lucid dreams, yet noone would heed the decay around them.
A man I woke answered my concern with a dagger between my ribs before returning to his dream.

the dread that filled me, was naught compared to what I witnessed then
As I died, I saw a mist surround the man.
A laughter roared when he dissolved into the mist.

As shadows they wander, slowly dissolving into the mists.
their beauty had faded, their strength had withered away
