Why hast thou forsaken me? 
Why hast thou turned away thy face 
From me thy servant in distress 
Oh Lord bent me thine ear! 

All night long I drown in my tears 
My bones are vexed, my heart is sore and vexed 
Water rises to my lips 
My throat is sore, I cannot speak 

Lord I beg thee to free me of this grief 
Which still haunts my soul, and makes my heart grow cold 

I am merely all skin over bone 
My flesh is too weak to resist the temptations 
Which the evil layeth upon my path 
I fear I yield to this heavy burden 

"What has become of the son, who loved me 
for so many years and now calls me into doubt 
He who has worshipped me for so long 
Now lives under the spell of the wicked 
That brings his soul only further in Darkness 
Away from love and closer to hatred 
Don't you know that I'll always love you? 
Return to me and I'll take care of you 
I'll bring peace in your mind and rest in your troubled heart 
I will treat you as my son 
I'll make you a warrior of the Light" 

Nightly creatures still haunt my soul 
Crawling against the walls of my broken heart 
screaming inhuman blasphemous words 
Exalting the hordes of demon lords 

Where are you God?!?! 
"Here, waiting for you my son." 

I will always love you Lord 
Even in times of terrible Darkness 
Nothing can stop me from worshipping you 
Even if it means the end of my earthly life
