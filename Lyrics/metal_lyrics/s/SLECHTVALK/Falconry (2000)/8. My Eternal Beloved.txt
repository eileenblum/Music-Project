At last our eyes, they meet again 
I feel a shiver through my veins 
Your eyes they look so cold 
It makes my heart bleed 

Every single day my love for you grows 
Every day this torment shrieks through my soul 

I have made the wrong choice, to fall in love with you 
Daughter of Darkness, you hate to dwell in light 

Now, I have to abandon you for my soul's sake 
There is no future for us, only my dreadful sorrow 

Your cold stare still burns in my heart 
Don't leave me with this pain, walk with me into the light 

I shall always love you 
My eternal beloved
