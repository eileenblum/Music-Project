Your name I call in this darkened world 
Where the night dwells in every place 
But I know You will return and bring 
A Kingdom of love and peace 

And end the terror, under 
the reign of the anti-christ 

Come and surround us with Your beauty 
End this sorrowful time and bring Your light 

The night shall shiver by the sound of Your voice 
And flee from Your coming holy light 

Call Thy name I will forever 
Nothing will prevent me from doing so 

And Your love I will caress for eternity 
And Your enemies I will oppose until the end. 

Come and show us Your glory 
Depart, evil spirits of Lucifer 
Let justice be done 
Let Your enemies burn in their defeat 

Come and show us Your strength and glory 
Depart, evil spirits of Lucifer 
Let justice be done in this darkened world 
Let Your enemies burn in their defeat
