Once upon a time, There was a majestic empire 
The Empire of Darkness, ruled by the emperor, with powers so great 
He tortured his slaves, and drank their blood to please his lust 

With a blaze of holy light 
A warrior entered the realms of night 
Alone, unarmed he increased his pace 
To meet the emperor face to face 

But the emperor did not want to see this man 
And send his loyal knights to seize this man 
But their swords couldn't cut this man's flesh or bones 
And with one look the man turned the knights into stone 

The sight of defeat enraged the dark lord 
He gathered his angels and raised his sword 
But it was time to realize this battle could not be won 
Yet the loss of his angels only increased his crimson thorn 

With eyes of fire, the Emperor unleashed his cry 
And heaved his sword, to make the warrior die 
But his sword he clumsily lost 
And he saw it vanish in a cloud of dust 

And when the cloud of dust withdrew 
He saw the face of the enemy he knew 
Fear of death haunted his mind 
but the victor was just too kind 

Instead of killing him, He took away his pride 
As he gathered his old slaves at his side 
And he led them to the Kingdom of the Light 
and freed them from captivity in the Empire of Night 

With his departure He casted a blaze of fire 
And sulfur and flames replaced the water of the mire 
And the ones who stayed behind were consumed by flames 
And the ones who were freed were called the saints 

But the emperor has escaped a certain death 
And now leads others to their eternal death
