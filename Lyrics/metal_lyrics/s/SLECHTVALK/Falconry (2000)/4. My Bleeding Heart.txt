My soul hungers for human blood, Every day I yearn for more 
With every kill, my human heart turns into stone 
I have killed sworn enemies, betrayed my closest friends 
I have dishonoured my clan, 'cause I once drank human blood 

Memories I tried to forget still haunt my soul 
The face of my first victim I shall never forget 
The look filled with horror and betrayal 
The face of the one I have loved for so many years 

I couldn't live with this foul murder 
But I couldn't resist the temptation 
My best friend I killed with great delight 
And I drank his blood as if it were wine 

Nothing could stop me from this endless killing 
For it was the only way to forget 
To forget my first kill 
The dying face of my eternally beloved 

For years I have lived without conscience 
For years I have lived only on human blood 
For years I have been unbeaten 
For eternity I feel the emptiness in my heart 

My bleeding heart 
The arrow piercing the flesh 
The slayer I thought I had beaten 
Now defeated me 

On my knees I beg for my life 
The slayer remembers me of my dead wife 
At last my Darkest memories have returned 
To torment my soul just before it burns 

Remorse is the only thing I can think of 
Forgiveness is the only thing I want 
Death is my only future 
Hell is where I belong 

With my dying breath I ask this rogue 
forgiveness for my unforgivable sins 
Her answer seemed so unreal 
her voice was not hers 
My old love spoke the words 
I feel complete 
I am saved 
The slayer saved me 
I owe her my life 
But I am already dead
