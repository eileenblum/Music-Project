The Night, The screams, The Blood, the horror 
the stench, the flames, the despair, the pain 

I burn in the pools of hell 
My flesh, it reeks of corpses 
I wish I was just a corpse 
then the pain would stop torturing me forever 

salt in my open wounds 
burning through my senses 
my heart scorched black by the flames 
as black as my soul in my earthly life 

Noooo, Lord 
please, forgive me 

I am too late, my soul is already condemned 
for eternal torture in this pool of hell 

I remember the face of Jesus 
At the Day of Judgement 
when He watched me being condemned 
for not accepting His Sacrifice 

God, I wish I accepted Your love in my life 
so I would never burn in this agony 
I wish my soul was not spent 
So I would reign beside you as a king
