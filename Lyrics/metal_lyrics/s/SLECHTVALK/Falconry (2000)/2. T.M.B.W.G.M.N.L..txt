The Messias has come upon our earth to bring us a world of peace 
The Savior has won, from the Lord of demonic fallen angels 
He gave us His life, so that we could live for eternity in Heaven 
To become immortal you have to let Him live in your heart 

[Chorus 1:]
Let us all gather in this holy place 
To bring praise and worship to the mighty Lord 
Open your heart and let Him enter 
And feel His love as you will pray 

The blood of the Martyr, who was slain on the cross 
brought death to the wicked and life to the dead 
The Sins of the world, He carried to his death 
And Death He did beat in the pools of hell 

[Chorus 2:]
Heaven awaits the reborn souls 
And hell is for those, who let Him fall 
The battle He has won, so we shouldn't fear 
Death if we live in the Lord 

You have come to earth to die 
You gave your life for us to live [2x]

Darkness falls unto those 
who have rejected Jesus' sacrifice [2x]

Your soul is not something you can throw away 
And not feel the consequence of your acts 
Jesus has given you a chance to live 
In heaven for eternity at His side 

[Chorus 3:]
For once be serious in your life 
And accept the Lord as your only Lord 
Do not sell your soul to the lord of the dead 
'cause once you're dead, you are unsaved
