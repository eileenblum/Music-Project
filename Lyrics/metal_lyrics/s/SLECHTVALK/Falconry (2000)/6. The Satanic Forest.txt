In the Forest, where night always dwells 
Chants of satanic rituals are sung 
To blaspheme the name of the Lord of Light 
And curse the ones standing under His might 

Screaming in the midst of the night, a creature rises 
To consume the souls of light 
With powers so unknown 
To impress even the saints 
And lure them into death 
Such are the prophecies from forgotten days. 

And the time is so near 
that Darkness will conquer its way 
out of the forest of the night 
to spread its might 

Calling for their Lord 
The Saints live in fear 
For the mark of the beast 
Which is 666 
The only way to buy some food 
But also the mark for the Doomed 

Lightning will pierce the night and bring the day 
The Conqueror of all 

The end has come for the spirits of evil 
And the fools with the mark on their hand 

The Satanic Forest burns in agony 
With the lost therein. 
Satan bound in chains for 1000 years 
A Kingdom of peace begins
