When the fire finally extinguished in the morning sun
I gathered the remnants from the choir, who were slain

This cowardly slaughter I fail to grasp it all
They could not even defend themselves
What beasts were they, who did this to these saints
The need for them to die, I wonder why

"Dost thou not see the war that plagues the land
The dragon's campaign to conquer this world"

Seven bodies, seven graves I digged for them
"For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return"
Under the setting sun I buried the last one
"My children now come to me"

In these times of Darkness,
where the Dragon attempts to overthrow the kingdom of light,
in secret the final defeat of the dragon is being prepared
