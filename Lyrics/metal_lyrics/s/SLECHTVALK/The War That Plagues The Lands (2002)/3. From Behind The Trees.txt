Now I wander in the forest to find my peace
Fighting the haunting memories of the past
Trying to realise the greatness of the forgiveness bestowed
On my heart, which is darkened with sorrow

At last its meaning seems to grasp me
With newfound strength I carry on
Unaware of the danger that lurks from behind the trees
And the certain death that seems to await me

From behind the trees, two arrows were sent
on an intercept course
To weaken the noble warrior for the battle that lies ahead

Dark souls left the shadows to surround me
With eyes full of hate they called to me
Feeling reluctant to leave me without a fight
As if the arrows were not deadly enough

The slow poison of the arrows
Is taking me into death's embrace
I feel a shiver through my stomach
As an axe found its way through the flesh

As I drop on my knees I see my attackers run away
No doubt on another mission of chaos and mayhem

The dragon will only lead them into the black abyss
But I fear they do not know their own destiny

Soon I will die alone, left behind in this cold forest
Yet I am not afraid of death for I know what lies beyond
