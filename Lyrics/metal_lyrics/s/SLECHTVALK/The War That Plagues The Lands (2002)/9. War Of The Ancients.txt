The winter sun shines upon the path that lies before me
It leads into the forests of the royal domains

The smouldering ruins of the church, that has burned down
I leave behind as I continue on my journey

Screams that cut through my bones I hear,
coming from the woods nearby
Fear makes my strength disappear;
my feet are frozen to the ground

Hear the forest fall silent once the screams faded away
I wonder what has happened over there

Slowly I overcome my fear and once again I let myself be led
By my curiosity into the forest wondering what I'll find this time

"The dark shadows, the sons of the dragon
who had killed the saints,
were brutally slaughtered by the wild beasts
that inhabit the forests
Their corpses torn by claws and fangs,
a death so horrid as the one they
brought to the king's men two nights before"

A strange feeling of justice enters my mind
As I see the remnants of the dragon's children

The war of the ancients is at its peak

It rages on in all lands, there is no escape from it
A choice must be made for the ones that wander about

Time passes quickly; soon the war will come to its end
The window of opportunity is getting slim
and soon it might be too late
