We are called upon to go to war
Our banners raised high, we march on
Our steel glinting in the setting sun
death can't stop us from achieving victory

When we finished to set up our encampment
I was appointed to be the first to guard
As my men closed their eyes to sleep
I warmed myself at a small fire

Then a deep sleep - overwhelmed me
He tried to fight it, but he failed
And then - our enemies approached
But no one noticed them, for all were asleep
Silently they slit their throats, leaving one alive;
their captain was spared for another day

Suddenly I awaken from my sleep
I call for my men for the morning has come
But when I look around me I see them
All slaughtered but I am still alive

I wander between the corpses of my men
Abhorred by this carnage I ask myself
What has happened to my men?

Slowly I return to where the castle is
of the king, whom I must tell
of my failure, the death of his men
I fear the judgement that awaits me
