Silence! The screams that haunted me have returned
Crawling. I feel their claws scratching my brain
Destiny. Final Death awaits
Coming. I see Grim Reaper's face

A freezing wind cuts through my wounds
like sharp razors,
The pain it inflicts is making me go insane

Even now moments before my death,
evil tries to lead me astray
Making me false promises in the hope
I fall for his ways

I feel an infection coming in through my wounds;
The end has begun for me
There is little hope for me to survive my great demise
Again I hear the voice, which calls me his son
But then the screams that haunted me returned again

"It is time, to accept what you are,
nothing more than a sinful creature
who is afraid of the night
Salvation of death, it's just a lie you believe in,
to make it easier to face the unknown."

Now in the cold-blooded snow I lie trembling
with fear of my death

Death approaches me with a scythe in his hand
Waiting for the moment to harvest his crop
I sent my falcon away to get some help
But I already knew it would come too late

Things are seldom what they seem,
The end is in fact just a beginning
For my spirit has become immortal
Through the blood of he who was slain before me

The fire in my eyes is extinguished slowly,
my life is at an end, my death is at hand
I have lost all feeling, my wounds stopped bleeding,
my flesh is frozen by the wind,
Memories from times long ago are passing by,
my father, my liege I think I must cry
For my heart is faltering, my spirit is leaving;
with my dying breath I make my last call
