Cold sharp hail is blown into my face by a stormy wind
I take shelter in a small wooden church near the black woods
A choir sings some songs of praise and worship for their lord
For a little while it makes me forget the sorrow I am in

"In distress we call to thee, we await thy return
for the forces of evil are closing in upon us,
but with thy help we can live beyond our lives' end,
oh Lord accept our gratitude for thy sacrifice"

I hear a call in the distance, it startles me
For it seems like the call of a dying man, I ascend my horse

As we leave our shelter to challenge the raging storm
I hear the shrieks of a falcon from within the fog ahead of us

Amazed to hear a falcon's shriek in this time of year
I ride towards the branch on which the falcon sits

I feel a cold shiver as I enter the forest in search of this man
With the falcon as my guide, and a bastard sword at my side
A strange feeling that makes me a bit sick tells me I am near
The source of the horrible scream, which I heard a short while ago

The slain body of a warrior is what I find here
It looks a bit familiar but I cannot seem to grasp it

Death takes even the best of us
Away from the world of the living
I wonder what the cause was
For the death of this man

"Dost thou not see the war that plagues the land
our enemies gather before our beloved city"

His face carries a strange expression
He seems to have been content
I wonder if there's more to it
Is there a truth in the books of old?
