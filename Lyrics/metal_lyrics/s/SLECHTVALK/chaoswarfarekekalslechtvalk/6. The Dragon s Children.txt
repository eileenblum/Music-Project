What have we done, us children of the ancient dragon
Whose lives ended by the scythe of death

Where are our earned virtue, the endless feasts and women?
We now only meet Darkness in these mists
Why have we fallen for the lies of the dragon
And condemned our souls into this void

Endless torture of our souls
Eternal despair has commenced

Our destiny, the flames around us lit it all
In the distance we once heard faint songs of praise
Coming from the King's court, where they knew no sorrow
But no one could deny the eternal screams of horror

What have we done, us children of the ancient dragon
Misled by the many lies of the beast
Now we dwell, where we did not want to be
Insanity, despair, horror ever ongoing
