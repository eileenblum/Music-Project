Another star on the night sky
A set of white wings to fly
And travel to a holy land
Another coin to crown my hand...
Over a tiny angel to be
Playing on the clouds eternally

You're such a little snake
Little snake sister
Squeeze and brake
Twist and shake
Hurry before the sleepy ones awake
Ofelia my darling, don't you give in
to the echoes within

Ofelia queen of heartache and sorrow
Carving nightmares out of dreams
You can scream as you go
No one will ever know
I'm saving you from the pain of tomorrow
And pray you'll find a halo where you go

I thank you mothers for the children left behind
And all the money I can carry
This life may treat me kind

Heartbeats
Such a sweet little sound
Small feet
Won't touch the ground

The maker of angels leads the way
From the cradle to the grave
And how she sings that lullaby
Straight from her stone
Into the light alone

Sisters you will go to hell
And so you might as well
Stay in the shadows working
You know I won't tell...
Avoid getting your soul signed
You should get away,
Get away from the one
Who is playing with your mind

Ofelia queen of heartache and sorrow
Carving nightmares out of dreams
You can scream as you go
No one will ever know
I'm saving you from the pain of tomorrow
And pray you'll find a halo where you go

I thank you mothers for the children left behind
And all the money I can carry
This life may treat me kind

Se neat
Every finger and toe
Small feet
Will never grow

The maker of angels leads the war
From the cradle to the grave
And how she sings that lullaby
Straight from her stone
Into the light alone

How come these foul accusations?
He made me save them from tears
Singing my lullaby
I've had my heart and soul controlled by
the raven
And for the crime he should be
Sent to live beneath instead of me

Order in the court
She has denied
And now the jury will decide
To what extent
This Angelmaker lied

Goodnight Ofelia! By the rope you will hang for
carving nightmares out of dreams
We will feed on your fear
no one will shed a tear
Ofelia you won't see tomorrow
And black is the shame in your eyes as you go

I damn you mothers for the children left behind
And all the guilt I have to carry
Life did not treat me kind

The maker of angels leads the way
From the cradle to the grave
And how she sings that song
Straight from her stone
Into the light alone
