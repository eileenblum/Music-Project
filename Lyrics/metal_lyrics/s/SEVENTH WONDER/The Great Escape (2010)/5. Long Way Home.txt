I am taking the long way home
I really messed up and I'm late again
And my belly aches from fear
How, when and where?
How can keys just disappear?
I would die to have them here again...

All the luck in the world, strength and magic
Is not enough for a fate so tragic
Every piece of that heart
afraid to go in just to fall apart

On a rainy day
Home is where you're feeling safe
And where you always feel OK to stay
And a lovely day you'll be on your way
To build this perfect family
Now do you think that's gonna happen, to me?

I am taking the long way
And I walk real slow
And I don't mind that it's raining
Because then the tears won't seem to show
And I wonder that the world would really say
If I simply disappeared today
I guess no one would notice anyway

All the luck in the world strength and magic
is not enough to heal, it's tragic
Every part of that heart
Afraid

And on a rainy day
Home is where you're feeling safe
And where you always feel OK to stay
And a lovely day you'll be on your way
To build this perfect family
Now do you think that's gonna happen, to me?

On a rainy day
Home is where I am not sage
And where I never feel OK to stay
And a lovely day I'll be on my way
To crash a perfect family
And all that I can do is cry
