Somewhere beyond two pale blue eyes
You got a feeling that something here ain't right
So you keep them closed with all your might
And live your life even though your heart is on the line
Still you sway in silence killing time with wine

Every moment hit below the waterline
A tear in the design
The band's still playing but the captain resigns
And as we're all going down
She's trying hard not to drown

Fallen
Maid of earth wind of fire
By the hands of your lies
Wiseman looks up from his cold crystal ball
While he cries Utopia dies

You know it's only up to you
But you don't want to believe what you know is true
Still hiding behind your mirrors blue
What will you do every time your children turn to you?
Wondering â when the world is gone, will we go too?

Every moment hit below the waterline
A tear in the design
The band's still playing but the captain resigns
And as we're all going down
She tries in vain not to drown

Fallen
Maid of earth wind of fire
By the hands of your lies
Wiseman looks up from his cold crystal ball
While he cries Utopia dies

Please tell us a story of Oceans and skies
Let's imagine this beautiful paradise before us rise
Now open your eyes...
Watching this land
Once majestic and grand
Still I can't feel the truth in my hand
I keep spreading this bad disease
And fall down on my knees
Because I'm here to confess
And I'm sorry goddess!
But she's quiet today
Silent as it to say
Fly away!

Fallen
Maid of earth wind of fire
By the hands of your lies
Wiseman looks up from his cold crystal ball
While he cries Utopia dies
