Stay away from the dark river
It's cold outside tonight
And his name feels like a shiver down my spine
Shut all the windows, because God knows
Deep in the shadows of the moonlight
someone's watching us
Filling our lungs with feelings unfelt...

When you spin around
to a different sound
It's the sound of the violent violin
Written just to move you
The song you're bound to, it is making you blind
Don't look behind
A boy with music mainly on his mind
is not hard to find
A single note is all I need to fold him blind

I am higher than the sky
I want to fly
Never felt so alive
So, show me how to play
and I'll surrender to you now
I don't know why
I wanna cry
I'm so happy that I could die
Show me how to play
and I'll stay right here with you

They are crystal clear
The very last notes he will hear
are the wailings from the king
of the whitewater pouring in

A mourning mother in her kitchen
Lies crying on the floor
Not knowing if it's real or fiction any more
A lifetime she'd trade for
just one more story on the side of his bed
And when she is running through the shadows
a familiar melody is playing in her head

When you spin around
to a different sound
It's the sound of the violent violin
Written just to move you
The song you're bound to, it is making you blind
Don't look behind
A woman hurt with vengeance on her mind
is not hard to find
A single note is all I need to fold her blind

I am higher than the sky
I want to fly
Never felt so alive
So, show me how to play
and I'll surrender to you now
I don't know why
I wanna cry
I'm so happy that I could die
Show me how to play
and I'll stay right here with you

They are crystal clear
The very last notes she will hear
are the wailings from a king
of the water pouring in

You are higher than the sky
You want to fly
Never felt so alive
He'll show you how to play
Make you surrender to him now
You don't know why
You wanna cry
You're so happy that you could die
He'll show you how to play
Make you stay right there with him

They are crystal clear
The very last notes you will hear
are the sad wailings from the king
of the whitewater pouring in...
