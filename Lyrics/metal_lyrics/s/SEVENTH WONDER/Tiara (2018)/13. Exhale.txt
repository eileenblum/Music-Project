No deliverance!

Now we land in smoke and ruins
Surrendering, the people arrive, giving in
In the light of understanding
Lies another chance to make it right

When the wind roars in your face you know
It's the storm before the calm
Because darkness is blinding right before the dawn

As you rise from the ashes remember tomorrow
We're taking off to the skies
Awoken remorse saw the firelight fade in her eyes
In the unselfish sacrifice true redemption lies
And the world exhaled

Here we stand in broken ruins
A people lost without anything left to lose
All we need to keep believe
Is a hand there in the cold dark night

When the wind roars in your face you know
It's the storm before the calm
Because darkness will blind you right before the dawn

Brother tell me I'm madâ¦ but did her hand just move
Sister, did you see it too?
I would trade my last heartbeat for that to be the truth

As you rise from the ashes remember tomorrow
We're taking off to the skies
Awoken remorse saw the firelight fade in her eyes
In the unselfish sacrifice true redemption lies

...and the world exhaled
