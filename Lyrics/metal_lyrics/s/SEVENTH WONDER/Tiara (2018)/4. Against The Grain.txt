Stop pretending like you know it all!
From the top of my lungs I am begging you all, please stop!
Because even though I am just a child,
Still I see this isn't real
A computer could never love, a machine could never feel
Live a life, or live a dream?

One girl against them all, just one to break the mold and
One voice you could hear a needle fall

Like an island lost in a stream
It's a nightmare that you call a dream
You were raised to be honest now look at yourself,
Can you righteously stand to defend your truth?

When our vision was blurred, and our hearts lead astray
She opened our eyes for us
We must gather the greatest of minds we can find
There must be a way to survive

One girl against them all, lo and behold
