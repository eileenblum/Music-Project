I can hear them through the windows singing out my name
They all laugh and sound so happy. Why so happy? I don't know
If I fail, if I don't make it, will their song remain the same?
Or will the echoes fade to make these streets all silence once again?

They say I'm the one, but what if I'm not the one
Who can save us from the end of the word?
Even though I must go, it's important to know,
I am scared but I won't let it show
What if I, if I'll never do what I did in my
Dreams so many times, I wonder will I ever say

Hey, if you tell me yours, I'll tell you mine
A perfect stranger in a ticket line
Just like in the movies, will he put his hand in mine?
And will I ever dance prom night away,
And throw my hat up high on graduation day
I think it's safe to say the best is yet to come
There somewhere beyond today

I can hear her in the kitchen, crying out my name
And how it breaks her heart, this brand-new start
Will tear all she knows apart
I can hear him in the hallway falling to his knees
And the always strong and silent one is not silent anymore

They say I'm the one, but what if I'm not the one
Who can save us at the edge of the word?
Even though I must go, it's important to know, butâ¦

...if you tell me yours, I'll tell you mine
A perfect stranger in a ticket line
Just like in the movies, will he put his hand in mine?
And will I ever dance prom night away,
And throw my hat up high on graduation day
I think it's safe to say the best is yet to come

Will someone ask my dad for his daughter's hand?
To make her princess of the promised land
Just like in the movies, will I feel those butterflies?
Will I grow up to make my mother proud?
Despite my rebel years when I was way too loud
I think it's safe to say the best is yet to come
There somewhere beyond today
There somewhere beyond today
