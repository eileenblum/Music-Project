Revelation, castigation
Raining sinful shadows screaming, down from above
Pending death on the horizon
Today betrayal damned us all

I don't care what they say,
My darling Tiara returned from the skies today
But forever is fading away, hear themâ¦

Fight, fight for your life
A kingdom's burning
Run, run chaos arise
By the light of the funeral pyres
Mourning tears from the masses,
Drowning the sound of the sorrows that paint the night

As we're dying, as we're trying
Primal instincts taking over us like a drug
Now that nothing really matters
And nothing more is left to lose

Dry your tears honey, do
For the moment with you, I would trade all the moments I knew
Don't cry little one, here they come -hear them

Fight, fight for your life
A kingdom's burning
Run, run chaos arise
By the light of the funeral pyres
Mourning tears from the masses,
Drowning the sound of the horrors that paint the night

Can you hear them fight, fight for your life
A kingdom's burning
Run, run chaos arise
By the light of the funeral pyres
Mourning tears from the masses,
As her song will echo no more
