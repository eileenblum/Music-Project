With the weight of our world on my back
I am travelling far off the beaten track
And whenever I'm homesick and
I wonder if I am brave enough
I remind myself that I have to stay tough

I'm getting closer as I'm further away
I was chosen to plead for another day
Yes I was the one to make them notice,
And the one to make them see
I don't understand why it had to be me

Yet here I stand
In a faraway land
Not knowing if I'll ever see them again
I bring a symbol of peace
I just hope they will take it off my hands
Now I stand at the gates, let me in

In these eternal sacred halls
It's decided who lives and who falls
Never before have we faltered,
Unmarred our truth
Yet here you stand
Young child
So speak

I speak before you today
I can't say what they want me to say
Because I was raised to be honest and true to myself
These are my words
My choice
My truth
