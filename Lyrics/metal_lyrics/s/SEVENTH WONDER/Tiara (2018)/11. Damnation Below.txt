We behold the world and forever
Gauging good and evil in the afterlife
Would you reconcile and turn away
Or would you bite the bullet, bleed for what is right?

A step through space and time for this is the hour
No tears left to wipe in the aftermath
We bring an end to fallen men and empires
For the greater good of all, with somber minds we let the hammer fall

With the weight of her own world upon her back she came alone
Not knowing if she'd ever come back home
She was sent away far off the beaten track, sent to atone
Not only did she do it, no she did it on her own

One final stare into the barrel of a gun
This is the end
Once again the bleeding skyline torn asunder
Damnation below the suns
Behold the everones

We acknowledge that a girl lit a fire
Single candle in a sea of black
Could it be the flower piercing the mire?
There was truth in her worlds, could there still be hope for planet earth?

Because she was sent away far off the beaten track, sent to atone
Not only did she do it, no she did it on her own

One final stare into the barrel of a gun
This is the end
Once again the bleeding skyline torn asunder
Damnation below the suns
Behold the harm you've done
