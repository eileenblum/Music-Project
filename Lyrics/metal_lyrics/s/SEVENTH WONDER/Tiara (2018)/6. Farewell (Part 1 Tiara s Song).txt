Did you hear what they said?
Is it true, there's a way out?
I put my trust in her
Like a true believer
And with the truth in her heart
She's the one, our last defense
Her innocence will make the Everones believe her

And even if the girl returns unharmed
I don't want you to be alarmed
Even if she did, we'd still feel your fear
And even if our hearts keep beating like machines
Believe me, we still feel your pain

(This is farewell)
Farewell, Tiara, this song is yours
From Sahara to the seven seas it soars
A million voices stand and sing this chorus
Oh, Tiara, saviour of our dying shores

Tonight is the night
We celebrate a new beginning
Brother, raise your glass
So, Tiara, our one and only hope
Here's to you

Prepare for the worst
Wish for the best
Will she do it?
Leave it all behind for the stranger and the liar
And I just can't see
For the life of me
What inhumanity
Could make the Everones deny her

If your daughter would commit and not fulfill
I'm not saying she will but still
Even if she did we'd still feel your fear
And even if our hearts keep beating like a drum
Believe me, we still feel your pain
(We still feel your pain)

(This is farewell)
Farewell, Tiara, this song is yours
From Sahara to the seven seas it soars
A million voices stand and sing this chorus
Oh, Tiara, saviour of our dying shores

Tonight is the night
We celebrate a new beginning
Brother, raise your glass
For Tiara, our one and only hope
Because of you

We will be victorious, victorious we rise
Glorious, victorious
We stand to win this fight
You will be victorious
Victorious we rise
Glorious, victorious
We stand to win this fight

With you, Tiara, we crown the skies
Unlike Aniara you won't fly to your demise
And we'll come home
And welcome home when you have won this war
From the valleys to the mountains it will roar

(This is farewell)
Farewell, Tiara, this song is yours
From Sahara to the seven seas it soars
A million voices stand and sing this chorus
Oh, Tiara, saviour of our dying shores!

Tonight is the night
We celebrate a new beginning
Brother, raise your glass
So, Tiara, our one and only hope
Here's to you
