When I grew up there was
Not a single thing
That would make me feel whole
Then you arrived
Seven pounds of beautiful
And I knew that there was love in this world

But now I break and I cave. I crumble inside,
But I won't let it show in my voice
Because what kind of life would this be
If you're not here with me?
How could I ever live without you?

So goodnight but not goodbye
Close your eyes and learn to fly
You can if you try
Be the bravest astronaut the world has ever seen
Now take off
Into a dreamâ¦

I always thought I would
Walk you down the aisle
I see my life there inside your eyes
And I'd always be there to catch you when you fall
I can't bear that I have to let go

And so I break and I cave. I crumble inside
But I won't left it show in my face
Because the tomorrow I see,
Without you here with me,
Is a future where I don't want to be

So goodnight this is not goodbye
Close your eyes and learn to fly...
