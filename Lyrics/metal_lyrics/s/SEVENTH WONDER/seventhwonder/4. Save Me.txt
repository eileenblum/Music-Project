Centuries ago
When returning to my home
After I won a war so long
I found my love missing
And found that she had died
Feeling betrayed I renounced my God

Save me
From this craving thirst for
Crimson wine

Grieving bereavement
Made me subject for a curse
Living like dead for eternity
At first filled with anger
With pleasure I killed to live
But creatures of night come to miss the day

[Chorus]
Prayers
To a God deserted
To grant my rest

Never will I die
All I do is cry
For the ones who gave
Their blood to be my slaves

This has got to stop
My mind is giving up
To my God I pray
Forgive me some day!

Victim of true love

[Chorus]
Prayers
To a God deserted
To grant my rest
