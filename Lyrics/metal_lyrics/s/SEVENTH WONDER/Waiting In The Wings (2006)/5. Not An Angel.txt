Even when alone I'm not lonely
Even when you're hot I am cold as ice
Another day another lie
And there is nobody to catch me
When I'm falling
Wake up my dear and smell the salt
Don't hide your fear it's not your fault
And from the day I saw your face
I've been lying

Soon she will die
In the enemy bed she's sleeping
Innocent victim of this dark charade
But my secret remains in the shade

Yeah I want you to know
I'm not an angel
This evening I can longer hide
I'm not just a man
And I want you to know
I'm not your angel
Darling run -- why can't you see?
So run...away from me

Under the moon
My heart is turning black
Under my disguise
Another night. Another dies
And if you find a place to hide I'll
Kick the walls in
What you don't know
Will not hurt you
But here is the blow
That is not true
And you will never know what hit you

Until the end I will love you
And love is blind. Now that is true
Cause you will never know what hit you
I've been lying

Soon she will die
In the enemy bed she's sleeping
Innocent victim of this dark charade
But my secret remains in the shade

Yeah I want you to know
I'm not an angel
This evening I can longer hide
I'm not just a man
And I want you to know
I'm not your angel
Darling run -- why can't you see?
So run... away from me

Tonight there is evil
On the ground
Tonight there is evil
Hold on tighter
When you believe
There is no one to blame
I've got to prove you wrong
Yeah

Yeah I want you to know
I'm not an angel
This evening I can longer hide
I'm not just a man
And I want you to know
I'm not your angel
Darling run -- why can't you see?
So run... away from me
