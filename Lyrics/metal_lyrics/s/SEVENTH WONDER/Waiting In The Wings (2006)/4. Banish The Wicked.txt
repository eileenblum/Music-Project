When the morning arrives
The whispering wind reveals
The intentions of the night
So don't you tease the power
Watching over us
The childless and sad mother cries
Oh please, be careful
So children stop your foolish games
Ad smile towards the light
And don't you dare cry

So many friends have died
And we all know it's too many
How can we possibly break this curse?
I don't know
She will probably punish me
For even thinking about
Leaving the village

And the people know
They got no place to go

When the goddess dance
Across the heavens
She's so bright
Like an arch of light
They couldn't dream
Of denying her will tonight
The righteous will stand
And the wicked are banished
From her land

When the evening arrives
They stand before the queen
May her judgment
Free or fail the lawless
The widow cries a silent tear
The scar of a justified fear of loosing
Cause someone's watching over them
Impaling every move
With raging northern light

So many friends have died
And we all know it's too many
How can we possibly break this curse?
I don't know
She will probably punish me
For even thinking about
Leaving the village

And the people know
To turn the lights down low

[Chorus:]
One light, one spell
One dance for all the breathless
So scared, inside -- spare me, goddess!

When she's dancing all across the heavens
She's so bright like
An arch of light
They couldn't dream
Of denying her will tonight
When she's dancing
All across the heavens
She so bright...so bright
They couldn't dream
Of denying her will tonight
And the righteous will stand
As she'll banish the wicked
From her land
