So here I am, I'm a man
And that little boy tied down
Deep within me
You have broken your word!
I'm sorry that I bowed once again
And let the monsters loose
You can't understand it
Your can't understand what it's like
The world which we live in
Feel I'm tearing up inside
I'm loosing my mind

One look and the clown
In the mirror says
Hi -- I'm still here waiting
And tine is no longer on your side
A part of him dies
Another one lives in the mirror

And his legacy reigns
But I won't follow you
In the shadows I cry
Closer to heaven I fail

I still remember the words
That the little boy I once was, were told
Son, order rises from fear
Oh, how I swore I'd fight what he was
And I'd never be like him
I was such a fool
An ignorant fool to believe
A man can control
How he's living out his life
Or change anything

One look and the clown
In the mirror says
Hi -- I'm still here waiting
And time is no longer on you side
A part of him dies
Another one lives in the mirror

And his legacy reigns
But I won't follow you
In the shadows I cry
Closer to heaven I fail

So here I am, I'm a man in a cynical world filled
With compromises
A tyrant signs in the mirror
I know now I've been weak and afraid and turned
The other cheek
He knows I can't stand it. He knows I can't stand
That I am
A pawn in his puzzle
And still waiting in the wings, the ghost of my past

One look and the clown in the mirror says
Hi -- I'm still here waiting
And time is no longer on your side
A part of him dies
Another one lives in the mirror

And his legacy reigns, but I won't follow him
In the shadows I cry, alone
So close to heaven

[CHORUS]
And his legacy reigns
But I won't follow you
In the shadows I cry
Closer to heaven I fail
