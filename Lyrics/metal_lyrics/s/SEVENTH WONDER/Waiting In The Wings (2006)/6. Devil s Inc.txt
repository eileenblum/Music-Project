[Falling Down]

I will tell you how I failed
To be a good man
If you follow the flame
You end up in the dark
Coming up in a dream
Sitting up in the night
With a cold panic attack and a scream
Although it's hot
I'm feeling very cold inside
Although I am alive
I can not feel a thing
I wanna now why I
Really had to follow the tall man
To his office down underground
Call me dead heart walking

[In The Office]

Hey...no way! You don't have to be down
Don't you wanna make it better?
Sign right here! Said the Devil to the boy
And suck in the flavour, suck in the flavour
A favour is what I'm offering to you
Sign the document and take the
Favour. The one I'm offering to you
And suck in the flavour, suck in the flavour

Soul chasers on the move
Waiting for the kill
My future plan
I was sending it right down
To never land
The one who felt the fiend's hand
Will understand
That my ship will sink
It was written in devil's ink

[The Insight]

I'm sorry I turned my back on you
Don't know what to do
And why did I turn?
God how it burns
I'm covered in deep blue tonight
I'm sorry that I've turned
My back on you
I hope you do
Forgive me tonight

To live in this world
Is no longer my right
The cool morning breeze
Is no longer my right to feel
This face is yours to blame
For the bad I've done
So pass me down because I sold my soul

[The Crime]

To take a life worth living did not help at all
The money I came over they did not catch my fall

[Chorus]

[Remorse]

Now I know that I shed my tears
All those years
In vain will I die
Coming up in a dream
Sitting up in the night
With a cold panic attach and a scream
Although it's hot
I'm feeling very cold inside
And when I fall asleep
I have no happy dreams
I'm not man
I'm a puppet in a cage
Drinking darkness, eating sorrow
With a knife and a trident

[The Lie]

I met with the man with the magic eyes
He took me home just like a son
And made me believe in a paradise
The other one without a sun

[Chorus]

[The Fate Of A Murderer]

He never could and he never will
I will never show up in "Pleasantville"
He's gonna wake up where the time stand still
Just to find myself
Living in "the deadville" (the devil)
Soon his job beneath is to
Be a star of the show the devil hosts
And to never come back from his world
That would be the fear I fear the most
