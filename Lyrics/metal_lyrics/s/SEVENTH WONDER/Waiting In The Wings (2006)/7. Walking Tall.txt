It's only a matter of time
Before you loose it
And I once believed in fire

And tear me up!
Something burns inside of me

You mark my words, the game is up
And why did you have to show
That it's just a grand illusion?
Why did you ever let me go?
I'm asking you

Cause I'm walking tall
Marching down this shattered road
I've learned
Pain means alive
And I'm slowly breaking through
Without you

So come clench your fist
Round my heart and leave me bleeding
It's already ripped to pieces
Blackened on the ground

You game me scars that never heal
Oh why did you hurt me so
You pathetic little person
Just one more thing before you go
I'm telling you

[Chorus]
