He lured them in by lying
And made them greedy

To begin with I am sad
To begin with I am must as mad as you
Almost...
You see there's a difference between us
That won't go away 'til you're dead

My pretty dancer tell me
Are you alone inside your make-up
And the mask you're wearing
Slowly tearing you apart
Sing, do a final show for me
You're heavy at heart as can be
I know you're sad about it

Quick be on your way
To the sound of the army boots
You fall asleep so quietly
Maybe you will live another day
Soon they will find you and make you pay

Predators will hunt their prey
Send me on my way just to bleed
Cut you open for the cause to feed
Tell me a tale, the one about that girl
Who can dance away time
Move her feet like rain

His words are all the same lies
His words are greedy

Sing, do a final show for me
There's a tear in your eye I can see
That I'm not talking while you're singing

Quick be on your way
Disappear in the dark
Be a black shadow in the park, fade away
And try to live throughout the day
Soon they will find you and make you pay

You will follow
They will lead with minds of flesh
And blood and greed
Cut you open like a sack of seed
Tell me a tale
The one about that girl
Who can dance away time
Move her feet like rain

Predators will hunt their prey
Send me on my way just to bleed
Cut you open for the cause to feed
Tell me a tale, the one about that girl
Who can dance away time
Move her feet like rain

Cause I'm a soldier and you're a dancer
So I let you over
Sold!!!
