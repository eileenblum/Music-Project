Wonders... they happen every day
For sure, the fact is overwhelming me
In every land there are witnesses to tell a story
Fate decides what the future hides
I've read my own prewritten lines

And so time goes by and that is why
I know tomorrow will never come

You are watching the world
While she's falling to pieces
But still you smile
And every time your babies cry
You hold them tight
So tell me
Who is the fool when the curtains fall?
And the future is gone

Miracles
It helps you to see the world with different eyes
Suddenly you come to realize that time flies
And you have been a fool
So take your final breath
Feeling lonely with only yourself to blame

But fill your head with happy lies
Say a prayer
Under the tainted skies

Watching the world
While she's falling to pieces
But still you smile
And every time your babies cry, you hold them tight
So tell me, who is the fool when the curtains fall?
And the future is gone

You are watching the world
While she's falling to pieces
But still you smile
And every time your babies cry, you hold them tight
Tell me how do you sleep at night?
Tell me how do you sleep at night?
Tell me how do you sleep at night?
