A Northern corner
The stage is set and each must play his part
Accusing children:
"I have seen her fly!" -- the life-depriving lies

I'm sorry you must believe me
But we have seen you heal in evil ways
Deceiver!

Witches will burn
Even if she dies for a crime unknown
Taint the sky, ashes falling
And even if your heart is saying No
Your mind is so twisted
Can you really let her go?
Soon the heavens will burn

A stronger magic
To allow this jest reason is subdued
Accused and lying
Oh sure she will cry
Confession tears they are

I'm sorry, my life is over
And we will make the demons go away
Forever!
Witches will burn
Even if she dies for a crime unknown

Taint the sky, ashes falling
And even if your heart is saying No
Your mind is so twisted
Can you really let her go?
Soon the heavens will burn

A kingdom is burning
And will I ever know just why?
I see them burning on I see
It burns in me
They're burning us all

Witches will burn
Even if she died for a crime unknown
Tainted sky, shame is calling
And even if your heart is saying No
You can make a difference
Can I really? Yes, I know
Soon the sky in the fire will burn
