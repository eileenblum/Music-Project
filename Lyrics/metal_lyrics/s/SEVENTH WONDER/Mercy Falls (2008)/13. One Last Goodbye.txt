Don't want you to go, is there no other way?
I'll cherish this last kiss goodbye
I will care for all you leave behind
We won't let you go alone
But we have made a tragic decision,
Because your wounds won't heal
It's the final solution

[Chorus:]
When every day hurts
And tears keep on falling, we're letting you go
The shadows are calling
One last goodbye
We're all here beside you
Your soul will fade like a rose in the dark, but your memory remains

Night after night, living a dream
Finally feeling my blood again
The notes in that song
Kept my heart beating strong all the way
I can see clearly now
I'm tired of constantly sleeping
I will open my eyes again
So ready to live now

[Chorus]

[Doctor:] We have done everything to the human possible, but after all this time.

[Wife:] Are you sure? How can you be sure? You said that the surgery will..

[D:]
Yes, I have hoped so.
But this condition is severe enough to itself, and in a coma case patient, he simply can't fight it off, and frankly his brain hasn't been acting for a long time.
The bone marrow from your son was our last chance to break the coma.
And I have no any idea why his body rejected the transplant.
It should have worked, but it didn't.
But, and I stress this, the final decision will be yours, and yours alone.'

[Son:] Mommy, will Daddy rest now?

[W:] Yes honey, Daddy has to sleep now.... [to the doctor]) Do it.

"I'm flying high, aim for paradise
I'm hungry for life again
Oh, what a rush
Hold my family!
I'm never letting go!"

[Chorus]
