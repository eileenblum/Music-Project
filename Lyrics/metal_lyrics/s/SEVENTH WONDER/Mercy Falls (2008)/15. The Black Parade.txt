Don't you be your enemy
Set your heart and spirit free
Hard to see behind a wall of darkness
Let your open eyes for the first time
search and find the light
Hold on tight and never let go - don't let go

'Cause when time runs out
All your fears will be in vain
Love the ocean
The sun and the rain may dry out

So much more than meets the eye
Live your life until you die
Why waste one more day

Have the child's open minded spirit
Watching with blue eyes
Ready to take on the world
'Cause in time fate calls out to us:
Take your place in the black parade

You believe that you're free
Dance the devil's waltz and see...
All that evil needs to win,
Is for the good to do nothing
If we just sit idly by
The dark will rule the light
Being isn't living, brother
So don't let go...

'Cause when time runs out
All your fears will be in vain
Love the ocean
The sun and the rain may dry out

So much more than meets the eye
Live your life until you die
Don't you waste one more day in your life
Not one more day!

Have the child's open minded spirit
Watching with blue eyes
Ready to take on the world
'Cause in time fate calls out to us:
Take your place in the black parade
