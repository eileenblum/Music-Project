Quiet peaceful scene of chaos
A drifter's crying hopeful tears
Is this the place where I can rest?
And try to clear my dark clouded mind
(clouded mind)
What used to be an empty soul
In need of shelter from the cold
Has found serenity, and from day one he was told...

Unconditional love remains our burning flame
Hope our guiding light
And whenever you're breaking
Or if you feel misunderstood
We'll stand together and fight
Won't you read the sign boy!

No matter where you're from
This is your home
We're tearing down all the walls brother
It doesn't matter how far you've gone
Welcome to Mercy Falls
Where nobody's leaving

Heavy hearts from rain sometimes
But it's alright cause bear in mind
In the eye of Ike all safe and sound
Soon the sun will shine
Well... don't you stay... a broken man
Spread the word...enlighten them
Go find yourself in the crowd
We all have faith in you

Unconditional love remains our burning flame
Hope our guiding light
And whenever you're breaking
Or if you feel misunderstood
We'll stand together and fight
Won't you read the sign boy!

No matter where you're from
This is your home
We're tearing down all the walls brother
It doesn't matter how far you've gone
Welcome to Mercy Falls
A chance to find inner peace

No matter where you're from
This is your home
We're tearing down all the walls
Brother, stay here 'til your dying day
We invite you to Mercy Falls
Where the light keeps changing
