What's going on inside of you...
Still wondering
If my voice is reaching through to you...
First day of school today
And I was late
'Cause of the glass
By mama's bed
I think she's missing you

Miss Angel told us
Write some lines
About your families
I finish first...
I turned in blank...

Don't want to play
Another day without you
Oh - daddy
Open up your tired eyes
Want you to watch my games
And say you're proud of me
Want you to do what ever fathers do...

Today my best friend Tim and me
Stole apples from the Millhouse tree
Please don't tell...
I know you won't tell

If she finds out that I've been bad
She gets so sad and when she does
The muddy water helps her smile...
A while

But I won't cry
No I won't
I'll be strong, goodnight dad
I will turn the radio on
