Falling forsaken trough the dark
Tic-tock time is ticking backwards
Can't deny
Watching a man spawned from a kiss
Settle a coin toss for this odd loss

It's alright now they cannot hold me down
Blinded eyes open before us
- I just don't know why
That the two were gone forever in time
Open up my mind tonight
Open up my eyes

When destiny calls I'm a man
Who will rise above the fire
Paradise - waits forever
I won't apologize - from the shadows
I rise to her warm embrace

When love hurts...
I will always find a way to carry you
Since we have the truth

Bothering visions I can see
Left all alone inside this house
Of fear and night
Crying in the hallway on my knees...
Battling a stranger who will change her

I'm alright now but I can't figure out
The things I am feeling inside me

- I just had to cry
And the love survived
Through oceans of time
Not one of us will leave tonight
But only one will stay

When destiny calls I'm a man
Who will rise above the fire
In her eyes - destiny calls
I went beyond all lies - from the shadows
I rise to her loving face

Is there someone there I feel so scared
Playtime's over now
I open the door and sit by the age-old mirror

Raise my head and stare into
broken eyes of another

I have found myself
locked in the both of them
Hear me now,
I'm throwing my bonds away!
Throwing all my bonds away!
