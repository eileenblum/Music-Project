Wasted life I'm tired
Breathe life in to mine, Father
My spirit caught in this hell
The blood in my veins
Oh - wanna escape me
Desperation come
Wanting me to fall, Father...

The weight of my words denied
Despise me and loath my face
Will you force another year for us in paradise?
Another tear in "paradise"...

They say the world is an open road
"Just let go and you will see"

I won't care anyway
Turn the lights
I will never be free again
Turn away baby
Forever I am gone

"Face all, climb up higher"
I smell their little lies, Father
You cannot turn me around,
My life and my ways
Oh - tell me the white lie
Vindication
For never wanting
To be a part of...

... a world made of
Empty words
No chance for the
Honest man
I will feast on all
Your tears
Above your paradise
A lonely face will terrorize...

So tell the world of this horrible dame
And how she let go of her life

I won't care anyway
Turn the lights
I will never be free again
Turn away baby
Forever I am gone
I won't care anyway
Turn the lights
I will never be free again
Turn away baby
Forever I am gone
