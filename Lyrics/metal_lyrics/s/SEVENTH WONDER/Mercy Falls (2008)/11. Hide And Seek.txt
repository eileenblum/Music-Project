Beyond true common sense
A silhouette of all they know
A riddle on the kitchen table
Alone yet in the best of company
This game is not for everyone
Like hide and seek but not as fun
Two hearts in the search for
What? God only knows...
Will it finally show?

So confusing... Am I insane?
This old widow plays tricks with my brain
I can feel her pain, running through my veins
A feeling I cannot explain...

I wanna know about the fire
And every time I look at her
I see myself somehow
In my heart a strong desire
What's really going on?
I wanna know!

Behind the polished barrier
The pending storm draws near
Although it's an inferno
You can not step back for your fears
Hurry son I need to rest
finish the puzzle you do it best
I'll do what I can
But I am telling you
It can't be done without you!

So confusing is this for real?
Not a clue of what it is I feel
I can sense the joy
From this little boy
The hole in my soul starts to heal

I wanna know about the fire
And every time I look at her
I see myself somehow
In my heart a strong desire
What's really going on?
I wanna know!

I wonder... is my blood still mine
Can't see if this life's still mine
I fear I'm going under, I don't know
If my soul's still mine, I wanna know
Just got to know
The closure is near...

I wanna know about the fire
And every time I look at her
I see myself somehow
In my heart a strong desire
What's really going on?
I wanna know!

(That's the last piece...)
