If this is the future, then what have we done?
(If this is the future, what have we done?)
If you think a few teardrops will save you, then you're not the only one
What if maybe just maybe the promise that God made to man...
What if maybe that promise was broken cause we'll never ever understand

That the higher we climb up,
the harder we fall
When the world we know
burns to the ground
May the tears on your cheek
make a promise of hope
one last time
I'm lost in the rain
but I know that I will...
I know that I will survive

When the world is falling
before a king without a crown
Nothing lasts forever but
tonight is your night
Hear the siren calling
for the man behind the clown
Drop your mask and ask the question, why?
Why we were left here to die?

I can't take it!
I'll never make it!
Any change is hard to make
Every mountain side too steep
each valley way too deep
You're an immortal man
In an immoral world
Lying yourself to sleep
'Cause in all honesty reality is more than just counting sheep
As you're a born survivor
on a never-ending path
You're a part of a beginning while
in the aftermath
And it's a fake empire
it's a castle made of sand
And if you only could make it to the other side
I would make you understand

That the higher we climb up,
the harder we fall
When the world we know
burns to the ground
May the tears on your cheek
make a promise of hope
one last time
I'm lost in the rain
but I know that I will...
I know that I will survive

When the world is falling,
before a king without a crown,
nothing lasts forever but
tonight is your night
Hear the siren calling
for the man behind the clown
Take it as promise cause I know
We will survive
We will survive...

I feel the wind hit my face
Naked I stand reborn
I'll never join the rat race
Fight or flight will be no more
I cannot change my past but
I will rewrite what is to come
No...

Now the world is falling
as we are kneeling down
The world is falling
before a king without a crown
And sirens are calling
for the man behind the clown

When the world is falling
before a king without a crown
nothing lasts forever but
tonight is your night
Hear the siren calling
for the man behind the clown
Drop your mask and ask the question, why?
Why the world is falling
before a king without a crown
Nothing lasts forever
but tonight...
We'll hear the siren calling
for the man behind the clown
Take it as promise cause I know
we will survive!
