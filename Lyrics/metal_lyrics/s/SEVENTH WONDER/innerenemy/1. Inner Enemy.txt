For a man that never prayed upon salvation
It's quiet when the world is breaking down
But when the neon light is calling
Gotta search for one more fix
A rat race for a man-made crown

Please... Help me! Help me, somebody...
My heart is open wide!
Save me and just maybe I'll survive...

You gotta get up and go...
Hey!
Tonight is the night
I'm gonna face my inner enemy!
Get up because
Hey!
This is your life
And it's time to kill your inner enemy...

Cause we are pushing through as flashing lights go by us
Our good intentions pave the way for greed
So we are running through an endless maze
A wicked society
With smoke and mirrors, ecstasy...

Please... Help me! Help me, somebody...
My heart is on the line!
Save me and just maybe I'll survive...

[Chorus]

Not gonna make it on your own
Trying to fly
But you keep falling like angels to the ground
You brought the world to its knees
And forced us to rise
To kill the limelight that blinded your eyes

[Chorus]

I'm gonna give myself
One fighting chance
To face my inner enemy
Get up because
One too many have died
And it's time to kill your inner enemy...
