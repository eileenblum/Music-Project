Your waiting is over for now
The damage is done
The will to resist You has gone
Enter nightfall

The moon watches over the world
Blind to the eye
That's still looking over what's mine
In the twilight

Walking through the door
The light so cold
It strikes my back and chills this

Blood that sees me through
Until I sleep, with You behind my eyes

I'll be there
I'll be Your own
I'll be Your temple in the storm
With every word and every day
In a world of many

The streetlight is calling my name
The game has begun
You stand in its spotlight so run
I'm behind You

You smile at the world as I hide
With tears in my eyes
By now You must know my surprise
Is inside You

Nothing feels the same
I feel the shame for what I've done to You

I'll be there
I'll be Your own
I'll be Your temple in the storm
With every word and every day
In a world of many cares
