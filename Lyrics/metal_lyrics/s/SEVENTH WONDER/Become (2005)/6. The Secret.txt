How I want to tell You
Of man and god
Still we pray and send him up
A fallen lie

I find I'm looking back to
Days gone by
To a time before every day
Was night

You cannot live forever
My time is now
The gold You seek to gather
Is mine to own

The secret
Still living
Has fallen into foreign hands
Deciding every day You live

And so humanity will fall
Before our eyes
Too sundered to remember
The ancient rites

Oh, have I lived to see
The end of time
The prayer that dies with my last breath
Is only mine
You cannot live forever
My time is now
Although You stay together
You die alone

Still breathing
Still seething
The mournful eye upon Your face
Follow me to Your dying day
