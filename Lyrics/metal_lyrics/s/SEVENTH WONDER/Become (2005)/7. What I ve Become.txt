Through the darkness, spawned in terror
winds that try and catch the sun
now and forever
Void of feeling, roaming freely
Spires arise to shame the sky

What do I feel, Oh my lord make me free of their blame

Dream my child as though it were real
And I'll join you
And in the dawn awoken I will see
What I've become

Souls are harnessed eyes dishonest
Moon and star behind their shield
In the cradle children laden

From this ordeal, oh my god can they ever be spared?

Dream my child as though it were real
And I'll join you
And in the dawn awoken I will see
What I've become

Thoughts are playing wills are swaying
Rearranging words of lore
stronger than ever
Fear annealing hatred reeling
Realize the time is near

I rise from my knees for no god made me free all these years

Dream my child as though it were real
And I'll join you
And in the dawn awoken I will see
What have I done?
