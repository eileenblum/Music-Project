I cannot look back
memories I lack of my yesterday
As I serve the shame
Nothing left to blame tears fill my eyes

Caught in this pain I'm feeling
Pouring rain hits my face
Stay on this course we've plotted
Trust in fate will guide me home

I live day by day, alone
still trying to find my way home
I try to heal these wounds I've made
trying but can't 'cause I'm still so afraid

Lost inside of me
Drifting in the sea, no beacon no light
guides me on my way
so again I stray -why have you lied?

Thought I was safe from feeling
weights of stories both past and foretold
Seasons of manic dreaming
Lust and hate, these things unfold

I live day by day, alone
still trying to find my way home
I try to heal these wounds I've made
trying but can't cause I'm still so afraid
