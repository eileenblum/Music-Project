When silence
It falls before my eyes
No light
In darkest night

My mind it
Dreams of those who fall asleep
This life
This quiet plight

You can hear me cry
Can I stand to ask You why

You have cast me into night
Neverending distant light

So I surrender to You my life
Lost in the blink of an eye
I have lived a million times
Cried, tried to awake every night

Daydreamers
Send me into the sky
On wings
Of hope and love

Night screamers
Oh, I look into the rain
And stare
At fires above

Tame my pain, let them fray my eyes
