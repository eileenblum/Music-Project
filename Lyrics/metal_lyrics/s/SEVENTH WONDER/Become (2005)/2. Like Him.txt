Born into this world one day
The heir to a tyrant's reign of pain

Indoctrinate
To rule with hate
For the son to feel pride
By his father's side

Forcefed views
Mental abuse
What goodness creates
He devastates

From the pits of darkness rises a light astray
Filling the void that terror employed

Change came to the boy on a street
A girl dressed in rags taught him to see

There is no escape
No passing of judgment
Your people are dying and so am I

She drew her final breath
And died in his arms and
He shouts out to the sky
I won't be like him

Under blood red skies a flicker of hope and love
An echoing song to right all the wrong

I won't be like him
