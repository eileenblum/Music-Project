Render a sight late in the night and carry the story in time
With our fate stayed on your mind
To carry the price of solemn advice
To cherish and pray for a roll of the dice
And to bear truth to his sign

Morrow wind, herald of sorrow
Bless this sleeping kind
Across the plains the winds of tomorrow
Bear with them a tainted soul

Here are the damned awaiting the living
The bringer of war, the dawn is no more
To carry the strife with the way of the sword

From coast to coast, from land to land
Tearing in twain on the weakest of strands
and I know, nowhere to go

The sky is dark, the clockwork is turning
As the sun goes down
And all around the crosses are burning
And with them our last best hope

Here are the damned awaiting the living
The bringer of war, the dawn is no more
To carry the strife with the way of the sword

Over the fields slain to a man
destiny played on the weakest of hands
and the poor souls made to burn

And on these grounds the power the wicked
Bear within has gained control

Here are the damned awaiting the living
The bringer of war, the dawn is no more
To carry the strife with the way of the sword
Free of the sand never forgiving
Always on guard it's gone too far
Here there be dragons and here are the damned
