Sunrise blinding my eyes
Riding on the wind

Down, down, down
Oppression is holding us down
Tied to the ground
Shackled and chained we are bound

See how you've broken
The will of all these men
The spirits are choking
But hope will always remain

Sunrise blinding my eyes
Riding on the wind
I'm sick of this, sick of this fighting
Life like animals

Pound, pound, pound
Grinding them into the ground
Keeping them blind
In darkness ever confined

Revel in terror
Revel in pain
Our spirits are choking
But hope will never refrain

Sunrise blinding my eyes
Riding on the wind
I'm sick of this, sick of this fighting
Life like animals

Die, die, die
The forgers of this evil lie
The yoke cast aside
Breaking the chains Freedom cry

No we are rising, reach for the sky

Sunrise kissing my eyes
Riding on the wind
I'm free from this, free from this fighting
Free like animals
Beauty reflecting the sunlight
Mountains crowned with snow
I marvel at valleys in bloom
Stand in awe of mother earth
