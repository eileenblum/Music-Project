Evil, world evil.
Fine, black evil, cross in silence
Evil, black evil, name of evil.
In darkness sky
In bloody night.
You are knowing
What flies on wild wings
Of the spirit world
And it hide
Cold, cold water washed skulls
Of enemies, into the void...
Evil... evil dance, dance of darkness
And flame of wheels
...of forgotten God,
and the simbol angel's war.
Golden haired stars
From the light sou and dark
Evil... dance
Hand, open my way.
Angel dies!
