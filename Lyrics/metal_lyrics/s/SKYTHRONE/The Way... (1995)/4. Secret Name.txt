Ice, sky...
The flight of noght
In sorrow, my stranger
In darkness my angel
My tears of suffering
Black destiny, lost kingdom.
In darkness..., in fire,
And eternal wind of black storm
In my dark hands
That sky...
And put mine destiny
This sign of secret name
My pain, blind rain...
We'll back
In sweetness of black
