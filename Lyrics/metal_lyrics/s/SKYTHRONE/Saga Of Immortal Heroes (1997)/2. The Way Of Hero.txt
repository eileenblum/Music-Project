Cloudberry Spring came to our Land.
Perun, Yarila and Svarog are returning to
their Heaven Realm. On the Way of Heroes
unholy enemy of South Mountains... Gods
of the Sun with Fire Swords got off children
of the Night. People are laughing. Power of
Paganism is wan! We will drink hot honeys
for Glory of Russian War Gods. Cloudberry
Spring came to our Land. And Ice Giants
are dying, and Goddess of Winter her
place, in the vain hope to return her
youth... I believe... Cloudberry rainbow will
rise on the Way of Hero. I believe... Power
of Paganism is wan on the Way of Hero. I
believe in the Russian Gods! I believe in the
Russian Sky!
