One in our waistband.
One in our right hand.
We are coming out shooting.
One in the torso.
One through the forehead.
We are coming out shooting.

You can't mess with us and leave with your life.
We are the last thing you'll see tonight.
You think I'm playing go on and test me.
You are the enemy.
You are the enemy.

These are my streets, this is my home.
This is the only way I have ever known.
You are on the wrong side, better watch your tone.

One in our waistband.
One in our right hand.
We are coming out shooting.
One in the torso.
One through the forehead.
We are coming out shooting.

I will rip a star, right through your heart.
I have no sympathy for a lesser man.
You are the sick, you are the twisted.
You are nothing but misery.
One loss one casualty makes the world a better place.
One loss one casualty makes the world a better place.

You are on the wrong side, better watch your tone.
Your lack of will disgusts me your lethargy makes me sick.
Your morals make you unfit.

One in our waistband.
One in our right hand.
We are coming out shooting.
One in the torso.
One through the forehead.
We are coming out shooting.
One for the chosen, one for the damned.
