It won't be long till I come back, a week I swear.
We are a challenge that I am willing to take.
You are a promise that I will not break.
You are a commitment that I will make.

What have you done, how could you make.
This body of mine tremble and shake.
Never have I dreamt to feel this way.
The light passed the windows now I must wake.
What have I done, how could I have fallen this way.
Ground came rushing up to meet my face.
This has happened all so fast, that I cannot deny.
All these thoughts I have inside.

It won't be long till I come back, a week I swear.
We are a challenge that I am willing to take.
You are a promise that I will not break.
You are a commitment that I will make.

Is this a dream or illusion.
I have the same one every night.
You are lying here right by my side.
This pain haunts me, I wish you were here.
When I close my eyes I see you fucking clear.
When I close my eyes I see you fucking clear.
When I close my eyes.

This pain haunts me.
I wish you were here.
When I close my eyes
Early mornings and late nights.
Please please don't cry.

This is see you later.
I'm not saying goodbye.
