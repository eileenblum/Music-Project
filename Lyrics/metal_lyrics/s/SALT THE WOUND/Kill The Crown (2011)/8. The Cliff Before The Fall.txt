I mean no disrespect.
How can you say what you did.
This is all so soon.
For me its been a long time coming.
And I can't stop running.

This train won't stop running.
Although the fuel tank is empty.
How can I keep going with this brick wall in front of me.
I guess its just sheer will.
And I'll keep moving on.
With one foot out the door I'm already gone.
This is the cliff before the fall.
My legs won't stop moving.
The thoughts just keep dancing.
I am drawn to this light.
I have made my choice.
I have made my amends.

I mean no disrespect.
How can you say what you did.
This is all so soon.
The stars tonight remind me of what we used to have.
Every now and again I can feel its back.

Let's get one thing straight.
You mean nothing.
Let's get one thing straight.
You don't exist.

Turn and walk away.
That is the only way that you will survive.
Just leave this place in fucking flames.
You can't say I never tried.
Once is enough.
