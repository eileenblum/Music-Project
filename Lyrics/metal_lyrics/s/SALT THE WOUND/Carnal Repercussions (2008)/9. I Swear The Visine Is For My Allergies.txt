You're poison, and I'm taking you in.
With every breath I'm dying.
I'm dead.

And I hope it does.
Because it took away two years.
And possibly the rest of your life.

And I'm not sorry, cause this is the path that I choose.
I know you're not sorry for what your future holds.
Cause the path that I walk is straight and narrow.

Was there a reason for your leaving?
And I'll take them out back.
Leave them, you don't need them in your...
Take them out back, leave them.
You don't need them in your life.

And I'm not sorry, cause this is the path that I choose.
I know you're not sorry for what your future holds.
Cause the path that I walk is straight and narrow.

So look at me through your bloodshot eyes, through your eyes
So look at me through your bloodshot eyes.
Do I look as beautiful as I did that night?

And I'm not sorry, cause this is the path that I choose.
I know you're not sorry for what your future holds.
Cause the path that I walk is straight and narrow.

Welcome to the world you've chosen.

Was there a reason for your leaving?
And I know, take them out back.
Leave them, you don't need them in your...
Take them out back, leave them.
You don't need them in your life.
