I've left this room.
As the smoke clears, it seems so have you.
But you will always be near.
And when I return into your arms, I will run.
I've be gone, I have been gone.

There has to be meaning behind every word and phrase.
Dig deep enough and surely it will see the light of day.
There has to be meaning behind every word and phrase.
Dig deep enough and surely it will see the light of day.

You've got to let go of the ones you truly love.
And if they come back, then you know they're yours.

So let this be a lesson that distance is no home wrecker.
If we can survive this, then anything is possible.

And I will stick with the ones who are by my side.
I have always had their back, and I know (know) they'll have mine.
We've been through thick and thin.
The worst of times.

I've left this room.
And as the smoke clears, it seems so have you.
But I'll always be near.

And when I return into your arms, I will run.
I've been gone, I have been gone.

But that's OK cause I'm still going strong.
And I ended up with the ones who really care.
And that's OK cause I'm still moving on.
And I ended up with the ones who really care.
Who really cares.

And we're gonna keep our eyes clear and our noses clean.

I've left this room as the smoke clears.
I'd hope so had you,
But I guess, makes two of us that knew.
You wouldn't make it through.
