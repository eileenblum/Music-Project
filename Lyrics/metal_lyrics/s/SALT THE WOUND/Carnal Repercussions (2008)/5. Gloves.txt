You know what I hate?
When I'm awake and dreaming.

Pry this wish from my cold dead hands.
My lifeless body will point you in the right direction.
As my cold gray eyes stair you down and you explode.

Cause I'm awake and dreaming.
Usually I'm dead and sleeping.
Or I'm alive not breathing.
Or I'm on mute not talking to you.

Pry this wish from my cold dead hands.
My lifeless body will point you in the right direction.
As my cold gray eyes

When I'm awake and dreaming.
When life has lost all meaning.
When My nerves continue to stop feeling.
My only comfort are these gloves.

When I'm awake and breathing.
When life has lost all meaning.
When My nerves continue to stop feeling.
My only comfort are these gloves.

I thought I was so smart.
I thought that I was getting ahead.
Well it turns out.
I had yet to start.

Cause I'm awake and dreaming.
Usually I'm dead and sleeping.
