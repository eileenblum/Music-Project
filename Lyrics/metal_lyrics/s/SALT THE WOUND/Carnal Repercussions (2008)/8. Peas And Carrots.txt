You're eyes have burned a hole right through my heart.
I don't know if I will survive.
And the sunrise.
With everything said in your eyes.
This sunrise, this sunrise.

You're eyes have burned a hole right through my heart.
I don't know if I will survive.
And the sunrise.
With everything said in your eyes.
This sunrise, this sunrise.

Tell them, tell them all that I'm dead.
Tell her that she's won.
Tell them, tell them all that I'm dead.

You're eyes have burned a hole right through my heart.
And I...

Don't tell me you love me.
If these words you say aren't true.
And if they are.
How can I ever trust you.
You've lied before.
You've lied so many times.
You've lied before.
And you're lying tonight.

It's alright, it's alright.

I hope to hear from you soon.
And I know you won't let me down.
We've been through so much together.
It'd be a shame if you gave up now.

I hope to hear from you soon.
And I know you won't let me down.
We've been through so much together.
It'd be a shame if you gave up now.
