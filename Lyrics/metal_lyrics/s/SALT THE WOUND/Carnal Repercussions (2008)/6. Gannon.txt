The coldest winter months.
You will keep me warm.
This will run through.
Until forever as I have kept.
All those nights.
I have wept.
I'm drowning in pools that don't even exist.

Slight of the hand and a twist of the wrist.
This is bigger than you or me.
Slight of the hand and a twist of the wrist.
This is bigger than you or me.

Tell me you love me.
Tell me you love me.
Tell me you love me.
Tell me you love me.
Tell me you love me.
Tell me you love me.
Tell me you love me.
Tell me you love me.
