We'll brake out of prison.
We'll swim the moat to safety.
The stars fall around me.
To guide my way.
The path that I lead.
Is it worth it?
Again if I stop I will fail.
The words constantly haunt me.
My body is much to frail.

Is it what I've waited for.
Why am I so scared?

Sleepless night and hunger.
Couldn't be farther from my mind.
Yet each day my body screams enough, enough.
What has become of my faith.
I have tried this way of living.
I have tried this way of living.
And it doesn't seem to be working.

The path that I lead.
Is it worth it?
Again if I stop I will fail.
The words constantly haunt me.
My body is much to frail.

This is harder than it looks but,
This pavement calls my name.
And I have to go where I'm needed the most.

I have slept at 80 miles and hour for way to long.
I need some peace.
I need some sleep.

This is what I've waited for.
Why am I so scared.
