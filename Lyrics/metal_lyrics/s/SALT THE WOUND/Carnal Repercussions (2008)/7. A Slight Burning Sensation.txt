Am I just some kid you went to high school with?
Or am I the love of your life?
Pour some hot sauce on me baby.
Because I could go all night.

Do you want it slow?
Do you want it deep?
Baby let me know.
Cause I'm here for you.

Am I just some kid you went to high school with?
Or am I your biggest mistake?
That look in your eyes is so disheartening.
When usually you smile at me with those pearly whites.

You were always there, when I was down.
To pick me up.
From off the ground.
And for that I thank you.

You were always there, when I was down.
