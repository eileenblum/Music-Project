This is the end, for forcefully violated reminders of you, condemned to serve you.
We have given up, thankful and untrue cheers to what we've been through.
Chances were you couldn't make it although things fell to pieces.
The worlds been held in stasis, the worlds been held in stasis.
This is the end, for forcefully violated reminders of you, condemned to serve you.
We have given up, thankful and untrue cheers to what we've been through.

"Your hope is lost somewhere in the skies flames engulf our cities, building this scene was always more difficult than tearing it down." [3x]

And you thought that with all the money in this world perhaps things could change, perhaps you thought too hard.
And you I thought that with all the money in this world.
