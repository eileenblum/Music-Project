Who drew first, when they're gone, still working on perfect nothing to do, except run your mouth, hold that tongue before it's ripped from your throat.
How about looking in the mirror, before stating opinions a well placed knife to the back although he's not around. [2x]
Proud to be the center of your conversations, get a fucking life.
Saddest still how we become the topic, stay in small spaces with unopened minds.
Steady, we're still growing, this must be how you want your name thrown about.
Keep it to yourself; gossiping about fiction is pathetic.
You're a fairytale not even close to the facts even more difficult to read.
You still don't know the truth, how I can't put my heart in this.
Destroy the world. [2x]
Let's gamble our debts horrible events are inevitable, half way to the top why quit.
You're a fairytale not even close to the facts even more difficult to read.
You still don't know the truth, how I can't put my heart in this.
Keep it to yourself, not understanding me, still underestimating me.
