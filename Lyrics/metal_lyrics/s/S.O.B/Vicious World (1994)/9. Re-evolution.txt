What do you draw?
What do you believe?
You project into your vision?
What do you choose?
Can you find what you're lookin' for?
What does your future hold?

Believing our higher selfpower

We're gonna make progress,
Adopting various things
We're gonna spiral up,
Our dreams are gradually coming true

Believing our higher selfpower

All right
The future we create
Holds no rules
You bet
Don't talk about the basics
Make the choice for yourself

Why don't you rush out of your jail
And pursue the way you should go?

Believing our higher selfpower

What do you draw?
What do you believe?
You project into your vision?
What do you choose?
Can you find what you're lookin' for?
What does your future hold?

Believing our higher selfpower
