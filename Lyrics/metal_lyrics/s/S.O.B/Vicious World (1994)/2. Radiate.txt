Your perception might give rise to marvelous things
I cannot stand seeing boring stereotypes!
The key is to strike while the iron is hot

Radiate the light of hope
Radiate my dreams in tact

What you need is well-matched knowledge and sense
So many men, so many minds
They key is how to utilize your self

Radiate the light of hope
Radiate my dreams in tact

My eyes are spinning with eagerness
Let my dreams and hope stay mine forever!

Radiate the light of hope
Radiate my dreams in tact

My minds are operating at full swing
Let my dreams and hope stay mine forever!
