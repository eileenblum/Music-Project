Existence
Nothing changes
You'll never try to change

Unconsciousness
Unawareness
Senseless conformism

You're an outstanding quibbler
Your knowledge and lies
Only serve to make you look great
There's no progress in yourself

I know you're a betrayer and
Green-eyes with jealousy
Why? 'Cause I know the nasty way you do it

You're an outstanding quibbler
Your knowledge and lies
Only serve to make you look great
There's no progress in yourself

I know you're a betrayer and
Green-eyes with jealousy
Why? 'Cause I know the nasty way you do it

You'll never be able to deceive me
'Cause I won't forget the pains of the past

You'll never be able to deceive me
'Cause I won't forget the pains of the past
