Dilapidation of our land
Personal interests
Environmental contamination
Seeking for contradictions again

Where are we going? Human prey!

The place of so-existence
In harmany with nature
Human greed
The balance is being loosed

Where are we going? Human prey!

Our relation to nature
Thoughtless destruction
Threatening our life
The path to extermination

Where are we going? Human prey!

The rapidity of civilization
Will overthrow our Earth
