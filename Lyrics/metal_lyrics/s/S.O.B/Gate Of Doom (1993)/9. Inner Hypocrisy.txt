Too much hypocrisy surrounds us
A touch-and-go-situation
Everything's over

Do we hate each other unconsciously?

Malicious intentions to shove others aside
Defamation and antagonism hidden behind
Where on Earth is our interdependence?

Do we hate each other unconsciously?

Gossip-loving fellows are always
Faultfinding,
Which has been getting out of hand

They're coming one after another

What the hell is going on?
Without regard to each other,
No real harmony would arise
They sponge us off for what we've got

What the hell is going on?
Without regard to each other,
No real harmony would arise
They sponge us off for what we've got

Too much hypocrisy surrounds us
A touch-and-go-situation
Everything's over

Do we hate each other unconsciously?
