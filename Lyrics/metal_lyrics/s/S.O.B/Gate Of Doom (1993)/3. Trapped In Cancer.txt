Their power
Their conspiracy
Their rule
Kick the bucket

This world is depraved and confused
Everybody wanna have their own way

Their emotion
Their haughtiness
Their logic
What have they realized?

This world is depraved and confused
Everybody wanna have their own way

Are they thinking of themselves
As almighty God?

They make arrangements to suit their convenience
With a value to judgement of their own

Nothing would be settled down
Who's laugh in the final round?

Their power
Their conspiracy
Their rule
Kick the bucket

This world is depraved and confused
Everybody wanna have their own way

They make arrangements to suit their convenience
With a value to judgement of their own
