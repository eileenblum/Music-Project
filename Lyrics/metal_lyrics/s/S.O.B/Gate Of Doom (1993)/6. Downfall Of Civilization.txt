Open your eyes to find yourself
Bound to the crucifix
Break down the present situation
The idealism you advocate is
Just an example

The ideal you followed is an illusion
Inexhaustible pains in your lofty dreams
The structure of reality under supervision
There are no bounds to pyramiding

The meshes of a stretched net
The present world
Far beyond
Downfall of civilization

Open your eyes to find yourself
Bound to the crucifix
Break down the present situation
The idealism you advocate is
Just an example

The ideal you followed is an illusion
Inexhaustible pains in your lofty dreams
The structure of reality under supervision
There are no bounds to pyramiding

The meshes of a stretched net
The present world
Far beyond
Downfall of civilization

Automated daily life
Unreachable eternity
Crushed hours
A hell on Earth
