Human species vacillating in, confusion
Human species drowned in avarice

The sin you've created?

The sin we've committed,
Or the felony you've assigned to us?

The world's inconsistency
And human lies
Obliged to atone for these sins?

The sin you've created?

The sin we've committed,
Or the felony you've assigned to us?

Idol worship, your voice never carries
The world you've created as a
Warning for the future?

Human species vacillating in, confusion
Human species drowned in avarice

The sin you've created?

Sometimes in heaven, sometimes in hell
I cannot tell which is which
