Dragged into the dark world
I cannot tell reality from illusion
Impossible to abandon my reason for being
I confine myself to the narrow-minded views

Mind empty of happiness

Empty space
Trivial existence
A delusion spreading endlessly
Stranged in reality
I drive myself to the end of my life

Mind empty of happiness

Despair that cannot be wiped off
A confused circuit of thinking
I'll overcome my fear
And seek for the comfort of my mind

Endless eternity
I can neither live nor die
The world of darkness
Will I have to live forever?

Mind empty of happiness
Mind empty of happiness
