Here we are
Face to face
It's so cold, I can't breathe
Angry
I'm the one
Who will fight all this pain
It won't leave me

I can't look
In your eyes
Without hurting myself
I'll fight
But I'm scared
To face the dark side of me

It's time to change
And break these awful rules
To sail away from you

I will be strong
When I don't look down upon you
I won't escape today
I'll stand my ground
And I'll take you up so high
And you'll suffer defeat
Until your end

Here we are
Face to face
You won't get rid of me
I won't surrender
To the games of your mind
I will be safe

By myself
Laying the blame on you!
Trying to prevail
In vain
You are here
In the dark side of me

Is this our last goodbye?
I won't miss you, don't wonder why

I can't fail now
Cease your hunt, leave me alone
'cause you can't hurt me anymore
The sun shall rise at last
No shadow of you in it

Non sfidare la notte
La paura che hai dentro
E' il tuo rifugio
Non lasciarlo!
Non sfidare la notte
La paura che hai dentro
Il bagliore de sole ti accechera

Non sfidare la notte
La paura che hai dentro
E' il tuo rifugio
Il buio e' dentro te
Insieme a te
Il bagliore del sole ha ferito il mio cuore
Et lux fuit

I was so strong
I didn't look down upon you
I chose to stay that day
I stood my ground
And I took you up so high
And you suffered defeat
It's your end
