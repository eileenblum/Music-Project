All the pain I've born
Reminds me of what I've done
Here the world is dark
Inside my eyes
No more will to cry
This land is full of whispers
And I wonder why I've lost my way home

Look back and see
Where the light is bleeding

The silent storm over me
Is breaking my dreams
And the rains fall down
My tears run though the leaves
The bleeding darkness in me
Is tying my feet
And I can't go on
I'm lost in the deep

There is no more time
Darkness covers my life
I can't tell anymore
What's wrong and what's right
Only dust can't hide
The change I wish in my heart
And the thoughts are lost
They cry out too loud

Look back and see
Where the light is bleeding

The silent storm over me
Is breaking my dreams
And the rains fall down
My tears run though the leaves
The bleeding darkness in me
Is tying my feet
And I can't go on
I'm lost in the deep

I'm so close to the edge
The void seems to call me
I won't fall down

I don't know what's wrong
But look at me now, somehow
Feeling the light and trusting
It's not all in vain, by now
A burning fire is growing
And warming my mind
I shout!
Then look back and see
All your darkest fears

The silent storm over me
Is breaking my dreams
And the rains fall down
My tears run though the leaves
The bleeding darkness in me
Is tying my feet
And I can't go on
I'm lost in the deep
