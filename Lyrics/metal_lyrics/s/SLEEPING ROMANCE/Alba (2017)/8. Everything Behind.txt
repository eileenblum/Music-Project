This is how I lived
I felt less guilt, innocent
I would like to thank my life
For being so hard with me
'Cause I was weak
Always asking to be saved
You tricked me once, life
You're showing your deceit

I know I'm getting older
Now I can fight on my own

The only path among this field
Is scattered with stones
I won't forget the lesson I've learned:
"Hit the road and walk alone!"
The river carries away all my sins
Nothing remains still
I cannot step twice into the stream
Hit the road and leave everything behind

I will be the key
To free myself from my own tears
Heart don't be a liar
I can keep my mind clearer

I've wondered
I've cried
The sorrow I've forsaken
I've suffered
I've shouted
It's time to shed my skin
I've wondered
I've cried
The sorrow I've forsaken
I've suffered
I've shouted
I'll be reborn in silence
