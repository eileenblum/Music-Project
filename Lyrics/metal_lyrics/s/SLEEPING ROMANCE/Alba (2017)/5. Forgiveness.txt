I know your ordeal
But you can't conceal yourself
Beneath a distorted mask
Made of revenge
There's always a choice
It's been a while
You should have been my guide
Now I want to close the door
But you still attack my senses
Leave my world

Don't make me wonder
If I can be free from your memory
I'm feeling hopeless
We were so close but in my thoughts
You're still a sinner
Don't make me wonder
If I can be free from the state I'm in
You'll ask forgiveness
But I can only try to be indifferent

Your heart is cold
You can't deny the way it is
Our past has changed us all
And I see nothing but ice
In your eyes

Please give me an answer
Or I'll be lost in my anger

Silence, I cannot speak again for us both
Be strong, speak!
Darkness is taking control of your soul
Be strong, rise!
Height won't be such a danger
If you don't fall again
Breathe!
