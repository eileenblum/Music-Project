Get out of my cloudy mind
Whispers I can't ignore
I'm blinded by all these voices
They won't leave me alone

Be strong close to the edge
I'm lost within all this noise
Will I lose my desire to sleep again

Feel the temptation
Reach the unbreakable feelings and
I have never thought
Look at the void and loose sight
Hear this my obsession
Fearful of losing my inner wish
Now I'll take a chance
I won't look back this is the end

Shadows clouding my senses
But I see clearly my price
I'll find a throne in this wasteland
I will rise

Light is on my path
My fear is still the same
It's quiet now
But I'll pay for this
And

Feel the temptation
Reach the unbreakable feelings and
I have never thought
Look at the void and loose sight
Hear this my obsession
Fearful of losing my inner wish
Now I'll take a chance
I won't look back this is the end

Hear the night it calls
Inside me I will be
Free from all pain

Feel the temptation
Reach the unbreakable feelings and
I have never thought
Look at the void and loose sight
Hear this my obsession
Fearful of losing my inner wish
Now I'll take a chance
I won't look back this is the end

Please don't choose you want feel
Don't watch it
More pain inside
Don't trust it
You won't leave
Don't choose it
You have made
Don't watch it
Don't trust it
Your choice
It's your fate
Your fate
