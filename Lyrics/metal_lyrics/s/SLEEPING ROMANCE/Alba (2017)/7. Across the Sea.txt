Nothing for me
In this kingdom I'm alone
The queen of ruins and stones
I've betrayed my belief
Looking for another deal
A lesson I have to learn

My ship sails
I follow my course
But I've lost my bearings in life
My own pride has become a curse
I search for a light across the sea

I've failed this time
I didn't fight against the tide
Triumph became defeat
What did I believe?
The throne gave me no relief
My wishes are far from here

No one is asking me why
Even the stars are silent
No one knows what I feel
And what my soul conceals

My ship sails
I follow my course
But I've lost my bearings in life
My own pride has become a curse
But I will find a light that's so bright
The sun shines again
