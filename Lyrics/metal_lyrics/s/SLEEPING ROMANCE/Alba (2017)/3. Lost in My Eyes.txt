Why all this weakness?
Could I change the world I hate?
And all this anger is lying so deep in my heart
I can't be fearless while I'm living through these days
It's now or never
I won't lose my soul

Feel this lack of growth
Like I've been waiting
To learn to control

Fight
You can take your pain away
Take a breath, it's not too late
A light so bright is pushing me forward
Fight
You can take your pain away
Take a breath, it's not too late
A light so bright is pushing me forward

Why should I stand?
There's a time to rise again
When all these troubles
Are useless, they kill your mind
Why feel this sorrow?
I want my life to change
It's now or never
I'm looking for more

It's time to feel free, right now!
I have to grow up and learn it somehow
I want to find what I've lost in my eyes
Watch the horizon!
Abandon these lies!
