Let your spirit outside (of) my veil
And offer it all to these moments
Now don't try to deceive the time
You know I don't want to feel more pain

Desert instants, while whisper scream in the dark, long for eternity

Do you hear my voice? In this silence
Of the light arising for us, by now
Do you feel the wind?
A trap on my head impedes my flight
Free me!

Please, try to prevent my falling
And let me sail (in) this endless ocean
Cover me with your essence
Alone, tonight, I need your sweet poison

Desert instants, while whisper scream in the dark, long for eternity

Do you hear my voice? In this silence
Of the light arising for us, by now
Do you feel the wind?
A trap on my head impedes my flight
I'm slave here, with my hands I can only pray

Do you hear my voice? In this silence
Of the light arising for us, by now
Do you feel the wind?
A trap on my head impedes my flight
Free me!
