Finding my way
I was searching for it in your voice
Whisper, nothing to feel
Are you living in your deepest void?
Wait for me..

I have lost all my dreams in the rain
But a blind man told me how to see the way, for me
I belong to the sound (of) misery
Can I fall from the grace? Can you help me stop bleeding now?

Finding my way
I was searching for it in your voice
Whisper, nothing to feel
Are you living in your deepest void?
Wait for me..

I will find all my hopes through the mist
But the hatred is waiting for one of my slips, again
I escape from this trap, take my hand
Can I fall from the grace? Can you help me stop bleeding?

Finding my way
I was searching for it in your voice
Whisper, nothing to feel
Are you living in your deepest void?
Wait for..
Flying away from your thorns
Stand outside of your door..
Dream on

Finding my way
I was searching for it in your voice
Whisper, nothing to feel
Are you living in your deepest void?
Wait for me..
