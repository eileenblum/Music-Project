Hidden in the Devil's cave
Wonderful creatures are there
(They have one fault)
In the deep of a new land
They yearn for their revenge

They have one fault
Something goes wrong
Desire, fleshes and blood
And they fall

Angels of fire
Wanted to feel, and breath and kiss
Lost all their beliefs
Angels on fire
Looking for freedom and grace
It's a shame
In domu lux et dei

And so cruel their sons on our earth
That Gabriel would grasp his bright sword

They have one fault
Something goes wrong
Desire, fleshes and blood
And they fall

Angels of fire
Wanted to feel, and breath and kiss
Lost all their beliefs
Angels on fire
Looking for freedom and grace
It's a shame
In domu lux et dei

And to Gabriel said the Lord, "Proceed against the biters and the reprobates, and against the children of fornication, and destroy the children of the Watchers from amongst men: send them one against the other that they may destroy each other in battle."
Angel what is in you?
Your vote and task's
Preserving good

Angels of fire
Wanted to feel, and breath and kiss
Lost all their beliefs
Angels on fire
Looking for freedom and grace
It's a shame
In domu lux et dei
