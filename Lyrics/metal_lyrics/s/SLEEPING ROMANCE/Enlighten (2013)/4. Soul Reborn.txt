The flame of a candle's dancing in my room
Closing my eyes and I know what is real in my mind
I feel life is burning inside, my body is a breath
Fading away with the rain

Flying out from my body within my soul
In the sky, in the ocean, through the earth
I'm burning in your blazing flame

No.. don't bring me back to my past
This is not a dream, can't you see all my tears
Tell me
I know real beauty slowly steal me
Abandoning my sins I feel the emptiness in me

Flying out from my body within my soul
In the sky, in the ocean, through the earth
I'm burning in your blazing flame

Melt in the sun like dew
Be the first breath
Bring inside (the) eternity
Secretly..

Flying out from my body within my soul
In the sky, in the ocean, through the earth
I'm burning in your blazing flame
