Oh dear, how poor I'm lonely
You'll go to Hade's house
Abandoning me to a bitter pain
Our son was born to wretched parents
What now will he do? Without your wisdom?
His life will always be a sorrow

Lords open gates to your place
Changing our life in a red
Burning curtain of hell
The time I weep, until you sleep
Is waiting for eternal death

Revenge knew the Greek's failing
His mortal, weak part
Perfection a legendary man
God's hand that guided Paris arrow
And wounded his heel, fatally struck him
A precious blood is often hidden

Lords open gates to your place
Changing our life in a red
Burning curtain of hell
The time I weep, until you sleep
Is waiting for eternal death

Sky is falling
A handful of your hate
Silence is broken in this sunk land

Achilles eum transfigit, armis spoliat
Insultandum foedandumque proebet suis
Hectoris sui interitum plorat omnis civitas
Lamentantur ex muro parentes

Lords open gates to your place
Changing our life in a red
Burning curtain of hell
The time I weep, until you sleep
Is waiting for eternal death
