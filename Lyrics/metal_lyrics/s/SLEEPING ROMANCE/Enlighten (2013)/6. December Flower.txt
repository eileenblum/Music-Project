Since you've been away
I spent all my nights (wasting time)
Wondering why I would not lie down and die

Raindrops fallen out there as tears that I have cried
In this morning a ray of light is shining on my side for me

When darkness took place
Flowers of the garden (faded away)
No more roses and daisies
But brambles, dead woods

Raindrops fallen out there as tears that I have cried
In this morning a ray of light is shining on my side for me

Feed a plant, then leave without a care
However I will grew up strong with my leaves and my gems

Raindrops fallen out there as tears that I have cried
In this morning a ray of light is shining on my side for me
