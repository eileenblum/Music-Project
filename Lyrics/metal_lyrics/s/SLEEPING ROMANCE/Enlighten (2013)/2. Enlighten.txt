Just let me tell you a story about
Some ways of living and loving in a world
You can't know
Pretending to grow, to move, to blow
To soar up

While angels are turning into grace
Demons languish because of their pains
You're still angry wondering why
There's no peace, no love, no joy in your life

You are always so miserable
That I have no more
Tears to cry for you
Numb by a thousand of fights
No regrets, no lies
I'm enlighten

While angels are turning into grace
Demons languish because of their pains
You're still angry wondering why
There's no peace, no love, no joy in your life

Speechless, wild landscapes under your feet and
Hopeless, nobody cares of your sadness

While angels are turning into grace
Demons languish because of their pains
You're still angry wondering why
There's no peace, no love, no joy in your life
