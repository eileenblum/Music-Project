[Music: Hageland]
[Lyrics: Mickelson]

Conclude with error, idiosycratic deeds
Synthetic habitat
Comprehension. Consciousness. All senses are astray
Infected selfish greed

Unpleasant frame of mind,
reflections of what's behind
Wisdom breeds fragile minds

Wake from his fantasy. Fear mendacious empathy
Ecstatic biased sphere
We are the plaintive race, constructors of predestined decay
A paragon fails

Force of fiction, faking formula of faith
A chameleon with words
Uncertain factors feed a mind so crystal clear
When will this circle end?

Mankind falls from what it breeds
Cast reflections on it's ego's path
Altered minds in altered settings, twisted mind
Collapse into intensity, understand the face of man

Everlasting hunt for truth,
blinded by different views
See through obstructive haze,
and cleanse the human race!
Mankind falls from what it breeds
Conjuring collapse with this ego's path
Altered minds in altered settings made by man
Collapse into intensity. Aftermath of thinking man
