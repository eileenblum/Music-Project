[Music: Norberg]
[Lyrics: Norberg]

Bliss torn, transition incomplete
As fall entombed their mother sphere
Bent to the sky, artificial eye

Crushed, nature moans, enlightened
Drained was the heart of man
Insects spawning, hybrids crawling
In spinning cluster skies we're soaring

I've seen tomorrow sun die
into the darkness skies
But as poisoned seeds and acid rot the earth
We will fly into exile

Oh, morituri te salutant
Defier of the Night
Fierce adulterers
What's the destination
of their selfish search?

Forced into spiral alterations
The coils of pain
Hybrids crawling
in spinning cluster skies we're soaring
They've got reconcile
Their cause is unpure
The poor invest in stolen grace
