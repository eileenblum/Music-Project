[x/Cloud of Unknowing]
[y/Being and Nothingness]
[z/Shuffled]

[Music: Norberg(x,y), Hageland(z), Gornitzka(x)]
[Lyrics: Hageland, Norberg]

Life as it seemed to the circling man
As he gazed into discarded land
Was a ride on a carousel of faith
Then he flew away

He travelled far through his worn out mind
Through sorrow and pai, what had he gained?
Still his dreams they could never take away
So he flew into the sun again

Emptiness struck as he realized
There's no answer to "who am I? what am I?"
He then saw why men must construct for themselves
A cloud of Unknowing
