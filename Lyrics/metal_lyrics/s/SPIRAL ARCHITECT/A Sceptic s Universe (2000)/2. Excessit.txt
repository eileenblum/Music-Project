[Music: Gundersen, Norberg]
[Lyrics: Gundersen, Hageland]

Lost in an orbit ride,
climb onto your highest mountain,
find the fountain
Wandering through shadows, on and on
Climb on higher find the fountain

Fall into spirals of condemnation
And sacrifice your past to the fountain
Know not how to get away from yourself

Riding through the path of totality surfing hypersonic jets
Equation of time

Tracking golden spirals, contained within primordial seeds
Reincarnation of your self

Fall into overdrive,
climb onto your highest mountain,
find the fountain
Wandering through shadows, on and on in despair

Your death shroud enters your mind,
disguised as virginity
Trapped in perverted rites

Young child's subverted mind
Sheds its atmosphere
Modus in rebus est
