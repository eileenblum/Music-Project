[Music: Gornitzka, Gundersen, Norberg]
[Lyrics: Gornitzka]

Words, all words worth nothing with you
Mistaken meaning, a constantly spreading,
dreaded dark disease
Truth itself untrue to those who stop to think
Fluently fluid, subjectively in sync

Central ego, orbital estranged reality
The remainder of a dream enter the dead

Linguistic obstacles abort
The thoughts behind
distort all which was once clear like purest air

Knotted tongues tied up by missing, mocking syllables
Lacklustre soliloquies performed in
solipsism's shrines of shallow sentiments
Look at my words, nothing besides remains
All the wisdom, all our colossal thoughts
Boundless but blind the grand idea astray
No universal thought-patterns will apply
Intentions abused and lost along the way

Always in motion
Circling a notion (of fixed unchangeability)
Truth itself untrue to those who stop to think
Fluently fluid, subjectively in sync

Central ego, orbital estranged reality
The remainder of a dream enter the dead
