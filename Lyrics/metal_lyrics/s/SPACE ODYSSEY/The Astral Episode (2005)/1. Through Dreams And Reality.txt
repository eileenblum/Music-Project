We must believe that someone will see the markers beyond the danger
It's there in the night when silence appears a time when you are gone
Now you can see what's iside of me it's there and you can't deny it
All of a sudden you're out of this world betrayed by your own mind

How... shall I call the acid dream
How... through dreams and reality

Now the creation were spirits are found can beat down the angry stranger
Built by the nature in this universe but though it's in your head
Haunting your soul like angels of death a nightmare with no control
Wake up and see what's inside your dream no land of paradise

How... shall I call the acid dream
How... through dreams and reality

How... shall I call the acid dream
How... through dreams and reality
