The day has come to save the angel's songs
Making the direction with despair
The closing end is changing
With pieces left and sorrows everywhere

No matter when the sun goes down on me
I will take the saint from dusk till dawn
As time goes by the ancient is fading down the stars
With a little bit of love

As you have blessed the fall

Astral sins they've sen the way to win
And you fight disillusion with casting spells
As you might see the way they will be here to stay
Believe the story and be gone with your dreams
Lost in the world of danger

The saddest winds wake up my enemies
They're waiting to betray the lies for real
As you despite your anger
Are trying to deny what's going on with me

As you have blessed the fall

Astral sins they've sen the way to win
And you fight disillusion with casting spells
As you might see the way they will be here to stay
Believe the story and be gone with your dreams
Lost in the world of danger

Astral sins they've sen the way to win
And you fight disillusion with casting spells

In your mind they will be sacrificed
With songs from heaven and into eternity

Master wings will take you to the sin
Then you can fight with your own sword and destiny
