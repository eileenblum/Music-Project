When the morning light will be closing the direction
I will fail again for sure
Where the wind goes on still with the affection
They all want me to carry on not fade away and die

In the fading stars I could see the whole creation
Once the time went on and on
In the oldest sin to change with no good reason
Can I raise my aggression now against the other side

I will leave the spirit goes I will pray for the others
A generation of cruelty they will give the warming light away

They will set where the wind blows
They will try to remind you
And I'll wait and the wind grows
Just to pass like a soldier
Soldier of love

And the endless soul will be changing my conception
For the underworld to see
Like a saint of mud your eyes will be infected
I can feel the vocation now it's filled my fantasy

I will leave the spirit goes I will pray for the others
A generation of cruelty they will give the warming light away

At the end there will always be someone else in your shadow
When they ask you to cast a spell raise your voice and try to carry on

They will set where the wind blows
They will try to remind you
And I'll wait and the wind grows
Just to pass like a soldier
Soldier of love

They will set where the wind blows
They will try to remind you
And I'll wait and the wind grows
Just to pass like a soldier
Soldier of love
They will set where the wind blows
They will try to remind you
And I'll wait and the wind grows
Just to pass like a soldier
Soldier of love

They will set where the wind blows
They will try to remind you
And I'll wait and the wind grows
Just to pass like a soldier
Soldier of love
