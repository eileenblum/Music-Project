Might now surrender I've lost hope and returned my soul
Crossing the ocean leaving my spirit behind
My dream is fading because I'm out of control
Whisper my sin now I can

My soul's on fire oh... yeah...
And my tears are burning resend the

Time and tell me when the sun will show me how to feel the spirits in the night reversation

And the goodness might be true as light will start to rise
With angels in the night I'm on fire

While the essence of fairies and flames from the past
Are trying to steal it find them and hold to your dream
Discern illusions memories will guide the way
Frozen in time now I can

My soul's on fire oh... yeah...
And my tears are burning resend the

Time and tell me when the sun will show me how to feel the spirits in the night reversation

And the goodness might be true as light will start to rise
With angels in the night I'm on fire
