Just like a soldier I've been searching for danger
But now I can't believe what's killing me

Is there a reason for an act of my treason
In the occasion of my fantasy

When the end is closing in I'm cruising on the spark...

...back to the dark

I am the savior of the cruelest behaviour
But now I can't denied I'm falling down

And from the endless to the edge of the coldest
Is there a way out to eternity

When the end is closing in I'm cruising on the spark...
Feel the fire from the grief it's human sacrifice

...back to the dark
...back to the dark
...back to the dark
