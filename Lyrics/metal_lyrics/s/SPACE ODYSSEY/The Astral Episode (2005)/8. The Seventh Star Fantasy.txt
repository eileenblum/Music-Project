From the signs of a magic hand
To a dream where you always surrender

I called the master the master said
Come to me, come to me I will rescue you

And for the eyes of eternity
Every reason of life will defend you

Another way is to face the stars
And to scarify the blinds for the shadows

Going crazy, there's so much I wanted
Can hear the angels' song

Closing windfall with your supervision
And for the endless

For human race fly with no fear
You might then sail the seven seas

Stars can be real like them above
The nightmare seems to blend your eyes

Your goal is to save the world
With the wind you can fly like the fire

Can hear the voice of a broken man
Let it go let it go you will never find

The holy saint and the wind will blow
Are the chains falling down to the end-all

Going crazy, there's so much I wanted
Can hear the angels' song

Closing windfall with your supervision
And for the endless

Behind the timeless
I find my way back... home to the sky
Home to the sky

For human race fly with no fear
You might then sail the seven seas

Stars can be real like them above
The nightmare seems to blend your eyes

Stars can be real like them above
The nightmare seems to blend your eyes

And for the endless
Behind the timeless
I find my way back
Home to the sky

For human race fly with no fear
You might then sail the seven seas

Stars can be real like them above
The nightmare seems to blend your eyes

For human race fly with no fear
You might then sail the seven seas

Stars can be real like them above
The nightmare seems to blend your eyes

Stars can be real like them above
The nightmare seems to blend your eyes
