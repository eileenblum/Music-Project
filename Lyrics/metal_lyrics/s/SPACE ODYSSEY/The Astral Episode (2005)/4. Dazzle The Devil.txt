I've trusted in the angels and their souls
But they've told me all the lies
It's time to get my feet back on the ground
Put on sacredness and go

Can't testify with signs from my own grave
All the time they've been around
On seven seas I sail across them all
They will gather here for real

Now facing all the stars waiting for the dawn
To be my savoir on the crusade it's for real
And then I'll see my own sacrifice
The mastermind of rage will lead my way
I'm waiting on the edge

Yeah! Turning on the night...
Yeah! Turning on the night...

With faces that are naked they will send
You the everlasting song
I can't deny the fact that I will be
Supersonic to survive

Now facing all the stars waiting for the dawn
To be my savoir on the crusade it's for real
And then I'll see my own sacrifice
The mastermind of rage will lead my way

Free dancing in the sky telling all the good
About my passion for the antichrist of life
Can this be true casting all the spells
Just to make it for the endless son
I'm waiting on the edge

Yeah! Turning on the night...
Yeah! Turning on the night...

Yeah! Turning on the night...
Yeah! Turning on the night...

Now facing all the stars waiting for the dawn
To be my savoir on the crusade it's for real
And then I'll see my own sacrifice
The mastermind of rage will lead my way

Free dancing in the sky telling all the good
About my passion for the antichrist of life
Can this be true casting all the spells
Just to make it for the endless son
I'm waiting on the edge

Yeah! Turning on the night...
Yeah! Turning on the night...

Yeah! Turning on the night...
Yeah! Turning on the night...
