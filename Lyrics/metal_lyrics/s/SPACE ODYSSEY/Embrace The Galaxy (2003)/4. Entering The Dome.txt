Hell is bound with tears and grief
For me unite world has set
Dark lies anf fables trapped in secret places, far beyond eternity
Raise the temple; pay the price of blood at your feet in horror proud
Be the lsot betrayer and enter the dome
See the foreign lies behold the madness with your own estimations

When I saw the light in my dream
I knew you were there with your sin

Chosen from the other side, with fury in your mind
They will give you strength to carry on

It's time and you have to believe
That I must be there to receive

Fading spirits of the world for you they'd sacrifice
I will walk the stairway to the stars

Now is the time and that's equal for us all
One of us might be the one whose soul will burn alive

Gone up in flames no temptations for the weak
In their spirit eyes I see they're stranded ended

To day I will answer your soul
With fire and ice I will fall

Chosen from the other side, with fury in your mind
I will give you strength to carry on

For this I will pray and be strong
I'll do it and you will be gone

Fading spirits of the world for you they'd sacrifice
I will walk the stairway to the stars

Now is the time and that's equal for us all
One of us might be the one whose soul will burn alive

Gone up in flames no temptations for the weak
In their spirit eyes I see they're stranded ended

Now is the time and that's equal for us all
One of us might be the one whose soul will burn alive

Gone up in flames no temptations for the weak
In their spirit eyes I see they're stranded ended
