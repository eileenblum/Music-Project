This is for real...
This is for real...

When the ends is over I will bring the pieces left
And the saints of sadness watching over my grief

While the last salvation fades into eternity
All this for creation, which is lost in the night

I will embrace the galaxy
I will touch all the stars in the sky
I will do it for you, even when you're gone

This is for real...
This is for real...

Far beyond the oceans in a place with stones and ice
All this built by nations on the first day of life

This was blessed and hated just before the end was near
And as time was changing distress became for real

I will embrace the galaxy
I will touch all the stars in the sky
I will do it for you, even when you're gone

This is for real...
This is for real...

Can this be real...
This must be real...
