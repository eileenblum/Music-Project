Walking through fire and ice the heat is on me danger
Casting my spells in the air the end will be near

Touching the fire with fear compassion and love, stranger
Now I must endure my guilt I might not survive

I must be synchronized not petrified with sudden lies
This is how I feel

For love my saviour now is dying and she's crucified
You know what I meant

Fasten your seat belt of love and cry out my name, liar
Anguish and fear is for real it's shown in your face

I must be stabilized not terrified into my eyes
This is how I feel

The final destiny can be the end of love and lies
You know what I mean

This is the end
Lost in the shadows again

Placing the edge on this overture of pain
I will taste the fading spirits sent from hell

Blessed by the book I will save the world from lies
Hear the ancient voice is saying you will see... yeah!

Despair and pain
Despair and pain

Walking through fire and ice the heat is on me danger
Casting my spells in the air the end will be near

I must be synchronized not petrified with sudden lies
This is how I feel

For love my saviour now is dying and she's crucified
You know what I meant

This is the end
Lost in the shadows again

Placing the edge on this overture of pain
I will taste the fading spirits sent from hell

Blessed by the book I will save the world from lies
Hear the ancient voice is saying you will see... yeah!

Despair and pain
Despair and pain

This is the end
Lost in the shadows again

Placing the edge on this overture of pain
I will taste the fading spirits sent from hell

Blessed by the book I will save the world from lies
Hear the ancient voice is saying you will see... yeah!
