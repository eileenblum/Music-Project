It cannot be the one his mind is filled with grief and hate
You will have to sacrifice

Your own dimension is your weapon in this holy war
Pay the price for judgement day

To see the morning lies you must be brave and be the strong
Broken words are not the real

This is the only way to find the key for you and me
Now you force the shadows away with danger...

Undemonstrative strong and creative
Filling this soul with rage, yes
Sent from desire to be the liar
No one cares if you will live or die... yeah

When they have spoken with the prophet and they're satisfied
Try to see behind them all

Before they're wagging and they're saying all and understand
Seek the master onhis way

With you they come again to see what's in eternity
Play the scene and crucify

What's left is what is right for human race and modern life
Now you force the shadows away with danger...

Undemonstrative strong and creative
Filling this soul with rage, yes
Sent from desire to be the liar
No one cares if you will live or die... yeah

Now you force the shadows away with danger...

Undemonstrative strong and creative
Filling this soul with rage, yes
Sent from desire to be the liar
No one cares if you will live or die... yeah

Undemonstrative strong and creative
Filling this soul with rage, yes
Sent from desire to be the liar
No one cares if you will live or die... yeah
