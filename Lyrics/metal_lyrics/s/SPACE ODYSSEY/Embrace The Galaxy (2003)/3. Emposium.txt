Fetching all the stars before you're under
Cradles on the yard believe and wonder

Starring at the scene of rage and thunder
Disbelief in you, not so much...

Merciless to me, it's my decision
Angels of my dream will be your vision

Raise your hang above the dead and endless
Hungry for your life...

Oh...! We'll keep on fighting together
Still I believe in love

I can't go carry on into my sorrow
Might be forever more...

In the endless son...

And no when you have gone into the places
Of fury and pain to see the faces

Aggression is for real in this position
Exceed the enemy

Oh...! We'll keep on fighting together
Still I believe in love

I can't go carry on into my sorrow
Might be forever more...

In the endless son...
In the endless son...
In the endless son...

When the morning was come, the entire chief
Priests and elders of the people took counsel
Against him tp put him to death. and when they
Had bound him they led him away and
Delivered him to the evil crowed

Please, please let me go

In the endless son...
In the endless son...

In the endless son...
In the endless son...
