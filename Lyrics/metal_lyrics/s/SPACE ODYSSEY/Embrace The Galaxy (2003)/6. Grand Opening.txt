Now, I will be the saint of heroes and stop every favor
I'll carry be burden, for the unbroken spirit I'll fade away

With lies from the Holy Grail the master will send you
To fight for the glory, you must save all your lies for the rainy day...

The unbroken lord

The time has been close to me and now I can feel it
As you might be judging me with power and steel I will end this game...

To be with the unprotected to be with their sorrow
Will take you into the balst of fire and darkness ou'll end up dead

The unbroken lord

There's no time for sadness
Life will be your madness
Bring it back to freedom
Last to find the key to

Heaven and it's jury
Overwhelmed with fury
Found the way to goodness
To the end of bitterness

Now, I will be the saint of heroes and stop every favor
I'll carry be burden, for the unbroken spirit I'll fade away

With lies from the Holy Grail the master will send you
To fight for the glory, you must save all your lies for the rainy day...

The unbroken lord

There's no time for sadness
Life will be your madness
Bring it back to freedom
Last to find the key to

Heaven and it's jury
Overwhelmed with fury
Found the way to goodness
To the end of bitterness

The unbroken lord

There's no time for sadness
Life will be your madness
Bring it back to freedom
Last to find the key to

Heaven and it's jury
Overwhelmed with fury
Found the way to goodness
To the end of bitterness

There's no time for sadness
Life will be your madness
Bring it back to freedom
Last to find the key to hell...
