Like and angel who is fading on the edge of time
Like a burden on your shoulders can be crossing your mind

Like a stranger only danger can be on your mind
For no reason only visions will be in the night

I believe when sun goes down
I believe in love
To many people you're on your own
Seize the day and try to carry on...

Requiem for a dream...
Carry on...

In the endless I'll besearching for the freedom in...
The ovations of the nation who is crossing that line

I believe when sun goes down
I believe in love
To many people you're on your own
Seize the day and try to carry on...

On the edge I will fight them all
To the end of time
I will seek for the restless call
All the lies will fade away and die...

Requiem for a dream...
Carry on...

All the lies will fade away and die...

Requiem for a dream...
Carry on...

Requiem for a dream...
Carry on...
