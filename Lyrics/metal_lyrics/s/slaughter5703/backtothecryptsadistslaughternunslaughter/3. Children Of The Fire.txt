[performed by Slaughter]Death, it's gonna come real slow
Guess at how you're gonna go
I'll take your life some vile way
Summoned from the dead another day

Satan, save me from the light
Make my life eternal night
Take me from this disgusting grave
Become your everlasting slave

We are the children of the fire
Live our lives by our desire
Demons and tyrant hold the key to death's door
Satan is laughing, hear the thunder roar

Lucifer's grinning, another virgin dies
Captors of hell hold the flag of hades high
Father of evil, children of fire
Running through hell with captors never tire
