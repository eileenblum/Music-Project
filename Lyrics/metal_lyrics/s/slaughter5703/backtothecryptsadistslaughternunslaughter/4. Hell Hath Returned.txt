[performed by Slaughter]Hell hath returned, city full of sin
Hell hath returned, where has God been

Mayhem in school halls
Death in our streets
Murder in the courtroom

Collapsing sex morals
Filth from our church
The bomb is our lifeline

Hell hath returned, city full of sin
Hell hate returned, where has God been

Policemen are killed off
The threat of third war
Chemicals in backyards
