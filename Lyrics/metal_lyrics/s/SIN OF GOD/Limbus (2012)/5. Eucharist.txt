My blood flowed into Chalice
When I was sacrificed on the Cross
My body broke apart so
Drink my Blood! Eat my Body!

Iâm the Son of the Lord, not the Bastard from Bethlehem!
Iâm the Son who resurrected on the third day!

Bite into my raw Flesh
Dig your teeth into it
Claw the flesh from my bones
Eat the Immortal!

Iâm the Son of the Creator, not the Freak of Nazareth!
Iâm the Son who beat Death in the gastric of Earth!

Everyone kneels down hearing the Name of my Father!

Where are that people whose Gods are so close 
As our God is close to Us, who gave his blood for Us!?

Be my body your life
Be my blood you drink
Drink my blood, eat my body
And Iâll raise you on the Final Day!

Iâm the Son of the Lord, not the Bastard from Bethlehem!
Iâm the Son who resurrected on the third day!

In your Hands, gather my blood 
And drink All of It!
Iâll heal you with it
My blood is the Lordâs blood!

Iâm the Son of the Creator, not the Freak of Nazareth!
Iâm the Son who beat Death in the gastric of Earth!
