When they buried my 6-year-old body
I thought my pains are over and
Iâll be blissful in Heaven

Why did You thrust me to Hell? 

I was told those would come here who are guilty
Than why my innocent soul suffers in flames?

Why did You thrust me to Hell? 

Give me a new chance or burn me into ashes.

How can I bear Suffering?
How can I escape from the Flames?
How can people believe in You?
How can they love the God of Pain?

I didnât have time to Live
I donât know what Sin is
I know only Pain
Into this Inferno

Why did You thrust me to Hell?

Donât torture my Innocent Soul anymore
And let me out of the Endless Empire of Pain
