I breath Death of
Perdition and Fallen
Who are sinners
And God wanted their Death
An endless road
This is the trial of Honor
Iâll get forgiveness
If I find the way out

I make a move in Endless Circle
In the Cemetery of Souls
Created for Torture and created for Fall
I saw all the doors
I went through all the hallways
Created for Torture and created for Fall
Iâll never get out of here
My body will be tired in this fight
Created for Torture and created for Fall

I felt into a trap
In this maze
This building holds me in
Itâll never let me out
