The Sun disappeared
The sky is empty
In this Darkness
The world started to freeze 

People in fear of darkness 
Wash away their sins 
With sacrificial blood 
And offer their life 
As the price in front of their Lord

God cursed man with the sin
And gave war and suffering to Earth
Godâs curse is as old as the creation
From the Seeds ov Death and Pain
Life has began

Theyâre sacrificing their Childrenâs life to Him 
For forgiveness of their acts 
And to give back the Sun 
So that it will rise to the sky again 
And burn away Death and Frost 

God cursed Man with the Sin
And gave war and suffering to Earth
Godâs curse is as old as the creation
From the Seeds ov Death and Pain
Life has began

The Gates of the Crypts will open again
Breathing fresh Death into itself
Covered by leaves and branches
