Seth, our lives felt apart
Osiris wonât put the fire out anymore
Wonât water our lands anymore
Every hope of ours is lost

Darkness holds you inside forever!

Osiris promised us the eternal life
In magnificence and light
You took everything from Us!
You brake every rule
You destroy everything that lives
And you kill us by legions of the living dead

You destroyed your Motherâs womb as
Youâre destroying our children now in great revenge
And rived that who gave you life
Youâre doing this with those who didnât hurt you

World of the living is
Ruled by Eternal Pain
The living dead army of yours
Rapes! Defrauds!
Your followers steal the power
From those who are living on the West Lands 
In order Osiris not to keep his promise.

Violator of the principle of Life!
Seth!
