Oh, Great and Glorious wake up!
Slaves of Yours are waiting for You to come
To let you correct our mistakes
Incinerate the Earth with your Holy Fever!

Youâre the Conqueror
The Greatest Immortal
Destroyer of All!

Pass your sentence and take our blood
We were living too long in trash of sins
We bow in front of the Lord of the Universe
Burn our guilty Souls in the heat of Sun!

Youâre the Conqueror
The Greatest Immortal
Destroyer of All!

Flames are spreading
Conquering everything
Destruction of Earth has begun
This is the Final Day!
Earth will be purified by fire
Judgment day has finally come
our Lord sits on the Throne of Universe

Oh, Creator of Creators, let my voice be heard!
Wake up from your millennial dreams
I want Evilâs darkness to pass away
Bury Earth into the Sun!

Youâre the Conqueror
The Greatest Immortal
Destroyer of All!

I open my arms inside the Sun,
I can feel the Power what made him God
Who brought the distant Eternal Brightness from the Sky
I can finally die in the Light of Sunburst.
