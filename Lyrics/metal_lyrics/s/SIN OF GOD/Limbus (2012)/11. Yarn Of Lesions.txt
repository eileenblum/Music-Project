Your body is bleeding
Youâre dying 
From your own hands

Yarn of lesions
Dark light of your soul
Traces of your riddance
Gates of cuts

You cannot hide the
Yarn of lesions
An opened wound
An opened wound

Eternal scars on your body
Numbers of your fall
You didnât walk through 
The way of Death.

Instead of resolutness
Fear lives in you instead of Death 
Only scars as vital organ
Only cowardness as vital organ 
Live in You
