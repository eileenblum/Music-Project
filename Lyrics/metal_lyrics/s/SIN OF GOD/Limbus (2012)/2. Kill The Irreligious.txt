Rise from Dust and kill them
Get up from ground and destroy them

Kill the Irreligious!

Riseâ¦
Get upâ¦

Kill the Irreligious!

I am the God of Gods
Earth will quake from my voice
Those who scorn my Faith have to die
Kill in my Name! Kill in my Name!

Be my hands that hold the gun
With which I strike the Blasphemers
Be my voice which preaches the Evangelion
When their hours of Death will come.
They will suffer in Inferno
Till the end of time
They will suffer in Inferno 
Till the end of time

The sky will open and will flood Death to you
This is war which kills every life
The sky is painted by smoke
The ground is painted by blood
I erase my Procreaction

Man didnât bleed as much before his Death as you will!

The sky will openâ¦

My Son went to Earth and took your sins
He sacrificed His life
For you, you Ungrateful!
