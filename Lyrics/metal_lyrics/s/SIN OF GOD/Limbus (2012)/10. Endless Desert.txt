Since you came to our World
They hold your flesh in their hands
I was raised to be weak and dumb
To be speechless on your sacrificeâs day

You live in Darkness and Frost
You suffer from Their hands
You live in Darkness and Frost
You suffer from Their hands

You were fallen your mind was broken
Youâre falling into the hands of your murderers
None will save you from pain 
Your body will be dissect
By their nails and hands
Skin by skin

Darkness devoured 
Manâs heart
Beyond the Gates of Hell 
Only suffering waits for You

Endless Desert of Death

Where manâs stained body fall 
And Rats chew your flesh down

Youâre praying for Redemption pointlessly
Thereâs no way out of here
Living eyes canât see here
