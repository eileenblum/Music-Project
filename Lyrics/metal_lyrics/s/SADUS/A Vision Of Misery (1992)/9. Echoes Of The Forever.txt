All is consumed by vanity
Whims of short lived mortality
Our desperate cries of pity
Are carried on winds for eternity
And lost in forgotten echoes...
forever
The more that is known
The greater there is fear
It's worthless to question
It's useless to interfere
What has already been
Will come to pass again
An altering is hopeless
A chasing after the wind
Minutes pass to hours
Hours into years
The years of your life
Reflected in the mirror
The mirror only shows
The time that you can see
But how can time exist
Without eternity
Revelations of mankind fade away
Cries are lost, spray to the wind
In revolutions of the world
And echoes of forever
In an endless circle the sun hides from our sight
But as the circle is endless
It returns after the night
Nothing is new under the sun
As past and future become one
Though the tide retreats,
perpetually from the shore
It always returns itself
As it has before
Everything is meaningless
Pure insignificance
The past always leaves us
But never to subside
Recollections of memory
And the future coincide
In thought dwell the mysteries
Eternally they reside
Forever is the circle
Forever are the tides
