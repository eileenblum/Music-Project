Eyes of the Greedy
See what they will
Lust of the Flesh
A need to fulfill
The Fool and the Liar
Must feed the desire
The Will to acquire
The Eyes of the Greedy will always Crave for more
Feasting hungry Eyes on this worthless Horde
The Eyes of the Greedy will see no Sleep or Rest
Are you saved or enslaved
Trapped by Need to have
Feel it clench you
Do you want to give in
Through the Eyes the Will to see what they want to see
Looking through the Eyes of Greed
Feel Temptation burn
Each earns his own Fate
Each one has a will to Live
Blind are the Eyes that Need
Looking through the Eyes of Greed
Eyes of the Greedy
See what they will
Lust of the Flesh
A need to fulfill
Looking through the Eyes of Greed
Feel Temptation burn
Each earns his own Fate
Each one has a Will to Live
Blind are the Eyes that need
Looking through the Eyes of Greed
