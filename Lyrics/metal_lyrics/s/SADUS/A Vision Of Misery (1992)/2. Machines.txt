What you breathe
Is supposedly
Exhausted clean
Machines
Toxins rise
Through melting Skies
Life will die
Machines
Work to feed
A lifeless breed
Eternally
Machines
Nourishing
The flourishing
Hybrid way
Machines
Circuits scream
Authority
Mankind heeds
Machines
Slave to all
Lifeless thralls
Of computer laws
Machines
Days are gone
New life's begun
On they'll run
Machines
