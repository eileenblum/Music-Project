Valley of dry Bones
Bless the Land
Arise come together Bone to Bone
Fusion of Flesh to Bone
Sand becomes the Blood of Man
Do it because I say you will
Repent to thee or turn to Dust
Just like the Sand
There'll be no rest
Valley of Dry Bones
Valley of Dry Bones
Bless the Land
Arise come together Bone to Bone
