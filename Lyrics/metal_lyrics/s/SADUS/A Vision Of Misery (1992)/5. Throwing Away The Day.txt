Staring at the Walls around me
Pale and dismal life
I'll leave
A Time of Emptiness
That surrounds me
Waiting just for Life to be
Seclusion into the Mind
Involuntary Refuge
A Period in Time
I'll wait
The carving out of Life
Left in Solitude
Wise enough to See
It will Change
Time won't help me
While I'm Waiting
Tired of Living
This way I'm Feeling
Delaying Await
Depression Fills me
Descending Feeling
Lapse of Meaning
Throw it Away
Throwing it all Way
Throw it Away
Throwing away the Day
Wasting my Life
Waiting for others to get with the Plan
Taking their Time
I can't wait forever for this I won't Stand
Time after Time
Leaving us dormant and rotting away
Waste of the Day
Until we take Hold and Break Free we'll Pay
Time won't help me
While I'm Waiting and Throwing Away the Day
Throw it Away
Throwing it all Way
Throw it Away
Throwing away the Day
Mourning Time
Seeps into your Head
Dazed in Wait
Day is Dead
Slow to Pass
Tired of this Life
Tired of this Life
I bet I'll Die to Live
Alone
