Hungriness of killing makes me all I am
Exploration of death
To heal is their plan
Incision, scrutiny
Futile plan failing
Spawning all sickness
Grotesque forms
Taking what I want
Leaving nothing for you
All that is left will be mine in time
Infection
Sickly form of life
Afflicted with incurable infestation
Cutting into life
Preserving mankind
Cutting into life
Under the knife
Under the knife
Under the knife
Hungriness of killing makes me all I am
Exploration of death
To heal is their plan
Cutting into life
Preserving mankind
Cutting into life
Under the knife
