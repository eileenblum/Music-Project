Living high, no Life denied
A Game's your Life
Every Time is Right
And one of these Times you're gonna Die
Racing Death, tempting Fate
You lose Control
Your Mind's lost, a senseless Cause
Until you get some more
Racing time, you can't get caught
But it's too late
Your Doom's locked, no Way out
Until you're straight
Play it straight or take a Chance
Well what will it be?
But of course we all know your Destiny
Your right to Live Is yours to give
So take Control
Or you'll fall
And then you Die
And then you Die
You're gonna Die
And then you Die
Long life, fast Death, which one
Will it be? Living hard, you're
Dying fast, you can't Fight
Destiny, Hands of Time are going
Fast, how long can you make it last?
Your Right to Live
Is yours to give
So take Control
Or you'll Fall
And then you die
