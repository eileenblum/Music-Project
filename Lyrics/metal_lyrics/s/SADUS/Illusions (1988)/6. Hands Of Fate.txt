Victims will follow to their Death
Show no Sorrow
Steal their last Breath
Hide in the Shadows to seek out my Prey
Victim's Creator leads them away
Frustrating Desire to watch the Victim die
The ultimate Destiny
Is to rob you of your Life
To die, to kill for the Night
I'll capture the Chosen
Who's trapped in my Sight
No Mercy, no Pity
For the one in my Grasp
Your Days have been numbered
This is your Last
You struggle with your Adversary
Only to be eaten alive
Still hungry for Violence
Perpetual Hunter for Life
A Hunter again to punish the Weak
Craving the Flesh
The meat of the Beast
Strike and Devour
For the Balance of Death
In dominate, terminate
Nature of death
Extinction of Life awaits
Your Destiny at Hand
Hands of Fate grasp you and tighten
Yet only by Chance
Lashing out to Dominate
Your Trust in me is your one Mistake
Life's Blood you're forced to give
Canceling your Life to Live
Spewing liquid Life Form
Clenching Jaws
Blunder to your Fate, you take the Fall
Tearing into your Flesh with wicked Claws
Worm Consumption
Deterioration
Carcass Erosion, Contamination
Decomposition, Mutilation
Equalization of Death and Life
Balance of Death, Balance of Life
Life's prolonged Prerequisite
Is for you to Die
A Hunter again to punish the Weak
Craving the Flesh
The meat of the Beast
Strike and devour
For the Balance of Death
In dominate, terminate
Nature of Death
Extinction of Life awaits
Your destiny at Hand
Hands of Fate grasp you and tighten
Yet only by Chance
