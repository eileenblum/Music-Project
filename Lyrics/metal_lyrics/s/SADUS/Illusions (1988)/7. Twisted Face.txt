Twisted mind, twisted Face
There's no rest, endless Race
It's too late to save your Face
From the twisted sons of Hate
In your brain, the vein of Pain
Causes you to twist your Face
Velocity, accelerate
Pressure builds, burning Strain
Mirror skiing for the answer
Your face a twisted Mess
Speeding faster, never Slowing
You know there's no rest
Feel the Rush, urgency
Methamphetamine, can't be Freed
Feel your Heart beat faster faster
Never ending Thrust
Feel your Skull begin to Crush
Your Brain turns into Mush
Crank it up, smell the Rage
Locked within, Cage of Death
Can't slow down, no time to Rest
No way to end this Chase
Your twisted Face, your burning Nose
You die a fucking Disgrace
Twisted Mind, Twisted Face
There's no rest, endless Race
It's too late to save your Face
From the twisted Sons of Hate
In your Brain, the Vein of Pain
Causes you to twist your Face
Velocity, Accelerate
Pressure builds, burning Strain
Mirror skiing for the Answer
Your face a twisted Mess
Speeding faster, never slowing
You know there's no Rest
Twisted Face
Twisted Face
Twisted Face
