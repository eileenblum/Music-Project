One lonely Man
Picked despite his Will
To fight for his Country
Supposedly Born and Bred to Kill
He was afraid to Die
To Kill, or to Fight
He had the Love of Jesus
Blinded by the Light
You'll Fight or Die
So Dominate, you can't Hide
It's Do or Die, before it's too Late
Far away from Home, his Mission
Is to Kill, there is no
Sanctuary, for the Coward's
Spiteful will, all others they
Will follow, the Leaders of the
Pack
Death is their Future in this
World
The Leaders Scream Attack
You'll Fight or Die
So Dominate, you can't Hide
It's Do or Die, before it's too Late
Smell of Death grows Stronger
As Blood begins to Flow
Every man's a Hunter
And to Kill is all they know
War Machines keep Pushing
Metal falls like Rain
Stench of Bodies Burning
This man has reached his End
This man's war he Lost
And no one's felt the Pain
No mercy and no Sorrow
Only Countries Gained
But far away from home, his
Mission was to kill
Still no Sanctuary, for the Cowards
Spiteful Will
You'll Fight or Die
So Dominate, you can't Hide
It's Do or Die, before it's too Late
