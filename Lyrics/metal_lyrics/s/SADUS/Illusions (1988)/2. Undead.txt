Emerging from Hell's Dominion
To crawl upon the Land
Mutants of the Holocaust
Lose their Flesh into the Sand
Victims of the wicked World
Pray to the evil Shrine
Brimstone Churches
They all fall in Time
The Undead
Immortality Madness possessed
Feeding on Flesh
Rancid decaying Stench
Vile Stench of Death
Burning rot Decay
Corpses litter Cities
In a silent putrid Array
Maggots fill their Brains
As every Limb must Fall
Submit to the Sewers below
And await the Reaper's Call
The Undead
Immortality Madness possessed
Feeding on Flesh
Rancid decaying Stench
Feed upon the living Flesh
As Blood fills their Eyes
Wishful whims of Life
Our maker hears their Cries
Kingdom of the Dead
Is cast out upon the Ground
Salvation from their Pain
Is nowhere to be found
The Undead
Immortality Madness possessed
Feeding on Flesh
Rancid decaying Stench
Memories of Destruction
Inflicted mortal Wounds
Mists of gaseous Poison
Sullen as it Looms
Immortal Corpses crawling
In Rust and toxic Slime
There is no Death in dying
For those who wish to Die
