Time... is wasting
Time... is passing
The world... is going straight down the tubes, oh well
What man will make of it... time will tell
Time
Watching all that's wasting in this world
In time there's no escaping what's to tell
The population is feeding, soon to fall
There's got to be a better way, time will tell
Quality receding
Contaminants increasing
Consequently death
The splendor and the radiance
The brightness and the brilliance
Sheer luster of life is gone
The foul stench of stag
Will devour the human race
Until every bit of life is gone
Poverty, extremity, impurity, insolvency
The crumble, decline, destruction, wears on
There's got to be a better way
Blacken the sky, nature has died
Wastefulness of mankind
Thoughts were impure, time must endure
We must stop before it's too late
Impurities will crush, till all life is lost
Destruction of the ozone layer
What has been said, what's left to say
There's got to be a better way
Putrefaction, uncleanness of man
The man infestation, infected world span
Filthy impurities, blue sky turn to gray
Crippled efficiency, the black eats away
Putrefaction, uncleanness of man
The man infestation, infected world span
The quagmire and vermin, as bad goes to worse
The drab wilt of mankind engulfing the earth
Watching all that's wasting in this world
In time there's no escaping what's to tell
The population is feeding, soon to fall
There's got to be a better way, time will tell
Quality receding
Contaminants increasing
Consequently death
