Struck down in a flash of pain
Killed swiftly in its own domain
Struggling for what is left
Brutal shock, dismemberment
Ineffective attempts to flee
Body stuck to an instant grave
Makes no difference left to be
Can't you see the life in me is draining away?
Destiny calls
Don't fall
Impending death
Struggling to be
Now freed
Life passed on
A million times struck down
Body becomes fused to the ground
Mangled body
Flattened corpse
Stench of rot
Hammered carnage
Crusting thing
Maggots breed
Degenerate
Mortified
Disintegrate
Eroding bone
Melts to stone
Collapse to dust
Good riddance
Struck down in a flash of pain
Killed swiftly in its own domain
Struggling for what is left
Brutal shock, dismemberment
Ineffective attempts to flee
Body stuck to an instant grave
Makes no difference left to be
Can't you see the life in me is draining away?
Good riddance
