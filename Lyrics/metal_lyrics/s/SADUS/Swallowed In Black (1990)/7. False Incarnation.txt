Contemplating death, untimely near
It's not your death developing your fear
Deteriorating state, hope is lost
Your greed for life is beyond the cost
Hoping for advancement, an invention, a cure
Because of your disease your intentions are unpure
Corrupted by moral values
Spoiled by common wealth
In your race for fortune
You forgot to regard your health
Self pity; shame to blame.
Existence transferred to an alternate frame
Cellular osmosis, frozen to paralysis
Suspending the result of the ultimate nemesis
Essence drained, exchanged for synthetics
Drastic measures to alter genetics
No reincarnation
Eternal hibernation
False incarnation
Opaque destination
Catatonic pleasure, anti-fluids numb the pain
Robbing yourself of death, what did you expect to gain?
Frozen fate, all thoughts cease
Resisting the afterlife for nothing at all
Truth distorted, path into darkness
Cannot see what caused your fall
Lying dormant, your seed of faith
Has grown into a nasty vine
Final chapter in the book of life
Forever darkness stops the time
Delaying natural death, for a fear of what's beyond
Afraid to take that final step, to the place where you belong
What you believed before
Do you anymore?
Or do you want to see
Immortality?
Looking out from the inside
To a place you cannot
Frozen in dark solitude
Yearning to be free
No one has awakened you
A false destiny
No reincarnation
Eternal hibernation
False incarnation
Opaque destination
False incarnation
