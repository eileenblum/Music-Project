Feasting on rancidness
Not seeing through the self-accusing lies
Are hordes of wormly cowards
Who hesitate and fail to bring their dreams to life
Oppression
Quickening
Aspirations
Left unseen
Lost in occupations
Becoming socially secured
Life's manipulation
Age endures
Accepting circumstances
Resentment uncontained
Quality of existence
Capitalistic gains
Can't you see
Your destiny?
Living free
Doing what you feel and think is real
Or do you just fail to see?
BLIND
Can't see through your own mind
Cast yourself to live this lie
Blackening out natural dignity
Forcing in abnormal functioning
Losing desire your will to leave
This life you built so easily
It's time...
to live
Rise
Ascend from below to blaze a trail through life
Follow your lead and succeed your destiny
Arise
Alive
Strive to live and live to please your mind
