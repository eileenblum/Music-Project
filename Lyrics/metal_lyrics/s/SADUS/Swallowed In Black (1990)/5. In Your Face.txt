You say you got a problem
I say you want to die
Confusion in your mind
Terror solidified
Violence indisplaced
Fear in its place
Tempest, yet blind in haste
All right, I'm in your face
Hostilities come to war
Outbreak, a rush discharged
Lash out your fuse is lit
Go off, inflict the sick
Violence indisplaced
Fear in its place
Tempest, yet blind in haste
All right, I'm in your face
Implode to the head
Convulsive force of red
Adrenaline rushing blast
Inflamed fury's past
Vindication,
justification is done
