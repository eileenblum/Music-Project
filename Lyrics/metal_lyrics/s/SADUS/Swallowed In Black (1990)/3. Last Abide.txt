Flash of light
Before your eyes
All is deceased
Victimized
By undecided crimes
Maturing fate
Wasting life, surpassing time
Eradicate
Erupt, toxic clouds exterminate
Fusion flow
Eats the brain
Melds decay
Lethal dose
Feeds disease
Depopulates
Rotting blood, turning black
A violent, noxious death
Winds of death
Engulf the sphere
That no longer lives
Entropy
Now takes its course
Until the end
A world gone black, through toxic skies
Lay to waste
Last abide
Upon earth
Takes its place
