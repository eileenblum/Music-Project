Freak...
Who are you to me
One bad seed
A different breed
A fucking freak

Dead, you're dead
Dead to me

I burn inside
From hate and lies
Your drama tells the tale
You'll burn yourself

Freaks
We are all freaks
Freaks
We will die freaks

Who are you to me
Not a fucking thing
Greedy piece of shit
You make me sick

You're fucked
Dead, fucking dead to me

I live with hate
Sadness and pain
Never be the same
You're the one to blame
You're the one to blame
You're the one...
