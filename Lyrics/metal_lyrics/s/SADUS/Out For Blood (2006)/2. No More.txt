Ice cold blood is flowing in your veins
Screams not heard oblivious to the pain
Blind from the rage, you couldn't just walk away
We've all heard it all there's nothing left to say

No more face left
No more unrest
No more protest
I don't want to hear your lies
No more resentment
No more rejection
No more deception
I don't want your alibis

Torn right through it's ripping through your skin
Cold black darkness covers the evil grin

No more true words
No more voice heard
Nothing to endure
Couldn't spare another day
No more weird moods
No more attitudes
Not even if we could
You know it had to be this way

No one trusts you all you ever say are lies
Time won't heal the insanity that blinds your eyes

No more face left
No more unrest
No more protest
I don't want to hear your lies
No more resentment
No more rejection
No more deception
I don't want your alibis

To me I swore
There'd be no more
You can't ignore
You are no more
To me...

To me I swore
There'd be no more
You can't ignore
You are no more

Tear one face off the second is there to damn
Bloody fucking flesh from the bleeding of the hands

No more true words
No more voice heard
Nothing to endure
Couldn't spare another day
No more weird moods
No more attitudes
Not even if we could
You know it had to be this way

To me I swore
There'd be no more
You can't ignore
You are no more
To me I swore
There'd be no more
You can't ignore
You are no more
