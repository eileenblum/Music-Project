So you think
That we're all crazy
Can't you see
That I'm already there
What you need
Can't do without it
Can't you see
That I don't even care
I'm on the edge

Pound it out
Twice as loud
I crave the sound - (in darkness no weakness)
Flying free
At full speed
It's what I need - (ears will bleed, what we need)
Work and feed
Off of me
Adrenaline - (arise above, arise above)
Our fuel for life
It's what we like
It's in out blood - (in the blood, in the blood)

Freedom for you
Freedom from pain
Freedom for all
Freedom from this life

Where are you
Here I am
Hidden deep
Out of size and mind
Time flies by
And I'm alive
Alive inside
Inside of all of you
Inside of you

I've paved the way
For all to see
It's all for you - (all for you, bleed for you)
And now I'm lost
And time won't stop
Now that I'm through - (so through, so through)
What you need
Ears will bleed
I'll bleed for you - (bleed for you, all for you)
Don't leave me
I can't see you - (where are you, where are you)

Freedom for you
Freedom from pain
Freedom for all
Freedom from this life

So the twisted one is me
Sad, so bad, sad,
Don't make me laugh
Free from all that is me
Sad, too bad, sad
Freedom

Highs and lows
Effect us all
And crush one's soul
Time and time again
Feel the need
Arise above the pain you feel
Inside us all
And take control

I've paved the way
For all to see
It's all for you - (all for you, all for you)
And now I'm lost
And time won't stop
Now that I'm through - (so through, so through)
No day of rest
No time to guess
Arise above - (arise above, arise above)
Flying free at full speed
It's what I love - (it's what I need, that's why I bleed)

Freedom for you
Freedom from pain
Freedom from all
Freedom
