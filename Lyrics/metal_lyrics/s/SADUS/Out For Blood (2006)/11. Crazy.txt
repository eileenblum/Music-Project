You think you see
You think you see right through me
Distorted eyes see what they like
You think you see
You think you see right through me
Distorted eyes see what it likes

Mind is crazy
Can't cope inside
You can't cage me
I am the night inside you
Inside, inside you, inside...you

Cursed for being born
All that is evil
Seek the fray, killing prey
I am the night inside you
Inside, inside you, inside...you

Do you believe in you or me
Then I believe in you
Do you believe what you can't see
Well what is me is you...you

I don't understand, tell me who you are, you're not me
Are you crazy?
What is insanity? Who is reality? I can't see
We're all crazy
Slowly I'm changing inside
Am I crazy?
I see you see me, how can it be?
What is crazy?
You're all crazy!

Born to rule hell
The heart of evil
Can't change me
Can't cage me
I rule the night inside you
Inside, inside you, inside...you
