Slave..slave..
To obsession of a final goal
How far will one go to the whim of another
Spilling, spilling
Of blood as it takes it's toll
How many will die, until we kill our brother
Signs, signs
A message from above, voices beyond
What type of promises are being sold for lies
Fate, fate
The body will die the spirit moves on
What type of bullshit waits on the other side

New ways of old
Have begun again
Doomed to repeat the past
Another mortal sin
Lies - Feed the fire
That burn our hands
Die for a cause
The ill will of man

In the name of God - To make a stand
In the name of pride - To take more land
In the name of love - To kill a man
In the name of greed - No harmony
In the name of fear - Won't set it free
In the name of hate - Won't let it be

Pray, pray
They sanctify death - not a final act
The only model of poer and glory is the martyr
Die, die
Death brings life to their ultimate cause
Even the young line up to throw their lives away
Fight, fight
When death is in their eyes and the battle rage
For God or country, for fortune or control
Creed, creed
We're not the same, yet they kill for less
Renewing mistakes...some ol' fucking mess

New ways of old
Have begun again
Doomed to repeat the past
Another mortal sin
Lies - Feed the fire
That burn our hands
Die for a cause
The ill will of man

In the name of God - To make a stand
In the name of pride - To take more land
In the name of love - To kill a man
In the name of greed - No harmony
In the name of fear - Won't set it free
In the name of hate - Won't let it be
