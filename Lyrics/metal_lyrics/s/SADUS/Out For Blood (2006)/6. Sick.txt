Uncontrolled thoughts
They told me to kill
I can't help it
I'm not myself
I hate you so hate me
This won't sell
I can't help it
I'm not myself
I'm sick, sick, twisted...
I'm stuck, I'm caught...I can't resist

This is me now
Once again
I can't help it
I can't pretend
Who are you inside now
This can't sell
I can't help it
Can't you tell
I'm sick, sick, twisted...
No thought, no reason, no consequence
Sick, sick, twisted...

Bullet goes in...Brain comes out...
Bullet goes in...Brain comes out...
Bullet goes in...Brain comes out...
Bullet goes in...Shit comes out...

Who am I now
I can't tell
I can't help it
I'm not myself
I hate you so hate me
I don't care
I can't help it
I'm not myself
I'm sick, sick, twisted...
I'm stuck, I'm caught...I can't resist
I'm sick, sick, twisted...

There's too many people in this world
There's too many people fuck this world

Bullet goes in...Brain comes out...
Bullet goes in...Brain comes out...
Bullet goes in...Brain comes out...
Bullet goes in...Shit comes out...

There's too many people in this world
There's too many people fuck this world
