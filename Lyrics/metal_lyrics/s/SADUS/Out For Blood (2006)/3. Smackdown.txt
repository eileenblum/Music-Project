You can't feel what I feel
Can't see what I see
Don't know what I know
You'll never be me, know me
SMACKDOWN
Why are you here? I have no fear
Show me what you hold so dear
I'll smash you, crush you, break you, burn you
SMACKDOWN

When you feel the meltdown
Then you start to breakdown

Show some respect, better come correct, can't eject
What did you expect, twist your neck
You come to face me, disgrace me
SMACKDOWN
Talk'n trash you wanna clash
I'll kick your motherfuckin' ass
There's no way, it's not your day,
so go away, that's what I say
SMACKDOWN

When you feel the meltdown
Then you start to breakdown
Now I lay the smack down

Stand down I'll set your straight
Your weak take has no weight
No gift to communicate
No skill to articulate
SMACKDOWN

This is my show, you want to know
I'll show you where you need to go
I will throw down, take it down
Time for me to break you down
SMACKDOWN

When you feel the meltdown
Then you start to breakdown
Now I lay the smack down

What you've said can't be undone
It was over before you begun
You have lost and I have won
The record shows -- you got run

When you feel the meltdown
Then you start to breakdown
Now I lay the smack down
