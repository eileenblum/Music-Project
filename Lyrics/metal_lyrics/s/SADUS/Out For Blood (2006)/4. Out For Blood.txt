I answer to no one
And make no mistake
Got my thumb on the pulse of the nation
And it's mine to take
A whole new world
is in my eyes
A land of anger
Why must they die?

Out for blood

MURDER...lashing out, the will to kill, to take a life
KILLER.....the one who slays, the blood on hand, the face of man
SINNER.....the word they say, the book obey, damn you man
RULER......the king of man, the will on hand, the one to obey

The weak must abide
With power to break down their pride
Insanity, confusion presides
The weak must fall
With power that threatens us all
The will to kill them all

You can't shut me out
I'm going to get in
Got my eyes on the territory
And what lies within
You pry and pry
I won't let you win
You try and try
I can't give in

Out for blood

MURDER...lashing out, the will to kill, to take a life
KILLER.....the one who slays, the blood on hand, the face of man
SINNER.....the word they say, the book obey, damn you man
RULER......the king of man, the will on hand, the one to obey

The weak must abide
With power to break down their pride
Insanity, confusion presides
The weak must fall
With power that threatens us all
The will to kill them all
