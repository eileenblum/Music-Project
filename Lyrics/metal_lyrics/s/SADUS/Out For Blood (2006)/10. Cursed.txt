"So you think a man can cheat death and outwit doom...?"
"I say a cunning man can cheat death for a long time...?"
He spoke to the curse and nothing more, to set our fate
Cursed to leave, cursed to light, cursed to die

In what words might death call?
Repeat them thrice, that is all
The hooded stranger said those words
All around us no one heard
He spoke the curse and nothing more
To set our fate to the Bleak Shore

In a voice only spoken to us
We must rise and leave at once
To that place where death hunts
A thousand miles have come and gone
And all around life wanes on
Sailing west to the ocean's song
A thousand more will come to pass
But our deaths come at last...
Despite the doom that holds us fast?
Thirty days then cliffs appear
The blackened sands are drawing near
The Bleak Shore and unknown fear

"So you think a man can cheat death and outwit doom...?"
"I say a cunning man can cheat death for a long time...?"
He spoke to the curse and nothing more, to set our fate
Cursed to leave, cursed to light, cursed to die

Bleak Shore...Bleak Shore...Bleak Shore...
In what way might death chance?
Spoken three times, held in trance
Black dead eyes transfixed in space
The bloodless lips part the pale face
He spoke the curse and nothing more
We sail to death to the Bleak Shore

In a voice only spoken to us
We must rise and leave at once
To that place where death hunts
A thousand miles have come and gone
And all around life wanes on
Sailing west to the ocean's song
A thousand more will come to pass
But our deaths come at last...
Despite the doom that holds us fast?
Thirty days then cliffs appear
The blackened sands, unknown fear
The Bleak Shore is why we're here
