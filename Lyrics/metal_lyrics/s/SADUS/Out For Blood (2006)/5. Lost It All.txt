I'm looking right at you
And I know what I'm seeing
Looking into your eyes
Now it's all so revealing
Climbing up the walls
Going straight through the ceiling
Crushing of the skull
Now you can't escape the feeling

You've lost it all
You got no control
Can't cope at all
You've lost it all

Staring mindlessly into
A realm of low esteem
Of what amounts to be
Your sanity; your reality
Taking all that seems to be
What is morality
Never knowing who or why
Believing subconsciously

You've lost it all
You got no control
Can't cope at all
You've lost it all

(You can't save me)...Left alone haunted by the past
(You can't save me)...Future's so unclear nothing left to grasp
(You can't save me)...Corrupted mind unfocused path
All is gone
(It's all wasted)...Can only see two ways to choose
(I can't decide)...Got everything to lose
Save me...You can't save me...Save me...Save me
Save me...Save me...You can't save me...Damn you

Remembering all the people, places
Things that you knew then
Twisting in your memories
Now their ghosts are fading thin
Voices from the past echoing sorrows
To the cold wind
Haunting you, calling you
Again and again

You've lost it all
You got no control
Can't cope at all
You've lost it all
