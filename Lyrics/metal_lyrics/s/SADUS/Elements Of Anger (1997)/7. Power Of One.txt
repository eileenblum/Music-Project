Trust interprets power - Lies may deceive
Behind facial masks - Dominance is achieved
Ruled by one - Unity now strong
Power to behold - Force all control
Wise men will dream - Of the one built to be
Faith in all who believe - Trust now achieved
Face to Face - Raised for today
Just abiding force - Provoked to destroy - DESTROY
Power of one - Power of one - Change has begun - Power of one
Trust interprets strength - All blind to their needs
Open eyes can't see all the lies
Face to face - Raised for today
Just abiding force - Provoked to destroy
Power of one - Power of one - Change has begun - Power of one
