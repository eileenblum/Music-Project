No weak ones - Life goes on - Here I am - There's no end - This is life
No pussies squeak - When life gets tweaked
Stay straight be strong - Stay tight live long
Stronger than life
Pain creates strength - Motivation the growth of all
Now I'm whole I have all the faith I need
Strength through adversity is mine
Pain creates power it motivates us all
The life you make and what you create
Stronger than life you'll be this I can say for me now
I won't backdown - In your face I'll be
I won't backdown - Stronger than life
All weaknesses gone and I am the one
Living my way
Through time the mind grows strong
Leading my way
No pain - No gain - One way - Full strength
No pain - No gain - One way - Insane
Shaping my world for my own way
Who are you to say anything
No pain - No gain - One way - Full strength
No pain - No gain - One way - Insane
No weak ones - Life goes on - Here I am - There's no end
Stronger than life
