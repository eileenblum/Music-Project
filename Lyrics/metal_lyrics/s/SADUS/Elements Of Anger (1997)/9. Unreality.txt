Questions arise from the unknown
Confusion brings curiosity
Whispers come as many regrets they've buried in the past
To witness the unreal... the unreal
A vision unfolds before my eyes
A vision of cold and pale gray skies
Minutes seem like hours
Alone we sit and stare and wait for them to come
To witness the unreal... the unreal
What's false - What's real - Truth is unknown
Serious - Mysterious - Are we alone
Voices from the black call to me
The eyes up in the void watching me
There lies in the skies secrets we seek
They're lies to mystify to keep us week
Echoes of the past reminding me
The lights up in the sky... unreality
