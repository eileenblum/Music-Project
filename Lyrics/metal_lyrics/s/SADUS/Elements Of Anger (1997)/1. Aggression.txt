So are you afraid of me
Stand up for the things you say behind my back
Extreme - Incensed - Enraged... You make me feel aggression
Your words mean squat to me
You've never proven your worth beyond a pile of shit
All I feel is...
Anger rushes through my veins
In no time I'll take you down you will be crushed
Intense - Maddening - Fury... You make me feel aggression
I can't believe all I hear
As for you you'd better prepare to feel my rage
All I am is... aggression
To your face - I am the scorn - In your eyes - I am the thorn
Won't back down
Time is short - Your time is due - I'll be here when you're through
Revenge is mine
All I feel is aggression - All I am is aggression
Your words destroy yourself
You'll go down because of this I'll see to it
Severe - Outrage - Boiling - You make me feel aggression
No light no hope you fall
Vindicated I stand here and watch you fade
All that's left is... aggression
