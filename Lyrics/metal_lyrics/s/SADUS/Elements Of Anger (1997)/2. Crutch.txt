I can't hear but all the screams - Coming down It's how it's been
Leave me now and they'll soon be gone - And if not the way I'll make them then
Find life or do without
Fight all the way slow death
A filthy breed is you and me
A cry out for help that no one sees
Do they scream for you - There's no way run away
Do they scream for you - You can't get away
Pain from within coming out I'm caving in
There's no way out
A lost soul no consciousness casts out itself
There's no way out
The weight is gone - Now live life
It seems you can't go on - It's a hard life
No more pain - Hard every way
Crutch - I can't go on
I can't hear but all the screams - Come down I can't retreat
Leave me now I'll soon be gone - If not the way I'll make them then
Find life or do without
Fight all the way a slow death
A filthy breed is you and me
A cry out for help that can't be seen
Do they scream for you - There's no way run away
Do they scream for you - Can't get away
There's no way out
