Born in this world all alone - Can't even see I'm all alone
Open my eyes to see the light - Cry out for help but no one's there
Morning life - Craving light - Take in all - Watch me grow
In the end - There's no end - In the end - Life begins
One more is born - One more is gone
Life is death - Regenerate and recreate
One done life gone - You will be the one
All you wanted to be trusting me
In the end - There's no end - In the end - Life begins
All you wanted to be trusting me
Life is death - Regenerate and recreate
