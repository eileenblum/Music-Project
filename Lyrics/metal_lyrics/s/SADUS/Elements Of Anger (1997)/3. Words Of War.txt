One look and all were blind - All that have seen
All the pain - It can't live without me
Time is blind - As it runs right over me
All the pain it seems - Seems to find me
One word for you... hate
One step and you're history crushed dead
Wipe you out... deathly blow finishing stroke bloodshed
Homicidal - I am the one executioner of punishment
Hate - Words of war - I create
Prosper until death becomes the words of war
All that you have heard - All that you will find
Weakness by corruption - Pollution of the mind
Death by my say... cruel
No mercy by me - Immolate fate so cold
Bloodthirsty no one escape
The words of hate the world to cry... hate
Words of war I create
Prosper until death becomes the words of war
