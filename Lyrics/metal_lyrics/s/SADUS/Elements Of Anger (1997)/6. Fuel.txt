One way promise me - Hope I disagree
They'll lie inherit me - No honesty now I do agree
Hope - Fear - Desire
My time is their gain
I will achieve despite the inhuman lie again
Faceless - Bastard wins
Fuel by fire
Deception is their tool - A vehicle with no rule
A trust built on emptiness - A covenant of uselessness
No priority above life
We'll do without what they won't do for me
It's they're loss now
Identified by empty hand their gain is me now
Fuel by fire
