You hide behind a mask too confused to show what's real
Plastic sense of value to go with your plastic way of life
Your self-righteousness is corrupted by your tendencies to avoid your lies
Paranoia - Hypocrite - You burn another bridge
"Your self-righteousness is corrupted by your tendencies to avoid
confrontations causing a
fake relationship with the ones who support you and as you burn yet another
bridge you
fall into the trap of becoming a hypocrite of all the accusations you once
slayed me with".
Afraid - Confused - Coward behind the mask
You hide behind a mask too confused to tell the truth
Backwards way of thinking to go with your backward way of life
"You relay a false confidence and a sense of friendly surroundings but behind
closed
doors you burn with hatred and loathing to anyone honest to not provide you
with a
total worship and give you full control which causes you to loose it and go
insane".
Afraid - Confused - Coward behind the mask
How could you not think that I won't even know
How could you not think that I can't even see
How could you not think that I don't even feel
How could I forget the words you said to me
How could I forget the things you took from me
How could I forget the way you were to me
I don't even care who's behind the mask
- don't fucking care who you really are
