Born into a world you vaguely comprehend, truth concealed
Only to contort the essence of your own divinity
Blindly raping and defacing into what will surely be the end of humanity
Â 
This machine will never release its grip, imposing endless fear mongering.
Directing life force into submission
Â 
I will not live this life, bound by their fucking chains
I will not be led astray
Â 
This will bring you to your knees
Â 
Sub dimensional entities take their place in this world
Crushing human life into a paradigm of torturous repression,
Shadow formations of a farce within cosmic perfection
Â 
Resonate within
Â 
The sun is glaring now, drawing closer to the ever bending peak
As this putrid civilization consumes itself alive
Â 
Awake, you erase the doubt within yourself to take your rightful place
We are sovereign perfection illuminating the darkness that surrounds
Â 
Who commands this fatal calamity?
Their binding ties so tight
Thy discord is wrought, a slave to be bought
Â 
Silence the condition to which you fall prey
