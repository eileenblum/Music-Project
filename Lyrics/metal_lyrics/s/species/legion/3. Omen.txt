Casting a shadow, bleeding out ominous light
Its radiant energy suddenly surrounds me
Fractal crystalline geometry, create the fabric of the universe

Violent storm, pounding rain
Pulsing resonance
Symbiosis engage

Beneath this vessel, I am God
Reflection of the perception
Infinite beings of fire and void descending into oblivion

Beneath the sands of time, consciously re-align
Eroding fallacy and deceit, a monument suspended in time

Blinded by ignorance, greed and contempt
Products of an environment seemingly infinite

We come to you now to unveil the axiom and set humanity free

Blacking out the skies, consuming the essence of freedom and life
The serpent will feed upon the fear, its clenching grip dominates all in sight

Through these visions, we radiate
Conflicts arise and perpetuate
Ready now, I await descent

Fear stripped away
I feel the ascension carry me
Premonition now reality
