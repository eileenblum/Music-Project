Bring me the men responsible for the death of my loved ones
Allow me to cleanse the earth of this human scum
Â 
An eye for an eye. May you suffer as they did.
Admit defeat and reap your deeds. There is no escape.
Â 
Burn in eternal pestillence for the atrocities wrought
Enslaving billions, colonizing their very existence.
Â 
Galactic brothers watch from afar, collecting silent rage
On the fence musing repentance for the demon inside of us all
Â 
Dissolving the collective mind, ejecting poision into the skies
Scorching fury shall lead the way unto your impending demise
Â 
Re-program the insanity embeded within the mind
Reach for the core to restore human kind
Â 
We are the seeds bearing eternity
Now is the only time. Perish or redefine
Â 
Adrenal flow, awaken this fucking race
Together we shall eradicate our fear
No longer will it plague my brothers, my sisters
Â 
Collosal Oscillation
Set Me Free
