Rudimentary creatures blood and flesh
You touch my mind, fumbling in ignorance
Incapable of understanding

We impose order on the chaos of organic evolution

You exist because we allow it.
You will end because we demand it.

The pinnacle of evolution and existence
Before us, you are nothing

Your extinction is inevitable
We are the end of everything

The time of our return is coming.
Our numbers will darken the sky of every world

We are eternal

We are legion
