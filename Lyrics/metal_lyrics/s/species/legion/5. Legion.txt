In an era of vile concatenation they struggle violently to fabricate an ascension
They drop like flies for the creation of this chasmic monstrosity
Â 
Neon glow, assimilate the masses
Â 
Spawned by flesh,
Cyber mechanical minds assimilate
Radiate in coagulation
Engaging hyper cognition
All sentient minds intertwine, bestow one consciousness
Â 
But still the wrath of this wretched insanity manipulates all life, carbon beings left to suffer and die a race suspended by this moment in time
Â 
Celestial reflections manifest this infinite reality
Â 
We are energy. We are legion.
Â 
I reach for the stars, to reveal the universe within
And sever the tether, placate the life force that draws us together
The echoes, they call to awaken us all.
Vividly soaring through dimensional planes
Â 
We are Legion
Â 
Ignite the burning rage
Chaos will guide the way
Behold the perfect state
That which you will become
Â 
This is the end of our ravenous repeating spiraling cycle of rampant repression, discordant digression
Â 
The serpents of Gaia behold complete decimation of this human facade!
