Never have I seen thee in these cold rooms of the night
Never felt thy presence amidst the horror and blight
It is but ourselves we have to face in the end
When there are no depths left for us to descend

Gone past the shades of god and the gods of shades
Embraced morbid flesh with brand new blades
Explored dimensions of death in a thousand ways
In this unlife that begun with the end of days

The stage lies abandoned
The actors all gone to their graves
The curtains remain undrawn
and none of us saved...

Bring me my demons!
I am now ready to face
For I have crossed rivers of denial

Bring me my shadows!
Stripped from all traces of grace
I am prepared to begin my trial

Souls long lost and forgotten somehow
Past all life only the dead can save me now

Bring me my demons!
All Hell I am ready to face
Grown so weary from all this denial

Bring me my shadows!
Stripped from all traces of grace
I am now ready to begin my trial

So go and gather all the children of Hell
The story is ending, the book will soon be shelved
This undying final chapter in the tale of our kind
Once it was our world but we gave it to the blind

So go and gather all the children of Hell
The story is ending, the book will soon be shelved

So go and gather all the sons of men left behind
For once it was our world but we gave it to the blind...
