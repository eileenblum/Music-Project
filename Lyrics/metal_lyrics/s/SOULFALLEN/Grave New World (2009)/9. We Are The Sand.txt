"We were the rider and we were the hearse
We were the salvation and we were the curse"

We were the shadows - hidding from the breaking day
And we were the flames - that once burned entire worlds away

Upon our broken dreams we lay our heads
And fall into a slumber deep, with dreams as hard as lead
Tired of the tyrants, drained of tears to weep
We hope the Sun will never wake us
As mankind slowly falls asleep

We were the wind - caressing the Towers of Silence
And we were the storm - that once raged upon the welkin

We were the rain - falling heavy upon the hearts of men
And we were the clouds - that usurped the warmth of the Sun, again and again

Upon our broken dreams we lay our heads
And fall into a slumber deep, we dream among the dead
Tired of this broken soil, the dark beneath our feet
We pray the Sun will never wake us
As life itself falls asleep

We Are The Sand in the hourglass
rushing towards our destined end
We Are The Sand of the ever-growing
desert towards our world descends

We are the sand
We are the storm
We are the wind
of a world outworn

We are the sand
We are the storm
We are the wind
never to be reborn
