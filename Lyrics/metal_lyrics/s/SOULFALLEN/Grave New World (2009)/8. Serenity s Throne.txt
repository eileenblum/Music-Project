At the sundown of a civilization
The night air moves with a dismal tone
In the weakening grip of our infestation
Serenity will reclaim its throne

Today the Sun was not born
Held down by heavy clouds of rain
No light for our last days
Desires long washed away...

I never saw the mountains moving
For me the world was always still
I was held down by the weight of the waters
With heavy stones my heart was always sealed

Tonight the Moon howled with scorn
To a pack of wolves dressed as men
In a flash the stars were reformed
But as soon as I looked again

(I saw...)
What I saw was the end
Yet all still looked the same
No stigmas cast upon men
No pits of brimstone or flame

"Beholding the moors by twilight
Serenity that never came
I realized it was not carved for my name
But neither were the pits of brimstone and flame"

I never saw the mountains moving
For me the world was always still
I never held the keys within me
The prophecies remained unfulfilled

I never saw the Earth in its grandeur
I only saw it on its knees
I never saw a wholesome picture
I only saw it torn piece by piece...
