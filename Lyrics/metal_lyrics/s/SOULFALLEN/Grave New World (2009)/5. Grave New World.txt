A dying wind upon the lifeless
A bleeding soil beneath the slain
Welcome to a world beyond tomorrow
Witness the stillness that haunts the day

Open your eyes to a sight that is foul
Renounce the false hope that only festers the soul:

A world enslaved to a grand design
with the dead leading the blind!

Tear open your dreams, your loss will be nill
Cast no blame upon the coroner for the kill
So leave me be, shine away your Sun
For your world was dead before I begun...

(bury your dreams - bury the world)

So bury your dreams, along with the world
Leave no trace nor mark upon the earth
And let go of this one,
For this world was dead long before I begun...

Open your eyes to a sight that is foul...
And lo. A Grave New World!
