This night another circle closes in a line of thousands
But the beast within us can never evolve
Never can we be more than what is human
And in the cold light our masks dissolve

This night a part of me I leave behind
As naught but few tears remain undrained
And knowing that our hearts will deceive us
Still we choose to stand in the rain

You could always steal the waters from my eye
But our flame never reached the night I hold inside

And these bestial hearts, they can never thaw
It was only the absence of love that you saw

And these bestial hearts, bow down to none
What you saw was no more than a shade
in the absence of the Sun...

No more than thieves
Kings in the arms of night
No more than shadows
Escaping from breaking light...
