"for all men are evil and will always
act according to the wickedness of
their spirits whenever the chance."
[NiccolÃ² Machiavelli]

In the darkened corners of your mind did you ever wonder
That the pain just might be more than you could bear
the the path you chose might tear you asunder
As it led to the fall of all that you once cared

Then reality came,
Unveiled the facade, you felt betrayed
As dreams were torn and a cruel world remained

I never claimed to be a saviour
I never asked to be your god
And your fate will only portray us
At heart what beasts men are...

It was all a dream, and thus it could not last
and the embers forgotten once the light has passed
You never saw it coming, and now it's all too clear
and there's no return for the ghosts are all here

I never claimed to be righteous
I never asked you to crawl
And in this world such a leap of faith
Is soon followed by a fall...

Just remember, that your kind, they'll fall upon you
Like beasts upon their prey
Just remember, that if you let them,
You'll never see another day

So at your last hour
if you need someone to blame
Blame it on the rules
and not the one who played (the game)

I never claimed to be a saviour
I never asked to be your god
Your death will only portray us
At heart what beasts men are...
