"To see a world in a grain of sand,
And a heaven in a wild flower,
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
And eternity in an hour..."
[William Blake]

...but the poet failed
And the carsons withered
No more than earth upon my grave

For what can there be left
of our time bereft
When all but life is slain

And the hours were always against us
Night and day,
could not be bent to prolong our stay

And despite our countless efforts
to dethrone the reign of time
The hour came that we so feared
And now the light escaped my eye
As your words is strength escape my ear

For now I know...

That this is no test of courage
No purpose left for all this pain
To which a fool would only adhere to
When there's no prizes left to claim

And 'neath these ever-longing shadows
Your loving words I cannot hear
For my flame has died
and the beasts are drawing near...

With an expired flame I shan't go on
This time I'll let the swans sing my song...
