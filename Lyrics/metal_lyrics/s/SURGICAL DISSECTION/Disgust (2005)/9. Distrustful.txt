Believe without faith
Adoration without the idol
Love and hate without the reason
Life without living

Who is the idol?
What is the reason?
Where is your faith?
How is your life?

Questions, answers, orders, claims
Requests, commandments
Persons lost in code society
Souls sauntering in the dark

Is there a light somewhere?
Waiting for uncertain result
"I can not give you,
What you deny yourself"
Questions and answers are the same
