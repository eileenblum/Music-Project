I'm sitting in the cell
Of an insane asylum
My doctors are skeptical
Maybe I need another treatment

They will inject me
With another drugs
They will insure me that
One day I will be like the others

But today I'm insane
Everyone's staring at me
Everybody are talking about me
It's not easy to be different

Should I fight against my personality?
Should I change my individuality?
Am I the only of my kind?
Am I really frame of mind?
