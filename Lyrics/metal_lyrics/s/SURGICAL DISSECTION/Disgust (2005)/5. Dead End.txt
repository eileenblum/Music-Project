Distant voices, distant mind
Too far away for my understanding
Abrupt reason of existence
Damned lack of communication

Cry, if you wish, cry or shout
Answer undistinguished by infinity
No response at all
Thank you for your interest

Turn your head to the other side
Try to aim another target
Realize the wall around you
There is no way to escape

Mind catcher broke your will
Is your life real?
Still waiting for some signal
Time has no significance
