Your unaccepted irresistible smile
Draw me crazy for a while
And although our relationship
Was on the way to the fire exit
I risked, that you will hurt me one more
But not least time

Should I kill you aquiel?
Just to find the rest
Of my soul and my mind
It wouldn't be so kind...

You strikingly exotic woman
I wish all my memories of you
Were drained out of me

But I should face the situation
And cut off established emotional links
Cause another attempt to stay with you
Could unravel the tapestry of my life
