The grass is greener on the other side
The problem can be solved differently
The mind must resist
The majority can be wrong

Against the wind mills
Against the conventions
Against the human inhumanity
With me as an only ally

The knights with the swords
The explorers with the ideas
Sangrail must be somewhere over there
Cost doesn't matter

Is the battle already lost?
Is our blood worth to bleed?
Do you want to stop us?
Will you stay in the row?

The field covered with dead intentions
Victory for the strait jacket
But new crusaders are on the way
To not lose themselves
