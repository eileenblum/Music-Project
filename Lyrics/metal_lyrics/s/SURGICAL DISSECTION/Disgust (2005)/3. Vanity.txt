Vanity is all I feel
Empty space, empty rooms in my mind
Dark clouds all around
Sharp sword of ignorance
Is slaughtering my mood

There is no hope, why should be?
But what did I do wrong?
Feeling myself like an ant
Dying in the sweet sugar water

Seeing no perspective at all
Sinking deep inside my pain
Trying to find my lost harmony
Something unknown changed
And I can not define the issue

I need more time to analyse
Or just to forgot it all
But one thing is sure now
She is definitely out of my life
