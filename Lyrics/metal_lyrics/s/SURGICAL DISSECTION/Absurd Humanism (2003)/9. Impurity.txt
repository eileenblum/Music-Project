I see their faces
Every day on television
I hear their neverending lies
Produced by poisoned minds

Remember, you're always a victim
Of those nasty old parasites
With filthy bloody hands and smile
They promise you a paradise

They make a good business
From all our true believes
And wash their dirty money
In blood of their victims
