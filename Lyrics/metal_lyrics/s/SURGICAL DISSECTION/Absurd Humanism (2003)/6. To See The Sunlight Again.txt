Dirty town streets
And there're homeless people
You are scared throughout the night
That you'll never see sunlight again

You say that you've had enough
But on your own you are powerless
Everywhere you look is lethargy
And blood in every
Puddle on the street

No one's innocent
Death became common
You're trying to escape it
It'll get you anyway

You're tripping over while
Searching for the truth
Even thought you feel
You'll never find it

Those who found it are all dead
And that's your fate too

You'd like better world
Without tears and death
You'd like to believe in future
But you'll never reach it
