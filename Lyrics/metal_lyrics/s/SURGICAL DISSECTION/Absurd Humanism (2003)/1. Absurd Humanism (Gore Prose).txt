Absolute reality smudged
In unconsummated pieces just
Extracted casing block
With the faecal sauce of rectum

Rotting chesty sanctuary
Perforated with fresh abscess
Falling down on corpses of exhumed
Clones of birth givers of absurdity

We are cultivating defective embryos
Fed on powder
Made of the meat and bones
Left to cannibalise the fruits
Of humanity afterwards

We are making up
The image of equality
We are activating
The spiral of mutation
We are tearing out
The arteries of harmony
We are planting
In the scheme of absurd humanism
