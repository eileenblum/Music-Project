She wondered as he approached
And stuck two fingers down the front
Of her tiny black elastic pants
He found what he was looking for
And he plugged in, hurting her
Grabbed her breasts
His mouth crushed down on hers
And he bit her lips

He bit them till they bled
He bit them till they bled
He bit them till they bled

The brutality of the way her
Made love to her
No longer shocked or surprised
It was the way dad was these days
He unziped only his fly
And forced himself inside her
With no prelude no gentleness
His hands milking her breasts until
He bent down to bit her nipples too

He bit them till they bled
He bit them till they bled
He bit them till they bled

Startled her by pulling her
Wide by both hands
And plunging inside her for the last time
As he laid on her with last moan
Satisfied, pleased with himself he touched
Her breasts for last time
Never seeing the tears that ran
Slowly from eyes never seeing
The knife beneath the bed
