Standing in the front of mirror
Thinking of the past
Voiceless reflexion of
Painful thoughts

Approaching background
I pant for breath
Red eye veins
Ant-hill instead of brain
Drowning in paranoia

Delusion of life
Making hell on the earth
I'm digging the grave
To bury my mind
To bury my self

There is no way to see
Another day whatever i do
It's always coming back to me
I've lost all the instinct of
Self-preservation
No self-respect
No self-confidence

Delusion...delusion
Delusion...delusion made me suicidal
