What is vowed does not exist
Place reliance in rationality
Use knowledge
For the benefit of humanity
Not for it's destruction
Not for Jesus' fan club
Never get paralysed
By your blind devotion

Your blind devotion
Blind devotion

Bigots of holy see
Certainly own their post
To their brutal actions
So how could it last for long?
No longer choose to
Suffer the consequences
Of your blind devotion!

Your blind devotion
Blind devotion
