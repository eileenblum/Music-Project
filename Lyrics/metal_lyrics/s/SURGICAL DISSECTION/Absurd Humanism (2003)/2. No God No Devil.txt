People just ain't no good
I think that's well understood
You can see it everywhere you look
People just ain't no good

No god up in the sky
No devil beneath the sea
Could do an evil job
That we did

I wish that i was made of stone
So that i would not have to see
A human behaviour
Impossible to define
A human behaviour
Impossible to endure

People just ain't no good
I think that's well understood
You can see it everywhere you look
People just ain't no good
