Pain in the center of your chest
Pain spreading to your arms and neck
Sweating, feeling light headed
Sick or short of breath

What's gonna come next
In the association led by fuckhead
Where brothers cheat on each other
Substit on your powerlessness

Pain in the center of your chest
Pain spreading to your arms and neck
Sweating, feeling light headed
Sick or short of breath

People turn their faces to god
But his face has been turned away
Belief in goodness of god
In spite of the knife in your eye
