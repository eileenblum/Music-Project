It`s the return of the angel which felt from the Sky
His wings are open his fly is high

The taste of blood makes me insane
I feel like a demon in embrace of pain.
In the name of Naamah fucking promised land
By the sword of iron will be buried in the sand
Just give me the blood
To fell my God.
Burn the guts with shit inside
Of living gods from the other side.
Hold your bleeding axe with unreal force
In the name of Satan break the heavens` doors
Cut the wings of angels, burn them in the flame
Dedicate your holy war to the holy name
Satan!!!
