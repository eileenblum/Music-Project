The day of punishment is aproaching
You hear the steps of the master of souls
You dared to say true words and god is watching
At you. And for you church bell tolls.
You have taken the impossible burden
You have fallen to the ground under the cross
Now you know what it means torture
And on your lips you fell bloody froth.
He is looking at you without compession
You are not the only one today
And he stays calm, he has a passion
For waiting from you the word"obey"
And in your prison you know one thing
And about it you extremely think
Today you have a darkest visitor
The great Inquisitor.
He is servant of god he is fighter for his belief
And he is very proud of it
He is judge on the Earth, he is able to give
The salvation of soul instead of infernal heat.
He is not afraid angel of night
Because he thinks that he is right
He doesn`t know that now in medievil
Is coming from There the Kingdom of Evil.
And in your prison you`re waiting the end
Soon you will leave to the dark, unknown land
Last time in your life you have a visitor
The great Inquisitor.
