It was very long ago
When the Flood absorbed the Earth
And the mighty ancient low
Deeped into the Abyss doors
The roaring of the breakers
Muffled the cry of madness
The despair and the fear bear in the tranquil sadness
In this demolishing Chaos
Was quitely standing black sailor
Two hearts with proud and despair
Was looking at the work of the Nailor
One of them screamed with fear
Hearing dead voice of the past
Another staried through the emtiness
Understanding that Temple is lost.
