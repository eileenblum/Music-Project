His ghost dissolves in dust
Formless, dragging heels through the dirt
Small clouds
Mark his passing through the house
Here, not here
Watching his ghost dissolve

In the sun
Here
He hovered, he wavered
Not here
Swollen tongue, cut
In the sun, gone

Air heavy, knotted
Leaden voice echoes

Oh, hollow king
Lord of emptiness
Fear as master

Your rule is null
You have been crowned
Hollow King
Hollow King
