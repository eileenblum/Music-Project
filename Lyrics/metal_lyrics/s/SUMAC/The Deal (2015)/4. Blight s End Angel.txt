Laying prostrate, bent and bruised
Seeking succor from the dust
Feast upon barren fields
Consume decay

Body spoiled by ravaging lust
A barely beating heart, rotting in its tract
Languish, treading muddied waters
A slow death, assured and common

Crippled soul borne aloft
By Blight's End Angel

To know ceaseless light
And endless death
And into love
Forever be reborn
