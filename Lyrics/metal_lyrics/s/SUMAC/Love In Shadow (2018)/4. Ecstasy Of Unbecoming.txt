No utterance from granite tongue
No steps permit a path's retreat
Cast back to open lands
Once so freely roamed

Hover here
A gate between
The dim unseen
And that which lays in light

The gathered howl of spectral hordes
In torrential silent screaming
Behind pinhole pupils black
Beg release through flood and fire

Time is broken
Off its axis
Shards in pinprick constellation

Seek the peace of utter blankness
Intoxicated by the vapors
As the core to ash is turned
