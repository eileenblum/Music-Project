My day did dusk to turn
As you emerged
And in your face
I saw my own
Before years drawn long

From the other side
You came in
And in your gaze
I saw my end
As years draw on
As years draw long

As one into another turned
Iron point in furrowed dirt
From graying hair and aching bones
To supple flesh
And shining eyes

Countenance so bright beheld
A midnight sun dispels the dark
Arcing momentary silver flash
To pierce encroaching night

As flows in you
Our better blood
