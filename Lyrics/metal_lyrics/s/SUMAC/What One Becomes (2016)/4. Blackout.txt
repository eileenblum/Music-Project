Words of summons / Long since blown / Into dust, beyond memory
What remains / Sting of dirt, in eyes / Clotted on wriggling tongue
Under bent cedar / low branches hang / Silent witness / to birth spasms
Bristling beast / Burning hot breath / Odor of violence / stammering wrath //
Ceremony of terrible emergence / Known without lesson / (knelt to pray)
Liberated in worship / devout in practice / delivering the sermon
To a subservient / congregation of one / submission, all must bend
Facade is broken
