In simple sermons it began:/ "You are not yourself, you are me /
There are only these words / and by them shall you live" /
So forged was the mask of thousands / As child's face dissolves /
Who so speaks shall name him / who so calls will bring him
To his knees / "I will dance for you" / behind the mask /
Something small fiercely gleams / all that's needed to claim the light
Is the will to reach
