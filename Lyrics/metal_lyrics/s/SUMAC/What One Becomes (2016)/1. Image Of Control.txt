Turn aside / Steady eyes belie the fear
Small hollow words clatter to the ground
Broken // Ruin has come not fire / or in ashen rain
Only in turgid silence / Hanging. Flayed
Submerged in presence summoned
It expands with reach, filling rooms
Welling up from the tar choked springs
Reeking black star, shining weary light
Bloodied eyes, no tears / Bloodied eyes, no light
Know not to what this moment's owed
Only slipping in shuddering dance
Towards cold radiant dissolve
