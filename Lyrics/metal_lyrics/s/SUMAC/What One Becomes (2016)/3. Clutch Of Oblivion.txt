Sons, weep in mothers arms / To the breast are clinging
From that clutch, by fathers torn / And thrust into the blazing fields
Cheeks still wet with cherubs tears / Across earth unscarred
Heavy blades are drawn / Gouges, fathoms deep / Well with blood //
Father's seed, Mother's seed / Seeds of war, seeds of lust
Tears of pain / Seem as joyous rapture / We claw, we point
At mutilated loins / Faces pushed into the soil, we are cleansed
We are cleansed / In the clutch of oblivion
