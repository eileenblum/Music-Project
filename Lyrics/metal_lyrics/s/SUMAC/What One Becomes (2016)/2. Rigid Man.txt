Behind closed doors / Lanterns sway in pulsing dark
Though the body's near / Rigid man with soiled hands
Cannot touch, cannot feel // Between walls in narrow cell
Glaring light extinguished / cover tender scalp exposed
Rigid man falls to summons, red / Drained and weak
Flaccid body, bent in muddied gutter /
No truth unwrung from its marrow cold
Begs for mercy, for cleansing holy death
Only broken may it pass / into golden dawn / forgiven
