Paranoid, all around is convenience
You know, this sickness is within all of us
There's no trust, no blame, state of mind
Losing it, driven by schizophrenia

Tell me something I don't know
Something to destroy
Is all that I need

Silent conspiracy
Silent conspiracy
Inside my head

Don't know why, I feel my head is judging me
Do you concur with my imaginary friend?
Telling lies, about me, but in reality
You don't exist, you never did it's all a joke to me

Maybe it's time to bring them all
To reality
It's all that we need

Silent conspiracy
Silent conspiracy
Inside my head

Inside my head!
