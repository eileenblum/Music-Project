I'm trapped inside my sickness
Evil memories remain
I know there's no forgiveness
Nothing to relief the pain

Take me underground

Six feet under's not enough
Six feet under's not enough

Take me underground
I wonât make no sound

The time has come to take control
By suicide to take us all

Our clock is running fast and
I'm about to play god
Your life is futile, but your death
Will make it worthwhile

Take me underground

Six feet under's not enough
Six feet under's not enough

Take me underground
But you're coming with me, Yeah!

To save the the world, we must be gone
By suicide, the peace is born

Take my hand and follow
'Cause the world is hollow
Now we feast the maggots
Let them have control!
They have controooool!
