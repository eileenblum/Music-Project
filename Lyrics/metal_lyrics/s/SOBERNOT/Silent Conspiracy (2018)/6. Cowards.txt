Iâm trying so hard to ease the anger,
As my fist's getting hard.
Maybe it's time to release the tension,
Turn your head into my punching bag.

So take a number, your time is cheap
Don't do nothing and pay what they please
More taxes is what I want, until you can't take it no more
So what you gonna do?
Sobernot's gonna show you how!

To destroy
This vanity
It has to end
You've got to be real, bitch

I know that I'm alone
I'm used to that sensation
And I know you fear of me
'Cause you were born to be
Cowards cowards, oh yeah
Cowards cowards, by the hands
Walk through the valley of the death
And take a selfie there
And I'll give you a like
If you end your life.

I'm trying so hard to aim the right one
'Cause you all look-a-like
Selfie this, selfie that
What a crap, man
I think I'm gonna throw up!

In your face
Once again
Your vanity
You have to end it, bitch

I know that I'm alone
I'm used to that sensation
And I know you fear of me
'Cause you were born to be
Cowards cowards, oh yeah
Cowards cowards, by the hands
Walk through the valley of the death
And take a selfie there
And I'll give you a like
If you end your life.
