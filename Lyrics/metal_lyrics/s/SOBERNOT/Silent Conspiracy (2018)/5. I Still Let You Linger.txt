I'm weak when it comes to you
And I know that it won't be long
Afraid, unsure, untrue
Like a sucker punch
I'm me you killed all the hope remained

I'm in too deep
And it's too late to let go
I just can't say no to you

I don't want to see, don't want to know
I still let you linger
Even though your heart is made of stone
Just like before

And I don't care
Everything I lost because of you
My life consumed and I can't get enough of you
My weakness has your name in my eyes
It fade away
