Rip my skin
And now you will know what's underneath
I'm a sin
A poisonous waste is what I bleed
Where to go?
Wherever I set the uncontrol
Kill and let your evil sprout

Hell is near
I'm rendering into what you fear
Can you hear?
The sound of the end is getting clear
Screaming out
Now that you know what pain's about
Kill and let your evil sprout

Now that you know what pain's about
I swear I'll make you shout
Understand there's no breakout
There's nowhere to run
The new world order that you're under
Is what you deserve, now

Turn me on
And talk your way out now just for fun
Now you know
I'm setting my scope right at your flaws
You can cry
At least no one said you never tried
Kill and let your evil sprout

Yeah, the world is turning into madness
The word is out, the paying for your blindness
Hell, you won't believe what's gonna be
One thing I'm sure, I got you on your knees, prick

Now that you know what pain's about
I swear I'll make you shout
Understand there's no breakout
There's nowhere to run
The new world order that you're under
Is what you deserve, now

I'll spill the blood, I've waited too long
But now I'm aching, every time I see
I'll knock it down, the door is mine
Is time to listen, this new way of life
