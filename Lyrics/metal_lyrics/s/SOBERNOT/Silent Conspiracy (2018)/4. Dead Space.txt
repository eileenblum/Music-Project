Can't live another day
Gonna let me kill for free
I'm coming after you
It's better to resist

My instincts tells me how
I'm gonna rip you down.
Tear your soul apart
Gets me high

The only thing that you want me to be
Could get us killed
Let me make this killing spree
A never-ending game

Possession
Discretion
This time your skull gives me an erection

No clues I left behind
Don't care the tears they've cried
I'll tear your soul apart
Every time

The only thing that you want me to be
Could get us killed
Let me make this killing spree
A never ending game

You deserve to be here
We're in the dead space
Nothing left behind
I'm leaving no trace
Now my job is done
The time has come for you all to see
Buried on my yard
You're in the dead space
Maggots all around
You're in a dead place
My masterpiece is done
I'm gonna show you
How you look inside

Can't live another day
Gonna let me kill for free
I'm coming after you
It's better to resist

My instincts tells me how
I'm gonna rip you down
Tear your soul apart
Gets me high
