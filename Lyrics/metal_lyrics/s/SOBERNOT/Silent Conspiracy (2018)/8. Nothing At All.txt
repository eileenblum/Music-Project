Disguised in persistence
Ignoring your surrounding
Now you know what it takes you'll never find it
The lack of precision
Have always bothered me
Throughout the years you'll know what I mean

You want to scream
So let it out
It's not my fault
You know
Nothing at all

Give up and trust
That's not the way
But it's too late to catch up no worth to pray
'Cause in the end
No matter what I say
It is so hard to make you understand

You want to scream
So let it out
It's not my fault
You know
Nothing at all

Nothing at all!

I'm your ego, and I'm lying
Taking over your brain
Bursting power, hear the calling
Say goodbye to this so called life

You want to scream
So let it out
It's not my fault
You know
Nothing at all

Nothing at all

I divide
Your dreams from your miserable reality
You bring me down
And from my perspective
It's all to easy
You're like all the rest
Showing off but you're fuckin' lazy

You've got to be crazy
You know
I know you won't make it
You're way to lazy
I'm sick and tired of
You're cutted off!

You want to scream
So let it out
It's not my fault
You know
Nothing at all
