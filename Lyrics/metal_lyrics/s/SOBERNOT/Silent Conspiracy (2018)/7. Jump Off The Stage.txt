Lights out!
And the coldness of an empty place
I don't care to rehearse on a stage
And we don't care if we don't get paid
'Cause in the end we're gonna thrash your face

Can I trust in your weightless words?
Will I see you diving into a mosh
We know the answer, you ain't got no balls
You sold your soul to a stranger

You! You are a traitor
And I'm sick of this fucking gig
You! You are a traitor
And there's no place where we belong
My! My generation
A bunch of fakers fulls of shit
Why! This generation
Will never have the will to live?!

They tried to lead us to extinction
They bailed us faster than you do
An insect dressed up in silk suit
There's no lighted stage
Everybody get around, fight for imitation

I see this crowd standin' still
Drained up of all we know and feel
I'll jump off the stage
And throw you by myself to the mosh
'Cause you're a pussy!

You! You are a traitor
And I'm sick of this fucking gig
You! You are a traitor
And there's no place where we belong
My! My generation
A bunch of fakers fulls of shit
Why! This generation
Will never have the will to live?!

Will I weightless words?
Will I see you diving into a mosh
Ha ha ha, now, we know the answer, you sold your soul!

You! You are a traitor
And I'm sick of this fucking gig
You! You are a traitor
And there's no place where we belong
My! My generation
A bunch of fakers fulls of shit
Why! This generation
Will never have the will to live?!
