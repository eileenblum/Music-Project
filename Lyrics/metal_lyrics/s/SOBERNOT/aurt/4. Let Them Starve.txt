[Music &amp; lyrics are by Pablo LaâRonde]

Sit down and complain
All your patterns are the same
All the pain is in vain
With no money and no fame

This is the final road
Iâll make you feel unborn
Youâll see the empire down
Weâre laughing all around

Canât control my inner absentia
I know what's gonna be
Embracing my dementia
All my life Iâve been taught to be a king
So I donât give a shit about your ways to be, yeah

The gallows pole's ahead
Is waiting for your neck
And waiting for some others

[Chorus:]
Kill the politicians
Let them starve
Let them be tortured
By all this crowd
Kill the politics
And all of their fucking sons
Justice has come for you all

Why the fuck is everybody blind?
Getting fat on the couch
Waiting for their prime
Can the pope put his hands out of this child?
We wonât take any more of your denials

The gallows pole's ahead
Is waiting for your neck
And waiting for some others
Erase them from the map
Be conscious with your mind
The price they have to pay

In your conscience now fall
In your conscience fall

[Chorus]
