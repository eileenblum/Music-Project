[Music &amp; lyrics are by Pablo LaâRonde]

Staring right at you
It ain't that easy to endure
Now you must shut your trap
To hear your words can get me hard

Find a place / to get no sleep
Pretend to live / just as you wish
Beneath your scars / is my way in
Well, turn off my sanity

Insanity
We're gonna live
As far as you can see
Wondering endlessly
What makes you a cold bitch

You know what we could be
Drifting away on trip
But you're too blind to see
'Cause you're a cold bitch

I'll turn your pain into pleasure, oh yeah
This might be your new obsession, fuck yeah
I always knew you were nasty, plastic, bitch
Right now you are my insanity

I think I'm gonna be
Wondering endlessly
What makes you a cold bitch

You know what we could be
Drifting away on trip
But you're too blind to see
'Cause you're a cold bitch

You know what we could be
Drifting away on trip
But you're too blind to see

'Cause you're a cold bitch, yeah
Insanity we're gonna live
As far as you can see
Wondering endlessly
What makes you a cold bitch
You know what we could be
Drifting away on trip
But you're too blind to see
'Cause you're a cold bitch

Make it up
Wake me up
Where's your god?
To pray for this to never stop

Make it up
Wake me up
Where's your god?
Now that you're sitting on my cock
