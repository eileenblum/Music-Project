[Music and lyrics are by Pablo LaâRonde]

I don't believe in none of the things that you do
You know, I never will
The pursuit of god is just an excuse
For people just like you

[Pre-chorus:]
Lay low and hide from your god
Do what you want to do
In time you'll see the truth
And all your wasted time

[Chorus:]
Wasted time
In your mind
All the lies
Paradise

Tell me how the fuck can you submit to this?
It ain't no way to live
To a cross you mesmerize
Until you're paralyzed
I'm afraid you're going to die

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

They're living in blindness
Brainwashed and mindless
Superstitious
Here's the second coming
On your face drops falling
Warm and sour
Filled with love from god

[Chorus]
