[Music &amp; lyrics are by Pablo LaâRonde]

Can't live another day
Gonna let me kill for free
Iâm coming after you
Itâs better to resist
My instincts tell me how
Iâm gonna rip you down
Tear your soul apart
Gets me high

[Chorus:]
The only thing that you want me to be
Could get us killed
Let me make this killing spree
A never-ending game

Possession discretion
This time your skull is my erection

No clues I left behind
Don't care the tears they've cried
I'll tear your souls apart every time

[Chorus]

The only thing that you want me to be
The only thing that you want me to be, yeah!

You deserve to be here / we're in the dead space
Nothing left behind / Iâm leaving no trace
Now my job is done / the time has come for you all to see
Buried on my yard / you're in the dead space
Maggots all around / you're in a dead place
My masterpiece is done / Iâm gonna show you how you look inside

Can't live another day
Gonna let me kill for free
Iâm coming after you
It's better to resist
My instincts tell me how
I'm gonna rip you down
Tear your soul apart
Gets me high
