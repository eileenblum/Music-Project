We try to break the speed of sound
We're coming from underground heaven is taken for granted
Never take no for an answer 'cause we know so much better
Funny how things look so easy

Stuck in rock, let it be written
Stuck in rock, let it be done
Stuck in rock, it shall be written
Stuck in rock, and it will be done

For the young that live to rock
We were born and we can't be stopped
Our destiny lies in the future
We're not toys to be played with, rules are made to be broken
Don't ever say never again

[Repeat Chorus]

"And as they sang all through the night
The stars are dancing in delight
Their voices riding with the wind
Echoing the songs across the land..."

Steadily searching to be young at heart
Ready for action like a loaded gun
You're looking for trouble you're looking for me
Satisfaction guaranteed

[Repeat Chorus]
