Wake up at night to find
There's people in my head
And everybody's screaming "Let me out !"
It's like a pounding drum a beat that never ends
And now I'll take a chance to shout it out

Outta control I'm outta control
I'm ready to rock I'm ready to roll
Outta control, outta control, outta control

Breaking the speed of sound
I'm racing with myself soul and blood are running in
my skin
I've got no time to waste, no chance to hesitate
If I don't find a way I'm going to explode

[Repeat Chorus]

Wake up at night to find
I'm lying in my bed
And all the voices are screaming, "gotta get out"
No chance to hesitate, I've got no time to waste
If I don't find a way I'm going to explode

[Repeat Chorus]
