No fear of danger take before you give
Fight to survive you ride to live
Out of the night that's where you appear
Long hair with leather and nothing to fear
Free as the wind you are bright as a light
Metal machine will guide you tonight
Shining steel meets your desire
Follow the wheel the wheels of fire

Follow the wheel the wheels of fire
Follow the wheel the wheels of fire

Don't take no prisoners don't spare no lives
You know the answer it's wrong but it's right
Can you believe when you hear them say
Betray your god and hell you will pay
Free as the wind you are bright as a light
Metal machine just guides you tonight

[Repeat Chorus]
