Don't forget to say your prayers
Cause someone from above is watching you
You gotta know what to do

Saddened souls just go about
Someday a savior will guide them out to heaven
Or maybe to hell

Run, fight
For what you believe
One day you will be
Children of Heaven

You lived your life without the sword
And now the blade is coming down on you
No mercy from death

In this void there is a light
But still the darkness rules this endless night

Run, hide
Into the light
It's coming to take you away
Children of hell
