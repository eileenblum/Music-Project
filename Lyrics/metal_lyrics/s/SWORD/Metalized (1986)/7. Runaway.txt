Lost in the dark, alone and weak
Left here forever, is it real, or just a crazy dream
Out on my own, I'll kill to live
Born from a nightmare, life is just a living hell

Runaway, live today, and break the evil spell
Pay the price, rule the night

Blackening dream, twisting my mind
I'm going faster, everyday I'm killing time
If you see me riding with fear
Don't try to stop me, I'm spinning like a wheel

Runaway, die today, break the evil spell
Pay the price, rule the night

Lost and alone, I'm feeling weak
Left here forever with just my lonely dream
Out of the dark, I'll kill to live
Born from a night mare, life is just a living hell
