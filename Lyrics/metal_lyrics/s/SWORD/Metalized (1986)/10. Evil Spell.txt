No one can tell me what to think of you
You bring the power of merciful truth
From your great heaven you curse and you spell
You let people think that your home is in hell

[Chorus (x4):]
Under evil evil spell

You feel the heat and you shed all your tears
You hide behind all your curtains of fear
No you can't run no you can't run away
The curse is on you now it's there to stay

[Chorus x4]

Looking through eyes that deceive what they see
Gazing in darkness and pointing at me
It's not your mind but your soul that you'll give
And you will be evil as long as you live

Under evil evil spell
