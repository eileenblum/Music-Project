I'm going mental, it's driving me wild
I can't make it I just can't deny it
I've been racing the devil, for a long long time
He wants to get me, they say my hell is on fire

And I don't know where to hide
Will I live will I die, I don't know where to hide

I'm running scared against the time
I think I'll keep on rolling, just keep on rocking
But will I make it will I survive
It's getting closer, the weight on my shoulder

And I don't know where to hide
Will I live will I die, I don't know where to hide

My soul is on the line
I shall repent
For those who died, for those who died
