In my times of loneliness I'm wondering
What came over me the sight of the light
My life's a nightmare every time I open my eyes
It makes me wanna fall to sleep blinded by the morning sun

[Chorus:]
Sweet dream lonely night
Sweet dream another lonely night, so lonely

Take the past it's just a dream
Reality is present and fiction's not clear
Take my hand I'll show you the way
I don't care if I'm wrong or right
As long as I set my sweet dreams tonight

[Chorus]

In my life I feel despair every day but you can't see
My eyes filling with tears
Broken dreams from an endless night
Reborn from the ashes of a previous life

[Chorus]
