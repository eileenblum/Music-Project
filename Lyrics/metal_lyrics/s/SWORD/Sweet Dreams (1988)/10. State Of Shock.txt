All day long I'm pushed around I just can't take this shoving anymore
Life ain't fun when passion is none day passes by so very slow

State of shock breaks apart my sanity to pieces
Makes me feel so unreal got me in a barrelhouse
State of shock

The same old story happens every day
A dream comes by and then... ah take it away
It makes me realize that more is maybe less
And number one's the best fuck all the rest

State of shock breaks apart my sanity to pieces
Makes me feel so unreal got me in a barrelhouse
State of shock

Hey where is everybody going?

I'll tell you once then again I'll tell you twice
This state of mind won't take us to paradise
So turn on the power keep it for yourself
One must learn to live in self defense
