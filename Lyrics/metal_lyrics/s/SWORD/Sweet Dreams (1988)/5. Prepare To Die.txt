I've been wondering why when I look to the sky
Everything seems to be fading
And the feeling I get when I try to forget
All of those things will drive me mad

[Chorus:]
Close your eyes you will see you've got no choice just let it be
And rise above the earth and sky fall into the abyss of night
Prepare to die

Every day of my life is a long endless night
Fear of the dark will make me scream
This nightmare will end when my time is close at hand
Thy spirit of death will make me rise

[Chorus]

There's a beast in my dream and it's pointing right at me
Got an evil stare into its eyes
Makes me lose my mind I hope that someday I will find
The perfect time for me to leave

[Chorus]
