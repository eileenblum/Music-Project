Sent out to war in the middle of nowhere
Licensed to kill and a long way from home

War slaughters the earth
War you're sent to the front
And your life is fading away
There's no coming back so prepare for the final attack

This child unborn holds a terrible curse
Where time stands still he's a soldier at work

War slaughters the heart
War sent to the front
And your life is fading away
There's no coming back you'll die in the land of the brave
In the land of the brave it's the land of the grave

And now the end has become part of us
The earth is black and the battle is lost

War surrenders the earth
War sent to the front
And your life is fading away
There's no coming back we all die in the land of the brave
It's the land of the grave
No coming back so prepare for the final attack
