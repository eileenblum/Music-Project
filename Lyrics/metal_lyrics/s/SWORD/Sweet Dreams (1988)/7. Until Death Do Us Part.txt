A time to live a time to die
And one to cherish your precious life
One chance to win you're born to lose
One day you're going to pay

Pay with the days of your life
Pray until death do us part

You laugh about eternal life
The secrecy you believe in
Afraid to run don't look behind
You can't escape from yourself, no way

So ride with your fears in your heart
And pray until death do us part
Fear's in your heart 'till death do us part

You hear the sound of a distant scream
The voice of heaven is calling
Dark as the night you're cold as ice
And now you shall rest in peace
Ride through the deep of the night
And pray until death do us part
