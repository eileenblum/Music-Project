They say they have come to save the world
Maybe they will I'll bet you they won't
They carry a crucifix deceiving the weak delivering the wrong

[Chorus:]
Back off preacher stay away
Don't you know hell is to pay
Back off don't hang around here no more
Back off you got wicked ways with law

The devil sells you ever more
And you will give and they will take
Until you're old enough to die

[Chorus]

You know my brother you have sinned
But it's alright you're old and you're wise
From the beginning 'till the end your truth is a lie
Your fate is in the sky

Back off preacher stay away
Don't you know hell is to pay
We don't need your stupid lies
Don't victimize us, stop

Back off don't hang around here no more
Back off you got wicked ways with law
