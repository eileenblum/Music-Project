You've got the right to remain silent
But anything you do and say will be held against you
You've got the time to do some thinking boy
You know you have been caught in the act
Breaking the rules

And now they'll break you no one will save you
Rot in your cell. It's a living nightmare and you better beware
Cause one day you'll wish you were dead

It's hard to be free when our sick society is caught in the act
You're breaking the rules and you're living like a fool
Who's caught in a trap

They build the wall around the prisoner
And lock the door then throw away the key
Confined in darkness 'till the sunrise
You're a victim of your crime criminal in your mind

And now they'll break you no one will save you
Rot in your cell. It's a living nightmare you were warned to beware
And now you wish you were dead

It's hard to be free when our sick society is caught in the act
You're breaking the rules and you're living like a fool
Who's caught in the act

You live a life of no tomorrow
And build your dreams with hatred and revenge
So many years will go behind you
You're a king without a throne a drifter on your own

No one will break you no one will touch you
You'll break by yourself
You're a living nightmare we were warned to beware
And now that you wish you were dead

It's hard to be free when our sick society is caught in the act
You're breaking the rules you're living like a fool
You're caught in a trap
Don't try to understand, run away, run away
