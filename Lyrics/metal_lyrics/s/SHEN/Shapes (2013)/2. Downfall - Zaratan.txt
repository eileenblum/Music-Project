Craving power, never satisfied,
Island gained, hunger fed.

One fear, Zaratan [2x]

I felt an omen, they lighted a fire,
We sought a colony, we found a nightmare

One fear, Zaratan [2x]

We're awakening his wrath
Predestinated to drown
Falling to the deep

The fire reached its back bone
And the ground shook
The beast immersed itself
And we fell in the deep
The prophecy is achieved
The nature arose
Against our cruel depletion
Untaming, the elements rage, the sunset
Collapsed
Sunk with our hands
Our useless obstinacy condemn ourselves
The nature will crush us,
Our faith is written

We're awakening his wrath
Predestinated to drown
Falling to the deep
Trapped in the water cage
Buried under the sea
