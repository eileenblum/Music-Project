Chained to rocks,
without remorse,
The sentence to serve
Made myself a man

I've given them the fire
I've given them the shape,
Omnipotence is nothing compared to the progress.

My gift will shine,
Unleashing your envy.

Hide your egoism,
Condemning my compassion,

Rise
Can you hear my voice?
The eagle my torment you abstracted my sacrifice
Your can save me, and drag me to your world
Praying, blessing a foreign god

Without a name, you left me here, without any recognition
Empty hearts pray your vileness, you're only a deaf comfort.
The vulture, rocks and fucking chains
The blood dripping from my veins, 
Suffering won't change my hate.
I damn you now!
Careless of your creation, 
Abandoned in vices and shame.

Sleepless agony
Painful Dream

I give you back my deity

Rise
Can you hear my voice?
The eagle my torment you abstracted my sacrifice
Your can save me, and drag me to your world
Praying, blessing a foreign god

Voiceless corpses living an apparent life, 
Without a shape, without a soul.
