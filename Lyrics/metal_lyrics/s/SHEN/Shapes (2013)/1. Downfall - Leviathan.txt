Aurora rises at the end of the sea,
He wages the sky, eating the stars,
I'm feeling safe on the deck of this ship
But i heat a growl, like thousand cannon shots

Dark shadows eclipse the suns,
A mystic voice devours our souls (devours our souls)
A sea storm never seen before
I'm not safe, no more

Our wreck has come,
Spirits threw their spells,
Running through the underworlds, heralds of cruel pain.
Only God could tame his bloody strength,
Like a killer wave, he breaks our breaths.

LEVIATHAN

The audacity of our brutal sins faced up to God, 
An apocalypse to erase all wars;
Our hearth soaked in blood, pierced by weapons,
Destroyed by envy, ruled by beasts.

Emptiness, nastiness burn human reason,
Greedy of gold, we lost our souls, all absorbed in our faults
Farewell your illusions!

We all deserve this condition
No pity for our affliction
We weren't created as thicks
But we rejected this gift,
We abandoned the justice,
Contracting ourselves!

Dark shadows eclipse the suns,
A mystic voice devours our souls (devours our souls)
A sea storm never seen before
I'm not safe, no more

Emptiness, nastiness burn human reason,
Greedy of gold, we lost our souls, all absorbed in our faults
