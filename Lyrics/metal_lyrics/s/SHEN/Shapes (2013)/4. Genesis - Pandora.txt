The plague that destroyed the world

Created by grace, beautiful soul, all the qualities were given to you,
Uncontaminated, deceived by gods, you destroyed the age of the gold

What have you done?

I always said to you not to trust in the gift of proud gods, but you didn't

Now you hold in your hands our diseases,
You hold in your hands our faith,
an heavy burden [2x]

Bent by your illusion, now you're crawling
Pushed by inquisitiveness you open the cursed jar
Dreadful spirits walk now on the earth,
Slowly collapses swallowed by evil,
The avidity raids the soil,
envenoming human blood.

This is the oldness that blinds our hearts, accompanied by death,
Ruthless sickle, she takes our lives, all that remains is pray for hope

Let the hope heal the wounds that we bared
Let us come to a new life

Let us come to a new life
What you feel?
Take us back to our world

Eternal

Let it fade.
