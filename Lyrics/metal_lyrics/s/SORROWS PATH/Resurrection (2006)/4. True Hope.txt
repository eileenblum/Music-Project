[1995]

I am isolated disgusted by their hate
From my birth was banished away to die in the decay
I understood that my purposes were fulfilled lies
Nobody in the earth can see through my sad eyes

[Pre-chorus]
Rules surround my every step and steal my breath
Eyes of hate turn my life to look like death
Emptiness distorts my good dreams into horror scenes
Please now hear to my screams

[Chorus]
Search in your heart and find your idol
Nothing can steal your last true hope
Kill hate with love, for truth crucify yourself
Nothing can steal your last true hope

Friend, Iâm weak to transcend from this hell and Iâm betrayed now
The account of my acts can make me feel so low
This cussed parody asphyxiates and wants to expire
Suicide is in this life the only act for me

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Deep into our hearts thereâs sorrow âcause our dreams canât be true
Thoughts of pain around like a plague weâll never win
As the sorrow imprisons us into a circle of despair
Then we think that life is not worth a dime, ohâ¦

I am isolated disgusted by their hate
From my birth was banished away to die in the decay
I understood that my purposes were fulfilled lies
Nobody in the earth can see through my sad eyes

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
