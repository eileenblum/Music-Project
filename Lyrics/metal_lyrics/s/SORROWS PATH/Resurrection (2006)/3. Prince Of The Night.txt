[1995]

These nights I open my mind
I close my eyes and goes to these places
I see a world different
The spirit of gladness gives smiles to faces
Spirit of the liberty flies on the air
I feel so, so worth, because I can go there

[Chorus]
I would like to be there tonight
I want, with lust I want to feel the spirit
Maybe Iâm a crazy dreamer
But I want to be the prince of night

As Iâm looking the skies
I have a feeling that fills my soul
Thereâs something in my eyes
Iâve had a feeling that fills a hole
In this world of hopes and fears
Oh, come on my friend and letâs get near

[Chorus]
You will see, our world is gonna change
All the things will be like there
We are so strong, we have power
And weâll become princes of the night

[Chorus]
