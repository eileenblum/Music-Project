[1995]

My mind it was flying in a river of white blood
We kept them and drink them as wine
Wine which has the power to send you up
Up to the gardens filled with people shine
My mind it was flying in a river of white blood
We kept them and drink them as wine
It will be easier for us to fly
But like people we will stay and sly

[Pre-chorus]
Flowers who react just like people
People who react just like flowers

[Chorus]
Turning their broken necks for freedom
They want to touch everything and feel

The place where we touch the sun with our hands
The place where naked lovers go
Bugs and rats were coming out from our hearts
Harmless and unable they donât know what to do
The place where we touch the sun with our hands
The place where naked lovers go
It will be easier for us to fly
But like people we will stay and sly

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus x2]
