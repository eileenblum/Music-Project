[1995]

It was a nice afternoon like all the others
Some people like to go out with some partners
I was sitting in my room thinking for my problem
What am I going to do in my future?
It started when I was at school some friends didnât like it
My head was in terrible pain I didnât understand it
I didnât know whatâs gonna be but I felt it inside me
So I decided to do something about it

[Pre-chorus]
Doctor said, you have now to calm down
Thereâs nothing wrong with your brain
But heâs nothing except from a blind
Doctor said, you have now to calm down
Thereâs nothing wrong with your brain;
Heâs a blind

[Chorus]
Oh, I would like to be a flower
I could avoid my terrible thought
Free in this life I could be
Nothing to care for
[Backing vocals: Iâm alone]

The crisis started to come back more often than before
I couldnât find words to speak to my âlordâ
My parents started to lock me when they werenât at home
Oh, I hate them like I never did before

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-chorus]
So I stay every night at home
Without joy and partner
What else can I do myself
So I stay every night at home
Without joy and partner
What else

[Chorus]
