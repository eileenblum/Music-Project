[1996]

Now, itâs time to welcome your thought
Iâll become your living coffin
You will curse the time when my eyes
Saw the body that you borrow from me
See, your body is disappeared
Now your thought is inside me
I cannot control my bodyâ¦

[Bridge]
When Morpheus takes you in his arms
I can feel my existence
When Morpheus takes you in his arms
I can speak to you

[Chorus]
Two minds are fighting for a body
Who will win after that?
Talking into a morbid dream
Who could believe itâs not a lie?

Now, our human logic is false
Weâre too small, but so egotist
Now our human logic is falseâ¦

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

In this empty dream my fateâs the same with your own
The narrow-minded people live their hypnosis of lies
When theyâll see the truth theyâll believe, yes, theyâll believe

[Chorus x2]
