I canât avoid this deadly pain
My body hurts by all my crimes
I have to break the silence
But itâs impossible for me to speak
When I lay down to sleep
I remember these dreams
Why they canât be reality?
I need some pleasure without pain

The darkness calls my soul, my desires lost in the void
Iâve found the emptiness and I drowned into my tears
So is the fate of man, his desires bring pain
He canât escape this circle, communion he must find

I donât recognize myself
I cry without a logical reason
When Iâm trying to find new lands
The death doors open for me wide
How far goes the journey?
Disappointed Iâve reached the end
Is there justice, who decides?
The only answer is total darkness

Give me riches, I wanna rule
Oh, Iâm famous, look at me
You dirty whore, suck me, ahâ¦.
Iâm wise, my spirit is very strong
Will I marry a beautiful rich man?
I want to be the mistress of their minds, a ha!!!
