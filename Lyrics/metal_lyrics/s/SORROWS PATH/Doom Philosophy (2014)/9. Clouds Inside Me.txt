I took this thought and I made flesh
A dirty flesh that scared my mind again
I paid the price for my little self
A heavy price that filled my mind with pain
Painâ¦heavyâ¦pain

Waiting for me, I lost myself
Where I must go?
Waiting from me, I lost my mind
What can I do?

Clouds have killed my beliefs and I think that theyâre not mine
All the promises were just narcissistic lies
I donât belong to myself; they came and stole my life
How can I die, to exist no more?

I spoke to me and I laughed alone
A bitter laugh that made me cry again
I searched for me and I found a black hole
A big black hole that swallowed my last dreams
Deadâ¦shatteredâ¦dreams
