A tragedy is a lesson for the wise
Donât cry for me, Iâll give you a nice surprise

A dead corpse, no hero
A dirty worm, true zero
A dim light, thatâs dying
Iâm bleeding in pain

When I met my grey destiny
I just laughed for my demise
My philosophy awoke
And I stood this deadly price

I die alone, my power is so huge
Give me more pain to heal my deeper wounds

When I met my grey destiny
I just laughed for my demise
My philosophy awoke
All my troubles were so nice

When I met my grey destiny
I just laughed for my demise
My philosophy awoke
It was a lesson for the wise
