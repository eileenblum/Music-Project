As Iâm looking through my life, all my past deeds
I enjoy my clear conscience, but they tore me down
Iâd found chains in place of wood
My cradle was my prison
My silent sigh goes to my father
For all the tears Iâve shed

Iâve been killed a thousand times
A life full of wounds
I took the blame for every mistake done
The pain was all mine

Iâm the king with a crown of thorns
The troubadour of life and death
Never lived, I was never born
Reaching sympathy to the end
Iâm the king with a crown of thorns
Thereâs no need for revenge
Not a cancer on the earth
The only outcast of fate

Iâve tasted milk from poisonous breasts
They raped my mother Mary
My silent vow goes to my father
To bring a new dawn

Ohâ¦.The king with a crown of thorns

Donât try to kill me now, Iâm immortal
Iâve passed the test of death
Bow to me and cry loud and clear
âYou are our Masterâ
