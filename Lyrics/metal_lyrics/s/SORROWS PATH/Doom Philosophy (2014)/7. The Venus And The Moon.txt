You promised gold to exchange my soul
You want to guide my destiny
 Promised money, fame, power
You never think who I am

You promised servants and sad slaves
So I can rule their destiny
Captured hearts that call my name
You never think who I am

The gates of my heaven have opened for me
The Venus and the Moon made me strong and free

Iâm strong and please donât cry for me
Iâll never hurt you âcause I will bleed
Take your goods away from me
You never think who I am

Go away!
Out of my way!

Iâm strong and please donât cry for me
Iâll never hurt you âcause I will bleed
Take your goods away from me
Youâll never know who I am

The gates of my heaven have opened for me
Your venom and your lies made me strong and free
