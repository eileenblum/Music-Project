Come to me brother and friend
Tell me what you feel up there
The time pass so weâll meet again
I donât believe that youâre not here

Wake up my brother of life
Stand up from the black you lie
Wake up but I know you canât
Because you breathe hard in the dark

Hungry minds for loyal souls
Theyâre wanting yours to take it away
A manâs mistake cost your life
And you wonât ride again your love

Be strong my bro and your soul will be free
From the sea of black and blank
So you can ride again

Wake up my brother of life
Stand up from the black you lie
Wake up and I know you can
Because you will ride to life again

God bless your soul my brotherâ¦
