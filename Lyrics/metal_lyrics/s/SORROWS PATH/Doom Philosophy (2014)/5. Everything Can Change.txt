I see your thirst for my blood
Your empty look gives me hell
A distant friendship comes back again
A bloody breath reminds death

Today I see a new horizon for your Majesty
I understood that everything can change

My holes opened, I am trembling now
I'm longing for your sweet pain
Your macabre treasures shoot me high
A lustful sarcasm foretells the end

Today I see a new horizon for your Majesty
I understood that everything can change

The strong mind manipulates the fate
There's no control for the thought

[2x]
Today I see a new horizon for your Majesty
I understood that everything can change

Wrath
Greed
Sloth
Pride
Lust
Envy
Gluttony

Everything can change

[Spoken:]
Once I was a ruler, the almighty
And I used to take pleasure in torturing themâ¦
But what the hell?â¦now that I am diminishedâ¦
Now that my nerves and my whole lifeblood are almost exhaustedâ¦
On this morbid moment, I am tasting the biggest lust Iâve ever feltâ¦
The lust from my demise!
