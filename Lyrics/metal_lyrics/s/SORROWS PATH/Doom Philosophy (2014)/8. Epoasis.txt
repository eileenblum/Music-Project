Filthy rags, worn and torn apart...
Lost in thoughts of mine...I can't be sure
Shivering in trance...
As my descent comes to an end
Redemption...this can't be for real
Awaken mesmerized...by the magnitude of loss

Feel!

Muted words of wisdom, float around the dream
You should pay attention, they could set you free

And It grows stronger and stronger
As you feed It with lies and your greed
And It poisons the plane all around you
Your mind belongs to It

Laid eggs of hatred, a truth beyond belief
Hidden seeds of mankind, children to a dead tree

It turns darker and darker
As you feed It with lies and greed
And It poisons your mouth and your thinking
Your eyes appeal to It

These are the stories of the failed
The passion turns into dust
Burst into tears with a laugh
Abstract pictures of your lost
