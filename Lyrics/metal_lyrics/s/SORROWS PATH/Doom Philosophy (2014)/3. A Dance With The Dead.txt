Itâs not a filthy mirage or a dark lie
The corpses dance with men, a dance of lust and pain

No one could understand this deadly sin
Iâll please my mind to forget the images I see

We crave for this dirty dance, a morbid fantasy
Weâve seen it in our dreams, in our sickest dreams

The dance with the dead will steal your last breath
Youâll pray for the end, now believeâ¦
The dance with the dead, a passport to hell
Youâll pray for the end, now believeâ¦

Yes, yesâ¦believe!

Death is not the biggest curse as I see now
These scenes I canât describe, please let me leave

I know weâre sick, psychotics full of pain
This price we have to pay, Iâll pray this time to come

Dance, macabre dance

Believe!
The dance with the dead
