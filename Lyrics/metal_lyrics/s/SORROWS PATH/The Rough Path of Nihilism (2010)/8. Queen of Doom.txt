My soul was left alone
My feelings were stabbed up
I was dying in emptiness 
And loneliness was my only friend

Her deadly curse upon me
Her awful deadly words
Message for my certain death
From the being which was my only thought

She was the queen of my heart
One day she gave me love
Nowâs laughing, speaking words of death
She wants to give me an end

I am sodomized by her
I feel my own confusion
The lesson of her paranoia
Is the omen for my death

You are the queen of doom 
You can steal my life away
And in the night if Iâll fall
You will come to take my soul
You are the queen of my doom

A wicked mind I face
When Iâm thinking of her
My fate played her game
And I failed to my choice again

Now itâs not the same
I have to face my doom
So addicted to her power
And she wants to give me an end

You were the queen of my heart
One day you gave me love
Now youâre laughing, speaking words of death
And you want to give me an end

You are the queen of doom
You can steal my life away
But now I have to face you 
And take your own life my queenâ¦
Itâs your time my queen of doom

Queen of doom
