I have cried for those who killed me, for their dignity
I have prayed for those who loved me but I didnât love
I have searched for my truth that no one understood
I have cried for you my love

My tears are falling down, a silver sea I see
My wounds are open again, the end will come for me
The people I did trust, raped my silver face
The love I feel inside becomes my epitaph

I have cried for all the feelings, feelings I canât feel
I have spent all my lifetime to meanings I canât find
I have searched for their truth that they canât see
I have cried for you myself
