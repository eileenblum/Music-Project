A certain end awaits for me
So Iâll obey to my dirty needs
Iâll keep your dogmas away from me
Fanatic fools open your minds
Your god was dying in emptiness
He was bored and created us
And then Iâll laughâ¦

Deep into our minds
We wonât find the truth of our lives
There is only pain inside our minds

My instincts will be satisfied
Donât be afraid to follow your mind
Iâll make love with my life
So I will laugh when I will die
And if we try to change ourselves
There will be a revolution on earth
And then weâll laughâ¦

We canât change our world 
If we canât change ourselves
We canât change our world
If we canât please ourselves

Iâll make love with my life
So I will laugh when I will die
And if we try to change ourselves
There will be a revolution on earth
And then weâll laughâ¦
