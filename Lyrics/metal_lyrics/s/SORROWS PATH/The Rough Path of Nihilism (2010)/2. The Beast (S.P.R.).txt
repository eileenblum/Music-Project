The beast is hungry for the flesh of young women
But donât be afraid to touch his face
If youâll meet him then you will love to know his tricks
Unstoppable fire and mind games

Catch the women, make them bleed
There is a mystery inside your soul
Civilize them, be their saviour
You rule and theyâll obey

Every night this dirty beast heâs rising
Looking for harmless girls
He sells dreams, a fake paradise
And they writhe in delight

Heâs not the average man, heâs a complicated nature
Admires with passion, lives in sin
Before you judge him look yourself into the mirror
Youâll find a lower kind of beast
