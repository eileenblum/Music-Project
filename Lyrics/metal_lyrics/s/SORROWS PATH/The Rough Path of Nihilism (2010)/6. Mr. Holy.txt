If you have a broken heart
If you need the true love
Believe me, thereâs a man outside
He can soothe the biggest pain
Heâs the killer of hate
A listener of your dark thoughts
He says the things you have to say
On every problem that you face

Oh, heâs so holy
A godly being
He has true feelings
Believes in good

Mr. Holy, come for me now 
Mr. Holy, make me whole again

If you feel empty and bored
If you need to change your life
Believe me, thereâs a man outside
He can make you love yourself
Heâs the bringer of the Light
A teacher of the mystics of life
He loves to make you happy again
He loves everything that is you

Mr. Holy, love me this night
Mr. Holy, bleed for my crimes!

Mr. Holy, love me this night
Mr. Holy, show me my lightâ¦

Make love to me!
