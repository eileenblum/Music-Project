Hear my moan, Iâll keep my pride
A true man dares to cry
Frightened eyes I hate your light
Alone Iâll live and die
They will try to control 
Your body and your mind
Trust your fantasy and your dreams
To gain the eternal light

Walking by myself
Donât come too close, I donât need your help
High as a mountain
Iâll be 

âThe paranoid dreamerâ
They call me for my thought
Iâm âthe paranoidâ
âcause I have a different mind

Hear my voice, Iâll hide my truth
To keep on my way
Take my hand, they have the fear
Weâll break their vile circle
They will shatter your soul
Your dignity will be lost
Trust your fantasy and your dreams
To be the first in line

Forever paranoid
Eternally
