I see myself flying through air
To dark clouds I walk but still I do not
The walls are bleeding
Iâm scared my love

The floor is crying, water goes through me
Help me my love, visions I see but still I may not
Seconds seems like days
But still I remain

And still I love 
Again the lust remains
Iâm getting closer
Infinity Iâll become

I am getting closer
Iâll dream âtill dawn I see
Iâm getting closer
To you my love

Please help me love find the place
I see the windows, the stars are mine but still they are not
All spheres are mine for you (my love)
Iâll travel to rescue

And still I walk
Still I love
For you my lust
Iâm getting closer

Iâm getting closer
I think Iâm gonna cry
I see me coming
Iâll always remain

For you my love and still youâre not
For you my love

I love myself
