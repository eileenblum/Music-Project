This is a song for those who have a fragile mind
For lovely beings who cannot face this brutal age
A hope to live, they canât find a hope to live
Theyâre lost and damned, only the stronger will survive

Empty eyes are begging for a smile
Blackened hearts, they seek another lie

This is a song for the losers of this life
For those who try to find the truth into the lie
