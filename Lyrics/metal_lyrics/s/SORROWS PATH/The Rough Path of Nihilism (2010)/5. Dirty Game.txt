There I stand, a servant of your needs
A guardian of love or am I sick
Kissing, smelling, eating a holy flesh
This boring love will die

I will obey, you made the rules, I will obey
I will obey to your love

Honey, play your dirty game, but youâll lose again
Foolish girl, play your dirty game, youâll become my slave

Your bowels I eat, lustful is my act
A guardian of love or am I sick
Fucking, smelling, drinking my loverâs flesh
An unholy love will end

Dirty game without end
Lifeâs the game, dirty game without end

Itâs love, ha, ha, ha!...
Lick my boots, you miserable worm!
