When I felt your power inside me
I sent my thought to my childhood
I took a deeper look to see
To solve the riddles of my spell

I can crown you my God, my lust is yours
I can feel your dirty magic, I love you now

When I felt the demons inside me
I tried to cast them out, but they were strong

I can crown you my God, my lust is yours
I can feel your dirty magic, I love you now
I can face peopleâs blame, I take more lust
My orgasm is unbelievable, oh my love!

The feeling must die, the lust will last

When I sacrificed dignity
I felt so sad, but (then) I laughed again
