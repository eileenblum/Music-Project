[I. LOST INNOCENCE]

Open doors for madness, itâs a true defeat
Crying steps of pain for a child who lost his dream
Homosexual fear, alternates the sex
And a crawling snake keeps the truth alive or dead
Empty walls of water, falling from the stairs
And the blasphemy, an anathema for usâ¦

[II. LOST YOUTH]

You asked me why the end is certain now
I told you lies to hide my bitter cries
You gave me smiles to soothe my heart of stone
The answer now, Iâll giveâ¦

All love is lost
All love is lost, my son 
All love is lost
All love is lost, my blood

Once upon a time, the prophecies were false
Now the end is coming closer
The dark walls are falling to devour our souls
Hear their callsâ¦

You asked me why the children lost their smile
I told you lies to steal a breath of youth
You cursed my soul to rot in misery
The answer now, I have to giveâ¦

All love is lost
All love is lost, my son
All love is lost
All love is lost, poor boy
