Her beauty withers, lost in a morbid cell
No one cares if she lives or dies
Locked in this room, sheâs gone and lost for years
Poor parents, they donât know about her fate
She had dreams, theyâve trampled over them
Now sheâs still, please cry and feel her pain

She danced upon her grave, a veil her only friend
Woman youâve broken my heart again

Some hard drugs make her senses numb
But the pain is deep, nothing can stop it
Money talks, destroys another person
Her evil pimp devouring her soul
She had dreams, theyâve trampled over them
Now sheâs still, please cry and feel her pain

How I want to kiss your hand
To kiss your feet, to be your servant
How I wish to see your eyes shine again

Weâre all to blame, sheâs nothing but our child
We close our eyes and laugh at her dry face
She had dreams, weâve trampled over them
Now sheâs still, please cry and feel her pain
