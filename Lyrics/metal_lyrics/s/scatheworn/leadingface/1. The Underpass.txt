Such a dying, loss of pulse
I endure in the state of rest
Slowed down my vital functions
My brain defects
I wonder what it seeks on the other edge
Another life immaterial
Another fall sinking into silence

Experiment begins
Need a glare

Evaporated one by one
My fucking senses leave me alone
Fight against fright
Devote myself to the gloom

[Bridge]
Leading my breath to the echo
Fading in where there's no recall

[Chorus]
Captured by this light across the eternal
I feel myself go away
Where I don't wait for anyone

It is too late ! (Already been so late)
'Doesnât matter ! (Nothing matters anymore)

(Do I turn into a madman ?) Faint skylines now I see
Frothy whispers drawl to my ears
(A second self in this emptiness) Believer into ethereal winds
All my life I entreated

Dear world without perishable peel
Bright fluidity forming my will
Created as I desire it to shape
Decoded, my soul absorbs this escape

Suddenly, my realm's eroding
Vanishing around me
Won't return over there !
Enslaved to the reality !
Petrified, I yell out
So it won't ever wake me (up)
Aroused to their real life
Ignorance of others with no fight

Numb limbs, darkened sight
The beats reveal the path
Fading out but never disappearing

Your glare cannot blind me
The herd has a new entity
Isnât a dream affecting your acts ?
As real as you are ?

[Altered Bridge]
Leading my breath to the chaos
Fading in where thereâs no recall

[Altered Chorus]
Banished by this light across the ephemeral
I feel myself back from afar
Where I'm not expected by anyone
