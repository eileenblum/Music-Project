Here you are, tied on the ground
Don't beg me I'm not the one I've known
I want the key you surely own
So tell me right now, what taste is that sound ?

Too much time roaming to lose the meaning
Of too many things like the word "wondering"
Need the scent of what's called "understanding"

A worm lost in a shell full of shrieking shades
Groaning inside my head for so many decades

Too much time roaming to lose the trail
Where the path of fate lead me to unveil

The worm lost in a shell full of empty faces
Was myself just born out of the place
That I try to erase

Everything is collapsing
Drained in a bottomless depth
No more hope emerging from here
Powerless, I lose stability
My benchmarks are bend out of shape
An inadequate reality
Confusion and disorder
Detachment of a senseless life
Gravity loss, random sensations
Time warp in every directions
I'm where the earth and sky divide
The earth and sky collide

My hate squeezes your sigh
Iâll carve you my reflection
Youâll be my creation and belong to me
I like your bitter life
Rose of my pride
I bring you revival
Struggle doesnât help you so stop squealing now

-Dead, you're so better -I live through you
-Dead, I love you now -And I used to scorn you
-Dead, are you afraid ? -Don't you realize you're mine ?
-Death is on my side --Shorten our nightmare

Thanks to you I'll never be the same
Sealing the doors of the past
To restore a breathless world
Preceding...

Creation of (the) universe
