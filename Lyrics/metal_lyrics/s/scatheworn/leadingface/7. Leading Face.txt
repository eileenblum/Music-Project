Obsession, frustration is all that I became
But hey ! Iâm not the one to blame
You teach conventions of your mind
So blind, you jail my soul behind
Such enslaving compromises youâre not even aware
And you ! Sucker ! Act as if you care

What ? You want me to drop out ?
And eat the lies you sprout ?!
Those craps push my head to blow up
So please.. shut the fuck up !

I learned your rules of hypocrite
And turned twisted trying to quit
Corruption, compassion for all your false fake face
Just shows how devils find solace

[Bridge]
Manipulate, you rob my fate
Traitor of old mate
Bring down my will, Iâm desecrate

[Chorus]
Friendly advice
Don't trust the wise
Fiendish backstab
Wonât let you grab
Your little dream
Will never gleam

Now I know whatâs the use of your mask
You cover your face hiding your task
Dominate by any means and feel
Like a king over the lives you steal
Ironic, to do so cause youâre nothing
Pathetic, your eyes are so betraying
Eliminate your stupid plays I read
Through you who lost to that worldâs greed

Iâll teach conventions of my scars
My eyes will cut like scimitars

[Altered Bridge]
Manipulate, take back my fate
Bring down your will, it makes you hate
My smile and laugh cause you donât know
How my anger will make you bow
The flaws Iâll use to take control
Under my cowl will make you howl

So, what do you think about reality ?
A world decimated by violence, injustice and immorality
Flouted by destiny, you waste away in this society in decline
You, the witness of my story, cross the line !
FOLLOW ME !

What ? Youâre yelling a time out ?!
You fear to be burnout ?!
Youâre shit without blood in your veins
My pride reigns by your pains
