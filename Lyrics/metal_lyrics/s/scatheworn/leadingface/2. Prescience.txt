Struck down from inside
Nailed to the ground
Drowned by my senses
Discharging in my mind

I behold in a trice
Near future instants
Fragments of life, brief, uncertain
Can the hazard be planned ?

[Chorus]
And whatâs the matter ?
Itâs what the use of this ?
If I canât grab anything
I bear and forbear
Attracted by that machinery
I hear echoes of its wheels

Yet, another episode already lived
Canât find when, itâs ceaseless and
What if they all came from me ?
My whole life is duped
Friends, foes, family
Worldâs faces revealed by my creativity
That loop turns back again
And again

Prescience are you illusion ?
Will you steal my own reason ?
Feeling of choice and directing destiny
My life flashes as though time didnât rule anymore

More and more concrete foresights
However still meaningless
Open the eyes ! We are all hollow pawns !
Freewill is deceit ! Weâre foredoomed !
Relentless reality
What are we supposed to do ?
So what am I supposed to do now ?

[Altered Chorus]
Hereâs whatâs the matter !
Iâve got no use for this
Since I canât grab anything
I bear and forbear
Trapped in that machinery
I suffer echoes of its wheels

Whatever the paths I'll take will be
Only one really exists
The one that will choose me
