Abyssal screams
Infernal whirl in tow of tunes
With savagery, the weird music increase
Streaming out in my motionless skull
Maleficience of an unspeakable nature
Progressive roar transfixing silence
Atmosphere already breathed

It's where you land with nowhere to end
Confronted with what you've often portended
Too late ! There's no use to make amends

Should I regret the one I've become ?
I've run off my old image through reflections
Becoming specter of my fallen hopes
Frightful disillusion
'Don't understand why
Dreams, visions, nagging me on and on
Then my instinct led it to me
I must face my fate

It's where you land with nowhere to end
Confronted with what you've often portended
Too late ! There's no use to make amends

Leader to the absolute, I've always searched
Inexhaustible voice from my head
Destruction's to all our destination
It's what grows us apart, so

It's time !
To hear my call !
Summon the one from the void
The dead end you're stuck in
Is the point of no return
Recognize the one you've always hidden

[Chorus]
Wandering in this chasm
Laments surrounding me
Am I doomed to ache ?
TURN TO HATE !!!

I am not of this world

Canât stay here reactionless
Canât let them thatâs too much scorn
They wonât go further

Don't stop my ascent !

God ! I still don't wanna waste my time
So, what's the sentence ?
The damage is done and I'm so proud
Helpless dummies crossed my balance
Accepting my old fiends
Hope's specter will make you transcend
The wasteland that your collective -
Mind have made so defective

It's where you land with nowhere to end
Confronted with what you've often portended
Too late ! There's no use to make amends

It's time !
To hear my fucking call !
Summon the one from the void
The dead end you're stuck in
Is the point of no return
Recognize the one you've always hidden
