You've heard it all before
"This time won't be the same. You can trust me."
But you know my fucking game
Say what I have to, to get what I need
Now the evil delivered, swings back at me

Weak attempts at change carry me backward
Too little too late, now live with the hurt
For everything I have an excuse
"But some things are not long hidden: the sun the moon the truth"

Now I live with the hurt
Live with the hurt
This is what I deserve

Break me down, the only way I'll learn
The guilt is overwhelming
Take me out, the pain of me returns
My sins fucking destroy me

I am forced to face the fire I create
And watch as it annihilates everything
Hold me back while I watch it burn
The price I pay, the suffering returns

Now the hands of fate are here to collect
Nothing here is safe until I reflect
I run from myself, no end in sight
Numb on the inside from living a lie

Now I watch as it burns
Watch as it burns
This is what I deserve

Break me down, the only way I'll learn
The guilt is overwhelming
Take me out, the pain of me returns
My sins fucking destroy me

You can shelter yourself from the sun
And you can hide from the moon
But there is nothing you can do
When the truth strikes it's light on you

Now I must live with the hurt
Now I must live with the hurt
The pain of me returns
The pain of me returns
The pain of me returns
Now I must live with the hurt
