I know the things I've done, and most I'm proud but some I'm not
And it's those that speak the loudest, that replay and keep me up

Broken and alone to face this on my own

And if I can't learn from what I've done, the pain I've felt has been for nothing. All for nothing
And if I can't forgive myself for the pain I've caused it will always haunt me. Oh I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry

I don't want a second chance. I just want to understand
What led me down this path and how I can lead myself back

I'll face this on my own

And if I can't learn from what I've done, the pain I've felt has been for nothing. All for nothing
And if I can't forgive myself for the pain I've caused it will always haunt me. Oh I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry

And if I can't learn from what I've done, the pain I've felt has been for nothing. All for nothing
And if I can't forgive myself for the pain I've caused it will always haunt me

I'm so sorry
