I pass the time with tediousness watching my life pass hour by hour
These destructive patterns of life set my mind spiraling downward
Will I allow what is expected of me to dull the sharp edge of my life?
Or will I take into my hands the use of my time?

This is not what was meant for me
A weak existence of shallow priority
This is not what was meant for me
So I quiet my mind to hear the inner authority

No more resistance
Destroy the dominant power of fear
Control my existence
When I'm listening the answers are clear

I am what I seek
I now understand
So from here on out
I will not seek what I am

I will not seek what I am
