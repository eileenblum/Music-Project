I didn't ask for any of this but that doesn't mean
That the sins of my father and what he passed down do not belong to me
A foundation of shit upon which we salute, blinded by greed
But the higher it builds, worse gets the view. Have we learned nothing? Nothing at all

Can not the prisoner dream to one day be free?
Can not the child plagued with disease hope to end their suffering?
Can not the mother who buries her son wish to see him again?

It echoed in me when you said
"There is no point, this is the world we live in."
