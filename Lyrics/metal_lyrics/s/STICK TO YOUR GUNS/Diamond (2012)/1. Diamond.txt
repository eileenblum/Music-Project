I know that what's in front of me is a reflection of what is inside of me
I see that I need to be myselfÂ becauseÂ it's so lonely in the eyes of someone else
I feel
Oh I feel
Ya I feel and I always will
I starve toÂ leaveÂ fee from fear
To free myself, before I disappear
I am forever more than justÂ surviving
This is my life and this life is my diamond
My time,
Your time,
Our time is running out
