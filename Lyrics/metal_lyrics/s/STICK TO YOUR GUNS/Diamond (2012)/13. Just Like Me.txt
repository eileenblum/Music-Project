[Bonus Track]Bottled up, broken down day after endless day
Falsified for the chance just to stay alive
They look to words just for love and protection but
We just throw them away

Tell me, with everything you see
Am I wrong?
Tell me, with everything you see
Am I wrong?

Misunderstood, just like me
Forever's coming, this is agony
How can we call ourselves humane with a straight face
While we just throw them away?

Tell me, with everything you see
Am I wrong?
Tell me, with everything you see
Am I wrong?

Misunderstood, just like me
Misunderstood, just like me

Tell me, with everything you see
Am I wrong?
Tell me, with everything you see
Am I wrong?
Tell me, with everything you see
Am I wrong?
Tell me, with everything you see
Am I wrong?
