What do I have to do to get through to you? 
I've sat and waited patiently, 
And its so plain to see 
That you no longer have any faith in me. 
So what happens when we're all gone 
And you have no one left to put the blame on? 
NOT AGAIN! NOT TODAY! FROM UNTIL THE END WE DO THINGS OUR WAY! 
NOT AGAIN! NOT TODAY! FROM HERE UNTIL THE END WE DO THINGS OUR WAY! 
We've been underestimated, 
Left to fix the mess you created, 
And its taken it's toll. 
You put us down just to build you up, 
Now you're falling apart and looking to us, 
This game is getting old. We are the truth, 
We are the youth, this time you lose 
Because we make the rules. 
WE MAKE THE RULES! 
I'm not sure how much more I can take 
And I'm not sure how much longer 
I can fake that this makes sense to me. 
You make it look so easy, 
But I can promise you 
That WE'VE GOT MORE HEART THAN YOU. 
If you would just give us a chance to prove 
WHAT WE CAN DO! 
We'll blow them away with the impact we'll make. 
We'll blow them away with the impact we'll make. 
WE'LL BLOW THEM AWAY WITH THE IMPACT WE'LL MAKE! 
WE'LL BLOW THEM AWAY with the impact!
