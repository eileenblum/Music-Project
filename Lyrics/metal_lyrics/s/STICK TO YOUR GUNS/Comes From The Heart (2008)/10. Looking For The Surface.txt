YOU'RE DROWNING!
You're drowning, you can't seem to catch your breath.
YOU'RE SEARCHING!
You're searching, looking for the surface.
YOU'RE FIGHTING!
You're fighting, looking for a purpose.
In one fell swoop it could all be gone.
What's the point to even carry on?
You're better than this. 
The furthest thing from worthless.
No regrets. no second guess.
Day by day keep fighting a little more.
You're so much stronger than you give yourself credit for.
I'm always here when you need my help, 
But in the end you must rely on yourself.
YOU'RE DROWNING!
You're drowning, you can't seem to catch your breath.
YOU'RE SEARCHING!
Keep searching, looking for the surface.
NO REGRETS, NO SECOND GUESS!
