I'm broken, from every word we left unspoken.
Lost focus, Left to feel hopeless.
One life, (ONE LIFE!) One time,
(ONE TIME!) Let's make things right.
Let's make things right!
Enough's enough.
Why have we given up?
Lost Track of everything we love.
Looks Like the joke's on us,
this is all That we know and we've worked way to hard just to let this go.
You were the one who taught me that giving up was never an option.
I'll be there when you cash your
Sins in and all your opinions have fallen.
Enough's enough. Why have we given up?
Lost track of everything we love.
Looks like the joke's on us,
this is all that we know and we've worked way to hard just to let this go.
Enough's enough I refuse to give this up, lose track of everything I love.
Looks like the joke's on us,
this is all that we know and we've worked way to hard just to let this go.
Looks like the joke's on us and now it's up to us to pick this up.
