I've tried for so long to put this into words. 
To capture the worth of ideas that are worth being heard. 
We've worked way to hard and worked for way to long 
Just to be bound, gagged and thrown to the waiting dogs.

But hey, what do we know anyway? 

So we'll keep to ourselves. 
We've got nothing to say we're just here to entertain.
So now we'll listen when you say 
Just shut up and behave!
Ten dollars at the door, 
Just leave it here with everything you stand for. 
We're not paying you to hear you talk, 
We don't care about your thoughts. 

Stay calm, stay cool, 
Just pull this through. 
It's what they expect of you.

I'm about to lose control, 
Lose control, and who is held responsible? 
I want to know.
I'm about to lose control.

So we'll keep to ourselves. 
We've got nothing to say we're just here to entertain.
So now we'll listen when you say 
Just shut up and behave!
Ten dollars at the door, 
Just leave it here with everything you stand for. 
We're not paying you to hear you talk, 
We don't care about your thoughts.

Do what you're gunna do, 
And say what you're gunna say but in the end, 
We're here to stay.
