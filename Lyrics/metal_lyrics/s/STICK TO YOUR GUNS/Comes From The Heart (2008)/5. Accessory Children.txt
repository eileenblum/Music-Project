So saddening, all their minds know is pain. 
Such apathy, we've thrown their suffering away. 
Diminishing, their world falls apart right before their eyes. 
Such cruelty, we sit and watch as they die from the inside. 
How could we see such human suffering and just turn the other way? 
A tragedy when a child can be thrown away as easily as an accessory. 
What about the voiceless? the choiceless? they're the unseen, 
They don't have the means. we have a responsibility. it's up to us. 
Accessory children. we have a responsibility. we have a responsibility
