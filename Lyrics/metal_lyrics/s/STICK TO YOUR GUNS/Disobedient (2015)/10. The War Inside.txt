Channel the struggle
Bind the weight to your back
And take the next step
Another level, this is more than a war
It lives in every single breath
Embrace the damage
You have to walk this path alone!
Find who you are
Destroy and rebuild
Your fight is your own!

It's what we are, it's all we give
It's all we have, we brave the wind
It's your life, it's your fight
It's the war inside!

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Whoa-ohoh-oh, it's the war inside!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Whoa-ohoh-oh the war inside!

The rage is a tool
Hammer down the hand that tries to control you
It's what you do, don't turn around
There's no going back to the old you
Use the pain!
Let it be the force that drives you
Everyday!
You have to decide
Survive the fight or defeat the war inside!

[2x]
It's what we are, it's all we give
It's all we have, we brave the wind
It's your life, it's your fight
It's the war inside!

[3x]
Find the strength, pull the pin

You can be what you want to!
No one has known what you've had to go through
Live with the pressure to be truly free
No motherfucker will ever own me!

[2x]
It's what we are, it's all we give
It's all we have, we brave the wind
It's your life, it's your fight
It's the war inside!

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Whoa-ohoh-oh it's the war inside!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Whoa-ohoh-oh the war inside!
