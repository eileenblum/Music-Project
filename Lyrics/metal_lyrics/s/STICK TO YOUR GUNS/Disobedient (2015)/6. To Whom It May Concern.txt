I've lost count, of how many times I've tried to reach you
You weren't coming
Have my messages gotten lost?
'Cause it's been twenty six years now, and still no response
Nonetheless I'll start from where I last left off
Fill you in with everything that's been going on
It's been a bit overwhelming
But I'm sure all the letters have been more than telling

(Yeah)
Yeah, you just ought to know! (you just ought to know)
I'm coming here, because I got nowhere else to go

I for one am better off without you (without you)
But there are those out there that really fuckin' need you (need you)
I've lost count, have my messages gotten lost?
(Of how many times I've tried to reach you)
'Cause it's been twenty six years now, and still no response

Yeah, you just ought to know!
I'm coming here, because I got nowhere else to go
(Oh)
Yeah, you just ought to know! (you just ought to know)
I'm coming here, because I got nowhere else to go

It starts with me [7x]
