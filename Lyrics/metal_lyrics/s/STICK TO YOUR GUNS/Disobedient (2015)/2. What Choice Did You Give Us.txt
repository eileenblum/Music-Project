What choice did you give us?
What choice did you give us?
What choice dis you give us?
What choice?

What choice did you give them?
Bound to machines
An attempt to prevent further suffering
Played by the rules
Repaid unjustly
But the truth is this:
We will not hesitate
Do not allow a peaceful rage to become hate
I promise you you'll regret the day
A stain that won't wash away

When it all falls down
While you're wondering
Where it all went
What it all meant
We'll have no words left
We may not be around
To see it fall into descent
We'll always be your enemy
So save your breath

What choice did you give us?
What choice?

If they never change, we'll never fade
We will never fade
If they refuse, we'll light the fuse
We'll light the fucking fuse

Look what we've done
We've created a fate
That we will never outrun
Time to change the path
Or be forced to forever live
With what can never be undone

When it all falls down
While you're wondering
Where it all went
What it all meant
We'll have no words left
We may not be around
To see it fall into descent
We'll always be your enemy
So save your breath

What choice did you give us?
What choice did you give us?
What choice did you give us?
What choice?

We will not hesitate
I promise you you'll regret the day
A stain that won't wash away
