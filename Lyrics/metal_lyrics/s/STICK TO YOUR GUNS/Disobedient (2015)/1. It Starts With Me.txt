Take a step back! How can this be?
So much begging and pleadin' with no one listenin'
Take a breath now and think of what this really means!
This is my understandin'!
That the life I lead does not belong to me!

It starts with me (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
It starts with me (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
It starts with me (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
It starts with me (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

In a world where doing what's right
Has been pushed from the light
And forced underground
Into back alleys, and places abandoned
What choice do we have?
Tell me! What choice do we have?
What choice do I have?!
What choice do I have?!
But to force my own hand!

Each human being, it doesn't matter whether he's a Politician, or a business man or a...
Just an ordinary person like me, in the street
We should all be, as a human being to realize the enormous
Suffering, misery, confusion there is in the world
And it's our responsibility to change all that
