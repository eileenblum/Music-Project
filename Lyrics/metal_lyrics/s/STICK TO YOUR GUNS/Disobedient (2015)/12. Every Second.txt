It's no matter what you hear[?]
Foes are rocking over there
Fought away the dribbleness
Believe it![?]

[Chorus: x2]
Shut your trap! (Every day!)
Pursuing! (Every day!)
Every second! (Every day!)
From now to eternity[?]

Break your leg and dim my eyes
Or you've felt you'll be okay
Opened by unopen hearts
Educate

[Chorus x2]

The question we must guess
Will shoot again and again
It's the way I wanna change
The struggle through this pain
I was born a god, I was born a mess
Smashed the suffering anyway that I can!
I believe we can change
I believe we can change
I believe we can change
Anything, anything!
