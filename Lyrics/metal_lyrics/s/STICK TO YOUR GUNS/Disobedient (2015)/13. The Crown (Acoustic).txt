Don't get me wrong,
I'm grateful for the good intentions you hold me on,
Still there's a feeling like all the things we left undone,
Became the things I'm running from ooh,
Don't get me wrong,

We can't escape the voices in our heads that break us down,
But heavy lies the crown (don't forget about me),
Maybe you need some time to walk it off and let it bleed,
Just don't forget about me (don't forget about me),
Whoa heavy lies the crown, whoa heavy lies the crown,

You need to know,
That I don't hold a thing against you that much is true,
You did what you could,
Sometimes we get the best of ourselves,
Break it down so we can rebuild,
We can rebuild,

We can't escape the voices in our heads that break us down,
But heavy lies the crown (don't forget about me),
Maybe you need some time to walk it off and let it bleed,
Just don't forget about me (don't forget about me),

I understand the feeling of thinking you failed me,
I understand the blaming and the pain that it brings,
The pain that it brings, the pain that it brings,
Just let it go, the pain that it brings,
Through the grit and the pain that it brings,

We can't escape the voices in our heads that break us down,
But heavy lies the crown (don't forget about me),
Maybe you need some time to walk it off and let it bleed,
Just don't forget about me (don't forget about me),
Whoa heavy lies the crown, whoa heavy lies the crown.
