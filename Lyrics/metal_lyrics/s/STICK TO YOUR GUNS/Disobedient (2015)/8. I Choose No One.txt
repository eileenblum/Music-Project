[feat. Scott Vogel of Terror]Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you
Enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do
What to think, and what to feel?!
Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men
Machine men with machine minds and machine hearts
You are not machines, you are men
You have the love of humanity in your hearts
You don't hate, only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural

I see the way you all suffer the same
Try to tell me there's no other way
I hate how you shove this in my face
Day after day after fucking day
Fuck the way you try to turn my world
Black and white
I won't let you bleed the color from my life

I choose nothing
I choose no one
I'd rather lose than ever be like you!
There's always a way
Nothing, no one
I refuse to hold your smoking gun
I'd rather lose than ever be like you
There's always a way, always a way, always a way!

I don't live my life by your made-up rules
I can't identify with your twisted views
No one dictates my life for me
Don't even try!
You will never understand me
Don't waste your time
(Waste your time!)

I choose nothing
I choose no one
I'd rather lose than ever be like you!
There's always a way
Nothing, no one
I refuse to hold your smoking gun
I'd rather lose than ever be like you
There's always a way, always a way, always a way!

I'd rather fuckin' lose than ever be like you
I will never be like you
I will never be like you
I will never be like you
The choice is yours, but you choose to fit
Never give up, give in, not gonna quit
The choice is yours, but you choose to fit
Head strong, heart pure, resistance
