Picture this.
You're just a kid.
They never noticed you because no one ever did.
You don't know why but you don't mind.
Your life already gives you a hard time.
They saw you, your whole life, less like an underdog more like garbage.
Do they know what it's life, to spent every single day with a back like a target?
A back like a target!

Trust me I know when you look at me you see nobody at all. Woooaaah!
For the first time I can say that I'm proud to be nobody at all. Woooaaah!
We'll never be.
We'll never see.
Never believe the fucking lies they tell themselves.

Don't tell me who to be.
I put my faith in those who are just like me.
We have no face.
We have no name.
And we never needed any of you anyway.
Any of you anyway!

Trust me I know when you look at me you see nobody at all. Woooaaah!
For the first time I can say that I'm proud to be nobody at all. Woooaaah!

Proud to be nobody! We never needed any of you anyway.
Proud to be nobody! We never needed any of you anyway.
Any of you anyway!

Trust me I know when you look at me you see nobody at all. Woooaaah!
For the first time I can say that I'm proud to be nobody at all. Woooaaah!
We'll never be.
We'll never see.
Never believe the fucking lies they tell themselves.
