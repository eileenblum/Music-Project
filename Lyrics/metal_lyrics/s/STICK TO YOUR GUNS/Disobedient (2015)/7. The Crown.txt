Don't get me wrong
I'm grateful for the good intentions
You hung me on
Still there's a feeling like all the things we left undone
Became the things I'm running from

We can't escape the voices in our heads that break us down
But heavy lies the crown
(And don't forget about me)
Maybe you need some time to walk it off and let it bleed
Just don't forget about me
(Don't forget about me)

Heavy lies the crown
Heavy lies the crown

You need to know
That I don't hold a thing against you
That much is true
You did what you could
Sometimes we get the best of ourselves
Break it down so we can rebuild
We can rebuild

We can't escape the voices in our heads that break us down
But heavy lies the crown
(And don't forget about me)
Maybe you need some time to walk it off and let it bleed
Just don't forget about me

I understand the feeling of thinking you failed me
I understand the blaming and the pain that it brings
Just let it go
The pain that it brings

We can't escape the voices in our heads that break us done
Heavy lies the crown
(don't forget about me)
Maybe you need some time to walk it off and let it bleed
Just don't forget about me
(Just don't forget about me)

Just let it go
The regret and the pain that it brings

Heavy lies the crown
Heavy lies the crown
