[feat. Toby Morse of H2O]Revolutionary mental attitude!

Fuck the message, fuck its good intentions
A new attitude for a new generation
You can't fight back if you won't stand up
Being positive is no longer enough

I take a stand to do what I can
And if I can't, I find out how I can
Control the feeling, organize, make a plan.
Can't do it all, but look into the soul
And realize the role

Realize the role!

The words alone won't last
Fuck the message!
