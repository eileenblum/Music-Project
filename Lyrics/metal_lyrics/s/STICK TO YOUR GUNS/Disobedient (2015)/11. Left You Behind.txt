There's a story of a young man
who was taken from his home.
He missed his sister become a women
and his father growing old.
From the distance he watched his mother,
mourn a loss, all alone.
And when he thinks about his brother,
he can't seem to find the phone.
From the window of his life, he can see his home.
As it passes by he feels a pain that no one knows.
Past every better judgement, he packs his things to run away.
Like an ocean distance is a beast that can't be tamed...
Whoa, whoa, oooh...

he left you behind!
Now the young man roams the globe
searching for the very thing he left at home.
He searched far and wide, under every stone,
the more he walked the more he was alone.
This young man is a lot like me,
except he learned from those mistakes he made.
If I don't slow down I'm afraid
I'll be trapped forever in this cage.

From the window of my life I can see home.
As it passes by I feel a pain no one knows.
Past every better judgement I pack my things to run away.
Like an ocean distance is a beast that can't be tamed...
Whoa, whoa, ooh...
I left you behind!
