[originally by Inside Out]I reach out my hand and you turn the other way
I'm only trying to extend myself to communicate
I try and I try and I try still no response from you
So now I refuse to waste my, to waste my time, to waste my fuckin time on you

I refuse to let myself down
By falsely putting judgment on you
To make myself look higher, higher
Only to be knocked down by the truth

I will never choose a different path
I will never turn away from you

Your attitude is an example of this
Which has become for me a burning fight
No to change your opinion of me
But to try to help to see what's right
What's right (what's right)

And I will never choose a different path
Yeah I will never turn away from you
I will never choose a different path
And I will never fuckin be like you

It's my burning fight, my burning fight
This is my burning fight, my burning fight
