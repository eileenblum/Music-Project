our heroes left to die. we push our young ones to the side. and hung bright minds out to dry. in the downpour, we'll drown if we dont find some truth. this is our nation without a roof. the fire of this hopelessness ignites. the fury of misfortune strikes. - supreme isolation reigns - the wolves are at the door we walk on common ground. its in our hearts to help those that have been shut out. and if just one, we are all the tired and the poor. so lift your lamp before we break down the door. - new colossus, they fall on blind eyes and your teeming shores, they multiply. naked as the birth of a new day amazing grace please show your sick and hungry a new fate. - the wolves are at the door we walk on a common ground. its in our hearts to help those that have been shut out. and if just one, we are all the tired and the poor. so lift your lamp before we break down the door. - it is the obligation of those who have everything to help those who have nothing.
