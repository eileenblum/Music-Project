When violence is the only language this world comprehends don't be surprised when it speaks in a way you can understand
Constant state of brutal aggression and total devastation
Relentless punishment warrants violent reactions
And we're all just hanging on by a thread
By a thread, by a thread

I can't believe you will not see
The ones you've grown to hate are just like you and me
You can't bury me in your disbelief

You give your fear a face
And now you call it your enemy
It's all I see
It's all I fucking see

Such narrow understanding, just use your fucking head
You can't see past yourself, you're just as good as dead
I want no part of your one sided perspective
I have no patience for your malicious intentions

I can't believe you will not see
The ones you've grown to hate are just like you and me
You can't bury me in your disbelief

You give your fear a face
And now you call it your enemy
(You give your fear a face)
War is all I fucking see
It's all I see
You can't bury me
(You give your fear a face)
In your disbelief
(And now you call it your enemy)
