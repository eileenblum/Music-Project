Push your world away. We're not the fucking same.

Your poisons. Your prisons.
You can't have us.
Your poisons. Your prisons.
You can't have us.

Deliberate rejection of your shallow satisfactions.
Polluted views rot and rust. You'll get no tolerance from us. 

Your poisons. Your prisons. No truth.
We've got no tolerance for you.

Misguided hate and depthless love with no one left to take from.
For your world of fictitious bliss, we've got no tolerance.

Your poisons. Your prisons. No truth.
We've got no tolerance for you.

Your greed. Your constant god damn needs. Fuck you.
We've got no tolerance for you.

Push your world away.

What the fuck did you expect in a world that is unjust?
You can try and try, but you can't have us.
What the fuck did you expect in a world that is unjust?
You can try and try, but you can't have us.
No, you can't have us.
