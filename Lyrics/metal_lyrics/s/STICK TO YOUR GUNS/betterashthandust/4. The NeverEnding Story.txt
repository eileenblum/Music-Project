I get it, you've got nothing left to give
The world took everything, no reason left to live
Nothing but the warmth of hate to keep you safe
Take it out on anyone who gets in your way
Your words are sharp but they dull your mind
You're feeling sorry for yourself to pass the time
The front is strong but your back is fucking weak
Grabbing at anything to stay on your feet

Mind racing
The voices saying
All of this means nothing to me
I'm tired of suffering through all of everything
Suferring of everything

When did you lose your way?
When did you give up on everything?
Remember when you used to fight for something?
Now hollow and alone with nothing

Mind racing
The voices saying
Feelings are traced
It's neverending

All of this means nothing to me
I'm tired of suffering through all of everything

When did you lose your way?
Just give a fuck about something, mother fucker
Just give a fuck about something
It's neverending
When did you lose your way?

All of this means nothing to me
I'm tired of suffering through all of everything

All of this means nothing to me
I'm tired of suffering through all of everything
Through everything
Suffering
All of this, all of this means nothing to me
