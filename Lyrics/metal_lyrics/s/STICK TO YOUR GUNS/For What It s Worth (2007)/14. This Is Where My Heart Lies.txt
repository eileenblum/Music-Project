I will stay true to this .. I wont fall .. 
This means more now than ever before .. 
Your doubt drives me and I bite my tongue .. 
You hate me and everything I am .. 
And everything I believe .. 
Say what you will cause I have learned to turn the other cheek .. 
Say what you will .. 
This is mine this is for me we will rise up together .. 
We are one we are family .. this world may bring us down .. 
But it cant tear apart this family .. 
Be strong .. keep your head up .. 
Because this struggle will only get harder to handle .. 
This is where my heart lies
