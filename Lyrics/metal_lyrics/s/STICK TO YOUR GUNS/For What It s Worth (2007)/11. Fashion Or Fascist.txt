What's with all the starring why are you so worried about 
What they're wearing,.. you care more about their hair then understanding.. 
That you are the real critic here so take a look into the mirror.. 
Don't waste your breathe give it a rest this isn't a contest you make us all second best.. 
I'm sorry I can't help but laugh you've fallen into the trap of thinking 
What we wear determines who we are you've taken this way too far.. 
When will you realize what matters is what's on the inside so you 
And I must cast aside this pointless fight to keep alive our able minds
