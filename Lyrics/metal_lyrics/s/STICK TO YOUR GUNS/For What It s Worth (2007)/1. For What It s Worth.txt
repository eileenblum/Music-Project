The best has yet to come.. 
All damage has been done 
And we have just begun to see 
What we've become.. and 
I cant help but see a need 
To turn this all around.. 
And lift ourselves up from the ground.. 
Because for what its worth 
We can not go unsound.. 
And for far to long 
We've been fighting more 
Than singing along.. 
Let a new dawn arise let open our eyes.. 
To something new a new born youth an untold truth 
There's no excuse for us use to explain out self abuse.. 
We have so much more to give.. 
We are the alternative and our voices 
Will rise in unison.. 
We have yet to begin and 
We cant let ourselves wear thin 
And for what its worth our resolve 
Will not see its end
