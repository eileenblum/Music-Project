Half truths and whole lies 
Simple words cant justify another lie 
Another dies and another mother left to cry.. 
Another night another thousand lives 
When will we realize war will be our demise 
So unfortunate we cant sacrifice our pride.. 
Now a land being filled 
With the innocent blood we spilled.. 
What is left to say 
When the martyrs are left to their graves 
No real understanding of what it is they're dying for.. 
Freedoms price seems too much to pay 
Freedom for you and for me?.. 
Freedom from this awful tyranny 
Consequently a choice has been made 
We've paid in full 
Now we must accept this rising death toll.. 
Relative truth has set a barrier down.. 
It seems that our hate is our only common ground.. 
With words we make sound 
But no real progress made in this escapade.. 
Cultures set worlds apart, 
This has failed from the start our lack of understanding 
And respect for those who would choose right to be left.. 
Our placement has left them faithless a faith only we could break.. 
How could we expect them to see eye to eye 
When we have them face down on their knees
