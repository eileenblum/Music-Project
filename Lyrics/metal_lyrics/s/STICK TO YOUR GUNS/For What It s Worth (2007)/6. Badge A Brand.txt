Its one thing to turn your back on everything you believe .. 
But now you've turned your back on me .. what happened to you .. 
And I may not wear my heart on my shirt on my hand as a badge as a brand .. 
But that doesn't mean this isn't sticking with me .. 
Lets take this back to the beginning .. who stood by who .. 
Who helped you up when you fell through .. 
I'm not looking for recognition I just want you to understand my position .. 
I don't agree with your decisions .. I've seen you conquer so much more .. 
But I'm still here and that wont change .. my heart remains the same .. 
Bring it back down .. you turned your back on me and everything you believe
