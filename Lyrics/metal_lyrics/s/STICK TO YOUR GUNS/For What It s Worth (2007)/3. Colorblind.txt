History repeats itself again
When will this all end
And when will we begin
I guess until you have no one left to offend
Why must we be left alone
Well never make it on our own
One mind one heart one soul to find another way for us to see eye to eye
When will understand we let ourselves down again
And the time it takes for us to hate is the time it takes for this to end
Why cant we set aside these differences placed 
In our minds why cant we close our eyes and live our lives colorblind
Look at the mess we've made
We let our selves be ruined by our hate
Its never to late to change
Look at the ruins we create
One another we underestimate
And its never to late to change
What do we need to do to live in sanctuary is this all really necessary
To discriminate based on race our steps we must retrace
And put ourselves in each others place
Our hearts have been misplaced
