This is more than a pulse beneath my wrist 
Or a beat beneath my ribs this is something 
That cant be given away
Because whats life for some is not right for some 
But either way we can overcome 
And not be killed by our own mistakes
We cant let this be our death
Because our differences will be our expenses too relieve us 
And achieve something for us to believe
We have been put up on the shelf its such a sad day 
When we need to save each other from ourselves
Rest assured that with a heart thats pure well be victorious 
And not let our hate get the best of us
