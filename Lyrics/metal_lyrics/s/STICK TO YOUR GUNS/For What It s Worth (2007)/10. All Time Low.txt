My kindness has been mistaken 
For a weakness disrespect and carelessness 
Is result of your selfishness.. 
I stood right by your side 
And gave you all my time 
And in return you took all of my pride 
So I'm here to take back what's mine.. 
And your friendship I still keep 
But honestly how far must you go to an all time low.. 
I see right through your disguise 
I see the lies you hide behind 
And this cant stop until you realize a thing 
Or two about sacrifice.. 
What's done is done and its time to move on 
So lets forgive and lets forget and put back into the past
