A white blinding light
A deafening discharge
You look up to the sky
and stare death in the eye

Oceans vaporize
All life is ending
Civilization is dying
World of man in demise

The inevitable end
The inevitable end is near
The inevitable end
The inevitable end is here

Walk into the cloud
inner organs boiling
Your skin is ripped away
stripped down to the bone

Radiation sickness
bleeding from all orifices
Plague and famine
The unborn die in the womb

Learn to love the bomb
