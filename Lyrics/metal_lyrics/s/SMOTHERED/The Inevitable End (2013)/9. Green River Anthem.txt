They were all whores
They deserved to die
Nobody would ever miss them
They deserved to die for their sins
The gleaming river
Chaos take its course
Lovely voices screaming
Choke all the whores

It was so nice
how their necks fit my grip
Dark glooming eyes
Death won't come quick

Father told me everything would be fine
eat his bread and drink his wine
confess my sins to father and spirit
Make me new, make me whole

So we chant this sorrowful lament
So we sing this Green River Anthem

I am a soldier of faith
sent to this earth to rid the streets of sin

Told them to watch their feet when they shut the door
Tonight the river will eat another whore
