I have to quench my thirst, my thirst for blood
I have to see the streets littered with corpses
I have to do this, this is my call
No one can stop me, so help me God

Who will die when there's
No one left to kill

I have become a god, the Alpha and Omega
The beginning and the end
But now the fun is over and I'm hunted like a beast
What should I do? What have I done?
Was this really so wrong?

Bits of flesh and blood, skull and brains
Litter the sidewalk
The ultimate salvation, a gunshot to the head

For years of incurable madness
The voices in my head kept me sane
They recited sweet songs and poems
of blood, murder and rape

Extinguish the soul and desecrate the body
Empty the clip while masturbating wildly
It's so much fun when you're on the run
It's human nature
