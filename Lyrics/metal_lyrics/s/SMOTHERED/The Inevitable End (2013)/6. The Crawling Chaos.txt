Superior form of life
an ancient horrible god
black of skin, dark as night
hoofed feet, possessing all sight
Physical form horrid yet beautiful
lidless, eyeless, seeing all as his prize

Crawling, reaching, claiming, devouring
Bending the minds of the sheep to his will
Setting fire to worlds

The crawling chaos commands me

Watching the void with perpetual jealousy
he seeks to end the slumber of the sleeping one
to kill a god one must be a god
the cosmic repercussion is apocalyptic nightmare

Feeding on the biological sludge
leaving the fertile planet sterile
his reach goes farther and he ascends

The crawling chaos commands me
