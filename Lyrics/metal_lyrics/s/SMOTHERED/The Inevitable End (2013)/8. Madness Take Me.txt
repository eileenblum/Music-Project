One night I woke up from my nightmare
and felt a new found power in my soul
I must explore this twisted foresight
I will harness this power to control

I fall, I crawl
The taste in my mouth is foul
I shout, I howl
corpse exhumed for the pleasure of my soul

In then tomb I found my love
I gave her all for god above
In the womb I dream of her soft touch
this undead queen feeding my nightmares

Limbless, cannot move for my mind is broken
Faithless, cannot feel for my heart is crushed

Cannot explain this sensation
so right yet wrong
I must find ways of expression
all the longing for salvation

Decomposing flesh triggers my senses
I long for the cold embrace
No one must know of my new found love
I will take this secret to the grave

Limbless, cannot move for my mind is broken
Faithless, cannot feel for my heart is crushed
Senseless, cannot taste or smell my surroundings
Madness, take me to hell

One night I woke from my nightmare
Heavy restraints keep my sickness in control
I have been chained to the wall for my own safety
I pray to lord of heaven for my soul

I beg, I cry
I try to run away in my mind
I fight, I hide
Forever destined to suffer my affliction

Madness take me
