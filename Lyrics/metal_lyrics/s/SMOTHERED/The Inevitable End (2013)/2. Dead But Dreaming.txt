It sleeps, submerged in the drowned city
It dreams, calling those who would be worthy
The madness takes control
the call consumes your soul
Nightmares haunt your
sleepless nights

Suicide grips the weak
Feeble minds lost into chaos
Those who resist the call shall
wither and die

Sleep no more 'o ancient one
crush the world beneath your feet
