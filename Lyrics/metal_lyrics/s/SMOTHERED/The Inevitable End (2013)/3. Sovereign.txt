Crimson rain on a warm sunny day
A thick red mist engulfs the evening sky

Mass suicide to honor the awakening
Ritualistic sacrifice
Death with a great reward

Blood has been spilled this night
to re-open the dark void
and release the raw essence of chaos and corruption

Striking fear into the false gods
Casting his shadow on the face of the Earth
Setting flame to unbelievers
Devouring the spirit of the would-be saviour

We are legion
I am Sovereign

Orphaned children reek with disease
they watch the horizon and pray for release

As the sun sets in the blackened west
light exhales its final breath

Confidence born from ignorance
I am the vanguard of your destruction
I am many, we are Legion. I am Sovereign
