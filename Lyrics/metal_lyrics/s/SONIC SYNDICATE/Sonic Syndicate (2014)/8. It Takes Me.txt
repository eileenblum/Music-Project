Devil gave a taste of fame, I drank that bottle dry
A vicious indignation cut me down in my prime
I'm dying for salvation
Bring me back to life
Walking through the underworld
Bring me back to life

Burst into flames like a vampire in the sun
Got tunnel vision like a werewolf on the hunt
Well, I'm resurrected â the undead rising up
The curse is lifted or has it just begun?

It takes me
It breaks me
I'm trying hard to make it
It's too late
It's over
Go fetch the noose, I'm ready

Trying to awake from a two-day-waste-of-time
The thing is I can't remember why I'm on the floor
Blood drunk, I gotta break but I'm already in pieces
But what doesn't kill us they say makes us stronger

t takes me
It breaks me
I'm trying hard to make it
It's too late
It's over
Go fetch the noose, I'm ready

Kill me,I don't like what I've become
Seething. There's maggots in my lungs

t takes me
It breaks me
I'm trying hard to make it
It's too late
It's over
Go fetch the noose, I'm ready
