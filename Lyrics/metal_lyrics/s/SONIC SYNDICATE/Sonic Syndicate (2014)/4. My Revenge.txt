This decision will be your final breath

I tried to find a distraction to take my mind off how much I wanna find you
Reel you in with a face that you know, while I write this deception
I'd love to say it's only gonna equal that which you did to me
But the truth is my grudge has manifested
Turned into something I don't even recognize

But one thing I know is that when I find you it's gonna hurt, it's gonna hurt
But one thing I know is that when I find you it's gonna hurt, my god this will hurt

And all the people that you love are in as much trouble as you are

This is not a threat, this is not a threat
This is the one and only chance you will ever get
To make it up to me before I let it out
The demon called Revenge
My revenge

Wake up and smell the roses â they're on your grave
Use this hindsight to make peace with all the mistakes that you've made
Self-mutilation. You'd sever your arm to avoid a handshake
Well this is now, no turning 'round

I know the water that flows between our bridge is red
But this could be a cleansing or a drowning
Pretend to contemplate to feed your own denial
But make no mistake this next decision will be your final breath

This is not a threat, this is not a threat
This is the one and only chance you will ever get
To make it up to me before I let it out
The demon called Revenge
My revenge

But one thing I know is that when I find you it's gonna hurt, it's gonna hurt
But one thing I know is that when I find you it's gonna hurt, my god this will hurt

And all the people that you love are in as much trouble as you are

This is not a threat, this is not a threat
This is the one and only chance you will ever get
To make it up to me before I let it out
The demon called Revenge
My revenge
