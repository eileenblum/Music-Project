Line 'em up, the traitors that have questioned my blood
Loyalty is in my veins, it's thicker than mud
So before I pull the trigger I'm gonna give you the chance
To point your fucking finger at the ones that deserve it
I know it might have seemed like we left you for dead
Like I was never coming back but that was all in your head
See, at the time we were suffering from a knife to the back
But no handicap is gonna keep us from our family

This goes out to steadfast â the loyal
And the true Synners of the world

Finally, finally, can you see what I see?
I'm not asking for much, just believe in me
I wanted to come home but there were too many bones
That needed burying before I let you know

I'm sorry that I let the devil get in my lungs
But I would never let him hurt a hair on the ones that I love
You could argue that I left it all to the last minute
But you gotta admit, this is hell of a finish
Just when you thought that this could only get worse
Here comes the cavalry with the big guns
So any famous last words from the infamous liars?
Oh yeah, that's right, you spent it all on friendly fire

Finally, finally, can you see what I see?
I'm not asking for much, just believe in me
I wanted to come home but there were too many bones
That needed burying before I let you know

Just believe in me, in me

Finally, finally, can you see what I see?
I'm not asking for much, just believe in me
I wanted to come home but there were too many bones
That needed burying before I let you know
