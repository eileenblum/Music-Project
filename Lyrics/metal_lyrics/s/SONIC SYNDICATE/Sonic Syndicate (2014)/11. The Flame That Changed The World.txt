What happened to us?
We sure as hell haven't been ourselves
And the bitter times are coming again, I can feel it
How can my past still steal all control?
This ends today
Get a grip motherfucker
You're slipping away

Got to turn this around
Got to turn
Rewrite your self-image
Be reborn
Got to turn this around
Got to turn
Deconstruct. Rebuild. Be reborn

We'll find a way, mark my words
Light a fire that will save us all
'Cause I'm nothing without you
I'm cold and dead without you
You're the flame that changed the world
You changed the world

Know how to suffer, I learned how to die
but the thing I really fear most is running out of time
'Fore the onset of the winter, freeze the sun right out the sky
Just skeletons walking around to the deadly tune
Of an unbreakable, infallible curse

Abolition of the sins of gods
Mere mortals on their shoulders cutting holes in the earth


We'll find a way, mark my words
Light a fire that will save us all
'Cause I'm nothing without you
I'm cold and dead without you
You're the flame that changed the world
You changed the world

Abstained. Laying broken.
Incomplete until I'm with you again.

We'll find a way, mark my words
Light a fire that will save us all
'Cause I'm nothing without you
I'm cold and dead without you
You're the flame that changed the world
You changed the world
