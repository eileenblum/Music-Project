Together with desolation
To fall deep in love with a bullet
In battle with your condition
A burden so condemned you revere it

So what is wrong with ordinary?
It's all you really need
But this obsession with oblivion
Is gonna take you down with me

Halo [2x]
Just how low can you go?
The walls are caving in, and all that's left is black holes
Halo [2x]

So keep holding on to that grudge you chose
Let the chaos in and see what happens to your soul

We lock the aftermath in a cage
Just to see how much you can take
I got a few questions for god
Like:
Tell me what is life?

Awaken me [2x]
Too long I've been trapped inside these walls
A recluse from the world
Damnation since the day I was born

Halo [2x]
Just how low can you go?
The walls are caving in, and all that's left is black holes
Halo [2x]

So keep holding on to that grudge you chose
Let the chaos in and see what happens to your soul

I won't go peacefully
Hand in hand through the promised land
Just to be double-crossed
I know you think I was out to get you

Steal your power, your creation
I spit it in your face
You are my enemy
And nothing you say can change

I won't apologize for the envy
I'll never stop being all that I can be

How low can you go?

Halo [2x]
Just how low can you go?
The walls are caving in, and all that's left is black holes
Halo [2x]

So keep holding on to that grudge you chose
Let the chaos in and see what happens to your soul
