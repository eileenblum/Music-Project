I'm a stalker on the wire
A pawn to your queen
I was bred for taking fire
But you're abusing me

All tied up, contortionist effigy
Nothing more than a pill to swallow
Beautiful eyes, soul and mind but you keep them locked in a box
Six feet from where we're standing now, I fell in love for the first time
But I didn't know she was a viper, angel, betrayer, demon, whore

Viper, angel, betrayer

Your sun in my hands
Your words in my mouth

How can you be the air beneath my wings
And still be the flood that drowns my dreams
I've got to admit, I am so addicted
I would crawl through razors just in case
there was a chance to see your face
I make myself sick, I am so addicted

It's a sin to keep on digging when you have already reached the other side
This innocence, no longer an excuse that can hold the weight of your lies
Defeated. I plead the fifth for you to realize
That I'm bleeding, tortured, itching, screaming
Just show a little compassion for your crimes

Viper, angel, betrayer

How can you be the air beneath my wings
And still be the flood that drowns my dreams
I've got to admit, I am so addicted
I would crawl through razors just in case
there was a chance to see your face
I make myself sick, I am so addicted

It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough to stop the craving

Your sun in my hands
Your words in my mouth

How can you be the air beneath my wings
And still be the flood that drowns my dreams
I've got to admit, I am so addicted
I would crawl through razors just in case
there was a chance to see your face
I make myself sick, I am so addicted
