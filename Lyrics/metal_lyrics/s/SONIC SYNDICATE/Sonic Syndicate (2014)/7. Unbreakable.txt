The leader who tries to hide the fear when war is in sight
A prophet. Those angel eyes
A warrior who fights for what is rightfully ours

I don't want to die

They won't take us alive, we're fighting to survive
But we're running out of time, so wake up, show me your eyes
Break the chains that hold you, make it out alive

Never give up, never give up
Never give up, no

Monster. Throw stones at me
Deceiver. So passively you're haunting
Dig in and paralyze me
The martyr. Breathes hell in skies surrounding

They won't take us alive, we're fighting to survive
But we're running out of time, so wake up, show me your eyes
Break the chains that hold you, make it out alive

Never give up, never give up, never give up

Seeker. On the edge.
Athena. Reward us for all we've bled

They won't take us alive, we're fighting to survive
But we're running out of time, so wake up, show me your eyes
Break the chains that hold you, make it out alive

(Never give up on me, never give up on you
Unbreakable. Unchangeable.
You've gotta make it through this
Steadfast to the bone, I can't do this on my own
I'll never give up, never give up, never give up on you)
