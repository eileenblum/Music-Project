[Digipack Bonus Track]Round one, we pick you up at dawn
Put your shit in the back of the car
Get settled in, we ain't coming back
Gonna spend this whole life on the road, yeah
Imagine this, imagine this, a party every night
A different town, a different city but a thousands way to die

But surely you've got some regrets? All you've sacrificed, All you've sacrificed, how you've lived your life
Waking up without a home
No family ties

No!

After all of this time I can't believe
You don't know shit about me or a thing about what we had
After all of this pain I thought you'd learned
Something about me, something about what we shared

Round two, lose yourself, you're not bound by this mortal coil
A pinnacle of pretension, a self-righteous scapegoat for the masses
Imagine this, imagine this, different girl every night
You can't handle this, you can't handle this
So don't you even try

No!

After all of this time I can't believe
You don't know shit about me or a thing about what we had
After all of this pain I thought you'd learned
Something about me, something about what we shared

Get out, get out, because we're coming to get you
Get out, get out, while there's still some fucking time
Get out, get out, while you still can breathe
While you're still alive, while you can survive

After all of this time I can't believe
You don't know shit about me or a thing about what we had
After all of this pain I thought you'd learned
Something about me, something about what we shared

Get out, get out, because we're coming to get you
Get out, get out, while there's still some fucking time
Get out, get out, while you still can breathe
While you're still alive, while you can survive
