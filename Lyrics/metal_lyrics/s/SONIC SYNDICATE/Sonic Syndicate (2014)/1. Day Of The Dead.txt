Survival is so overrated
All you get is a pain in the neck
I think I'd rather succumb to a bite or a scratch
Lay back, let the red do the rest

Just gimme your heart and I'll trade you my soul
Just gimme those eyes and I'll show you the world

I wanna make you
I wanna make you mine
I crave you but I fucking hate you too
Day of the Dead, bang your head
You're so damn pretty I could eat your smile
I wanna break you, I wanna make you mine

Now comfortly numb I'm free
Free from you, free from this
In fact this life would be close to ecstasy
If I didn't want you inside of me

Just gimme your heart and I'll trade you my soul
Just gimme those eyes and I'll show you the world

I wanna make you
I wanna make you mine
I crave you but I fucking hate you too
Day of the Dead, bang your head
You're so damn pretty I could eat your smile
I wanna break you, I wanna make you mine

Full blown miracle
Made to feel minuscule
With this burden that we bare
Fuck it all, we don't care
