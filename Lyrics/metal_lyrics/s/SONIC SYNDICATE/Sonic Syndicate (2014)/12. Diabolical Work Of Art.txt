[Digipack Bonus Track]Throughout this industry I see a lot of cunts
Practicing hypocrisy without a thought for anything
But the game it must be played
Compromises must be made
Sacrifice integrity just to hit the magazines

Collapsing heaven with your fingertips
Summon infection with just a smile

Take off the mask, let them see your scars, you diabolical work of art
Take off your clothes, let them touch your heart, you diabolical work of art

Gotta hand it to you players, it takes a lot to sell your soul
Lie through your teeth in the dentist chair while they rip those fuckers out
But at least you've got a name, something to carve your way
But use it wisely, you've made some powerful enemies
Who cannot wait to see you fail, pick your carcass to the bone
The vultures are all diabolical, they've played the game
They want your throne, they want your throne

Take off the mask, let them see your scars, you diabolical work of art
Take off your clothes, let them touch your heart, you diabolical work of art

So is your stomach feeling fuller? Now you've stolen all the love
And tell me, are your pupils still dilated, since you stole my sun?

You help them â the demons scratching at the walls in my head
You restrain them â the angels trying to bring me back from the dead
I've had enough, I've had enough
