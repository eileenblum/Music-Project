The sins have all been released
Am I a sinner now?
I turn the light on but it's still dark
So just give me a sign to keep good in my life
I turn the light on but I can't see shit

Don't try to find me here
Just go, I crossed a fine line
No peace in the Eden fire â follow temptation
My soul caught a glimpse of what it's like to be immortal
And now I just want it back more than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

I caught fire following your footsteps
You can't save me, bury the ashes
I caught fire following your footsteps
You can't save me
You can't save me now

It's not the end of the road or the start of it all
It's just a plane on which we exist
And as we constantly fade, degraded by the machine
We gave away the soul of human-being

Don't try to find me here
Just go, I crossed a fine line
No peace in the Eden fire â follow temptation
My soul caught a glimpse of what it's like to be immortal
And now I just want it back more than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

I caught fire following your footsteps
You can't save me, bury the ashes
I caught fire following your footsteps
You can't save me
You can't save me now
