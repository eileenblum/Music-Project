[Digipack Bonus Track]Baby, it won't be long before we mend the tide
The greatest gift I ever knew was jealous of your lies
Good job I'm bulletproof
That knife in the back, do you still think you're steadfast?
Did you think I'd forget about the monastery created out of spines?
That you stole from men greater than your shame
Well, that's all on you

Another soldier down
Another body hits the ground
Call the medic! Let's patch you up get you back into battle
Do you remember what it's like to lay your life out on the line?
Well this is it! Protect the fortress, it's rightfully ours

Come back. A new plan to attack
I guarantee it's gonna be as useful as a knife at a gunfight
A torch in the daylight
Either way, accept you're going down

Expose your wounds
Exposing truth

Another soldier down
Another body hits the ground
Call the medic! Let's patch you up get you back into battle
Do you remember what it's like to lay your life out on the line?
Well this is it! Protect the fortress, it's rightfully ours

Loyalty
To us it's more than a word
Loyalty
You either got it or thrown it away
Loyalty
So don't just be another soldier down
This is a battleground

Another soldier down
Another body hits the ground
Call the medic! Let's patch you up get you back into battle
Do you remember what it's like to lay your life out on the line?
Well this is it! Protect the fortress, it's rightfully ours
