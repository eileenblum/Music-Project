There's something wrong deep in this travesty
Beneath the clouds the sphere revolves
Pierce the veil and bring me some of that clarity
Imagine my life and death in high-resolution
What done is done, there's no turning back
Regret is for the weak and wicked
And we are so much more than this

With snakes at my feet and vultures up above
When the rain comes down who gives a flying fuck
Despair is my name and I wear it like a cross
I still believe my god is lost

I know sometimes it feels like
you're never ever gonna be the same again
With shadows creeping up around you
They're creeping up on you
Keep standing tall and state your name
There is no such thing left as fate only what you create
I'm the creator

Galvanized I sever the cord that's strangling
I've been looking for a way for so long I think I've gone insane
This was not part of the mission
Not part of the plan, I read the conditions
But sometimes chaos is the only way

I know sometimes it feels like
you're never ever gonna be the same again
With shadows creeping up around you
They're creeping up on you
Keep standing tall and state your name
There is no such thing left as fate only what you create
I'm the creator

Keep grinding that axe on the stone
You'll find it, that long road home
Keep grinding that axe on the stone
You'll find it, that long road home
