[feat. BjÃ¶rn âSpeedâ Strid]So you finally let the Kraken out to take back what's yours
But it's only feeding your alienation
Better fetch your scalpel, Dexter 'cause we're changing faces now
Remember the sights
Remember the nightmares

Guess you never found your path
Guess you never found your answers
Guess you never found yourself
Stuck in the wake of a dream
Don't know how much more you can take before you finally break
Before you lose yourself in this world

I wanted to watch you crawl â crawl
I wanted to watch you fall â fall
But guess it will suffice me to see you on your knees
Dead to the light and getting darker, don't you want to follow me now?
First in the line of fire, I am
So back you lies with action, fucker
But that's alright, that's okay, they didn't believe you anyway

Guess you never found your path
Guess you never found your answers
Guess you never found yourself
Stuck in the wake of a dream
Don't know how much more you can take before you finally break
Before you lose yourself in this world

Better take a look under the lens
I see your surface blister, molecules begin to fray
This mutation was no accident
You got what you deserve, karma comes in many forms
I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't smile but I deserve to see this
I'm sorry I know I shouldn't laugh but I have waited so long for this moment

Guess you never found your path
Guess you never found your answers
Guess you never found yourself
Stuck in the wake of a dream
Don't know how much more you can take before you finally break
Before you lose yourself in this world
