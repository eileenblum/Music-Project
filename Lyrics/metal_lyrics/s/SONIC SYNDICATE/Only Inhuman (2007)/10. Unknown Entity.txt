What does it take to stand a lie?
Once lost, now be embraced
Despair - Love is for no one
Despair - Time is on my side now
And when you dream of a new light
You came across the original me
You could tell me who he really was
But now it's all lost to you NEW TIME - THE WAY YOU LIVE THE WAY YOU LEARN
NEW LIFE - THE MORE YOU SPEAK THE LESS WE BELIEVE
ONCE MORE YOU LEARNED A LESSON
YOU'RE INVOLVED IN TROUBLE AND
DRAWN BACK WHOEVER'S MISSING
INVOLVED, UNKNOWN ENTITY

Sentenced to carry the weakest
Just had them under my wings
Declare - Intercept my mind
Declare - hope won't save you now
Even if it never matter
You met the copy cat of me
Who corner the original
Now can you save me from myself?

Did we make it?
Are we there?
High and make me numb
This is not a love affair
