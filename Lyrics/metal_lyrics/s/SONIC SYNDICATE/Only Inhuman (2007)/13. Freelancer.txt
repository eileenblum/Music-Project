[Bonus track]

Here I am, licking my wounds once again
Why am I, trapped in a replay of yesterday
The imprints of you will all be burned
And I cross my heart in hope you'll never return

I love myself for hating you
And I can't remember what meant so much to me

IF YOU GAVE ME THE POWER TO TURN BACK TIME
TO SAVE MY CORRUPTED HEART
I WOULD SHAPE IT THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE
I WOULD NEVER KNOW YOU AND YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW ME

I'll forever be what I am
A freelancer, never be duped by your scam
Have fun extracting any love from my heart
And Godspeed passenger, on my train of pain which will soon depart

IF YOU GAVE ME THE POWER TO TURN BACK TIME
TO SAVE MY CORRUPTED HEART
I WOULD SHAPE IT THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE
I WOULD NEVER KNOW YOU AND YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW ME

I love myself for hating you
And I can't remember what meant so much to me

If you gave me the power to turn back time...
