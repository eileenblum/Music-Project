[Bonus track]

In my desolate dreams
I see her eyes so clear
The soul survivor of now past emotions
Will I ever find her now?
Why am I out of control?
Do I have to fall asleep to meet you again?

The last night I ever
Dreamt about you
That night the soul harvester came to me

WRAP ME UP IN THE BLACK NOISE OF THIS ROOM
TAKE ME WHERE MY SOUL SHADOW BURN IN ITS TOMB
STIR THE FEELINGS FROM THE PAST
I'LL MAKE SURE ALL HOPE WILL LAST
UNTIL MY SOUL FADES TO BLACK

Wake up in cold sweat
From the everlasting dark
The fight for my mind has begun now
Another dreamless night
Another night without you
Please come back and let me taste yesterday
