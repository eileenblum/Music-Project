They say, they don't trust
You, me, we, us
So we'll fall if we must
Cause it's you, me
And it's all about, it's all about IT'S ALL ABOUT US, ALL ABOUT US
IT'S ALL ABOUT, ALL ABOUT US
ALL ABOUT US
AND THAT'S THE THING THAT THEY CAN'T TOUCH
'CAUSE YOU KNOW (AH-AH)
IT'S ALL ABOUT US, ALL ABOUT US
IT'S ALL ABOUT, ALL ABOUT US
ALL ABOUT US
WE'LL RUN AWAY IF WE MUST
'CAUSE YOU KNOW (AH-AH)
IT'S ALL ABOUT US (IT'S ALL ABOUT US)
IT'S ALL ABOUT LOVE (IT'S ALL ABOUT US)
IN YOU I CAN TRUST
IT'S ALL ABOUT US

If they hurt you
They hurt me too
So we'll rise up
Won't stop
And it's all about, it's all about

They don't know, they can't see
Who we are, Fear is the enemy
Hold on tight, Hold on to me
'Cause tonight, it's all about us
