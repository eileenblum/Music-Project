I took the fall and on came all the changes
Work your way through the cold shell of my heart
Just to find another layer of stone waiting
I know I'm not a good man, I never was and I never will... DON'T THINK YOU'LL MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT
MY WORDS, MY WORDS
MY WORDS ARE POISON IN YOUR EARS
WHAT I SAY, WHAT I SAY
WHAT I SAY AND WHAT I DO ARE NEVER RELATED
LIKE A TUMBLEWEED I'LL FLY WITH THE WIND

I don't mean to fuck up all the things that I love,
It's just my nature. Now let's make a deal
I'll get my conscience back when you get a clue
For all your shadow needs, how dark they may be

Of course no one collected my soul
When I have been calling the wrong number
I don't want to analyze you, but I need to find flaws
So I don't need to be with you anymore
