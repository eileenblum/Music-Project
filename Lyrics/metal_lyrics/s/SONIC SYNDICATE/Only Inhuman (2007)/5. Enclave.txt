We are uninvited guests
In this melancholy world
And soon you learn
That the only thing worth to treasure,
Are the people that actually care
Then why are there still tears in your eyes? SO I'M TRYING TO TEACH YOU SOMETHING
BUT YOU TURN AWAY
SO I'M TRYING TO SHOW YOU THE PATH
BUT YOU'LL WALK ASTRAY
I WOULD CROSS THE SEVEN SEAS
JUST TO GET TO YOU
I WOULDN'T SLEEP A THOUSAND NIGHTS
TO GIVE WHAT BELONGS TO YOU

The token of all I was
I traded for my escape
To see a new horizon
And my burden finally rests now
In the depths of its water grave
But the waves of the river will always remember

Forever isn't long enough
In the company of you
My heart will always beat your name
