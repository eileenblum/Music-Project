Please kill me in my sleep so I get stuck in my dreams
I'll keep exhaling the rime of my chaotic harmony
But the wrecked parts of that ship keep floating in
So I see, this time was never made for me... Never wanted you to know what was inside of me
And all the things I ever wanted was things I had before

MAKING MY WAY TO HEAVEN THROUGH A THOUSAND MILES OF HELL
AND YOUR ABSENCE BOUGHT ME TIME TO BREAK FROM MY MIND

Every time I slept with you I made sure that
There was no ice pick hidden in the sheets of the bed
But my feelings for you are wearing out
It's a strife, still you're the sundown of my life

Everything is lost
Everything is gone
The shadows from the past
Is watching over me
Consuming me...
