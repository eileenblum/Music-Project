Sands of time stream through my fingers
Chasing lost days of a dead dream
And I don't care if we loose it all tonight Cause I'm not sure anymore if it ever happened
It feels so unreal

DON'T CLOSE YOUR EYES WHAT IF ALL DISAPPEARS
AM I BETTER OFF ALL ALONE?
THE TRUTH IS MORE THEN YOUR BRAIN CAN HANDLE
I WON'T HATE YOU ANYMORE

First time I saw my father's tears
I knew there was still hope for me
Now share your brain so I can upload some hate
If you saw me now would you pray for me?
Still I'll keep doing the same mistakes

Why does it feel like god spent more time on me?
I burned all the bridges
But the moment I met you they where all rebuilt again
