I recognized your scars, because I have them too
It cured my contamination to speak of each other's misery
Can't deny that you were a substitute of a greater loss
But after all you reminded me of... You're someone to the world
And you're the world for someone
You really think you have a future without me?
There's a place not far away
Where I want to take you
The first snowfall is always the whitest

ALONE AGAIN IN MY BROKEN DREAMS
WHAT IS LOVE IF NOT A PSYCHIC SUICIDE
ALONE AGAIN IN MY RESTLESS DREAMS
LOVE IS NOTHING BUT A PSYCHIC SUICIDE

I recall your face, because she wore it too...
Well you were nice, but I had no reason to fall in love again
So I said thank you, had enough with my own mind ghosts
But after all you reminded me of...
