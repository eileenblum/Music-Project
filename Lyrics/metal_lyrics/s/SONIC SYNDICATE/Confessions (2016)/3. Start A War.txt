A million times, I've tried to find
The string of words that can finally set us free
But they're a grenade stuck between my teeth
Pull the pin, it could be the end of me

Risk it all for just one night
To see those fists up in the sky
This city lives to fight
We're gravity defying, yeah

We're gravity defying

Oh, I know that you've been waiting
For me to start a war
And I know that you feel jaded, jaded
Because jaded is what you are

Right now you're suffocating
It's time to cut the cord
Oh, no need to be feeling jaded, jaded
We're taking back the world

Night sky
Night sky

Empires rise, leaders are born
Behind your eyes I see the perfect storm
There's prophecy, there's consequence
A little faith can make a difference

Oh, I know that you've been waiting
For me to start a war
And I know that you feel jaded, jaded
Because jaded is what you are

Right now you're suffocating
It's time to cut the cord
Oh, no need to be feeling jaded, jaded
We're taking back the world

You're on the edge of destiny
A chance to live out what you dream
It's time to get the message out
And sing it through the streets

This is not a fantasy
A chance to live out what you dream
It's time to get the message out
Everyone in every town
Sing it through the streets

Oh, I know that you've been waiting
For me to start a war
And I know that you feel jaded, jaded
Because jaded is what you are

Right now you're suffocating
It's time to cut the cord
Oh, no need to be feeling jaded, jaded
We're taking back the world

You're on the edge of destiny
A chance to live out what you dream
It's time to get the message out
Because it's time to start a war
