You think you can shield your heart from me?
The dots connected and now I see
How I regret we shared fruit from the forbidden tree
I was entertained to a degree
But now you have your hooks too deep in me
In this post love world there's only one set of rules

[Chorus:]
It's hunt or be hunted
Evacuate your mind
Roll out your barbed wire
Around your bruised heart
Even if you play the same game
Her sleight of hands is better than yours
You better save yourself
While there's something left to save

The only dream we ever shared was a nightmare
The only being you ever cared about was yourself
This war was lost before it began
I'll pull my fail-safe, launch my plan
And once the dust settles
You wish you would be...

The beholder's gaze is fixed on me
My spells got worthless and won't set me free
Beam me up God, because I can't fend off my enemy
Save me the body count from your killing spree
I doubt I was the first to see
That this vixen was manufactured in hell

The only dream we ever shared was a nightmare
The only being you ever cared about was yourself
Now let anarchy reign
This war was lost before it began
I'll pull my fail-safe, launch my plan
And once the dust settles
You wish you would be far away

Far away, so far away
You made the swing with your unstoppable force
My ultimate strength
Is not that I'm stronger than you
And I parried with my immovable object
It's that I got the agility to outlast you

[Chorus]

The only dream we ever shared was a nightmare
The only being you ever cared about was yourself
Now let anarchy reign
This war was lost before it began
I'll pull my fail-safe, launch my plan
And once the dust settles
You wish you would be far away

It's game over
When your conscience comes
It's game over
Kicking down your door
It's game over
You are forced out
It's game over
In the stabbing rain
