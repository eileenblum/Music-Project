[Part 3. Black Lotus - The Shadow Flora]

[Lyrics: Richard Sjunnesson, Music: Roger Sjunnesson]

Searching in the ruins of me, looking for answers
Even though I'm all alone like an terminal cancer
I raise my fist into the sky
And realize it was all a lie
You never told me, always lying
The truth was that you were dying...

Father is she with you?
Beware I'm coming too...

IT'S ALWAYS HARD TO LOSE SOMEONE THAT YOU LOVE
BUT IN THE END YOU WILL ALWAYS BE FREE TO MEET THE ONES ABOVE
DAMAGE IS DONE BUT NOTHING IS IN VAIN
YOU WILL WALK TOGHETER AGAIN AND FORGET THE PAIN

Soulstone splinters in my heart
Crying for redemption
My love for her is stronger
Than the world's foundation
I raise my knife into the sky
Everything is lost in a sigh
An ocean of blood, bright light
She takes my hand and helps me up...
