[Lyrics: Richard Sjunnesson, Music: Roger Sjunnesson]

Solitude brought us together, guidanced by the hand of fate
Too blind to see what this alignment would utterly create

Frantic searching for the star I couldnÂ´t find
Tainted hearts pound even harder to remind

Our heartbeats synchronized and our souls were entwined
Now our crest turns pale, by our tears so well refined
Was it jinxed from the start, Was I the scion of my kin
Did I cast shadows from my stained within...

WRAITS ARE BAYING AT MY DOOR
BUT IÂ´LL KEEP GAZING OFF THE SHORE
TRYING TO FIND A BEACON IN MY LIFE
BUT IT'S AN EVERLASTING STRIFE
I HAVE TO BLAME MYSELF
SIENCE HISTORY KEEPS REPEATING ITSELF
