[Part 2. Extinction - A Sinwar Quadrilogy]

[Lyrics: Richard Sjunnesson, Music: Roger Sjunnesson]

A forsaken threat
God failed to foresee
Crossing forbidden boundaries
They'll siege the key
Brooding in the rift
Where hellfire licks
Thirst for ancient vengeance
The end of their grievance

Marching across the purgatory fields
Wading through the river of Styx
Into the Promised Land
Brutal memories hidden by the sand
The battlefield's in God's command

A FORGOTTEN LEGION IN A LONG LOST LAND
A DREADED SECRET BURIED DEEP IN THE SAND
THIS IS THE OPENING OF PANDORA'S BOX
A STRIKE AGAINST THE TEMPLE WALL
AND NOW ZION MUST FALL...

Millenniums of bloodshed
Scourge this soil
The slopes of this mountain
In our violent coil
Red clouded skies
Pouring burning stones
The end is closing in
The world in painful moans

The end is closing in...
