[Lyrics: Richard Sjunnesson, Music: Roger Sjunnesson]

Walking the Elysian fields
From the tree the snake watches you
Can you feel your dying heart
It can no longer stand the temptation

Wipe out the flashbacks
From the depths of my caved in heart
Trample my utopia
Memories force my mind to tear apart

We both ate from the serpent's tree
I cannot blame us for burning all the bridges
Close that coffin, strike the last nail
And tell me why is my soul this frail

YOU SAID YOU'D BE FAR AWAY
BUT SO IS THE SUN AND IT STILL BURNS
YOU PROMISED TIME WOULD HEAL OUR WOUNDS
BUT THE SCARS WILL ALWAYS REMIND US

Endless struggle with my mind ghost
It haunts my every step, my every thought.
This body is nothing but a shell
Just to enhance my never-ending nightmare
