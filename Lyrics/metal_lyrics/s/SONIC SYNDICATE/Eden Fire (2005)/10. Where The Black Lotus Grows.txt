[Lyrics: Richard Sjunnesson, Music: Roger Sjunnesson]

I feel the eye staring through my restless dreams
In the end a shade of dark blue always gleams
I don't know if it's just me
But I feel you watch me every night

Black leaves with shades of blue
The flower we found long ago
At your grave it withered away
Hand in hand with my soul's decay

Why are you looking at me?
Why did you embezzle my love?
Why will the sun never set?
Why have I lost my faith...

MY MIND HAS TURNED TO THE DARKEST PLACE I'VE EVER KNOWN
IN THE RAIN I READ YOUR TOMB
MAYBE YOU KNOW WHERE THE BLACK LOTUS GROW
ARCHITECT OF MY GRIEF
NO SIGN OF SOUL RELIEF
TELL ME WHERE THE BLACK LOTUS BLOOM

I will defy the runes carved in ancient stones
Your last wish, awoke my nightmare moans
I don't know if it's just me
But I feel you watch me every night
