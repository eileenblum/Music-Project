[Lyrics: Richard Sjunnesson, Music: Roger Sjunnesson]

The artfiact within my grasp
Liberator of your mind
Left behind from the past
A relic of doom

Terror of the soul, sleeper awake
Rebreed into power, a mind crime beyond belief

Nephilims hear my cries
Return of the exiled breed, back from oblivion
They will bring

DAMNATION UPON THE WORLD WEÂ´RE LIVING IN
ANNIHILATION BENEATH THE BANNER OF HELL
INCINERATE ALL INNOCENCE
WHEN ANGELS FALL LIKE SNOWFLAKES FROM THE SKIES
WHEN ALL DEMONS SCREAM IN CHOIR
EXTINCTION

Inside Zion's walls
The heavenly Achilles' heel
Where is your maker now?
Defenseless and weak

Nephilims hear my cries
Return of the exiled breed, back from oblivion
They will rise

When all demons scream
When all demons scream in choir
When all demons scream in choir
The prelude to extinction...
