[Part 1. Helix Reign - Chronicles Of A Broken Covenant]

[Lyrics: Richard Sjunnesson, Music: Roger Sjunnesson]

You are the reason why I despise the world
But still you're the only reason why I'm still in it
Time never healed my wounds
It just made them more infected
They talk about their heartache
But I got a fucking heart-attack

I can't reach my mind
I can't reach my heart
Why can't I leave you behind
Never have a choice
Never feel rejoice
I damn my inner voice

AND WHEN TWO RIVERS RUN TOGETHER THEY CAN NEVER BE DISTINCT AGAIN
LOCKED IN A DREAM TO FILTER OUT YOUR POLLUTED STREAM
AND WHEN TWO RIVERS RUN TOGETHER THEY CAN NEVER BE DISTINCT AGAIN
LOCKED IN A DREAM TO FILTER OUT YOUR POLLUTED STREAM

Every time I talk with you, I never have a choice
Every time I try to sew my wounds, you stretch them wide open
Time never washed my brain
It just made it more infested
I will break out of this mind prison, I will break out!
