[Lyrics: Richard Sjunnesson, Music: Roger Sjunnesson]

You cut my wings and throw me out
Out to the land, my soul was harvested from

I have never done anything to you
You never made my dreams come true
But this deceit will cost you all
I have never, never believed in you...

If you are my Abel
I will be your Kain
In this lament of innocence
If you are a fire
I will be the rain
I will always be your bane

THORN IN MY MIND
THE OATH I SWORE
LEFT ME BEHIND
I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG
YOUR UNFORGIVABLE MISTREAT
WONÂ´T COME CHEAP FOR YOUR KIND

My hatred will never run dry
You'll always be the one I defy
Until the deceiver will be dethroned
And consumed in flames...
