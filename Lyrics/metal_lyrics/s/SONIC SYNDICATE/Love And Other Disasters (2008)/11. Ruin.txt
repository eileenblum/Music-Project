[Bonus track]

Walking down the self-destructive path
To extract some shards
Of inspiration, the frustration
You are only as strong as your weakest link
That concerns me
The infatuation is an affliction

Be careful with what you don't understand
My rogue attitude is not welcome here
You're the flame that burns me
So I know I'm still alive, I'm still alive

Don't know how to get you out of this one
We're falling, always falling
Deep in your heart sits the key to set me free
Come set me, set me free

They say the eyes are the windows to your soul
A revelation, the desperation
The imaginary voices in my head aren't imaginary
Look into my eyes and you'll see that something's wrong

Don't know how to get you out of this one
We're falling, always falling
Deep in your heart sits the key to set me free
Come set me, set me free

Be careful with what you don't understand
My rogue attitude is not welcome here
You're the flame that burns me
So I know I'm still alive

Don't know how to get you out of this one
Deep in your heart sits the key to set me free
set me free

No one there when I turn around
I'm falling
Come uncomplicate my life
I'm falling, I'm falling, Always falling

Don't know how to get you out of this one
We're falling, always falling
Deep in your heart sits the key to set me free
Come set me, set me free

Don't know how to get you out of this one
We're falling, always falling
Deep in your heart sits the key to set me free
Come set me, set me free

No one there when I turn around
