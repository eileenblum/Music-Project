Million years of evolution
Still not close to perfection
God how much time do you need?
Cause I'm getting impatient
Release the source
And I'll find a way to alter my DNA
I'm on to you big guy
And I'm getting impatient

My red eyed friend
Time for us to part ways
My red eyed friend
Don't forget to write me

Why can't the demon in my head just help me?
Come back and burn all these painfull feelings
As you used to do before
(As you used to do before)

You blocked everything I felt
An instrument to unplug my heart
The voice in my head
Shut down my feelings

Come shut down my feelings
Come make me empty inside
Come shut down my feelings
Come make me empty inside

Why can't the demon in my head just help me?
Come back and burn all these painfull feelings
As you used to do before
(As you used to do before)

I can't do this all alone
I'm completely incomplete
I can't struggle on alone
You made me strong when I was weak

My red eyed friend
Time for us to part ways
My red eyed friend
Don't forget to write me

Why can't the demon in my head just help me?
Come back and burn all these painfull feelings
As you used to do before
(As you used to do before)

My red eyed friend where are you now
My red eyed friend I miss you so
My red eyed friend I'll be waiting for you
Where are you now
