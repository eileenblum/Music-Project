I see the world through eyes of desperation
Never knew how long I'd fall
But I fell trough years and years of darkness
Still I cannot seem to hit the ground

I let my guard down and you caught me by surprise
Nothing is ever carved in stone

Will I spend my life wondering
What could have been?
(If I didn't throw it away)
Or will I struggle on
And find a better path for myself
(for myself)

I build my life upon decades of experience
But what I build for years took days for you to raze
In the end I learned that one single snowflake
Can set an avalanche in motion

Some questions are dangerous, the truth is not an option
This is the illusion I pulled down over your eyes
But I let my guard down and you caught me by surprise
Nothing is ever carved in stone

Will I spend my life wondering
What could have been?
(If I didn't throw it away)
Or will I struggle on
And find a better path for myself
(for myself)

I secure my every step, slowly I advance away from you
How can I forgive you when it wasn't your fault

Will I spend my life wondering
What could have been?

Will I spend my life wondering
What could have been?
(If I didn't throw it away)
Or will I struggle on
And find a better path for myself
(for myself)

Will I spend my life wondering
What could have been?
(If I didn't throw it away)
Or will I struggle on
And find a better path for myself
