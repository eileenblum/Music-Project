I used to be someone
But I grew to be something that I'm not
It feels like I'm cornered
By everything that you really want
Why are we here in this same old room

We stand here, with damaged hope
But still we carry on
We both know and always will
It cannot end like this
We still have a long way to go

It is kind of hard
To look back on all the good times
And realise nothing
Will ever be like it used to be

I wish you were someone I can only disengage
You opened a lot of doors in me but just closed a few
You're both the poison and the antidote
Is my best not good enough for you?

We stand here, with damaged hope
But still we carry on
We both know and always will
It cannot end like this
We still have a long way to go

They didn't build Rome in a day
We just need to ride out this storm
(ride out this storm)

We stand here, with damaged hope
But still we carry on
We both know and always will

We stand here, with damaged hope
But still we carry on
We both know and always will
It cannot end like this
We still have a long way to go
