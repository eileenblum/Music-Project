[Japan bonus]

You saw my eyes and I saw your smile
A deceiving kiss over the open sea
A star painted sky, a slumbering feeling
Resurrected once more

Guess another undercover job awaits me
This game I know so well
I can't sleep until I find out what could be
To put all at stake

IF NOTHING LASTS FOREVER
WILL YOU BE MY NOTHING?
I DON'T BELIVE I'll EVER
FINISH DIGGING MY OWN GRAVE

Pieces of my shredded conscience try to hinder me
But the dark heart is stronger
I'll find out where your feelings are invested
And then exploit it

And she said wish I could gather all my tears
And fucking drown you in them
Oh honey, I'm sorry you feel that way
I'll be sure to bring my scuba gear

Double agent on another mission
It's time to make things wrong
I feel my inhumanity kicking in
And I don't know for how long
