[Bonus track]

Finally we are, we are even in the betrayal department
In fact I think you win, I think you win
About time you aired out your dirty laundry
I guess the question was more powerful than the answear

Take all you want from me
Strip me to my very soul
But bare in mind that I will always keep fighting you
So I gaze towards the sky
Doubt that's where I'm going when I die
But it doesn't matter in the end
It doesn't matter

Piece by piece I start to recreate
What used to be me
A puzzle with a thousand shapes
Which don't seem to fit
Guess some parts are missing
And sides are torn
But eventually
A picture will be born

Took a look inside of you
And found a darker place than my mind
That's good to know, that's good to know
I'll risk some emotions to slip through the gatekeepers of my mind just to project a human illusion

If I can't pull myself together, I'm gonna tear myself apart
To vanquish all these demons will take time
To banish all your devils will take time
