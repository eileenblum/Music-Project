You are an inspiration to us all
Armed with your plastic sword
A narrow mind and limited brain capacity
What I don't understand is
Why you revere a guy
Who's lacking an eye and never really existed

Tell me where's the sense in this?
(Why can't you open your minds)
Tell me what's the meaning of this
(Lose lose situation)

I feel for you god of war
Your fairer expenses
Must be insane with the mount you got in your garage
Don't you get me wrong
Cause I'm still impressed
By the bastardization between a horse and a spider

Tell me where's the sense in this?
(Why can't you open your minds)
Tell me what's the meaning of this
(Lose lose situation)
Maybe you should be the one who sacrificed an eye
To gain the wisdom you so badly require

Your savage agitation won't break us, can't break us
Just sit tight and watch our power grow stronger

Tell me where's the sense in this?
(Why can't you open your minds)
Tell me what's the meaning of this
(Loose loose situation)
Maybe you should be the one who sacrificed an eye
To gain the wisdom you so badly require

Time, time to feed the wolves
And open the hellgate
Tale a bullet for your team
and smile on your way down
Like captains of war
Following our orders down to hell
With no one but ourselves on our side
