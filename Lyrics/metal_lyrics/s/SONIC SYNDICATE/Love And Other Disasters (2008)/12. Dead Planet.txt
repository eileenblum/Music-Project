[Bonus track]

A million laps around the sun
And mankind ruined it all in a matter of centuries
Good job, 1-0 to Humanity
What's up with the vanity?
What do we actually have to prove to remove our insanity?
How many miles of ice have to melt before we show some sanity?
Hear me out..

When all the wonders of the world are gone, razed and destroyed
There will be no time to ask why it all came to this
We can almost hear the glaciers
Breaking day and night
Still we don't do a damn thing and I just can't see why?

Welcome to the last days of the earth
Welcome, everything is too late now
Welcome, was it really worth it in the end?
Welcome to the end of the world

The very last tick of this planet
Still we don't realize
That all of us will pay the price
No such thing as the luxury to think twice
God may be a kid with an ant farm
And we made him shake the box
Why wasn't to save the world on top of everyone's to do list?

Welcome to the last days of the earth
Welcome, everything is too late now
Welcome, was it really worth it in the end?
Welcome to the end of the world

When the power of love
Overcomes the love of power
The world will finally come to peace

When all the wonders of the world are gone, razed and destroyed
There will be no time to ask why it all came to this
We can almost hear the glaciers
Breaking day and night
Still we don't do a damn thing and I just can't see why?

Welcome to the last days of the earth
Welcome, everything is too late now
Welcome, was it really worth it in the end?
Welcome to the end of the world

Take a breath, make it deep
It could be the last, we'll ever make
But keep in mind, keep in mind
We brought this one on ourselves
We brought this one on ourselves
