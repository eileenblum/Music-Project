An honest crescendo
Of fireworks filled your eyes rise like stars
That moment I knew that I would bind myself to you
The fallen, the demons, they can't wait to deny the truth
But they'll have to wait, have patience
'cause right now I am loving you

[Chorus:]
There is nothing that they can do.
To stop me needing and yearning you.
Even if we're a million miles apart,
We're still joined right at the heart.

Heart.

Your memory, it warms my soul.
So when I die, I won't be cold.
But here on earth, I got something to prove,
And while I'm alive I've got nothing to lose
So I take my chance and I make my move.
I fought my evils, scaled the walls
And backed the right horse, broke the rules.
I'm risking everything I've got
Just to get a shot with you.

[Chorus x2]

Heart.

I died inside when you were taken,
And then I died some more.
The daylight hurts my eyes
'Cause I'm a stranger to the sun.
Some parts of me are gone forever,
But the rest of me lives on.

[Chorus x2]

Heart, heart.
Heart, heart.
Heart, heart.
Heart, heart.
