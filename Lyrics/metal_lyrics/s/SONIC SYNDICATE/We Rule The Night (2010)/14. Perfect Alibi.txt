[Japanese bonus track]

Are you listening?
Are you really there?
I'm open to suggestions
Do you even care?
Because within I die the more and more we lie
Hope seems to grow outside our reality of life
There's a fragile part of me that needs some help to heal
Hold a candlelight for me and don't let it go out

WHISPERING THOSE WORDS YOU LIKE
WE'RE LYING HERE SIDE BY SIDE
SECRETS DON'T STAY SECRET FOR LONG
WE'LL WRITE THE PERFECT ALIBI
AND TELL THEM ALL HOW WE TRIED
BUT IN THE END THEY'LL FIND OUT ANYWAY
SO LET'S MAKE AN HONEST MISTAKE

Tell me do you ever admit to it being more than just a dream
Let's keep it a memory keep it locked behind the silver screen
I know its wrong but its all feeling kind of right
Something big is changing its in the air tonight
There's a fragile part of me that needs some help to heal
Hold a candlelight for me and don't let it go out

WHISPERING THOSE WORDS YOU LIKE
WE'RE LYING HERE SIDE BY SIDE
SECRETS DON'T STAY SECRET FOR LONG
WE'LL WRITE THE PERFECT ALIBI
AND TELL THEM ALL HOW WE TRIED
BUT IN THE END THEY'LL FIND OUT ANYWAY
SO LET'S MAKE AN HONEST MISTAKE

We've all made some honest mistakes
Even you, the road that lead me here
For you, the one who it clear
For you I've been struck down
And built back up pound by pound
For you I would if I could
But there's nothing left to do except keep...
(Secrets don't stay secret for long)

WHISPERING THOSE WORDS YOU LIKE
WE'RE LYING HERE SIDE BY SIDE
SECRETS DON'T STAY SECRET FOR LONG
WE'LL WRITE THE PERFECT ALIBI
AND TELL THEM ALL HOW WE TRIED
BUT IN THE END THEY'LL FIND OUT ANYWAY
SO LET'S MAKE AN HONEST MISTAKE

Are you listening?
Are you really there?
