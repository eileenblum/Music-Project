I'm letting go
One thing is for certain I'm treading paths I've walked before
I've reconsidered and I'm contemplating letting go
I watched resentment steal into your face like a thief (a thief)
And the more you pull the more I push you away from me
And I'm letting go
I'm trying
You're beautiful she said to me
Then why do I feel so ugly?
The freak inside (freak inside) I still believe (still believe)
It must go more than skin deep
Domination. Segregation. Infiltration.
This life is mine and I'll be dead before you take it
I try to fly but an invisible blade cuts me
I hear that sound just before I hit the ground
You're beautiful she said to me
Then why do I feel so ugly?
The freak inside (freak inside) I still believe (still believe)
It must go more than skin deep
You're beautiful she said to me
Then why do I feel so ugly?
I know it's hard I admit I'm scared
this just how it has to be (has to be)
The hurt will fade your heart remade
Eventually we'll regret these days
You're no stranger but you're strange to me (these days)
Now when loneliness won't leave you alone (these days)
You're beautiful she said to me
Then why do I feel so ugly?
You're beautiful she said to me
Then why do I feel so ugly?
The freak inside (freak inside) I still believe (still believe)
It must go more than skin deep
Skin deep
Skin deep
Skin deep
My dead sense can't tell right from wrong
That's why my words only inflicted pain on you
I've picked the lock of a door I never wanted to go through
I'm turning back
I'm letting go
