My father said to load that gun,
And keep the devil from the door,
Don't be tempted by the words he says,

I found a way to break the cycle,
Initiated something vital,
But to the ocean it was only rain.

So rain on me (rain on me)
So rain on me (rain on me)

[Chorus:]
Bombs are going off in my mind,
To ban the places I can hide,
Quicker now, I better think twice,
Start a new life.
Fate is kicking down my door,
But I don't live there anymore,
Destiny, it needs your advice.
I'm starting a new life.

What you gonna do when you've taken my breath away,
Maybe dying young isn't all it's meant to be,
Until then I could just rewind,
My life back to the beginning,
Pause, press forward, that's too easy,
Push stop the moment I can see the smoke.

Then rain on me (rain on me)
Then rain on me (rain on me)

[Chorus:]
Bombs are going off in my mind,
To ban the places I can hide,
Quicker now, I better think twice,
Start a new life.
Fate is kicking down my door,
But I don't live there anymore,
Destiny, it needs your advice.
I'm starting a new life.

My own life, it's my own life

[Altered chorus:]
Bombs are going off in my mind,
Take a deep look in my eyes,
What do you see, do I seem fine?
I'll start anew.
Fate is knocking at the door,
But I don't live there anymore.
Destiny, it needs some advice,
What shall I do?

I'm starting a new life,

[Chorus:]
Bombs are going off in my mind,
To ban the places I can hide,
Quickly now, I better think twice,
Start a new life
Fate is kicking down my door,
But I don't live there anymore.
Destiny, it took your advice.
I've started the new life.

It's my own life, it's my own life
I've started the new life
It's my own life, It's my own life
I've started the new life.
