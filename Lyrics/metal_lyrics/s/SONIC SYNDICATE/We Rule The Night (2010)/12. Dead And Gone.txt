[bonus track]

There is no shelter just the body god gave us
And all we can do is to hope that that's enough
Well I know the rules, always did, they are written indside of my eyelids
It's an imperfect world we live in, but it's the only world we have
The less we get the more we want in this throwaway society
Fading to the point of no return, we're at a crossroad
Just follow the compass of your heart
Until we all get torched
Get torched by the undying sun

[Chorus:]
When we're dead and gone when our mistakes been done
A celestial corpse will carry on
And it will illustrate how we undermined our own existence
When we're dead and gone and our mistakes been done
Let's all just face the facts
No matter how we bend or break it
We make the ultimate sacrifice

Out of all our human-crafted artifacts
The longest lasting will be our redesigned atmosphere
Now how does that make you fee that we're beyond repair?
We sealed our fate in this slow-motion suicide
The less we get the more we want
In this throwaway society
Fading to the point of no return
We're at a crossroads
Just follow the compass of your heart
Until we all get torched
Get torched by the undying sun

[Chorus:]
When we're dead and gone when our mistakes been done
A celestial corpse will carry on
And it will illustrate how we undermined our own existence
When we're dead and gone and our mistakes been done
Let's all just face the facts
No matter how we bend or break it
We make the ultimate sacrifice

What we set in motion must play itself out
So we can hand the earth over in better shape than we accepted it

[Chorus:]
When we're dead and gone when our mistakes been done
A celestial corpse will carry on
And it will illustrate how we undermined our own existence
When we're dead and gone and our mistakes been done
Let's all just face the facts
No matter how we bend or break it
We make the ultimate sacrifice

When we're dead and gone when our mistakes been done
A celestial corpse will carry on
And it will illustrate how we undermined our own existence
When we're dead and gone
