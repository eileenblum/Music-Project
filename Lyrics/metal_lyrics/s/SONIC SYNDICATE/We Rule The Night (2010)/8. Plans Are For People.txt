It's not enough to be yourself,
You have to be your best self (self)
From my point of view there is no kingdom,
There's no kingdom in the clouds, no
You keep preaching the words you receive,
Receive from the maker (what if, what if)
But what if God is not the sender
What if God is not the sender?

Don't want to wake what you put to sleep
Because it keeps this from imploding.
The same old story, same old story
(No way to find me)
Every time that you want me.

[Chorus:]
I try not to make plans,
Plans are for people
In control of their own life.
Night is good for the hunter,
Bad for the hunted.
See the world for what it is.

Every day I searched your face for clues,
Looking for a window to strike at your mind
And when your ships are down
I'll harbour the feeling
I doubt your heart is any stronger

Don't want to wake what you put to sleep
Because it keeps this from imploding.
The same old story, same old story
No way to find me
Every time that you want me.

[Chorus:]
I try not to make plans,
Plans are for people
In control of their own life.
Night is good for the hunter,
Bad for the hunted.
See the world for what it is.

As I walk the surface of the sun,
(Only thing that)
It makes me feel alive,
Alive again.

[Chorus x2:]
I try not to make plans,
Plans are for people
In control of their own life.
Night is good for the hunter,
Bad for the hunted.
See the world for what it is.
