[bonus track]

I'm sick, sick of being an extra in my own life
A king, a ruler behind an exterior faÃ§ade

For the longest time my endgame was certain and I
Thought I knew all the answers but now they are lost to me

You own all the skeleton keys to my mind
So why donât you
Let me, Let me in on some entry codes of yours
What shall I do?
Just place your trust in me

IF YOU CAN FIND IT IN YOUR HEART
LET ME BE YOUR HAVEN
YOUâRE THE REASON WHY MY WORLD KEEPS TURNING
IF YOU CAN FIND IT IN YOUR HEART
WILL YOU UNTIE MY HANDS
FEELS LIKE ALL I KNOW I'M NOW UNLEARNING

To win, win the peace you must first fight the war (fight the war)
Don't you, Dare to bracket me with the fools of yesterday

I'll be your guardian and take the flak for you
A golem of protection, your sanctuary in the storm

You own all the skeleton keys to my mind
So why donât you
Let me, Let me in on some entry codes of yours
What shall I do?
Just place your trust in me

IF YOU CAN FIND IT IN YOUR HEART
LET ME BE YOUR HAVEN
YOUâRE THE REASON WHY MY WORLD KEEPS TURNING
IF YOU CAN FIND IT IN YOUR HEART
WILL YOU UNTIE MY HANDS
FEELS LIKE ALL I KNOW I'M NOW UNLEARNING

Even if you lay next to me
We're divided by a maze
But I will find the way
And get inside your head

I'll end your suffering
I'll end your suffering

You own all the skeleton keys to my mind
So why donât you
Let me, Let me in on some entry codes of yours
So
Just place your trust in me
Just place your trust in me
Just place your trust in me
Just place your trust in me

IF YOU CAN FIND IT IN YOUR HEART
LET ME BE YOUR HAVEN
YOUâRE THE REASON WHY MY WORLD KEEPS TURNING
IF YOU CAN FIND IT IN YOUR HEART
WILL YOU UNTIE MY HANDS
FEELS LIKE ALL I KNOW I'M NOW UNLEARNING

IF YOU CAN FIND IT IN YOUR HEART
LET ME BE YOUR HAVEN
YOUâRE THE REASON WHY MY WORLD KEEPS TURNING
IF YOU CAN FIND IT IN YOUR HEART
WILL YOU UNTIE MY HANDS
FEELS LIKE ALL I KNOW I'M NOW UNLEARNING

If you can find it in your heart,
If you can find it in your heart,
You're the reason why my world keeps turning.
