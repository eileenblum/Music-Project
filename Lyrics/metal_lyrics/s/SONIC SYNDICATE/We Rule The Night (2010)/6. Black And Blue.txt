Why did you want me to be there yesterday?
You changed my destiny
Controlled by the moon.
"If I would have known, if I would have been there for you my baby, for you."
(I tried to change my mind
But you're a drug being injected into the back on my head
You are my destiny what part of that don't you understand)

[Chorus:]
Black and blue, I bled for you.
Still dare to tell me what to do.
Synthetic angel with a human heart
You dragged me down for one last time,
I'll be yours and you'll be mine.
But after sunrise I'll turn to stone.

My proposition is unconditional and it ends tonight.
Need a body to exploit.
"I try to keep my cool but your frozen skin is magnetic to me, hold on."

[Chorus]

(Our two hearts know where it's raining sulphur clouds
The gates are open wide it's too late for sacrifice
Checkmate, last call and we're going down)

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah.

And now I'm caught in a web,
Visions in my head.
Truth is calling me, I'm searching for myself.
And now I'm caught in a web,
Visions in my head.
Truth is calling me, I'm searching for myself.
Let go.

[Chorus x2]
