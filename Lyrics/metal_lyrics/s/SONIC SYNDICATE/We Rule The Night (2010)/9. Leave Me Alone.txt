My dreams are always the same.
(This movie of you)
It flickers in my brain
Over and over again.
(Now)

What is it I got
That triggers you to follow me day and night?
I can smell your scent all around.

I don't know what your demons are telling you,
But it ain't me you're looking for.

[Chorus:]
Why,
(Why!)
Why won't you leave me alone?
It drives me insane!
And why (why!)
Why won't you just let me go?
Stay out of my way.

I slept with the enemy.
They stole all that I've got.
Framed by lust as I've been out of control.

I don't know what your demons are telling you,
But it ain't me you're looking for.

[Chorus]

And I'm locked in the yesterdays
Of your cellular memories.
But I'm cutting you out of the film to the floor.
Let the light in as I walk out the door
And you're gone.

[Chorus]

Stay out of my way.
