The earth is large
Large enough that you think you can hide from anything
From fate, from God, from pain
As long as you get far enough away
So you run (run) to the edge of the earth
Where all is safe again and just for a moment
You think you managed to escape
You could never be more wrong

[Chorus:]
Sometimes when I look in the mirror
I'm not sure it's me looking back from the other side
What if the nightmares give chase?
And they track me down even after the break of day

We think we are
We are agents of our own destiny
In charge of when we rise or fall
Capable of determining our own fate
Couldn't be, no we couldn't be more wrong
Cause you don't choose your destiny
Your destiny it chooses you
You cannot escape your fate

[Chorus:]
Sometimes when I look in the mirror
I'm not sure it's me looking back from the other side
What if the nightmares give chase?
And they track me down even after the break of day

First you show me
You show me that I cannot be harmed
By any weapon or blade they try to use on me
Then you cut me
You cut me deeper than
Than any
You cut me deeper than any sword could have done

[Chorus:]
Sometimes when I look in the mirror
I'm not sure it's me looking back from the other side
What if the nightmares give chase?
And they track me down even after the break of day

I turn deep into my soul to find the strength to stand against my fears
There's nothing imprisoned in the looking glass
I learnt to understand the silver only echoes what I think into it
Don't need to wait for the break of day
