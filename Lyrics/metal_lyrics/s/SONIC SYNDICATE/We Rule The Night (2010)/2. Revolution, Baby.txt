Get the fuck up and do something
Inspire the crowd to set it off and make a difference
Lock and load
And then I'll tattoo on my skin the names and faces I have seen.
So when I die there'll be evidence left of my life.

Have you ever thought that...

Maybe there's nothing wrong with you
And it's the world that's dirty, scared and lonely
Baby! Well, I can show you what to do
You have to shock the system
Revolution!

Always count on getting nothing
When you are on your own
But when we walk these streets together
They're paved with gold
And so I take the ink again and add your legend to my list
'cause when I die I want you to be on me

With this energy take the system down

Maybe there's nothing wrong with you
And it's the world that's dirty, scared and lonely
Baby! Well, I can show you what to do
You have to shock the system
Revolution!

And it all came to life when I thought outside the lines
And it all came to life when I thought outside the lines
And it all came to life

Maybe there's nothing wrong with you
And it's the world that's dirty, scared and lonely
Maybe there's nothing wrong with you
And it's the world that's dirty, scared and lonely
Baby! Well, I can show you what to do
You have to shock the system
Revolution!

Revolution [x4] [Rich screams in background]

It's getting harder to stand and getting further to fall
But if you take my hand we can tear down the walls
It's getting harder to stand and getting further to fall
But if you take my hand we can take on the world
