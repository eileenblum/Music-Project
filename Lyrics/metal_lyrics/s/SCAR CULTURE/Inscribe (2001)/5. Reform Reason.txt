And I should never dream again...
Still I will never hide.
These crossed hearts that bear my name satisfy my
thirst for strength, and failure- sickness thats hides
the
way to bleed and leave peace behind you.

Now drown out the screams inside.
Replace them with reason.
For reason is the drug that hides and kills your drive
to
breathe, believe and reach for dreams that light the
way
to free yourself from binds of inward hate.

And I dream of hands that cover me.
Safe inside dried eyes that feel my breath surviving
wars
that you fought.
And no one could ever help you stand for your dreams.

I feel silence, stare through me with executional eyes

that relive every shortcoming of the flesh.
Stare at my life while I relive the child that brought
me
here to try my fear.

I feel silence, stare through me with executional eyes

that relive every shortcoming of the flesh.
You live for times to qualify my anger.
Dry your eyes and reach for self-absorption.
Peel myself off broken concrete,
Despise the taste of my sour blood as I roll my eyes
up to the sky.

Grieve for the ones you've lost. Grieve for the ones
you've never seen. And I grienve alone for souls
unknown
to me.

And I dream of hands that cover me.
