I failed. I tried. On my time you lied.
I freed myself, but i'm tied, i'm tied.
Inside, curl me up and throw me in the gutter.
I hide, freedom as i feel mental slaughter.
Still blind, quick to see the way i falter.
I'm tied, now to fuel the way i feel that...
I'm a god, but not a man.
Pure disgrace mirrors pure hate.
I'll break this mirror to match your face,
I'll break this mirror tempt my disgrace.
Inside, I hide, still blind, i'm tied
I'm a god, but not a man.
Pure disgrace mirrors pure hate.
I'll break this mirror to match your face,
I'll break this mirror tempt my disgrace.
Inside, I hide, still blind, i'm tied
I'm a god, but not a man.
I can see what no one can.
I'm a god, but not a man.
I'm a god, but not a man.
I'm your god of disgrace, disgraced.
I'm your god of disgrace, disgraced.
A god. A god. A god. A god.
