Worn out by pain, crumbled in shame
same blinded game, curse out your name
For every fucking lie, i've seen through blinded eyes
your god i'll still deny, afraid he'll stunt my high.
and every fucking time i wake with bloodshot eyes,
phased through all sense of right, i'll still be
searching
deeper, farther, slower, freer
tell me how you want to be
victimized by all you see
while you sleep tight tonight
i'm afraid i'll still be searching
deeper, farther, slower, freer
tell me how you want to be
victimized by all you see
while you sleep tight tonight
i'm afraid i'll still be searching fo whats right.
come face me, come phase me
come face me, come phase me
come face me, come phase me
come face me, come phase me
the system alive, the choke hold of time
the system alive, come phase my life
i'll face my life, come phase my life
i'll face my life.
