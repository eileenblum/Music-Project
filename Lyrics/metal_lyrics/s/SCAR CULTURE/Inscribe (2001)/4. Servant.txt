God bless my curse. why heal? this gift hurts. The
fire has died? still i'm
tortured by the burn inside. but you didn't have
fucking thing to do with
it, you never played a goddamn part in it, i've given
so much i'll die in
it, you still feel its your right to fuck with it....i
was never pushed, i
fucking let go, you never pushed me you fuck, you
think i'd give you the
pleasure? Fail. I hope you fail in your life, i know
you've failed in your
mind...i've learnt what faliure is about, you fucking
dead sure i won't try?
if i cry then i can't see, these blood soaked tears
set me free, i drowned
these tears so i can see reality inside of me....i was
never pushed, i
fucking let go, you never pushed me you fuck, you
think i'd give you the
pleasure? is that what you believe, is that what you
fucking wanna hear? you
fucking know i'm real, you fucking know i'm here...i
know you inside out, i
know you better than i know myself......i serve you
better than i serve
myself...why? why, why is this in me. i'm breathing,
i'm praying to that
selfish god within me, to that hollow god that stalks
you. praise your
goddamn life, fulfill your goddamn life...praise your
goddamned life,
fulfill your goddamned life. stillborn liar, wartorn
liar, forlorn liar. i
may fail but you have to pick me up to see, i may fail
but you have to test
me out to see. i may fail but you have to pick me up
to see, i may fail but
you have to test me out to see. you scatter, but i
have to gather, fallen
all over and i will gather. you scatter, but i have to
gather, fallen all
over and i will gather. why?
