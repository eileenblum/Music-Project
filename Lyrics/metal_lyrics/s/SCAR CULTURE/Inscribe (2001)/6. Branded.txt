For life, by life.
Born into my skin, shedding filth within.
Final game of sin, breeding faith again
Step a little closer to see, touch upon the scar
that's healed
Every little bit of me rests upon the agony in my
head.
But I have seen the pain, covered scars still remain
Lost in my own game, I'm killing fate again
Branded-branded-branded-branded
crawl inside my head
But I have seen the pain, covered scars still remain
Lost in my own game, I'm killing fate again
Branded-branded-branded-branded
crawl inside my head
Branded for life
Branded for life
Branded by life.
