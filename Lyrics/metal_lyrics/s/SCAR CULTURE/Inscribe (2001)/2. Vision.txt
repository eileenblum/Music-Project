It rises it rises it rises it rises it rises
it rises it rises and my eyes
say and my eyes say and my eyes say
and my eyes say and my eyes say and my
eyes say push me away
Rage of inconsistence
a wall of inviting fading color.
I fade through your sight disguised.
And I will hand you this birth
Untie you with words
give you what i burned

A crutch of tunnel vision
forcefed denial- I reconcile
crave till I die.
And I will bleed you this world.
Untie you with words
forsake you this hurt.

And you can't reach for me
yet you reek of me
I'm still alive today
forcefed dreams will make you see.

I can't fuck with the minds of the brainless
found another way to get inside.
This shield has left you shameless
I'm witness to your suicide.
fall fall fall fall fall fall fall fall

Grow. Grow cold like me motherfucker.
Grow. Grow cold with me motherfucker.
My vision is endless
Mindfucking the brainless
My power relentless
Mindfucking the brainless.

For once my eyes are clear
No tunnel vision here.

Grow. Grow cold like me motherfucker.
Grow. Grow cold with me motherfucker.
My vision is endless
My power relentless
My vision is endless
My power relentless.
