My blood runs free now, done feeling defiled.
Strike that which poisoned me before
my sweet denial.
I've hidden for longer than i can say.
Salvation lies in those who don't betray.

I've curled up, obsessed about it, for far too
goddamned long.
With my eyes red, and a heaviness, I stumbled to your
door.
(and you heard me, and you welcomed me, and you hid
me, and you cleared me... and you held me, and you
opened me, and you helped me because they raped me)
I've felt I've come alive, I owe you so much more than
my life. It's like every sign I knew was true, hand me
my life, my mind with you.

I served my time alone, I served my time alone.
They had trapped my life, concealed my time, help make
it die...
I served my time alone, I served my time alone.
They had trapped my life, concealed my time, help make
it die...

I saw the blood in your hair. Relive it. Relive it.
Relive it. Relive it. Relive it. Relive it. Relive it.
Relive it. Relive it. ( I think I'll keep it to
myself. I think I'll keep it to myself. I think I'll
keep it to myself. I think I'll keep it to myself.)
