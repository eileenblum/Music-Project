Drown my eyes
Fight, rise, cry
leave my mind bare to die.

My face shows no soul
Skin torn, I'm growing cold
My mind won't start alone
Fuck yourself, shut up and die
I still can't hear your cries
these bloody veins will rise
scarred through from pain inside
Fuck yourself, leave me to die.

Razor bath, worn down path
Painless graft, my last laugh?
Torn of soul, dead alone
no more bullshit leave me bare to die

No one has seen what's happened here alone
it's my respect this fight has now dethroned
No one cares what happened here alone
curse this fucking lifeless soul.

My face shows no soul
Skin torn, I'm growing cold
My mind won't start alone
Fuck yourself, shut up and die
I still can't hear your cries
these bloody veins will rise
scarred through from pain inside
Fuck yourself, leave me to die.
I'm dead alone.
