Humans feed off bullshit...a numbing reminder from
this self-induced critic.
I proved what I already know.
If I stood here much longer I couldn't take myself for
much more than what
you already think I am. Faith was found in my self.

What is it they're looking at? What is it they're
talking at? What is it
about you? What inspires me to attack this hollow?
this shelter? this cover?
This is more than I ever want to show through my
eyes...infect me...reform
me...inscribe me...release me...(for haven't you
taught me i'm worthless?)

Call upon your sense of self...that natural gift they
took from
you...they've killed for your mind....they've raped
your soul...and you let
them? Don't they realize these are lives. These are
lives. Yours are lies.
Yours are lies.

They have raped your minds, now hear them cry out, get
out, cry out, get
out. You fanatic christian-muslim fucks. If I believe
everything you preach
and every word you spit out blindly, then all you've
truly taught me is
godhates, godhates, godhates, godhates, godhates,
godhates, godhates,
godhates, godhates, godhates, godhates, godhates,
godhates, godhates,
godhates, godhates, godhates, godhates, godhates,
godhates, godhates,
godhates, godhates, godhates
