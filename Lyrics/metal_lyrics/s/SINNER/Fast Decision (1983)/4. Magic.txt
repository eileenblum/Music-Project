Hey-ho good old friend
Let me ask today
Tell her that her fire's ceasing me
Tell he that 1'11 run her
When being afraid,
When lonely troubles go my way
I know there's nothing I could do
The real love is true
I'm gonna do the mjngs for her
It was he I got her at my sight
And faded all my fears
In everything the light goes to
Tell her that nothing has changed
Take a dream with me, the feeling's so strange
Oh I miss her, it was shocking wild
The little romance of my life

She's magic,
She is your magic
Magic,
She is your magic, oh

Hey-ho good old friend
Come and close your eyes
And see my magic girl when people run
Maybe you tell her with a look of love
I can't forget her I'm hungry for her love
No, there's nothing I could do
The real love is true
I'm gonna do the minds further
I'll run, I got her at my sight
Running all the dreams
And everything that I could do

She's magic,
She is your magic
Magic,
She is your magic, oh

No, there's nothing I could do
The real love is true
I'm gonna do the minds further
I'll run, I got her at my sight
Running all the dreams
And everything that I could do
