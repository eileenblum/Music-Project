You are the beauty you think
You've been good to go
You stole my heart you grabbed my soul
All people now know

Let me be it is my life
Let me be
Let me be running wild, running wild
And l won't be wrong on that way any more

Running wild,
Running wild through your lies
Running wild at the daylight
Set me free, and l want to go
I'm running wild through lies to the light

I thought I can rock with angel
And that you are indeed
I know you're so wicked baby girl
Is this a marry you need

Let me be it is my life
Let me be
Let me be running wild, running wild
And l won't be on wrong headway any more
Running wild,
Running wild through your lies
Running wild at the daylight
Set me free, and I want to go
I'm running wild through lies to the light
