They won't let me go
Oh I'm doing things my way
I will every time hope
I have no things to say
That was doing right
They shouted where to move
I looked through the watching mirrors
And l saw you

They went to see the look in your eyes
That leaving beauty and I wonder it guys

It's crazy, turning me to madness
Madness, making me crazy
In the dark of the night
I give out to the endless reasons
I'm not so mad fool to stay
And not so strong to go

I dropped mirrors from the bar
We're not watching another day

It's crazy, turning me to madness
And it's madness, making me crazy

Talking and laughing in all the means
I break in the chase from the eyes
You hardly ever see
I may be running or die so far
I'm real scared, I'm struck, my mind blows

It's crazy, turning me to madness
Madness, making me crazy
