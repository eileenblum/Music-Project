You know you made me tonight
I'm alone beyond the city sight
My mind is gone my heart beats up
My scream for banging will never stop
We lay all the lies out
No tales no more
A young playing is over
I learned it all

Fast decision of ups and downs
Fast decision of fact and founds
Fast decision that makes you thrill
Fast decision's got a deal

Step through New York
I'm gonna kill it - the other one
Just tell me what you've got
But this is what you have every betray of your will
You know I made it
What fits you ever
I've decided,
Yeah

Fast decision of ups and downs
Fast decision of fact and founds
Fast decision that makes you thrill
Fast decision's got a deal
