One day we could serve to a crown
But in the same day we would play just too loud
We go to a smart-sell in green
And we'll see the friends all out in the city

Uh, in the city
Uh, in the city

Some rafters can't to a town
Where were wonders who did this rocking sound
The next one that's to pour more yells
And we have to go with our jam

Uh, in the city
Uh, in the city

This way great in this night
Well this is where we...
This is to romance

We don't care for heavy weather rising
We're going down and down
It is the girl's eye
It's heavy knock and our heads are rising high
We are really good friends, beneath it all lies

Uh, in the city
Uh, in the city
I me you before in the city lights,
Oh yeah it was in the city
