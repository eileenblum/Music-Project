Scream out loud
We're breaking the new
We started to play the ground
Hear the rocking the sound

We're rocking the town
We're ready to rock the town
We drink too much but score on the right score
And when we pray it feels the darkest night

Tough boys rock boys
Rocking the town
Tough boys we're ready to rock

We got a fellow, one else
When he's rocking the tunes
We're playing faster and faster
Like a blowing detector

We're rocking the town
We're ready to rock the town
We drink too much but score on the right score
And when we pray it feels the darkest night

Tough boys rock boys
Rocking the town
Tough boys we're ready to rock

When we're through the lights
And walk on the crowd
So it all feels
Let me eel your reacts

We're rocking the town
We're ready to rock the town
We drink too much but score on the right score
And when we pray it feels the darkest night

Tough boys rock boys
Rocking the town
Tough boys we're ready to rock
