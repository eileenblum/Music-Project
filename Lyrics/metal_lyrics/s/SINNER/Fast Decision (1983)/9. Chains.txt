Nobody takes my warning
That night is often bold
The street night cold
As I look around it's too late
I can't believe a silence right along the way
I thought I lot my mind
There was no chance to try to escape

Breaking the chains
Breaking the chains
On those chains
Breaking the chains

I crook off, far goes the stairway down the tomb
And through the trial soul pretender
I fight against her soft cursing me, God blessed
And I open chains, I'll go my way
I can't surrender

Breaking the chains
Breaking the chains
On those chains
Breaking the chains
Breaking the chains
Breaking the chains
On those chains
Breaking the chains
