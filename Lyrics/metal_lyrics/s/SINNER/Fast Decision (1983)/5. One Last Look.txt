Song plays on the radio
I got a lonesome feeling played right
Maybe I'm wrong but no one tells me why
It feels so strange
Strange desire

I thought I knew you so well
But since you left me babe,
I would tell you my life is like hell

One last curse
One last no one's will
One last look
One last sign of a sigh
One last look

Give me one last look in your face
I'm walking through pouring rain
And pain
I'm thinking of days we had
I'm going through photographs
I need you so bad and it seems so sad
I feel the pain, the pain in my heart

One last curse
One last no one's will
One last look
One last sign of a sigh
One last look
