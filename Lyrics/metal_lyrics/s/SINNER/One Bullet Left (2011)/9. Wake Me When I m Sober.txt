I've heard your screams a thousand times
All your stories, all your lies
The things you've done and all you've seen

The stars you've met the girls you've had
Your fantasy world is all you have
But I don't want to hear it
Over and over again

And I won't answer your calls

Gimme a break - Wake me when I'm sober
Give it up - Wake me when I'm sober
Cause late is great for me

Buy me whiskey, wine or beer
More is enough that I can't hear
Comatose would be just right for me

No I won't answer your calls

Gimme a break - Wake me when I'm sober
Give it up - Wake me when I'm sober
Cause late is great for me

Don't blame me - But I don't believe
A single word you're saying
I'm already gone, you talked far too long
So don't call me again &amp; again
And I don't call you

Gimme a break - Wake me when I'm sober
Give it up - Wake me when I'm sober
Cause late would be great for me

Gimme a break - Wake me when I'm sober
Give it up - Wake me when I'm sober
Cause late would be great for me
