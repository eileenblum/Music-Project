And as the thunder roared
I just realized
Seems it's just too late
I'm standing here defenceless

You showed your pretty side
And not the one that lies
You left me, my hands tied
I want my life back

Can you take this pain
Away from me and set me free
I hear the 1-2-3-4-5

In this world of lies
The scars will never heal
It's a game of give &amp; take
In this pool of blood
And no one knows the deal
It's a game of give &amp; take

I'm not afraid and it's not too late
Just wash away the blood from my hands

At this moment I don't care
Nothing you can do to me
Enough is enough in all reality

Don't pretend to understand
You held my heart in your hands
I hear the 1-2-3-4-5

In this world of lies
The scars will never heal
It's a game of give &amp; take
And no one knows the deal
Now it's my turn to take
