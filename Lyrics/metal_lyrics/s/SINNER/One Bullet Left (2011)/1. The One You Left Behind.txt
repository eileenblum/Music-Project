When you're left out in the cold
Under the neon lights
Feel one step away from heartache

You see the world through different eyes
Was good turned bad - There's no disguise
Laying on the ground
Another lonely heart - You tore apart

Don't look back (don't look back)
I'm the one you left behind
And now the wind blows cold

And now the morning's dressed in black
My body aches - I'm felling wrecked
I'm going crazy
I know that you, ain't coming back

Still hear your morning's dressed in black
The lonely sound, the closing door
Turns my heart into a stone
Just waiting, all alone

Don't look back (don't look back)
I'm the one you left behind
Never be the same
Don't look back (don't look back)
On the one you left behind
So let the cold winds blow
