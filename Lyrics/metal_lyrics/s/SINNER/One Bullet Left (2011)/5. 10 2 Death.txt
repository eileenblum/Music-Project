Move too fast
Think too slow
Talk too easy
Told you so
Here I am
Behind the bars
Ain't too pretty
Collecting scars

Why me?
Can't see
They wronged the rights out for me
No fight goodnight
10 to death and I'm ready to die
10 to death and I'm ready to die

All it took was just one little look
Took the wrong road
To the corner where she stood
Got my jackknife no time to mess around
Don't take no fortune teller
To predict I'm going down
Predict I'm going down

10 to death and I'm ready to die
10 to death and I'm ready to die

I feel it creepin in my veins
When I stop movin my heart will do the same
Ain't been to heaven, that's as sure as hell
What a way to go, nobody else can tell
Nobody else can tell

10 to death and I'm ready to die
10 to death and I'm ready to die
