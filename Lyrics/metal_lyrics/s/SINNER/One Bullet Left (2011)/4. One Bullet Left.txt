All hands on deck
Cos we're back on track
And riding the eye of the storm
The amps are on ten - We're ready to rock

Knocked down many times
Out for the count
But there ain't no doubt
I'm on my way back
I'm on the attack

Sirens scream in the distance
There's just a bullet and gun

Just rock the night, into the light - Just rock
Just raise your hands
Until the end
There's one bullet left
Rock through the night,
Hell is in sight - Just rock
Just raise your hands until the end
There's one bullet left

The highway's in sight
and no stop sign ahead
I'll drive the road to hell
The bad times al gone
And I'm out on the road alone

A shout without warning
Heat without fire
Nothing will keep me down
I'm back in the race gonna lay you low
