D'you hear that distant rumble
Coming up from far beyond
Where people think the hunt is still a game
There'll be no more need to fear
Sanctuary no one sees
Come with me on my last mission

There is no escape whatever you will do
There is no more hate - Just turn another screw

I'm back - With a suicide mission
And you ain't never coming back
It's my decision
On a suicide mission

It was friday night,
We're all in drinking mode
The music spurs us on
And we're all on parole

Gotta band that's palying loud groovin to the sound
Until the sun comes up and the wolves are gonna howl

I'm back - With a suicide mission
And you ain't never coming back
It's my decision
On a suicide mission

If you got your one way ticket
And you're ready to go
It's my decision
On a suicide mission

There is no escape whatever you will do
There is no more hate - Just turn another screw

I'm back - With a suicide mission
