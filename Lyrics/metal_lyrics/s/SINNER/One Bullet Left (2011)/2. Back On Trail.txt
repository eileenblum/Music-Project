Down at the corner lived the man in black
Was always smiling and some called him jack
His real name was billy
And he couldn't make it back
Few years ago

He was a Romeo for lonely girls
Wore a ring with a big black pearl
But then there came a night
His heart was broken
And it's so hard to mend

I'm back on the trail - Back on the trail
Let me make it clear
I'm back on the trail - Back on the trail
I don't have to play around

He wrote his songs for all the girls
A glass of red wine in his hand
Then came the one she stole his heart
Don't you know true love can kill

This is the story of a broken heart
And you think this could be me
And you'd swear if you looked in my eyes
You might see the trace of a tear

I'm back on the trail - Back on the trail
Let me make it clear
I'm back on the trail - Back on the trail
I don't have to play around

I don't play around
What comes up must come down
Let me make this clear
C'mon over
