You're not alone - So don't be afraid

Spend all my time thinking of you
Just the ghost of you
Walking through my mind

Just sitting here in my empty room
When it was me and you
Reminded again and again
That I don't want to lose

As I walk alone here
In the shadows - I'm haunted
As I walk alone here
This lonely road - I'm haunted
As I walk alone here
In the shadows - I'm haunted
As I walked here
I'm haunted

With the sound of the closing door
I knew you were gone
But can't you understand
I can't face this world alone

As I walk alone here
In the shadows - I'm haunted
As I walk alone here
This lonely road - I'm haunted
As I walk alone here
In the shadows - I'm haunted
As I walked here
I'm haunted

I'm all alone here
I feel so afraid
