He was born to a simple family
Raised up with two brothers
School, soccer, drinks &amp; girls
Another teenage drama

Wanted to travel the world
Felt he could rock them all
But today his heart turns to stone

Feels like rolling away
Sailing into heavy rain
Rolling away

Since that day he lost it all
We haven't seen each other
And a lot time has passed
Feels like I lost a brother

Just the look in his eyes was enough
Mirror reflects a broken man
Well we won't understand

Feels like rolling away
Sailing into heavy rain
Rolling away
Feels like rolling away
Sailing into heavy rain
Rolling away

The day turns into night
It's only dark without a light
I was just back on the streets again
It was the night we all lost him again
