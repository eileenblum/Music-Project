I feel the pressure rising
But made my stand won't run away
The eyes they hide behind their lies
A little hatred burns in me

It's no more than I expected
Things I could never believe
The time is coming soon
All debts are gonna be collected

Burning bridges - There's no freeze over
Burning bridges - Don't want to talk it over
All these rules unspoken
Are meant to be broken

Burning bridges - Till hell freezes over
Burning bridges - Don't want to talk it over
All these rules unspoken
My heart ain't meant to be broken

Yeah you broke the rules
And crossed that thin line
I will send you no warnings
Too late, you'll see the signs

I don't believe a word
You say you lost your way
Now you're standing alone
Won't see another day
