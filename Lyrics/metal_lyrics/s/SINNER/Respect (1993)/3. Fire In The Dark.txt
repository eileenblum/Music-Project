There is something you are not saying
But I can see it when I look in your eyes
There is a game that you are playing
Oh babe, I can see it through your disguise
Shadows moving cross the bedroom
Slowly faded as they hiding from the light 
How much more we hold out before
You break down and tell me
What you are trying to do
But if you don't there is so much that we can loose

Can't stop the boring rain
You can't hide your burning heart
You can't hide the fire in the dark
A fire in the dark

When you have any feelings
It don't make it easy for my heart
Whenever we are together
I know if you will say it
It will tear us apart

Can't stop the boring rain
You can't hide your burning heart
You can't hide the fire in the dark
Can't stop the boring rain
You can't hide your burning heart
You can't hide the fire in the dark

You can run, you can hide
But sooner or later you'll be mine
Don't hold back, don't hesitate 
Make up your mind before it's too late

Can't stop the boring rain
You can't hide your burning heart
You can't hide the fire in the dark
Can't stop the boring rain
You can't hide your burning heart
You can't hide the fire in the dark

A fire in the dark

There is something you are not saying
But I can see it when I look in your eyes
