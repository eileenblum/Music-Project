I must have been dreaming
While I'm sitting here alone
You and I together, it seems so long ago
We were friends, we were lovers, we were fools
I feel your heartbeat
Have I really lost it all?

Where Have our plans gone
The clouds pass by
I feel a raindrop falling from the sky
Moving circles I've lost your trace
I still see your face in every wave
Who was right and who was wrong
We're gone through deepest trouble
We need another chance

Give me just a piece of your heart
I keep it for me
I saw the valley of tears
Give me just a piece of your heart
I try to heel it â I saw the valley of tears

Going back to my hotel and I open up the door
The phone is ringing â I hear your voice
It's good to hear you two weeks gone by
My will as grouch no fortune, but I'm standing at your side

Who was right and who was wrong
We're gone through deepest trouble
We need another chance

Give me just a piece of your heart
I keep it for me
I saw the valley of tears
Give me just a piece of your heart
I try to heel it â I saw the valley of tears

You gave me passion
I've never crossed the secret ways
You gave tenderness, I'm not lying to myself

Who was right and who was wrong
We're gone through deepest trouble
We need another chance

Give me just a piece of your heart
I keep it for me
I saw the valley of tears
Give me just a piece of your heart
I try to heel it â I saw the valley of tears
