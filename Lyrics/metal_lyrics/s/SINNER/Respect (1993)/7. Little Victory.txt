We started as friends, let our hairs grow
We played Hendrix stuff
The untamed blood of rock'n'roll
We played every club, never give it up
Hometown heroes with little victories

A new start, a new step forward the next record should it be
Mistakes so many done before and cheated by the bizz
'Til the next contract
The professional deal
We got some great releases toured the land indeed
A thousand people chant
They're clapping their hands
I saw a lot of pictured of mine in the magazines

But trails instead of music
The sales were not the deal
The band broke up but we're still friends and jamming till today

Should I be
Or should I say I had enough
Should I be
I'm going straight when others talk
Got my records on the wall
Every bass a memory
This can't be defeat
It's my little, little victory

Next was the big thing
The money was there
Videos in the makin'
They know how a different thing
Friends if it works out great
Suckers if not
I remember when we started to rock

Oh now here I'm standing, not for the money just for fun
I spend so many years to rock
With the guts to rock on

Should I be
Or should I say I had enough
Should I be
I'm going straight when others talk
Got my records on the wall
Every bass a memory
This can't be defeat
It's my little, little victory
