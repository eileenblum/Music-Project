In the darkest night, I call your name
And I'm knocking at your door
I know talking is not touching
Our dreams have come and gone
Is it any wonder that I doubt on your real love
My heart won't believing
That our best days are gone...

Baby please, please tell me
What's so bad about feeling good
Baby please, please tell me
What's so bad about feeling good
If I don't act like the way I should

It was the longest night, I've ever spent alone
And I'm waiting desperately
I know it takes a little time
That our wounds will ever heel
Babe I feel the fire burning deep down in my soul
Things wound get better
If you stand up for our love

Baby please, please tell me
What's so bad about feeling good
I saw the border of heaven
But now these days are gone
Baby please, please tell me
What's so bad about feeling good
If I don't act like I really should

I feel the fire burning deep down in my soul
Things wound get better
If you stand up for our love

Baby please, please tell me
What's so bad about feeling good
I saw the border of heaven
But now these days are gone
Baby please, please tell me
What's so bad about feeling good
I saw the border of heaven
But now these days are gone
Baby please, please tell me
What's so bad about feeling good
If I don't act like I really should

How about feeling good?
