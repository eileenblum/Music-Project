Love is a child that's been hurt
Taken for granted too long
If silence speaks louder than words
Then maybe it's time to move on
Can you pick up the pieces of broken dreams
Or have we pushed it too far

How long can we go on
Have we come to end of the road
Can we bring back the hope or is it said and done
Don't let this dream die young

We had all we could pray for
Nothing could take that away
Then we woke up one day and nothing seemed right 
Now we're dreaming on better days
But nothing is really as sad as it seems
If you look for the good in between

How long can we go on
Have we come to end of the road
Can we bring back the hope or is it said and done
Don't let this dream die young

A little hope, a little faith
We keep this dream alive
Love deserves a second chance
You belong by my side

But nothing is really as bad as it seems
If you look for the good in between

How long can we go on
Have we come to end of the road
Can we bring back the hope or is it said and done

How long can we go on
Have we come to end of the road
Can we bring back the hope or is it said and done
Don't let this dream die young

Die young

Can we bring back the hope or is it said and done
Don't let this dream die young
