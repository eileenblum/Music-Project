The phone rings in the afternoon
I feel the coming for bad news
you're the knife in my heart
And made it bleed it outs so deep

You sold me your angel's smile
You promised me heaven but you played a game
You looked at me with those innocent eyes
Where you telling me lies

I'm walking down the lonely street at night
A broken heart, a broken dream, I'm a fool
But I'm still loving you â knife in my heart
It hurts so bad â knife in my heart
Leaving scars forever

In a world where love is lost
Returns the once in a lifetime feeling again
I'm not the kind of man
Who hides his feeling for you
I strolled down the streets with a six pages in my hands
There's still the hunger deep inside
You need me and nothing in the world could change it

I'm walking down the lonely street at night
A broken heart, a broken dream, I'm a fool
But I'm still loving you â knife in my heart
It hurts so bad â knife in my heart
Leaving scars forever
