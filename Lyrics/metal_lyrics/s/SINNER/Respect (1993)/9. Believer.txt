We are the victims, we are the fools
We are the mob the rules
Violation is discrimination
It's sad but it's true

The brown right arrow flies to kill we break into applause
Contaminated with disgrace
I'm waiting, still waiting

But I won't back down
I'm on this road too long
I will raise my son
Cause I'm a believer
Believer

Everything we do or say
Comes back into our lives
And hurts as good as our hits
I'm waiting â still waiting

But I'm not afraid
I don't think it's too late
Love creates and I'm a creator
And won't back down,
I'm on this road too long
I will raise my son 'cause I'm a believer, believer
