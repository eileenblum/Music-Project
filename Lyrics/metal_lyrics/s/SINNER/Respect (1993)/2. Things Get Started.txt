I'm just a mile from heaven
I'm halfway through hell
They wanna save my soul
But I'm doin' it by myself

Gimme gimme just a little
More time, you can't undress me with your eyes
My independence and memories
I can't stand against forbidden things
I'm tired of waiting
Tangled in a web of desire
Your poisoned snake-bite
Standing in a line of fire

When the things get started â I'm running around
The tough gets go â ready to go
When the things get started â I'm doing on my knees
Oh oh â the tough gets go

I'm in the center of a hopeless storm
I don't lose thunder
Until my blood runs cold
Danger's looking in a little white dress
I'm losing a war inside of me
Virgin words, so fresh and new â what can I do?

I'm tired of waiting
Tangled in a web of desire
Your poisoned snake-bite
Standing in a line of fire

When the things get started â I'm running around
The tough gets go â ready to go
When the things get started â I'm doing on my knees
Oh oh â the tough gets go

Oh â the tough gets go

I'm tired of waiting
Tangled in a web of desire
Your poisoned snake-bite
Standing in a line of fire

When the things get started â I'm running around
The tough gets go â ready to go
When the things get started â I'm doing on my knees
Oh oh â the tough gets go
