I've been up, I've been down
Got my hands on the trigger, my feet touch the ground
Up and down â see the world in motion
A dangerous ground

Oh oh â she's talks dirty
Oh oh â that girl she's hot â she's tough
When you see her dance you'll swear on her love
Let's keep it all together
Let's dream a dangerous dream

Where do we go
My heart is in your hands
Where do we go
It's forever â my heart is in your hands

My heart burns, my heart beats
My body steamin' from my head to my feet
You and me â baby we got our own destiny

Oh oh â a perfect combination
Oh oh â fascination
Me and you, we're far enough to break every rule

Let's keep it all together
Let's dream a dangerous dream

Where do we go
My heart is in your hands
Where do we go
It's forever â my heart is in your hands

You like the shattered dream
A man in love

I've been up, I've been down
Got my hands on the trigger, my feet touch the ground
Up and down â see the world in motion
A dangerous ground

Oh oh â she's talks dirty
Oh oh â that girl she's hot â she's tough
When you see her dance you'll swear on her love
Let's keep it all together
Let's dream a dangerous dream

Where do we go
My heart is in your hands
Where do we go
It's forever â my heart is in your hands

You like the shattered dream
A man in love
