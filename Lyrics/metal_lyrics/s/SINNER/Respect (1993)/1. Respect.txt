I had an Italian friend, killed by Italian skinheads
'Cause he drove a car with a German number plate
I had a German friend, trashed by German skinheads
Their only motive â he was black
There's no sense in burning a helpless child
No regrets, no argument why

We never forget, their leader is dead
They deal with death, our pulse goes over the edge
They've got no respect

Their targets are the weak,
Foreigners, the defenseless
A little, but loud minority wanna see fear in our eyes
Shaved heads, at home a child
On the streets a killing rat
Cowardly alone, a murder in the pack
Blood and Hooligans on every TV news
Cultures in rage and new frontiers

We never forget, their leader is dead
They deal with death, our pulse goes over the edge
They've got no respect

Humane race, black or white
It's up to you and me to reach out our hands
A necessary respect

No religion, no church, no politician
We're bored of hackneyed words instead of facts

We never forget, their leader is dead
They deal with death, our pulse goes over the edge
They've got no respect

Humane race, black or white
It's up to you and me to reach out our hands
A necessary respect

A little respect
They've got no respect
Just a little respect
A necessary respect
