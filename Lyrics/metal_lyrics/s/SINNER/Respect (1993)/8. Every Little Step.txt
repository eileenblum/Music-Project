As the sun goes down, we made a promise
That nothing will tear us apart
And we'll never pretending
I threw all the beers and vodkas away
For you I said goodbye to yesterday
There's no turning back
I don't play the game of truth and dare
There's nobody between us
You're all that I care

Every little step
I'll be with you
Every little step
That we've been through
Every little step
I told you, that we're going there through
My heart beats for you

I don't gave my heart for satisfaction
I need more than a pretty face
I left undone some sweet attractions
Peace and love is so hard to find
But I know some places where we can hide
To left our love grow

I don't play the game of truth and dare
There's nobody between us
You're all that I care

Every little step
I'll be with you
Every little step
That we've been through
Every little step
I told you, that we're going there through

There's something I know,
Something I know deep inside me 
There is something I know,
You still got my belief
I really stand beside you

I built up a house around love and faith
With a wall around, nobody can burn down
This bound of love
This bound of love is too strong to break and nothing can tear us apart
Since our last day on earth

I don't play the game of truth and dare
There's nobody between us
You're all that I care

Every little step
I'll be with you
Every little step
That we've been through
Every little step
I told you, that we're going there through

Every little step
I'll be with you
Every little step
That we've been through
Every little step
I told you, that we're going there through
My heart beats for you
