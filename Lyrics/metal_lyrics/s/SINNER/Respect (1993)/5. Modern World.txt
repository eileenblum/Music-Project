Give me one good reason for a world like this
A disaster â the kiss of death
Shame on you and shame on me
Shame on you and shame on me
Darkest visions are reality
Can't read the future is it better there
We're one step closer 'til the end of time
The promise of peace is about to die

I lost all my belief in the church and politicians
When brother kills brother, it's no time for lies

This ain't no prayer â I say no no no
This ain't no prayer â For modern world
This ain't no prayer â I say no no no
This ain't no prayer â For modern world

See the evil behind their smiling masks
Can you imagine, what's going on inside of 'em
They sold the earth, the animals killed
They breed human machines without a will

I lost all my belief in the church and politicians
When brother kills brother, it's no time for lies

This ain't no prayer â I say no no no
This ain't no prayer â For modern world
This ain't no prayer â I say no no no
This ain't no prayer â For modern world

Give me one good reason for a world like this
Corruption â on poisoned sand
I'm bored of all discussion now
Clouds so dark like never before

I lost all my belief in the church and politicians
When brother kills brother, it's no time for lies

This ain't no prayer â I say no no no
This ain't no prayer â For modern world
This ain't no prayer â I say no no no
This ain't no prayer â For modern world
