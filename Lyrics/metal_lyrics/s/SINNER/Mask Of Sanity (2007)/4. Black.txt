She was young, she was sweet, 
Dressed in black, danced to the beat
She was fallen from the darkside
I kissed her lips, felt her skin
Touched her heart, I can't go back 
The world was turning upside down

She healed my wounds, 
She drank my blood
I'm leaving this world, 
A new demention calls

She can't see me, 
She can't hear me,
But she feels me 
And the girl in black 
She stole my bleeding heart

In the heat of the night
I touched her heart
I felt her lips
She came from out of no where

She healed my wounds 
She drank my blood
I'm leaving this world 
A new demention calls

She can't see me, 
She can't hear me
But she feels me 
And the girl in black 
She stole my bleeding heart

She can't see me, 
She can't hear me
But she feels me 
And the girl in black 
She stole my bleeding heart

She can't see me, 
She can't hear me
But she feels me 
And the girl in black 
She stole my bleeding heart

She can't see me, 
She can't hear me
But she feels me 
And the girl in black 
She stole my bleeding heart
