[Music &amp; Lyrics: Mat Sinner]

Automatic action follow my reaction
The spy eye is watching you
Living to their rhythm, the atomic age
Democracy's bleeding for fools
Even not save are your dreams - the total control
Rebellion rise

Smoke on the wind
We're spitting flames, oh the angels aside
The meltdown of heaven, upon this sign
We'll finish so many lies
When silence falls

Laughing is weakness
Short haired and shaved
The rivers are rotten to death
Contaminate ground
For a degenerated future- control
That's what it's all about
Fast working marionettes
No human rights - rebellion rise

Smoke on the wind
We're spitting flames, oh the angels aside
The meltdown of heaven, upon this sign
We'll finish so many lies
When silence falls

We face the distance the sky
Fight for the truth- rebellion rise

Smoke on the wind
We're spitting flames, oh the angels aside
The meltdown of heaven, upon this sign
We'll finish so many lies
When silence falls
