[Music: Mat Sinner, Tom Naumann - Lyrics: Mat Sinner]

Daddy - things have changed
Since you were young
So don't tell me what to do
Let me hate this man
Who don't know his kids
Working day and night
Daddy - he's pretending his family

I don't know
What you've been told
But I know
That we'd been sold

Fear, hate, love and emotion
I don't need your roses of yesterday
Fear, hate, love and emotion
I don't need your roses of yesterday

Look
At his ruler of this little world
He wants me to be
His own marionette
I got the women he wants
Got my peace of mind
Do you hear me daddy

I put a Voodoo spell on him

I don't know what you've been told
But I know that we'd been sold

Fear, hate, love and emotion
I don't need your roses of yesterday
Fear, hate, love and emotion
I don't need your roses of yesterday

Roses of yesterday
Own will is anarchy
Let me hate him, uh

I don't know what you've been told
But I know that we'd been sold

Fear, hate, love and emotion
I don't need your roses of yesterday
Fear, hate, love and emotion
I don't need your roses of yesterday
