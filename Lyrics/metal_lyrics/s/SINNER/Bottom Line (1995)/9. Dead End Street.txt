[Music: Mat Sinner, Tom Naumann - Lyrics: Mat Sinner]

I never took the easy way
I gave you everything you want
I don't want to fight you
Gave up things I donât want to
And gave you shelter every day
And I was lonely

These are the good times
With pleasure and pain
We're missing the light till the end
Into these nights
I don't know witch way to chose
I found myself
In a dead end street

One day I came home late
And you just turned away
You left so many things unspoken
Expected too much
I must get out of your touch
I don't care

These are the good times
With pleasure and pain
We're missing the light till the end
Into these nights
I don't know witch way to chose
I found myself
In a dead end street

This taste of heaven turns
Into a nightmare
You will sit around and wonder
When I'm gone for days

These are the good times
With pleasure and pain
We're missing the light till the end
Into these nights
I don't know witch way to chose
I found myself
In a dead end street
