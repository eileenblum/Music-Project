[Music &amp; Lyrics: Mat Sinner]

I take enough
Enough of what I got
Too slick to catch for you
I'm out on the highway to the moon
There is no turning back
There's a force beyond my power
To hunting you
In every minute

I'm out to catch you baby
I know there is a deal
I just follow your trace
I'm ready listen to the road of my machine

Honey want you fly on wings of steel
Baby take this trip of chroming wheels
We know what to do this time
When heaven cries to fools
We're both made of iron
Hearts of steel

Suspicious breeding babe
This town is goin' insane
I got the kick-start to your love
You learned your lesson so fast
Jump on my back and hold
Break out and turn it up

Put your best dress baby
You know there is a deal
Spinning round
And round you're ready
Living in freedom
That's what we need

Honey want you fly on wings of steel
Baby take this trip of chroming wheels
We know what to do this time
When heaven cries to fools
We're both made of iron
Hearts of steel

I'm out to catch you baby
I know there is a deal
I just follow your trace
I'm ready listen to the road of my machine

Honey want you fly on wings of steel
Baby take this trip of chroming wheels
We know what to do this time
When heaven cries to fools
We're both made of iron
Hearts of steel
