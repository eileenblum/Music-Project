[Music &amp; Lyrics: Mat Sinner, Marc Ribler, Doug Varty]

If eyes are the windows to the soul
When I look into yours I'll know
I'll see all the answers
To the question that troubled me

Don't roll always this ball of confusion
You roll away
All my heartache

When the rain falls down on me
You cover my heart
You make it alright, baby
When the wind blows cold it's warm inside
You make me, make it alright

When you come to me like a child
Frightened from the dark
I'll hold you till daylight comes
Until you feel safe again

I'll roll away all of your heartache
I'll roll away all of your fears baby

When the rain falls down hard on you
I'll cover your heart
I'll make it alright, baby
When the wind blows cold
I'll stand by your side
I'll make it, make it alright

As your life goes on
There's one thing we can count on
We've got something so strong
When there's no hope inside
Well make, make it alright

When the rain falls down on me
You cover my heart
You make it alright, baby
When the wind blows cold
It's warm inside
You make me, make it alright

When the rain falls down hard on you
I cover your heart
I'll make it alright, baby
When the wind blows cold
I stand by your side
I'll make, I make it alright

You make me it alright
