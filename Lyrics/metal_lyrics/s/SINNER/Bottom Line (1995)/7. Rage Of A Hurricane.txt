[Music &amp; Lyrics: Mat Sinner, Henry Wolter]

Mama told me not to come in the evening sun
We're going down the tracks
Baby do you hear me- I'm on my way to the promised land
Don't you ever need me - where's my gun

Runnin'- into the rage of a hurricane
Runnin'- into the eye of the storm
Runnin'- into the rage of a hurricane
Mama told me not to go on

I was out for the weekend
Even just to flirt with you
When I saw you standing at the corner of Billy's Pub
Baggin' for a hand of dollars
You cheated my wheel of fortune
Wrapped me around your fingers
I crossed the Bridge of lust
I was tangled in your net of linger
Don't you ever need me - where's my gun

Runnin'- into the rage of a hurricane
Runnin'- into the eye of the storm
Runnin'- into the rage of a hurricane
Mama told me not to go on
I felt a hammer in my brain
Don't let you drive in insane
I know you'll never learn
When worse comes to worse

I'm spending such a long time
Thinking about what you mean to me
I decided you're the wrong one, but there's a magnet in me
Telling me there's no desert I can hide
No ladder I can't climb
And I you hear the wolf howl baby
You can bet, I'm not your side
Don't you ever need me - where's my gun

Runnin'- into the rage of a hurricane
Runnin'- into the eye of the storm
Runnin'- into the rage of a hurricane
Mama told me not to go on
Runnin'- into the rage of a hurricane
Runnin'- into the rage of a hurricane
Runnin'- oh no, no, no
