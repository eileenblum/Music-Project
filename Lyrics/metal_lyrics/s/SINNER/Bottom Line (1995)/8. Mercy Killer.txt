[Music &amp; Lyrics: Mat Sinner]

If you get your papers
Two months time
Your cancer is deadly
No chance to heel
What will you do
With unbelievable hurt
If you had a wish
What will you do?

Is it blasphemy
When you dying free

Mercy killer
No future in his eyes
Mercy killer
He can read the signs
Mercy killer
Freedom is his mind
And who is God?

Machines are pumping
The brain is dead
Incurable injuries
Never can mend
Experiments
By medicine man
Dead bodies awake
Can drink or eat
Can even breath

Is it blasphemy
When you dying free

Mercy killer
No future in his eyes
Mercy killer
He can read the signs
Mercy killer
Freedom is his mind
And who is God?

If you watch
Your grandma paralyzed
Tears in her eyes
She can spell a word
But they don't let her die
That call it human
Thatâs Gods will
Children with tumors
Before they can walk
Before they can talk

Is it blasphemy
When you dying free

Mercy killer
No future in his eyes
Mercy killer
He can read the signs
Mercy killer
Freedom is his mind
And who is God?
