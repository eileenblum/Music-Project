[Music: Mat Sinner, Tom Naumann - Lyrics: Mat Sinner]

The place where innocence's dying
There is blood on the sand
Violence is a deadly game
No destination, frustration

The world goes screaming by
There's insanity and suicide
Save your personal holocaust
Say a little prayer tonight

In the heart of the young
Under a different moon
There is a rain in the desert
Heat on the ice
In the heart of the young
Nobody gives a dawn
In the heart of the young

We're heading
For the paradise
But we're stranded
On the dark side
Where you hear
The shotgun firing
Our earth is a graveyard

My body felt broken
As I realized
Thereâs no time for believing
No one breath
Between truth and lies

In the heart of the young
Under a different moon
There is a rain in the desert
Heat on the ice
In the heart of the young
Nobody gives a dawn
In the heart of the young

My body felt broken
As I realized
Thereâs no time for believing
No one breath
Between truth and lies

The world goes screaming by
There's insanity and suicide
Save your personal holocaust
Say a little prayer tonight

In the heart of the young
Under a different moon
There is a rain in the desert
Heat on the ice

In the heart of the young
Under a different moon
There is a rain in the desert
Heat on the ice
In the heart of the young
Nobody gives a dawn
In the heart of the young
