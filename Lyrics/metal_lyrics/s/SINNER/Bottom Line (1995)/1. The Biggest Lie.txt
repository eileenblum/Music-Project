[Music: Mat Sinner, Tom Naumann - Lyrics: Mat Sinner]

She's tough, she's rough - a full blooded girl but the danger talks
She's cool, not everybody's fool, she can handle the heat with you
Her trace - true lies, I saw her messing with you wrong stuff
I found her body lying down in the deepest gutter

It hits me like a hammer
No logic of instinct
I never know the reason
She's dying in my arms, I don't know why
The spoon, the needle are the biggest lie

Face to face, no enemy can hold me back,
I stop breathing I stop talking - My heart stop beating
Win or lose - second if you rely on dope,
Why did she take
The wrong train without me

It hits me like a hammer
No logic of instinct
I never know the reason
She's dying in my arms, I don't know why
The spoon, the needle are the biggest lie

Face to face, no enemy can hold me back,
I stop breathing I stop talking - My heart stop beating
Win or lose - second if you rely on dope,

It hits me like a hammer
No logic of instinct
I never know the reason
She's dying in my arms, I don't know why
The spoon, the needle are the biggest lie
