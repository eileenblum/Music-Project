[Music: Mat Sinner, Tom Naumann - Lyrics: Mat Sinner]

You say you're tired of living a senseless life
You gave your best
It was not enough
You surrender to all lies
You're talking of hanging up your dreams
But there's still something in your heart
You feel this little beat

There's a light at the end
There is hope and there is faith
Too soon to throw it all away

Say goodbye
To every dream you dreamed
A angel with broken wings
Don't wanna fly again
You're standing
On this burning bridge
Reaching for the sky
You close your eyes
A little tear and fly away

You're watching the falcon fly
So easy to do
Just turned away
Just for a second
Nobody listen to you
In the center of your darkest hour
You found yourself
In deepest desperation

There's a light at the end
There is hope and there is faith
Too soon to throw it all away

Say goodbye
To every dream you dreamed
A angel with broken wings
Don't wanna fly again
You're standing
On this burning bridge
Reaching for the sky
You close your eyes
A little tear and fly away
