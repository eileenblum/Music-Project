[Music &amp; Lyrics: Eric Martin, Neil Schon, Tom Fanuechi]

I can't stop the fire

Waiting for the right time
I'm ready to run on the streets tonight
Don't try to stop me I've lost control
My heart beats through my soul
Spend my time making waves
Spinning out against the grain
Teachers breathing down my neck
Teachers always on my back - Jack

Don't cross me now
Don't make me mad
I'll wreck your day
And all your plans

I can't stop the fire
Blaze a trail of glory
I can't stop the fire
Don't get in my way today
I can't stop the fire
Blaze a trail of glory
I can't stop the fire
Can't stop the fire in me

I will bent
Your golden rules
Feel you're full of lies
To stretch the truth
Born in a reckless breed
I've taken everything in need

Oh, I'm so hot to heat the sun
Some heads will roll
And my anger burning

I can't stop the fire
Blaze a trail of glory
I can't stop the fire
Don't get in my way today
I can't stop the fire
Blaze a trail of glory
I can't stop the fire
Can't stop the fire

I can't stop the fire
Blaze a trail of glory
I can't stop the fire
Don't get in my way today
