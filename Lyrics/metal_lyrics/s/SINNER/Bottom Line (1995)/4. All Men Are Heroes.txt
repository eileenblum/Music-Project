[Music: Mat Sinner, Tom Naumann - Lyrics: Mat Sinner]

Ready to escape from this world of lies
I'm leaving at midnight - my chance to survive
Gasolined to the limit, dressed in a killer suite
I'm swimming in a river of enthusiasm - I'll break the rules
Sunglasses stolen from the local store
The girls got magic, 
The boys on board
All men are heroes
All men are heroes
If dreams come alive
All men are heroes in dreams

Weird guys banned from dancing with pretty chicks
They took the flower out of my hair, so I let'em bleed
Heading for tomorrow, but will tomorrow ever come
They want to destroy my credibility, it's time to wake up
Vagabond in a dead end street
I will look this town and throw away the key

All men are heroes
All men are heroes
If dreams come alive
All men are heroes in dreams
All men are heroes in dreams

There was a gun, a bullet, a child
They learn her to beat, to hate, to kill
But they can't take away her dreams

Sunglasses stolen from the local store
The girls got magic
The boys on board
All men are heroes
All men are heroes
If dreams come alive
All men are heroes in dreams
