I'm watching you
I'm gonna set a fire burning
Gonna stay lonely
I'm not gonna play your fool

I got trouble all around me
The way to find you
Now you won't need to tell me the truth
Every night and day I will light up your way
The darkness came out of the blue

I'm locked and loaded
Gonna set my eyes on you
I'm locked and loaded
A prayer and a view

I pray to God
Nothing left for me to do
Living on sacred ground
The sound of distant thunder rules

Two souls are inside me
Fighting in me
Talking to the dead is so cruel
Every night and day there's a light on your way
The darkness will be hiding the truth

I'm locked and loaded
Through the burning desert sand
I'm locked and loaded
I'm a stranger in a strange land
