Help me Jesus, did I got too far
I never trust you, do you see my soars
Help me Jesus, I feel the deadly bite
Another night will hurt me, another strike

No beware, so who cares
No matter if you're scared
In the lark, how far
No matter if you dare
I'm reigning for the liberty of death

Say your prayer
I will include everyone in the dark of the night
I will save my son
Say your prayer
Keep your dream and the dream will follow
Let the battle begin

So beware, so who cares
No matter if you're scared
In the dark, how far
No matter if you dare
I'm reigning for the liberty of death

Help me Jesus
I saw the unknown
I'm standing alone
A fear will grow
