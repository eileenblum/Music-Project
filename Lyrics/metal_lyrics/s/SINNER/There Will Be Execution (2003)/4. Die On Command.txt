Hell and back where the shiver grows in the darkest place
One and on in this hidden world decieving on deface

Fire is over me
Look into another dimension
Fire is over me
I can't believe the tension

Do you see the burning hell
Die on command
Do you hear the final bell
Die on command, die

Doesn't matter what you see penetrate your feelings
Independence, democracy
You don't know with whom you're dealin'
