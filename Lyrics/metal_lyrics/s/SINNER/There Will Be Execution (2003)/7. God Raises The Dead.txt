It is the moment of creation
A different level of incarnation
The second pumping in my breast
At the end of our darkest quest
No matter how paranoid you are
You're moving through the soeme
It's so bizzare

God, God raises the dead
And if he needs my help he's calling
He's calling me

If you're dealing with the devil's dance
A prayer for me, one more chance
A silent weapon for a quiet war
Knocks us down, even to the core
