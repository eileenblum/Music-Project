Burnin' through this spitting flame
The heat is rising higher
Move away, you can't love me any good
Ten thousand miles behind me, well it would

Shooting from the stars
How much longer will it take

Blood on the horizon
Death howls in the wind
They called him atomizer
He's the finalizer

Screaming, the world is in disgrace
How many times they try to break him
I'm ready, ready to explode
I will set him to acclaim
