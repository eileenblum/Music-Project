Does it really matter when it feels so good
I don't really wanna walk away
But I don't want to walk through the fire again
And if it hurts I call it a day

I'm gonna give all if you catch my fall
In time and space, nothing at all

I throw away my crown of thorns
If you call my name I'll be there
I throw away my crown of thorns

If I hear your voice, I couldn't regret
There's something different about you
Now and forever, you always will be there
But I can't let you go forever

Still we run, my pride is gone
I'm standing alone and I bleed
