When you're feeling wrong
You think your heart is gone
The sound of your voice is changing the rhymes

How does it feel to you when you don't know the truth
How does it feel as a liar?

Don't you think the time has come?
Don't you think it's a long way to run?
There is just one evolution
There will be execution

Can you look in my eyes
Can you listen to me
Just one step beyond and you can't reach the line

When it's said and done
Now my time has come
I wouldn't say anything bad anymore
