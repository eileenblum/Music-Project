Nobody feels my lunacy
Nobody feels my evil dreams
Making me see what you believe
A stranger's calling, hear the howling
It's hard to conceive

I'm all across the blinded nation
I'm in the middle of salvation

Thou does frighten me in dreams
Deep inside I'm burning
Thou does frighten me in dreams
A dead history's my past
Thou does frighten me in dreams
Terrifies my visions
Thou does frighten me in dreams
This unbound massive energy can heal

Can't explain the other side
I see it with my eyes
Strangled and bound my blood runs cold
Will this be forever, a heart of stone
