She hurts me deadly and I'm gonna pay the price
My neck screams back in pain
And it really doesn't matter that she's starting to play games
Well I'm just playing the game

It's a mind game going on
So innocent
And gone is her desire
The final human silence
A her higher level of violence

Eye to eye, we see we entertained the truth
But there are no more reasons
Well her heart left me a long long time ago
She enjoys my bleeding feelings
