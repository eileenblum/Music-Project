Out in the fight
How does it hurt inside
Alone in this world
Only a shadow arise

My time will come and I can't turn back
Till we see a sign
Every day is a new day
I will come back out of the black

Where the river flows, will you be my soul
And I can't get it over you
Where the river flows, where my heart belongs
And the water will still go through

The sun's on my face
Into another world
I left all behind
Just give me another try

There's nothing changin'
No regrets of how long it will last
There's nothing more to say or do
Walking alone through the past
