[Mat Sinner / Henny Wolter]

To my sweet surprise
You just said nothing
It feels like a ritual
To make believe

The words keep falling
From your mouth
Yes, I know it's hard
Not to cross the line
Reach out and scream

We take it as it's natural
Situation is horrible
The more we wait
There's less belief
In sweet salvation

Until it hurts you see
Until it hurts I'll be the one
You say that you can't take no more
It just keeps getting worse
I count the words
Until it hurts

Until it hurts you see
Until it hurts I'll be the one
You say that you can't take no more
It just keeps getting worse
I count the words
Until it hurts
