[Mat Sinner / Henny Wolter]

Watch me go

Under fire
Got no break
There's just so much that I can take
Hands in pocket
Clench my fist
Just one hit I never missed

To cure my desire
And heal my disgrace
Put fuel in the fire
Fist to face - fist to face

Out all night
I'm on a roll
Loaded and ready to explode
Won't stop running
Can't cool down
You know came to track you down

To cure my desire
And heal my disgrace
Put fuel in the fire
Fist to face - fist to face
Fist to face - fist to face
Look out

I gave it all
Just for the take
Got no more promises left to break
Souls for sale
Money to burn
I wonder if I'll ever learn

To cure my desire
And heal my disgrace
Put fuel in the fire
Fist to face - fist to face
Fist to face
Fist to face
Fist to face
