[Mat Sinner / Igor Gianola]

Take me where the shiver grows
I see the destination where the holy water flows
A fatal situation and the sun will never shine
I put my life for you out on the line

Lightning strikes twice and children cry
Fallen from the sky to say goodbye

Next your heart will burn
At each and every turn
And you live and better learn
It's crash &amp; burn

I am at the point of no return
I dive into the river where the holy water burns
My heart is bleeding now, I've got to find a way
I'm dealing with the Devil until the end of the day

Lightning strikes twice and children cry
Fallen from the sky to say goodbye

Next your heart will burn
At each and every turn
And you live and better learn
It's crash &amp; burn
As radiation hurts
Survive the red alert
And you live and better learn
It's crash &amp; burn

Next your heart will burn
At each and every turn
And you live and better learn
It's crash &amp; burn
As radiation hurts
Survive the red alert
And you live and better learn
It's crash &amp; burn
It's crash &amp; burn
Crash &amp; burn
