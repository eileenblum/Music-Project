[Mat Sinner / Henny Wolter]

I've never been the one to stay out of a fight
And if you think you're so tough and rough
Why don't you see me tonight
You know there's good and bad inside
And it always fights
I got little to lose, so back off
For the dog that bites

I'm the one that bites the hand that feeds
The dog that bit the master
And I told it ain't much it needs
To blow my fuse
The dog that bit the master
I'm the one that bites
The hand that feeds
The dog that bit
I ain't the one that's looking for trouble
Trouble's looking for me

So you think you're the one
Who's gonna tame me down
C'mon and give it a shit, girl
I'm gonna make you lose that frown
I give you one last chance to see
This leash ain't big enough for me
It doesn't take much if you wanna try
It's a slip of the lip and the wink of an eye

I'm the one that bites the hand that feeds
The dog that bit the master
And I told it ain't much it needs
To blow my fuse
The dog that bit the master
I'm the one that bites
The hand that feeds
The dog that bit
I ain't the one that's looking for trouble
Trouble's looking for me

Don't ever think you're safe now
As you turn me down
I'm up the back of your neck
And I break it as you turn around
You see it's tooth for tooth to me
And everybody else
Don't need the crack of the whip
Slip of the lip
I've come to take you down
...So watch out

I'm the one that bites the hand that feeds
The dog that bit the master
And I told it ain't much it needs
To blow my fuse
The dog that bit the master
I'm the one that bites
The hand that feeds
The dog that bit
I ain't the one that's looking for trouble
Trouble's looking for me
