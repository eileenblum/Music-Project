[Mat Sinner / Henny Wolter / Tom Naumann]

I couldn't handle the deal with the Devil
You're on the outside looking in
I drove the highway like a rebel
On the gateway to sin

Like a rock, I never give up
But I will be hunting you again
Like a rock, I never give up
You will spot my face insane

I will rock your devil's playground
What I like, what I hate, what I love
I will use you as my background
I'm your nightmare indeed

I just signed the contract in blood
I travelled the road to nowhere
Sailed the seven seas and the flood
And now I'm after you

Like a rock, I never give up
But I will be hunting you again
Like a rock, I never give up
You will spot my face insane

I will rock your devil's playground
What I like, what I hate, what I love
I will use you as my background
I'm your nightmare, baby
Nightmare, baby

Like a rock, I never give up
But I will be hunting you again
Like a rock, I never give up
You will spot my face insane

I will rock your devil's playground
What I like, what I hate, what I love
I will use you as my background
I'm your nightmare, baby
Nightmare, baby, indeed
