[Mat Sinner / Henny Wolter]

I can't resist her as she took the scene
She threw her head up like a mean machine
She was turning vicious in overdrive
She smelled like sugar and everybody dives
A rebellion - credibility
The place was red hot and she's the key
Her fascination shines like gold
She was the opposite of cold

A revolution
When love is back in the jailhouse
A revolution
And I'm playing the game in this madhouse

She's playing hard with the heavy stuff
The lightning strikes, she was acting tough
I tried to rock and take command
Looking through my polished glasses
I took a drink, she was shaking the air
I was sitting down in this empty chair
She was looking at me cold as ice
I gave her a smile as the clock strikes

A revolution
When love is back in the jailhouse
A revolution
And I'm playing the game in this madhouse
A revolution
When love is back in the jailhouse
Well, tonight this place is gonna explode
She means real double trouble
A revolution

I can't resist her as she took the scene
She threw her head up like a mean machine
She was turning vicious in overdrive
She smelled like sugar

A revolution
When love is back in the jailhouse
A revolution
And I'm playing the game in this madhouse
A revolution
When love is back in the jailhouse
Tonight this place is gonna explode
She means real double trouble
A revolution
