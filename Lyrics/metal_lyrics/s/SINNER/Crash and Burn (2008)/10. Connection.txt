[Mat Sinner / Henny Wolter]

Shook my heart
And broke my stride
Times I thought
I'd never get it right
She told me it's alright, my love
To sooth my heart
And ease my soul
Tonight I feel I'm gonna let it roll
Thoughts of love
And words of gold I know

See my connection
Ain't looking for perfection
Give my heart and soul
To her heart and soul collection
See my connection
Give in to her inspection
To soothe my shook up heart
It's a devious affection

You know some people
Wind up in a fight
Some people always
Make believe they're right
You know I'm not that type
My love, sweet love
I can't hold on like this no more
It's time I feel I'm letting go
Oh sister, save my soul for love

See my connection
Ain't looking for perfection
Give my heart and soul
To her heart and soul collection
See my connection
Give in to her inspection
To soothe my shook up heart
It's a devious affection

And if I'm broke and there's no hope
I know she's there, just she can cope
And if I feel the world will stop
Give me a hand and put me up
Yes, she'll put me up

See my connection
Ain't looking for perfection
Give my heart and soul
To her heart and soul collection
See my connection
Give in to her inspection
To soothe my shook up heart
It's a devious affection

See my connection
Ain't looking for perfection
Give my heart and soul
To her heart and soul collection
See my connection
Give in to her inspection
To soothe my shook up heart
It's a devious affection
