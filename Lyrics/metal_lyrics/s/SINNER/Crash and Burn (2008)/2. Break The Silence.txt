[Mat Sinner / Igor Gianola]

Locked up down in a hole
Rats came to parole
Black the darkest night
I was ready to fight
The time I hit the ground
But no one will ever break me down

Even it's a mistake
We'll never break
There's no difference
What it takes
I will break the silence

A rebel has fallen down
A king has lost his crown
And we both ride the wind
In total discipline

Even it's a mistake
We'll never break
There's no difference
What it takes
I will break the silence

In the darkest night
You will be my fight
And I'm tonight
I'm hunting the moonlight
I will break the silence

Even it's a mistake
We'll never break
There's no difference
What it takes
I will break the silence

In the darkest night
You will be my fight
And I'm tonight
I'm hunting the moonlight
I will break the silence
