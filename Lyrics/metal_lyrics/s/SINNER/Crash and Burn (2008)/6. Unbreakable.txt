[Mat Sinner / Igor Gianola]

As the sun came up again
Blood on the floor
They call it cool
A renegade who lost his home
At the end of his lonely roam

Nobody cares, nobody cries
I saw the look in his dying eyes
The left hand raised to heaven
And I heard a silent scream

A wild child screaming for more
A cool kid lost control
Another victim of circumstance
Without warning

He was just unbreakable
His battlefield unshakable
He was just invincible
He was the one they called unbreakable

Just one more day in this foreign land
Just one more night in misunderstand
He missed the last train home again
And just asked for a chance

It was close to the morning light
A shotgun strikes and cuts the night
The silence turns into a screaming rage
You could hear it, touch it and feel it

A wild child screaming for more
A cool kid lost control
Another victim of circumstance
Without warning

He was just unbreakable
His battlefield unshakable
He was just invincible
He was the one they called unbreakable

He was just unbreakable
His battlefield unshakable
He was just invincible
He was the one they called unbreakable
He was just unbreakable
His battlefield unshakable
He was just invincible
He was the one they called unbreakable
Unbreakable
