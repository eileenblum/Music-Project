[Mat Sinner / Magnus Karlsson]

I know she's trouble
She means heartbreak
A demon works inside my soul
Do you hear the white wolf howls
His songs from the hills

I still feel the green fields talking
Still see your smile in my dreams
How we're strutting down through grafton
When you were with me

I disappeared without a trace
No time, no last embrace
I spread my wings
A king lost his crown

I just see your face
When will I meet you again
When the sun goes down
Where all the warning's unheard
My heart of darkness

I've lost my way in deepest sadness
Sometimes Heaven, my soul's in Hell
No rescue for a bleeding heart
Well, I'm walking through flames

I've disappeared without a trace
No time, no last embrace
I spread my wings
A king lost his crown

I just see your face
When will I meet you again
When the sun goes down
Where all the warning's unheard
In my heart of darkness

I've disappeared without a trace
No time, no last embrace
I spread my wings
A king lost his crown

I just see your face
When will I meet you again
When the sun goes down
Where all the warning's unheard
In my heart of darkness
