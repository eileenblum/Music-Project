Brother do you hear me
I'm under attack
Lost here in this hole
Catch 22 and no way back

Brother do you hear me
All my life been paved with lies
My restless soul can't find no peace
With pretended alibis

There's blood on a sand
There's anger in my heart
With a gun in my hand
I face the truth

There's blood on a sand
I will deal the cards
When the tables are turned
I'm after you

Brother here's my last call
To quit this dirty show
You cheated and mistreated me
And my friend became my foe

You took away my most beloved
All I ever had
It's time to pay on judgment day
There's war of love instead
