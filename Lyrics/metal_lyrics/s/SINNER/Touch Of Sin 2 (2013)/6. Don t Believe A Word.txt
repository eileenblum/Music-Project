[originally by Thin Lizzy]Don't believe me if I tell you
Not a word of this is true
Don't believe me if I tell you
Especially if I'm telling you that I'm in love with you

Don't believe me if I tell you
That I wrote this song for you
'Cause there might be some other silly pretty girl
I'm singing it to

Don't believe a word

Don't believe a word
'Cause words are so easily spoken
And your heart is like that promise
Made to be broken

Don't believe anything
That I say to you
'Cause there might be some other pretty girl
I'm singing to

Don't believe a word
'Cause words are so easily spoken
Don't believe a word
'Cause your heart is like that promise
Made to be broken

Don't believe me if I tell you
Not a word of this is true
Don't believe me if I tell you
Especially if I'm telling you
That I'm in love with you

Don't believe me if I tell you
That I wrote this song for you
'Cause there might be some other silly pretty girl
I'm singing it to
So don't believe a word

Don't believe a word
'Cause words are so easily spoken
Don't believe a word
And your heart's like that promise
Made to be broken

Don't believe anything
That I say to you
'Cause there might be some other pretty girl
I'm singing to

Don't believe a word
'Cause words are so easily spoken
Don't believe a word
'Cause your heart's like that promise
Made to be broken

Don't believe a word
'Cause these words can only tell lies
And these lies are coming to you, baby
With these tears in your eyes

[Solo]

Don't believe a word
'Cause words are so easily spoken
Don't believe a word
And your heart is like that promise
Made to be broken

Don't believe anything
That I say to you
'Cause there might be some other pretty girl
I'm singing to

Don't believe a word
'Cause words are so easily spoken
Don't believe a word
'Cause your heart's like that promise
Made to be broken

Don't believe a word
Not a word of this is true
Don't believe me if I tell you
Especially if I'm telling you
That I'm in love with you

Don't believe a
No, don't ya
Don't believe a word
