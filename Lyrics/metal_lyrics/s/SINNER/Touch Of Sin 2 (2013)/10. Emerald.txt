She rolled into town like a noise nobody knows
A green light was makin' me blind, her two flashing eyes
No one was there who was as nervous as me
My vision came true, a cry my blood runs cold

Don't mess around
Don't mess around
She's got the emerald of sin and she's playing to win

I will pay the price with that lady by my side
And I will choose the unknown way
At the edge of night I will look into her eyes
And lay my body in the shades

I forget the secret legend, my future looks black
I've stolen the stone of the sage and started the heart attack
That woman is a killer she said she's innocent
I ruled her with a dirty grim, the emerald
