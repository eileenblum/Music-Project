No way out, tonight's the night
'Cause baby was born with the beat
Born to run and born to rock
Don't hope for amnesty

Don't be nervous and take it cool
I'll rock the chains of the night
I'll heat up your blood 'til it's boiling hot
Don't hope for amnesty

Mom says: "No, no, no -
It's a dangerous game"
Mom says: "No, no, no"

Born to rock you, born to roll you
Born to rock you, born to roll you

Let's groove and stomp with our feet
Forget the problems we have
Shake your heads and move your bones
Don't hope for amnesty

No way out tonight's the night
We're born with the beat
Raise your hands for rock 'n' roll
Don't hope for amnesty
