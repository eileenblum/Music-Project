Who's that girl running down the street
She's wild, wild, wild
Who's that girl can she rescue me and rock me

I set my sights on her
Another sleepless night

Bad, bad girl
I'll bet you get a broken heart
Bad, bad girl
That lady makes you scream
Bad, bad girl
I'll bet you get a broken heart
Bad, bad girl

She's the ruler of the night
She's wild, wild, wild
Dressed in leather, dressed in black - rock me

She takes it to the maximum
She's wild, wild, wild
When she makes the scene the light night strikes and rock me
