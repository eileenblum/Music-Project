In the cold and nasty city
Where men are fighting to survive
People kill without a cause
In the backstreets of the night

Nobody cares if you live or die
Out in the wilds

Don't turn around - in the concrete jungle
Don't turn around - boy you'll be in big trouble

There's a calm before the storm
But there's danger everywhere
Look to the left and to the right
You're a target to the enemy
