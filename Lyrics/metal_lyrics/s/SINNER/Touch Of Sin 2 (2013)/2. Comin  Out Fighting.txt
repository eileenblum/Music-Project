Down at the corner
We are spending our time
Takin' anything that's going
We get out of the line

On the run with the boys
Lust and greed in their eyes
And the people said:
"They live a dangerous life"
You better face it start rockin' the streets

Run - comin' out fighting and believe in rock 'n' roll
Run - comin' out fighting - charge our dynamo

In the backstreet bars
At the edge of the town
I'll show you something strange
Where heavy metal goes down

Thrills in the night
Far from the light
What goes on behind closed doors
Is called the fever of the night
You better face it start rockin' the streets
