Down in the old castle out in the swamps
Darkness drops all over the land
The clock strikes twelve
The midnight masked-ball is about to begin

Masquerade
Living in a masquerade

In the middle of all these people
I couldn't believe what I saw
Cat's eyes behind a silver mask
She was the one I was searching for

With her eyes flashing she runs away
A stranger grabs me
He screams "Just wait and see"
But I found the girl, ripped off her silver mask
