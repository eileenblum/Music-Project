The phone rings in the afternoon
And I feel the coming of bad news
You're a knife in my heart and made it bleed
It cuts so deep

You sold me your angel's smile
You promised me heaven
But you played a game
You looked at me with those innocent eyes
Were you tellin' me lies

I'm walking down the lonely streets at night
A broken heart, a broken dream
Yes, I'm a fool but I'm still loving you

Knife in my heart
And it hurts so bad
Knife in my heart
Leaving scars forever

In a world where love is lost
Returns the once in a lifetime feeling again
I'm not the kind of man
Who hides his feelings for you

I strolled down streets with a six-pack in my hands
There's still the hunger deep inside me
You need me and
Nothing in the world could change it
