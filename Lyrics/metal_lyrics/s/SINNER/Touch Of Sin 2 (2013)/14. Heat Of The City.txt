It might be more
Let's tame a hurricane
Wanna hold you in my arms forever
In the night

I will never leave you stranded
Even when you hurt my jealous heart

Just a look - a touch
Some hot romancing
When I saw her grooving
I saw her dancing

Heat of the City
Let's celebrate the night
Heat of the City

You better throw away your problems
There's only one reason
To celebrate the night

Mercury rises to the red
I don't live for ignorance
I want you, I want you

Heat of the City
Let's celebrate the night
Heat of the City
Out in the neon lights
