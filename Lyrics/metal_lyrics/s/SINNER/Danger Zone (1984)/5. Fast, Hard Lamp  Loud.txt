[Sinner]

I'm on the hunt in an ol' speak easy
Dust and smoke ... are hiding my face
I'm gonna break her heart again
She can't keep me inside of a cage
I'm sending out an S. O. S.
And her body was all in a rage

Ooh, she's an angel of pain
Ooh, she made music in my brain

Fast, hard, loud [2]
Fast, hard, obscene

I'm a victim of temptation
I can't deny when I look into her eyes
I ate her apple, gave her my snake
Smelled her sweet perfume
The fall of Eden

Ooh, she's an angel of pain
Ooh, she made music in my brain

Fast, hard, loud [2]
Fast, hard, I'm stratin' to shake

Fast, hard, loud [4]
