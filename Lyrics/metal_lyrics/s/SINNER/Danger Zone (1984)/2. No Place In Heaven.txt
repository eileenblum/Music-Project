[Sinner]

Ow!

Good girls, whippin' to the music
Freaky girls, listen to me
Bad girls are here for the rockers
Bad guys ... feel the heat

No place ... is free tonight in heaven
No chance to die, there's no need
There's only drums, bass and guitars
I'm gonna rip your spine out indeed

[Spoken:]
Rock on

We're gonna rock on - hard
Rock on
Yeah
We're gonna rock on - hard
Rock on
We're gonna take you down
'Cause there's no place in heaven

Sinners ... shakin' to the groove
Sexy ladies ... young and smooth
The devil's in leather, he's lookin' mean
It's gettin' hotter than hell indeed

We're gonna rock on - hard
Rock on
We're gonna rock on - hard
Rock on

Hard!
