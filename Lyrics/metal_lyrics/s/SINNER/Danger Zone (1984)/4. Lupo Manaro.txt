[Sinner]

Creepin' round and lean from the woods
Italian word he was lupo manaro
And every month on a certain night
He went through changes

The full moon rises, he's gettin' nervous
Tension is growin', he's gettin' vicious

It's no wonder with hair growing everywhere
The acts of insanity
It's no delusion, no halluciation...
And adventure

Pressure is rising, he's in need of satisfaction
He walks through purgatory to run with the devil

[Chorus:]
It's in his zodiac
He is a maniac
A crying bull, a lupo manaro
It's in his zodiac
He is a maniac
A wild beast, a lupo manaro

The next day when he wakes up
And blood is on his face
He don't remember where he's been
But he's seen the bloody trace

And next month, there comes a day
The full moon rises, he's gettin' nervous again

[Chorus]
