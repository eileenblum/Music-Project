[Stoner, Sinner]

The shiver

Midnight in a dirty ghost town
The winds howl in my face
A silent scream to hide is useless
The hand of hell will touch the land

A cool empty silence within some violence - in the dark
I heard a whisper, a roar at the gate
Oh, it's too late

[Chorus:]
Into the dark [2]
Hell is in heaven
The shiver will rise
Into the dark [2]
Hell is in heaven
The shiver

The shiver

[Chorus]

I remember it's not a dream - to take a holy soul
Eyes flashing in the moonlight
There's no choice
It smells like ol' mould

[Chorus]

The shiver [2]
