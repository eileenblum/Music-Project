[Sinner, Shirley]

Face to face ... with evil eyes
He's got a gun, he's got the might
He's called the idol of the youth
The fear of the old
A lone wolf with my sympathy alone in the cold

He lives his life he was reckless
Hardened by his life, he sees through lies
He lives his life, he was reckless
At the scene of a crime

[Chorus 1:]
Trashed by the night, run for your life
The scene of a crime
Trashed by the night, run for your life
The scene of a crime

The outlaw was breathless
He destroyed the deceit
But he went two steps too far
The state was in riot
Politicians keep ... their smiling faces

[Chorus 2:]
Not one line, not one word in the news
Sacrificed by the law
He was living his stolen life...
That left him bloody and raw

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2 &amp; 1]
[Chorus 1]

Trashed by the night
The scene ... of a crime
