[Sinner]

Yeah yeah!

Outside the wild winds callin' me
Dancin' on thunder, walkin' through pourin' rain
Magic ways

[Chorus 1:]
I'm takin' it easy, takin' it slow
Holdin' my glass of whiskey like a crystal ball...
With my back to the wall

The north wind will blow - to the death of the night
Gangs of the night - prepared ... for the fight

Hints of the ladies with evil thoughts
I heard them say he's tellin' secret lies
But sweet and fine

Come try runnin' on my back and my neck
Lonely is the day, nut lonelier the night
Oh the night

[Chorus 2:]
The north wind will blow - to the death of the night
Gangs of the night - prepared ... for the fight
The edge of the darkness - a nightmare of life
It was no place to hide - and the fever did rise

Outside the wild winds callin' me
Dancin' on thunder, walkin' through showers of hail
Again and again

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

Wild winds were callin' me [3]
