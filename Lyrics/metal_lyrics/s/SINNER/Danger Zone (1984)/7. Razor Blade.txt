[Sinner]

I'm ready - if you need me
I'll crawl out the jungle
I'm ready - oh it may seem mean
A mystery, hungry eyes
Uh!

I'm ready - with passion and emotion
At witch house
I'm ready - a rush is over
Devil smiles, voodoo arise

[Chorus:]
Sharper than the knife
Rounder than the edge of a razor blade
Sharper than the knife
Flashin' in the night

Razor blade [2]

I'm ready - The danger lurks everywhere
Run through the jungle
I'm ready - If you need me
No chance to hide ... the obsession

[Chorus]

Razor blade [2]

With these eyes still alive
Grow into ecstasy
Living in a trance so wild
There's no escape from here

I'm ready - To leave the black cave
All or nothing
I'm ready - To break into daylight
Ready ... to explode

[Chorus]

Razor blade [3]
