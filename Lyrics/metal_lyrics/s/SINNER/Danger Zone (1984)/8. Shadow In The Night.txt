[Sinner]

Left out in the cold I wandered the land of lonely souls
I was ... brought up by the bitch of Babylon
But be that as it may, I'm the rulebreaker
The thrill is gone and damned have won

[Chorus 1:]
Like a stranger
A prisoner in white
Like a stranger
Look out!

[Chorus 2:]
Shadow in the night [2]
In the night
Shadow in the night
Ow!

The light of the bad days ... will take the shiver off my shoulders
I'm lookin' out for my piece of mind
I'm runnin' every night with one foot in my own grave
Through the street of Babylon

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

Shadow in the night
In the night
Shadow in the night
In the night
Shadow in the night
In the night
Shadow in the night
In the night
Shadow in the night
