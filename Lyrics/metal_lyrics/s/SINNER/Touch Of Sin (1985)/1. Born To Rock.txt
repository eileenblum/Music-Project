[Sinner]

Born to rock [3]

Ooh, yeah

Ooh yeah
Ow!

No way out, tonight's the night
'Cause baby was born with the beat
Born to run ... and born to rock
Don't hope for amnesty

Hoah!

Don't be nervous ... take it cool
I'll rock the chains of the night
I'll heat up your blood ... 'til it's boiling hot
Don't hope for amnesty

[Chorus 1:]
Mom says: "No no no
It is a dangerous game"
Mom says: "No no no"

[Chorus 2:]
Born to rock you, born to roll you [2]

Let's groove ... and stomp with our feet
Forget the problems we have
Shake your heads ... and move your bones
Don't hope for amnesty

Wow!

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

[Spoken:]
No way out ... tonight's the night
We're born with the beat
Raise your hands for rock'n'roll
Don't hope for amnesty

[Chorus 2]

We were born

[Chorus 2]

Wo were born to rock
