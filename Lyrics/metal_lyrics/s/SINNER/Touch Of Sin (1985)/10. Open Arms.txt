[Sinner]

I'm cruisin' til midnight
I'm runnin' through the loneliness my way
Nobody's here by my side
When I need 'em ... on these cold days

Since you left me...
There are sorrows in me
Oh I can't forget you

Remembering that love...
I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
Searchin' for a promise
I believe in paradise and search for a way

I feel desire ... and I love you
Got no illusions
You know what I mean

[Chorus:]
Open arms are waiting just to hold you
Open arms are ready - for your touch
Open arms are waiting and they need you
Wanna squeeze you in my - open arms

I smell your perfume
If you ain't here at all it is a mystery
My mind is in trouble
You won't believe it's insanity

I'm crusin' from midnight until daylight
I run through the streets
Rain turns to tears

[Chorus]

Open arms [2]

Yeah yeah yeah

Open arms
