[Sinner]

Hot ... and I'm hotter
Runnin' on the razor's edge, a disaster
Hot, get ready
We gotta rock until we drop

Out in the streets, people live in fear
We see it in their eyes

[Chorus:]
We're out, out of control
Rockin' to hell
And heaven's on fire
We're out, out of control
Rockin' to hell
We're out of control - Hey!

The earth is breakin' up
Showin' his head, the beast spits fire
He's too hot to handle
His ears are sharp as the horns of a bull

He's rising up from hell and above the roar
He seems to smile at me

[Chorus]

We're out - Out of control
We're out - out, out
We're out - We're out of control
Hey!

We're out - Out of control

We jump on down through the gates of hell
The big deciever has a lot to sell
The virgin women, the drugs and gold
He don't want our music ... but he wants our souls

You know there's no escape from here
The devil's dancin' and screamin'

[Chorus]

We're out - Out of control [2]
We're out - Out, out
We're out - Out of control

We're out - Out of control
Rockin' to hell ... and heaven's on fire
We're out - Out of control
We're out - Out, out
We're out - Ow! [2]
We're out - Out of control
We're out
