[Sinner]

We're always on the run ... far away from home
And the time has come ... to think it over
We're goin' through lies ... and we realize
There's no easy way

A woman like you ... waits for a man like me
I drink to you
A wineglass in my hand, I try to stand...
Against the wind

Memories
I have your picture on my wall
The weather changes ... into an angry call

[Chorus:]
The storm broke loose
A legend never dies
The storm broke loose
A legend never dies
The storm broke loose

The cold city streets ... are under my feet
I can't turn back
The stage lights come up
Don't let this moment ... pass too fast

I see your face ... on the cover of a magazine
The weather changes ... into an angry call

[Chorus]

Ooh, memories
I have your face deep in my heart
The weather changes ... into an angry call

[Chorus]

A legend never dies
The storm broke loose
A legend never dies
And the storm ... broke ... loose
