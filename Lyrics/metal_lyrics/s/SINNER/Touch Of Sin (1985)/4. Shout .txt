[Sinner]

Whoah!

Lookin' for action ... in the middle of the night
Lookin' out for some thrills, we're out for a hot time
Living just for tomorrow - Tonight's the night
The next drink is the best one, it's time to fly

[Chorus 1:]
We arrive with the sunset
The women look razor sharp
Mothers lock up their daughters
When they see us after dark

[Chorus 2:]
Shout! [2]
If you can't stand the heat
We turn it up loud

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 2 (2)]

We're no fools for girls ... and we have money
There are enough hot chicks ... who wanna taste our honey
Sweet rockin' music ... for hungry girls and boys
Women and whiskey are just our toys, our joys

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]
[Chorus 2]

Shout! [5]
