[Sinner]

With my claws and a silver dagger
Enough is enough, it's now or never
Face to face with dynamite
I'm set to explode ... in the heat of the night

[Chorus 1:]
Tear down the thunder of doom
Don't take that boat to the shore of evil
I hold my candle high ... in the night

[Chorus 2:]
Run with the wind - From the hand of fate
Run with the wind - But the hand of fate will catch you
Run with the wind - From the hand of fate
Hand of fate

Ow!

Another long and sleepless night
I'm gonna make it through all right
I've gotta go - run with the wind
Reach for the crown if you wanna be king

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

Run with the wind [3]
