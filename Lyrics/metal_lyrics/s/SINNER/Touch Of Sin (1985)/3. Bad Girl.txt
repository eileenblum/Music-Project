[Sinner]

Who's that girl running down the street
She's wild, wild, wild
Who's that girl can she rescue me and rock me

I set my sights on her
Another sleepless night

[Chorus:]
Bad, bad, bad girl
I'll bet you get a broken heart
A bad, bad, bad girl
That lady makes you scream
Bad, bad, bad girl
I'll bet you get a broken heart
A bad, bad, bad girl

She's the beggar of the night
She's wild, wild, wild
Dressed in leather, dressed in black
Rock me

I set my sights on her
Another sleepless night

[Chorus]

Ow!

She takes it to the maximum
She's wild, wild, wild
When she makes the scene the lightnight strikes
Rock me

I set the sights on her
Another sleepless night
