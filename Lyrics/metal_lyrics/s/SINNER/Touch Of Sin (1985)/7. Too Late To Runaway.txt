[Sinner]

Yeah, ow!

Into the danger of a long black night
We're comin' home ... back to rock-city
Shadows pulling faces surrounded by light
When me and the boys ... hit the streets

[Chorus 1:]
It was our time and we couldn't die
We take it up to the limit
So rough and tough
With power and dreams through hot and cold
Hot and cold

[Chorus 2:]
Too late to runaway
It's party all night long
Too late to runaway
Let me hear you scream "We will be strong"

[Chorus 3:]
We will be strong
Ha ha!

We're made of metal and power's guaranteed
We're moving heaven and earth
Comin' back home ... into the rock-city
We change your ice into a fire

[Chorus 1, 2 &amp; 3]

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

Too late to runaway
Let me hear you scream "We will be strong"

[Chorus 3]
