[Sinner, Naumann, Beyrodt]

Breathe fire - I'm knee deep in your lies
Where's the guy above - he's my alibi
No sign, no helping hand as the going gets tough
I lost all my faith, all hope in mercy from above

I saw the pope kissing concrete
A mile away a hundred children bleed

White lightning - stop frightening
Give me a deep breath of life
White lightning - I'm gonna play it my way
And it's so dark inside

Where's the lord - who let all these children die
The church pretends the mess we're in
Back in the real world
Where weird things affect our life
Look into the future unholy visions will rise

They showed me Jesus wearing a cross
Next a bad child, bone cancer she's lost

A white lightning
A white lightning
