[Sinner, Naumann, Beyrodt]

I used to know this beauty brown eyes girl
She was the hottest thing around the world
I met her at Billy's in my darkest hour
We had some beers, some tequilas
We were troublebound

The next pretty baby got long black hairs
She's got legs that will never end
I saw her dancing - I was down &amp; out
My breath was taken as she turned around

Anyway you want me - I'm doin' alright
Anyway you need me - I'm doin' fine
Anyway you want me - anyway you need me
Who's the girl with the blue tattoo

Me and Tammy were the biggest fools
We got things going, got the right tools
We were close to heaven, the next minute in hell
Lovin' every time of living, till the ice was melt

Anyway you want me - I'm doin' alright
Anyway you need me - I'm doin' fine
Anyway you want me - anyway you need me
Can you tell me who's the girl with the blue tattoo

Downtown was fighting, we're standing close
Danny was clean, forget her cocaine nose
In the middle of danger, we're playing rough
You were out tonight for some heavy stuff

Anyway you want me - I'm doin' alright
Anyway you need me - I'm doin' fine
Anyway you want me - anyway you need me
We're going down

Anyway you want me - I'm doin' alright
Anyway you need me - I'm doin' fine
Anyway you want me - anyway you need me
She's the girl with the blue tattoo
