[Sinner, Naumann, Beyrodt]

Twisted little daydream - a memory with pain
I'm looking through a hole in my wall
I want to dive with both of you
In the middle of this night
Trapped in reflections, you're in sight
I was paralyzed at first, before you realized
I'm walking through these red lights blue
Met your fascinating eyes
Where's no one who's to blame...
In the streets of sin

The first time when I saw you
I couldn't speak a word
All the meanest things surrounded me
To love somebody secretly
Can hurt so many times
It's heaven's jungle - I'm inside
I was paralyzed at first, before you realized
Torn away all jealousy
If you'll live your dark desire
Where's no one who's to blame...
In the streets of sin
The streets of sin
The streets of sin

It's game - you just can't win
In the streets of sin

Twisted little daydream - a memory with pain
I'm looking through a hole in my wall
I want to dive with both of you
In the middle of this night
Trapped in reflections, you're in sight
I was paralyzed at first, before you realized
Torn away all jealousy
If you'll live your dark desire
Where's no one who's to blame...
In the streets of sin
The streets of sin
The streets of sin

It's game - you just can't win
In the streets of sin

A pocket full of money - a long night to go
A felt so unsure inside
Is this the price, well I'm paying for
Or a paradise of lies
In the streets of sin
The streets of sin
The streets of sin

It's game - you just can't win
In the streets of sin

The streets of sin
The streets of sin
It's game - you just can't win
The streets of sin...
