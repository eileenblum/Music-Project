[Sinner, Naumann, Beyrodt]

A fool on the tightrope, the first step is pain
One moment not careful and your life was in vain
Remember the first time, remember the sin
Where're all the warnings blown in the wind

You roll the dice for your own paradise

Do you hear me - do you see me
We will meet on judgement day
Do you hear me - do you see me
We will meet on judgement day

Another cool skin - tight look
Another temptation
The thin line is calling you again
What will you do, will you bleed forever
The suicide way
You can't wash away mistakes
No healing - just pray

Remember the first time, remember the sin
Where're all the warnings blown in the wind

Judgement day
