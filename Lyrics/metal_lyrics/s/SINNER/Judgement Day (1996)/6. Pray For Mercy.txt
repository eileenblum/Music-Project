[Sinner, Naumann, Beyrodt]

Remember when you've said 'goodbye'
First I can die, then I would fight
There is no hope in every kind a dope
The same for your bottle of alcohol
You get down to this ground
You don't care what's worth believing
Now I don't mind

I'll turn you hot and sober
Till you will pray for mercy
There is just one thing
You go down, down, down

There is nothing left to lose
You can load my weapon, pull me through
And if you're looking for your dealer
Trust me babe, I'll play the healer
The sweet brown sugar took her
She didn't come back
Obsessed by taboos

Remember when you've said 'goodbye'
First I can die, then I would fight
There is no hope in every kind a dope
The same for your bottle of alcohol

If you're a true believer
There is no time for feelings
There is just one thing
You go down, down, down

Pray for mercy
Pray for mercy
You go down, down, down
