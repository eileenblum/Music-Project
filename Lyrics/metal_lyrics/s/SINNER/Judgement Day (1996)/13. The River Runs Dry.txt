[Sinner, Naumann, Beyrodt]

She used to be a girl, that you'll never leave
I don't pray for forgiveness
Her eyes make you believe
Poisoned deep inside by jealousy
No more memories will haunt me

What a fool I am - I light a candle
The gates of eden were closed
The magic has gone from her smile
No future was in her eyes
I had enough of bad news

In the midnight hour, I will stand all over now
No more hate - no more shadows of the past
A wall of silence surrounded every dream
And the fear of lost emotion
Turn a whisper to a scream

And the river runs dry
And we just take life for granted
Till the day that we'll die
Till the river runs dry
And I don't forget the moment
The last look in your eyes
The river runs dry

I still live here, she's still around
But I knew it before
When she walked out the door
But I never saw through

Through her river of tears
Just throw me down a sign from heaven

And the river runs dry
And we just take life for granted
Till the day that we'll die
Till the river runs dry
And I don't forget the moment
The last look in your eyes

And the river runs dry
And we just take life for granted
Till the day that we'll die
Till the river runs dry
And I don't forget the moment
The last look in your eyes
And the river runs dry
And we just take life for granted
Till the day that we'll die
Till the river runs dry
And I don't forget the moment
The last look in your eyes
