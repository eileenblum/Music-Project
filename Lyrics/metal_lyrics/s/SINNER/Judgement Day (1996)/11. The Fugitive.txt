[Sinner, Naumann, Beyrodt]

I realized the blue sky black
I felt the whole world's fading in my hands
I will meet you after dark
Ain't no sunshine in my heart
A quite deep river is running down
To the places we'd belong

Walk on in - I can't hear you calling, hear you
Walk on in - I can't hear you calling, hear you

I'm remembering your smile
So tell me what you think
Then I can break the ice
Before your roses fade away
Give me another chance to stay
When feeling show where we should go
It will never be in vain

Just for you I'll walk on water
Walk with you through the powering rain
Baby the darkness is getting closer
Hell I'm going insane

Seven sins and twenty dreams
You have to face reality
Let me heal your broken wing
Let's go our own way

Walk on in - I can't hear you calling, hear you
Walk on in - I can't hear you calling
