[Sinner, Naumann, Beyrodt]

The day the world's colliding
The sky's turning red
The same excuses as always
World's rotten in their hands
Vizualized destruction, there's no one to blame?
And what's the value for a human life
On a mission 'survival'
This is not the war between good and evil
It's time for pure instinct to save our soul

The school of hard knocks
One is up - one is down
And there's greed all around
And you're caught in
The school of hard knocks
One is up - one is down
And there's greed all around
And you're caught in
The school of hard knocks

They got the dollars in their hearts
It's not garbage they take
They got power in their hands
But what's the price they will pay
This is not the war between good and evil
It's time for pure instinct to save our soul

You won't believe my warnings
I can hear mother nature's calling
If wasteland's gettin' cold
Count to ten... and explode

One is up - one is down
And there's greed all around
And you're caught in
The school of hard knocks

The school of hard knocks
