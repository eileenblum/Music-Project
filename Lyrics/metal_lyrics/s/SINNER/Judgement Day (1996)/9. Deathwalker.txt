[Sinner, Naumann, Beyrodt]

I'm gonna push it hard the untouched mystery
On the highest level, ready for speed
Dark dimensions in the killing zone
A detonations cracking behind the wall
You gotta hold on, when illusion's gettin' real
You gotta hold on, no more limits

Thunder roars and siren sounds
I walk the darkness, hit the ground
Sink or swim, do or die
Sharper than a serpent's bite
You gotta hold on, when illusion's gettin' real
You gotta hold on, no more limits

You gotta go - deathwalker
You gotta go - deathwalker
You and me
You gotta go - deathwalker
You gotta go - deathwalker
You and me

Far too long your time has come
Look to the left, look to the right
And if you're ready to rumble
For a fight in the night
And when your time is over you're gonna die
You gotta hold on, when illusion's gettin' real
You gotta hold on, no more limits

Deathwalker, deathwalker
You gotta go
