[Sinner, Naumann, Beyrodt]

Sleepwalk in the sunrise, no signs - no boundaries
I hear a speculation, the world just won't believe

Don't try to run you can't win
Just push the button - fulfilled
Here and forever - no rules
Holy ground can't be cured

When you're out on the run, you're under the gun
You better get used to the truth
When you're out on the run - still on the loose
You better get used to
Used to the truth

Breathing under water
The truth just makes me sick
The next generation sold out and nature screams

When you're out on the run, you're under the gun
You better get used to the truth
When you're out on the run - still on the loose
You better get used to
Used to the truth

Our god's finest creation - sacrificed for deals
The kiss of death is in the air
No secret that can heal

When you're out on the run, you're under the gun
You better get used to the truth
When you're out on the run - still on the loose
You better get used to
Used to the truth

Used to the truth
Used to the truth
