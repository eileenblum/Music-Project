[Sinner, Naumann, Beyrodt]

Dreams come and go
Don't lose your self control
The prophets of doom
Don't leave us alone
Dreams come and go in black and white
The future is gold
Count on me if you're scared
Till the dam broke - walk the edge
The real world is gone but we stay

We jump the gun - the systems are falling
But we still jump the gun
Another world is dying - jump the gun

Believe it or not, things will happen here
In the name of god
Count on me if you're scared
Till the dam broke - walk the edge
The real world is gone but we stay

Give me one good reason
Only mind games can tear us apart
Count on me if you're scared
Till the dam broke - walk the edge
The real world is gone but we stay

We jump the gun - the systems are falling
But we still jump the gun
Another world is dying

Jump the gun
