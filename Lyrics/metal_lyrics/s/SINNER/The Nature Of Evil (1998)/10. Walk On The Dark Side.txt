[Sinner, Beyrodt]

You will fall
Eye to eye see the cross in the church and it hurts you
A child found dead, raped and abused
I will hear the words of a priest about god's will
But I'll never understand the reason for

The clock stop ticking
The memory unchanged

[Chorus 1:]
The hell waits
A look at the electric chair
Destiny, the edge of disaster
Here and now, let him go forever now
He will fall, a walk on the dark side

Death calls
Another father will shock the nation
His lawyer's words are turning into dust
The sunrise's so black and the mind is confused
His moves are driven by a loathing lust

[Chorus 2:]
The look of a mother
The rage of his brother

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2 &amp; 1]

The hell waits
He will fall
