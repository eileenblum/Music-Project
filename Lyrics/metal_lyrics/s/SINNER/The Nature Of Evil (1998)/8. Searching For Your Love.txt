[Sinner]

I'm trapped in your shadow
Do anything you want
We're alone
Your diamond eyes ... look so innocent
They're turning me to stone

[Chorus 1:]
Throw off these chains, they're holding me back
I'm crying in the rain again
There's a fire in me ... burning up again
There is no escape for me

[Chorus 2:]
Searching for your love [3]
The magic in your eyes
Searching for your love [3]
I'm hypnotized again

All I want is just to hold you, I can't take breath
At the edge of darkness ... we sailed over heartaches
One step into the night

A new day, a new night
But nothing's ever changing
I never thought that I'd be touching you
I'm in this much too deep

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

Yes, I'm searching for love
No no
