[Sinner, Naumann]

The world starts to shiver, my brain starts to shake
A resolution comes crashing ... from somewhere outta space
A voice in my head, a gun starts to fire
I see the world shakin' stirs, egomaniac desires

[Chorus 1:]
First I wonder their fears
Then I saw it real

[Chorus 2:]
Thunder crashes, lightning strikes
Do I dare or do I fight
Where's the wisdom, where's the truth
In faith and convinction

I raise my eyes, clouds burning black
Through a nuclear fire, the prophecy's back

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

The world starts to shiver, my brain starts to shake

[Chorus 1]

Yes, first I wonder their fears
Then I saw it real

[Chorus 2 (2)]

Faith and conviction
