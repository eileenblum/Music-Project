[Sinner, Naumann]

Every night...
I woke up on the dark side, tangled in lies
Chasing dreams, the night's getting colder
You're not in sight

[Chorus 1:]
I don't want you, I don't need you
I don't care for you
You want to hurt me, wanna see me bleeding
I'm still alive

[Chorus 2:]
One life, one chance
You live just for the moment
One life, one chance
Even if heaven falls ... I'm living with the justice from hell

I believe ... this message's from you
You call me king of fools
Justice is gone ... and justice is done
Accept my rules

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

I don't want you, I don't need you
I don't care for you
You want to hurt me, wanna see me bleeding
I'm...

One life, one chance
You live just for the moment
One life, one chance
Even if heaven falls...

[Chorus]

From hell
