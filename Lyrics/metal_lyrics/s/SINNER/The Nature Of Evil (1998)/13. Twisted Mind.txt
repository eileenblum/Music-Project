[Sinner, Beyrodt]
[Japanese bonus track]

It's the end of the road, I'm counting every minute
The tactics of law and a crime I've been done
Stranded in a dead end town
When the hammer of justice is crushing down

[Chorus:]
Nothing is real - when my twisted mind is broken
Defending the dream - when my twisted mind is broken

The argue for rights and caged me in a prison cell
Human understanding in a holy hell
I'm crucified my messiah wannabes
There're only dead or alive and I broke the secret seal

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

What's wrong or right - I will pay for my past life
Nothing is real - when my twisted mind is broken
Nothing is real
Oh yeah
