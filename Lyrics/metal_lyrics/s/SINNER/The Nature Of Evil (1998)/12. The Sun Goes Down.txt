[Phillip Lynott, Darren Wharton]
[from Thin Lizzy "Thunder And Lightning" (1983)]

There is a demon ... in all of us...
Whose soul ... belongs to hell
Sent here ... to redeem us
She knows that all too well

He comes and goes [2]
She knows it all to well
But when all is said and done
The sun goes down [4]

She tries her best ... to leave him
But she's still captured ... by his spell
She knows now ... she must decieve him
He knows it all too well

[Chorus:]
She comes and goes [2]
He knows it all too well
But when all is said and done
The sun goes down [4]

[Chorus]

The sun goes down
She tries her best to decieve him
The sun goes down [2]
