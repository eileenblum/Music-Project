[Sinner, Naumann]

I ... I've seen it all before
Heading north, the parole
I sit here and watch it all comes down
A mile away from hell
Back in a foreign land
But will tomorrow ever come

[Chorus 1:]
No regrets, no reason why
Release me, I'm dying

[Chorus 2:]
We stood side by side, everybody's asking why
We had a dream ... it ended in screams
They sold us ... a question of honour

A flash of a shotgun blast ... listens the dark
Dan dies in a pool of blood
A jet's coming close ... as gas hits my nose
All the prayers came too late

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

The chance has fallen but I'm still awake
My chances at zero (at zero, zero, zero...)
Breath for the last time, a help out of reach
No times for heroes (heroes, heroes...)

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]
[Chorus 2]
