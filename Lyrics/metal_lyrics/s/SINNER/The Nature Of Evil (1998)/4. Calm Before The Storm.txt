[Sinner]

My garden of eden is burning down in flames
I lost my immagination here in shadowland
There ain't no more sunshine, ain't no more smiles
My emotions are gone, only loneliness inside

[Chorus 1:]
I know that you've sold your own destiny
I know that I'll close the book of your dreams

[Chorus 2:]
I'm walking on fire
There's no more desire
And it was calm before the storm
I'm walking on fire
I didn't wanna hurt you ... anymore
It was calm before the storm

I took the train to destination unknown
My mind was black and my heart turns to stone
As the river stopped flowing I felt chaos in my head
So many ways to leave you, no time for regrets

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

I'm walking on fire
There's no more desire
And it was calm before the storm
I'm walking on fire
I didn't wanna hurt you ... anymore

[Chorus 2]
