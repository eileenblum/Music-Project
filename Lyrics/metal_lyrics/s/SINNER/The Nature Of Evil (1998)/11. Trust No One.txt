[Sinner]

I'm lost in life, out of this broken dream
No hope into future ... at the edge of insanity
Tonight ... nothing is what it seems
This scene replays
You're living with mortal fears

[Chorus 1:]
There are no sorrow for your desperately gain
Nothing left, all vengeance's in vain

[Chorus 2:]
Nothing left when I'm gone
We've been together for much too long
Call it pain ... and I'll never trust no one
Trust no one

Betrayed by yours
How could this happen here
We lied to each other ... in your final hour
Just survive
You noticed what went wrong
When all hell breaks lose ... you will find me gone

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

Nothing left when I'm gone
We've been together for much too long
Call it pain ... and I'll never trust no one

[Chorus 2]

Trust no one
