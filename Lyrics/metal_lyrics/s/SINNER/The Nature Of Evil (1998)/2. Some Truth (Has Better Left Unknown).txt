[Sinner]

Remember times we're acting wild
Our pulse was beating tight
We have an aim, we could believe
You exposed a brand new side
You're only live to criticize
I have to face reality

The innocence's gone
Your roses ... faded for too long

[Chorus 1:]
Some truth has better left unknown
Some dreams will never die
Two hearts will be facing the truth
Beating to survive
A secret to keep [2]

The single touch was like a spark
And it opened up my heart...
That there are some other ways
I have to leave this twisted road...
For reasons better left untold
As the naked truth comes walking in

Well, my soul is caged
Sweet devil behind a pretty face

[Chorus]

The single touch was like a spark
And it opened up my heart...
That there are some other ways

The innocence's gone
Your roses ... faded for too long

[Chorus 2:]
Some truth has better left unknown
Some dreams will never die
Two hearts will be facing the truth
Beating to survive

[Chorus 2]

Some truth has better left unknown [2]
