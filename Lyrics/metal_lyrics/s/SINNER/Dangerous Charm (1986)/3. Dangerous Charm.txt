[Sinner]

Sittin' here in my dark room
Smokin' another cigarette in the candlelight
I thought the time was right
Stayin' up all night to think it over

When I hold your hand
The lightning strikes again
I thought now or never

Dangerous charm, I'll be your fool
Don't run away - I'm missing you
Dangerous charm, play hard to get
I just can't live without your
Dangerous charm

There's hunger in me
I never knew how much I needed you
Wanna hold you in my arms
Keep you warm when the cold wind blows

Waiting for a sign
Wanna look in your eyes
I thought now or never
