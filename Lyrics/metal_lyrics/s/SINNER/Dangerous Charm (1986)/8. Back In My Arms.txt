[Sinner]

Hot through the streets 'til the dead of the night
The wind's in my face and there's trouble in sight
First it was the call of love
Love seem to be a dangerous word

I want you back in my arms again
I can't forget you
I want you back in my arms again
I believe in you

I'm lookin' out for somebody to love
Hoping that you're gonna hear my call

Two hearts beatin' like one
Searching for love in the danger zone

I'm missing you
I got your picture in my head
I didn't know how much I needed you
