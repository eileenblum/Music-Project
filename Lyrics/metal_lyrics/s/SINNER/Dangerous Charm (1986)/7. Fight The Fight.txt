[Sinner, Jackson]

He's heading for the horizon one aim in mind
In a world where the wise and the strongest survive
Pounding the streets
Determined to win
He runs like a rage of a hurricane

Inside the ring
Only one wins
This is your chance of a liftime
Someone must lose
It won't be you
The battle of giants begins

Fight the fight
With a fistful of dynamite
Fight the fight
Eyes of the world watching you

There are no short cuts
No easy way
The sweat and the hardships are part of the game
Years of head-training the big night has come
The crowded arena the battle is on
