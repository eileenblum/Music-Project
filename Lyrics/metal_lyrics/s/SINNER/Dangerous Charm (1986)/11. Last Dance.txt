[Sinner]

This is the last dance
The last kiss goodbye
This is the last dance
Our love will never die

I'm walking down the backstreets
She's got her eye on me
I showed her no mercy
And shadows surrounded me
Open eyes beyond the windows
It took only one look
She plays it tough
She breaks the rules

Don't throw it all away
I'm standin' in the rain
Loneliness in an axe that cuts
If you need me call my name

This is the last dance

Then I saw you dancing
In the deep red light
Why can't this night
Go on forever
I guess I tried too much
We were hungry for love
We take it up to the limit
And lose control

She hides her face
It was more than I romance
It's hard to love a man like me
I need another chance

This is the last dance
The last dance

Just call my name
And I'll come running back
Into your life
And if you need my love
Just call my name

This is the last dance
Oh no, no
This is the last dance
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
