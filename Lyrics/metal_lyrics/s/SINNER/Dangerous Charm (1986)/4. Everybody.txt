[Sinner / Tom Naumann]

I lie awake at night thinkin' about you
Your body next to mine
It's good to feel your heartbeat
I never thought that I'd be touching you, loving you
And all the lost and lonely nights were so hard
Without you

Everybody wants somebody
I want you by my side
Everybody needs somebody
I want you
I need you

Memories of moments that couldn't be destroyed
I threw off these chains
They're holding me back
Why did we pretend
We didn't care
Were we scared
I hate the thought
To walk the streets of broken dreams
