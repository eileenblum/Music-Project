[Sinner]

I gave her my palm
Though first I didn't want to
She was so young
She's got the magic touch
Her crystal ball told her all
She saw my secret wishes
My desire reflected in her eyes

I ain't telling lies
I saw a gypsy cry
It's like a miracle I can't say no, no, no
Together we could break down the walls
Gypsy tears I feel 'em running through my heart

She's acting so strange
I know she feels the same
One kiss on her cheek
It was like an explosion in me
Last time we met she turned away
I couldn't understand it
I guess she knows
What the future holds
