she was cool, she was hot - she was ready for my blood
she goes slow, so slow - oh she goes down low
i tried it bring my message back
can't deny i really want her bad - so bad

i came back, to attack - i really want her back
but for good, i could - that she will understood
i'm out here with my restless heart 
face to face i knew it from the start

how could you dream - we're go to extremes
i will count my time - better call it crime
and i'm ready for your scream

i will go on - my heart will beat
i'll take your heart - when we will meet
at the congress of deceit

will i see her again, will she call me friend?
she goes slow, so slow - oh she goes down low
will she ever heal my wounds
or is it up a big misunderstanding

how could you dream - we're go to extremes
i will count my time - better call it crime
and i'm ready for your scream

i will go on - my heart will beat
i'll take your heart - when we will meet
at the congress of deceit
