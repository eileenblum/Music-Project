i walk alone - through the shadows of dawn
my heart tells you why 
what i'm going through, the nights without you 
i was prepared to die

there is an open flame
burning the game

sea of emotion - blood relations
i will remember
i'll send a prayer - blood relations
i will remember you

an innocent age - turns into an angry rage
i'm living with heartache
i tried not to call - my hands on the wall
let the light shine out of the darkness

there is an open flame
burning the game

sea of emotion - blood relations
i will remember
i'll send a prayer - blood relations
i will remember you
