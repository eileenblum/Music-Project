in this crazy world, you've proofed that you are mine
you know the passion, that would lead us blind
i took a look, you're safe with me
you noticed something that was more than real
when we make love, over and over
can you heal the pain, when you call my name
nothing's seems the same

i 'll be there - would you bleed
in the night of the wolf
see the moon, see the stars
in the night of the wolf
i'll be there, just one more time
i'll be there - in the night of the wolf

how many times you're lying close to me
i could show what i really feel
when we make love - over and over
i will heal your pain and we won't complain
throw away the chains 

i 'll be there - would you bleed
in the night of the wolf
see the moon, see the stars
in the night of the wolf
i'll be there, just one more time
i'll be there - in the night of the wolf
