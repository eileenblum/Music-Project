where do i find the miracle 
i walk thorugh holy water
pray to lord my sacred soul
walking down the meanest streets
never took the easy way
faith is not enough
i'm in a cold cold sweat

you'll ain't see me crying
and when it hurts i'll carry the pain
no reason to dying
i will unleash a hurricane

i'm the pain in your neck
i'm your heart attack
i will come in black
and if you plead for mercy 
and hear it crack
i'm the pain in your neck 

you hear some call it faith
well the mysteries are all the same
you dealing with your toughest enemy
be sure i'll see the end
when you hear the thunder bell
be sure you stay on track 
'cause i'll watch your back

you'll ain't see me crying
and when it hurts i'll carry the pain
no reason to dying
i will unleash a hurricane

i'm the pain in your neck
i'm your heart attack
i will come in black
and if you plead for mercy 
and hear it crack
i'm the pain in your neck
