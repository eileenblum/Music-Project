laughing and crying
when a part of you is dying
you won't not coming back
try to hide my fascination,
livin' up your expectations
oh my life was tough

made up my mind
run to the outside
breath a little life

mama do you hear me
your son just needs a prayer
mama do you hear me
and i know that you will care 
my life seems to fade .... away
the edge of the blade

mom i think i'm going insane
i won't end up in these chains
with my back against the wall
when i touched the holy ground
there's a call i'm just hellbound
but i'm waiting for your fall

a certain situation
for my bad reputation
fighting your damnation

mama do you hear me
your son just needs a prayer
mama do you hear me
and i know that you will care 
my life seems to fade .... away
the edge of the blade
