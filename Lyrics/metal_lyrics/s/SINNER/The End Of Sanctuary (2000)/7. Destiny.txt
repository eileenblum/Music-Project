I saw a star in the sky 
nothing of the property means 
(it was this) moment in life
(when tears) are turning you'll bleed 

there was none escapes 
more none before or back 
the sky became darkly
was it the arrival 
of a my deepest vision? 
or was it the end for me?

Breaking the silence 
there's no turning back 
where's my destiny?

I saw a dream I knew
another curse forgotten came true
cast into outer darkness
that face came out of the blue

there was none escapes 
more none before or back 
the sky became darkly
was it the arrival 
of a my deepest vision? 
or was it the end for me?

Breaking the silence 
there's no turning back 
where's my destiny?
