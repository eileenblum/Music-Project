i walk alone in the dark
there's anger in my hurted heart
no one will ever hear me scream
i'm living my broken dreams

my life is turning into ruins
my only friend a moving shadow
i will be called the king of fools
silent screams

caught in the moment, this can't be true
disaster strikes, it came out of the blue
running the edge 'till the point of no return
here and forever - my broken world

it's not the game of good and bad
a situation that drives me mad
i'm on the road that goes down the drain
in a rage of jealousy and pain

my life is turning into ruins
my only friend a moving shadow
i will be called the king of fools
silent screams

caught in the moment, this can't be true
disaster strikes, it came out of the blue
running the edge 'till the point of no return
here and forever - my broken world
