there I'm sitting now
around me everything 
works cold and empty
there is no more faith

who says, you would have 
a good character lies
your little black heart strikes
on the wrong side

signed, sealed and delivered
it's my wounded heart
I knew it from the start
signed, sealed and delivered
I can't wait any longer
can't get any wronger

your view changed
and at the end i failed
don't expect me to die 
with the pace of a snail

I could not do it 
what has happened here 
fought and crawling upward 
I mark pain property

signed, sealed and delivered
it's my wounded heart
I knew it from the start
signed, sealed and delivered
I can't wait any longer
can't get any wronger

everything I felt you 
I forget the blue 
your words are full lies
there's no more desire - no

here I'm sitting now
around me everything 
works cold and empty
there is no more faith

signed, sealed and delivered
it's my wounded heart
i knew it from the start
signed, sealed and delivered
i can't wait any longer
can't get any wronger
