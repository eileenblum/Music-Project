i'm trapped in this silence
i'm feeling so cold
no prayer and no future
no warning - no hope

there is no tomorrow
and i can't see the sun
i light up this candle
and i'm waiting fot the sacred son

the bond of holy
living at the end of sanctuary
i never thought that tale's reality
you won't believe, what did i see?
the end of sanctuary

the world will run scared 
no one is prepared
it comes out of the blue
and destroy the sacred world

the bond of holy
living at the end of sanctuary
i never thought that tale's reality
you won't believe, what did i see?
the end of sanctuary
