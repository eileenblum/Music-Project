blood shot - evil eyes
a black robe covered his lies
tangeld in extreme caress
the last confess

standing in the crossroads
going down the line
keeping up the feelings
send a sign

does it makes a bigger difference
who's the sinner who's the saint
father forgive me - help me
give me more to complain
the hand of the saint

i never thought i 'll break the spell
endless circles i hear the bell
i look the left and to the right
the holy man was out of sight

standing in the crossroads
going down the line
keeping up the feelings
send a sign

does it makes a bigger difference
who's the sinner who's the saint
father forgive me - help me
give me more to complain
the hand of the saint
