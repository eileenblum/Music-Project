time to forget, felt like a wreck
i know, i felt a bad pain in my neck
the hard days, the rough nights 
i saw your face, a slam at first sight

what was the deal 
and it don't makes a difference
when lightning strikes i'll lost the innocence
who's to blame, who's pride
'till the heavy tide, i will standing at your side

hear me calling
and your friend don't know
hear me calling 
oh your mama don't know

here it comes, here it goes 
when i thought that nothings seem to glow
here's the kiss, that's what i miss
but slow, i really need to know

what was the deal 
and it don't makes a differnece
when lightning strikes, there can't be a distance
i go down low, sinking slow
if someone cares he really needs a low blow 

hear me calling
and your friend don't know
hear me calling 
oh your mama don't know
