Dragons are real
Let me tell you a story

Some things are stranger than fiction
Sometimes life is surreal
But I'm gonna tell you a story
I found out than dragons are real

I sat in a bar with a wizard
He said son, let me tell you this
Be careful with beautiful women
Don't be fooled by just one kiss

Dragons are real
Can't argue with the facts
A dragon spits flames
And will stab you in the back
Dragons are real
'Cause a wizard told me
They will stab you in the back
Dragons are real
That's a fact

I thought I had a wonderful woman
But I didn't see her claws
Blinded by her beauty
But found out my thinking was flawed

Turns out she was a dragon
But I didn't realize
She was just looking for someone
To blame for her miserable life

Dragons are real
Can't argue with the facts
A dragon spits flames
And will stab you in the back
Dragons are real
'Cause a wizard told me
They will stab you in the back
Dragons are real
That's a fact

Dragons are real
Can't argue with the facts
A dragon spits flames
And will stab you in the back
Dragons are real
'Cause a wizard told me
They will stab you in the back
Dragons are real
That's a fact

Let me tell you a story
And it was not long ago
