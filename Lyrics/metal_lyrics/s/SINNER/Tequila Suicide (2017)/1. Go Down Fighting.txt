It's quiet now on battle hill
The fighting stopped and all is still
The blood of many warriors spent

Freedom waits on the horizon
Through the fire, through the flames
Too many died without a reason here

The cry on battle hill
And time stood still
The cry on battle hill
The green turns into red

We had hope and there was pain
A cry for mercy, all in vain
After years they will still repent

Freedom waits on the horizon
Through the fire, through the flames
Too many died without a reason here

The cry on battle hill
And time stood still
The cry on battle hill
The green turns into red

The cry on battle hill
And time stood still
The cry on battle hill
The green turns into red
