Touched your skin and burnt my fingers
Another bottle lies here empty
There will be another time, another life
But nothing will ever change
I wanna hear you breath when the sun comes up
Just let me hold you before I go

There was such a fire
Just how beautiful you are
And I hate myself for being guilty

And now it ain't easy
Dying on a broken heart
And even if it's time to go
My heart tells me stay
My heart says no
When will I see you again
When will I see you again

Take my hand and walk with me
Until the end of the world
Things seem to be impossible â come closer
I've recognized how I've hurt you

I wanna hear you breath
When the sun comes up
Just let me hold you before I go

Let's run away and build a house of love
Suffering's still my guest
And monkey on my back

And now it ain't easy
Dying on a broken heart
And even if it's time to go
My heart tells me stay
My heart says no
When will I see you again

And now it ain't easy
Dying on a broken heart
And even if it's time to go
My heart tells me stay
My heart says no
When will I see you again
