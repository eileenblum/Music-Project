I better smile anyway
Thinking about you every day
You know I miss you much
I crave for your touch

You see the scars
This broken heart
Written in the stars
And I feel the scars
More and more
You know it's true
I got the sinner blues

I'm always there for you
Waiting here and sing the blues
We're together but far apart
But you know it's not forever

You have my heart in your hands
Thinking about the times
When you were here
Love is blind, love is cruel
But sometimes our dreams come true

You see the scars
This broken heart
Written in the stars
And I feel the scars
More and more
You know it's true
I got the sinner blues

You see the scars
This broken heart
Written in the stars
And I feel the scars
More and more
You know it's true
I got, I got the sinner blues

Love is blind, love is blind, love is cruel
I got the sinner blues
Love is blind, love is blind, love is cruel
Love is blind, love is cruel
