I try to turn the hands of time
Our fire burns through wind and rain
Will I see the sunrise again?

Tonight I come and give you more
Rescue our hearts from the storm
I'm not ready to walk away

I believe in your love
One more night is not enough
Just the ray of hope

Just why?
Why I see it in your eyes
Why heartbeats never lie
Just tell my why

I'm walking through the summer rain
The sun is shining, my heart feels like rain
Just cry me a river

It's not the time to say goodbye
The fighting's worth, you're at my side
Just call my name

I believe in your love
One more night is not enough
Just the ray of hope

Just why?
Why I see it in your eyes
Why heartbeats never lie
Just tell my why

Just why?
Why I see it in your eyes
Why heartbeats never lie
Just tell my why

Just why?
Why I see it in your eyes
Why heartbeats never lie
Just tell my why
