[Sinner, Schleifer]

Two steps from heaven
Your love is deep inside me
It's a chain reaction
From my head down to my feet

I romanced without good reason
It's time to walk
These lonely streets again

Don't tell me
That you need another chance
Don't tell me
That your love is gone
Don't tell me
About your broken heart
Don't tell me
That your love is gone

The day will come soon
That you wake up and find me gone
Like the rain that falls
So will your tears

I can't stay here any longer
But my heart beats for you
Stronger and stronger

Don't tell me
That your love is gone

[Solo: Angel]
