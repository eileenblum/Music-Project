[Sinner]

I don't care 'bout what they say
I'm not here to runaway
I thought she was shy
I was hungry for some thrill
Didn't know that looks could kill
There's love in her eyes

As a stranger in the dawn
She left me confused
That can't be the truth

A pressure for revenge will rise
Oh I'm feeling paralyzed
There are tears in her eyes
As she moved out of the dark
Destroying the past
Standing here face to face

Hot &amp; ready to strike
We're playing with fire and ice
Hot &amp; ready to strike
The curtain falls deep in the night
We're playing with fire and ice

[Solo: Mathias / Angel]
