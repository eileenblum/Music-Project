[Sinner, Van Der Graaf]

Chains that we're draggin'
Hidden things that no one sees
With wild dreams
We're stalkin' the streets
Our revolution's just begun
Look to the left and to the right
You live in danger tonight

The age of rock
Roarin' like thunder
Age of rock
One step from the edge
Age of rock
Deadly as the viper
Age of rock
Busted out of your head

Screams break the silence
We come to break the rules
We learned how to fight
We checked the history, too
Until the sun comes up
We're messin' with the heavy stuff

Screams break the silence
Our revolution's just begun
The age of rock
The revolution's just begun

Age of rock - Rock
Age of rock

[Solo: Mathias / Angel]
