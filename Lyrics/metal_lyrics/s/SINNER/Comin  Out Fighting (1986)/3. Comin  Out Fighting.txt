[Sinner, Van Der Graaf]

Down at the corner
We're spending our time
Takin' anything that's going
We get out of the line
On the run with the boys
Lust and greed in their eyes and people said:
They live a dangerous life

You better face it start rockin' the streets

Run
Comin' out fighting and believe in rock'n'roll
Run
Comin' out fighting - charge our dynamo

In the backstreet bars
At the edge of the town
I'll show you something strange
Where heavy metal goes down
Thrills in the night
Far from the light
What goes on behind closed door is called
The fever of the night

[Solo: Mathias]
