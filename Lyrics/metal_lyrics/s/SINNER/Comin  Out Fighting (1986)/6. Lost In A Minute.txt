[Sinner]

She's so young
She's touch enough she cooks with dynamite
She's so rough
She's a dangerous girl
Oh she loves the night

But she's caught in a line of fire
As her body burns with desire

I was lost in a minute
She's only a minute to break her heart
Lost in a minute
She looks out for a brand new start

She looks mean
When she glances at me with her deep blue eyes
She looks hot
When she steps in front of the neon lights

But she thought it's just a game
She will never runaway
