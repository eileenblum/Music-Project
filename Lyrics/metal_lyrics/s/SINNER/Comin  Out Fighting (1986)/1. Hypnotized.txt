[Sinner, Schleifer]

I have your postcard and some magazine
There's no hope, just a tear
Oh your magic, is desire burning in my heart

I need someone who is there for me
And the feelin' comes again when I touch you
Ooh I can't sleep at night

[Chorus 1:]
Nowhere to run
Still standin' in the rain - Standin' in the rain
No place to hide
It's still the shadow play

[Chorus 2:]
Nowhere to run
I'm hypnotized
I'm on fire
You got the key to my heart
Nowhere to run
I'm hypnotized
I'm out on the streets...
And I wish that you were here

Walkin' down the boulevard
I get the feelin' that you can't be far
And I wonder ... if there's too much fancination

It's hard enough in the danger streets
Forget the trouble if you won't believe
I've got my pride ... and I just stay alive

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]

[Solo: Mathias / Angel]

[Chorus 1 &amp; 2]
