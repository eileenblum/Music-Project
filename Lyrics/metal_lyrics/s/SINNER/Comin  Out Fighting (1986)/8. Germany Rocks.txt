[Sinner]

Longing for sin
I'm ready to win
Let the rock break loose
They point their fingers
At me and ask
Can you rock, can you roll

The music's growing loud
The heat and the fever rises
There's a chance to break the ice
For a nation built on rock'n'roll

Germany rocks - Hey

Turn it up - Up
Turn it loud - Loud
Stamp your feet, bang your head
There's no escape
You can't run away
You couldn't get enough

Germany rocks

[Solo: Angel]
