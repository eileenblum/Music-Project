[Sinner]

Faces come and go
The bodies are always the same
They're speakin' in unctuous words
But they cheat - always the same
Conservative shorthairs
Won't believe what we're doin'
Their numbers up and our generation will rule it
Down down
Don't let 'em bring you down
We won't bring back their old time
We strike back again

Faster than the light
We speed at night
Faster than the light
Run for your life

Fight for the same reasons
Establishing our rights
We're out in the cold
Got nothing to lose than a lonely life
Tyrranical blockheads busting our arrogance

[Solo: Mathias]
