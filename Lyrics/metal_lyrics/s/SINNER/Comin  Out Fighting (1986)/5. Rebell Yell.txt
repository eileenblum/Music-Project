[Billy Idol, Steve Stevens]
[from Billy Idol "Rebel Yell" (1983)]

Last night a little dancer
Came dancing to my door
Last night a little angel
Came pumping on the floor
She said "Come on baby
I got a liscense for love
And if it expires - pray hell from above"

In the midnight hour
She cries "more, more, more"
With a rebel yell
"More, more, more"
In the midnight hour
She cries "more, more, more"
With a rebel yell - "more, more, more"

She don't like slavery
She won't sit and beg
But when I'm tired and lonely
She sees me to bed
What set you free
And brought you to me babe
What set you free - I need you
Hear by me - because

He lives in his own heaven
Collects it to go from the seven eleven
Well he's out at night to collect a fare
Just so long, just so long
I don't mess up his hair

[Solo: Angel]
