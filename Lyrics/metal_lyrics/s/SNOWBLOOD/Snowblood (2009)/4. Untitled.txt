The narratives of our lives are being written for us
New gilded cages are being forged for us
New cathedrals of capital are being built for us

Between just wasting the passing of time together
Or starting to unmask those powers forever

Reject the serpent and all of his lies
Accept all the horror, pain and joy of life

Enclosure
Enduring
This corprorate imperium is genocide:
Time to let go
Hold
Let go
Hold

I could never love this lovelessness
I could never love this endless Qana in our hearts

In time, all pain is nothing
But you try to find peace with you money,
I don't want you money

I don't want your money,
But you try to bring me down with your money,
In time it all comes to nothing
