You see it, like you feel it
Softly showing, removing yourself
You see it, like you feel it
Softly showing, removing yourself

I have to do this, forget myself
I have to do this, the grains of life
I have to do this, forget yourself
I have to do this, the grains of life

Show it, like you feel it
Forget ourselves
The grains of life
Try to show it, like you feel it
Forget ourselves
The grains of life

Babylon on fire
No one to protect, what we fought for
As Babylon burns, a smouldering wreck, nature forgotten

It burns
