Aching for some distant rest
I need to decolonise myself
Reaching for some distant rest
With a lightness of touch, or a hardness of heart

Hold on

Fading like last night's dream
Dying like the sense of separate self

Rising (Security on fire)
Rising from the past that must be shed
Rising (Why now is the question?)
Rising from the place that must be left
(Why now? It doesn't matter)
Don't be afraid

Tonight the cells will break open
Tonight we see who we really are

After all this narcissism, this is how it finally ends
After all this attachment, thus is how it finally ends
After all this acquisition, this is how it finally ends

A bleached skull: an empty begging bowl
We're going to vanish forever
