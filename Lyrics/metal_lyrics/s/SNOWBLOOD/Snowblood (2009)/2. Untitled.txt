I wish I could breathe words and sing pictures
Before the night fades
But it's now winter,
My friend and I don't speak your language
Soon the thread will be severed and the cycle will end
My pen casts a shadow and darjebs the words I write
And the words pulse and dissolve
And melt into puddles on the pavement outside

These wounded sounds burn and are born of fire
And give voice to questions
Of who we are and where we belong
Are we now living in a world without elders?
We watch as the young eat each other
I don't have the answers, but who does?

And I thought to myself, in some Adriatic storm
Sit Meum Auxilium Christus

Dancing as the clouds spread
A thousand sleeping stories
A new transfiguration
Wildness overwhelms me
Can you see?
