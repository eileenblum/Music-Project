Escape is not freedom: face the bitter cold, wastrel
Dull urbanity, why?
Escape is not freedom: lower your eyes, stargazer
We give birth and we take death
And when we're born, we're not born into the world, we die into it
And when we die, we don't die out of the world, we die into it
The great chain of being continues
If you will it, it is no dream
We are the dreamers: and we are the dreamers of dreams

Sentimentality kills the moment
You must harvest the fruits of the present
There's not a second to lose
Not a second, there's not a second to lose
So move! now! now! now or never!
Fucking move! now! now! now or never!
Urbane dullard, why?
Apathy descending leads to darkness accumulating
Apathy descending: darkness accumulating
But it's not over
