A way can be a guide
But not a constant path
Our future is shorter than our past

Nothing: got to fill the gap with something
Nothing: got to fill the gap with anything
No one: got to fill the gap with someone
No one: got to fill the gap with anyone

Claim nothing as thine own

I...I...I renounce it and I... I... I renounce it and I... (c'mon)

Claim nothing as thine own

This city is killing me
I hate it here

Claim nothing

I...I...I renounce it and I... I... I renounce it and I...

A way has been a guide
But not a constant path
One day I will return
