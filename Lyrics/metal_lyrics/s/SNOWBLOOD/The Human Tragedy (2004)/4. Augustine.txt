Steam, so crystalline
Wordless, nameless
It's not nearly enough
It's clearly not enough
Augustine revealed the mind of god
Hume killed him stone dead
Wordless, nameless
It's not nearly enough
It's clearly not enough
The eternal formless
It's not nearly enough
It's clearly not enough
There are things that can be seen, but cannot be said
Augustine
Silence, stillness
I feel it wash over me, spirit pustule
Cleanse my blemish
I feel it wash over me, spirit pustule
Mend my flesh
Gandhema
Nidhema
I am not worthy to receive you, but only say the word and I shall be healed
And I shall - and I shall be healed.
