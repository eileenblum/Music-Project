Forced growth, pulling down
Ghosts stalk these streets of our past
Been seeing signs of the end times

This place brought us together
This place could tear us apart

I'm late, you're elsewhere
Distance needs persistence

It's not worth waiting

The question is time, time out of balance
In facing death, we embrace life
The question is time, time out of balance
The time is now, I'm not waiting to die

It's not worth waiting

Chance, happenstance
We must prevail
Every moment, every locus
We must prevail

Time
Time dies

Black Stars over Glasgow
Black Stars over Falkirk
Black Stars
