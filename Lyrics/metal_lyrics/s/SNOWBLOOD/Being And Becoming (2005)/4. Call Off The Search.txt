Perhaps it's time to call off the search
I think it's time to come to rest

Call off the search
Come to rest

The search goes on
Into the shadows
There is no guide
Only the dark

Call off the search
Come to rest

There's nothing to look for
There's nothing to find

Lie awake at night then
Always already
No one can help you now
Cutting air into shreds
Russian doll syndrome
Piecing together the forever complete

Call off the search
There's nothing more to look for
