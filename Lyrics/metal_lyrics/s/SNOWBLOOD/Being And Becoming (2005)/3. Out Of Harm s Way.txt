An endless harvest colours the horizon
Clutching soil like silver
Void streams flow through

Roads lead to anger
Where rusted salvage anchors
There's no grace like in these heirlooms
Just exhaustion like water

Even only circles for years
The cruel sea claim vainglorious seeds

Shades of loss saturate
Tones of sin celebrate

Black flowers for miles
Cracked fields of dust
But I trust in the coming rains

Out of harm's way
