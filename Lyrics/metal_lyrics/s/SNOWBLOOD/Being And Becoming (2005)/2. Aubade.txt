I know your heart lies heavy tonight
Sleepwalking all day but restless by twilight

You're surrounded by these artifacts
This useless collection of consumer consolation prizes

Crippled by aversion
Bathed in the glow of 24 hour addictivision
Suffering at dusk, the leisure time of a wage slave husk

Peaceless hibernation in the city of Glasgow
Peaceless hibernation in the city of lost adults

Darkness is just the absence of light

This is our dawn song
This is soul music

Aubade
These words are swords
Embrace the light
Cost off dead skin and live free
Aubade
Definitely swords
Declare an end to old ways with the dying of the night
Embrace the light

Aubade

Again and again and again we awaken
Again and again and again we rise

The sun will rise
Must cleanse this filth within

Aubade
Embrace the light

Your death is your life
Your emancipation
Aubade

New life springs from dreams at daybreak
Then the burning sun blinds us into sight
I know because I've seen it with my own eyes
I'm the witness
