Emptiness is form

The lines have yet to fill your face
But your time is still being taken away

I'm leaving now
Crawling north where it's cold and green

I'm leaving now
Going to see sights unseen

We are young, but not for long

Absentee, your silence has been noticed

With an open wound and bright hope
May swords of hatred fall from our hands

With an open wound and bright hope
May we forgive a thousand times
