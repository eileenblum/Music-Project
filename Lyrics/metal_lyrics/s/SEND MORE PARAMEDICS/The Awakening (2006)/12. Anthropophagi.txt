Now Contemplate Annihilation
Devoured By Anthropophagi
Wild Beasts Will Tear Us Into Pieces
We Must Prepare Ourselves To Die
We Shall Be Colonised
Unfeeling Lustre Of Those Burned-Out Eyes
Dehumanised
Despised
Slaves To A Terrifying Hunger
Humid Night Air Throbbing With Their Brutish Cries
Arising From The Heart Of Darkness
Mongrel Descendants Of Your Crime
Blood-Covered Masks Like Savage Totems
We Shall Be Colonised
Unfeeling Lustre Of Those Burned-Out Eyes
Dehumanised
Despised
Out In The Wastes Beyond The Chain-Link
These Ragged Millions Wait Their Time
Fell Devils Marked By This Possession
Blackened Masses Of The Zombified
Savages
