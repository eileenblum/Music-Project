Brother Repent And You'll Be Saved
Rejoicing In This Killing Pain
Suffering Is The Path To Grace
This Filth Will Now Be Swept Away
Whole Nations Stripped And Laid To Waste
Grim Cities Of This Burning Plain
Acres Of Skin Ripped Raw And Grazed
Inert Beneath Dark Walls Of Flame
You Called This Wrath Down On Your Head
Sick Earth Now Vomits Up Her Dead
Retribution For Your Vaunting Pride
Flagellation Of Your Living Corpse
An Agony You'll Bear For Ever More
Sinning Flesh Will Now Be Mortified
Flail Of God
So Now Your Fearless Eyes Are Glazed
Clarity In This Limbic Blaze
Impaled Upon These Barbs Of Rage
Transgression Will Now Be Repaid
United In This Rabid Faith
A Murmured Litany Of Hate
And As Your Blunted Mind Degrades
Bow Down And Worship This End Of Days
You Called This Wrath Down On Your Head
Sick Earth Now Vomits Up Her Dead
Retribution For Your Vaunting Pride
Flagellation Of Your Living Corpse
An Agony You'll Bear For Ever More
Sinning Flesh Will Now Be Mortified
One Third Part Of Mankind Shall Pass Away
