Raw Shards Of Jagged Glass
Overturned Ambulance
Gas Masks, Plastic Shrouds
Cars And Buildings Burned Out
Tired Cries In Empty Streets
Some Things Nobody Should Ever See
Rubble Of Transit Camps
Razor Wire And Food Stamps
Security For The Rich
All Dignity Is Finally Stripped
The Day Of The Disaster Dawns And We' Re Walking In Our Sleep
Blind Face Of Cataclysm Bares A Mouth Of Shattered Teeth
Squirming In Amongst The Wreckage Now Human Nature's Squalid Corpse
Ecstatically Unconscious Perpetrates Its Last Debauch
Families Ripped Apart By Fear
Time Of The Profiteer
Cities Ruled By The Gun
Praying For Kingdom Come
Exhausted Doctors Wonder How
To Stem The Tide For Now
The Day Of The Disaster Dawns And We're Walking In Our Sleep
Blind Face Of Cataclysm Bares A Mouth Of Shattered Teeth
Squirming In Amongst The Wreckage Now Human Nature's Squalid Corpse
Ecstatically Unconscious Perpetrates Its Last Debauch
Soon You'll Be Like Us
We'll All Be The Same
You'll Suffer The Plague
We'll All Be The Same
You'll Suffer The Plague
