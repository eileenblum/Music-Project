Anonymous Masses
Featureless Faces
Bloodlust Is Broadcast
This Is A Crisis
Capture This Moment
Souls Have Been Stolen
Outlook Is Hopeless
This Could Go Global
This Little Room In Which We Unreel Our Life
Fragile Projections Flickering Within Our Minds
Now I'm Enthralled
Transfixed Beneath This Glare
Watch As This Horror
Glimmers Hypnotic
Garishly Graphic
Ending In Static
Flinch From This Vision
Atrocious Exhibition
Grim Fascination
Fatal Transmission
This Little Room In Which We Unreel Our Life
Fragile Projections Flickering Within Our Minds
Now I'm Enthralled
Transfixed Beneath This Glare
Can't Bear To Watch This Ending
This Veil Is Rending
Voracious Illusions
Haunting The Ruins
Looming So Lurid
Shadows Consuming
This Frame Is Shattered Now We Die
This Frame Is Shattered Now We Die
These Splinters Cut Into My Eye
These Splinters Cut Into My Eye
Are You Getting This? I Really Hope You're Getting This.
Fade To Black.
