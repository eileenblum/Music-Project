Will You Always Haunt Me
Shall I Never Lay You To Rest
Apparition Fatal To Me
Now And On The Day When You Left
Stillborn Emotions Turning Blue
This Memory I Finger Like A Wound
I'm Sorry Baby But You Have Toâ¦
I'll Take You In A Death Embrace
Slowly Sucking All Your Life Away
My Love I Will Tear You Apart Again
So Wield This Brutal Edge And Set Me Free
This Absence Makes A Carcass Of Me
I'll Wrap My Arms Around You
I'll Crush You Close To My Chest
I'll Keep You By My Side
Now Until The Day Of Your Death
But You Don't Need Me Baby
This Intimate Disease
This Shrunken Grave Of Nothingness
I Must Become The Beast
Stillborn Emotions Turning Blue
This Memory I Finger Like A Wound
I'm Sorry Baby But You Have Toâ¦
I'll Take You In A Death Embrace
Slowly Sucking All Your Life Away
My Love I Will Tear You Apart Again
So Wield This Brutal Edge And Set Me Free
This Absence Makes A Carcass Of Me
Sever
So Wield This Brutal Edge And Set Me Free
This Absence Makes A Carcass Of Me
