Most Beautiful Of Accidents, These Flowers Of Disease
Pestilence Unfurling In Uncanny Poetry
Invisible Obscenities Most Sinister In Grace
Myriad Faceless Murderers Haunting The Human Race
We're Always Closer Than You Think
We're Drawing Near As You Breathe In
We're In The Earth Beneath Your Feet
We're Waiting Underneath Your Skin
How Can You Fight Us When You Know That We Will Never Die?
How Can You Kill Something That Isn't Even Really Alive?
Invasion Of The Parasite, This Vampire Without Wings
This Leech Will Drink Your Lifeblood 'Til It Makes Both Of You Sick
The Program Is Corrupted: Distorted And Grotesque
Embodiments Of Chaos Will Pursue You Unto Death
We're Always Closer Than You Think
We're Drawing Near As You Breathe In
We're In The Earth Beneath Your Feet
We're Waiting Underneath Your Skin
How Can You Fight Us When You Know That We Will Never Die?
How Can You Kill Something That Isn't Even Really Alive?
Virulence
We Keep Comingâ¦
