These Walls Are Breathing
This World Is Closing In
Pressure Is Building
Shellshocked Amid This Din
Every Careful Structure
Suddenly Swept Away
Now I Am Naked
Beneath The Hanging Blade
Terrifying Phantoms Taunt Me
Half-Seen Horrors Crawling Near
Whispering Obscene Miasma
Darkest Fears Have Become Real
Everything Here Just Wants To Rear Up And Bite Me
Safe World Effloresces Into Nightmare
Sick Fear And Loathing
Infects This Fevered Brain
Nerves Overloading
I Will Disintegrate
Can't You See Them Writhing
Out There Beyond The Pale?
Boschian Abortions
Headless Man Laughs In My Face
Terrifying Phantoms Taunt Me
Half-Seen Horrors Crawling Near
Whispering Obscene Miasma
Darkest Fears Have Become Real
Everything Here Just Wants To Rear Up And Bite Me
Now Every Bird-Call Is A Death-Knell
This Is The Twilight Of The Flies
Screams Rend The Fabric Open Wide
Everything Here Just Wants To Rear Up And Bite Me
Safe World Effloresces Into Nightmare
Incarcerated In This Place Alone Afraid There's No Escape
