Human imbecile
Mortal moron
You say it's so cool
You think it's such fun
Can't you use your brain
While you've still got one?
From where I'm standing
Dead don't look so dumbâ¦
Yeah well I know a way how to show you that it's real
I'll wipe that stupid fucking smile off your fucking face
I'll show you what it's like to fucking feel
The pain of being dead, every fucking day
'Cause you and your amigos, you think that it's a joke
A reason to be cheerful, to smile and to laugh
If I were you I'd make a point of not standing too close:
I'd relish nothing better than to sever you in half!

You think it's pretty hard to be alive these days
You should try being dead
You should die
You should try being dead
