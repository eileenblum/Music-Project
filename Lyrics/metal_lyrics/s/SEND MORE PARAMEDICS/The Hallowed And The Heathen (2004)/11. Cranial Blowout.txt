Secret research results in success
A serum that will wake the dead
Insert the needle in the vein
Kickstart the frozen heart again
Initial results show signs of psychosis
This shows I was right in my prognosis
But there's a bigger problem that remainsâ¦
Cranial Blowout! Gobbets of fluid fill the air!
Cranial Blowout! Grey matter splatters everywhere!
Cranial Blowout! Skull pops with a revolting sound!
Cranial Blowout! Bits of brain-tissue all around!
I offer this hypothesis
The cause of this unholy mess
A metabolic overload
Causing the cranium to blow
Thirteen hours after each injection
Skull fragments whizz in all directions
While pinkish droplets fall like rain.
I'll change the dose and start again!
Cephalic overload, brain explosion!
This is a cranial blowout!
Cranial Blowout! Gobbets of fluid fill the air!
Cranial Blowout! Grey matter splatters everywhere!
Cranial Blowout! Skull pops with a revolting sound!
Cranial Blowout! Bits of brain-tissue all around!
