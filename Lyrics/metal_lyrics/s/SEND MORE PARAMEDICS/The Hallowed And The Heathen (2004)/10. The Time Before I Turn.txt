Sister, dearest, pray you draw near
And I'll whisper these few final thoughts in your ear
They may be my last, for my vision grows dim
And my breath comes in gasps, cold as ice is my skin
From our birth have we fought, as all children will
Anger twisted your heart, but I beg you still
Hear me, your brother, if you think that you can
Grant the final request of what remains of this man
Listen to me
While I still breathe
Listen to me
While I'm still breathing
Sister, my precious, conquer your fear
Come closer, I beg you, I need you to hear
This final entreaty; blood cools in my veins
I have something to say in the time that remains
These words are meant for you and for no other!
Remember the times you would torment and tease
With such an attentive and loving cruelty
Drunk on the power you had over your brother!
You loved to recite me your favourite story
Of the shadowy ones who were coming for me.
The lies you told about me to our mother!
Hear these words
Before I turn
Hear these words
In this time before I turn
Now a strange fever convulses my limbs
The years of resentment and anger are dimmed
An icy-cold sweat standing out on my brow
The shadow of death looming over me now
Listen to me
While I still breathe
Listen to me
While I'm still breathing
Since I was bitten by that festering thing
I've suffered the pain of this strange malady
Sister, my dearest, I wish that you would
(Although very soon I will thirst for your blood)
Find some way to forgive your foolish brother!
I know I'll see you very soon
And our two bloods, from the same womb
Will join and never more be put asunder!
Forgive me my foolishness and my false pride;
God bless you, my sister; I love you; goodbye.
I do not have much longer now to suffer!
Hear these words
Before I turn
Hear these words
In this time before I turn
Calling your name
We will meet again
