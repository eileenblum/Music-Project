A mind of rage
A face of hate
A need to kill and mutilate
Compulsive drive
Burning inside
I cannot help but take your life
Intensity
Insane degree
A burning torch
Of enmity
Against myself
Against you all
There is no hope for me at all
Obsession
Compulsion
Driven to
Destruction
Storm in my head
I'm seeing red
This pattern is inherited
It's in my soul
Beyond control
Drawn to this suicidal goal
Intensity
Insane degree
A burning torch
Of enmity
Against myself
Against you all
There is no hope for me at all
Obsession
Compulsion
Driven to
Destruction
We're all automatons: each one of us is a slave to the basic instructions embedded
deep within our brains, the instincts enshrined deep down in our DNA. Inexorable logics,
uncontrollable patterns in our behaviour; tics and compulsions that we can't avoid; obsessive thought,
violence, delusion, paranoia: we're all zombies!
Set in my ways
Deranged and crazed
An instinct hardwired in my brain
A circle that
I cannot break
An order that must be obeyed
No fucking control
I have no fucking control
Forget illusions of free will
Enslavement by this need to kill
No fucking control
There's only one thing I can do
I've focused all my thoughts on killing you
