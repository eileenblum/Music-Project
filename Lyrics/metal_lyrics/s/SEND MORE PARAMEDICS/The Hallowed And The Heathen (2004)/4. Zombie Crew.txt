Back from the dead, goin' to the show
I can't feel my pulse but I'm still gonna go
I'm clinically deceased but I don't give a fuck
I'm a flesh-creepin' horror and I'm ready to rock!
Rockin' with my friends the zombie crew ZOMBIE CREW
10,000 Volts of current fills the room ZOMBIE CREW
A sea of flailing arms, demented grins ZOMBIE CREW
Thunder fills the air as the madness begins!
A horde of gibbering, braindead freaks
In search of flesh we walk the streets
A congregation of the slain
I'm gonna eat your brain!
Do the Zombie-Shuffle like an Old-School Ghoul
We're the Backups from Beyond, we're the Cannibal Crew
We're the Rockin' Resurrected and we've come for your head
Let's party like we're fuckin' dead!
Three weeks dead, you smell like shit
We're the Monsters of the Mosh, Demons of the Pit
This night was made for us, we're the Living Dead
I'm gonna eat your fuckin' head!
We're rockin' to some red-hot lixx
And fleeing from those redneck hicks
Suffering this post-mortal pain
I'm gonna eat your brain!
Do the Zombie-Shuffle like an Old-School Ghoul
We're the Backups from Beyond, we're the Cannibal Crew
We're the Rockin' Resurrected and we've come for your head
Let's party like we're fuckin' dead!
Three weeks dead, you smell like shit
We're the Monsters of the Mosh, Demons of the Pit
This night was made for us, we're the Living Dead
I'm gonna feast upon your heart and eat your fuckin' head!
Back from the dead, goin' to the show
I can't feel my pulse but I tell you Mom I'm gonna go
I'm clinically deceased but I don't give a fuck
'Cause I'm a flesh-creepin' horror and I'm ready to rock!
Rockin' with my friends the zombie crew ZOMBIE CREW
10,000 Volts of current fills the room ZOMBIE CREW
A sea of flailing arms, demented grins ZOMBIE CREW
Your chances of survival could be slim!
ZOMBIE CREW
