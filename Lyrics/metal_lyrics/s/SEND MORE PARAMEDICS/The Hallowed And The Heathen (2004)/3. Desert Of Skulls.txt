I had a vision
Of a future time
It was a vision of the end
A plain of broken bones under a blackened sky
Dawn of the epoch of the dead
Nothing remains
Armageddon has come
A barren terrain
Desert of skulls
Civilization.
Lies in the ruins and the dust
Before my all perceiving eye
The evil dead have risen and fulfilled their hateful must
There is no living soul in sight
Nothing remains
Armageddon has come
A barren terrain
Desert of skulls
And now there's nothing left
Nothing but dust
Nothing but bones
One million skulls
Gleam in the sun
Wind-polished bone
Man's day is done
Annihilation
Of all that you have known and loved
Zombie apocalypse has come
Obliteration
Of every thing that ever smiled or laughed
Every last tongue has fallen dumb
Nothing remains
Armageddon has come
A barren terrain
Desert of skulls
A fateful omen of the end of mankind
This black obscene revelation manifests in my mind
A shattered bone-yard of fossils gleaming red in the dusk
Numberless legions of skeletons returning to dust
A freezing wind
Rising as my vision dims
