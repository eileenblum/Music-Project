I, bokor, dealer of death
The zombie will rise at my behest
With venom of ocean I'll send you to your grave
And when you return you will be my slave!
Poison in your veins
Flowing through your brain
Death doctor, stealer of souls
By my art I'll leave you cold
Take your life, with my spell
Bring you back, to live in hell!
Tetrodotoxin
Bizango law deems that you sin
Tetrodotoxin
Your fate to die and live again
Blackest magic, secret rite
An evil curse, to take your life
Sacred duty, laws ordain
You'll die and then be raised again!
Poison in your veins
Flowing through your brain
Petra Vodoun
Baddest juju
Tetrodotoxin
Bizango law deems that you sin
Tetrodotoxin
Your fate to die and live again
