Fear from nation unto nation breeds a nuclear confrontation
Blast fallout and radiation causes a viral mutation
Triggers mass reanimation, widespread zombie infestation
Mutual assured destruction leads to an undead eruption
Living in fear of the alien horde
A zombie's heart is as cold as the coldest of wars
Now amid the devastation zombies plot your mastication
Scenes of gruesome ruination give them sweetest delectation
Glowing freaks of putrefaction seek a ghoulish satisfaction
Killers with a single mission yearn for cranial nutrition
Devil-spawn hatched by thermonuclear war
If you live by the sword, then you will die by the sword
Mega-deaths
Caused by their taste
For human flesh
Nuclear waste
Megatons
Detonate
There's nothing left
It's Judgement Day
Gametes warped by nuke-pollution alter human evolution
Genetic contamination engendering an aberration
Undead and deformed creation, gross beyond imagination
Warped beyond all recognition, freakish flesh this hellish vision
Inhuman cries
Hateful half-lives
This place of sighs
Where this race dies
Amid the dust
Zombies rise
And scream their lust
To poisoned skies
