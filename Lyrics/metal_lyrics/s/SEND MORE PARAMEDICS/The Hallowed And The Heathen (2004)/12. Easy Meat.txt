Feels like I'm gonna devour you
Feels like I'm gonna take a chunk out of you
I'll suck you dry, I'll spit you out, and throw away the twitching husk
It feels so good to squander when you know you have more than enough
I'll suck you dry, I'll spit you out, and throw away the twitching husk
I am a creeping carcass completely consumed with murder-lust
Feels like I'm gonna devour you
Feels like I'm gonna take a chunk out of you
I'll suck you dry, I'll spit you out, and throw away the twitching husk
It feels so good to squander when you know you have more than enough
I'll suck you dry, I'll spit you out, as when a child discards a toy
I am a creeping carcass completely consumed with a need to destroy
And when the last
Few shreds of flesh are left
I'll let you fall
And move on to the next
No morsel of contrition festers in my blood-soaked mind
I'll slake my brutal craving then I'll leave what's left behind
