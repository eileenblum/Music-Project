The pain of being dead, a suffering you would not believe
A half-life dwelt in hell, no mortal mind could ever conceive
Victims of a power outside of any human control
Abhorrent flesh is now a prison to my suffering soul

A sickening twist of science seals your fate
Your neuron juice can ease my pain
I can't endure the pain of being dead
Unless I eat your fucking head

Eat your head

Only the taste of brains can ease the pain
