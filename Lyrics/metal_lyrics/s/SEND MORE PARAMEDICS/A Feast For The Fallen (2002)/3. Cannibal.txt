Ripping off your head
Sucking out your eyes
Tearing all the muscle from your jaw
Smashing in your ribs
Pulping your insides
Ghoulishly devising all the ways of your demise
Grinding up your bones
Crunching up your teeth
Brutally dismembering your corpse
Snapping off your arms
Gorging on your flesh
These are the kind of pleasures I have risen for

My need will never be satisfied
My thirst for blood will never die
I'm gonna eat you alive

Cannibal
Back from the dead to take your life

If music be the sound of death, play on.

Gnawing at your face
Chewing on your gums
Eagerly consuming every part
Slurping up your lungs
Tearing off your lips
Wrapping a cold hand around your beating heart
Scattering your brains
Ripping out your throat
Gulping gouts of arterial red
Shattering your skull
Flaying off your hide
You can't withstand the fury of the living dead

My need will never be satisfied
My thirst for blood will never die
I'm gonna eat you alive

Cannibal
Back from the dead to take your life

If humans be the food of me, scream on.

Annihilating greed
Eviscerating fast
Not leaving you the time to run or scream
Inhuman cannibal
Devouring as you fall
A murdering psychotic death machine
Shredding hunks of flesh
Gnawing knuckles clean
Spilling out your guts on to the floor
Biting earlobes off
Sucking on your spleen
These are the kind of pleasures I have risen for

I'm a zombie
Flesh-eater
An undead
Flesh-eating
Cannibal

And if you think you can escape, my friend, you're fucking wrong.
