Honey won't you please
Come here and
Don't be such a tease
I love you
Don't be so insane
I only
Want to eat your brain
Please please me

You never used to be like this
The love we shared was oh so sweet
But now I find that your feelings have changed
Why can't a girl like you love a stiff like me?

We'll live together in an undead paradise
We'll even raise a zombie kid
We'll be surrounded by the ones we love
Now just come here, this won't hurt a bit!

Honey won't you please
Come here and
Don't be such a tease
I love you
Please don't be so coy
I just want
To be your zombie boy
Please help me

You never used to be like this
The love we shared was oh so sweet
But now I find that your feelings have changed
Why can't a girl like you love this piece of dead meat?

We'll live together in an undead paradise
We'll even raise a zombie kid
We'll be surrounded by the ones we love
Now just come here, this won't hurt a bit!

Be my zombie sweetheart

I used to think that your love was true
But now I see it was a lie
You never loved me like you said you did
So pucker up my darling and prepare to die

We'll live together in an undead paradise
We'll even raise a zombie kid
We'll be surrounded by the ones we love
With your brains and my beauty we'll make a great team!
