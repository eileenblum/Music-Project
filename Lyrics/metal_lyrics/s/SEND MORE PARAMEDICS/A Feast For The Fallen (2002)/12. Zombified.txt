Zombies rise, take their fill, burning with the need to kill
Hunger drives them on to homicide
Bloodlust burns in their eyes, eagerly consuming lives
They must destroy, for what else is their life?

Try and convince yourself that you are not like them
Sleepwalking through your life in a kind of living death
Brainwashed, drooling, obsessed with the gratification of your own lust
Flocking to consume the object you need, the object dictated by your endless must

See them rush to consume, blindly grasping out for food
Helplessly enslaved by basic drives
Cannibals, murdering, unreasoning brutality
These hordes of braindead killers will destroy all life

Television, mobile homes, all these things we need to own
Lust and greed becomes our way of life
Mindlessly consuming more, our hearts are rotten to the core
The human race is getting to be zombified

We're zombified!
