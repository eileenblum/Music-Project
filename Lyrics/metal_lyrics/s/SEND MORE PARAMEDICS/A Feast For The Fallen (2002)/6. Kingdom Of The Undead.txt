You are puny mortals
We will inherit the earth
We are greater than you
We outnumber you

From our graveyards and morgues we will rise up to overcome
Your time is over

You are puny mortals
We will inherit the earth
We are greater than you
We outnumber you

We are stronger than you
We never sleep, want but one food
I bid you welcome
To the kingdom of the undead

Kingdom of the undead
