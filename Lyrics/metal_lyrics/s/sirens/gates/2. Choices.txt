weâre burning
destroying
our lives have become
tortured
and bothered by whats been going on
reaching and grabbing for dreams of returning
to have our dreams interupted by alarms
this is the end
weâve gone away
weâre falling back to earth
return to earth
return to earth
and weâre running in circles again
weâre running in circles
and weâre running in circles again
thinking big but doing so small
if this is the way that weâre living
then why should we live at all?
my life is mine
iâm working towards not ever having to work
my life is mine
my life is mine
waking up to feel the pressure
this is what iâve never wanted
close your eyes and sleep it all off
Iâve given up my dreams
for this so called life
which Iâll never be happy living in
this so called life
which Iâll never be happy living in
Iâll carry on
put on my tie and fake up my smile
Iâll carry on
so watch me fake it
Iâd like for nothing more
then to live a day of peace
with no care in sight
just this life of mine
Iâd like for nothing more
then to spit in your fucking face
with no care in mind
this is not a dream
this is not a dream
this is not a dream
this is cruel reality itâs everything it seems.
Iâve been a sinking ship
Iâve been a fucking wreck
Lie to me, tell me I matter
through the clouds weâve crashed on down
our wings are shattered.
