I've seen it all becoming
becoming something new
the dreams we once had fade away
but this is who we are
our warlike nature
through years of moral struggle
we are desensitized
our eyes have seen so much that should not be seen.
I've looked for answers from the ones from above
the sun will always set
and if it sets on us before we are ready
we'll see it rise again
it will rise as long as we keep faith
with our eyes we have seen so much hate
I cannot picture this ending well for us
but it always works out
in the end
this was a mistake.
it was a mistake.
our world has become plagued but it won't stick
the winds of change will come to revive
our eyes have seen the glory of what we can do
we must be strong and resist the urge of giving in
the sun will set, the sky will rain.
but we have persisted the worst of all the storms
if we give up right now our lives will never end
we will be burdened with the guilt of failure then
the sun will glare down causing fire in our eyes
the winds will blow and make the sound of nature's cries
we must repair
we must be civil
and as I open my eyes
a new day has dawned
offering us a chance to start over
but we are stuck in the ways of the past
we are still burdened by the hate in our hearts
and with that hate we turn our world into a living hell
we wake to fire and images of life in a cell
we feel remorse but we always try to justify
our rebirth cannot start until we fucking die
I'll fight and I'll stand and I'll be a bigger man
I'll fight and I'll stand and I'll be a bigger man
I'LL FIGHT AND I'LL STAND AND I'LL BE A BIGGER MAN
I'LL FIGHT AND I'LL STAND AND I'LL BE A BIGGER MAN
