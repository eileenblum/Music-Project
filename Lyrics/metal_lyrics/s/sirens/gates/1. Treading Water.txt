oh, my eyes have seen destruction of hopes
and dreams the sun has set for the last time
How can I last through my struggles
when I know that this burden is my own
yet, I have seen
the strength from within me still grows
growing away
all that I love and call my own
I'm waking up
To brighter days
what we can now call our own
is now mine again
