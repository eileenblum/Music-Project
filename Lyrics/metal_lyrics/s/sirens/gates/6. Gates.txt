the line is drawn
you lie through teeth and dead eyes
if Iâd have known, Iâd be pulling knives from my back
why must I be the reciever?
why canât I be dishing it out?
I hear your lies through gates and recievers
theyâre not working anymore
as you meet your maker
walk through the gates and see your
running out
out of lies
running out
out of time
you seem to hurt those around you
turning decency into deception
the jokes on you
you will never again return to peace in your life of hell
the jokes on you, you will never again find an ounce of peace in your life of hell.
You deserve the life youâve got
you fucked up and itâs all your fault
I wonât forget what youâve done and the pain youâve caused
the worst pain in the world is the pain that you feel when your friends are gone
I hope you choke on words, donât spill a drop
I hope you fucking hate the life youâve got.
Who I am will always be who I am.
How can you even fucking think that I would let this slide again?
Iâm moving onward
Weâll never speak again
the taste of your words on my tounge
tastes so much like betrayal
the last time in my life that i look like a fool for you
the gates will open up and the depths of hell will swallow you
In words and in text you spread lies and deceit
The life that you live will be yours to keep
reaching and grabbing at you from beneath
your words and your lies wonât allow you to breathe
Through lessons and scriptures, you sow, you must reap
the gates of redemption will not let you sleep
and in time
your fate will be mine
your whole life
will be remembered as lies
you mean nothing to me
Iâm everything that youâll never be
you mean nothing to me
The gates swing open and you'll find you're
running out
out of lies
running out
out of time
I was trying to be
I was trying to be
I was trying to be
I was trying to be
your everything.
