a nation contested
under god, under us all
what it means is not to be decided by one
but by the masses
reaching out
what it means is not to be decided by one
but by the masses
reaching out
those without a voice shall be audible
those without a voice shall be audible
and as bodies burn for causes we regret
they sit back and laugh.
they sit back and laugh at your faults and differences
they sit back and laugh
they just laugh at those who dont share fortunes like they do
our lives are run by it but we are breaking through
getting rich off of your sonâs blood
taking life from the youth of america
getting rich off of your sonâs blood
taking life from the youth of america
Ride, because tonight is the night
the roots grow deep watered by the blood of patriots
The rising tide
the rising tide
the rising tide
the rising tide
will wash you away.

hearing all your differences and laughing all these years
no more feeding to the vultures preying on your fears
Iâve grown tired of propaganda brainwashing minds of those who are weak and sending signs of hope, believe this is the ending
love is dead
love is dead
our last stand for the life of man
who will be saved?
