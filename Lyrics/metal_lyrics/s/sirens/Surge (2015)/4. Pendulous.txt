Monumental construction
A city built of marble
Endless war, constant struggle
Monarchies disintegrate

Vanished throughout a sea of numbers
Driven to explore a brave new world
Separated; lost in history
Ensnared in a forgotten era

Each grain of sand; a fragile part of life
Our son has gone astray

They plea,
"Stop the tour."
He retorts, "I can't answer for
A child's drive to explore
And just completely ignore
The warning from Pendulous corp.
You'd been informed that the time lines would warp;
split from the connection, splits history with new direction."

"What can we do, what can be done
Can't we just stay back and look for our son?"
"Sorry to say but your chances are none
the pendulistânow his adventure's begun.
His adventure's begun! Told throughout the ages."

Recurring, burdening, thoughts of a past life
Future-bound, reappear, lost in a time line

Monumental construction
A city built of marble
Endless war, constant struggle
Monarchies disintegrate

I struggled to recover the future
I have forged the start of my existence
My edict back through the time line I belong to
Future-bound

Endless war, constant struggle
Monarchies disintegrate

Vanished throughout a sea of numbers
Driven to explore a brave new world
Separated; lost in history
Ensnared in a forgotten era
