Translucent boundaries
Brand new territories
Wading without direction
Carved by natural selection
Wanderlust, free at last
Tentacles draped below
Endless darkness to explore
An eternity to coast for

Bioluminescent
Glimmering light in the core of the void
I am the sunlight
Bursting against the frigid abyss

Directions subjective
Bloom in collective
Bound by currents
obsessive connections

Aimlessly experiencing the elegance of our environment.

Frail membrane
Viscous to the touch

Beaming colors
Radiate from the palm of my hand

Translucent boundaries
Brand new territories,
Wading without direction
Carved by natural selection

Wanderlust, free at last
Tentacles draped below
Endless darkness to explore
An eternity to coast for

We just continue to
We just continue to
We just continue to
We just continue to
Drift
