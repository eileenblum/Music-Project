I've dreamt of a digital revolution.
Drifting through the cords.

I will transform them to drones.
Mindlessly withering, restlessly complacent drones

Line by line, code by code,
logic and syntax, my dream explodes.

.exe

plant a seed
tearing the fabric
back on tech fixation
glitch in, glitch out
chill skin, self doubt
static stagnance
shake throughout the framework.
Bewildered vex besets, nervousness beyond pins and needles.
strung throughout a void of recollection

Progressive expansion of misery
I've dreamt of a digital revelation,
drifting through the cords.
I will transform them to drones.

Restlessly complacent drones.

Line by line, code by code,
logic and syntax, my dream explodes.

Behold, perceive.

Monitor the expanse

Radiance, ambience, gossamer,
How did I get here?Â 
Elation soaring,
coasting through it,
streaming inwards,
widening lucidity,
bring to light a new level.
Open doors,
I feel the strongest urge to brave and explore this;Â 
impression of familiar feelings.
Horror, awe, so breathtakingly vexed,
consumed by fatigue and pressure,
Give in,
euphoria drifts to dread
sickness plagues throughout
tethered fate, expanding throes.

Rip out these circuits, inside of me.

I've dreamt of a digital
Revelation,
Drifted through the cords
I've transformed into a drone

I've dreamt of a digital
Revolution.
Revalation.

The burden of guilt crushes my throat.
I've fixed the world, but ruined myself.
My virus, my vision, my future, my mind;
Disassembled by something that I've designed.
