Submerged, static figure
Sleep / motionless
Infinite sleep

rupturing tank,
trembling shards
my scorching eyes
waking up

neural overload
how many centuries have past?

eons and eons you've slept in that tank
locked away inside this memory bank
frozen in stasis, suspended in time
Centuries of advancement for humankind
I cannot except these words falsified
I demand proof what can you provide?
The answer surrounds us both it replied
From today's date to the buildings outside

Bewildered sleeper, gazing over a brand new earth.
Artificial stars, civilizations overhead
Cities dot the skies, shimmering lights beaming with life
Structures overgrown, empty homes forgotten cultures

eons and eons
frozen in stasis
locked away inside this memory bank

yesterday is now far behind
yesterday is now lost in time

towering spires, beacons of tech
scaling advance
vertically traveling upwards, bursting
arrival on foot driven by questions
crafted by my type
ascending molecularly

bustling port
foreign faces
minimalist
architecture

neural overload
how many centuries have past?

"eons and eons I've slept in a tank
locked away inside my memory bank
frozen in stasis, suspended in time
I hoped to wake up to a future sublime"
The future surrounds us all, they replied
The limitless bounds progressively wide
Magnitudes of journeying deep outside
Exploring what the universe can provide

Lucid wanderers, gazing over a brand new earth.
Artificial stars, civilizations neighboring
Cities dot the skies, shimmering lights beaming with life
Structures magnified, alien influenced design

But still even though I cheated time
awoke to find I still have my life
Decades separating me and my hyper sleeping family
And even though I could rebound
My life is now
My life is now and not rooted back on the ground
