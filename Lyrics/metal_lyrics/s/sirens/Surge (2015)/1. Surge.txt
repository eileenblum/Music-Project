Effervesce; dissolving into grains
Coalescing light burns within my veins
Flickering images and recurring frames
I'm losing faces, I'm losing names

Evolution,
I'm changing shape
Shattering into fragments
Recoagulate
Collapse back to my human state.

We are all living in a world
on the brink of unity; a community.

All I,
All I want to do is fucking surge, swell, and stretch: Augmentation.
Suspend all of my own weaknesses
Float limitlessly, floating effortlessly.
I am hivemind; separated
Hearing swarms of voices converging
Bind limitlessly, binded effortlessly unite.

I feel alive,
all aligned inside,
ignite.

Sifting through memories so bottomless.

Effervesce; dissolving into grains
Coalescing light burns within my veins
Flickering images and recurring frames
I'm losing faces, I'm losing names

Evolution,
I'm changing shape
Shattering into fragments
Recoagulate
Collapse back to my human state.
