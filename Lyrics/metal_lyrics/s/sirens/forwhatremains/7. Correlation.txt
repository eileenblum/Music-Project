I'm holding on
I'm holding on to your ghost
I'm holding on
I'm holding onto you
and I feel the pressure
and I don't want to remember
I can't help but feeling
like I'm holding on to you

your eyes are haunting
I can't escape
your eyes, they haunt my soul
I can't turn back the time
I can't turn back the time
I can't turn back the time
I can't turn back time.
