This will weigh heavy on my mind forever.
What happens here is all my fault because I've faltered.
I let you go, in dreams, I see your face.
Forgive what I have done for I am just a man.

You are my heart, I feel you beating.
It seems to me I am my own enemy.
I feel like giving up, I feel like letting go.
I feel I'm going to make you proud.

I won't let you down.
You didn't die for nothing.
I'll carry you home and put you to sleep for the last time.
there's peace, knowing your there.
I feel you watching.

I can't change the past.
but I'll change the world.
You didn't die for nothing.

Trust in my hand.
It's the one that's been thats been tearing the walls down.
I've made an honest mistake.
I'm the one who's wrong.

Now, those things I said all fell on deaf ears.
I won't be wrong again, I won't make the same mistakes.

We have been deceived.

Despite all the mistakes that we make in our lives
and despite the hardships that we are faced with
it's never too late to become something.
And I know that we can succeed.

we are the forgotten ones
we are the left behind
we walk this path alone until the day we die.

we are the forgotten ones
we are the left behind
we walk this path alone until the day we die.

we are the stranded
we are the forgotten ones
the gates have come and gone and it's all our faults now.
