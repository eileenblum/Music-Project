These are the types of things that I'd take to my grave
the misdirection of society has been detained.
collecting profit under false monickers
the circumstances stray far from reality.
come with me, we'll reach the distance
take my hand and I'll lead you astray.
I'll be the one, you'll find, believe me.
keep me far from the truth.

The walls caved in on me
I'm buried underneath all of your lies
see what you seek
I'm lost, not found.
