Betrayal in the purest form
with shaken hands our fates are forsaken
holding strength to never look back on our past
and work for better days
of our youth slip away from our grasp
marching on to our graves
reaching for those who are better equipped to survive the reign.
now, the world is watching
all eyes are on you
the skies have cleared revealing the lands that you helped burn
to the ground
all the people who cared
and the ones who failed to survive
may their souls be put to rest
raise your voice, be heard
remember this feeling
raise your fucking voice
be heard.
questioning positions
lead your own life
containing the masses
stop and think for yourself
when the sun is glaring hotter than ever
when the moon glows straight through your eyes
where the night ends and begins the day.
looking back on our past
the hands of time are pointed at you
remember this time in your life
for the love of yourself, repent, find peace
I see what your doing
this is more than an accusation
when the tables have turned
you'll see what you have wasted
is this a weight worth carrying?
I'm just a mortal man.
I'm not strong enough to commit to this
the world is watching
all eyes turn to me
the world is watching
watching me burn
and all we've worked for
all that we know
has been erased from the pages
the clock resets now
(I can't erase, I can't stop these dreams
you haunt me
and no matter how hard I try
I can't erase from the pages
of our lives)
I'd watch you die
to be the one who makes it out
I'd throw away the bonds we shared
it's a fight for survival
I gave the one thing that I held close in my life
I am the shepherd leading sheep into the slaughter
receive your fate and sleep
close your eyes and pray for shelter
I am the stone
I am the one that you rely on
I'm just a man, not a shoulder you can cry on
all the money in the world could never change my ways
I am alone.
