I see the wake with eyes closed tight and open arms
a constitution of promises and broken laws
you've given up all hope
you've killed our pride
you've left us buried and
behind your eyes
the light reflects your every thought
this will sink in your mind
until the day you die
for what remains
you put your life in my hands
I felt your world crumble
quit preaching to me
you're not the voice that I thought I'd need
I'm not the one who's begging to be counted
I don't need approval
you speak about the things that you say that you speak against
I'll live for myself
why would I stay always living on my knees?
to stand a thrive (the truth)
to know the truth (the truth)
to speak our minds
to live our lives
question everything
thank your lord
for you have been saved
wake up, open your eyes
to the world
(to the world)
beckon me when the time is right to strike
this is the end of the line
and I'm sure that you'd be happy
this is the anthem of destitution
seek your prophets
hope and pray that they can cleanse your sins
for this is rapture, where was mercy when you were master?
this is the product of our blood and sweat and righteous minds
this is the meaning of the cries and screams and endless dreams
walking on uncharted land
with minds of steel, a heart of man.
this is the beat of resistance
this is the start of a war
this is our hope for salvation
this is our means to restore
it's up to us
to present the truth
leave nothing hidden
they won't reveal the proof to you.
the war is raging and I'm fighting for truth
we come from nothing, we have everything to prove
we are the peasants, we are the kings
we are the definition of what war brings
this, this is our life
we will live long
we will see victory
until then,don't bow your head
lead with your fist
reach for the end
dismiss every threat with faith in yourself
burn for this
die to live
give up your life.
these are times of restitution built upon their graves
we are kings of all we see our eyes are blind and hands are bound
I would sleep tonight knowing that you'll write but the letter will never be found
with our history, I hope I live to see the day I forget your memory.
