Gloomy wood
Men in white
March of death
To the temple
Gods demend
A secret rite
They all wish
The human flesh
You, sacred victim down you knees
Your young blood for our Gods
For this sky, for this trees
That's a choice of the fate
That's one, one way
To save our souls
We commit the sacrifice
And we pay bloody price
Holy knife
In priest's hands
Bleeding heart
Is on the altar
Victim is dead
Gods are content
Thunder in the sky
Rain begins
Goddess Meetra drinks this blood
And releases our sins
Give the faith, give the hope
Protect from the anger of the kings
That's one, one way
To save our souls
We commit the sacrifice
And we pay bloody price
Price
