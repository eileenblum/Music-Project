Come to this town
And hear the silence
Last human shelter
Passes under the ground
Sometimes this silence
Breaks by the weeping
The wheeping of mourners
The wheeping of ravens
Touch the gravemound
Do you feel the gravecold?
Bells of a chapel
Count down the time of sleep
Don't cry, father don't cry
Death is a part of our life
I'm a victim of this law
You cannot help me
I see the dark
Through my closing eyes
I feel the cold
Cold of the twilight world
Moans of ground
Pierces you inside
That is my voice
Voice from the past
My voice
Voice from the past
My voice
Voice from the past
In my cold grave
I can't see the sun
I can't see the sky
Darkness is my friend
Town of silence
Is a symphony of death
Is a symphony of pain
And is eternal dreams
My voice
Voice from the past
My voice
Voice from the past
I see the dark
Through my closing eyes
I feel the cold
Cold of the twilight world
Moans of ground
Pierces you inside
That is my voice
Voice from the past
My voice
Voice from the past
My voice
Voice from the past
No more sense
No more life
No more hope
Only fear
No more tears
No more dreams
No more light
Only night
No more fate
No more faith
No more love
Only dark
No more sky
No more sun
No more clouds
Only death, death!
Town of silence
Keeps the sorrow
Tombstones remember
Names of lates
Autumn leaves
Cover the dead ground
This town is a border
Between life and death
Great sadness
Reigns in this town
Only the mad wind
Plays the melody of death
Don't cry, father don't cry
Death is a part of our life
I'm a victim of this law
You cannot help me
I see the dark
Through my closing eyes
I feel the cold
Cold of the twilight world
Moans of ground
Pierces you inside
That is my voice
Voice from the past
My voice
Voice from the past
My voice
Voice from the past
