Sky is black, life is empty
Only candle buns in my hand
Pain comes, sorrow comes
My son never comes back
Tears on the face, I am one
Where are you my little son?
I want to touch your hand
But you have gone to another land
Blind pain dries my eyes
Life like lost paradise,
Paradise!
Answer me God
Why'd you choose him?
He was so young
Why he?!
He wanted to live
He was happy child
He liked a life
Why he?!
My little son
I am missing you
Where are you now?
Tell me!
Give me your hand
Out off your grave
I want to see
You... my son
Pain!
My blind pain
Blind pain
My blind pain
Blind pain
Day or night, all the same
I look like a shadow
Cruel fate, broken dreams
All my life is a sorrow
Senseless death, painfull loss
I can't return my son
Real nightmare, terrible truth
His house is a dump ground
Blind pain dries my eyes
Life like lost paradise,
Paradise!
Answer me God
Why'd you choose him?
He was so young
Why he?!
He wanted to live
He was happy child
He liked a life
Why he?!
My little son
I am missing you
Where are you now?
Tell me!
Give me your hand
Out off your grave
I want to see
You... my son
Pain!
My blind pain
Blind pain
My blind pain
Blind pain
Pain is destroying me
Death, only wish is death
God, God, please help me
I want to stop my breath
Son I shall come to you
I can't live without you
You was a meaning of my life
All, all my life is you
My blind pain
Blind pain
My blind pain
Blind pain
Rest in peace,
Good bye
