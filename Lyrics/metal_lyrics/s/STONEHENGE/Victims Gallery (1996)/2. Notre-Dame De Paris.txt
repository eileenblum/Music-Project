Gothic shadows
Evoke the horror
Sharp towers
Pierce the sky
Unreal beauty
Created by God
Monumental grace
of Middle Ages
Notre-Dame de Paris
I feel the breath of your walls
Notre-Dame de Paris
I see the eyes of God
God!
My God!
I want to touch your stones
To breath the air of time
To see the holy cross
To feel the smell of old time
I am a slave of God
Dismal decorations
Born the fear
Freezing statues
Look with anger
Gigantic archs
Are like gates of heaven
A great creation
For human race
Notre-Dame de Paris
