It is not dream
It's so real
You're eraping
Only scream
Gates of hell
On your way
It's the end
It's the doomsday
Flame of hell is blinding me
I can't find any lee
That's a charge by my sins
That's a charge by my fear
Unknown force is destroying me
I'm a slave, I'm not free
Gates of hell open for all
Dark world absorbs my soul
Welcome to hell
Dear friend
Are you hear
Demonic bell
Dull of pain
Is in your brain
You wish this
Again and again
I'm in hell now
You're in hell now
Gravity of sins
Is crushing will
You can't resist
What do you feel?
Gates of hell
Are behind your back
Are you ready
To accept this track
Pain is strong, no more power
I see the birth of a fiery flower
This flower is my demon
He devoures my fragle freedom
He might so boundless
He is unseen, but he is great
My soul's so defensless
I'm his servant, that's my fate
Now you're mine
Take my hand
I'll show you
The depth of hell
You're rexexing
By my spell
Obey me
I rule your life
I'm in hell now
You're in hell now
It's not dream
It's so real
Gravity of sins
Is crushing will
You are mine
Take my hand
Welcome to hell
Dear friend
Power of hell
Is in my hands
I'm a king
Of the sin
I'm a master
Of this land
Everyone
Belongs to me
Black shroud is wrapping me
I am blind, I can't see
My life comes to the end
My soul reduses to sand
No more exit, I die
Fate's loughing by my doom
Oppresed soul dreary cries
Good bye my life, good bye my freedom
It's not dream
It's so real
You're eraping
Only scream
You're losing
Now you're dead
It's the end
It's your end
I'm in hell now
I'm in hell now!
In hell!
