Now that you have gone
It seems that everything's gone wrong
I can only wait
Kiss a memory and embrace my faith

The smiling moon, the shining stars
Your love inside leaves velvet scars
I can't end it now, let's continue somehow
I have to have another day

More, oh, more
Or I won't know, what am I fighting for
More, oh, more
Just keep passing the memories' opened door

The days go by, the short hours die
My life is fading in a blink of an eye
I am not the same
Don't let me lose my heart
Touch me, touch me once again

More, oh, more
Or I won't know, what am I fighting for
More, oh, more
Just keep passing the memories' opened door

I can't end it now, let's continue somehow
I have to have another day
I am not the same
Don't let me die inside
Please don't let me wait in vain

More, oh, more
Or I won't know, what am I fighting for
More, oh, more
Just keep passing the memories' opened door
