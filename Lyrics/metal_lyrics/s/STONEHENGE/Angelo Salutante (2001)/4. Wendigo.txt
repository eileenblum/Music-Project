The velvet night is falling, to wash the light away
You're dreaming right beside me, covered in a moonlight ray

And the darkness flows on by
Tonight I still don't want to die
I think you are the reason why I dream at night,
Just hold me tight - you're my light

Raindrops kill the dawning, or arrows from the sun
Bad news from the TV, a new day has began
Rushing busy people, smart suits filled with lies
Tiny evil warriors, armored in their ties

I'm lost in the crowd of the sick society
I can feel the air is less and less and less for me
I find myself rushing in their suits and ties
I can hear my voice repeating all their dirty lies

Wendigo, howl, Wendigo, fly
Wendigo, come for a fight tonight
Wendigo, scream, Wendigo, cry
Love is my shield, so pass me by

(Wendigo, I only pray for one more day   Wendigo... go away!)

Wendigo's a monster, coming from the cloud
The last sense of the weak ones, that the death is far too loud
They can hear him sceam, and then they disappear
So hold me tight, my Lady, don't let him see my fear

Wendigo, howl, Wendigo, fly
Wendigo, come for a fight tonight
Wendigo, scream, Wendigo, cry
Love is my shield, so pass me by

So, I am still alive, Wendigo's away
Your love could clean my soul for another day

But the night will come again, my tired soul will be the same
And I'll wait to see Him fly, and hear His cry
I just try to stay alive
