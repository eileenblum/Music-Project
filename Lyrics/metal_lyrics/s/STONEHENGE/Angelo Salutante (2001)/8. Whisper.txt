Another night, another day
The lonely times are here to stay
Tonight I won't be there to hold you tight
Tonight I'm searching for your holy light

The winds of time tear us apart
I can't get closer to your heart
Tonight I won't be there to hold you tight
Tonight I'm hunting for your holy light

Tonight I won't be there to hold you tight
Tonight I'm searching for your holy light
Tonight I won't be there to hold you tight
Tonight I'm screaming for your holy light
