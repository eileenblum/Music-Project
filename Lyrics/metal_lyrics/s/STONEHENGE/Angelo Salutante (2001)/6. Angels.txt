[for my friend far away]

I can feel your sorrow here
While you're far away
Reading your virtual tears
Things, words can not say

I try to draw a helping hand into your mind
We are much stronger now to fight with Father Time

You don't have to break down crying on your knees
Let me sing these words to forget all your fears
You, you don't have to lose the faith to carry on
Lock my voice into your heart - the pain has gone

Tears of thousand angels guide your way
Let them take your aching soul away
Open up your tired troubled heart
Let the angels give you a new start

Time is ticking in your head
This world is too slow
Try to close your worn out eyes
Just let yourself go

Try to understand my words:
"It's all just a game"
Let the angels sing their songs
And we will meet again

You don't have to break down crying on your knees
Let me sing these words to forget all your fears
You, you don't have to lose the faith to carry on
Lock my voice into your heart - the pain has gone

Tears of thousand angels guide your way
Let them take your aching soul away
Open up your tired troubled heart
Let the angels give you a new start

Angels cry
Close your eye
Clear your mind
Don't look behind
