Now all the rambling thoughts
Rise inside his head for the last time
A journey has come to an end
Looking back in time
He's at the gates, he can't pretend

Once again he feels all the pain
That he gave to others in His name
Now all the frozen tears
Fall like rain to his bloody hand

Turn away - only a few minutes to go
Shout or pray - now it's time to bow
Close your eyes - the journey was too long
Tell no lies - "Lord, where did I go wrong?"

Here between the light and dark
There's a secret spark in his cold heart
A memory that's stronger than life
Through the stoned old soul
This long lost feeling comes alive

Once again he feels falling rain
âI was wet all over, when she came"
How all the love inside
Can crumble to dust - was it all in vain?

Turn away - only a few minutes to go
Shout or pray - now it's time to bow
Close your eyes - the journey was too long
Tell no lies - "Lord, where did I go wrong?"

Fall to space, time to end the race
Now you have to look in His ancient face
Now all the rambling thoughts
Say farewell to this lonely place

Turn away - only a few minutes to go
Shout or pray - now it's time to bow
Close your eyes - the journey was too long
Tell no lies - "Lord, where did I go wrong?"
