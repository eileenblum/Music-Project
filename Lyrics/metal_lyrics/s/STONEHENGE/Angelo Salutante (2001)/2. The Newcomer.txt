Your tiny eyes search the world of light
Try to focus on the wrong and right
How to tell a child
It was better inside

Your tiny mind without memories
Will be filled with reality
Save your weak soul
And find serenity

Rest your tiny soul, and dream again
I will guard the night and save you from pain
Rest, my tiny child, your blood is mine
I will guard you from this inhuman time

The time will come for you to rise
(start all this circle again)
You'll see in your own children's eyes
(then you will feel the same)

Maybe tomorrow, or maybe today
Strange fire could fall from the sky
You're so innocent
And much too young to die

Rest your tiny soul, and dream again
I can only pray to save you from pain
Rest, my tiny child, your blood is mine
Let me hope that you will also have time

The time will come for you to rise
(start all this circle again)
You'll see in your own children's eyes
(and then you will feel the same)

The bombs can fall like deadly darts
The viruses can melt our hearts
The world can turn, the sea can rise
A minute only and the whole world dies
If I could know, just when and how
But how can I defend you now?
You're too small and I'm small too
Who will tell me, what to do?
