Another morning when rain falls like tears
He wakes with frozen heart, that gave him power
To crawl through these cold years

After the dull day, when he worked without a word
He's laying on the bed, watching the stars
And all the flying birds

"I am just a teardrop in God's eye
Let me spread my wings and learn to fly
Unwear all this human flesh and rise
Ride the endless highways of the skies"

Come, rise again
Flow like the rain
Come, learn to fly
Fly with me and say goodbye

Cold hand's falling down and blood is freezing out
In a silent empty room
A letter in the wind, that noone understands
Just the smiling moon

"Now I think, I'll end this masquerade
I will try to walk into that gate
All of you will think, "this poor boy died
You won't see me flying in the sky"

Come, rise again
Flow like the rain
Come, learn to fly
Fly with me and say goodbye

"Now I think, I'll end this masquerade
I will try to walk into that gate
All of you will think, "this poor boy died"
You won't see me flying high"

Come, rise again
Flow like the rain
Come, learn to fly
Fly with me and say goodbye

"I am just a teardrop in God's eye
Let me spread my wings and learn to fly
Unwear all this human flesh and rise
Ride the endless skies"
(Say goodbye)
