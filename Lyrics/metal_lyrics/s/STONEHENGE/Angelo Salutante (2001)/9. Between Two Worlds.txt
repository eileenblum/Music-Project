[PART I. - under the black night of nowhere]

Tonight I can't fly, there are tears in my eye, they are too heavy,
holding me tight
I am nowhere again, all alone with my pain, in my darkness I'm
searching for light
Two winds blow my face, to the distance I gaze, there are two different
worlds pass me by
I know, I've got to choose, which one can I lose, my mind ties my
wings, I can't fly

[PART II. - at the gates of the future]

Now I gotta go, now I'll take my control, and choose only one heart of
mine
My eyes only see one world - let it be, and when I'll look back, I will be
blind
I'll lose one part of me, sinking deep in the sea, and erase the half of
my brain
Oh, gods, give me the will, or assign me to kill, 'cause I know that I will
go insane

[PART III. - questions]

What am I? A man getting older. Wanna cry, can't wait no longer.
Wanna fly, wanna be out there in the sky.
What am I? A flesh gettin' colder. Wanna cry, can't wait no longer.
Wanna fly, wanna be out there in the sky

[PART IV. - fear at the doorstep]

(between two worldsâ¦)
I AM LOST - NOW I'M BETWEEN TWO WORLDS
(between two worldsâ¦)
I CAN'T SPEAK - 'CAUSE I CAN'T FIND THE WORDS
(between two worldsâ¦)
I AM BAD - GODS, WHY I CAN'T DECIDE
(between two worldsâ¦)
I AM DEAD - I DIE WITHOUT THE LIGHT

[PART V. - inside]

Trapped inside my infected heart, two different worlds tear it apart
Heart and mind will endlessly fight, soon both of the worlds will be out
of sight

[PART VI. - opening the gates]

I'm on my way, now I'm taking control, and choosing the real heart of
mine
My eyes only see the real world for me, I'll never look back, I won't try
I've lost one part of me, sinking deep in the sea, and erased the half of
my brain
The gods, gave me the will, didn't let me to kill, I'm feeling the blood in
my veins

[PART VII. - fear at last]

(between two worldsâ¦)
I AM LOST - NOW I'M BETWEEN TWO WORLDS
(between two worldsâ¦)
I CAN'T SPEAK - 'CAUSE I CAN'T FIND THE WORDS
(between two worldsâ¦)
I AM BAD - GODS, WHY I CAN'T DECIDE
(between two worldsâ¦)
I AM DEAD - I DIE WITHOUT THE LIGHT

[PART VIII. - last questions]

What am I? A man getting older. Wanna cry, can't wait no longer.
Wanna fly, wanna be out there in the sky.
What am I? A flesh gettin' colder. Wanna cry, can't wait no longer.
Wanna fly, wanna be out there in the sky

Between two worlds...
