I am the one who sleeps in human flesh
While dreaming of the blood and torture
I am the inner self of innocence,
The beating heart of darkness

At night when I'm awake to take control
And chase the food that walks on two feet
The full moon guides me when I rise again to
Ease my ancient hunger

Like bats out of the cave, I'm forming from
The darkness of this human body
I've waiting long enough to be out here and
Feel the wind blow 'round me

I start to chase my victims once again in
This old frozen concrete jungle
Tonight I'll pray for gods of wolves to keep this
Wicked night forevermore

Alone, alone, I can't find my way, I can't find my way
Home, alone, the full moon guides me, the full moon guides me
Home, alone, I can't find my way, I'm howling to the moon

Now I'm free, my blood is calling
Time is flying by, "how I hate the morning"
I will wait inside this human
Oh, gods, fill the moon, free me with your omen now!

Alone, alone, I can't find my way, I can't find my way
Home, alone, the full moon guides me, the full moon guides me
Home, alone, I can't find my way, I'm howling to the moon
