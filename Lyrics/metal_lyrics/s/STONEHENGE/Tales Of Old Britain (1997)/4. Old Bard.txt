Many years ago
I met an old man
Wich had lived in the wood
He was a bard, Bard !
My dear friend
I'll sing you
About this land
And her beauty
Old's man fingers
Touched the harp
And sweet sounds
Waked the wood
In his voice
I felt the power
All the living
Sang with him
Nature keeps
A lot of secrets
And he knows
A lot of them
He's a guardian
Of traditions,
Legends, songs
Of our land
An old bard
Your song is in
my heart, is in my soul
And you'll sing me tonight
An old bard
Your life so strange,
was so hard
I will remember you forever
My dear friend
Look at the sky
And hear winds
They cry
My dear friend
Listen to your heart
You must understand
A nature's low
Old's man fingers
Touched the harp
And sweet sounds
Waked the wood
In his voice
I felt the power
All the living
Sang with him
Nature keeps
A lot of secrets
And he knows
A lot of them
He's a guardian
Of traditions,
Legends, songs
Of our land
An old bard
Your song is in my heart,
is in my soul
And you'll sing me more
tonight
An old bard
Your life so strange,
was so hard
I will remember you forever
Many years have gone
But I remember you
Your song are in my heart
An old bard !
You changed all my life.
