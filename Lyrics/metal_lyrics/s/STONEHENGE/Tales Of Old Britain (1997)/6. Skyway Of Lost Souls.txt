When I was a little boy
Father told me about this way
Skyway of lost souls
Skyway of great pain
Souls of knights fly in the sky
They go up to the edgeless height
This was so great
It's my lot, it's my fate
Now I'm flying by this road
I see the dark expanse
Wind of death is singing own song
Everyone can hear his voice:
"So real, so great is this road
Your life is in hands of God
Your actions, your sins are so terrible
Prepare for torments"
Now I'm flying by this road
I see the dark expanse
My wings soar in the air
Now my house is here
Skyway of lost souls
My destiny, my life
Skyway of lost souls
My destiny, my life
Skyway of lost souls
Now I'm flying by this road
I see the dark expanse
My wings soar in the air
Now my house is here
Day by day, night by night
I rove without a light
Future wrappes in mystery
This thoughts brings misery
Who can help, I don't know
Who'll forgive the lost soul
No answers, only silence
My fate pronounces a sentence
Now I'm flying by this road
I see the dark expanse
My wings soar in the air
Now my house is here
Skyway of lost souls
My destiny, my life
Skyway of lost souls
My destiny, my life
"Take this sword my boy
And you'll be a new king of England"
Young Arthur went up to the sword
Wich was thrust into the stone
The Arthur's heart troubledly beat
In his eyes a fire burnt
One jerk and the swords is in hands
Screams of a crowd deafened the wood
Excalibur flashed like the sun
A holy sword of a new king
Excalibur
Excalibur
The swords of Gods
A shining strong steel
Best king's friend
The bulwark of State
Excalibur
"Arthur !
You must pass the great rout
You must be a wise king
And Excalibur will help to you
Let it be so"
