Gold Sun rose over a field
Two armies stood vis-a-vis
Steel swords were flashing in hands
Blood will shed on our land

Light of the day, dark of the night
Cannnot stop this bloody fight
We were born so as to die at this war
For the glory of british crown

We live and die
Under the swords bell

Soldiers of the king, you're great warriors
Hoist your flags and attack
