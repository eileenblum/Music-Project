A Harp of a Bard
Told me a story
About british kings
About blood &amp; glory
Life! Is a battle
Death! Is a reward
Fight! Only fight
Blood! For blood
Blood &amp; Glory
We choose
Blood &amp; Glory
Holy blood
Blood &amp; Glory
Blood &amp; Glory
We'll die for the king
For the crown
We'll die for these stars
For this sky, for this land
Pain, Death, Blood
Is our life
Fire, Battle, Glory
Is our fate
Thunder of drums
Deafens the expanse
Victory screams
Break the silence
Life! Is a battle
Death! Is a reward
Fight! Only fight
Blood! For blood
Blood &amp; Glory
We choose
Blood &amp; Glory
Holy blood
Blood &amp; Glory
Blood &amp; Glory
We'll die for the king
For the crown
We'll die for these stars
For this sky, for this land
Blood &amp; Glory
