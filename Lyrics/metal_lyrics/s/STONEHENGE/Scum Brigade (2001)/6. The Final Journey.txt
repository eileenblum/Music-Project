The final journey comes to the end
My bloody sword's again in my hand
And valiant heroes sing my hymn
And glory now is my only sin

The golden palace of my dreams
From the thousands of throats we hear - Attack!
The crystal ruins of ancient myth
Finally will be broken

Our enemy will fall
In burning flames
We hunt and take in our hands
The alien heads
And blood of enemies will shed
To fathers' graves
And corpses will lay at battle fields

The wind flow in our sails with it's fullest force
And heavy waves fight our boat again
Fine drops of rain drifting down at our faces
The warriors' brotherhood and famous brave!
We will win!

The morning day burns us by blood
And mournful cries will reach our ears
The clang of steel to warriors skulls
Great battle gone without fear
Stick blade to the heart
Cut bodies are so hard
From the thousand of throats we hear - Attack!
The crystal ruins of ancient myth
Will be broken to the end!

Eternal enemy will fall
In burning flames
We hunt and take in our hands
The Alien heads
And blood of enemies will shed
To fathers' graves
And corpses will lay on battlefields to their final disgrace
