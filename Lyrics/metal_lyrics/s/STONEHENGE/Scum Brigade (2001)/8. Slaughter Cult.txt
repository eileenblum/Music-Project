Fiery smokes attract our souls
Violence excites our blood
Arms and courage lead us to war
Cruel Mars will be our god
Soldiers of fortune which work for a wage

They die for another aims
Don't try yo ask mercy or life's sake
Death will be your only price
Criminal and sadistic way
Crush the skulls of the human race
Cut their veins! Tear out their eyes!
The slaughter cult is our only life

The terror mass-murder and terrible fear
These are the symbols of law
These are the symbols of will!
The soldiers of fortune working for a wage
Dogs of the murder and hate

Strong wind floats to enemy's camp
The soldiers appearing as ghosts
And as only dead are left at this land
The bloody massacre begins
When there are no more, bullet's we'll use our knives
For the enemy's heads and throats
The children will be butchered as well as their wives
By dogs of murder and war

The jungles and wastes painted with our blood
The tombs of heroes lay around here
The smell of money is one with
the reek of sickening guts
Your skinless and bleeding battle wounds

Last assault at citadel
Our target is enemy's gate
Walls of stronghold are so high
But we will win or die

Forgotten names of those
who were victorious in this fight
No peace, no love and no life
Remember my old friend our victory days
When banners were flying in the height

The terror mass-murder and terrible fear
These are the symbols of law
These are the symbols of our will!
The soldiers of fortune working for a wage
Dogs of murder and hate
