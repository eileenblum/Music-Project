Like blowing winds in the endless space
They run under bright silver light
The ancient warriors which don't know disgrace
From glorious forests and nights
They howl to the sky

Impertinent and skillful friend
Of dense woods and crystal lakes
The ancient dwellers of motherland
Prairies' most notable hunters

In the rain and angry storm
They run under sparkling moonlight
To kill and to live
To fight or to die!

Eternal call of the father's might
Great sons of the wolfen pride
Instinct prevail in their fight
To kill all or to die

Wolverian pride
Which leads us to the battle time

They Believe in their own forces in the battle time
Fight to the last drop of blood in the battle time
Only claws and fangs are our arms in the battle time
Silent woods awakened by our howl

Like ghosts in the deepest darkness
You hear the sounds of the fallen leaves
You see the lightning which sparks in the night
It shows us our way through the trees

Honest laws of forestry world
Leader in pack dictate his will
The weak ones always die in coldness
To kill or to be killed
In the rains and under dark clouds
Your breath flows out of your mouth
To kill that to live
To fight or to die!
