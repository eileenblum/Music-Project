The mature age when time has passed
Only fear and pain remaining on this earth...
Nailed hands on the wall is the last thing they saw
Only fear and pain remaining on the earth...

With tired faces and worn out minds
We've met the dawn of our lives
Maggots stream in your rotten veins
Drink your blood, and now you die

Listen my story. It's my message
Saving ourselves we're screaming
But your real face's always hidden in depth
You're living in your time
So spit in his face

Victims' screams in the dampness of grave
Simple scraps of food for worms
They want to taste your bloody eyes
And surfeit with your poisoned corpse
As they roar and scream
Fighting for your flesh
Rape your torso and eat your brain
Swarming masses will the best of your friends
Is it your aim?

Pathetic spirit was only a valour
It was approving meaning of your heroic life
Remain of brains so many years
When you lie upside down and stay in light

Your life may dispense with empty dreams
Truth? Is this saint? Cure for me?
You know that you're rotting in the hell
This is your end? Do you hear me?
