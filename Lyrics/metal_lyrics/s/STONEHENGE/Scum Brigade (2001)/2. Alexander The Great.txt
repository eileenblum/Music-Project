This old story is about the young man
The young man who wanted to be like god
Embraced by dreams about power and strength
Craving to submit all people to his thoughts

Black crows fly up to the sky
Steel arrows shoot in the target
Sun gleams are shining bright
The warriors' armor's laying in hand

Nights and days as one never ending way
Thousand kingdoms lying down at his feet
Broken to pieces, just as clay
The famous name of Alexander the Great

Alexander the Great

Let's shed our blood
In the fight
Towers will fall
in the night

With an aim to conquest the whole world
He leads his armies to the victorious end
Churning all the nations into a bloodiest war
As they die in the name of usurper's fate

Aryan souls bleeding in pain
Even the reaper's enshrouded with tears
He turns the own pages of the life remains
The famous warrior Alexander the Great

Man of War
Man of Pride
Let the flames burn
In the night

Mighty warrior!
Great emperor!
Mighty warrior
Rise your sword again!

Mighty warrior!
Great conquerer
The great emperor
Who lives in hate!

But this mightiest emperor forgot about care
Pride and glory have darkened his mind
Battle friends were abandoned without fair
Poison blew out a candle of his life

Black crows fly to the sky
Dark clouds are imminent again
Sun gleams are shining bright
Recalling Alexander the Great
