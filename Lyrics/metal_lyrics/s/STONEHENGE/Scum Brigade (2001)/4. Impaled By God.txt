Marble stones on graveyard ground
Human bones scorched in the bowels of the earth
Only corpses hear the sounds
Of the gloomy raven songs

Amazing view of death
It's eternal rotten reflection
We are the children
Of the human vises and senses

Overcome your fear
And the instincts of life
I rape the flesh and suck
A bleeding stream of blood
We are the children
Of the night and blazing sky
We are the demons
Impaled by god

Our way is to let the wolves howl
Our fate is the everlasting fight ('til death)
Victims' screams will burn the flames
Of temptation, hate and mercilessness

Deathlike silence fall down to the trees
Only shadows from beyond float between us
Horror inspires the breath
Of infernal horizon's mouth open wide

Last minutes to midnight
And they're back to the life
The horrible creatures of
Eternal night

Day comes back with the first rays of the sun
Which lights up bloody pictures of feast
But the nightmare of devilish sons
Will begin like a frenzy of beasts

We will come back
From the dark!
The predator's eyes watch the woman,
the sweetness of her flesh
If the god was a creator
We'll fulfill your final wish
Amazing view of death
It's eternal rotten reflection
We are the children
Of the human vices and senses
