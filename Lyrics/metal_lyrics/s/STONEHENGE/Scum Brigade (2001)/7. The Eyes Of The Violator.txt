Frozen winter blows out in the streets
And you go through the empty park

And you don't know whom will you meet
In this silent and sleeping gloom

Lonely shadows are floating above the trees
It was a nude man with knife in his hand
Good evening my dear! - he says
And cold ground was your only sole bed

In the night lays a raping feminine
She is a victim of the desire and passion
Her dead body and heavenly blue eyes
Are the target of mad and blind aggression

Day by day, he goes to the end
Of the life which is full of sins
But the blood of innocents will lead
His aspirations for the sexual perversion

You invade into human flesh
Realizing the sweetness in your life
He embodies his terrible fears
And only death will your beloved bride

Living in romantic myth
Love? It's only empty word
The violation of the human souls
Is the law of being in world

The eyes of the violator
Are always full of tears

As a guest he stays on the graves
Of the victims who were murdered by his hands
He remembers their last breath of air
Death's agony and last stare at the sky

The heart always bleeds
Soul as one tight nerve
The eyes of the violator
Are always full of tears
