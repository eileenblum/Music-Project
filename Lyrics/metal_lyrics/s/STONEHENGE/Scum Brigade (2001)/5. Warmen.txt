Oh great spirits! I charm you to me!
Oh mighty gods! Let your will be fulfilled!

Pray! Pray your dreams to the silent skies to your gods
Stars! Stars whose light's shining bright to your eyes!

Deeply in time when the ancestors were alive
Old legend tells about that great man born

He had eyes of the eagle
Like and bear he was strong
Bare one's teeth like the wolf
Like a rock he was tall
Blacksmith forged him a sword
Father gave him a shield
And the big ship he made
And he took it in the field

Go, go the warmen's horse!
Fly, fly my raven-bird!
Warriors set to the battle course
Warmen rise the swords!
Cry, cry our battle call!
Bleed, bleed our battle wounds
Only in fight our souls are alive
Warmen! The name which is so proud!

Time for battle has come
Thousand arrows flying
And the fighters are as rocks
Rising up to the sky
Hundred men in a stream
Of flesh
Only one side will win
While another one will cringe by their feet

Our boat goes down in the stream
Let the winds tear our sails and our yards
And the fever, let it be spreading
Brave souls are similar to gods
Let the sea wash our bones
We take our death with pride
But we will win in the trouble fight
With the fate we'll win the right to the life

Many years have passed
In battles and flames
But the power is in our hands now
And the stab is still the strongest one

He always had luck
And his sword was always sharp
And he didn't lose mind
Under light and in the dark

Blind man told me the story
From ancient times and centuries
When people were living in glory
They lived and they fought
But now it's myth
Now it's myth
Only ancient old myth
