[Unreleased Bonus Track]

Hey
what's your name
I've been crawling on my fingers for to long

Shame
Is your blame
You think of a better day

It shouldn't be so complicated
Cause I've been looking for this for so, so long
And I can't believe that many things are overrated
So I will follow you down
Then it happens again

Blame
That's your gain
You've been pointing fingers at me for to long

Fame
Is all you gain
You think of a better day

It shouldn't be so complicated
Cause I've been looking for this for so, so long
And I can't believe that many things are overrated
So I will follow you down
Then it happens again

Then it happens again
Then it happens again
Then it happens again

It shouldn't be so complicated
Cause I've been looking for this for so, so long
And I can't believe that many things are overrated
So I will follow you down

So I will follow you down

I will follow you down
