Floating vessel
Searching through time
Nothing left here
So far behind
Sacred pleasures
Spend in my mind
Broken vessel
Wish you were mine
Wish I could find

I give to you
You give to me
The debt will fall for all in need
A simple way
For all to change
Realize our lives are one and the same

Broken whispers
Into divine
Open promise
Sinks in the time
Loathing hunger
Blistering unkind
Different feelings
Youth undermines
Wish I could find

I gave to you
You gave to me
The debt should fall for all in need
A simple way
For all to change
Realize our lives are all the same

I gave to you
You gave to me
The debt should fall for all in need
A simple way
For all to change
Realize our lives are one
Our lives are one and the same
