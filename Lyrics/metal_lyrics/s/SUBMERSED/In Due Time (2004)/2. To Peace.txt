It brings hurt to
My life to see so much
Fear in this world
So I'll sit here
Thinking of all I can do
To get through this dream

I close my eyes today

This is for the broken hearted
This is for the pain that's started
I know with the waters parted
You'll see we will be at peace
At peace

So think clear
Remember all that has
Brought us here to stay
And don't fear
The face of change it will heal
And help deal with the pain

I open my eyes today

This is for the broken hearted
This is for the pain that's started
I know with the waters parted
You'll see we will be at peace
At peace

We are born innocent
Innocent
We are born innocent
Innocent

This is for the broken hearted
This is for the pain that's started
I know with the waters parted
You'll see we will be at peace
At peace
We will be at peace
At peace
