Find me
Want to want
Never
What you see
Calling, calling
The depth becomes
Grab a hold of my face
So numb

Soar far fly away
I'm breaking through to you
Soar far fly away
I'm breaking through to you

Touch you
Feel the cold
Friendships
Grow so old
Difference, difference
Never to know
Clearing my mind
As I go

Soar far fly away
I'm breaking through to you
Soar far fly away
I'm breaking through to you

To you
Breaking through
Breaking through
Breaking through
To you
To you

Breaking through to you
Breaking through
Breaking through

You take away my mind
I'll take away your pride

Soar far fly away
I'm breaking through to you
Soar far fly away
I'm breaking through to you

I'm breaking through to you
