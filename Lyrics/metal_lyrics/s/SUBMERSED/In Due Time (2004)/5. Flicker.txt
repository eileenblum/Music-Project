A star fades in space
As a candle flickers
Burning out of trace
Live our lives with grace
As our candles flicker
Burning out of trace
Burning out of trace

Choose your words
Choose them wise
For they will lead to your demise
Take my life
Take my faith
To stop the tears that run down your face

But I'm happy here
As the plot grows thicker
Passing with the years
Live my life with fear
As our leaders bicker
Passing with the years
Passing with the years

Choose your words
Choose them wise
For they will lead to your demise
Take my life
Take my faith
To stop the tears that run down your face

Choose your words
Choose them wise
For they will lead to your demise
Take my life
Take my faith
To stop the tears that run down your face
Your face
