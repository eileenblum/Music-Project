Father may I be shown
The man I have inside
Be shown the way to swallow my pride

I tried
To lie
For the last time

I cannot hide the state
Of my mind
I cannot free what's in me
It's hidden for all time

Mother may I be shown
The right I have to cry
Be shown the strength I have inside

I tried
To lie
For the last time

I cannot hide the state
Of my mind
I cannot free what's in me
It's hidden for all time

Break me
Shape and make me
Give me strength that makes me me

Break me
Shape and make me
Give me strength that makes me me

Break me
Shape and make me
Break me
Shape and make me

I cannot hide the state
Of my mind
I cannot free what's in me
It's hidden for all time
It's hidden for all time
