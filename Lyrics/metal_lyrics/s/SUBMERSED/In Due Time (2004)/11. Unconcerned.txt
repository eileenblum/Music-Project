Take a step outside
The boundaries we live in
Get to know yourself
The real you, the real me
Join the hands of faith
That hold you, that know you
Let the love go free
It's in us, it's in me

Love lives in me
Love's free to be
Pain grows to burn
Lessons concerned
Unconcerned

Open the eyes of all
Who see you, who see me
Never lose sight of all
You stand for, you live for
Let go over the pain
That holds you, that binds you
Break free of it all
Around you, around me

Love lives in me
Love's free to be
Pain grows to burn
Lessons concerned

Dreams in you
Flow in me
When you come again
The time
Stands still
Inside
You feel me, yeah
Yeah

Love lives in me
Love's free to be
Pain grows to burn
Lessons concerned
Unconcerned

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
