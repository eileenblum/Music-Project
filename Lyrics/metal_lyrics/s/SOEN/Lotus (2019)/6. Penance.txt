In silence, isolated, trying to stand on your own.
Naive and numb you feed the leech that will feast off your blood.
You wear indifference as cover to hide the demise.
Build up your walls, fill up the glass, let it bury your cries.

You're deceived by inner demons that were fed by your own hand.
Shaded veils hide your perception, shooting nails into the heart.

Still your mind, your soul, will find peace.
In the dream, you end and leave us.
You'll awake, without fear,
And your thoughts, your whole, will roam free.

Submersed in draining silence calmly inviting the curse.
All debts and broken vows are fragments detached from our loss.
The moonlight shone upon you staggering out in the cold.
You tried to leave this journey forcing your kin to behold.

Still deceived by inner demons that were fed by your own hand.
Shaded veils hide your perception, shooting nails into your head.
Still your mind, your soul, will find peace.
In the dream you end and leave us.
You'll awake without fear,
And your thoughts your whole will roam free.

Still your heart, your mind, will find peace.
In this life all ends, you'll leave us.
In your sleep careless you're falling.
See my hopes dissolving."
