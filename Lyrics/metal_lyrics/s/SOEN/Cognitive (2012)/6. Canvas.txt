I have discovered a canvas, behind its colors I forged my cell
Minions below release a dark glow and suddenly I see that everyone is blind but me

I have discovered a canvas deep in a sea of disharmony
Cosmic embrace, a soulless portrait of endless synergy
Visions of moving away from me

Concentrate don't lose your illusion; don't let them provide the solution
Your fate in your hands
Close your eyes from false shining lights made to confuse us all
Architectures of domination, society they call

I have discovered a canvas
Using its colors I saw myself
Breaking the norm, induce a reform defying sanity bred in the care of my vanity.

See them entirely abstract out of the orbit we comprehend
Careful recall deficit in all, deliberately recede crescent of our analogy

Concentrate don't lose your illusion; don't let them provide the solution
Your fate in your hands
Close your eyes from false shining lights, made to confuse us all
Architectures of domination, society they call

Call
Don't let them fall; you'll join them all
Close your eyes from false shining lights
You'll see them fall; you'll see them fall
Architectures of domination.
