Every day I will remind you to be there
Try to see the story pictured in your head
Calmest eyes when you are screaming
One thing lost another found to make sure you

Carry on in case you'll be waiting
I will be moving on while you're contemplating

There is nothing to escape from, nothing left to try and mend
Every day without the sun, so you trace a way then
There is reason lacking thereof, reason there to comprehend
Every day another run, so you pave your way then

Feed me with anything, I will see purpose in it too
I saw you planning on something I couldn't really do
Comes clear I'm lingering, I am staying here for you
I am evolving to something I never thought I would

Feed me with anything, I will see purpose in it too
I saw you planning on something I couldn't really do
Tread on the greater I need to know the truth
I've learned the lessons and bring decisions back to you

Carry on in case you'll be waiting
I will be moving on while you're contemplating

There is nothing to escape from, nothing left to try and mend
Every day without the sun - So you trace a way then
Carry on, I know you'll be waiting
I will be moving on to where you'll be waiting
