It came unexpected, still it's laying at my door
Ways that I reflected, you've been there before, you always will
Still my apprehension tells me you have gone so far
They can't say where you are

Compromising this, in despair I'm hoping
You can sense what is, drifting in your ocean
Passed beyond redemption, left just to remember

When the moment passed here silence thundered across the plains
Heavy hearts that ache to hear your say that it is not too late

Given no chance to forgive me, left to absolve an illusion
Beneath the surface I sense how I am growing older
Holding the pieces you left like a last intervention

(It's taking the light from me, part from the guide as we lose our faith)

In my wake, now
I swim against the time
And in the late hour coming to your side
Leave my life, now
Putting out the lights that shine on my all
Abandoned here by tide, left open wide

Compromising this, in despair I'm hoping
You can sense what is, drifting in your ocean
Breathing on unaware, winters reach everywhere

Given no chance to forgive me, left to absolve an illusion
Beneath the surface I sense how I am growing older
Holding the pieces you left like a last intervention

(It's taking the light from me, part from the guide as we lose our faith)

In my wake, now
I swim against the tide
And in the late hour coming to your side
Leave my life, now
Putting out the lights that shine on my all
Abandoned here by time
