I silently confound what inheres in me but is not mine
'Cause I believe in something other that what's written on the walls
How we are murdered for the pieces that are rendering it all

Now you're bringing in the kindle lights, something to believe in
Now I'm breathing in the water that you have parted in the past

You are walking like your father and you see it through his eyes
I've been reading all your markings you have always tried to hide
Set aside your feelings, like you've seen them locked inside
Unconditionally so steadfast, how a mother's always right

And I can feel it in our weakness
We have gained since we were born
Another tower of strength to leave you
As all the reasons left recede

And I know, I know
We are walking like we're falling
Still there is something you can't see

Silence comes your way, silence come, silence come

While we can sense the missing order, what you created leads you on
The machine we helped you forging tells you to wait until it's gone
You're making all the right decisions while you are not awake
Growing from a whisper the voice inside is still restrained

And I can see it grow our weakness
Into the undefinable
How we are searching through debris now
From the fear of being deceived

And I know, I know
We are walking like we're falling
Still there is something you can't see

And I know, I know
That you face a reverence to break through
To have the freedom of your will

Those walls once
Raised by greed
Stand tall while we stand still
Pay no heed
Seize by war
Hand away our lives and thus we can spiral on
