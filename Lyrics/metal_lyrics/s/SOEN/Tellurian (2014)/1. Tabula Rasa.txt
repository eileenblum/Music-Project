I was one of those who lived in doubt
I was one of those who could not accept how far
Counting on the ones we chose will find
There's no innocence, since we think therefore we are.

I will fight the system, break it down and redesign it
I don't want anything the way it's created by them
Where is my right to choose, if all the options are theirs?

There were some of those who told the truth
Who before they rose all were children just like you
Sons and daughters standing with our earth
Shedding light on those that would bleed us, out of view.

They show you

I will fight the system, break it down and redesign it
I don't want anything the way it's created by them
Where is my right to choose, if all the options are theirs?

We can be the system, it will turn and try to own us
We can have everything, if we will change into them
Now it's our time to choose, which of the options are theirs.

Slow it down we're treading on the soil that gave us life
Slowing down we're coming round, I'm fearing for our lives
Ways we leave all that matter, all that we have
Place be your trust with me.
