My thoughts, my all
Stream out of my conscience
Into the darkness

Behind my words, my forced means
These astral wastelands
Unfold their vastness
Beyond the void

The facts I bind to, which keeps me in the clear
Refute the treason, constrain it through the air
My rule, my will, inside my circles

I come to find you deep in the bottom layer
Despite your reasons to hide yourself in there
Your hurt, your fear is where I tap into

Wait to see your promise
Create the shelter for all our virtues
So, how I am a new lease of life
When my comfort accompanies the waves

I strive to blind you 'til I discover where
Defining freedom is reconstructed here
Your rule, your will, within your circles

Make out the beacon that has is all revolve
We set your mind to how kismet would resolve
My hurt, my fear is where you tap into

My thoughts, my all
Stream out of my conscience
Into the darkness

Behind my words, my forced means
These astral wastelands
Unfold their vastness

Wait to see your promise
Create the shelter for all our virtues
So, how I am a new lease of life
When my comfort accompanies the waves

Please hide, who sees who we are?
Trust shares all keys, one knows all
