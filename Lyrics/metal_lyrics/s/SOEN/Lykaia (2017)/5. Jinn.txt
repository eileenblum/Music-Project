Forty days and forty nights
You were the drug that kept me alive
During weary times

Seem so pure when wearing white
Within such a frail and immaculate mind
With those innocent eyes

You were young and full of life
You asked me to swear and in me you confided
Underneath the stars

I should care to you let you fly
A chance to retrieve what was left behind
To experience life

Staring at the sky
Staring at the sun
Waiting for a wonder
Within a forsaken land

The sparrow in my hand
Now buried in the sand
Leaving you depending
Leaving me with open veins

Canât make you wait no more
Canât make you wait no more
Where itâs hard to breathe
Everythingâs blackening,

I am made of flesh and bone
Blood, sweat and tears are all you ever will find
Underneath the skin

Youâre a feather Iâm a stone
Falling from the depths into the grave
Where Iâm destined to dwell

And we reach for mystery
In the age of reason
Every path we take
Weâre wandering in blindness
In the end nothing is
Glorious or honourable
While we drown in doubt
Weâre drifting like strangers
