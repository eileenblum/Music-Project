Wash off your sins
Bound by the burden of the grief thatâs found within
Drowned in a sea of sorrow bound to learn to swim
Wash off your sins

Since you were born
A flake of a broken soul who never would endure
Shaped by the ills of fate that always felt unsure
Since you were born

In your eyes, I
Could see a loathing for the truth
You are burning within

Dead you are
A yearning for eternal life
A longing for a sacrifice
Praying for the end of time
As the curtain falls

Under the cross
The revelations of a narcissistic mind
Harboured resentment for the joys of humankind
Under the cross

Wake up
And pull out the thorns from your heart
Wake up
or sleep with the damned

Dead you are
A yearning for eternal life
A longing for a sacrifice
Praying for the end of time
As the curtain falls

Words hard to forgive
When we fall from grace
