Since we were born and they tore us apart,
And I know those years were hard
But our dreams will come true, and Iâll always stand by you

For all the countless hours you have fought,
For all the times youâve lost your cause
When tears are in your eyes, donât hold it inside
Cos you donât need to hide no more
Iâll be by your side
Iâll do what I must
I hope that you trust in me

I know you remember you were taken away
How they didnât let you stay
And I still owe you till this day
It should have been me in your place

For all the times in hardship on your own
All the nights you met them all alone
For all the broken promises youâve had
All the times without a helping hand

When tears are in your eyes
Donât hold it inside
Cos you donât need to hide no more
Iâll be by your side
Iâll do what I must
And I hope that you trust in me
