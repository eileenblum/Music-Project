As days pass

As all these days pass me by
I'm deteriorating out of sight
I might never get a chance to
say everything on my mind
A chance to say goodbye

As all these days pass me by
Im deteriorating out of sight
I might never get a chance to

What if no one hears the sound of my voice [2x]
What if?
What if my words are left unsaid [2x]
What if?

Will the ones I love
know that I care
Will the ones I loved
know that I cared? [3x]
That I cared

Will you know you were my everything
No matter what happens

Dont stop following your heart
Dont ever stop
