fuck
oh how i tried to change
if only i could be what you were expecting
when you brought me here

i just cant find,my faith
oh how i tried just for you
i feel ive always been here where i stand
i could never find my faith no matter
how far i ran no matter how fast i sprinted
i could never find my faith
my faith

i just cant find,my faith
oh how i tried just for you
i feel ive always been here where i stand

without religion without your god [2x]

i just want to live [3x]

i found myself isolated in my own world
none of this is real to me
none of this is life to me

my heart calls me in different
direction where these notions of religion
do not exist
