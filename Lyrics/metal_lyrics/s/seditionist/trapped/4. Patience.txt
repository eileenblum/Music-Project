[feat. Gus of Volumes]setting my body to autopilot
as i sit in my mind screaming at the walls
asking for answers
to shut this world the fuck up [2x]

none of you know
the answers this world lives
off of theories with no proof
none of you fucking know (fucking know) [3x]

Its all based of faith in a theory
not inside these eyes [2x]
fuck

because i will never know
until my end and neither will you
and neither will you
so just be patient have patience

because i will never know
until my end and neither will you
so just be patient have patience

have patience be patient

you will meet your maker

when your deceased [3x]
when your fucking dead
if there is even a higher power
fuck
