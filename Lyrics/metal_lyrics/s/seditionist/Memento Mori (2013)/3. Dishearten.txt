It's days like this
When I can't help
But wonder if I'll ever see you again
Is this the conclusion?
Is this my life?
You were my inspiration
Your the reason my heart still branches out
I miss you more &amp; more everyday
Just hoping for a chance hoping I'll see you somewhere someday again
I miss you more &amp; more
Everyday
Every second
Every hour
