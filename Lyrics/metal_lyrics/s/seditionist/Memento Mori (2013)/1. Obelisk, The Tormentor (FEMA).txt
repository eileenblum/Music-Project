You've been deceived and tormented
Systematically numbered from the start

This empire was built to sustain
Any type of threat that we propose
We have shaped our lives
Into this inescapable maze
You will never realize whats been done to you

Look at your hopeless life now [4x]
Fuck

The day will come [3x]

The taxes we payed
Only funded your exit to this world [2x]

To this world [2x]

We've been reprogrammed
A mental annihilation
Soon to be humanities termination [2x]

You will never know whats been done to you
Because it will all be to quick to comprehend

So technically
Technically

You've all destroyed your own lives [4x]
