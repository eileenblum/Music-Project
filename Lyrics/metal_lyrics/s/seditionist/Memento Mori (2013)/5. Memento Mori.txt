A gallery of photos
A frozen moment in time
Captured to hold all of these memories
The best memories
So one day you can look back &amp; say
I gave it my all
I lived my life while I was stuck in this place
I made a promise to myself
To never waste another breath

I've already spent enough time looking at my life
Fast forwardâ¨&amp; I'll never let that mistake blur my vision
My vision again

I'll never waste another moment again
I'll never waste another breath again
But still an everlasting pain of all my regrets is still following me

Remember the moments you've spent
You never know what happens next
Your families your friends will all vanish
Before your eyes
If it isn't them it will be you
Take advantage of every single moment
Before it slips away
You will never truly know what you have until
It's literally goneâ¨&amp; then you'll remember what you always wanted
Doesn't even matter anymore

There are no guarantees
In this life
[2x]

I'll never waste another moment again
I'll never waste another breath again
[2x]

Take advantage of every single moment before it slips away
If you died today
Can you say you appreciated life?
Memento mori

My all
