I woke up to a new day
Letting go of everything in my past
Everything that's stood in my path

I will rise above this [4x]

How can I allow negativity to infect this
such a bright, beautiful day [2x]
I don't want to live with anymore regrets
Its such a bright, beautiful day [2x]

It continues to feel so right
This continues to feel so right
I've given up everything, its for the best [4x]

It's for the best

This is me, this where I belong
This is me, this is what I've become [2x]

This is my time
It will not surpass me by
Surpass me by
Fuck
