Set your beliefs ablaze
Just like you to depend on a fiction man to save your life

How typical of you like every aspect of your life
No one will live your life for you

No one will save you from the fires of this world [2x]

You will never know what its like to think for your fucking self
You'll never know what its like to live your own fucking life

How typical of you like every aspect of your life
No one will live your life for you

No one will save you from the fires of this world [2x]

Why should anyone
Show sympathy for you
Your just as human as me
A ship that's lost at sea
An anchor sinking beneath
Preaching the wrong beliefs
It was all just a lie
Just like your life

Religion is a fucking lie

Just like your life [2x]
