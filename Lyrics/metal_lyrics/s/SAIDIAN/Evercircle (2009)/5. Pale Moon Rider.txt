The dyeing sun, nowhere to run
The earth is breathing fire

The moment is here, to face our fears
The tide is rising higher

To feel the sign up in the sky
And hear the devil's call
The century shall feel us bleed
And watch mankind falling

We live to lie
The earth will cry
Just stand and fight
Won't say goodbye

[Chorus 1:]
Touch the light, passing night
Darkness growing brighter
Time is right, soul set high
Guide us pale moon rider

The darkness side just seems welcomed
The judgment day he brings our way
Will force his one desire

They ring the bell, deep down in hell
And when the gates will open

The [?] shall bring his wrath
And [?] his lashes stronger

We live to lie
The earth will die
Just stand and fight
Won't say goodbye

[Chorus 2:]
Touch the light, passing night
Darkness growing brighter
Time is right, soul set high
Guide us pale moon rider
Touch the light, passing night
Fight the king of liars
Time is right, soul set high
Guide us pale moon rider

[Chorus 2]
