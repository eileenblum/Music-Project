Somewhere deep in the night Iâm stranded
Feels like Iâm washed on a timeless shore
Tell me where are the days of glory
Gone away, it seems, forevermore

Eye to eye with loveâs damnation
Tell me why, Itâs not in our hands to foresee
Mindless crime and desperation

Come falling down
Iâm down on my knees
Back to the ground and now I can see
The end of my dreams

I canât hold on to your heart of stone
Donât tell me Iâm the only one
How long âtil the crime is done?
How could I have known youâve got a heart of stone?

I can feel out there a storm is coming
In the sky clouds are drawing near
Thereâs afire raging behind the mountains
Itâs time to face all my fears

Eye to eye with loveâs damnation
Never mind, the sorrow Iâm feeling inside
Cold as ice, the end is awaiting
