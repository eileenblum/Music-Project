Sheâs one in a million of a kind youâve never seen
(With) one glance from her eyes sheâll have you on your knees
Sheâs roaming the night scene
Sheâs the hunter, youâre the prey
(A) beauty shinning even brighter than the day

Sheâs treating you right
Youâre burning in ecstasy
Before you know it
Youâre under her spell

(Sheâs a)
Silent killer
Sheâs just a grand illusion
Silent killer
Watch out
Sheâs coming your way

She looks like an angel
Sheâs the devil in disguise
Just beware of what is flashing right behind her eyes
Sheâs more than temptation
Sheâs the original sin
No way to escape her magic power deep within

Sheâs taking control
Sheâll bind you forevermore
Youâre just one more victim
Caught in her trap

She is the answer, just your one desire
A promise of passion and delight
Youâll keep on searching for a heart youâll never find
Her love will blind you like the sun in the sky
