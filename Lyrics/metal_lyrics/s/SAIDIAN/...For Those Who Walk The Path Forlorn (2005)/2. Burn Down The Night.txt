Locked up in chains standing back to the wall
Thereâs no way out when youâre falling
This life is wasted deep down to the core
Can you heat the demon calling?

Reaching up to the heavens above
Falling down to the flames
Thereâs just one way so hold on to love
Fight back or this is the end

Burn down the night
Fight to survive
Changing the ways of time

High as a kite
Reach for the sky
Never give in âtil you burn down the night

A thousand ways to get burned and go down
Right on your knees youâll be crawling
Long way to go and no light to be seen
But still salvation is calling

Donât surrender, say hard on your way
Never turn back again
You can win if you trust in your fate
End all the hurting and pain
