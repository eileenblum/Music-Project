Sleepless nights, days full of sadness
Drowning in sorrow and pain
Donât tell me lies, donât take me for granted
I might not come back again

Tell me what is on your mind
Is this your own way of life?

Canât stand these lonely nights
You wonât hear me calling
Canât stand these lonely nights
Theyâll take me away

Out of sight, out of my memory
I tell myself one more time
But still itâs true that I canât forget you
No matter how hard I try

Tell me what is on your mind
Any chance for us to find (a way)

In loneliness I am bleeding
But you just donât seem to care
Voices whisper sheâs leaving
Drag me down into deep despair
