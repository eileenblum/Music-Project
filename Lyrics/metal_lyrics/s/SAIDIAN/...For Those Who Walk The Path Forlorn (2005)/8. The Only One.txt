All my life Iâve been walking on my own
Not living for tomorrow, but for today
(But) since that time, when I looked into your eyes
Nothing seems to make sense anymore

Iâm closer to heaven
One step away from you
It feels like Iâm burning
Iâm melting away, itâs true

Canât stop the ice from breaking
This heartâs on fire
For ever since I saw you
I knew the reason why

You are the only one
Light on my way

Running wild, wasted days and sleepless nights
Iâm lonely as a man can be on earth
Iâm on my knees, Iâm praying for salvation
No matter where Iâm going, I see your face

Iâm closer to heaven
Still far away from you
Could I be dreaminâ?
Oh no, what I feel is true

Canât stop the ice from breaking
This heartâs on fire
Canât hide the love Iâm feeling
Iâm drowning in your eyes
Hold on, canât you feel it?
Tonightâs the night
For ever since I saw you
I knew the reason why
