Iâm not a sinner, I am not a saint
Just trying to survive this lonely game
Still canât remember any time at all
Of sharing love without and endless fall

Iâm crying, Iâm fighting
But all in vain
Running round in circles

I cry in the rain
Lost and alone again
Calling out your name
I never had a chance
To show how much I care

Nothingâs forever, but one thing still remains
No pleasure without bearing endless pain
Am I the only one whoâs meant to be alone?
Feeling old and cold down to the bone

My crying, my fighting
It was in vain
Running round in circles

I cry in the rain, lost and alone again
Calling out your name, I never had a chance
To show how much I care, facing the truth again
Crying out in vain, I never had a chance
Alone I face the end...
