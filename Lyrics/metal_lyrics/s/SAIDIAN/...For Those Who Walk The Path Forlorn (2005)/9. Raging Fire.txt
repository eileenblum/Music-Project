For this day Iâve been waiting so long
The outbreak is finally here
Thereâs a light at the end of the night
And not one thing left I must fear

They wonât pull me under
I conquer every shore
(Iâm) like a rolling thunder
Canât hold me down no more

Raising the power inside of my mind
Barriers are taken by storm
Leaving the sorrow and sadness behind
Exploding like never before

They wonât pull me under
Iâm shining like the sun
(There) ainât no turning back
Until Iâve won

Raging fire
I see the flames, they burn so high
I rise again to find my paradise

Raging fire
I feel the heat that glows inside
A burning spark brings me to life
(Me to life)

I feel the fire
