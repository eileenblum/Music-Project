Wind's howling, a storm's breaking loose
Lightning cracks the sky
Moonlight's shining, guiding my lonely ride

(A) long distance is lying behind
Long way left to go
Right direction, sometimes is hard to know

[Bridge:]
Still my wheels keep rolling on
All the way tonight
While the road is winding on

[Chorus:]
(I will)
Ride like the wind - on wings of freedom
Fly without sin - into a rising sun

Road's changing, becoming my life
Right before my eyes
Remains and changes - the turning of the tides

Still my faith keeps growing strong
All the way of life
While the fightings going on

Out of the ashes of a million broken dreams
One dream remains for all eternity
I will be one with all the world and with my mind
And 'till this destiny arrives

I will ride like the wind
I will fly without sin
Spread my wings reach the sun
For a golden dawn
