Out in the desert - Building monuments of power
Poor testimonial of their great divinity

It's a reign of indignity - A dominion of lost illusions
All their glory reflected in blood - In the land of the desert sun

Souls - wasted away
Oh - They live and die in blood, sweat, tears and pain

Reign of agony - sacrifice for the Pharaohs kingdom
(Pyramids built of sand and illusions)
Reign of agony - in the land of the desert sun

Tormented souls
Where the ardour swallows cries of pain
Their blood drains into the sand
