I feel it deeper and deeper
Agony in my heart
Oh it's the creep of the creepers
He pulls me into the dark

I - want out! (Please leave me alone!)

Eight hundred years are over
Once I've closed the truce
And sold my soul to the shadows
(For) a nearly endless youth

[Bridge:]
It's wicked - through and through
A pale child guides me into the knife
It's wicked - and hell arrives

[Chorus:]
Nine lives are fading - now I know I was betrayed
Nine times erasing - (and) my soul's the prize to pay

A noise awakes me at night
His servant is here
She opens her empty eyes
(to) show me all my fears

The fallen one has sent his child
A young dead body - she's my guide
Into the abyss I've been sent
Nine lives come to an end
