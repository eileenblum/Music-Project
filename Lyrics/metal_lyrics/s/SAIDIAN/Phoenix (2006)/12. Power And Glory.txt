So here we are my friends back on the road again
We're spinning like a wheel, we're burning like a flame
Bridge: This is the life we lead, this is our destiny
No one will force us to our knees

We're bleeding just like you but when the day is done
No one can stop us, we're a bullet from a gun

[Bridge:]
Release your energy and make your dreams come true
Tonight we're playing just for you

[Chorus:]
With power and Glory we're fighting again
(still) searching for fortune and fame
(With) power and Glory we'll rise once again
Unchain the fire within - power and Glory

From valleys and deserts to mountains and forests
From rivers and lakes to the shores of the sea
We're roaming the whole world, we're serving the nations
Uniting our hearts and our minds to be free
Through tempest and fire, through thunder and lightning
Through earthquakes and hardrain, by storm wind and hail
We're singing our song 'till the message is spreading
"With power and Glory we all shine someday"

Maybe we will be going down fighting
But we'll never give in
