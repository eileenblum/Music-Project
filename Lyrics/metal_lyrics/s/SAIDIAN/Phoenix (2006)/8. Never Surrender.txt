Under a silent moon I raise my weary eyes
Cause I can feel there's something wicked in disguise
I know that fear is just a simple word to spell
But it's so hard to bear my panic I can tell

I've tried so hard to find my way to paradise
'Cause just the brave man is the man who will survive

There is an icecold shiver running down my spine
I will gather up resistance I will hold the line
Waste no time! 'n walk right into the shade
Never surrender! 'Cause I am not afraid

I've tried so hard to find my way to paradise
'Cause just the brave man is the man who will survive
Refrain Never surrender! (Never say die!)
Giving all you got inside
Never surrender! (Never say die!)
Let your spirit force arise (Never surrender!)

My blood is boiling while my skin is cold as ice
The time has come I can hear them roll the dice
It sounds like thunder in the middle of the night
Face my darkest hour in my final fight
