Your words disgust me (always distrust me) [4x]
We are here to conquer and take over this profound, culture customs
Bring this to our world
In the light of the seventh star
We will learn your ways
in the light of the seventh star
we will end your days
landing ships beyond these peaks and turning this land desolate
prelate congregation
bleeding this world dry
celestial beings run this world in secret [2x]
landing ships beyond these peaks and turning this land desolate
standing in this subtle trance, turning these pages
deprivation from this resource holding to your own
seek and destroy [2x]
Sumerians [4x] (thrive)
landing ships beyond these peaks and turning this land desolate
standing in this subtle trance, turning these pages
deprivation from this resource holding to your own
this will be war [2x]
they take me
take me away
they notice me [4x]
