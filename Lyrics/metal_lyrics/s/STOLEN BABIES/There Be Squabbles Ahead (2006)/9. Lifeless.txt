I can see the lifeless, I can feel the darkness under you
I can see behind me
I can try to hide it but without a will to see the truth
I can feel a heartbeat slowing to nothing
Why don't I go when I know there's nothing I should want here?
Why do I stay when I know there's nothing I should say?
As I stand behind you, lost in all the things that I would do
Never really with you, quietly halfway in the room
Do you see behind you, do you see behind you?
Why don't I go tell me why do I stay when I know there's nothing I should want here?
Why don't I go tell me why do I stay when there's nothing you can see?
Why don't I go tell me why do I stay when I know there's nothing I should say?
Why don't I go tell me why do I stay when I know there's nothing for me here?
How I see you now is all wrong
With my hands full and it's all wrong
And I shouldn't have looked 'cause now I can't look away

[Chorus]
