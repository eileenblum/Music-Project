Even in buildings and still alleys, there is a sneaking threat breaking in
A little like fog, a little like heat, too much like an invasion of safety
(Breaking in) I don't know why the dogs are barking
(Breaking in) Or why the gate is shaking
(Breaking in) It's not just the roof settling
(Breaking in) What is it that has followed me?
I really do wish you had minded your eyes
And now a chain has been set off that can't be wound back up
And late in the night there's a clanking and clanging of sounds
Way too loud outside
Eyes perpendicular to the ground
Pulling the corners down even more
When they moved from top to bottom
A cringe came to catch up with me later on
(Take it back) When my feet run the things I say
(Take it back) Retreating back to what is safe
(Take it back) A self protection policy
(Take it back) In spite of all that it still has followed me
I really do wish you had minded your eyes
And now a chain has been set off that can't be wound back up
And late in the night there's a clanking and clanging of sounds
Way too loud outside
Black face and white wool...I'm counting but it doesn't help
And if you had just minded your eyes
I wouldn't be so wound up as I'm winding down
And on my shelves all my trinkets
Shoved aside for what's way too loud outside

The streets growing out strings
Tugging the line, subtracting the winks
Following something I'm hearing
Doors will scare me, windows leave me blind
On the tips of my toes
(Following) Trailing the tracks between the grey and glistening
(Following) A changing face loses shape
What is it that I'm following?
