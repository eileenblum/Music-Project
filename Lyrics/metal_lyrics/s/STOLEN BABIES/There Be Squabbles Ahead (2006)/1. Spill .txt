Do not!
Do NOT spill the water when you're drinking it
Through your mouth
What happened here, nobody can say but it hasn't been the same
Our lips are pressed to the ground

Running with a cup
Thrown off!
An experiment gone wrong
All of a sudden under us
The drains in the street
Bubbling up....

Do not!
Do NOT spill the water when you're drinking it
Through your mouth
We're so desperate now
Look at us sucking up mud and blood
With our lips pressed to the ground

When they came to us no one thought
Such genius could have gone wrong
Never questioning until we saw
The drains in the street bubbling up...

Do not!
Do NOT spill the water when you're drinking it
Through your mouth
What happened here, nobody can say but it hasn't been the same
Our lips are pressed to the ground

Whose idea was this?

All the kids have random stains on their skin
If they scratch at all, their fingers dig into their flesh
Whose idea was this?

Do not...
