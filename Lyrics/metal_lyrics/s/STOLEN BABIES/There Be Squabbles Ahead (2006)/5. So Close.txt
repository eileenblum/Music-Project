At their worst, their stares are a killing force
I go out of my way to avoid
I fall, fall, fall and stop
Stop at you, at where I don't go
Stop at you, at where I don't go
I'll follow you into there....

Stay back and wait for the attack, way back
They want you to retract

Oh you're so close, oh you don't know about it
No you don't know, oh we're so slow about it

All of the same here, more of the same here
(I'll follow you into there)
Just what I run from (you've made me)
Something like them (you make me)
But I'll follow you anyway
