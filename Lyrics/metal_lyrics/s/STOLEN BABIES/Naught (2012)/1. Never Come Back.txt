[R. Sharone, D.L. Persi]

Is this a mirror, water, or distant mirage?

In the tight room, such a slick maw
No one can keep up, spinning it too far
But does it feel good?
Like the sweetest air
To run with fibs, and make them care

And it's a big room, flooded with starry eyes
And I could leave with a smile
If I could never come back

With your lights, leave us alone
It's blinding, leave us alone

It's outline like a mountain, carved out like a thug
It's mouth, a storm, a show, a trap!

Calling out to the falling rocks
We can make them stop before they get to us
Sorry if no one comes around,
They've gone fishing in a mound of forged evidence
(I thought I told you to never come back around here.
I told you to never come back)

With your lights, leave us alone
It's blinding, leave us alone

It's mouth a storm, a show, but nothing but a trap
"What? You're still here? Go away."

With your lights, leave us alone
It's blinding, leave us alone

Is this a mirror, water, or distant mirage?
I thought I told you to never come, never come, never come back
