We started out as little kids believing things were hidden
Straight surfaces no cracks beneath
I wanted to believe it

We realize at the time there isn't much of a burn
Wait 'til your turn

Don't try to fool yourself
You're sweating all around your smile
Under civil disguise
Those senses were a human voice

There is another side to all this pressure under your suit
Here on the losing end look at them based on how they looked at you
Such a slave on this chain until the day we are done
Isn't it fun?

Don't try to fool yourself
You're sweating all around your smile
Under civil disguise
Those senses were a human voice

You will find that the fly's based on nothing
Just a way to hide from the fear
You kept avoiding

Don't try to fool yourself
Under civil disguise

Put out my hands to the delusion
When I look at you I'm a fool
I've got one too
I try to fool myself
By wasting time at this fork in the road
Under civil disguise
Those senses were a human voice
