Making money off their stupidity
Making them fall to the ground on down on their knees

They glorify, deify, and follow me
An image with a smile is all it takes
They glorify, deify, and follow me
I'm as ruthless as I am fake

They can't see, I'm lying through my teeth
So easily, I lie right through my teeth

I suppose I'm a parasite
I feed off attention
I have an insatiable need for power, fame, and adulation 

They glorify, deify, and follow me
An image with a smile is all it takes
They glorify, deify, and follow me
I'm as ruthless as I am fake

They can't see, I'm lying through my teeth
So easily, I lie right through my teeth

If it weren't for the weak-minded I'd have no authority
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing that they're blindly following

(Still I remain a most malevolent fiend, leading
all the brain washed fools with their heard mentality)
(can't they see, I'm lying through my teeth?)
(so easy to deceive, I'm lying through my teeth)

They can't see, I'm lying through my teeth
So easily, I lie right through my teeth

Glorify, deify, follow!
