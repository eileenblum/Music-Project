Your ship is sinking, the lights are blinking
And I am watching as you drown
Your ship is sinking, and you're obsessing
The lights are blinking
You are going down
Keep asking why the boards have broke
As every scream will only choke
So many words, it doesn't move
As you're struggling to breathe, you realize....

The ship is sinking, ship is sinking
Ship is sinking, the ship is sinking

You had a warning
You kept ignoring
And now you're drowning
You are drowning

Lightning and tears
The boards have broke
And every scream has only choked
Now as your lungs take in the cold
The fading of your life is the only thing you cannot control

The ship is sinking, ship is sinking
Ship is sinking, the ship is sinking
Ship is sinking
Your ship is sinking, your ship is sinking....
