Entrance to hell is right outside my window
I stay in, it's no better inside
It's such a mess in here, filthy, unlivable
I try to breath in here, 
then I take a step onto the floor and make it outside

And it's cold and ugly under the pipes and
nobody gets where it's safe
I fell into the moat where it's dirty and dry
And nothing is looking the same

Entrance to hell is right outside my window
I stay in, it's no better inside

Before you came to me it was easy to hide
And in my hour of need, when it all blew up, you
made your cut and left it to bleed

[Chorus]

But no one ever gets outside without losing part of their life
I'm not across, but at least I'm out
No bridge in sight
And nobody gets where it's safe

I am stuck in here in the dried moat
The dogs stuck here with their bones
I am stuck in here in the dried moat
It's all clogged here with their bones
[Chorus]

No one ever gets outside without losing part of their life
