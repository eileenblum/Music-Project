Behind the door, a struggled breath will come
Beat them, those eyes
Beat you if you try
(Moving on the other side)
Beat you if you try

Out went the days when the diamonds showed light
(Your paranoia's your friend)
It's the wind... from them
(It's the wind)

Destroy the days the heart won't slow down
Wave them goodbye
Beat them if you try
