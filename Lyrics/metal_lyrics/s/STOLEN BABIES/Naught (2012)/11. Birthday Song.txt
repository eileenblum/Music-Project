On your birthday you went to play and get away 
it's a day late
HappyBirthday, HappyBirthday
HappyBirthday, HappyBirthday
When the round dogs' breath smell like bogs try a biscuit blow on candles
HappyBirthday, HappyBirthday
HappyBirthday, HappyBirthday
Happy Happy Happy Happy...
Happy
You're the paper in the scissors 
Take your trinket
Close the blanket
Happy Birthday
Happy
