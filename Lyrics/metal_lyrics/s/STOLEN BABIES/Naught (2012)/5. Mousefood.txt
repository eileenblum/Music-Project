The sun is gone (the mouse closes his eyes)
The trail is shiny (leading up to the prize)
We take what we can (take what we can)
We will take it all

The roots are buried underground
We will not starve before the mouse

Somebody said (never take the whole thing)
But greed is mighty (we can take the whole thing)
And since we're down here (since we're down here)
We will take it all
We're far beneath the flowers
The gatherers and hunters

The instinct to take everything
Why not stay down here
And watch him starve

We won't leave it but he don't want it
(none for the mouse)

Climb down
When he wakes he will find
Nothing for him, nothing for the mouse
One dies, one prospers, we play

Mourn the mouse

We leak into the whole
(hair will poison your cache like a cavity)
Winner takes hoards
Shove it down.
