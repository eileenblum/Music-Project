I know the trap
I've always avoided it
But when the star fell in the desert, I fell down as well
It kept me in the sand
The asphalt laid a plan and helpless to the draw
that pulled me in and kept me down

Down in the swimming hole, it smells like alcohol
and all the things I couldn't see that night are killing me
Down in the swimming hole, it smells like alcohol
and all the things you did, I'll never know

The sky deceives, it gives, it burns until you learn as well
If you sew yourself to the clouds, you'll live
And maybe, you'll wipe the grins from your eyes

Down the swimming hole, it smells like alcohol
And all the things I think when I am weak are killing me

Lie, dissolve, its less than low
This time I sell my soul
Less starts to show
This vicious side
This torch is in my jaw

Down in the swimming hole, it smells like alcohol
and all the things I couldn't see that night are killing me
Killing me
