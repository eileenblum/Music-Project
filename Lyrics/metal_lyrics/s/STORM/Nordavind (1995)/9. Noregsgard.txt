Ein dugal kar fra garden dro
Han fulgte furuas sus
Opp gjennom Ã¥sen grÃ¥stein han bar
Staut hans gange var

SvÃ¸pt i morgengry
Under ein helnorsk himmel
Hans fÃ¸tter traurig vandres hen
Mot sitt mÃ¥l opp pÃ¥ hÃ¸yden

Ein vÃ¦rbitt hand griper sverdet fatt
Og klÃ¸yver den blÃ¥nende skalle
Hans kjeft den vrir seg i ulmende hat
Ufrender kommer at falle

SÃ¥ stod han der pÃ¥ utkikkstopp
Hans Ã¸yne ei dei kviler
For han sÃ¸kte reint eit syn
Men det ble ein grusom pine

Der blant norges skog og mark
Var fienden og fÃ¦l
Hans grimme sinn skulle vise dem
At norsÃ¸nn han har nok at tÃ¦l

Ein vÃ¦rbitt hand griper sverdet fatt
Og klÃ¸yver den blÃ¥nende skalle
Hans kjeft den vrir seg i ulmende hat
Ufrender kommer at falle

NorsÃ¸nn tapte noregsgard
For ein Â«ansikt iÂ» hÃ¦r
Stolt han var dan han kom igjen
For Ã¥ klÃ¸yve denne sitt sverd

[English translation:]

Norway's Home

A strong guy from the farm went
He followed pine and breeze
Up through the hills, greystone and wilderness
Bold his steps was

Swathed in twilight
Under a completely norwegian sky
His feet steadily wandered
Towards their goal and upon heights

A weatherbitten hand clutches the sword
And cleaves the bluemen's heads
His mouth twist in smoldering hate
Unpeace will fall

Then he stood there on the look-out top
His eyes couldn't rest
Because he sought a pure sight
But it became a cruel pain

There in the midst of norwegian forest and wilderness
The enemy was cruel and dreadful
His grim mind should show them
That a son of the north has lots of guts

A weatherbitten hand clutches the sword
And cleaves the bluemen's heads
His mouth twist in smoldering hate
Unpeace will fall

The son of the north lost Norway's home
To a face of an army
Proud he was when he returned
To cleave them with his sword
