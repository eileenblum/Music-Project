[Nordmannen]

Mellom bakkar og berg ut med havet
Heve nordmannen fenge sin heim
Der han sjÃ¸lv heve tuftene grave
Og sett sjÃ¸lv sine hus oppÃ¥ deim

Han sÃ¥g ut pÃ¥ dei steinute strender
Det var ingen, som der hadde bygt
Lat oss rydja og byggja oss grender
Og so eiga me rudningen trygt

Han sÃ¥g ut pÃ¥ det bÃ¥rute havet
Det var ruskut Ã¥ leggja utpÃ¥
Men det leikade fisk med i kavet
Og den leiken den ville han sjÃ¥

Hill nordmann

Fram pÃ¥ vinteren stundom han tenkte
Gjev eg var her til evig tid
Og nÃ¥r nordljoset skinner i frÃ¥ oven
Blir hans stÃ¥lhjerte fylt med grusom savn

[Between Hills And Mountains (translation)]

Between hills and mountains out by the sea
The norseman have found his home
Where he himself have digged the foundations
And himself has placed his houses upon them

He stared out on the stone-covered shores
There was noone, who there had built
Let us clear a place and build farms
And then we will safely own the clearing

He stared out at the waves on the sea
It was rough to embark out there
But fish played down in the bustle
And that playing he wanted to see

Hail norseman

In the winter he seldom thought
If only I were here forever
And when the northern lights shines from above
His steelheart is filled with grusome longing

[English translation:]

Amid Hills And Mountains

Amid hills and mountains by the sea
The Norwegian has found his home
Where he himself has dug the foundations
And placed his houses upon them himself.

He looked at the stony shores;
There was no one who had built there before.
"Let us clear the land and build villages,
And then we will safely own the clearing."

He looked at the rough sea;
It was tough to set out there;
But fishes were playing down in the (water) flurry,
And that playing he wanted to see.

Hail Norwegian!

In the winter he sometimes thought;
If only I were here for ever!
And when the northern lights shine from above
His steely heart is filled with terrible nostalgia.
