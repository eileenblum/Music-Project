Lay down listen carefully now my son
Let me sing you a lullaby of blood
Sacred the flames tight to our chests
Engulf our bodies with the holy flare 

Bow to your god kneel before death wrists wide open 
Swallowed by fire destroy your brother 
Cut throat spill the blood of your own son
Grasp the blade that makes you a man
Culture of violence culture of violence
Sacred the flames tight to our chests
Engulf our bodies with the holy flare
Bow down
