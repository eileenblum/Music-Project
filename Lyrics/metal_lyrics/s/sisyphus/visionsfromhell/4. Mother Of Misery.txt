Die let your children die
Let them burn in the fields of hunger
Starve their souls with lies
A world of men who laugh
Mother of misery offer your own flesh

The dead walk this earth
With giant steps horror is among us
A horse that rides the world
The mother of all tombs
Mother of all tombs make me your god
