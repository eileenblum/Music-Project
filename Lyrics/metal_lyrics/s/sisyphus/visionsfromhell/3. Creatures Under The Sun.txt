Hell isn't dark itâs bright as the sun
It comes for us in broad-light from above the skies to burn
Human existence fading away glory to ashes now
Carve our blood into the ground
Crushing and killing our will to be humans butchering our hearts with despair
Tempting the giants from the sacred sky calling the vultures to come

Dignity failed giving us a place for hope
Fear the calm thatâs when our god will come
The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood
And when the drains finally scab over all the vermin will drown

The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists
And all the whores and politicians will look up and shout "save us!"
Iâll look down and Iâll whisper No
