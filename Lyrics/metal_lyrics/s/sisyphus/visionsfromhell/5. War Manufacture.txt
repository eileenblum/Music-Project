Rape the earth to feed the steel
An endless river of blood will crown our kings
Lonesome affair of fury and blood streams of sorrow
My fingers cannot feel the earth
The grinding mind of war has pierced my head
Sick womb pile up our bodies
Burnt men feed the hunger of a breathing breeding death machine
