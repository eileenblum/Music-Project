[Lyrics by: Luis GoulÃ£o]

Once i had it all
Now i have nothing
Just memories
Of a life i used ot have

When death claims a life
All that's left is memories
Everyone i loved is dead

[Chorus]
Paradise or hell
Are the bloody answers
To enlighten all the darkness
What dreams may come

The pain is too much to bare
There's no more "together"
Still i'm real, still i exist
I am forever

I didn't get the chance to say goodbye
I remember the silence
Never let me go

I will never dream again
It's not fare not dreaming
Never again

[Chorus]
Paradise or hell
Are the bloody answers
To enlighten all the darkness
What dreams may come
