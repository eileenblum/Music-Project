[Lyrics by: Luis GoulÃ£o]

I`d like as a phoenix
To rise from out of the flames
And spread my wings again
Over the whispering waves
And before them fall in a noose dive
Against their will and rage
Again and again

I must quench my thurst
And follow the voice that calls me
Inside my head
To feel their weakness invading my thoughts
And thus plain again
Over and over again

I feel the fire burnin' my wings
I fell the rage within the wind
A voice whispers inside my mind
Whispering moarns of a darken kind
I am immortal, i shall never die
My mind is flame, my body is sky
i feel the fire burnin' my wings
I fell the rage within the wind
A voice whispers inside my mind
Whispering moarns of a darken kind
I am immortal, i shall never die
My mind is flame, my body is sky

[Chorus]
Drifting in search of a way
I fly to a new brand day
Drifting, in search i fly
Unto the depths of a new sky
