[Music by: Luis GoulÃ£o and Shadowsphere]
[Lyrics by: Luis GoulÃ£o]

Just what i want to see
Violence is now reality
Come and collect it free

Things are different than before
Extreme aggression `till nevermore
Anarchy and poverty

Corrupt fake potency
Forced legal amnesty
Ecstasy of dignity
No future, no destiny

Murder, death, lunacy
All done so legally
Murder, death, lunacy
Explain reality again to me!

Violence, greed, insanity
Non-sense, bleed, reality
All of this done... to you and me!
