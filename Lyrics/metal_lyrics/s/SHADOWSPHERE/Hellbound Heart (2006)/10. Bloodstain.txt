Red is the colour of your life
Red is the famine of your device
Unleash the power of your might
Curse the nature of your sight
Twisted eyes on your back
Darkness here will not forget
Weak shadows are your prey
Blessed the vision of your decay
Fragile dreams in a starless night
Moving shadows and living fright
Decadence of the soulless beast
Murdered innocence
In a blood full feast
No more you will suffer
No more you will hunt
Just one more killing to the bill
Just one more scent of the cunt
Red is the colour of your life
Red is the famine of your device
Flesh and blood are to be brand
Of a cold hearted bloodstained
