Once again forsaken
Just another body to the pit
I'm not the one to blame for
I shall not bare another trick
My grave is shallow and cold
One more time left behind to die
For what you did still burns in me
Shamed my flesh for not trying... deliverance
I'm not alone anymore
Your prey are all together with me
Just waiting for a chance
For a chance of haunting thee
All the malice in the world
Cannot save you now
We're here to stay and wait
For your soul somehow... burn
What you did still burns in me (you cannot see)
Who you kill you cannot see (still burns in me)
Visions of a rotten thrill (wicked will burn this world)
Done by the forsaken will
One more time left behind to die
Shamed my flesh for not trying
Once again forsaken
Just another body to the pit
For what you did still burns in me..
