A dream was crushed
The pride was taken away
Forsaken hours of pain
For those feelings that remain
Someone always watching
Left in oblivion
A commitment to decadence
Shameless options dug my grave
I kept wondering
Throughout the forbidden path
My eyes were blind to see
The beasts surrounding me
Carnal pleasure lust my own decay
My dreams were shattered
And I forced to kneel
As the beasts await to devour my thrill
And then the soul broke into tears
Its tears turn into blood
The blood became body
Therefor I am reborn
I am master and slave
Only spinning godwheel
