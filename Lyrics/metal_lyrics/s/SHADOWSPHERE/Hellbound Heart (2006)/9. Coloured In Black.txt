Can't you see?what I feel in my
Darkest dreams that I live inside
My mind is full of lies my soul is my disguise
In my thoughts you will see darkness
Seek before you get blind cause I
Want you dead and six feet under
Trapped in a roar of thunder
Death will take you soon
Misery defines your past
The game has just began
This is real life not a test
Creepy words with dust
Hiding from the light of the sun
Persuaded minds
Are under pressure by the gun
All in my head is coloured black
Savage feelings of an infected past
Fall into the abyss of death
My conscience my breath
Fall into the abyss of death
