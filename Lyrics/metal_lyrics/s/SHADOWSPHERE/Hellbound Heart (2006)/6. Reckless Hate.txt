Your soul breeds corrosion
Cause and conflict to your death
Learn to suffer for your sins
Enlight the darkness always grim
I breed hate you taste fear
The kind that rips your soul
And then my senses stop
But the feelings are too strong
I breathe my hate you taste mt hate
Pay for your sins I'll rip your soul
Speak no more lies
Cast no more your poisonous tongue
False faith or true deceit
Endless ways for you to greet
I breathe my hate you taste my hate
Pay for your sins I'll rip your soul
It shreds my heart and eat my soul
It shreds my heart and eat my soul
The reckless hate will bring you cold
And I'll be cursed to walk alone
My reckless hate is far to strong
The torturous ways of life
Has led you to your demise
A sadfull way to terminate
Your life a trophy of my hate
