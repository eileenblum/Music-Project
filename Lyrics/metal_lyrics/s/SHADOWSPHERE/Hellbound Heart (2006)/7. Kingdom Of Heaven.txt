Like the eden symbolic paradise
Theology's the oldest lie
Devil in disguise
Fire throughout the sky
Religion mother of delusion
Goddess of all false truth
Ready to believe fast to condemn
Mistress of believe untrue
Always a dogma silent scorn
Born from the roots of time
All false scriptures written to delude
Through visions of divinity
That feeds without food
Monopoly of god taken
Resurrection awaken
Anathema a masterpiece
The price for celestial bliss
To grieve impious
A reign covered by mysticism
Always a dogma silent scorn
Born from the roots of time
All false scriptures written to delude
Through visions of divinity
Believe in me and I'll make it real
I'll put your sins upon my thrill
Born of an image born of a fraud
Born in the temple of god
Religion mother of delusion
Goddess of all false truth
Ready to believe fast to condemn
Mistress of belief untrue
