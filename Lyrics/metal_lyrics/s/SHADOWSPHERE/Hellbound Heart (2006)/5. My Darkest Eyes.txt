All of us feel pain inside
All of us taught of suicide
As seasons turn to dark I feel no
More the chill of fright
Hungry is the seed of might
That hunts thy power almight
Two voices one kind
In the dark side of mind

Dead eyes don't see
My pain is less than real
Dead hearts don't feel
No more I wanna feel
Pain saw through my darkest eyes
My shift in hell in earth is genocide
Cursed I am to believe
But still I reign to conceive
I hear now the choir of souls
Anthems of salvation for the heretic
No light to follow nor grave to lie
Just the path for ruin by my side
