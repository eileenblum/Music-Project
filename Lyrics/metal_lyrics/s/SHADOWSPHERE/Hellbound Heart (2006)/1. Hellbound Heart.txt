I cast demons to myself and
Leave the angels to the weak
God and devil are the same
That's what makes it taste so sweet

I have this thing with devils
They'd love to kill me
I love to mess with them
And I have this thing with angels too
They mess with me and I love
To hunt their holy crew

I'm only dead until dark
Without fear I cannot start
Holy evil torn apart
Hellbound hellbound heart

My hungry heart cannot forget
All the pain my flesh as tasted
But my wounds no longer hurt
Like the devil I found my place
Like the devil I found my place
The same evil face to face

I'm only dead until dark
Without fear I cannot start
Holy evil torn apart
Hellbound hellbound heart

Hell with no name doesn't hurt
It just makes my deeds look dirt
Holy evil torn apart
Hellbound hellbound heart
My hungry heart cannot forget
All the pain my flesh as tasted
But my wounds no longer hurt
Like the devil I found my place
The same evil face to face
I'm only dead until dark
Hellbound heart

Without fear I cannot start
Holy evil torn apart
Hellbound hellbound heart
Hell with no name doesn't hurt
It just makes my deeds look dirt
Holy evil torn apart
Hellbound hellbound heart
