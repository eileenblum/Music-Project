Passion for flesh imminent trip
Requiem for you
Nightmare without sleep
Dead skin poundered
An end without end
Touch me feel me
Please take my hand
No hope for you my friend
Tonight we'll be one under my red skies
Slow and painful memories still alive
Through emotional strain
Into death you will dive
Death takes control
Fast as a killing hold
No hope for you my friend

I've always dreamt of my red skies
The kind of blood that fills my heart
In which I lay forever in
I've always dreamt of my red skies
The kind of blood that fills my heart
Through whom I'll breed forever

Serene and sadistic
My will to grip with pain
The lifeless object of my thrill
No pain no gain
