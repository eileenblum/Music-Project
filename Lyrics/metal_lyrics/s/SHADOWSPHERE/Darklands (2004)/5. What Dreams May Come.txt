[Lyrics by: Luis GoulÃ£o]

Once I had it all
Now I have just nothing
Only memories
Of a life I used to have

When death claims a life
All that's left is the memories
everyone I loved is dead

[Chorus]
Paradise or hell
Are the bloody answers
To enlighten all the darkness
What dreams may come

The pain is too much for me to bare
There's no more "together"
Still I'm real, still I exist
I am forever

I didn't get the chance to say goodbye
I remember the silence
Never let me go

I will never dream again
It's not fair not dreaming
Never again

[Chorus]
