[Lyrics by: Luis GoulÃ£o]

In the gathering dark
Stranger faces drift along
To destroy centuries of hate

I am Evil, look what your God has made of me
Inside these walls, they could not bare
That I am the Beast!

Look what your God has made of me
She will be mine forever
And all is lost for you

She has drunk my blood
I'm hers too, I won!
Nothing can stop me now
And she will come with me

[Chorus]
Carfax in flames
I'll have my revenge
Carfax in flames
Look what your God has made of me

Die, die, lambs of God
I laugh as you eternally rot
Burn, burn, the fires of God
The ones who breed false faith and true belief!

Master of Hell, give me your guidance
I shall kill all the Christians, take their souls
And be victorious!

[Chorus]
