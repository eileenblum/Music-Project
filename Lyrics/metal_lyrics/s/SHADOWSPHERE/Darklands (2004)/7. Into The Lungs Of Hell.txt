[Lyrics by: Luis GoulÃ£o]

Once upon a time in a land, in a land forgotten by time
Lived the Great Dragon, the enemy of Christ
Nor devil neither a man was greater than Atilla
Whose blood still flows in his veins...

A place where all life seemed to have faded away
And evil is the ruler of all death
Jonathan had arrived to the quest of his life
Between wolves and blood and the whores of Christ

Listen to them
The children of the night
What sweet music they make

[Chorus]
I bid you welcome to my house
Enter at your own will
And leave some of your happiness behind

A place where all life seemed to have faded away
And evil is the ruler of all death

"Dracula is keeping me here
Draining my blood, feeding my fear
The wolves chasing the blue inferno
I am now a prisoner"

Listen to them
The children of the night
What sweet music they make

[Chorus]
