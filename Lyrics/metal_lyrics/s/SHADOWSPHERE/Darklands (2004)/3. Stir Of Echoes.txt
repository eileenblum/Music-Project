[Lyrics by: Luis GoulÃ£o]

I see a thousand faces
A thousand eyes, a thousand places
Just waiting for me, just dying for me

The thousand eyes are staring at me
In the thousand places where I've been
In my dreams they are real, here is for real

Now!
She speaks to me
I feel her pain deep
Inside my mind
She touches my soul
Always knowing what
I didn't know
I can feel Death Below
Inside these walls

She is inside my mind
Telling me to search for her body
To feel her cry between the shades of despair
How does it feel to be raped in your inner self?
To be touched inside
To feel the cold touch of death

Finally she can be set free from all of this agony
She may now walk into eternity
Her soul may now rest in peace
And as I have myself again,
I can see her waving to me and saying
Goodbye...
