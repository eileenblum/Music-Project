[Lyrics by: Luis GoulÃ£o]

Listen to me crowd of greediness
I`ll return from beyond to h(a)unt you
I am king-god of darkness
And I'll walk the earth again

I rule the earth,
I rule the sky
I rule high and above

I am sun, I am rain
I am all curses
I am plague

The eyes of the night are watching me
As the creatures kneel before my shadow
The Nile and the moon are one in the night
Eternal damnation

I rule the earth
I rule the sky
I rule high and above

I am sun, I am rain
I am all curses
I am plague

Amongst the ruins lies a secret
A curse so strong throughout eternity
Never touch the pharaoh's relics
Violate is a meaning for hate
Leaving behind the gates of dawn
Transcending with an immortal soul

His name shall not be spoken
Not once, never again
The scorn, his flesh
Are one with damnation!
