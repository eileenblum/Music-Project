[Lyrics by: Luis GoulÃ£o]

Between memories of ancient joys
And casting demons of all past lives
He cries out for God
The one who had forsaken him ages ago

The sunset in darkness and evil
Arise from his hideout
The hunters ride on to the final attack

Two enter the castle
Only one will come out
Between memories of ancient joys
He cries for forgiveness

The sunset in darkness and evil
Arise from his hideout
The hunters ride on to the final attack

Damnation is about to begin!

[Chorus]
Dracula has finally strike
And Mina reached out for him
In pain, dying,
With blood flowing out of his body

The once devil is again a man
His love is stronger than death
He is now dead but dreaming
On how love never dies

It is finished
Where once was darkness, there's light again
And there in the presence of God
Love released all the powers of Darkness

The sunsets in darkness and evil
Arise from his hideout
The hunters ride on to the final attack
Damnation is about to begin

[Chorus]

The once Devil is again a man
His love is stronger than death
He is now dead but dreaming
On how love never dies...
