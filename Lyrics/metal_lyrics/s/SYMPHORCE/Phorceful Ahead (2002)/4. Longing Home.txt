I swear there's something inside
I hear, its fightnin to stay alive
Star with the lying
Here's no denying

How could i be so blind?
It was always there... inside
The purpose fading
It keeps me waiting

Hiding wounds won't ease the pain
Sleep won't make you whole again
Let the rain wash that pain away...
Longing home, lost and led astray
I have only million years to give
But at last... i live
Bled for our creed
Why must we still bleed?
I alwas took it for granted
I never valued the drops i shed
I failed to see the relation
Between my self and starvation
