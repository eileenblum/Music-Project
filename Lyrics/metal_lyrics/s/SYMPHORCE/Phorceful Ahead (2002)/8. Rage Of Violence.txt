I know the darkness blinds you can you see without your eyes
If you take one step closer, can you speak without lies

You make the sound of laughter, burn my knees and pray
All sharepened nails seem softer, as you walk away

I know there's something inside taht you would never believe
I wish i was able to finally rule your dream

Holdin' my hate against you
You'll never keep my breath
I drink the rain
Open my wounds to heal the pain

Discard the old in with the new
And throw it all away
I've no respect for you
To handle every day

What i hear... is this the wall of silence
But i'm coming in
What i know... is this my rage of violence
I love the pain

It doesn't matter what i let them learn or do
From everyone i learned a thing or two

To give you thanks for all the suffering you command
To meet you for the chance to shake your hand

Discard the old in with the new
Make room for me to prey
No, no more respect for you
Remember today
