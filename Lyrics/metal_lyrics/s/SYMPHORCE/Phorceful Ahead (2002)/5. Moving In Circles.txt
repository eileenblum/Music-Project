For those who came to play and know the game
For those who called my name, for those who feel the pain

My right from left, my high from low
I ran out, i rub my eyes, and i don't konw

All the things i've done wrong
After all the pain is gone

You can't deny the fact that all the things have changed
Can you tell the thruth, now everything seems strange

I tried to live, i tried to stand, i've tried to cry
I look to pray, my felleings won't go away

I found myself in disrepair
I went to find myself was there

Movin in circles
As night dissolves to day
Movin in circles
Silent darness slowly kills me.
