As i walk through the ashes
I whisper your name
As your soul is torn apart
A beating of your heart

Into the depths of no return
Do what no-one has done
All my dreams i shared for you
How i wish they could come true

Do you hear me calling now
Another day unfolds, the rains are cold,
Do you try to hide it somehow...
Whe i close my eyes i'll see inside
.. speak my mind

Lookin' for a way to stay,
Stay away from my thoughts
The hunger in my stare
As i feed upon your fear
