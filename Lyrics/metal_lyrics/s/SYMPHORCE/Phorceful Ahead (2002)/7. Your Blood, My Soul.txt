In the dust of past mistakes
Of tears and cold heartaches
Cold skin clings to my face,
Spend my days without a trace

If i shed my blood in vain
Could i rest forever,
Should i lay my soul to waste?
Just a wait til your days are done,
Work your fingers to the bone

You gave your blood, i gave my soul
You taste your pain for every stain
See from within, truth or lie
Be where i've been and life before i die
Of foreever burning hate
By the torment you create
Future show chaos reigns
Iron will hope and change
World without end
Sleep without dreams
Common man whole again
Final change hand in hand
