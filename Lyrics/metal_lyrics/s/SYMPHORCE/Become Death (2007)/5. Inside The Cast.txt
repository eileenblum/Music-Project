There's no need to be so frightened
Of those wicked games we play
Unable to find a stand or grip
As you still go astray
All you see are pictures of rape
All the hopes are passing your mind
You try to stay awake
One minute to run, ten seconds to take
Rise to the place for what it takes
Open up the doors, find what awaits
Haunting for soul, will you die at last
Forever you dwell inside the cast
Tumblin' walls no shadows near
No one inside, can betray your fears
Ask yourself what's the purpose of life
Step back from where you started ... to become alive
