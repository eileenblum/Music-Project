How many times have I been told
But now the stabbing pain covers my soul
The point of return has yet been burned
And reflects the anger and takes it's hold
Drowning in seas of sorrow
I'm on my way, so hollow
You hear me screaming out your name
I repent from my sin and see me falling down again
Set me free, I'm condemned
At dusk you fall asleep and I awake
I begin to leave but your soul I'll take
The darkest path will lead you astray
You fear the soil drifts, don't get lost along the way
I've been drowning my sorrow for lone
And crawl up on your crucifix until I'm strong
My constant struggling, my self defence
The worth of life, my last chance
In times of despair still no one really cares
