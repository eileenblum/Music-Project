After the war is gone
You only seal the one
I hide all my secrets in
And everything I've ever seen
You speak the truth but I pass you by
Cause you can't take away my soul
And you will never understand the pain
Will you ever hold the fire and close the eyes
Turn around and I take you to the ground
'Cause I'm lost but found
They forced me to stand tall
Right behind the wall
But soon the walls are closing in
Fear what tomorrow brings
All that I've ever seen
Got lost in my memory
