Oh, you think you know all about it
You try to hide without it
The brightest sun did burn you blind
Where darkness dies, there's nothin' to find
All I do is summon you name
You hear my words, you're trapped in my game
As it runs right through my hands
When we're old maybe we'll understand
Because of what we are, this is a high price to pay
How can I deny my fears for being led astray
I hide the truth to find my way
And wearing someone else's face
I turn away but I can't hide
I'm caught inside a world of lies
Don't you go and you will see
Eyes forever closed, find your reality
If all seems lost and you can't find
You keep things in the ruins of my mind
