All of the pain is ending now
I'm here with both feet on the ground
This will only drag me down
When silence is falling, so quiet no sound
I can't remember what to do
I can't stop comin' after you
Walking on the trail of tears
There's something that I can't forget
I'm facing now my darkest fears
No one leaves tonight
I'm heading towards the light
You hear the words but now you're gone
When everything's said and done
I'm trapped inside my own philosophy
And tried to become a man of dignity
So now you quest all the tears you shed
And cast aside to born the dead
