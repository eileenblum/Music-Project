You keep your sorrow
You travelled far and wide
Visions appear but cast aside
Locked in the heart of your soul
Trapped inside the cold
As you can feel the hollow
I can reach the cold
All my memories have died in the hopes of a dream
As this unknown feeling is surrounding me
Against my belief
You're crawling up my spine
In a man dimension of time
The spark to flame inside
Like shadows in your mind
To keep myself away from you
Where I belong to tell me the truth
For a moment in time, my soul got torn apart
Still no one knows, you seal the pain in my heart
