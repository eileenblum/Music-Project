Want try because I'm out of tears
You think twice but I try to deny my fears
For the memory and the faith
Qhile dreams appear and for devotion you wait
I hear you cry and curse the sky
I hear you cry
Watching you die
When I feel your cold embrace
I hear you cry, still I stir my veil
I hear you cry
As I see you fly
It's all across your face
All my laughter is hidden inside
But the picture's still locked in my mind
There's no excuse, I ignore the pain
Bury my hopes, but I'll try again
