It's been so long, long time ago
I pushed you up against the wall
But never I'll make you fall
I left you out to rule the day
It's not my time to cope with the pain
Instead I live insane
And I want you
They're haunting me
All the memories in my head
My rude awakening
Is when all my fears are coming back
You watch my shadows disappear
The air was filled with lust and fear
In dark corners of my brain
Before it gets the best of you
Inside my lust will face the truth
But I'm the one to blame
And now I got you
