If only I could now return to warm you of your fate
My prophecies help you to stay alive unless you reach the gate
This life was unholy my world they had to release
You hear me screaming out your name
But all the tears are passing by to this everlasting life
The spirit we have called is strong
The fall from grace where I belong
Reveal the secrets of this life
Watching the past as it dies
Free me from this nightmare where I lived in peace
You hear me screaming out my name
And when the tears are passing by to this everlasting life
No need to fear so scream my name
When all the dreams you had they didn't show an everlasting life
