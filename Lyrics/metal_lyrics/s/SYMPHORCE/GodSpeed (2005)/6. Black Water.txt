As I'm coming faster, do you hear me speak?
All the things you said to me, all the things you need
Now you see me clearer, stare you in the eye
No need to say a word as I read your lips and lies
Oh no the seasons changed
I sink into sleep
It's hidden away where black water seeped
All the pain you spread inside
All the roots of sin
So stay away and read my mind
But I won't ever let you get in
