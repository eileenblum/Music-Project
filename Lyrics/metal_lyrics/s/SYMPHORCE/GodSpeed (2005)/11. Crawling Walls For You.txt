I'm cured and by your side
Standing here outside your room
Don't blame it on me, cause I feel like a fool
Is everything alright?
No, you shouldn't be so sure
Somehow I know we're breaking all the rules
When I hear you speak
It's the fall from silence
Still I hear you speak
I'm crawling walls for you
And when I hear you speak
Listen one more time
Left alone and weak
I'm crawling walls for you
Make me know you care
In your hold you know that I
Will never escape your vary eyes
Like a storm you rage on me
Through the forest of my dreams
My bitter end is your creed
