[lyrics/music: Franck]

It comes from the depths
of a place unknown
to the keeper of dreams
so human at sight
a monster at heart
tear you right apart
high priest and fire from the sea wipe the guilt free from my face the
darkness seems to find me.
Try talk to the clouds spill out the rain, what?s wrong with your brain
the weeds are on fire they're burning away the last one to betray
Watching the days slip into the night have always been my guiding light
and you know the world?s unkind

Holy sin will forever be,
holy lust will ever be holy sin for you!
Holy sin will forever be,
holy walls of never holy sin for you

When trust turns to pain,
when doubt drives insane
drifting into the lives
seep into the soul,
emotions controlled
the power it holds
Open my eyes wide to see a moment
of clarity religious believes they seed...
alone you might find serenity
