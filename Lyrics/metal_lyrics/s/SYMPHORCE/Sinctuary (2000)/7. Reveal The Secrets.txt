[lyrics: Franck / music: Franck, Dupont]

Just a shadow in the dark
you've seen my face before
is it just a fantasy
am I coming back for more
can't say what's on my mind
can't do what I really feel
and where's the helping hand
is this my final stand?

Now I will fly
until the day the future dies until the morning of my life
until the meaning runs beside me into my life

I always thought I'd never get caught
my time draws near, what I thought was peace of mind long before I broke
the
rules Thinking now about my perfect crime now I'm standing in the line
They come at night, they steal my dream they will reveal, they steal my
secrets out of blood i'm sure you will.
The end is near captive of the empty dreams so crystal clear
I feel the crumbling insane
I am the lord I am the pain
I hold the secrets of your life
I?m out of sight
Stained glass bursting in
shattered my world again,
they dig me out , they let me in
nothing will be in between
