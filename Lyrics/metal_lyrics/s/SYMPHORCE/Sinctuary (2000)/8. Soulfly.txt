[lyrics: Franck/music: Walter; Franck]

In your eyes the time was right for us to stay
a falling out, between you and your pride, no, don?t go there's something
you should know a blinded light

Will I ever,they die to get inside
will I ever be here tonight
will I ever you better leave don?t try
will I ever see my soulfly

the stains have tried
desperate and blindfly
leave the pain never leads the way
The open door shut tight
braving our misfortunes day and night
After what I had to live
I've got nothing left to give
Indifference consuming you
under a violent new moon
