[lyrics: Franck / music: Wohlbold; Franck]

The Abomination with all it's pestilent dreams
will swallow in the darkness and relish your screams
I lift my head up high and stare to the stars.
To a place that will heal the scars
Beware my friends as you pass by
as you are now so once was I
as I am now so you must be
( prepare to follow me )
The silence is broken, by nightmarish dreams.
And you have been chosen, to conquer the weak. Hypnotized you will, you
will
obey.
Hypnotized by what they say
Concede your mind
sight as it blinds
conformed design
It turns to light
no place to hide
In for the endless might
Someone to hear your prayers,
someone who cares
your destination ends ahead
I'll make you a believer
you know I'm a forgiver
Until the last
Until the last goodbye
Until the last
you could carry on with this lie
Until the last
Until the last will die
Until the last
No matter how hard I try
