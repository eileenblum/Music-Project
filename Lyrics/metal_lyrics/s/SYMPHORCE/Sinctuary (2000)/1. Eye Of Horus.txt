[lyrics/music: Franck]

There was a time when I needed to pray
the color of dried blood down on my knees
for now I'll believe falling apart at the seams
I gotta rise, I'm sick of your lies
now I'm just feeling better, I'll be trembling in
your breath and I'm here forever
Souls of fire won't you be told
instinct liar I've sold my soul
There was a time when I needed a place
to free from my face
the days with no dawn and my pages turn

holding onto a ghost
I can't save
Do you feel the shame
cause I need a change
Some believed in all my lies
but I know, what's wrong in
your mind

When you walk away,
so I'm lost
in the eyes of forever
now I hear you say
heal my soul
with the eyes of forever

There was a time when I needed to live
blood on my left hand to judge and dissect
to serve and protect my faith, the reason to get through
I gotta rise, I'm sick of your lies now I'm just feeling better, Strength
in
time of suffering Man alone is a weakling
Plugged in my mind, there's no place to run and hide
no bag of gold, can save their lives
