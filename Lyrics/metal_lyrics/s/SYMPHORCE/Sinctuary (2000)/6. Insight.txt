[lyrics/music: Franck]

When the wind is blowing cold and winter takes
control. I throw the dice. There's no choice,it?s all fate in life. I
embrace what lies ahead until the day or am I dead. Prophecies have paved
the way from all this decay
Losin' my mind a chance to live while
chasing the time. You steal me blind
so let there be no doubt I feel it's time
I like to practise what I preach constantly
out of reach If I could see the things that you see then I'd understand
the
way you feel

Will the sadness go away, come back another day
endless stairs and a guiding light
another world in sight....
When the sadness went away,I'll be there for another day
hopeless souls and the darkest night
take a look insight....
