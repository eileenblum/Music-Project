[lyrics: Franck / music: Wohlbold; Franck]

The shadows are on your side as lights go down
In the darkest place you find a tune of it?s own
Like the haze of the afterglow jaws will part
When the storm is about to blow words fall out
For rumors in the wake of such a lonely crowd
I?m changing my name just as the sun goes down
through the years of emptiness in darkest souls
yearning to be held by you, but you feel cold!
Show me your secrets and tell me your name
try to remember again and again
Now as the fog has lifted, you can see somehow lost we'll find our way,
like
in a dream. Echoes growing in the heart of twilight. I wouldn?t say that
you
were ruthless or right
The blood on the hands of the one
who has covered the sun
If I were born another time, I'll have my place. In different worlds
we've been, another world in space

I just can't help myself
the truth is now too far
I start to find my way
in a burning star
I just can't help myself
as long as you're too far
Out of my mind and sight
In a burning star
