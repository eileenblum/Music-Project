Do you hear me? Can't you see?
I'm lost between four walls
And the web of conspiracy
Do you feel it? Do you dare?
There's no time for you and me
There's no one nowhere!

I'd like to tell you but I have to pretend
All the words, all the lies, on and on again

Do you call it another lie?
Do you step inside and right out of my life?
I can't hear what you say to me
My fear becomes real and the hope's gone away

I'm lost, there's nothing's left to say
Someone is watching me
Controlling every step I take
It's the last decision that I make
