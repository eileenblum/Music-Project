What do I see in you
When the sun hurts my eyes?
Is it real when I watch you burn
You've disappeared
And I've lost all hope in life
It makes no sense
All the things I've learned

Is it any wonder
I put myself to sleep
I'm taking you under my wings
Into the eternal deep

Is this the end of innocence
Do you confess your sins?
Now you reap what you sow
Dark shadows and shifting eyes
There's no escape, who wins?
I'll prove myself
Before the night is through
