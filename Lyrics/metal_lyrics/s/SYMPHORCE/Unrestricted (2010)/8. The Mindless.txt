When salvation waits for me
What's behind the walls of society?
I shall not face the day
It's so close but still so far away

Without you I will fade they will not remain
Who can stop this curse
Somehow I'll breathe again
Until the madness is closing in

It doesn't matter how we die
So take a look through their disguise
We are the mindless with no escape
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

I won't go down, through my blood I will pay
And stand my ground, it's burning me
So I lay down to rest my soul, now I'm free

Nothing will ever make sense of this
Out of fear I try to speak my memories
My world has closed these doors to me
Until you face your mortality
