You're burning inside by the light of your lies
You speak the words I haven't heard
Nothing's alive when our dreams collide

My shattered faith of your jaded prey
Somehow I'm lost as you begin to sway
Nothing is more than you ever deserve

Do you ever wonder, my soul just disagrees
Do you really think that
I'm everything you want me to be

You're travelling through a space in my mind
Another way to leave my dreams behind
Find deep within my unseen soul

Well, I ain't got no future, I ain't got no plan
I'm still the hunted and there's nowhere to run
Till the day we die you still believe we tried
