I step into the nightlight
Feel my breath across your skin
My depression descends
Without wasted pain
And no sorrow within

I'm casting an evil spell on you
Wake up in an empty room
Feel me stuck in your brain
And in your every move

Visions around you
Help me to find the truth behind
I'm rising inside your mind
Far away where you face your dream
Close your eyes and follow the stream

Release the thoughts inside
With the blink of an eye
Save me from myself
I'm surrounded on every side
