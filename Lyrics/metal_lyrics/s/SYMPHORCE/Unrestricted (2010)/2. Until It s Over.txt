I feel lonely, but not really alone
I'm one out of millions but still on my own
How could I just close off my eyes
I know this would kill me as each day dies

Until it's over, what dwells inside
You risk your life; there's no guarantee
Unlock the chains that bound me

Until it's over, I'll stay alive
A part of me dies
My life is my only chance
I am god in a godless land

All's said and done but you steal my soul
You pushed my back against the wall
So I became a part of this dark world
Where the evil's alive, and promises hurt
