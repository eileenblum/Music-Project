My life is broken and I'm only one of a kind
But now here I am and I'm lost inside
I wake up from my dreams
But still have closed my eyes
Whatever crawls my skin, skins me alive

I raise my eyes to see, I come to take this life
Whatever hurts me, I will survive
I'm a slave to my eyes but my soul is still alive
Whatever hurts me, I will survive

I'm tryin' to find my way
There ain't no way out of here
Nothing can change my destiny
Am I to hide inside the fear
I tried to remember, I tried to forget
Is it who I've become today
I should have used what's in my head
