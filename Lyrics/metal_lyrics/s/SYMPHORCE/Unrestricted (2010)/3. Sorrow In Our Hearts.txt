I know that you can't see
Seems easy for you to watch me bleed
I've seen your face and tried to scream
While you're breathing your hate on me

Demons surround me, every night when the day is through
I have to keep up my strength, every time I lose

Wishes are bringing the sorrow in our hearts
It's turning the inside out, the sorrow in our hearts

With your shadow next to me
I tried to run but my feet are walking
Release my soul just one more time
I suffer but you're not talking

I wait so patiently, now you stand
And stare so silently
