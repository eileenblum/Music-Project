Everything I am or used to be
How can I stand here before you?
I need some time to help myself to erase the pain
You never dreamed that it would ever becomes true

I should have seen it from the start
So step outside yourself we're not torn apart

My words will change the world
You're staring at me and asked me to speak
When my worlds seem to collide
Nothing these days makes us feel alive

You stole my tongue, you told me to lie
But didn't believe my words
Open your arms, cause I'm coming through
With no remorse I'm aiming at your heart

When everyone is watching and no one sees
I'm not afraid of you and what I may not be
