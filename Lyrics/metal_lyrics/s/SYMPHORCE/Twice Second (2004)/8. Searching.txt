I've been around the world and found a sin to live so well
A vision sent I'll hold your hands, a memory has made you dwell
You always wrapped up in yourself and let me cry alone

I'm searching for serenity in a world of my own
The pieces of my sanity, my anger far too long

It eased my mind but now I know it's time to cross that line
Just want to say this is my way of telling you I'm fine
Once again I've gone off track no hope for coming back

I'm searching for serenity in a world of my own
The pieces of my sanity, my anger far too long
