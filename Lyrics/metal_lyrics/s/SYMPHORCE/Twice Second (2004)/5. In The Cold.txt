So far away it seems that you don't know now who you are
You say this life has done you wrong and brought you way too far
The chance has passed you by and if it's true now who's to blame
You turned away but still you're bound to fail again

You see it inside my eyes
Can't stay here, can't clear my mind
It's plain to see as you leave me standing out in the cold
But I will never turn my back against the wall
There's nothing left for me out here in the cold

You see me smiling through the coloured smoke where I'm left behind
And take from yourself just a mask to hide the tears inside
Can't get away from all those places as the spirit dies
And again you realize that the mirror doesn't lie

You fear me but you don't care
I'll drag you down to everywhere
It's plain to see as you leave me standing out in the cold
But I will never turn my back against the wall
There's nothing left for me out here in the cold
