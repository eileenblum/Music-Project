When the clouds and tears in my eyes
Turn to light as you look to the sky
Again this feeling grows deep in my heart
We're four of a kind
we'd never grow apart
Why do I hold you
How do I feel you

Cry on my Shoulder
Whenever you appear
Cry on my Shoulder
I swear I'll always be here
Cry on my Shoulder
In these frozen night
Cry on my Shoulder
I'll take off the sand in your eyes

Forever so close, a heart-beat away
In my arms you feel warm and I'm searching words to say
I can't wait to feel and wait for my chance
To open my arms and hold you again
Why do I love you
How do I Care

Cry on my Shoulder
Whenever you appear
Cry on my Shoulder
I swear I'll always be here
Cry on my Shoulder
In these frozen night
Cry on my Shoulder
I'll take off the sand in your eyes
