As a shadow casts over my head
I'm moving slowly through the endless dark
Too late to stop my course
Falling closer to fear you promise to make it worse

Thousand points of light shining
But it's fire that's been tamed
Scaring my fears away now
Wake me when I'm insane

From somewhere my dreams and emotions
Will take off my own memory
Fallen away
From somewhere the fear of devotion
Is the gateway to my prophecy
Fallen away

The conflict rises and I'm tangled in
Like in the windings of an endless spring
Believe in ghosts the deceptions sure
Like the dead would laugh I'm tempted by the force

Eyes are blinded and I can't hide
My thoughts begin to sway
Ripped apart from the inside
Perceive another way

From somewhere my dreams and emotions
Will take off my own memory
Fallen away
From somewhere the fear of devotion
Is the gateway to my prophecy
Fallen away
