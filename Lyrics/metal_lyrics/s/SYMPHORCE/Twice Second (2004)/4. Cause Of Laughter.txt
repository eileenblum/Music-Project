Inside your blood, inside your veins, your thoughts collide and hurt your brain
You think the trouble you have made causes my canine devotion
It's the fear inside your eyes, inside your dreams, inside your lies
Your speech is now without a sense and without emotion

You gathered all my words in one
Again you'll fail and soon be gone

You are the cause of laughter
The doubt that clouds my mind
The answer of my fears inside
You are the cause of laughter
A smile I can't erase
You ruined all my memories

My sense of justice, your last chance, bury your face now in my hands
The cause of life, your reason to create another contortion
Need no approval of a chosen few, the tainted past that I once
You should have been straight, agree to change, without distortion

You need my presence, frozen sight
A rising credence, strength and might

You are the cause of laughter
The doubt that clouds my mind
The answer of my fears inside
You are the cause of laughter
A smile I can't erase
You ruined all my memories
