I open my eyes and all I can see is
Upon the horizon the darkness in me
If all we see is all to believe
This shall now awake the power in me

You better turn around and walk away
Are you sure that everything will go your way
I'm not here to heal your wounds not to forget
You're so confused my words will break you back

My wisdom lies in flames
You better get out of my way
It's running through my veins
As I'm screaming out your name

You say there's pain inside and nothing more to give
Controlling all my thoughts two seconds to live
I'm growing stronger haven't heard from you so long
Your fate has passed you by but I moved on

You're all I seek I feel alone my fire burns to the black
Reality will hit your veins as I'm now coming back

Now watch your back find out it's true
The net is wrapped around you
I'm twisting all your words
You're making up lies until it hurts

You say there's pain inside and nothing more to give
Controlling all my thoughts two seconds to live
I'm growing stronger haven't heard from you so long
Your fate has passed you by but I moved on
