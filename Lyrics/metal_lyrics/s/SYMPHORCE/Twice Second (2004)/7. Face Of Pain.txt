In the shadows, my hurt will make you whole
Neon shining on your empty world below
You can't lose this battle, pay for your own protection
Call it crime, but your state is too scared to mention

What I really meant to say
My world slowly turns away

Why don't you hear me
Why did I listen to your lies
Why don't you see again
I'm facing the truth with the face of pain

Check yourself, see you there and go where you've never been
Something strange, your point of view is what you've never seen
Understand and pray for the strength to stand today
Feel so strong that it takes my fuckin' breath away

The more I need the more it grows
I'm filled with lies, you fears and sorrows

Why don't you hear me
Why did I listen to your lies
Why don't you see again
I'm facing the truth with the face of pain
