Don't you see now what's on your mind
Don't you wait forever as we're side by side
Can't hear the silent words you say
As I look into the past but you didn't leave traces on your way

How it came to be and how can I explain
How I wish for things to be the same
Wasted in your pointless lies, but still you hold the key
As you can see it now, it wasn't only me

My time has come to take what's mine
So scared of what I'll find
My time has come to see me through
So scared of the things I always do

For all the pain and suffering I watched you ignore
For the will to understand I've never been here before
You've only been here by yourself there's nothing to be found
Now as your sorrow feelings are slowly coming down

Forever now which one would you forget
These times we all make choices that we regret
You cannot speak the words no more
Still you can't hear my footsteps on the floor

My time has come to take what's mine
So scared of what I'll find
My time has come to see me through
So scared of the things I always do
