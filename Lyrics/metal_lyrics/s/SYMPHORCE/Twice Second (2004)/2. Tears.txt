Lost in sleep, descending at the darkest hour
And as I torch the light you descend from your frozen tower
Maybe I'll lead another life desire will defeat me
But as the dark came over me you were shifting the dust from my memories

I have to feel this way
Shine your spell over me

Take my soul to where your dreams will pass me by
What do I believe in where the tears will fade away

A blistering line of fate, remains forever cold
I'll break the frame and throw myself back against wall
Can't wait too long the doubt sets in, slowly sinking down
At night now I will disappear, unsafe but not alone

To feed upon your prey
You are my enemy

Take my soul to where your dreams will pass me by
What do I believe in where the tears will fade away
