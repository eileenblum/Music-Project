When you look inside my eyes
colored people, painted skies
the slave rules the king
my preacher becomes suffering
won't you come with me
unlock the doors, set free the dream
You're taking me higher, when we fall 
everywhere
never feel
never cold
never fall
never old...
stronghold !
through the mystic dawn
 another world, where you come from
if there is a way
don't hide don't be afraid
across the sky
the rays of light, on wings you fly 
wherever you are, set your soul free
won't you come with me
unlock the doors, set free the dream.
