So far away over rainbows
so close, you ride side by side
into the temple of light into violence
over, and blinded by the white 
You close your eyes 
thy freedom rise 
in different directions, in one life
One star to fall, behind the wall 
after the curtain falls 
Over the seas, over boundaries 
over the martyr of sin 
so what's the score, what did I take the trouble for
how can they give me anymore 
Now taught by your state 
trapped by your fate 
it's do it or die, I can try 
tell me who's to blame 
moth to the flame
swollowed now up my soul 
time passed my way
worn fools that pray
drifted away 
your laughter stays 
through my dismay
drifted away
Hearing you talk is like silence
Turning around to an empty space
Now locked in castes with rooms full of crimson
No sadness, no laughter in your face
What's mine is yours
surrounded by force
through rose colored eyes
a thin line 
Not what you wear
Not what you fear
You're controlled by a modern might
Where eagles fly
reduced to a lie
that's when they hide in shadows 
look back at the same
my deal with the pain 
we're caught in an endless night
