Anytime you cry, i opened up my eyes
When i see you smile, it turns into light
anytime you're there what's forever for
When i see you fly,
coming down the floor
Don't you believe me don't you realize
I'm loosing my mind in the sea of life
all what you're dreaming for
you're trust goes by the island earth, 
a fortress of lies blown by the winds from deep within' 
over the thin line, silence in sin 
you can never feed the hunger of em all 
will you now believe, the impact of the fall 
why they're suffering oh god what is true 
make us clear our minds, 
but ... the bell saves you !
