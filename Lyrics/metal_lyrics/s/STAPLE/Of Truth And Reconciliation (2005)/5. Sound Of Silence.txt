They're coming to take our resolve away.
To steal all the progress that we have made.
Our backs to the wall, but our hands gripped like steel,
And we'll never regret; though they say that we will.

We'll smile at the sound of silence...
These voices say that we'll die - we'll fade by the road as cities fly by.
We will survive and hearing silence, we'll smile when it hurts to be in love.

I'd take it all back if it meant gaining more but I've never fought this hard for you before.
They all say stop, but these time zones have shown what you mean to me and just how far I'll go.

We'll smile at the sound of silence...
These voices say that we'll die - we'll fade by the road as cities fly by.
We will survive and hearing silence, we'll smile when it hurts to be in love.
