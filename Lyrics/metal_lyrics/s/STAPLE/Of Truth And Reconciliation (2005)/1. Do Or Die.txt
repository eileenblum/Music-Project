The elitist mob cometh with fury in their speech.
With bursting wallets flashing, they've assumed the right to teach.
There's a fire in the sky and the stake is immersed in flames.
I salute the man ignited for giving up all his change.
They're threatening you... They're threatening me...

Shall we call the ambulance!
They've threatened our lives with death!
(Show me your faith)
Let's stain their sharpened knives with voices raised and heads held high
WE WILL NOT CHANGE TONIGHT.

The serpent has beseeched me again... The fruit is ripe for the feast.
But your fork-tongued gluttony has convinced me not to eat.
Compromise is what you want and it's everything we won't give.
So we answer, "Don't insult us! If you tell us that it's do or die, we chose death!"

Call the ambulance!
They've threatened our lives with death!
(Show me your faith)
Let's stain their sharpened knives with voices raised and heads held high
WE WILL NOT CHANGE TONIGHT.

I promise you I'll never change.
I'd die before I'd ever change for you.
IT'S DO OR DIE TIME(x4).

I promise you I'll never change.
The truth of life can't be missed: I've felt it in His wrists (Show me your faith).
Let's stain their sharpened knives with voices raised and heads held high
WE WILL NOT CHANGE! I'D DIE BEFORE I'D EVER CHANGE TONIGHT.
