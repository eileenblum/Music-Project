Thinking of you...Amazed by your disguise. You look so beautiful with death in your eyes. I'm breaking free from you and it's the best/the hardest thing I could do. You'd never know that I loathe you.
Do not lust in your heart after her beauty. Or let her captivate you with her eyes. [Prov. 6:25]
So in love with the memories of you that I have fallen away. 
I'm so alive in the memories of you that I have died today.
God please kill the lady that's inside of me....Stay out of my house! You're not welcome here! I'm so free without you, yet so aware that I am hanging on by a thread of grace and nothing more. Sweet Jesus have mercy when she knocks on my door.
The prostitute reduces you to your weakest. Adulteress preys upon your very life. [Prov. 6:26]
Hosting her was the choice I made, competence was the currency paid.
Hence, my true love I'd forsake. Eyes maintained for her she'd take.
I'm breaking for my heart to find innocence I've left behind.
God Almighty, giver of peace, grant to me the strength I seek.
