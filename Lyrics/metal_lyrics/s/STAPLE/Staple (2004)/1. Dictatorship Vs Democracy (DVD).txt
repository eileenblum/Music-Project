Vicious cycle of life... I find that I kill myself every time I look away from you
But I often gaze another moment. Incited scars reopen,
Bleeding again, and they're bleeding at my request
Freely given, and we choose the choice to lose (now we know) 
As these scars are screaming at me - just why we've chosen poorly.
Could it be our chance to see why we believe that we need you instead of following numbly?
Ride on, ride strong, soldier, march to the dictated beat. 
Have you ever known how victory feels unless you have felt defeat?
Don't want the pain of free will stolen and mindless mechanical will chosen
Cherish the loss - there is no concept of gain without cost.
I fall, and I fall freely. Incited scars are bleeding and now I believe. I freely believe.
When I hit the ground and bloody palms I raise,
The arms that pick me up convince me there's no better place.
