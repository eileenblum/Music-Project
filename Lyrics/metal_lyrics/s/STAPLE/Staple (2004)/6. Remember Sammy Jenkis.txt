Memories inside have captured me
They're sitting by my bedside and captivating my mind
Vengeance is mine, or soon will be
Revenge is my time-line; your payback is my deadline
Is it everything I thought that it would be?
Licking all of my wounds so faithfully
Wanting peace, but flaunting this disease
As this pain sleeps so bitterly
This is life...
What a glorious means to find release
It's your eye for my eye
Can I keep living with this pain for my "relief?"
It's your eye for my life
Bottled up inside, and swallowing me
I've fallen in love with hate, and now I'm finding that it's too late
This bitterness won't leave, so now I see
By harboring these memories, they now own me
"Retribution's on the line. You'll get yours and I'll get mine."
It's not everything I thought that it would be -
Living with the past, so fervently
And all that I've learned through this misery
Is that memory is treachery
