Charge the gates, ye proud and strong - are we not invincible?
These are the lives we own, we rule and rule alone
Is this the night we asked for? We're all the things that we swore
That we would never be...basking in our apathy.
Institution revolution. Raze this ground, fight for your life (with vengeance tonight)
Taken by forceful intrusion, we will live before we die.
Is now not the time to raise our fists in defiance
Of this night that steals our dreams of all that we once hoped that we'd achieve?
Fight with fists afire and watch this city burn down.
Tonight we show the day the light our passion can create.
We watch this city burn down! We fight tonight to live before we die! Raise your fists afire!
