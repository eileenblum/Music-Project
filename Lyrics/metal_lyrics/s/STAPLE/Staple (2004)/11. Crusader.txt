Call to arms, there's a holy war tonight.
You and me and it's time to fight
Prideful times for prideful eyes
Brother, I see right and you see blind
Respect my rights and my right beliefs
It's death to non-compliancy
And we all fall down, as this body breaks to pieces
Unity is breaking down. Hello, self-righteousness.
United, we're divided and we fall to our demise
And we all are breaking down. There's a holy war waged against our own side.
Segregate the masses, keep our corporate consciences feeding
Send more fire down from the pulpit; convince me that's just what we're needing
Onward, good soldier, you'll find this is the price you pay.
Your comrades are all occupied, stuck in their own ways.
And all the while we've fought so hard, blind, inflicting our own scars.
Forgetting where the battle's waged, it didn't even occur to us that we're already saved.
Embrace our death... It's you and me.
So we fall, proud and tall. All for one, none for all.
