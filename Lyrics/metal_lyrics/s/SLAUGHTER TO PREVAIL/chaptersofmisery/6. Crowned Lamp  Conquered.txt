[feat. Lucas Mann of Rings Of Saturn]The cold eyes of seething hatred forever control us
Settle in the minds of chaos &amp; immortality

In the dead heads of my pathetic enemies
I'll treat my sword like a trophy
As their bodies fall to knees

Blood will stain like all of the disgust of humanity
Know now that we are mortal flesh

Fear my hate I go to the throne
A throne to be covered in blood
You'll all be sure to watch as I rise
&amp; you all want to kill me
You all want to wear my skin

Open the gates of Hell

Death looks into your eyes

Fear permeates through your bones &amp; they break
By creating this place God made a mistake
There is a war [2x]

You're forgotten so go to paradise to create a Hell
A slave of a God born to destroy
Your perfect God made a fucking mistake
&amp; feel to the depths
So prepare to die
You pieces of shit

Violence for the sake
Of the throne
Let mankind die &amp; be reborn as a beast

We are animals
We give birth to death
[2x]
