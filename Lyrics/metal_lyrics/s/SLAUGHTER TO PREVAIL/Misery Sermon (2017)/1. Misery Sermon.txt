We come in the form of pure evil, to sow seeds of discord
Like merciless beasts, we came to cut off your fucking heads
Like a plague, sent to crush it all!
Humanity will run like rats

Like merciless beasts, we came to cut off your fucking heads
As hideous beasts, we bring death and misery
You will watch as everything you love dies
Your enemies will not be and your friends hypocrites
FUCKING HYPOCRITES

HATE a huge force that gives rise to a new era
HATE incinerate the imperfections of this world...
I don't fucking care

As beasts we breaks bones and shatter systems of worship as we destroy the leaders of slavery
Now look into his eyes and relinquish fear
It marks the beginning, correcting the faults of a rotten society
Sick people watch the end of reality

As hideous beasts, we bring death and misery
You will watch as everything you love dies
Your enemies will not be and your friends hypocrites
HATE a huge force that gives rise to a new era
HATE incinerate the imperfections of this world
We infect this planet like parasites devouring their own mother
Beasts came to wake us up, and show us the way to hell
The concept of God is dead in us
GOD IS DEAD
