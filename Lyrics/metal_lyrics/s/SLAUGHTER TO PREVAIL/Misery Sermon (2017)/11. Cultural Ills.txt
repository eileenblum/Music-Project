Mutilated bodies adorn the mortal world 
Grave to grave, so build our homes 
Black tree rot together with land 
Parasites who live in hell 
We intend to dig his own grave 
Swarm of hideous creatures. 
Analogous to the gods. Fallen angels 
Humanity's disobedient child 
We destroy ourselves as a species 
War, hostility and suicide 
Our thoughts materialize and I see a picture of HELL
Society of lies 
Tears of the earth!
We intend to dig his own grave 
Swarm of hideous creatures. 
Analogous to the gods. Fallen angels 
Humanity disobedient child 
Who is responsible for the violence and pain 
Immortal selfishness lives in us 
In our veins flows the blood of Satan 
Dead eyes see chaos and hatred 
Dead heart feels pain and revenge

Mutilated bodies adorn the mortal world 
Grave to grave, so build our homes 
Black tree rot together with land 
Parasites who live in hell

We destroy ourselves as a species 
By our veins flows the blood of Satan 
Dead eyes

Dead eyes see hatred
How can you live?
Dead heart feels painï»¿
