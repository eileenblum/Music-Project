Fly on wings black as night
Through the gates
Take our blood
Make us strong
Guide our way

Shunned from light on their flight
From ancient spheres
Flames of fire in their eyes burn again

Lords of black and darkness
Guide my way
Darkest winds bear me forth
Blow my way

Shunned from light on their flight
From ancient spheres
Flames of fire in their eyes burn again

...It's war

Fire guides my path, liars feel my wrath
War has begun, white burns and turns away

Cast away lords of white
Liars
Darkest ones, come my way
Rulers

Shunned from light on their flight
From ancient spheres
Flames of fire in their eyes burn again
