My veins are open
Begging you to come my way
A Life in sadness
I call you to break my spell
Rest place of Ancients
And in rage the Absu bails
Hail wise Asaru
At the throne you watch the world

Shammash shall fall as Su'en guides my way to come
Over those mountains
Path of the ancient song

Home of the pure ones
Take my soul Nar Mattaru
Pact of the old times
Listen as I recite the words
I call thee forward
Kingu, Chutu and the hordes
Jaws of (the) dragon, Tiamat
The mother lord

White dies as feeble cries, their pain a path to freedom
This force of Ancients will come close
My blood, a key to their door
My life for their power
When they're emerging, my reward

Absu opens and come forth
as the Ancient turn my death to force
