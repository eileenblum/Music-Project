Take me from this empty life
Mortal life of feeble cries
Open new dimensions
Grantme my new life
Let me see the darkness
Let me see the night

As a shadow
From an empty past
I shall travel through the gates of time

As a shadow
From an empty past
Stronger powers guide my final path

Open wide the sky
Split it as you fly
Lords of deepest black
Come forth through the crack

Hear my mortal calling
Questing for new life
Hear my mortal hail
From your sons of black
Hear my calling
For your mighty touch
Hear my mortal hail
Thou shall remain

As s shadow
From an empty past
Feeble falsehoods
I aside now cast
