Almighty Monarch Satan...
Shatterer of hopes and worlds...
Rise from the moaning sulphur seas.
Lay your wrath upon the Earth...
And slay the Nazarene's light...
Unchained the darkest fiend
The malignant of indivisible pain and plague

Death and sorrow...
Let the grand symphony of damnation
End in tormented human cries...
Arise from the well of scarlet fires...
Infernal ones of the black aeons.
Darkness shall... Reign!

...And chaos shall tear the bleeding sphere apart.
I worship thee, I kneel for thee,
Lord come forth...
From the sulphur seas.

Cries, pain, mysticism...
Shadows embrace the stars above
Black arts, the key to damnation...
The wrath of Satan.

Through the night fog I gaze at the entrance into the deep forest.
The eternal maze of olden trees and trails...
I follow the path of the wolves, and beyond my darkest fantasies I will find 
my answers...
Thus I walked; Into the ancient ruins.
