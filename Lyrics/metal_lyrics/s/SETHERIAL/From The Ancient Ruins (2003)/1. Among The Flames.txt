Through the gates
I fall into the ring of fire.
Through the flames
As a cold wind of death...
Evoke my wrath
Summon the force of my hate.
Enthrone my sins
My spells shall burn the Earth.

Lord of Hell
Come give me thy touch and thy spell.
Thus, I am of him...
Ignite my path
Satan show me the power within.
Manifest thy might
Put upon my head the crown I crave.

Satan lord, your throne among the flames of the abyss.
Evil one, the mighty lord of hell... Satan.

Through the gates
I fall to be greeted in Hell.
Through the depths
Reborn I rejoice.
Lord of Hell
Come give me thy touch and thy spell.
Give me force
To be the infernal eternal.

Satan lord, your throne among the flames of the abyss.
Evil one, the mighty lord of hell... Satan.

By this force manifested in anger, by this birth manifested in flames.
Lord of Hell through the shadows I call thee, dark lord through the crimson 
seas.
Evoked; my wrath, summoned; the force of my hate.
Enthroned; my sins, my spells have extinguished the Earth.
Through the gates; I fly to cast aside Heaven's kingdom.
Into the flames; reborn I reign...
