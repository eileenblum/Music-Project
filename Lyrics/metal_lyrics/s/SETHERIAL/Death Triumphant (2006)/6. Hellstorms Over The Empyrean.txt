War, battles, infernal storms will come
Black and cold without sunshine rays
Exploring, betrayal, war-nachines of hate
Mesmerized by the prosperity of infernal hell
Hell, unleashed, upon this hatred soil
Armed and furious, legions of the underworld
Undivine, ravenous, victorious we shall stand
Angels will be raped in the blood of a thousand murdered saints
We are as one with the furious blackwinds
Turning gods creation into ashes and dust
Ejected by the thunders
Burned and perished
Satan, no mercy or regret
Crowned by devils
Abolish creation
Subdue my will, redeem the transition to night
Unveil the curtains of chaos and despair
Behold the dawn of gods demise
Ejected by the thunders
Burned and perished
Satan, no mercy or regret
Crowned by devils
Cyclones, whirlwinds and ashes all around
Contaminated
The holocaust rages over savred ground
Storms, thunders, the dark age will arrive
Black and cold without the weak sunshine rays
Aggression, hatred, eternal be our march
Unleashing hellstorms over the empyrean
