Upon the earth a vampire was sent
A rotten corpse shall from it's tomb be rent
Ghastly haunts your native place
And suck the life of all thy race
Slaying ones daughter sister and wife
At midnight drained the stream of life
Wrapped in fear, cold blood shall drip
Ravenous hunger and haggard lip
Then stalking to the sullen grave
As another victim is passing away
Fear this horror and endless plague
A spectre more accursed than they
Ankou, the fearful spectre
Travelled the road at night
Plodding along beside a creaking cart
Carrying his dreaded scythe
Skeletal horses riding in this way
Lightning cracks as he slay
Walking with a stiff gait
Eyes of black
...accompanied by death!
At the morning dusk
And during the starless night
Catch his attention and you will surely die
The pulse increases
Before the arrival
Behold the scythe
The heinous blade of suffering
On the burialmound
Cain â the fearful repaer
Upon the earth a vampire was sent
A rotten corpse shall from it's tomb be rent
Ghastly haunts your native place
And suck the life of all thy race
Rattling from fetters of a filthy skeletal man
Clanking chains of torture, cakes with rust and dirt
Death tidings!
