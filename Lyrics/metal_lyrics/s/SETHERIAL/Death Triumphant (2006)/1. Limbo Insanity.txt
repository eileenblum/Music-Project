The Limbo of Insanity
The ashes flew by the winds
In a cold diabolic universe
Two worlds collide
Infernal destruction, Armageddon reign!
The gateways opens before me
I'll transcend into the dark
Where time and apce
Transforms into nothingness
Behold â the sulphur seas
Flesh â torned from within
Kill â the vermin of the light
Was â the force of damnation
I am the one â the keeper of the throne
I am the one â who was the fire born
Spoken tongues, rising hellfire â embracing by the scorching flames
Demonic creatures â tearing the sky, shredded ashes remains
My demons come in many forms â shadowed and mysterious
Enslaved by fear â the night draws near
The universe trembles before me â enthralled by my burning rage
Ancient secrets of creation â now mine to obtain
My hatred comes in many forms â shadowed and blasphemous
A world in fear â the night draws near
The ashes flew by the winds
In a cold diabolic universe
Two worlds collide
Infernal destruction, Armageddon reign!
Distort this creation of light
Into a limbo of insanity
One world remain
The infernal dominion of fire and flames
Behold â the sulphur seas
Flesh â torned from within
Kill â the vermin of the light
Was â the force of damnation
I am the one â the keeper of the throne
I am the one â who was the fire born
The gateway opens before me
Infernal destruction, Armageddon reign...
Armageddon reign!
