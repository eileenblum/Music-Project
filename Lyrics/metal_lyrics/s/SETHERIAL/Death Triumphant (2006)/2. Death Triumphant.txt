In the shadows of the elysian fields
I see life and death collide
Symphonies played on accursed flutes
The stars are forced to be extinguished
A cold, dark and empty space
Where depressive minds blossoms
When the night of heresy came
Heaven embraced by fire and flames
Angels with their broken wings
Descending to the bleeding soil
Where life and death shall stand as one
Engulfed by the freezing nothingness
When the night of heresy came
Heaven embraced by fire and flames
In this sombre realm of death
Pain has taken human form
Like a dead star the black flame burns
The path of enlightenment
Death shall create life
Out of the ravishing emptiness
Sorrow... throughout the universe
As the anti-creation prevails
Rise, rise, legions of heresy
Those who shall rule in splendour
Hatred... burning in their veins
As the gateways once again are open wide
Death triumphant!
When the night of heresy came
Heaven embraced by fire and flames
In the shadows of the elysian fields
I saw life and death collide
Death triumphant!
