Behold the night of cold deceit
Darkness and death
The end of this world
Ravaged by infernal storms
Your world shall be
The flames of hell shall cleanse us all
The blinding light
That shall come and rape this earth
The inner sanctum
Scorched by the hellstorm
The demon void
That shall come and consume this world
Through the darkness
New life take form
Dark lord infernal
I am thy bleeding servant
Bring me life eternal
Deep below the moaning sulphur seas
Dark lord infernal â I am thy blackened serpent
Bring me life eternal â let me end all that ever was
I shall inhale the embers from the funeral pyre
I shall become one with thy everlasting fire
Behold the night of cold deceit
Darkness and death
The end of this world
Into the void I shall descent
I've become death
...and I shall reap you all
Through the deeps I am falling
To obtain the black flame
The world shall once again burn
In the fires that carries thy dreaded name
