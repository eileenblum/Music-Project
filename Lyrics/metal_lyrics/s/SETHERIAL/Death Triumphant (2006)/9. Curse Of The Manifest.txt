Rebellious hatefueled heartsblood â burns my blackened soul
Suphulrous body essence shelters me from cold
By the circles of the crimson fires â manifest in blood and stone
Carved as flames burn higher â in flesh and bones
I create my kingdom
I erect my ramparts
Where jackals hunt the dying â I an w wolf among sheep
Where vultures bleed the crying â I come to reap
By the circles of the crimson fire â manifest in blood and stone
Carved as flames burn higher, in ahses soul
The vice that burns within you â ablazed by the cursed of the manifest
The wrath that dwells among you â awaked by the curse of the manifest
My words awaken the seed within your hearts
My will ignited the wicked hateful sparks
And as the blackened soil erupts and cracks in pain
My name is blasphemy â prepare to face my reign
This is the sunset of your world â now scorched and burned
This is the all-defying word â so hear my curse
This is the sunset of your world â now scorched and burned
This is the all-defying word â so fear my curse
