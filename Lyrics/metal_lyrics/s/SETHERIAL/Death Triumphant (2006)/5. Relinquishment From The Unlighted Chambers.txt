Awake ancient darkness
Dead by dreaming gods
Possess our minds with visions black
Damned to eternal sleep
But time has conquered death
And created life out of shadows
Ascending from the fathomless depths
Those who came from far beyond the stars...
Arise forgotten ones
Hear their calls and see the signs
Behold the freezing winds storming the raging seas
Contaminate the holy with disease
Where dark destroys what light create
Dreams breed in breathless sleep
Ascending from the fathomless depths
Those who dreamt eternally of our demise
Relinquishment at last
From the chambers deep below
Where thoughts are black as the universe
A burning rage that is fuled by malediction
An endless hate towards mankind
Ascending...
Yearning...
Slithering...
Horror...
Madness...
Chaos...
Death...
Despondency...
Relinquishment at last!
