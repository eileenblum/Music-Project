Deep within the flesh
The seed of hate abides my call
Until death I mar the earth, and the skies will weep
Creations fall
Devilry, wickedness and scorn
My darkened soul, hollow and dead
Demonspawn, I am what I am
I state upon the world with hatred
Inside myself a tempest whirls in rage
Rivers run wild with blood
And the charred soil beckons a somber age
Here angels die
Their broken wings scorhced and stained
Here demons hurt
Malevolence breeds and the malice is unchained
Creations fall
Devilry, wickedness and scorn
My darkened soul, hollow and dead
Demonspawn, I am what I am
I state upon the world with hatred and wrath
Unleash my will...
Unbind my hate...
Amidst the piles of skulls and scattered bones
Remnant wills are molten and cast to tones
Angelic souls forged to notes and to words
Befouled a song, vile and corrupt, the defile the world
Unleash my will...
Unbind my hate...
Fettered by flesh and blood
Abhorrent I am
