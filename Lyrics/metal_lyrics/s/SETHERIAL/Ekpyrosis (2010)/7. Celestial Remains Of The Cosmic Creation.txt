A long journey Through hostile clouds
Of poisonous dust and killing plasma
To reach the nebula of the ancient essence
And comprehend the dogma of the pillars of creation

Gathering particles generating greater masses
Attracting more matter to conquer the stellar might

Matter â Antimatter
Opposites attracted towards a destructive end
Electric paths leading to
The balance of the equation

The path of destruction
Is taken with an inborn cynical instinct

Attracting light to darkness
To generate a new breed

Creation â Anti-creation
Opposites attracted towards a destructive end
Electric paths leading to
The balance of the equation

For darkness is life
And light is only a seed of insanity
Now dry and empty
In the dimension of opposites

From the surface of the nebula
That drains life's blood
In the system that no divine light can reach

Twisted cosmic journeys
Leaving traces in time and space
Twisting and turning on themselves
To reveal the gate to the unlight world

To reveal the gate to the unlight world

For darkness is life
A new state of self
And light is only a seed of insanity
Drawing new lifeblood from celestial remains
In the dimension of opposites

Obsolete ways now forgotten and useless
As a convey of wisdom
New state of the self
Pure energy
As a convey of wisdom
