Cosmic fire
Vibrating power of creation
Floating flames of cosmos
Generating their mortal spawn

Unseen dimensional ghosts
Merging into a new breed
Shadows of the real existence
Projecting their presence

As haunting fears of the impending doom
Distant paths
Projected shades

Membranes
Crossing our fates
Strings vibrating
Around and inside us
Interfering
With the frequencies
Casting shadows
Over the concept of free will

The invisible hand is materialized
Across the universe

The struggle will lead
Towards the end
Towards death
And all that lies within

The dark force will prevail
Towards death
And all that lies within

Ekpyrosis
Invisible hands
Ekpyrosis
Materialized across the universe
Ekpyrosis
The inevitable faith
The flames generating death
The flames will wipe us away

Obliteration
Through cosmic decay
Eradication
Of the mortal plague
