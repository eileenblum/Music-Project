The shattered stars;
A universe
In which each action is in vain
And all human emotions equals to nothing

To stand before the eye of Satan
Is to behold ones limitations
This mortal flesh
Useless in the void

No life giving suns
No afterlife
No shining God
No tomorrow
No yesterday, no nothing

I am the enemy of the creation
That strides from world to world
The oldest star shall crumble to dust
Like the pantheons of mortal gods

We all shall fall

No life giving suns
No afterlife
No shining God
No tomorrow
No yesterday, no nothing

I hail the nothingness
The unyielding eye of Him
Satan

The shattered stars;
A universe
In which each action is in vain
And all human emotions equals to nothing

To stand before the eye of Satan
Is to behold ones limitations
This mortal flesh
Useless in the void

My guiding spirit
I give my life to you
I hail the darkness
That is the essence of you

I follow the current
Towards the end of all
Through the devouring eye
We all must fall

Worship Him
Worship Him

To stand before the eye of Satan
Is to behold ones limitations
This mortal flesh
Useless in the void
No life giving suns
Just the glare of Algol
No tomorrow,
No yesterday, no nothing
