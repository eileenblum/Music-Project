Haunting the minds of those who killed the truth
Spilling blood and eating flesh upon the altar
Wielding their weapons of ancestral fears
As dreadful monsters with primordial hunger

For casting them into the abyss

From wandering the earth and walking on it he comes
Bringing forth damnation
As the signs of the true winged messengers
Lay buried and forgotten in the sans

Like a hungry beast
The rebellious fallen
Will crush the faith of pity
Accuser, persecutor, oppressor
Emperor of the grievous reign

Worship the eye
As the heavens collapse
Worship darkness
As the light of god dies

Drowning in madness
Of blind despair
Face obliteration
In the darkest corner of the mind

The gate opens
The light has failed
Worship darkness
As you are caught in the eye of the storm

The devouring eye
The final judgement
The devouring eye
In an ocean of haunting darkness

Unleashing the serpent, feeding the flame of its soul
That climbs the circles of life as it evoked

Unveiling the vicious conspiracy
By denying the dogma of the Nazarene

Worship the eye
As the heavens collapse
Worship darkness
As the light of god dies

Worship death
As the fate you can't deny
Worship the end
As your shining god dies

Drowning in madness
Of blind despair
Face obliteration
In the darkest corner of your mind

Before casting them into the abyss
Where their cursed beliefs are crushed
Into an infinite godless plain of non existence
Where their god is nothing but a feeble light
