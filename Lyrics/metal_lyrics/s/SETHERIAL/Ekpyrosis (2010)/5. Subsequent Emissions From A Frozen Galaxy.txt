Subsequent emissions from a frozen galaxy

At the whim of time
Space and the laws of physics
All that will be left are fading ghosts
Of distant galaxies
Each an afterimage
Preserving a final moment
As a swarm of stars
Slips into a netherworld

Of cosmic invisibility
Bound to the force of destruction

The point of no return
For these galaxies
In a event horizon
The hypothesized sphere
Around a black hole
Beyond which nothing
Not even light, can escape

Matter falling into the eye of
Singularity and become a frozen image
