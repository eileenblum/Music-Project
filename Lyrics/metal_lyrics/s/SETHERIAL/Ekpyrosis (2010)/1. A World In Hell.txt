These wretches!
Hear me!
"Woe to you, perverted souls!"
Went naked and were stung and stung again

"I've come to lead you to the other shore, into eternal darkness..."

Ice-Fire
"All this will be made plain to you as soon we shall come to stop upon the shore of Acheron"

Enter the infernal baptism
Justify yourself

The scar of every man
Tears wide open as blood runs out
Their blood mixed with tears
Dripped to their feet
And disgusting maggots collected in their pus

The scar of every man
Tears wide open
I can see the eyes of fire
The earth trembles and fall

In the lair of convocation
Grotesque division rise

I can see the eyes of fire
And the sulphur rivers appear
Chaos empire
Chaos alive
The earth trembles and fall
Shadows
Reach within to set me free
Fires
Set the world in hell

Into the fires of hell I go
The sulphur world of plague and moan
No one shall hear my name again
The void is a world in hell

Satan

Perdition â Creation â Demise â Illusion
"A sense of monstrous guilt was upon the land, and out of the abysses between the stars, swept chill current that made men shiver in dark and lonely places"

A black passage appears

Into the fires of hell I go
The sulphur world of plague and moan
No one shall hear my name again
The void is a world in hell
