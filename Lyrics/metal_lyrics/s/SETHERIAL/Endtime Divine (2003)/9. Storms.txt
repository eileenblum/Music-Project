Dusk; light turns sickly pale
Bleached, fading, dying
Death; time is frozen dead
Shadows darken the sky

Foretold in nightly visions, the end awaits
As thunder roars, the darkened sky unveils

Crimson tears of the dark sky
Rain of blood, a storm bedeviled
The howling winds of the night dies
The world ablaze, embraced in fire and flames

Blackened, cold and charred, the shadowed angels bequest
Silent spirits roam, deathly still, amidst the treacherous landscape

Crimson tears of the dark sky
Rain of blood, a storm bedeviled
The howling winds of the night dies
The world ablaze, embraced in fire and flames

Born to bring damnation through purest hate
As fear is spawn, the knights of chaos awake!

Darkness incarnate, demons and fiends, vicious and vile
Rage upon the world, stained in blood, tainted and black
Swinging the scythe of death, immortal souls severed from flesh
Raped and torn to shreds, life itself crumbles and dies

Storms! The storms of hell arising
War! The end of time is near
Storms! The storms of hell arising
War! The end of time is here
