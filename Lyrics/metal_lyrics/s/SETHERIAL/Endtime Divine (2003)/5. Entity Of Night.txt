Entity of night, creature of damnation
Disciple of the fire, the guardian of lord Satan's empire

Too black to be seen, spawned by the furious winds
Alive but dead, with hate my eyes glow red

In my coffin, only unholy ashes remains
Once shining and bright, now thriving in hellish domains

Storms, earthquakes, raging seas
Visions of the end and what will be
Unleashed from the netherworld
Armed with shadows, my legions sets free

Knight of the netherworld
Lord of storms to be
Wraith of the underworld
Pandemonium opens for me

The entity of night, bringer of damnation
Scorching black pyre, the tormenting fire

[Lyrics : Sjodin / Olivius, Music : Sjodin]
