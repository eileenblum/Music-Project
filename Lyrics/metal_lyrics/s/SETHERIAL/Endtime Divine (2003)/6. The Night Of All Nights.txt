Feel the tearing claws of the storms
The delightful smell of the dark well
In a cold and furious void
Where demons are bound to dwell...
This night shall be the one
Unending torment I'll bring upon
This night shall be the one
When you face the infernal one

...Dark flames my heart

A grey fog swirls the landscape
Forever dark rivers flow
Summoned by the hell storms
Bring me damnation here within

When demons haunt the earth forever
Evil upon the black thrones
Death is in the wind
As the dark mist hides the trees...
Cursed in eternity
Lurking beyond the gate
The winters freeze my eyes
A sight... So crystal clear...

Summoned, by the dark ones
Forever... in demonic times...

This night shall be the one
I'm summoned by dark ones
This night shall be the one
Roaring damnation has begun

Facing the moon, a spirit returns
In a darker dimension, a fire burns

When demons rule the land forever
Evil upon the black thrones
Gather among the cold ruins
The place where death breathes...

Only evil eyes can see...

Summoned, by the dark ones
Forever... in demonic times...

This night shall be the one
I'm summoned by dark ones
This night shall be the one
The roar of damnation's beast

Under the clouds I reach for the sky
The bell tolls my death, I wish to die... Die!
