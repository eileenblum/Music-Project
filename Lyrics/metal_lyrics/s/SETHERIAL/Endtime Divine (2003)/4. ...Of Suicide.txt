Exit the light, into the night
As warm of darkness takes form
Mind eating serpent crawling within
Inside rages a poisonous storm

The vision is clear and the hour is now
Joy fills my heart now it's time to depart
The devil is in me, I'm fallen from grace
Satan is calling, death I now face

Son of suicide, in shadowland I rise
Son of suicide, forever in time

Son of suicide, in shadowland I rise
Son of suicide, lost within time

Hideous sight, spawn of might
I travel deep into myself on this deathlike night
My soul grows cold, black shapes unfold
The veil is torn, in darkness I'm reborn

I depart, I leave this shore
To shadowlands, deep down below
I venture forth, I bear the mark
I find my way, into the dark

Ominous void, black as coal
I turn to face myself, a cold and empty shell
A heart of ice, born of lies
The veil is torn, in death I'm reborn
