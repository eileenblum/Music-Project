Come night, come night
Lift the chalice to the nightsky
Come wraiths and lords of hell
Come guide my eyes

Give birth to hate, enthrone the wicked and the vengeful
Transform the shape I'm in, from man to king
I am the thorn in the eyes of the world
I am the servant of sinister urge
I am the one with a heart forged in coal
I am the nonloving gracefallen soul

As I walk through the gates
The kingdom of hell awaits
As my sins are praised
In rapture my crown is raised

I am the thorn in the eye of the world
I am the servant of sinister urge
I am the one with heart forged in coal
I am the nonloving gracefallen soul

A world awaits, the arrival of my legions
A fading sun that fell, my time is here...

As I walk through the gates
A kingdom of death awaits
As the angels are reaped
I smile as the heavens weep

[Lyrics : Hellqvist, Music : Sjodin]
