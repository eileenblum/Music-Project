[Music and lyrics by SjÃ¶din 1998]

Tkel, demon lord. Come forth unto me; by the flame.
The one who walks; beyond the world.
The one who is solitary; beyond solitude.

Rise. Heights of darkness, limitless spaces of night.
Ever-seeing, ever powerful... Ever hearing one.
Rise from your mountain of pain... From your tomb of cooper.
Prince of the night; Gereshma... Lord of the throne of skulls.

Satan you are summoned. You are called.
Satan you are summoned. Come forth.

Kurritakl - arise - overshadowing one...
Hailed feared - of many aspects of beings.
Waiting, lurking within the deeps. Between the planes of being.
Majesty - of deep tenebrous shadows.
Raise the dark; release the boundaries of matter.
Bring forth the night; arise from your throne.

The demonlord has arrived, through the stargate;
From the chambers of utter darkness, come forth...

Rise. Heights of darkness, limitless spaces of night.
Ever-seeing, ever powerful... Ever hearing one.
Rise from your mountain of pain... From your tomb of cooper.
Prince of the night; Gereshma... Lord of the throne of skulls.

The guardians of the gates of flame.

Nightside spirits; fallen angels...
Fly through the nightsky, from storms of death.
Creation reversed; the age of mayhem.
All life falls into oblivion.
The guardians of the gates of flame.
