[Music and lyrics by SjÃ¶din 1998]

The rise of the ancient dragon, from the darkest depths.
The seventh gate is open, and the weak god is dead.
The rise of the ancient dragon, from the darkest depths.
The seventh gate is open, and Satan rules the world.

Satan, master of darkness, I speak thy name.
Let the darkness grasp the earth, mighty demon Lord.
When the stars fall from the sky and the earth is laid in ashes.
Armageddon has come forth. Unleashed is the wrath of Satan.
Demons of realm below. I call upon the thy names
Satan sets his legions of demons, to embrace the world in darkness.
Burned by the flames of hell!
Shadows of the throne.
This is the hour of Satan. The abyss unfolds.
I shall forever be burned, by the fires of hell...

The rise of the ancient dragon from the darkest depths.
The seventh gate is open, and the weak god is dead.
The rise of the ancient dragon, from the darkest depths.
The seventh gate is open, and Satan rules the world.

Black freezing night. It's the night of the holocaust winds.
Sacrificed on the altar of Satan.
Cast into the chambers of hell...
Satan, emperor of times, towards hell we march.
Angels struck down from heaven, as the soil turns red.
Reveal the secrets, unfold thy wisdom.
Bring damnation, unleash your wrath.
Shadows of the throne...
