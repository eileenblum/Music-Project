[Music and lyrics by SjÃ¶din 1998]

The storms sweeps over this land forlorn.
Damnation reigns, only the silence remains.
Hell brought forth over the endless horizon,
demons crawl eternally beyond my flesh.
Night; my dark delight. Entranced by thoughts of tragedies.
A hell born creation locked between two worlds.
Through empires of time now vanished in the wind.

Ages; of darkness await. A messenger of hell,
a spirit of the night. By the eclipse of the red moon;
Twilight shall give birth to the new age of Satan.
Nocturnal call, in the final hour of saturn.
Nightsky, the source of dark delight.
A dim reflection of what shall prevail.
The coming of the infernal hordes by the eclipse.

The majestic throne of the endless night,
beyond the gates of time. I am the key to the infernal powers...
My heart is black as night and through the veils of fire;
Malicious storms of hell eternal.

Hell eternal.

Night, my dark delight. Entranced by thoughts of tragedies.
A hell born creation, unleashed in fury.
Through empires of time now vanished in the wind.

The majestic throne of the endless night,
beyond the gates of time. I am the key to the infernal powers...
My heart is black as night and through the veils of fire;
Malicious storms of hell eternal.
Hell eternal...
