A mighty breeze from a black void
Infernal presence; Lucifer watches through the fires
Nightwandering demons rejoice in the dunnest shadows
A cold eternity of silence;
Satan reign

Hear me, powers of the night; dwellers of the abyss
Spread your magick, let the wolves howl again
Obsessed by your black art; the force of your existance
Sway your darkened wings, extinguish light's piety

The heavens bleed

Oh mighty kings of hell; bringers of hate and damnation
Set thy legions free, make the soil burst in flames

The heavens bleed

The ground; in fire, aslegions rape the skies
Darkness grasp the earth and angels die
Set the world aflame, let chaos reign
Through the fragments of a time beyond the spaces
Born to burn to reign; descend with rage of hell

Oh mighty kings of hell; bringers of haye and damnation
Set thy legions free, make the soil burst in flames

"Paron aron azinomas, baske bano tudan donas
Geheamel cla orlay, berec he' pantaras tay"

Satan, Lucifer, Belial, Leviathan
