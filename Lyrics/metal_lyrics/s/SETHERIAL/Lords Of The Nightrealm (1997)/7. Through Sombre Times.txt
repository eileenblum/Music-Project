Awe to thee ancient winds have whispered thy name
Since the birth of time
And thine breath have always guided
The blackened souls of all existance

Thou who dwell beyond the boundaries of life
Moving amongst the shades
Thou art wise; I praise thee forever dark lord
Swept as one with the night

...Thine touch fills the sands of time, and earth
Supreme I stand; born to burn by the gates of hell
Cleansing flames where I dwell

Hail thee; lord of lords and darkness
Eyes shine through dusk

Night grows dim; blurred like the mist from a dream
Demons move through it's shapes
Night breeds sin; setting the heavens aflame
Fires reign over earth

Stars shine; reflecting ages old
Tumbling by; demons roar
Sun dies, a pale horizon glows
Night is born to remain

Hail thee; infernal prince of legions
Eyes shine through dusk

...Thine touch fills the sands of time, and earth
Supreme I stand; born to burn by the gates of hell
Cleansing flames where I dwell

Lord Satan; descend through the blackening skies
Come, spread your wings; hear my cry
Shade the earth; reveal to us all of your might
Create your kingdom on earth

Night grows dim; blurred like the mist from a dream
Demons move through it's shapes

Flung wide the gates; order through chaos, life through death
Wisdom through the fall of ignorance
Arise through the blackstorms and smell the inscence
Descend from infernal hate; eternal war has begun...
