Raging demonwinds, shattered battlefields
Flaming fires cast it's shades over universe
Through the firestorms, flashing lightning glows
Heaven's end; he descends as the light grows dim

I am the unearthly shadow
The one who lurks in the night
A new dimension beholds
Satan's rise

Through storms of might be rides
The prince of hell among us
Come hear our battle cry
Descend with purest blackness

I am the unearthly shadow
The one who lurks in the night
A new dimension beholds
Satan's rise

Rip the skies; and fill them with torture and pain,
fill the world with thy spawn
Walh the night;and make it forever remains;
may you roar in rebirth

He arrives; he descends
King of shadowrealms and ruler of the whole
He is sin, he is majesty
Standing tall we await him to grasp the earth

I am the unearthly shadow
The one who lurks in the night
A new dimension beholds
Satan's rise
