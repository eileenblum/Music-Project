Blazing skies, roaring thunder above
My couldron high towards the stars, hear my hail

Enthroned in dusk and shadows; I hail thee lord of all
Supreme I roar in hatred, evoking demon's spawn
Unholy and unbounded, to stand forever more
Reborn through the hellish fires, to be the overlord
Dark; reborn now hell I will serve
May you roar with might
Satan; reveal thy unholy widom
Thou who knoweth all

Chaos reigns, through the blackstorms I fall
Demoncrowned at the gates of Sheol I reign

Oh; destructor within creator
Thine touch fill weak with fright
Superior lord of demons
Arise through shrouds of night

"Eternal night"

Dark wings; blackshrowded lords of nightside,
break the walls where you dwell
Storms cry, angels fall from heaven,
as the pantheon unleash

Genesis of the nemisis
