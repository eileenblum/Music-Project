The olden night still draws me
Rays of the moonlight weeps over an infinity...

...Of these mighty mountains and forests

Within this mighty landscape
Mournful whispers of melancholy echoes
From a sombre cavern
A maze filled with gloomy passages

Grotesque shades
Wander the walls, where no light exist
From the thrones of the dephts
demons fly amongst the winds of twilight...

...Into the unearthly shadows

Awe o' theese spirits of the night
Embrace my darkened soul with your wings

Together we summon the beast
Invoke this magical empire
Satan thou art the impenetrable darkness
In my soul

The devil among of Ira whirling
Around this magical circle
Waiting for my life to end
In the honour of my emperor

To dwell among the strong, rule over the weak
Hell rex Sathanas; I drink from the chalice of blood

Raising the dagger; recite the words of thy names
With the eyes of the serpent; I watch these wastelands...
...The winds fortell of your arrival

Satan thou who granted me this vision
I have always knew that darkness prevails
And when the soil will burst in flames

Satan; take my soul
Into everlasting fire
Satan; take my soul
The infernal empire of Sheol...
...I shall forever dwell
