Yesterday seemed so fast, I wanted it to last
Forget everything, up until now.
Living for today not the past.
I got lost in myself again I got lost in myself
Did not want this day to ever end.

Living in my life I have found,
I can drown myself everyday and never touch the ground
Who is to say what is good or bad?
If it makes me happy then fuck the rest let them be sad.
They could say it all comes too easy
But I know your brown eyes and they please me.
I got lost in myself again I got lost in myself
I got lost in myself again I got lost in myself
Did not want this day to ever end
