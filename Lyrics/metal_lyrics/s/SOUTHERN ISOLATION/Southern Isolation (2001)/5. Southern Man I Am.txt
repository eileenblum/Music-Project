Try to be serious, try and get your life
Then on the first chance, you revisit hell
Try if you can, to fit in with them
But you canât do it you are what you are
Southern man come and take me by the hand Southern man I am

You think youâre different come back to Earth.
There are several others out there to share this wealth
Do what you tell yourself, you wonât go wrong
Then when the sun sets, youâll rest peacefully
Southern man come and take me by the hand Southern man I am

To move mountains, it sure takes less
Relieved to know this, but wise to follow
Run to hot sky country, and build your family
Pride is depression when rebel flags are burned.
Southern man come and take me by the hand Southern man I am
