Ran into an older me, knew I wouldn't like what I see
They mistake your kindness as weakness,
Just like my favourite dog with a broken leg
Wanted the sun but got stuck in the shade
Come back and let me in going down the wrong road
Come back and let me in going down the wrong road

Cannot turn it into something right, but you can direct it into the light
Just another kick to get some dick invisible love as you fuck it above just closing my eyes.
The bad seed isn't too exciting to me drags you down to something you donât want to be,
So I turn myself into stone so I'm all alone, this story is old
Come back and let me in going down the wrong road
Come back and let me in going down the wrong road

Those whispers you heard and saw
Haunting moments you had with that one marching devils by their side
Ants on carcass, watch them collide
A wall built around my self defence
Shut yourself, demand it to end it never began
Come back and let me in going down the wrong road
Come back and let me in going down the wrong road
