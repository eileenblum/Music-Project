All these times, if you could see what is happening to me
I dream awake just to be free.
The wall of you you canât break through and it is over and over
Lock the truth outside my friends wonât let them in
Another other so I canât bother to blend in with them
The wall of you you canât break through and it is over and over

It slips through the eyes that stare, and I donât care
If itâs not so should I let go of what I do not know
Empty hands, of that madman pretending to give a damn
All in a moment that last forever, but goes so fast
The wall of you you canât break through and it is over and over

No emotion woke up just to sleep in pieces you have me
They all plan all the above predictions from jealous ones
Please let it end now let it end just let it end
The wall of you you canât break through and it is over and over

I am received I am received
Close your eyes close your eyes
Close your eyes close your eyes
In the end there is no light, no path takes us close to it
In the end donât follow me out there close your eyes
