Take the moths off and breathe them in your mouth
Dress you up in violet clothes, just take you to the sun and hide you from the rain,
Take you to the trees and all you dreams lost you somewhere in the sky
Going to make you shine so beautiful tonight
Going to make you shine so bright tonight

Take you from the dirt, and bring you up above,
Drain it off transfusion, different way to be
Sorrow passed my way, I did not shed a tear knew it would be okay.
Going to make you shine so beautiful tonight
Going to make you shine so bright tonight

Now you are free take flight in me
Now you are free take flight in me
Walked through the flowers, passed thought of you,
Did not see one in bloom all dead laying dry they have died
Just wash it from my mind and tear it from my sign,
Only the husk of your remains ain't it a shame
Going to make you shine so beautiful tonight
Going to make you shine so bright tonight
