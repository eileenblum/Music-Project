Stormcrow gather ye' round
Feel my call to thee
I watch as the clouds gather
Roaring thunder tremor though me
Lightning strike down my foe

Bellowing from deep inside this Earth
Feelings that run to rebirth
from the light to the blight

And into the dark we go unnoticed
Fleeting like the shadows that are
All around us
Visions to see. Come with me

Oh! Storm master
Granted the most ugly thing
Fata Morgana
Hidden city of the clouds
Revealed from your misty shroud
To take hold of me, and bring
Me to thee!

Bleak God! Death God!

Behold bearer of blackest might
I shall give thee thy sight to see
Swallowed by the Great Mystery
To conceive Sorcery
Eternally, in Fata Morgana
