Bones and their ashes
Gathered as Luna passes
Sticken thirteen lashes!

Speak, mighty Raven
Grant me a hidden haven
So all is laid in rest!

Thrice, I knock to Death
To be conjured from the depths
And command the spirits inside us!

As they gather
Traversing farther
Speak ancient father
channel me your visions

Widdershins I stalk
Reversed Sun black walk
Inscribed in red chalk
The scribes of the pale hawk

Ripped from all time
Treading the depths of my mind
I shalt begin to find
The lost tomes left behind

Bastions of Death
Hordes of whores
Thou who wars

Shine 'pon me
Ancient one
Oh, Lilith
Who art so fine

Grant to me
Your cosmic ecstasy
My heart, bleeds for thee

So come down
Burn with me
We are one
Can't you see?

Attack hungry ones
Join with me, darkened Sun
Be of my burning desire
And grant to me your willful fire

Old Wolf hear my call
The fairest of them all
