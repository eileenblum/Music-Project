Burning witches
Undoing stitches
Casting hexes
Crushing vestige

Slaying Abel
Been enabled
Spilling blood
On this soil

Death's pale horse
From the North
Dragged to Hell
At the funeral bell
From birth to Death

Destroyer temple
Blackened ash charred
Raped and gutted
Slut beheaded

Fire burn me
I have shown thee
My souls reliving

To the Gods below
And above us
