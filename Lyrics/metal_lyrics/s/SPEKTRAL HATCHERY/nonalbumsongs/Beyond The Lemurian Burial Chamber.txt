So they marched
To forever
Blinded by
Their own lies

Starlight guide
Me through the Void
Nameless Light
To thine eyes

Ancient Pharaoh
I kneel before
Thee!

Tear my brow
Show me the visions of
Old!

Scary the stone
Breaking the bone
See the past
And what's to become

Spektars Will
So go forth now
Send to them
Your cosmic Sorceries (Mysteries)

Soon the stars heed Tiphereth!
