Now enter your master
Feed your eyes
Dictum of disaster
Truth of spite

[Chorus:]
Come and rape me sane
Belong to feeble race
Of what I'll never see
My silence... Still alive

Now and then faster
To love decline
Martyr of palster
Human form divine

[Chorus:]
Come and rape me sane
Belong to feeble race
Of what I'll never see
My silence... Still alive

Nein love lost, domination
Why? Flesh devours mind
Deny, I never have wept

Now enter your master
Feed your eyes
Dictum of disaster
Truth of spite

[Chorus:]
Come and rape me sane
Belong to feeble race
Of what I'll never see
My silence... Still alive
