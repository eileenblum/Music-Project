City hot as hell
Hysterical, cast your spell
The endless road, another night
To bend your mind

Daring no escape
From this social rape
Manic! All tearing loose
Shattered body screams abuse

[Chorus:]
Agonizing society [2x]

Downlow nightmare just another day

Waiting dread
To take your life
Bloody hands
To pray out it fright

Evil index
Tensive clinic death
Punishment to gain

Limbs removal
Call suicide
Bags of blood
Mercy killing

Death and destruction all around
Minds are razed to the ground
Nerves on edge
Paranoia is near
Explain the growing sorrow
Years by years

[Chorus:]
Agonizing society [2x]
