Panzerman' battle cry
Colder Blood, Damned by
Ephemeral hostility
Vapourgods, Blitzkrieg

"Do you believe"?
Red  Golgotha' sneer
On my bitter trail
Let crimson blood spill

Under a gunmetal sky
Silent brain locked tight
In the name of noone
Ach, Du, History survives

The absurd skeleton
Feast for the mind
Warfare camouflaged
Corpse, Silent mime

[Chorus:]
New Day arising and nothing is clear [4x]

Panzerman' battle cry
Colder Blood, Damned by
Ephemeral hostility
Vapourgods, Blitzkrieg

Under a gunmetal sky
Silent brain locked tight
In the name of noone
Engines of the night

War...to end all pains!
