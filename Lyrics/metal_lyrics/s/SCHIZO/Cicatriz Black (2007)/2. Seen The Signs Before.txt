It's wrapping fog into chaos
New fawn upon the earth
Ashes of generation
Smell of nowhere

[Chorus:]
Ghost of my soul
Seen the signs before

Iron thorns (Of) The pale aeon
Consumed (By) My own disgust
Runes of termination
To be, to burn, their gods

[Chorus:]
Ghost of my soul
Seen the signs before

If hope has words were spoken
Ringin' in the spirit of a spell

[Chorus:]
Ghost of my soul
Seen the signs before

I believe this
It is and nothin' more
On winds apart
To all those hearin' not.
