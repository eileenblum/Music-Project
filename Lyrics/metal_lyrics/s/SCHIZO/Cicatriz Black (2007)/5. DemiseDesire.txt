Blood demented lust of death
The sky turns black so near
Indications above the ground
Smiling at your fear

[Chorus:]
Death is their only desire [2x]

Infected breath reappears the plague
The sign of inthoxication
Morbid erosion tearing of flesh
One thousand mutilations

[Chorus:]
Death is their only desire [2x]

Look down the grace of spell
The iron works the magic
Trapped in pain by hypnotic trance
The end will be so tragic

[Chorus:]
Death is their only desire [2x]

Death is their only... [5x] ...Desire.
