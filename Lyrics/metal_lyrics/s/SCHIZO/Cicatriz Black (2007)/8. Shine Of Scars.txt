Black snow of flies
Rip open the skies of anger
Drain or slide
Superior crime re-painted

Divine eyes
The worst of lies
Sore body licked raw
The shine of scars

The real in us is silent
Father of ceremony violent
Fake gleam of life
Ãbermensch disguised

Divine eyes
The worst of lies
Sore body licked raw...

How many worms to creep
As my hurt is built
And killing my days
Come pull my nails
As evil lives beyond the grace [2x]

Black snow of flies
Rip open the skies of anger
Drain or slide
Superior crime re-painted

Divine eyes
The worst of lies
Sore body licked raw
The shine of scars

Die
The shine of scars
Die
The shine of scars
Mine
The shine of scars
