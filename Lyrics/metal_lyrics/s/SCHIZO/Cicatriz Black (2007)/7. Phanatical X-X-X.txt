My adrenaline flows
As no shadow grows
Dreams in rhyme with nightmare
Burnt illusion madness fries
Now it's coming your decline

[Chorus:]
Phanatical!
The faith will rise again

Flashing into your tears
Flashing into your mental fear
Beating down under my flesh
The stench of death is near

[Chorus:]
Phanatical!
The faith will rise again
