TRAP MY BODY â REJECTION OF THE ELEMENTS
SPASMODIC MOVEMENTS
AFFLICTION COMES WITH MY TORMENT
PALE HARD LOOK â LOWER ABNORMALITIES
HALLUCINATION GORE FILLS THE MINDâS GRAVE
MANIPULATED SHOCKS PULL ME DOWN
UNVOICED SCREAMS CRYINâ ALOUD
WHITE HORIZON IS WHAT I CAN SEE
SENSES IN MOURNING â DEAD PHOBIC DRAIN
NOW IâM STANDING WITH MY HEAD ON THE WALL
EVERYTHING LIES AND EVERYTHING CRAWLS
UNDEFINED TRANCE â MENTAL DISORDER
FADING THE LIGHT â A NEW ORDER
EMPTY MIND â ABSENT
SHAPELESS LIFE â ABSENT
I WILL NOT BEG TO YOU
FOR WHAT I CANNOT HOLD
WITH CLEAR PERCEPTIONS MY DESTINY UNFOLDS
ONWARD YOU ADVANCE, LEFT IN A MINDLESS TRANCE
HYPTNOTIZED BY YOUR WILL, DESIRE IS NOW INSTILLED
THERE IS A NERVE INSIDE YOUR HEAD
CONTROL YOUR MIND UNTIL YOU ARE DEAD
DERANGED MEMORIES
STILL BURNING IN YOUR BRAIN
SHATTERED MIND IN THE PRESENCE OF PAIN
CANTâ FACE REALITY
UNRESTRAINED SUBCONSCIOUS
HIDING FROM THE DARKNESS OF YOUR INSANITY
THERE IS A NERVE INSIDE YOUR HEAD
CONTROL YOUR MIND UNTIL YOU ARE DEAD
EMPTY MIND â ABSENT
SHAPELESS LIFE â ABSENT
