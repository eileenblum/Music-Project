I'm gonna make ya pay for all
The times you've cheated and lied
The more I give the more you take
Now in blood you pay the price

Make her bleed slowly
Make her gladlily die

Twisted conscience of yer sins
Ripping inside your holy flesh
Sick desire deranged wish
You're to blame no reject

What terrible does she hide
Later maybe I wonder why

Make her bleed slowly
Make her gladlily die

Burning hate nothin' left to say
The grimace on her face was grim and gray

The butcher's caress draws ya near
No time feel the final fear
