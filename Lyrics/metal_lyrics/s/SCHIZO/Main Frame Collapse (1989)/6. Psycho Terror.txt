I am like a cancer
Rotting you from the inside
Hypnotic presence
Trapped in your mind
Morbid frustation
The ruler of your life

Forcing evil - Spreding death
Overshadow - Born to wreck
Blind sensation - Out of hand
Drilling brain - All you get

Psycho terror [3x]

Your awakening - From the trance
I'm the medium - Not a judge
Normal life - Not for you
Must obey - Holy due

Psycho terror [3x]

Keeper - Turning you into somebody else
Terror - Falling in the grip of fear
Parasite - Controlling you and your mind
Lobotomy - Total scleriosis the you... Die

Forcing evil - Spreding death
Overshadow - Born to wreck
Blind sensation - Out of hand
Drilling brain - All you get

Your awakening - From the trance
I'm the medium - Not a judge
Normal life - Not for you
Must obey - Holy due

I am like a cancer
Rotting you from the inside
Hypnotic presence
Trapped in your mind
Morbid frustation
The ruler of your life
