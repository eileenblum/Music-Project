Out of chaos came the earth
Noontide of seventh aeon

Voices from the threshold stone
The melancholy waters lie
Voices from the threshold stone
My soul was a stagnant tide

Dying swan by Southern lakes
Sings its wild death song

Voices from the threshold stone
My ruin moulders into rest
Voices from the threshold stone
Tempt me not with glory possessed
