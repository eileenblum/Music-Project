âHe who has never seen
The daylight peer
Into a darkened room...â

Rise!
To raise man from secret darkness [3x]

Manâs will is a floating shadow
In the mind that he conceives
And the rights of mankind pass
(And) perish like the autumn leaves

Rise!
To raise man from secret darkness

A conscious slumber seems to take
And would not, for the world, awake!

Fate has ways we cannot change
While weakness preys upon our will
We support with excuse the self
(And) help fate ourselves to kill!

The reason why the soul exists
Is folded in the soul itself
No painting could its essence show
Nor manifest its real self

Dust-layers of the globe
Immortals (on) the iblis path
We dwell alone (in) a world of moan
With pain that shall not part...
