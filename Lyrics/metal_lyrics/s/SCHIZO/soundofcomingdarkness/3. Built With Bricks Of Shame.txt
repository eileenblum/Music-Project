Deaf! Infiniteâs ear calling
Back! Into The chamber turning
My soul! Within me burning

Echoes! Of the vilest disorder
Forms! Discordant I canât recover
Tears! That drip all over

We, like infants descend
In our shadows, on the earth
Like a weak, mortal birth
My eyes, more and more
Like a sea without shore
Continue expanding
The heavens commanding...

Could I but be consumed
And pass from timeâs memory
Into the emptiness of nowhere

âThe dead so soon grow coldâ
Now I will arise and strip me of time and space

I must create a system
Or be enslaved by another manâs
I will not reason and compare
My business is to create...

With bricks of shame
Built with bricks of shame

[Repeat first verse]

Eternity rolled wide apart
At the end of our path
