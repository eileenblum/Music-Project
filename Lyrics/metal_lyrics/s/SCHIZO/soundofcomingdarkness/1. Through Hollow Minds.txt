Through the pale door
An evil step be taken
The dead is forsaken
Ties eternal broken

âAnd thus the sad soul that here passes
Beholds it but through darkened glassesâ

Ask the blind worm
Secrets of the tomb

Unseen rivers
Waters of human tears
Dying hour
Pain I could not feel

Through hollow minds
It takes death to love life
Through hollow minds
The timeless measuring of time

Hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand

A chaos of deep passion
Mute fear of things unseen
Sounds of coming darkness
Of beings that have been
