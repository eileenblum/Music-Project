New idols crawl among the thought's ruins
Darkened minds fall into decay
Overshadowing hallucinations
Black clouds of plague - Conspiracy

Paralyzed by the claws of fear
Dogmatized martyr sociopath
Annihilated mental flesh
Truth denied
Dead reflections
They violate the shapes of fate...
Through your death!

Secret faces of inner terror
Whisper unknown visions of the vile
Overdramatic minds manipulators
Creating the artifice of lunacy

Paralyzed by the claws of fear
Stigmatized civilized psychopath
Annihilate your mental flesh
Truth denied
Dead reflections
They violate the shapes of fate
Mass hypnosis
Dying inception
Through your death!

Time stands still in the faded age of deformations
Rise the will to serve a god of self-destruction

One by one - Anaesthetic lies for enthralled creatures
You're like a sleeping child
That will see no future
Twisting up by the grip of frustrations
The breeds apart of false beliefs
Begin their not visible terror show

Leaders... Of... Deception

Paralyzed by the claws of fear
Dogmatized martyr sociopath
Annihilated mental flesh
Truth denied
Dead reflections
Mass hypnosis
Dying inception
Through your death!
