A devious endeavour
Hypnotic terror squad
It roams, wherever
Masochistic ways - Low life to scar with infected lyrics
Blood runs over the body
Void in their eyes
A pain that never cries
Slogans in the language of the weak
Mind lethal melodies

Neurotic propaganda
Hear no sounds - decay!

The herd disruption - Global vice control
Aberration - Cryptic
No salvation - Skeletal words
Obey as your mind dissolves
Listenable force
New levels of pain
Music for the end of times
Idiomatic collapse of the soul
Masked word of mouth

Neurotic propaganda
Aphonic nervous days
When the disharmony comes true
And it bursts into silence
Generates a staring spell
On nonempathic worlds of pale

You have no way out to save your lives
You don't feel the need to look behind

Death transmission - Propagation - Coalition - Infectious code
Raised icons from the chasm spread their wings to mass control

Neurotic propaganda
Devouring from inside

Mortified in suffering
Decontrolled mind disease
Paradox rules your brains
Intellect dies
