Mortifying temptations
Sick forgiveness
Stench of life
Rise the livid from within
Lysergic unchained spoils
Purified obsession
Wreck the seal of innocence
An intoxicated mind
Reborn through ashes of subconscious terrors

It brings me forever
Where the sun hadn't lost its black core
Into a rotten spiral

Abscence of death
Craving for an end
The shadow's remains
Will fall with no direction

Behind the light dead pay the price
Of a crowd of fears and deepest vice
Cyclical fates
I hear them calling from the depths

Save me from this no way game
Faith implodes
Feel the pain
Regression

Lower
Sinking in a no vertical downward fall inside
Illusive death
The dark beholds
Liquid wounds painted on my body
Hollow within
In the lair of sorrow concentric pains twist the mind
Misery
It rules this aeon
Shattered frames of this maimed life

Into a rotten spiral
Into a rotten spiral
Into a rotten spiral
Into a rotten spiral

Echoes of demise
Blindly the shapes fall
Into a rotten spiral
Fatalistic prey
Vertigo has taken my soul
Into a rotten spiral
Echoes of demise
Blindly the shapes fall
Into a rotten spiral
Fatalistic prey
Vertigo has taken my soul
Into a rotten spiral
