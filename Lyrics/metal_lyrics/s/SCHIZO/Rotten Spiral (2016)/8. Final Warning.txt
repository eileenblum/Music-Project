Self-infliction of lunacy
Chaotic creation - Infinite division
Their convictions - Why can't my mind be spared

Message that I'm still learning,
Haunted by reality - I cannot bear the pain
The hand of darkness steals, steals your dying breath

Led by deceivers
Casting all to eternal pain
Led by deceivers
Reaching out to sick and slaves

Inner brain mutations
Deeper and stronger - Incepted illusion
Feel your mind about to crack

System compromised
Across my minds the pattern rolls
A sick fragile cycle from which no one is saved

Led by deceivers
Casting all to eternal pain
Led by deceivers
Reaching out to sick and slaves

Final warning

Inside the rules - In a permanent daze
Feelings of angst - This primitive stance
The stagnant illusion of change
A flattened form of death... On their own terms

Final warning

Led by deceivers
Casting all to eternal pain
Led by deceivers
Reaching out to sick and slaves
