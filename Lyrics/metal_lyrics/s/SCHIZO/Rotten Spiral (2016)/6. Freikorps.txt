One as in the deepest interstice of doom
Celebrate the shining art of sin
Desperation from above
Nightmares are so real

Outliving aside
Dead flesh burns away
Gloom devours bodies in nameless graves
When morality has lost all forgiveness

No reason to live
No reason to hide
In this hell
Where you can lie

Time warps
Fears die
Bowed corpse
Darkness derides

Outliving aside
Dead flesh burns away
Gloom devours bodies in nameless graves
When morality has lost all forgiveness

No reason to live
No reason to hide
In this hell
Where you can lie

Time warps
Fears die
Bowed corpse
Darkness derides

The pain descends
Duality of pleasures
Destroying the seed of mankind
Ultra-violence dimension

Downbeat spree
Forged second skin
Low brutality
Overcome reactions

Crawling lies of distorted life
Mutilation game
Agonized repulsion
Freikorps
