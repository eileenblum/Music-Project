Victim of inflicted pain
Controlled by the limit of this strangulated life
Generated from chaos of hell
Reborn through the cut of a sublime knife
In a hollow cave the body of a looser lies
The blood covers his crown of thorns
Irrational - Deviation loves torment forever where dwells the hysterical god

Judgment sky of fire and gold
Leading nature to clean our lies
Desperate eyes reach the creeping dark
Waiting an expected savior of life
In a turning dust a serpent to lead us
Through the shadow that covers his throne
Infamous - Vicious - Circle of euphoria
Lies there on my hysterical god

Days of cold silence - From the depths it comes through
Vile panic - Morbid reactions rip the veins of the untrue
Now all days die - Cruel law inside

Madness - Insanity - Cynical mind - Oppression
Feed the pain and sacrifice my obsession
Not knowing what's the truth - Listen to the lethal feeble voice
Torment is upon me and I'm screaming aloud
Now all days die - Cruel law inside
Light breaks in a hole - The sky is open and blood flows

Victim of an inflicted pain
Controlled by the limit of this strangulated life
Generated from chaos of hell
Reborn through the cut of a sublime knife
In a hollow cave the body of a looser lies
The blood covers his crown of thorns
Irrational - Deviation loves torment forever where dwells the hysterical god
There will be forevermore
I deny my hysterical god
