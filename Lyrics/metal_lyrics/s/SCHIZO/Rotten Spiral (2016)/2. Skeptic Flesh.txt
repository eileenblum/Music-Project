Rot to the core and bow down when memories get wrong
Mortified - Crawling dead
Drastic world slow drowns
Sworn to the unknown
Lies in myself my nonentity
Emotions of death
Bleeding again
This will be my exhumation

Skeptic flesh

Nailed down amputations
Tearing corpses side by side
Contemplation of damnation
Beat the scars of holy flesh
Raping spree - Elected shrouds
More grey dead are joining us
Putrid father of no tomorrow
Torn to pieces - Infectious sorrow

Skeptic flesh
Blood to gain

Now you are mine
The spreading of your eyes
Come to me - Depths frustration
Next victim - Bound to wicked

Nailed down amputations
Tearing corpses side by side
Contemplation of damnation
Beat the scars of holy flesh
Raping spree - Elected shrouds
More grey dead are joining us
Emotions of death
Bleeding again
This is my exhumation... On your skeptic flesh
