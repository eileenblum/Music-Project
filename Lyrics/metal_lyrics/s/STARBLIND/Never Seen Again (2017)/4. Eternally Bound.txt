My friend you were the light of my childhood
Through fear you held my hand

But then one day your life was no more
As you were taken from me

As days go on the pain and suffering grows stronger
As time passes by

When silence falls and I'm all alone
I remember with tears in my eyes

We laughed and we cried, we stood side by side
We danced and we sang in the rain
Your smile may be gone, but the memory remains
And someday I will see you again

The hopes and dreams we shared on our journey
Are now gone with the wind

Your time ran out before I could tell you
How much you mean to me

I will go on and live as you taught me
With fire in my heart

Wait and see, I will be the hero
You always were for me

We laughed and we cried, we stood side by side
We danced and we sang in the rain
Your smile may be gone, but the memory remains
And someday I will see you again
I will honor your name for the rest of my days
Then we'll be eternally bound

We laughed and we cried, we stood side by side
We danced and we sang in the rain
Your smile may be gone, but the memory remains
And someday I will see you again
I will honor your name for the rest of my days
Then we'll be eternally bound

Your smile may be gone, but the memory remains
And someday I will see you again
