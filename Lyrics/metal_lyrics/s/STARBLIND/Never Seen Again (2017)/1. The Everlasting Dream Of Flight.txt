Made in his image, the gift of flight was all denied
Gazing at the birds our man was filled with god-like pride
To bask in his glory is but given to few
But accept it, it didn't go through
On the verge to achieving his dreams
A new world above the clouds

And the visions in his mind
Will lead the way

Touch the sun, reach for the sky
Fly high above the clouds
Spread your wings from dusk into dawn
Soar to another world

Determined as he builds another new machine
No food, no sleep as the days turn into weeks
Pride consumes him, he's losing his mind
Denying the truth, that man cannot fly
To accept it, he would rather die
Than living a life on the ground

Will the image in his mind
Be realised

Touch the sun, reach for the sky
Fly high above the clouds
Spread your wings from dusk into dawn
Soar to another world

Watch as the human bird takes flight
Then falls to his grave
Now released from flesh and bone
He can

Touch the sun, reach for the sky
Fly high above the clouds
Spread your wings from dusk into dawn
Soar to another world
