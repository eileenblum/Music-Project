Walking along a dark lonesome road
With only the moonlight to guide him
The peaceful sound of silence echoes in his head

When suddenly a roaring he hears
He turns around in fright
Like two glowing eyes in the dark it appears before him

The demon rider
Descendant from hell

In the city streets at night
Steam is rising from the sewers
The sound of screaming tires break the silent air

Her heart's pounding faster now
There's nowhere left to run
Frozen in the headlights, death is coming soon

The demon rider
Descendant from hell

A life was ended here tonight
When metal met bone on the sidewalk
It will not end; he'll kill again, one more for the road

The demon rider
Descendant from hell

He rides again and again and again
