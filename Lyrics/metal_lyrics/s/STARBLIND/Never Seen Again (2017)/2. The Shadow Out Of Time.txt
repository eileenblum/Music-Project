Eight years of torn illusions
A dream from distant lands
Is this a vision from my past
Another time another place
The days they pass before me
My mind will soon reveal
Is this a quest for wisdom
That we all shall fear

I saw their ancient cities
Even though I wasn't there
Reflections from the archives
Now buried in the sand
I hope one day they all could
See who I really am
That I haven't lost my mind
I'm a traveller in time

Transcending life

The shadow out of time
Out of time
The shadow out of time
Out of time
Out of time
The shadow out of time

I saw their ancient cities
Even though I wasn't there
Reflections from the archives
Now buried in the sand
Out on my final journey
The answers lie below
The book revealed the secrets
But my truth will never be heard

Transcending life

The shadow out of time
Out of time
The shadow out of time
Out of time
Out of time
The shadow out of time

Transcending life
Transcending life
Transcending life

The shadow out of time
Out of time
The shadow out of time
Out of time
Out of time
The shadow out of time
Out of time
