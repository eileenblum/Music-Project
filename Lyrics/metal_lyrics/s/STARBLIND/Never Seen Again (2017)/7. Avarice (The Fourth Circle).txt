Greed corrupts and destroys
It burns down our homes and takes our lives
You, you want it all
You want it fast and you want it now
Alas, no price is too high
To get what you crave, you signed with your life
Fool, it can't be undone
The contract is sealed and so is your fate

Run, run for your life and your soul
The reaper will find where you are
You can't hide
When deals are made in blood
The devil will show who you are
Run for your life

Run, run for your life and your soul
The reaper will find where you are
You can't hide
When deals are made in blood
The devil will show who you are
Run for your life

Soon you will realize
The blessing received was truly a curse
Death will not be the end
There is no escape from what you have done
Hell is where you will stay
Eternally damned and fighting for gold
See and understand
This is the price you have to pay

Run, run for your life and your soul
The reaper will find where you are
You can't hide
When deals are made in blood
The devil will show who you are
Run for your life

Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce
Of goods that are committed unto fortune
For which the human race each other buffet

For all the gold that is beneath the moon
Or ever has been, of these weary souls
Could never make a single one repose
