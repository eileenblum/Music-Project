Brave men set out to sea in the year 1845
Sent by their king's demand to explore the arctic ice

Course set to north by north deep into the far unknown
Sailing to what became their last voyage on the seas

No one knew they would never return
No one knew they would never come home
And they sailed tall and proud
With strong winds under blue skies
But they would never come home

Cold air runs through the sails
The sea flowing blue in the sun
Proud to be part of this plan
To map uncharted lands

Little did they know they would not return
Brewing in the distance a force of nature
When the storm was over their ship was bogged down
In the land of ice and snow

And they know they would never return
And they know they would never come home
All attempts to break free from the ice were all in vain
And they were never seen again

And they know they would never return
And they know they would never come home
And they sawed down their mast to heat the frozen crew
But they would never come home

And they know they would never return
And they know they would never come home
As their blood turned to ice
As they froze to their deaths
They knew they would never come home
