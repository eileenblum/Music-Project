You sailed across the ocean to reach those distant lands
Where no one's ever been before
You scaled the tallest mountains to raise the flag of your beliefs
Solitude was your reward

So long you yearn for fame and fortune
One hundred thousand miles to go
How will you ... silence
Will you surrender ...

Another space, another time
Another prize to leave behind
For the pride and the glory
Set the goals and risk your life
As you're reaching for the sky
Who needs the pride and the glory

The fire's burning in your heart
In just a moment you'll depart
Leaving everything behind
Who'll be the fool to follow
Who calls it bravery
Talking big and doing small

So long you've yearned for fame and fortune
One hundred thousand miles to go

Another space, another time
Another prize to leave behind
For the pride and the glory
Set the goals and risk your life
As you're reaching for the sky
Who needs the pride and the glory

'Cause you cannot fight the silence
When all is said and done
No one remembers who you are

One harsh awakening
You'll have to face another quest
Put your life back on the line
It's what's keeping you alive

Another space, another time
Another prize to leave behind
For the pride and the glory
Set the goals and risk your life
As you're reaching for the sky
Who needs the pride and the glory

Another space, another time
For the pride and the glory
For the pride and the glory
