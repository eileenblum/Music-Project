When the skies are turning red I know that I'm alive
When battle's imminent I know what lies ahead
When the bell strikes I see terror in their eyes
It is a thrilling feeling that I can't describe

Oh mighty roar, fill the air and shake the ground
Pray the gods are on my side

The time will come and the wars I fought with bravery
Will clear the path and lead me to my destiny

Wisdom came to me as I lay dying on the field
Among the wayward spirits of a thousand men
Will I forever haunt the place of my demise
Voices are calling me to join them in the light

Oh mighty lord, will you greet me when I come
Open up the gates and let me in

The time will come and the wars I fought with bravery
Will clear the path and lead me to my destiny

All my life I have been a soldier
I followed orders, my heart grew colder
I fought for glory but now I realize
I could have been someone else entirely
Make people happy instead of sorry
Life is short and we only get one chance

The time will come and the wars I fought with bravery
Will clear the path and lead me to my destiny
One day my allegiance will bring me to my victory
Curse my soul, let me pay for my sins
