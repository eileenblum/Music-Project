A storm is coming, a march of the dead
Beyond the rivers, the forests ahead
Their war cry echo in the distance away
Risen from earth's open grave

We're few in numbers but strong in our hearts
We will defend what's ours standing tall
They're coming closer to conquer us all
But we will answer the call

Prepare for what to come with the battle drawing near
Rain is pouring down, the ground turns into mud
We sense the growing fear
We await the darkness, we will show them light
In our hearts we feel the fire
There's no turning back

We hear the battle cries, we are standing side by side
One thousand men with swords held high in position
Just waiting for the sign
The smell of fear, the vengeance in our eyes
When the charge begins we are saints, we fear no life

Read us a prayer, far from the beast below
The fallen one who do us wrong
Read us a prayer, make it so our voice be heard
By the holy father above

The raid starts and our men are falling to the ground
Striking first, they got the numbers
"No surrender, fight with all you've got!"
No cry for mercy will we give our foe
In the end our last man standing will prevail with glory in his hand

Read us a prayer, far from the beast below
The fallen one who do us wrong
Read us a prayer, make it so our voice be heard
By the holy father above
