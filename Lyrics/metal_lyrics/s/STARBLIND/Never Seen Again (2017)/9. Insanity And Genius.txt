The answer appeared for your eyes
All of those signs came alive
Enlightenment will lead you away
Divine inceptions
What if the truth lies ahead
Are you the one to create
Sadness and tears in their eyes
For all eternity

Some say there's a line
Between space and time
Can you see the writings
Deep in their minds

Insanity and genius
Eternity and fate
The blind will follow paths that you create
Insanity and genius
For lust and devious play
Who's the fool when nothing else makes sense

The masses await your command
Whatever they hear they'll obey
The flames keep on burning
They fall to their knees
It's all they know
With your powers you can create
A world full of empty shells
They're too weak to make a stand
They'll be gone and forgotten

Some say there's a line
Between space and time
Can you see the writings
Deep in their minds

Insanity and genius
Eternity and fate
The blind will follow paths that you create
Insanity and genius
For lust and devious play
Who's the fool when nothing else makes sense

Insanity and genius
Eternity and fate
The blind will follow paths that you create
Insanity and genius
For lust and devious play
Who's the fool when nothing else makes sense
