I see them all, the wonders of the world.
If I close my eyes,they appear as crystal tears

Make it fly, bring it down
Tears of joy under falling rain
Plant the seed twisting vines
Writhing in pain

Darkness it fades, I start to see the light
Festering wounds deep within my mind

Make it fly, bring it down
Tears of joy under falling rain
Plant the seed twisting vines
Writhing in pain

So cold, so dark, so full of fright
I bear witness to your creation
All must shatter apart

With suffering I bring
The world to its knees.
Fear my love and hate
As I bring you the end
Of time
It now ends
By my hand
By my will

What is and once was
A perception of reality
Some seek good, some seek evil
I am all
