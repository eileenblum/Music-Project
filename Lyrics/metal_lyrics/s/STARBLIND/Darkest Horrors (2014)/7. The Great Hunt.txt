Born of the wildland is she
Hellenic goddess of the hunt
Sister to the bringer of light
Eldest daughter to our father of might

Symbols of the stag and crescent moon
Was carved into an ancient rune

Captured by a river flowing in vain
The enraged titan son struggles in pain
Now you all die

Now trapped and infuriated by their pleadings
A great power is drawn from within
Provoked by the folly of lesser beings
Gravest of betrayal by closest of kin

Symbols of the stag and crescent moon
Was carved into an ancient rune

Captured by a river flowing in vain
The enraged titan son struggles in pain
Now you all die

Symbols of the stag and crescent moon
Was carved into an ancient rune

Captured by a river flowing in vain
The enraged titan son struggles in pain
Captured by a river flowing in vain
The enraged titan son struggles in pain
