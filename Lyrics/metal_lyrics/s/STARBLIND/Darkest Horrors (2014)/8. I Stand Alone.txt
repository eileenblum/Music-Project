The son of Atreus vowing his enemies to be burned
The gods not in favour casusing plaugue in the cantonment
On the ninth day of misery the daughter is returned
The son instead taking another for imprisonment

Two champions will meet and but one shall be slain

I stand alone
I stand alone
I stand alone
I stand alone

The gods were forbidden by their procreator to intervene
Ruler of the gods and of the sky and thunder
When the ban is lifted sorrow breaks the queen
Chaos is now wrought as of this most grievous blunder

Two champions will meet and one shall be slain

I stand alone
I stand alone
I stand alone
I stand alone

Two champions will meet and one shall be slain

I stand alone
I stand alone
I stand alone
I stand alone
