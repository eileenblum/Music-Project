Gateway to a desert entrance at avaris
Almighty power rules divine
Denial of your rule brings death and all shall relish

Bring us the power we need
Our pain and suffering we feed
Father and son of nothing and all
Our faith in you will prevail

As the stars now align
Sky so blue turns red
Light is now confined
Bringer of dissolution now dead

Brightness now shines in the dark
Sky so blue turns red
That whats coming is unknown
A burning inferno lights the spark

Bring us the power we need
Our pain and suffering we feed
Father and son of nothing and all
Our faith in you will prevail

As the stars now align
Sky so blue turns red
Light is now confined
Bringer of dissolution now dead

Determined by fate
Your doom as been sealed
We burn it all to the ground
Your faith is now revealed
