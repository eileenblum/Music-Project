Trying to withstand it all moving noward
Undesired decretes of insanity
Certitude demanding stipulation
Your will is not my command to give

Charasteristic lies and deceit
Tell not the truth whispering serpents
Cover the lies in blood
Cover the lies in shame
Cover the lies in death

Self proclaimed masters deluded by their twisted cult
Illustrious knaves champions and masters of fable
Demanding sacrifice from us a great insult
Deranged beings bare the mark of the sibyl

Charasteristic lies and deceit
Tell not the truth whispering serpents
Cover the lies in blood
Cover the lies in shame
Cover the lies in death

Conquered not by force but faith
Piece by piece we are torn asunder
All are cursed under this heavy weight
Now awake the hero from his slumber

Circumvention aspersion we are besmirched
Defiled and stained by dishonorous villains

Now the world awakes to see its already been done
The foundation is gone all that is left is ashes
What we once had now taken away and gone
Crying in pain wounded flesh by giant lashes

Charasteristic lies and deceit
Tell not the truth whispering serpents
Cover the lies in blood
Cover the lies in shame
Cover the lies in death

Conquered not by force but faith
Piece by piece we are torn asunder
All are cursed under this heavy weight
Now awake the hero from his slumber
