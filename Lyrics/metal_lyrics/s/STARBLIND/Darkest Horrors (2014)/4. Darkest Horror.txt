A slimy expanse of hellish black mire
As far as the eye can see
Rotten beings portruding through the mud
An unending plan full of sickening blood

Withdrawal of the sea exposing hidden revulsion

Insanity salvation
A thing of nightmares emerges from the water
Carry on flee on into the night
The mariner he cannot bare loosing his mind

The marines story none shall believe
For the petty human race he now grieve
He fear what may rise above the billows
To drag it all down leaving none but willows

Withdrawal of the sea exposing hidden revulsion

Insanity salvation
A thing of nightmares emerges from the water
Carry on flee on into the night
The mariner he cannot bare loosing his mind

One day the land shall sink and the dark
Ocean floor shall ascend bearing dagons mark

Insanity salvation
A thing of nightmares emerges from the water
Carry on flee on into the night
The mariner he cannot bare loosing his mind

Insanity salvation
A thing of nightmares emerges from the water
Carry on flee on into the night
The mariner he cannot bare loosing his mind
