Climbing a mountain high
To face my fears alone
A morbid sense of curiosity
Drives me to the wonders of my dreams

Black bubbling ooze
Madness is my saviour

Antarctic exploration
Ancient scrolls of evil say
Star spawn and elder things
After eons passed we are still the child

I know where I must go
My dreams gives me no peace
The mountain it calls for me
Horror it urges me on

Black bubbling ooze
Madness is my saviour

Antarctic exploration
Ancient scrolls of evil say
Star spawn and elder things
After eons passed we are still the child
