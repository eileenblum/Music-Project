Crossing a line into the unknown
Blood turns to ice, shadows in disguise
The smell of oil and smoke in the air
With burnt out cars leading to the beasts lair
A beast not an animal but man
With a gathering so mighty and grand

Straying from the path, no place to hide
Running away with fear in his eyes

Blood in the night, hide from his smite
Blood in the night, or die
Blood in the night, hide from his smite
Blood in the night, or die die die die

Letting loose on his prey in flight
Stare into their eyes full of fright
Rushing blood in veins flowing fast
Thrilling his mind as the hunt begins at last
Devouring flesh so tasty and sweet
Picked clean from bones, from men in the street

Blood in the night, hide from his smite
Blood in the night, or die
Blood in the night, hide from his smite
Blood in the night, or die die die die

Ruling the streets with all of his might
Darkness has come now gone is the light
A feast at the table of filth will begin
Gnawing on limbs with torn off skin
Sometimes cooked over an open fire
Sometimes eaten raw depending on desire

Straying from the path, no place to hide
Running away with fear in his eyes

Blood in the night, hide from his smite
Blood in the night, or die
Blood in the night, hide from his smite
Blood in the night, or die
Blood in the night [8x]
Or die die die die
