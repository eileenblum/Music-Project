Screams of pain in the dark
SomethingsÂ´s stirring, Hearts full of fear
A sense of forebodingÂ´s felt
But whatÂ´s coming is still for us unclear

Great old one unshackled Aphoom-Zhah

Fire and flames
Death it now reigns
Fire and flames
Cleansing our souls

Behind a wall of eternal doubt
Cracking thunder, on the horizon
We shall learn what pain is all about
He comes, he nears, he strikes from the sky!

Fire and flames
Death it now reigns
Fire and flames
Cleansing our souls

Great old one unshackled Aphoom-Zhah

Fire and flames
Death it now reigns
Fire and flames
Cleansing our souls
