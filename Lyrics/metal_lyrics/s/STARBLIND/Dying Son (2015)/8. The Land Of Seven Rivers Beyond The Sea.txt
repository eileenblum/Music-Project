The blue river runs deep collecting souls of the fallen
The Southern plains basked in sunlight
The blue river runs deep collecting souls of the fallen

Souls of the fallen
Souls of the fallen

As the first darkness came upon the world
The people were forced to retreat into the woods
In darkness men dwelled they survived and they thrived
Glorious cities were created and so it was fated

Homage was paid to the first Triglav
Many songs sang with great glory and joy
Homage was paid to the grandfathers of gods
Svarog, creator of the heavens and the land and sea

In the land of the seven rivers beyond the sea
Lived a people full of glory listen to their story
Creator of the sun, stars and earth now enshrined
Now witness the birth of an empire born Father of Tiverians

A second darkness came upon them all bringing a great storm of frost
Heading south to build a new with only but a few
The ones that stayed behind were so assigned, so it was fated

Homage was paid to the first Triglav
Many songs sang with great glory and joy
Homage was paid to the grandfathers of gods
Svarog, creator of the heavens and the land and sea

In the land of the seven rivers beyond the sea
Lived a people full of glory listen to their story
Creator of the sun, stars and earth now enshrined
Now witness the birth of an empire born Father of Tiverians

Homage was paid to the first Triglav
Many songs sang with great glory and joy

In the land of the seven rivers beyond the sea
Lived a people full of glory listen to their story
In the land of the seven rivers beyond the sea
Lived a people full of glory listen to their story

Creator of the sun, stars and earth now enshrined
Now witness the birth of an empire born Father of Tiverians
