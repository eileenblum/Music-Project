Dire portents over land and sea
Ravaging heathen men set me free
Set ablaze by our fire
All must die, peasant, king and friar

Blood red skies
Blood red skies

Taken as slaves, sold off as cattle
Over dark waters after battle
Set ablaze by our fire
All must die, peasant, king and friar

Blood red skies
Blood red skies
Blood red skies
Blood red skies

Of all who was taken but a few still live
Heathen men we do not forgive
Set ablaze by our fire
All must die, peasant, king and friar

Blood red skies
Blood red skies
Blood red skies
Blood red skies
Blood red sky
