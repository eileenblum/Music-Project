As an eagle sitting on the top of the tallest oaken tree
Sternly staring down on the world beneath
Veles the nemesis of him
The battle fought with gritted teeth

A golden beard rested on his chin
With eyes so dark as the deepest sin
Skyfather resides up in the clouds
Striking at the ground wrapped in shrouds

They were then thrown high up in the sky
Thrice a strike of lightning passing me by

One struck two grooms fair and young
Another a horse in a stable it was sung
The third six times one hundred wedding guests
In death they now can raise their protests

The figure was born bearing the mark of the wolves
THe three golden apples grown on mystic cloves
The firestone arrows granted by earth mother
Howling winds raging Perun the Skyfather

They were then thrown high up in the sky
Thrice a strike of lightning passing me by

One struck two grooms fair and young
Another a horse in a stable it was sung
The third six times one hundred wedding guests
In death they now can raise their protests

One struck two grooms fair and young
Another a horse in a stable it was sung
The third six times one hundred wedding guests
In death they now can raise their protests

Three golden apples he grabbed
In a sack at his back they were bagged
