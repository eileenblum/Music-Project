At New Year's Day in 1796 the first record has been done
A lighthouse somewhere in the northern sea the story has now begun

Solitude and time alone, getting what is wished for
All alone with a hound he was set ashore

While starting to write, echoing sounds in the wall
Keeps the watcher in enthrall
The second day it comes both wind and sea now calm
A wind so soft as the sweetest balm

Solitude and time alone, getting what is wished for
All alone with a hound they were set ashore

In the lighthouse
Nothing but a tomb
In the lighthouse
Impending doom

Below the level of the sea a hollow is found
With walls made of chalk it can be drowned
Questioning doubt will it stand or will it fall
This now written with a hand so scrawl

Solitude and time alone, getting what is wished for
All alone with a hound they were set ashore

In the lighthouse
Nothing but a tomb
In the lighthouse
Impending doom
