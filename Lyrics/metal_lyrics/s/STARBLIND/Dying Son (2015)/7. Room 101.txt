Self-righteous leaders in a world of torture and pain
It's original purpose forgotten, abandoned for power
The propaganda repeated over and over again
Stand straight and die or choose to live and cower

Time has come, you will now enter Room 101
Time has come, you will now enter Room 101

Contradictory meanings created for control
Confessions from a free mind implicating reality
Unpersons deleted dropped down in the memory hole
History re-written now made to suit the greater goal

Time has come, you will now enter Room 101
Time has come, you will now enter Room 101
