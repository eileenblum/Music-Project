Seven boys of age so young and
Seven girls so innocent
Forced by the tip of a bow strung
Then thrown of the ship for imprisonment

In honor to the god of the sea
His wife bearing the offspring of the bull
Proclaimed to slay the bull was he
With appetite for flesh of men so pitiful

The working and creations of the cleaver worker
In the darkest depths of the maze preys the lurker
