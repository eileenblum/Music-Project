An undying man a story he tells
Abandoned at young age raised by infidels
Brought up and raised by the tip of a sword
A learned mind influenced by their lord

Heavy stakes were used to bring fear
Impaled and raised up, shredding not a tear

See the sun one last time
The dead rise, bells will chime
See the sun one last time
The dead rise, bells will chime

As battle commence with a force so evil
Two legions will clash as the battle cries thrash
As night turns into dawn, the sun rises high
Victory's held, the time to strike is now

Heavy stakes were used to bring fear
Impaled and raised up, shredding not a tear

See the sun one last time
The dead rise, bells will chime
See the sun one last time
The dead rise, bells will chime
