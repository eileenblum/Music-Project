Watching the masses through a windows from within
So curious I follow him

Unable to decide is what fascinates
Being led forward like bait to dupe his trait
What crimes are he behind the wanderer a mystic find
A dagger at his side
Is what's making me worried

As evening falls the stalking begins
Throughout the night it goes on and on
Unnoticed to the pits of the poor he runs

Unable to decide is what fascinates
Being led forward like bait to dupe is his trait
What crimes are he behind the wanderer a mystic find
A dagger at his side

The man of the crowd
The man of the crowd
What is his purpose and where does he head
Where am I being led

Following the man until the day again bringt light

The man of the crowd
The man of the crowd
What is his purpose and where does he head
Where am I being led
