Awaken not, Hermaphrodite.
Do not wake yet, I beg you.
Why will you not believe me?
Sleep... Sleep forever. Sleep forever.

May your breast heave while pursuing the chimerical hope of happiness - That I allow you;
But do not open your eyes. Do not open your eyes!

I want to leave you thus, not to witness your awakening.

Perhaps one day, with the aid of a voluminous tome
and in moving pages I shall recount your tale,
shocked by its content and the lessons it brings forth.

So far, I've been unable to, for each time I try,
copious tears fall upon the paper and my fingers tremble,
and my body trembles, and my spirit weeps - and not through old age.

The secrets he bears within his evenhandedly joys and melancholic heart
is treasured by the cosmic spirit like the Center of Adonai itself.

Too perfect to exist among men, so fragile and full of love.
I am indignant at being unable to hold my nerve and swooning like a little girl
whenever I consider your deep misery.

I shall not fail to pray heaven daily for you
(Were it for myself, I would not pray at all)
I shall not fail to prey heaven daily for you
(and may peace be in your spirit)
I shall not fail to pray Heaven daily for you
(Farewell)
