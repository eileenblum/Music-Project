"And the Lord spake;
I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth. both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air. for it repenteth me that I have made them.
And behold, I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth,
To destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life. and everything that is in the earth shall die."

Beyond the prevailing death
A light will unfold
And it will be truth
And it will be salvation
And it will be fire
And it will be unity
And it will be god
And it will be eternal
