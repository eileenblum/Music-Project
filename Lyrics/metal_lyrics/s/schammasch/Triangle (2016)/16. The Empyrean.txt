The swords of rapture we proudly bear
The crackling fires of untruth in which we burn through the days
And the dark waters of dreams in which we drown at night
The blazing skies at a new dawn
The prayers that we blindly babble
The golden purity of a swarm of flying birds
The pulsating blood that flows through everything but this moment
The encounter of staring into a stranger's eyes through the mirror of the self
The death of nations
The poison that strikes as words
All the eternal secrets we carry
The spiteful remark of a broken promise
The fear of touching the higher self, even if it's just for one second
The oceanic grace of equanimity once in a blue moon
The mountains and hills of forsaken landscapes
The infinite wisdom of every withering flower
The frozen depths of untold memories, searing all flesh and mind
The burning lakes of pasts unspoken
The silent beauty of decay
The freedom that comes through acceptance
The joy of losing everything

All anxiety and anguish,
Pain and grief, hatred and envy,
Every tear that falls,
Every instant in desire, in solitude,
Every spark of hope or illusion,
Joy or forgiveness,
Peace and content,
All passion and love
All these things are one,
For us to witness
Once we return to our birthright
And all is none
