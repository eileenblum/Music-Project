I watch the sun descend into the open void
I watch the spirit fade between the walls of sleep
I watch the pillars of adherence being destroyed
I watch the silent flame rising from the deep

And I will raise my throne
I will raise my throne
I will raise my throne
Above the stars of god
I will raise my throne
I will raise my throne
I will raise my throne
Above the stars of god
When the voices fall silent
I will raise my throne above the stars of god
When the voices fall silent
I will raise my throne above the stars of god

Rise, my pillars
Rise, my serpents
Rise, my flames
Rise, my pillars

At the creation of mind
The creation of reason becomes necessary
And our action was inevitable
To rely on the creation of god and all that is empty
Adrift and unaware of being, unable to see,
Incapable to either receive nor perceive the essence of the eternal

We now play the same role again
With the only difference of standing on the other side of this river
To rely on the destruction of god and all that is holy
Adrift and unaware of being, unable to see,
Incapable to either receive nor perceive the essence of the eternal
Which is the essence of god alone
