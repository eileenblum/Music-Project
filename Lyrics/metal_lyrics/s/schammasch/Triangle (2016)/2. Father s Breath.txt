Reason as curse
The plague he sent upon us
His own seed, in his own likeness
Drowned by chaining hands

Reason as name, reason as light
Descending to the sink of iniquity
To bond the bright flame
Of old mother night
Extending his reign, defining ubiquity

I drown my heart in acid tears
To soil his flesh with cold reflection
My open heart for eyes to pierce
A perfect foil to a mind's dissection

Guided by the laws of hopelessness
Pining for redemption
I seek to eviscerate
His name, his fire, his love forever

Exhaling father's breath
Exhaling father's breath
To reduce the self to plain dissension
Raising secrets on his dying flame
As a monument of undimension
Where death alone is mine to claim

This gate is open now
Peeling flesh from bones and bones from spirit
I surrender mind and blood and tears
Of reason evermore
Unmasked as heaven's breath
Compelled as knowledge's death
Your will has made me what I am
And never was meant to be

I received your light, I received your wound
As a funeral rite for a heart entombed
As stigmata, envoys of the grave of holy creed

As your hand demands to fear
Your canon requires to persevere
To claim the heart of those
Pierced by such immense deceit
