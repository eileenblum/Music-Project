What else will you see, by gazing into
The reflection of your own countenance
On the water's surface,
Than a thousand empty eyes from
A thousand empty faces
Of a thousand empty selfs [sic], mirroring
A thousand empty lifes [sic]?

The harmonic state is not achieved
Through the profane illusion of
Capitulation, striking exceedingly the
Deepest minds whilst they are bent
This isolation of the spirit,
This paralysation of the flesh
Are only initials, unravelling at last
The circle of death

I saw this falling star
Lamb of faith under reason's will
I bind this sacrifice to the burning tree
And let it shine

I am the star that guides your way
Your shrine, your temple
Wine and bread
As opposed to him who leads astray
For your mind was closed,
Your heart was dead

Tell me, if Satan's breath creates the
Storms that hurl your salt water up to
The clouds
This you must tell me, because I would
Rejoice at knowing hell
So close to man
(spirit is not yet abandoned)

Embrace me now
Drown in darkness
Receive me now
Accept this guiding light
A voice to wake the truth of silence
Destroying forlorn hope
To renew what's hidden
Beneath the ruins

I cast the serpent's spell
On those who crawl unwillingly
Through forsaken wastes and dirty soil
Of a mind unclear

I saw how eagles fell
Stunned, from the topmost clouds
Of heaven
Tumbling over one another
In raging fear


Abjure these crumbling halls
Rebuild his rotten temple
Under the sun of eyes
To receive this gift with open arms
Lest you don't fail to pass
Receive the sign of death
With purest dignity
Infinity beyond the walls of life

(fluctus feri maris despumantes suas
Confusiones sidera errantia quibus
Procella tenebrarum in aeternum
Servata est)

Shadows emerging from the deep
In silence
Ascending from oceans

Shallow words are doomed to crumble
As the truth is bared
To be received through pain
And anguish
By the ones who dare to see

Never again shall you crumble
At the nameless void
But kiss the deepest darkness
And embrace the holy flames

Abjure these crumbling halls
Rebuild his rotten temple
Under the sun of eyes
To receive this gift with open arms
Lest you don't fail to pass
Receive the sign of death
With purest dignity
Infinity beyond the walls of life
As you sink deeper and deeper
Into this chimerical dark
A mind is burning down
Heralding thy utmost
Purifying rebirth
