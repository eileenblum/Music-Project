We are not the masks
That we hide behind
Nor the thoughts that we think
Nor the paths that we choose to walk
Nor the words that we speak
Nor the names that we are given
Nor the bodies that we live through
Nor all the things that we do

We are not what we create
Nor our past or future
We are not the decisions we make
We are not what we believe in
We are not the mind we bear within us
But that light that we become
