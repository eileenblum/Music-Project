De la chair
Ã  la terre
Trois faisceaux de lumiÃ©re

I relieve my fragile hands
Of his grasp that guided me
And set my heart on fire
While dancing thy dance
Of life's decay

Kephra by my side
Your sun reveals what comes to pass
Your rays accent the dying night
As I walk your path in ecstasy
Secrets burn divinely
Truth may come with a million faces
This I can see now at last
Truth is already here

Speaking through waves of unbalance
With voices so silent and pure
So drastic, so dead
Without words, with no sound
Yet so deeply inducing
For those eager to receive

I will not compromise my truth
For anyone or anything
For I can see now at last
That I am already free

To reach consensus on death
Thy wisdom, thy aspect of truth in all that is holy
Beseech this final breath
Thy essence unsealed by poison divine
And tear down all these bonds to become the solution of every concept of truth
As thy hands are unbound, thy spirit is free
And enlightened by the brightly burning tree

A leap in the dark
Undetermined
Insecure
Echoes of fear resounding through these halls
As prayers from the past

(exaudi orationem maem)

Ad mortem sic vita
Fluit velut ad mare flumen
Ad inferos descensus
Ad lucem
Ad indefinitum

Through wind and through fire
My guidance is yours
As you become my devotee
And from deathless desire
Through all that obscures
You will be unburdened
And finally see

So rise my descendant
From unfolding depths
Now encircled by grace
In three rays of light
So pure, so resplendent
Is he who accepts
My presence in all
With utmost insight

Moriendum est
Consensus

Qui habet
Aurem audiat
Quid spiritus
Dicat ecclesiis
Qui vicerit
Non laedetur a morte
Secunda

From carnal desire to soil
Two pillars to reunite
From carnal desire to soil
In three rays of light
