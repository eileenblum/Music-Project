The sands of time no longer speak in tongues of persuasion
An ocean changed in form and sound to swallow thee
The dust of silence procreates, but fades immediately
As I observe the sphinxes vanish in the winds
I know his day is nigh
I know the night must die
Revealing lasting peace beyond all fragile woe
I feel the void extending
I feel the self transcending
Dimensions falling down beneath the open eye

I look around myself and witness dreams and dreams and dreams
I am surrounded but untouched by all things ill-conceived
The strangest forms appear to me in everlasting streams
To renew illusion's seed that no thing will ever be relieved

Void is mind itself, and mind itself is void
A presence of the absence of will
Is speaking from beyond the veils of lunacy
Reminding me of what I am
I know the I is falling
I know these roots are sprawling
For benediction comes through him who is in all
I feel them flowing through my veins
I feel them slowly breaking chains
And reason resignates with unexpected grace

Receive the silent voice
The sound of transformation

Flame of consciousness, flame of knowledge, flow through me
And pervade my physical body, pervade my higher spirit,
Light my path and every step I take, so that I am able to guide myself,
To wander in brightness and with fortitude,
The mountains of being and the depths of reality
And give me the strength to surrender to whatever is and may be
With silence
And acceptance
