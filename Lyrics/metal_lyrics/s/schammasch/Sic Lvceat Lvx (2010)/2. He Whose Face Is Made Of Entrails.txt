Come closer, see me as a vision of delight
As I'm essential                  
Lord of abomination
Know my name, hear my word, come closer
As I speak revelation

Divine revelation of dimensional downfall
Before the sun of life
For I was born of the ancient blood
For I am source and kingdom of decay

My symbol, my word
My breath is rot
It is holy
The stench of death, odour of decomposition
It is holy

Witness the fall of life through my will
Necessity in every way

Call upon me
Call upon me, reach darkness
As you breathe in the southern winds, out of abyssos
Where physical expiration feeds my paradise

Come closer, let me fall into you as you fall into me 
While no light shall reveale the way you follow
To gain sublimination, in feculence of purity
Let me surge, let me flow through you
Dominating flesh and mind
For you chose invocation
Serving powers, older than time itself
