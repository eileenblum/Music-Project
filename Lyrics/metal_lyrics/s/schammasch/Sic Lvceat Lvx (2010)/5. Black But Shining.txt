Black
The nectar of the apple
Like the water from the well of life
Wich I drink 
To be blessed
To be absolute
To be blessed
With holy dark
For darkness is my light
Through it I breathe and see

Angel! Stare into this sun                  
Let this light seduce you             
Let it burn your wings
For you will fall with me
For you must fall with me
For you will fall with me

As he speaks of the great abyss
For he speaks through me
I speak his word to the cherubim
For some may go up in flames
As an introduction to the bliss of disobedience
To the bliss of sin

And I'd rather have fucked the holy mother
Before accepting wine and bread from hands divine

For darkness is my light
Through it I breathe and see
For darkness is my sun
Black but shining
Black but shining for me
