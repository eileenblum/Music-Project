This emptiness is yours
No light to gain from these hands
That gave you eyes, to see
That gave you lungs, to breathe
In a vacuum, eternal
A fathomless ocean of void
Fathomless nothingness

He looked at you in odium
Failed creation in the concept of existence
"He who sows the wind..."

Unfolded darkness conquers the solitude
Are you without reason?
Unfolded darkness whispers in your ear
Are you without ordinance?

I came here to see god, made of flesh
I came here to see the darkness from the fire
I came here to see extinction from creation
I came here to see ordinance divine

One command
One joy
One desire
One curse 
One weight
One measure
One king
One god
One law

It seems that there is no light from the flames
No light, for none of you
This, the manifest of dusk before dawn
This, the end before the light

I came here to see god, made of bones
I came here to see the darkness from the fire
I came here to see extinction from creation
I came here to see ordinance divine

Fountains of blood to reveale your true self
Surrounded by the waste of your creation 
For none of light will ever shine for you
Lucem demonstrat umbra
None of light shines for you
