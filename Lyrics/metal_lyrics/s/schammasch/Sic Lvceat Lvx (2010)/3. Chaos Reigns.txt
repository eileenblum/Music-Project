Where civilization matters not
We're heading straight for thee
Reaching this place of essence
Granting access to obsession 
Of natural instinct
Free to abandon 
In this, our place of fear
In darkness of suspense
Walking from misery into secret dimension
Paradise below, hiding its being 
From human hindrance 

The fire is burning in our eyes
Unleashing the fanatic love-feast at last
Burning in passion
Burning with purity
For we are not what you are
For we are not what you are

Lay down your hands on my face
To open my eyes wide enough
And crucify me in the woods
To proclaim confession
And reach myself
Proclaim confession
To complete the "I"
To live
To live
To be free
