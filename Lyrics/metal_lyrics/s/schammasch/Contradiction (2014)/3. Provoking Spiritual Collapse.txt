truth is yet created from ignorance and division
excessive axiom of reason
he who worshipped is crushed by the cross of definition
spirit has vanished, most fatal treason

the divided truth is, before all, limitation
unseen by the eye in the triangle
for a concept does not need direction, nor even shape, or names
but LVX 

you will speak the final word
ever spoken by man, before entering oblivion
and your mouth will be be resealed
to redirect the concept of life to a concept of undirection

reducing god to vAnus
an angel of dirt consuming his entrails
formed in vÃ­ta by chains of opposition
broken fragments of a principle divine

why would you not let yourself be skinned 
to lay down the "was" and welcome the "will be"?
why would you refuse to receive holy penetration
from the phallic god and father?
why would you not surrender 
to the river of poisonous tears and boiling blood?
why would you reject to drink his nectar
from the cup of salvation?

will you still breathe, when the word is overcome?
when all the water in the sea would not suffice to wash away one intellectual bloodstain?
you will die before you have truly awakened
like a moth, attracted to light

you evoked Lucifer
while the sacred mountain was crumbling
you revoked messiah
while the masses canonized their stumbling

you evoked spiritual collapse
you revoked spiritual collapse
you invoked spiritual collapse
you provoked spiritual collapse
