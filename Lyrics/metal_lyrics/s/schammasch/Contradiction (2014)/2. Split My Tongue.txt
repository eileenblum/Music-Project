numb to pain from wounds eternal
I step into the void of fear
this, my holy land
sepulchre of direction 
sepulchre of will 
in which I seek abjection
as we strive to reap defection
the essence of illumination
heralding divine creation

split my tongue, blind my eyes
curse my faith, cut my skin
wound my flesh, soil my blood
infest my mind ,drown my love
crush my bones, burn my face
nail my hands, break my will
quench my cries, choke my voice
tear my heart, evoke my fall

bleeding death into the skies
as thousand fists are crushing wailing walls
to the heartbeat of the abyss
deceitful shall be thy words

these words are snakes, guarding the temple of creation
and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life

Aleph lucidum -
flagellation of the spirit
- in noluntas Dei

unify my tongue, light my eyes
bless my faith and mend my skin
heal my flesh, purge my blood
fulfill my mind 
shelter my love, strengthen my bones
restore my face and free my hands
be my will
and hear my cries
and guide my voice
and seal my heart

Aleph lucidum in noluntas Dei
Aleph lucidum in noluntas Dei
Aleph lucidum in noluntas Dei
in noluntas Dei
deceitful shall be all words
