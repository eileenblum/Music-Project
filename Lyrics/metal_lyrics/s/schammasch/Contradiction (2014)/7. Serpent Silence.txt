solitary 
are all things which are complete
craving for completeness, other than the words in stone
while far above all things God awaits, the ultimate alone

o solitude - how many have mistaken
thy name for sorrowâs, or for deathâs, or fearâs
only thy children lie at night and waken
how shouldst thou speak and say that no man hears?

I shall speak in tongues of serpent silence

o soul of tears
for never hath fallen as dew thy word
nor is thy shape showed 
nor as wisdomâs heard

supreme in self-contentment
sole spirit 
gyring in its own ellipse
singing songs of serpent silence
while snakes devour time and tail
as act of great defiance

they speak words I used to speak when I was in silence  
they hear voices I used to hear when I was deaf
they see worlds I used to see when I was blinded
silence speaks for itself, with stones
creating wounds that shall not heal

no anguish left to feel
learning to forget wherefore
no use of speaking anymore
for the world turns without sound
though nothing is stranger to men than silence
even as a star became the soul of silence most profound
singing songs of serpent silence
even as a star became the soul of silence most profound
it was absolute

no voice, no song might pierce or penetrate
that enviable universal state
the sun and moon beheld, stood still
forging numinous instant under will
as we were sailing out of equilibrium
on a spiritual ocean without end
into the eyes of a thousand storms
the wheel of desperation that never stops turning
we will never reach heaven
so I teared god apart within me
and we may never see the sun again
but staring into the abyss with pride
praising silence as the last remaining joy
still waters run deep
