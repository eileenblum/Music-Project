an open heart released the eye that guides limitless light
torn apart and fulfilled by darkness in dismal height

nameless
countless    
shapeless
boundless
nothingness

the essence of god lies in the absence of man

highest deep reveals
before the first ray of light
and meta-flesh reseals
as the body of void
and serpent sibilance is yet the spirit voice
unraveled a new self
carving the shell of an unself

fires to choke
waters to dry out
earth to soak with poison
before absolute drought

a star of light consummate 
illuming what is not
a sun of night aureate  
consuming Qadmon's lot

the word of none is spoken without tongue and without lungs
the inner word was the silence of god
the word of none is spoken without sound and is unheard
the inner word is all in one, born in none

all is one
all is none
