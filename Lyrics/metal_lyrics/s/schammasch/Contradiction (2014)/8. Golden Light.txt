ten million stars explode
as I open my eyes to the sun

Neshamah entwined
and I did hear the scream of silence
for there is no "I"
for there is no "us"

to my heart, arise
bring disillusion
to our heart, arise 
to my heart, arise
o son of flames
to our heart, arise 

things which are endless, would they ever fall
when you, mortal, crossed the veil of Isis?
was it not fire which created the seas?
were it not men who created god?

a mantra is set for those with eyes to see
clouds of subject penetrated by shining dissolution
I saw thee in golden light, lurking heresy
a chapter to fall requires a chapter to rise

I saw thee in golden light, bearing crowns of horns
I saw thee in golden light, veiled in thousand raging storms
I saw thee
I saw thee
I saw thee
in golden light 

come fiery serpent
rise unto me
as your falling unservant
I'm burning to be free

flame of transcendence 
enlighten my heart
without words of repentance
for tearing a world apart

I harvest thy sun
I harvest thy void
