My face the canvas for your vision of me
Happy smiley face, too weak for life itself,
Corrupted - superhuman - hypocrite with a halo
Prisoner and hostage of its own faith

The vision - distorted, not me at all
What you hate and fear, projected on me
Lack of knowledge, lack of mind,
Fearing I'd wipe the clouds from your eyes

I struggle, I fight, I fall, I bleed, but my soul is free
I suffer, I starve, I cry, I die, but my soul is free

Despair, one of my worst enemies
Brave enough to admit, my human weakness
Prison, hostage and their guard I see too
Anxious to see how they trying to get out

My scars are telling the story - I am human
Trying to survive this place - nothing else
Trying to survive this place - but not alone
Trying to hold my feet on the ground
(I am not alone)

I struggle, I fight, I fall, I bleed, by bloody reality
I suffer, I starve, I cry, I die, my soul is free

Smiley face protects me from killing
Fighting the infinite reasons to hate
Trying to survive this place, everyday
Smiling face on the canvas survives
