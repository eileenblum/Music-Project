Turn of a century
Everything is lost
The commercial breaks before the daily news
Invites "the truth of life" to us

No changes in crowds demand
Two millenniums later
Feeble -- mindness revolts
 Keeping a record of bread and games

How dare to from children's mind
To that humanity learns from their mistakes
 ... a formal defect ...
 Believing into our ages standard
Their own ignorant presumption

What is perverted;
A world that's suffering in the daily news
Or a bunch of idiots, watching the quote whores truth ?

No doubt,
Cause these are "soul touching problems"
In our "real" life
In our commercial breaks
