The dawn of your being
Is coming faster as you thought
It's melting away
It flows through your bleeding eyes
Once a castle, strong and proud
Now crushed to a ruin of fears

Your existence pierced by death
While it consumes your anguish
Your existence pierced by death
While it consumes your pain
Your existence pierced by death
While it consumes your grief

Fearfull eyes -- searching for support
As time goes by ...
Fearfull eyes -- a petition of mercy
As time goes by ...

Your existence pierced by death
While it eat's the joy
Your existence pierced by death
While it eat's the fortune
Your existence pierced by death
While it tears your soul to pieces

Fearfull eyes are screaming to me
As time goes by ...
Fearfull eyes -- a divided soul
As time comes to an end
