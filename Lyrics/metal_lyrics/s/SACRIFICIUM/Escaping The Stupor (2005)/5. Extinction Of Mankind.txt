No relief, there is no way out
Of our breed, our breed to exist
Our image formed by our conceptions
In the past -- simple origin to wipe out

The ideal mankind, a try that could fail
Cause the extinction of mankind still creeps
...onward! For vast dismembering no rescue
Physical mutations -- a dreadful art

An insane philosophy of a thing that should not be
Genetical changes ... a kind of playing god
To strive the model man, is part of a condemn plan

Extinction of mankind
Overestimation of a dying race
Extinction of mankind
Was written for these who will fail
