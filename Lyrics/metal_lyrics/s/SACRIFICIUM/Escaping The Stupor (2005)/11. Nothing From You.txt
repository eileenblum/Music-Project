I don't beg for your acceptance
I don't beg for your affection
I don't beg for a silent moment
neither that you walk with me

I don't beg for your aggression
I don't beg for your void truth
I don't beg for a little help
neither that you leave me alone

Like a seed I wish I could
plant a thought into your heart.
That you could see what I saw,
feel what I felt  and die how I died.

I don't beg that you die with me
I don't beg that you care about me
I don't beg that you read my mind
neither that you burn your mask

Blood all over me.
Denied, betrayed and slaughtered
for nothing in return.
Nothing you have, nothing that you can bring,
Materialism ends
Nothing you can offer me weights in on my
sacrifice, weights in on the pain that
I've been through.
Nothing.

Like a seed I wish I could
plant a thought into your heart.
That you could see what I saw,
feel what I felt and die how I died.

I don't beg that you die with me
I don't beg that you care about me
I don't beg that you read my mind
neither that you burn your mask

Like a seed I wish I could
plant a thought into your heart.
That you could see what I saw,
feel what I felt and die how I died.
