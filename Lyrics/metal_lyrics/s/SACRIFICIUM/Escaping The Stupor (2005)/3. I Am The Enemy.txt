Bumbing in circles over and over
Sounds paradox, but that's how it is
For I'm spinning in circles and still
I am crushing at corners, my borders,
My pain threshold, at myself
Over and over

I run, still I'm not moving
I breath, still I suffocate
I pray, still I don't expect
I gave my heart, did I?

Crying, but tears ain't flowing
Screaming, silent I remain
Hiding, but still to be seen
Dying like an animal in his cage

Looked up, freezed up, walls that I can't climb up
Crashing against borders that I've been building up
Encircled by the stubbornness, my fake unconsciousness
And if I strip down to my bones, what do I have to see

I am the enemy

So now I am stranded and someone has to pay for this.
Point me someone who's responsible, whom I can blame
Through all this shit the mirror shows, it shows me.
