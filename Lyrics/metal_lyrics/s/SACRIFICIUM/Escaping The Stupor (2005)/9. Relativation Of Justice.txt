Murderer arrested
Now gas will be wasted
This scum has to be removed
Die! Just for Justice's proof

The fear on your face I see
This is how it has to be
The repentance you proclaim
Very funny - it's your game

Eye for an eye - so you have to die
Eye for an eye - society won't cry
Eye for an eye - tooth for an tooth
You have to die - by our truth

"In God we trust"? At least the dollar does
But dollar times are bound to pass
Who gave you the power to judge alone ?
For my power I have already shown

For the victim's sake it was done
All that scum should be killed young
Obey the laws that have been created
Less gas has to be wasted

My power I have already shown
