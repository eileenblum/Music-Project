So much anger - against me
Still I stand
Unto my savior - you deny
You follow the lÃ­e

Here am I confronting you
With the truth you perverted
The puppet on a string is you
So go ahead like you desired

I am not afraid - to die

Burn me, stab me, drown me, crucific me - to death

You're the slave - not me
Slaved by the lie
You're the one - who'll die
Dying for all eternity

The lie swallowed your soul
