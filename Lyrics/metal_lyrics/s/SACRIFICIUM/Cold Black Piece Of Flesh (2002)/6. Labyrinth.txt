Trapped in this labyrinth
That we build ourselfs
Cryptic writings on the wall
That meaning we'll never understand

Spoken words, broken promises, hollow phrases, empty hearts
Spoken words, broken promises, maniac laughter!

Closer than reality but stranger than fiction
Eternal darkness is to be, daylight transformation

Hear now my lost child
Ready for eternity?
There will be a timeless night
No rescue in wicked ideology

Take me there
To the place where I belong
No fear of the dark
But I prefer the warmth of the son.
