No more blood in me

Just an pitch-black oily stream
Pumped through my veins
By this cold black piece of flesh

Saw it coming all the way
I knew it, I knew it
The infection - I smelled it
My ugly sin

Ignorance to the hand
Who reached for me
Ignorance to the misery
Now I'm in

Ignorance to the cross
Where blood was shed
Ignorance to God
My ugly sin

The crippled me
Now yells to you
Heal my heart
Clean my blood

I crippled myself now for too long

My heart, my blood, my soul
I let the infection go on and on

Rip it - oh rip it out
Dear father take it out of me
Please get it out of me
And renew my heart within thee.
