Come closer now, closer to me
Set aside your anger, give it all to me
Won't let you down, I'm with you
Even you child, I love you

You wanted to be free
To choose your own destiny

Call on the dark
Keep it inside your heart
Call on the dark
Until it tears you appart

You wanted to be free
To choose your own destiny

Come closer now, closer to me
Set aside your anger, give it all to me
Won't let you down, I'm with you
Even you child, I love you
