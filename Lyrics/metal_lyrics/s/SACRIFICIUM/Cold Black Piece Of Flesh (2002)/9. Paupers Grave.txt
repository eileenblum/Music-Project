What can I do
To release my soul
From my faults?

I know I can't make it
To face eternal light
By following their ways
Lord tell me why I'm so blind

Tell me, nothing more but the truth

Reveal to me your majestic vision
Even if it turns for me to suffer
I will rather choose the paupers grave
In the shadow of your glorious throne
Than the place of the idle
Beneath your crushing feet
