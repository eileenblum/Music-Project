Existence - what is it's purpose, what is the mind
Existence - what is it all about, who am I?

Am I -- just copious amounts of flesh
Assembled by evolutions curiosity
Are you -- just a fragment in my dreams
And your actions product of my imagination

By whom or what, do we define our self image?
Can we rely on the things we see and hear?
How can we divide good and bad, right or wrong?
Don't we all ask the same questions?

Listen to me,
Our insight is limited and limited is our mind
But where we are weak God is the answer

His presence gives reason to my existence
The strength of His affection restores my soul
His suffering is the source of my salvation
And to him shall go my praise

Lord help me to overcome
The boundaries
The limitations
The inner struggle
The inner suffering.
You are real and so am I
