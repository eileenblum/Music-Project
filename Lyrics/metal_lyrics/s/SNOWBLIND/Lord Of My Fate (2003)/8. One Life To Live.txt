Another year passes by what have we done killing our time
Did we dream enough to fly?
And I wonder what we're doing here
Same old fears year after year
We can be stronger we want to fly
We can be stronger we can win time
Just one life to live
Another fear has just gone by what scared our souls
Is now left behind we are aware of the power inside
