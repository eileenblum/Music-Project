How long does it need my friend?
For my soul to save and reach your heaven?
You are God I am failure I am sin and you're a saviour
I bring hell in your heaven I fuck up forever
When I am gone from this earth
I'll look down and smiling
All this lie you call life
Seems you're lost in heaven
How much money do I need to repay your God,
And jump in heaven?
