Pale is the night cold is the light
Moon crimson liar fate burned in fire
Promises we create bittern in fire
Road with no end hate that we send
Mistakes we all make solutions always late
I believe in darkness and light
We create hell in our minds
Have no tear into the night
I have died so many times
I believe in darkness and light
We betray our own paradise
Bried the tears from my eyes
I have died so many times
