So many times life seems like an ocean
Where you're browned in the waters of dark
No one there to help you
No hand to lead me to light
Last thoughts before my eyes
Why do we forget again and again?
We are immortal spirits on Earth
We are immortal knowing no death
So many times life seems like a desert
Where you burn like in Hell every day
