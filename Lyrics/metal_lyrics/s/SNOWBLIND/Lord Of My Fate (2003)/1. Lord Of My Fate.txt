Demons always there friends in black
Reminding me that...
One more time lost in heaven just fear I remember
Empty eyes in a nightmare thanks givin' to forever
But the light comes out of the black
No no it's never too late I am the lord of my fate
Demons always there friends in black
Reminding me that...
Sink your knife in my cold heart naked no cover
Fragile soul dead so long now from grave will rise a new one
But the light comes out of the black
No it's never too late I am the lord of my fate
