In the cold heart of the winter so cruel and so divine
Where truth is always hurting and you cannot hide into lies
My faith was bleeding lonely and my hope was dead for so long
In hell into fire not a miracle just feeling old
I was cold and lonely I was so afraid
Every hell has an angel waiting to be found
Every dreams was a nightmare sometime
In the cold light of December I couldn't find my way
My blood was frozen in my veins and my brain
Couldn't swallow the pain
My faith was bleeding lonely and my hope was dead for so long
In hell into fire not a miracle just feeling old
