On winter days I saw you on the rain I cried for you
At dreams I felt lovin' you
At times of isolation at times of bleeding fear
At dreams I felt lovin' you
Lovin' you is an illusion lovin' you
Lovin' you is only dreaming lovin' you to death
At nights I hear your voice at days I feel your spell
At dreams I felt lovin' you
On bleeding hearts I cry again am under your spell
Lovin' you is an illusion lovin' you
Lovin' you is only dreaming lovin' you to death
