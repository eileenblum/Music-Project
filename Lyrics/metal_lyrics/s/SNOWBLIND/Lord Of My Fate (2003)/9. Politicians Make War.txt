Every bullets has a name watch out when it comes your way
And then there are no more words to say
Every soldier has a grave waiting him for his last day
This is not a game for you to play
The contract is signed with your blood and your tears no more sorrows
In their heart only lost their words is fast war not sorrow
Politicians make war
Politicians make war like they did before
All the flowers have to die war machine needs no more cries
Be a man don't compromise
Into hell into a promise for the victory and glories
If you come back alive then you'll live to tell
