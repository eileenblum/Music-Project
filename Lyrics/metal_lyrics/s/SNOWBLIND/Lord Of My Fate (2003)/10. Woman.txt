You're so divine always high a true lie
Where you smile all tools cry a true lie
Love promises on evil sperm
Love suckers welcome
Woman dark dark widow I am comin' for you
Woman show your teeth now I'll put my love into you
You're so kind you never try all men die
The game of love goes on all fools cry
