If I fly on a clod and rainy night would you still remember me?
For so long everyday I die do you still remember me?
You are the devil in my brain
You are the mother of my pain
You're fucking up my everyday
Cold face cold face
If I go to try to find the light would you remember me?
No regrets but I am tired of this fight do you still remember me?
You are the devil in my brain
You are the mother of my pain
You're fucking up my everyday
Cold face cold face
Tears running down your face
But now it's too late for sorrows too late
