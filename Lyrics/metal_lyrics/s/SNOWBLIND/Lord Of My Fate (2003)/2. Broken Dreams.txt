This chapter is over it's dead for so long
The memories are buried under the snow
I cannot die one more time
I cannot raise magic in lies
Things we said pain we lived
Hate we shared wounds still bleed
All the dreams we made are broken the love we share
The story has ended flowers on its grave
The death was slow with endless pain
