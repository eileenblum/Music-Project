I am the only one; your dreams are my reality
I didn't choose this my gift of mine
This is the end of the line
My child, this is your destiny

Rise up and your heart will unveil the truth
Inside your soul you will find
The strength to carry on
Your way back to paradise

[Chorus:]
I'm by your side
You shall not fear this time
The final judgement now at hand
Forged by fire, the awakening awaits
So follow the light
Born again by the night

I try to fight the sins
Redeem my soul from the deeds of the past
I didn't want this life to last
To find a way to save myself

I'd walk through the gates of hell

Rise up and your heart will unveil the truth
Inside your soul you will find
The strength to carry on
I'm passing through the unknown

Your way back to paradise

[Chorus]

This final stand
And now I've realized
I need to sacrifice my own salvation

So take my hand and I'll guide you through
You'll find your faith in your own death
You have to open your eyes
So you can find your way back to paradise

[Chorus]
