Out in the woods, unspoken horror of
Ancient malignance awakes
Leaving its hideout to please the hunger
Following the winds of the north

Cursed is the woodlands and cursed is thy land
The edge of the forest is marking
The line to the ground of red
So violent and vicious, so cruel and malign

Once there was peace and silence around
A valley of green under skies so blue
All is lost, children are raised
With tales of fear and tales about you

I need a miracle

[Bridge:]
Crimson eyes are burning
In the darkness of the woods
I must bring deliverance
Oh if I only could

[Chorus:]
When hell awakes
In the gardens inside of my heart
Unholy embrace
It's killing the innocence
Demons are rising, they're haunting my soul
The devil is laughing, he's seeking control
There's a poisoned thorn
In the gardens inside my heart
When hell awakes

This was the land of the golden seas
Freedom and light surrounding me
Now I'm aware that nothing is forever
A darkening mist infected our soil

Ages has past since I drew my first breath
The future was turning in the absence of death
Evil is rising, I saw its rebirth
Paradise, now it's hell on earth

What is the key to relock this door?
What is the cause, there must be more
Stories told in the ancient lore
Oh, it has happened before

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

I have been standing the test of time
Here I am now, this life is mine
Throughout the woods into the darkest night
I'm on the way to end this mortal fight

I have the clue, the certain sign
The moon is full and the stars align
Bearer of sorrow, sealer of fate
I'm taking it back, it's never too late

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
