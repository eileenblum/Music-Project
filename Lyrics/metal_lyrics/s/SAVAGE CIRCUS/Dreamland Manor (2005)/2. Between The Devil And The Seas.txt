Evil's rising, darkness calling me to cross
The boundaries to forbidden realms
On my journey to the very core
Tainted visions gain control of me

When the walls come tumbling down

Hollow and void is the silence around me
How will I end this, I have to break free

[Bridge:]
Hiding in my chamber in the black
I must arise to find my way back

[Chorus:]
Between the devil and the seas
In my agony the silence screams
Between the devil and the seas
When walls collide they're breaking dreams
They're breaking dreams

Raging forces pumping through my veins
Blinding enlightening
So peaceful and frightening
Drifter in time, lost between the worlds
Far beyond the point of no return

Searching my faith this world of debris
Never to realize this grim fantasy

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Hollow and void is the silence around me
How will I end this, I have to break free

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
