In the woods the elves are calling
Wonderland, when night is falling down
Down on me

Bringing on the wildest dreams
The fairy tales and magic things
Oh, dreamland, it's calling my name
Oh, I will be there

When I'm closing my eyes
I see the miracles waiting for me
In the mists of illusion
I'll be hidden and sheltered from all
Till the morning breaks

[Chorus:]
Let my dive into my fantasies
Far beyond my reality
Let me dwell inside the land of dreams
Far beyond reality

On the journey, a traveller in a world beyond
Reaching for the highest mountain
The deepest valley
Majestic plains and endless oceans

Pleasing me, enchanting me
Bewitching me and enlightening me

Destination: The great unknown
Here inside my very soul

When I'm closing my eyes
I see the miracles waiting for me
In the mists of illusion
I'll be hidden and sheltered from all
Till the morning breaks

[Chorus]

When I'm closing my eyes
I see the miracles waiting for me
In the mists of illusion
I'll be hidden and sheltered from all
Till the morning breaks

[Chorus x2]

Far beyond reality
Far beyond reality
Far beyond reality
So far beyond
