What am I doing here?
What is the reason for my fear?
Something vicious buried in black
Rising up, it's coming back

Long forgotten evil's drawing near
Hidden down below
It stood the test of time and now it's here

No loss of memories protecting me no more

[Chorus:]
Seven bound to the oath
Hold on forgetful
That brought us back, coming here
To end it once and for all
Hand in hand, we're going to stand
Together again, to carry out
What must be done
The final chapter has begun

Now we're going back in time
To fulfil the mission to seal the mine
In the underworld of the sewage pipes
The tunnels bare of light

Mortal fear makes me shiver to the bone
Down below, I'm not alone

Seven minds and but a single thought
Seven vowed to return
Seven versus the evil beast
To finally get released

A devil in disguise of a clown
Is preying on the children of the town

No loss of memories protecting me no more

[Chorus]

Now we're at the gateway to the devil's lair
Behind a torturous light I can feel it stare
It is awaiting like spider in the web
Seven against you now, the final attack

No loss of memories, the gathering is fulfilled

[Chorus]
