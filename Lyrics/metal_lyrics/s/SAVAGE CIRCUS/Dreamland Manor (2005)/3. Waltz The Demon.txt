Silence, so strange, but yet familiar
Illusions abducting me
Delusions haunting me

Whispers
Inside my very mind
Sweet subduction is taking on the guide

Drifting on and away
Into the abyss of my very soul
I'm losing control

Taking a ride into the unknown
Fantasies twisting my mind
Wonders to see and horrors to find
The gates are open wide

Inviting me, exciting me
Drain me with joy and despair
The demon awakes, reality brakes*
Drawing me into the lair

Here in my mind there's so much to find
Shadow and night are merging tonight

[Prebridge:]
Riding high
On wings of illusion up to the sky
Abducted into a dream
Where no one will hear my scream

[Bridge:]
Fire and ice
Deluded or wise
Good or bad
Sane or mad

[Chorus:]
Pain and pleasure is burning me up
Making me lose control
Demons are dancing inside of my mind
Reaching out for my soul

Restless drifter between the worlds
A merry-go-round in my head
Gifted, possessed, cursed or blessed?
Passing away into dread

Misleading me, enchanting me
Leaving the riddles behind
Conjuring up visions and dreams
Pleading to find peace of mind

Unlock the gate
My way to escape
Give me the key
I want to be free

[Prebridge]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Prebrige]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
