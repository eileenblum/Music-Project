On my journey into the unknown
Sometimes I wish
That one of these doors
Would lead me back
Back to you
Back to the time
When you were mine

When I close my eyes
I can recall your face
How you used to move me
In grace

I couldn't stay
Something was calling
From far away
I had to embark
Onto my journey
Into the dark

Love of my life
I had to go
Leave you alone
Out in the cold
It's breaking me down
It tears me apart
It's breaking my heart
To leave you like this
Without a kiss

I have treasured the secret
We used to share
When every caress made me shiver
You took my breath away
And to see you die
Still makes my cry
Cry in pain

Oh, Susan forgive me
My bitter sacrifice
As you died in the flames
My heart was turning to ice

I couldn't stay

Love of my life

Here I stand
At the end of the world
On my endless quest
Oh, how I wish to rest
For a while

I couldn't stay
Something was calling
From far away
I had to embark
Onto the tower
Into the dark

Love of my life
