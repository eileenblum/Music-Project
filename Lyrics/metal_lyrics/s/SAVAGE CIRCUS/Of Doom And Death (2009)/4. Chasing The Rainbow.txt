Uncertain visions are twisting in my mind
Haunting me in my dreams at night
When I'm closing my eyes I can see
The Devil is looking at me
He's smiling at me

Oh how I'm longing
To come back to sanity
To leave those shadows behind
Give me sanctuary

The darkness is pulling me
Into the hole
I am breaking the circle
To rescue my soul

Riding the Storm
On broken wings on broken wings
I will be riding the storm
To the end of the rainbow
Far, far away
I'm touching the sky
The word is goodbye, my friend
I'll be leaving behind
All my sorrow
I'll be embracing tomorrow
I'm riding the storm

Dreadful delusions of torment and pain
I don't think I can stand it again
I see a rainbow above in the sky
Now I'm closing my eyes and die

Wonderland
I see your light
Guiding me
Through the dark of the night

Beyond the horizon
Somewhere in time
Far, far away
Unseen by the eyes of the world
Magical secrets are crossing my way

Purified and electrified
Never turning back
I won't return
To the back

Riding the storm

And with the rising sun
I will be gone gone and away
I won't be looking back
Wonderland
I'm on my way

How I was longing
To come back to sanity
To leave those shadows behind
I found my sanctuary

Sometimes uneasiness
Comes to my mind
Am I save, did I leave
The Devil behind

Riding the storm
