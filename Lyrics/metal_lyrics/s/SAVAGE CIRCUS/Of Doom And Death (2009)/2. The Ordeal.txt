In the distance majestic mountains
Are gleaming in white
The sun is rising
And painting the peaks
In peaceful morning light
Touched by the beauty
The horrors I saw
Seem to be so unreal
But down below
In the halls and caverns
Evil has broken the seal
Oh, it's for real

Below the rock
In the deepest night
Dreadful hordes
Are gathering to strike
I must restore the seal

I have to return
To do what must be done
How can I be the chosen one
My ordeal has already begun

Lost in the dark
Deep down below
In the dungeons of Neverland
No turning back
Seems as if this odyssey
Will never end

While I'm stumbling
Into the abyss
I keep asking me why
The hands of fate
Have made me the one
Uh, I'm ready to die
Though I could break down and cry

How can it be me
To defeat the Evil
How can I be the hero
How can I win
Crawling shadows
And nameless creatures
Inhabitants of the night
Demons rising from down below
Left with no choice
No way out than to fight

Lost in the dark

All alone in this labyrinth
Of nightmare and pain
Away from all in another world
Another life in another time

Oh, how I wish
To turn away
To give in my fears and
Just walk away
I am damned to walk
The night all-alone
I crawling straight to the center
Of Hell
