Here I am, a journeyman
In the dusk of time
On barren land
I'm walking burning sand
With a gun in my hand
On the scent for the man in black
From a life so far away
Night and day
Again and again

In the land where all begun
For a living he's swinging the gun

Something is calling me
To the center of it all
To meet my destiny
So the world will life or fall

Gunslinger
I'm alive when the bullets fly
Gunslinger
Never to die
Listen to his lullaby

Of Doom and Death
Of Doom and Death
Of the inferno
Of the end of all days
Of termination and destruction
Ancient demons are reaching out
From beyond the other side
Purest Evil is just about to arise
Of Doom and Death

Mighty empires are rising up
Just to fall to debris
The world I'm from
Has been moving on
But I'll keep the memory
Crimson claws are reaching out
To the nexus of it all
The Dark Tower
Must never fall

He has left it all behind
To become the last of kind

Once again the door appears
In alternating realities
My strength is fading away
The Tower is calling me
Will it hold the answers
Will it make me see

Uh, my love
What bitter price
I paid for the sacrifice
Of turning away from you
Listen to his lullaby

Of Doom and Death

The end of days
Is setting in
In the hidden land
Of the Crimson King

Here I am on my final approach
Towards the tower
The King is raging for he can't win
I will break his power forever

Gunslinger
I'm alive when the bullets fly
Gunslinger
Never to die
Listen to his lullaby

Of Doom and Death
