Deadly eye
Unholy firelight
Grimly staring down
Gleaming in the night
Hellforged Hammer of Doom
Star of Death
Eating worlds in scorching breath

Riding on a tail of fire
Augured by the ancient ones
Glowing on the firmament
Harbinger of Armageddon

Armageddon
Armageddon
Armageddon when the Hammer of Doom
Armageddon was falling down

In the ashes of yesterday yesterday
I will arise
Ashes of yesterday yesterday
From the aftermath of demise
And by the morning
A new age is dawning
Once again may the circle begin
In the ashes of yesterday

All lost
Nothing remained
When the burning giant
Hit the ground
Darkness fell
Coldness and ice
When the star came stumbling down
From the skies

Silently in deep despair
I'm mourning for the world
Like a candle in the wind
The flame of life will shine on and on

In the ashes of yesterday yesterday
