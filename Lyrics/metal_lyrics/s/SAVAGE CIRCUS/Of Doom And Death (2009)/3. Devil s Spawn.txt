In mystic twilight
Of the dying day
The night is coming down
And I am on my way
Hoof beats of a mighty steed
Pounding through the air
The Evil Spirit once again
Has risen from his lair

Take heed beware of his coming
Lock the door and pray for tomorrow

Night after night he must ride
Out on the quest he cannot rest
He'll take your life
In the blink of an eye
Prepare to die

Headless Horseman
Rider in black
Galloping on 'til the night is gone
Headless Horseman
Minister of death
No way to escape
When the Horseman
Is pulling the blade

Grim and relentless
He was towering in his saddle
When he got decapitated
In some nameless battle
Driven by the Devil
He must rise up from the Dead
To ride forth to the battlefield
In quest of his head

Cursed cursed to remain
Cursed to kill again and again

Night after night he must ride
On and on in eternal damnation
Severing heads
In the blink of an eye
Time to die

Headless Horseman

In my investigations
On his mystery
I have unlocked the secret
I found the key
The one who holds the skull
Is taking on control
On the Horseman's very soul

At the lair now
Awaiting his coming
His bone in my hand
I pray for tomorrow

Fire and brimstone
Are waiting for him
Time has come to pay for his sin
Taking his head
He returns to the dead
To burn in Hell

Headless Horseman
