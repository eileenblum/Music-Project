It's fucking hopeless
Now, I cry alone
But I can see the light
Your promises, broken
It's so cold, so fucking hopeless
Everything was a lie
Now I refuse to cry this time
But I feel this pain everyday.
I've bled for so much time
I've come to realize
That I cant's wait for you
Now you feel the pain
But I can breath again
I can't wait for you
It's time to forget about the past
To begin a new life
And now I'm finally free
Fuck you I'm finally free
I can't forgive
My vengeance starts today
