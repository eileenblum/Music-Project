He is reborn to take the revenge
Cry now, but you can't escape from the horror.
Someone still loves you
From the grave.
Now he's here
The smell of death
Surrounds the room
Your cries are invain
'Cause he's coming to stab you sweety
Screams, blood and happyness
This is love, love is murder.
And now it's the time for
The last kiss on your dead lips.
