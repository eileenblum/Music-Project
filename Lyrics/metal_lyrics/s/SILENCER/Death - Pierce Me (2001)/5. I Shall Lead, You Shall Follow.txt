Panzer Riders
Through Bloody Storms,
Acid Spiders
In Uniforms

Golden Gleams
That Are Sunken Streams,
Buried In The Coil
Of Infinite Di - Visions

I Doom The Carriers Of Wombs,
Opened Are Your Shallow Tombs

The Consumption Of Six Million Stars,
Cyclonic Winds In Septic Wars
Shed Are The Blood Of Jewmans,
Slay The Lion Of Juda,
Revive The Night Of Crystals!

Convert My Ashes,
Rebuild Me In The Spiral World
Of Nowhere
My Only Solution
Is The Cosmic Conclusion -
Bow For Me!
...Drei Blintzeln Kapitan!
(Nein, Nicht, Noch Einmal!)
