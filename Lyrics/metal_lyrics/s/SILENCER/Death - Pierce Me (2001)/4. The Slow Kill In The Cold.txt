Throw Out And Kill
Nurish
And I'll Breathe
The Death

Die Some
Because Emptiness
Has Grown Old
Fire Descending
The Slow Kill In The Cold

Cast Me Into Depths
Observe
Slowly Sinking
Down
Through Dark Waters

The Reflection Of Dead Eyes
A Dark Figure
Blinded By The Rage
And Tripped In Chaos
Running Into Walls
