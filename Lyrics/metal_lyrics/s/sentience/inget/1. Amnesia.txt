Fragments of a broken smile,
separate my soul.

Predictable, words of poison,
yet i kill for your affection.
You'll learn no consequence.
I must resist temptation,
Only take what you desrve.

Burn, inhale,
Dream of something more.
Forgive the poison,
that stains my mind.
Wide Open,
In unfamiliar surroundings,
Searching for something more.

Sober my bones are breaking,
my lungs collapse and my mind caves in.
And every time I wake,
I see your fucking face!

Fragments of a broken smile,
separate my soul.
Can you blame me for feeling alone?
They won't lead you home!

They won't lead you home!
