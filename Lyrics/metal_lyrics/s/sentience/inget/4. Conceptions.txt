I lie in ruins

Reverse the rhythm,
Turn back the clock,
I've been waiting,
For an eternity .

I started with so fucking much,
But now I'm nothing.

Take me home,
I've fallen far from the surface.
It seems we've lost our way,
Never to return.

We won't walk any further,
The sea is calm before the storm.

A world deprived of detail,
Black and white.
The ignorant are forever blind.

I lie in ruins

Reverse the rhythm,
Turn back the clock,
I've been waiting,
For an eternity.

The image comes into focus,
Why won't you just leave my mind.

I made you a world,
gave you new eyes to see with,
You left me with nothing,
I want you to hear this;
Fuck making this house a home,
How could I not have known.

Wake the fuck up, we are out of time!
We can't live this way!
