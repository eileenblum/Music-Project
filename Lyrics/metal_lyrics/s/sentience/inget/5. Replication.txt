I stand at the heart of the world,
Lead me out, not astray.
Take me home!
Now you'll see what life is worth,
When all else is lost!

My life comprises of passing days,
Each day that passes,
A part of me is lost for good!

My mind stuggles to comprehend,
what is to come!

Senseless, without emotion,
A bag of blood and bone.
Set me free, bring me to life.
Bring me to life, set me free.

The light has faded from his eyes,
that single glimmer which makes us human,
A once proud stucture of a man.

I stand at the heart of the world,
Lead me out, not astray.
Take me home!
Now you'll see what life is worth,
When all else is lost!
