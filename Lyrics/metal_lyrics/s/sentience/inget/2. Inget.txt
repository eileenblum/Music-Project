Repent, Regress,
Pour your sins Unto me,
Failure to forget,
These years unspent.

Flood the skies,
Evade the sun.
Face your retribution.
No confusion,
Their buildings will crumble!

Revival from ruins,
Their nations will fall,
Their buildings will crumble!

Can you remember?
Condemned to this isolation.

There's no time like the present,
We have no time to lose.

There is nothing left,
Just a barren waste land of shattered dreams,
Nothing to return to,
The world is tearing, at its seems.

A place of ignorance,
Nowhere to go,
WE ARE ALONE!

Repent, Regress
Pour your sins on to me
Failure to forget, these years unspent,
Flood the skies.

Silence, reverbarating,
these sounds inside my head.
Breathless,
This pain is like science,
Your lies bread from violence,
Take my hand, silence!
We couldn't make it if we tried,
We're on our own.

ERASE THE SURFACE!
