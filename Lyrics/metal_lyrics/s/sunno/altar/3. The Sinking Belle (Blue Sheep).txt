[Lyrics by Jesse Sykes]

Passing by
Rows and rows,
In silence I
Stand alone.

And out of you
Grey birds fly,
On a gravel path
You qualified.

We tended to
The feverfew,
The walls of vine
In hollow time.

The shape I'm in
Oh, she knows so well,
My hearts become
Her sinking belle.

This sinking belle
Oh, this sinking belle,
Are you worried now?
You're worried now?
Ah.

This sinking belle
Oh, this sinking belle,
You're worried now
You're worried now.
Ah.

We're smaller than
We used to be,
What came from you
Is now inside me.

Don't ask me why
Oh, don't ask me why,
All my life,
All my life,
Was in black and white.

This sinking belle
Oh, this sinking belle
I'm worried now,
You're worried now
Ah.

This sinking belle
This sinking belle
I'm worried now,
You're worried now.
Ah.

This sinking belle
Oh, this sinking belle,
You're worried now,
You're worried now.
Ah.
