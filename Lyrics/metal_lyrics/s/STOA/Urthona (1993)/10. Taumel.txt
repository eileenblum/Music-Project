Time runs out.
I left behind
My breath came up to here.
Till now I hesitated.
Tired eyes -
I scan the old horizon.
My path cant end this way.
But dyes rapidly fading.

Find to calm,
My heart without.
But Im to weak to try.
That lie was my undoing.

Breakable
Arising hope for silence, -
Thus far I was the child.
The sleepers now awakened.

[K.-U. Skerra]
