[Japanese Bonus Track]Non c'Ã¨ preghiera per me
Il mio abisso Ã¨ l'oscuritÃ 
Perduto i'uomo che Ã¨ in me di sangue
Le mie lacrime

I know you're here,
I can feel your fear
But do not think, I'll let you live
I can spread my wings, flying to you
My fangs will take your life, die!

Let me be a demon, growing inside
You cleanest soul immortal living for you
Let me be your master
Taking control of your mind

Look at my face and you will know when I become a devil
My soul is cursed for a thousand years
Lost in my embrace
You will fell the death that I'm living
Love does not flow in my tears

I know you're here,
I can feel your fear
But do not think, I'll let you live
I can spread my wings, flying to you
My fangs will take your life, die!

Let me be a demon, growing inside
You cleanest soul immortal living for you
Let me be your master
Taking control of your mind

Look at my face and you will know when I become a devil
My soul is cursed for a thousand years
Lost in my embrace
You will fell the death that I'm living
Love does not flow in my tears

Look at my face and you will know when I become a devil
My soul is cursed for a thousand years
Lost in my embrace
You will fell the death that I'm living
Love does not flow in my tears

Un triste fato ha scelto te
La morte Ã¨ un bacio che mi sazierÃ 
Addio, addio...
