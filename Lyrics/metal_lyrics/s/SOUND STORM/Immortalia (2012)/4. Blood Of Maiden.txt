In your sad life fear is your way
Tortures never end
Join me
Tell me what you want, what you desire?
What is on your mind
Bloodlust

Vive ancor si lieve il suo lamento
Cessa demone il suo tormento

Spilling red life from their veins
Victims lay in pain
I feel them
Bloodshed again, blood on your face
Screamin' once again
Laughing

Blood of maiden, slowly flows again
On you face
Blades and razors sign cruel paths, again
Spilling pure blood from their veins

She's crying again death never comes
Pleasure burns again
I like it
Too many deaths to cover again
This time you must pay
My end

Time has come with agony you must pay
How many deaths in your hands
Wash away evil from your own hands
Suffering now in a darkness' world
