In that stormy night, I'll fulfill my dreams
time now has come, you know what I mean
my vision is real
my theory was not just illusion

It's raining outside, i'm ready to try
Thunders and lighting now lashing the sky
Power is full, it's time to back to life.

Back to Life - Life goes on still in you
Back to Life - you'll see the light, my son
revival of your death
and you can see the sun

A burst of light's flashing my eyes
Power of lighting lits up the night
lying dead yet
not even the sign of life

The storm rages again
Another attempt
I'm ready to try again and again
Power is full, it's time to back to life

Back to Life - Life goes on still in you
Back to Life - you'll see the light, my son

A new life is born
back from the abyss of hell
to view again the daylight
A new life is born
back from the abyss of hell
but there's something strange,
in his eyes

I'm just a fool
What is your destiny?
My son

A new life is born
back from the abyss of hell
to view again the daylight
A new life is born
back from the abyss of hell
but there's something strange,
in his eyes
