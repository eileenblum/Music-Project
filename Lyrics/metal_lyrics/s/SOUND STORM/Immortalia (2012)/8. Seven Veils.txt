Shine with passion her sweet lips,
Flowing her blonde hair
(the) scent of roses fills the air

Dance now. princess
I'm passing sad. tonight
Dance now, for me
Tonight I feel so down inside

Dance now. princess
(I) do not let. (I) beg you again
Dance now. for me
I will satisfy all your desire

"SalomÃ¨" "your pleasure, my veils are out
My lips, my hips, my skin is yours"

All you want is him
I'll cut his head and you will dance

It's over, why do you care about this man
Just one wish for all my life

Danza per me. delizia il tuo re
Il sole e la luna saranno tuoi,
Oro e argento quanto vorrai
Danzano I veli sui fianchi suoi
Mia dolce salomÃ¨

Now, you're the one for me
Living my destiny
You're closed in my dreams again
You will dance for me
Paying for my sins

I his will be our secret
Dance now...
