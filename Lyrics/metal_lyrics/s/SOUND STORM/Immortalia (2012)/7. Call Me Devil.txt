A voice in the night
Dark lord look at your children
Deep in my mind
Give us the blessing of the darkness
Fright in my dreams
And we'll dedicate to you the rest of our lives

This sacrifice is for you
Call me devil

A circle of blood
I swear unconditional loyalty
Dressed in black
Living our lives in blasphemy
Black candles shine
Spreading your word in the rest of the world

This sacrifice is for you
Call me devil

(it) seems to be obscene
I'm forced to do my destiny
Triumph of my sin
Follow me my slaves,
In perdition till the end of your
Life

I'll he your seed
This is my blood for you
It will be your life
