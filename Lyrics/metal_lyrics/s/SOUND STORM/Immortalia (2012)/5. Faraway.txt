Faraway. i lived in the kingdom of light
I earned light to the sky
I held the ranks of the lord

Now i am jailed, among the eternal flames i
Faraway. i was blessed by the sun
I flew high above the sky
I wanted to reign in this world

Now my feathered wings are pitch black
I have nothing more to believe in

Faraway, flying between heaven and earth
Faraway, i was amazed when i felt
How' awful the goodness is

My coming was near, the battle was lost but my
Vengeance will be. my lord

This is my reign, under his earth, sorrow for my betrayal

I have no remorse, no regrets, waiting for revenge
You will have the power, you will have the glory
If sanctify my name

Far away, surrounded by an ocean of flame
It's always better than (being) a slave
Here. i'm the master of hell

Faraway
All my demons will fight again
Faraway
I'm not yet defeated, if you will fear my name
Faraway
Wait, my legions will come to you
Faraway
Sitting here on my throne

I'm waiting for my revenge
