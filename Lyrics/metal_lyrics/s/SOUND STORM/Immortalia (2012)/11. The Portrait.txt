[Part I â Heaven]

A true dream, this new life
Everything is new to me
Youth is a treasure to me, my beauty will never die

Time... this is my time

Again and again I'm chasing my dreams
I wish that my life didn't change
Like a ship in the ocean. I sail in this world, to

Discover
Who really I am

Under this face now, resting my soul
Under this portrait, evil is born again

My life has gone forever

Piansi nere lacrime
Senlo crescer I' odio nel mio cuor

[Part 2 â Hell]

You are a wrinkled face, which makes me sick
Dried blood that soiled my life
Look at my eyes, fill them of rage
This is the price for your sins

Don't look at me, unclean portrait
Don't lie to me
Back to hell to die
Burn in llames with your lies
Die! I don't wanna see you in my life
Die! I don't wanna see you anymore
Die! I'm just losing control
Don't look at me, unclean portrait
Don't look at me, again and again

I see your grin
Makes fun of me
Go away from here. I'm just losing control
