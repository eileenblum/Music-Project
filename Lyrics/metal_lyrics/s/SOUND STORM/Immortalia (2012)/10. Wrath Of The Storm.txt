Look into my eyes, anger is still alive,
Burning like the fires of hell
Which can only give you pain
Vengeance straight from the past
To satisfy the queen of death
Like a wolf it chased my prey
I can feel the smell of your pain

Rag in lire
Flames are higher
Burning anger
In my hands

Sinner's crying
'cause of his crimes
He's the cross
Of his soul

Someday. I will have the world right in my hand
Someday. I will be stronger than yesterday

Louder, more than yesterday
Louder, more than yesterday
I will try to find my way screaming âtill my end

Dentro me. la rabbia sale
Ã tin demone, che mi pervade
Arrestarmi e impossibile
