I walked alone under the moonlight
But inside my heart, darkness reigned
Tears of blood, every time, through my face
Loneliness tore my days, my days

All I wanted in my life, was you
I have tried to obscure the sun. just to see you
You have reached death as a sudden summer
Storm
Sweeping out of my life, but my life I'll give to
You now

I'm fading away for you, honey
(I need you)
Wait for the first ray of light
(the real death is without you)
Until my eyes will meet the sun
I'm fading away for you, honey

âcause without you
I will be ash. lulled by the wind
The sun takes place in the sky,
Like a dream lost in my eyes
I'm going away from this world... my love...
