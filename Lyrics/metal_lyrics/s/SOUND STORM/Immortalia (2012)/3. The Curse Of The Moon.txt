I flee from you

When the moon is shining among the stars
(this is the curse of the moon)
She deceives my eyes, deceives my senses
Her light makes me so wild

What she created makes my shadow burning
Made my soul standing in the valley of the dead
What she donated is my heart bleeding,
Made my soul standing in the valley of the dead

Now the moon is rising again,
Slowly charming my gaze
My curse takes it's course, again

I flee from you when i feel your scent,
Blend with my mind
When you're leaving your crypt,
Touched by the moon
Your skins burn for me

Moonlight, shining bright so high,
You are the sun of the dead
Damned
Keeper of my destiny
Moonlight, shining bright so high
Living your curse again

There is no difference between man and beast
And nobody cares, you know, that i'm here for you
Hearing my howl in the night

I know. i've tried to disappear,
Fraught with my rage
Hounded by everyone i met
I know, you will not forgive,
It's my life to live
Now you run away, far away from me

You're hearing my howl, now,
I am the beast
This is the curse of the moon
I'm tasting your fear, now,
Spread in the air
You're facing the death, now
I'm the mastiff of hell
