Your promises, were born in hell
They are splinters in my heart
Crimes in front of my eyes

In your eyes many demons lie
They're still playing with my mind
Taking what is mine

You have corrupted my soul
Now you still play with my life
You are a devil inside my mind
Your lies will never die

You took my heart, you took my soul,
Just rage you left in me now
Your poison devours my mind,
It is the bite of evil

Forget my face, forget my name,
And let me live alone

Winds of truth may show the lies
Like a storm raging sea
Salvation is so near

Painful chains,
Bring me to the past
It's so hard to break free
There's no other way for me

No, let me live alone
