Something fouls my innocence
Deadly fog everywhere
Cruel beings are surrounding me
Other ways are not there

Clouds run across the sacred sky
Tears of pain through the air
Lying here now is pleasant
Drops and tears in my face

Oh, I want to know
What is the darkness and taste the tang
Oh, you must know
No one can show me my destiny

I'll spread my darkened wings
Flying through the evil skies, rising to thunders and rain
And like Mercury I will
feather my heels, rising to thunders and rain

Voice of death's embracing me
running fast through my veins
Eyes gazing the Black One
Winds of doom lash my face

Past is lost and I am alone
Roaming through desert lands
Thirst for power blinded me
God of light save your son
