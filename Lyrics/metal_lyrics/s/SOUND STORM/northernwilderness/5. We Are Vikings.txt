Ice is broken by the prows of our ships
Faces are lashed by violence of the wind
Our hands have scars for the weapons and the ropes
We are Vikings, warriors from the north

Frost in the morning wets our clothes
Smoke from the mouth looks like white smoke
The fog and the rain don't deceive our eyes
We are Vikings, North Sea in our lives
The North Sea in our lives

Odin, our God, gives us the secret of steel
He forged our hearts with the courage to believe
He's throwing our threads till the day will come
We are Vikings, Valhalla awaits for us
Many lands many races we've destroyed with rage
Our battle scream is known everywhere
We're spreading fear and pain, 'till the day will come
We are Vikings, hammers of the gods
Hammers of the gods
We'll fight, we'll die to survive
We'll fight, we'll die to survive

When my body falls down on the battlefield
My soul flies away carried by Valkyries
Valhalla I will see where the braves wait for me
Immortality I can keep
I'll be an hero for eternity
...for eternity
