Enemies of light stand against us
Darkness can fall on this ancient land
Demons, warriors wait for us on battlefield
Thousands heroes struck down
By the black wind

No retreats, no defeats,
Surrounded but we must resist
The only way in this holy war
Is summoning the power of Storm

'Cause I plead you

God of thunder, help your son
Give me the power of the Storm
To sweep them all
To sweep them all

An explosion of light shakes the earth
Armies of shadows, are sweeped away
Hold on the swords, my friends
To the final charge
Fury of storm with us
Winds of revenge
