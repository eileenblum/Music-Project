[V. Sbriglione â V. Verderosa]

She lives in a castle in the frozenland
In the reign of the ice, where I lost my mind
She's waiting in the silence for my prayers
Carried by the wind, friend of mine
Her eyes are blue like two jewels
Fallen from the sky, tears of ice
Her smile is a snowflake in my hand
So precious for me I never can get (her) out from my dreams

She is alone so far from me
I wish that all this can be real
I wanna embrace her to me
I'll be with her 'til my last breath
I'll do for her anything
She'll be my queen for eternity

No tears from my eyes
Ploughing my face
My love
No I can't renegade my dreams
It's the only way to live
'Til the end of my days
