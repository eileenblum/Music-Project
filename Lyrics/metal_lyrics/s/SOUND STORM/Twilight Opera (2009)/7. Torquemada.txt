[V. Sbriglione â V. Verderosa]

All around the known lands I see
People living in blasphemy
Doing obscenity laying in sodomy
I must purge now, this heresy

With fire, I absolve you, liar
With fire, I absolve you, liar

What is your name?
Tell me now this name
So your soul will be free
And you can feel fine
You don't want to confess
You will burn through the flames of hell

There's no sorrow on my face
I'll gaze at your body writhing in pain
Suffer atrocity, screaming in agony
I must purge now, this heresy

Punishment divine now it's ready for you
Tortures will never end

"Ecclesia ultra non habeat quod faciat eundum reliquimus brachio et judicio saeculari"

All around the known lands I see
People living in blasphemy
Doing obscenity laying in sodomy
I must purge now, this heresy

What is your name?
Tell me now this name
So your soul will be free
And you can feel fine
You don't want to confess
You will burn through the flames of hell
