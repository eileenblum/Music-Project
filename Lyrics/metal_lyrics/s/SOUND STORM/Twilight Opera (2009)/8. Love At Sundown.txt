[V. Sbriglione â V. Verderosa]

Before death my life's over
Such as the dead which passed away
How many years to search you 'round
Hidden  by lights down on the ground

You're a smile in my mind, living and dying for you
You're a wound of my heart, bleeding

Curtains were off and you came out
Blue velvet eyes against blood
My scarlet tears were lost at all
Countess of light shall take my soul

On my way (from the past 'til the day I will die) you'll be a sweet sound
All my life (when the moon takes the place of the sun) is the love at sundown
