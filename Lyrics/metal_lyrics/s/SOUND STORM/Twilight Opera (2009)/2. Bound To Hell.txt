[V. Sbriglione â V. Verderosa]

God god show me now the way
What is my destination?
My sin, evil's over me
I need air to breathe

Call my name
I just want to be great
I can show you the way
No...

Right now our pact is done
You signed with your own blood
Recall your soul will be mine
Waiting for your death.

Lost is your soul, oblivion has come, damned for a thousand years bound to hell
Bound to hell

Bells chime, echoes in my mind
There is no salvation
Hell's gate! Satan's calling me!
Falling into the deep

You have the fame
I don't  wanna be damned
You cannot break the pact

Poor me it's too late to apologize
There's no escape to my crimes ...

Lost is your soul, oblivion has come, damned for a thousand years bound to hell
Bound to hell
