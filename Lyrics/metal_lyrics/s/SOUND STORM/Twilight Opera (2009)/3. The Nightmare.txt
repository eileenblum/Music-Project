[V. Sbriglione â V. Verderosa]

Here I await between sea and sand,
this is the place I call home
The storm soon appears, my final day has come
The wish of facing destiny is great

But I can refind the secret I've lost
But I can refind the secret I've lost
And now I can feel

An hero now comes in me
To struggle my pain
Strength is into me
Today, I'm not afraid

The Loser now has gone
The Loser now has gone

I've never lived my life
Loser I've always been
But today I'll win and die

The storm is my fear
The choice I've never made
Respect that no one gave me
And pain...

But I can refind the secret I've lost
But I can refind the secret I've lost
And now I can feel

An hero now comes in me
To struggle my pain
Strength is into me
Today, I'm not afraid

The Loser now has gone
The Loser now has gone
