[V. Sbriglione â V. Verderosa]

Star, bright star, I'd want ask to you
does your view trouble my mind?
Is it glimmer of hope or bringer of fate?
Destiny of mine wonders alone

Oh shining star
wrapping this heart
making me proud
Stay 'til tomorrow
but in the end you'll be
A falling star

Star, white star. I'd want pray to you
Please don't go away from your shape
From the holy firmament
'cause death could be up above

Oh shining star
wrapping this heart
making me proud
Stay 'til tomorrow
but in the end you'll be
A falling star
