[V. Sbriglione â V. Verderosa]

There was a time to the end
There'll be a time to begin
Visions of past have appeared
She lives again in my feels

Many years spent alone
I wait for these days to return
I've crossed the oceans of time
I'll leave from this death to find
You

He was a great warrior son of an ancient world
Loyal to his order, when his duty calls
Dragon's warrior rides against death he walks
Fighting for his faith, merciless to none

Merciless Dragon's knight , tearing  the enemies lives
How they said: "Believe in destiny"
In this battle you're victorious
Now go back to your home
Sad omen hangs over your love

Many battles won, many ripped lives
Blood is on his face blood is on his signs
Banquet through the impaled (ones), joined his victory
Warning punishment for the enemies.

False news of his death
She believed in this fake
She cries her tears, screaming his name
More and more
She leaped to her death
So her soul cannot be saved.
Blinded by revenge, (he) renounces to his faith
For her...

Loneliness of ancient pain still carries on everyday
Born again from his tragedy
Bound to live in death
Blood is the source of your hell.

Loneliness of ancient cries still carries on in your eyes
Born again from his tragedy
Bound to live in death
Blood is the source of your hell.
