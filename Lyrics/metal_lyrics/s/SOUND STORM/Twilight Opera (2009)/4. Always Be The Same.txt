[V. Sbriglione â V. Verderosa]

Winds of change blowing now on my identity
They can't sweep away my dreams
One life to live , one way to walk , inside my heart I know

I can grow old
I can change my mind
But I'll always be the same
I can lose my way
I can learn from my faults
But I'll always be the same

Till my soul will give to me
The rage to feed my voice
I can't betray my choice.
One life to live, one way to walk, inside my heart I know

I can grow old
I can change my mind
But I'll always be the same
I can lose my way
I can learn from my faults
But I'll always be the same

Oh...no ...no no no no
I'll always be the same
Oh...no ...no no no no
I'll always be the same
