[V. Sbriglione â V. Verderosa]

Something in my mind seems to change
darkness now wraps a piece of my heart
Oh... Devotion
the mania for fame brought me to this
Oh Ambition created by (the) pride of men to corrupt the soul

I was foolish 'cause I groped
I'm losing control
For my condition there's  no hope
For one part of me
I know ...

Oh... Devotion
the mania for fame brought me to this

No, he returns
One more time

No, I'm losing control
He's back, I'm just numb
Possessing my soul!
