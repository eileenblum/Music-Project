What are the answers you seek
Blood of mine?
Your voice is heard on this peak
Here past the skyline
"Evil has come back from time!"
For I have seen all the signs
You must trust elder lore
Settle the final score

Cold clings to my bones
Guided by these ancient stones
I shout to the sky
And I see his glowing eyes
By Heaven's light
Ready to fight
In The Twisted Twilight
Eater of Worlds
Comes in the Mist
Devour all who resist
As Dragonborn
I am your bane
As you burst into flames
Traveler of time, be no more
Your soul is mine

Mounted on shadows we ride
Across the plains tonight
Over the mountains, into the caves
Ancient hero's words
Pave the way
Raise your voice above
Split the mind of the Dov
Mortality is the key
