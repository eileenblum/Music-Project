Farewell my Sun and Stars
You've fallen from your horse
How I long to see your light again
Now I've lost so much
The woman who betrayed all my trust
Shall burn tonight with us
Fire and Blood
My Vengeance!

Horse Lord ride to the sky
A red star appears tonight
Hailing from the flames
The return of dragons

Forgive me, Son of my Life
forgive me for all I've done and
All that i must do
The price paid was too high
Flames destroy the past
My will is done there's no turning back
These Dragon Eggs shall crack
Fire and Blood
The Rebirth!

Horse Lord ride to the sky
A red star appears tonight
Hailing from the flames
The return of dragons

Goodbye My Love
Let this fire take you up
If I look back, I'm lost
Goodbye My Love
Your Star will rise above
Only Death can pay for Life

Goodbye My Love
Let this fire take you up
If I look back, I'm lost
Goodbye My Love
Your Star will rise above
Only Death can pay for Life

Goodbye My Love
All I've lost is far too much
I've paid the price unknowing the cost
Goodbye My Love
Let my fire burn you up
From the ash, the dragons rise
