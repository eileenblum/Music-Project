Thunder rolls in the sky
On wings of Icarus I fly
Broken Judges under me
In ruins for all to see
Bloody rage left behind
Of where I've been and where I'll be
Show me child how to see

Time has come for this to end

Upon the mountain
Fear grips his mind
The Spartan decided the fate of Mankind
Flame of Olympus
Now I can see
In the darkness Fires of Hope shall set us free

Father, what will you do?
I fear not the name of Zeus
Purified by flames
Another god will be slain
Pandora, the fire burns in my eyes
I arise

The power to kill a god lies within
