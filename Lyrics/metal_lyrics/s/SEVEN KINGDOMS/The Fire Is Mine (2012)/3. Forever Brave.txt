Look at this mess
Piles of civil unrest
Flood the streets
"Down with Elites"
Truth is the case
Hidden by the human race
Until now

If we have it all
Now where is the Dream?
A future behold
Slipping right through the seams
I cannot take the pain

Where do we go from here?
The vision has become unclear
What once was, is now not anymore
In the land our Kings ignore

Eagle in chains
From our campaigns
You have a choice, now be a voice
for what remains
It would be nice
To live our lives
Unafraid, forever brave

Troubled times
Send me all the signs
What have we left for our youth?
Greed is the way
Conniving sword play
The liars way

What really happens 
Is so unreal
Why do they have to
Cheat and to steal
The noose is on our necks
