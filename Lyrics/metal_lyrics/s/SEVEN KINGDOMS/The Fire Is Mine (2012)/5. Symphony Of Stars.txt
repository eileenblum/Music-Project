I only dream because
I did not know
It could be real
The lie that says "I can't"
But my heart is my shield
Looking above to see
The stars of my heavens
I made a wish to hold
The universe in my hands

By the sun
Clouds ignite
In this darkness be my light
All will be
Turned to dust
Here in the winds of the night
In the sky,
Crystallized
We will collide
You and I

Look into the glass
Can't you see, there is no agony
We are forever among
The symphony of stars
This is my little piece of space
This is my symphony of stars

One day we will be gone
But our voice immortal, lies in song
To the skies from earth
This will be our triumphant rebirth
Soar now past Orion
Beyond the darkest parts of space
Where am I? What have I done?
Where is this place?
