This bag of pain that we carry
The acid that attacks the soul
A glass house of inner fear
Chains that hold as tight as a vice

A grim and sobbing soul
A sea of mourning children

Your heart is the key
To the ever-wondering why
Trust the unknown
For the naked eye is foolish
Believe to be believed in

Armor and strength he gave to me
An unmovable mountain
A creature of beauty
My tears from fears wiped away

Trust your heart he spoke to me
Face your fears to live your dreams
