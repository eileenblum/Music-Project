I caught a fleeting glimpse of reality
Why are you tempting me
No words describe
This world you hide
For all but me to see
Although I may try
I can't escape these feelings anymore
Untie my hands, open up my eyes

Slipping away
Fading away
Before my eyes
You can't grasp this state of mind
Slipping away
Fading away
Before your eyes
You can't shape a twisted mind

Into the fire take my sanity
Fragile minds collapse
I can't take this any longer
Into the fire take my sanity
Fragile minds collapse
Can you hear them getting closer?

I hear them calling out my name
I can't sleep, I can't breathe
And I can't find my way
It's lonely in the night
I can't see the stars anymore
Just black holes in the sky

Hollow cries
Fall upon deaf ears
Vacant eyes see no light
I can't escape
I can't run away
Burning in flames
