I've seen nightmare's wings
Flying high in feverish dreams
Break these chains of misery

No more climbing walls for me
Now wings replace these broken legs
Guide me to my destiny

I feel the cold of Northwind's Breeze
Raven show me how to fly
Set me free in Summer's eyes
Across the frozen land of Winterfell's Kings
A quest to breach the Wall
To reach the land of ice and snow

After the fall
I finally realized
The future of your life
Is not always what it seems
After the fall
I fully understand
The answers that I seek
Are beyond my wildest dreams

Dark news on dark wings
Another comes to join the hall of kings
I fear the worst is yet to be
So run to the North
From the men of Iron shores
To a destiny that's calling me

Pitch black wings of destiny
Speaking to me in nights of Summer's dreams
Pitch black wings of destiny
Guiding me to land of ice and trees
