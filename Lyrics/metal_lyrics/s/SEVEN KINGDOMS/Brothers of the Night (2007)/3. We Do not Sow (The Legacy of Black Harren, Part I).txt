Black ships are sailing in the night.
I'm drunk and looking for a fight.
A distant light appears, as the dark waves turn.
Let's steal their lives, and watch the village burn!

Sail the stormy seas-Stand proud and free.
Claiming meat and mead-I'll take the shores.
And salt wife whores, never ending, I need more.
We're Ironborn, we rape, we reave and..
Carve out our kingdom on distant shores.
Black Harren's longships sailing out.
Taking rewards we do not sow.

My axe lusts for bone and gore.
Lust as the Iron men of yore.
The drowned god made us to be strong.
We write our names in blood, fire and song!

...What is dead may never die...

Let your servant be born again from the sea.
As you were.
Bless him with salt, bless him with stone.
Bless him with steel.
What is dead may never die, but rises again.
Harder and stronger.

...What is dead may never die...

So we sail for morning sun.
Toward future conquest to be won.
Our mighty race shall reign on high.
We'll rule until the whole world dies!
