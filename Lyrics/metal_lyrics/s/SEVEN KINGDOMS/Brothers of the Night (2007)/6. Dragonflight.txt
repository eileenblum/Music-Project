On the northern wind we fly
Our dragonmounts block out the sky
From icy wood to distant shores
All heathens feel our mighty swords

With dragonfire and clash of steel
We take their lives and burn their fields
The gods declare this land our right

Behold the mighty dragonflight
Let retribution come this night
For gold and glory... we die!

WE DIE!!!

In conquest we find peace of mind
Our lands grow vast, men fear our kind
Before our gods they all shall kneel
Or spill their blood upon The Wheel

With clash of steel and dragonfire
This town shall be a funeral pyre
The gods declare this land our right

Behold the mighty dragonflight
Let retribution come this night
For gold and glory... we die!
