Raise the chain
and trap their ships against the current and the walls
Pick off the traitors one by one
Our catapults rain down a vicious brew
that burns a deadly hue
Their blood shall stain the river's run
In flames this battle shall be won

Green fire burns this night
Islands of floating death on waters high
Setting men and ships alight
This horror raining down from smokey skies
Green fire shines so bright
Lighting the waters of gruesome fate below
Many men shall die tonight
Bearing witness to the pyromancer's show

"Halfman!" they cry
My men rush forth to take their lives
This night we will not let the city fall
"Halfman!" they cry
I thrust my axe into the sky
This night I will not let our kingdom fall

Just past the gates
The muddy soil has claimed the victims of the flames
I take my men across the gorey waste
The beach is riddled with ruined ships
and ruined corpses scorched and torn
Those who braved the waters and reached the shore
shall die by the sword
