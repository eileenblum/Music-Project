Towers of pride
Harren's hand over God's Eye
A testament to his Ironborn hubris
Touching the sky
Black fingers reaching high
No greater castle should ever rise

These halls of broken stone
Shall bleed your life and throne
The ghosts of Harrenhal
Now guard these cursed walls

Don't you know, these walls can not defend
What you sow, your pride shall be your end
No where to go, these walls are closing in
No where to go, the dragon fire descends

Dragon lords rise
Flying down from the hillside
To conquer and bring Harren's demise
Touching the sky
Firey fingers reaching high
Burning all who remained inside

The haunted halls
Whisper secrets at nightfall
Telling tales of Harren's downfall
Beware of pride
That blinds your eyes
For all who live here will surely die
