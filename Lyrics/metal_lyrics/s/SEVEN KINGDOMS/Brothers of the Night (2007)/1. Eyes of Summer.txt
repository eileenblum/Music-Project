Out in the dark,
At home on the edge.
I'm climbing on top of the world.
As north wind blows,
I stand on a ledge,
With burning green eyes at the wall.

I'm running free!

[Chorus:]
The Eyes of Summer will carry me north.
To my destiny after the the fall.
Seeking the secrets of forgotten forces.
Awakening beyond the wall.

Learning to fly with my unopened eye,
Yearning to fly with the raven so high.

Run to the north,
Across barren waste.
You'll find me inside of your dreams.
In haunted woods,
Where others await.
And nothing's as safe as it seems.

Deliver Me!

[Repeat chorus]
