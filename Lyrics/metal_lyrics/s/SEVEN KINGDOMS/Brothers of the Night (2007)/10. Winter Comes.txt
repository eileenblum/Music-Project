The north wind blows bringing this summer to an end
It's been the longest one by memories of men
Some say a grim omen of long winter to come
I say a welcome to its unforgotten song
A man in black comes fleeing from the northern Wall
I bring my sword down and I see his head fall
My son and bastard race off toward the castle
But on the way they find a corpse in the snow

A rotting bitch with bloody neck wound
Six direwolves came from her womb
Three to my sons, two for my daughters
One white as snow left to the bastard

Winter comes hailing troubled times for the future of our world
We'll stand and endure the cold 'til the summer comes again

A banner waves a crowned stag on golden field
My friend and king arrives and so I bend to kneel
He would have none of it and bid his friend to stand
He comes to ask my place be at his right hand
Should I agree I'd leave my home and family
Should I refuse I would dishonor my fealty
Hand of the King - I'll rule in the king's stead
Though with this power comes a target on my head

A direwolf of my name's banner
Had taken antler to the neck
Could this be my kin's future
I dread to think what happens next

To the Keep, where the truth lies buried beneath a web of lies
I'll seek the answer to the riddle left to me

The last Hand had left the secret
His final words on tortured breath
"The seed is strong," but not of Robert
And now he rides off to his death

My friend is dead and I find myself caught up now
in this Game of Thrones you win or die,
so my fate is sealed this day

WINTER COMES!
