Imprisoned for so long
I forgot the light of day
Until the man in black came for me
He said he wanted me for the wall
I gladly agreed
To save my life and be free

So now I will take the black
For my freedom and honor
I shall give my life
Brothers now join in this watch
We will walk on the Wall
for the rest of our lives

I'll be one of the brave and few
Speak this oath by old gods and new

By the walls of Castle Black
I swear to raise my sword
and defend all of Westeros

We are watchers on the Wall
We are the brothers of the night
We are the ravens in the snow
We are the keepers of the light
Night gathers, and our watch begins.

Tonight the dead shall rise

This night is colder than ever
The Wall stands silently
I smell a stench on the breeze
A soft noise from behind
I hear distant shuffling
Something evil is coming for me

It shall not end until my death.
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
I shall live and die at my post.

I am the sword in the darkness.
I am the watcher on the walls.
I am the fire that burns against the cold,
the light that brings the dawn,
the horn that wakes the sleepers,
the shield that guards the realms of men.
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch,
for this night and all the nights to come.
