Blood of the dragon, flows through my heart.
A silver maiden born to be bought.
My brothers torment I've ever known.
Waking the dragon against his own.

For all the pain that you had wrought,
I never thought,
This day would ever come.

Love, hate, pain, suffering.
The cycle starts again with every day.
I lived your design,
Naive in truth 'till my destiny took me away.

[Chorus]
So my sun and stars,
My hero from afar,
Go give the king his crown of gold.

The beggar king had dared to raise his sword.
In the peaceful hall of the horselords.
Some little part of me would set him free.
Instead he'll die this night, by my decree.
