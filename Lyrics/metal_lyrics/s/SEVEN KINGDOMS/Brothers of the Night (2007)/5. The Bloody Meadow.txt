I am the king of rhymes.
I'll choose the songs you will here tonight.
Just drink up your wine,
And think not of tomorrow's fight.

So I take you far away,
To times of oldand, maidens fair as day.
And heroe's legend told.

In blood and steel you'll see.
Immortal songs of victory.
I keep eternal life,
My songs will live on, though I shall die.
So think not on strife,
Or what may come at battlecry.

When our eyes grow dim and pale,
The songs remain to tell the tale.

So take up your sword in hand.
Even as the last man dies.
Cry out loud and make your final stand.
And my song shall rise.

And red the grass beneath his feet,
And red his banners bright,
And red the glow of settig sun.
That bathed him in its light.
"Come on, come on" the great lord called.
"My sword is hungry still".
And with a cray of savage rage,
They swarmed across the hill.

So I take you far away, to times of old.
And maindes fair as the day,
And heroe's legends told.

In blood and steel you'll see.
Immortal song your desitiny.

I saw the seed of song.
All hear the tales I tell, of days bygone.
Of right and wrong,
And life and death under the sun.

Now hear the legend and lore.
These songs live on forever more.

So take up your sword in hand.
Even as the last man dies.
Cry out loud and make your final stand.
And my song shall rise.

And red the grass beneath his feet,
And red his banners bright,
And red the glow of settig sun.
That bathed him in its light.
"Come on, come on" the great lord called.
"My sword is hungry still".
And with a cray of savage rage,
They swarmed across the hill.

And there he stood with sword in hand,
The last of Darry's ten.

I sing your song this night,
A tale of rebellion's tragic end.
Like second sight,
Recall the day you fell again.

Then you drew your final breath,
Immortal life given in death.

And red the grass beneath his feet,
And red his banners bright,
And red the glow of settig sun.
That bathed him in its light.
"Come on, come on" the great lord called.
"My sword is hungry still".
And with a cray of savage rage,
They swarmed across the hill.
