Another lifetime in this maze
The page is blank again today

I don't know the words
Or where they go
All I know
I want to find the rhyme and see
The key that opens
The mind to be set free

How do you see?
You've been blinded by time
Inspiration, illusion of mine
Throw it all away
Wait another day
But what good is all that now?

I have no other choices!
These words, they evade me
I've taken my chances!
Let it be what it will be
No more will I seek!
No more will I try!
Here is a story
Awakened from nothing
Nothing at all

Another try, break this vice
Once again we go, 'round and 'round
The words made sense so many times
Just to be thrown away in the end

I have no other choices!
These words, they evade me
I've taken my chances!
Let it be what it will be
No more will I seek!
No more will I try!
This is killing me!
But here is a story
Awakened from nothing
Nothing at all
