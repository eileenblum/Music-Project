On the walls painted stone
High in the sky the fire shown
Wide-eyed by what's unknown
Silenced by questions we still don't know

Ignorance and fear shatters all they know
By the gods they're saved
Enslaved and afraid
Bewildered by what's untold

The one stands above
Looming over his own or over his drones?
Questions answered by gods

From another time
A being in their prime
As they knelt
Was there more than eyes could see?

Who's the face behind the throne?
Stargazer question the unknown!

Thoughts of standing on martian land
Fill up our heads, drive our commands
Are we alone or just in the past?
Do we pull the strings, or do we have to ask?

At the edge of space or not at all
Who really knows
We are the ones who long for the answers

I walk in judgement's shadow
Fear me or die
Subconsciously a stranger to me is divinity personified?

We just want to know
What it's like to know
What it's like to understand
Divine sleight of hand and see...

Who's the face behind the throne?
Stargazer question the unknown!

[Solo]

[2x]
Who's the face behind the throne?
Stargazer question the unknown!
