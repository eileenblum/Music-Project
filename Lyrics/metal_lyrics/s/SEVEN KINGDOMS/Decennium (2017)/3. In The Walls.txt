Cursed by my name
I am no fiend
I know their stories are lies
Whispered tales: dark and obscene

Can't you hear them alive in the night
These bastards--they will not let me sleep

I am no monster

You must believe me
I am not guilty
It was the rats in the walls
Leading me further
Perpetual horror
Into the cellars below

Death, blood on my hands
Padded walls surrounding me
I can't believe what they say
Damn them all
It wasn't his face on that fungous thing
It's voodoo, I tell you
That spotted snake
I'll teach you to mock my family

I am no monster

You must believe me
I am not guilty
It was the rats in the walls
Leading me further
Perpetual horror
Into the cellars below

[Solo]

Can't you hear them alive in the night
These bastards--they will not let me sleep

I am no monster

You must believe me
I am not guilty
It was the rats in the walls
Leading me further
Perpetual horror
Into the cellars below

You must believe me
I am not guilty
It was the rats in the walls
