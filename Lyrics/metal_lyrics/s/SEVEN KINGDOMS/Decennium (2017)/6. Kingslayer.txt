I swore a vow to protect the king
Whose rule knows no empathy
Rape and murder if he please
How can I defend a monster willingly?

Rebellion is coming
Soon the gates will fall

Wildfire beneath the streets
If all should fall, it'll burn so beautifully
Left alone to guard the keep
Reed banners march, come to save me

Rebellion is coming
Soon the gates will fall
Honor be damned
I must save us all

Oh-oh-oh
King of madness
Your time has come
By my hand your reign will end
This city won't burn

I have resigned my fate
One hero none shall love
Betrayer of the oath
The kingslayer
