I am bound
To protect you
Unto my heart for love and burdens beared
I would give anything
Turn back time
Stop the curse
Save her life and mine as well

I give you truth to fight
and make it right
For my lily, my love still burns bright

In a pensive made of stone
Memories swirl silver-white and strange
Through my tears
You'll see me now
Hate me you have
The faceless hero
You never knew

A cross to bear, hero for the weak
A master of death you must be
Death is like a serpent's kiss
Cold as ice your demons creep
Don't let them steal your hopes and dreams
Pity the loveless living, the dead are free

You have your mother's eyes
Burning bright
My love, my light
