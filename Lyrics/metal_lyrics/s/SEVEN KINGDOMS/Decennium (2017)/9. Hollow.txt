Sometimes the only way
Sometimes you need to fly
Defy! I recognize
That I've worked too hard
Through the prize is not mine

There is no mercy
Power not honesty
Pain that motivates
With might and main

Welcome to what we've created
Our ruse left you frustrated
There's no apology
Power is paved with hypocrisy
Conception of madness all around
Turn the table, burn the crown
It's just a game you see?
In the end, you mean nothing to me.

Crossing bridges meant to be burnt
From the ash, stronger I return
Nothing in my way
Everything I've done has been done to me
Never bend my knee!

Live in shadows
No one will ever know
My heart's hollow
Hollow!
