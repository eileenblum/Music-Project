Swallow your pride, you are nothing
Bring yourself into my binding light
You're forever cast in my shadow
Running lost through the night

You'll never be what you were born to be
Only a servant in my design
Forever a fool, forever my tool
Now a child of my mind

I'll never play your game
Of ignorance and selfish pride
You want others to see, what you'll never be
Without me by your side

True color shows
You're a wolf in sheep's clothes
Look and behold
You're a wolf in sheep's clothes

I refuse to kneel
At the feet of your deception
I'll be anything I want to be
My future's my conception

Hidden behind a mask of pride
Is a man with a spine of straw
A man in the cold, huff, puff, and blow
Then down he will fall.

I'll never play your game...
