The emptiness is filled up within me
The pain consumes me
To the brim overflowing
I hear the silence so cold and overwhelming
So afraid and helpless
Nothing can help this

Darkness surrounds me
It fills my weary soul
Darkness consumes me
This light shall I see no more

I feel it coming quickly
I fear time my mortal enemy
Broken here I lie
A tragic dream
I cry

The last breath soon to come
Taken from me a chance to see
A chance to be
In the darkness, I must wonder
The in between of life
Only truth shall set me free

Darkness surrounds me...

I feel it coming quickly...
