All controlled by this world
Dreams shadowed by their walls
All this masses heed the call
Prisoners of the lie
Deveived to never try
Brought down by the iron hand

Our strenght will shine on
Only we can choose the path
Our quest for liberation
Finally here at last

Open the gates (Open the gates)
To the threshold of dreams
From pain endured
Choose your own fate
Darkness will fade (Darkness will fade)
All light to embrace
Power is yours
These chains must break

We were born to rebel
No longer locked up in this hell
Forever glory we will dwell
The strong will ride to face the hordes
By our blades driving force
Rays of light shine through the storm

Our strength will shine on...

Open the gates...
