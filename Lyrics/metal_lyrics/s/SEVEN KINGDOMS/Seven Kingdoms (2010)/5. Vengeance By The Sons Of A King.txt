Thor's hammer filled the sky
While waves wrecked his ship
Our fathers were bitten by vipers
Then cast into a pit
If only King Aella knew what he had done
He would have saved his own life from Ragnar's Sons

NOW WE RIDE!
On horseback may our banners fly
WE RIDE!
To York where the king must die

Led by a boneless man on a throne made of steel
Lame he may be
But his arrows they will feel
(Punish the king)
York now a town of red, only Aella to Attack
Revenge was brought by an eagle carved in his back

Land was given to us in reparation
The king wanted us not to destroy his nation
Our banners fort was built in the kings land
His own warriors would help us make

OUR FINAL STAND!
Blood will be shed
BY YOUR OWN HAND!
Revenge by the Ragnar's Sons

Led by a boneless man on a Throne made of steel...
