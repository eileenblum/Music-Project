Out of darkness we will rise
Out of the dust of the earth
We build our empire to the skies
And set our eyes to the north
We spread our wings, prepare for flight
To show the world of our might
With steel and blood we conqure lands
Like a sickness we command

Our time to stand
At the hands of these foe

Clouds of evil
Encompass our lands,
Our homes, our fields, and our hearts
The knights of the south
Ride to the north
To take all that is ours

With thirst for blood in our souls
We ride unto northern shores
For our king we reap and sow
Thsi is the fate of the Norse
We take the homes of beast and man
We cut down all that lives and stands
The path behind us lays in waste
As their stories are erased

Now
Our final stand
To the destructor of all we know

Clouds of evil...

Now we take their homes and hearts
We hold a blade to the throat of their king
A slice at the neck is the fall of a nation

Clouds of evil...

An emanate doom
As the shadows loom
The enemy takes us with ease
We fight to the death
With every last breath
Our king brought to his knees
