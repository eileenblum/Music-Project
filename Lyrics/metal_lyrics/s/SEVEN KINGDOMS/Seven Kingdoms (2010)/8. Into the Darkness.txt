I drift away
Into the night
Underneath a blaze of starlight
I'll leave this world behind
My memories are fading away
All solitude shall reign

And if you say
"I can't remember your face"
Then I beg your forgiveness
I won't be afraid
Though blind I may see
I will see

I have fallen away (I've fallen away)
From the light (Far from the light)
Into the darkness (Into darkness blind)
No hope at my side (No hope at my side)
Into a dream (This is reality)
Reality seems so far away (So far away)
I open my eyes (I open my eyes)
To fantasy...

All I've betrayed
And all I've decieved
Visions of a past; so haunting
Blinded my eyes
Silent my voice
I walk the path of night

And if you say...

I have fallen away (I've fallen away)...
