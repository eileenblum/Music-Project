For our king, for our pride
To this battle we will ride
Let us charge with
Our swords in the sky

Aim for their heads
Make sure their hills are red
By our blades on this
Cold winters night

Seven days of freezing cold
Sleet, wind, and snow
Deep throughout the forest
Through the darkness we rode

The light of the moon will guide our path
The stars show us the way
We are warmed by the fire inside
The wants them to taste our blades.

Iolas defend
This sacred ground of fire
(By magic and steel we will take Drakken Hill)
Guide your men tonight
You'll need this alliance in the coming night

They surround Drakken Hill this night
(Prepare attack before the rising light)
Kings of past have given you the wings
(Now we charge for the rightful king)
Avenge the land on which I have bled
(Slaughter all make sure these hills are red)
Use magic of hero's past to gain
Trust the ones who breathe the flame

Gather round the fire my men
The battle is near at hand
Today is the  day we will
Take the sacred land
Betrayers ways now have torn
The oath of the flame
Ready your bows, axes, and swords
At dawn we make it rain

Iolas defend...

They surround Drakken Hill this night...
