What do we want
What do we see
Is it full of other dreams
Or is freedom in our minds

How much do we prolong
Doing what is right
This is the place we belong
I want to go...

Somewhere far away
Out of this world, away from today
Somewhere far away
Where can we be our own pathway

Now is the time
To follow what we believe
It can be true, it can be real
Don't be so naive

How much more will we prolong...

Somewhere far away
