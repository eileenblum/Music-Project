The hallowed books have forseen the day
When one shall lead thousands of their way
To the walls of a kingdom that once was theirs
Finall to take the throne as the rightful heir

He was cast out at the edge of two
Raised by the elves, trained under the moon
They told the stories of how his father died
And how he'll be a leader for his banners pride...

(The time is here - the books were clear)
You're the one to lead - GO!
(The fire inside-shown in his eyes)
Ride to take your throne

The wizard saw a vision in the crystal ball
He told the king about the impending fall
He said the chosen one was to come
"Prepare for battle protect the kingdom!"

To the king it was a mystery
This bilstery rewritten history
With his traning from the elves, not alone
The rightful king returns to take his throne

(The time is here - the books were clear)

A sea of men with dragons high
Charge down towards the walls
A rain of arrows and fire fills the sky
Today this kingdom will...Today this kingdom will fall
Bring down the walls

Ara guide my legion of men
through harms way and to victory on this day

We fought through the streets (Through the streets)
Led by prophecies elite (Prophecy)
To the throne he'll return (He'll return)
With vengence his veins burn (Veins will burn)
By the blood on our blade (On our blade)
The wicked shall be repaid (Be repaid)
Today the king will die (He will die)
And again our banner will fly (Banner fly)

As the smoldering kingdom began to collapse around the king
Iolas came before him with sword in hand to take his stand
"You will answer me!" he cried
"For all the wrong you have done"
The bloody sword claimed victory for all the Seven Kingdoms

He was cast out at the age of two...

(The time is here - the books were clear)...
