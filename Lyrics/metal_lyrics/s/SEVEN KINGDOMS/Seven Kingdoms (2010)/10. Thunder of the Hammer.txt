Our kingdom in peril
We fight for our lives
By mage and sword
Our enemy fought
With steeds of steel
They hold life in hand
Pray the kingom be restored

The enemy watches
From their towers of stone
We make our stand
We risk our lives
Fighting for freedom
For our king and sons
Giving life to our realm

We will fight
A light in the darkness
The hammer leads the way

(Thunder of the hammer)
Sound of victory
(Power of our kingdom)
Brings them to their knees
(Thunder of the hammer)
Now we hold the key
(Metal is forever)
Our binds will set us free

The battle rages on
A flame burns in our hearts
Their gates will fall
As we march to their keep
The end in sight
The valor feeds the fire
Our brothers give their lives
In the fight for victory

We will fight...

(Thunder of the hammer)...
