Dark dominion
Not a speck of light in sight
Feverish and fatigued I walk
Searching for that glimmer of hope
Am I destined to find that which I seek?
I follow the path laid out in front of me
I follow...

To who am I so bound?
Where is this free will that eludes me now?
To who am I so bound?
Where is my free will?
It eludes me now...

Blinded ever still
I attempt to claw my way out of this dark abyss
The precocious arcane knowledge that I possess feels drained
And alien to me now
Soon enough I will find you

I gather strength and release a flash of light
Revealing the soul of the darkness
It shows the way and a figure stands before me

All along you were present within me
Ages ago you vanished
Uncertainty, confusion, hatred, relief
You shall not escape again

Staring down at torment itself
I reveal all that plagued my soul
My hatred resurfaces

A sinister wave of energy emits from me
Haunting memories, I shall not back down...I unleash
Here you found your final resting place.
