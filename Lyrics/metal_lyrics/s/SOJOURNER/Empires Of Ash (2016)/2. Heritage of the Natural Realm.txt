Around me they circle
Emerald tones of past and present
Oaken beings stand tall
The sturdy mounds of granite surround us all
Sapphire glowing above
Bask in the glory of our mother

She protects us ever still...
And so we shall reciprocate
For without her glory
We are but lost souls on a journey to nothingness

Oh mother, hear our call
We summon you to show us the way
For we are lost in the wilderness...

Within us, we bear the torch
The virtues of our matriarch
Embedded in our every being, to be awakened
She is eternal

After the eras of our occupation we shall soon wither
And you shall so beautifully remain.
