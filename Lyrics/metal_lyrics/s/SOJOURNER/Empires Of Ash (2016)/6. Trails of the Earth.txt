Through the peaks and valleys, oceans, and fields
This wondrous habitat thrives

Serenity infects the skies
Peaceful as the evening clouds cry
And as amber rises at dawn
We reflect as if all is gone

The tides turn, the winds sway
And as it all rests on the drip of the hourglass
It shall renew itself and restore balance

Serenity infects the skies
Peaceful as the evening clouds cry
And as amber rises at dawn
We reflect as if all is gone

The tides turn, the winds sway
And as it all rests on the drip of the hourglass
It shall renew itself and restore balance

The earth roars with tremendous might
The power of its rumble, a flame ignites

Rejoicing in rays
Dampen my being
Sift through endless moss, a feeling so fleeting
To be regained once more
Through the ages, nature tore...
