On these frostbitten plains I await
A withering realm, a mere shadow of its former self
Dilapidated and lonely

We chose to fight for a cause
Honour, pride, dignity, and love
Through the passage of time, it became exposed
Attempting to reclaim what was never ours

From the pebbles that dance in the rivers
To the leaves that glide in the wind
The rays that warm the pastures
And the rain that spawns new life
We were once one
Now blinded by selfish deceit
Drifting further and further away

We were once one
Now blinded by selfish deceit
We drift further away
Through ashes of our once great host

Travel through continents to lands unknown
Yet we witness faceless clones of our adopted reality
Transcendence non-existent

The final bell begins to toll
Far from redemption
We slowly burn all scrolls
Extinction, we beseech

Anguished, I tread
Wondering why?

Watching all die
Empires of Ash, cry!

From the pebbles that dance in the rivers
To the leaves that glide in the wind
The rays that warm the pastures
And the rain that spawns new life

No longer shall we rise above our failures
No longer shall we chant
The end is nigh
We interred our kingdom...
