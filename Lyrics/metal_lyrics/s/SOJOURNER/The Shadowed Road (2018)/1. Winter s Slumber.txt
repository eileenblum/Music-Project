This eternal white as far as the eye can see
Remnants of eras long forgotten
Memories faded into the depths of mystery
Can I recover them?

I raise my head and breathe in deep
Words of the old ones fall to me
As snow on the mountain
I know this is how it should be
The long sleep of winter

This eternal white as far as the eye can see
Remnants of eras long forgotten
Memories faded into the depths of mystery
Can I recover them?

I raise my head, so far I see
Tranquillity...
The lake of death
Grasping the purity within

I shall rise, if not for long
To wither here in my final place of peace

No better place to glare upon one last time
I smile, I cry
I blissfully let go

"The woods are lovely, dark and deep
But I have promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep."

[Excerpt from the Robert Frost (1874-1963) poem "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"]
