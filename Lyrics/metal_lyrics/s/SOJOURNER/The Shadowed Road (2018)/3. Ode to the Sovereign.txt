The Sovereign
The roots set in
And as I fix my gaze upon you
I see beauty and pain
Shadows encircle these long lost grasps

Oh, Mother, what have we done?
Mere beasts we have become

We have forgotten our stance
In somber storms you dance
From your path we have strayed
Misguided and treacherous, we remain.

Long since we knew
Whether we could stop ourselves
A bargain made with faceless gods
Of gain and progress
To you we call
That you might reclaim us
Consign us to your realm
Or we will surely fall.

The roots set in
I see beauty and pain
Shadows encircle
Ode to the Sovereign.
