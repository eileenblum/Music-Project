Draw your sword
Look me in the eyes
We were born for this moment
But the memories cloud my mind
Of all that we have done
I swore I would protect you
But what have you become?

From the moment our hearts began beating
This gap would be filled

Preordained assassination of the crippled mind
Lost in an ancient sea of time

As whirlwinds dance on paths once trod
By beings vast, alone we stood
And waited for it all to end
Could you not see?

You were always there by my side
The comfort of my very being
The monster you are has me blind
I want to let you walk away but I boil inside

For your faults you shall fall
Reluctant beating slows you to a crawl
The whistling sound of steel
Sliding against your dry flesh
Proved to be my final and ultimate test
As the blade retracts so too do my tears fall
Heavily, I sob

I'll always wear you on my sleeve
A reminder of my undying love for you
Until my dying day, I'll carry your memory
Within the walls of my mind, you live forever on
