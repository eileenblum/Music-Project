Nothing will ever be the same again
These valleys forsaken now

This distant roar like a whisper
On the blooded horizon

Mother of this world
Your tears burn my skin
And the scars shall open my eyes

Cold are the spaces between the stars
But death is just a waking dream
We're all wanderers in dust

With all the ruin I've seen
I still wonder about life
Standing fearless

As I realize the end
Lift me up above
This universe of glass
Where sorrow no longer
Encircles the blossoming fields

Thus I'm banished to the hell of others
To shatter this burden
I'll carry the weight
To the point of Hedonism
I shall revel in disgrace
Only to be born again

We were here to caress the void
Of the dying serpent sun
Winter tears my guilt apart
Spread across the heavens
And dim is the veil
Crashing down
