A premonition of horrors awakens me from slumber
A darkened reality eaten by entities unrecognizable
What did I just see?
Sweat trickles
Through these dense and lively forests I walk
Yearning to discover what it was

This beautiful golden stream of life
I mustn't walk too far in
Obtaining cognizance is my only option
Turn around, flee

In time the grey smoke would surround
Screams of agony
Thick as fog at dawn but yet so shallow
What energy shall I muster?
My exertions are futile

In shadows you have prevailed
Your only door left open is that of defeat
You have plagued for far too long
I cannot allow you to leave

I carry the key to the lock of the netherworld
A realm lost to space and time
Here is where you will dwell and relinquish your claim
To the stranglehold you so fiercely grasp

You forever withdraw to the blackness of inanimate existence

Yet with peace restored...
The brightest light casts the darkest shadows
