Through the endless shadows we turn
Amongst the fires of the past we burn
For the sake of the child we fend
Yet unto an unknown will, we bend

For these flames that urge to caress our skin
Wears us down much too thin

To the highest mountain I shall walk
Through fields uncertain
Where I fought
There rises unbeknownst a cry
Culpability smiles

Seething and keeping watch
Once again it is all my fault

I must evade lest they hear
These struggles brought in agony
The starlit smouldering sky
Where arrows burn in flight

There remains yet a flicker of hope for you
Awaken, set forth and persist
Born out of despair, flames, and grief

This power grows ever so greatly within me
For there is no place left to hide

For the anger in me won't subside
My eyes have much to tell
And your empty stare will lead us into your hell
For I always knew you were already gone

Every passing day it is you I miss
My final message to you is this
From the sorrow and rage, I desist
Unrequited, I no longer exist...
