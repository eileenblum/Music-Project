I've seen your heart turn into stone
So cold that my tears frozed
I've watched the fire die in your eyes
Fire that was once full of life

All my life I've hunged to my pride
Reprendance sets me on fire
Don't shed a tear for me
As I did cry for You

Within my last hour - would you hold my hand
Within my last hour - would you share my pain
Within my last hour - would you know my name
Within my last hour - would you hold my hand
