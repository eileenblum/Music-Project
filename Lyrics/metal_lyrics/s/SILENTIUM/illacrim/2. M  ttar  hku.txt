Down from heaven to our side
Fell the first dawn of light
Shadow that casts from mighty bird
Binds the skies to mother Earth

On the silent night of north
When spirits dance on winter skies
You can hear the wind talk
With the voices of the deads

River runs within me
River flows I'll breath
Lone wolves cry you're one with us
Like one of them I'm free

Be one with all the living things
Be one with all four wings
To mother Earth we belong to
Mun enni lii mÃ¡ttarÃ¡hku
