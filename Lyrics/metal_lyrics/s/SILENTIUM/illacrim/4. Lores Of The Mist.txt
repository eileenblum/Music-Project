I wanted to see the moon
Touch the heaven's roof
More to know than I knew
My soul escaped from the Wolf
MÃ¡ttarÃ¡hku kept her own
Mother Earth gave my skies
She brathed out my soul
More I see as one who flies

My kinsman the water
Deepriver my brother
My sister the Moonlight
Mother Mist of the night
Times to come she knows
Lightning stroke her soul
Eyes as blue as the rain
She is the Thunder's maid

As a raven in the skies
I saw the mighty Storm
Saw Seita throw his spears
The Thunder spoke with roar
His arms arose like waves
Into holy Ãnar lake
"As I have took ten lives,
One gifted-one I'll make!"

He looked over earthground
He sought a place all day
A water woumb he found
On his sacrificial bay
With a witchcraft she was blessed
On a poor fisherman's boat
With the spirits she was dressed
I was silenced with an oath
