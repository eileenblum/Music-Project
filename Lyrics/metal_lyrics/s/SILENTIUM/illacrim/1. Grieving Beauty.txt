In a deep blue sea of her dwelling grief
She's breathing the pain that flows in her eyes

Like the deepest fear that you've always felt but never shown
And as you cover me with the wings of sorrow
I shiver from cold

My pain, my sorrow, it walks with me, it lives through me
Like the darkest moment of an autumn night that lives in me

"...Oh how beautiful she is
Dresses in the darkness of her heart..."
