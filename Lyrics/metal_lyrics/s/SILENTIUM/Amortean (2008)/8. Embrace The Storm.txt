The clouds a weep
A roofless church
The rain it sweeps
The altar burned

The heavens rot
The night she died
"Lest we forget"
Lost souls the cried

A shrapnel wound
A shrapnel through saviours flesh
Their hate it burns
Their hate it awe brightness

Still hear them moan
In a bloody mess
Amongst the wolves
The dreadful sheep

Embrace the storm
And fear the death
Gently the gale
Bolting your breath

Embraced the storm
(Embraced the storm)
And the children's tears
Through burning fields
Now the evil's here

Embrace the storm
The breath of hate
It will all be gone
It will be too late

Embrace the storm
Fondle your fear
With human form
It's drawing near

Embrace the storm
And fear of death
Gently the gale
Bolting your breath

Embraced the storm
(Embraced the storm)
And the children's tears
Through burning fields
Now the evil's here
