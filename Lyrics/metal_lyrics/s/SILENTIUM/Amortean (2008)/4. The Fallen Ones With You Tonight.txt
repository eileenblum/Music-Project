The fallen ones with you tonight
They fill your dreams with butterflies
Smiling as they watch you sleep
Flames devour their tiny feet

They're winged and horned, their halos burn
The floor is crawling, the moon has turned
They laughed with you upon night sky
You don't fell shame or need to hide

...The fallen ones with you tonight...
...Come close your eyes...
...The fallen ones with you tonight...
Come close your eyes

The fallen ones with you tonight
They fill your dreams with demonchrists
Cinnamon Rose and broken hopes
They'll soothe your skin with tender strokes

They'll chain you in a tree of life
The nails of snake teeth pierce your sides
Ice pick arrows through your chest
The clouds aflame, it's raining lead

...The fallen ones with you tonight...
...Come close your eyes...
...The fallen ones with you tonight...
Come close your eyes

The fallen ones...
Clear voice fills the midnight air
... with you tonight
"Closer, come and hold me near
Closer, under, over here"

They'll take you anywhere you like
Souls 'round you...
On a cotton candy horseback ride
...laying bare
Beyond the grace of God and light

You're drifting in...
...the pure starlight
The one, chosen wounds with gesture smiles

They'll let...
... you dream of things divine
The whirl of beauty

The whirl of beauty
The sudden storm

...The fallen ones with you tonight...
...The fallen ones with you tonight...

They'll chain you in a tree of life
The nails of snake teeth pierce your sides
Ice pick arrows through your chest
The clouds aflame, it's raining lead

...The fallen ones with you tonight...
...Come close your eyes...
...The fallen ones with you tonight...

They'll lift you up in ivory arms
Cyclone balloons in dolphin shapes
They fill your dreams
These dreams are full of fun and games
They'll soothe your skin

They're winged and horned, their halos burn
The floor is crawling, the moon has turned
They laughed with you upon night sky
You don't feel shame or need to hide

...The fallen ones with you tonight...
...Come close Your eyes...
...The fallen ones with you tonight...
