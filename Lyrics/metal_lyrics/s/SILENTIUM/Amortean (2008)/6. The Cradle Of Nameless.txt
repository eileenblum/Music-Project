Here, here is my peace in darkness and cold
Here, here in the sleep where you can behold
Angels are singing
Praising your grace
Blessing at dawn the grave without name

Hold me here in the deep
'cause when I wake the pain is too real

This, this is the pain that no one should feel
To let go of a child and everything dear
Stay with me please
'till dawn and light
Just let me sleep with my ghosts tonight

Drawn me into sleep
Hold me there with you
Let me dream you alive
Hush now come smile at me

Here is my peace
Here in the deep
Stay with me
Please let me sleep

Here, here, here...
Is my peace
Here, here, here...
In this deep
Stay with me
Please let me sleep.

Here, here is my peace in darkness and cold
Here in the sleep you behold
This, this pain that no one should feel
To let go on everything dear

Here is my peace
Here in darkness and cold
Here in the sleep where you can behold
Cradle is empty yet swinging tonight
Cradle of nameless is burning tonight

Here is my peace
