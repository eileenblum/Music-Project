Brothers in arms
Falling left and right
Flame of the world
Burning up bright

The machine it grinds
Souls, dreams and skulls
No one survives
It's yearning your blood

Leave the fallen behind
Just let your heart freeze
It's time to bury the dead

Don't look behind
The lost souls they claim
Don't stop the fight
Lest we died in vain

The dark closes in
All the stars falling down
Let the battle begin
Let our names to be known

Leave the fallen behind
Just let your heart freeze
There's no time for tears

Leave the fallen behind
Just let your heart freeze
It's time to bury the dead
