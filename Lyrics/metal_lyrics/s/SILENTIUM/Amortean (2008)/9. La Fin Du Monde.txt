There are words best unsaid
And these lonely days...
Have left them vile,
Have left them wolves
They feed before they prey

They told me lies of sunshine
When I felt the night
In the end we're all as jaded
Blind, beyond the light

All I have to wait for
Is the moon to rise
These nights in all their splendour
Remove my disguise

There are words best used unwritten
And these hollow days...
Have turned them real,
Have turned them wolves
They eat your love away

All I have to wait for
Is the moon to rise
Oblivion resembles bliss
Enough to sink to the abyss

Comfortly drowning
Vast nothingness growing
Vague heartbeat is slowing

Comfortly drowning
(Sleep is denied for those who understand)
Vast nothingness growing
(Dreams lucid as sky I'm forced to comprehend)
Vague heartbeat is slowing

Is the end complete?
