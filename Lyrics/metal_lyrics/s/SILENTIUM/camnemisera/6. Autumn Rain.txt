Let me hold you here
Let me carry all your pain
Let me hold you near
Shelter from this blood red rain

As I stand here alone, sorrow in my arms
I close my eyes, and see your smile
And this blood red rain, falls all over me
And this blood red rain, burns the wounds inside of me

As you stand there alone, sorrow in your eyes
I close my eyes and hear you cry

So let me hold you here...
