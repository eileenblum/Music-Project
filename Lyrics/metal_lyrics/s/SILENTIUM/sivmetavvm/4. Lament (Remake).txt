Alone  and dressed by night
cold winds  were filled with fright
And I, the woeful  wonderer,  with sin upon my shoulders
Would you show me how to feel, how to hurt and how to bleed
Like the rose thorns  through my heart,
every moment rips me apart
I would give my everything, if I could fly, if I had wings
And when I end my mortal days, you'll be flying above my grave
My mortal child of night, you'll be  gone by first dawn light
As I saw you in my dreams, my  angel with broken wings
Let me rest upon your  arms, safe from world  and safe from harms
Like  the blaze of  thousand sunsets, that sears upon your soul
My darling before you came,
my days  were dark and filled with pain
But there's time for every flame,
to burn out in the dark...
One day my fallen one, you'll spread your wings  and learn to fly
My tears lament you're gone, you'll combrace the open sky

Reviews
A new mini-cd filled with emotion the way only Silentium can:
Beautiful and built with vision.
With this mini-cd Silentium takes another leap forward,
pushing their sound into a perfect example
of how gothic doom should be done in the first place!
This release also contains old demotracks,
which only prove that Silentium was definitely a gem to be found!
