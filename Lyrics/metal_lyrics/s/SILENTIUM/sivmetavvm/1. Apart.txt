"It's like throwing oil into my flaming soul,
waking up at nights, alone, with memories of you..."
Don't leave me here
Don't leave me now,
While I'm breaking down
Don't push me  away
Don't turn away like there's nothing to say
I am burning
I know it hurt's too much
I am yearning
I 'm longing for your touch
Don't look away
My life would be done,
If you'd be gone
Just let me  stay
Just let me hold you here,
It's so cold and I fear...
I 'm still burning
I hurt you so much
I 'm still yearning
I 'm still longing for your touch
Tear  after  tear
Tear  me  apart
Tear  after  tear
Ripped me  apart
