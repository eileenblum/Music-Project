"... Alas, do not fear the wounds in my flesh,
but embrace me, for in my heart is the wound that doeth the bleeding..."
Contemptio in nomen tuum
Incendere in infernus
Dance for me your last
Before I wither and die
Your shivering lips to me
It's for you I bleed
Cover me with beauty
As I carry my chains
I'm drowning in your cruelty
But lust rips my veins
Symphonia carnalis (bella et permunt hostilia)
In tenebrae aeternum (pulcher sicut tua)
Kiss away my tears
And I'll suffocate you
Awoke my fears
It's for you I bleed...
Hold this beast in thine arms - For christ
Don't fear my wounds and scars - I shall suffer
If wounded by a thousand swords - For you
It's still you I bleed for - I shall bleed
