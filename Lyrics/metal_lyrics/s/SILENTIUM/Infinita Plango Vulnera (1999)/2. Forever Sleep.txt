Angel Who Seduced Me
Angel Who Betrayed Me
Angel Who Offered Me My Cross to Bear
Life Is Full of Agony
Life Is Full of Hate and Pain
Better Off is Child Who'll Never Breath
In Forever Sleep
Dream On My Child
In a Dream I Hear You Cry
You're With Me Every Night
Whenever You're Suffering, You're Pain Is Mine
All the Hate That Fills the Air
All the Pain We Call Our Lives
Better Off is Child That I've Never Seen
