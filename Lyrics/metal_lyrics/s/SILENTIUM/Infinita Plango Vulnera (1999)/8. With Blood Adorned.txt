Oh It Behoved Me
The Hilt in the Night
Though My Heart May Falter
I've Yielded to Fate
Such Peace in Her Slumber
Though She'll Never Wake
Black Swan Rising,
Spreading Wings
Forlorn by the Light of the Day
Take Me, Wraith of Witchery
Take This Pain, Oh Take Me Away
Oh It Betrayed Me
The Mirage so Fierce
Cursed and Tarnished Thine Name
Yet She Hath Nay Wrought
Foes Are Here My Dagger
Adornments of Blood
