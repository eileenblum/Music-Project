"Let those of you who deserted me, drown with me into the fiery pits of hell"
You took my hand
And we both were falling
You embraced me
And we both were drowning
Did I feel you here
Or was I only dreaming
Did I hear you sigh
Or was I only screaming
All is lost but pain I thought it would be fading
All is lost but hope of you arriving...
I woke again,
Arisen with the mornlight
And we both were falling...
Did I feel her now
Or was I only dreaming
Did I hear her sigh
Or was I only screaming
Don't let them turn
The knives deeper in her
And now I am forever falling...(falling...falling...)
How painful to feel
Her pain and emotion I heaved a sigh
Of poetic passion
She left again
Gone with the twilight
And now I am forever falling
