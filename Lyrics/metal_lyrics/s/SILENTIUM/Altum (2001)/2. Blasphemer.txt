"cursed be all those, who preach with a high voice
for the benefit of their hordes. For they are the weakest in faith,
and the darkest within their heart themselves..."
Blindfolded be the slumberer
For pain the blind eye turning
For in a nightmare wanderer
Seeks not to blame or hurt
Blessed be the blasphemers
For they are the sign of yearning
They are the true believers
They are for faithless burning
Let the fallen heart be strong
In death and woe among
Let the fallen ones dream on
With blasphemer's passion
But cursed shall be the seekers
Who feel the hunger for the truth
For he who holds the answers
He speaks with poisoned mouth
So what's to gain
In this mortal lie
Nothing but the pain
Witch we call life
And cursed be the ones who preach
They truly are the hallow ones
Empty are all their believes
Deeper words for shallow hearts
