"...in these times, passion hath become more than any spirit,
haunted or divine; flesh hath become the image;
and our lust as the sacrament of it all..."
To feel lust for
For her innocence
Loins hurt for lust denied
Just by the thought of her
Betrayal in my eyes
Just by the sight of her
Come drown him with your naked skin
First to my god then into your grace
The more you want her
More dismay more slander
She will be crucified
For your desires
The seven sacraments
Of pleasures of the flesh
Oh come to me
-Who is this woman
Please touch me
-Deity of lust
Oh, kiss me
-She is your god
Just lay with me
-She is everyone
