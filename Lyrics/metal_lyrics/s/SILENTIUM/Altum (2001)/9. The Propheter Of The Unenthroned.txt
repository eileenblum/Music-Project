"...And Now, My Son, Open Thine Eyes Wide To Behold.
On Yer Crusade, Thou Have Become Infidel Thyself..."
In the times of my youth
The spirit spoke to me
Pay heed, and hear the truth
The signs art here to see
Courses of stars unscroll'd
For those who art yiel'd
The sight of time unpass'd
And the roar of battlefield
"Hark ye mortal, thou, who art yield
Bring forth for all mankind to hear
Forth, for all of the circle of the earth
These prophecies nine"
Hark mankind enthralleth false images of god
I shall reveal the crownless symbols of damned unfold'd
Behold, mankind enthralleth beneath the wrath devine
The signs of unenthron'd under the stormy skies
Hark mankind enthrallth so glorious in arms
Yiel for the unenthroneth in darkness so profound
"And the crowd dids't nougth but mockery..."
Behold, mankind enthralleth beneath the wrath devine
The signs of unenthron'd under the stormy skies
There is nine betrayed kings
And war for their revenge
There is nine of prophecies
Under the oath of silence
"Whence the sun aproach'd the western end of the world,
my oath of darkness was filleth..."
And now whence the war is raging
And banners darkens the skies
See the unenthorned arriving
As all of the battlefield dies
So dreadful to behol'd
As the spirit turned to me
The darkness was unfold'd
O' propheter, it's me!!!
And now whence the war is raging
And banners darkens the skies
See the unenthorned arriving
As all of the battlefield dies
