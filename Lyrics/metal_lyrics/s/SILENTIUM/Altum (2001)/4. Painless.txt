"...Let me drown within this river, let me drown in this deep silence...
...Where I will be forever painless"
What painful the chalice
She drank so calmly
There was his arms
Around her naked body
She still tastes his lips
With her mouth
A fragile rose
Was her heart broken
Still was the night
That peaceful night
When he arose
To walk away
You, speak to her,
Speak not of love
When all she had
Forever gone
Fall with her
Bleed with her
Betray her
Shred her soul
"Misera nobis
Dies illacrimo"
Still is the night
Silent the echoes
Iinto the void she drowns
Oh let the ocean devour her
Lifeless
Painless...
