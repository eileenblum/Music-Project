[spoken]
In the beginning people had nothing
Their bodies ached
And their hearts held nothing but hatred
They fought endlessly but death never came
The despaired, stuck in the eternal quiet mire

A man offer the serpent to the sun
And prayed for the salvation
A woman offered a reed to the sun
And asked for joy

Feeling pity for the sadness that had overrun the earth
God was born from those two people
God made time and divided it into day and night
God outlined the road to salvation
And gave people joy
And God took endless time away from the people
God created beings to lead and obedience to them
