Oh, I would be there with you, great Emptiness
Father of banes and oppressed grief
I feel I was taken through the eleventh angle
Or thrown into stars unlit by will

Shadows were there once over the past
As sulphur carried the Dragon's might
Magic flames wake now to twist and shine
And dance on your horns in candlelight

Long I've gone to keep my oath
And scatter your fragments of still
Unwished life behind the clouds
Of divine end, oh, where all sinks into

To finally feel the breath of no return
Faith of the magnificent fall

The circle has broken under the weight of doom
In madness we await your calling night
Magic flames wake now to twist and shine
And dance on your horns in candlelight

Long I've gone to keep my oath
And scatter your fragments of still
Unwished life behind the clouds
Of divine end, oh, where all sinks into

Soon, so soon...
Where all sinks into...

Long I've gone
To keep my oath
Unwished life
Behind the clouds

Long I've gone to keep my oath
And scatter your fragments of still
Unwished life behind the clouds
Of Divine End, oh, where all sinks into
