Fellows of none and all!
Look into the abyss!
Silence sounds as thunder
Cracking the sky of bliss.

Cast spins the world to end
To forming seeds of thee
Downfall of birth, we rise,
Unseen I wish to be.

I throw myself to void
The shades of bearing fire.
The day of wrath will come
Beneath the cosmic light.

The seventh aeon awaits now
Abaddon, I have to see
The destroyer of creation
Awaken I wish to be.

Break the broken
Aeshma diva
End over end

Cliffotic demons of chaos
Hail death above life.
Divine antithesis feeds
The aeonic inner fire

Believe in truth, fellows
The sense and breath betray
These flames burn high
As stairs of grand decay

Break the broken
Aeshma diva
End over end
Aeshma diva
End over end

[2x]
Behold.
Dark ones ascend
Impaled,
The truth shall scent.
