Drowning in the stream of solitude
Windborn shades vanish and appear
In dissolving touch of time we sealed
What dwells within us at the heart of fear

Thy presence longs to see the vessels of denial
The earthly possessions of the underworld
Celebrate! Beneath the stars I am nothing
And nameless for names, that moved me cursed

Mourning cut gateways
To the twilight of Styx
What I've lit with my wounds
That were never exist

Salvation grows trees from unfolding waves
That call me to take into the encarved shapes

Awake! Stare at the trees
That grown from within
Hell, chasm of nowhere
The inverted
