I'm near here between
The coldest fading lights
Her watching eyes beckon
How shall I march towards?

A mourning trace opens the Nightsky
Eclipse we've seen with our third eye
Beneath the stars I hold the

Crown of Doom
Across the end it burns
And dives into the deeps of the universe
Crown of Doom
Across the end it burns
And dives into the deeps of the universe

Upon the hills of Null
I dream the rays turn bright
With essence of the Lawless
I've left aeons behind

A mourning trace opens the Nightsky
Eclipse we've seen with our third eye
Beneath the stars I hold the

Crown of Doom
Across the end it burns
And dives into the deeps of the universe
Crown of Doom
Across the end it burns
And dives into the deeps of the universe

Come forth â beneath the stars
Return â I await the time
Come forth â beneath the stars
Return â I await the time
Come forth â beneath the stars
Return â I await the time
Come forth â beneath the stars
Return â I await the time
