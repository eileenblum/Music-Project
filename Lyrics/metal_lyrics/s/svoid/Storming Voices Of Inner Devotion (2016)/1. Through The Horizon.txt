Ye lunar serpent
Devour the sun
By the storming voices
Of our inner devotion

Let's cross the waves
Horizon of shades
Through subsiding shine
The aura of deeps
Awake me from grief
Dreadfully it shapes
So malformed and pale
A path awaits

Fallen through crimson death
I feed the fires

In abyss of time
Where darkness lays
Following the depths
Of a flashing snare
So I'm lighting the veil of Death
Beyond the flares
And in madness I'll touch
Unhallowed gates

Fallen through crimson death
I feed the fires
Fallen through crimson death
I feed the fires
Fallen through crimson death
I feed the fires
Near, within and beyond
