I crawl into the mist
Until it is sealed
Unfolding you black wings
Of sounds revealed

I go into the fire
Shining crystal clear
Returning to unknown
Black Flame we're

Reason of time
Is that remains
A soul in black
A mind in chains
Reason of time is that remains
A soul in black, a mind in chains
A mind in chains, a twisted mind in chains

Open the shell and rise!
Oh, elevate my name!
Lead to the burning ground
Of illuminated flame!

Make myself as one
In flames with you
Eater of the elements
Guide me through!

Reason of time
Is that remains
A soul in black
A mind in chains
Reason of time is that remains
A soul in black, a mind in chains
A mind in chains, a twisted mind in chains

I'm staring through
The astral plane
And I tear the distance
Explore the pain

Reason of time is that remains (reason of time)
A soul in black, a mind in chains
A mind in chains, a twisted mind in chains (a mind in chains)
