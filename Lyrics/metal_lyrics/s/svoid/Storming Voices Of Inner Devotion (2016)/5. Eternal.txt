Eternal, eternal, eternal
Eternal, eternal, eternal
Mist was born above the waves

Towers grow on storming seas
Enter them, see gods beneath
Down from the stream, out from mire
The veil takes form of life and fire

Eternal, eternal, eternal
Eternal, eternal, eternal
Mist was born above the waves
Eternal, eternal, eternal
Eternal, eternal, eternal
Mist was born by Eleven Gates

In blazing dark that reflects my doom
Wombs conceive the haze of Moon
Unsilence spells all-dissolving cast
The seventh seal of Left Hand Path

At the portal of Null and All
At the unforgiving light of mourn
I was there a thousand times
In that old stream of devour
I kneel before the waters
That once were and shall become
Above the pure emptiness
Under the roots of Leviathan!
The roots of Leviathan!

Eternal, eternal, eternal
Eternal, eternal, eternal
Mist was born above the waves
Eternal, eternal, eternal
Eternal, eternal, eternal
Mist was born by Eleven Gates
