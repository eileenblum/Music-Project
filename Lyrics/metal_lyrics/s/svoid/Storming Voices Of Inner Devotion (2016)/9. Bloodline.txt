Beyond reversed time of worlds
Less through the night
Within and without
Show space in sight

To the one of us from thou we hand to thee
The finite order of cosmos and singularity
What awaits above the strains shows obscurity
And dreadful darkness comes forth to awake the tyranny

Time has nothing for your might
The Sun you channel back tonight
Bloodline of fire
Bloodline ablaze

We're out of the space
Between two worlds
You who's within
On wings pass the Earth
Enter the faith of thee
Hiding, unbound
Queen of those below
It is all, it is none

Time has nothing for your might
The Sun you channel back tonight (tonight)
Bloodline of fire (bloodline)
Bloodline ablaze (ablaze)

Mist-covered chains of wrath
Wounding thousand shapes
Enlightened sorrow
Opens wide the gates
