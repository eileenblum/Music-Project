The hand of this pale moment
Did a sinister journey around
Hear the ore lung of adsorbed mist
The deathlike sound of devour

Deep down in the unknown of loss
Wrapped in the faith of time
I will walk on the fire of splendour
Approaching the other side

Which was so clear
And signed the hour
Too loud and depth
Followed by black vapour

Death, holy end
Up to the skies of birth
We are lone beholders of sorrow that glows the Earth

Death, holy end
Death, holy end

Glaze of coal that shines
And fires the yelled reverie
Ye graven faces in the shadows
Release us, oh Darkness! Set us free!

Death, holy end
Up to the skies of birth
We are lone beholders of sorrow that glows the Earth

Death, holy end
Up to the skies of birth
We are lone beholders of sorrow that glows the Earth

Death, holy end
Death, holy end
Death, holy end
Death, holy end
Death, holy end
