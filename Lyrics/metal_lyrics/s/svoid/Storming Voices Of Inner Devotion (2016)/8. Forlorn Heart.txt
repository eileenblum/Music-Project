We were like a storm
Faith and mind
Bringing you to shadows
Which are beyond

The maze of Doom hides
Tunnel of life
Lost in this thread
And fallen in strife

Light of darkness brightens all
These glowing gates we float toward
Light of darkness brightens all
These glowing gates we float toward

With forlorn heart

We were like a storm
Faith and mind
Bringing you to shadows
Which are beyond

Touch of flaring fate
Enslaves to rise
Calls to remember
To temple of burning signs

Light of darkness brightens all
These glowing gates we float toward
Light of darkness brightens all
These glowing gates we float toward

With forlorn heart

Illuminate our path above the world!
Light the corners beyond the time!
Come, resonance of sorrow
Come, Twofold Moon of Ain!

Light of darkness brightens all (light of darkness)
These glowing gates we float toward (we float toward)
Light of darkness brightens all (brightens all)
These glowing gates we float toward
With forlorn heart
