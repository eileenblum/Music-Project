Storming sky shows you the flaming sword glowing,
Evoke the Death spell, devour thy flesh.

Casting the hex, suffering yonder,
Death to the inferior.
Horned father, even further
Chaos beyondâ¦

Shapes of Death are emerging, oh, evil spells,
Blackness admists the shadows,
Standing at the edge of uncovered purity
We meet the Chosen Ones in dark and cold.
In the eyes of Death
We saw the dimensions of time
And the wrapping the Earth in Darkness,
In the flames of night our souls were burning
As weâre born in filth in the wombs of denial.

Towards the horned father
The Black Sun has shown the way,
Wiped out the flood of sorrow
I enter an another sphereâ¦
