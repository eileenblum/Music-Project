Sniff within the flames of the Acausal Fire
To cast the shine of the post-cosmic seal,
Deep in the Void, towards the flesh
Along the gates of the assembling Death.

Unleashing the beastsâ¦

Blackened waters rising deep within
Trapped in Nowhere in the shadow of edges.
Awaken and pure, possessed by the bounds,
What will be there beyond the bloodstains?

Unleashing the beasts in itâs time
To rising as an eternal black spell

Evil has revealed in short timescales
Tied down the event horizon
Reverberations into momentums outward
Were rewritten
In a new dawn of Ar.
