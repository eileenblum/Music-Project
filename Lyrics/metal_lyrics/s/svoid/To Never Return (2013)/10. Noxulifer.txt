Above all, beyond the gleaming formless shadows
The sixth form to complete is near, I stand for
To hate and love, embraced by clean blood,
To feel the grace.

Everlasting euphoria â streams of my eternal beauty,
Awakener of forever Black Flames enthroned.
You are here all to fill the baneful spell
With mistress and innermost essence.
Within the ecstasy of war â Hail the lawless becoming,
Shape the inner dark flame and the Rising Beast!
Lord of Eternal Conquest
Call on the seventh star;
I invoke Baal!
