Equal powers emerging
Concealed inside the whole,
Random process of destiny
Towards than even there below.
Dark Mother, rise up the spirits
Of the eternal raging night
With the flames of time and timeless
In the purest blackened light.
Hear the enormous death bell
Opening the gates to the other side
Taste the blood of Kingu,
Savoring the damnation of dark.

Infinite length of fading,
Bounded by the gathered dark shadows
We are hidden now from the edges of night
As the eyes of an unhallowed.

Moving towards the Void
We are obsessed by this pulse.
Entrancing, pass-out phenomenon
Misconcepts our deadly illusion.

It will slide down as it passes
And continue as it recedes,
Equal to Nothing,
Transformation, reverted.

Beholding the pulse â Infernal waving of waters.
Falling into Void â Into unbounded hunger.

Beholding the pulse â Infernal waving of waters.
Falling into the Void â Into unbounded hunger.
