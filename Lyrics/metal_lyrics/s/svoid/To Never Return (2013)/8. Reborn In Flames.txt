Visions from the depths of the abyss I see
As the glowing darkness floats within me
For it was the flame of dominion and wrath
I have found the only key to the night.

Hatred who serve the firstborn of blackness,
Show me the path to the only relentless,
I am chained with my flesh to the will
Of my father, Malfeitor, burning deep within.

To the fire of the misery
Be humble for all times and open the gates
Yet one with the earth,
This is the night to reborn in flames.

Dark Mother, open the shell of Sithra Ahra
The filthy womb of the malformed ones,
Let me feel the warm of the formless flames
Yet unchained, yet bringing to another place.

I am the core of the evil restless rising
I am who you let into the new era of devouring,
I am the son of Death as soon it comes and enslaves
Mighty Black Dragon rise! Reborn in Flames!

Amam! Shadow-Self! â I fell into Eternal Night,
Into the channel of the sinister Moon!
Quetu! Hallowed night! â I lend your darksome fire
âIn nomine Chaos, vocamus te Hekateâ
