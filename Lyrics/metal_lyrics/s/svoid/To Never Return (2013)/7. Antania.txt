To the Death,
You who dwell beyond the light and darkness,
The gates are open to enter,
To set foot into the fullness of all.

I am the power, and I am your Void,
Unification of black spell.
We are standing beyond
The fate of the beginning and the endâ¦

Oh, Nameless One!
We may rise up from the ashes of Doom,
Liberated and deathless,
We arouse you from our churning blood!

Oh, Antania!
We confess ourselves blinded by your wrath,
By euphoric ecstasy
We join into the domain of the hallowed path!

Reflections, your will
Feeds the flames of Him
Beneath the pure emptiness
Of forever burning.

Antania, your pure hatred
Brings the forever fullmoon
In our eternal glare,
Enslavement.

Antania, your fingers
Are strangling the weak,
With possession of sorrow,
Serpents yonder.
