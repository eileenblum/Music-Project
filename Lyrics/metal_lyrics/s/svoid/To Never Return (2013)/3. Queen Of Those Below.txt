Darkness flows from within the deepest sorrow,
I glance down upon the waters,
The dancing grey skies slowly darken,
Embraced by Death with Fire.

Coldness stills the blackened forests
That leads me places I know not where,
I hold the key to the Void
To reflection at which I stare.

Fulfilled sickening emptiness
Within uncovered fields
Of the mourning voices,
I hear the call for the restless risingâ¦

Black Light is emerging to show the gates
And bless the borders of miscreated shadows.
Through the blackness to the Unknown
Iâve lost myself in this empty lairâ¦

Worship â still aware!
Emptiness â remembrance!
On the horizon â unreal!
No colours were there untilâ¦
