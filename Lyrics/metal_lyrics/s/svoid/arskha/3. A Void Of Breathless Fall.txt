From afar
Dressed in flames,
bloodred, she appears.
In a shapeless, dimensionless void,
timelessly;
Nothingness is being soaked with our Blood
In this darknessâ¦
Her edges completely wear away,
vividly vibrating, approaching;
turning back into herself from herself.
Her cold touch, oh, endlessly sweeping.
Leaving an unholy mark in bones and blood.
I canât see but feel that she has come
and that I would sacrifice my blood.
Having taken a piece of me,
leaves tasteless bones beneath my flesh.

Lifeless, ignoble flesh am I,
only a body for this evil flood.
Iâm mounting her taste and blood,
and our glowing desireâ¦

Lifeless, ignoble flesh am I,
where icecold beauty returned,
flesh gains meaning,
it burns and I crave
for having it torn
with new claws apartâ¦
