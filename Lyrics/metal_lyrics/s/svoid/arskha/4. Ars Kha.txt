Surrounding euphony brings the all-consuming fire
And the hungry blaze of the eternal Black Light.
Hail the mighty throne at the South of the abyss,
Hail the purifying flame!

Tree of Death shall shape the aeon
Through my satanic Dark will.

Whispering of cold wind sounds the chords of Void,
Through Nothing we are spreaded by the wings of Silence.
Hail the Screaming hush, the harbringer of Doom,
Hail the wings of Death!

Living dusk of Nightside, ye Infernal Blackness,
Reveal thou the opener of the forbidden secrets.
Hail thy Nightside, the third corner of Light,
Hail the spoken wisdom!

Spill the blood, oh Mother Kali,
The bringer of Wrath,
With hatred open the veins, thou madness.
See the eyes, blind shining of Prime Evil,

I call upon the Beast!

Tree of Death shall shape the aeon
Through my satanic Dark will.
Sounds of Silence shall take me far
To the final cleansingâ¦
Chaosâ¦ Beyondâ¦
