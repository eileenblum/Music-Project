The darkest threads,
flooding as blood
from these formless shapes
Entwined in naked infinity
beyond life
Borders crumble, limitless reigns
As flames destroy these earthly liesâ¦
Within the devouring pits of fires

Broken motions of silence
in vibrating, glowing darkness
time spent within the timeless
a curse of restless desires

Chaos, ripping the flesh apart
of those, tasting the blackest depths
of torn completion
Purest inner divine
