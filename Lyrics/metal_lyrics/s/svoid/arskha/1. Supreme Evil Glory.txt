I reach the Void of Doom
When Evil eats it from within
Beyond desecration I stand
As the smell of Death is crawling
Darkness is my unholy pride
In the malform of this divine circle
With unpure hands of Evil I hold
The seals of tortured Death bliss

The Fallen One
Thy Dark Master
Ultimate Doom
Darkness reveals
Serpent of chaos
Thou shineth
Floating diversity

Through the dreams of night descending
Shadows appear under
And eyes are glowing by
The great Chaosâ¦

I see myself in them,
night releases
Wind carries the scent of passing
Illuminating thy lord,
goddess of Death
Supreme art of thou,
Evil One
Supreme Evil Glory,
I invoke

The Fallen One
Thy Dark Master
Ultimate Doom
Darkness reveals
Serpent of chaos
Thou shineth
Floating diversity

Supreme Evil Glory
