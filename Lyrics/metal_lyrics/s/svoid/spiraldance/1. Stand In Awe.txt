All along the shining pieces
Of a mirror I need a way
In the haze a tongue is hiding
But no word to say, oh

Greeting the newborn flaw
Awake and stand in awe!

What are untold are traceless;
Made of only dust and grains
Every dream I dream is hand down
Marvelled in Doom

Greeting the newborn flaw
Awake and stand in awe!

Now I must thrive and break down the Earth
As pain erects the flesh from the marble tombs
Hollow the time, prevail the Death of the Sun
Recoil from what I become
The breath of skies
Timeless peace

Circling into the End
Greeting the newborn flaw
This is the Spiral Dance
Awake and stand in awe!
