Self-deception
Wide my visions vast
Fate of flames I see so bright

Self-obsession
Dwell deep with coldened heart
Break me down under the stars
The stars

The very hours never raise
When winds are blowing cold
A tragic failure I stand
The path where no one goes, no one goes

Self-accession
Running through my veins
There's all the high beyond the spheres

Self-infliction
Erase the will to improve
To leave the markless road
- No fated to be here

On these nights of horror
With sand-filled eyes
I light the whist unclean

The very hours never raise
When winds are blowing cold
A tragic failure I stand
The path where no one goes, no one goes
