I crave my captor
She's been gone so long
She just sits there staring
Could there be something wrong?

I found the reason
She swallowed the pills
And we just sit here thinkingâ¦
So how come she's not blinking?

Why am I sitting by myself?
Why won't she talk to me?

She's so pale
But I won't let her go
Cuz she's just making me nervous
But soon we'll be home
