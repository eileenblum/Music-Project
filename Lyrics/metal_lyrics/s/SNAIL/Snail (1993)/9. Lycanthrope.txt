Be gone! Cry in your own head
We all have our own itchings
See more of my true nature
Those rings are strung on the table

I'm gonna find you

It's strange the fuel of my anger
It's shameless the way that we murder
Sometimes I hear the demons buzzing
And I know it's time for the hunting

You'd go good with some butter
You'd go good with white bread
I wanna suck all your butter
And I wanna fuck up your head

Can't say it but I feel something
Yeah like the sun in my chest
Exploding yet coming together
Together like something obsessed
