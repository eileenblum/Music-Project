I heard a gunshot
Did you hear a gun?
It's close to me, too close to me
He's out there watching
His whiskers twitching
Try to see, don't look for me
Don't like your driving
So just let me walk
Just a mile, 200 miles
Inside I'm searching
That blackened tension
For to die, it's lonely

It's getting harder
To get out of bed
It's out there that I fear
Come on and try me
Sprung tight like teething
Oh no, that doorbell
And death she's crawling
Her mouth parts suck this
She's so sweet and loves me
Devour my essence
It's time to go now
With patent swears I cried aloud:

Intuition
