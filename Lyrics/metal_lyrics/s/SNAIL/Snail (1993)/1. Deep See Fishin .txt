Since I saw you the last time
Things have changed on the inside
I got back from the desert
Found my Self in the sand

Lonely, spirit
Take my Self away
Still sweet, god flesh
Take me, cure me

Cried out to you and you showed me
Speak your sweetness in my ear
I climbed all of your mountains
Each peak a beacon to my home

Since I saw you the last time
Found my Self in the sand
I climbed all of your valleys
My desert home a beacon to my sheep
