Just tell me, how will I explain this to her?
She knows me too well now
I can't get anything past her

Just shoot me, I don't deserve her favors
Tears well up in my eyes
I can't get her anything

I can't believe my eyes
Her anger's a disguise
She needs me to adore her
I've always just ignored her

Alright now, doing meth on the weekends
Smiling til my jaw's so tight
I finally gave her everything

Look my way
We're down here minding the scales
So much peace of mind
Including, but not only my friends
Kick, kick, kick the habit
