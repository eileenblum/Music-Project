Well I found out I'm a sinner
But I can't help myself
So just kick me out, I'm a cancer
For want of drugs I'm alive

So come on, try it, it's so good
It won't hurt, it's just a gas!
Remember that party, you fucked up
All talk about tits and ass

So far you're still religious
Why won't you come on by?
Cuz you know we're here waiting
Waiting to get you high!
