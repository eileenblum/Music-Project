She told me to wait til tomorrow
But I won't last, the grasses are green
We like it a blotter of paper
See how nice our visions can be?

The tablet communion of strychnine
500 of vitamin C
2 more and I'm really humming
I'm peaking and now I can see

We walked for hours
You got it, your sprain
Ride on your speed, oh
You bought it, your sprain

Drink deep from the wells of confusion
No boundaries of human conceit
That buzzing so distant and quiet
Like waves in the ocean that speak
