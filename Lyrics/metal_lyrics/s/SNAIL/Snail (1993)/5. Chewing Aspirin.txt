Come on, sit down, and let's get loaded!
We're skin-popping in our blistered arms
I call the 8-ball in the corner pocket
Let's make a run for the indoor farm

I've been numb so long
That I forgot my pain
I'm just chasing the old buzz
Drenched in acid rain

Alright we're sailing in the realm of unconscious
With black light shining in my dead man's eyes
The universe open to understanding
A revelation of the fucked up kind

We rode the rail now I'm chewing aspirin
My jaw's so tight I've got the joker's smile
We danced around the room and stabbed with such daring!
With shiny blue steel and sewing-spool eyes
