Under steeples gather winter-wolves
Blaming us for our desire
Edicts from the guilt economy
Domination inside

Relics from a modern fallacy
âOur observations sum lifeâ
Enigmatic existentially
Anthropocentrism specious

[Chorus:]
Mental constructs of oppression
Lies to make your views right
Expose your reason to the first event
Deconstruct and emerge

Toxic cynicism antidote
Faith should not be so blind
But common sense is just an artifact
In Platoâs cave we surmise
