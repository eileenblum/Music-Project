When I canât begin to take in all the din
I covet to propose to solve for where I am
All ultraviolet hues red spectra left above
Impatient to my call, obsessed with down below

Now find the water mass with senses from before
Way back where acid make you look so long ago
Old creatures calling from the depths you canât ignore
Weâll fill our lungs with liquid far beyond the shore

[Chorus:]
All to get away from you
Underwater turning blue
No rewards for wealthy few
Underwater turning blue

Now months and years had passed and surfacing I found
Thereâs still so much to do while Iâm above the ground
Escape and comfort dead, now vehemence is born
Above the water now but yearning for the shore

Come on and join us
