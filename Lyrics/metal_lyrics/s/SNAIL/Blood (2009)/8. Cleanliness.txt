Made the claim
Donât show up
Youâre such a goddamn flake, it sure suits you
You pick the pain
Any color you like
You know it comes around
Iâm glad it comes around

Get highâ¦

Give it up now before it makes you a citizen
I wonât be found when the time comes for payment
Youâre fucking up hard because you donât need a favor
Itâs simple to me to just write you off
Itâs simple to me to just write you off
You never say sorry
