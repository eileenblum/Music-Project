You caught me strung out freakinâ
Please donât run so I can hurt you
My deal went down last Friday
Canât see myself in that mirror

[Chorus:]
And when you call, you think Iâm not here
But I can hear you fine itâs just Iâve lost my skills
So come on call me back, cuz Iâm still listening
And we all need a friendâ¦
Get another friend!
Have another rail!

So by the way, howâre you feeling?
Could you say that youâre involved?
And now youâre fine, trained in sorrow
Place it on your head, join the movement

Why?!
