When you hear the tired spun
Voice of many face
Scared to say goodbye
Pasted by my heart
Skipping many precious
Pain stuck like a bone

So itâs time to say hello
Tests and autumn trials
Somewhere down my line
Line up on the left
Plugged up and denying
Sure do miss you sleep

[Chorus:]
So come on and say
I wonât take your shit
Yeah you can trust me
Cuz I have been there man

While shutting in no stood?
Powder zen is lying
Palms toward the sky
Eyes down to the ground
Slave man bent and willing
Knees on self-imposed

Joker-smile undead
Final unbecoming
Clamp down and close in
Dark messages refrain
Too late for the mend
Sure do miss you sleep
