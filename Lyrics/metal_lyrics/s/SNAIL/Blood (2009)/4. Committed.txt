In the devilâs parlor
I became enraged
Full of sacred powder
Fucked up in my head

[Chorus:]
You canât get to me, Iâm really out there
Structureâs what you need, and I canât deliver
Always seem to blow anything stable
Come on down now, and sit at my table

Permanent committal
Embryonic sleep
Swallowed by The Other
I can finally see
