You can ride a bike for bread
Just donât fall off the earth
Simple times were never there
We all rewrote the book
A candied thought so pinpoint-pure
Only in theory though
I can feel my man is near
Relief is almost here

[Chorus:]
I guess Iâll see you, youâre out for the night
Tomorrow we start taking back our lives
I have to know, are you there?
Until you wake up Iâll just let you smile

Thereâs no need to tap a vein
Unless youâre decadent
Watch the smoke thatâs hanging still
The clouds inside my room
Letâs conjure up some thunderheads
And watch the numbers change
Cuz nothingâs more than I can do
This cityâs precedent
