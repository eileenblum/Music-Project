Forward oppose
Ideal, exemplar
Occur and convocation stir

Obtuse third eye
Do this tomorrow
They would replace him
Stand here forever
A show impossible
This animalâ¦
No more impossible it seems

[Chorus:]
Warm it down
Warm it down
Manifest (real is in the way)

Onus betrays
No change eternal
The weight of gnosis
Dead eyes unblinking
Shards of evasion spray
The others now
In Carbon Chauvinism weepâ¦

Real is in The Way
Real is in the way!
Real is in The Way
