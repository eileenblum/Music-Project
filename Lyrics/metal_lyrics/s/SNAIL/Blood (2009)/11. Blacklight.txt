You could have said goodbye
You should have said goodbye
No more sedation still, I sighâ¦
You sure did get me high

[Chorus:]
Out of the woods, cold, stay a year
Grow yourself out and make a smile
Smoke can take us out of here
So take the herb and fill the pipe

The trees are green again
Changing sky from blue to red
Come sit down and talk with me
Where we can stare for hoursâ¦

[Outro:]
We wonât listen
We only stare
Weâre always high
Couldnât you stay -
In place of leaving?
Turn on a blacklight
