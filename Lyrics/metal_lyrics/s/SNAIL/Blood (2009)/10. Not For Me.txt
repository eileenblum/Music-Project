Iâve seen friends lose their lives
over one pair of eyes
And Iâve seen a friend lose his mind
And leave it on a mirror.

Thatâs not for me

I stand on the ground
Unable to reach you
Straight to the bottom
I wonât go to meet you
Like a ramp going up
And you keep slippinâ down
Like a ride at the circus
That you keep ridinâ âround

Thatâs not for me.
