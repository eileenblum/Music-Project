You crowd around me
You crowd around my head
See what you've made me?
I made my Self instead

Some cats they know me
6 sleeping in my bed
They're purring louder
Whispering in my head

I'm speaking to my sheep
I'm coming down

Speak loudly someone
Speak loudly from the soul
Cry out my freedoms
Til we bring it home

Speak to me, the channels are open
