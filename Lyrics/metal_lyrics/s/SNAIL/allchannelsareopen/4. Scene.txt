Mary's in the house, look what she's cooking
She bought herself a gram of cocaine
Well she don't know, but I've been watching
She lit the torch, and there she goes again

While we're all loaded on the back porch
Been sipping bourbon all day
Can't get this bitch to stop her talking
She's done a track of rails and now I say:

Scene from my kind of browsers
The sun peaking in the sky
High, like I was intended
You know, you know I like to stare awhile

You know what I'm living is the good life
I've done it all, I do it still
Cuz I won't last through tomorrow
My body was made for me to kill
