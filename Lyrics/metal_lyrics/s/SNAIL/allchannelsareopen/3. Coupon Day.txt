Give away, you give away
You stopped by
Last weekend
You've been slamming crank
You tried to scam my bag
What you gave
Was no quarter
I don't want to share
I don't like to share

I've never seen anybody like you
I want to laugh at you shaking so hard
Do you feel those bugs in your arms?
They keep marching under your skin

Get away
You gave me
Your friend's number
He'd better watch his ass,
Cuz you tried to scam my bag
And now you're almost over
Feel it in your veins
Your heart's giving out
