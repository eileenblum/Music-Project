In the pile
In the pile, robes and knees
Into that precious trance
The trance religion
In the sister
In the sister, feels so deep
So deep you can't compare
The elevation
Endless pumping
Pagan fucking
Some come to worshipâ¦you

Hang around

Could you let me down?
Could you go away?
Seems to always happen
Searing eyes and fame

For awhile
For some money, buy my speed
And tourniquet my arm
It's drawn to touch you
It's unreal
Once surreal and graying fast
So fast you can't compare
The elevation
It's religion
It's communion
So come on dose it, dose with me
