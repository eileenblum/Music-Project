Hey yeah!
I need to find her
She's got black eyes, she's got black skin
I look outside my city window
I need some green, I need the rain

When I get close I always fall over the edge
My fears are open so the whole world will believe

I took a trip with Lucy
She showed me things I'd never seen
She drove into the grasslands
The grasslands are the place I'd rather be

When I get close I always run over the edge
Now Lucy tells me things that I will tell to you:
We have just one chance more, cuz Lucy told me so
