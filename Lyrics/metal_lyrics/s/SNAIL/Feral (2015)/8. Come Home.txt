Bitter and isolated 
the long, dry tree 
Nobody passes 
the straw man pleads 

Smitten you stare at the moon, she's grace 
Oceans obey her appeal, levitate 

So come home girl I need you 
you calm the voice in my head 
Saturday's near me and Sunday we're hiding in bed 

Her shadow hides in phases 
Her mirror shines me 
Magnetic seeing 
With vision she cleaves 

Sinking you're calling her 
Union drifts farther away 
Eyes terror-fixated 
smiling with irony's dread 
Patient, she's pulling now 
using your forces combined 
Parallel hemispheres dancing 
we're no longer blind 

So see 
See that we are One
