Down in a hole 
no way to speak â no hope 
untie this venom 
in loss â in lack 

Pictures of Home 
you thought you'd thrown away 
now see them hanging 
you put them there 

You see It starting to unveil 
Release and stillness will prevail 
Like silence rendered by the snow 
Evaporate, renounce, un-know 

Faraway shore 
You never left so you 
can never go back 
So say goodbye 

Awareness restored 
The hologram confess 
how it is written 
at One, at Rest 

Freedom in being 
A fractal's grace is more 
than the external 
Guilt falls away 

Lunar extinction 
Forsaking birth and death 
Vibrating Prana 
you burn in bliss 

You see It starting to unveil 
Release and stillness will prevail 
Like silence rendered by the snow 
Evaporate, renounce, un-know 
In dreamless sleep awaken Now 
in Now abide, embody Light 
the Light vibrates its Unity 
now Unified, no you or me
