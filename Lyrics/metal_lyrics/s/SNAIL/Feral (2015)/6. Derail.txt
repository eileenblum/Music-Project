The path is long and involved 
that's why there is no escaping 
Attached to the rail 
that twists and sails 
past all but the very last station 

Derail that train 
into the pain 
Derail that train 

The cage of your own design 
has taken a life of its own 
Grinding your keys 
the ringmaster sees 
the seeker is deep in the hollow
