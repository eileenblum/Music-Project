I met a mystic 
on down the road 
He told me something 
I'd always known 
I recognized him 
and he was me 
He spoke in circles 
of DMT 

I can't say what he told me 
language fails to clarify 
let's just say he saw right through me 
prophesied that I would die 

Won't you fade out, come and smoke the deathless? 
white vapor floating away 
as you watch your world dissolving 
who is left to be afraid? 

He said to meet him 
beside the sea 
The water healing 
from which we came 
Toward the mountain 
take highway one 
Back to the garden 
we'll smoke as One 

Something tells me when I go there 
I won't see your face the same 
Why not trace the route that's taken 
so we can find Us once again
