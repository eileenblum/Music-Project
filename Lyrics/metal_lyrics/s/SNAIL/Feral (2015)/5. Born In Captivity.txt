I want to build a mirror 
I need to feel the other 
If I don't seem alone 
you might see that I'm a faker 

Constant-thought catastrophe 
all to feed the little me 
cutting down the elder trees 
all to extinguish their thought-bubbles 

Superseded, overthrown 
beast is showing great renown 
all you see is what he's shown 
all the warrior sees is adversaries 

Mother Gaia testifies 
burn the veil that covers eyes 
see the inner paradise 
be your Unified true nature 

Why would illumined wells run dry? 
Pain in separation 
How will she gouge our plastic eyes? 
She embodies Union 
What gnosis borne from great abyss? 
Fear creates the dark outside 
What knowledge calls the lighted mist? 
Dark that opens third eye 

You strive for the false 
implanted occult 
no meaning, no meaning 
Conform to the world 
close all channels in 
no meaning, no meaning 
More symbols arise 
let drowning reprise 
no meaning, defeated
