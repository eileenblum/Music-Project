I can see your million forms 
All your colors, shape inform me 
Stolen from our forest home 
Vedic hymns induce recursion 

Glass onion, peel away 
illusion veil, reveal The Way 
the holy fractal is enduring 
The tessellated sea 
it burns without, yet it is me 
I cease in psychedelic fullness 

Sparks from charcoal indicate 
Flavored smoke unravel skyward 
Psilocybe perforate 
Sacrament of cosmic scholar 

As the celebration endures its own narcissism 
as dry, cracked hands clap-slap with blood 
as we all open our arms to devour each other 
a lamb begins to roar 

See the fractal permeate 
Vishnu breathes the mystic lotus 
Maya burn and transmutate 
Godflesh, soma, utter Prana
