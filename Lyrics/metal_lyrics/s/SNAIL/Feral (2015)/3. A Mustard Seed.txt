I found substance that keeps me alive 
watching my airplane fall from the sky 
Too much focus on being alive 
melting my ice cube, let's go for a ride 

Cancel your research, delve into black 
Chaos is funny and warm and reveals 
the paradigm false and pillz are on sale 
Shatter your filters, embrace the "unreal" 

You go and I'll stay and pray 
The cold grip, slow drip, now slip 
I keep calling but the phone is crushed, your ears sewn shut 
So come on deprivate, meditate and listen
