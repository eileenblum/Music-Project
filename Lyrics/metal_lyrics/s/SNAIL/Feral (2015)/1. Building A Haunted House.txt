You are the source of all 
the shaman of my pain 
You are the murderer 
stole my precious gifts 
Your coward army stands 
something like an oak 
They're just some crazy words 
I'm compelled to say 

Your symbols decorate the halls 
Above-ground coffins, grave remorse 

You set events in ways 
to guarantee my death 
You took to wringing out 
the joy from every day 
From shadow you emerge 
the quadrupedal twin 
In terror we embraced 
I screamed 'til I awoke 

Your symbols decorate the halls 
Above-ground coffins, grave remorse 
With eyes so dry from shallow blinking 
And breath the faithful sound of ticking...
