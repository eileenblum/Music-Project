Wait until all is frost
And you count a cruel letter
Trying to define, unhappen
So gone away
Shotgun gave his report:
No more hope or noon pheasants
Driving with eyeballs inverted
Free mind drain

Won't somebody please help me with my head?
'Cuz I see movement in the corner of my eye
I got that feelin' the bugs are watching me
Sometimes I wonder if the bugs are really there

Pillz untillz we are fillz
Now cry "why?!" and rue heaven
Counting your fate on one finger
Grow hate feel
Wait until all is frost
And you count a cruel letter
Trying to define, unhappen
So gone away

"Let me ask you something: why are you alive? It's circular. What's the point?"
So many patterns steal the day
Race from the phantoms, we build away
It's your ritual.

Pillz untillz we are fillz
Now cry "why?!" and rue heaven
Counting your fate on one finger
Grow hate feel
Wait until all is frost
And you count a cruel letter
Trying to define, unhappen
So gone away
