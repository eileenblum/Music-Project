Galaxy will you wake up from sorrow?
Quarks weeping from the heart of a proton
Cold tears in the endless expansion
Small voices in the heliosphere

Hope sustained in the power of weakness
I heard a voice and it sounded familiar
So pure, unlike conscious projections
Light raining from a proto-star seed

How can you sleep so good...
hosting your incubi?
End your solar eclipse of The Sun
to flee the waking dream

Once you're here take account of devotion
Though weary we can carry another
Hold tight and we'll make it together
Filters lost in the faith of a dream...
