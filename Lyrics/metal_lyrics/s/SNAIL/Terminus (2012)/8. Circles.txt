I am circling
I am so clean
Breathe my offspring
Feel my energy
The ground is breathing
Or is it seething?
Screaming, dreaming
Be reborn and die

Rise to the Sun
All must be One
Reach up and grow
Is all that we know
Burning the seed
We will be free
Fall to the ground
Wake up another line drawn
