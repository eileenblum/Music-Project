The crest of meaning, ancient cryptic prose
the holy impetus of fire
Recite the alchemy unto my host
Somatic, corporeal abandon

Vapor and heresy, a minionâs role
letâs transmit memes that unseat power
Cultural infecting through perception
we wield the Oracle Eternus

Call oneself
Answer sound
Cultural
Recursion

Now take your precious herbs and recurse smoke
your meditations are provided
reflections on the text that we all grow
reverberate ideas inspired
