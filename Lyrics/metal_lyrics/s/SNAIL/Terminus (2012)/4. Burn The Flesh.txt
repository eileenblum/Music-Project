The lake of fire is calling
Itâs time to take a dive
my belt of lead is pulling me down
I see ahead with X-ray eyes
The wall of Pink is falling
Exit the diving bell
Be one with god and let go of the id
Expand through time remember all

I see The End
Itâs too late to pretend
Itâs time to burn the flesh
the delicate flesh
Itâs time to let the soul be free

My lungs keep me from breathing
my heart is pumping black
life-scarred hands grip a crying man
His pain is more than I can stand

I see The Sea
the waves wash over me
itâs time to burn the boat
that keeps me afloat
the mind will set the body free

And in the End
itâs too late to pretend
the flesh is gone
the soul is free
and all that is left is me
