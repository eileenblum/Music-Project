When he was spoken he was born out of place
Prosperity gospel: money, not faith
Crippled by wanting, building away
Frantically mortal, his symbol betrays

CUT THAT FUCKER OFF!

When it's offered don't throw it away
If you can't take it others await
Lips turning blue...that's a sure sign
It's time for reflection on hippy crack time
