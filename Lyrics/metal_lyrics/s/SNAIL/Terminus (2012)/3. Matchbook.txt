Instant before impact
Spread beyond borders built to restrain intrepid bones
(Killers, Preachers, dressed and displayed)
Different, same so it seems
Pile the new dead on the backs of old debts, deliver me
(staring, biting, breaking the bend)
Throw down frivolous stones
Carry on sculpting charicatures called broken homes
(terror, fairer, brighter than blood)
Feasting, drinking it in
Hoard to yourselves all the virtue that's left, our Father's sins
(hanged man, shamed man, where to begin)

Blue skies and Enquirer ecstasies, sack cloth and the ash of despair
War eyes show your mongering leprosy, black ties and the end of affairs
Blood lines every bit the conquistador, drill through 'til the fountain is bled
Matchbook at the scene of the incident, closed cover caught the sleeper dead

Reaching short of the stars
Call to the dark, cry the freezing beyond please find me home
(naked, shaken, haunting the halls)
Flailing, wallowing fears
Bred in the womb into final awareness, sold the moon
(swap meat, twisted, hell of a name)
