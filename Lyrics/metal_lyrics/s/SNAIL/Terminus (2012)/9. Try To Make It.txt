Go ahead call me bastard
It goes away
Somewhere it started to matter
Up in my head
That thing in the back room growing
It's almost there
So bring me a check and I'll sign it
It's so late

Just try to make it (it's so easy to say)

Everyday for a few years
Just to escape
Down in a hole for 3 days
And I gotta scrape
How can I try to control it...
So pure and faint?
So bottle it up and protect it
A craft to elate
