She built her Self upon
ways she was told
one must expand, one must inflate
The Creature character
Face in a frame
image and body trading place
Thus began striving
faith in the way
she wonât accede, she will not end
Forever bound
slave in her cage
She fears the world, she fears changeâ¦

You will end, you will die and there's no way out.
Accept it, and die to Self to flee mortality

"Ok, it's time to wake up now!"
