It's a quick chase, I take them down at night
I drag'em in, gently to their skin
I put them on display in my gallery of humans
It take sometime to fill, but it's worth the try

Killed, stuffed, hung on the wall
Their bodies are my trophies
Killed stuffed, hung on the wall
I need them more and more

They are all gone, no more to find
On the wall I can find them all, my friends, my folks
There is only one more thing I can put up on the wall
And that is me, I need to join the rest on my wall
