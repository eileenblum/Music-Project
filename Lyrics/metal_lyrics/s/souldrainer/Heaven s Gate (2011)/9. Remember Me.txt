I am not there, I do not sleep
You stand at my grave and weep
Why cry for a soul set free
You won't be alone, and you will know 
I am the wind that through your mind will blow
But life goes on and on again

Weep, I have finished my final chapter
The stars are set, I'm ready to go
Remember me and I will live forever
And you alone, will have the key to me endeavors

I will live in your mind
for as long as you remember me
Please keep me in your mind
This is a journey that we all must take
Remember me when you're awake
Dream of me but I won't come back

I never said bye
I was with you for just a little while
I never knew it was time for me
Don't waste your time at my grave and cry
I am no there, I didn't die
Think of me and you'll keep me alive

Weep, I have finished my final chapter
The stars are set, I'm ready to go
Remember me and I will live forever
And you alone, will have the key to me endeavors

Close your eyes and remember me
take my hand and again we are we
