The caravans are marching straight ahead
Led by what they think is their gods will

God, war, fighting for your sick belief
Hate, kill, dying for your sick belief
When the war comes

They read a book, and they got themselves a leader
To fight and kill their friends who will not be there

When they die, they hope for an afterlife
Mistakenly, their god is just another fiction story

God, war, fighting for your false belief
Hate, kill, dying for your false belief
When the war comes
