[Music &amp; Lyrics: Edvardsson]

They came from outer space centuries ago
to save the human race. They called themselves Ti and Do
The journey began in the nineteen seventies
To reach another level of existence above human

They had to leave the earth. It was time to go
Renewal and recycling of the globe
Their human bodies were their vessels which they later on
left to help them on the journey into the unknown

Thirty people take their lives to follow Marshall to his grave
Suicide solution to it all is the end
Smothered, laying on the bed, poisoned to their deaths
Bodies covered up in cheats getting colder every day

1997 a gloomy day in March
Marshall and his friends decided it was time
to follow the shuttle hiding in the light
and they would now advance to the next level in revolution

Ti was gone since years ago even though they claimed
to need their bodies to move on into the Heaven's Gate
She died from human cancer to which she couldn't get
and still they thought Marshall was right and marched with him to death

Thirty people take their lives to follow Marshall to his grave
Suicide solution to it all is the end
Smothered, laying on the bed, poisoned to their deaths
Bodies covered up in cheats getting colder every day
