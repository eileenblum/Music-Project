Power engulfs me, I live from their fear
When I start to mutilate their small tiny bodies
Their eyes are plucked, I break their bones

Fear, I keep them tied down to the floor
RTo prevent them from running away
I can see their fear in their big black eyes
when I take up the knife

I can't see where they land, I wanna know
I can't wait to dissect their bodies
Take them home to my cold dark cellar
Cut'em up to see what's inside

I can't believe my eyes, I'm tied down to the floor
They are standing around me and are ready to cut

I'm not ready to die
I will put up with a fight until my light is out
They peel my skin off
They put it in my mouth and let me choke until i die

I can't see where they land, I wanna know
I can't wait to dissect their bodies
Take them home to my cold dark cellar
Cut'em to see what's inside

Shining and sharp, they sharp the incision
With tools from my shed they work with precision
My body can't take so much more

They cut my legs off arms off, I'm just a torso
I can see their bloodlust in their big black eyes
when they take up the knife
