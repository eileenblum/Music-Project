I'm born and raised into the god delusion
From mouth to mouth garbage spreads like a virus

One believer is a poet, a group is a cult
Nevertheless the god delusion
The great illusion

We pray like never before to the same old whore
We hold hands and commit genocide

History gets rewritten by hands of priests
To serve the very own human sick sick need

Thousands of believers will form their own world insane
The god delusion
