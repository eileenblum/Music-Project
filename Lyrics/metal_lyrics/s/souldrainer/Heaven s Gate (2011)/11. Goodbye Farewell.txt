Left alone on the dirt floor
Tied up with chains from my neck down to my feet
I'm trying to get loose but you make me weak 
The lack of strength will be my defeat

Goodbye farewell, I never planned this to be your final day
but this will be your way
No need to say goodbye because now it's too late

Snap snap! One by one you break the bones
I can hear my fingers crack
I won't give in because I've got you a surprise
I'll just wait until to look away

Goodbye farewell, I never planned this to be your final day
but this will be your way
No need to say goodbye because now it's too late

I close my eyes and I take a nice blow to your head
Levels are up and I can feel the strength building up inside.
I'm getting stronger as your body becomes mine

Goodbye farewell, I never planned this to be your final day
but this will be your way
No need to say goodbye because now it's too late
