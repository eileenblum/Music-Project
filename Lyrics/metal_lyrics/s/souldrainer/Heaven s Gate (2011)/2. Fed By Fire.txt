Fire, gasoline and a box of matches
I'm in the game
This is pleasure, this is my ecstasy
Reaching my goal, this is the key

I seek my own desire
The pleasure in fire
The power of the obsession is great

Got tired torturing my mother's parakeet and became a prolific pyromaniac

Fed by fire
I love the torch red

Spent many nights marinating in urine soaked sheets
Oh, what ecstasy setting fires brings to my body
What power I feel at the thought of fire
What pleasure, heavenly god divine fire

Fed by fire
I love the torch red

Destruction, feeds the need of destroying humans
Pushed over the edge
It keeps me going, it feeds my glowing need
Feeding the fire with gasoline

Fed by fire
I love the torch red
