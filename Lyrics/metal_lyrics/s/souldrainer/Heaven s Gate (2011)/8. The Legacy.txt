An old man has been sitting with information
since the abduction.
Close encounter by the fourth kind
By extraterrestrials, when He was young
They drained his soul, they drained his mind,
they gave him what he knows

When I die, no one will know what I know
They gave it to me, The Legacy

It was this man, he knew it all
Some say he's alive
They gave him something in the sky
They gave him The Legacy

When I die, no one will know what I know
They gave it to me, The Legacy

He got detailed instructions how they will
invade the earth, enslave the human race
They promised him
they are gonna come back one day
To erase the human race and humankind

When I die, no one will know what I know
They gave it to me, The Legacy

It all started when I was a child
I remember it as if it happened today
As they drained my mind I got the knowledge
They gave me something about
the end of the human race

When I die, no one will know what I know
