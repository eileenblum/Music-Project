You're marching into the end
Following the path of your god
You will not fear

With your head held high
For the lie you're ready to die
You'll kill them all

You fight and kill, you fight and die
You fight and kill and die for your will

Making enemies of friends
Anyone becomes your foe
Now they will die

Ancient writings have become your law
Made up story one big flaw
The book is a lie

You fight and kill, you fight and die
You fight and kill and die for your will
