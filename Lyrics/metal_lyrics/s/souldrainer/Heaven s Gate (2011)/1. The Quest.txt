Barren realms fed upon 'til the last drop
Draining the life from every biological entity

Searching through the void, the emptiness is vast
Every sign of life - I'm programmed to kill

I'm traveling through and beyond the stars
to find a new world - to start a new war
I'm above everything you know
There's no way you can stop me

I'm traveling through and beyond the stars
to find a new world - to start a new war
I'm above everything you know
There's no way to control me

Feeding upon the weak, my craving for life
The seeds are planted
They start to grow and slowly you will fade away
