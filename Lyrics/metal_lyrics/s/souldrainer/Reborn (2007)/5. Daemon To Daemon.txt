Like a knife...I cut through you...!
...With open eyes! I behold...the...light!!!

I feel whole...and complete.
This dreamâs like...true!!!

As your soul drifts away, I feel pain.
I fuck my sins! I await my death!!!
The clouds uncovered the moon, it danced over the trees.
As I, covered in blood, I prayed to my god!!!

Daemon To Daemon!!!

I feast on your guts you fucking...whore!

Like a knife...I slit your veins!
With well-shut eyes...I behold...the...dark!!!

I enter Thee...
