At my daily visit to the graveyard,
Visiting my loved oneâs grave...
Someone was watching me...
As I...put the flowers next to the stone.
She approached and said it was time!
She appeared to be and angel, here only for me...

I never thought that I would die without saying goodbye.
I never thought that I would leave everything behind.
I never thought it would be now, I just want to stay.
I never thought it would be in such a painful way.

I ran away, I tried to forget what IÂ´ve been told (told...).
I could not accept, I never thought of it like this.
What? Is this how itÂ´s like?!

It didnÂ´t matter how fast I ran,
She was always there, waiting for me!
She took up the knife and started to cut me everywhere!!!

Her eyes were black, full of hate and I was really scared!
She took up the knife and started to cut me everywhere!!!
