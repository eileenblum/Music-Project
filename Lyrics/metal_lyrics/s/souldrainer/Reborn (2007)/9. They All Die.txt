[Lyrics: Johan Klitkou, Marcus Edvardsson, Music: Daniel Dlimi, Marcus Edvardsson.]

(Take my life and spare the ones
That live in fear and yet are numb...)
(Take my life and spare the ones
That live in fear and yet are numb...)
(Take my life and spare the ones
That live in fear and yet are numbâ¦)
YET ARE NUMB!!!

I fear for what they are.
I'm afraid for what I saw.
The pain in me...
Keeps building up inside.

Pain and misery, I don't know.
Is it all worth it in the end?!

[Solo Edvardsson]

[Chorus:]
They All Die - When the armies arrive at dawn.
They All Die - They creep up inside and eat their way out.
Kill me now - Please don't let them get to me.

The pain unleashed...
Spreads darkness across the sky.
The pain unleashed...
Brings forth the worst in man.
The pain unleashed...
Causes humans to fight within.
Oh, please, don't let them get to me...

Take my life and spare the ones
That live in fear and yet are numb.
Use me as I was your own,
And cast some light upon their homes.
Break my bones and use my soul,
Just leave them be, please, set them free.
Light the torch and spread the word,
That my prayer has been heard.

[Chorus:]
They All Die - When the armies arrive at dawn.
They All Die - They creep up inside and eat their way out.
They All Die - Please don't let them get to me.
Kill me now!
