My eyes are turned inwards, I bend my spinal cord like countless times before.
I am Reborn.
My body aches as I fall down to the ground.
IÂ´ve rejoined with the pain.

[Chorus:]
All these emotions! Silent moments,
Feel like thousand razor blades...dancing on my skin!
I am but one man, insignificant as one can be.
I am...Reborn!!!

I flee, I hide...behind masks I control...what you see when you look at me.

I am not the...one that I was the day before.
I am not the one I used to be.
I used to be free. I used to be me,
IÂ´ve lost a piece of me to the dark.

[Chorus:]
All these emotions! Silent moments,
Feel like thousand razor blades...dancing on my skin!
I am but one man, insignificant as one can be Reborn!!!

[Chorus:]
All these emotions! Silent moments,
Feel like thousand razor blades...dancing on my skin!
I am but one man, insignificant as one can be...Reborn!!!

The vicious parts of me...need to be silenced,
So I bathe in pain...once again.
ItÂ´s conducted of free will. The price I pay is none,
Compared to the reward.
ItÂ´s way too much to take, so every now and then,
I slightly open the door of madness.
And air...some of the pain, crucial, itÂ´s the one
Thing that keeps me from going in...sane.

[Chorus:]
All these emotions! Silent moments,
Feel like thousand razor blades...dancing on my skin!
I am but one man, insignificant as one can be...Re...born!!!

[Chorus:]
All these emotions! Silent moments,
Feel like thousand razor blades...dancing on my skin!
I am but one man, insignificant as one can be... I am Reborn!!!

I am but one man...REBORN!!!
...REBORN!!!
