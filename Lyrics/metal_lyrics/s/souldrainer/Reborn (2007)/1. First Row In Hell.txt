Today was the very first day,
I felt alone...I felt it slipping away.
Today was the very first time.
I toyed with the idea of throwing all away.
Today I felt a scorching flame,
Kneel down and obey the misery!
My ego was thrown in my face.
This is the First Row In Hell!!!

[Chorus:]
I cannot feel, nor see the pain
Why canÂ´t it stop? WhatÂ´s going on?
Today I was told that I was weak.
My only goal...was to stay far away from pain.
Why canÂ´t it stop? WhatÂ´s going on?
All...is...lost...now!!!

Today was the very first day,
I felt alone...I felt it slipping away.
Today was the very first time.
I toyed with the idea of throwing all away.
Today I felt a scorching flame,
Kneel down and obey the misery!

This is the First Row In Hell!!!

[Chorus:]
I cannot feel, nor see the pain
Why canÂ´t it stop? WhatÂ´s going on?
Today I was told that I was weak.
My only goal...was to stay far away from pain.
Why canÂ´t it stop? WhatÂ´s going on?
All...is...lost...now!!!
