[Lyrics: Johan Klitkou, Marcus Edvardsson, Music: Daniel Dlimi, Marcus Edvardsson.]

Tonight, I walk the same ground.
The shadows have left me,
The worries are left alone.
Tonight I will not look back.
âCause this time I will beâ¦finally free!!!

If...there...was a god.
He would have been me.
This is my...Black Thirteen!
Hold the world in my hands.
Mold it like clay.
Untouchable, unstoppable, no remorse.
Only me.

Come on, take my hand, let me drain your body.
You signed on the dotted line with your blood.
I've kept my promises. Now it's time.

Come on walk with me and spin the wheel of fortune.
You can use the time to say goodbye,
You've seen yourself through my eyes.

[Chorus:]
Rolling the dice!
(I roll the dice...)
Be my Black...(Thirteen...)!
I roll the dice, play with life, one more time.
Be my Black...(Thirteen...)!
Time stopped, my blood froze to ice.
Be my Black...(Thirteen...)!
I took...the vacant place and I shall rest...with...num...ber thirteen.

(Come on, take my hand, let me drain your body.
You signed on the dotted line with your blood.
I've kept my promises. Now it's time.)

Come on, take my hand, let me drain your body.
You signed on the dotted line with your blood.
I've kept my promises. Now it's time.

Come on walk with me and spin the wheel of fortune.
You can use the time to say goodbye,
You've seen yourself through my eyes.

[Chorus:]
Rolling the dice!
(I roll the dice...)
Be my Black...(Thirteen...)!
I roll the dice, play with life, one more time.
Be my Black...(Thirteen...)!
Time stopped, my blood froze to ice.
Be my Black...(Thirteen...)!
I took...the vacant place and I shall rest...with...num...ber thirteen!!!
