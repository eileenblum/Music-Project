A quest for you and I,
Where we can see the land.
This dream for me is closer to reality (realityâ¦).
We keep in mind it's safe for us to hold our hands.
As we begin our journey,
To the Promised...Land.

When this quest has ended we will find the truth.
There will no place just as our dream-like paradise.
Now we just went out but there's no turning back (thereâs no turning back...).
As we are stuck here, in our Promised Land.

We are traveling through a peaceful and calm place.
Something tells me we are wrong, why are we here?
Now we just went out but the light...turned to black,
As we are stuck here...in our Promised Land.

There...will be...no place...just as...real pain.
