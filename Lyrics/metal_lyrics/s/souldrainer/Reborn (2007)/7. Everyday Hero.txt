There is darkness...all around.
I donÂ´t like what IÂ´m turning into, slave obey.
There is pain...inside.
I donât like what it makes me do, slave obey.

[Chorus:]
An impulse travels from my brain to my hand,
A moment of hell!
Not mine...not mine, but yours!!!
I will not bleed nor die, âcause I...am...alive!!!

ALIVE!!!
ALIVE!!!
ALIVE!!!

I cannot see what IÂ´ve done to you.
But IÂ´m ashamed of things I wish upon you.
I wonÂ´t...disregard...my lust for your blood.
I canât... I will not kill myself. I do not like your pain... pain!!!

[?]

[Chorus:]
An impulse travels from my brain to my hand,
Moment of hell!
Not mine...not mine, but yours!!!
I will not bleed nor die, âcause I...am...alive!!!

ALIVE!!!
ALIVE!!!
ALIVE!!!

Noâ¦ my hands are redâ¦ my mind is blankâ¦
Your empty eyes stair at meâ¦ in an awful accusing way...
Stop, please stop! You saw it coming. I told you!
I fucking told you!!! There was only one way out!!!

I see the past...itÂ´s all dark,
With a clear trail of blood through time, slay again.
I know the future...of mine,
I just canÂ´t shake the urge to kill, so slay again!
