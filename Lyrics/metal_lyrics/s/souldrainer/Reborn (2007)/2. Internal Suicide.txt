I smile and nod my head,
I appear to be a decent man.
I move through these different worlds.
I pretend to take interest in what you say.
Why canÂ´t you just vanish or die...at my...command?

[Chorus:]
I wish I was given a quota...a quota of kills.
Internal...Internal...Suicide!!!

IÂ´m the inner sanity, the ab-in-normal.
IÂ´ve come to terms with the fact that I am...
...merely a drop in the dark wide ocean.
Insignificant but the ripples I leave are eternal (are eternal...)

[Chorus:]
I wish I was given a quota...a quota of kills.
Internal...Internal...Suicide!!!

Every day I wear the face you want me to.
I must cage my despise buried deep inside me.
Every day I fight to survive yet another day,
There is no such thing as...compromising.

[Chorus:]
I wish I was given a quota...a quota of kills.
Internal...Internal...Suicide!!!
