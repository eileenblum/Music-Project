[Lyrics: Johan Klitkou, Marcus Edvardsson, Music: Marcus Edvardsson.]

In my mind, can't control these feelings.
You are no exception - I'm for killing you.
Like a pawn, I'm being moved to my destruction.
Nothing can stop me...

I've got the rifle pointing to your forehead and Iâm...
...pulling the trigger!
All the panic in your eyes are ignored by my mind.
I can't understand what I have done.

[Chorus:]
Weep again.
I promised you, meet with the visitors.
I'll take you to The Others.
The Others will come.
The Others will come!!!

The demons - The Others.
They are your...your masters.
You're enslaved with...with The Others.
You're bound to...to the hatred!!!

You're cold, you find it hard to breathe.
Your pulse is getting weaker for each and every second.
You feel insecure and afraid to die.
Die now...

In my mind, I can't control my these feelings!!!
You are no exception - I'm for killing you.
Like a pawn, I'm being moved to my destruction!!!
Nothing can stop me...

I've got the rifle pointing to your forehead and Iâm...
...pulling the trigger!!!
All the panic in your eyes are ignored by my mind!
I can't understand what I have done!!!

[Chorus:]
Weep again.
I promised you, meet with the visitors.
I'll take you to The Others.
The Others will come!
The Others will come!!!

The demons - The Others.
They are your...your masters.
You're enslaved with...with The Others.
You're bound to...to the hat-red!!!

Read my mind, I can't control these feelings.
You are no exception - I'm for killing you.
Like a pawn, I'm being moved to my destruction.
Nothing can stop me...

I've got the rifle pointing to your forehead and Iâm...
...pulling the trigger.
All the panic in your eyes are ignored by my mind.
I can't understand what I have done...
