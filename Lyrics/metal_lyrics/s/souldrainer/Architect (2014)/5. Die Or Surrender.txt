Far beyond, wherer no one's ever been
Way beyond the darkest thought within
Search in the mind, the labyrinth of sin
Deep within under the soild skin

Die or surrender
Succumb to darkness
Die or surrender
Awaken the road

Consumed by darkness, resurrected from below
Consumed by darkness, where mortal sins will flow

Through the veins, the salty tears
Boiling blood will burn the mind with fear
Ascending to a place much higher
Now it's too late, you will succumb to fire

Die or surrender
Succumb to darkness
Die or surrender
Awaken the road

Consumed by darkness, resurrected from below
Consumed by darkness, where mortal sins will flow
