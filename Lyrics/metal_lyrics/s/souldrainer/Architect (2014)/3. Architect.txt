Hoping for an end waiting for the sun to die
The wish for everything to be gone
Searching for the paradise, desperation floats around
The only way to go is a double-barreled gun

Architect, you are ruining your life
Building your dream - life demise

Nothing inside but darkness, walking hand in hand with death
Dwelling in slumbering state of mind
Eyes are blinded by sight of all the lies
Never feared the dark, embracing every step through the blackened gate

Architect, you are ruining your life
Building your dream - life demise

Unblessed soul cast in blackest soil
The final push from the edge of life
Waiting for the final end to unfold
Salvation is forever gone, this is the end of all times

Architect, you are ruining your life
Building your dream - life demise
