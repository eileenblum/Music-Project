The world is fading
Shadows getting longer
Eyes are watching
You can see something's crawling

Now it opens
Feet on the soil
Jaws of evil
Cry to the moon and moan

Rise against or live in peace
One or the other
No in between
Can not live
For no other
In between

Rise against or live in peace
One or the other
No in between
Can not live
For no other
Those who from the heavens came

Never surrender
Preserve the pride
The dream is real
Stand tall for your beliefs
Fight for freedom
Fight for humanity

Words of wisdom
Something to believe
Is it for a good cause
Or is it all just lies

There will be blood
Anguish and agony
But you will surrender
You will stand free

Never surrender
Keep your hope
The dream is real
Stand tall for your beliefs
Fight for me
Fight for humanity
