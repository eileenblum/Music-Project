Boxed, caged, see-thru walls
Stainless steel, bars, welded thoroughly together
Cold, sterile environment
Let the biological experiments begin

Injecting cells, new growth takes shape
Circulation restrained, the temperature drops
Mutations. Rarely fed, life form begins to fade

Let the biological experiments begin
Let the biological experiments begin

Twisting, turning, improve the joints
Mechanical enhanced, superior race
New life form has been given a face
This is the end of the human race

Engage: Mission destroy
Force fed, instructions
Expendable, cheap, sophisticated
Culling the weak, become the hated

Let the biological experiments begin
Let the biological experiments begin

Obsolete, left for dead taken down, turned off
Reborn again in a new form
Boxed, caged, here we go again
Let the biological experiments begin

Boxed, caged, see-thru walls
Stainless steel, bars, welded thoroughly together
Cold, sterile environment
Chained to the wall, this is the final call

Let the biological experiments begin
Let the biological experiments begin
