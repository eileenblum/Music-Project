As I open my eyes
I see them standing there
Is this a dream, am I dying?
They've taken me away
I cannot breathe
I'm still awake but I cannot feel

They are coming for me at night
I'm not sure if I'm dreaming
I want to wake up
Because it hurts too much

Floating above the bed
Slowly rotating
I'm open, they are inside
Probes inserted, alin fluid injections
It burns, my veins are expanding
I'm about to burst

They are coming for me at night
I'm not sure if I'm dreaming
I want to wake up
Because it hurts too much

Fuck!
I rip their veins
Spine pulled out through their back
I'm exploding with hate
Cracked skulls, separated limbs
I'm strong, I'm the beast they cannot contain

Awaken, looking at my scars
They hurt and I shiver from cold
Something was taken from me
I can feel it's missing inside
It burns

They are coming for me at night
I'm not sure if I'm dreaming
I want to wake up
Because it hurts too much
