You call yourself a human
When there is no humanity
You pray about your life

You just turn your back
Beaten, blue and sore
The world is turning black

Ripping, body shreds apart
Twisting, pain inside the heart
You don't care you won't be near
Suck it out without a thought of share
Suck it out with selfishness

I can remember you
I know who you are
I've seen you before
You took my soul apart
I remember you
I don't care

When you're alone
I won't be there for you
No one will ease your pain
You'll be screaming loud of agony
I'm waiting for your death
