I'm not afarid to walk down the green mile
And all the sins I've made, I know they are all mine
I don'r regret the harm that I have done
Of the pain I caused, nothing can be made undone

The release of me
Put me out of my misery

Flick the power switch on
Watching the body freeze up
Electrical current running through the bones
Contorted limbs twitching uncontrolled
The reek of burning flesh

The steps are slow down the corridors
Anxiety, the loneliness is strong
My body becomes my temple
That temple will burn
Where justice is being done

The release of me
Put me out of my misery
I burn and justice is being served
