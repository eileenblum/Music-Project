Darkness confined
Blackest thoughts projected
Across subconscious mind
The weak cannot be protected
Become the truth, put the mask behind

Open your mind, bring the world to light
Behold yourself with different eyes
Grasp the truth, put yourself aside
The uncontrolled becomes the state of mind

Behind the mask
Show the face
Become the truth
No one can trace
Behind the face

Deeds in veil
In shadows your face remain unknown
Come forth, reveal yourself
To the naked eye - untouched by the judging eyes

Another world far beyond the truth
Lies the shadow or yours awaiting
The presence of self is unknown
Until your conscious mind awakens
