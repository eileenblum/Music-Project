Human ashes and body parts
Walking through the remains
Broken bones and piles of corpses
The feces and the stench
The sun is frying bodies
Stripping bones free from flesh
Violence, foul display
Separated human limbs

I am the one
Conqueror of the earth
You all will die
Death, bringer of the hate

Some buried alive screaming until their end
No one can hear their cry for help
Until they die they will suffocate
No one cares, they were killed with pure hate

I am the one
Conqueror of the earth
You all will die
Death, bringer of the hate

Desecrated molested sacrilege with sin
Angel of death hollow absent of soul
Superior to mankind, spreading their hate
Weapons of anger, fire them through the burning gate

I am the one
Conqueror of the earth
You all will die
Death, bringer of the hate
