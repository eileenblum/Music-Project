The hour has past and it's time for me to fall asleep.
I can feel the shadows coming closer.
Afraid of the dark, I do not dear to fall asleep again.
Afraid of the shadows as they are coming closer.

As I pass away I feel nothing but pain and the itching feeling as it peels my skin.
The pain withing me is soon to be released.
God I don't know what has happened to me.

Oh God, slowly I die and I fade away for an eternity.
I can feel the evil coming closer.
Not afraid of the dead, now I know I dear to slowly fade away in a dream.

Finally I'm dead, I've lost control over my soul.
I can see my body beneath, under me.
This will last forever, an eternity, to fade away like an angel so free.
