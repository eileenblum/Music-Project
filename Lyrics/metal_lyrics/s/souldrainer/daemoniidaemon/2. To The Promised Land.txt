A quest for you and I where we can see the land.
This dream for me is closer to reality.
We keep in mind it's safe for us to old our hands.
As we begin our journey to the promised land.

When this quest has end we will find the truth.
There will no place just as our dream-like paradise.
Now we just want out but there's no turning back.
As we are stuck here in our promised land.

We are traveling through a peaceful and calm place.
Something tells me we are wrong, why are we here?
Now we just want out but the light has turned to black,
and we are stuck here in our promised land.

There will be no place just as our dream, just pain.
