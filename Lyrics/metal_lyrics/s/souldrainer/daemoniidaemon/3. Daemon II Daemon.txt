Like a knife cuts through you.With open eyes. Eye, behold the light. I feel whole and complete, this dream untrue.As your soul drifts away I feel pain.I fuck my sins, I await my death.The clouds uncovered the moon, it danced over the trees.As I covered in blood, I prayed to my God. Daemon II Daemon. I feast on your guts you fucking whore! Like a knife slit your veins.With well-shut eyes. Eye, behold the dark. I enter thee...
