Dark is the future
I do not hope
I do not wish
I do not believe

As civilization collapses
As a result of catastrophes
And overpopulation
Which is the curse
Of further generations

More technology
More power
More fucked up people

More technology
More power
More fucked up people

Resource wars
Are becoming
More and more
Important

Global destruction
By nuclear weapons
The cold world of industrialized mass
Production

21st century ideology
Is terror violence and fear
Religious apocalyptic thoughts
Of armagedons salvation

This world is a product of complacant ignorance
This world
The future is the catastrophic evolution of present actions
Present failures

This world is a product of complacant ignorance

Dark is the future

Global destruction

Dark is the future
I do not hope
I do not wish
I do not believe

Cultural catastrophes involve the destruction
Of everything
Of everything that makes this life
Meaningful
