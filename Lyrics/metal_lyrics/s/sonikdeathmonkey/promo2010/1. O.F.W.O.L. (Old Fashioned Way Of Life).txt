I see you going down and you don't even care.
Come on, look straight at me "You are living just a lie!"
Old fashioned way of life.
I see you feeling down, seeking life everywhere.
You haven't searched anywhere.
I think it's time to I say you, put your life in his hands.
I said to you push. Old fashioned way of life.
"Not what goes into mouth defiles a man,
But what comes out of the mouth defiles a man."

I am seeking of people with light in to their soul.
I am a psycho, a light bulb, addicted to the core.
Sickening activity, shallow material world. 
Call me a psycho or narrow minded, a sad clown.
Adopt the ability to merge new life with old.
Be a psycho, a light bomb, addicted to the core.
I say you, put your life in his hands.
It's time to put your life in his hands,
The old fashioned way of
It's time to put your life in his hands,
The old fashioned way of life
