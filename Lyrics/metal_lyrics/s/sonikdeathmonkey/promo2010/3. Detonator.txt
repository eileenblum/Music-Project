Trying to find strength each and every day pressuring sickness inside.
Driving straight down to the highway hear my heartbeat going fast
Sometimes I feel I can do anything sometimes I am beaten by sorrow.
Something about this, something is very wrong am I going to bleed tomorrow?

Putting on my mask to face up the world putting on my mask so you can smile
It is all you want to see from me it is all you need to see from me
Nine leaves on every branch with nine roots with nine ends.
A sanctuary Detonator it is going to rise Detonator.
A sanctuary Detonator it is going to rise Detonator.
If you die before you die,You will not die when you die
