How close we are
And what did you see?
The secretâs safe
And always on my mind
I know the consequences in my conscience
This will be the best night of our lives
When we survive!
Alright, alright!
Letâs make it the best night of our lives!
So now we party like animals
WE PARTY TIL THE MORNING SUNLIGHT
And we know everything is fine
You see, weâre all still alive

We only get one chance
So letâs try to survive!
Yeah, we only get one chance
So letâs keep it alive!

How close we are
And what did you see?
Your secretâs safe, and
Abandon my mind
We know the consequences in my conscience
This will be the best night of our lives
When we survive!
Weâre alright, weâre alright!
I know that things are this true
Youâll always be by my side
So now we party like animals
And party your whole fuckinâ life
We only get one chance, soâ¦
Letâs try to survive
We only get one chance
So letâs try to survive!
Yeah, we only get one chance
So letâs keep it alive!

So whereâs your head with all your secrets inside?
Tonight will be the best night of our lives
When we survive
When we survive
So whereâs your head with all your secrets inside?
Tonight will be the best night of our lives
When we survive
When we survive

We only get one chance
So letâs try to survive!
Yeah, we only get one chance
So letâs keep it alive!

WE WONâT LET THIS
DIE TONIGHT
TONIGHT IS A FUCKING
REVIVAL OF LIFE
WE WONâT LET THIS
DIE TONIGHT
TONIGHT IS A FUCKING
REVIVAL OF LIFE
