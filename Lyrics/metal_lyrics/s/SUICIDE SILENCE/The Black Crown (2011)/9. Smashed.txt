[feat. Frank Mullen of SUFFOCATION]Let's take our fucking lives back.
Life living through an hourglass,
the sand is falling and there's not much left.
It's like living in a photograph, witness the rubble from the past.
And how it's so full of memories,
now don't you wish you could turn that fucker over?
I want my life back, every grain of sand, I'll take it back!

Fuck living through an hourglass window, fuck living trapped in a
photograph, entombed by fragile glass,
let's smash this fucking shit!

It's my life and it's falling fast, no time for memories.
I say fuck the past!

Life living through and hourglass,
the sand is falling and there's not much left,
It's like living in a photograph, witness the rubble from the past.
And how it's so full of memories,
now don't you wish you could turn that fucker over?
I want my life back, every grain of sand, I'll take it back!

I want my life back, smash, smash everything!
And if you want your life back smash, smash it with me.
(smash, smash it with me)
Smash everything!

It's my life, I'll take back [2x].
