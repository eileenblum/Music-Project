It's the blood running through or veins to sustain, that makes us the same.
Not the color of creation, it's much an ignorant shame, we were all the 
same.
Pure ignorant through process to blame, segregated by our human hatred.
We are the same [2x].
Racist human beings, molded and remodeled with the hate from the past.
The ignorance of humanity proves our frail existence shall never last.
I know it's sad to say, I know it's hard to see,
we all look like enemies when we're all the same.
I'll cut myself just to make it bleed, open up my veins so that you can see
The blood flowing inside of me, is the same as yours, the same as yours!
Racist human beings, molded and remodeled with the hate from the past.
The ignorance of humanity proves our frail existence will never last.
I'll cut myself just to make it bleed, open my veins so that you can see
The only thing that sets us apart inside is a heartbeat,
hear it BOOM BOOM! [4x]
It's the blood running through our veins to sustain, that makes us the same.
Not the color of creating, it's such and ignorant shame, we were all the 
same.
Pure ignorant thought process to blame, segregated by our human hatred.
We are the same [2x].
Racist human beings, molded and remodeled with the hate from the past.
The ignorance of humanity proves our frail existence will never last.
I'll cut myself just to make it bleed, open my veins so that you can see
The blood flowing inside of me, the blood flowing inside of...
The only thing that sets us apart inside is a hearbeat,
hear it BOOM BOOM! [4x]
