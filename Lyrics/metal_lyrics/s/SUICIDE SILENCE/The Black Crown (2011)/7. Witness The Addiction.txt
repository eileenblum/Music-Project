[feat. Jonathan Davis of KORN]I used to pray everyday, wishing for a better way.
When nothing changed, I lost my faith, praying for a better day [2x]
Burn, Liar [4x].
Let's sew her fucking mouth shut!

All the lies you've said to me (you liar)
and everything you've led me to believe (is false)
Now it's time to re-live everything, everything that you put me through.

Coming home to addiction inside, it was always on my miserable mind.
Witnessing you addiction (through my eyes) it was always on my miserable 
mind.
Witnessing your addiction!
Your demons dancing right in front of my eyes [2x].
It's time to burn, liar [2x].

Witnessing your addiction! Your demons dancing right in front of my eyes 
[2x].

I used to wish I could fly, spread my wings and fly away.
I'd cross my fingers for a day, wishing for a better way.
So take my hands and take me away (burn, liar).
I'd close my eyes and even pray, wishing for a better day.

Coming home to addiction inside, it was always on my miserable mind.
Witnessing your addiction (through my eyes) inside your mind.
It was always on your fucking mind!
I used to pray every day, wishing, wishing for a better way, but nothing 
fucking changed.
When nothing changed, I lost my faith.
Praying, praying for a better day, everyday.

Witnessing your addiction! Your demons dancing right in front of my eyes 
[2x].
My eyes [3x].

All the lies you've said to me (you liar)
and everything you've proven to believe (is false).
You always said you would be okay, well fuck tomorrow, live for today!

Witnessing your addiction! Your demons dancing right in front of my eyes 
[2x].
