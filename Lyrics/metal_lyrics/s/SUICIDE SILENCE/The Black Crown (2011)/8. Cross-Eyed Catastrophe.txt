This my perception of what's going on.
This is my perception of what's going wrong.
With mind seperation, as you float to the sun,
with a psychedelic sidekick that's sparking in your mind.
I can see it in your eyes, I can see it just fine.
You're a cross-eyed catastrophe, fumbling,
bumbling into the wall you see.
And I'm here to watch you fall; I'm here to get you through this all.

Confronting your demons and throughts you've never had before.
Intricate thinking, and thoughts you've never had before.
This is what happens when you open that door, you're dwelling so
deeply passed out on the floor, eeah!

Cross-eyed catastrophe, seeing things you've never seen before.
You're passed out chasing the dream,
wake up and I'll decipher everything!
Confronting your demons and thoughts you've never had before.

I watched you feel so good, you looked amazed.
I watched your eyes get heavy and start to glaze.

Cross-eyed catastrophe.
Cross-eyed catastrophe, seeing things you've never seen before.
You're passed out, chasing the dream,
wake up, I will help you decipher everything!
So meet your demons, they're here to stay.
Meet your demons, they'll never go away.
Ohhh!

So meet your demons, they're here to stay.
Cross-eyed catastrophe, seeing things you've never seen before.
You're passed out chasing the dream,
wake up, I'll help you decipher everything.
