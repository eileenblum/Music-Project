If you hate the world around you.
and you hate everything that you see.
And if what you see makes you happy,
then fuck off cause we're all out of time.
So follow me.

Life is short, I'll make it what it's worth.
With time well spent, time spent so well.
So don't run away, just face the new day,
without a single fear in mind.
Just take it one day at a time!

And...Fuck everything! Everything!
Fuck everything! Everything!

Welcome to a nightmare,
this is the place we all call home.
Welcome to a nightmare,
this is the place we hate to call home.
We fucking hate! Hate [3x].

If you hate the world and you hate what you see,
then say this with me, fuck everything [6x].
Put your fingers in the fucking air,
and live your life without a care.
If you hate the world and you hate what you see, then say
this with me, fuck everything [2x].
If you hate the world, fuck everything, and it makes you
sick what you see, fuck everything.
Say this with me, fuck everything, fuck everything!

Fuck everything, fuck everything, ehya! [5x]
Fuck everything! Fuck everything! [7x]
