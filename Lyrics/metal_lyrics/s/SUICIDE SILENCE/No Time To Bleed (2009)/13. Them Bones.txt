[iTunes Pre-order bonus track]
[Alice In Chains Cover]

I believe them bones are me
Some say we're born into the grave
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ole pile a them bones

Dust rise right on over my time
Empty fossil of the new scene
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ole pile a them bones

Toll due bad dream come true
I lie dead gone under red sky
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ole pile a them bones
