Inside, inside your head you're wasting away
Away right in front of my eyes
You're scared, so weary and worn the fuck out
The addictions made you so sick, so sick and filthy
Poison
Your burden is life
It's made you weak and shake in the knees [x2]
Inside, inside your head you're wasting away
Away right in front of my eyes
So get lifted
Dependant on this artificial feeling
Poison
It's made you weak and shake in the knees
This is not your reality [x3]
This is not you
It's made you weak and shake in the knees
This is not your reality [x4]
This is not, this is not you
This is not your reality [x2]
