You see I'm wasted
I can't quite get up yet

You see my head's off resting in this delusional stare
You see I'm wasted
I can't quite get up yet
You see my head's off resting in this delusional stare

The room kept spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning
And I'm a fucking mess

So I closed my eyes
I shut them so tight
To witness explosions of pure color and beauty

The room kept spinning and spinning
I start to think a little differently at what we are

I watched the color drain from the world, that day [x2]

We're so very insignificant [x4]

With my eyes shut so tight
I'm still seeing all of this beautiful light [x3]

The rook kept spinning, and spinning, and spinning, and spinning
And I'm a fucking mess
We're so very insignificant

Embarrassment to molecules [x3]
