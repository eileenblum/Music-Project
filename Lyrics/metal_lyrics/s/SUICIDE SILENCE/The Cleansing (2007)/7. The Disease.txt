I'm the one man army [2x]
Of disease
I'm the one man army [2x]
Of disease

The creation that is the sickness
This is time to destroy everything
and never rebuild [2x]

I am the disease [2x]
I'm a disease
To the world [2x]
I'm the plague of
Disaster [2x]

And I'll continue to move forward
Like the monsters of money
Crime, crime and deceit [2x]

This is time to destroy everything
and never rebuild [2x]
I'm the one man army [2x]
Of disease

We've brought this world to its
Knees [2x]
We've brought this world to its
Knees [2x]

Now it's spread like wildfire [4x]
Wildfire [4x]

This world is dead, let it die [4x]

A fucking sick disturbing race
A close-minded existence [2x]

We are the fucking sick [2x]
It's the plague of us
And we're the disease
Of this disaster
You call your world

This world is dead let it die [2x]
So shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
And let the killing begin
