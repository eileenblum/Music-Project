I once thought that I had found the path
For so long I believed in all your bullshit
I once thought that I had found the path
'Till the day when I needed you

And with their hands held high
They waited for you to be by their side
With their hands held high
They waited for you, but you just
watched them all slip away

Into this translucent haze [2x]
I have fallen off this beautiful horse
Into this translucent haze

I lost all hope
I lost all fucking hope

So I guess you can say that
I'm one of the fallen [2x]
We are the fallen [2x]
And hated
We are the...

With their hands held high
They waited for you to be by their side
With their hands held high
They waited for you, but you
just watched them all slip away
You let them fall [2x]

With their hands held high
They waited for you, but no one
grabbed their hands
You let them fall

I can't believe they have wasted
so much time in prayer
So many years and words
have been wasted
False hope and the addiction
to searching [2x]

I have fallen off this beautiful horse
and lost all hope and heart
You let them fall [5x]
Off of this beautiful horse [2x]
