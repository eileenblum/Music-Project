Dry your eyes
Hide your face with your hands
One last breath
Hold it in

Fuck your past
The future
Is in your hands

Just sit back and relax
Put your fucking shades on
Put that gun to your head
You're a fucking disgrace

Can your god save you now? [6x]

You coward [4x]

Drowning yourself
In your tears
No one has
Pity for you [4x]

Seconds from the end
What's it gonna be
Pull the trigger bitch [4x]
