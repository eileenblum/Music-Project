Sewing the eyes shut of the
man who saw god
And ceasing the lies that
spill from his jaw [2x]

He won't be able to hear
where the screams are coming from [2x]
Sewing the eyes shut of the man who saw god
And ceasing the lies that spill from his jaw

It's just an endless abyss of pain and torment
And he will wonder where the
screams are coming from
And how does he know
Their cries [2x]

Because it's your fucking flock
heading to the butcher [2x]
As the tears began to burn like acid
As they spill from his eyes [2x]

Sewing the eyes shut of the man who saw god
And ceasing the lies that spill from his jaw
And as I torture and kill
The ones who followed him
In his lies [3x]
Followed him in his lies
