There is a god who hates me
Because I question his plague
This world shouldnât feel so empty
We are stronger than faith

We are god
We are god damned
We are god damned loud
We are god
We are god damned
We are god damned proud

Faith has become the cliff note to life
A bullet point for the weak
Words on paper are meant for advice
Advice is a seed
It wasnât meant for you it wasnât meant for me

All this life Iâve sat and waited
For your sacred words to come down and save me
Iâve been led so astray and betrayed that itâs hard to stand up
Hard to stand up
All this life Iâve sat and waited
For your sacred words to come down and save me
Iâve been led so astray and betrayed that itâs hard to stand up
Left on my own

Where has our motivation gone
I can describe the result
The path was so easily lost
Sedated by fear and guilt

We are strong
We are stronger than
We are stronger than faith
We are strong
We are stronger than
We are stronger than death

You always warned us about the end
When it was your own you feared
There is really only nothing left
Except what we have right here
Itâs not you, itâs me [4x]
Me!

We are god
We are god damned
We are god damned loud
We are god
We are god damned
We are god damned proud

All this life Iâve sat and waited
For your sacred words to come down and save me
Iâve been led so astray and betrayed
Astray and betrayed

All this life Iâve sat and waited
For your sacred words to come down and save me
Iâve been led so astray and betrayed that itâs hard to stand up
Hard to stand up
All this life Iâve sat and waited
For your sacred words to come down and save me
Iâve been led so astray and betrayed that itâs hard to stand up
Left on my own
Left on my own
