[Lyrics by Mitch Lucker]And I will continue to move forward
Crushing everything
Diamond crusher and I am the hammer
Youâre worthless not me
Living a lie that only I can see
Youâre worthless to me
Saying that you are something you will never be
The time is now
To prove your worth
Show the world
The world for what itâs worth

If youâre reckless and free, speak up sing this with me
With me
With me
Weâre all fucking free
If youâre reckless and free, speak up sing this with me
Weâre free
Weâre free
You canât fucking stop me

And as the world keeps moving forward, distorting everything
Dream smasher
Look to the sky and scream with me fuck this place
We are free

Your diamonds will crumble beneath my feet
Your beliefs in nothing prove that you are weak
And still symbolizing strength for your life choices makes me sick
I am the diamond crusher
I am the dream smasher

If youâre reckless and free, speak up sing this with me
With me
With me
Weâre all fucking free
If youâre reckless and free, speak up sing this with me
Weâre free
Weâre free
You canât fucking stop me
You canât fucking stop me
Iâm relentless youâll see
You canât fucking stop me
Iâm the diamond crusher
Dream smasher
Iâm the diamond crusher
Dream smasher
You canât fucking stop me [6x fading]
