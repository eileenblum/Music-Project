I said
Iâll wear the mask if I have to
I will inherit the crown
Iâll wear the mask if I have to
I will inherit the crown

A crowd so lost when you fucking left us
A public without their lungs
Your relentless prowess helped so many
Your memory will never be lost
Let me be your new foundation
Stone and iron make up these bones

Iâll wear the mask if I have to
I will inherit the crown
I said
Iâll wear the mask if I have to
I will inherit the crown

Can I please get a chance to fucking breathe
Iâm sick and tired of expecting this hate
Itâs up to you, what do you want me to be
I can be your best friend or worst enemy

Let me be your new foundation
Stone and iron make up these bones

A force much bigger then you or me
Iâm here for you to feast upon
Either way Iâm taken away
Hand on my shoulder your presence lives on
Either way Iâm taken away
Hand on my shoulder your presence lives on

Let me be your new foundation
Stone and iron make up these bones
Let me be your new foundation
Stone and iron make up these bones

Said
Iâll wear the mask if I have to
I will inherit the crown
I will inherit the crown
