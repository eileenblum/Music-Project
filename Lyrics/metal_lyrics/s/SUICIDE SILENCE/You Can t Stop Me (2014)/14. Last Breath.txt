[Bonus Track][originally by Hatebreed]All the prayers in the world can't bring you back.
It's your last breath, this is our last breath.

Taken from this earth without warning.
Victim of the ultimate injustice.
Nothing will ever make sense of this.
Nothing could have prepared me.

All that is left are memories
And the pieces of a shattered existence.
I wish I could bring back.
Right through your last breath.

It's your last breath, this is our last breath.
All the prayers in the world can't bring you back.
It's your last breath, this is our last breath.
LAST BREATH!
