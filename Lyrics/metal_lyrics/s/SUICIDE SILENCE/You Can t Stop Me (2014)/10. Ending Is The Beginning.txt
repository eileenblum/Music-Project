[Re-recorded from Suicide Silence EP]After
Canât be seen with these hands canât be seen
Canât be seen with these hands canât be seen
Canât be seen
Canât be seen, causes everything
Donât you see, causes everything
Canât be seen, causes everything

Give me your hand, reach out Iâll crush it
Give me your hand, reach out Iâll crush it
Cause is ok
Cause is ok

Nothing can be, something to me, nothing can be, me
Nothing can be, something to me, nothing can be, me

Smashing, lashing, slashing, for the same thing
I say, quit while we are heard

A victim of high tension, and beat me everyday
For what?
For what?

Scream for you lying
Canât be seen, causes everything
Canât be seen, causes everything
Canât be seen
