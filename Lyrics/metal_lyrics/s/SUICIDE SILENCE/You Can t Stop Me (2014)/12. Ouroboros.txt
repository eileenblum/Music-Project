All-knowing all we know is the end always shadows the beginning
(All-knowing)
All-knowing all we know is the end always shadows the beginning
(All-knowing)

This a constant eulogy
We are the judge
We are the judge
We are the jury
We are the jury
We are in trial and it wonât end well
Forsaken life
Itâs given us everything
And we still want more
More [3x]

In a sense weâre innocent
In a sense weâre innocent
In a sense weâre innocent weâre fucked from the start
Weâre soulless shells looking for a way out

This is a constant
Eulogy
Day by day
Day by Day
Wasting away
Wasting away
Look around enjoy this world we call our tragedy
Forsaken life
Itâs given us everything
And we still want more
More

All-knowing all we know is the end always shadows the beginning
(All-knowing)
All-knowing all we know is the end always shadows the beginning
