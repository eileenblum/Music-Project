[feat. George "Corpsegrinder" Fisher]Itâs controlling you
Shut it out
Shut it out
Shut it out before it owns you

The pressure has you man
Youâre lost disfigured in yourself
The voices haunt and make your thoughts into your own hell

Shut it out
Shut it out
Shut it out before it owns you
Shut it out
Shut it out
Shut it out before it owns you

So get your shit together
Youâre fucked up beyond repair
Itâs just a voice inside your brain

(Iâm everything)
Iâm everything you want to hide
I thrive off self-defeat
I need it please
Iâll give you a thousand reasons

Kneel down
Stay down
Stay down because I own you
Kneel down
Stay down
Donât shut me out because I own you

Thereâs something wrong
Thereâs something wrong here
Something needs to be done
Thereâs something wrong
Thereâs something wrong here
So take control and send those thoughts
Into your own hell
So take those thoughts into your own hell
Take those thoughts into your own hell
(Hell)

Itâs controlling you
You
Itâs controlling you
You
Youâre controlling you
You
Youâre controlling
Itâs controlling you
