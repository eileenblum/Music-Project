Life is a prison
Imagined by the demons within
Itâs in your head so get the fuck out and come see me

I will give you every ounce of my being
I will give you the strength
I will give you every ounce of my being
I will show you my strength

So let it drain out
Send every bit of that hate out to me
We are here to make this moment eternal
Just give me your hate

I will give you every ounce of my being
I will give you the strength
I will give you every ounce of my being
Just give me your hate

We have been beaten down, we have been pushed aside
We sing these songs so that you donât die
We sing these songs for the broken down
The beaten up and pushed aside
You arenât alone in this path of life
We sing these songs so you donât die
So you donât die

I WILL SHOW YOU A PIT OF REDEMPTION
A place where you can find your own
We wonât be tortured by the hatred
Taken in arms we make hate our home

We are the beaten and pushed aside
We sing these songs so you donât die
We are the beaten and pushed aside
We sing these songs so you donât die
(Die)
We sing these songs so you donât die

(We sing the songs for the broken down)
(The beaten up and pushed aside)
(You arenât alone in this path of life)

We sing these songs so that you donât die
We sing the songs for the broken down
The beaten up and pushed aside
You arenât alone in this path of life
We sing these songs so you donât, you donât, die
We sing these songs so you donât die
