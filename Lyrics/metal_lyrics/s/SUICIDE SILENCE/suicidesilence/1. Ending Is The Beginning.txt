After,
Can't be seen with these hands can't be seen [2x]

Can't be seen

Can't be seen, causes everything
Don't you see, causes everything
Can't be seen, causes everything

Give me your hand, reach out I'll crush it [2x]
Cause is OK [2x]

Nothing can be, something to me, nothing can be, me [2x]

Smashing, lashing, slashing, for the same thing
I say quit, while we are heard.

A victim of high tension, and beat me every day

For what? [2x]

Scream for you lying

Can't be seen, causes everything [2x]
Can't be seen
