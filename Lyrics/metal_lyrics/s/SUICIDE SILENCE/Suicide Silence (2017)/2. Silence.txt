Here we are
Are we transparent
Fall into this dive with me
Hope is at digression
Anger at all cost

It takes nothing to see
just how still you can be

Silence
Breathing in pure fear
Silence
Death is all I fear

All you fucking 

War berates us 
The simplest heart beat connects us
Rivers all flow into the ocean
I will meet you at the bottom

It takes nothing to see
just how still you can be

Silence 
Breathing in pure fear
Silence
Death is all right here

All you fucking do is complain

To hold head high
Ego must be low
To move ahead
You must let go

Silence
Breathing in pure fear
Silence
Death is all I hear
Silence
Death is all I hear
Silence 
Death is all I hear

All you fucking do is complain
