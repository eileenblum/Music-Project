Disembodied whispers
Trickle in my ear 
A gift through the shroud
To me this is disastrous
In retrospect I am disaster

Waining sounds in forests
I've grown to appreciate my disease 
This is my torture
In the end we all have to sleep
all considered nothing's clear 
What did I do to this

Conformity is the secret 
Conformity saves us all

And all considered nothing's clear
What did I do to this?

Conformity is the secret
Conformity saves us all
