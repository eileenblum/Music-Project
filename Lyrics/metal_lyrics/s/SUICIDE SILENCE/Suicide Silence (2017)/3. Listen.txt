I will break you before I break myself
Such a waste of time of space of life
And I will destroy you before I destroy myself
Instinctually you'll learn to love yourself

So take me along through the torrential clouds
it's all constructed inside

So what is there to be afraid of 
This place is tongue and cheek
It's all constructed inside
So learn to love me

Take me it's all constructed inside

So take me along through the torrential clouds
The perfect storm will never be good enough
Show me the torment
Constructed inside

I will break you before I break myself
Such a waste of time of space of life
And I will destroy you before I destroy myself
Instinctually you'll learn to love yourself

So take me along
It's all constructed inside 
Constructed inside 

So take me along through the torrential clouds
The perfect storm will never be good enough
Show me the torment
Constructed inside

I'll listen
