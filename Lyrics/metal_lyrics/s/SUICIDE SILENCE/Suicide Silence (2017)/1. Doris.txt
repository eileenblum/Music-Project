It crushes me to know she's ignored
Through her I wrote these words for none
Show me who it is inside 
Show me who I am inside 

To give, to let give
Either way this blood will rise
To be just be
Your love is draining through my eyes

Temperate weather was never my bag
You knew it and threw us right into the trash
One of our own
Show me who it is inside 
Show me who it is inside 

To give, to let give
Either way this blood will rise 
To be just be
Our blood is draining through my eyes 

To fit in
This unfit world is the lie
Fit in
This unfit world is a lie

To give, to let give
To be just be [2x] 
Our blood is draining through my eyes

Never be less
