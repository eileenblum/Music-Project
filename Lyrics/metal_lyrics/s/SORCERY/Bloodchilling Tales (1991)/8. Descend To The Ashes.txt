Beyond the limit of our minds
Beyond the horizon of our world.
High above our skilled knowledge
And deep down under what's good.

Left here to die.
In pain I cry.
Black wings fly.
To the ashes

I feel my heart stop beating.
I saw my body from above.
Then I heard a mighty voice tell.
I welcome you to your eternal hell.

[Chorus 2x]

Descend to the ashes. [4x]

Then all powers of hell released.
The pleasure of pain reincarnate.
Dark angel of death awoke to crusade.
The legions are strong again.
Waiting at the last gate to march.
And rule the world at last.
The prophecy of wise men became true.
The Antichrist, the beast will arise.

I thought all was a dream.
But I could feel the pain.
Alive I saw myself be sacrificed.
To the lord of the dark hordes.

[Chorus 2x]

Descend to the ashes. [4x]
