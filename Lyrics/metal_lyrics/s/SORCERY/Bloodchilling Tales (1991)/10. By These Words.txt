I draw circles on the floor with the sword.
Imagine a line of golden flames following the sword's point.
I held my goat skull to the north and whisper the rite.
Oh, hail Satan, Antichrist and the false prophet.

Hail you Belial, the leader of the force of evil,
in the war of the son of light and son of darkness.

Blood chilling tales of evil.

By these words.  By these words.

Adversary, the lord of the damned the lord of fate.
Take my soul and write with blood on my hands.
All the ancient evil, and the sign of the son 666.
Zazas, Zazas, Nasatanada, Zazas, by these words.

Raise, raise and slaughter the priest, insult the blood.
And curse the dismembered carcass of the lamb.

Blood chilling tales.

I A Luciferno, the prince of darkness, the prince to the crown.
One of the four princes to the golden throne of blood.
The leader of the almighty, whispering winds of mayhem.,
When the winds whisper the symphony of the damned.
Into my ear, I know that the time is right.
I held high my dagger with symbols of ancient evil.
And sacrifice the virgin in the name of the four hoards.

Name ti e four hoards.
By these words.
Blood chilling tales.
By these words.
