Beliefs are something wonderful. I lost all faith
Faith to life, now it's only pain and darkness.

I'm caught in a nightmare with only one way out.
I stepped through to the other side,
where I saw a ghostly reflection of myself.

I'm victimized by the legacy of blood
My two sides tear me apart.

My soul is polluted, tainted with chaos,
and the dark side has its upper hand.

I'm beginning to lose my sanity.
My soul is torn to pieces.
So much pain I can't stand it.
I have to release my vicious atrocity.

I'm victimized by the legacy of blood. 
My two sides tear me apart.

Now it's done, my mind has had it.
I took up the fight and lost it.
Suddenly my hopes are gone, all my dreams shattered.
I'm walking the road to insanity.

Each and every step I take, 
is toward the cold and bitter END.
