The twilight traps the wings of the silent valley.
Only the sound of dark cold wings speaks.
Furthest in horizon, sound echoes of glaring horns,
And suffering screams of men in battle.

The silence fractures of keen screams and fierce half.
They only survived with victory in eyes and steel.
Have find a well search for the campfire to burn.
And then urge to a clam rest under the starclear sky.

Wings traps of thunder, black as the night.
Flying with pride.
Dragons of the burning twilight.

his limbs awakes by the sunrays struck.
Gazing at the slowly dying flames with weary eyes
An awful scene spreads when the sun turns black.
Two enormous wings traps as thunder.

Wings traps of thunder, black as the night.
Flying with pride.
Dragons of the burning twilight.

Black as the night flying with pride.
Turn mankind to ashes, only the fire speaks
Turn brace warriors to burning corpses.
No one can tell, but the legend is eternal.

Wings traps of thunder, black as the night.
Flying with pride.
Dragons of the burning twilight.
