Silent water floating north
under the black mist of mystery.
A cold aura spreads from the black water.
Lifeless eyes star up from the deep.
The traces of once so proud warriors.
Now just twisted corpses under the river.

Rivers of the dead
The home of lost souls.
Rivers of the dead
Where dead men sleep

In one night wen thunder rages.
When the clouds fade.
And the black moon rises.
The signs are all clear.
The position of Capricorn.
And the shining black moon

The calm water starts to twirl.
Bony fingers start to climb.

Shining skulls slowly rise over the water.
An army of dead march to conquer.

Rivers of the dead
The home of lost souls.
Rivers of the dead
Where dead men sleep

To kill in Satan's name.
Rape the mankind.
