Two thousand years after the death of Christ.
A desert city freezes to ice.
Preachers praise the return of the messiah
Astronomy's force the evening star.
When three stars of heaven turn into one.
Messiah are here and the world will be gone.

All man that sinned
They will be gone
All those who didn't
Immortality given

The second sign will be the death of the sea.
And all of those who live within.
When the third seal is broken the earth quakes.
Like its last attempt to survive.

The sun will never rise.
All freezes to ice.

All newborn children die like once before.
Sudden death is the sign number four.

The sun will never rise. All freezes to ice.

All man that sinned
They will be gone
All those who didn't
Immortality given

The day turns to night, clouds gather in the sky.
The moon turns blood red. It's the sixth of signs
When the dead rise from the graves
The final day is here.

Then you'll know what it's too late.
No use to try, you can't escape your own fate.

All man that sinned
They will be gone
All those who didn't
Immortality given
