Cold blooded murder in the night.
Another victim cut to pieces
Terror fills people's veins with fright.
They talk of another "Jack the Ripper".

In darkness you walk alone in the back street.
So scared that you don't even hear the steps,
of the one known by everyone
More known as the psychopath

Psychopath - kill in every sight.
Ritual death - kill for Satan's might.

Feel his hand around your mouth.
Feel his knife slip through your throat.
Then you never ever feel any more.
You don't feel when he slashes your heart out.

He drinks your blood, eats your heart,
and mumbles the sacred verse.
He can feel himself grow stronger.
Then he disappears, and sacrifices are done.

Psychopath - kill in every sight.
Ritual death - kill for Satan's might.

Obsessed with Satanic power.
He shall rule the world.
All of them are guilty.
There's no innocent victims.
Kill all those who denied,
that Satan is the master of all.
