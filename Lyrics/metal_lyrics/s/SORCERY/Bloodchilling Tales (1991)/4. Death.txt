Down in the valley, the village still asleep.
The sun rises and the new day has begun.
The village awakes and their life goes on.

The reaper's out - collecting his souls
Following his victim - until their death

But no one notices, the stranger on the hill,
who's carrying black rags, which cover his head and arms
No one feels the chill wind, from the north.

The reaper's out - collecting his souls
Following his victim - until their death

Day turn to night, the stranger moves downhill.
With pride he walks down, with his scythe.
Someone is gonna follow him down tonight.

Darkness has fallen in the valley over the village.
A poor drunken old man sits and begs in a corner.
The angel of death will give him the gift of death
