You showed me a revelation - I watch your passion burn
You obedience of your presence - I count your breathes in eons
A power long forgotten - A flame that burns so black
Descent into chaos - embrace the fumes of doom

Spawned from the darkest seed - In a void so black and cold
A force through universe - To rule over all that is
The unforgettable pain - For those who doesn't see
Enlighten by the dark - I fill my soul with fear

Far beyond time
A power divine
An Unholy sign
Created from darkness and rage
Blessed in my heart
To reign upon sin
And rule upon fear
Created from darkness and rage

As we join our hands in the circle - there's no longer fear
The ancient power rises - our eyes turns black
The fire burns of our hate - consuming our souls
The rite to cleanse us all - has just begun

Sacrifices in your name - infested in flesh and bone
We all joined with you - warriors of the dark
Together we shall die - and rise as once before
But we will bring you down - destroyer of worlds

We control our revolution - we burn you down
Enslaving the uninvited - kill everyone
The cause is in our hearts  - our blood and mind
We never shall be conquered - we are your death

Far beyond time
A power divine
An Unholy sign
Created from darkness and rage
Blessed in my heart
To reign upon sin
And rule upon fear
Created from darkness and rage
