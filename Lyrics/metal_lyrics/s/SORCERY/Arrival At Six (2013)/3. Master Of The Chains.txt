Torn away like the sound of a broken dream
Baptized in water unpure that burns my soul
Beneath the cross, the symbol of eternal lie
I burn my lips on the chalice filled with blood

In the house of your lord my nightmares grow
Your light of glory never shall blind my eyes
The pain it causes will only strenghten me 
I aim to destroy to show my true believes

Haunted by Christ - the deceiver
The oppressor - Master of the chains
Freedom to slave - for salvation
The tyrant - of the human race

I was born in fire just to save us all
Who are kept in the dark by the sinister lies
The demon in me is so fatal to thee
Beware the arise of the new world order

Things will be put the ultimate test
And order will follow the Christian chaos
Sense my power increase as I breathe fear
Humble me the disciple of the beast

Haunted by Christ - the deceiver
The oppressor - Master of the chains
Freedom to slave - for salvation
The tyrant - of the human race
Haunted by Christ - the deceiver
The oppressor - Master of the chains
Freedom to slave - for salvation
The tyrant - of the human race
