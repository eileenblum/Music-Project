They come with torture
They come with pain
Carriers of the untrue word 
Bringers of the never dying flame

They want us to follow
To obey their book
But if we refuse to get in line
They want us dead

You preach - but we don't listen
With force - you will slave us all

Your ambition - divine control
WIth religion - you will slave us all

No matter what kind of believers you have - you are all just the same
You are killing the people the your gods name - you're the warbringer
You're the father of war, the mother of pain - you're the warbringer

With fear they can rule
Oppress them all
But we don't follow
We can't hear the call

No matter what kind of believers you have - you are all just the same
You are killing the people the your gods name - you're the warbringer
You're the father of war, the mother of pain - you're the warbringer
