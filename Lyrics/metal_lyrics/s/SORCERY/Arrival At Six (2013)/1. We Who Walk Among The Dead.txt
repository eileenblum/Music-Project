Living in  this zombie nation - we are caught in this frustration
Evil reigns, in our domains, they will rip your guts out
Brought up in the Promised Land - but carried underground
The dead has risen and walk again and there is nowhere left to hide

The final frontier lays open wide
For us who walk among the dead

They haunt their victims aimlessy - but no one will get away
No use to hide, they won't go by, the mutilation will never stop
They smell our flesh and urge our life - our heartbeats like a beacon
'Cause we are the living and you are the dead, it is time to raise our swords

Moldy bones that lies around
Crawling shadows from underground
Deathlike gasps that fill the void
Decayed eyes that follow you

Gathering of the dead is here - we will destroy them all
They is out to spill the blood, tear us limb from limb
We are the revolution - protectors of the cause
No one shall pass who doesn't live we are the riders of the storm

Our final frontier lays open wide
For us who walk among the dead
We who walk among the dead
We who walk among the dead
We who walk among the dead
We who walk among the dead

All the graves lie open
Like a bottomless pit
Generating the undead
Carrying the flame of unlife

In the age of the thunderstorm - all around seems gone
In desolate ruins we meet our fate, now we do or die
Walking in these grave like streets - with bodies at our feets
We are the saviors of the human race and it's time for you to fall

Our final frontier lays open wide
For us who walk among the dead
We who walk among the dead
We who walk among the dead
We who walk among the dead
We who walk among the dead
