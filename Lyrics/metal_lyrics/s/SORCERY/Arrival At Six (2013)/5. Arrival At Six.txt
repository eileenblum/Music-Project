Time stand still where their souls still roam
An everlasting lines they comes
Evil rulers, deathlike machine
Fueled be bodies, consumed in hell
Shy is hidden in black smoke
Road to hell lies iron clad
Survive the trail of fear
Just to die in the flames

Scent of terror buried in the soil
The walls is filled with screams
A sea of tears have moistened the plains
Upon the skulls and bones
A mist of souls stares in pain
Where a million heartbeats ceased
Your ashes painted this ground black
Stench of burning flesh

We are here to see
End of humanity
Just as no-one knows
Whose are friends or foes

We are witness to something that everyone tried to hide
They ruled the darkest days with terrror to survive
Feeding the machine with an endless genocide
The last train passengers they all arrived at six

Couldn't hear a sound 
From those underground
But I sense the fear
Buried deep inside

They all were gone by the morning sun
But no-one never should be left unfound

We are witness to something that everyone tried to hide
They ruled the darkest days with terror to survive
Feeding the machine with an endless genocide
The last train passengers they all arrived at six

Couldn't hear a sound
From those underground
But I sense the fear
Buried deep inside
