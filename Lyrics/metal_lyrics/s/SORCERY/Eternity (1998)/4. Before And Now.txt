Now I try, where are you?
I don't want to change my life
Because under the shadows
I don't want to tell you goodbye
You are my eyes, you are my mind
But only you are my life
You don't understand me but take my hand
Living for your heart, crying to the fear
You are in my sweet dreams every night
Giving you my life fighting for your love
Love is like run through the dark
After a love I don't want to be free
I need my girl playing with me
But after the freedom I want to see
My mind was blind but now is free
Now I'm laughting, where are you?
I don't give a shit, yes!
Because now I've found life without your pain
I have my eyes and I have my mind
I'm alone in my life
You didn't understand me
I take my way
Living for my heart, laughting at fear
You are in my nightmare some night
Now I have my life without a war
Love is like run through the dark
Through the dark
After a love I don't want to be free
I need my girl playing with me
But after the freedom I want to see
My mind was blind but now is free
Living for my heart, laughting at fear
You are in my nightmare some night
Now I have my life without a war
Love is like run through the dark
Through the dark
After a love I don't want to be free
I need my girl playing with me
But after the freedom I want to see
My mind was blind but now is free
