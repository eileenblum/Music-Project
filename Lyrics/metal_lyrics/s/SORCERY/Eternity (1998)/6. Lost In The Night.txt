I'm lost in the night
I'm watching the sky
I feeling all alone in life
There is a paradise of rage
And pain in my heart
I must repeat my life
Because I know that's
More intense that one love's pain
I will find the best life
When I see the light
I want to feel the power in my heart
Lost in the night
I try to search for one light
While I'm listening to my cries
Along the darkness
The silence is here with me
To open my eyes with rage
Lost in the night
I try to search for one light
While I'm listening to my cries
Along the darkness
The silence is here with me
To open my eyes with rage
Lost in the night
I see the stars in the sky all (the) night
