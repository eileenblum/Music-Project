Protected by a cloak of darkness
It's easy to walk for walk
With the hope to find what in one moment filled my life
I feel my heart is breaking
And while my mind laughts
I forget to listen her
Now I'm dying in my pain
I only want to forget that
She didn't take all the love I gave her
Maybe someday things will change
Now my mind talks me slowly
And ask me: Tell me Why?
I answer nothing
'Cos my heart now is not mine
With a destroyed spirit
I'm looking for but under the soul's roof
I don't understand
How my heart resist the storm
Only beating on, only beating on
Walking in the darkness
I can see your face beyond
And your smile breaks my reality
And carries me to a fantastic world
I don't wanna wake up
Allow my dreams may come true
'Cos your heart
Now is not mine
(So I will never give up)
I only need a guide
That leave me out of the dark
And the guide is your eyes
They're for me a source of light
Maybe the wait will be longer
Maybe I'm going along a wrong way
The time will decide it all
But I don't have so much
You just think about it all
You just about it all
Walking in the darkness
I can see your face beyond
And your smile breaks my reality
And carries me to a fantastic world
I don't wanna wake up
Allow my dreams may come true
'Cos your heart
Now is not mine
You're the only, don't forget me
Yours my body and my soul
You're the only, don't forget me
Yours my body and my soul
Walking in the darkness
I can see your face beyond
And your smile breaks my reality
And carries me to a fantastic world
I don't wanna wake up
Allow my dreams may come true
'Cos your heart
Now is not mine
