Sleeping in the hotel
The nightmares in the night
Always board my mind
Following remembers
Hard past in a time of love and hate at last
Listen to the voice
Now it's talking to my ear
Can I remember something better?
Protected by the evil
Now I can desist
I am gonna change this, now!
When the pride and honor die
There's no harder pain
The only reason to survive is the own life
Just now I'm going to escape from your body and your mind
You're a nusty love and life
The posion of your kisses
The madness of your hugs
Can makes me so fine
Oh, I stand by you
And now you close the door
I make hole and bury all the time I gave you then
And try to kill your soul
The feelings are so hard to kill
And time remains in my life
I think it can be worse
Staying at home
I'm waiting for my destiny
There's no time to fall
'Cause I just need to take the best way
To find the love from here to eternity
I can see my soul falling down
Oh, I stand by you
And now you close the door
I make hole and bury all the time I gave you then
And try to kill your soul
The feelings are so hard to kill
And time remains in my life
I think it can be worse
Staying at home
I'm waiting for my destiny
There's no time to fall
'Cause I just need to take the best way
To find the love from here to eternity
I can see my soul falling down
Follow the sign
And live in your world
'Cause I can remain in the past
Say what you know
And open your mind
I'm going to get into the time
