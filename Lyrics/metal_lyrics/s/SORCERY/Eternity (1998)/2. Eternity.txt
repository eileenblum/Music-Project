I'm in a moment in my life
That's very hard to think in the past
Light twinkles in my eyes
I know I must look forwards
Oh! I'm waiting for eternity, Eternity!
I was born to fight, never loose
I looking for my future life
Now all the shadows disturb me
Fight with me to set me free
Oh! I'm waiting for eternity, Eternity!
Oh no! Between two worlds
Slaves of fate and eternity
Oh don't you dread death
We will see reality
Everybody is afraid of death
But in this world exists the law
One life with pain
And another world for love
Oh no! Between two worlds
Slaves of fate and eternity
Oh don't you dread death
We will see reality
