In another world perhaps in an other life
There's a place out of the storm
Land of peace, glory and joy
There where I lived
In the limits of real world
I lived an incredible story
When I found a new friend
And a magic world around
One night of storm I met the wind
Lighted by the stars tell me some words
When the night comes back
And it's magic and dark
Your soul flies in the air
Are you blind?
Your father's the sky
And your mother's the night
Your sisters' the stars
Because you are son of the sky
You live like a light
But open your eyes
Is the reason of your life
You're son of the sky
I look up my way
Look up my fate
I can feel my roots inside
And my life questions me
Why I live alone in this world?
In the night when I close my eyes
I listen to voices all around
Sometimes I think this is not my way
Tell me the truth my friend
One day the sky set me down
Like wind around reminds me the words
When the night comes back
And it's magic and dark
Your soul flies in the air
Are you blind?
Your father's the sky
And your mother's the night
Your sisters' the stars
Because you are son of the sky
You live like a light
But open your eyes
Is the reason of your life
You're son of the sky
My father wanted that I lived here
My mother cries with the stars
My friend the wind opened my eyes
Now I know the reason of my life
I'm son of the sky
I live like a light
I'm son of the sky
Is the reason of my life
I'll return to the sky
I'll return!!
Because... I'm son of the sky
