I'm still here but they run
Minutes fly towards the end
One day, one month, one year
Go out and will no return
To the streets of my heart
Running through the dark night
Come to hell with me
I will see you in another life
When our souls will be free
No more wasted time
Wasted time
Wasted time
No more wasted time
Wasted time
I'm in the darkness
Where the evil flies
With the same name of time
I want to stop the clock cause
He will kill my life
And I'd be a spirit in the sky
Running through the dark night
Come to hell with me
I will see you in another life
When our souls will be free
No more wasted time
Wasted time
Wasted time
No more wasted time
Wasted time
No more wasted time
Wasted time
Wasted time
No more wasted time
Wasted time
No more wasted time
Wasted time
Wasted time
No more wasted time
Wasted time
WASTED TIME
WASTED TIME
