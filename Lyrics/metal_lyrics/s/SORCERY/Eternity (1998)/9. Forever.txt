Something in your eyes
Now it's talking to me
I can see the pain
And the doubt of do it wrong again
The faults are not definitive
You understand
You're in fight again
Between your heart and your head
Only you decide
What you can or can't do
Don't forget
'Cos now you have our future in your hands
But now it's time to do it all
You spent your greates moments with me
All the confusion flies
You're living in a promised land
'Cos love always will win this war
You can change your mind
But your heart will be sure forever
There's no rule, there's no space
But time always gives the right
And my reason to life is to give love to you
Maybe you understand
I can't wait anymore
I need to close your door
Waiting for another girl you know
The tenderness I give you take hold on
But now it's time to do it all
You spent your greates moments with me
All the confusion flies
You're living in a promised land
'Cos love always will win this war
You can change your mind
But your heart will be sure forever
There's no rule, there's no space
But time always gives the right
And my reason to life is to give love to you
You can turn right all the things
You must do it don't waste time
My illusion all of you!
'Cos love always will win this war
You can change your mind
But your heart will be sure forever
There's no rule, there's no space
But time always gives the right
And my reason to life is to give love to you
