I feel a strange pain in my heart
I feel sadness in my mind
Waiting to cry or laugh
When he opens my door
Waiting to cry or laugh in the dark
When I begin to cry
While he closes my eyes
He listens to what I say
Talking with my heart
He helps me to carry on
Silence is my friend
'Cause the worlds fly with the wind
They're flying free near the dark storm
Now the silence is my friend
Now the silence in my life
Is the reason to fight
But now I only have an empty heart
Now it is free by the past
When I begin to cry
While he closes my eyes
He listens to what I say
Talking with my heart
He helps me to carry on
Silence is my friend
'Cause the worlds fly with the wind
They're flying free near the dark storm
Now the silence is my friend
Now I have clouds in my eyes
And emty words in my heart
Now I'm looking at the sky
Listening to silence in loneliness
When I begin to cry
While he closes my eyes
He listens to what I say
Talking with my heart
He helps me to carry on
Silence is my friend
'Cause the worlds fly with the wind
They're flying free near the dark storm
Now the silence is my friend
