Standing out were together
And this time they're all gonna pay
Shredded jeans and a leather
Now things are going my way
Well terrorize, through these eyes
I'm seeing through the lies
When heaven dies the fool cries
And they've all been hypnotized
Another feeling to settle
Now things are going my way
When heaven dies it's forever
That's all you'll hear from me
RUN FOR COVER
This vicious attack is fighting for the night
RUN FOR COVER
The blackout is comming you better run for your life
