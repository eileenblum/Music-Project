On the Rise and rising out together
im calling out our forces multiply
I can see theres nothing else to live for
the true must keep the spirit alive

NO FALSE METAL
get away from me
NO FALSE METAL
I've got everything I need
NO FALSE METAL
get the fuck away from me
NO FALSE METAL
cause I'd love to see you bleed

Other Eyes, come to share our glory
leave em all, they'll never understand
I'm alive, and I will live forever
The True must keep the spirit alive
