riding on the streets again you see the feeling in my eyes
trying to be free again will take you to the other side
power filled with vengance
warriors on the rise
we are the leaders of a ship thats sailing free
heavier than metal for me
when all is lost were still fighting to believe
heavier than metal for me
guided by a shooting star I follow to the very end
a legion filled with metal dreams there only living to defend
riding on the streets again I see you fighting by my side
the powers in our hands again this time were gonna make it right
