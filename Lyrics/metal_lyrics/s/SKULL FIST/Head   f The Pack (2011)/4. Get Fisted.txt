black was the night that followed me home in the rain
dark was the light that left me alone in the day
and now it'll never stop the raining
and they say turn away
get fisted
I cant wait for the feeling today
the left of my side took all the power away
the right in my eye holding the feeling of day
and now it will never stop the raining
and I'll say turn away
get fisted
I cant wait for the feeling today
Get fisted oh tonite
Get fisted All Right
