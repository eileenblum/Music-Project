Running through the wild
hiding in the night
he's commin after me
a siren heading forward
gotta get away
can't take my freedom
and now im always running
have a little fun
but I gotta get away

now I'm trying
I know thats all I've got
and im hiding
hiding like a fox

Had to make a stand
they try to take away
my peace of freedom
gotta give it all you got
Don't let them take you down
