[originally by Tokyo Blade]Sunrise, another day, smile on a killer's face
Strikes terror through the heart, all's lost without a trace
Pressure high at overload, fever pitch, it's gonna blow
They're closing in, the time is short
Somebody's gonna steal the show
A game of chance, the stakes are high
Spin the wheel, the ball will ride
No escape, no return
Squeeze the trigger, it's time to die

Power mad, the path is set
Can anybody tame this land
Terror deals destruction
Are we gonna change this hand
Make a stand, the charge begins
One step from genocide
And everybody's screaming why
It's hard to tell who's on your side

[Chorus]
Attack, attack
Until there's no one left to fight
Attack, attack
My gun is ready to explode
Attack, attack
until there's no one left to fight
attack, attack
my gun is ready to explode
