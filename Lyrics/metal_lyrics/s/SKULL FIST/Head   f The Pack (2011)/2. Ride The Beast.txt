I never had a real life before
Face down into the floor
Couldn't keep just a little for me
It was all for you and none for me
Aim High and ridin free
That's what he said to me
I don't need to save my soul
I gave it away to a girl named rock n roll

I ran the streets like I never before
Fists in the air and I'm screaming more
Slowed down at a cross on the wall
Walked on in feelin tall
Do you know cause I know
I know I'm living low
Do you know and I know
I ride the beast and I'm in control

I shot the devil and I killed the priest
And I'll live forever cause I ride the beast
I eat the wealthy and I killed the poor
I rob the others blind and I'm commin back for more
