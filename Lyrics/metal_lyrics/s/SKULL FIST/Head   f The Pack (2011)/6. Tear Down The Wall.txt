closing all around me
they got me trapped inside
taunting me with millions
can't make it through the night
choking me with pleasure
killing me with lies
chasing me with minions
trying to survive

Forces from the unknown
come to take our minds
Running never saved you
your fading out of sight
steads will follow always
crystals never lie
the only way to save yourself
is fighting till you die
this calls for vengeance
weve made up our mind

TEAR DOWN THE WALL
the hammer of the gods
Im smashing down the lies
the power of the night
fighting for the right

I bring the news of terror
they're armys drawing near
Carry out your weapons
Victory is near
Fellow soldiers hiding
Rise up from the grave
resurrect the kings and
speak the words of legacy
