time running out but thats ok
that sacred place I'll find it my way
I can feel that feeling
I'll make through I aint gonna run
I spoke the words with no help from anyone
I couldnt shake that feeling

dont let go
wont let go

an axe attack and I'm on the right track
a speed demon I can't go back
Do you know my reason
fully charged and Im gonna explode
I had a power overload
now I know my Reason

you gotta commit to rock

and if you leave and say that I'll cry
but I know my love for rock will never die

you gotta commit to rock
