when the leaders of the brave
got noone left to save
wait until the end of day
when the lion starts to tame
and the trainer looks the same
got to find another way

and the moon begins to light
and the tiger starts to fight

I'm commanding the night

when you've got nowhere to turn
thereâs a path you better learn
take the highway to the stars
nobody in the way
forever you can stay
no one can ever take it away

and the moon begins to light
and the tiger starts to fight

I'm commanding the night

axes in the wind places noones ever been
mountains on the rise and you know youll never die

when your riding in the wind
to a place youve never been
never turn your head away
the dreamers always fly
you know you'll never die
take the highway to the stars

and the moon begins to light
and the tiger starts to fight

I'm commanding the night
