Out here were lost again
got a feeling I know this is the end
the scenery has got me on the run
can't stand the slave they all become

back inside there out of control
I gotta stay in line to save my soul
theyll never take it away
theyll never take it away
I've got the lion in my heart

Can't stop running I gotta keep running
ride on and on and on
cant keep running i gotta stop running
ride on and on and on

there I was back inside again
wasting time in another line

oh no im lost again
got a feeling I know this is the end
theyll never take it away
theyll never take it away
I've got the lion in my heart
