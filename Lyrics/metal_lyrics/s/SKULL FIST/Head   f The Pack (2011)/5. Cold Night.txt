silent in the night
I think I'm all alone
sleeping in heaven
A sudden streak of light
A vision in my sight
I can't be alone
awaken in a dream
with things i've never seen
I feel the call
I'm not alone tonight
a stranger in my site
he breaks through the walls
follow the visions you have taught
Feels right to be cold when all is hot
follow the visions to this spot
where all has been forgot
I only get one shot
A Cold Night is all I've got
Take me ail the way to paradise
take me far away from home
It had to be this town
was lost and never found
I answered the call
A million miles away
will never be the same
when you took me away
