I lived alone but I was never away from paradise
never returned cause my feelings are still as cold as ice
we never stray cause it's just me
dont walk away
you say your proud just to honor the code of morality
without even listening I found out that you weren't there for me
we never stray cause it's just me
dont walk away
head of the pack
no turning back
youve got the words but your feelings will never understand
Theyll never realize I'm already in my promised land
we never stray cause it's just me
dont walk away
head of the pack
no turning back
