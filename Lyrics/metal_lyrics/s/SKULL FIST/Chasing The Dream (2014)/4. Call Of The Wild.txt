know you'll never understand
why I'm fighting until the end
but I know you'd leave me dying
you say I need a real friend
to keep my high and to pretend
that there's no use in trying
I see a spirit in my sight
telling me to stand and fight
but there's nothing left to fight for
so for all my dreams forever lost
never asking for a lot
the wild will set me free
well never know
who's holding on inside
but now and then we'll fade away
and ill never know
I'm on the other side
and you'll stay the same
call of the wild
please set me free
take me to the other side
I hear the call of the wild
