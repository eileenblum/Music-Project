sharing these visions
it's all that you show
well your crying of darkness
I'll never know
I won't break no promises
and I'll never tell you a lie
'Cause my heart never bleeds
there's nothing here to hide
your raised in the wall
inventing a life
someone could save you
but I'll never try
I won't waste my memories
begging on my knees
darkness can fade
and destiny never bleeds
don't stop the fight
be strong and make it right
stay true this night
keep us alive
white lies to get the best
stay tough and fuck the rest
'Cause I'll never stop the fight (CHANT)
so you better stay strong tonight
don't stop the fight
