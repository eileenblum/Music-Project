You say its been said I know its been done
But I cant shake that feeling it wont be undone
I'm lying awake when I know I should run
To get back the power and feel like I've won

I've carried the wind I've battled for time
But no one remembers the mountain I've climbed
I'll give you the truth but the end is the same
I wont live forever so carry the flame
Can you hear what I'm saying
Will you ever listen
Only got one hour to live
That's how you know its all I will give
You and me
I'll never let you down

I've only got one hour to live
That's how you know its all I will give
I've only got hour to live
Burning this town for reasons to live
You and me
I'll never let you down
