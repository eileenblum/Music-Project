they say I was born from over the hills
raised in the shadows following the will

a child in there eyes but walking alone
I dream of a warrior This power is my own

FOLLOW THE SIGN across this northern land
WARRIOR OF TIME the sword is in my hand

sign after sign I am bound to the steel
this is my time I can feel
the sign of the warrior
follow the sign 

a kingdom his majesty is lost
a warrior the sign hes forgot

was born on the wings the wings of the steel
forever will carry on this warrior is real

FOLLOW THE SIGN across this northern land
WARRIOR OF TIME the sword is in my hand

sign after sign i am bound to the steel
this is my time i can feel
the sign of the warrior
