we had a vision from a dream
as wild as I've ever seen
were gonna rock in other lands
but you threw it in my hands
I didn't need you standing there
cause I was never scared
I wouldn't quit it for a day
But when you changed I stayed the same

and then your begging for a chance
hiding with romance
and I'll regret it to this day
with that smile you turned away
you whisper in the air
but now the wind is on my back
and I'll make through to say you're gonna pay
no turning back

you always treated me this way
you're gonna pay
you're gonna pay
when there's nothing left to say
you're gonna pay
you're gonna pay
