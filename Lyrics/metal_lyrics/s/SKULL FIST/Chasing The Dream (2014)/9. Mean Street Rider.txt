It feels alright being closer to the edge
when I'm riding right through you
and Ill stay all night when I know I must defend
I must protect my only land

Mean Street Rider
its the feeling that I'm only getting higher
Mean street rider
riding with desire
follow me and I will take you higher

when I'm trapped inside with no heading for the door
I can feel my power surge
when I'm shaking in my mind but I know I can depend
I'm gonna ride it till the end

You can never get me down when Speed is on my side
there's nothing else that's true
Ive dreamed it all my life and ill never lose the sight
That's more than I could say for you
