It rips the power out of my sight
and brings me to my knees
'Cause in the darker the nights
it's shaking my beliefs
I'll hide the feelings
I won't feel it right
I can't bring the passion back
it's love out of sight

It's a different look in my eye
when there's nothing you could hold
with another disguise
a heart made out of gold
but well drift together
and you can call my name
but when you see it crashing down
Id do it all again
so cold
but no one understood
no control
just because I could
because you know I'm bad for good
bad for good
just like I knew I always would
bad for good
I've got a feeling that I should
bad for good
because you know I'm bad for good
I'll drift forever
so don't call my name
don't try to bring me back
I'll stay the same
