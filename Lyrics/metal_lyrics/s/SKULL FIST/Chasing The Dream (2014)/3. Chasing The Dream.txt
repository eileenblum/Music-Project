I'm on these speeding wheels
and I ride to victory
I give it all I got so there's no way you'll follow me
and in this tired land
I'm faster than a steed
I feel the power flow ain't nothing that I need
I see you in the streets
your always going slow
should've got it right but there's no way you'll know
ain't got the time for me
you think this feelings free
you took your biggest shot but couldn't even see
I'll rise above
I'll always love
chasing the dream
I'll never give it up
this world is meant for me
I hear you say the words I know you'll never feel
so as you crawl ahead
I'll be speeding by
these mighty words will never die
