We all lie but you lied longer
Fed with promises until it was over
Too much trust to someone else
Now I know all. How to make it well

The time has come &amp; I'm coming for you
I know this place and what should I do
But I don't see you there

We wanted so much and made every effort
Now in the face of this time I have got
And you betrayed me
