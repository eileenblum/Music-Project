I wanted to be when that something else
Not to be the one who is cheating on me
But still: don't ever see in my dreams
Our happiness - a figment of sick imagination

Now to make a step forward
And to do everything to hate myself

By the way, we are drowning by the will of fate
Inflicted to you, suffering
As well as a sense of envy and anger
Disappear and will not be
