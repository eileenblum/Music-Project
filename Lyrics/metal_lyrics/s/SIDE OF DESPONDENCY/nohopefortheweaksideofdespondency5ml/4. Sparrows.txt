[performed by Side of Despondency]Fucking cold autumn, I hate you
For you as for my thoughts anyway
Meets alter ego
I'll tell you more at this time
While we be silent
Helplessly hide and blame

Everyday evil, spilled into puddle
Reflect flocks of birds in this cloudy skies
Onslaught of melancholy, depreciation at all
They will not see and just fly by
