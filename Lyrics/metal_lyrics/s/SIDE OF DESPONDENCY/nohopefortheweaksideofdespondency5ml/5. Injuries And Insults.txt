[performed by Side of Despondency]So sorry for people misdeeds
Even those that did not commit
Hurt and the bursting of patience
Random photos of cute injured animals

Ready to kill each other
For anything just so even
Made a hell on Earth
Will never be forgiven

Who sow evil, its the same shall he also reap
Will return back all that he gave
Hand of salvation, was a swamp
Not to be deceived
Come back and save
