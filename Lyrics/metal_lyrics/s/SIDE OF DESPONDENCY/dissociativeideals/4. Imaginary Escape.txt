Since there were 2 periods 
Of cold and snow, the distant past, 
And a strip of time between 
Now and then, I remember my fear again, 
My escape of my own present. errors so 
That the thoughts sink 

Into the pit of oblivion. 
How it was long ago, but it all likewise 
Year by the year. warming .. seemingly everything went 
I thought that's all gone. but now it's all the same 
I don't care
