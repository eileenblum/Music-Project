At some point. without you 
I miss you, I feel so bad, come back to me 
Today I dreamed of you. I was you 
Hiding, hiding and running away 
I remember a long time ago, I also ran 
When you told me to run 
Although I had to stay 
With you 

Ever since been looking for you 
Call. But it is all in vain 
Each day ends with a void 

Where are you? I feel so bad alone 
I lost all my hope 
I don't want my life as my own 
And I wanted so much to kill myself 
I feel my guilt 
In all that happens my fault 
Everything had to be otherwise
