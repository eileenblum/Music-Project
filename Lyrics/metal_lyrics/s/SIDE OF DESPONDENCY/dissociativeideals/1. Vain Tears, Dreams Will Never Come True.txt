Now can finally calm down 
Some things are not as important as they used to 
Don't worry and don't cause tears 
Some say that it must be so, and correctly 
And we should rejoice in the fact that there are 
Strive and dreaming about.. 

Forced to stay to watch something 
As if it's true and should be like ravings 
Painful and sad. I can't stand it any longer 
Nice and fake. again and again 
All the zeros and I stumble on level ground 
Always the case. Nothing changes
