Never know what we want 
Choose one, and wish more 
Doubt pursue to the end 
This is happened as it is not so? 
Or so because it should be intended 
Features for your perception 
Mind and thought, sight and touch 

Today it is one man, tomorrow is another 
They change too quickly 
No one has the right card 
The last one was killed by his own judgments: 
Where to go, where the shore, 
The port and the wind in the sails 

So similar to each other 
We are so alike it's you or me? 
You looks like me 
But it seems is not I 
So similar to each other 
We are so alike it's you or me? 
If you don't, it means that i will do 
So similar to each other 
We are so alike it's you or me? 
You looks like me 
But it seems is not I
