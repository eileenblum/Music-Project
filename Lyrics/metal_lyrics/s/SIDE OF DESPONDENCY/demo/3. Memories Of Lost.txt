Time of late forgotten spring,
In every breath.
A new day is beginning,
But without me.
On sleeping and cold earth,
The fog clouds,
Colors of grey like a death,
Cover once and for allâ¦

Echo of my dying scream â
In this grey mourning,
Shadow of not coming true dream â
In this grey mourning,
Dirge of silence for me â
In this grey mourning,
And heavy rain carrying the grief â
In this grey mourning.

Joy, happiness, serenity, life
Sorrow, despair, apathy, death
Sobbing, howling, tears and cries
Laughter, smiles, kissesâ¦ Everythingâs dead

Memories of lost,
Of lost life,
Of death,
Of the end and the beginning without meâ¦
