Fading lights touch my face,
Fading, like human race.
Under pale rays of frozen sun,
Iâm eternally wandering

Cold beauty of winterstar
Charms my soul, charms my heart.
And face of death in thick snowfall,
Follow me in every winter part

Last drops of sunrise,
In depths of my dead eyes.
My blue lips are in eternal smile, why?..
Fading light of frozen sun, goodbye
