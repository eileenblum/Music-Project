Through ancient frozen forest,
As if wandering ghost between dead tress,
Iâm searching for forgotten sourceâ¦
Their waters will warm my cold fleshâ¦
Merciless northern wind beats my face,
But I donât feel his fierce malice to all thatâs aliveâ¦
In this misplaced realm of snowglades,
I fall asleep and see a dream about the end of my lifeâ¦

And sticky cold had pierced my flesh
Snowfall will wrap my body with winterâs ashes
