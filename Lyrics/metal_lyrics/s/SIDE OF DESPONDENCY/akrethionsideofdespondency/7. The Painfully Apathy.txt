[performed by Side of Despondency]I, I can try again and again,
To wake up not in this life,
But day by day the mourning sunlight,
Wake me up in my bed.
And all happen again (and all happen again),
It is a wasting of time
Doing that you donât need,
Thoughts about suicide (visit me).

Deep inside of me (deep inside of me),
In every reflection of my sick mind,
So slowly poisoning me,
Like swallowing inside.

Only dead illusions and the ghostly visions â
This is the real life for me.
All â an abstraction, fiction and indifferent inaction,
Yes and what for all that? ...

In each manifestation of life,
I see â deathâ¦ deathâ¦ deathâ¦ deathâ¦ deathâ¦
When I fall asleep haunt me
The nightmares of funeral and death.
How many songs are sang and dedicated to death?â¦
Deathâ¦ deathâ¦ deathâ¦ deathâ¦
So let one more scream of pain and despair will sound for deathâ¦

So easy to begin last journey,
Just to choose your portal,
To the land of the ruby sands,
Through simple objects.

Beyond the lifeâs gates,
Fairyland waits for me,
Let Charon be my guide,
And his rook â a portal.
