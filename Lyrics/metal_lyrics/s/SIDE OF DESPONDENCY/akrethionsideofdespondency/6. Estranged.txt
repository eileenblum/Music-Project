[performed by Side of Despondency]When this life is a nightmare,
Heart is impaled by the sticky fear,
Every dayâs like a fight,
On my own way to suicide.

How many nights I didnât sleep?
And with every day I see more shit.
World seems go crazy and devour itself,
Slowly and painfully kill myselfâ¦

All this happens as if not to me,
All this is estranged and absurd,
My mind doesnât perceive reality,
And dips more into the gloom.

Infected with life,
I wait the exodus,
From the wrested veins,
Lost time oozes.
My eyes estranged see the ruins,
Of this dead and lying world.

My glance scans the human faces,
And I see soulless dolls,
They all have two steps to the graves,
Nothing will save their souls.

Deathâs my consolation, my shelter, my cradle,
Of the chain of the meaningless days,
This empty lifeâs like smoldering candle,
And now itâs time to cast a glance deathâs faceâ¦
