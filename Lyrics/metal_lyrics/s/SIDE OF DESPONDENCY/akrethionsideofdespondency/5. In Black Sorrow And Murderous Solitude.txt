[performed by Side of Despondency]Black Sorrow And Murderous Solitude
Thousands of the sleepless nights,
When hopes and dreams has died,
Lonely and crying beast,
Howls in my soul.
Black sorrow enthroned,
In my stone heart,
Murderous solitude
Squeezes the throat.


Iâm drowning in madnessâ¦
Heavy disease is in my veinsâ¦
Dying wheeze in my cry,
My disease is lifeâ¦
Do not save meâ¦
Do not try to cureâ¦
Years of miseries â
In black sorrow and murderous solitudeâ¦
