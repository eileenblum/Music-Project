Drowned starsâ¦
At the dawn sky.
I try to see,
Joy in the new day.
Forlorn slave,
Of cruel reality,
Where no light,
For my black heart.

Under the drops of heavy rain,
I wash my face from bitter tears,
And looking to hateful heaven,
I see only spiteful grin of the lying God.
So measly,
Under the boots of millenniums,
Nothing,, ashes,
Where life itâs dust on roadâ¦

Dead stars,
Without light,
Like and my soul,
Raped and fallen.
World is destroying,
For me and for all,
Itâs time to dieâ¦
Or no? â¦

On the debris of life,
Under sneering skies,
Earth drinking sweet wine,
Oozes from my veins.
Drownedânâdead stars,
Shine in my heart,
By the deep scars,
And wine from blood.
