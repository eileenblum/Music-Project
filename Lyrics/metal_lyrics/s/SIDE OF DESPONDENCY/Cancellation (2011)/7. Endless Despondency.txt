Through neverending fears,
By blood from soul oozes,
I tired my eyes,
I don't want see this life.
And tired a tongue,
I'm not about than speak.
Impaled not beating heart,
Changed to stone in bleed
My hands is broken,
Nothing to give and take,
By legs nowhere to go,
Anybody in nowhere doesn't wait.

Like fading candle's flame,
Like alone proud wolf,
Dying in endless despondency,
In wheezing howl to the moon
To the moon

Broken corpse,
Peace of shit,
Faceless ghost,
In bed of dead.
