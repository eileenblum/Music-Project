Time is lost and broken,
Morbid screams in my ears,
Something, everything, nothing
This is screams of the old fears.

Lost life's pictures,
In my mind slowly die,
Garbled symphonies,
Infuse to ears by lie.
All that at one time it's important,
All that was the most valuable and expensive,
Now causes only nostalgia,
Outgrow to paranoia and schizophrenia.

Time is lost and dead,
With the end of happy days,
Now damp earth it's my bed,
I fall asleep under moon rays

The painfully memories,
In my fevered consciousness,
On pale face with frozen tears,
Under the wall of utter madness,
I try to awaken,
I try to recall,
As all became nothing,
On the grave of my soul+

Time is lost and dead,
With the end of happy days,
Now damp earth it's my bed,
I fall asleep under moon rays
