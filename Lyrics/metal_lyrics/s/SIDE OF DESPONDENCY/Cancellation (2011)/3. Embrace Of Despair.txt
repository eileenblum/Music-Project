Broad road of my life,
Where fear my best friend,
Years of tears in neverending solitude,
Fiction of reflection in broken mirror

I feel light,
On my face,
Under embrace,
Of despair

Like under wings,
Of lying truth
And wrong decisions.
Every day all with beginning,
Every day one and too,
And now all became nothing,
Dust, ash
And I'm alone,
Where all it's nothing..
Nothing
