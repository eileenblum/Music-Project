Uneasiness, hopelessness,
By cold drops on forehead,
Powerless, weakness,
All are toppled from hands.

Sadness, madness,
Four walls of eternal prison,
Lifeless, soulless,
Where dead season only.

With every new mourning,
I open my eyes,
And see a same picture,
And feel all same emptiness

Self-destruction, self-illusion,
No light in the end of subway,
Self-abstraction, self-mutation,
From life to death, what insure and save.

In negation of deep depression,
Defrauding itself that all well,
Reliable protection and right solution - 
9 grams of lead and gun beside temple.

Shadow of death for my back,
Her dead breathe on my face,
I feel her cold hands,
But last that I hear - a shot
