These days black stands for me
not as a colour
but as a penetrating darkness
Thickening as I stare into it.
(Thickening,
The darkness is your
darkness.)
We are nothing but
spirals leading into
each other's hearts-
I no longer know
which one is mine.
As I walk deeper into
this darkness of yours
I feel its
tranquil whispers
painting me in my
one beloved colour
The colour that is you
-your skin, your embrace-
Closes my eyes, leaves me cold
But the light left me blindfolded
and I never felt warm.
We are mere spirals,
unknowingly we lock
ourselves in them
by walking through.
One day you'll realize
that you can't get further
Look backwards, and see-
there's nothing there.
There never was a past.
I'll close your eyes
my breath will leave you cold
I'm the end of the spiral
the one who locks you in
Monochroma.
As I walk deeper into
this darkness of yours
I feel your sadness,
a gentle gust of wind
painting me in my
one beloved colour
The colour that is you
-your skin, your embrace-
How this sadness is my
tragedy-
being the one thing I adore
How can one live with that?
These days black doesn't stand
for me simply as one colour-
but as an inevitable hole
in which I crawl
deeper and deeper.
