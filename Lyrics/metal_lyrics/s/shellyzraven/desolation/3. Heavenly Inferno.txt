I smile, you cry.
I laugh, you close your eyes in pain.
I am your weapon.
You are the open wound.
I seemed to wither.
You saw me vanish.
Leave the inner sanctum.
But darkness survived.
It is yourself you've lost.
With only you to blame.
Your halo is forever broken.
Like the value of your name.
Once I was a mortal.
Now I'm nothing.
Immortality is preserved,
for those with a life.
Blinded for a lifetime.
Then unfolded through the next.
For their innocence and shamefulness,
runs dignity not deep.
She sticks her thorns right at him.
How can I believe in you,
when you believe in lies?
He licks at every precious moment.
Of his last majestic time.
Close.
Only one prophecy away.
Before the rose bloom out.
Just for you.
As for goodness it's a lie.
Just a cloak for my disguise.
The last spark I promised,
was a life without you.
