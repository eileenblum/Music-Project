All I ever gained throughout this life
was to deserve to return.
And we are all immortal until we die.
So if I keep on falling
Will it keep me from hitting the ground?
Are you dead or just out of sight,
when you are not here?
So many ways to be gone,
how can I possibly separate them?
The only thing which differs them, is me.
And so I fell realizing
There was no ground to hit
I don't have a bottom.
I don't even have anything
to hit so hard it would
smash me into pieces
Hit me back into place
-or just anywhere-
So if I keep on falling,
will it keep me from hitting the ground?
And if I keep on dying,
will death keep her distance?
