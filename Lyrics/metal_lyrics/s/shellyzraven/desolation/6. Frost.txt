I should feel purified but there is nothing here.
Like I've been cut up with a razor bladeand found there's no blood in my body.
Only if it dies it will survive so will I.
How long have we been sleeping?
I step outside the realm of time : in the air a distant echo of a voice -mine- have I just been here?
To whom did I talk?
Where did I go?
