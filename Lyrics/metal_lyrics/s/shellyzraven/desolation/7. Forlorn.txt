Fit for nights beauty,
but dreadnought in the day.
Flower in outfit of devil claws.
Forfeit for damage not done.
As forlorn and lost in labyrinth,
where life once existed.
Last minuet to which we danced,
brought closer to nether.
With words that he spoke;
to lure one into the nest.
The forever pith towards him.
Father darkness, mother light!
Whilst you not roam and spread?
Embrace and soothe,
the souls that have fled.
Sweet as the bitter.
Calm as the storm.
Good as the fiendish.
Are the days when we mourn.
