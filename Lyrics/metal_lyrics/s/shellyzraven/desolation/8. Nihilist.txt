We're not lovers. We do not love
-least of all each other-
We meet. Talk. And then we leave again.
You know - they want me - to die.
So I can be reborn. To die! And kill.
We're not exclusive - we do not believe in monogamy - or anything-
We smile. False smiles.
These little substitutes for unification.
How can they agree with me when I believe in nothing?
And they hate.
They claim they cannot love while their eyes get burn scarred by desire.
