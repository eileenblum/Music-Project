A lonely existence free from light.
I sense the coldness in the night.
Fluidless tears down my chin.
I feel enchanted by her skin.
Lady of shadows in me.
Lady of shadows in me.
How I fear your wicked cry,
as life escapes;
within a word.
I see you try,
that magic thing;
on your voyage.
To float forever in an infinite world.
Fated to fail at the end of the fall.
Eschew the narrowness of life,
like a vacant heart.
The hymnic noise,
of your breath.
Like a feather,
you fall while I stand.
I watch.
A solemn look in your eyes;
as you fall.
Lady of shadows in me.
Lady of shadows in me.
I am her world of deceit.
Lady of shadows in me.
