The earthbound spirits arrive.
A Touch Of Callousness strikes my body.
I am losing myself, imprisoned mind.
Deserted thoughts of life in vain.
A spirit speaks to me of love.
I am crying, and there are no tears.
Distant sounds of elemental earth.
Flickering light from a bonfire.
A million needles penetrating skin.
I am drifting away, floating away, fading away.
A spirit speaks to me of hate.
I am bleeding, and there is no blood.
Emptiness surrounding a light in the forest.
The birds will cry no more.
So tired, so cold, and so alone.
Come, come take me away.
A spirit speaks to me of life.
I am dying, and there is no death.
Remembering morning white raindrops.
The sun, the moon and the stars.
The purple haze beneath her eyes.
Enlightens my soul, my existence.
My sweet sister torment speaks to me.
My sweet sister torment.
The dreams I dream, gone forever.
Dance the shadow, walk the night.
I am a walker in the waste.
And I feel nothing anymore.
