Sit down relax yourself
Enjoy the altered state
I make you comfortable
Sedated and so safe
You walk around like puppets
You parrot what you see
Youâre victims of my mind control
Addicted to TV

I am the strongest weapon
Itâs what Iâm designed to be
A tool of propaganda
To mold society
Iâve changed the western nations
Iâve brought them to their knees
With constant bread and circus
We stole their liberty

[Chorus]
Hypnotizing, itâs paralyzing me
Mind Control
Mesmerizing, tantalizing me
Mind Control

Sit back turn on the game
As we rob you blind
As long as that new sit-comâs on
Everything is fine
Iâm here to serve my masters
I do as they demand
I know of my importance
In their New World Order plan

[Chorus]
Hypnotizing, itâs paralyzing me
Mind Control
Mesmerizing, tantalizing me
Mind Control
