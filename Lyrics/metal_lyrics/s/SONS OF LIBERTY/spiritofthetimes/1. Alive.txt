Drifting through this endless maze
I started to fade
Whatâs the meaning of this life?
Much more than to survive
The answers are within
Drowning in sin
Six thousand years of lies
Choking your life

Marching towards the end of days
So, is that your fate?
The choice is there for you to make
So what on Earth will it take?
Where will you draw the line?
And will there be time?
Will you finally break the chains
Enslaving your mind?

[Chorus]
Itâs time to make a stand my friends
Start living for today
Put the fear outside your head and say
Iâm alive and Iâm awake

Polluted frequencies invade
Your solitary space
Disconnecting what was pure
A corrupting silent war
Just open up your eyes
And see through the lies
Put all your fears aside
And now youâre alive

[Chorus]
Itâs time to make a stand my friends
Start living for today
Put the fear outside your head and say
Iâm alive and Iâm awake
