Onward we march
Our throats cracked and dry
If we fall upon their blades
With honor we shall die
Suffer unto me
Xerxes the God-king
Threatening all we love
Sparta is our home

Come and take it!
Bring it on!
In defiance of your tyranny
Sparta will stand strong

To the mouth of hell
The phalanx will deny
Tell your king these men are free
With honor we shall die
With eyes black as night
The Immortals arrive
Behind the wall of Persian dead
The Spartans did deny

[Chorus]
I see the signs
A tyrant on the rise
Will you stand free?
Will you defy?
I see the signs
A tyrant on the rise
Will you fall to your knees?
Will you stand and fight?

[Battle / guitar solo]

Come and take it!
Bring it on!
In defiance of your tyranny
Sparta will stand strong

Wave after wave
Bloodlust in our eyes
Weâve been betrayed
Weâve been outflanked
We dine in hell tonight
No surrender, no retreat
This is the Spartan way
Iâd rather die on my feet
Than grovel on my knees

[Chorus]
I see the signs
A tyrant on the rise
Will you stand free?
Will you defy?
I see the signs
A tyrant on the rise
Will you fall to your knees?
Will you stand and fight?

Come and take it!
Bring it on!
In defiance of your tyranny
Sparta will stand strong
