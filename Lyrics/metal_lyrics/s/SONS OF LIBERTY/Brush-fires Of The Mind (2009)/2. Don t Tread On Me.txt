[Music / Lyrics : Jon Schaffer]

Rising to the challenge is the first step that you take
Are you a free spirit or a slave?
Are the institutions that have molded our minds
Pushing an agenda filled with lies?
Have you ever asked yourself why things never change?
The rhetoric they speak is all the same
The men behind the curtain and the illusion they create
Pull the puppets strings and seal our fate

[Chorus:]
Watch your step around me
I'm trying to live free
Push too far
We will strike, like a snake coiled up in the night

Until we look beyond the throne where the power structure lies
We ll fight amongst ourselves as freedom dies
The only hope for human kind lies in solidarity
The strength in our numbers sets us free

[Chorus]
