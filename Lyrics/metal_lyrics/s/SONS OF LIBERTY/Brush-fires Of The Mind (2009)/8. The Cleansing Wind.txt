[Music / Lyrics : Jon Schaffer]

One with nature, I see what I m meant to be
As the winds wash over me
A chain reaction, I have awakened
To boldly question what I ve been led to believe
My quest for true liberty

[Chorus:]
Cleansing winds have washed over me
And now I m free
I hold the truth and all that it brings
And I will speak

It's time for action, break through the matrix
Restore the vision of life and your liberty
The truth shall set you free
The Constitution, real solutions
We must defend it, whatever the cost may be
The best hope for humanity

[Chorus]
