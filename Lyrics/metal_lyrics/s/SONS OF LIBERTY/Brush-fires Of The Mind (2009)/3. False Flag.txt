[Music / Lyrics : Jon Schaffer]

Never thought I d feel this way
I wanted to believe
The Founders are turning in their graves
At what we've come to be
Tactics that destroy our freedom
And civil liberties
Propagates never ending war
For profit by the elite
Beware
False flag
You can fool people some of the time
But you can t fool me
The Constitution can t defend itself
So you're gunning for guys like me
Well bring it on, we'd prefer it straight!
Instead of lies and deceit!
But be aware that we know you're game
Our numbers you can t defeat
Beware
False flag

[Chorus:]
Where do you think this will lead?
Open your eyes and see
Where do you think this will lead?
They're building a Killing machine

You like to think it can t happen here
Open your eyes and see
Hijacked by a group of thugs
And criminals in D.C.
Don t let them intimidate you
Fear is how they feed
No mater what they throw our way
We must defend liberty
Beware
False flag

[Chorus]

Hail Caesar!
All Hail!
Hail Caesar!
All Hail!
Hail Caesar!
All Hail!
Hail Caesar!
All Hail!
Hail Caesar!
All Hail!
Hail Caesar!
All Hail!
