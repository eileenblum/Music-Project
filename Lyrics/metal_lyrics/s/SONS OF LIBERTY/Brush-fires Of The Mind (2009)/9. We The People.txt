[Music / Lyrics : Jon Schaffer]

We the people must unite
Reject this global scheme
The thought of world governance
And the evil that can bring
The tactic of financial meltdown
The crisis that they need
All the nations of this world
Must defend their sovereignty
This will lead to war and chaos
And the excuse they need
A World Order dictatorship
From their patiently crafted scheme
Corruption! The cancer that destroys us
Placate! They buy then bind us
Enslavement! Is there hope for those who falsely think they're free?
Cowards! They hide in ivory towers
Treason! Committed by the hour
Destruction! Without the Constitution in bondage we will be
We the people
Surround them
Rise up and seize the day!
We the people
Surround them
End the tyrants reign!
We the people
Surround them
Are you free, are you a slave?
We the people
Surround them
Lock 'em down we'll have our way!
Tyrants! Complacency betrays us
Liars! Congress now enslaves us
Fascists! It's what we are now, do you really think you're free?
Power! They can t live and let us be
Terror! It's the tactic that they need
Deceivers! They have destroyed our freedoms and crushed our liberty
We the people
Surround Them
Rise up and seize the day!
We the people
Surround them
End the tyrants reign!
We the people
Surround them
Are you free, are you a slave?
We the people
Surround them
Lock 'em down we'll have our way!
We, we the people
We surround them
Rise up and seize the day!
We the people
We surround them
End the tyrants reign!
We the people
We surround them
Are you free, are you a slave?
We the people
We surround them
Lock 'em down we'll have our way!
