[Music / Lyrics : Jon Schaffer]

All at once I felt tremendous weight
As if my chest was going to cave
The tears that fell left a stain
The world we know's enslaved
I know it s hard to hear
You better heed the words I say
If we don't act as one you ll see
The false prophets will betray

[Chorus:]
Our lives should define freedom
Our lives, to live in our own way
Our lives must define freedom
Or will we let them take it away?

Now awake, I face the task ahead
Will we march into bloodshed?
The Founding Fathers warned us
The coming threat, the web of debt conceals
Where are the Sons of Liberty?
Will the fascists have their way?
If we don't act as one you'll see
The false prophets will betray

[Chorus]

Rise up! To define freedom
Rise up! To live in your own way
Rise up! To define freedom
Or will we let them take it away?
Liberty or tyranny?
It's your choice to make
