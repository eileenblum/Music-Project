[Music / Lyrics : Jon Schaffer]

And as the weaving spiders
Spin their web of debt
Across the globe
The victims of deception will be met
Awaken now and reclaim what's yours
Your freedom is at stake
It's time to bite the hand that feeds
Before they seal our fate

[Chorus:]
I see a time when the sovereign states will die
And what that means to me and you
From the guise of a massive global lie
We are the pawns of indentured servitude

Awaken from the slumber
The matrix you call life
The system is a travesty
The world order lies
The only hope lies in our consensus
Not of left or right
Sever the ties of blind loyalty
And see what's in plain sight

[Chorus]
