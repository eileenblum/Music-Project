It's been said before
But nothing has been done
Disarm every bomb
Unload every gun

Voices in the street
Voicing public fears
Behind a mask of peace
It falls on deaf ears

Sad but true

Peacekeeping force
Armed to the teeth
Taking human life
Spreading blood and grief

Take a chance
Take a stand
The time has come
We must demand a change
