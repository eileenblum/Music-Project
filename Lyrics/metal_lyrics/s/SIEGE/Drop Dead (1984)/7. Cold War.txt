They have the power
To rule the land
They have the power
To rule with an iron hand
They have the power
But the mind of man

They have the power
To stock and deploy
They have the power
To seek and destroy
They have the power
To play with their toys

They have the power
The responsibility
They have the power
To end humanity

End gunboat diplomacy
Cold war
Fix the foreign policy
Cold war
Disarm the device
Cold war
Break the ice of cold war
