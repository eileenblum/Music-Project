Monkey see
Monkey do
Monkey has low I.Q.

Copycat, conform, contort
For the sake of your comfort
Don't dare ask questions
Just accept - blend in

Bunch of fucking mindless goons
Listen to the same old tunes
Look at me, call me strange
Haven't got the balls to change

Have no mind of your own
Just another zombie clone
Slave of the majority
No individuality

Dress the same, be accepted
Your true self might be rejected
Afraid to try something new
Afraid of what others think of you
