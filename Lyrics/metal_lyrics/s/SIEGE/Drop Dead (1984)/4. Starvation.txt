No food here to find
Walking skeletons stand in line
For insects in a bowl of wheat
Stillborn babies never eat

Starvation

Flies attracted to the killed
Swollen stomachs never filled
Skin stretched out over bone
Starving children don't stand alone

Starvation

Leaders of this place
Running in the arms race
Buy the bombs and starve the nation
Thousands dying of starvation

Starvation
