Doctor laid a doosie
On my head today
Cancer eating my lung tissue away

At night I lock the door to my room
Fear the grim reaper will come
To call on me soon

Dark shadow cast over me
Turn around - what the fuck do I see
Thousands lying dead
Grim reaper chopping off people's heads

Can't run can't hide
Bony fingers clutch my spine
Skull face swing a scythe
Oh God I want to live
