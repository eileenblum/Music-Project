Lost my guiding light.
Left alone in the dark.
Lost inside my insanity.
Left, never to be found.

Hear I now stand upon the mountain.
As so many times in the past.
Same are the thoughts in my mind.
Over and over, never-ending pain.
So many years have passed me by.
Still it only seems like yesterday.
The unanswered question, still it remains.
Why were you taken away from me?

In a deeper kind of slumber I have been.
Trying to hide away from the truth.
We will never share the same path again.
Damned I will be forever in eternity.
There is no strength left in me to fight.
I cannot dream the dream no more.
Only one way to go, this I now know.
Never to return, these are my last words.
