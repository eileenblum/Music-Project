You came into my life, webbed me in your lies.
Blinded by your light, your beauty I only saw.
Enchanted and lost, I failed to see the truth.
Too late I realised, what you really were.
Rotten to the core, draining me of life.
Never got your fill, kept on trying for more.

"Never will I bow to you
Standing tall I keep my pride
Never will I be your slave
I have the strength to fight you
Never will you see me break
I am stronger then you thought
Never will you win the game
I have already won it all"

Battle of the minds, you better realise.
The power you once held, now gone from my mind.
Freedom was won, your lies I saw through.
I am not someone who will tolerate your kind.
I am leaving you behind, not even a memory.
Worth nothing else to me, gone from life's history.
