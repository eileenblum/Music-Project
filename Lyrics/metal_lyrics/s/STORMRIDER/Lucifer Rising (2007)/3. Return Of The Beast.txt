Felt so down and depressed,
nothing meant anything at all.
Walked around in the shadows,
just as empty as a shell.

"Rising up from deep inside of me,
feel the strength washing over me.
Flame of hate is reaching higher,
feel the heat burning inside of me."

I realised far too late,
lost everything that once was me.
Forgotten for much too long,
now I must feed the beast inside.

It is on the rise again,
I can hear it call my name.
Blinding rage is the fuel,
for blood I now lust again.

Growing stronger then before,
not afraid to lose control.
I will rather burn alive,
there is no life without hate
