Feel the fear as the day turns into night.
You try to run, you try to flee away from fate.
Terror rules your every thought, frozen mind.
Time has come for all of you to face the end.
There is no escape from this hell, death is here.
Nuclear war is the answer, total holocaust.
The last you see is blinding light, darkness falls.
Eradication of the disease called mankind.

"Burn them alive!
No one will survive!
I laugh as they die!
Total Extinction!"

Napalm rains from the skies, storm of pain.
Screams of agony fills the night.
I can smell your burning flesh, sweet incense.
As you burn I thrive upon your suffering.
