Child of god has failed,
age of lies has died.
Tides of time will end,
age of chaos will reign.

"It is the final end.
You'll all be crucified.
Soil drenched in human blood.
Creation in reverse."

Hear the screams of mankind,
withering into dust.
Judgement is totally blind,
no mercy will be shown.

I have seen it all before,
in the greatest plan of them all.
I was born for this purpose,
to undo heavens' creation.

As long as my life goes on,
the world will live forever.
But when my time has come,
Jesus Christ dismemberized.
