Outcast since the day I was born
never belonged to this world
Walked alone in the shadows
tried to find a reason
A voice in my head spoke to me;
"Seek the knowledge of mankind, my son"

The other side
calling me
I must leave
everything behind
Life is not for me
the other side

Ancient knowledge was shown to me
closed myself to this world
Walked alone in the shadows
I had found a reason
The voice spoke to me again;
"It is your fate, obey your destiny."

Spreading everything I had learned
opened myself to this world
Walked alone in the shadows
I had lost the reason
The voice spoke to me one final time;
"Your work is done, time for you to die."
