You better run and hide
he is on the lose again
Thirsting for blood
hunting his pray

Stalking the night
a victim in sight
No chance to survive
you're as good as dead

He can taste your fear
see your pain
In agony you die!

Blood will flow tonight
in his hate you drown
He is a killer
dead to the world

You turn around
in horror you see
he is coming for you
There is no reason why!
