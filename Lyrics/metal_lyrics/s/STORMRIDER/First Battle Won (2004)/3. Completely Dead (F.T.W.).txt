Fuck The World - I will never be your slave
Fuck The World - I will never sell my soul
Fuck The World - I will never be like you
Fuck The World -I will never sell myself

My world has always been dark
yet in honour I've always believed
Look upon mankind and it's creed
I am disgusted beyond belief
Values have been replaced
by hypocrisy
It is clear to me now
my world has always been dead

My hate for the world is blind
for what it is
for what it has become
for what it never was
It is hard to believe
that my truth was a lie
The dream was my life
why am I still alive...?
