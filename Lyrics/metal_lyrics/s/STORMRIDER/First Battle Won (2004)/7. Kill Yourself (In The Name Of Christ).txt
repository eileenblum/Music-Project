Of pain and suffering
everything was created

Forget about life
forget about everything you are
There is no god
that will help you be a star
You are a loser
you must suffer for the crucified god

Feel the pain, feel the guilt
Kill yourself in the name of Christ!

Deny yourself
deny your every thought
There is no sin
that will stand in your way
Help yourself
do what thou wilt and that shalt be the law
