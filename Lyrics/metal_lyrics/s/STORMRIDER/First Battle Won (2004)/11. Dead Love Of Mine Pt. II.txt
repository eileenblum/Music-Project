When she fell from my side
I could not even cry
Anger and frustration
suicidal mind
Blinded by rage uncontrolled
crying my stained tears of hate
In the night I forever walked
did not care about the world no more

I fell deep inside myself
nothing made sense anymore
Insanity and depression
I had to find a way
To see you once again
that was my only goal
For love I damned my soul
forever I'll live with this pain

Now I am the one...
Hiding in my mind...
Trying to forget...
That I was left behind...

So many years has passed me by
I lost track of time
Anguish and aggression
suicidal mind
Memories still haunt my dreams
blaming myself for not being there
The path of damnation I walk upon
oblivion I seek forever more

Now I am the one...
Hiding in my mind...
Trying to forget...
I should have died...with you!
