The war has just begun
from the grave we have come
Risen to bring destruction
upon all things God created
The glory shalt be won
your kingdom will crumble
Our paradise shalt reign supreme!

Demons arise
Angels cry
Demons vengeance
Angels bleed
Demons Hatred
Angels die
Battle to death
Burning the heavens

Slaughtering of Christians
the blood shalt set us free
With axes and with swords
we are storming heaven's walls
We are calling out
to all riders of the storm
Stormrider reigns supreme

Together we stand
Together we fight
Brothers in arms
United we are
Soldiers of the storm
Burning the Heavens!
