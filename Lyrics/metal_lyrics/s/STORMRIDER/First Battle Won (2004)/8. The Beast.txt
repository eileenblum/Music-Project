It is on the rise
I can feel the heat
Hatred clouds my eyes
desire to set it free?
To remain in control
will tear my soul apart
There is no way back
forever lost in silence

The beast within
calling my name
Please set it free
set me free!

Darkness clouds my eyes
I am breathing heavy
I scream to heaven;
"Look at your creation"
I have lost all control
strength of the unknown
It will be the end of me
why do I fight it?
