I've heard that speed is what we are looking for. 
I've heard it's speed and so much more. 
Yeah i've got time, 
and sometimes is never enough. 
I've heard that speed is what we are looking for. 
I've heard it's speed and so much more. 
You're broke, 
you're broken, 
you're a broken mirror. 
Something tells me speed is what we're looking for. 
You've been breaking up, 
you've been breaking up forever.
