I can wait here all day. 
You got me. You get me. I've got you. 
Because this train is going nowhere real fast. 
Now it's time to push me aside for something better. 
You're always right. 
Confide in anything that makes it better. 
Who's next in line. 
I've lost it oh alright. 
My pockets are inside out. 
My name is fucked. 
Double your credit. 
My name is fucked. 
Reno and blood. 
Because that's what matters. 
Reno.
