Come see what's so new. 
Hold me down. 
Come hear what I say to you. 
Hold me down. 
Nothing gets past you. 
Just say it out loud. 
I've got what you need. 
Goddamn these eyes aren't seeing right. 
I can't sit still. 
With a smile to kill. 
Just hold me down. 
I can't sit still. 
Hold me down. 
Everything gets past me. 
Just say it out loud. 
I've got what you need. 
Goddamn these eyes aren't seeign right. 
Nothing gets through you. 
Goddamn these eyes aren't seeing right. 
You burn me up.
