Living life like there's no tomorrow
Take the day just as it is
Full of love despite the sorrow
Nothing more than just this

I spend my time down in Death Valley
And I live and I die down in Death Valley

Time, it always slips away
Getting closer every day

Moving on into the Bardo
Everything is like a dream
Looking for a woman to borrow
Right back into the stream

I spend my time down in Death Valley
And I live and I die down in Death Valley

Time, it always slips away
Getting closer every day

As long as time and space abide
For as long as we shall live
Until then may I too remain
To dispel the miseries of this world

I spend my time down in Death Valley
And I live and I die down in Death Valley

Time, it always slips away
Getting closer every day
