Good times now are here to stay
All our cares have gone away
Here to feel the energy
Congregation, you and me

Plug in, turn up
Lose ourselves tonight
Know you, know me
All as one tonight

Lead us to salvation
Lead us to salvation

Awash in positivity
It is clear for all to see
Love will always be the way
Our time is now, we're here to say

Plug in, turn up
Lose ourselves tonight
Know you, know me
All as one tonight

Lead us to salvation
Lead us to salvation

Awash in positivity
It is clear for all to see
Love will always be the way
Our time is now, we're here to say

Plug in, turn up
Lose ourselves tonight
Know you, know me
All as one tonight

Lead us to salvation
Lead us to salvation
