Pitting one against the other
Stoking the flames to divide
Building a wall between self and others
Having to choose just one side
Focus on things that don't matter
Turn a blind eye to the truth
An endless stream of worthless chatter
Mindless diversion no use

Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer

Race, religion, color or nation
Reasons to kill, take your pick
A history of self-immolation
Amazing that we still exist
Fueling the fire with disinformation
Ignorance and fear reign supreme
Filling others with only distrust
Shattering all of our dreams

Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer

This is how it's always been done
More dangerous words don't exist
You'd think by now we'd have learned our lesson
But still the condition persists
Divided we fall, our power diminished
Far easier to control
The few again have conquered the masses
A story that's centuries old

Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer

Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer
