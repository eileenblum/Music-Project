How do we live? Are we filled with frustration?
At every turn is it aggravation?
Is every day a test of our patience?

Buying in to their vision
Just a cog in the corporate system
Sowing the seeds of our own destruction

Live your life with no explanation
Every moment a celebration
Spending your time in positive vibration

Keep the P.M.A. despite all of it
Don't give up, we'll overcome this shit
Speak truth to power and realize
There's more of us than them
It's time for revolution

On the TV is the news of division
When they're not selling their latest invention
Three easy payments plus terms and conditions

Selling us out in the halls of the Hill
Pumping us full of toxins and pills
Don't give a fuck how many are killed

Live your life with no explanation
Every moment a celebration
Spending your time in positive vibration

Keep the P.M.A. despite all of it
Don't give up, we'll overcome this shit
Speak truth to power and realize
There's more of us than them
It's time for revolution

Elected officials all up for sale
Wall Street bankers too big to fail
We should toss them right into jail

Fox propaganda and blatant-faced lies
Pushing their bullshit with no compromise
Stealing our future in front of our eyes

Live your life with no explanation
Every moment a celebration
Spending your time in positive vibration

Keep the P.M.A. despite all of it
Don't give up, we'll overcome this shit
Speak truth to power and realize
There's more of us than them
It's time for revolution
