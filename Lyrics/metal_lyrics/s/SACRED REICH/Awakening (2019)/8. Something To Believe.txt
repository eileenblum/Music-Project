When I look around
Nothing to be found
Nothing that seems real
Nothing I can feel

Give me something to believe
Give me something I can see
Give me something to believe

Waking every day
Everything's the same
Living the routine
Stuck inside this dream

Give me something to believe
Give me something I can see
Give me something to believe

It is plain to see
Compassion is the key
Love is the only way
To live our life each day

Give me something to believe
Give me something I can see
Give me something to believe

Give me something to believe
Give me something I can see
Give me something to believe
