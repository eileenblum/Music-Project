Johnny got his gun and a uniform when he was signed up to defend the flag
He loved his country so much, they sent him off to fight in a foreign land
It was just another day in a war of many days when his unit was hit
They gave his mom a medal and a flag and said that they would pray for him

Bodies for the killing machine
Souls for the killing machine
Fuel for the killing machine
Your life for the killing machine

Annie signed up to serve, see the world from a ship like her dear old dad
Do her time, get some money, go to college, it was a sound and responsible plan
One day aboard the ship, far away, they were having lunch in the mess
The papers said she was one of seventeen that were killed in the blast

Bodies for the killing machine
Souls for the killing machine
Fuel for the killing machine
Your life for the killing machine

Victor's parents came across the border and they worked hard every day
They had a dream to make a better life for their family in the USA
They were proud the day that he enlisted and put on the uniform
His mother cried and fell to the floor when she saw who was at her door

Bodies for the killing machine
Souls for the killing machine
Fuel for the killing machine
Your life for the killing machine
