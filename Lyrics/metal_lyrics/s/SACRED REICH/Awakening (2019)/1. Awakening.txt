Deep inside
In my vine
I found the light
Horny trails
Empty trails
Now it's the time

Lifting
Rising
Awakening
Leaving
Dieing
Awakening

Be on space
Be on time
Finding bless
Into the vine
Into the hearts
Into the true

Lifting
Rising
Awakening
Leaving
Dieing
Awakening

Living in a thoughts
Where the enemys dead
I lost my way
Now the sunshine bright
And the bloods is sing
Awakening

Leaving
Dieing
Awakening
