Close your eyes and take a breath
Just sit and be yourself
Everything that's of the mind
Nothing exists, swim inside
When I was young, I had the chance to roam
Now I know what to know is in myself
Need to start to seize the day
It's up to us, there is no other way

Teachers of age, show us the way
It's up to us to practice every day
Look for answers near and far
You are perfect just the way you are
So do your best, do no harm
Rid your mindset of bad thoughts
Hatred and anger are burning coals
Don't hang on, you have to let go

Be the change you wanna see
Manifest reality
Be the change you wanna see
Manifest reality

See the signs, you know the truth
Let your light come shining through
All these things that we know
We have to be, we have to show
Putting others before ourselves
There is no limit to whom we help
We the love that we share
That we spread everywhere

Be the change you wanna see
Manifest reality
Be the change you wanna see
Manifest reality
