What is this lie there is no truth
There is no God there is no proof
They say there is a higher beeing
He was crucified, torn and bleeding

The Bible is a lie
I defy the lying priest
God doesn't control my life
I choose me own destiny
Religion is for the weak
Your soul will die forever
Get up off your knees
There's no God in heaven

What is God, imagination
A symbol of lies and frustration
Your saviour Jesus was lost
When he was nailed to the cross

The Bible is a lie
I defy the lying priest
God doesn't control my life
I choose me own destiny
Religion is for the weak
Your soul will die forever
Get up off your knees
There's no God in heaven

Screaming prophets
Screaming prophets control your mind
Fake messiah
Fake messiah bathed in lies
Devour Christians
Devour Christians see the light
Do not question
Do not question God is right

Millions of Christians accept in their heart
Their saviour is Jesus have faith in the cross
There is no truth to the holy cross
But millions follow millions are lost

The Bible is a lie
I defy the lying priest
God doesn't control my life
I choose me own destiny
Religion is for the weak
Your soul will die forever
Get up off your knees
There's no God in heaven
