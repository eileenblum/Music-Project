Comformity training center
Seas of mindless brain dead kids
Wandering lost forever
What an education is

Don't speak out, don't make waves
You get an education free
Just play along with our games
This system just ain't right for me

Faculty not ready to accept our needs
Schools geared to what parents want to see
Knowledge comes second to doing what you're told
We deny you exist we have an image to uphold

Obedient little classes
In this fascist little high school world
Encouraging apathy
Get involved and you'll get burned

Student council chosen
To meet the wishes, student needs
Principal with veto power
Sees these wishes meet defeat

Faculty not ready to accept our needs
Schools geared to what parents want to see
Knowledge comes second to doing what you're told
We deny you exist we have an image to uphold

Graduate or be cast out
You can't fit in there is no doubt
Just go get your GED
'Cause high school ain't right for me

What a shame you almost passed
Sorry though you could not be last
You have no chance to succeed
Fuck you all, just watch and see

Faculty not ready to accept our needs
Schools geared to what parents want to see
Knowledge comes second to doing what you're told
We deny you exist we have an image to uphold

[Dedicated to Coronado High and the class of '87]
