Afraid to close your eyes
Too scared of what you'll see
The nightmares, blood, the horror
but it's just a dream
You know it's not for real
It's only in your head
Now lying down to sleep
Why do you feel so close to death

Terror in the night
Not as real as it seems
He's come to take your life
Awakened by your screams
Terror in the night
Not as real as it seems
He's come to take your life
No longer rest in peace

Is he real or fantasy
He infiltrates your brain
He knows your darkest fears
You know it's driving you insane
Attacking when you least expect
In the dead of the night
A grotesque sight of rotting flesh
Awakened by your cries

Terror in the night
Not as real as it seems
He's come to take your life
Awakened by your screams
Terror in the night
Not as real as it seems
He's come to take your life
No longer rest in peace

You hear his voice, you try to run
He sees your every step
He's right behind and with his knife
He 'll R.I.P. you to your death
He comes for you, you cannot hide
He wields his bloody knife
It R.I.P.s your skin, slashes your face
Tonight he ends your life

Lying in your own cold sweat
It's just a dream of death
He's not for real you're still alive
What are the bloodstains on your bed
Remove the sheets to reveal
A body torn and scarred
Confused and scared a dream come true
His laughter from the dark
Your worst nightmare realized
He's made of bones and flesh
Not haunts you in your sleep
He's real as is your death

Terror in the night
Not as real as it seems
He's come to take your life
Awakened by your screams
Terror in the night
Not as real as it seems
He's come to take your life
No longer rest in peace
