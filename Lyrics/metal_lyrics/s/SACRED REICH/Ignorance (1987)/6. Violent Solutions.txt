Lurking in the shadows
Hidden from the light
Admist the degredation
His thirst for blood arise
The quest for carnal pleasures
The growing need for flesh
Senseless brutal beatings
Phsycotic lust is fed

Maliciously tortured ripped to shreds
Innocent victims killed by death
Frenzied thrashings dreched in blood
Fleeting screams you have succumb

Up from wretched alleys
Strewn with shards of glass
Burning eyes of hatred
All sign of life be gone
Mission maim, destruction
Mauled and scarred to death
Return to darkened alleys
To rise and kill again

Maliciously tortured ripped to shreds
Innocent victims killed by death
Frenzied thrashings dreched in blood
Fleeting screams you have succumb

Cast into poverty
To live amongst the dead
Skid row life of hoplessness
Fuels hatred of mankind
Release of cruel emotions
Takes from homicide
No answer to his question
Violent solutions abide

Maliciously tortured ripped to shreds
Innocent victims killed by death
Frenzied thrashings dreched in blood
Fleeting screams you have succumb
