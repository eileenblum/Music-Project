Putting to dead those who oppose you
Will take control, no matter the cost
Bodies are mounting the carnage around you
At the last count, 10.000 have died

Taken by force
Controlled by fear
Death squad police of the right
Must stamp out subversion
Dissention, unrest
Those who oppose will meet death

Automatic weapons in hand
You say you're what the police want
Why must you kill them to secure their vote
Death squad escort them to the polls

Puppet regime with you at the head
You've rid them of a communist threat
Your brand of "democracy" is now in control
And all of your people lie dead

Taken by force
Controlled by fear
Death squad police of the right
Must stamp out subversion
Dissention, unrest
Those who oppose will meet death

"Democracy" at any cost
The methods of freedom unclear
Right-wing radicals, abusing control
The choice will be democracy of death
