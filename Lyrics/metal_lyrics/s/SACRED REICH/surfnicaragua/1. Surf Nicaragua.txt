[Lyrics: Phil]
[Music: Phil]

I know a place
Where you're all going to go
They'll pay you to kill
If You're eighteen years old
First You'll need a haircut
And then some new clothes
They'll stick you in a jungle
To play G.I. Joe

[CHORUS:]

You fight for democracy
And the "American Way"
But you're not in your country
"What am I doing here?" you say
But now it's too late
You're entering Managua
If you had brought your surfboard
You could surf Nicaragua

What is this we're fighting for
What's our ultimate goal
To force our ideas
Right down their throats
American Intervention
Grows Deeper Everyday
The situation worsens
More soldiers on the way

[CHORUS:]

You fight for democracy
And the "American Way"
But you're not in your country
"What am I doing here?" you say
But now it's too late
You're entering Managua
If you had brought your surfboard
You could surf Nicaragua

Lessons we have learned
Are easy to forget
Hints of viet-nam
How soon we all forget
First we send advisors
And then go the troops
Another worthless conflict
Another Chance to lose

[CHORUS:]

You fight for democracy
And the "American Way"
But you're not in your country
"What am I doing here?" you say
But now it's too late
You're entering Managua
If you had brought your surfboard
You could surf Nicaragua
