[Lyrics: Phil]
[Music: Phil and Wiley]

A vision of unselfishness
A union of black and white
One nation of all races
It's clear within my sight
I see it clear, no hate, no fear
No soldiers sent to die
A state that's free, and thrives on peace
No greed, no threat to life
We will not build the weapons of war
Which loom over your heads
We will not feed the war machine
Which leads our youth to death
We will not close our eyes
To the atrocities which abound
We will not stand and watch
Until we're six feet underground

[CHORUS:]
The future is our burden
We cannot stand and watch
As the world around us crumbles
And opposing armies march
We will work towards our goal
One nation unity
And you must be the converts
Who work towards world peace

There are those around us
Who stand and say no way
Opposing lessened armies
They are here to stay
But no one knows until we try
What we all can do
I won't stand by, watch children die
It's up to me and you
Our world is divided
The boundaries have been drawn
Your ideas are decided
By where you have been born
We can't judge people
By the government of their land
They're flesh and blood like us

[CHORUS:]

[CHORUS:]
The future is our burden
We cannot stand and watch
As the world around us crumbles
And opposing armies march
We will work towards our goal
One nation unity
And you must be the converts
Who work towards world peace
