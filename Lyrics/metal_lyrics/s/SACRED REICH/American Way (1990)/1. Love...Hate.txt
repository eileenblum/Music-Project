In a world so big and cold you seem so all alone then someone enters
your life and makes it all seem right sometimes things do change love
turns to bitter rage and you say "Never again" but emotions always
mend
It's the root of all disharmony but it's the need to feel complete it's a
physical attraction a chemical reaction a walking contradiction a push,
pull affliction it's a love...hate relationship
You can see it in our band we're all so different every solution we
come to starts with an argument but through adversity the music's in our
heart we'll stay together you can't tear us apart
It's the root of all disharmony but it's the need to feel complete it's a
physical attraction a chemical reaction a walking contradiction a push,
pull affliction it's a love...hate relationship
Love...hate is it one in the same I can't differentiate between love and
hate love...hate is it one in the same I can't differentiate between love
and hate I hate to love, I love to hate you love and hate is it one in the
same love...hate
We always take for granted the one's that love we think they'll always
be there and we treat them as such but if we really make an effort to
show them that we care our love will shine through and the hate will
disappear
It's the root of all disharmony but it's the need to feel complete it's a
physical attraction a chemical reaction a walking contradiction a push,
pull affliction it's a love...hate relationship
