Jonny can you hear me turn that music down You're making too much
noise I mean it do it now all that stuff is evil Ozzy, Judas Priest there's
backwards messages in that stuff that leads you to the beast
Jonny don't you hear me open up that door I've been calling you for hours
I won't say it anymore just wait until your dad gets home and sees what
you have done kicked out of school you've got no job you're a useless
delinquent bum oh my god it's Jonny hanging by his neck all those metal
albums have led him to his death
Now it's time for parents to open ears and listen maybe it's too late to see
what you've been missing music is no cause of death it's you that
suffocates if you had opened your eyes and ears you'd see just who's to
blame
Who's to be responsible for a life that's gone off track who's the one who
must be there to see it gets put back where were you to hear the cries of a
person in need were you there to see the signs or were you too busy
Now it's time for parents to open ears and listen maybe it's too late to see

must be there to see it gets put back where were you to hear the cries of a
person in need were you there to see the signs or were you too busy
Who's the cause, who's the blame for a life that's not worth living is it
parents, family who take without giving so next time that you close your
eyes and choose to shift the blame remember you can save a life so really
who's to blame?!
