We knew your reputation we hoped that things could be different but
you just proved us wrong and now you're up to your same old tricks I
guess we learned a lesson that people don't change overnight things will
work out well with a little hard work it'll be alright
How could we be so foolish to rush head first, without a thought I guess
it goes to show if your unprepared you will be caught but now we've
learned a lesson a lesson which we won't forget with our newfound
wisdom things'll work out in the end
This is the way it is not how things should be this is the way it is this is
reality
This is the way it is not how things should be this is the way it is this is
reality
You seemed so sincere we'd work together it'd be lot's of fun but all
you saw was money it's not the issue 'til the music's done to you it's
doing business to us it's doing what we love we'll just do our thing we
won't give in for a buck
This is the way it is not how things should be this is the way it is this is
reality
This is the way it is not how things should be this is the way it is this is
reality
Like a soul attaining heaven we must ascend to greater heights got to
make a change got to make a change, the time is right now I wish you
well and thank you for what you've done for me to quote you "Mr.
Businessman" there's things in life that aren't free
This is the way it is not how things should be this is the way it is this is
reality
This is the way it is not how things should be this is the way it is this is
Reality
