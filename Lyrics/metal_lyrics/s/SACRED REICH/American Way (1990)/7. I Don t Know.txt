I don't know what you think I don't know what you want me to be I don't
know how you want me to act I've fallen into another trap
I don't know what you want me to be I can't change I can only be me I
won't fit into your classifications I won't be tagged by restricting labels
I can't fit into your classifications a nice little package for media
conversation I don't know what you want I won't change or play a part
I don't know what you want me to be I can't change I can only be me I
won't fit into your classifications I won't be tagged by restricting labels
I don't know what you think I don't know what you want me to be I don't
know how you want me to act I've fallen into another trap
I don't know what you want me to be I can't change I can only be me I
won't fit into your classifications I won't be tagged by restricting labels
