Toxins, pollutants and poisonous gasses without notice take their toll on
the masses air becomes thicker than the water we drink people unaware
of the spread of disease smoke fills the sky and the sun disappears rain
from above is like acid filled tears the fragile balance of sky and earth
has been altered forever harmony disturbed
Towering temples of modernization megatropolis monument to
civilization pollution and waste is direct indication to the growing
problem of the world's situation smoke fills the sky the sun disappears
rain from above is like acid filled tears the fragile balance of sky and
earth has been altered forever harmony disturbed
What will it take to make us see these are crimes against humanity not
only you, not only me but even our future society these are crimes against
humanity
Pain and suffering are what can be found violence and hatred are what
abound building the weapons that we can't use can't we see they have
only one use we need more compassion not more war planes are we so
blind uncaring insane brought into this world with nothing and with
nothing we're destined to depart
What will it take to make us see these are crimes against humanity not
only you, not only me but even our future society these are crimes against
humanity
Crimes against humanity
