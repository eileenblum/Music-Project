Jailed and beaten left to die political prisoners of apartheid youth of the
nation violently oppressed in the quest for freedom thousands dead
How can we let this be in their country they must be free when will
segration end when will the masses be free again
I can't concieve of this injustice I can't believe it's going on white man's
law is held supreme black man have no rights at all
How can we let this be in their country they must be free when will
segration end when will the masses be free again
In this age let's have harmony all people can be free this injustice must
now end the masses will be free again
How can we let this be in their country they must be free when will
segration end when will the masses be free again
