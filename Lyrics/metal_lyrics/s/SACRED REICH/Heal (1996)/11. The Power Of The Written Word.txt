Take the chance to manipulate
Thier truth is simply what they create
They'll put words inside you mouth
Have no chance to spit them out

What you read
What you see
What you think
Form their thought
From their view
From their ink

Opinions expressed are their views
Colored versions of the truth
It is fine to say what you think
Why belive every word you read

What you read
What you see
What you think
from their thought
From their view
From their ink

Don't belive a word they say
you know it never could be true
Anything they do or say is onlymeant
to mislead you
Don't belive a word they say
They're only trying to get control of you

Take the chance to manipulate
Their truch is simply what they create
They'll put words inside you mouth
Have no chance to spit them out

What you read
What you see
What you think
From their thought
From their view
From their ink
