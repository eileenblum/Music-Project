I remember, every word you said
I'll remember all until my dying day
I can't forget just what you said meant
But I'll try my best still anyway

Every promise broken I remember
Don't ever think I don't
Can't forgive can't forget
While I try to heal my wounds

I remember like it was yesterday
All my days were filled with joy
Then you came in lie a black cloud
And my happiness was destroyed

Every promise broken I remember
Don't ever think I dont
Can't forgive can't forget
While I try to heal my wounds

Can't forgive can't forget
I know I will go on
How could I be too blind to see
That you had just led me on
Now you are gone but i can touch
These wounds that I can feel
It's another time in life
My old wounds have healed

That was then and this is now
And those things are now in the past
And I know no matter what
Some things weren't meant to last

Ever promise broken I remember
Don't ever think I don't
Can't forgive can't forget
While I try to heal my wounds

Can't forgive can't forget
I know I will go on
How could I bee too blind to see
That you had just led me on
Now you are gone but I can touch
These wounds that I can feel
Its another time in life
My old wounds have healed
