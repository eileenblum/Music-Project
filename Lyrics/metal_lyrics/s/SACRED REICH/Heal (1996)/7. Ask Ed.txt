I remember back in school days
On the way we'd duck into the alleyway
What'd we know we were just kids
Bust out and take a few hits oh yeah

What's the matter ain't doing no harm
No trouble ain't doing nothing wrong
I though we were supposed to be free
Just hanging out gonna smoke a little weed

Just trying to set my mind free
You know just tryin to be me
Hey man don't pay me no mind
Just kicking back gonna get real high

Yeah tired of hipocrasy can't you even see
I know I'm not losing my mind
Just trying to have a good time yeah

I want to alter my concious state
Everybody has their own way
You know every know and then
Just want to party with a couple of
freinds oh yeah

Just trying to set my mind free
Big bird's hangng out with me
Hey man don't pay me no mind
Just kicking back gonna get real high

Yeah tired of hipocrasy can't you even see
I know I'm not losing my mind
Just trying to have a good time yeah

Sometime I like to kick back
Hit the fridge have a little snack
Grab the paper see whats on the tube
Stretch out and smoke a fat dube

Be cool when you come to AZ
Headquarters is the happening scene
Hook up with some killer green
When you lite it up pass it to me oh yeah

Just trying to set my mind free
You know I'm just trying to be me
Hey man don't pay me no mind
Just kicking back gonna get real high

Yeah I'm tired of hipocrasy can't
you even see
I know I'm not losing my mind
Just trying to have a good time yea!
