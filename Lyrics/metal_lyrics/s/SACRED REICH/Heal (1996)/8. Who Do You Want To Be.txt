Who do you want to be today
Who do you want to be
Who do you want to be today
Do you wann be just like somone on T.V.
Oh boredom is so horrible it's like a dread
disease Nothing could be worse when there's
nothing on T.V. I'd rahter be a cowboy than
to stare blank at the walls
Ive been reborn so many times
I can't remember them all
(And I Say)
Who do you want to be today
Who do you want to be
Who do you want to be today
Do you want to be just like someone on T.V.
Just like somebody on T.V.
I think I'll be a teddy boy, I think I'll be
a hunk I think I'll be a tough guy and I think
I'll be a punk might just be a fashion star all dresses in frilly rags
Or perhaps I'll cross the other side and walk around in drag!
Who do you want to be today
Who do you want to be
Who do you want to be today
Do you want to be just like some one on T.V.
Just like somebody on T.V.!
Do you like to be a rock in the middle
of the sea Do you want to suffer by
youself in a pool of blissful misery
Do you want to feel like a saint in
artist's clothes with rosary in you hand
do you want to be crazy like Van Gogh
like a stranger in a
Strange, strange land
Would you rather push the
buttons and be feared by all humanity
Or perhaps you'd like to be a bum
do you wanna be stupid
Just like me!
Who do you want to be today
Who do you want to be
Who do you want to be today
Do you want to be just like someone on T.V.
Just like somebody on T.V.!
Who do you want to be....
