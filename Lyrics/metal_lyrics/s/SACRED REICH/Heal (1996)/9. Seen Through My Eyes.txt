In this life there is no truth
When you search for middle ground
You willfind no absoloutes

In your search for black and white
You'll find that things fall to the shadows
This is where your answers lie

But for this ain't enough
You just have to keep on pushing
Man your life will be real tough

Seen through my eyes

Idealism clings to you
You know the answers out there
somewhere
Cut the lies and find the truth

It's a lonley road you walk
When you decide to take the high road
Find alot of people bought

But my hat comes off to you
Gettin up every day
After all that you've been through

Seen through my eyes

In this life there is no truth
When you search for middle ground
You will find no absolutes

It's a lonley road you walk
When you decide to take the high road
Find alot of people bought

But my hat goes off to you
Getting up every day
After all that you've been through

Seen through my eyes

Idealism clings to you
You know the answer's
out there somewhere
Cut the lies to find the truth
