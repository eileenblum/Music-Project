I'm feeling low
How I got here I'll never know
My heads a mess
This building hopelessness

I'm feeling low

Caught in a grip of emptiness
I can't escape
This darkness drags me down
And tries to consume me

I'm feeling low
How much farther can I go
I feel the end
One step away from death

I'm feeling low

Why do I feel this way
Never felt so victimized
The daily persecution
Comes from my own mind
The onslaught of self-doubt
Invades me once again
I need a ray of hope
To avert the bitter end

How could I get so down
Must pull myself back up
Too easy to give in
No way I'll give up
I've got to turn it around
And get myself set straight Got to keep my head up
Before it's all to late

I'm feeling low
