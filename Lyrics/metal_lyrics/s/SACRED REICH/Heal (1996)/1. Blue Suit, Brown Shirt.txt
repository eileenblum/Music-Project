"Ignorance not new to you
Your mission to exclude
Hate it blinds you cannot see
Pass your judgment down on me

Race dictates your every move
Pride is what you claim to prove
Separation is what you mean
Hate is really what you preach

Racist
Piece of shit
A bullet
It's the only way you'll learn

With new image, suit and tie
A new tactic you will try
Don't think that we cannot see
What a truth is underneath

Racist
Piece of shit
A bullet
It's the only way you'll learn

A bullet in your fucking head
A bullet in your fucking head
A bullet in your fucking head
A bullet in your fucking head

A bullet in your fucking head
A bullet in your fucking head
A bullet in your fucking head
A bullet in your fucking head

Trade your brown shirt for blue suit
Only your clothes are new
Saw you try with David Duke
But we can see right through you

Racist
Piece of shit
A bullet
It's the only way you'll learn
