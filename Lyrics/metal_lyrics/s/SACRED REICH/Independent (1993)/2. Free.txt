It's beyond me the differences in our minds in my head it's just as plain as day to be free free of hate, peace of mind exorcise the demons that can leave you blind
What I want, liberate from the things that bring you down free your self and all around what I see see neausiates eats the life inside of me kills the life inside of me
Hatred venom seeping through your veins question everything I know is true vengeance downward spiral never ends unity for what reasons, never know
What I want, liberate from the things that bring you down free your self and all around what I see see neausiates eats the life inside of me kills the life inside of me
Choose sides why must it be this way answer fear of the unknown decide where do you draw the line?
Our pride pride in the human race
What I want, liberate from the things that bring you down free your self and all around what I see see neausiates eats the life inside of me kills the life inside of me to be free
Overcome false boundaries built to keep us far apart drilled from when we were very young into what we think is true strength in us to push aside walls in which we'll never stay time for us to pool our pride and unify our brotherhood
To be free
