Full of potential yet nothing there filled with infinite ideas why so hard don't know what's the problem seems like pulling teeth never had this happen I must overcome
Pressure pressure pressure in my head pressure pressure pressure in my head
Tap into the bank of knowledge reaching for the source look around in my mind for some meaning don't know what I might find hope I find it soon taking just too much time sitting in this room
Pressure pressure pressure in my head pressure pressure pressure in my head
Don't like what I'm seeing lack of drive and thought don't know how to fix it time to start days of deep reflection nights of sweat and work have to beat this this is my reward
Look around in my mind hope to find any ideas I like and can write have to have some meaning not just some words put some music to it get to work
Pressure pressure pressure in my head pressure pressure pressure in my head
