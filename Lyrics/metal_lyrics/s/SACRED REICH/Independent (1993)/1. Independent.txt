Read my lips I don't care what you say I might listen but I'll do it my own way don't you see it don't mean nothing to me when all's said and done
I'll stand on my two feet
Let me be I live by my own rules independent, independence can't you see it's my right to choose independence, independent
Once they tried to teach teach me all their rules I had my own ideas didn't fit in, in their schools don't they see that we all have a brain there to learn not to be whipped and tamed
Let me be I live by my own rules independent, independence can't you see it's my right to choose independence, independent
Read my lips I don't care what you say I might listen but I'll do it my own way don't you see it don't mean nothing to me when all's said and done
I'll stand on my two feet
Let me be I live by my own rules independent, independence can't you see it's my right to choose independence, independent
