I've taken you for granted
I've known you since I was born
And all of a sudden
You've been taken, now your gone
There's so much
For me to say
I'm afraid It's much too late
You've been taken away

I wanted you
To see me succeed
To make you proud
And have you close to me
But now that you're gone
It brings tears to my eyes
I miss you so much
I never said goodbye
I never said goodbye

Your memory lives on
your close to my heart
I think of you
And we're not apart
There's so much
For me to say
I'm afraid it's much to late
You've been taken away

I wanted you
To see me succeed
To make you proud
And have you close to me
But now that you're gone
It brings tears to my eyes
I miss you so much
I never said goodbye
I never said goodbye

Your memory lives on
your close to my heart
I think of you
And we're not apart
There's so much
For me to say
I'm afraid it's much to late
You've been taken away

I wanted you
To see me succeed
To make you proud
And have you close to me
But now that you're gone
It brings tears to my eyes
I miss you so much
I never said goodbye
I never said goodbye
