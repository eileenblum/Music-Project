I know what your gonna say so don't
I know what your gonna say so don't
I know what your gonna say so don't
I know what your gonna say so don't

I never liked to talk too much anyway
I never listened to what other people say
Actions speak louder than words
You should move and not be heard

Do it
Just do it
Just do it
Do it

I've never seen what I've heard
I'm getting tired of being let down
I've always known you trust your own
Want something done do it yourself

Do it
Just do it
Just do it
Do it

I know what your gonna say so don't
I know what your gonna say so don't
I know what your gonna say so don't
I know what your gonna say so don't

I'm growing tired of all this
The larger you grow the worse it gets
What can you say say to anyone
I know what your gonna say do don't

Do it
Just do it
Just do it
Dit
