You say your misunderstood I say you give it real good now you work your way back you're crawling
You say you've always been there I say I don't understand you say your back for good your crawling
But your time now is gone you try to hang on try to stay on your feet but now your crawling, crawling to me crawling, crawling crawling, crawling back to me crawling, crawling
Is this what you want take it right back to the start when you fall on your face your crawling
Try it all on your own give it all that you know but when you come up short your crawling
But your time now is gone you try to hang on try to stay on your feet but now your crawling, crawling to me crawling, crawling crawling, crawling back to me crawling, crawling
How you want all of my time I see what you are like enter into my life crawling
You know no words to say you always like to play when on your hands and knees your crawling
But your time now is gone you try to hang on try to stay on your feet but now your crawling, crawling to me crawling, crawling crawling, crawling back to me crawling, crawling
