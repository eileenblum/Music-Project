[performed by Skullhog]Don't look now, the shadows are moving closer
A filthy stench, breathing down your neck
No way to run, no use to hide or flea
Prowling and stalking, terror in the night

Counting the minutes, paranoia is setting in
Gnawing teeth, distant belches can be heard

Blunt machetes, sparkling in the light of the moon
Squealing and grunting, a they close in upon you
Blood-dripping black teeth, grinning with glee
Disciples of hog, armies of boar-men
