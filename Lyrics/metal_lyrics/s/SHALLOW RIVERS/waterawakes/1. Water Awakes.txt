Come closer to my soul
Come whisper a melody
Of silent inner worlds
Till water awakes

Breathless streams are torn from the river
No lullaby to cryâ¦ Weeping eyes
Will remember
How she slept

River thaws snow
Breeds a new season
For the starving lands
Silent water awakes

Unseal your shell
Once frozen over
Break the chains of ice
And flood the Earth
