These Days
Drowse In Silence
But When Wind Grows
Strong Rains Will Drop

"Sometimes I hear what canât be heard in a summer evening threshold when fresh air luring with its crispness makes you stay outdoors for a while. For those who retain their sanity even when asleep and fear never waking up again the sounds are hidden. Thus the chain of events is foreseen and night replaces fading day. But the insane whose minds are possessed by enigmatic nymphs look through the silent evening regardless the clock tower dial and shiver and smell the scent of autumn soil moistureâ

What Has Been Seen
Cannot Be Forgotten
Even In a Dream
At the edge Of Morning Dawn

I Dive In Echoes of the Fall
Facing Freezing Storms
At the Gates of Winter 

Morning Brainstorm
Melts in Vanity
Of Another Day
To Dwell

As the Slumber
Overtakes Me
All Those Visions
Rise

Haunting Memories
Enforce My Agony
Entail Spiritual
Decay

Colors Blinding
Sounds Deafening
No Return
To Life

Canât ease my pain
Seek for relief
My dying hope
Begs from the Nymphs

Nymphs of Wailing Wind
Here I Fall Asleep
All I Have Is Yours
Just Sing To Me
Sing To Me
Never Fade Away
