Breathe no more, 
Just a sigh of woe.
Confined to misery, 
I roam forever

Depressed by the time 
Streaming still, 
My heart drowned deep
In its sombre waters

Bare gardens
Seem blooming for me, 
Grass grows tall 
Where she walks, so graceful

Bare gardens
Seemed blooming for me, 
Grass grew tall 
Where she walked, so graceful

Betrayal is raising
Dark seeds of my hatred,
Sincere emotions depraved

Enchanting temptation
Devoured her, deceived her,
Tormented primordial love

Days of joy and light - 
My endless nights.
Warm summer rains - 
Cold waters in vain

She left me forsaken,
Abandoned heartbroken,
Bedeviled, compelled me to cry

I curse her, despise her,
I scorn her, condemn her,
Forgive though if ever I
Die...
