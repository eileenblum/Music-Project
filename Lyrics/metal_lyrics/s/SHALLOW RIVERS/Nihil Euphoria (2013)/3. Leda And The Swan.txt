So fragile and naive is her purity.
When a night is too serene and still,
Maturity opens the gates
To the garden of carnal desires,
Ä°n substantial divine of flesh and blood.

Odourous smell of pleasure.
Bleeding wounds of hunger and lust.

A sudden blow of malicious wind.
Ä° rush on her with my beating wings.
Her thighs caressed and tightened.
Sheâs staggering.
She can not resist.
Her nape caught in my bill.
I hold her helpless breast upon my breast.
I lust for you.

Shuddering body.
My feathers slicing your skin.
Enourmous pleasure orgasmic throws
Ä°n my furious terror and poer.

All your lust is my fire.
Mortal flower.
You are so marvelous.

Lay its heat upon your skin.
Burning divine. Itâs Godlike.
With your arms torturing and tearing my love.

Leda, watch the feverish birth.
As the seed is getting colder.
An ugly creature of disgraced will never born again.
Aborted by your pleasure.
