Not questioning
âWhat is the meaning of my life?â
Itâs nothing at all.

To disguise the boredom
Or be swallowed in a swamp of lies.
Never.
Euphoria.
Let my fury rise
In passion flowers.

Their bitter seeds are of the same cold soil,
And stones lamented.

Elation.
Hollow dismal joy.
A sullen light.
A kind of ecstasy.

We are all dead now.
Do we fail to feel?
We are all dead now.
Or donât you see it?
Or donât you dare

To stop poisoning our souls with foul breath,
Licking its wounds with a tongue of thorns?
Are we brave enough to take the goddamned fate,
And make a first step towards death?

We dream of a new day to come.
In a fit of remorse regret it at night.
Wallow in prayers to ease stubborn pain.

Clouding of consciousness.
Indifferent mind obscured by relief.
Well-being
In deadened serenity.

Importunate psychotic lust
For parody of life.
