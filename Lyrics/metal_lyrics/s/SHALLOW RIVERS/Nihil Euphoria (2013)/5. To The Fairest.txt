Goddess of beauty and love,
Reveal your rival to me.
Loose your greed for blasphemous enviousness.
Dear Lady of Cythera.
Give me the prize that I lust.
The gift that all should me mine.
By your hand guide me
To war.

Did I break your fragile heart?
Did I shade your precious glory with sheer misery?
Are those fiery wicked eyes blinding you,
Your deadened mind stupefying?

A desire for rest.
Youâre torn apart from her.
At the wedding feast
Ä°n unbearable sadness.

Sheâll dry your tears
With wine lips.
Milk white skin
Will strip your mourning away.

Be mine.

In white capes of snow silk
One by one they entered the palace.
Come to decide upon the apple of strife.
Would you give it to the fairest?

Agony of defeat.
DemÐ¾lished lands.
Shattered chaos of the battlefield and your soul.
Vanity ravaged by war.

Helena, Iâll bring all their treasure to your knees.
I murder them all.
I conquer them all.
I slay and make them suffering.
Be mine.

Clouds obscure ethereal victory.
The defeat will be my revenge forever.
Here I die alone with no sympathy.
Still I stand alone for my prize.
