Their dead bodies were found
Many miles away.
From the place they fell in love with each other,
And the girl ran away from her mother.
So usual story.
They loved each other to death.

White tiny flowers will keep the secret of the moor.
A place where two lovers used to hide.

Smothered in suffering.
Was it a part of their tragedy
A wild ritual of murdering?

Their skin of purplish color.
Disgusting traces of sin.
Scary eyes full of horror.

He picked up a flower of pure white
And gifted to her.
Would your smell my dear
A weeping lotus?

There are many stories I heard,
But still cannot believe,
These innocent flowers
Could weep.

Lave me with your tears.
Enchanting circles of your weeps.
All your moans are sad and sweet.

Green hooded eyes have stolen my mind.
Iâll never wake untill I die.

Devoured by the black mouth.
Forever buried in mire.

Dance to me.
Give me more of your passion.
Dance to me.
Smother me gently.
