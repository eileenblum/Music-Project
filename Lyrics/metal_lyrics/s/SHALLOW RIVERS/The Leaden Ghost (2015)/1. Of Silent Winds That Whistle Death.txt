Will you follow the curse of a baneful sorrow?
Beyond milestones of death. To insatiable oblivion
To the end of it all. Will you follow?
Spell a word that shall befall
With a gleaming light of the leaden dawn

In a sudden rush her heart still beats
A lamented jewel buried deep in tragedies
With all hatred it could keep,
Bleeding so painfully
In vain she blamed the Lord and cried
Her prayers despised by tacit saints
Fed up with a tongue of blasphemy,
Her weakening sighs will end in agony
Oh, hapless Fate of all mankind

When darkness calls a day
In its ending serenade,
Again she awakes
To take a sorrowful fate of the mourner

In every dawn I see
A pale figure appear,
To disastrous chaos dragging me down
Towards the mist I step
In dissonant sanity
Blazing damnation of a sufferer,
In vague blackness haunting me,
Enraging howling whistlers of death
Stealing terror upon me,
The shining vision solidified
Razored reality
Enraged howling whistlers of death
Silent winds whistle
My own disease

I've seen a vision flickering
And the beauty of its stillness
From a lifelike breath I could hear a sigh
Then she dropped a tear
Like she was alive
Towards the curse
Now

The gates of everlasting sleep stood wide
Beneath the gale and waterline
She made a step to the frozen land,
Where silent winds whistle death

Light upon us, haze around us

Light upon us descends
And you're so fragile melting in my arms,
A vision ethereal

The morning fades in tranquil harmonies
A dancing shade slips through my hands
To the untrodden path
Where still immortals stand
A serene shelter for their eternal rest
A hardly beating heart I hear
In a whistler's melody
Oh, my mind can yield

A wanderer of the lonely sea
To serenade my woes away

A grey fog breaks the dawn
In stirring madness of the blusterous sea
By storming winds
Her sleep disturbed. Disrupted
She's still horrified
And tightened to the deck

Oh, how I wish she was alive
Once dashed ashore a fair maid
Far off and desolate
Her drifting corpse of chaos made
To return to life no more
In deep poisonous salted waters
Into the void

And then I saw utter destruction of a visible form
Scorched, wrecked and torn

That fog dispelled upon the shore
Again your body laid frozen
No more my breath could thaw your soul
Each dawn I open my eyes and sigh for you
