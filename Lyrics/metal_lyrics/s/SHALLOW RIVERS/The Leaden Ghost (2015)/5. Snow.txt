Revive
Come alive
Soon your soul will breathe again
Into me
She is a painter of my burden
Nothing more to bear
With every touch
She takes away
A shadow from my day
As cold as her kiss
In a wilderness
Do I exist? Wandering
White silver in the air
Faintly it descends
So let it snow
Until she fills my chest with lead of spells
By her words my mind possessed
With eyes staring at her freezing mouth
My body is of fragile ice

Mesmerized no frost I felt
Disappearing
Frozen there she laid
With crystal eyes wide open
She comes alive
Under the gentle snow

The leaden ghost

She's watching the sea with steady eyes of a roamer
Abandoned forevermore a spirit of the shore
Enchanting restless waters, whose depths enshrined her life
Cold and petrified
She's searching the truth she'll never know
In a cadence of forgetfulness
A damnatory weakness of her failure

Behind the veil of haze a wraith I see
Shining grey
A formless figure of endless suffering
A transparent shell of human being
Then spilled a tear

The girl cried loud
The name of the beloved one,
Who waited on the shore that day
With all hopes wrecked and swept away
And then she sighed again,
Revealed to me a secret
Of my end

You blind my eyes. I can't see
Your leaden light unto me

This unbearable numb pain in my ears
A haunting voice I cannot resist
It terrors my mind
I just cannot reach your words behind
Unconscious
I step into water

While soft winds die down,
The cold water sun I see
Are you a ghost of the leaden light shining?
Your words are full of sense, but I can't hear you
While soft winds die downâ¦
