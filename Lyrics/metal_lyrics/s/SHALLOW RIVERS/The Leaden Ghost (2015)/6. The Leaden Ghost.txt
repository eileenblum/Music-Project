She's watching the sea with steady eyes of a
Roamer
Abandoned forevermore a spirit of the shore

Enchanting restless waters, whose depths
Enshrined her life
Cold and petrified

She's searching the truth she'll never know,
In a cadence of forgetfulness
A damnatory weakness of her failure
Behind the veil of haze a wraith I see
Shining grey
A formless figure of endless suffering

A transparent shell of human being
Then spilled a tear
The girl cried loud
The name of the beloved one,
Who waited on the shore that day

With all hopes wrecked and swept away
And then she sighed again,
Revealed to me a secret
Of my end
You blind my eyes. I can't see
Your leaden light unto me

This unbearable numb pain in my ears
A haunting voice I cannot resist
It terrors my mind
I just cannot reach your words behind
Unconscious
I step into water
