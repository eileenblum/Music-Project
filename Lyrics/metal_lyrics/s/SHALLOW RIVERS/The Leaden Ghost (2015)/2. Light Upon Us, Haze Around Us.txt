Light upon us descends
And you're .so fragile melting in my arms,
A vision ethereal

The morning fades in tranquil harmonies
A dancing shade slips through my hands
To the untrodden path
Where still immortals stand
A serene shelter for their eternal rest
A hardly beating heart I hear
In a whistler's melody
Oh, my mind can yield

A wanderer of the lonely sea
To serenade my woes away

A grey fog breaks the dawn
In stirring madness of the blusterous sea
By storming winds
Her sleep disturbed. Disrupted
She's still horrified
And tightened to the deck

Oh, how I wish she was alive
Once dashed ashore a fair maid
Far off and desolate
Her drifting corpse of chaos made
To return to life no more
In deep poisonous salted waters
Into the void,

And then I saw litter destruction of a visible
Form
Scorched, wrecked and torn
That fog dispelled upon the shore
Again your body laid frozen
No more my. breath could thaw your soul
Each dawn I open my eyes and sigh for you
