Youâre the stranger to the night
You travel the speed of light
Home is not where you belong, so youâll just keep running
The road becomes salvation
No need for limitations
Youâll reach the border to hell, still youâll just keep going.

I know how it feels to leave it all behind
I know how it burns 
The longer the road unfolds, the closer you come to realize

And you know
Youâll fade into the dark as you go
Only love can save you
And you know
Somehow thereâs hope that finds you in the end
Only love can see you through

With no other real intention 
You seek no destination
Heading for a changing season
Never shake the voice of reason
Red skies painting dawn 
The longing for hope not torn 
Another chapter gone
Another road that leads you home

I know how it feels to leave it all behind
I know how it burns 
The longer road unfolds,  and now you come to realize

As you know
Youâll fade into the dark as you go
Only love can save you
And you know
Somehow thereâs hope that finds you in the end
Only love can be your truth
