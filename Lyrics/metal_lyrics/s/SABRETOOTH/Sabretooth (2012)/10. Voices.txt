So long Iâve waited 
For solace to begin
The only reason my blood runs through my veins
Forever changing 
Life never standing still
Now I know Iâm not alone

Drifting slowly, sinking 
In Euphoric, spaces
In my mind
Still the world keeps turning without you and me

So many reasons I cannot explain
What draws me closer to the dream I know shes in
A truth Iâm seeing from outside looking in
I take another breathe before we goâ¦

Drifting slowly, sinking 
In Euphoric, spaces
In my mind
Still the world keeps turning without you and me
Is there anyone who can save us from our lies

Ground is giving in from right under my feet
Iâm losing sight of the road that leads to you
I hear voices at the back of my mind
Constantly calling me â calling me back to you.

Someone wake me, I need to find my way back
Iâm losing sight of the road that leads me home
I hear voices calling back from my dream
Calling me back again, calling me back again

So long Iâve waited 
Waited for your return
The only reason I linger in this dream
Forever changing, time never stood so still 
Now I know Iâm not alone
