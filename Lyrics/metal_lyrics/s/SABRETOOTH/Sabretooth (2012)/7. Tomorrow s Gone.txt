The silence speaks to me in the end
Black clouds of nothingness
Iâm heartless, though yet you'll say
Let me be gone

With time taking time, no time for the glory
Take my hand and reach into morning

Tomorrowâs gone
Free from the pain of yesterday
We stand alone
Yeah you fight for the fight, won't you fight no more

Your breathe thins in this last night
As we talk of afterlife
Light shines through gaps in the window
As life goes on
With time taking time, no time to worry
Take my hand Iâll tell all your stories

The silence speaks to me in the end
Black clouds of nothingness
Iâm heartless, though yet you'll say
Let me be gone

Tomorrowâs gone
Free from the pain of yesterday
We stand alone
Yeah you fight for the fight, won't you fight no more
