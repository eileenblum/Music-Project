Contained by pain
I feel no fear
Iâm longing to someday find you again
A universe that separates the distance between us 

Refrain from guilt that never fades
Should take a chance when I have one
I feel the fate that awaits you is few and far between

Oh walk with me
I know you hear me somewhere
Follow me to the end
Till thereâs nothing to see

Passing time
The Longest hour
I need to find disillusion
Or am I one step closer to breaking the distance from where I lost you

I canât take this anymore
Iâm starting to lose my mind
Never felt this desperate need to find the impossible

Oh walk with me
I know you hear me somewhere
Follow me to the end
Till thereâs nothing to see
