Iâd cross the mountains and seas 
For only you &amp; you to please
Ride near and far to silence pain
How does one make up time spent lost?
Does one live in hope that one dayâ some day, youâll see? 
Forever Iâm the one making sense of your weakness.

One lives and dies by the choices we make.
Our lives we live and death we forsake

You were once the epitome of a role model to me,
How quick time fades the illusion and the truth we both see
Words travel faster than bullets but Iâm proof of the trigger you pulled.
Forever Iâm the one making sense of your weakness?

One lives and dies by the choices we make.
Our lives we live and death we forsake
When forgotten memories are all that remain
Reflection of your soul, the shadow of my pain

Iâd cross the mountains and seas 
If only for you &amp; you to please
Ride near and far to silence pain
How does one make up time spent lost?
Does one live in hope that one dayâ some day, youâll see? 
Forever Iâm the one making sense of your weakness
