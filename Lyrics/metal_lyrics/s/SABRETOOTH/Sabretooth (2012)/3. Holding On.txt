Living my darkest hour 
Time to lay thoughts to rest
I never saw it coming
The dawn of forever
Now the sand is sinking faster
In a fragile hour glass
Iâm not ready to give in yet
Still wanted moreâ¦
Holding onto life
Fighting for tonight
Holding onto every breathe
As if it were my last

Death still awaits us
Keys to life in hand
Thereâs still too many things
I have left unsaid

Holding onto life
Fighting for tonight
Holding onto every breathe
As if they were my last
Shadows I will cast
Long after Iâm gone
Signs that Iâm waiting for you
On the otherside

One thing that I have Learned
Is time waits for no one
Thereâs only one true certainty
