Empty spaces
Solitude holds you in
Familiar faces
Reflection only leaves you scarred
Determination
Will stop you before you bleed
Leave the anguish, itâs time to free yourself

Take me in 
Let time fall away to serenity
Breathe me in 
Let fear 
Fall away 

Alone in grieving
Solidarity begins
Louder voices
Projecting every thought you have
Elevation
Levitate within your dreams
Leave the anguish, itâs time to free yourself

Take me in 
Let time fall away to Serenity
Breathe me in 
Let fear 
Fall away into serenity 

Your moment arrives with every breath, and now you start believing
A change in a day dream signals your rebirth
Chains that hold all your fears give way and start releasing
Surrender your fixation
