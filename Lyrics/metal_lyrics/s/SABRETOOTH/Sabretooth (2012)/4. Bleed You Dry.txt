Real Life, you only imagine from where youâre  standing
You owe it all to be alive
Real Life, torn away how much higher does it take you
You know it always bleeds you dry

Iâm done, not getting any response 
Thinking youâll leave the dark
Just like, every moment that passed you
Or the moments that you leave behind

Real Life, you only imagine inside your own mind
You owe it all to be alive
Real Life, youâre escaping to enter sadness
You know it always bleeds you dry

Real Life, youâre beginning to finally know that
You owe it all to be alive
Real Life, youâre escaping to enter sadness
You know it always bleeds you dry

I hear you tell yourself youâve lost again
I know the walls around you just keep caving in
The rush that feeds your heart, you will never feel again
Sorrow youâve let back in - awake before you fall.
