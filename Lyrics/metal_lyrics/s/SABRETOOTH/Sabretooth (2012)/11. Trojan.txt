They took your life away
Filled your thoughts with broken promises
The sickness consuming youâ¦
Wonât take you away that easy
In and out of consciousness
Will we ever find its weakness?
Your fight to stay alive
Conviction not forgotten

Youâre driven to erase
The sickness from within you
Take back what was taken 
           Always starting again
To give in is never the answer
Iâd lie to myself thinking it would pass
To quit is not an option
Youâd tell yourself again

One chance at life
Not left behind
How much of this can you take 
One chance in life
No darkness in sight
The virus youâve fought to survive

Now looking back on your life
You couldâve had the answers
Is this the way it has to be
Not knowing what comes next?
To give in is never the answer
Iâd lie to myself thinking it would pass
To quit is not an option
Youâd tell yourself for the last time

Hold on another day
Hold on another day
Hold on another day
Youâve so much life still left to live
