Up All Night
Electric pulses chill the spine
This was the battle that left the devil behind toâ¦
Murder at will

Is this our fight?
Our sins stain the blood of the innocent
The greed that leads us destined to one day beâ¦
More and more alone
Every time I feel the greed I feel more and more alone

The Murderers fate refused to let him die
The destiny of man when no â one 
No one stays alive
A chain reaction starts a war - A war without an end
A war that will one day lead us â lead us to our end 

Soul on fire
The horror I see before my eyes
Of a burning sky and the city beneath that lies 
Broken and Obscene
Every time I feel the greed I feel more and more alone
