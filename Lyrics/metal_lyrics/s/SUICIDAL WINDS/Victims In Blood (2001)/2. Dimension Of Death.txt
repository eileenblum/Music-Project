Strange cold atmosphere
In the dimension of the dead
Am I dead or alive?
I find no answer

My soul is awake
But my body is dead
A dark soul is what I am
In the dimension of the dead

Step inside death
Follow me
Into the dimension
Dimension of death

Will I find the answer?
How should I know?
If I am alive or death
In this strange dimension

Nothing is as before
Everything is silence
My soul is awake, and my body is dead
In the dimension of death
