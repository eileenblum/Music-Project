Crush the weak, show your wrath
Kill with power, execute with pride
Evil force, force of might
Slaughter what is good, crush the slaves of god
For the lord of darkness we fight
With honour we slaughter for Lucifer
Those sacrifices makes us hunger for more
Our evil souls fills with joy

Lord of abyss, crush the weak
Lord of abyss, Hail!

Crush love and holiness
See the truth and obey the lord of darkness
You're all going to die in the unholy war
And the only winner is death
Crush the weak, show your wrath
Kill with power, execute with pride
Evil force, force of might
Slaughter what is good, crush the slaves of god

Lord of abyss, crush the weak
Lord of abyss, Hail!
