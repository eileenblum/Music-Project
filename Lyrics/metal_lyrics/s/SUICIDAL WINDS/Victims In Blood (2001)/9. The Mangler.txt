A scream in the night
A screech from a virgin
Her blood desecrated
By the Mangler
He's possessed by evil
Surrounded by demons
Satan has sent him
To extract blood from virgins

Mankind want to exterminate
This wicked creature
They think conjurations help
To bring malice
Out of the Mangler
The Mangler...

They try with holy methods
But the Mangler continues
His journey
Towards virgin's blood

Goodness can't destroy
Evil's purpose
The Mangler
Virgin's horror
