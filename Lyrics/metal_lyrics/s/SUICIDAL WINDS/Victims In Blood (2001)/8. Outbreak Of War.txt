War is here
Tranquility is gone
Tanks invades the ground
People executed

Fighting for their lives
Nowhere to hide
Merciless soldiers
Kill those innocent people

Outbreak of war
Tanks invades the ground
Outbreak of war
Kill

With pride and honour
They fight for their country
Risking their lives
For taking others

Screams and torture
Corpses everywhere
War is here
Tranquility is gone

Outbreak of war
Tanks invades the ground
Outbreak of war
Kill
