Trapped in an endless depression
Why was I born to this life?
Was it to share my anguish
With the rest of the world?

The world is full of escaping people
Who build up their lives on lies
They believe in a god
Because they are afraid of death

See the truth, the truth of death
There is no life after this
When you are buried and lifeless
Left only are ashes of a past life
Hateful life turns to ashes
We're all going to be free
Don't try to escape because you're dead
Left only are ashes of a past life

Life is a pain in the ass
There's nothing we do about it
Just let the suffer continue
And soon you will be free

Don't try to escape, because
Life is useless and meaningless
Wait for the arrival of death
And welcome it as your master
