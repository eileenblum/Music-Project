There she is lying
Dead like a stone
A painful dying
She gone through
My devilish desire
For carnal death
I want her body
Despite the rotten smell

Morbid temptation
Morbid temptation

The necrophiliac inside
Just want her
The hateful mind
Make the lust
Taking her now
Her dead body
Finally free
The seed let be

Morbid temptation
Morbid temptation
