Hell crushing flames shine strong
Tortured souls screams in pain
Demons attack, with demonic wrath
Satan command on his throne

Satan commands
In the fire of hell
Evil rules the world
Feel the satanic wrath

Demons await the final battle
To crush the gates of heaven
Hell flames burning strong
Satan command on his throne

Evil souls joined forever
To crush the world into ruins
The victory is soon here
Satan command on his throne
