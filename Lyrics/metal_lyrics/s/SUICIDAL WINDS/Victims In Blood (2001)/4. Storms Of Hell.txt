Storms of hell strikes forward
Fire of death is talking
The triumph of Satan is here
Christians run with fear
Ready to be slaughtered
By the legions of hell
A storm of fire burns the ground
And the stars are licked by Satan's tongue

Fire crush, chaos rules
Brigade of hell can't lose
Storm of hell, storm of death
A massive terror attack
And you're all dead by
Storms of hell

The victory is in our hands
Blood tastes good
An endless slaughtering
A true satanic victory
Fight for Lucifer
When demons are gathering
A victory for hell
Enemies drowned in blood
