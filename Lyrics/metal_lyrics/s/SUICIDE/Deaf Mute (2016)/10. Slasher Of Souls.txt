slasher of souls
butcher of sons
vein of evil
seen this before?

irresistible lust
fearless thoughts
homicidal passion
to defeat all

as their lives fade away
never seen more violent day
the final bloodshed has begun
they shall rot under the frying sun

death came with the blades
reaping their heads
in the name of god
religions change
under different names
still it remains
violence and death
mask it's face

propagate religious breeds
spread over hallowed grounds
satisfy your gods
filthy, sick obsessions
a kingdom based on lies
nations fall nations rise
Satan, the only ally
until we burn down the skies
