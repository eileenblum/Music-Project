blasphemous armies
at the gates of hell
butchery non stopped
ripping them apart

demons under human mask
smoky and hollow
falsified peace
when axes rhythmically chopped

thousands marched
singing the war song
battle hymns and chants
armored commands warped
like the judgement day

came the balls of fire
the dead arise as abyss awaits
a day of terror
a day of blessing
a final round with the devil

justice be restored
truth be revealed
blind be enlightened
fear be gone

within this final day
no remorse just oppress
blood lust swords
finish humanity test
