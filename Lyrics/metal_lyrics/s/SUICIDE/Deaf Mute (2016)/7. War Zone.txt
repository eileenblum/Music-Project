stay away and feel safe
no matter what lives melt away
defend your leader's all evil acts
religious pig, demonic pact

the further it goes the closer it is
counting secs to punish your sins
all those slayed souls will take revenge
by the blasts of vengeance age

and now it's begun,
sulphur melts your flesh
visions blurring
mind out of control
paralyzed, in panic, a shocking nightmare
watch your loved ones fade away
demons fill lungs to take your final breath
another vile soul is taken away

all the ruins crumbled by hate
to seal every dreamer's faith
fed by blood, fed by lust
a rightist pig, Satan's slave
the further you serve, the deeper it is
body counts are a daily routine
all those slayed souls will take revenge
by the blasts of vengeance age

wait for the fury of the dead
they will paint your world blood red
you will hear blasts of laughter
as you beg for another breath

your bones grind into pieces
and blood leaks out your chest
will see your heart's keep beating
to give you more pleasure of death
