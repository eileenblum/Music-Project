shattered state of mind
hearts and tongues are locked
knelt and prayed in the church of lies
for the final revolt
parasites fed by religion
demanding your souls and bones
to fulfill, ingather, submit to
an unborn beast

fear of nothingness
setting up the final war
predaceous, pitch black hearts
devil unleashed deviant minds

crush holy bible
words of you own god
march through Jerusalem
the city that collect bones of fools

darkness whirls in the skulls
tranquility paralyzed smiles
lack of senses, pedophiliacs' wastes
prepare you to get your children burnt

are you ready to draw your souls
into the arena of war?

have you ever smelled carcass and burnt flesh?
have you ever stared into a dead man's eyes?
are you ready to spill your blood
and reach your man made god?
