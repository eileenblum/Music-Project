eyes have just
adapted to daylight
shut and sealed
to an already dead world
ten pounds of flesh
silenced blindly
to secure aim
and preserve lies
shed blood and intimidate
spread fear and dominate
deaf, mute to the rest of the world
disciples of Belial

deaf, mute
to the rest of the world

heritage of a hideous belief
symbols of doom abused the past
adorable lies narcotized the masses
divine words, hide pure hate

rip baby bodies
with hi-tech blasts
terrorize a land
justified by defence
silent citizens
with a drug called wealth
man made evil, man made hate

deaf, mute
to the rest of the world

push troops to hostile land
kill the hopes
as it was done before
so many years wasted by this agony
just watch and count the dead
