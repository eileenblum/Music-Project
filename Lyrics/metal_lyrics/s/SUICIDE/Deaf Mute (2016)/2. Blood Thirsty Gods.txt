medieval tales, control minds
pathetic beliefs, ignorance and bloodshed
a cross shadows earth, perverted deeds
prophetsâ land, where hatred feeds

how many to be slaughtered 
how many generations to waste
how many women to be raped
to worship a bloodthirsty god

bloodthirsty god

but soon there will be 
a god with no believers

insanity, fatality, mortality
now it's time 
of the world's end
