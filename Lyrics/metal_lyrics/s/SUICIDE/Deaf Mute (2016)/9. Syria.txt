let it burn,
crush by war machines
all shall be slaughtered
for benefits of companies

babies drown,
where you sip your cocktails
you watch then turn your face
wait for next pay day

will knock down your door
burn your loved ones
will take your souls
bullets, bios and chemicals

a bleeding corpse
will rise as an enemy
seen many times in history
arrows, spears and swords

racist hate,
ignorant,
guilty of bloodshed
capitalist scum,
psychopath
soulless whore
bio waste to the core
cannibal
bloodless carnivore
deggial for all
will be carved on your tomb stone
