woken by a flash
and you feel no pain
no fear or thoughts
no memories remain

visions start to pour on you
and renew your torture,
you realize the role
that life wrote for you

first cut and blood wash the walls,
listen to hellish laughs and words of hatred,
see sarcastic eyes, watch you bleed to death,
feel stenchy breath, cold hands beheading you

courage misleading you dig your grave
your angels, holy army abandoned you,
too late to remember god,
your name's lost eternally
now you beg a shadow,
a demon for mercy

blade on your throat
you serve to the army of the dead
souls ripped and torn
a victim to the army of the dead
blade on your throat
you serve to the army of the dead
your soul is torn
a victim to the army of the dead

sacred lies,leading to decline
deceived fool, a tool to misguide
you are just a piece of flesh now
no more believer of eternity
