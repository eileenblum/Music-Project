bow to lord unseen
enemy of my enemies
practice what is taught
reward, it's precious, 

wine of Babylon poisons the earth
let blood spill from heretic throats
I'm them and they are me
we shall separate the sheep from the goats

virgins are waiting to
fulfill your phantasies
wildest become true
where you fuck your siblings

wine of Babylon poisons the earth
let blood spill from heretic throats
I'm them, they are me
we shall separate the sheep from the goats

spiritual chaos distorts reality
endless conflicts, endless insanity
blood addict saints, violent delusions, 
minds are slaved by book of vanity
