Aqua and god were present
And a swan of god
God was bored of loneliness
Swan was bored of aqua

At last she dived into deep water
And raised with some mud in her beak

God let her spirit the mud
It became a giant
Aqua was not alone

Those didn't satisfy the swan
Thought she was greater
Then she dived to get another piece of mud
Those didn't satisfy the swan
Thought she was greater than god
She dived for the last time

Those didn't stop him
There were not only aqua and earth
Human was with them
Became a monster

Neither god nor swan could stop him
He conquered her aqua and earth.
