Capture the critical
Ignore the irrelevant
Judge the regularity
Isolate the self

Question danger and death, good and evil
Courage, rewards and wealth await

An alternate dimension
Material world has
Plugged into it
The spirit interfaces

Endeavour, everything possible inside
Improve the odds
Revocable characters
Implicity cues the ease of death

Unquestionable beliefs, unlimited goods
Restore symbolic strength
Own everything but still lacking
Herein virtual realm.
