Thousands of dead faces
Horrified, disfigured
Among mass graves
Perished in earthquake

Cities collapsed
Victims buried alive
Neither age nor sex determined
When they exhume the bodies

Death toll raised to thousands
Under the rubble
Dreams of a nation
Turned into a wasteland

Cities collapsed
Victims buried alive
Neither age nor sex determined
When they exhume the bodies

Greedy structuring
Consumption of nature
Purged the cities
And the hopes.
