Do you like to see your daughter
Naked and scared, under a beast
Salivas on her body, sperm on her lips
Desperate, staring at a webcam

Another way of incest
Instiction has no limits
Abuse whoever she is
Entertain you for five minutes

Couldn't they cope life
Did they have no aim
Is it a choice to be a prey
Can't we see, or are we

Merchants of misery
Trap for the weak
Spawns of hatred
Downfall of humanity

Sunken eyes spoke of his bitterness
Begging for another shot to ease the pain
Words're sounds, visions're nightmares
Big price paid for being young and fool

Names that have no meaning
Used as barcodes
Disposed of afters it's done
Trumperies lost in time

Couldn't they cope life
Did they have no aim
Is it a choice to be a prey
Can't we see, or are we

Merchants of misery
Trap for the weak.
