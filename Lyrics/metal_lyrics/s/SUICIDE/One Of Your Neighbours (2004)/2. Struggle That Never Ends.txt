Struggle never ends
Hunting your own kind
Conjuring brutality
Preaching to destroy

Belief's like a knife inside
Bleeding feeds our fury
There's no god order for murderer
Nothing rules the world
Violence within, gust of anger
Set hellfire on earth

When death industry starts the last war
Will this be the salvation that humanity need

Order of self destruction
Forcing me to insanity
One's blood other's satisfaction
Forcing me to insanity.
