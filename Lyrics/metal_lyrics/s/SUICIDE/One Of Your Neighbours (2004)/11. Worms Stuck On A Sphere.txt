I stand here watching your every move
Wish i was millions of miles away
Experiment our sacred species
That's built to demolish

Create, kill
Build, ruin
Attack, defend
Progress, regress
Poison, cure
Reign, obey
Preach, seduce
Mercy, torture
Unite, divide
Believe, deny
Produce, consume
Scare, fear

Trying to realize
Miserable creatures' aim
Question the minds of
Saddled freaks bound to desperation

Worms stuck on a sphere
Neither will win nor survive
Divided by colors and wealth
One's death another's triumph

Atrocity that confused my mind
A life style for most of us
I got used to see bloodbath
Believe no one will survive

Blood thirsty carnivores wearing uniforms
Spatter blood on everyone's future
Can you purify by acting the innocent
They spill blood you lick their boots

Trying to realize
Miserable creatures' aim
Question the minds of
Saddled freaks bound desperation

Atrocity that confused my mind
A life style for most of us
I got used to see bloodbaths
Believe no one will survive

I stand here watching your every move
Wish i was millions of miles away
Experiment our species
That's built to demolish.
