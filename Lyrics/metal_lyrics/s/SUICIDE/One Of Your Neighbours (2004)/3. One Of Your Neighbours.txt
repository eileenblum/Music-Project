Light fades away
Last hope has broken
The innocent murdered on the streets
Unknown enemy masturbates

Hate's flown from the past
Destructive minds made by powermads
Built a new world, order of parasites
Shaping posterity, caging their souls, caging my soul

Hidden lust
Crooked beliefs
Sodomic acts
Cruel desires

Convinced mass murderer, a blind believer
Condemned you to hell, believes he's the one
Releases your soul, sets you free
Wakes you up to find the truth

Convinced mass murderer, a blind believer
Condemned you to hell, believes he's the one

Hidden lust
Crooked beliefs
Sodomic acts
Cruel desires

They've turned religion into a spy, a weapon
They've gained by fright, suicide bombers
Enemy is close, one of your neighbours
Wishing to kill you, your wife and children.
