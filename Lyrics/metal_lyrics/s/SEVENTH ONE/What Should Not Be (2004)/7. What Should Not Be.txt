Bleeding the soul hunger grow cold
What is and what should not be
Forces of nature decides
Silence that thunder over the land
Shattering cries the lost and the damned
Gather my strength from within

From the hidden we will rise
To fight holy visions of lies

Pray for rain
I am burning the cleansing of the soul
Fly on to eternity
Ride on black wings to Valhalla
Burning of your souls

Taming the flame enlighten our world
What is and what should not be
Cycles of nature has turned
Rivers of sadness we leave behind
Into the vortex guiding the blind
Gather my strength from within

From the hidden we will rise
Fight holy crusade of lies

We release the blood
Of your manmade gods
