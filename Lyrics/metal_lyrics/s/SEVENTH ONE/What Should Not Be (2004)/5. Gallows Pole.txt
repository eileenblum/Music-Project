I've sailed upon the seven seas
Into the night
I've travelled all around the world
And I hear you still
You prayed for a second chance
Another way to stay live
We were the ones meant
To save your souls

Fading images will they ever leave

Through shadowed eyes we seal your fate
Watching you bleed
With blackened hearts we congregate
We'll meet at the gallow's pole

I've witnessed both the rise and fall
Empires that turned to dust
Seen giant towers reach the sky
And far beyond
You prayed for deliverance
You believed in redemption
We were the ones meant
To save your souls

Sacred images fade before my eyes

I still hear your cries
