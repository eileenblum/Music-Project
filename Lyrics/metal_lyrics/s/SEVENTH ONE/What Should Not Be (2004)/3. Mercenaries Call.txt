We walk between the paths of men and gods
A secret entity sworn to secrecy

We've seen our human race vanity exposed
The pure in man corrode
As hatred breeds and grows

If we die burning bridges one by one
See in your hearts for the reason why
Feel the smoke rising high above the ground
When the ashes clear and the sun recedes

If we live or we fall
It's the mercenaries call

We wield the hand of doom
That's hiding in the deep
Deafening the screams
Resounding in your dreams

But who will save the ones
Poisoned with disease
A threat that will not cease
A fear that never leaves
