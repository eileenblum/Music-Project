Show me how a way to escape from the memories
Close my eyes fall into dreaming again
Make the minf unravel the thoughts that imprison us
Moments shift fragments reveal the concealed

Through darkened times we believed our saviours
Embodiment of a world lost in decay

Eyes of the nation
Masses are blind fall into line
Unable to think for themselves
Indoctrination
Who will be taken away
By the eyes of the nation

Break the seal reopen the gates to oblivion
Hidden doors revealing the passage ahead
From our dark dimensions unknown are unfolding
To dethrone the pendulum of mind control
