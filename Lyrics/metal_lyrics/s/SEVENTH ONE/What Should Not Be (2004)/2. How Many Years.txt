I'm facing the mirror
Gazing at my shadow
A soul that's so out of place
Without a trace
Of human compassion

How many tears
How many lies
How many years
On these fields of despair
How many scars
How many wounds
How many years
Tell me how many years

Confusion comes over me
Thoughts racing back and forth in my mind
I'm asleep yet I can see it all
I can hear them crawl
As the walls are caving in

I'm not afraid anymore
Their voices guide me to the end

I'm the believer the true deceiver
The thorn in your side opening wide
I'm the believer the soul retriever
The thorn in your side - opening wide
I'm the believer - the thorn in your side
I'm the deceiver - the wound opening wide
