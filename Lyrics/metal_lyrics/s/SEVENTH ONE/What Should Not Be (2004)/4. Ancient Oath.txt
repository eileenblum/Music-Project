Forces of madness pulling me down
Binding my soul splitting the ground
Venomous tongue spreading the lie
Illuminated eyes

Rising higher - Tidal waves will turn again
Crying spirits - Echo through the raging waters

Father Father of soil
Awaken mind
Secret of the ancient
Serpent serpent of old
No longer blind
Secret of the ancient oath

Painted illusions behind my stare
My inner I the soul lies bare
Gates of perception opening wide
My crossing is denied

Rising higher - Visions of an ancient reign
Crying spirits - Echo through the raging waters

Father Father of soil
See stars align
Serpent serpent of old
I am no longer
