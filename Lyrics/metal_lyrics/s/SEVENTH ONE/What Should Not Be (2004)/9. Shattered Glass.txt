Her falling tears forming an ocean
A pool of grief upon the ground
Saddened by loss
For a future that never was
Ours to keep
To dream awake while others sleep

Shattered glass
Lies upon our shining path
Feed the fire carnal desire
Shattered glass
Lies upon our shining path
Saddened by loss
We all carry our own cross

Here lies the old and the tragic
Longing for serenity
Paintings that fades unforeseen
Remembering the dreams
That used to be our own
Silence the screams
Another era dawns

Shades of grey
Misguiding our lives on the way
Feed the fire awaken desire

But where do we run
I see the lights from far away
