Ammoâs unlimited, barrage of hate
Razor villains united by the capital death brigade
Itâs too late, in for the kill
Bigger than a dollar bill, thatâs what we feel

Torturing a heretic, burning a whore
Siberian bear declares the war

Heads gonna, heads gonna, heads gonna roll
You all gonna, you all gonna, you all gonna fall
Terror, terror, terror, terror of the Death Star
Fall down to your knees, smack your king, hail to the tsar!

[Chorus]
For the glory of metal I kill the steel
You donât dare to front and you never will
Breaking the law we still spit in your face
Metal lives forever and the crime still pays

Weâre back like a plague, run down your rat pack
George fucking Harrison will break your chicken neck
Attack, time to wreck, your dreams fade to black
Terror of the seven seas, scum, hit the deck!

Torturing a heretic, burning a whore
Siberian bear declares the war

Heads gonna, heads gonna, heads gonna roll
You all gonna, you all gonna, you all gonna fall
Terror, terror, terror, terror of the Death Star
Fall down to your knees, smack your king, hail to the tsar!

Weâre sick of it all gonna end the rat race
Metal tsar from the forest will devour your face
Opposition will be crushed by the grinding machine
Gonna bring it to the limits, terror is unseen
