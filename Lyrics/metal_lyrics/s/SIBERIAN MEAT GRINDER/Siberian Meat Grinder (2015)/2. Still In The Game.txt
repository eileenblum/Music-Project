Lifeâs turned its back on you and your spare minutes are few
And your problems are eating your time
Youâve got distorted view, so now what are you gonna do
When youâre still at the end of the line
Grab it ! Your life by the throat it is yours to live day by day
Kick it ! The treacherous rat who is stealing your future away

[Chorus]
Train yards, roads, and highways
I hear them calling my name
From the city lights to Valhallaâs fires
Count me in Iâm still in the game

Break your rusty chain, go paint another train
Skate that shit itâs time to ignite
No pain, no gain, we destroy - not entertain
Start a band and join the good fight
Grab it ! Your life by the throat it is yours to live day by day
Kick it ! The treacherous rats who are stealing your future away

I raise the dead with a forbidden chant
Backhand slap you to life, bred, born, left, fed, suffocated, backstabbed, blood red,
Dagon media, theyâre gonna feed on you
Sinister minister of the crimson empire of liars
Bodies of the infidels, purgatory fires, burned on sacrificial pyres,
Optical wires embedded in the heads of his admirers,
Assembly of the dark gods
