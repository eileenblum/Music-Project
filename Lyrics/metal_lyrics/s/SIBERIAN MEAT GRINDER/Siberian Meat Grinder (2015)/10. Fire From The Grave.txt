Pill after pill, another dream killed, youâre running with the rodent pack
You try and you try and they lie and they lie, step forward and two steps back
Lost in the endless tunnel to hell like a spaceship with no control
Pigs and freaks, bloodsucking ticks, they pushing you down. Donât dare to fall

What a fiasco youâre talk of the town
Never give up, never back down
Behind your back they gonna call you a clown
Never give up never back down
Mr Nice guy, youâre the first to drown
Never give up never back down
Rats are out - itâs their killing ground
Never give up never back down

Back from the grave, riding the wave of anger, malice and wrath
Heads gonna roll, they fall and they fall, youâre bringer of pain and death
Guess who is back in an old town and who is now in control?
Hate, too late, retaliate, burning crusade, Fire take em all!
