As long as I remember weâve laughed at your type, shit talking behind our back
Wasting your time, creating the hype, preparing the counter attack
Still holding our ground, these colors never run
Touring, thrashing, fighting, chasing the fun
We spit on your ideals, itâs fun to kick the hive
Youâre just an aging hippie, too old to get a life

[Chorus]
Now youâre dazed
What a disgrace
Never gonna stop it
Laughing in your face

You hated me, cause the way that I looked, you called my music a noise
Skateboarding, graffiti and the noise that I cooked annoyed the societyâs toys
Weâve never been like you it was your reason to attack
Growing under pressure taught us to fight back
Our game is still the same, the stakes are insane
And your life is pathetic and youâre the one to blame
Boring job, boring life, fat ugly wife
Shitty beer, TV shows, no hopes, no drive
Braindead walking zombie, you just have got no clue
Just got what you deserved, hey buddy, jokeâs on you !
