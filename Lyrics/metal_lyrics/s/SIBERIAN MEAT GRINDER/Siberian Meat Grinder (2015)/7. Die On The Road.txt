We will never stop! Get up! Bop till you drop
Still in the game, long way to the top
Stay away, I gonna make them pay
Taking whatâs mine all day everyday
Sleep is a cousin of death I never sleep
Is this my world? Gonna get a grip
Stay on the road, Never give up
Youâre not a liar if youâre lying to a cop

Rob you for your cans I gonna bomb that train
Let me grab a mic to scream away the pain
Life is just a game and I've found the code
Pedal to the metal - Die on the road!

Shit-talkers gonna talk and the haters gonna hate
Iâm building my empire while you sit and wait
Youâre late, dead weight, Siberian dictate
I rule the jungle, your lifeâs on a plate
Sleep is a cousin of death I never sleep
Is this my world? Gonna get a grip
Stay on the road Never give up
Youâre not a liar if youâre lying to a cop
