Government steals, mass-media lies
How could I've imagined? Youâve opened my eyes !
Art-school visionary show us the path
Before you build the barricades, please take a bath
Who pays for your rebellion your parents or the state
Too late, the systemâs gonna face your hate
You message board aggressor, PC-gestapo dork
Youâd better sing about dragons, epic battles and the orcs

[Chorus #1]
Now! Slay the dragon
Now! Battle cry is loud
You can do it
Grab your sword defeat the dragon now

[Chorus #2]
Now! Slay the dragon
Now! Battle cry is loud
You can do it
Shut Your Mouth Defeat the dragon now

Raised on the street, king of the pit
Get some other sneakers, this pair doesnât fit
Inked to your toes, menacing pose
Scum on your gigs youâre too shy to oppose
Steroid battletoads rule the pit with an iron fist
We kicked your sorry asses, you ran to the police
Your âunityâ and âprideâ are no more than empty words
I'd rather sing about dragons, epic battles, magic swords

You just got lost in the sea of trends
Second hand ideals, generic bands
Skinny pants, right brands, if it offends-
Thatâs what I meant

Screw your band, screw your crew and your fake tattoo,
Fantasy tales are more true than you
Does FBI make you live a lie ?
You canât deny
