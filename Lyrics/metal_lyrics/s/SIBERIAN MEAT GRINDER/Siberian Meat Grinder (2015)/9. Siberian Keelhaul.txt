The winds of Siberia are filling our sail
We raid the inner seas and our spirits never fail
Dead men tell no tales, steel nail, blood trail
The Tsar is coming for you, riding a killer whale
We gonna hunt you down, you gonna lose some fat
Bomb your town, take your crown, youâre nothing but a rat
Face the dread, seeing red
Bang your head, wake up dead

We plunder, pillage, vandalize - thatâs a pirates' life for me
My cutlass to your guts, your skull will hit the deck
Under the banner of the Tsar we raid the boiling bloody sea
We gonna sink your fleet and make you walk the plank

Sea raiders of the Tsar will never have a rest
I look into your soul and take you for the test
Space Quest, Youâd better hide in your hole
The heretics and traitors: time for keelhaul
The Flying Siberian is coming for your gold
Deathmold, lifeâs sold, terror untold
Youâre dead meat, thatâs your fault
Sharks will feed Youâve been told

Walk the plank!
The Original Pirateâs Life!
Hit The Deck!
Mic check, back to back
Attack of the wolf pack, time for strife
