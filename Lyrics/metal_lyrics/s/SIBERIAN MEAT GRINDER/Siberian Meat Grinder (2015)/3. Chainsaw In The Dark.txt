Long arm of the dead is dragging you down
Show them your weakness and youâre as good as drowned
Live like a clown, die like a worm
No turning back now itâs time to
Storm the bastions of the army of the dead
They want you to be like them, rotten maggots in your head
Controlled by the evil book they want to make you one of them
A pawn in the game of lies, conformity and scam

[Chorus]
Fear in your heart, never let it grow
Roar of the chainsaw whoa-oh-oh
Armed to the teeth, let the bastards know
Slashing through the darkness with my chainsaw

They will swallow your soul, feast on your flesh
Surrounded by deadites, high time to slash
Obey their rules, stuck in a rut
Theyâre laughing at your dreams and now itâs time to
Cut the demon trees, you got captured by their roots
Forever locked in a cabin in the heart of evil woods
They used to be your friends, now youâre stabbed with a knife
Itâs not a Necronomicon, itâs just a book of life
