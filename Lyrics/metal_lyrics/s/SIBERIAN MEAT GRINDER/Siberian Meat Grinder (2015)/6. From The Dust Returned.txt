Man of steel: death and return
Blood spill, iron will, bridges to burn
Plague attack, Iâll be reborn
Back to the planet Tuul, Iâm Blackthorne
Do you know what itâs like, what is the price?
To be the bad man, the sad man, behind blue eyes
Time flies, demise, Lord of the Flies
Bear mask on my face, its will never dies

Youâre warned I spit the scorn, watch your back fool
From the dust returned
Word is born, watch you burn, protect your neck fool
From the dust returned
Something wicked this way comes, hear the war drums, it is time to drop the bombs
Bleeding gums, bodies burn, watch your back fool
From the dust returned

Donât talk to me - Iâm allergic to whores
Iâm Pyramid Head and you are the Nurse
From bad to worse, better cut the shit
Hate that I spit, heads split, itâs too late to quit
The seed of maximum pain
Iâm the new Bat whoâs torturing Bane
Dead head, force fed, fall of Max Payne
Tapping your vein like insane, sky bleeds blood rain

From The Dust!
From The Dust Returned!
From The Dust!
