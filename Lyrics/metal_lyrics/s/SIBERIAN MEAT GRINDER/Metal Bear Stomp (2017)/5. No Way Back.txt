Hey fool what you do when we attack?
Heed the warning, run upon you, waving the Black Flag
Waving the Black Flag, we're the Bear-pack
Sacrifice you for your lies no way back

We're the "burn your phony club" pack
We're the "beat you with the club" pack
We're in for the kill to bury them
We're "What are you staring at" pack
We got that OG bear pack we are the "no way back" pack
How do you know we're coming? "Gonna grind it 'til we're dead" pack
We got so many haters but we know they come and go
Now they try to imitate us, each and every day more than before
We don't like your kind we grind 'em 'til their bodies hit the floor
I'll show you the brutality, all out war

Breaking through the wall, we're the crew against you all
Heed the warning, to exterminate the phonies â it's the only goal
You play your role, I play a symphony of war away from home
Crazy to the bone, I'm in a zone
Don't complain to me, don't even try
Cry me a river
I'm a blood reaver, I'm a grim reaper give me the unbeliever
Already here, feel the fear, out to make you shiver
Your army may be big â the legion of the Tsar is bigger

Hey fool what you do when we attack?
Heed the warning, run upon you, waving the Black Flag
Waving the Black Flag, we're the Bear-pack
Sacrifice you for your lies no way back

Screw your phony crew, screw your phony band
Just in case you forget I will write it on my pad
When we come around we're in full effect, you're just about to drop
Never ever looking back, better tell us what?
You're imposters all you got were the forster's
Imaginary friends you lost em
Back to the house of pain, we toast em
I bomb the trains you're pasting the posters
I'm a cro-mag like Fred, club you to the death, Yaba Daba Doo
Better stay away from the cops so you never catch a pig flu
I spit another bar, put 'em on the altar
Break 'em, bake 'em, hashtag "Hail to the tsar"
You ain't going far we rise above horizon, death star
Feed em to the bears, feed em to the bears
Give em to the grinder now! Who cares?
Find em, they run away from the grinder
My crew run with the banners, flares

Hey fool what you do when we attack?
Heed the warning, run upon you, waving the Black Flag
Waving the Black Flag, we're the Bear-pack
Sacrifice you for your lies no way back
