Oh no! The big mouth strikes again
You just felt the pain of a frying pan, your Walkman started to melt
You shot ahead â that's what them jealous fools can't stand
IT's time to sew that mouth shut, cut off the idle hand
It's high time to admit
You have to work the hardest on your skills to complete
Grind your fingers to the bone, waking up before you get some sleep
Why blaming others for your own failures? Talk is cheap!

Check it out now!
It's going out like that phat rhymes we deliver
Say what? Get busy yo!

Those with primitive skills always look for excuse
You had your turn but you lost it, don't blame me, it's no use
I got news for you, you have to practice more
With a level like this, we'll walk you out the door

So many walls to hit, bars to spit, mics to kill
While you're chilling at that party I would stay at home and master my skill
Time is money no fool foots your bill
It's your right to choose, your decision, use your free will

We are short on time we can't waste any more
The race against the damn clock, the climax of the whole war
Click-clack, click-clack, we live by the code, there is no way out
To leave our own scratch on the surface, that's what it's all about
We are short on time we can't waste any more
The race against the damn clock, the climax of the whole war
Click-clack, click-clack, we live by the code, there is no way out
To leave our own mark on the surface, that's what it's all about
