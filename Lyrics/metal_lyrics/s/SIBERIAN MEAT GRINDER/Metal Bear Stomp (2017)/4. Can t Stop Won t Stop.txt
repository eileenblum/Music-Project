I'll extract the liquid from your spine and put in a can
Bomb the walls with it to activate the pit and feed the flame
Is it raining blood r we are shredding bodies like Bloodrayne
Snakes on a plane we left you with a screaming brain
All in black like Cash, Ring of Fire, I walk the line
Snatcher in the rye, I'll make you choke on Dandelion wine
Since the day on we got just one rule: do or die
Open your mouth and you got Siberian-neck-tie

Up up better pack it up son
Up Up who said the bear-man can't jump?
Up up you're just a shook one
One against all we can't and won't stop

Bend your will, the real recognizes real
We sent the Monolith in space to teach apes to kill
We made them beat your leader with a bone, driving you away
We started 40K: a Siberian Space Odyssey
In any battle I re-roll the dice and hit twice
I got more rhymes than a pig's head on a stick got flies
I'm coming for you with a pizza cutter, gimme that slice

Up up better pack it up son
Up up who said the bear-man can't jump?
Up up you're just a shook one
One against all we can't and won't stop

Undefeated, we beat it, sky's the limit
Make noise if you dig it! Like you mean it
I kick in the door like Biggie I'll splatter you any minute
I'm here to stay, make you my prey and get away with it
Here we go again, rhymes spraying, mics slaying
Siberian Roulette 'til the end, the game we stay in
The dog just told me to erase you, fam, like I'm son of Sam
We got your soul in a can
