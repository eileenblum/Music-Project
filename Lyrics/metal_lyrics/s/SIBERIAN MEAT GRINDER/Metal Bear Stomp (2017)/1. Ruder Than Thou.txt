Drop that jaw, we hit the dance floor you know!
All mandem's here, we bring the raw flow here we go!
Fear the bear claw, you know, break the law dem law!
Bear Tsar Hooligans, ruder than thou!

Here we go: we are dragging your mind into the unknown
It's only over when you give up. Millions day to grow
Million ways to fall, in Sovngarde I devour your soul
And throw your empty body in the pond over the garden wall
Tsar-Bear and the Aggravators come to make that fire blaze
that riddim is a banger, like it's coming straight outta space
Violent pacification, come on feel the vibe
Siberian therapy brings you from wrong to right

Drop that jaw, we hit the dance floor you know!
All mandem's here, we bring the raw flow here we go!
Fear the bear claw, you know, break the law dem law!
Bear Tsar Hooligans, ruder than thou!

You must scream, but you have no mouth, my name is AM
Like Eminem I'll compose a song about you, name it "Stan"
I'm Hogan versus Andre the Giant, prepare for a body slam
I'm Mark Romanek direct "99 problems"
Tsar-Bear and the Aggravators come to make that fire blaze
that riddim is a banger, like it's coming straight outta space
Violent pacification, come on feel the vibe
Siberian therapy brings you from wrong to right

Drop that jaw, we hit the dance floor you know!
All mandem's here, we bring the raw flow here we go!
Fear the bear claw, you know, break the law dem law!
Bear Tsar Hooligans, ruder than thou!

Outta Siberian slum we come to get the work done
Opposing our mandem is like staring at the sun
Like ademented rati inside the wheel you better run,
They will harder hit the bottom the harder they come
Riddim on repeat, rip it up and bring it in
Selecta, selecta, keep it up and let it spin
Rise up, stand up, represent underground
Bassline-Buckaneers bring the boss sound
Who killed all the wasteman? It was me â SMG
Top Siberian riddims, made by Tsar Killabees
Revolt against dem system Babylon society
Who hit all dem trains, son? Nah, that's not me!

Drop that jaw, we hit the dance floor you know!
All mandem's here, we bring the raw flow here we go!
Fear the bear claw, you know, break the law dem law!
Bear Tsar Hooligans, ruder than thou!
