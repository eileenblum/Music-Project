Speed is hyper you can't break the cypher
We deliver elder knowledge to you, don't believe the hype â no!
We gave you reason to get busy, like a killa-bee
Don't lose it! We are still cruisin' like Easy-E
Our engines are hot, hotter than boiling dragon blood
Hardwired to Hyperdrive, call me sire Jump-a-lot
In a pod for eternity you're left to rot
Just like Lando we come to rock the Sure Shot

Pierce the sky like lightning
To fulfill our fate
We know no limit
We see no limit
Eternal Crusade

Start the final countdown to the takeoff of the fleet
Hyperdrive-on, Acclamator class-ship
Never ending space will shallow us whole zero,
Rip and tear towards the black hole
Into the unknown, steady as she goes,
Dim screen glow, cryogenic gel flows
Through my veins as we drift through the void of space
No one hears you scream â frozen for a hundred years.

Pierce the sky like lightning
To fulfill our fate
We know no limit
We see no limit
Eternal Crusade
