Bring the heat, we make steel dragons bleed
Up jumps the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
Train bangers them liars call us vandals
Rock the fresh styles, we're producing the coolest panels
Enter the darkest train yards
Will we come back? We don't know!
On a quest for the best style
Never surrender. Here we go!

Never give up â we got paint to spill
Raiding the yard â we're out for the kill
Ready to rock â steel heart, iron will
I've got the baddest mission â I'm here to hunt the steel

Another night, prepare for the style fight
Don't be like Rainbow Kid, caught in the spotlight
Getting up, like Mr Eon I'm peddling that smut
Kill the real steel demon, show 'em what you really got
Enter the darkest train yards âWill we come back? We don't know!
On a quest for the best style never surrender. Here we go!

Never give up â we got paint to spill
Raiding the yard â we're out for the kill
Ready to rock â steel heart, iron will
I've got the baddest mission â I'm here to hunt the steel

Ready for the mic check, no turning back, we attack
With a fresh style, desire to set them panels on fire
The track for all my fellow graff-writers come on!
We're back on track like Ruff Riders, come on!
Jump the fence, you've on the whole night on your hands
Or a 3-minute back jump action, step to perfection
Wild style or bubble, sting like a bumble bee
Triple trouble, like a Double Dragon ready to go

Here we go!
Never give up â we got paint to spill
Raiding the yard â we're out for the kill
Ready to rock â steel heart, iron will
I've got the baddest mission â I'm here to hunt the steel
