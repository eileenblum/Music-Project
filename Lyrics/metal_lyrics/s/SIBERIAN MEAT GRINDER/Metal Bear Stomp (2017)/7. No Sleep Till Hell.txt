We left the gates of hell behind, we're spreading the disease
Let them clowns play to please, we release Tsar Killabeez
Looking for the lands to seize, we are planning the new routes
This van is our pirate ship, face the clan, give me the loot
Another flight
Another drive all night
Grab your night
One, two, three â ignite!

We're far from home again
Next night, next show, same van
We're grinding 'til the end
Stick to the master plan â no sleep 'til hell!

They said we'd never make it now we proved the losers wrong
Each and every of our gigs is a brick of concrete in the wall
Of the empire, set them liars on fire
You can't burn my kingdom 'cause I'll burn you first, call me sire

Another flight
Another drive all night
Grab your night
One, two, three â ignite!

We're far from home again
Next night, next show, same van
We're grinding 'til the end
Stick to the master plan â no sleep 'til hell!

Each and every day and night of my life I feel blessed
For this chance to keep it moving like a Tribe Called Quest
Doing our best, blasting rhymes, meeting old and new friends
We know y'all believe in us, so we will pass this test
Don't bite my style, 'cause the thieves have to pay
Say farewell to your arms, the executioner is on his way
The Bell Tolls for you, like that Old Man you've turned grey
I got more stories than Ernest got Hemingway
Siberian Blitz attack, the voice of a generation
Peace to all the homeless people living in a train station
The cult is trying to kill me, not a problem, I'll kill them
And use their liquids to paint the symbols you won't understand

We're far from home again
Next night, next show, same van
We're grinding 'til the end
Stick to the master plan â no sleep 'til hell!
