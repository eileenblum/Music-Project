Day by day, building our empire
It's a trial by fire, I'm demonstrating my style

Take this pill straight outta the Siberian mill
Carefully chosen and grinded for you with all our skill
It will take you on a magic trip are you getting the thrill?
We have to warn you, word is bond, are you feeling that chill?
Two thousand eleven, and this is what's going on
To the break of dawn, 24/7, on and on
Helllspawn, we got together, working like a beast,
Forging our weapon, like blacksmith with the iron firsts

Pa pa pass the microphone
Ta ta ta ta time to reclaim the throne
Da da da da that's right it's our empire
It's a trial by fire I'm demonstrating my style

Soon we hit the road, tour mode, came to the game to stay
Even if you don't want us to play we'll play there anyway
There is no turning back, we are coming with a blast
If you join the pack you're like a brother or sister to us
Siberian Bear Army knows no borders and no fear
A new blood or veteran you know you're always welcome here
We've built this shit together, now you never walk alone
Word is bond, just for the record let it be known

Pa pa pass the microphone
Ta ta ta ta time to reclaim the throne
Da da da da that's right it's our empire
It's a trial by fire I'm demonstrating my style

Boom biddy bye-bye come check my style
We are coming back again so don't touch that dial
Defile your whole city, turn it into a pyre
You're not in Wonderland so don't drink from that vial
Someone in the back went clack clack
Then all hell breaks loose and your body got torn up
By the bear fang meet the Siberian gang
Be careful! If you cross the line you have to pay full price
You'd better scatter we know you're telling lies
We neon demon your squad like Miami Vice
Treading on thin ice, going mad, eating all pies
Just like Muad'Dib made the alliance and got all the spice
That's what we bring-bring give your bling-bling
Bear-Tsar beat your king, bow down, kiss the ring
H.E. double L that spells like "HELL"
We'll fry your bacon for your sins, what's that smell?

Pa pa pass the microphone
Ta ta ta ta time to reclaim the throne
Da da da da that's right it's our empire
It's a trial by fire I'm demonstrating my style
