My flow is brutal like Cannibal Corse's "Vile"
Blessed for the quest, looking for the best style
You're dressed to impress, you pest, I'm dressed to decimate
Fireball, we bomb them all like "Pure Hate"
Too late â we're banging right on your door
Your bodies hit the floor
Told you before
Won by knockout, you know the score

Again and again
One spray can, one microphone and one pen
Bear with the iron hand, it's all planned
I strike the mic and you face the clan

You know how we go â we're waving the black flag
I give you two red pills â it's a reality check
You best protect ya neck, comin' correct
Full speed ahead, run you over, never looking back
Too late â we're banging right on your door
Your bodies hit the floor
Told you before
Won by knockout, you know the score

Again and again
One spray can, one microphone and one pen
Bear with the iron hand, it's all planned
I strike the mic and you face the clan

Here is something you can't understand
Bear Clan can stomp a man
I come from Siberian slum, son, you're done
You and what army? Disarm you, you'd better run
I'm from the Killa Killa Hill, we're the real deal
I'm licensed to ill, son, you got to chill
You are trained gorillas, no will, you just steal
We're the train yard guerrillas with a license to kill the steel.

Too late â we're banging right on your door
Your bodies hit the floor
Told you before
Won by knockout, you know the real score
