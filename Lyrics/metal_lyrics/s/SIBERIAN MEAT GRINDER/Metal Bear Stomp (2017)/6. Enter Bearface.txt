Here we come, here we go, check my bear flow
Can't stop, won't stop, ripping your flesh like a DeathClaw
Disintegrate any foe,
Even if you don't know the chant pretend that you know
Come from afar, death star, hail to the Tsar
This dark place â Siberian Hell, orbits one star
Back on the track, we wreck, protect your neck
Tsar killabees, poser please, it is time to attack
