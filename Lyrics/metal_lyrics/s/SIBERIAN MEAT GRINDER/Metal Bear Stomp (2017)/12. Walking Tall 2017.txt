Whole idea is to crush everything in sight
Running through the night, we fight, you'd better stay inside
No place to hide, sword of the lord
Grinder gonna find you, deny it â you will be gored
My drug music therapeutic to the user
Short fused accuser, abuse you, you're just a loser
Back pack bonfire, we burn the liar
Annihilating enemies, venomous deadly style

We'll break your back, we pack the last straw
Burn the deceiver, deliver the killer blow
Who's got the flavor, who's got the flow
Check my wild style, it's vile, so here we go

Coming back y'all, last call, deadfall, walking tall

You're not a threat, you rat, you just pose
Talking on the Net never ever coming close
Kick in the nose, I'm bashing you with a paw
Saw is the law, eat raw, prepare for war
Sleep is the lie, that' why I never sleep
Staying high on DRI, Wu-tang and Mobb Deep
I stalk the trains like a backstreet creep
Black sheep, get a grip, crack of the whip

We'll break your back, we pack the last straw
Burn the deceiver, deliver the killer blow
Who's got the flavour, who's got the flow
Check my wild style, it's vile, so here we go

Coming back y'all, last call, deadfall, walking tall

Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, evil twin, enemy within
Peel off your skin, I murder the fake MCs
Die on your knees, Mr Freeze, Tsar Killa-bees
Feel no remorse, demonstrate no regret
We're doing it for the crew and for those we won't forget
SMG â false prophets get done
One by one by one by one

We'll break your back, we pack the last straw
Burn the deceiver, deliver the killer blow
Who's got the flavour, who's got the flow
Check my wild style, it's vile, so here we go

Coming back y'all, last call, deadfall, walking tall
