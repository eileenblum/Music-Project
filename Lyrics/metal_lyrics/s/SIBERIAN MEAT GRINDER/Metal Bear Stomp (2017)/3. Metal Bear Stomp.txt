We won't stop
Don't you dare
We go stomp the Metal Bear
Metal Bear Stomp

If you're here, you respect bears, now listen
Hunted by poachers, caught in the circus system
Together we have a chance to stop the bear abuse
It's time to pay the dues

To release the proud beast, break the rusty cage
When I think about bears' pain my heart gets full of rage
It's time to turn the page, wash away the dirt from our name
We can end this shame!

We won't stop
Don't you dare
We go stomp the Metal Bear
Metal Bear Stomp

Cash rules everything around me, cream, we can make the dough
Bring in the green, spread the word, raise some money for
Those who fight for bear rights, who give a helping hand
We can take a stand
Living in a tiny cell against their will, in pain and fear
Grinding down their teeth against the prison bars made of steel
In bile-hell so many bears are being slowly killed
This a realest deal

We won't stop
Don't you dare
We go stomp the Metal Bear
Metal Bear Stomp

It's a world of shit
Together we can make it better
To take some pain away
Step by step making it slowly fade away
Metal Bear Stomp is our open letter
Listen, we hope that you get it
You and I can make that effort
If we join a good 'cause and start today
