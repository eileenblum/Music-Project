[the recurrence of Owl Aided]

may time had to show the way 
across the deep green lake 
the mothergoddess laid til she first awoke 
insubstantial shades 
when darkness began to fade 
the mothergoddess laid til she first awoke 

in grey marshfields in isolated lands 
the mothergoddess slept til she first awoke 
whenever the time is right 
she wakes up and rule the tides 
the mothergoddess completes her final work 

and the feud will last until the end of time 
and the seed will grow until the end of time 
and the old will speak the words of sapient rhymes 
the recurrence of owl aided 
the recurrence of owl aided 
the recurrence of the owl means death
