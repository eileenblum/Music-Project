Diggin' back in time
Images before my eyes
Shivers runnin' down my spine

I've come so far
Livin' just my own life
Thinkin' my own thoughts
Tryin' to overcome the barriers and schemes
Sorrounding my world

Horror of nightmares is blinding my eyes
My dreams are lightning my way
The only way that's leadin' me
Out of this labyrinth

Every time my mind
Flies over the sky
The void seems to fade away
I can't stop the fire

That's burning deep inside of me
Blood running through my veins
Time is right to unleash
The power within

Awake in the darkness
I'm scanning the night
Silent theatre of fears in my mind
Is takin' shape

Desperate cries are calling my name
Wonderin' what is goin' on!

Every time my mind
Flies over the sky
The void seems to fade away
Can't stop the fire

That's burning deep inside of me
Blood running through my veins
Time is right to unleash
The power within

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Every time my mind
Flies over the sky
The void seems to fade away
I can't stop the fire

That's burning deep inside of me
Blood running through my veins
Time is right to unleash

The power within
Dig out your soul!
The power living
Within us all!

I know we can turn the tide
We can turn this world around
Blaze in the night!

Shining light is not so far away from me!
I'm sick of all whiny complaints
I am the master of my fate
Need to find the meaning of my life

The power inside me
The fire is burning
Still burning deep inside me
The blood is running through my veins!

Sleepless night
Thoughts running wild
Hazed childhood memories

Covered by safe bounds
Shuttin' glad sounds
Tunin' my days

I can see her smiling like an angel
Telling stories from her life
Tryin' to warn me of the danger and fights
I'll have to face upon my own
To leave a trace in this world
