A blast of evil from the sky
Has raped the twins and pride
The world is petrified
Everyone wonders why

Black history pages,
New religious chants
Are written down in blood
One more time

The upset man
Stuttering old prayers
And screaming out
"The Rage and The Pride"
Swears blood-revenge!

Heart-wounded remains
Standing alone
Dumb and blind
Lost and unaware!

Can you see we've gone beyond?
The point of no return!
And the innocents keep dying
In the man's endless strife

The world running fast
Unequal and unfair

Heart wounded man remains
Lost standing alone
Dumb and blind and unaware

An ash cloud is falling,
Falling down
To cover the eyes
Wide in disbelief

The eyes of the wild world
That we live in
Mirror of souls
In grief and pain

Fight, kill and destroy
Seek out the enemy
And root out the evil

Crawling around
Creeping into you
And burning inside

The heart-wounded man
Standing alone
Dumb and blind and unaware

An ash cloud is falling,
Falling down
To cover the eyes
Wide in disbelief

The eyes of the wild world
We all live in
Mirror of souls
In grief and pain

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Angels without wings are falling
Heroes honor the wounded flag
Illusions are burning again
In the fire of hatred
The flames keep rising

While the wonded pride
Blows on the winds of war
Eye for eye
Weâve got blind

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Can you see we've gone beyond?
The point of no return!
And the innocents keep dying
In the man's endless strife

The world running fast
Unequal and unfair
Was suddenly awaken
While blindly forging ahead

Has fallen into a nightmare
Of hatred and pain
Rage and decay
Losing the way, again

An ash cloud is falling,
Falling down
To cover the eyes
Wide in disbelief

The eyes of the wild world
That we live in
Mirror of souls
In grief and pain [Repeat]

Hatred and pain
Rage and decay
Losing the way
