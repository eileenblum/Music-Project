Gate to prophetic tales
Of pyramids to tell
The power of sunlight
And stars in the sky

Millenniums gone by
Mankind's lookin' far
Destroying everything
Is standing in his way

STORMRAGE - defacing what we call progress
REACTION - waiting no more!
EARTHQUAKES - shakin' what we take for granted
WARNINGS - the final countdown to extinction is going' on!

Wake up!
Right now!
Look up at the sky
Maybe the stars will show us the right way

New dawn
Will come
When we'll learn to fight
Greed and pride still rulin' the world

STORMRAGE - defacing what we call progress
REACTION - waiting no more!
EARTHQUAKES - shakin' what we take for granted
WARNINGS - the final countdown to extinction is going' on!

Clever minds
Hunting glory and might
Over great enterprises
You are deaf to planet's cries

So unite
Before eternal night falls
It's time for a change
To save the world!

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Blaze of colors can daze
And leave you at gaze
The wonders of nature!

It's time to heal
Madness before it's too late
To realize that our fate
Hangs in the balance
We are drawing to a close!

Now!
We're losing our mind
It's our time
To open the eyes
Signs coming from the sky!

STORMRAGE - defacing what we call progress
REACTION - waiting no more!
EARTHQUAKES - shakin' what we take for granted
WARNINGS - the final countdown to extinction is going' on!

Clever minds
Hunting glory and might
Over great enterprises
You are deaf to planet's cries

So unite
Before eternal night falls
1) The echoes of prophecies are pounding my head
2) The ghost of apocalipse blowin' in the air
3) It's time for a change to save the world!
