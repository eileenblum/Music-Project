There's a light over the sky
A light inside our heart
That never goes out
And will shine on and on

Through this dreadful and cold night
May this light within our wounded souls
Heal us now and make us whole again
May this light bring us peace and love
On this sacred land
Mother Earth
Father Sky
Fire and Water give protection

To our lives and to those sacrificed
For the freedom to last
Forever more
