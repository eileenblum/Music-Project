Look at the sunrise
The fresh light seepin'
Into your eyes again
Tell me all
What you have to tell me
Just take my heart!

Can you remenber
When we were
A power together
Goin' from one
Victory to another
I'm sure this tie will never die!

What I've thought so far
Changes with my life
And the people that sorround me
Just transience of things

Watch the fallin' rain
It's not anymore the same
I will take it day by day
Whatever comes my way

Fly away over this time
Over this promised land
Where eagles and sea meet the sky

'cause nothing's forever, I know
Only memories remain
As stars in the darkest night

Look at the horizon
We're free from the prison
Of worries and pain
Dreaming some day
To arrive till up there,
Everywhere!

Can you remember
We wanted to master
Whatever
Just faint illusions or
Clear lively visions
But why did we leave that way?

What I've thought so far
Changes with my life
And the people that sorround me
Just transience of things

Watch the fallin' rain
It's not anymore the same
I will take it day by day
Whatever comes my way

Fly away over this time
Over this promised land
Where eagles and sea meet the sky

'cause nothing's forever, I know
Only memories remain
As stars in the darkest night

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Look it's the sunset
The shadows are warning
the night is close
It's time to reset
There's no time for regret
I'm aware!

Can you remember
That saying goes
"Nothing's forever"?
Memories live on
Seem to fade but you know
Our tie will never die!

What I've thought so far
Changes with my life
And the people that sorround me
Just transience of things

Watch the fallin' rain
It's not anymore the same
I will take it day by day
Whatever comes my way

Fly away over this time
Over this promised land
Where eagles and sea meet the sky

'cause nothing's forever, I know
Only memories remain
I want to

Fly away over this time
Over this promised land
Where eagles and sea meet the sky

'cause nothing's forever, I know
Only memories remain
We need to 

Fly away again
Fly away over this time
I know only memories remain
As stars in the darkest night
