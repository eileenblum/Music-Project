Day by day
Growin' rage
Goin' insane

Hysteria is now spreading
Defing the self-control
The evil seed has found fertile ground
Confused state of mind
Diverting the guide line
Without rhyme or reason
A shout is giving for despair

Fire! from hell will carry on
Out of forseen plans
Feeding rage and sorrow
Burnin' wounded souls

The harmony of the universe
Going to a slow reverse
Till the end of time

Countagious fear
Confusion and decay
Make the chaos real
And leave just deragement, yeah
Losing all directions
Losing heart and way
Searching for protection
Against the deceits of tomorrow

Itâs when everything seems so calm
Too sure of today and tomorrow
That's when everything comes so cruel

Fire! from hell will carry on
Out of forseen plans
Feeding rage and sorrow
Burnin' wounded souls

The harmony of the universe
Going to a slow reverse
Till the end of time

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Anguished looks reveal
Languished mood of fear
War is callin' your name

Human tragedy
Printed in the eyes
Children playin' soldiers
Ready to die

Fire! from hell will carry on
Out of forseen plans
Feeding rage and sorrow
Burnin' wounded souls

The harmony of the universe
Going to a slow reverse
Till the end of time

Fire! from the hell
Burning day by day
World is falling down

The whole universe
Goinâ to a slow reverse
Till the end of time
Hysteria!
