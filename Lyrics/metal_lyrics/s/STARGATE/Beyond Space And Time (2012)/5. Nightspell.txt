Level sounds
I feel like I'm in a weird time
A lovin' glance seizin' me
Have you lived in my life?

Over sounds
I'll take you through my past life
Through your eyes I'll see
If you will live in my life

My head is in a whirl
My eyes are flashing with fear

Lost in a dream
Beyond space and time
Over the hills and far away
You can widen the horizon
You can find the way
Come with me i love your soul
But i'll never hold you

Inside my mind
Clashin' thoughts
Echoin' sounds
Fire is meltin' ice
I'm feeling so high

Lost in a dream
Beyond space and time
Over the hills and far away
You can widen the horizon
You can find the way
Come with me i love your soul
But i'll never hold you

You'll be my blood
Until this spell will break
Keep close to me
Until something will wake me

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Lost in a dream
Beyond space and time
Over the hills and far away
You can widen the horizon
You can find the way
Come with me i love your soul
But i'll never hold you

You'll be my blood
Until this spell will break
Keep close to me
Until something will wake me... up
