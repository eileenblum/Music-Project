Have you ever screamed in anger
Facing battles without guns?
The night is calling
And blinding my eyes

Looking for a valid reason
As I lay awake in bed
Black frozen tears
Keep on flowing down my face

I am falling to pieces
Lost in the night
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my mind

Walking down the nonsense way
I struggle through the crowd
Waiting for someone to wake me
I'm kneeling on the ground

I am falling to pieces this time
Iâm carried by the tide
I'm sinking deep into sorrow

Blinded by the sands of time
Fading seasons walking in my mind
Through the pain i'll gain new strenght
No way to escape the fate
No one's to blame

[INSTRUMENTAL]

I feel your spirit by my side
I want your memory to never die
The ones you loved seem to be older
Liferules more painful then tears
I'm shedding over your gravestone
My grey rain year's going by
My soul escaping from sorrow
I'm waiting for a new dawn
To give new hope and to shine on

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Ever since I can remember
Livin' in the fast lane
Waitin' for sunrise
New lease on life

Falling rain from heaven
Walking in the light
Stairway to the stars
Growing power to fight

I'll gather the pieces this time
Facing the tide of life
For a better tomorrow

Blinded by the sands of time
Fading seasons walking in my mind
Through the pain i'll gain new strenght
No way to escape the fate
No one's to blame

Blinded by the sands of time
Fading seasons walking in my mind

Time passing by

I raise my head up to the sky
Stare at the sun shining bright
Through the pain i'll gain new strenght
No way to escape the fate
No one's to blame
