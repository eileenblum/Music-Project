Here we are, here and now
We're the chosen ones
We have got the front row tickets
Ready for the greatest show

We can share the new creation
Of the human race
The rise of conscience while
The age of greed and power 
Is fading away

This is the time we were waiting!

Waiting for! The celestial bodys
And stars to be aligned
The dark way, cloud of star dust
To the heart of universe

Dragging down into the black hole
Back to the great mother
The place where we were born
The one where we will die!
We are losing the way

What we call reality is fading away!
The fourth sun is going down

Warning signs from the sky
This is not the real paradise
A new beginning for mankind
The fight to reverse Entropy!

Afraid of the unknown
It's time now to realize
The light inside is getting stronger
We are ready to cross the Dark Rift!

The emptyness,
where nothing takes the place,
where only the shamans
could find the truth

Over this hologram
That we feel as real life
Chaos burning worry souls
The last death throes
Are running away!

This is the time we were waiting for!
The new Age of Aquarius!

Warning signs from the sky
This is not the real paradise
A new beginning for mankind
The fight to reverse Entropy!

Afraid of the unknown
It's time now to realize
The light inside is getting stronger
We are ready to cross the Dark Rift!

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Warning signs from the sky
This is not the real paradise
A new beginning for mankind
The fight to reverse Entropy!

Afraid of the unknown
It's time now to realize
The light inside is getting stronger
We are ready to go

Across the Dark Rift
The open gate to a parallel world
Now we're ready to reach
The great mother's heart

So we can get its wealth,
Without limiting beliefs
Let's revive the power of innocence
It will harmonize all
With the beat of the great mother

Signs from the sky!

We are afraid of the unknown
This is not the real paradise
The light inside is getting stronger
Now it's time to realize
We are ready it's time to cross
the Dark Rift!
