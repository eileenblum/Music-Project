Time was his dwelling
Seasons his gods
Life a fierce warrior
Death his most sacred ritual within the fire
And within his chants
His quest, wisdom
His rest, his journey
Where he lived, these chants symbolized abundance
And the woman, renewal and respect
He lives where all legends begin

Here is the story of this legend, that of the shaman

Oh shaman, spirit of the forest
Sage among all sages
Your people live through you
Through your eyes...

O shaman...
Worshiper of the eagle
Of pure convictions in your beleifs
Take my hand, take me where those who love
Through your eyes
Become one sole being

Show me the lakes where your ancestors were bathed
In order to be marked by your sign
Show me mountains of the north
Prairies of the south, horizons from the west to the east
Show me your flesh...

Your people were and will be noble in my heart
Your blazing name still and forever keeps my dream
Of your savage domain
O dream of crystal, the leaves, entwined
Remain the sole trace of your mark
