"Dark symbol you release the spirits"
Spirits that ravage the sky and the earth
That ravage my dwelling
Spirits that devastate with the power of giants
Demons similar to mad bulls
Shameful spectres in their image
I see their hate against humanity
Against all beliefs, holy or occult
They spray the gos with a rain of blood
Whether are gods or not

Black talisman
By the power of the gods
We exorcize you
Black talisman
That shadow that fertilize the seeds
Mate under the moon

I am weary of always plundering the cemeteries
To find still fluid blood there
Fallen souls at the bottom of the ancient tombs
The paths to immortality are harder to enter than to find

Spirits tht ravage the sky and the earth
That ravage my dwelling
The crows are mocking holiness or possesion
Curse them, curse beliefs and fanaticism
