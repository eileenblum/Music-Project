"I disown you, you and against you
You gave me life, my mother, my father
I disown you, you and against you
I'm the door, light of beyond

Paradise or hell, I will only know it once
I've passed them all
I didn't ask anything
Now the true face, the rain of darkness
It's my face
I didn't have the time to see the light of the day
Hell, I will only know it once

Hate is so sweet when it's animated
By shame and vengeance
All the things that I had to learn
Were stolen
I prosternate myself...
The angels already come to demand their dues

O, I implore you, I don't know anything of this
A world, my world opens up to me

Is it hell or a sweet melody of melancoly?
Time belongs, only to the ones that participate
I am what I am
Is it hell or a sweet melody of melancholy?
Time belongs, only to the ones that participate
I am what I am

"You, child born in blood
In the flesh of the flesh of the cradle
Will be the one of the kingdom of death
And your mother: the false
And your brothers: the other you
