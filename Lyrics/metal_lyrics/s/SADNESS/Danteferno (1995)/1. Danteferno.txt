Can't cry, can't try, can not repent
Can't cry, can't try, can not repent
Can't cry, can't try, can not repent

When I look back on our misery
And all the pain it has brought me
I think of life as a cesspool of fate
We mess up our souls, with our hate
When I look back on our misery
And all the pain it has brought me
I can't forgive, rest my soul and let it be

I can't cry, can not try
I can't try, can not cry
I can't say, can not stay
I can't stay, can not say
I can't give, can not live
I can't live in despair
