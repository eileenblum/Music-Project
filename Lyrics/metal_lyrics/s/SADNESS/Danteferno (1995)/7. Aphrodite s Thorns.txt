Erotic fantasies: aphrodite of cnide and aries
As mystic as a glimmer at the bottom of a lake
Sensuality of your figure, of your white body

White dove or dark crow?

The temptations of these acts change the being, from the beast
to...
To the lamb
But if you touch her, she will cut your veins and dive her
hand
Deep down in your soul to spread it over your face

Sweet venus, in power of an immense veil beyond the borders of
Death, seduces men with her charm and elegance
Pleasure of lust, she is also the sweetness of the flower
blinding the
Insect that comes to take her nectar

O the pleasure is so swet in aprodite's thorns, but if you
touch
Her... she will cut your veins
