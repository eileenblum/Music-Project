The night on the shore a pure girl dreams. She watches the
fall, towards the east. High up in the night, while the preda-
tor clouds of the evening announce their fury, black oppressi-
ve masses, darken her vision of infinity. The stars guide your
destiny. Follow them for ever into an oblivion; follow them to
dream of infinity; follow them to die happily; follow them to
dry all your tears; tears that beleive in their death. Aren't
the stars eternal? They reign for ever like queens. They show
her their paths. Forget, I'm leaving for their destinations,
for infinity.
