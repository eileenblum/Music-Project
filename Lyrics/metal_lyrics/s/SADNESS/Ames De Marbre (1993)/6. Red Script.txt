Oh yes, she was again, misery and mistery. Yes, it was her
again and this time, I was sure about it. Yes she has struck
again. Seeing that spectacle of desolation in front of me, the
victim, his heart pulled out divoured. Yes, it was her again
and this time. I was sure about it.

My darling, my love, before no, no, no, no... (bis)...

The cloakroom was not dark anymore. Candles, were burning
there, thousands of candles. I had to stop her, I had to stop
her. Suddenly the room began to spin and became white. My head
was still spinning, my vision was still shocked. She was wai-
ting for me! Waiting to use, all her power...
No pain, but a terrible horror. Worse, much worse than pain. A
chasm of regret and extreme affliction gobbles itself up in
the depths of... me. She gently climbed up along my spine to
suck up my life in a last kiss. Oh, yes, in a last kiss.
