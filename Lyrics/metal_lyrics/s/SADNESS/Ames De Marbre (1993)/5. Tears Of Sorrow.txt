Listen to me, let yourself be bewitched by the sound of my
voice. Join my kingdom of light. Listen to me, listen to my
voice.

Under the dark clouds of may, a leaf slips over your face,
spring of love for tears of sorrow. Red eyes that wait for you
for such a long time under the moon light. I know that you'll
come, in spite of you... after all...
Don't try to know why, do you envy the destiny, statues that
never meet, that never touch?

[chorus]

Ne cherche pas â¦ savoir pourquoi, envies-tu le destin des
statues qui jamais ne se rencontrent, qui jamais ne se tou-
chent? Sous les sombres nuages de mai, une feuille glisse sur
ton visage.

[chorus]

Regarde-moi, regarde-moi, regarde-moi vainc ta peur âtrange,
tapie au fond de toi, ferme tes yeux et entrouve moi ton coe-
ur.

Look at me, overcome your strange fear deep down within your-
self, close your eyes and open your heart to me. You didn't
beleive me, but what matters, wether you want it or not, we
threw a stone bridge between our two souls and the blood that
united us flows under the arch... I'll be able to cross it
when the time comes an clear a way to your heart. Under the
dark clouds of november a dead leaf slips over my cheek and
wipes my tears of sorrow, my tears of sorrow.
