[Written by: L. Rutledge &amp; W. Dane]

Steel eyes stare back at you
Held by his gaze he's healed you
Gripped by terror for now you see
The talisman shall hold the key

The blind prophet shall breathe fire
Foretelling dreams of past
And visions of your death
He lies shackled in the mire
And beckons to your cries
Dreaming of your dreams

Corrupt eyes filled with hate
Their greedy souls opened
Hell's gate
The crosses mirror his growing rage
They've breached this keep
He's fled his cage

So I bring black plague to you
Lightning congeals to kill you
Relentless screams call unto me
We are the soldiers of steel

The blind jackal of remorse
Has chosen you as pawn
And seized your crippled mind
Blue eyes glowing slammed the door
And killed the silence we once knew
Deliverer of mankind

Still I will seek the truth
The pious one can never rule
Prophetic visions are now shown clear
Upon the wall "I will be free"

So I bring black plague to you
Lightning congeals to kill you
Relentless screams call unto me
We are the soldiers of steel

So I bring black plague unto your world
