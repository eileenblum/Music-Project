âAs she stood atop the mountain the serpents began their agenda... as they surround her, treasuring her embraceâ

So the word came from above, all of us shall burn
Sewn of ash and circumstance, victims never learn

Judgment comes and judgment swift purifies the herd
Thinning out the weak and vain, hypocrites and bastards

Revelation is so surreal, let the serpent follow me

In the end no flesh remains, only bitter words
Glorify the ignorant, the murderous detractors

Revelation is so surreal, let the serpent follow me
Realization is what you need, let the serpent follow me

Edging closer, closer to the end of time
Blindly follow; the leader will provide for all mankind

Revelation is so surreal, let the serpent follow me
Realization is what you need, let the serpent follow me

This is the final suture, this is the curtain call
No want for happy endings, our backs against the wall
Make me whole again, glorify original sin
