âThe ruin and decay had begun.
The children, the soldiers made of clay gathered at her kneesâ

Exitium bring us peace within the ruin
Grant us this release
Our tongues are falling away

We are the chosen children
Soldiers turn to clay
Gone are the golden wings of gossamer
And the circumstance of decay

We cry for sweet Lenore
Gone away
Shall I slam the door
Or is this the beginning?

Bold are the brazen drones that mold and violate
Change is the unattained
The goal we seek has withered alone and afraid

We cry and plead for war
Gone astray
Man's greed has damned us all
The anthem of the living

Lenore has been chosen
She is the leader
We shall follow her blindly
But beware the rabbit hole is deep

We cry for sweet Lenore
Gone away
Shall I slam the door?
Withered alone and afraid

We cry and plead for war
Gone astray
Man's greed has damned us all
The anthem of the living

This is the ending of all time
This is our exitium
These are our last words, our last songs
This is our swansong
I am the last revolution
Turn me backward and bastardize me
