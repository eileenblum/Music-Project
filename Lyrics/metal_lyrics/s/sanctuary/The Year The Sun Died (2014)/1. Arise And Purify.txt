âIn the beginning there was nothing to give humanity hope, and then she was born...
As she ascended into power, her words, her messages became legend... as did her visions of the death of our sun...â

We are unchanged, we are forgotten
Born of the blessed and the sick, we are the rotten ones
Trust in me and all your sorrows
Count your blessings, die tomorrow

Arise and purify
Subjugate and justify
Erase and adjudicate
Leader of the masses
Free the storm

They are the strange within the fallen
Born of the lecherous and sick, the plague is calling
Mind the rules that can't be broken
Through hollow days and words unspoken

Arise and purify
Subjugate and justify
Erase and adjudicate
Leader of the masses
Free the proles

Arise and purify
Subjugate and justify
Erase and adjudicate
Leader of the masses
Free the storm

Arise and purify
Subjugate and justify
Erase and adjudicate
Leader of the masses
Free the Proles

Arise, purify
Arise, purify
Arise, purify
