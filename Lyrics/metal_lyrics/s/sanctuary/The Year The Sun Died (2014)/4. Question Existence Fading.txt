âAs the sun began its slow beautiful fade, the false prophets questioned her visions and the code within her bloodâ

Plague decimation of the day, this world slides into decay
No voice in silence, walk in streaks unknown
Evidence is clear, revolution of the meek is near
Blood code and god are gone, this is the last song

Burn out the days, burn out the sun
Question the only reason
Black are the dregs humanity slays
Question existence fading

Alone we walk the hollow hills
Contempt has breached our sense of will
Take blood but not my soul, some ground is hallowed
Dominate the weak among the damned
Bring truth to the sons of man
Count to ten and see your fate and fall into disgrace

Burn out the days, burn out the sun
Question the only reason
Black are the dregs humanity slays
Question existence fading

The reprehension of cold redemption is gone
This alienation song brings us further
To the truth and the games
We fall into the blame and we fail once again

Burn out the days, burn out the sun
Question the only reason
Black are the dregs humanity slays
Question existence fading

Can you solve the blood code?
Can you solve the code?
Can you solve the blood code?
