âThe rise of technology was blamed for many things.
The seers had been blinded by something unknown.
The power had become uncontrollable.â

What am I supposed to be? Is this the trial?
Self-deprecation leads to denial
Can you hear the message overplayed
As they hide behind the sun?
Can you feel the future preordained
For time waits for no man

What are we supposed to think when the world is wired?
How are we supposed to feel when we fall in the fire?
Can you hear the message overplayed
As they hide behind the sun?
Can you feel the future preordained
For time waits for no man

Here we are again within this conundrum
Bathed in a blanket of light
Some say there is truth here
And the only chosen seers are blind
Bathed in a blanket of light
