âThe message of doom had come to fruition, and she commanded the soldiers to preach her wordsâ

Don't fear the right from wrong, don't fear the final song
Only the distant echoes, our past mistakes
Lenore bleeds for our sins
Time ticks, the world spins
Only to see the answers slipping through our hands and trickle down

Sworn to believe
To feast on purity
Sworn to believe

Sworn to believe
To feast on purity
Sworn to believe

The prophet said unto her sheep
âA lesson learned is a lesson deepâ
If only all earth's creatures could understand this game
Forget your troubles and follow me
Take time to forgive with sympathy
Only then will you see the end is nothing more than fate and troubling pain

Sworn to believe, deny and deceive
And pray to your god, the sun
