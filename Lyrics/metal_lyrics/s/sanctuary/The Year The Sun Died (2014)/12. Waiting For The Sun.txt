[originally by The Doors]At first flash of Eden
We race down to the sea
Standing there on freedom's shore

Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun

Can you feel it
Now that Spring has come
That it's time to live in the scattered sun

Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun.
Waiting for the sun
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting

Waiting for you to come along
Waiting for you to hear my song
Waiting for you to come along
Waiting for you to tell me what went wrong

This is the strangest life I've ever known
[scream]

Can you feel it
Now that Spring has come
That it's time to live in the scattered sun.

Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
