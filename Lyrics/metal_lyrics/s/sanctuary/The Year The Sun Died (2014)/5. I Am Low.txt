âDepression set in among the proles.
They began to sing in quiet tones building into a maelstromâ

I am low tonight and the truth is the same
Out in grey tomorrow within this brief space of elegance
I am low

The creator seems bitter and strange
If we pray through these hopeless and endless days
Will Morpheus take us far away?
When nothing is clear, there is nothing to fear
There is nothing left to follow
When contradiction has killed all our hope
There is nothing between me and the end of a rope

I am high today, but I still feel the shame
If I fly tomorrow, will anyone remember my worthless name?
If we conquer the years and fight through the tears
There is nothing that can stand in our way
Nothing can stand in our way
And nothing can make the world go away
Nothing can stand in our way, in our way

Nothing can stand in our way
And nothing can make the world go away
Nothing can stand in our way, in our way

Make the time to feel alone again
The river flows and the world is so low
