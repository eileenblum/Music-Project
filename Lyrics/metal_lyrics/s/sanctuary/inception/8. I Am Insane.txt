Throw away the key and lock the door
Insanity inside my head returns once more
I cannot see, the real world is gone
Asylum for the twisted is my home

Deep in your heart there's the secret you hide
Deception is eating your mind
Frustrated yearnings, unusual drives
Released in deviant rhyme

Inside my brain
I am insane
Inside my brain
I am insane

I can't survive in this living hell
Take me away to my padded cell
The white coats sneer and they call me liar
Straight jacket bound, my little brain is fried

Society's nightmare has unleashed its kind
The torment of moral decline
A victim of hatred you live on the line
Locked up safe with your own kind

Inside my brain
I am insane
Inside my brain
I am insane

Deep in your heart there's the secret you hide
Deception is eating your mind
Frustrated yearnings, unusual drives
Released in deviant rhyme

Inside my brain
I am insane
Inside my brain
I am insane

Cry out in pain
I'm a faceless name
Inside my brain
I am insane
