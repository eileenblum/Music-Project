I come to you in dreams and drill you slowly
I give the gift of sacred sex to you

I am incubus
Obsessed by lust

No escape or sanctuary found

Nightmares in the dark can penetrate you
I manifest desire in the night
Copulation burning deep inside you
And his love is dripping down your thighs

I am incubus
Obsessed by lust

No escape or sanctuary found

Incubus
One fatal thrust

Will make you feel the fire in my grind

Writhing sweating flesh surrounds your body
Screaming pain but nothing you can do
I suck your mind you blow my head I'm cumming
Violent thrashing tearing you in two

I am incubus
Obsessed by lust

No escape or sanctuary found

Incubus
One fatal thrust

Will make you feel the fire in my grind

Came to you in dreams and drill you slowly
I give the gift of sacred sex to you

I am incubus
Obsessed by lust

No escape or sanctuary found
