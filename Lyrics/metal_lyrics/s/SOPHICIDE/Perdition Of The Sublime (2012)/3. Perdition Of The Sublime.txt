Unseen, obscure
Unveil the unknown
Darkness creeping in unseen
Look now black earth
Dark clouds enfold
Blackout lifeforms
Gifted with reason
Silent perdition
This plague, this curse
pestilence comes forth
Sickness creeping in unseen
Disease embraces sane mind
Sane life, will leave bleak minds
Dead souls and void
See how dark clouds enfold to bring demise and death to mind
No one fears a still disease
no one will find and realize this is demise of sanity virus of apathy
Death will embrace our souls, drown our heads in emptiness
Spiraling to the ground
Into equilibrium
Sickness creeping in the unseen
Perdition will come for the sublime
Existence is destined to fade into meaninglessness
