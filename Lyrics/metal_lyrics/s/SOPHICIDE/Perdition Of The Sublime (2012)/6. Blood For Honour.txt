Feel the chaste blade of atonement
Bringing this life to an end
Thou shalt bleed out all your sin
In eternal fire you'll dwell
Restore what you've defiled
Purify and rid it of stanis and wash our honour clean
With your blood
The defiler has defamed our value system
Has become a filthy whore of western civilization
This is my sacred obligation
Death to the traitor!
Holy virtues disrespected
Now it's taking its toll
This is my sacred obligation, death to the traitor!
See the sword glistening crimson gold red and pure
Taste the sweet fruits of vengeance
Honour's regained
Restore what you've defiled
Purify and rid it from stains and wash hour honour clean
With your blood
