Tearing up a vacant mind
Make it weak and vulnerable
Suck it dry from bliss and content
Mind's prepared for mental abuse
Souls - relinquish your souls!
Minds - surrender your minds!
Your worthless lives
Forever shall be mine
We wash brains
Eviscerate lives
Our lucre, your demise
We leverage the endless ignorance of man
This is global scam
Create insane, absurd ideas
Preposterous beliefs
Souls - relinquish your souls!
Minds - surrender your minds!
Your worthless lives...
