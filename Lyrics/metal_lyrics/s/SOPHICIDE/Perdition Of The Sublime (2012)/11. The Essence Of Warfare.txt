Smoke fills this field of death
Blurring my sight
Only fear is left
Nothing can lead me through this hell
Scorched earth and flesh everywhere
The smell of decay ascending to the sky
Forward march to death!
Got insane through agony
Living to kill
Life deprived of value
Dignity condemned to death
See humans exterminate themselves
This warfare knows no grace
Torment, the essence of warfare
Pale, empty face of death
Blew me a kiss
Life abandons me
Coldness fills the void
Consciousness slowly fading
Sight blacks out
Everything is lost
Life passing by in time lapse
My fate is sealed
Was this worth it?
