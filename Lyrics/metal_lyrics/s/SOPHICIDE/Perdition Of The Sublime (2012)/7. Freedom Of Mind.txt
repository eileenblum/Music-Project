Seeking the path of righteousness becomes obsolete as truth and meaning are internalized in golden pages
We find ourselves in unknowing consciousness
Feel so lost in essential questions of our lives
Longing for a transcendental purpose
We will believe what we are told
Blister insight as it is sin
Do not unveil the truth
Deadlocked our minds
Thou shalt not question eternal truth
What has humanity become?
Fallen from elite to a sad charade
Still we cherish archaic and obsolete values
Blister insight
Do not unveil the truth
Deadlocked our minds
Thou shalt not question eternal truth
