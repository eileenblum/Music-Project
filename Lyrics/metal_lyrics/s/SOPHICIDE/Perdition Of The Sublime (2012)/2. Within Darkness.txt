Frantic worship
Bow in trance
Repeatedly the voice of pure submission
Appalling sight
Perpetual the willingness to kill infidels
No more - no more blind devotion to this untruth
Start to think and stop believing
No more - no more misery and murder in the name of God
Time to leave this behind
Time to see we must head for humanity, not your deity
Seek for enlightenment within darkness
Mind infected, soul diseased
Spreading like a mental parasite
Slaves to a lie
Lies that bind shall not guide us the way
No more - no more blind devotion to this untruth
Start to think and stop believing
No more - no more slavery and bondage of the weakened minds
Time to leave this behind
Time to see we must head for humanity, not your deity
Seek for enlightenment within darkness
Mind submerged in false delusions
No more untruth
