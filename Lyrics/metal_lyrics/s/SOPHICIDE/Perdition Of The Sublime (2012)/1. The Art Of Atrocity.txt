Mankind breathing heinousness
Fills their lungs with apathy
Slaughtering all rationality
Blinded by lack of judgement
Reason begging, mercy lacking
Mechanical violence, sick normality
Life becoming valueless
Act by habit
People kill and wash their sins away with blood
When hardness reigns above us all
Humans practice inhumanity
Systemic life devaluation
Our cruel ways - countless days of atrocity
Mercy butchered
Mute the inner voice of reason
Arrogant mankind
Pride comes before a fall
The idiot pastor preaches sick morality
Submissive minds stop to think and start conforming to their God
When madness reigns above us all
Humans practice inhumanity
Systematic life devaluation
Our cruel ways - countless days of atrocity
