Tree of knowledge bears rotten fruits
Wisdom lies stained and decayed
No one will bother when sophicide is a victim-less crime
In the sea of ignorance
Drifting away from our minds
Given up the struggle
Ready to sink into apathy
Born - we're born to consume and conform
Dawn - a new age is now due to come
Once free in spirit, now bound in chains
Veil of mist covering the light within
Free your spirit, break your chains
Cast off the veil, unleash the light within!
Born - we're born to consume and conform
Dawn - a new age is now due to come
