Enchained, imprisoned, abused, deprived of all dignity
Countless accusations beyond sanity and reason
Godless, deceiver, defiled, insane heretic
Hear the accusations
Feel the cruel hands of vengeance
No, cast out demons of dissent
I am heresy
No, no God dwells within me
My soul's destined to burn
Endless hell fire
Endless clerical retribution
This is execration
This is soul purification
No, cast out demons of dissent
I am heresy
No, no God dwells within me
My soul, my soul's destined to burn
No, cast out demons of dissent
I am heresy
No, no God dwells within me
Burn!
