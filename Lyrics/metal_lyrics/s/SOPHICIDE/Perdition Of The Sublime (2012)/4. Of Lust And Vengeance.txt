Behold thy ruler
Behold the wickedness arise
Yet I shalt be banned
Till I ascend from the abyss
The chains of reason will no longer withhold
Madness will unleash me
Summon me from my cage
Feel fury rise within me
Spawns of despair
The urge ascends in me
The lust for vengeance is within
Cast down thy ruler
This wickedness shalt cease
Ruler of the kingdom
Tyrant of the servile
Thou shalt oppress no more
