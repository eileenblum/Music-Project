The scars in the wind
Guiding my path to the dark
The breath of the silent night
Approaching from a distance

Wings

I cut a thousand cuts
Streams run (down) along my arms
stars blasted into darkness
Strange scents, colours

Catch!

The sleepless eyes
Sterilized by drops of pride
Skies... mirror... screams
Shapes foundering into the scene

Wings

Hate in my heart
Revenge in my mind and my words
I rinse my hair in blood
And mock at your lousy God

I cut a thousand cuts
Streams run (down) along my arms
Oh the scars in the wind...!
Guiding my pathway on my ride

Catch death

The sleepless eyes
