[INSTRUMENTAL]

Oulu, 1st of October, 1995

So here it is. The shadow from our past. Namely
our debut album "Shadows Of The Past", for the first
time available for the worldwide distribution.
This album is far from the musical path we are
venturing at the present, but it is in deed a fair
document from the twilight of SENTENCED.
As a special addition for the request of many fans we
have included the "Journey To Pohjola" demo from '92.
Everything is re-packaged and re-mastered.
This is Death Metal! I hope you can sense its true
spirit right here, right now... Let us gather our hearts in
the dark and cold...

On behalf of SENTENCED,
Taneli Jarva
