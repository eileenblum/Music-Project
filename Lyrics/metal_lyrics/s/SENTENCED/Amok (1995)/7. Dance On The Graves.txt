[music: Tenkula &amp; SENTENCED, pathos: TJ]

Walpurgisnacht, uh oh
A pleasing form of life
Let it begin on my end
Let those see who it was
(He's a rager)

They don't know what sacrifice
They don't know what's in those eyes

Destroys our poor little fire
Finish the year of the capricorn
Begin the year of the lamb
(To your slaughter)

They don't know what sacrifice
They don't know what's in those eyes

Hell I can't deny it
I fell to the illusion of life
Now, she's taken away everything
That I called I

Dance on my grave lil siztah
You make me leave
Yeah you took my life

Dance on my grave lil siztah
You sold my heart
And you left me dying

Dance on my grave lil siztah
You took my life
And you make me feel alive

Dance on my grave lil siztah
You make me leave
And you make me die
