Yes, I am here
Here at the landscape of my dreams 
And what's this perfection? 
I feel immortality next to me 
I have lived my life in your arms, mother 
now I'm back to show my gratitude 
Take my life, I know that I'm worth of you 
And I'll live again and I will live 
through the Elk! 

Now speak, Serpent, with my tongue 
tell them what you think 
infiltrate the venom in their veins. 
Brother Wolf, take my mind, use my hands for thee 
and lead the way to Hall-up-high - take their lives 
Take back what is yours! 
I've set this sacrifice 
(And now we dance 
here in this circle of flames 
We praise Your Might 
We praise Your power to live) 

Fresh as the North Wind 
You blow right to my heart 
Warm as the South Breeze 
my blood now covers the sand 
and on we die!

We have lived our lives in your arms, mother 
Now we're back show our gratitude 
Take our lives, if you think we're worth of you 
and we will live again among the sheep. 
as the Wolves! 

Now speak, Hedgehog, with my tongue 
tell them what you want 
and take revenge for a million lives 
Sister Swan, spread thy wings, your enemies are mine 
and let live those who are worth of you 
taste our minds
