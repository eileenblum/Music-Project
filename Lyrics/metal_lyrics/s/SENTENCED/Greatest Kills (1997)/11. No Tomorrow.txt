Eyes without light can see so clear
what those with sight are blind to...
The final fight is getting near
And they were right, we will lose...
Come this far no turning back
A kiss before it all turns black
My stars have fallen from the sky
My dreams have faded into the Night
No Tomorrow
not for me
Pain and Sorrow
all I see
All I feel
The final night is getting near...
The fading light - weall be through
For the first time I'm feeling fear
And oh, damn right - we will lose
The shadows growing deep
We'll be gone eternally
Our stars have fallen from the sky
Our dreams have faded into the Night
No Tomorrow
not for us
Death and Sorrow
dust to dust
Dust to Dust
