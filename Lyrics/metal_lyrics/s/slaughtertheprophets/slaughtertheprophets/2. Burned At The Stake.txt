Your kind comes to my home
Begging for my ear in vain
Apply Occam's razor and dismiss you
As dumb or insane
Still you stand there smiling
How could I not see before?
Critical thought and logic
Have exiled me from my savior...
Rescind your scripture
Fuck your god
Only weak pathetic papists seek salvation from above
Still your false ideals continue to enslave you
So I'll purge your ignorance with flame and watch your savior save you
Now I've come to your home
Infiltrate with ease
Bind your sacred preachers hands
Put the swine down on their knees
They shall burn to ash
With their insolent house of lies
The will of god shall not deter my final conquest of divine
Rescind your scripture
Fuck your god
Only weak pathetic papists seek salvation from above
Still your false ideals continue to enslave you
So I'll purge your ignorance with flame and watch your savior save you
Burned at the stake
Seek solace in delusion
Burned at the stake
No one to hear your screams
Burned at the stake
Prayer fuels my enmity
You shall be burned at the stake
Piss on your ashen body
Your life's work charred around me
Faithless
The word of god won't mean shit
Once I've slaughtered every prophet
Hopeless
Remove the head of ophidian
No utterance
No venom
This for conscripted youth you've chained
We take your life, eviscerate
Once you have been burned at the stake we can begin anew
No more will your lies be held high
As King Bladud from the sky
Your life will end by the will of man
Mankind's doubt is your death
Please god
Bring me
To you
Wake up
No one
Hears you!
Tear and rend their pristine flesh
Soft from years of affluence
Now it shall feed those who support its gleam
Children passed down your lies and faith
Provide your god with wealth and hate
No more no more
This is the call for war
No longer shall your ideals bind us
Bring forth your leaders for our sacrificial slaughter
Doff ye from existence and your preachings from mine ear
Tear and rend their pristine flesh
Soft from years of affluence
Now it shall feed those who support its gleam
Children passed down your lies and faith
Provide your god with wealth and hate
No more no more
