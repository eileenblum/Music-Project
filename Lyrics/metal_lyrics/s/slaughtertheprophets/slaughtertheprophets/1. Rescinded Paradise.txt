Arise! The day of judgment draws near Repent! Our merciful god requires you repent
How many times have I told you? Your apocalyptic claims are just fearful rhetoric
How many times must I beat you? Until I no longer have to listen to your fucking shit?
You are as a beggar in the desert searching for contentment but only finding dust
You are as a peasant amongst nobles your fairy tales amuse but now itâs time to fall in line
Billions of men live in servitude to Christ all for fear of dogma, rescinded paradise
You live for a day that will never come judgement of the sins of his devotees
Allow me to end your suspense now slaughter the false prophets tear the throats of papists crucify

Martyrs will be forgotten once their converts meet their demise
Treat their words as weapons against mankindâs progression
Faith and logic canât coexist so let's expedite their ascension
In 70 CE you awaited your messiah Louis of Alcazar made excuses for the liar
In 1844 William Miller was a fraud still instead of seeing truth yet another church was born
Chuck Smith said 81, Edgar Whisenant, 89 Mr Lindsey's tribulation came and went in 95 
The toxicity of faith, disappointment in progression selfish nihilism, their god's only testament 
Keep looking to the sky! What a way to waste your own life
Living in fear of rapture how ironic, youâve created and suffered your own form of Hell, You've missed out on life 

And there is no great reward basing your existence on a lie was your undoing
I will always live for myself this shall be my heaven on Earth
Your warnings fall on deaf ears never will your trappings console me
Stringent indoctrination is essential to your savior I will always live for myself
This shall be my heaven on Earth your warnings fall on deaf ears
Never will your trappings console me stringent indoctrination is all you know
