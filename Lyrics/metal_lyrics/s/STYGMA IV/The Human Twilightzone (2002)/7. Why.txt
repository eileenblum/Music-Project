Why is it hard to love 
Why so easy to hate 
Why is it simple to steal 
And so hard to create 

I don`t believe 
That the stars descending 
I don`t believe 
That our hearts are changing 

Pride and envy 
Never ending 

Why oh why 
Why oh why 
Why can`t we live in peace(and harmony) 
Why do we spread the disease(of hate) 

Why are we so well disguised 
We can`t open our eyes(we`re so blind) 

I don`t believe 
That the stars descending 
I don`t believe 
That our hearts are changing 
Pride and anguish 
Never ending 

Why oh why 
Why oh why 
I don`t believe 
That the stars descending 
I don`t believe
That our hearts are changing 
I don`t believe 
That the stars descending 
I don`t believe 
That our hearts are changing 

Why oh why Why oh why
