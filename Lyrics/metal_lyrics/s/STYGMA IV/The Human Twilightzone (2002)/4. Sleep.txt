Wide awake I`m laying in the light
In this place the light shines so bright 
How I long for night 
How I wish for night 
The light is burning I can`t close my eyes 
What have they done to me 
What is this place I`m in 
What have they done to me 

Is anybody in here 
Can anybody hear 
Is anybody listening 
Please help me I`m afraid 
So afraid 
I`m so scared 
I`m so scared 
In this place of quiet blinding light 
I scream In this room without a shadow, a shadow 
I must be bound `cause I can`t move 
I can hear but I hear nothing, nothing 
Nothing but me 
How many days how many nights 
Am I in this hell of silent pain 
I don`t understand what they`re needing me for 

I`m so tired but I cannot close my eyes 
If I can`t look away the light will blind my sight 

Is there someone ?? 
Can anybody hear me ?? Is there somebody ?? 
Please answer me !! 

Save me, save me 
From this torture game 
Save me, save me 
From this horror play 
There must be a cause I don`t understand 
Save me, save me I`ll do anything 

Why they don`t ask any questions 
Why they don`t want any answers 
Are they just watching me die 

A tiny piece of sand is falling through the light 
A tiny drop of sweat is breaking on my brow 

Seconds crawling moments crawling 
Minutes seem like days 
Hours seem like years 

They are endless 
Time`s standing still 
Incarnation of my fears 
Incarnation of my fears 

The eye in the sky is watching me die 
The light in my sky is burning my eyes 
The electric eye is watching my cries 
The eye in the sky is watching me die 
I`m lost in a daydream 

Noone will hear, hear my screams for help 
For help Lightning flash before my eyes 
Needles pinned into my mind 
Pain is growing 
I try to hide 
In my mind where they can`t ever find me 
They`ll never find me I`m hiding inside me 

I`m so tired 
I`m so tired 
I`m so tired 
Sleep 
I want to sleep 
I want to sleep until the end 
Sleep I need to sleep 
I need to sleep until the end I dream 
The endless dream 
`Til I `m fading away 
I`m fading away 
Sleep I need to sleep 
I need to sleep until the end 
And dream the endless dream 
`Til I`m fading away 
I`m fading away 

Like a prisoner locked up They have taken away my home 
They `ve stolen my life 
They took away my family 
Their real purose 
I`ll never find I can`t escape, 
I can`t escape 
I can`t escape, 
I can`t escape 
I can`t escape, 
I can`t escape 
I can`t escape, 
I can`t escape 
I can`t remember my name 
I know I`m part of their game 

A secret game without a name 
This painfull game 

Needles in my vains 
Poison in my vains 

I reach the final curtain 
The end is getting certain 
My pain begins to get away 
The torture is lifted up from me 
Getting weaker I`m falling deeper 
By light surrounded i feel ungrounded 
I`m so tired, I`m so tired 

Sleep I fall asleep 
And I will sleep endlessly 
And dream 
The final dream 
`Til I`m fading away 
I`m fading away 
Sleep 
I fall asleep And I will sleep 
Endlessly I dream My final dream 
I dream Endlessly 
I sleep
