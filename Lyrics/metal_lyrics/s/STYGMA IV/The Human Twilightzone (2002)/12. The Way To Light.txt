The journey is ending 
The spirit`s descending 
I'm feeling again 
I feel once again 
Out in the coldness 
A space filled with sadness 
I still taste the pain 
Not to know who 

I am 
The sky breaks up and 
I see I`m not the one I used to be 
The sky breaks up and I feel 
Crawling calling 
For light

Long is the way to light and painful
Hard is the way to sight
What is the purpose of life 
Why is it so hard to find 
Why is it so hard to see 
Or is it just difficult for me 

When will I start to feel free and be satisfied 
Why I am always questioning me 
The sky breaks up and I see 
I can be the man I used to be 
The sky breaks up and

I see the light to live my life 
I see the light to live my life 
And find the way to be 

I think of all the good things in life 
I couldn`t find the power 
I begin to understand that 
Fate is lying in my hands 
I found the good things in live 
The power of mind 
My freedom yeah 
Why was it so hard to find 
I was so sad inside 

Finally I understand that fate is lying in my hands 
Finally I understand that fate is lying in my hands 
The sky breaks up and I see 
I am the man I want to be 
The sky breaks up and I see the light to live my life
