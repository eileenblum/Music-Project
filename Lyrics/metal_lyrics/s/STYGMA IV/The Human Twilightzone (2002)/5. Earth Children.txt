I have seen the horror 
I have seen it`s face New York
I have seen the terror 
The fanatics unleashed the force of hate 
The curse of hate

We are earth children 
Born under one old sun

We are one people 
Why do we hate what we don`t know

But when the smoke is rising 
We will be realizing 
The way was wrong 
So wrong 
Hatred is always blinding 

The devil is well disguising 
If we don't change our minds 
The spirits rise again 

I have seen them falling 
Falling for revenge the bombs 
I have heard them calling 
Calling for the holy war of hate 
This war of hate 

We are earthchildren 
We are one people 
But when the smoke is rising 
We will be realizing

The way was wrong

So wrong 
Hatred is always blinding 
The devil is well disguising 
If we don't change our minds 
The spirits rise again
