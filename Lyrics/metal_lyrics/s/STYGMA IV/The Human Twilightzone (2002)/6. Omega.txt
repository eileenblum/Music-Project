We the destructive force on our planet
We the spezies destroying the land
But now the time has come 
To face our demise 
It`s in our blood that we take everything 
The illness of nature a global disease 

We are a plague 
It`s in our blood to devastate 
The human plague 
We are not willing to see what we are doing

We continue to dig our graves 
And now the time is here 
To face our demise 

We are a plague 
The illness of nature a global disease 
The human plague 
It`s in our blood to take everything 
Destroy everything

We have ignored all the warnings 
Now nature is taking revenge 
Fire water earthquakes and storms 
Thunder lightning a new world is born 
It`s in our blood that we take everything 
The illness of nature a global disease 

We are a plague 
It`s in our blood to devastate 
We devastate 
We are a plague The human plague 
It`s in our blood to devastate 
We devastate
