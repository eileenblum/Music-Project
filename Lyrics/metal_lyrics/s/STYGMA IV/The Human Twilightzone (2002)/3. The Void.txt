I know there is something
I know there is something 
I know there is something inside of me 
I don`t know what it is but i know it is there 
I know there is something 
I know there is something inside 

The void 
The existencial nothing 
The void is growing under skin 
The void I am the son of nothing 
The void the emptiness within 

I can`t say how it feels 
I can`t sense where it is 
I`m not sure if it`s real but I know what I feel

I`m hollow I`m drying 
I am afraid of dying 
I`m crying I`m trying 
To stop my own decay 
I`m hollow I`m drying 
I am afraid of dying 

The void 
The existencial nothing 
The void is growing under skin 
The void I am the son of nothing 
The void the emptiness within 

So hollow so drying there is no place for hiding 
The horror so nameless 
Grown under my own skin 

I know there is something 
I know there is something 

The void The existencial nothing 
The void is growing under skin 
The void I am the son of nothing 
The void the emptiness within 
The void 
The existencial nothing 
The void is growing under skin 
The void I am the son of nothing 
The void the emptiness within 

I`m hollow I`m drying I am afraid of dying 
I`m hollow I`m drying
I`m the son of nothing 
I am afraid of dying 
The emptiness inside 
I`m hollow I`m crying 
I`m the son of nothing 
I`m hollow am dying The emptiness inside
