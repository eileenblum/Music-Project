There are many secrets 
Hidden behind walls 
There are many secrets 
Waiting to be unfold 
We all keep our secrecies 
Till we're getting cold 
Hiding in dark dungeons 
The evil takes its toll 

We don't know 
What goes on behind closed doors 
We won't see? 
What we never dare to see 

In the human twilight zone 
A secret garden 
In the human twilight zone 
There are to many secrets 

Much to many lies 
Why are we all camouflaged? 
Why all this disguise 

We don't know 
What goes on behind closed doors? 
We won't see 
What we never dare to see 

In the human twilight zone 
A secret garden 
In the human twilight zone 
We don't know 
What goes on behind closed doors? 
We won't see 
What we never dare to see 
In the human twilight zone 
A secret garden In the human twilight zone
