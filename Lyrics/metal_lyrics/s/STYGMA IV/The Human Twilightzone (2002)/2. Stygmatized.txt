In this world so stabilized 
We`re living save within 
Everthing seems to be alright In our regulated lifes 
What is hiding in the blinding haze 
The entry to a knoted maze 
Of desire greed lust and hate 
We`re jeopardized well disguised 

Paralized Tranquilized socialized Stigmatized 
Brutalized scrudenized scandalized 

We`re well disguised jeopardized Stigmatized 
Stigmatized All the minds are hypnotized 
We walk on the mainstream 
But there is something we'll never find 
A precious thing called peace of mind If we are honest to ourseleves 
We are locked up in golden cells 
Of despair solitude and grief 

We`re jeopardized well disguised 
Paralized Tranquilized socialized Stigmatized 
Brutalized scrudenized scandalized 
We`re well disguised jeopardized Stigmatized Stigmatized 

Oh yeah We will never realy see
Our lives are just a travesty 
Of desire greed lust and hate 
We`re jeopardized well disguised Paralized Tranquilized socialized 
Stigmatized Brutalized scrudenized scandalized 
We`re well disguised jeopardized Stigmatized Stigmatized
