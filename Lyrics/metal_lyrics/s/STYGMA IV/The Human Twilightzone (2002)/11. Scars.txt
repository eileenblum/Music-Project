Nighttime I`m touching you 
This time I`m there for you 
When I ly at your side 

I`m trying to shelter you 
I stand up for you 
I will cover you 
I stand up you

I protect you 
From the dark 
But the scars still shining through 
In the dark 
There is fear attacking you 
`Gainst the phantoms 
I fight each and every night 
I stand up for you 
I will cover you 
I protect you 
I protect you 
I can`t defie the shadows 
Surrounding you I cannot banish the nightmares 
Scaring you 

When I ly at your side 
I`m trying to shelter you 
I stand up for you 
I will cover you 
I stand up for you 
I protect you 
From the dark 

The scars still shining through 
In the dark 
There is fear attacking you 
`Gainst the phantoms 
I fight each and every night 
I stand up for you 
I will cover you 
I stand up for you 
I protect you 
Nighttime 
Nighttime 

I whish I could wipe away the tears 
From your eyes 
If I could only let the scars 
Fade away 
In the dark 

Your scars still shining through 
In the dark 
There is fear attacking you 
`Gainst the phantoms 
I fight each and every night 
I stand up for you 
I will cover you 
I protect you 
I protect you 
Nighttime I`m touching you 
This time I`m there for you
