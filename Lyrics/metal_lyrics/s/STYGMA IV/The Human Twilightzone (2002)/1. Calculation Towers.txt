Have you ever had the strange feeling someone`s watching you 
Did you ever wonder why you are acting like a stupid fool 
A force that hides in the shadows 
The unkown thief of our will 
Cold and soulless 
It feeds our needs and greed to be Our lives controled by 

Calculation towers 
The calculation power 
The calculation towers 
Designed for global power

The concience cannot sense it cannot sense controling energy 
But sometimes we still wonder why we are not what we used to be 

A force that hides in the shadows 
The unkown thief of our will 
Cold and soulless 
It feeds our needs and greed to be 
Our lives controled by

Calculation towers 
The calculation power 
The calculation towers 
Designed for global power

We can`t defend ourselves Cause man can only fight what he can see 
We think therefore we are So we`re so sure that we are free 

A force that hides in the shadows 
The unkown thief of our will 
Cold and soulless 
We are decived to feel free 
Our lives controled by

Calculation towers 
The calculation power 
The calculation towers 
Designed for global power
