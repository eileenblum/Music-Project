In the haze I see me
In the maze I search for me 
There are just traces of me 
In the haze I see me 
A trip to mind 
To the source of fright 
A clouded night 
Without a ray of light 
At the end of my daze 
My fear will go away 
At the end of my daze 
In the maze I see me 
In the haze I search for me 

A trip to mind 
To the source of fright 
A clouded night 
Without a ray of light 

At the end of my daze 
My fear will go away 
At the end of my daze 
In the misty night 
I sense my lives decay 
Distortion is a constant beam 
It hits me every day 

Of my live 
Every day of my live 
There's so much fear inside me 
There's so much loss and grief 

All fading in the night 
Just like a shadow thief 
A quest to find 
What I thought was mine 
A clouded night without a ray of light 

At the end of my daze 
My fear will go away 
At the end of my daze 
At the end of my daze 
My fear will go away 
At the end of my daze 
At the end of my daze 
At the end of my daze
