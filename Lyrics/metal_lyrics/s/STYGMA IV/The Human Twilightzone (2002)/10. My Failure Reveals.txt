HAVE YOU SEEN IT COMING
HAVE YOU SEEN IT COMING AFTER ME
IT CHANGED MY SCENSES IT HAS TRANSFORMED MY LIFE
MY GUILTY CONSCIENCE DERANGED MY MIND

EACH DAY OF LIFE NO MATTER HOW I TRY
MY FAILURE REVEALS
EACH DAY AND NITE OF MY HOPELESS FIGHT
MY FAILURE REVEALS

HAVE YOU SEEN ME RUNNING
HAVE YOU SEEN ME RUNNING THROUGH THIS TRAVESTY
I HAVE LOST FAITH IN MY SHATTERED LIFE
I HIT MY FEELINGS DEEP INSIDE

EACH DAY OF LIFE NO MATTER HOW I TRY
MY FAILURE REVEALS
EACH DAY AND NITE OF MY HOPELESS FIGHT
MY FAILURE REVEALS

I HAVE LOST MY WILL AND FAITH
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE MY SHATTERED LIFE
MY GUILTY CONSCIENCE DERANGED MY MIND
