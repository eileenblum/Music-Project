Let us welcome the actors now.
They have traveled many miles once again
and they seem to have lost their strength and confidence.

Let's share the warmth of our homes and kind words.
After all, they have shared their stories in a way we can observe
and enjoy their devotion to suffer and die in a land of make-believe.

Stand up to applaud and respect the creativity as they bow and proceed to move on.

The final curtain call.

Next, we shall move on to perform another show.
Will we be paid? Will we get food? No one knows...
But so be this life as a performer.
We hope we can be strong and survive this charade.
No time and no need to be worried,
the make-up will hide our fears and concerns as the curtain screams.

Stand up to applaud and respect the creativity as they bow and proceed to move on.

As they stand so tall, they try not to fall, the attention could kill them.
Covered by the pall, the final curtain call, pack your bags and move on to say "Good Night!"
