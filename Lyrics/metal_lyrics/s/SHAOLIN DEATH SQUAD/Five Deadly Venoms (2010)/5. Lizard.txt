Scaling up the walls,
caution on the air,
focus on the kill,
minimize the ground.

Lizard do not fall,
keep this battle fair,
utilize your skill,
whip your tail around.

Skills do not matter, your loyalties prevail.
Nothing can break.
Outside your scales, your destiny is death.
Lizard, breath, fight!

Thank you, we thank you.
You've held your head so high.
Remember Li Ho!

Scaling up the walls,
caution on the air,
focus on the kill,
minimize the ground.

Lizard do not fall,
keep this battle fair,
utilize your skill,
whip your tail around.

Use your venom well!
