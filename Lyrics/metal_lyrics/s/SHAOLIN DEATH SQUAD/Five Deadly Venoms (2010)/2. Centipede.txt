Feel this touch and you will scream
as your organs inside start to bleed
and as you fall you will hear my laugh
cause my handprint brands an epitaph.

With a strike so fast that you are dead
they say it feels just like a hundred legs
so line them up, I'll give them what they've earned
if they refuse what I've come to learn.
"You've got it".

The ground hits your back with a centipede attack
one hundred scars you'll show after centipede lets go.

Money from the poison clan, I will claim it with another hand
since my greed is shared with number two,
confrontation speaks the words "I'm on to you".
(you) can help, let's make this smooth
use your sword and skills to prove, "I'm right behind you".
I'm number one, I'm your boss, get the money and let's run.
"You've got it".

Your life won't come back after centipede attack.
The floor collects your bones after centipede lets go.

Look at the centipede as he crawls around on the ground,
moving in darkness, his legs find prey without a sound.
Look at the centipede. Look at the centipede as he moves without a sound.
Look at the centipede as he moves around underground
moving in darkness his legs find prey without a sound.

With one hundred legs you will lose this fight
and my slithering friend bites.
Guilty, but let go. We must find someone to take the blame.
So, let's blame the toad for MURDER!

The ground hits your back with a centipede attack.
A fatal wound you will shot when the centipede lets go.

Feel this touch and you will scream
as your organs inside start to bleed
and as you fall you will hear my laugh
cause my handprint brands an epitaph.
Murder charge I won't confess
and a bribe takes the pressure off my chest.
I'm number one, scholastic enemy.
Taste the venom of the centipede.
You've got it.
