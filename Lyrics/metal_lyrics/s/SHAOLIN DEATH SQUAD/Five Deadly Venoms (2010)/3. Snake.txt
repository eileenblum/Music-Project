Wait for the signal to charge with a venomous bite.
Release your powerful death, (death) is not an excuse to stop.

You stood your ground so well, but with one bite you fell.

Suffering can wait (I'm on to you).
Embrace the great snake.

Faith, hope, love is lost. Soul dissolves with lust.
Wait for the signal to charge with a venomous bite.
Release your powerful death!
You must stand your ground. You must not break down.

Think what could be gone with such strong venom.

You stood your ground so well, but with one bite you fell.

Fast ground attack. You won't be coming back.
Your battle's over... enjoy the poison.

I'm on to you... (you must stand your ground)
I'm right behind you... (you must not break down)
