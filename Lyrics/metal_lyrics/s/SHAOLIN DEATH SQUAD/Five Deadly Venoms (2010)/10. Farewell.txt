Erase the particles remaining in common.
Sense the soil drying out and the ground is cracking;
moisture lacking.
Building, destroying all the cyclical intent,
then rebuilding with prospect just to fail with respect.

Farewell, to that which has been left behind again.
Farewell, (it) will treat you better, suit you better.
Farewell, let's raise our cups and salute once again.
Farewell, we'll miss you, common sense, as we just say farewell.

Processes cancelled; the first process is cancelled.
Actions have greater consequences in the dark.
We're far behind advancement for the future.
So we just breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out...

Farewell, to that which has been left behind again.
Farewell, (it) will treat you better, suit you better.
Farewell, let's raise our cups and salute once again.
Farewell, we'll miss you, common sense, as we just say farewell.
