Kick the tail of death, you're the Scorpion.

Speak your tale of death, oh great Scorpion.
With your venom strong, you're outnumbered four to one.

Within this disguise, they don't even know my name
and which side I'm on, they're confused just the same.
Friendly or enemy, a fierce killer I am trained
crippled by a secret, and a chance of wealth and fame.
I work alone. Once an evil deed is done, then it never ends.
It goes on, and it goes on forever.

Thunder. Lightning strikes to the ground like the Scorpion.
Sting and strike, hiding in the night, he's the Scorpion.
Death Venom, inject it, you'll die by the Scorpion.
Sting and strike, hiding in the night, he's the Scorpion.
Your Poison!
Kick the tail of death, you're the Scorpion.
Fight when you can't hide like a scorpion.
