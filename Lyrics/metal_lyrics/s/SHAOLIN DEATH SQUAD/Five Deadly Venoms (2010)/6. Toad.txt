The life-cycle ends here,
innocent without fear.
A trust that was just broke,
the toad will soon croak.

Everything is growing dark, justice has turned its head.
Behind the masked face you were... my friend.

I stand my ground, these hands are clean.
The burden of betrayal crawls on his belly.
FIGHT!

Fear not steel, nor point, nor blade
over my skin which would not break.
But, I felt the embrace of 1000 legs
and the stinging kiss of the snake.

My life cycle ends here.

A new venom will appear.
