Conquest, Starquest, Bloodshed, Dead
Evolve, Devolve, All Solved, Dead
We've all heard what the robot had to say,
like bacteria, they'll kill us dead.
Jupiter ahead, Earth far behind.
We'll fight again this one last time.
Jupiter ahead, Earth far behind.
Extinction is all in their mind.

First Squadron has always got it done,
but this time Earth and Mars have much to fear.
This battle will surely be its final one.
For mankind shed a tear.
Jupiter ahead, Earth far behind.
We'll fight again this one last time.
Jupiter ahead, Earth far behind.
This is the end of all mankind.

Hey! Hey! Hey! Last Stand!
