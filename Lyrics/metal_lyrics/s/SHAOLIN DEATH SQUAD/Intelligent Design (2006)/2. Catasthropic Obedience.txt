Suckered into a catastrophe, awakened by a shout of blasphemy
Charged by a sense of joy and human humility.
Stand beside the side, which is the best side, outside, is where you tend to decide.

Make your move human, then melt away. Everything you wan-t can be made.
Carry on!! Just carry on!!
Hostage to your own perversity, lick the ass and bite the hand that feeds you!
And just carry on!!!!

Progress is what we expectâ¦.harvest with your breathâ¦make sure all are acceptedâ¦wipe off your mouth to refresh.

Check the list
Whatâs next
Gonna give the prize to the best
Smile big, you fucking pig
Are you ready for what comes next?
Make it point, to say YES!!!
Get on your knees and do your best!

And CARRY ON FOOLS!!!!! JUST CARRY ON!!
