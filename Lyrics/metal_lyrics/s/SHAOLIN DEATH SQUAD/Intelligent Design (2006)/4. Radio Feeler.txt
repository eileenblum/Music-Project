Iâll pass on this life Iâve taken.
Iâll take on this life youâve made.

Mute. Increase. Tell me how to be.

Iâll pass on this life Iâve taken.
Iâll take on this life youâve made.

Cut. Let if bleed. So we can be infected with itâs disease.

Such sweet feelings. Airwaves breathing.
It shows our ears away from finding it.

The only thing you seem to know is what youâre told from radio.
Instructions, can you feel them grow? If you believe your work is doneâ¦laziness won again.

Iâll piss on this life Iâve taken.
Iâll take on this life youâve made.

Fade in and out the picture. Shut it off. Turn off the power.
