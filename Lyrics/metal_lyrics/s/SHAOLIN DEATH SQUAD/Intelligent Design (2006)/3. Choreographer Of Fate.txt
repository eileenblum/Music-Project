All of the time. All in a line of time.
All of my life. All in a life of time.
We rise above the plans weâve made for the day.
And we hold the key to the cage that weâve made for our face.

You will never find it. Even with a card of tarotâ¦even with a ball of crystal.
You can never hide it. You will never go the distanceâ¦you will never run away from fate.

Come try as you may, to find a place secured within a space.

All of our fears. all in a fear of time.
All of our tears. All of our tears in life.
We arise for our new day that we think weâve planned.
Or did they make the cage for the key that we have to our faces.

You will never find it. Even with a card of tarotâ¦even with a ball of crystal.
You can never hide it. You will never go the distanceâ¦you can never run away from fate.

Come try as you may, to find a place secured within a space away from fate.
See what you will find, something more than the games.

The games that children play. Watching your every move by the end of the day.
You cannot weave the fabric of destinyâ¦you are just a puppet thatâs being pulled by the strings.

I want every thing my wayâ¦want complete control of fate.
I donât think you get the picture.
Need the needle that can weave fabrics of our destinyâ¦need control to set me free.
I donât think you get the picture.
I want every thing my wayâ¦want complete control of fate.

We rise above the plans weâve made for the day.
And we hold the key to the cage that weâve made for our face.

We will never find it. Even with a card of tarotâ¦even with a ball of crystal.
We can never hide it. We will never go the distanceâ¦we can never run away from fate.

Come try as you may, to find a place secured within a space away from fate.
Wipe away your tears to find a trace of the years on your face.

A way from fateâ¦see what you will find.
Itâs a game. You canât run awayâ¦you canât hide from fate.
