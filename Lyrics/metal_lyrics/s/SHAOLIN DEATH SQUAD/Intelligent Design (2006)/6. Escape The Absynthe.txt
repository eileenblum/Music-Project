Entering the room with facial distortion on my mask.
You thought you had a life that was closer.
My true identity lies in my future, not my past.
You thought you had a life that was closer.
I can wish.

Happiness exposed, and not too far from my grasp.
You thought you had a life that was closer.
Walking in slow-mo with Pentium time to pass.
You thought you had a life that was closer.
Escape absinthe

I canât imagine the passion that was felt.
Staring, procrastinationâ¦such power in yourself.
Fall deep, try to get out.
You laugh and cry and shout âI canât escape!ââ¦if powerâs what I need.

Elevation lowers (my blood pressure) is getting high.
You thought you had a life that was closer.
Waking up to another person that is not my wife.
You thought you had a life that was closer.
I can wish.

Pain folds on (dirt) starts to fade away.
