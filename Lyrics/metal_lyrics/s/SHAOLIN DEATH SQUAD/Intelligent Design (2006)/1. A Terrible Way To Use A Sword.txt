The flesh is so easy to be broken
Without graceâ¦a terrible way to use a sword!

The life of another human could be in your hands,
But you canât act on will âcause that would lack discipline.
You feel hurt without physical pain; well thatâs what you get
When you disrespect your skill and act upon will my friend.

So fight like a king,
With love for the queen.
Salute those youâve slain,
With no shame.

Your punishment will be severe.
1-2-3-4-5
Lashes across the spine.

The flesh is so easy to be broken
Without graceâ¦a terrible way to use a sword!

Welcome Armageddon. We are here to serve.
Welcome Armageddon. We are yours.

The fumes of temptation are stronger than the will to resist.
The question and answer of the reason that humans exist.
Contemplation brings a smirk upon your dirty face,
But youâve realized too late, your actions felt great.

So fight like a king,
With love for the queen.
Salute those youâve slain,
With no shame.

The last thing they will tell the priest, is that the great warrior has become a beast.

Dark without warning and life without living
Your honorâs corrupt and revenge is in mourning
Your skill has been tainted, your blade has been sharpened
The names have been listed. Welcome Armageddon. Weâre yours.

Weâre Yours.

Your heart bleeds with every beat. Youâve realized!
Your service has faced itâs defeat. Itâs the endâ¦
â¦of your world. Beautiful murders without graceâ¦
â¦a terrible way to use a sword!!!!
