THEY WILL REMEMBER ALL THE THINGS YOU DID
THEY WONâT FORGET AND THE WILL NOT FORGIVE.
REACTIONS, FORZEN THEY LIVE.
YOU WANT ALL THIS? 

I GUESS YOUR LIFE WOULD BE BETTER AS A STORY.
GOOD ONES HAVE NOT BEEN FORGOT.
FRAME YOURSELF NEGATIVE OR GLORIOUS.
IT COULD BE SOMETHING YOUR NOTâ¦.HAVE YOU FIGURED OUT THE PLOT?

MAKE YOURSELF A GIANT NEXT TO A SPECK OF DIRT,
OR MAKE YOURSELF ENORMOUS BIGGER THAN THE WHOLE WORLD.
YOU COULD HAVE POWER AND CONTROL THE ABSURD, 
BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE NOTHING.

I GUESS YOUR LIFE WOULD BE BETTER AS A STORY.
GOOD ONES HAVE NOT BEEN FORGOT.
FRAME YOURSELF NEGATIVE OR GLORIOUS.
IT COULD BE SOMETHING YOUR NOT.

RELAX. THIS WONâT HURT TOO MUCH.
RECALL WHAT YOUâRE NOTâ¦AND WANT!

LIKE AN EAGLE SORING TO THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN WITH BOLD CONFIDENCE, ONLY TO TAKE A REST.

AND THE TIGERS CLAWS RIP INTO YOUR FLESH, AS HE STARTS TO DIGEST THE LEGEND YOU HAVE BECOME BECAUSE YOUR BODY WILL DIE BUT YOU DONâT HAVE TO.

LALALALALALALALALALALALALAALALALALALALLALALALA

RELAX. THIS WONâT HURT TOO MUCH.
RECALL WHAT YOUâRE NOTâ¦AND WANT! 

A STORY LIVES FOREVERâ¦IT ALWAYS LIVES FOREVER
