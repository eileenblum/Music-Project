I can be your guide to whatever your heart desires.
I can be your guide to anything logical.

Youâve made your last mistake, while your body fell across the grate.
The feeling was nice, that everything you said was right.
No one questioned your lies.

I was almost thereâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦..
â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦Iâm far away.

I can be your guide to anything logical.

FALL, RISE, LAUGHâ¦FALL!

LIE!

I was almost there.

Youâve made your last mistake, while your body fell across the grate.
The feeling was nice; that everything you said was right.
No one questioned your lies.

I can be your guide to anything logical.
I can be your guide to whatever your heart desires.
