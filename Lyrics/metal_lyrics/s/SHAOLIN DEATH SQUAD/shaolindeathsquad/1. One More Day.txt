Take a look at this place where I stand,
Sucking life inside outâ¦â¦from my hand
Appointing a person to be a friendâ¦
They become more than that, then even less.

She (he) stepped in the way and took chanceâ¦and she (he) lost.
Confused, she (he) scratches her(his) head and starts to smell how sheâs (heâs)
Rotting awayâ¦oh, so quickly.

Ciao, ch ch ciao, ch ch chuh caio ch, ch, ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahhh ahh

Lovers sulking on the wrong side of the road,
But they canât hold hand âcause they have to hold their ownâ¦
â¦big bloody heads getting smaller with every drop of tear,
But they canât look at each other âcause that would be just one more day.
