[words by Mark Eudy]

Chase me
Hunt me
You canât catch me anymore
You teach me how to fight
You keep me warm at night
Till I go back into the forest
After all those mealy biscuits

Wait!â¦am I?

Curse me
Erase me
You wonât catch me anymore

Ya ya-ya ya-ya ya-ya ya, ya ya-ya e-ya-e-ya

WAIT!!

Terminal cancer
Makes you free
The empty answer
Such a joke to me
I am going to be 
A very late bloomer
I am going to be
A bumper crop kinda farmer
Never fear
Working for the extras
Right here
In the ruins of Texas, yeah Texas
Slowly going crazy 
Living on survival food
Squeezing the rest of my life,
Lacking all embrace,
Out of a Mylar tube

Ya ya-ya ya-ya ya-ya ya, ya ya-ya e-ya-e-ya

Waitâ¦am I?
Waitâ¦am Iâ¦

Waiting to disintegrate?
Waiting to disintegrate.

Waiting to disintegrate.
