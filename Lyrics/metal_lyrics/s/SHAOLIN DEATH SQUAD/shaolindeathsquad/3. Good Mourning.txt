I decided to wake up again today, in hoping that today would be better than yesterdayâ¦what are the chances of that?

Woke up early today, in hoping I could get a cup of coffee to start my dayâ¦mmm mmm good!!!!!
Traffic is slow today, but how I want my cup of coffee to start my dayâ¦Iâm donât care if they see Iâm late.

Iâll just make up a story.
Iâll say âmy stomach hurt.â and âI am sorry.â
âif you fire me, Iâll understand, but I love my job and you are my friend.â
Woke up early in the morning just to get a cup of coffee, hoping every thing would be alrightâ¦and Iâd be fine!
Oh, how can I let them know,
That my honesty is not a show?.
Oh, day after day after day
Such monotonous redundancy .
How much more can I take? âCause iâ¦
Woke up early in the morning just to get a cup of coffee, hoping every thing would be alrightâ¦I would not be late!!
GOOD MOURNING!!

Twelve oâclock is almost here. Itâs been coming at the same time for nearly thirty yearsâ¦now itâs almost time for my lunch break!!

Oh, how can I let them know,
That my honesty is not a show?.
Oh, day after day after day
Such monotonous redundancy .
Woke up early in the morning just to get a cup of coffee, hoping every thing would be alrightâ¦and Iâd get laid.
Iâd get laid off.
Time to hit the road again. Iâm going home to see all of my beautiful friends. My smileâs big and brown!
Thought I was in control and almost home, driving fast only to hit the brakes.

My body struggles to awake, as my airbag starts to deflate.
