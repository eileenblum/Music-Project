A complication on the right side of my head
A small incision shortly after I am dead
Manic depression slowly draining from my bed
Still complications on the right side of my head

Your blank smile
My blank smile
Your blank smile

You piss me off, when I am feeling fine.
You knock me down, when I am feeling high.

A complication on the right side of my head
Alcohol will not even begin to kick in
I wonât let depression creep back into my bed
That small incision closed up, because I am not dead.

Thereâs something that I wanted to say to you, 
but itâs something that you wouldnât do.
(you) said thereâs something that you wanted to say to me too,
but itâs something that I wouldnât do for you.

You wouldnât know!
