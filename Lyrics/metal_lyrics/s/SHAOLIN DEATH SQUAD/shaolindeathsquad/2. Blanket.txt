[Words by Mark Eudy]

If I kill one innocent person, to save twenty or moreâ¦
â¦will I be a hero in your heaven, if I die to praise a lord?

I can perfect my Elvis Presley lip-curl
While Iâm staring at the whole wide world
And Iâm reporting to no one
Being the subversive is so much fun

I wonder what itâs like killing non- combatants,
There is no such thing as a surgical strike
Whatever happens, happens.
Maybe it will happen tonight.

Is this just a justification?
Does testosterone make you serious?
Did I just give myself instructions to go numb and be furious?

Iâm about a quart low on milk of amnesia.
Itâs getting harder to be martyr.

Iâve got violence running hot
Iâve got violence running cold
Whatever happens, happens,

What's your definition of innocence?
