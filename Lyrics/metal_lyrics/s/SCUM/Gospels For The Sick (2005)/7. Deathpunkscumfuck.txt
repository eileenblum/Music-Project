In defense of your own country
You pro-fuck your reality
Victims lie dead in torment
of your commodities
Blackmail is the only thing that
you can call a family
For it's the only way your tourniquets phallacy
Chainsaw Sex!!
The Anti-Brigade
Chainsaw Sex!!
The Anti-Brigade
Cradled from old denial
Bought all the laws I can't see
Who criticized who wins dies
Who can be their own new disease
City of shit
City of shit
City of shit
City of shit
Fantasized Fatal eyes Fatal mind
Fatal blind
Chainsaw Sex!!

...silenced now and for your cunt
Fueled with madness and dismay
braking for...... grave
Used your break communist eyes
Greed is your only dream
The dollar's mightier than the sword
Shame in your fucking greed
Have our way - do what I say - do what I say -
Fuck your way!
