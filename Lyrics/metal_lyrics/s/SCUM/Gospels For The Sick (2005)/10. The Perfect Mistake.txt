Attack!!
Hopeless in ruin
The raptured and the captured corruption
Why can't we
Sick here we're dying
Lay down and open the cunt
that's bruised on me
Maimed and restless
Bones and torture
Buried, I'm restless I'm tortured
I'm waiting for
Buried, I'm restless I'm tortured
Waiting for you!
We must bleed!
Servants - Serve naked
Destroy &amp; survive
We've got to hate them
Why can't we ever live?
Stop bleeding!
Why can't we ever stop bleeding!
When did we live?
Why can't we ever stop bleeding
When did we live stop bleeding
Why can't we deny?
Attack!
When did we lived?
Attack!
When did we deny?
Attack!
When did we lived?
Attack!
When did we deny?
Attack!
The perfect mistake
Heartless you're wounded
Disfigurment, fortune and corruption
Fortune and corruption!
Buried, I'm restless, I'm tortured
I'm waiting for you
Buried, I'm restless, I'm tortured
Trust in you!
Proof is still nothing!
Why can't we!
Sick and we're dying
The truth is won
(But) possess noone
Greed through corruption!
Why can't we ever stop bleeding?
When did we lived?
Why can't we ever stop bleeding?
When did we live stop bleeding
When did we deny?
Attack!
When did we lived?
Attack!
When did we lived?
Attack!
When did we lived?
Attack!
When did we deny?
The perfect mistake!
I lick your wounds as gods cunt-enant said
Prepare to die!!!
Nothing is left for this suicide
Nothing is left
But a code to possess for excess
There's nothing
There is one thing
We possess
We possess your last eternal rest
And death shall command
In your exist, life will begin
I can't resist nothing I lived
I join hands with your resent
In the perfect mistake
We'll attack
We just bleed we must feed
Disease
Feed your proof and your happiness
We must bleed the truth of the sex
and your emptiness
We must bleed til you die
We must bleed til you die
We must bleed til you die
We must bleed til you die
We must bleed a code to possess
When did we lived?
When did we deny?
Attack!
When did we lived?
Attack!
When did we deny?
Attack!
When did we lived?
Attack!
When did we deny?
Attack!
When did we lived?
Attack!
When did we deny?
The perfect mistake.
