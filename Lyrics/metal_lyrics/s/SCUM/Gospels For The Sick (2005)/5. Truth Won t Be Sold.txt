Won't be sold
I am antichrist Schwarzenegger
the holocaust smiles under my frown
Cause my name I cower to hide
Carve my name inside of your forehead
I bring you the death of the Kennedys
I bring you the death of the police
I bring you the death of the war we pay for
Everyday life sentence is war
The truth will not be sold for you
The truth will not be told to me
The truth will not be sold for you
The truth will not be sold to me
The holocaust
I bring you death in
Hollywood
The warped rolls in as the parents get in
Hollywood
Those bets are empty from riggers pride
Holocaust
I'm living in a denied land
Holocaust
We pretend with your happy smile
Hollywood
We play pretty songs until the end
The Holocaust
The holocaust is all within
The truth will not be sold to you
The truth will not be told to me
The truth will not be sold to you
The truth will not be told? Again!
Again!
Again!
Hollywood Holocaust
(Again)
The Holocaust
Hollywood Holocaust
The Holocaust
Hollywood Holocaust
I bring you the death of the Kennedys
Holocaust
I bring you death of the police
Holocaust
I bring you death of war we pay for evermore
The Proof?
The truth will not be told to you (need not worry)
Their truth's not for me! (no this can't be ever call me)
The truth will not be sold to you (did we win in the end)
The truth will not be told to me (what's the final toll)
In this end
