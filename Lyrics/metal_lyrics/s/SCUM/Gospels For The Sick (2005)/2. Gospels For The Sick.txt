The rotten faces of whores
Laying wasted down in mental tombs
Waiting for fingers depraved
The hopeless and endless end wound
Live by desire maimed by the guilt
Gospels for the sick and betrayed
We must bleed together as one
To destroy the american maimed
Society's of guilt so corrupted
Free from the lust of these whores
Let them taste in their own poison
Tyrants have voices have guns
Workers of filth and the disruptive
Mortals are awake in their tombs
Slaves shall serve and servants will rule
Fingers and bones of the untrue
Gospels for the sick
In the name of the maimed
Gospels for the sick
Disinfect the obedient today
Destroy
We are the new torments
Getting strangled more everyday
As the moon tasting the night
We're getting stronger in everyway
Maimed in desire
Maimed by the guilt
Maimed by the corrupted pigs
Maimed by desire
Maimed by the filth
Tyrant corrupted their kids
Tyrant corrupted their kids
Society's of greed so corrupted
Free from the last of these whores
Let them taste their own poison
The faster the battles are won
We must bleed together as one
To live the american way
Slaves shall serve as servants will rule
Capitalist feeding and feeding
And eating their tombs
Gospels for the sick
In the name of the maimed today
Gospels for the sick
To destroy the american pigs today
Destroy!
Buried I'm restless I'm tortured
Watch them in dreams of blood
Tortured I'm wasted and decayed
Divided we stand in your blood
We stand in your blood
We stand in your blood
We stand in power
We stand in your blood
Why are we supposed to live
In this pig society
Disinfect the obedient
And destroy their world today
Built on american greed
Where Society's never corrupt
I will die from this dream
These hands will be never dealt
To hit me
Self destruct dire rapture and dismay
I'm a man not a liar
Capitalist maim and capitalist guilt
The bourgeois pigs of desire
Let the american dream turn us to nightmares
We are disease in their blood
Fear as one I provide you these songs
As roads for your suicide
For your suicide
For your children's suicide
Mass genocide to all the victims
I give you death
A lesson A! In the command
Of the informants
Inform and then ignore
Inform and get to the rich society
Inform into the pure
Subversion guaranteed
I provide you your guilt
Crucified by the lords desire
To suck the cunt of your holy trinity
Lord I am the god forming unto your man
I lie naked with your fucking whore
Gospels for the sick
I'm still here for the sick
Who shall rule and who shall become
the ones who define the man
The ones who defile the man
The ones who the final man
How are we supposed to live
With these pigs every day
How are we the new torments
To disinfect the obedient here today
