I can't stand your fucking TASTE
I can't take your embrace
I stand here I take that
I break my face turning back
Chew you up to shoot you down
Take your drugs to make your rounds
Paid your head to the man
To the cops who romance you
Protest Life!
Protest Life!
Think about dead in the torments of life
Blackmail genius family-life
For the only way you to cut
Cowards are born and sold get lost

[Chorus:]
Black battles burn tonight
I don't wanna piss in your face tonight
We stand forever in all of your sorrows
We still are fighting for all you despise
We stand forever a new Aura-Station
We still are fighting with hate in your Eyes
We stand forever in all of your Sorrows
We still are fighting for all you despise
For all you despise for all your fucking lies
Protest Life!
Take my head
Take my hands
Take me to the inhuman man
Take me to his fucking place
Take me to crucify his face
The Vatican bought and bribed
The Vatican in denial
The Vatican's bought and sold
... owned
In these pills I take I can't see straight
God's pills for the apocalypse
Evacuate the land
Evacuate the man
And crucify the Pope and crucify the land
This human race of abortions blood
Kill the human race for its untrust
Traitors of the land and traitors of the man
Inbred fucking cowards of a man
If god created man with an image of himself
No wonder we're such cowards, traitors and backstabbing liars

[Chorus]

Death politicians
Dead politicians
We are the unborn leaders
Dead politicians
Death politicians
We still are fighting until the end
Until the end
