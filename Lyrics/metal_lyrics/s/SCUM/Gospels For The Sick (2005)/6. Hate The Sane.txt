There's no room for love
Only time to desecrate
Man defiles
To war and violate
Rats for eyes
I've got rats for eyes
The more you consume
The less that we can create
There's just us
There's no justice
Noo justice
It's time to hate the sane
Will work for blood
Will work for discipline
I'm just a vulture in sin
who's here to annihilate
Why can't I fall in love?
Why can't I stay the same?
Why can't I be like you?
So let's start to hate the sane!
Fate's an empty womb
With open discipline
In fire divine
In fire divine
There's no justice
There's just us
There's no justice
to start to hate the sane
Spill the love
Spill the greed
Spill the lies that I believe
Spill the gods that we worship
And die with nothing!
Why can't I fall in love?
Why can't I stay the same?
Why can't I be like you?
So let's start to hate the sane!
Why can't I fall in love?
Why can't I stay the same?
Why can't I be like you?
I want to be insane!
Hate the sane!
Hate the sane!
Hate the sane!
Hate the sane!
Just to be like you
So I cut like you
When I fuck you (?)
Why can't I kill this freedom?
that feeds this bleeding World!
Why don't they call it justice?
When Death's our only world!
When do they call this normal?
When dying fellow man
Why can't I kill this freedom?
And annihilate anothers land
There's no justice
There's just us
Sick justice
Sieg heil
The truth is not your future
The truth's in your decay
Society's proof is our children
That children that you betray
Betray the truth enslaved by fame
Famous words that you betray
You will live to kill the fame
Kill the slaves and kill the fame
There's no justice
It's just us
It's just us
To hate the sane
There's no justice
There's no justice
Sick of justice
To hate the sane
You are the slaves of today
Betray the truth enslave the fame
Famous words that you proclaim
You are the slaves of today
