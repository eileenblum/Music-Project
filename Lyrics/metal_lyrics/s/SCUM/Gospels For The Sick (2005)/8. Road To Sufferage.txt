The protest-desd
from the sickened bled
Under the cold black sky
May the gods hook lied
Freedom aside that gets in our way
Blood from the sky
Lectures that lessen
Lectures that lesson
Under the lie
Lectures that lesson
Tornado why
Lectures that movement tonight
Lectures in Paradise
Paradise
it's just another way to die
It's in your blood
It's just another easy suicide
it's in your blood
You're just another whore in paradise
It's in your blood
We're on the road to sufferage
Sufferage tonight!
Blood from the freak
on the meat hook
Lots of fucking hate
I'll suck it out dry
Bloodreaping flood
The infernos black
God is my slave
God is my fucking slave!
Lectures that lessen
It's not my fate
Lectures that lessen
Our baby enslaved
Lectures that lessen
Lectures that died
Lectures in movement
A movement to hide!
it's just another way to die
It's in your blood
It's just another easy suicide
it's in your blood
You're just another whore in paradise
It's in your blood
We're on the road to sufferage
Sufferage tonight!
Death is an omen womb!
Dead as they sleep
They're in the fire
Dead in my sleep
In nightmares blood
Get in my sleep
You feel that nothing
If you've got nothing
If you have nothing
If you got nothing
Blood in my eyes
Blood is my vice
Blood in my eyes
Blood in my...
There's nothing left
Incinerate the church
There's nothing left
Incinerate yourself
There's nothing left
We got to burn these hearts
We got burning hearts
Psychic crime tonight
