I'm sick of you and your embrace
I want you dead from your disgrace
Boredom waits and Boredom gets
And boredom breeds what you reject
No more - I can't taste this sore
No more - We can't.... .. more
I can't move 'cause I can't hold up
And I get sick 'cause you won't shut up
The thought of you makes me wanna throw up
Because of you I won't grow up
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
Bless your wounds and bless your state
slashing through our future dates - NO!
Bless your greed and kill the poor
Feed your head til it ignores
Bleed your faith and bleed your cures
Bleed yourself into your graves
Only to be a fucking slave suck yourself
until you're laid
No More - I can't take no more
We Were - I can't take this whore
I can't move cause I can't put up
I get sick when I can't grow up
The thought of you makes me wanna throw up
Because I'm dead and I won't live up
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
No more lies for me and you
No more lies in our own place
We can die in airplanes
We can die now let's fight
I get sick when I can't hold up
I can't move cause you won't shut up
The thought of you makes me wanna throw up
Because of you I will never grow up
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
