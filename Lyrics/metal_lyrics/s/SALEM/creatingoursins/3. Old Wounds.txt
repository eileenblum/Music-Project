screams of death
it's happened again
the nightmare has been revived
old wounds re-opened

desecrating of the graves
and the writing on the wall
power of hatred
can turn the wheels back again

france - destroy the ancient tombs
england - riots in the streets
russia - property was burned
what happened to the human race?
is their hate so strong that they cannot feel?

millions of bodies buried in the earth
turn inside their graves
their holy sleep has been distrurbed
they will never rest again
