[Live Demo Bonus Track]There were wars over the years lots of people died
Lots of people got wounded lots of people got crazy
Many people lost their homes and families
But only one war was called The Holocaust

There was a madman his name was Hitler
He carried after him a big nation to become Nazis
His soldiers almost murdered a whole nation

Millions starved to death and were murdered after torture
Scientists made their experiments on the Jewish bodies while they were still alive

The victims will never forget the horror they have been through
Nowadays the Nazi party is growing stop them before it is too late

Thanks to nirajpandya for sending track #4 lyrics.
