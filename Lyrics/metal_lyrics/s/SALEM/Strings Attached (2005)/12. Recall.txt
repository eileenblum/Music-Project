Before you end your life, recall all that you've done.
Striving for wealth to gain some more power.
All of which is now gone.
Afterlife.
No rest in your afterlife.
Now we're left with a weapon to be used in our Russian roulette.
Being self centered brings mass destruction.
This is the world you helped create.
No one can leave this place.
A planet in chaos, unsafe.
Rest in pieces.
Rest in war.
Why were you so dumb?
Ruining the future for the ones you love.
Die.
Now you begin yourredemption.
Your rotting corpse will fertilize the earth.
If no one follows your hollow ways, there is a new chance for rebirth.
