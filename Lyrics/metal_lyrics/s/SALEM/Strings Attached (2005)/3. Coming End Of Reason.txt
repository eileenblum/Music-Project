Show the world and your masses blood of the butchered you have slain.
Behold the coming end of reason.
Death is a better way of life.
Throw yourself at the mercy of the dead who seek revenge.
When blood is seen in heaven, God knows his creatures have gone insane.
Find no shelter from their wrath.
Hate will lead you underground.
Mark of glory-quiet mind.
Brain dead leaders out of line.
You heed to words of the demented.
Used as puppets in their play of lies, hate and destruction.
True dark ages abomination.
