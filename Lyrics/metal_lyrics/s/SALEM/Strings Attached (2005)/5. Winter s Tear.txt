When autumn leaves are falling, nature's calling me to stay at home.
And if the rain is pouring, my heart's soaring and I'm all alone.
I wish I could be understood.
It's only fair but they all stare.
I'm at a loss at such a cost.
I wish that you were here to stay.
Say that it isn't so.
Don't tell me that it's time to go.
Don't ever be the one to know.
Just say that it isn't so.
In winter's tear when no one's near, I find condolence in the past.
I reminisce and then get pissed.
Her image haunts me like a ghost.
