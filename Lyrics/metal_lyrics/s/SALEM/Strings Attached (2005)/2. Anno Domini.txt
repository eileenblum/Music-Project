Dropped from the sky.
Came to earth.
To clean your minds.
And serve your hate.
Say your prayers.
Bring your child.
Save your souls.
I know what you've done.
You try to rule our lives.
You want to gain control.
You use a son of God.
To bring this hate.
You blind us with his name.
You treat us like a game.
Your story is a shame on our end.
