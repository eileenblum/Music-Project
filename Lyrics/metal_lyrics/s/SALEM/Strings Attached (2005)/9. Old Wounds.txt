Screams of death.
It's happened again.
The nightmare has been revived.
Old wounds re-opened.
Desecration of the graves.
And the writing on the wall.
Power of hatred can turn back the hands of time.
Old wounds.
France - ancient tombs destroyed.
England - Riots in the streets.
Russia - property was burned.
What happened to the human race?
Their hate so strong it makes them blind.
Millions of bodies buried in the earth.
Rolling over inside their graves.
Their holy sleep has been disturbed.
They will never rest again.
