Remember when all the days were of gold.
And Time was always at your side.
The days of childhood are forever gone.
Innocence lays shattered by the Grave.
Wait for a moment of silence.

Before the day turns to night.
Before the end of light.
Wait for a moment of silence.

Before the coming of the dark.
Before the great storm.
Wait for a moment of silence.

And then the sun turns to black.
The sun turns to black.
Wait for a moment of silence.

In remembrance of days that will never come back.
We each must face our dying pasts.
For every day must die.
And though we strive to make them last.
The future is inevitable.
