Cry out for one soul.
The only one that could ever hear.
Only one whose ears are brave enough to listen to the beat of a heart.
I try to find a pair of eyes.
Eyes to match a soul.
The sweat meets my tears.
The salt blinds my eyes.
You are there I know it.
I can sense the throbbing pain.
I catch a glimpse of sparkling eyes.
Then I see the eyes no more.
