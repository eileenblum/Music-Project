Lost in thoughts of the past.
The anguish of the years.
Darkness is my only friend.
Darkness hides my tears.
I've lost the only light.
The embers fade and die.
The memories of days long gone.
Refuse to ignite.
Why? Can this be all that's left?
This love has gone ammis.
And why am I left to die?
To perish here for all to see.
