My life is fading.
All that's left are memories.
Vastige from the past.
A fire storm of fear.
I'm a shadow of a man.
One foot in the grave.
I remember times of chaos.
A fire storm of fear.
Nothing can escape from mortality.
Man begins to feed on man.
Wanted by demons of the past.
The leaders talk and talk, but nothing can escape the avalanche.
Fire - Storm - Of - Fear.
