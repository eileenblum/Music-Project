The end of the world, at least as we know it
This is the mantra of those not earth bound
They are the chosen, they are the martyrs
The ones who deciphered the meaning of life

The privileged dead
Are you privileged?

The world's at its end and we don't even know it
This is a mantra for those left behind
Alive and still breathing, hurting while dreaming
Unlike the ones who are not still around

The privileged dead
Are you privileged?

The more I dig into it
Questions are raised
Life should be cursed
Death to be praised
