[Bob Marley cover]

Men and people will fight you down
When you see Jah light
Let me tell you if you're not wrong
Everything is all right
So we gonna walk through the roads of creation
We the generation
Trod through great tribulation

Exodus
Movement of Jah people

Open your eyes and look within
Are you satisfied with the life you're living?
We know where we're going
We know where we're from
We're leaving Babylon
We're going to our Father land

Exodus
Movement of Jah people

Send us another Moses
From across the Red Sea
Jah come break downpression
Rule equality
Wipe away transgression
Set the captives free
