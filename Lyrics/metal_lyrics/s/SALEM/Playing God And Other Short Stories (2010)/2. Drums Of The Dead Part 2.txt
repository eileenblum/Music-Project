Scurvy, smallpox, syphilis, typhoid
Starvation, laceration, mutilation, rape

Drums of the dead
The beat's in your head

Born of prayers of a thousand dead souls
Chained by fate down the abyss
God in drum, protector of spirits
Yearning for home so their bones rest in peace

Sorrow, anger, confusion, fear
Branding, clubbing, drowning, death

Slave traders, death dealers
Misinterpreters of right and wrong
Vengeance from beyond the grave
Will make you pray for death

Ancestors, forefathers
Avengers of helpless souls
Pound your justice upon our own
Who sold their blood,
make them wish and pray for death
