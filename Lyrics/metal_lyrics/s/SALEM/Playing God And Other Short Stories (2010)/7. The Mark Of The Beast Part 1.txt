Prince of the power of the air...

Then the angel took the censer
Filled it with fire from the altar
and threw it to the earth

Five Calamities
Five Disasters
Let the Earth Shake
Intergalactic collisions
Darken the sun
Wipe out life
The Beast has come

Twelve Demons
Disciples of the Star
Twelve Demons
Forcing the mark upon you
Twelve Demons
Servants of the King of Babylon
Twelve Demons
Prince of the power of the air
Forty-Two months to go
The Beast will rule the world below
Receive his mark or face your death
Believe that God will revive your breath
