When our voice has been muted
And our flesh is met with steel... See More
When a quick end seems like an option
Our trampled dignity takes with bliss

The contemptible, the dispirited
Prayed for years, something answered
The dejected, the faltered, Say it's time to
Dance to the beat of a different drum

Dance to the beat of the drums of the dead
In trance pounding your life away
The long forgotten dead are longing for home
Drums of the dead, the beat's in your head

If you survive the middle passage
Loss of Freedom will be your gain
Loss of family, your own humanity
From now on you'll pray for death

The contemptible, the dispirited
Prayed for years, something answered
The dejected, the faltered, Say it's time to
Dance to the beat of a different drum

Dance to the beat of the drums of the dead
In trance pounding your life away
The long forgotten dead are longing for home
Drums of the dead, the beat's in your head
