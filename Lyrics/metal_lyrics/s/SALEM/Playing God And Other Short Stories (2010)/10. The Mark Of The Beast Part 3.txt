Ten Nine
You have no spine
Eight Seven
Lost your way to heaven
Six Five
Die each day yet stay alive
Four Three
Two One
The beast has won

This is the sound of perdition
It's second coming your way

Smoke of their tormented souls
Ascends forever and ever
They have no rest day or night
Drink of the wine of the wrath of God

This is the sound of perdition
It's second coming your way
Ten Nine
You have no spine
Eight Seven
Lost your way to heaven
Six Five
Die each day yet stay alive
Four Three
Two One
The beast has won
