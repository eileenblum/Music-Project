Screaming on the edge of the void.
Silent, only I hear the scream.

Grasping my hands, white from the fear.
Burning the sky, more red than blood.
Escape is impossible now,
Hopeless, the world itself is screaming.

Burning skies roar like flames,
Whirling oceans heave in storm.

Grasping my hands, white from the fear.
Burning the sky, more red than blood.
Escape is impossible now,
Hopeless, the world itself is screaming.

The edge of the void.

Darkness is setting over my mind,
I awake, but the nightmare remains.

The edge of the void.
