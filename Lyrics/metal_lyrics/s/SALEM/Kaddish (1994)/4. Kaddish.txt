It seems only yesterday,
I lost them all.
Years have past me by
And time can't heal this loss.

Bear your prayers for thier souls.
Bear your prayers for thier souls.

It seems only yesterday,
Hope was somewhere else.
Far away,
And the nightmare was life itself.

Bear your prayers for thier souls.

I know that memories can't be shared,
But I suffer a pain that isn't mine.
Somewhere, in the back of my thiughts,
There will alaways be a Holocaust.
