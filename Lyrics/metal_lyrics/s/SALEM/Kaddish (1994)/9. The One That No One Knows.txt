Can't understand what is wrong with me,
How on Earth can you st me free?
Where are the times I was in control?
Open the gate to my fucking world.

The one that no one knows.

Only lies survive,
Reason is no excuse.
He's inside of me,
The one that no one knows.

I've lost my mind.
You'll never find
Peace in these eyes.
I can't disguise
Flames that burn within.
Devouring
My sanity.
This is not me.

Can't understand what is wrong with me,
How on Earth can you st me free?
Where are the times I was in control?
Open the gate to my fucking world.

The one that no one knows.

Only lies survive,
Reason is no excuse.
He's inside of me,
The one that no one knows.

Struggle against my impulses.
Against my will, imprisonment.
I am confined within myself.
What in the world have I done?
