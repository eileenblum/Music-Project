Lost in thoughts of the past,
The anguish of the years
Darkness is my only friend,
Darkness hides my tears.
I've lost the only light,
The embers fade and die.

The memories of days long gone
Refuse to ignite.

Lost in thoughts of the past,
The anguish of the years.
Darkness is my only friend,
Darkness hides my tears.
I've lost the only light,
The embers fade and die.

But why?
Can this be all that's left?
This love has gone amiss.

And why am i left to die,
To perish here for all to see?

Why? Can this be all that's left?
This love has gone amiss.
