Cry out for one soul,
The only one that could ever hear,
Only one whose ears are brave
Enough to listen to the beat of a heart.

Try to find a pair of eyes,
Eyes to match a soul.

The sweat meets my tears,
The salt blinds me.

You are there, I know it,
I can sense the throbbing pain.
I catch a glimpse of sparkling eyes,
Then I see the eyes no more.

Try to find a pair of eyes,
Eyes to match a soul.
