Flames
Rage from above
Untamed
The ground shake below
Set the earth on fire 
Set the earth on fire

Leave behind yesterday
Look ahead far away
Dive into a sea of tears
99 the worst of years

Crazed
Prophet of despair
Amazed
Truth in his words
Set the earth on fire
Set the earth on fire

Leave behind yesterday
Look ahead far away
Dive into a sea of tears
99 the worst of years
Flames
Rage in his eyes
Untamed
Visions in his mind
Set the earth on fire
Set the earth on fire

Leave behind yesterday
Look ahead far away
Dive into a sea of tears
99 the worst of years
