My youth is seeping away so fast
And when you went you took hope away
Now I can not ignore the future
The present becomes unbearable

Old man did you think about tomorrow
Or was the final moment your betrayer
You bled to death between my hands
And there was nothing I could have done
For you

My youth is seeping away so fast
And when you went you took hope away
You bled to death between my hands
And there was nothing I could have done
For you
