Slow descent towards dependency
So intent to fulfill the prophecy
Maternal recession
Into infancy

Undividable grip
Irreversible lock
Alone I die
Symbiosis

Your warm embraces - release me
Devide me not - erase me
Ours are sister souls - for we are one
I am the seed within - devour me

Make one move
Just one step
And I 'm torn apart
I 'm torn apart

Slow descent towards dependency
So intent to fulfill the prophecy
Maternal recession
Into infancy

Undividable grip
Irreversible lock
Alone I die
Symbiosis
