Time is seeping
Between my hands
The clock is ticking
Day fly by
Time is seeping into my thoughts
There's no mistaking
What's to come

I live my life
I have no choice
No voice

The lines not getting
Any shorter
The road we're taking
Is strait and narrow
Looking forward nothing is clear
One thing is certain
The end is near

I live my life
I have no choice
No voice
