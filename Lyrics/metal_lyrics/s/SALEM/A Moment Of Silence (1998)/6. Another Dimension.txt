In the midst of joyful time
The strongest realization struck me
The time of my death is pre-conceived
And however plentiful
My days are numbered

I believe in god
My soul will never die
I beg you don't let me go
It can't all disappear
It's in my mind

What would you do if you were to know
The date that's reserved only for you
Would it drive you out of your mind
Would it drive you out of your soul

I believe in god
My soul will never die
I beg you don't let me go
It can't all disappear

You can't convince me
That everything is simply there
With it's fabulous creatures
Was created by a greater force

A greater scheme binds everything
Of this I'm sure I'm certain
In another dimension our souls live and breath
And there they are eternal

I believe in god
It's in my mind
My soul will never die
It's in my mind
I beg you don't let me go
I don't believe 
It can't all disappear
