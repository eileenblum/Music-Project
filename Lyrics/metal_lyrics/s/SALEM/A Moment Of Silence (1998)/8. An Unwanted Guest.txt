When you sleep
The door is open
And through the dream
You pass the portal
Summoned by the guardian world

An unwanted guest in the guardian world

You are called to enter
For a purpose
It's not your own
And if you're wish enough
To pay attention
You'll see that you were warned

An unwanted guest in the guardian world

Through technological breakthrough
The pride of mankind
They developed a chemical portal
Parallel to dreams

Take heed for through this alien door
You enter uninvited
Into a world so great in power
It could crush your mind

An unwanted guest in the guardian world
