The dead keep their lives
Inside our memories
Or so they say
But I'm not convinced
That's not enough for me

On that terrible night
Caught between the hope of his call
And the dread of his fall
The door bell band and not the phone
Since then I'm all alone

Morning brings a new day
Last night he passed away
Daylight shines outside
My loss I cannot hide
They say life goes on
A part of me died along with my son

Who will comfort me now
Each day brings less hope to me
There's nothing left but the past

Who will comfort me now
Each day brings less hope to me
There's nothing left but the past
Will we meet again at last 
When I die

The dead keep their lives
Inside our memories
Or so they say
But I'm not convinced
That's not enough for me
