Remember when all the days were of gold
And time was always at your side 
The days of childhood are forever gone
Innocence lays shattered by the grave

Wait for a moment of silence
Before the day turns to night
Before the day turns to night
Wait for a moment of silence
Before the coming of the dark
Before the great storm
Wait for a moment of silence
And then the sun turns to black
The sun turns to black
In remembrance of days
That will never come back

We each must face our dying pasts
For every day must die
And though we strive to make them last
The future is inevitable

Wait for a moment of silence
Before the day turns to night
Before the day turns to night
Wait for a moment of silence
Before the coming of the dark
Before the great storm
Wait for a moment of silence
And then the sun turns to black
The sun turns to black
In remembrance of days
That will never come back

Wait for a moment of silence
