A spineless reign shows signs of fear of the enemy
Divide the land, tear out the heart of the nation
A war declared by a state on its citizens
It's our last stand:
We head straight to Amona!

We love our fatherland
Yet fear our government
Once on a mission but now banned
Keep getting high while we descend

Time's running out, maybe we are forsaken
By an ancient God whose anger has overtaken
His sense of pride his promise for the chosen!
We can not hide the monster you have awakened

We love our fatherland
Yet fear our government
Once on a mission but now banned
Keep getting high while we descend

This is the end, we will be gone by sunrise
We won't be dead thus we will walk among you
And find high courts who're pretty low on justice
Today it's me, who'll be tomorrow's practice?
