I am the eyes of my new religion
You are it's heart and soul
You are the new face on my new television
About to take control

(What do we leave behind but painful memories?
What'll be on my mind when heart and blood flow cease?)

I am the arms of my new religion
Your part makes me whole
Your show is top rated on my television
Sucks me in like a black hole

I wish my breath could roam inside you
And dissipate all fear
I hope you'll let our home surround you
Even when we're not here

I am the mouth of my new religion
You're the actor with the lead role
Someone please turn on my new television
Guarding life is my main goal

(Was there a point in time you felt at your prime?
Was life a progressive clime or just a successive decline?)

I'll gladly die for my new religion
All for one and one for all
There's only truth on my brand new television
Life's a never ending ball

I wish my breath could roam inside you
And dissipate all fear
I hope you'll let our home surround you
Even when we're not here

I am the eyes
You are the soul
I am your life
You are my all

This was my entire agenda
There goes your lullaby
A day will come and you'll comprehend it
For now this was my fair goodbye

(One small step for men,
One giant leap for mankind)
