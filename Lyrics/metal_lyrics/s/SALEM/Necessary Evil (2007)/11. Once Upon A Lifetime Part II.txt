Do you think you are safe?
Do you think they will spare you?
Do you think they are done with you
If they say that it's over?

So you believe it is over
Did they make you forget your dead?
Did they plant some hope in you
Before they ran for cover?

The world is a loaded pistol
I'll try to ease the pain
I'm here to secure a future
On the surface not down the drain

Did they put it behind you?
Did they say you could trust them?
Did they say they will not come for more
When this war was over?

The world is a loaded pistol
I'll try to ease the pain
I'm here to secure a future
On the surface not down the drain

I hear voices / a distant shadow / bloody traces
Is this death row?
Morning sunrise / endless darkness / foolish mankind
Divine sadness...

This was my main agenda
Here comes you lullaby
One day you will comprehend it
I think this is a fair goodbye
