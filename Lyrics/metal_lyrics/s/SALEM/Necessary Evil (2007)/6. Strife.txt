There's more than 24 hours of pain (hours of pain)
Present in every passing day (so i watch what i say)
So i watch what i say

Life is a strife
Time's worth a dime
Both of which I have none
It's a sign
Re-align
Although at my prime I live like slime
Once upon
Skeleton
A ladder to climb not for real just in mime
You can cry
You can sigh
But life will go on and leave you behind

There's more than 60 minutes of hell (minutes of hell)
Present each hour I know it so well so (I fear my death bell)
So I fear my death bell

Life is a strife...

There's less than 60 seconds of sin (seconds of sin)
I counted in one minute's grin (there is no way to win)
There is no way to win

Life is a strife...
