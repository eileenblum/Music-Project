At times I do have visions of the past
Some might last but most die fast
Like one Egyptian woman's dire fate
It's easy to destroy hard to create

Cinaron consuming her mangled severed limbs
Cyril is assuming that from now on he's at ease

Drag her off her lofty throne
Take her to Caesareum church
Blind should always lead the blind
And the brave will walk alone

(It's time to burn her blood
The witch will soon be dead)

Savagely butchered skinned to please a god
Brutally mangled it's time to burn her blood
Savagely butchered skinned to please a god
Brutally mangled it's time to burn her blood
Cinaron consuming her mangled severed limbs
Cyril is assuming that from now on he's at ease

Serapeum on fire
Idolatry must end
One last symbol remaining
The witch will soon be dead
