(Houston we have a problem)

This song will fester inside your little head
If time allows it, at a later date
This song is a testimony of what we were force fed
Beaten, battered and left for dead.

Cat and mice play dice underneath your bedroom window
To slice and dice and raise the price of war orphans and widows

I am the rage of a generation - misled, gone astray
I am the voice of liberation about to break the chain
Born for no good reason, made to feel at home
Practicing consumerism inside this pleasure dome
