Red blood, bad blood, cold blood, sad blood
Bloody all the way.
Blue blood, pure blood, mud blood, come blood
Wash blood stains away.
Draw blood, no blood, young blood, dried blood,
Snow blood, hot blood, you drew first blood.

Your drew first blood,
Having no victim, I find it odd.

(They say that blood is thicker then water,
I say that shit is thicker than blood.
You kept your word to the other world
So now we bleed and die.)

You kept your word to the other world,
It was a blast you didn't last

(Blood signed odium.
manufacture mutated revulsion
But he who swore to live by the sword,
His blood will spill forever more.)

You kept your word to the other world
It was a blast you didn't last.
To see the day the prophets say
Armageddon call to end it all.

Open the gates of hell!

Red blood, bad blood, cold blood, sad blood
Bloody all the way.
Blue blood, pure blood, mud blood, come blood
Wash blood stains away.
Draw blood, no blood, young blood, dried blood,
Snow blood, hot blood, you drew first blood.
