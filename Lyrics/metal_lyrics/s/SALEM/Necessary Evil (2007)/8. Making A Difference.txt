Some times I think that anything
Would be better than this
Inside my shrine no one's allowed
Hidden from passersby
Cerebral shelter from this world

Safe from this hell
You need no eyes.
To see the injustice
And breathe in the lies

Some times I think that anything
Would be better than this
Inside my shrine no one's allowed
Hidden from passersby
Cerebral shelter from this world

Feeling bad is not enough to feed the starving
Or call their bluff
Getting mad is not a way to aid the helpless
Who die each day

To make a difference we'd have to rebel
Against the system that's not treating us well
Against all religions who set us apart
Through hate and through fear you won't win my heart
Against mediocrity which says it's OK
To be wrong, go along, and have nothing to say
And against all the people who by bringing you
Down feel so right and important but their tongues are brown

Some times I think that anything
Would be better than this
Inside my shrine no one's allowed
Hidden from passersby
Cerebral shelter from this world

Safe from this hell
You need no eyes.
To see the injustice
And breathe in the lies
