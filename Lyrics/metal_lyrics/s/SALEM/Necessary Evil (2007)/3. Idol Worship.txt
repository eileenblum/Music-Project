There just one God
There just one God
There just one God
There just one... God!

Those admiring beauty
Those who worship skin
Those who fight for freedom
So they can live in sin

It's all just idol worshiping
God's might we are adulterating
Retreat!
Yet believe we are advancing
It's all just devil advocating

Trendy fashions the fountain of youth
Mask your path and cloud the truth
Don't cling to life yet throw it away
Making Idols to whom in vain you pray

Those who're blinded by money
Like those who live for sex
Those whose lives are funny
Yet they're popping pills for stress

It's all just idol worshiping
God's might we are adulterating
Retreat!
Yet believe we are advancing
It's all just devil advocating

There is just one God!

Trendy fashions the fountain of youth
Mask your path and cloud the truth
Don't cling to life yet throw it away
Making Idols to whom in vain you pray

Those addicted shoppers
And those who think they've won
Like those who blame others
Every time they use their gun

It's all just idol worshiping
God's might we are adulterating
Retreat!
Yet believe we are advancing
It's all just devil advocating

There is just one god
There is one just
