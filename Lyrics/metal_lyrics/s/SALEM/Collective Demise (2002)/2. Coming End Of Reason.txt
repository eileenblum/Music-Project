Show the world and your masses
Blood of the butchered you have slain
Behold, the coming end of reason
Death is a better way of life

Throw yourself at the mercy of the dead who seek revange
When blood is seen in haven
God knows his creature's gone insaine

Find no shelter from their wrath
Hate will lead you underground
Mark of glory - quiet maind
Brain dead leaders, out of line

Throw yourself at the mercy of the dead who seek revange
When blood is seen in haven
God knows his creature's gone insaine

You heed the words of the demented
Used as puppets in thier play of lies, hate and destruction
True dark ages abomination
