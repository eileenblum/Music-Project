Broken, not united you see the disguise
Broken, not united
See where we've come with our collective hate

We leave behind ideals of a dying generation
Slip away

Bread and blood is life
God's gift to mankind
Broken yet revised
See where we've come
Broken, not united

We keep dry
under the rain of terror

Broken, not united

We leave behind
ideals of a dying generation
Slip away

Berated not refined
You see through the lies
Broke your nets and found
a peaceful haven
Turn it upside down
We keep dry under rainning terror
Children die to fuel the flame of hate
Broken yet unite
