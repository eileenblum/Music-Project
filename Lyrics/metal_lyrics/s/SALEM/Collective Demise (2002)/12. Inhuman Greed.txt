Words of the wise
to self improve your lives
Who else will wipe your tears
as time goes by
Lies
to ease your existence
to make a small fortune
you're told to leave behind

Inhuman greed
Prey on the weak
Lose your soul
Before the meek
Inhuman greed

Before you sleep at night in your mansion
Do you practice what you preach?
Do you belive the lie?
Lie to the helpless
to make a small fortune
to set example
be featured on prime TV

On your knees - come for me
If I bring the cash you'll comfort me
You wish for pain to come for me
to come again and comfort me

Inhuman greed
Prey on the weak
Lose your soul
Berate the meek
Inhuman greedreed
