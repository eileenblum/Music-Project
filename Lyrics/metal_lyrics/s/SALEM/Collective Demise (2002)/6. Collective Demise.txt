In the eyes of death there is no difference between me and you
And though you feel hatred
Our mortality bounds us, bounds us

My days are fragile
I am at a loss
with the knowledge of our impending end

The weapons we bear are the symbols off our collective demise
Devised by our kindred
as an emphasis yo our unknown doom
