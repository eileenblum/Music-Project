Speak in numbers
Calculate
Don't you dare break all which I fake

Chips and numbers grind my life away
to fuel my hate for you
Cheers to our demise

While you kill time - cyberspacing
Time is killing you - hyperaging

Serve the master you created
Paint the A. dream Washington green
Decadence in soiltude

Time to bring the empire down

Now you are under a virtual spell
Slaves to your own invention
Life slips away
Slowly despair creeps in

While you kill time - cyberspacing
Time kills you - hyperaging
