Before you end your life
Recall all that you've done
Striving for wealth to gain some more power
All of which is now gone

No rest in your afterlife

Now we are left with a weapon
to be used in our Russian Roulette
Being self centered brings mass destruction
This is the world you helped create

No reat in your afterlife

No one can leave this place
A planet in chaos, unsafe
Rest in pieces
Rest in war

Why were you so  dumb?
Ruining the future for the ones you love
Die

Now you begin your redemption
Your rooting corpse will fertilize the earth
If no one follows your hollow ways
There is a new chance for rebirth

No reat in your afterlife
