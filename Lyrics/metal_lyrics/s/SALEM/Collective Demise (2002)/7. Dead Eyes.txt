Flaming skies of dawn
Churning perception
Life is just a game you care no more to master
Tarnished hopes, broken dreams pile and hide the sun
Blinked, and now you are gone

Dark cries fill the sky
Dead eyes multiply
Broken spine, fear shrine
Dear cries, perversions of the divine

Alone in this maze of shadows and errors
with no will to live in everlasting sorrow
Truth is a lie to deceive your heart
Carnage paradise
Poetic indifference

Dont speak of God
as if it's one
We, who lost a son think of it as none

Now you live on in my mind
As a memory - buried deep inside

Fighting for your rights
while breeding hate inside
