When the cozy fire heats your feet
Nothing happens outside but snow and cold
On the long and frosty nights
Grannies tell the elemental tales

- When the summertime comes to town
Elemental imps awake and beat the shit
Out of you

- Sleep tight, you little child
Maybe it's another village
That will suffer Svartby's wrath this year
Though you must remember that,
Oh, remember that -

There's nothing to afraid in this world
But Fire, Water, Wind and Mushrooms
Woods, Air, Mud and Stones

There's nothing to afraid in this world
Unless you are a human, little one
Pity you're a human...

Pity you're a human!
