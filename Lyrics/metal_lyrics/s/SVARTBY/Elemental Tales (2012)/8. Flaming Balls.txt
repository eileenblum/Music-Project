[Lyrics by Giftsvamp, Music by Svartby]

[Element: Fire]

Cinder piles, sparkling eyes
Rest in cauldrons, sleep in backyard
Time for a nightwalk -
Flaming beast jesters are ready to run

Wait for the dusk to come
Flaming beasts ready to run

Hot touch of fire palms
Hot touch of fire tongues
Dancing on buildings
Until ashen breaks
Fire balls jump and bounce

Houses, barns and carts -
Hail big bonfire
Cattle and poultry -
Hail the biggest steaks
Hail big bonfire!

Flaming balls, fire imps
Small beasts, approaching horror
Flaming balls, fire imps
Small beasts rampaging
