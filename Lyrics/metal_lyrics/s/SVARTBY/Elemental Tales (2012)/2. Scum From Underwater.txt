[Lyrics by Giftsvamp, Music by Svartby]

[Element: Water]

River and lakes are
the fucking wet place
Are the damn moist and dangerous place

Down to the depth go
Boats and nets
Most serious fishermen's threats

River and lakes are
the fucking wet place
Are the damn moist and dangerous place

Down to the depth go
Ferries and mills
With the blood spilt by water imps

Dread the chubby waterballs
From the deepest pools
Taking horse, taking man
Down with human rotter

Dread the chubby waterballs
From the darkest pools
Dread the fury of the depths -
Scum from Underwater!
