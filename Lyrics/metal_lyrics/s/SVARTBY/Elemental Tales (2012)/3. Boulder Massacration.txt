Rumbling heavy feet of stone giants
Tramping trees and swamps and fields
Mighty palms bending pine crowns
Kicking asses of the living

Watch approaching boulder giants
See them smash the walls and roofs
See them tramp the bloody puddles
Boulder massacration on the way

See them rise from the mud
Hear their heavy stride ahead
Feel the ground tremble
Footsteps of the earthen terror

Earthen imps in driver seats
Of the empty giant heads
Guiding mud-and-stone crusade
Guiding fleshless mindless cyborgs

Heavy stride through the landscape
They don't mind whether hill or thicket
Try to stop the rock-and-mud landslide
Boulder massacration on the way
