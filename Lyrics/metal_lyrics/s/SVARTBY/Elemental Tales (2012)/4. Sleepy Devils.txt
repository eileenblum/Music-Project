Icebound rivers and frozen air
Everything's still
Snowfall over the Svartby's
Dwellings

Icebound rivers and frozen air
Everything's still
Snowfall over the Svartby's
Dwellings
Curled under witch cauldrons
The fire imps slumber
Scum in the water dream, hugging
Teddy-salmons

Sleepy lil' devils

Sleepy lil' imps

Forest, everything veiled
With snow
Mushrooms and trees
Covered under white blankets
Snowy hills,
Dozing and grim
Slight frosty breeze over
The valleys

Sleepy lil' devils

Wait for the spring to come

Hush! Don't dare to wake
Sleeping imps
In their frozen cradles

Snowy hills,
Dozing and grim
Slight frosty breeze over
The valleys
Sleepy lil' devils

Sleepy lil' imps
