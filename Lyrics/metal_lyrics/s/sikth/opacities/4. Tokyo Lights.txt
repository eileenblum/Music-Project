[Music: Goodman (vocals only); lyrics: Mikee W. Goodman]

I liked the life of window walking
Night drinking 'til a morning crow greets
A peaceful stroll in Shibuyua's Golden hour
Communication has gotten so much
Easier with inventions by web men
There's so much more fun to be made

Yet I can't help but think Tokyo lights
Don't seem quite liked they used to be
And the moon is a different shade
And all the colours have changed,
Even if appearing the same
And I am lost in the crossroads
And I am lesser in love, and in love
But as I stare up at these
Winding lights and whirls
There be a flower being in the midst and
There be a shower of hope upon my being!
But I just remind myself and I must be clear
And obey these words in which wisdom was found
Don't forget to smile
Too many moons have passed without such joy
Don't forget to smile
Madly into the incoming traffic
Don't forget to smile
Madly at every eye that wanders by
Waving my hand but all of a sudden a gust of wind passes my face
And I am uplifted within
And now we are looming over a lake of low fog
And a bright figure slowly hovers above the mist
She found the fairest light
And she be smiling right into me
And I smile back effortlessly

Then she be a shadow
She disappears into the footstep din
And my boat is empty
But look!
She be standing there by the window,
And glances back
Maybe we can find that river
Which flows towards the sea of ancient waves
And flower beings, beyond the weeping trees
So stood there on the crossroads,
I tell myself again
Don't let your boat be empty
Don't be a sunken dream
Don't let your boat be empty
Don't be a sunken dream
Don't let your boat be empty
Don't be a sunken dream
Don't let the boat regret thee
For what you could have seen
