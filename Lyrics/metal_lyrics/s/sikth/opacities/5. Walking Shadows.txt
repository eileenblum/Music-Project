I told myself to go
Under ten feet of snow
I couldn't wipe the smile off my face
Under tainted light I did embrace

A medicated mind
Never knew what it could find
But when one day the colour turned to grey
Couldn't feel a thing and on my own again

These eyes staring back at me, darker than I've ever seen

So far away from home,
Every place I go
So far away from home
Everywhere I know

A thick fog which I can't see through
A thick fog which I can't see through

Where be thou destiny?
Lost in a state of sleep?
Tried to fly away so I could think
Ever since I proceeded to sink

Onto an empty road
Every step more alone
I lay awake another night to scream and say
(I) can't believe it's all turned out this way

Now all I see are shades, shades of grey

So far away from home. Every place I go
So far away from home
Everywhere I know

These eyes staring back at me, darker than I've ever seen

A new cityscape, new faces I find
I covert this new light to shine
You found me so soon
Melancholy moon, I wish you would just go away
Go away! Go away!

Sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep now

Oh how are we feeling now?
What about that black cloud that keeps following ya?
Don't you think it would be more fun in a world of bubble gum?
Welcome to the maze, the mist and the haze
(It's gotten so misty in here,
it's hard to see properly
Welcome to the maze, the mist and the haze)
This world just keeps getting darker,
Darker by the day, and all I see
Don't even think, Don't even try and think!

Come on, come on! We gotta fly away, fly away!
I don't know where were going just get on the fucking plane!
Where be the colours I knew?
Where be the flowers I used to know, where so?

When it looks like it's over
And hope is just a word
You may walk in limbo into the snow
You may feel like a shadow, like nobody is home
When you walk in shadows
Under the snow, under the snow
Under the snow, under the snow
