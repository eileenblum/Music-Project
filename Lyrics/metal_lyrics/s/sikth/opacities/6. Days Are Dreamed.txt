[Music: Weller, Foord, Pinney, Leach, Goodman, Abi Fry (viola); lyrics: Mikee W. Goodman]

The deepest eyes that I have known
The sadness beamed a light so beautiful

A heart can glow
So bright if it has grown
Through the pain and darkened doors
You smiled in summer rain
I swam on in, entwined to shine
But soon I fell
Couldn't even see myself

Walking into dreams
And walking out of love
Wake to find that you have gone
The winter moon has come

A heart can glow,
So bright if it has grown
Through the pain, and through darkened doors
You smiled in summer rain

Days are dreamed and days are gone
Days are dreamed and days are gone
Think I'll be moving on, moving on
Days are dreamed and days are gone
I guess I'll try and move along
Days are dreamed and days are gone
I guess I'll try and move along

Fire flies by windows, I see your face again
Bed-light days,
Moonlit haze
Fall to my knees again
Why? Why? Why? Why?

I wished for the day
That I could see your eyes again.
