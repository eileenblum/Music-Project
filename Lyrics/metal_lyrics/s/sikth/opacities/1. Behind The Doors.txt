[Music: Weller, Foord, Pinney, Leach, Goodman, Hill; lyrics: Mikee Goodman]

Take me to the magic land
Wake up here without a fear,
Float towards the troposphere
I be sitting on a cloud
In the bubble like a bee buzzing in it's honey tree
Medication helps the fixation
I see a land I knew so well
Everything seems stayed the same
Behind the door,
Where's the colour, the colour?
Behind the door
I can't see no mist no more
Behind the door
Where's the colour, the colour?
Behind the door
The lake of love which I adore

Control, where are you hiding now?
Shadows won't let me go!

Take me to the magic land!
Flower being in-front of me, summer rain above the sea
How can I go back again?
Look beneath the memories, climb up in the highest tree
Medication King Adulation
You flew so high, but hovered when

Beyond the door
Where's the colour, the colour?
Behind the door,
I can't see no mist no more
Behind the door
Where's the colour? The colour?
Behind the door
The lake of love (which I adore) (both)

Control, where are you hiding now?
Shadows won't let me go!

Why can't I sprout some kind of wings and
Fly up high past cloud up there I see,
Leave this damn mirror for a while and
Just try and get along with myself a bit better

I can see there's something wrong
I thought I'd say goodbye
Is there a missing page, that I can never turn?

You can't find the light when you wake in a well
You couldn't see what's right in front of you 'til you fell
Hold on to hope someday you might find
A flower being so bright to make the entire world shine [2x]

Do we sail through waves nobody knows?
Do we sail beyond the sky now?

Take me to the magic land!
Take me to the magic land!
I'll be sitting on a cloud
I'll be sitting on a cloud
Medication helps the fixation
I see a land I knew so well
Behind the door
Where's the colour, the colour?
Behind the door
I can't see no mist no more
Behind the door
Where's the colour, the colour?
Behind the door
The lake of love (which I adore) (Both)
