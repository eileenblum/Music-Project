[Music: Weller, Foord, Pinney, Leach, Goodman, Hill; lyrics: Mikee Goodman]

We saw the golden age
Digitally decay
Under ruins now
I see a carrion crow, carrion crow
Now he be championing
These philistine philosophies
This wretched industry
Keeps on spitting out clones,
Spitting out clones

The world we love in disarray
The world we loved became estranged

Lost! We're sinking, we're sinking, we're sinking now
Lost! What can we do? What's next now?
Lost! We're sinking, we're sinking
We're sinking now
Lost in an endless commentary

As every thought is sprouted out
All the lights go out
So hop on the wagon or
Be a mystical tree, a mystical tree
In the age of monotony
And philistine philosophies
Condensing everything into a digital hole
A digital hole

We see a pathetic final lap
They're falling like dominos
Falling like dominos
We see sugar coaters selling clones
Falling like dominos
Falling like dominos

The world we love in disarray
The world we loved became estranged

Well now we don't where were at because
There's too much congestion and a lack of invention
Material eyes requiring constant attention
It's the mystery lost in a web, in the well
As the spider awakes and decides what to sell

Hold my hand to hope we fly beyond the coal

You can't lose what you don't know
So you can't find what isn't gone
It's just a new era evolved
Or have we devolved?

Eyes seem to come through the wall
Mechanical wizardry rule
Suppressing the waves in the wool
Keep on staring at the screen

Losing light,
Tainting sight,
While we then light up the candle,
While stranded,
No handle on what comes next
Anti-passion makes an empty old din,
Because a fearful eye's pulling strings for thee
Watch on
Round and round and round it goes
Human nature!
Round and round and round it goes
Human nature!
Round and round and round it goes
Human nature!
Round and round and round it goes
Human nature!
