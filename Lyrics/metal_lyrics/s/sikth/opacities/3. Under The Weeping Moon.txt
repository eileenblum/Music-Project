[Music: Weller, Foord, Pinney, Leach, Goodman, Hill; lyrics: Mikee Goodman]

Welcome to the city face
A pretty haze upon the face
Whatever you see it's all up to thee
Whatever you see it's all up to thee
Million years of evolution
Rides the tide to devolution
Can't you feel the energy?
No, no, no what do you mean?
All the negativity?
What do you mean? What do you mean?
Don't trust anybody
Don't trust anybody!

Now all I see are guises of ghosts
In the street vermin (elite)
The minions will sleep neon lights
The smoke screens they whisper neon lights
Suppressing the weak neon lights shine

These city lights are conjuring fear
As shadowed soon disappear
I'm in the crowd of puppets again
I see the eyes beneath the reign
They're creeping through the alleyway
They multiply surrounding my face
Million years of evolution
Ride the tide to devolution
Don't trust anybody
Don't trust anybody!

Now all I see are guises of ghosts
In the street vermin (elite)
The minions will sleep neon lights
The smoke screens they whisper neon lights
Suppressing the weak neon lights shine

Celebration of disgrace
Under fear they reign
Celebration of disgrace
Under fear they reign

You don't aspire for solitude now do you?
You hearts can heal and fly up high again

What is it to be? They say
Materilust can speak
Where be? Under a weeping moon
Battle beneath the sleep on to
Battles of endless greed
Too true
Why can you not see?

And eventually
They will become
Cold and empty beings
Why so?
The puppeteers control
Battle beneath the sleep I see you!
Battles of endless greed
Under a weeping moon

Now all I see at last I can see
Are guises of ghosts guises of ghosts
In the street vermin elite (both). Elite. Reign!!
The minions will sleep neon lights
The smoke screens they whisper neon lights
Suppressing the weak neon lights shine

I see you, I see you
Under the weeping moon, I see you
Under the weeping moon
I see you, I see you, I see you
Under the weeping moon
I see you, I see you, I see you
Under the weeping moon
