[concept and lyrics by Mikee W Goodman]
[additional lyrics by Justin Hill]

Clinging on to any piece of mind
That elevates me beyond those thoughts
Start to focus, I'm flowing again
Got it sussed now

Flying high, check it out it's so sweet
Suddenly I'm chillin on a white beach
Then the sun disappears
Lightening strikes the tree that falls on me

Please sing along
My life is just a page saying
All gone wrong
Suddenly I don't feel so strong
Like a castle in the sand, then it gets washed over it's
All the same
All collapses before my
Eyes

Why am I here tolerating everything when it feels incomplete
With all that was meant to be
Left looking for a chance to leave

Don't think like that, fuck the way you're feeling
Now you gotta concentrate on breathing
Try to look up Think about what you got
Listen to me I wanna be alive

Try to be strong
Even though it may be so confused
Why but why
Everything is going wrong
I am fighting now
With the desperation
In my mind
A thousand thoughts are spinning round my
Mind

Why can't I control my thoughts
See past them out into the light
But everything stands against

Everything goes wrong all at once
Try to think positive or the pain will flood
Into your mind and under your skin
Thought for today is not to give in
Thought for today is not to give in
Thought for today is not to give in
Open your eyes or the pain will flood in
Thought for today is not to give in

Your real life is there more

Everything goes wrong all at once
Try to think positive or the pain will flood
Into your mind and under your skin
Open your eyes to what you could be
Thought for today is not to give in
Open your eyes to what you could be
Open your eyes or the pain will flood in

Real Life

Your Life

[Mikee scat]
