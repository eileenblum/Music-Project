Yeah, I've seen your second face
What is your moral for today, is it still lies and trickery?
I don't understand why
This man has a thousand faces.
How can I put my trust in this presentation?
What is your little scheme today?
It was so cool before you came.

Always
Always
Lying.

Lie to my face again.

All that you ever wanted
Was to see (to see)
How much you could take
From me.

One day you may see
The half man, which you aspire to be.
With your selfish lies and your selfish greed
You fuckin' lied to me

The scent of the obscene...

Draw trust from whoever fell
For this display of deceit.
Deceived.

Makes you
Smile again.
Look into your soul again.
Look at,
Look within your soul.

All I see in you is
How you need (you need)
To think  about the ones
You deceived.
Why can't you see
The hurt you cause?
Or can you now see
The untruth, which makes no sense to me?

Now, see no morals, untrue
Now that I've seen through you
Something of no morals, untrue
Now that I've seen through you
Something of no morals.
Untrue.
