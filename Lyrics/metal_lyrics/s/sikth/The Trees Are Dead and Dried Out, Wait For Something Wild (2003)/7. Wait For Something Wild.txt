Sullen hours of the evening
Wait, I heard a bird, it's singing your song
Even though you didn't have one.

I can't help but think of you
Why do I bother?

Are we speaking the same language?
Miss communication going round &amp; round
Spinning back around.

I need to know how you feel.

Why don't you come back with me tonight?
Think I like you
Why did you come back with me tonight?
Is this love, or just infatuation for you?
Sleeping in my arms tonight
Wait a minute
I never told you how I feel
Probably because I don't really understand you.

Spin!
Swim!
Scream! [x3]

When I think of you
I get tired
I get tired
Can I let you in, let you in?
Can I really trust you, I don't know?
I want to fly now.
Think to myself.

You should say what you mean.

We are now
You were

When you were
When you were
When you were
When you were

We are
We are more
We are no more

I'll take her there
Until she don't wanna be with me
Painted flowers in the restaurant
The air there wasn't clean

I'm missing you, that's all I know

"Lights reflect the water
Wind blows quietly
The Water doesn't care.
It's dark and the lake is frozen
Wait for something wild.
The trees are dead and dries out
Wait for something wild..."

Do we sail?
Do we try to sail?

In the lake it has a beauty
That in her I also see.

Well I thought it was a strange world.
Still do,
Too many making my confusion
Just where are we now?

I've been dreaming of a beautiful world,
Its could be someday, maybe with you.
Are you an illusion?
Talk with me again one day
Do you ever make sense of yourself?

You were always in the back of my mind
Thinkin' of you
I could never understand why
Now I know I always want to be there for you.
May not be the same as before
At least I'm with you
You never let me know how you feel
Probably because I always confuse you.

Spin!
Swim!
Scream!
