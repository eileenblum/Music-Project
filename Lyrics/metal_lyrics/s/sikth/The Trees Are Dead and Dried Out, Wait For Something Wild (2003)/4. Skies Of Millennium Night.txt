The minds of power, devour nature
Where can I find the four-leaf clover?

Why do we wonder and where do we wander to?
Thousands suffer, we sleep, they starve, we eat
Instead of fighting, why not feed &amp; cloth the poor?
I hear some screams but none of them are for joy
World full of greed and so much suffering
We dream on,
We dream on.

Why? Lies, lies, greed,
Lies,
Selfish greed,
Look at the sky
Look at the sky
Look at the sky
Look at the sky
Look at the sky
Look at the sky!

Can you hear their cries?
Wake up! Wake up!
Is this the only way?
Where, where can we find peace?
And where has the joy gone, the joy?

What makes us sour?
Do you understand
The melancholic tears of the stranger?

Take a look at the sky
It's so Beaut-ti-ful

Why do we have
To want more always?
They say it's only human nature.
Strength from your soul
We all get old
A lesson learnt, a scar is born
New day, new rain.

Go to the well
You can-not-drink-it
The water in the well.

Why do we have
To want more always?
They say it's only human nature.
Strength from your soul
We all get old
A lesson learnt, a scar is born
New day, new rain,
But I'm still torn...

Look at the sky!

A light lit from a wind turbine in the desert
It appears spinning round &amp; round a long way away.
This is a fine idea
Brought from the ocean winds that keep us thinking.
