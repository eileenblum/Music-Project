Love is in the air
Hate is in the air
Death is in the air

Waith, yeah...
Let me think for a moment
About a world with painted paper
And so much cement,
So much cement.

So what is if for and meant? Never?
I don't understand why
A fool? Yeah? Oh?

I built a ship this afternoon
I plan to sail it up to the moon.
I want to fly, I want to fly,
A fool? Yeah?
I want to fly, I want to fly, I want...

Can't we all dream?
Can't we all dream?

I want to fly up to the moon then to somewhere new
I want to sail somewhere new.

Can't we all dream?
