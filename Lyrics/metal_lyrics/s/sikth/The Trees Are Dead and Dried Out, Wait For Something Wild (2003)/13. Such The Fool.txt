Paint your face, Cover the black heads 
Short top, bulging up your saggy tits 
Cut your skirt just a little bit shorter, 
Dont you wanna?
Toilet paper, going down your top 
Do ever think about, bringing out some condoms 
When you aim to go out and get fucked 
Fucked all night long 

Wearing No Un-Der-Wear
To slip it in and bang bang 
And tattooed on her butt cheeks 
Fuck Me. 
Everybody here comes in your face 
Your wanting everybody looking on in your direction 
Have you looked at your skin complexion 
How could I ever put my dick in you?
Bitchin erected muscle lickin 
Think I'd rather be chokin my chicken 
Do you ever think about who your fuckin, 
Fucked all night long

I see 
That you don't want to be safe 
Protection gets in your way 
I don't want this disease, 
So...

Sucking off in the toilet 
That door has, your name, written on it 
You fuck there more every night now 
Everything in town.
Semen, dripping from your eyelids 
Running down your cheek your rancid. 
Tattooed insert across your lips 
I am disgusted. 

Wearing No Un-Der-Wear
To slip it in and bang bang 
And tattooed on her butt cheeks 
FUCK ME. 
Everybody here comes in your face 
Your wanting everybody looking on in your direction 
Have you looked at your skin complexion 
How could I ever put my dick in you?
Bitchin erected muscle lickin 
Think I'd rather be chokin my chicken 
Do you ever think about who your fuckin, 
Fucked all night long 

I see 
That you don't want to be safe 
Protection gets in your way 
I don't want this disease, 
So...

So what do you do? 
Go out and get fucked by ten different men
Then go and brag to your friends 
Do you think that makes you a better person? 
Please tell me what you were like as a virgin 

Just an easy whore,
Open the door and come in, 
Let the transmitting begin. 

Do you ever think about the people your fucking 
Bet you laugh at them thinking they got lucky 

May aswell strap an advert to your back saying
Fuck Me, Free Disease 
Stupefied Bitch 
Open Legs 
Insert Quick 
Philosophy of a slut 

You're such a Fool 
You're such the
You're such a Fool 
You're such the
You're such a Fool 
You're such the
You're such a Fool 
You're such the Fool

I see that you dont want to be safe 
Your on a carrousel with no horses 
You just slide up and down on the poles 

You're such a Fool 
You're such the
You're such a Fool 
You're such the
You're such a Fool 
You're such the
You're such a Fool 
You're such the Fool
