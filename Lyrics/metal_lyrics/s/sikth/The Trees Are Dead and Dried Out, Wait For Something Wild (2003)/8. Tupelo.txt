Looka yonder! [x5]

A big black cloud come! 
Yes, a big black cloud come.

Come to the Tupelo,
Come to the Tupelo.

Yonder on the horizon, 
Yonder on the horizon.
Stopped at the mighty river,
Stopped at the mighty river,
And sucked the damn thing dry, 

Tupelo-o!
Oh, Tupelo,
In a valley hides a town called Tupelo.

Distant thunder rumble,
Distant thunder rumble,
Rumble hungry like the Beast,
The Beast it cometh, cometh down, 
The Beast it cometh, cometh down, 
Wow-wo-wo,Tupelo bound.

Tupelo-o!
Oh, Tupelo 
The Beast it cometh, Tupelo bound.

Why the hen won't lay no egg, can't get that cock to crow,
The horse is spooked &amp; crazy, oh God help Tupelo 
God help Tupelo,
God help Tupelo,
Oh God help Tupelo.

Ya can say these streets are rivers 
Ya can call these rivers streets 
Ya can tell yaself ya dreamin' buddy, but no sleep runs this deep, 
No!
No sleep runs this deep, no sleep runs this deep 
Women at their windows, ain crashing on the pane 
Writing in the frost Tupelos' shame, Tupelo's shame,
Tuprlo's shame,
God help Tupelo
God help Tupelo
God help Tupelo
God help Tupelo

Oh, go to sleep little children, the sandmans on his way ,
Go to sleep little children, he sandmans in his way ,
But the little children know,
But the little children know,
They listen to the beating of their blood, 
Listen to the beating of their blood ,
Listen to the beating of their blood, 
Listen to the beating of their blood!

The sandman's mud! 
The sandman's mud! 
The sandman's mud! 
The sandman's mud!

And the black rain come down,
The black rain come down,
Black rain come down,
Water, water everywhere, 
Water, water everywhere,
Where no bird can fly no fish can swim 
Where no bird can fly no fish can swim 
No fish can swim 
Until The King is born,
Until The King is born, 
Until The King is born...

Tupelo-o!
Oh, Tupelo
Until The King is born in Tupelo..

In a clap-board shack with a roof of tin 
Where the rain came down and leaked within, 
A young mother frozen on a concrete floor, 
With a bottle and a box and a cradle of straw...

Tupelo-o!
Yeah! Yeah!
Hey, Tupelo!
With a bottle and a box and a cradle of straw

Well Saturday gives what Sunday steals, 
And a child is born on his brothers heels,
Come Sunday morn the first-born dead,
In a shoebox tied with a ribbon red... 

Tupelo-o!
Yeah, O Tupelo
In a shoebox buried with a ribbon red...
