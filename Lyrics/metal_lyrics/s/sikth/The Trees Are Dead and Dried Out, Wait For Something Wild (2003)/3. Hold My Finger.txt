Hold my finger!

I do want to with you
Just understand it's not right now

Dont wanna fuck right now 
I'm chillin' with ya 
Can we not just lie here and make love spiritually?
All Alone, with you 
Your eyes I'm looking through 
When I wake up I promise I'll be 
With you girl?

Then I'll give you all of my attention 
Damn right, I'll have my morning erection 
I'll give you some lovin'

Jump!

Sometimes I'd like to do whatever you're into 
Building this perfect moment 
But as we lie here my mind slips away.

I'm so ashamed of myself to do this to you 
It's all I'm good for now, chick, please forgive me 
And it ain't no joke, my stoner loving finger hold, 
Goodbye to the negative vibes.

Can we not chill, go to sleep with my arms around you?
But then you scream and your right
I should be there for you. 
So now I try, check my pulse to make sure I'm alive 
Sorry chick I cant get in 
That Mood now!

Listen, chick, I can hardly function 
My mind says chill don't need that affection 
Sorry, but I don't want to
Arrrrrrrrrrr...

As I walk, I think too hard,
Cannot grip 
Just what went wrong 
So if I let this out, could I float away again? 
Just want to fly so far away again.

As I fly 
Try to get out of these negative vibes  
I'm so bored
As I float by
What is my destiny, am I somewhere that I shouldn't be? 
I feel alone 
But when I'm with you it's, alright 
But when I'm without you, I'm so...  
I feel that
Feel close to you 
You couldn't understand why 
But you want puppy loving and five orgasms 'til the night
Is through 
But it wont happen 
Cos I can't explain this with you.

OK, it's up, now we fuck, I'll go put on a Johnny 
Open the pack, then it's back flopping before me. 
Mind starts to hurt, you scream 
And talk to me like
I wish you could know exactly 
What I mean!

I'm so wasted, I'd not last anyway 
You'd think I suck and never see me again 
Just chill out chick, chill out, see what I see.
