There's no ambition, told from vision
Pre-recorded, Maze of wisdom
Bland Street Bloom, a moronic feeling

No ambition, plague of pigeons
Twisted in your maze of wisdom
Shake-up, make-up, fake-up
Think you need some healing
No ambition
Same old wrong millennium Scorn
Maze of Wisdom
Bland Street Bloom, a moronic feeling

Pretty little birds singing in the street
Few trees left, bare and shivering

In this hollow bitter street

No ambition, told from vision
Pre-recorded maze of wisdom
Bland street bloom
Bland street bloom
Bland street bloom (as the)
Bland street bloom
Bland street bloom (as the)
As the dove rains blood
As the dove rains blood
As the dove rains blood
As the dove rains blood

A world of wonders (dove)
Man-made mechanical thunders (blood)
A world of wonders (dove)
Man-made mechanical thunders

Like stuffing a turkey
Gutless, hollow
Man-made premeditated hole
Like a rock that doesn't roll
You are the rock that doesn't roll
Like a rock that doesn't roll
You are the rock that doesn't roll
Empty coal into the fruit bowl
Become a machine
Just one of the people
Welcome to the middle road
You soul has now been scrolled

No backbone, just torn and thrown
Into the snow you go
No backbone, just malignant groans
Of what and where and now
Of what and when and how of what
Don't count on nothing being free
Because when you're in the concrete sea
Not you or me or in between

I can't stand them, I can't stand this
About as much fun as drinking a pint of piss, of piss
Can't wear that and you cant smoke this
It's bitter as a cold brew, bitter as a cold brew, pint of piss

A world of wonders (dove)
Man-made mechanical thunders (blood)
A world of wonders (dove)
Man-made mechanical thunders

As the dove rains blood over the streets
Man-made mechanical thunder
I think I've seen this kind of thing too many times before
Mediocrity has never been a way of life
I've been inspired by seeing all this strife

Bland street bloom
Bland street bloom
Bland street bloom
Bland street bloom

I can't stand them, I can't stand this
About as much fun as drinking a pint of piss, of piss
Can't wear that and you cant smoke this
It's bitter as a cold brew, bitter as a cold brew, pint of piss
