Is this the desperate mile?
Are the seagulls hungry still?
Did the pond run out of water?
Turn into a motorway?
Did the forest see itself slaughtered
And modelled to decay?
Did the kitten pur?
Did the mermaid slur?
I can't see a wind of wind of a way
We wander then thunder
Winding road old cold abode
Under mountain snow and hollow skies
Where is the grey but to survive first you must be alive
Pinch your skin and look within
Find a thought and a fish finger
Baked beans upon your plate
It's gotten late again
Where did the wilderness weep tonight?
Do. You. Know. The. Way. Out?
Do you know the way out?
