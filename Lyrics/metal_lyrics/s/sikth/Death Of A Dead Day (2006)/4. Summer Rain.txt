Well
I built you up
To be something that you were not
Something too good
Something bright
Something too perfect
Too right
Goodnight
Now you're running out of sight
Goodnight
Say it once again

I built you up to be something you were not
Someone too good, too perfect, too right
Goodnight
Now those tears are out of site
But once again you bring the summer rain
It hurts much less this way
You always
You always seem to say
Then bring the summer rain

Feels like we're not meant to be two
But when I'm with you it feels just like you
And me
(In a happy tree)
The waves of love around our beings
The energy
The summer Rain
Well it didn't seem to smile on us those days
Now it seemed to smile on us those days

Distances make worlds so small

I built you up to be something you were not
Someone too good, too perfect, too right
Goodnight
Now those tears are out of site
And once again you bring the summer rain
It hurts much less this way
You always
You always seem to say
Then bring the summer rain

Like a friend
Like a friend in a new lover
Like a friend
Like a friend
Where's the friend in my new lover?
Like a friend
Like a friend in my new lover
My love's grown fond of you
But I know there ain't a damn thing I can do
Everyday I've thought of you
Every day, every day
Every day I call
Then we try to walk but then we fall
Every step I seem to take and go without you
It's just an empty wall
Every step I take
Every step I take I walk alone
As I call out of you
Of you
But I know there ain't a damn thing I can do
As I call out for you

The waves of love around our beings
The energy
The summer Rain
Well it didn't seem to smile on us those days
Now it seemed to smile on us those days
