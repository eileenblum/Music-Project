When all the hail seems far away
In my sight
Like it won't ever rain here
In this light
In this light

Let me sit right by your side
In this light
Let me sit right there

Sail
As the water lays under our sky

When all the hail seems far away
In my sight
Like it won't ever rain here

Let me sit right by your side
In this light
Let me sit right there
Alone
On my own

In this light we sail
As the water lays under our sky

Let me sit right by your side
In this light
Let me sit right there
In this light we sail
As the water lays under our sky
In this light we sail
As the water lays under our sky
