I heard your voice today, it echoed through my mind
I can't stand the thought of losing you
I'm so dumb these days are getting so confused
I wish I could have the chance to be with you lady again (again)
Can't find the words, I can't find the words
(Happiness lies within you) Just know happiness lays with you and the birds
You and the birds
The birds
Singing on a summers morning

Why are you so far, so far away?
So far, so far away?
Now the moments gone, the moments gone

Took so long to find you then you fly away again

(I heard your voice today)
I heard your voice today
(It was on my)
It was on my answering machine
I played it back again and again and again
(And I regret)
And I regret not listening more clearly when I was drinking
Oh the words you said, with a dainty little whisper
(With a dainty whisper)
With a dainty whisper
Whisper

Sinking in your sand I saw my heard still weeping for your lure
You are the clover I have warmed to
The blossom always growing in your heart
Now I think I love you
I think I love you

Why are you so far, so far away?
So far, so far away?
Now the moments gone, the moments gone
The moments gone, the moments gone

Look at the calendar
How long till I see her?
I got a plan
To see you in that distant land
Try to live
I want you to be here
You opened up to much
I wanted to come up and hug you
But you're five thousand miles away
Up in the sky
I'd have to fly away from here
Here
The gravy smear
From here
Here
The gravy smear
Just say whenever
Want to be with you now lady
Out of this grey climate too true
So take a look in the mirror
Shiver shiver vagabond
Take a look at the state of the
The beast in front of me now
How could you desire a east like me?
A beast like me?
So far away I can not take it
Feel alright?
Feel alright?
Feel alright?
I wanna try to walk but there's no ground beneath my feet now
Feel alright?
Feel alright?
Do you feel alright?
As we sail in through this dream of summer love?
