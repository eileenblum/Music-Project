A question never left me through our days
Buried all inside for this man you know who wanted it all then
And now this film is ending
The credits pass, the stories done
I'm still searching
Keeping it all away from you

I'm not so sure that this silence will speak
Anymore

Left falling down again
Cos this feeling wasn't there
But I'd leave it all
To estrange me from this place I've come to know

My palace of dreams, our fresh water streams
We ventured together, we ventured apart
A lake of love rain from above
I want to feel your zeal
To feel your zeal
What shall I do? Be strong like you?
What's right? What's wrong? What's going on?

A question never left me through those days
But when it tasted stale
Everything really looked greener on the other side
Cos I was just clinging to
A moments past that we could no longer sustain
I kept it all away from you

I'm not so sure that this silence will speak
Anymore

Left falling down again
Cos this feeling wasn't there
But I'd leave it all
To estrange me from this place I've come to know

Take my hand my love, my dame
We could walk through those cranky lanes
But I lay and I sway in my submarine
On top of the world in a plastic ashtray
Well where do we go and where do we fall?
Someone needs something and something needs all
