I can't make out my roads when everything's just spinning round
Round and round
Quick stop and think above those clouds
Swim to the sea you believe towards tranquillity

Everything I seemed to see was grey, dumb, unfused
Well it's raining now. Can you feel the tears of now?
Now?
Now?
Weeping now?
You wanna say why you're walking in a well for?
Best look up soon before it all freezes over

Why are we wondering?
Why are we wondering?
Why are we slaughtering?
Why are we wondering?
Why are we wondering?
Who is this alien?

Well it's hard to row when the boat is stuck
And it's snowing and I can't make out
Any roads when everything's just spinning round

I can see you there
In the nothing snow
Well it's all dark now

I can't
Make out any roads
When everything's just spinning round
Round and round
Quick stop and think above the cloud
Swim to the sea you believe towards tranquillity
Everything I seemed to see was grey, dumb, unfused
Well it's raining now and I can feel the tears of now
Now
Venting passion and emotion keeps us spinning round
And when that is gone, it's a grey numb song

Why are we wondering?
Why are we wondering?
Why are we slaughtering?
Why are we wondering?
Why are we wondering?
Who is this alien?

I can see you there
In the nothing snow
Well it's all dark now
But I look into your eyes
And saw all wasn't right
You were chasing
You were chasing painted dreams

They sow snow
They don't want you to wake up
What?
What?
Whatever
Waking up the same folk don't grow
It's the same as before, the same as before
As the earth spins round
We're all wailing on the ground, what for?

They turn the page so
They turn the page so (Why?)
I turn the page so
They turn the page so (Why?)
You turn the page so
I turn the page so
You turn the page so
They turn the page so
You turn the page so
You turn the page so
