Flogging the horses
Report in the office
Camels walking free
While their Drinking honey tea
Lets encourage freedom of speech
Then kill it with a bullet down on its knees
Rampant remains, shattered in distain
Your work is done, the trauma lives on
Rampant Remains, shattered distain
Your work is done, the trauma lives on

Let chickens escape their torturous fate
Let eagles fly in the wind
Let knowledge be learned from the chosen child (Jesus)
Wait for something wild
You talk of the save, show us the way
This world is ours to feed
But then you open the door
And everyone hits the floor
Why should these people bleed?

No sign of the boots to free and loot
All they can see
We travelled so far, we travelled so far, boots on the loose
Goose in a noose
Why all this envy and hate?
Shape me a tooth, to replace like a spoof
Still it looks real all the same, still it looks real all the same

Let apes roam free
Let people be (Let people be)
What they are and are
Nine to five ain't the same in the wild
Nine to five ain't the same in the wild
Nine to five ain't the same in the wild

Let apes roam free
Let people be (Let people be)
What they are and are
Nine to five ain't the same in the wild
Nine to five ain't the same in the wild
Nine to five ain't the same in the wild

Washed up crows and unwashed clothes
The muse isn't gone till you run through the hum
Empty shoes drowned by these fools
All together bitter weather
It's the same as ever
It's the same as ever
When is never?
(Pecking, pecking) this week we weep
Then back asleep we fall
Into the same old shoe
Into the same old shoes
You fall into the same old shoe
You fall into the same old shoe
