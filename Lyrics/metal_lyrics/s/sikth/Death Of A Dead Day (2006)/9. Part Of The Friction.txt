Yes, no, yes, no, maybe, no
All you're going to here in this world that rocks and rolls
Something mistaken
A dream taken from magazine fiction
I fear and so I turn
Wake up and listen, nothings like it should be
Well now I've got a taste
Well now I've got a part of the friction
Something I
Something I missed out on
Something I must have missed out on
Something I must have missed out on

As we fall astray
Trying to live through your games
This ride takes another turn
You can turn the bluest skies to grey

It's a new day, not much to talk about
Must be walking over a dead sea by now
It's a new day, wipe a small business out
They fall to faint and dry the paint dies
Watching still we find TV open
Middle aged skin growing older becoming aware
Listen to the ones who make sense of the freak train
Give them let me
Drive to make them challenge you
Lights are falling death of a day, deader than day
Victory?
Victory?
Victory?
Death of a dead day
I fear and so I turn
I'm out here, one little piece of meat
Well now I've got a taste
It was nothing like I imagined it to be
We have decayed in fear
We can't see past the beer

As we fall astray
Trying to live through your games
This ride takes another turn
You say that you are here to stay
You can turn the bluest skies to grey

Well if it isn't another vulturistic man
Feasting on the carrion
Through all sincerity
And serenity
And goodwill
Is lost in a spin with you
When all you seem to do is count on others getting less than you
That's your aim, that's your game
You're all the same
You're all the same
You're all the same
You're all the same
You're all the same
Playing the game
Playing the game
Playing your games

So far
You've taken
Away so we fall
See through
Your mountain
Of lies as we fall

Something I missed out on
Something I must have missed out on
Something I must have missed out on

As we fall astray
Trying to live through your games
This ride takes another turn
You can turn the bluest skies to grey
