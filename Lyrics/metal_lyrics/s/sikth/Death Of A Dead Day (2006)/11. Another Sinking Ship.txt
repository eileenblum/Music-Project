Liars
Shape my frown
I see through your words
Stone down like a hound
Liars
Faceless clowns
I see through your heroes
Swimming to the shore

Picaroon you come so soon, you've taken all I had
My tolerance exhausted paint a picture only using

Lying to the faces that make you a less lonesome man
Picturing a way of life where fear and hate could not appear
Can it be this life you lead, well nothing seems too clear

What are we doing here?
Swamped by fear
What are we doing here?
Fear
Brings death brings fear
What are we doing here?

Five thousand more lies are laying in the mist
Not suitable equipped
Lesson of the day, you only betray
Lesson of the day
Lesson of the day
Of the day
You only betray
You only betray
Lesson of the day
You only betray
You only betray

Was it a so called man with a so called plan?
Well I don't want to be another television lamb
Television lamb
Television lamb

Fear brings death brings fear

What are we doing here?
Swamped in fear
What are we doing here?
Fear
Brings us death and then that makes more fear
Is this how it's meant to be for you and me?
Lying to my face again, you never found yourself

Something tells me that things may have gone too far
Warning the next hell ball in your quagmire

Fear of the
Fear of the
Fear of the
Fear of the
Fear if the
Fear of the
Fear of the
Fear of the
Fear of the
Fear
Picturing the ship you sank
Try to make me, walk the plank

Picaroon you come so soon, you've taken all I had
My tolerance exhausted paint a picture only using

Lying to the faces that make you a less lonesome man
Picturing a way of life where fear and hate could not appear
Can it be this life you lead, well nothing seems too clear

What are we doing here?
Swamped in fear
What are we doing here?
Fear
Is this how it's meant to be?
