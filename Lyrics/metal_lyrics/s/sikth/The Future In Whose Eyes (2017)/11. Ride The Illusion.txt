Do you need what you think you need?
Head first into the zombies feed
Keep on looking at the ground in front of you
You look like you're lost
Turn on your GPS!
Sign outside reads Happy Hours
But every face looks grey and dour
Underachieving and under exposed
Lacking any culture but the local sinking hole!

Ride the illusion, where did we flow to?
Stuck within a traffic jam
Why can't we get through?
Ride the illusion, ride the illusion!
What became reality?
Shells of dilution

We used to dream far beyond our reality
I used to see more happy beings

The riddles of suppression
Let your mind breath
Riddles of suppression
Let your mind breath
Can you see beyond?
Do you dare to dream beyond?

Do you believe what you cannot see?
Or only what is shown through your TV
Keep on searching for a trend to smother you
You look like you're lost
Turn on your GPS!
Sign outside reads Happy Hours
But every face looks grey and dour
Authenticity falls into that digital hole
Now look at all that's happened in the stain on this world

Ride the illusion, where could we flow to?
Technicolor flower dreams
Why can't we get through?
Ride the illusion, ride the illusion
What happened to reality?
Ceaseless dilution

We used to dream far beyond our reality
I used to see more happy beings

I watched a DVD a friend gave me
Inspired by footage of the last one hundred years by the sea
And what I saw before my eyes
Scenes of effortless joy on their faces
Where's it all gone wrong?
Oh so connected, Internet infected souls,
They don't know where to go
We're in a world of progress and decay
But which was may that be
