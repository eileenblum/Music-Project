When you know the red in the fire of the light
You cannot settle for the shadows that dance through the night

I found myself in a forest clear, surrounded by wooden animals
A rallying call, a rallying call. Someone, please make some sense of all

The flower beings and all those I have known
Will I meet anyone like that again?
Can't predict the future
Wishing I knew what I know now, how so?

When you know the red in the fire of the light
You cannot settle for the shadows that dance through the night

I found myself deep within a dream
Holding my love so beautiful
Then I woke up, all alone
Trying to make some sense of all

The flower beings and how I must now grow
Will I meet any being like that again?
My eyes are always open
But my wings have not been well at all
Remembering her smiling in the rain
I said

When you know the red in the fire of the light
You cannot settle for the shadows that dance through the night

Now all the leaves have fallen
Sitting on a bench
Here in deep November
Midday rising, chattering away
I look into her deep brown eyes and remember
How it felt, when she flew away
But also when she walked into my life
Silly man kept looking round the corner
Then it all became too late

No, it didn't get any better, better
No not better than this
It doesn't get any better, better
See our eyes entwine
Now our hearts can shine
Now our skies align together
Well I rue the day
Yes I rue the day
Without words

When you know the red in the fire of the light
You cannot settle for the shadows that dance through the night
