Have you found love in this life?
Within yourself and outside
Can you see flower beings?
Can you see demons too?
Can you hear tomorrow's moon?
Do you think you came too soon?
Or belong in a previous decade, or century?
Do you often look to the past?
Do you wish the wind could take you back?
Do you like it when it rains in the summer,
Or when leaves fall and scarves come out?
Do you ever talk to the moon?
