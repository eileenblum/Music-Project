Are you the caster of shadows in light?
You're shackling their hearts
You're weakening their knees

Are you the master of what they should believe?
Projecting through the airways on everybody's screen

Call the captain!
Another mercenary
He went against eh social rules of this society
So walk the plank! (Yeah!)
Throw him overboard! (No!)
Wash his name in mud. (Yeah!)
Let him see who's in charge
Quick get a bucket, the water's coming in
You better be quick because the water's red,
We might just have to swim
The sharks are circling round, lapping up the fear
Could the black sheep of society now drown in his own tears?

Full moon
No need for flowers in your hair
Full moon
Broken beyond all repair
Walking like zombies
Hold on to our screens
Priming the poison
Swallow to conform

Fear and danger!
They got to plant the seeds
This vulture headed culture fed on negativity
Yes there is evil
And humanity is flawed
Is it getting worse? You tell me hope is now forlorn

Scandal mongers
Everywhere you see
They seem to thrive on the demise of every falling leaf
There is sinking sand
And underneath a pit
Of all the sunken dreams they have seen swallowed into it

For all the good that happens
And the magic of this world
Why do we not focus on positivity here first?
They're on another witch hunt, can't even be heard
The riddles of humanity
Seeking out to score

Full moon
No need for flowers in your hair
Full moon
Broken beyond all repair
Walking like zombies
Hold on to our screens
Priming the poison
Swallow to conform

Character destruction for the entire whole world to see
Make sure the main focus is on negativity
The riddles of humanity there's really nothing like it
Spinning round in circles trying to seep with in a wound
They are all wishing for the worst
Waiting for the bubbles to burst
Wishing for the worst
Waiting, waiting for the bubbles to burst
Casting shadows, shaping waves
The viscous circle spins around then falls unto the floor

Profiteers of misery
Why does it always turn out this way?
Profiteers of misery
Why does it have to be this way?
