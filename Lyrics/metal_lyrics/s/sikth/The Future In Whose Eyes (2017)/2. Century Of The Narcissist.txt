Consolidate as one.
Keep all your information in one place
Every walking day
Thoughts do collide
So what's right?
Your opinion?
Statistical position?
A million commentators wanna give you a reason
Consolidated tongue
Keep,
All your inspiration sinking in the sand

Voice recognition and touch ID
Another useless cunt! Reality TV
How far has it gone? And where will it go?
Tracking your bones on your mobile phone
Century of the narcissist?
Authentic talent will be dismissed
Is this the century of the narcissist?
Authentic talent will be dismissed

So plug in (Update.)
We need to know your everything (It's expired.)
So plug in,
Now we know you're everything
You're out of date

Do I ride against the tide
Or hop back on the wagon?
Get up to pace
The twenty first century
Saw the decline, still there's light
Beyond that drizzle
The saturation
The million commentators trying to get you to listen
Masters of the thumb
We can't all become
Let me think now

Voice recognition and touch ID
Another useless cunt! Reality TV
How far has it gone? And where will it go?
Tracking your bones on your mobile phone
Century of the narcissist?

So plug in (Update.)
We need to know your everything (It's expired.)
So plug in,
Now we know you're everything

Inter-connectible socialites
I see no mist, no stars
You have a choice to join the herd by that middle tree
This is where you can sedate yourself

In a maze of minds through circuit boards
What are we heading for?
Surrounded by anchors that cannot be raised
But I remember
Mystery seeping through my veins
Dream beyond tomorrow what path you should follow
Tell me now?
Calling all flowers to summon up your powers
Of the mind!
Keep your eyes wide open,
Don't fall into the sleeping maze

What have we now become?
How far will it go?
When will we start to put chips
Into our minds?
Now we can see the deterioration of man
