[feat. Spencer Sotelo]I'm on top of a mountain above the clouds
I came here to find my smile again
I'll have to accept it's lost, lost in the cosmos
NO!
Well what are you gonna do now?

No light in the well
It's so hard to climb those slippery walls
You know you ain't got wings attached to your back
No light in the well
Wake up, it's not too late
You need to find a crack of light to follow

Below the wall of ice you go
It's gotten so dark it must be hard to see
It seems like you're falling further from yourself
You're not the one to feel this way

You got to find a way through
Remind yourself you can be strong,
Try and find a place where you belong!
Look you found a crack in the ice
Now you need to take control before it swallows you whole!

Soon enough I travelled through a tunnel underneath the sea
Went to a country new to my eyes
A beautiful lady comes into my sight
Try to converse somewhat,
Soon enough she tells me I have sad eyes and walks away

No light in the well
It's so hard to climb those slippery walls
You know you ain't got wings attached to your back
No light in the well
Wake up, it's not too late
You need to find a crack of light to follow

Below the wall of ice you go
It's gotten so dark it must be hard to see
It seems like you're falling further from yourself
You're not the one to feel this way

Not gotten out of bed for days now,
The pain, it's gone right to the bone
If you don't wake you may never be
Able to stand on your own two feet again

For all the waves of weeping wounds
For the days that came too soon

Searching for cracks of light!

Look you found a crack in the ice!
Now you need to take control before it swallows you whole
Look you found a crack in the ice!
