Something's wrong, that made me realise
maybe now we're not so right
Two people living different lives

I used to think that
I would never
Ever be so sucked in
You proved me wrong when I held you and felt it take me over
With you by my side
I wanna be with you
And stay with you
It's so embarasing
That I

Fell In Love
Fell In Love
Fell In Love

I
Feel
So
Week
When I'm with you
Why can't I get you out of my head

When I go to sleep
I lay my head
Then all I can see is you in front of me
Why Did You Creep into my head One Day
And you never went away
Why did you do this I am Scarred In The Ni
cest Way But I want it to heal Feel so pathetic
that I can't control my emotion
s Why I am so hyper everyday Because of you

If you weren't so perfect
Maybe I could get over you
Do you think I deserve this
Why cant you just be cool

And I wonder where, what you are As I fall

I feel so weak
When I'm with you Make me feel
that I loved you once
It felt so good

I wanted to be with you
Fell in Love
Fell in Love
Fell in Love
Get out My Head

When I go to sleep
I lay my head
Then all I can see is you in front of me
Why Did You Creep into my head One Day
And you never went away
Why did you do this I am Scarred In The Ni
cest Way But I want it to heal Feel so pathetic
that I can't control my emotion
s Why I am so hyper everyday Because of you
And I wonder where,
what you are As I fall Take my soul away from you
And I wonder where, If you weren't so perfect
Do you think I deserve this what you are
As I fall
Sucked Me In With

Just three words These three words
