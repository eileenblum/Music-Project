Paint your face, Cover the black heads
Short top, bulging up your saggy tits
Cut your skirt just a little bit shorter,
dont you wanna
Toilet paper, going down your top
Do ever think about, bringing out some condoms
When you aim to go out and get fucked
Fucked all night long
Wearing No Un Der Wear to slip it in and bang bang
And tattooed on her butt cheeks
Fuck Me
Everybody here comes in your face
Your wanting everybody looking on in your direction
Have you looked at your skin complexion
How could I ever put my dick in you
Bitchin erected muscle lickin
Think I'd rather be chokin my chicken
Do you ever think about who your fuckin,
Fucked all night long
Cheap Slut
I see,
That you dont want to be safe,
Protection gets in your way,
I don't want this disease,
Sucking, off in the toilet,
That door has, your name, written on it
You fuck there more everynight now
Everything in town
Seaman, dripping from your eye lids
Running down your cheek your rancid,
Tattooed insert across your lips,
I am disgusted
Wearing No Un Der Wear to slip it in and bang bang
And tattoed on her butt cheeks
Fuck Me
Everybody here comes in your face,
Your wanting everybody looking on for your attention
When you fuck is there still sensation
How many men have been in you
Bitchin, erected muscle lickin,
Think I'd rather be chokin my chicken
Do you ever think about who your fucking
Fucked all night long
Cheap Slut
I see,
That you dont want to be safe,
Protection gets in your way,
I don't want this disease,
So what do ya do
Go out and get fucked by 10 different men then go and brag to your friends
Do you think that makes you a better person
Please tell me what you were like as a virgin
Just an easy whore
Open the door and come in
Let the transmitting begin
Do you ever think about the people your fucking
Bet you laugh at them thinking they got lucky
May aswell strap an advert to your back saying Fuck Me, Free Disease
Stupefied Bitch
Open Legs
Insert Quick
Philosophy of a slut
Your Such A Fool
Your Such the
Your Such A Fool
Your Such the
Your Such A Fool
Your Such the
Your Such A Fool
Your Such the
I see that you dont want to be safe
Your on a carrousel with no horses
You just slide up and down on the poles
Your Such A Fool

Your Such A Fool
Your Such the
Your Such A Fool
Your Such the
Your Such A Fool
Your Such the
