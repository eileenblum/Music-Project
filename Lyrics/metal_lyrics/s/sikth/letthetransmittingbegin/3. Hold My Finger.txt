Fly, what you never know
I will not bring you down I swear
Dont wanna fuck right now
I'm chillin with ya
Can we not just lye here and make love spiritually
All Alone, with you
Your eyes I'm looking through
When I wake up I promise I'll be
With you Girl
Then I'll give you all of my attention
Damn right then I'll have my morning erection
I'll give you some loving
Sometimes I like to do whatever your into
Feeling this perfect moment
Im so gone now that
I cant feel life
Im so ashamed of myself to do this to ya
Its all I'm good for now chick please forgive me
And it aint no joke, My stoner loving finger hold
Goodbye to the negative vibes
Can we not chill go to sleep with my arms around you
But then you scream and your right I should be there for you
So now I try, check my pulse to make sure I'm alive
Sorry chick I cant get in
That Mood now
Listen chick I can hardly function
My mind says chill dont need this affection
Sorry but I dont want to
As I walk
I think to hard
Cannot grip
Just what went wrong
So I light up
And I'll float away again
Start to lose this trap she kept in
As I fly
Try to get out all of these negative vibes
As I float by
Im so bored
What is my destiny am I somewhere that I should'nt be
I feel alone
But when I'm with you its alright
But when I'm without you I cant
And I feel so
Feel close to you
You wont ever fly
But you want puppy loving and 5 orgasms til the night is through
But it wont happen
Cos I don't like this away
Am I not as you imagined me
What you get is what you see
OK its up now we fuck I'll go put on a jonny
Open the pack then its back flopping before me
Mind starts to hurt, you scream
and talk to me like dirt I wish I could know exactly
What I mean
I'm so fucked right now I'd not last anyway
You'd think I suck and never see me again
Just chill out chick, chill out see what I see
