I wait for the storm my people come, to lead us all away
I wait for the storm my people come, to lead us all away
Reincarnate in generations they walked, with only one thing to proceed
Every hundredth year, show us their face to us and this mortal wound
Out of their tombs to seek, collectors of flesh not men, nor women but creatures this sea of sand turned them to
Fear them not fear them not fear them not

They hide deep into their sea oceans of dried waves, sand flushes against me
To hide deep into this sea and bury their dead in the hot sand
Your family's here, death made out of sand long for the days when pain was easy
Trapped and chained, within themselves help us bring the storm, be one with us
I wait for the storm my people come, to lead us all away
I wait for the storm my people come, to lead us all away
Fear them not fear them not fear them not fear them not
