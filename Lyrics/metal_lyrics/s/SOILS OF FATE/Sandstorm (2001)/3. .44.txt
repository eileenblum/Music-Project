I can't swallow the hunger, I fear myself my duty is to conquer, I'm wild but no beast
All the harm I've caused is a reflection of a man who's lost but reborn
Built up in me tension, desire now I'm back, I love to hunt
A maniac with a forty four to finally let it all go, pull off,
See it all just vanish it all just vanished, disappeared
Tied up, ripped up, I stick my gun down your throat
One last look at, thee, those who's now ready for the fall, those who once feared for their lives

No I am not the beast oppression is my passion I invite you to a reality beyond
No weak soul can ever destroy me based my entire world on humiliation
So proceed into submission an invitation to my reality
I can't swallow the hunger, I fear myself my duty is to conquer, I'm wild but no beast
All the harm I've caused is a reflection of a man who's lost but reborn

I'm back to strike again, to hunt again wipe the regret out off my face, I'm here again
I see the eyes scream, faces that bleed, is this my blood the naked body, the ones I killed
You never got buried I hit and hit, my fist went deeper, deeper down
No beast is so wild that he cannot feel compassion
No beast is so wild that he cannot feel compassion
No beast I am, therefore no compassion I feel
