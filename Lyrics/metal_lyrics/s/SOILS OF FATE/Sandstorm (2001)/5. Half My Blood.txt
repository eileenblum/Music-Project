Time to meet your maker meet your maker

Something went wrong in my world above as I speak he enters as I sleep he dwells
What ever made me the chosen tell me why I am here against my will I put the skills to the test
Made them face, made them meet their maker now you, you now owe me, never I go empty handed
I share the misery and cause the end of someone's dreams I brought them Death put me to sleep
That shit ain't a big deal a goal, a point to accomplish this was and will forever be my fate in life

Gun Finger Trigger Shot Pure blood transform me,
Stick Cut Flesh Bone I am unpure
Gun Finger Trigger Shot Pure blood transform me,
Stick Cut Flesh Bone I am unpure I am unpure
What breathes inside this heart and soul the burning sarcasm is me in another form
What breathes inside this heart and soul the burning sarcasm is me in another form
What breathes inside this heart and soul the burning sarcasm is me in another form
What breathes inside this heart and soul the burning sarcasm is me in another form
Half of my blood

Put me to sleep, that shit ain't a big deal you, fatuous, feeble, want to kill me now
Can't you see, this was my goal, my point, my fate in life
It's all a tragedy the end for you still to come
Take a look from my point of view to see the suffering to be able to touch
It is more than just a fantasy hear the anger and smell the pain smell the pain

Tears, blood and piss you're dying
Tears, blood and piss you're dying
The final act of my disquisition
Tears, blood and piss you're dying
Tears, blood and piss you're dying
The final act of my disquisition
