Life runs out can't stop these bullets life runs out, I hijack the weak
Put my guns close, so I make you scream tell me this is not the end a gun in your face, two bullets away
I will fool the world and make it twice won't stop until I see the light
Take your breath away I take the truth and set it free
Cross this path, enter my empire hear the words I am your King

This not what you intended your life to be, life will rip you anyway just wait and see
I'll hunt them down, force them, use them you couldn't take the pressure too weak and too dumb
This is not what you intended your life to be, life will rip you anyway just wait and see
I'll hunt them down, force them, use them goes down, I head for another one

My life was once built up on greed finding my pleasure my own glory
Once life became worthless compared to my needs
And the whole world turned against me in just one day just one day
My life was once built up on greed my pleasure was my own glory and life became worthless, to some it still is

Life runs out, I hijack the weak put my guns close, so I make you scream
Tell me this is not the end a gun in your face, two bullets away
I will fool the world and make it twice won't stop until I see the light
I take your breath away a bullet, right into your bone, I deny your own existence
The life I rip, no loss for me, I deny your own existence
