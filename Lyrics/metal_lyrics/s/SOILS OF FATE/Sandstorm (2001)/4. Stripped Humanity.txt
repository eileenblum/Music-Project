Being this ripper of humanity a shredder of blood with a dead conscience
I live each day like a new-born through my dead, lacerated victims
My time will also come, yet I carry on with my blood, my hunger, my hate
A bringer of death, so I have come into this world
An angel, but without wings a hunger for blood awake

I have come you will die crush your face bring you down
Why do they come to me why wouldn't I let them die?
They would beg me on their knees why wouldn't you let me die I live to kill

What is your blood for if not for shredding come to me I create your death
Your open sores drool deeply burned into your soul I live to kill, my bond to the Dead
I was ripping your humanity each stroke of my blade running through
Your life full of pain and degradation why do you still want to live why do you still want to live?
