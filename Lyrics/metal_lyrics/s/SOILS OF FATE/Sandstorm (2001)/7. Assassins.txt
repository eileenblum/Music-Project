Assassinator
Watching, with eyes like a mother watching her child Assassinator
Every move, these modern-world-machines they see Assassinator
Like a rapist haunting, destroying a lifetime I praise this world for turning killers into heroes

An own species for the world to see, an own species for the world to hate
Assassinator make us worth the sleep, thank god that they came for me
Kill and slaughter you can have my family, life is shit to them now too for me
What is it that drives you the blood bath, having power over people?
Or questions of mine are many, take a look at me what do you see?
Defeat time is right turned out to be now your rules, your game, my loss

Please wipe me out, blow my head, please wipe me out
Please wipe me out, blow my head, please wipe me out
Please wipe me out, blow my head, please wipe me out
Please wipe me out, blow my head, please wipe me out
