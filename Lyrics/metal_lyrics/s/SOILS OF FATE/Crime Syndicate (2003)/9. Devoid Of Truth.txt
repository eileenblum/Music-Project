[originally by Suffocation]Your life has been planned since the day you were born
Affliction undefinable, condemned to suffer with the norm
Burden of despair traits of self denial
Raised and misled by life's light I refuse let shine for me

Corrupted misconceptions of how life should really be shadowing existence in your plagued reality
Feeding off the error of the ones your emulate defection to deception and to mentally incarcerate
Devoid of truth monarch of deceit and lies plagiarism overrides devoid of truth
Captive through what's carved in stone bleeding is the moral throne
Beckoned to false entity betrayed by eternity devoid of truth
Writhing in the treachery face down in your misery I feel not a thing
