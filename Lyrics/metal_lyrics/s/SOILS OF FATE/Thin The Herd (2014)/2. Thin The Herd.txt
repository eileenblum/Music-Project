The way of the animal
Innate wisdom
Evolution's scorn
And now bringing disdain

This thin line, spells disaster
Physical degeneration sloth... manifestation
This feeble cretin we call the modern being

[2x]
Thin the herd
Cleansing of the breed
Endorse the weeding out
And rise the elite

The way it's supposed to be...
Naturally genetically engineered
The reigning code of morals
Have inconsistencies

Thin the herd
Cleansing of the breed
Endorse the weeding out
And rise the elite

Thin the herd
Remark, reform, restore

The way it's supposed to be...
Naturally genetically engineered
The reigning code of morals
Have inconsistencies

This evolution is set back
Is driven by the meek
And now to be restored
And slain repeatedly

Cleansing of the weak
And rise the elite

This evolution is set back
Is driven by the meek
And now to be restored
And slain repeatedly

Cleansing of the weak
And rise the elite

This evolution is set back
Is driven by the meek
And now to be restored
And slain repeatedly

Cleansing of the weak
And rise the elite
