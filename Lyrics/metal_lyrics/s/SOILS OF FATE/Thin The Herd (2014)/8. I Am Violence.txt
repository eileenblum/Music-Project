Born into this violent world
I am who I am
I will not change what I've become

Love the tension with adrenaline rushing
Before it all breaks out into a violent flood

Cascade of sticks and stones
Comes hammering down
I live for the moment before
I kill you

Where's the smile on your fucking face?
You fucking fairy

Take you down
I'm on top of you
Rape choked
As I pound your face in

Tears and blood,
Sweat and piss,
Just sing out your pain
You fucking fairy

What goes around, comes around all back to you
Your plan backfired
Not much left of this blood brother

What goes around, comes around all back to you
Your plan backfired
There's nothing left to live of long for

Take you down, belly up, head butt
A sting of reality you're forced to face
I am violent, relentless, fierce but sane
Now I'm the one that sends you off to hell!

I am violent,
I am violence

Violence
Violence
Violence

Take you down, belly up, head butt
A sting of reality you're forced to face
I am violent, relentless, fierce but sane
Now I'm the one that sends you off to hell!

Violence
Violence
Violence

I am violence

You believe you still have a shot?
Looking like a bitch struggling, trying to fit in
Nothing left for me to finish
Nothing left to respect at all

You believe you still have a shot?
You believe you still have a shot?
Looking like a bitch struggling, trying to fit in
Nothing left for me to finish
Nothing left to respect at all

Nothing left for me to finish
Nothing left to respect at all
