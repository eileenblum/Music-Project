Unto the dedication, service sealed in blood
Victory of mortal damnation, rites of baphomet
Rise the shadow, I am the black warlock of ancient sorcery

Black witch I sodomize thee, bloodbath and self-stimulation
Recite the spell of power, chant of black damnation

Blood covered parchment, incantation of my master
I gain immortality, my dark soul undestructable by light
An earthly void, upon the plateau of wisdom,
Prince of the damned am I, sorceror of a black power...
