Body suffers from hatred
The holy hellish whore
Satan's scholar of wisdom
His dark temple
Kill
Sunk in blood, torments
Torments of hell in Satan's solitude from hatred
Destroy and crush
Quarted christ, blood on the cross
Kill
Turned to (wards) Satan
666 - the light of Lucifer
The eye of the stabbed
Brutality of the soul, hatred of the body
666 can't be understood
Darkness to the death of absolute
The war of the weak
Destruction and devastation of the false kings
Satanas Doctores Sapientae
The will of the god - his crush
Kill
The crush of JHVH
Sound of bones - breath of the depraved
Crush of the weak, rules - slaves
Strenght and wisdom, the power of the soul - destroy
Kill
The sorcerer of death
In the dark robe without light
Destruction of the light by the darkness
The request for destruction
Love - Will - Hatred
Silent curses, Irreligious book of SoratH
Full of hatred and brutality
Black fire everywhere around us
Dark for hatred
Dark learning
Turned sound of the rocks
Ill and insane souls
Whore from the hell, a non-holy tone
There are no limits for love
Love is a will, a will to hate
There are no limits for hatred
(His Will)
A body without help
Sound is a realm, a sign
The dark side of JHVH
Emptiness is the last step on the road
