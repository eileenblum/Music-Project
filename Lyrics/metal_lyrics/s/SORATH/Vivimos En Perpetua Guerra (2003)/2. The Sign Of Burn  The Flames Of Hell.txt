The voice of a child, the sign of burn
So let it peg out alongside of the other
And not noly ruler of the heaven
A dark snake shines from a high mountain
The shine reaches the stones of sacraments and abomination
So let me peg out alongside the beast
Which looks for its youngs
Archangels of the future are the dust of today
Patriarchs of the past are scum of
The holy place Jerusalem
Who murders his descendants one after another
The flames of hell, just higher and higher
And heavens grow old and disappear
Or new clouds of hell come into the world in the glow of powerful souls/ghosts
I'm neither a ghost nor a demon
But a man, one of thousands
