So fly in the dark, the mighty angel of doom
I know and I'm waiting, I know love is the end
My flame will devour you all
Eternaly and forever as the pacts
Which brings me the flame and the will
To destroy you as nothing
The love for destruction of you all
Your God
Fly on my wings
Dark pact with the devil
Eternal flame of my wings will swallow you up
As nothing
So fly in the dark, the mighty angel of doom
I know and I'm waiting, I know love is the end
