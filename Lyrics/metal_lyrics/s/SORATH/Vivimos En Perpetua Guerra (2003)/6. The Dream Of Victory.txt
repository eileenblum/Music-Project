Darkness on the mind, darkness in the heaven
I feel pain in my heart
I feel this endless pain more and more
And I wish it end
Me, a dreaming man, on the verge of the fall
Into the world I hate, I hate so much
The rule of necessity, I want it stop
I want it stop, but I'm powerless
I hate this world of hypocrisy and stupidity
Inrecognition of values rules above all
I hate so much
I want to destroy it, destroy it totally
I believe in destruction
The more I love, the more I hate
The more I love, the more I hate the world
Separated in the clouds of new Heaven and new Earth
Where only Agape rules
My desire and the dream of victory
