Space clock and its curse of balance
The sea of sound disappears in endless nights
Love is coming from the fall of the matter
And people pray it not to leave
Space clock and its - and its curse of balance
The depth of forgotten beings
Flames of beautiful time
The humble position of demons
Is a secret question in the race of magicians
Two journeys and one leads astray
Darkness and their non-holy task
