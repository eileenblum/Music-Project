The lost legions of Bafomets
Sun rays of the night sky
I was standing in the fog which was thicker than pea soup
The legions of Bafomets took up their arms
Thousand years in fight
With insane desire for evil and blood
With desire to light and burn
With desire for suicide
Obsessed with the demon SoratH
Obsessed with Sun and its darkness, Obsessed with Woods
Blasphemy to christ and brutality of the soul
(Wish to purify darkness and find its meaning)
Blasphemic Luciferia, Dark Demony
Fight in the middle of the dark night
During the full moon, during windy nights
In the labyrinth of numerals and magic signs
Fight in the middle of the dark night
During the full moon, during windy nights
With insane desire for evil and blood
With desire to light and burn
With desire for suicide
