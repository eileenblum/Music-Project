The name of mystery is unpronounceable
And is mortal, as death
And
Me
Where is question of
Immobility
Astral pictures
Are lost in darkness of our chaos
But holy
Chaos stays
Because is
Holy, as all
Slaves of fate are poor
But the are holy
Their face is holy
As their walk on way

All is
Needless
Why?!!!
Because we are wretchs
We are wretchs as
Unity itself
Because we are
Wretchs
We are wretchs as unity itself
The name of mystery is
Unpronounceable
And is mortal, as
Death
And me
Where is question of immobility
Astral pictures
Are lost
In darkness of our chaos

But holy chaos stays
Because is holy, as all
Their face is holy
As their
Walk on way
All is
Needless
Why?!!!
Because we are wretchs
We are wretchs as unity
Itself
We are unity.
