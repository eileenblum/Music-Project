I'm calling through the gate to destroying
And calling of forgotten
Ones, earth, water, fire
I'm
Calling through the gate to destroying
And calling of forgotten
Ones, earth, water, fire
Wind,
Nature, demon, cold air beats in
My faces from glass
Appariation of
Sicks and heresies
Dark and
Eternal angel of doom and destruction
Of calling and destroying of
The waters
Judge of harlot,
Fall of babylon
Wind, nature, demon, cold air beats in
My faces from
Glass
Determinated to
Destruction, don't trust in holy heresies
What destroys yourself and
Your way - your
Don't trust,
Fall - again and again
To dark waters from bloodrevenge,
Revenge
Holy lies, their book, cursed lamb,
Holy lamb
Sorath is eternal assassin of angel michael
Die
Warning is
Vain
Nail the holy lamb on
Crucifix
Beast, beast,.. satanas
I'm calling through the gate to
Destroying
And calling of
Forgotten ones, earth, water, fire
Wind, nature, demon, cold air beats
In
My faces from glass.
