Satanas in my soul, freedom of holy soul
Oblivion and freedom, fete of
Soul, flesh and forests

Blood of forgotten ones - revelation
Hellfire from heaven - new
Heaven, new kingdom, new earth
Satanas
In my heart, turned to hell to try us
Eye of sick phantom, madness on
His altar
His glory, victory -
Forgotten world
Sword in his hands, my heart in chalice
Grail of vile
Blood, holy grail of demons

Secret grail of horror and devastation, holy grail of demons
Satan's
Grail, Lucifer's shine,
Behemoth's cry
World of blood, immersed in chalice of blood, bloody
Grail
Christ-violated of holy
Grail
Satanas in my body and in my word
Devil in his soul, in soul of
Forests
In my heart
My
Heart in my holy grail
Fete - of holy ones and bloody ones
Wizard of
Own spirit
And the third eye

Hell madness
Devil in his soul, in soul of forests
In my heart, my heart
In my holy grail
Fete -
Of holy ones and - bloody ones
Devil in his soul, in soul of forests
In my
Heart, my heart I my holy
Grail
Fete - of holy ones and bloody ones
Eternal fire and its linemystery
Of beast (master Therion)
666 - number of holy name of great invocation
Circle of dark
Ones - around material circle

Satanas in my soul, my key to the holy names - of dangerousness and
Mystery
Ave in my soul, Ave
Satanas in their and my word
Eternal and forever persisting.
