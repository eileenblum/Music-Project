Night of my birth
By now in a womb of mother nature
Birth of divine
Demon as divine hatred

Incarnated demon is waiting for birth to life
Demon his home are
Forests
Holy prophecy from
Black aureole
From cave of sin
Opening - incarnation of dark
Spirits
Angel of darkness
Demon of Evil
His place is there up
On the highest mountain of hate
Blood on the
Black-mountain sides

Revelation of creature, revelation of satan
Full of blood, blood of a
Man like this creatures
Dance around black table
Birth-offering of a man-demon
Sacrifice to
Dark powers
And your life
Will be demon
I'm a man with soul and spirit of demon
Offering was
From blood and mighty

Burning of my flesh
Birth-sacrifice of a man-demon
Birth-sacrifice of
A man-demon
They devour
My flesh
They poison my man
Transformation-demon, bloody ritedemon

My era of coming, I'm god
Of myself
Why do you invoke of others
Demon of a lie
Great awakening of body is coming
Birth and existence, birth and eternal existence
In own lie-paradise
The bow
To my head
They humilited
Below my foot
They're dying and I'm smiling
Lost in my eyes, thrown
Into heaven
And paradise of
Laws how they wished
They are slaves, rise to heaven
To my
Heaven, present-coming time
Eternal
Prophecy from unknown stone
Opening, oblivion, remembrance
Distant
Awakening of unknown landscape

Pentacle of forest
And friends
Demonic emotions, evil impostors
Black
Sacrament, black freedom,
Without law
With hidden law - with law of movement
Eternal
Movement - black dance
Uppermost creation
New aeon of my body
Demonic clouds - day of my creation
From my
Flesh, from flesh of somebodyelse

Carnage, monstrous, massacre of body
Creation of demon, creation of
Blackness
Eternaly saved by
The fire of brimstone
Burns in kingdom of lake of fire
Immerse under
Surface of fire
This lake
Is beautiful, most beautiful than heaven
Damned and eternal, lake of
Evil
Black heaven, complex
Rite
Consecrate sacrifice-a man
Astral digesting of human
Sacrifice, high-powered transformation

Cremation of remains, cremation of ashes
Shed blood throwed
To
Astral world
Inception of creation

Of demon
Created by fallen powers
Created by fallen angels
Created
By mendacious demons
Created
By astral creature
Their hidden substance
My sacrifice, Lucifer's
Sustenance, to life of fallen
Creation digested
Created for hate by ancient
Forests
Immolation, high-powered immolation

Apparently impossible act, apparently unrealizeable rite.
