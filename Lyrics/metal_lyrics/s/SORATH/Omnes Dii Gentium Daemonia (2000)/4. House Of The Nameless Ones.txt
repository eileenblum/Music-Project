House of nameless sacrifices reposer far away
Lost ones and unholy
Ones are throwen there
It is
The supreme domination on the earth
And abounds in mightest
Power
Forbidden hand gives them
Order - there
Freedom instead of repentance
There is killing
Holy
Because abounds in wisdom and
Knowledge
House of nameless sacrifices reposer far away
Forbidden
Hand gives them order there

The sicks dance there o own graves
And deads throw about
Flowers
Unholiest law is there
The law
Of holiest blasphemy
The dominion is strong ones, who has feeble
Bodies
Own blood sheds in
Chalice of fornication
They bow down the face of beast and despice
Holy blessing
Their home is
Chapel of abominations
The sicks dance there on own graves
Their
Home is chapel of abominations.
