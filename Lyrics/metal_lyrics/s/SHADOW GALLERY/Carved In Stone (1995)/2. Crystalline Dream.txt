[Music: B. Allman, C. Cadden-James, C. Ingles Lyrics, Vocal Melodies: C.Cadden-James]

Hold onto these 
Memories I grant you 
The gifts of our lives 
Lost in the sands of time 
Deserts forever 
Relentlessly barren 
I crossed them all 
In the blink of an eye 
I command light and solar winds 
To transport me 
The deepest assurance 
I speak with my mind 
Caves of glass 
Shatter before me 

The wheels are in motion 
Forever they turn 
And are carved in the great book of life 

There in your room 
Alone in the shadows 
I smashed down the walls 
And set you free 
I carry the torch 
That trembles the mountains 
Seen visions of power 
Beyond all belief 
You close your eyes 
I reach out and touch you 
Reflections in pools 
The deepest of dreams 
Rumors of war 
Rage in your heart now 

The wheels are in motion 
Together we turn them 
Forever they're turning away

Come down with fire 
I want to love you want to take you into my heart 
We'll cruise the starways 
And from the moment that we touch our love turns into a crystalline dream 
Fly where your dreams go 
With open eyes it's the dawn and you're alive 
No time or space here 
I walk in castles of gold 
Our love turns into a crystalline dream
