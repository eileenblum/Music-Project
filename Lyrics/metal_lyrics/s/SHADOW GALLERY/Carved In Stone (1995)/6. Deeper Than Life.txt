[Music: B. Allman, C. Cadden-James Lyrics, Vocal Melodies: C.Cadden-James]

On the run from 
Suicide 
Love breeches 
Temptation 
On the edge boy 
What's inside 
You better look 
You better run and hide 
Storms coming 
A hurricane 
Tear the roof from the 
The foundation 
Crystal ball smashed again 
It's all there in the balance 
Hanging 

Wrong time to not regret your actions 
These are dangerous roads that we travel tonight 
I'm tuning into you your eyes are faintly glowing 
Can't you see the truth my mind is deeper than life 
It's a strange dream and I know you're in it 
Clinging to a rainbow by your fingernails 
I'm shining bright as a star my thoughts become electric 
Cause my soul is alive 
It's deeper than life 
Than life 

No time 
For real life 
You're heading 
For deep trouble 
Star tripping 
Red line 
All engines 
At full throttle 
Lost balance 
On such a dream 
Wasted love on your 
Precious money 
Look around 
Time to scream 
You hit the skids 
At the speed of light now 

Fill all of that emptiness with the blood I've shed 
It's the spirit of life 
Don't build your dreams on the treasures of man 
They'll drag you away 
It's a deadly lie 

Sad song why don't they ever listen 
It's the gift of love that helps to keep us alive 
You miss the point again and it's your last horizon 
Can't you see the truth my mind is deeper than life 
I'm a strong man yes I can see the future 
And it's good or bad and nowhere in between 
You can't just spin the wheel you've got to ride on lightning 
Cause your soul is alive 
It's deeper than life 
Than life
