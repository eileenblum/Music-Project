[Music: B. Allman, C. Cadden-James, C. Ingles, G. Wehrkamp Lyrics, Vocal Melodies: C.Cadden-James]

Tonight I stood upon the crest and witnessed our decay 
The land that was our fathers lay in ruins at our feet 
And I dare not look out or into unseeing eyes 
Of mankind's blind ambitions and desires 

The wisdom of humanity is wasted on you all 
You pushed us into corners of a tortured paradise 
Your selfish pillaging is a treason to this earth 
And in the end you are betrayed by your own deeds 

Now every time I turn around it's just too late 
To give back our mother earth a little dignity 
I wish you'd set her free and give her love back to me 
Cause our spirits are not weak like you 

We're on our own 
Pushed from our home 
Our voices joining 

Sacreligious and deceitful are your truces 
Tattered paper poison letters bloody skies 
I do my best to keep it all to myself 
But now I fight for my name
