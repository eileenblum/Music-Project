[Music: B. Allman, C.Ingles, G. Wehrkamp Lyrics, Vocal Melodies: C.Cadden-James]

Remember I painted pictures of you 
And I never found my way out 
I spent a lifetime of dreams in the fields of your eyes 
Lay me down when the rain covers you 
And I'm afraid of the emptiness holding my thoughts 
I see blue I see grey all the while 

And when the night comes again I'll hold my hands to the skies 
I've got a dream of home I've got a dream of home 
And when the winter comes calling turn my face to the wind 
I've got a dream of home I've got a dream 
Of Alaska 

Your name is whispered with the breath of my soul 
In a hope that I'll never let fade 
Between the mist on the waves and the blue of the sky 
I threw a rose to the sea in your name 
Now listen 
Somewhere tonight there are tears on the wind 
Are they yours are they mine I don't know 

I'm crying out to the sky 
I hope you're with me tonight 
I've got a dream of home I've got a dream of home 
And now the earth is left wanting 
Turn my face to the wind 
I've got a dream of home I've got a dream 
Of Alaska 

All through my life I stood tall as the sky 
Hold to the things that I knew were so real 
All I could feel 
Strange how it goes how it comes to an end 
Lord take your hand 
Take you home once again
