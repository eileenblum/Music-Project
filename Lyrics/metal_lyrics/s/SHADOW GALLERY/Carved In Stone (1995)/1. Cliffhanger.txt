[Music: B. Allman, C. Ingles, G. Wehrkamp Lyrics, Vocal Melodies: M. Baker, C.Cadden-James]

I remember there were 
Fights and screaming in the streets that night 
I had to run from the 
Insinuations all about my life 
It didn't matter I was 
Armed and ready I was on the run 
Up in the mountains I've got 
Food and shelter I'm a loaded gun 
Steal away into the hills 
My world is turning 
Secrecy becomes my mask 
My cloak and dagger 

I'm not so sure that I enjoy this journey 
They've got their guns to my head 
I turn myself into the black of darkness 
They chase their shadows instead 

That night my contact 
Took me to the place where the preacher lived 
He gave me serum 
And he blessed my mission helped me get my grip 
Back to the mountains for the 
Codes and weapons and my boarder pass 
10,000 foot the rocks are 
Sheets of ice shards of broken glass 

All alone I cannot rest 
Hear them behind me 
The hunt is on the chase is near 
But I start sliding 

I always thought this was a crystal palace 
Could be my tomb instead 
Three fingers cling to an icy cliff 
Looks like some change ahead
