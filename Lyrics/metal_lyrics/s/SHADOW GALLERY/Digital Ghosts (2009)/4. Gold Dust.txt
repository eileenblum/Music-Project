You and I
Lie awake for hours
Separated by the world
Well I can't see you
You can't see me
But somehow I can feel you
Slip inside my soul

Gold dust in my hands and always in my eyes
I wait in the desert for you
Moonbeams on my waves and always in my skies
I close my eyes as I'm soaring for you
You float you're a dream you take my hand and we run
We run we run
'cause you are the one

[Guitar solo - Brendt]

So lucid alone I crystallize all my thoughts
Resolute I spin my compass as I chart my course
Onward through the haze you know I feel you
I reach out through the black you know I feel you
So torrid the dream this could be so unreal
Who says I can't feel just what I want to feel
You trip through my skies I'm captivated
One look in those eyes I'm captivated

One lone silhouette is frozen dancing in time
Out over the edge out over the line
Who are you?
I'm questioning you
And who am I?
Who am I?
All this so lavishly displayed
(Won't you come over to my side)
Pure essence I can't turn away
(Only if you're in the light - in my life)

Gold dust in my hands and always in my eyes
I wait in the desert for you
Moonbeams on my waves and always in my skies
I close my eyes as I'm soaring for you
You float you're a dream you take my hand and we run
We run we run
Cause you are the one

[Keyboard solo - Vivian]
