Of all the stories that have ever been written
I've been assailed
Right off the page
Winter fell across the floor in silence
I just stopped and wondered why

Well it's a cold and strange sad situation
Off the shore tossed by by the waves
My every other word misunderstood why
I'd ever speak out loud again

Clinging on so tight
I bled my hands
I draw the shades
And hang my head and run

All those simple things
Essential to me
You cast aside
To go and be alone

You can't see the way I grieve
Love's the air I need to breath
I hope you understand
Just need to find myself again
I see no choice but leaving
So tired of flying alone

On the battlefield
You were never there beside me
Who will I be if I recover from this?
I'm not the enemy
There's so much good inside me
The real you left and never came back home

Round and round oh
There is a rhythm where
Two hearts should meet
A sense of comfort and
A point of common ground

To have and then to hold and then to cry
And then to break upon the waves

You see me through dark eyes
That color me wrong
Immersed inside a world
Where charity dies

And what of all that talk of
How two become one and
I hope you understand
Just need to find some grace again
There seems to be no reason
Rejected off and away

On the battlefield
You were never there beside me
Who will I be should I recover from this?
There are no enemies
Just death of love inside me
The bitter truth of this has come back home
