[Guitar Solo - Gary]

Cold night on the mountain top
And it's the dead of the winter and the
Snow and the ice swirlin' all around
But we're not climbing down
From the top of the tower
We are filled with the power of our age

Young and proud
Hard and loud
On the wing
Everything
You know?

There are those that talk the talk
But fail when fire burns them
(They are weak)
What gives you strength
What gives you courage for tomorrow
Is inside
We learned to let experience go turn us into men

Concrete running through our veins
And it's the still of the morning long
Before dawn has broken
Hangin' so listless
Deep in the wilderness
We ride so silent and focused
All the rest of the world
Can fade to grey

In the dark
From the heart
Take the fight
All our might
And on

The boys are tough as nails and
Killer under pressure
(The time has come)
To kill the king cause we are heading for tomorrow
On the run
We gotta let the anger burn until the bitter dawn

I've just never known nobody quite as strong

[Guitar solo - Brendt]

So silent stands the archer
Silent in the rain
You just don't breath
Draw back waiting for the kill shot
Street walking again

And then
We've been goin' all night
Fists pumped in the air
Everybody
Time to sigh no more
Sing hail to the Chief and scream

One for all
All for one

All for one
Rise or Fall
