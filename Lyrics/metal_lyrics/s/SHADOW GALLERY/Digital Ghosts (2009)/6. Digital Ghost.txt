I believe in the afterlife
We walk the ancient pathways of the sky
Through the Heavens hallowed halls
Cross the epochs and the eons carved in time
Our drift through life is mist
A smoke filled mirror gone
Returned to dust
There's a chill in the air tonight
As what once was has passed on through
And gone

Enduring anthems crossing
Time and crossing miles
Charismatic countenance
Upon a distant fading smile
I walked for hours and
I never felt the rain
And through your window
Just your shadow will remain
Only your shadow remains

Ashes to ashes they say
Then dust to dust
And what was unbroken divides
And the the answer to this mortality walking on by
The circle remains here my friend
We guard it with trust
And cast what remains to the sea
In our wailing we will suffer
No last goodbye

The empty days go by
Fending off the slow decline of fall
Raise your head up high
And let the sorrow sing into your soul
Oh I'm never gonna be the same
Echoes of this ghost song fade away

Enduring anthems crossing
Time and crossing miles
Sail on forever sail unto
Your rest from trials
Sing songs of wisdom sing that
Chilling last refrain
And through your window
Just your shadow will remain
Only your shadow remains

You chart
Your life into
A tidy little graph
of where you've been
All you've seen

But then
There suddenly comes a day
You reach the end
but only to
The life you knew
