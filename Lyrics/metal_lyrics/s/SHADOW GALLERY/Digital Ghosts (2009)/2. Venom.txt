It was a cold night
But by the dawn's light
The city streets began to swell and crawl
I emerge then
From the alley
The tempest spirit now in my sight
Well I have seen you
You walk the wire
Oh yes I know you very well
You've got place in the Hamptons
Jet off to London
The threads are Italian
How very expensive

But oh you wear them well
As you serpentine

I am the bringer of the rain
And the foreteller of the pain
The end of days is near at hand
When God returns your just reward
Gets paid in Venom

[Guitar Solo - Brendt]

I will be with the others
When the day breaks
As the earth shakes
I will be with the numbers
When the earth breaks
Open for you

"Oh you kill me well it's quite amusing
I am drawn to your strength yeah you really believe
All the churning and discerning anger hatred and resentment
Bet you've gone catatonic yeah right on over the edge"

[Guitar solo - Brendt]

And the greed of hell
Burns like gasoline

No ransom for your petty soul
I wipe your ashes from your gold
The end of days is near at hand
When all that was becomes a vapor
Slain by Venom

I wrap a curse around your throat
God's wrath reserved through time for you
"How dare you proselytize me
I run the show you fool"
Damnation
"Hell hath no fury"
Completely blind
"I ride the golden rail"
Vengeance
"From where?"
Vengeance
"I wait"
And so you ask and shall receive

Vengeance upon all evil men
Your time has come
All will repent

[Guitar Solo - Brendt]

All the riches all the gold
"Why so bitter mortal man?"
Gain the world loose your soul
"I am lion you are lamb"
Stallions from the sky
Hellfire rain and demons fly
From those of us sent here
To kill your false religion now
All the riches all the gold
"Into the wasteland of my life"
All the riches all the gold
"I lie in waiting here"
Day turn endless night
Burned alive and scream
The end of days you're all alone
When Jesus mighty from his throne
Drowns you in Venom

[Harmony guitar solo - Brendt]
