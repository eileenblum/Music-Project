[Music: G. Wehrkamp, Lyrics and Vocal Melodies: C.Cadden-James, M. Baker]

I am only just a broken spirit 
All the things unseen right before my eyes 
How could I have ever been so blind 
To the truth behindbitter lies? 
I feel so lost and so alone in this room tonight 
Is nothing ever going to change? 
I've lost my will 
I need somebody 
To help me write out the last page 

Where I ride into the sunset 
I race towards the dawn 
I might have been a hero 
A king and not just a pawn 
But that's the way that the story goes you know 
"It's not that way for me" 
And I wake up cold and lonely 
And stare into the screen...
