[Music: C. Ingles, Lyrics and Vocal Melodies: C.Cadden-James]

Outside the twilight rides high 
And whispers of love sound deep in the night 
Hope and promise of peace in our land 
Is this Christmastime? 

Dark winter watches our fire 
And brings us promise of a new day 
Distant eyes have gone a long way 

Too far to see the snow that falls 
The winds of change have come and gone 
The cold has come I've been left out 
I need your warmth you're all I have 

If you're chasing a dream to nowhere 
It's enchantment that leads the way 
Just believe in yourself and go there 
The gift of hope on Christmas day 
If every eye holds a blank stare 
After winter's gone away 
Just believe in yourself and go there 
You and I on Christmas day 

There's a time when your doubts won't matter 
There's a time all your fears can wait 
All the times in the year for laughter 
Oh Christmas day
