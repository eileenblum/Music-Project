[Music: C.Cadden-James, C.Ingles, W.B.Allman Lyrics, Vocal Melodies: C.Cadden-James]

All alone and standing in the rain 
early mornings whispering my name 
seems so distant and cannot reach me now 
flying high above you 
I bring to you this word 
for your love, for your life, for your song 
Look around and see them fall to pray 
troubled waters carry you away 
and your memories say goodbye 

We're not alone not alone looking down seeing all of us 
screaming out in anger when they come, when they come 

all along this empty lonely road____ Oh they have seen 
you cried a thousand times____ what's to be 
you wept to us ____what's a part of us 
stalking out the winter's bitter cold 

all alone, do you want me____for the fire 
to be near you____in the night 
as you wonder you must never____we are lost 
walk alone____without light 

You believe that time passes us by 
fate alone will blow it all sky high 
I've been torn into a world you don't believe 
and I've seen souls that I once knew chained in burning steel 
and I do not think they'll ever sing again 
realize you're running out of time 
my hand of fate is reaching out tonight 
but I'll be going soon, going on my way 
I know you want to some along with me 
hand in hand we'll walk and never turn the road is open all the way 
Say goodbye to the morning 
say goodbye to the morning 
say goodbye to the morning 

Sy goodbye to the morning or rely on this warning 
It's not over when you die so look out
