[Music: W.B.Allman Lyrics, Vocal Melodies: C.Cadden-James, W.B.Allman]

Asked if I had ever known your name 
I replied it sometimes slips away 
Answers now like sand shall fill my hands 
slipping through my fingers to the floor 
and blown away 

Somewhere out beyond our reach 
lie the answers to the questions at hand 

Time survives and all that's left is dust 
We respond to music of the earth 
Our hands touch and to its tune we dance 
Is our kiss just sand thrown to the wind 
Where does it go! 

Somewhere out beyond our reach 
lie the answers to the questions at hand 

I, I could never find solace in another eye 
and then you came into my life 
Oh I, I've come out from the cold alone I walk a broken road 
Through wind I heard you calling 
Now my eyes can cut a path into your light
