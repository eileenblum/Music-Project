[Music: C.Ingles, W.B.Allman Lyrics, Vocal Melodies: C.Cadden-James]

I was calling just to say I loved you 
I know you're out there tonight 
Long time ago I held you tight 
My heart knows of a broken promise 
I know of fortune that came and went 
too far with my emotion 
Who could ignore the cold 

Every time you missed the love I sent I 
scanned the windows won't forget I 
curse the moment I felt you turn to stone 
wakin' up to the sound to the sound of a broken heart 
Ifound out it was time to say goodbye 

Now I'm standing here mystified 
Woman you hurt me 
You traded my love alive 
Never understanding why 
feel the hard cold steel of pain 
It cuts me don't you know 
Leave me mystified once again 
Mystified you made me go 

All I wanted was a chance to say I think of you 
she won't see me and she sure won't speak my name 
she's all lost in a world so condescending 
that's a price I cannot afford to pay 

I was calling just to say I loved you 
but I don't know if you're out there tonight 
This scene slowly fading out of sight 
no longer crying my tears of cold remorse 
that distant place in my heart still hurts of course 
I do believe I will turn and say goodnight 

Now I'm standing here mystified 
Woman you hurt me 
You traded my love alive 
Never understanding why 
feel the hard cold steel of pain 
It scars me don't you know 
Leave me mystified once again 
Mystified you made me go
