[Music: C.Ingles, W.B.Allman Lyrics, Vocal Melodies: C.Cadden-James]

Sometimes I've got a world on my shoulders 
that cast long shadows cross my eyes 
where traced out footsteps on the shores 
of the sea of sorrow 
reflect the changes in my life 

Holding out in a darkened room 
long before the fall of rain shall come 
listen to me 
for the last time that I was tempted to the dance of fools 
closer to me 
I crawled away a loser 

I never knew it meant so much to hold a place of power 
where only dreaming sets you free 
I never thought that you could hold me so completely 
you tore off my mask and I could see 

All the people in the street 
double crossed by their own lives 
bring them to me 
I want to take them to a new tomorrow of yesteryear 
call them to me 
let us live forever on 

Tonight I shall cast a stone into the sea of sorrow 
Its waves they crash beneath my feet 
sorrow binds you to a life not worth living 
unto that mortal life you cling 

Stripped of all your earthly pride with the fools you dance 
tonight 
come unto me 
send with great speed this message all across the land 
listen to me 
let us live forever on 

Listen to me 
tonight I turn my face 
from the dance of fools 
closer to me 
I live to carry on my way
