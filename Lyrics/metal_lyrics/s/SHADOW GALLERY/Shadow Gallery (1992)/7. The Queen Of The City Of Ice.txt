[Chapter 1:]
Long ago the skies turned gray 
the fallen sun had gone away and left us cold 
until one thousand years would pass and we'd sail away 
Trapped within such misery 
we'd seen a light we'd never seen all crowned with gold 
through morning mist with tears of ice see her coming down 
All upon our knees 
Falling with the rain, with the rain 
a queen has come before us 
Falling with the rain, with the rain 
I was alone, see how she took us all 
By her side we'll stay 
Shadows of love, blacken dawn, fill the empty skies with 
Powerful her throne, oh my queen, upon this silent maze of ice 
Oh how I love her so, yah I can't let go, she is all I need 
In the ice I'll stay 'till my dying day 

[Chapter 2:]
I have come here for so long I never have known why 
only to have been shown away 
There I saw you standing in the light for so long 
knew you had something more to say 
All my night times are full of dreams of you and I 
and falling rain 
Oh I know you so well 

[Chorus:]
You are my queen of the city of ice 
a frozen love has never left her eyes 
Long live my queen of the city of ice 
and alone her frozen love was carved in stone 

[Chapter 3:]
I had a dream 
something I believe in 
Always knew the 
day would come 
and they would come 
and they would go 
and they would melt 
away our home 
and in my dreams 
their fires burned 
they tear my heart I 
listen to the wind 
listen to the wind 
listen to the sad song 
she is singing now 
listen to the falling of the night 
and see what she knows 
it's written in her eyes 
Lately I've had feelings 
that are so hard to describe 
like armies marching 
from the South 
and all the while she's blind 
she's falling 

[Chapter 4:]
So it came to pass that 
no more rain 
would fall to them 
They come to 
bring us to our knees 
With mighty fires they built 
around these city's castle walls 
Our city melts into a sea 
So we run into the hills and 
far away to cry in vain 
Oh no no my queen 

[Chorus:]
You are my queen of the city of ice 
the bringer of my life is fading fast 
Goodbye my queen of the city of ice 
and alone she slowly sinks into the sea 

[Chapter 5: THE CITY MELTS (instrumental)]

Here I stand I'mall alone now, cursed by fate 
I've burned my wings and I can't fly 
all around a sea of ice, oh, could it be she waits for me 
but I'm never going to find out am I? 

So long, farewell, we are leaving 
On our way now, new beginning 

so long_____falling with the rain 
_____falling with the rain 
farewell_____falling with the rain 
_____falling with the rain 
we are leaving_____torn in the wind 
_____with a shake and a spin 
_____and I don't ever think I will 
_____come here again 
on our_____there's a hole in my life 
_____carved it with ice 
way now_____cause fate was a dealer 
_____that didn't think twice 
new beginning_____I'm so lost on my own 
_____a statue of stone 
_____carving your name 
_____cause I'm falling I'm falling 
_____I'm falling I'm falling
