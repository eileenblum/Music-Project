[Music: C.Cadden-James Lyrics, Vocal Melodies: C.Cadden-James]

Nightime falls around me 
darkness closes in all the people who are 
sleeping safe and soundly 
content knowing we keep watch throught 
each and every hour 
power so unknown 
won't stop the rain falling down my face 

Sleep for hours eludes me drifting throught the wind 
I feel an evil eye on me all the time 
the likes of which could turn and twist us all 

Lying by my side she waits for me like long ago 
I touch her face she cries to me my ship is waiting I must go 

My eyes burn windows through the walls closing in on me 
The faces of my past life are looking back at me what do they see 
the ones who hate our love will fall 
but their face won't fade away tomorrow's not just another day 
so hand in hand we climb the stairs our path well lit 
the promise is fulfilled
