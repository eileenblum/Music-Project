Out of the blue 
Everything seemed so new 
The sun rising lights up my face 
Fading from green 
No more thoughts to deceive 
For seasons of lost hope may change 
Ahh - so many different colors 
Ahh - The colors are changing 
Moments in time 
When the words didn't rhyme 
Unsure what the future would hold 
As days turned to nights 
I chased rainbows of light 
Finding no gold 
No magical fountain of gold 
Ahh - So many different colros 
Ahh - The colors keep changing 
So many different ways to look at things 
I turn around I'/m upside down again 
If nothing ever changes it's my point of view 
That I can't lose 
The skies fiery red 
I will journey ahead 
To show you how far I have flown 
New day in my life 
Flashing hope by design 
I've finally found my way home 
Ahh - So many different colors 
Ahh - Now my world is slowly changing 
So many different ways to look at things 
If you've fallen down you gotta get back up again 
So many different shades of everything 
Now I see with open eyes a brighter world within 
The skies forever changing that's the point of view 
I just can't lose 
This new born wisdom guides me through 
Feel the cool winds of heaven 
In the blue of your eyes 
Dreams of you and I together 
A love we cannot deny 
Feel the tide of the ocean 
On and on 'till I see your light 
And the warmth of the sky 
On and on 
Passion breathes wtih emotion 
We will soar 
We will soar with wings on high 
On high 
On high... 
So many different ways to look at things 
If we've fallen down we gotta get back up again 
So many different ways the colors change 
Every time I turn around we're hanging on the edge 
Our skies forever changing that's the point of view 
I give to you 
I know that time will see us through 
I hope the colors soon find you
