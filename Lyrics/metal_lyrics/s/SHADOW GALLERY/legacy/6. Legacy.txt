[Lyrics, Vocal Melodies: Carl Cadden-James]

Future's here 
The time has come to pass the torch 
Now go and touch the sky every time that you breathe 
I hope you've learned 
To covet not the evil ways 
Live your life 
Free free 
From carnal lust 
Hedonistic decadence and lies 
Are you strong? 
Turn from heathen ways? 
Will you ride? 
Ride with me the open road 
Part of me is now part of you 
My legacy is how I live on 
The circle formed 
We are joined across space and time 
Many days will pass you by 
And you'll still hear these words to you 
Many things to realize 
The hope I give sustaining you 
Wear the armor of righteousness each day 
Then forever in glory we'll remain 
Will you bend? 
When the hammer falls? 
Are you steel? 
Inquisitions search you out 
Part of me is now part of you 
My legacy is how I live on 
The circle formed 
We are joined across space and time 
Part of you is now part of me 
Our legacy it's how we live on 
Relational bonds 
Not just wayfaring souls set to fly 
Away
