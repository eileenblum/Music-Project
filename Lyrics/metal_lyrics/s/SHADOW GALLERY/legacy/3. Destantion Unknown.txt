Picture home years ago and tell me it's you 
Of all the roads a man could take 
How mine has lead form you 
And like a lighthouse 
Set on a rocky coast amidst the storm 
Your touch was warm and real 
Looking out your window 
Just what might lie ahead 
Dreams still blow in the wind 
And here we are memories run deeper and true 
I'll always take you with me when I 
Freefall Freefall 
And the whole world goes to sleep 
As a child the grand expanse the future must hold 
Days to night waves washing over and over 
And over your experience you 
Lived each day like it's your last 
Oh we never know how it goes 
Oh we never know 
And I won't leave you don't leave me but then again 
Just who can stop falling over fall into the 
Mystery predestination brings 
YOu wrote your epitaph 
With every move 
Thru your love 
Thru your love
