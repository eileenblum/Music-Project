From the first gray light of the morning I've been gone 
On my journey towards the stars 
Will I know when I reach the other side 
The earth so blue it's like I'm dreaming 
Now I'm on my way 
Tainted shadows fall like rain 
Through the dark vast weight only silence lingers on 
The origin of existence lies somewhere far far beyond 
I feel unattached tranquility 
A hand from the heavens guiding me 
And wondering where this path will lead 
In a dream I'm lost and 
Floating through the atmosphere 
Searchig for significance against 
Infinity eternity 
I've been taken by the vast and 
Humbled by the weight of what I've seen 
You know they called for heros 
Cause heros carry on 
In know the world is fading 
So from the first gray light of the morning I've been gone 
Now I pray for a better life 
For all the ones I love 
We search beyond our reach 
And turn our gaze above 
I hope that it's the way 
To fill our basic needs 
And my sacrifice not vain 
And I'll return again 
The sands will filter through the timeless hourglass 
As I pass beyond the god of war 
Distant voices hear them crying out 
I must seek out new worlds and explore 
And I know that there just must be a place 
We will carry on 
Where our children can be free from the pain 
The human race 
It must be somewhere out in space 
The sands will filter through the timeless hourglass 
As I pass beyond the god of war 
Distant voices hear them crying out 
I must seek out new worlds and explore 
And I know that there must be a place 
It Must be somewhere out in space 
Silver moonbeams relfect the sun 
Martian Landscapes worlds beyond 
I touch down with no trace 
No sign of life on this place 
Now I feel a surge of energy 
The deepest passion burns in me 
Somwhere there is a world not left 
To die 
The stars will shine their light down unto me 
Illuminating 
The stars will shine their light and I will see 
Will I find my way? 
So back to the darkness I fly 
In search of a hope in the sky 
I should have known right from the start 
I'll not return home 
It seems so surreal as I go 
The knowlesdge of science alone 
Can't save all the people I know 
That I've left behind 
The sun I know is growing smaller 
I drift for days on endless hours 
And what's there to fear now! 
No messages are getting through 
I fall into the black abyss of night 
I'm gone 
The pioneering spirit charges the unkown 
Accept the consequence of risk 
I'm all alone here 
Don't know if I'll return and 
The fate of life is on my heart 
I left a dying world behind 
On my way oh 
Where s our oasis in the sky 
The future of our race 
I left a poisoned world behind 
Now I see there's no 
Heaven bound oasis in the sky 
Only dreams 
I've got no destination 
Helpless I drift on 
The weight of silence how it's eating at my soul 
And yet I sense a stirring 
Something so spiritual 
I wonder if the fate of mankind 
Is in the hands of a higher power calling to us all 
I left a dying world behind 
On my way only 
God can stop the spiral down to hell 
The future of our race 
I left a poisoned world behind 
Now I see only 
Heaven's the oasis in the sky 
It's my dream
