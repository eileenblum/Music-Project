Broken window broken dreams, nothing but a trail of tears
Oh my God my little lady, where have they taken you - I never heard you scream

Strange how pain etches patterns on your heart
Just like frost grows on the window pain
And cold's no elixir, the fractals well veiled
My eyes gone black, they've pierced my hands and side

I've searched high and I've searched low, damn the motive I don't know
Another child torn from her father, where have they taken you - I'm praying for your soul

Show your face, tell me why it must be her
You faceless evil shake me to my core
And what do you do? With faith and belief
When tragedy buries me, buries me, buries me alive

Hold your hands up high, lift them toward the sky
When all I have - Is torn
Down down down, meet my pain tonight

Something wicked this way came, just ghosts and demons from my past
Are they trying to draw me out, vendictivly I'm recompensed - No shadow of a doubt

Hold your hands up high, lift them toward the sky
When all I have - Is torn
Down down down, meet my pain tonight

Somewhere out there lies a girl, stolen by a broken world
Can't escape my frozen past, shattered like a rock through glass
I'm Torn
