[Mike]
So I set out early morning
Through the forests deep and wide
I am vested and determined
To bring her back alive
As I knife my way through dense fog
In the silence of the field
Stands a soldier like a statue
With a cross bow strained at me

[Archer]
Don't move from my crosshairs I bring news from home
The deadly pox is in the wrong hands
But this I'm sure you know
Your wife's blood filled with secrets
Hand sequenced DNA
Attempts to recreate the serum
Have failed until today

[Mike]
My wife dead and buried and my daughter dragged away

[Archer]
Do you not find coincidental
That your two rare blood types are the same?
Intelligence from Israel found her here
Heavy with the blood pure child
They shot your wife with pox tipped blow dart, got that human trial underway

[Archer]
Your daughter carries plasma, essential to vaccine
Development required the sample
Her blood now holds the key, a grand scheme of deception for one world government
But rouge Mossad stole blood at her birth
So now we too hold the key

[Mike]
Outbreak around the world
Sets the stage the main event

[Archer]
Contingent on the bio terror
New World Order rises and it stays
A lone detachment of US Special Forces sends me here to set it right
You'll aid the underground rebellion, your country needs you for counterstrike
