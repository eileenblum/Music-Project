I look into your blue eyes deep pools I had no idea
I know hunted down from coast to coast
Circumstance prevailed it was hard on us both.
I've run hard, I'm so tired from the chase
So desperately I'm aching
The waning of the starlight
Embers turn to ash as I fade.

And now you're next to me
I beg you baby please don't go
End of the road for me
I'll just hold you close
Just hold you close
End of the mystery a gift from heaven on this day
Your touch to comfort me
Just comfort me

Your sheltering soul not a moment too soon
You're a sweet tourniquet
For my soul lies rife with open wounds
And yes I thought as I closed my eyes
I saw phantom apparitions dance
And are we really safe on our own
Or are they out there watching
Right now I don't want to care at all
Just like a silent song
Just reach out your hands and take hold
Take hold
When the limit of your pain
Exceeds the mercies of your love
It's time to cease and release and just fly

And now you've come to me
A sanctuary borne of love
Honest sincerity I'll just hold you close
Just hold you close
It's in the way you move
A phoenix risen on this day
Your touch to comfort me
Just comfort me

I disrobe my burdens and I lay them at your feet
So much about this world I'd just as soon they keep
Their faces melt reflections on the wind
Or are they out there watching
As time stands still this Christmas Day
