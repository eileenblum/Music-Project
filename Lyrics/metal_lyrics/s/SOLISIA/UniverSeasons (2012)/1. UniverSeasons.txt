Along the border of blind rage
Hatred breeds violence and shatters life
What we are seeking is a new chance
Now people need a miracle

The curse of darkness is above us
And every human being is waiting for light
The scream of silence, so deafening
Now people need a miracle

UniverSeasons have begun
Washing liar's hands
We can try to become innocence
Lost in the universe out of bounds
Hold each other's hands
We're searching for an inner strength

Who is the hunter
Who is the prey?
We make the same mistake again
No past no future
Only for today
We can be our miracle

We can try to become innocence (try to become innocence)
Lost in the universe out of bounds (lost in the universe)
(Out of bounds)
Hold each other's hands (hold each otherâs hands)
We're searching for an inner strength (inner strength)
