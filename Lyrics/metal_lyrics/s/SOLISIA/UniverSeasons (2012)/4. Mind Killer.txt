Do you think about me?
In your world of contradictions
I met the silence of the dark
âCause you have shown it to me

Thereâs a little voice inside of
Me that says hello!
Wake up thatâs no good for your existence you must go on!

You are too tired
Doesnât really matter
Everything you want my friend can
Change but you must go on!

Empty promises for wasted time
Through the madness of a slow suicide

Too late
My angerâs screaming
Into your eyes
Recalling my dreams
Too late
âCause every time you killed my pride
I was a victim
You want to kill me twice

Do you think about my pain?
In your frozen revelations
Words like arrows pierce my heart
What have you done to me?

Empty promises for wasted time
Through the anguish of a slow suicide

Too late
My angerâs screaming
Into your eyes
Recalling my dreams
Too late
âCause every time you killed my pride
I was a victim
You want to kill me twice

Here I am
You call out my name
But you donât understand
That itâs really too late

Too late
My angerâs screaming
Into your eyes
Recalling my dreams
Too late
âCause every time you killed my pride
I was a victim
You want to kill me twice

Too late
My angerâs screaming
Into your eyes
Recalling my dreams
Itâs too late
Freedom smiles and sorrow cries
