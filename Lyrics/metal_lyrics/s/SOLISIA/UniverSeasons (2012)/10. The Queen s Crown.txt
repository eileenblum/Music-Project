On the throne
In my kingdom
Thereâs an empty place
A candleâs blown out

âCause the words that I need to say
Took another path and walked away

Can a feather thatâs light turn into wax?
In this labyrinth of thoughts
Forever changed

I donât know what I have done
To bring myself so down
The crown is falling down
I feel lonely in a crowd
And in my hands only rain and mud
Pure prayers and my blood
You canât hurt me this time

When you live with your own enemy
The shadows of the night embrace your soul
I never took the time to say f**k you!
Forever changed

I donât know what I have done
To bring myself so down
The crown is falling down
I feel lonely in a crowd
And in my hands only rain and mud
Pure prayers and my blood
You canât hurt me this time

I canât breathe
What can I do?
I canât breathe
What can I do to escape from myself?

I feel lonely in a crowd
And in my hands only rain and mud
Pure prayers and my blood

I donât know what I have done
To bring myself so down
The crown is falling down
But I take it from the ground
My hands are bleeding but without blood
Every challenge from now on
Will be a pearl on my crown
