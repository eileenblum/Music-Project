Oceanâ¦ Take all my feelings!
My thoughts are sailing away
Drifting to a place to rest
Waiting for those sacred hands

Oceanâ¦ Take all my feelings!
Unthronedâ¦

I know
Things look much brighter in the morning
What can I do
If the sun is black today?
Wish for a light
Let me be
Let me free

Enlighten my way Iâve been betrayed by faith
With a beautiful lie
No one can understand me
I am calling you

Heed my words
Donât you hear me?
Let me be
(Heed my words)
Let me free

There is a price to pay for every choice you make
I paid my dues, tell me
How long is this going to take

Enlighten my way Iâve been betrayed by faith
With a beautiful lie
No one can understand me
I am calling you

Let me hope
Let me know
Rise above the confusion and then
The stolen promise is coming back to me
Or itâs another illusion of my mind
