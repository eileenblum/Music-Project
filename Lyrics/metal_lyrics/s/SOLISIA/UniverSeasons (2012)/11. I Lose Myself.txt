In the desert of my heart
Something inside (of me) has died
And I canât hide

I want to leave it all behind
But I feel so sad for believing again
Help me
I donât know, where are my lonely dreams?
So help me
Find me now

I lose myself
Into the dark
Iâm crying for my soul

I lose myself
Into this night
And Iâm praying for my return

In the desert of my eyes
Every step I take is to survive
Donât be afraid
What I destroyed
Iâll build again
Before itâs too late

Help me
I donât know, where is my only truth?
So help me
Find me now

I lose myself
Into the dark
Iâm praying for my soul

I lose myself
Into this night
And Iâm praying for my return

Ohâ¦ But time doesnât wait for me
In the rain I walk alone
In the silence Iâm screaming
And I wish to see the stars
Againâ¦

I lose myself
Into the dark
Iâm praying for my soul

I lose myself
Into this night
And Iâm praying for my return

In the desert of my heart
Something inside (of me) has died
And I canât hide
