Looking out my window
I can see the weary minds
Of women and men
That dream of fame and glory
Hung in the balance by a common thread
I wonât play this game
Itâs burying us in the name of the shame

All I want is hold the world together
Itâs time to wear the real face
Simply calling back the human race
All I want is hold the world together
No surrender, aiming high
We are strong weâll never die

Ohâ¦ Living easy in the fast lane
To arrive in the eye of the hurricane
(I donât want to live and play in this game)

Passing by different horizons
That take you away
(I donât want to live and play in this game)

And I donât want to hear another word
We are losing this game
Itâs burying us in the name of the shame

All I want is hold the world together
Itâs time to wear the real face
Simply calling back the human race

All I want is hold the world together
Itâs time to wear the real face
No surrender, aiming high
We are strong weâll never die
Weâll never die

All I want is hold the world together

All I want is hold the world together
Itâs time to wear the real face
Simply calling back the human race

All I want is hold the world together
No surrender, aiming high
We are strong weâll never die
