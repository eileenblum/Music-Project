Breathing is hard tonight
Maybe it will be our last goodbye
Or maybe youâll decide to fly
With me to paradise

Tongues of flames embrace my wings
I have your name on my skin
A dangerous strange affair
The doom of crime for which weâre born

This dirty feeling will bring us together forever
Follow me anyway
Stand in a secret
And suffer in pleasure as ever
Pull them under

This night is going to die
Is coming to the end of the line

Rays of light embrace my soul
Iâve got the key of the burning door
To escape from the underworld
And leave the crime for which weâre born

This dirty feeling will bring us together forever
Follow me anyway
Stand in a secret
And suffer in pleasure as ever
They wonât understand

The winds of faith
Are guiding us
Through the storm of
Passion in a dream of love
Merciful sin
One step above

This dirty feeling will bring us together forever
Follow me anyway
Stand in a secret
And suffer in pleasure as ever
They wonât understand (They wonât understand)

They will understand
