She comes from another star
And I donât know her name
A little sweet child

She looks at me, can read my mind
I feel just what she feels inside
Just like a flight of butterflies
Time disappears

Paintings on the wall
Tell me something more

Here we are
What is the answer that I want today
Where is the peace that I lost yesterday?
While we are dancing in a circle
She tells me the words that Iâve never said

Suddenly the little child is sad
Sheâs sitting down on the stairs of pain
And all is shrouded in silence
There is something in her eyes
Poor angel in disguise
On my face tears stream down
But I donât know why

Paintings on the wall
Tell me something more

Here we are
Where is the peace that I lost yesterday? (here we are)
While we are dancing in a circle
She tells me the words that Iâve never said

No, donât you be afraid
Iâll stay with you, youâll never go away
Forever dancing, here with me
In the circle of our lives

(Here we are) I have the answer, the look of today
(Here we are) Finding the peace that I lost yesterday
And while we are dancing in a circle
She becomes a mirror where I see myself
I canât get her out of my way
âCause sheâs part of me
More than words can say
