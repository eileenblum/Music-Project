Only this time
Try to hear the winding words
Hidden behind a curtain of mystery

You never know until you try
Heaven is watching over you
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing and no one else will do
The war inside you

Believe in what you feel
Believe you can be free
I will trust in you
The worst is over
From this day on
From dusk till dawn

Believe in what you feel
Believe you have the key
I will trust in you
âCause life belong to us

In your arms
For your eyes
There are no alibis
Fight all your demons, temptations

Donât let the soul go away
Remember where you left your dignity
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing
And no one else will do
The war inside you

Believe in what you feel
Believe you can be free
I will trust in you
The worst is over
From this day on
From dusk till dawn

Believe in what you feel
Believe you have the key
I will trust in you
âCause life belong to us

The night is running
I want to see a new world
Through your eyes
Follow me and you will try
Another way to fly

Believe in what you feel
Believe you can be free
I will trust in you
The worst is over
From this day on
From dusk till dawn

Believe youâre going to win
Believe youâre going to kill
The unspoken words
Believing
Believing
Believing
