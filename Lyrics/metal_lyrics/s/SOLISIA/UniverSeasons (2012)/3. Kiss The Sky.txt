Iâm watching the earth from the moon
Through silver gloomy wheels
Of memories
I canât forget

Sunrise flowers I regret
A gentle breeze blew through my hair
Itâs fallen down in such a little while
Iâll stay here âtill the end of time

I kiss the sky to hear
Sounds of eternity
I kiss the sky to feel
The right way to live

Some whispers with no face
Fly around me
Their silent cry is without tears
For something
That will never come back

Mountains, Rivers
What pain!
The shining rainbow crossed the rain
Itâs fallen down in such a little while
Iâll stay here âtill the end of time

I kiss the sky to hear
Sounds of eternity
I kiss the sky to feel
The right way to live

I have my world no more
Everythingâs fallen down in such a little while
Iâll stay here âtill the end of time

I kiss the sky to hear
Sounds of eternity
I kiss the sky to feel
The right way to live

Give me a reason to live
I need to know what
Is the right way to start my life again
The right way to live
