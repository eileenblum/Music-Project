When the pure light disappears
The wisdom reflects in itself
(As) ancient as the human greed
To reach a powerful score

They wanna catch every falling star
And drag âem all by their side
The dark side of desire
Fans the flames of the fire
With illogical actions
They will make your mind unsafe
Theyâre killing
And tearing
And stealing
Your soul

Why are you still here?
Looks can be deceiving when
The guns fall silent
Itâs not the same as before

They want to catch every single breath
The rhythm of life and death
Itâs a constant desire
In their eyes full of fire
With a fatal attraction
They will make your mind insane
Theyâre killing
And tearing
And stealing
Your dreams

Leave a sign
Tell me how can you be so blind?
Believe and
Free your mind
Break the foolish chains that bind
What are you waiting for?
