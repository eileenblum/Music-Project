With eyes of grace I watch my life
A pale painted world of lies
Shapes move besides you
Bleeding feelings each other souls

What can I read behind these lines?
Only lies you told in your life
What can I read behind these lines?
The lies write down by human minds

Right now you can
Free the memories without fear
Right now you try to
Feel free from your lies
Right now you can
Stop this fictions without tears
Right now you can smile at your life

When the mouth of innocence speaks to me
I can feel these words of shame
And I want to stop these fictions
I want to break free from my lies

What can I read behind these lines?
Only lies you told in your life
What can I read behind these lines?
The lies write down by human minds

Right now you can
Free the memories without fear
Right now you try to
Feel free from your lies
Right now you can
Stop this fictions without tears
Right now you can smile at your life

With all our sacrifices
And all our good faith
We can fly away
With all our sacrifices
And all our good faith
We are flying away

Right now you can
Free the memories without fear
Right now you try to
Feel free from your lies
Right now you can
Stop this fictions without tears
Right now you can smile at your life
