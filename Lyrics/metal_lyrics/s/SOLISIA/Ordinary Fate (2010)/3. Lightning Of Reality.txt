Pervaded by insanity
My only refuge is the sky
There's no way to shake off
Shake off these black clouds

Strong obsessions, fighting temptations
Changing our ways in opposite directions

And I want out of this sky
Take me away from all the lies
Save me from reality
And I want out of this time
Take me away from all the pains
Save me from reality

Tired by suffering
My only hopes are falling down
Living in a terrible world
Wanted by our greatest god

And I want out of this sky
Take me away from all the lies
Save me from reality
And I want out of this time
Take me away from all the pains
Save me from reality
