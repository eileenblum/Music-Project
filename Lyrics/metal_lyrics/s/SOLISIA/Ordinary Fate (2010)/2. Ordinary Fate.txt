We're moving spirits of our own life
We are like water that dry up our minds
Winners or losers in our destiny
Living day by day to change our future

Masters of our thoughts is what we expect
Fighting a battle that will never end
Time is now running for the human being
Visions of unknown is what we believe in

Dream a world of shining hopes
The key of life
Ordinary fate
Breathing freedom once again
Ordinary fate
Wake up by beating rhythm of your heart
Ordinary fate
Keep on moving on your way
Ordinary fate
