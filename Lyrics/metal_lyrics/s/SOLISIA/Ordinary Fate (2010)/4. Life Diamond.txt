I have seen the eyes of a child
Innocent and shining
A precious diamond but not hard enough
In his eyes full of life I have seen the death

A child
The symbol of life
The most precious thing
His innocence trusted in life
A hard game to play
That breaks all his hopes
And all he believes in

They've stolen your smiles and dreams
Desire to play and to laugh
You look at the world, learn from the past
Try to be a man

In your childhood it was only a game
Strange and weird
It took away the light from your face
A game you've overpaid

A child

They've stolen your smiles and dreams
Desire to play and to laugh
You look at the world, learn from the past
Try to be a man

You look at yourself through different eyes
Scared from your past, facing reality
You look at the world trying to be a man
