While a tear slowly comes down on my face
My thought is turned to you
To you who enjoyed seeing me grow
To you who filled up my empty days

Wherever I'll go I'll take you with me
Inside my heart, rays of life spent together
Wherever I'll go I'll take you with me
How I wish I could turn back and live this life together

Forever and ever

In your life you worked without having peace
You suffered carrying your cross
They punished you, humiliated you
They trampled on your dignity
Your pain now ended, you are in heaven

Wherever I'll go I'll take you with me
Inside my heart, rays of life spent together
Wherever I'll go I'll take you with me
How I wish I could turn back and live this life together

You always live within me
Until I'll live
You always live within me
Until I'll live

Wherever I'll go I'll take you with me
Inside my heart, rays of life spent together
Wherever I'll go I'll take you with me
How I wish I could turn back and live this life together
