Fly on the wings of war
A war born inside yourself
Born from the need
Of something you don't really know
How to live your best
How to make a better world
Just noticing you're falling down forever

Never regret what you used to be
Behaviour you should have to rise up your soul
Journey will bring you so far away
Behind gates of time you'll discover the truth

We are always looking for
Something that it's hard to reach
Breaking all the rules that mankind use to guide the world
Turn the page of lies
Change the chapter of your will
Write down your new ambitions

Never regret what you used to be
Behaviour you should have to rise up your soul
Journey will bring you so far away
Behind gates of time you'll discover the truth
