Hello my dear friend
You're talking to me from so much time
You're the source of all my pains
And the cause of my sickness

You're trying to understand my movements
To reveal my darkest secret
I'm not sure you'll be able
I don't see any chance for you
Despise yourself

You're trying to read into my mind
To reach the meaning of my life
A fortress made of love and hate
Now you listen to unrevealed words
Break your heart and break your soul
You taste the sorrows that I feel
