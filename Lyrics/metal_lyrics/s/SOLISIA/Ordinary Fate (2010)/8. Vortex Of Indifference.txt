There will be no answers
Screaming questions at the sky
Time is running
No one will realise your pain

Throw your soul, torn from pain
Knowledge will enlighten you
Don't waste your time
Let's open up your eyes

The world is a vortex of indifference
Where anyone is left to himself
The world is a vortex of indifference
Where anyone is left to his destiny

It's hard to live, rise your sight
Just preserve your own identity
Turn the page, walk your way
Reaching for freedom

Living
You need to taste your hopes
You need to believe in future
To realize your dreams

The world is a vortex of indifference
Where anyone is left to himself
The world is a vortex of indifference
Where anyone is left to his destiny
