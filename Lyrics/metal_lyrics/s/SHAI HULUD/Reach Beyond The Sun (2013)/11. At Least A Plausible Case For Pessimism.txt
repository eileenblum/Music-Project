The pauses taken to reach a deeper comprehension
Lead to further fear and apprehension overall.
In seeking a moment of clarity,
She found herself misdirected,
Musing..

Why think at all
Endure the aches of actuality
As the outside world embracing apathy is blessed with oblivion?

Heart and mind at odds again,
Always and forever.
Betrayed by introspection, eternally
The searching of the soul is a scythe to the essence of oneself..
A tender core soÂ selflesslyÂ reaped.
Heart and mind wounded again,
Troubled deeply

And does she gain in the throes of lucidity?
She, too, could know the comforts of oblivion.

Heart and mind at odds again, always and forever.

She, too, could know the comforts of a blessed life,
Blind to truths, rejecting the depth and need of human understanding.

She takes no pause to reach a deeper comprehension,
The heavy toll of fear effected a depletion of faith.
Reveling in this moment of clarity,
She found herself liberated.Â 

Why feel at all?
To endure the aches of actuality.
The outside world embracing apathy is not blessed.
ButÂ condemnedÂ toÂ absurdity.

Rather die alone than in oblivion.Â
