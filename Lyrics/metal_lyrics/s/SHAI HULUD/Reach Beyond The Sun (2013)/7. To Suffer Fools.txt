To suffer fools is to exist:
Bounded by those who deem themselves wise.
Never veil your eyes, turn deaf, or disconnect your mind.
Clash, and clash hard.

We suffer fools

From the flat Earth drifting away into warm delusion...
See it fit to have them forced back down.
Slammed into the clay.
Fathoms deep.

The fool always claims to know.
Steeped in misbelief ,
Fool, never claim to know.
Your ideas are wrong.

Pour the salts of acumen straight into the eyes to recondition the mind.

We suffer.
