Hold fast; an entire world means to bring you down.
Reveal your heart to the heartless...
They will bring you down.

He who stands to reason will stand alone and he will surely fall.
Disregard your regard for humanity.
Be wise to prepare to fall.

Monumental hearts mean little more than monumental graves.

Creation shuns that which brings temper to spite;
Hope and its bearers steadily die.

Flesh may be pierced to bleed, readily brought to death.
True strength is inviolate
A brandished weapon fearedÂ solelyÂ by the breakable.
Built on backbone and reason,
The monumental heart is steadfast,
Even in death.

Your very nature will be used to bring you down.
Brace yourself for the onslaught.Â
