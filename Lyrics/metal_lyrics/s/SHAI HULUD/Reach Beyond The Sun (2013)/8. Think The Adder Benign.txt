I will walk with you, my friend, in the search for insight...

Let truth be told,
If not malicious, the nature ofÂ humanityÂ is volatile,
Often thoughtlessly brought to irrational ends.
And I have mused on the future that may effect...
Dark times designed of dark minds.

Now please walk with me, my friend,
this is what i believe and know to be true..

I believe and know fear runs deeper than reason,
That rampant weakness is veiled by aggression.

I believe and knowÂ defeatÂ is the order of man,
Resting well inÂ euphemismÂ and excuse;
In biting reality, eternally sleepless.

No, I do not believe roses only bloom just to conceal the thorns.
I merely accept the thorn pricked finger bleeds.

It isÂ foolishÂ to think the adder benign.

Let us walk together in acute perception, wake insight from sleep;
Outside of doctrines, anchored in bitterÂ reality.

I will walk with you, my friend.Â 

We will walk...
