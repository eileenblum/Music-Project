Disfigured forms will envelop the skies and shadow the globe in swarms.
As petty hates warpÂ hollow-men, their visage scowls and swiftly distorts.

The pain of life has twisted your face,
You stagger with the hooves on which you walkÂ 
The pain of life has altered your physical state of being
Devolved and mutated, a mortal mockery,
Grossly winged and given flight.

Malformed brows,Â misshapenÂ minds,
Every heartache brings a new deformity.
Morbid growths form on beasts of weakness
Reshaping men into demons.

Man into demon
Earth into hell

I maintain fortitude on this demon-haunted world,
Not the dysmorphic shell of a delicate man,
But a beast of outrage and Â opposition.

The pain of life has twisted your face
You stagger with the hooves on which you walk
The pain of life has altered your physical state of being.
Devolved and mutated, a mortal mockery
Given flight by demons wings.
