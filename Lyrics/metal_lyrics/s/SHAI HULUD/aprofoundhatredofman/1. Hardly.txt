I am a memory,
I never existed
And now I am nothing. 
Her name, a single word
Melts me, takes me to the ground.
Only alive, can't she see
I'm destroyed by yesterdays.
And do I gain?
I could only Dream
For chance to side with me,
Inquire, ingest, implode.
Let this not be the disassemblance of me.
Another night with arms still empty.
I'm destroyed.
And do I gain?
Or just fall.
