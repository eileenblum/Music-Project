[Lyrics: Shamil Usarov, music: Max Krasilnikov / Shamil Usarov]

Wandering around
Digging down deep to the roots
Of my phobias and frailties
Waiting to break loose

Living not alone, believing alone
In the fears of yesterday

It's the way I found my spirit
The way I chose to live
Thriving my conception
Brace up and learn to breathe

The way I found my power
The way I chose to fight
Binding my repentance
Brace up and not abide

Drowning in the blood of villains
Knuckles ground to dust
Piercing fists through their viscera
Righteous carnivore

Living not alone, believing alone
In the fears of yesterday

Now I've found my honor
The way I chose to mean
Granting my forgiveness
Brace up and bow the knee

The way I found my wisdom
The way I chose to die
The way I felt my fortune
The way I learned to fly

And I gave 'em my legacy to break loose
No more fears of yesterday
