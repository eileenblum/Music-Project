[Lyrics: Timur Chubaklar / Shamil Usarov / Max Krasilnikov, music: Max Krasilnikov]

Think you decide the fate of the millions?
Think you can get away with this swag?

How about your ass got pulled out from home
A lesson in violence â once and for all
No proxy-servers, no anonymous
Just you and your courage against real world

Bad news, my darling: our show begins
Releasing hidden fears and sins
Good news, my darling: there's a chance for a few
Get hurry to kill or someone kills you

What do you know about chaos, my dear?
I'm gonna whisper right in your ear
System has failed, panic has started
Access denied, life torn apart

Bad news, my darling: our show begins
Releasing hidden fears and sins
Good news, my darling: there's a chance for a few
Get hurry to kill or someone kills you

No one cares!
New world chaos!

Stop using web as a veil to your faults
Say it to my face or fuck off

Bad news, my darling: our show begins
