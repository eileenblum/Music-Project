[Lyrics: Shamil Usarov, Timur Chubaklar; music: Shamil Usarov]

Cold sweat covers your face
Loveliness turned to disgrace

Drug is a prison - sentence's infinity
Step down off heaven, you aren't angel
Loosing in fantasy, princess of ecstasy
Over again I'm talking to you!

Offered heaven rejected
Ignoring my caress
Begone! Just low!
Road to Barathrum

Remember moments of blessing
Looking for answers: where and when?
Opium vortex sucking you down
Rotting to the core - fatal disease

Offered heaven rejected
Ignoring my caress
Begone! Just low!
You're on the end of a dead-end road

Once beloved
Horrid now
I'll make your disease
Come to an end

Offered heaven rejected
Ignored my caress
Begone! Just low!
You won't hurt yourself no more

Sweet dreams jadish angel
Wings are burnt in grave you've landed
Crucified for your affection
