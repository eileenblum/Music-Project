[Lyrics: Shamil Usarov / Timur Chubaklar, music: Max Krasilnikov / Shamil Usarov]

Credit system guaranties sustainability
Of the government that rules global policy
Affiliated by financial bosses for the sake of benefit
Brought to power monsters for their own prosperity

Liberty is substituted by priorities
Aggregated to one-sided manual of loyalty
Fair play in commas, details in lowercase
People fastly moving to the termination phase

Blindfold enforcement
Rudimental honour
Sewn shut eyes of Themis
Gazing at the morass
Of our law and order

And it's international
Global web of confidence
Breaking the living of the most
For the greater good of the few
We have fought to get the rights
We have fought to break the gyve
We have lost

Chairborne decisions
Dominate a nation
Mental coma is mainstream
And controlled
By Anomie's Incorporated

And it's international
Global web of confidence
Breaking the living of the most
For the greater good of the few
We have won the right to fight
We have won the ought to fall
We are lost

Entailing the coffins
Stowing full of shattered dreams
To the basement of modern slavery

And it's international
Global web on confidence
Breaking the living of the most
For the greater good of the few
We have lost the discipline
We have lost the liberty
We have lost the battle but not the war

Resist!
