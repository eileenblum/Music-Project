[Lyrics: Timur Chubaklar / Shamil Usarov, music: Max Krasilnikov / Shamil Usarov]

Cast iron logic
Cult of science, liberating agony
Gas chamber lullaby
Forest of walking logs

Try to saw it, try to assess
Eviscerate, get a closer look
Dead shell full of entrails
And other useful details

Life will praise what is done by means of death
But now you're on killing bed

Your time has come
Now time has come

I know who you are, I know you are Maruta
You'll be burned, will be smoke that we breathe, can't exhale
It will colonize inside us, inner hell
Burning, living with us our life on the lips

Saliva-butterflies
Splashing around from mouth full of blank
Maggots stuck on
Hands-branches embracing metal rack

Cankered flesh, putrefaction
Eternal gene contamination
Scald then congeal, thinning forcemeat
Justified annihilation

Life will praise what is done by means of death
But you are still on killing bed

Sing with me my song, fall to sleep
Dream my land of the bleeding sun

Test what fear is
Degust blood's taste
Draw still-life with raw internals

Higher humanity level
Is easy to be achieved
When your soul is amputated

Life will praise what is done by means of death
But you are still on killing bed

Your work is done
Now all is done

I know who you are!
