Soul gets confused
Pride loses power
it's not the death
it's a start of a new life

Leave your lie
Try to sleep

Try to forget
About this pain
And about sufferings
Try to forget
About this pain

Try to believe
In to this words
They bring the honesty
Try to believe
In to this words

This is the final
Of the regress
You will be honest
More obedient

This is the final
Of the regress
You will be honest
More obedient

Skin is broken off on my body
Heart beats very fast for me
Skin is broken off on my body
Heart beats very fast

This process is not so pleasant
Like deceit of humanity
But it is necessity

This is last way to the full change
Of your minds and of your reason

I hope that you understand
It is my duty and mission
And I will take to you this chance

I am your source, which gives to you life
I can't leave you within this chasm
It is my duty and mission

Look at the sky
You see, it's so perfect
But it is not
Home for your reign

I love you so much
I have to help you
But you should promise
To create only truth

I know, it's so hard
I know it's so painful
But you have to try
You must bring the light

Through tons of clouds
Through set of miles
You must forget mistakes

Here is the end
Of the dreams
You must forget

Here is the end
Of the dreams
You must forget

Get up, my son
Son of the shame

Get up, my son
Son of the shame

This process is not so pleasant
Like deceit of humanity
But it is necessity

This is last way to the full change
Of your minds and of your reason

I hope that you understand
It is my duty and mission
