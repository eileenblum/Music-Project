You escape
You are hiding
This is last way
To the saving

Only sky
Only heaven
Can protect you
From the fire

Run away, run away
From the justice
Of the flame, of the flame

it's your last home
it's your last fortress

it's your last home
it's your last fortress
But very soon
It flies away
You'll stay alone
Without support

don't try to say lies
don't try to flatter
don't try to say lies
don't try to flatter

I promise to you life
I promise you will be saved

Just stay behind and throw away your rage
Death is not your choice and I know this

Just stay behind and throw away your rage
Death is not your choice
it's an easy way
You must understand
Our excitement

You lose your power
And this is correct way
You lose your power
And this is correct way

You lose your power
And this is correct way
You lose your power
And this is correct way

You lose your power
And this is correct way
You lose your power
And this is correct way

Get down on the knees
And separate your reign

Get down on the knees
And separate your reign

Get down on the knees
And separate your reign

Your residence becomes a tomb
Before you move
Your residence becomes a tomb
