I have realized
My mistakes and acts
I can understand all your rules
I repent for these sins

I have realized
My mistakes and acts
I can understand all your rules
I repent for these sins

(Voice of the sun):
Instead of deconstructing, bid this world farewell
Unite with me again in the source of flame

The sun's back to the earth
And his shine got warmed us

The sun's back to the earth
And his shine got warmed us

And now we
Can look at the sky with
The clean eyes from the ground
And not be afraid of pain
And violence of the kings of faith

it's time for apologies
And for the pardon
This world has balance
it's peaceful

it's time for apologies
And for the pardon
This world has balance
it's peaceful

Sun's light
It is the real
God of the man

Sun's light
It is the real
God of the man
