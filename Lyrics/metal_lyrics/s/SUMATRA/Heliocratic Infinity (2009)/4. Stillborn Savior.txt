The star rises up in sky
Three naive kings come to land
They all wait for the saviour's birth from virgin girl

They pray to their God
Which is to save them
But this time does not begin

They think it's miracle
But it's an only child
IN BLOOD

it's just a blood
it's just a newborn

He doesn't breathe
He doesn't scream

And this body's cold like ice

It's not warm-blooded child
It's just baby in the hands

Their eyes are full of fear
Star doesn't shine any more

Only black clouds
bring the pain into this world

it's first stage of the war
Which began a thousand years ago
When you humiliated
The angel of the heaven
Which was true to your ideals

You cannot pray
Because your son is dead
You can't escape
From your own destiny

You cannot pray
Because your son is dead
You can't escape
From destiny

Stillborn saviour
it's your loss

Stillborn saviour
it's your loss

(Voice of the son of the Sun)
I can live eternal life in fire
That will burn you in remorse

Do you have another plan?
Maybe you just must go away
Please, understand him
He's real savior
From this enslaving
From lawlessness

He is real warm-blooded
Child of the flame and sun

He is warm-blooded son

Your reign loses strength and's coming to the end
Your reign loses strength and's coming to the end
