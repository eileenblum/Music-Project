Eyes are free
From the blindness
This time has come
Time of the shine

Now people can look at the world with clean eyes
It is result of straightness and boldness

Life will be changed
Into right course

Life will be changed
Into right course

Peace comes inside in
To hearts of humans
Faith won't be icon
For the worship

Peace comes inside in
To hearts of humans
Faith won't be icon
For the worship

(the Voice of the Sun)
Son of flame and light
Come back to nest of virgin native land!

Your mission
Is complete
Now you can
Go to sleep

Take your award
You have deserved it
Pacification
And carelessness

Please forgive me
These sufferings

Warm light
Comes back to you

Hopeless life
Left behind
You must be born
One more time

You belong to me
I have given to
You an honest life
don't go back to earth

You are
My son
I am proud for your acts

You are
My son
And you re my successor

You are
My son
I am proud for your acts

You are
My son
And you re my successor

Eyes are free
From the blindness
This time has come
Time of the shine

Now people can look at the world with clean eyes
It is result of straightness and boldness

Life will be changed
Into right course

Life will be change
Into right course
