You began this war
You have made first step
Blood is your choice
I accept this fight

You have sent
To my front
A thousand of eyes, which retry to believe

You have sent
To my front
All your soldiers and

They have weapon and
A thousand of eyes, which retry to believe

I'm not killer
But I must protect the truth

Get up from the ground
Army of fire and demons of hell

Rise from the ground
This is your battle

Get up from the ground
Army of fire and demons of hell

Rise from the ground
This is your battle

it's start of bloodshed
Faith can't defense you

it's time of sacrifices
Of senseless revenge

it's start of bloodshed
Faith can't defense you

it's time of sacrifices
Of senseless revenge

I can't stop
This cruelty
Of the angels
This cruelty
Of the God
I must destroy
Everybody
Which encroaches
On my earth
I must destroy
Everybody
Which encroaches
On my earth

My fidelity will burn your rage

Father, I ask you help me
To win this fight

Father, I ask you bring me strength
To stay merciful man

I didn't want these sins
I just protected my lands

I didn't want
My conscience is pure
