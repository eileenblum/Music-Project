This is your biggest mistake
You have expelled your only ally

You will regret about it
But you cannot return this time

And now begins new age of battle for the truth

You thought he's died under the pressure of the tons of ground
But it has given him the strength for fight with you

His honor more powerful then your deceit

Prepare for greatest war of all history of world

You fear, you can't hide it behind the mask of the charity

His wing burns fire, eyes shine by revenge
And soul starts feeling the power of the real God

Which helps his minds, which helps his reason
don't be afraid, you, in this bloody massacre

This' start of game
Start of your falling

This' start of game
Start of your falling

For truth

And now begins new age of battle for the truth

You thought he's died under pressure of the tons of ground
But it has given him the strength for fight with you

Your time has gone
it's birth of son

Fair prophet

Your time has gone
it's birth of prophet
