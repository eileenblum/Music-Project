You are an imaginary
Founder of the world
But your throne - it's just clouds

Only sun has real warmth
it's real
Only sun has real warmth
I feel his power

You're just his creation - sun's spawn
Your authority - dense smoke

Try to look above
Rusty nymbus over your saint head
Maybe real lord is there
And you're only a cheap doll in his fiery hands

Recognize your helplessness and your feebleness
Fall back and don't return again
don't try to pretend authority of sanctity
I see your eyes and they are full of fear

Are you ready for the court of major reign of the sun
You are lost in your lie, which enslaved so much people
Are you ready for the court of major reign of the sun
You are lost in your lie, which enslaved so much people

You terror is punished now
Behold the strength of the real flame
Your fucking angels are dishonored

What do you mean, when you speak about the sanctity
These are the empty words and you know this like me
Just stop to run from the answer to this question
This is your
Last chance for the freedom

The eyes start to burn
Because hells fire's in your heart

The pain throws away
Your hopeless soul belongs to sun

This is the end of your
Reign over our minds
But humanity isn't free and this's your guilty

World is full of your slaves
which continue your way
And our mission is to destroy this way at all

Don't you understand
Who has begun this court
It is the real son of sun

What do you mean, when you speak about the sanctity
These are the empty words and you know this like me
Just stop to run from the answer to this question
This is your
Last chance for the freedom
