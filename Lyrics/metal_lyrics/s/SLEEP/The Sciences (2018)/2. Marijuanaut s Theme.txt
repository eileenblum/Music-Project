Saturn V rise - as gravity dies - through ionosphere he flies.
Capsule is flown - beyond the known - admixture sustains smokesuit as home.
Traverse galactic sea - inhaler of the rifftree.
Initiate burn - never to return - a distant earth fades receding.

Through the hashteroid fields - a transmission yields - now riff beacon signal is received.
Trajectory set a new bearing - cross alien skies command module flies.
Sojourns the lone stoned soul - Marijuanaut loads of a new bowl.
Behold as he enters the clearing - Planet Iommia nearing.

Through Iommosphere chutes deploy capsule splash down on the TH sea. To raft - row the hash oil leagues to shoreline.
