Drop out of life with bong in hand
Follow the Smoke toward the Riff filled Land
Dropâ¦out of life with bong in hand
Follow the Smoke toward the Riff filled Land

[Solo One]

Proceeds the Weedian â Nazareth
Proceeds the Weedian â Nazareth

Creedsmen roll out across the dying dawn
Sacred Israel Holy Mountain Zion
Sun beams down on to the Sandsea reigns
Caravan migrates through deep sandscape
Lungsmen unearth the creed of Hasheeshian
Procession of the Weed-Priests to cross the sands
Desert Legion Smoke-Covenant is complete
Herb bails retied on to backs of beasts
Arise arise arise - The Son of the God of Israel
Jordan River flows on evermore
Bathe in glow of sunlightâs beating rays
They feel so lost and burned through our days
Stoner caravan emerge from sandsea
Earthling inserts to chalice the green cutchie
Groundation soul finds trust upon smoking hose
Assembled creedsmen rises prayer-filled smoke
Raise up seerâs Holy Prophecy
Lets down on upon years of the sun now feeds
Seed of Eden fall on the nurtured soil
Onward caravan prepare new bong

Weed-Priests, creedsmen chant the right
Judgement soon come to Mankind
Green Herbsmen serve rightful king
Hemp seed caravan carries

[Solo Two]

The molten fire flowed up toward Zion
Flight of the Nazarene to seek the Cheribum
Rides out believer with the spliff aflame
Marijuanaut escapes earth to cultivate

[Solo Three]

Grow-Room is church temple of the new stoner breed
Chants Loud-Robed priest down on to the freedom seed
Burnt offering redeems â completes smoked deliverance
Caravan's stoned deliverance
The caravan holds to Eastern Creed - Now smokes believer !
The Chronicle of the Sinsemillian

Drop out of life with bong in hand
Follow the smoke toward the riff-filled land
Drop out of life with bong in hand
Follow the smoke: Jerusalem
