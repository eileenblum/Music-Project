I once knew
A dream of you
When the night
Was ours to remember

We'd both seen
What might have been
Before the night
Was taken away forever

When the war is over
Will you be there?
When the war is over
Will anyone really care?
When the war is over
Will you remember me?
When the war is over
Will there still be something to believe in?

Now I'm here
I've lived with fear
And the loss
Of everything I had

A sacrifice
Of every vice
And virtue
I had in a life with you

When the war is over
Will you be there?
When the war is over
Will anyone really care?
When the war is over
Will you remember me?
When the war is over
Will there still be something to believe in?

Every night I think of you
And all those things we'd used to do
Now I'm here, and you're all alone
Will you be there when I come home?

When the war is over
Will you be there?
When the war is over
Will anyone really care?
When the war is over
Will you remember me?
When the war is over
Will there still be something to believe in?
