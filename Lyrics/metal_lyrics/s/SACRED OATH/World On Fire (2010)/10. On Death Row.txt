You're beat down and you're losing face
Can't get up, can't get out of this trance
Yeah I know, it's an epidemic
They take you out
Ritual
Systemic

Flattened your mind, burned your soul
There was a heart, now a gaping hole
Yeah I know, I'm living in the dead zone
We're all here, you're not alone

On death row
The last show
Plays out in my mind
On death row
We all know
What's on the other side for us

My last stand
The Ferryman
Has set aside his fare
On death row
Now you know
You can't break the reaper's spell

On death row
