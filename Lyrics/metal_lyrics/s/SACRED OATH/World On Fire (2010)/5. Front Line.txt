The front line is closer
Than it's ever been before
Why march through the desert
When it's knocking at your door?
Bankers on Wall Street
Have looted you blind
HMOs are killing you
Open your eyes

Greed and corruption
Proliferate
Back-handed politics
In the business of hate
Clouding your vision
With so many lies
Your only focus
Is terror in the skies

It's suicide

When you're on the front line
Each breath could be your last
But on this front line
They keep you alive
'Cause on this front line
You're worthless if you're dead
What is this front line
That runs across my head?
