VO       Distressed and
LU       You've lost your faith
TION

RE       The system
VO       Is a piston
LU       Pounding you in the face
TION

RE       Tomorrow
VO       You'll borrow
LU       More sorrow with an interest rate
TION

Get it organized
You've got nothing to lose
And everything to gain
Let's have a revolution
Work it out in your mind
But play it out on the streets
Sometimes violence
Is the only solution

FIGHT    When did we
THE        Drop to our knees
POWER  And give it up?

GO          You bought in
VERN      To this system
MENT     Mortgaged your first born son

FIGHT    They're taking
THE        What you're making
POWER  And leave you cold

GOLD     You're dying
MAN       For trying
SACHS   Your life was bought and sold

Get it organized
You've got nothing to lose
And everything to gain
Let's have a revolution
Work it out in your mind
But play it out on the streets
Sometimes violence
Is the only solution

You've got nothing to lose
Nothing left to lose
