The drums of war echo
across the funeral plain
No sanctuary for the dead
The sound of bone cracking the
air beneath the skin
A thunderbolt inside your head

Drums of war
The reaper will dance for us
To the rhythmic drums of war
And hymns of human sacrifice

A man will die for something
if he can believe
he stands for righteousness and truth
But who would tune these
drums of war and set the beat of
battle hymns for our youth?

Drums of war
The reaper will dance for us
To the rhythmic drums of war
And hymns of human sacrifice

The drums of war echo
across the funeral plain
No sanctuary for the dead
The sound of bone cracking the
air beneath the skin
A thunderbolt inside your head

Drums of war
The reaper will dance for us
To the rhythmic drums of war
And hymns of human sacrifice
