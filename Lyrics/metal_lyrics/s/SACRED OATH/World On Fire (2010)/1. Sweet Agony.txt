How the sweet agony!
Sweet agony!

I am a wave crushing.
A thousand fists smashing.
Head like a shark thrashing
Through the enemy.

I'll take your leader down,
Decapitate the crown.
De-sanctify the sound
Of Hallelujah.

I'm on the wind,
I'm in the flame.
My heart is frozen.
I can stand your pain.

I've had enough
Of your smoke and mirrors.
My revolution can't get
Any clearer.

Face to face with your God
In my sweet agony.
I'll give you a vision
Of what every future can be.

I'm like a wild fire,
Spark up the funeral pyre.
Burn every last liar.
Witches at the stake.

I'll be the one
To get it done.
A thousand generations,
I'm the only son.

I'm on the blood,
I'm in your veins.
Your heart is frozen.
Can you stand my pain?

I'll force it in you
Through a little hole,
And change the waters
Starting with your soul.

Face to face with your God
In my sweet agony.
I'll give you a vision
Of what every future can be.

Oh the sweet agony!
My sweet agony!
My sweet agony!
My sweet agony!
My sweet agony!
My sweet agony!
