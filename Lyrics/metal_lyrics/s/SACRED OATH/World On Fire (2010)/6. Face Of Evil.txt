Look in my eyes
What do you see?
Reflections of a vacant soul
All my lies
Have caught up with me
I spit on death
My wings unfold

I want to taste your blood
Unholy flood
Bathe in your misery
Drape it around me

Draining away by the ounce
I can see that you're pale
That taste on my lips -
Evidence that your soul is for sale
The hell in your heart is a start
Now you're under my spell
I've broken your will with a spill
And I've loved every bit of this kill

Taste my breath
Reaching deep into you
Infecting -
Rotting your soul
Spread my seed
Now you can't deny me
Call me father
I won't let go

I want to taste your blood
Unholy flood
Bathe in your misery
Drape it around me

Draining away by the ounce
I can see that you're pale
That taste on my lips -
Evidence that your soul is for sale
The hell in your heart is a start
Now you're under my spell
I've broken your will with a spill
And I've loved every bit of this kill
