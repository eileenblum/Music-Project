Open your mind
Beyond space, outside time
To a legend of heroes and villains
Of a people enslaved
Led to freedom this day
By a man who did stand
And point the way
Who did show that the maker
He could tame
And fulfilled the prophecy

The rightful heir of Atreides
Born of a witch - Bene Gesserit
He holds the power
Of a thousand kings

Learned in the ways of a warrior
With visions of every future
He'll lead the Fremen to the
Battle cry of "Muad 'Dib!"

Oh! Sandrider!

He is the revolution
The perfect evolution
Of witch and warrior
No one can stand against him

He's come and gone
From that dark place
Death has a familiar face
He changed the Water of Life
From death's own poison

All thought that he was dead
But he vas deep in the desert
Hidden from treachery
Living the prophecy

Witness the Haderach
The Kwisatz Haderach
Duke of Atreides
Rise up and follow him
Take back your planet
From those that rape it
Will you be a slave
Or will you be a sandrider?

The Reverend Mothers
Will cower in fear
When they see that their breeding and
plotting has led them here
He does what he likes, what he feels,
what he sees to be righteous
He'll not be manipulated,
he'll fight the good fight

The rightful heir of Atreides
Born of a witch - Bene Gesserit
He holds the power
Of a thousand kings

He is the revolution
The perfect evolution
He'll lead the Fremen to the
Battle cry of "Muad 'Dib!"

Witness the Haderach
The Kwisatz Haderach
Duke of Atreides
Rise up and follow him
Take back your planet
From those that rape it
Will you be a slave
Or you be a sandrider?
