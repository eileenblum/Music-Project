I've seen the end of the line

And the future is mine
But the king must die
Now rise up and be saved
No longer enslaved
Throw these chains aside

I will take your daughter
Take you to the slaughter
For the king must die
And I will take the throne
For my very own
But first you must die

Our fate was written in the stars
We only follow starlight
The spice will guide you on your way
The king must die

All my life I've known
That a day like this would come
Now I'm face to face with
The moment of truth
Will I have the strength
To see it through?

Our fate was written in the stars
We only follow starlight
The spice will guide you on your way
The king must die
