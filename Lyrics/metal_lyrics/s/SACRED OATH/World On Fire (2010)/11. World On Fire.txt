The sand in my eyes
An hourglass vision of time
The end is near

Grain by grain
Each granular movement is pain
But I'll not fear

As the world burns around me
I know that you will find me
In the ashes

World on fire
(And heaven in flames)
This funeral pyre
(Is a coronation)
The wicked fanfare
And demon choir
Deliver a new anthem
Of darker days
And suffering
Who will come to save you?

No heart made of stone
Can beat with the blood I have sown
In this garden of death

Tears can't restore
The casualties of this war
Now you've lost your way
As the world burns around you
The darkness will seat you
Upon the throne

World on fire
(And heaven in flames)
This funeral pyre
(Is a coronation)
The wicked fanfare
And demon choir
Deliver a new anthem
Of darker days
And suffering
Who will come to save you?

This battlefield inside the flesh
A conflict for the ages
The rise and fall within us all
Our nature never changes

World on fire
World on tire
