I'm gonna leave this world we're in
Take a rocket ship to the moon
I'm gonna strap my bad self in
Chart a course for the planet of Dune

Call me a witch, call me the devil
Call me Lisan al 'Gaib
Call me Kwisatz Haderach
Either way I'm a prophet in time

Great Mother's son
The chosen one
To point the way
Meet your maker

I'll cut a path through space and time
Cut a line, blow your mind, so fine
Plant the tree of knowledge there
Cut you down at harvest time

Call me a saint, call me a sinner
Call me messiah, ride my heighliner
Cali me Kwisatz Haderach
I'm a product of prana-bindu

Great Mother's son
The chosen one
To point the way
Meet your maker

And when I rise in spite of you
Don't try to take me out
I play you like a rook in chess
Already played you out

Then when I ride
The worm through hell
Meet my maker -
Break the emperor's spell
I'll take the throne and crown
myself king of hell

Great Mother's son
The chosen one
To point the way
Meet your maker
