Blood and bone 
Fire and stone 
Sung in the dead of night 
Follow me home 

Dead black eyes 
Starless sky 
Hung in the dead of night 
Swinging alone 

I remember the melody 
Of the ravensong 
Twisted cacophony 
Wounded symphony 
A mournful tune 
Drape me in the black rhapsody 
Of that ravensong 
And I'll find some comfort 
In the knowing 
That I'm not alone.
