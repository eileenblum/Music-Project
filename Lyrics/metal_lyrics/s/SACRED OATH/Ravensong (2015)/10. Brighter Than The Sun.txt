Dying to live 
Can't wait to rise 
Trapped in the dark 
Held down 

All that I give 
My sacrifice 
Burning inside 
Burning down 

Don't lay me down to rest 
My flesh will bear the test 
No earth can hold me down 
No tombstone on this crown 

This soul burns brighter than the sun 
I'll fight this battle âtil I've won 
Iâm burning brighter than the sun 
Iâm in this battle âtil Iâve won 

Slamming the door 
Locking me up 
Flipping the switch 
In my brain 

How many more 
Am I to take 
Into this ditch? 
It's insane 

Don't lay me down to rest 
My flesh will bear the test 
No earth can hold me down 
No tombstone on this crown 

This soul burns brighter than the sun 
I'll fight this battle âtil I've won 
Iâm burning brighter than the sun 
Iâm in this battle âtil Iâve won 

Sold on a dream 
I gave it my all 
A deal that was made 
With the devil 

Painted the scenes 
On my funeral pall 
The canvas I gave 
Now I'm horizontal 

Don't lay me down to rest 
My flesh will bear the test 
No earth can hold me down 
No tombstone on this crown 

This soul burns brighter than the sun 
I'll fight this battle âtil I've won 
Iâm burning brighter than the sun 
Iâm in this battle âtil Iâve won
