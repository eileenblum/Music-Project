The way she moves 
I want to hold her breath 
And touch her silently 
Like this, like death 

Makes my heart race 
The way she claws at my face 
I want to know 
The way she tastes 

My necrodancer 
Comes every night 
A necromancer 
The dead will rise 
Some say she's evil 
And has no heart 
I say she's everything 
A man could want 

Eye of the devil 
Lips like the gates of heaven 
I start to tremble 
Turn me up to eleven 

I'm seeing double 
Now I'm in trouble 
Mirror mirror 
I'm on the wall 

My necrodancer 
Comes every night 
A necromancer 
The dead will rise 
Some say she's evil 
And has no heart 
I say she's everything 
A man could want 

I promised anything 
She took me for everything 
I thought I was in love 
When she left me 
And now I'm all alone 
Like a dog without a bone 
Hear me howling at the moon 

My necrodancer 
Came every night 
A necromancer 
The dead would rise 
Said she was evil 
And had no heart 
That woman gave me everything 
A man could want
