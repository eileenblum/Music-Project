You're gonna go far 
Just look where you are 
You've got the world on a string 

It's only uptown 
No bringing you down 
You're like a bird on the wing 

Oh yeah, NOW baby 

Culture of liars 
Culture of sin 
Culture of posting 
The mood that you're in 
Spiders are drawing 
Your blood with your PIN 
You played in 
Culture of sin 

You're in the action 
You're getting traction 
10,000 âlikesâ in a day 

But you're a loner 
A chronic stoner 
They've got your number at the end of the day 

Oh yeah, NOW baby 

Culture of liars 
Culture of sin 
Culture of posting 
The mood that you're in 
Spiders are drawing 
Your blood with your PIN 
You played in 
Culture of sin
