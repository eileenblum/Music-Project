Dusk bleeds out of a shady grove 
And settles in around my heart 
When the stars cascade cold light down on my shoulders 
I'm reminded that we're apart 

When all is said and done 
And time moves on 
Will you be gone forever? 

Western wind like your soft breath 
Your hand in mine, I've not forgotten 
You've been the sunrise, the stormy clouds in my eyes 
The desert heat, the winter chill 

When all is said and done 
And time moves on 
Will you be gone forever? 

Now the tide, conspiring with the moon 
Has taken you away from me 
And my heart sinks like a stone 
To the bottom of the sea 

When all is said and done 
And time moves on 
Will you be gone forever?
