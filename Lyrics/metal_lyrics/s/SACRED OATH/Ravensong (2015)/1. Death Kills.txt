Can't stop, can't go 
Can't stay in control 
Paralyze me 
Now I can't see 
Death on my shoulder 
Bone chill, colder 
Silence approaching 
What will it bring? 

Death kills 
Blood spills 
Escape 
Before it's too late 
Live well 
Under my spell 
Believe 
And get a reprieve 

Can't keep me down 
Six feet underground 
Rise from ashes 
59 lashes 
Zero hour 
Fight the power 
So elusive 
Divide and devour 

All that you want is a promise from me 
That I'll save your soul from some hell 
Look how you're living, the fires are burning 
Your heart is an empty shell
