You give me all the right reasons 
To do the wrong things 
Your moods the seasons 
The tiger in the ring 

Can't tame the master 
My heart is beating faster 
Waiting in my cage 
What will you bring? 

Heaven-sent, forgiven 
Hell-bent for living 
At the edge of madness 
Heaven-sent, forgiven 
Hell-bent for living 
In the shadows of despair 

I've mastered self-control 
Can't get me to react 
I don't get emotional 
Even when yours are out of whack 

You can't destroy me 
You might as well enjoy me 
Pound me with your rage 
I'll never crack 

Heaven-sent, forgiven 
Hell-bent for living 
At the edge of madness 
Heaven-sent, forgiven 
Hell-bent for living 
In the shadows of despair 

If I had known that dark meant gray 
I'd paint this canvas differently 
If I had seen light in the black 
If I had known there was no turning back 
I'd hand the wick into the flame 
And burn a candle in your name 
I'd pray 
Drop to my knees and pray 

You give me just enough 
To keep me on a chain 
Got spunk, I'm so damned tough 
I won't acknowledge pain 

Heaven-sent, forgiven 
Hell-bent for living 
At the edge of madness 
Heaven-sent, forgiven 
Hell-bent for living 
In the shadows of despair
