I'm clinging to your memory 
A dark river in my soul 
A rushing wall of water 
Spilling into deeper pools 

You saturate me 
I feel you hate me 
Work your way down my throat 
And I can't breathe 

We understood each other once 
Like brothers called to arms 
Broken upon the riverbank 
By wind and howling storms 

Now I'm just staring 
Through this broken lens 
Clouds just out of reach 
And I can't breathe 

Taken my breath away 
And I turn blue 
Taken my breath away 
I choke on you 

I struggle for an image 
To help me settle in 
A story to explain 
This bitter cold 

To give my dread a purpose 
To give this sound a voice 
To put things in perspective 
Make sense out of white noise 

Taken my breath away 
And I turn blue 
Taken my breath away 
I choke on you
