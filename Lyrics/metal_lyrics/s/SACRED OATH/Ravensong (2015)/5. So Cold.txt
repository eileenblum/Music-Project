Enormous power of will 
Swallowing every last thrill 
Purified blood with a chill 
In your veins, running cold as ice 

Somehow it controls what you say 
And now it controls what you do 
I'm trapped and I can't get free 
Of the crushing, choking grip 

You're as cold as ice 
By your own devise 
I'm your sacrifice 
A life without love 
Now I'm as cold as ice 
And I've paid the price 
What we've sacrificed 
Can never be regained 
I'm cold as ice. 

Some call it focus, 
Ambition, or greed, 
When a dream consumes you 
For its own needs 
I call it loneliness 
You call it hell 
You never understood 
But I guess that's just as well 

So cold 
Youâve got ice in your veins 
And you bring me such pain 
Youâre so cold
