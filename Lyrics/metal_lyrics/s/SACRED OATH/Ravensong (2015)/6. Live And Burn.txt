Came of age in 85 
16 and so alive 
And the stars drew a destiny on my night 

Had my share of good times 
And a whole lotta bad times 
I learned how to make war out of love 

Played it out on a stage 
Sang a song of majestic rage 
Every night was a struggle to the death 

Still I always found resurrection 
In the quest for sweet perfection 
Sometimes I'd get it right, more often times I'd not 

Like a Phoenix rising 
I must live and burn 
When death pursues me 
I must live and learn 

My wings catch fire 
Still I live and learn 
When Satan claims me 
Still I live and burn 
When the worms have got me 
Still I live and burn 
Like a Phoenix rising 
I must live and burn 

Live and burn
