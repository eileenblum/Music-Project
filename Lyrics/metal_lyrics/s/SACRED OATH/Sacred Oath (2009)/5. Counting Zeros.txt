The days have grown long
And the nights have grown cold
We once were young and strong
Now we're weakened and old

We came to this land
In search of freedom
And put in its place
A new breed of kingdom

Alive, but we're dying
We're silent, but we're crying out in pain
Been waiting for a savior to rise again
Once this was a place for heroes
Now they're all just counting zeros, and my life
Is nothing more than a line in the sand

They put out our eyes
With visions of grandeur
And cut out our tongues
With the bitter taste of failure

They covered our ears
With the promise of freedom
And we ransomed our souls
For Gods we believed in

Alive, but we're dying
We're silent, but we're crying out in pain
Been waiting for a savior to rise again
Once this was a place for heroes
Now they're all just counting zeros, and my life
Is nothing more than a line in the sand

Now I ask you, can we stand up as one
And go after our freedom
Rectify the faÃ§ade
Of a free nation
Destroy the golden shackles
Awaiting our children

Alive, but we're dying
We're silent, but we're crying out in pain
Been waiting for a savior to rise again
Once this was a place for heroes
Now they're all just counting zeros, and my life
Is nothing more than a line in the sand
