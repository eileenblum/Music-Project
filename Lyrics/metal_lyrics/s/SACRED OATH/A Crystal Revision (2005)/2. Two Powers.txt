The dream it ends,Or was it real ?
My mind cannot recall
I saw the world engulfed in sea
the power forces fall
I begin to fall into a deep sleep,
Or is it another plane ?

I saw the world,a lump of clay just hanging there in space
And in the core the rock contorts to form an ugly face
Tears condense &amp; fall upon the earth - life begins again

Foliage spreads across the earth
The sunlight gives us warmth to ease the birth
Creatures crawling,swimming,flying - 
Fighting
Two powers arise,&amp; one descends,
Two powers fight until the end
The race is on,the battles begun
