Death is his life - he kills the innocent for his own need
The end of his knife is stained with the blood of a forgotten creed
Running alone,living his life in sincerity
The fall of a throne satisfies his need for security

Many men before in their foolish youth have tried to mislead the Ferryman
To pass the cold waters with reason uncouth,they tried to play him a merryman

From a forgotten land he rules the waters to eternity
His bony hand is ridden with the blood of his daring prey
He works for a god &amp; a devil as well
Oh ! Watch him nod as you enter his hell

He peers out from his hood
laughing aloud as you step in his lair
His black ugly hood stares into souls as he asks for his fare
But take care foolish passenger
please beware of the Ferryman !
