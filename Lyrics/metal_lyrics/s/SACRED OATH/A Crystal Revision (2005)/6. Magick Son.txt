As the battle subsides neither power has won
Like a star falls a second son
Made in the likeness of the other,
Casting spells -
the wizard knows the ways
Black &amp; white,highest grade
Watch him weave spell after spell

Hear my prophecy,doom shall come to thee !
Perpetual night,dark must join with light

Magick Son warns us of the end
Magick Son - a bolt of light,
he does descend
Magick Son warns us of the end
Magick Son - our ways we must amend

Before the two the twin speaks his peace
Yet they frown,both in disbelief
Watch him turn earth into water

Both father &amp; son scorn at this plea
It's been this way forever &amp; so it shall be
Both sons prepare to fight as the
king stares on in fright
The dark one conjures up despair
Magick Son is sucked into the air !
