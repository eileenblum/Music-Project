On this night my spirit will rise
Through your life death takes disguise
Your deceit has tortured my soul
Take revenge - my hatred unfolds now

Into the night I'll take your useless life
Feel my vengeance as I kill you with my knife

Rising from the grave -
feel my evil knife
Rising from the grave -
I've come for you,I've come tonight
Rising from the grave -
feel my evil knife
Rising from the grave -
I've come to take your life

The time has come for all to take the sacred oath
The time has come for the dead to avenge the living
This oath shall be the doorway to your world
It is sacred - unite darkness with light

On this night all remains the same
Except your life - it ends in writhing pain
