I rule the sky,messenger of light
And the world is anew once again
I had failed before,my son prevailed in war
He was drowned &amp; sent to repent
But things turned out differently,
a ruler he must be
Now he reigns in Hell
His intentions ? Well...

He has set out to crush the world again
He has planted his seed
And death awakens within

The time has come for
the people to see
It is I who will grant them
their dreams
It's not over yet,nor will it ever be
But the pain ?
I must end misery
