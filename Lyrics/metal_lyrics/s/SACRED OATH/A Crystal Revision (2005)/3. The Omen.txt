I ruled a world possessed with hate
It's destruction was a product of your fate
This world is done,I'll build anew
Though my father is king,
his reign is through

Watch my hatred flow
As my offspring grow
Now I'll rule again
The Omen

The seed is sown to create
my tainted son
Eyes wide open,mission has begun
Watching father,thunder cracks the sky
Feel the rain,it's his turn to cry
