There's a child staring across the water
As he sights his forgotten father
Tears flow from his hideous face
The face that has lived through 
the hell of his race

The time is lost as he sights the moon
The music is sweet,he begins to swoon
The water is rising,washing away any evidence
Of the failures &amp; ruins -
the destruction of man

The cycle goes on

The taste of salt in his mouth
As he stares at the emptiness left in the south
His body is numb,unfeeling to this death
He dies with three sixes engraved on his breast

Now there remains only the water,
just a fragment of sand,
and the blood on the altar
Has flowed through the
generations of blindness
As they prayed to their symbols of peace &amp; kindness
