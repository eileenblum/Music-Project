Now the time has come
The battle will begin once again -
Death
The two powers will fight for control
Will the Omen tempt the soul ?

Man may perish again for he will
never feed the light
No,man is never right
He'll never win the fight
I sense the rain

You children of Christ aren't any better
Your world is getting wetter now !
