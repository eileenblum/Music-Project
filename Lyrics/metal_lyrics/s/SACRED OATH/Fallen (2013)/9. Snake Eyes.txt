Uncontrolled desire
Made me your slave
Now my heart's on fire
I can't keep away

Every waking thought
Consumed by your flame
Now my knees get weak
When you call my name

Snake eyes
Snake â telling my lies
Snake â turning me on
Snake â burning me down
Like a house on fire

Snake eyes
Snake â and you've got the forked tongue
Snake â I should have run
Snake â but you hypnotized me
With those black snake eyes

Wrap your lips around me
Swallow me whole

My momma told me about girls like you
You've got no shame and nothing better to do
Than take a boy like me
Turn me into a man
I think I'm falling in love again

You've got me up (down), in (out)
Make me want to scream (shout)
I've got fire running in my veins

I've got to have you, need you
Really want to please you
Know what it's like to feel my pain

Pure lust and hunger
I'm never satisfied
No trick unturned
Nothing you ain't tried

You've got me in your hands
I'm begging for my life
Baby, I can't breathe
When you stare at me with those...

Snake eyes
Snake â telling my lies
Snake â turning me on
Snake â burning me down
Like a house on fire

Snake eyes
Snake â and you've got the forked tongue
Snake â I should have run
Snake â but you hypnotized me
With those black snake eyes

Snake eyes
Snake â telling my lies
Snake â turning me on
Snake â burning me down
Like a house on fire

Snake eyes
Snake â and you've got the forked tongue
Snake â I should have run
Snake â but you hypnotized me
With those black snake eyes

Snake
