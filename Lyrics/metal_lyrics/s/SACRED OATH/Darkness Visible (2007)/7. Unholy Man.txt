[Rob Thorne]

Youï¿½ve got a white house, youï¿½ve got power
Letï¿½s start a holy war
Inauguration or witching hour-
Is there a difference anymore?

Unholy Man.

You get stronger, we get weaker
Vampire President
You sink your fangs in ever deeper
And drain whatever weï¿½ve got left

Unholy Man.

Gonna dance around your fire now
In the hot sands of the ï¿½Iï¿½ nations
A deadly step to shake the earth
And confidence for generations

The world will never be the same
Now fear has taken root
And weï¿½ll dance this jig to the crushing beat
Of military boots

Sons and daughters lace them up
For the honorable slaughter
The threat of terror is the tempo
You are the conductor

We dance
Victims of circumstance
Put us all in a trance
Hook, line, and sinker ï¿½
We dance.

And there was war in heaven.
Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon and his angels fought back.
But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.
The great dragon was hurled down ï¿½ that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the world astray.
He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.
[Revelation 12:7-9]

Theyï¿½ve forsaken me
Woe to the earth and the sea

Unholy man
Yes he does what he can
To erase any progress weï¿½ve made
And have you believe
That the heart on his sleeve
Has been fed on heavenly bread

Now weï¿½re undone
The end has begun

Unholy Man, because heï¿½s elected
His throne is protected
By law

Now weï¿½re undone
The end has begun

Unholy Man.
