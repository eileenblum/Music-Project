[Rob Thorne]

Watch us gather ï¿½round the fire
Sharing ritual soul to soul
Cone of Power teasing desire
Pagan minds, black as coal

Queen of the night

Raised from the grave before the altar
Her kingdom come, her will be done
Will you run, or will you ride her?
Will she fork you with her tongue?

Cry
Mourning hearts crying out in sorrow
Day after day live in pain
No yesterday, no tomorrow
Is this love?  Am I insane?

No one understand true love
Until theyï¿½re deep in the heart
Of  the Queen of the Night.
