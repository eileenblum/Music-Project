[Pete Altieri]

Across the fields we see the fight
On battlefields fought through the night
We killed by force, we struck them dead
The men were gored, we moved ahead

So many fell to meet their doom
So many more will be there soon
We met our fate and felt the pain
A thunderstorm of crimson rain

Horses galloping through the trees
Bloody soldiers on their knees
Raise the swords, itï¿½s time to die
Screaming out our battle cry

Battle Cry!
Battle Cry!
Time to die!
Battle Cry!

A flag is raised in victory
The battlefield is a blood-red sea
We fought the war and lived to tell
About the war and of its hell

Weï¿½ve seen it all ï¿½ the bodies falling
Millions watching others mauling
A canopy for human season
Millions die without a reason

Horses galloping through the trees
Bloody soldiers on their knees
Raise the swords, itï¿½s time to die
Screaming out our battle cry

Battle Cry!
Battle Cry!
Time to die!
Battle Cry!
