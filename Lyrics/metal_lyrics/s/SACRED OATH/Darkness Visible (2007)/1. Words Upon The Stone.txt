[Rob Thorne]

Have you ever felt a calling
Drawing you somewhere?
A place you feel youï¿½ve been before ï¿½
A connection to whatï¿½s there?

It was in the local cemetery
I searched for the stone
And what I found filled me with awe ï¿½
The words upon that stone!

[chorus]
Reader behold as you pass by
As you are now so once was I
As I am now so you must be
Prepare for death and follow me.

Iï¿½m telling you I felt myself
Down beneath that stone
A life before that I had lived
Centuries far gone.

The name had long since been eroded
The date was barely there.
But all I saw was mine upon
That tombstoneï¿½s deadly stare.

[chorus]
Reader behold as you pass by
As you are now so once was I
As I am now so you must be
Prepare for death and follow me.
