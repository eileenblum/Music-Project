[Rob Thorne]

Donï¿½t stand up for what you believe
You might disappear
Wonï¿½t go get yourself a reprieve
From the threat of fear
Hope ï¿½ that dream is fading away
And youï¿½re awake in hell
Dope wonï¿½t make it all go away
But you never can tell . . .

Your death is inevitable

Shout, but your voice canï¿½t be heard
Your mouth is moving but I canï¿½t make the words . . .
Fight, but I canï¿½t feel the pain
Thatï¿½s why we call it a game
Kill, come on and do it again
Youï¿½ll make it real, the only question is when.

Your death ï¿½ itï¿½s inevitable
Your brain ï¿½ itï¿½s inedible

Shout, but your voice canï¿½t be heard
Your mouth is moving but I canï¿½t make the words . . .
Fight, but I canï¿½t feel the pain
Thatï¿½s why we call it a game
Kill, come on and do it again
Youï¿½ll make it real, the only question is when.

Your death ï¿½ itï¿½s inevitable
Your brain ï¿½ itï¿½s inedible

If I were to look inside your head
For conviction or truth
Iï¿½d come back empty-handed
Save for one rotten wisdom tooth
And if I looked into your heart
For peace or enlightenment
Iï¿½d find a wicked history
That not even I could prevent.

Do you want your life back?
Do you want to live?
