[Pete Altieri]

A cry sounds out as millions follow
The cry of a trumpet, a prelude to war
Some to the sky, some to the water
The mass it grows larger and larger

Come on children from the underground surface
Each bearing a mark on your breast
Follow in your masterï¿½s footsteps
Wage a war against all blessed

As their masses grow, the battle draws near
Thunder and rain doth descend
War spawned in the seeds of fear
Each with a life to defend

Two Powers collide as the world stops
The outcome my son is the end
The battle is done, and no one has one
Darkness visible.
