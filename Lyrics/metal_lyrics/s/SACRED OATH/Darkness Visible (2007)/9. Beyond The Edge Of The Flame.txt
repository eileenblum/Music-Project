[Rob Thorne]

The sun is fire
The moon is ice
And blood is offered
As a sacrifice

A spell is woven
A trance is broken
A man has spoken
The words

The season turns cold
The spirit grows old
And the pain becomes too much
To bear alone

Night has fallen
Smoke will rise
The flame is calling you
Home

I canï¿½t remember
my dreams anymore
But the nightmare rages on
Rages on

And every hour
Is filled with regret
Of when I reached out
Beyond the edge of the flame
