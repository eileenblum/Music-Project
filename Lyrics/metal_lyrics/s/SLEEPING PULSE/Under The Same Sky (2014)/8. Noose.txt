Buried guilt like a child
Keeping your secrets from gluing
and you were taught what was right but you just looked right through it

And the murder of kids you refused to condemn
Did I really hear that well?
How long you expect to elude the karma kill?

Is that a noose around your neck?
You're already gone you just don't believe it

How long till the sediment is pulling under the waves?
How long will the shadows hide a sordid refugee?

When the food that you serve sticks in God's throat
with sick tenacity
only a fool would believe that sin remains unseen

In heart, in mind, the devastation lurks
look hard and you'll find
The universe in motion
