Backfire, with a smoking gun
And the mask falls off for everyone to see

Backfire, and the coup is done
Pull the needle out, its time to run from me

But donât let the truth get high
Thereâs a new stage and a world of lies to breathe

Its all jaded
When the whole world is a mark
Play it fierce, its not real

Backfire, and the coverâs blown
What was once arcane lies now exposed

Backfire, and the bird has flown
As the crude disguise is overthrown by greed

But donât let the truth get high
Thereâs a new stage and a world of lies to breathe

Its all wasted
All those years kissing head
Its all gone, back to start

Donât let the truth get too high
Build a brand new reality
Donât let true colours stain those eyes
No, just pretend that itâs not real

Itâs not real â¦. Itâs not real â¦. Itâs not real â¦. Itâs not real
