A puppet hears from the stage
The audience applause for the puppeteersâ display
But the marionette believes itâs for she
"Iâll perform by myself" she thought, and petulantly cut her strings

I am the one who picked you up from your cold wooden sleep
I am the one who brought you life graceful
When you thought that you could dance alone you turned and savaged me
But without my hand you fall back down,
Puppet fall back down

Itâs painful to drop so low
When not so long before she thought sheâd stole the show
Now she lies in wait
Ready to reach and haul herself back up on the cocks of other puppeteers
