A parasite needs a host
So chase every lead for every lead could be
The path to someone new
A parasite needs a host

A monkey swings from rope to rope
And monkey has no opinion
Just repeats the last opinion that was spoke
A monkey swings from rope to rope

Chasing the end forever
Tied to the aim

How could it be that we're so doped?
Denied of common sense
How can't we feel when were in the choke?
Anaesthetised to the constant feeding
Chase it, chase it
