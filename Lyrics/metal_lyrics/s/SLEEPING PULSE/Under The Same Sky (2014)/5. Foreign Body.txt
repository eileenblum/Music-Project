In search of open doors it slides from man to man
With its infected hole, it siphons all it can

Thief, Liar, Whore, Freak
Two-Faced, Infected, Leech

I have spat you from this tainted heart
Recognize you for just what you are
Herein this prose there lieth how despised is your creed
In the scene that you sucked for
I recognise you for just what are

Corpus alienum
For years it hid and devoured
Til toxic animus
My system pushed it out

When the Earth and Sun collide
Change can never be denied
How its landscape lies we'll never understand...

PAINTED RUST
Faith. The sanctity of faith
Only serves to alchemize passion into gold
White replicated life
A propensity to imitate all that plays the mark

A face of painted rust
A mask to gain our trust
A fake, a cover up

Lie, serenade, incite.
A falsity to aggregate all that comes too hard
Faked. Calculated bait
It all just serves to captivate, subjugate, control
