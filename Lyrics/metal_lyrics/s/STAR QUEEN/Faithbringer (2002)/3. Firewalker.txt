Somewhere in a mountain oriental,
Where virgin places sacramental
Are forgotten worlds for you and me
We are looking for a fairy,
Speaking with colors of butterflies
And strange pictures of clouds in the sky.
If you find a magic flower -
Analyze its` mystic power.

Red hair as long as your dream -
Firewalker dances naked and sings
Barefoot in the glowing embers.
They are her jealous defenders.
Stretch your hand to touch her skin...
You can`t reach her because of your sin.
If you`re out of your body and fear,
You won`t be burned, you`ll be near
The truth and you`ll see
Real unbelievable dreams.

Dancing firewalker lonely and wild...
Sleeping you hear her voice searching and mild
Sending to you an allusion,
She waits for hearts` fusion.
Ride your horse through distant lands
To hold firewalker in your brave hands.
When you open your eyes in the morning,
She`s gonna warm you up with the dawning.
