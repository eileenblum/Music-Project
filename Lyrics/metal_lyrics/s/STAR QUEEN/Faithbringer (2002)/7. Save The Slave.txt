Every time I look in the mirror
I see our times` hero
as a slave of my ego...

I can travel through the time
from a world to another.
But I can`t find myself
in the reality of others...

Imagine me with phones
running in the streets,
chased by rules
and gaped as a freak...

In dark side of my mind
It comes to rape me !
And strength it`s hard to find -
someone to save me !

So the malice`s growing up
and I`m turning into a beast
till the human in me give up...
Save the slave !
