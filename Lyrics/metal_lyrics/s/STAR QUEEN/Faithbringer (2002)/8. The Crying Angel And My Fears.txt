Hey stranger, my angel !
Eat my heart and blind my eyes
But forgive me
There`s no place for you
in the castle of my dreams...

I can`t look in your eyes -
I`m drowning in their blue...
I can`t straight face to you -
I`m just a dust in your silent pain...

I`m chased away,
I`m a memory,
But is there punishment for me ?
Speak ! Speak to me !
