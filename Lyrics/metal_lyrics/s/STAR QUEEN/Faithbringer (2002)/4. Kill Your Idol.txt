The Symphony of The Human Madness

[The Monologue of My Reality:]
I`m still seeing your skin and blood under my nails.
My reveries` death begins...

[My Reality Meets My Fantasy:]
I`m not afraid ` cause I believe
[and Says:] âMay be...â my reveries and you exist.
But is it fear and shall I live
in my perfect world, so twisted ?

[The Aria of My Fantasy:]
You feel my passion far away and search a mystery in me.
I`m your dream and vision divine.
... together free in the eternity...

[The Pain and the Fury of My Fantasy:]
But where are you /where are you?/
To hold me when I cry, (I cry...)
To kill the monster
And for me, to fight?!

[The Masquerade:]
I don`t need your answer any more!
You could touch my fantasy, so lone
Pervert angel, you - devil in disguise
Kill my memories
born in faults and lies...No!

[My Reality Fuses with My Fantasy to Create My Madness:]
Come you, devil,
feed my own religion or
free me from this pain !
I give my soul ! I`ll pay !
