Break the rules !
Be lord of the night !
Shock the fools !
Take all the light !
Oh, you are right -
It`s nothing but evil.
Are you ready to fight
With my passion - to give all ?

Now, you, priest,
Tell me the truth !
Am I the beast -
My body needs food ?
Show me the sin
When I`m feeling well.
A thrill under my skin -
It`s cool down in hell !

[Chorus:]
So we gonna sing -
Dance with devil in the spring !
No distance in this seasonâ¦
Tear me with your sting !
Don`t think ! No reason.

So frightened and angry,
Forget now the sins.
The witch`s teased and hungry.
Satisfy her dreams.
Take off the mask, I can see
Her in your arms and say proudly -
My body and soul are in harmony !
Rock me and shout, honey, louder !

[Chorus (x2)]
