Zeus gave order to gods -
mortal woman to be made from clay...
Pandora was her name.
And they had to give her a spell
instead of a human soul...
And the beauty must be sly,
to enchant and to entice...
To punish people, Zeus sent her,
for the fire they had stolen from Olymp.
High price they had to pay
for the boldness of Prometheus.

[Chorus:]
And all the oceans in the universe
won`t be enough to put out the holy
fiery Prometheus` sacrifice.
Hate your chimerical hopes!
Let be holy your souls!

She went to his brother
but he`d forgotten Prometheus` advice -
don`t take presents from gods.
So Epimetheus could not endure
Pandoras` mystical allure.
She brought an urn with evils
unknown for mortals until then.
And all disasters spread out when
Pandoras` curiosity prevailed.

[Chorus]

And all the sorrows
conquered the human world.
But scared she closed the urn
and the nastiest evil couldn`t creep.
So explain me how the hope
as the most dangerous of evils
corrodes the human souls ?!
I said - the great wisdom of the faith
will make your dreams eternal.

[Chorus]
