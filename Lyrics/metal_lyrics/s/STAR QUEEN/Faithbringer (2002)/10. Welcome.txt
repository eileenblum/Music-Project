Be welcome knight, so brave
In my temple, in my cave.
You`re alive and passed through
The ancient path of the Moon.
Look for glory and treasures -
You`ve got `em both and the pleasure -
To be my dear guest tonight,
Taking up the challenge to fight
With the last dragon in you.
If you win, I`ll tell you the true
Story of your gentle soul -
Why you meet me, why you fall
In love with my rainbow eyes.
Are you ready to pay the price?

[Instrumental]

Tell me your misty dreams,
Talk about your shame and your sins.
Drink from my magic wine,
Relax in my whisper, so fine...
My tears will wash your pain away
And you will wish forever to stay.
I know you will be gone tomorrow
And the wisdom you will follow
`Cause with endless love I bless
Your power and you`ll be the best.
Sleep well and sing this song
When deep inside you - something is wrong.
Come back again to me
When you are ready to be free...
