Look at me - I`m the rising moon !
Now is the time to deliver from your doom.
You are not helpless bystander
`cause the key is - âNever surrender !â
poison your dark intentions with my scent
and your guardian angel will be sent.
Dreamer, you must have been told
what is out of their hunger for gold.

[Refrain:]
I`m the faithbringer !
Your dream - I will sing her !
Set the planets in order
To divine spirits - you`re closer
After burn doubts and fears
Mix their ash with your tears...
Are you hearing the bell ?
You wish cast a spell.

You told me you saw trolls and vampires.
All around you - there are evil empires.
Frogs you are eating for saving from hell.
But malice is hidden behind the mystical bell.
Revenge is verging towards compassion.
Clear your mind in ominous confession.
The dark chaos disappears in the gleeds.
And justice for you - like invisible heat.

[Refrain]

Fiery heart`s beating in flames.
Blood is torturing your veins.
Cold water`s throwing your skin over.
But candle`s burning in rain.
The ground is opening under your feet.
But you can`t fall in.
Air is turning into a storm.
You found out why you are born.

[Refrain]
