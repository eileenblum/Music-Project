Vail of night falls tenderly
Upon my shameless bare spleen
Passion waits your eager touch
Bring me a star - I`ll give so much
More than in your secret dreams
Forgive my fiery, timeless sins
To catch and keep you in my web
Never to feel the pain from now to death

[Refrain:]
I`ll be aside and faraway
From their evil masquerade
I`ll be always lonely there
Waiting for the king to share
What the queen is longing for -
The one who can unlock the door,
To guess the riddle of the queen,
To live in labyrinth of spleen...

To watch how the lace caresses my skin,
Tonight the noblest knight will win,
Whispering poetry in the dark,
Following my shadow in the park...
He`ll see a candle - hint for games
And my lyrics burning in the flames
A bird will bring them in this night
When my eyes will be you light...

[Refrain]
