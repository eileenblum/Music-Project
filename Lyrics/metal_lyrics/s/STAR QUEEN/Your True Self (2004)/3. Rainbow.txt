How, I know, you can build a rainbow.
Tell me, witch, how I can build a rainbow ?
See that girl...
Her smile is like a pearl,
her lips are bloody red,
sensual and drive me mad.
Her hair is black...
...just like a death !
Her eyes - a madness...
Oh ! She is a goddess !
So you have to break her heart
but it will be too hard.
She must fall in love with you
but you don`t make it too...
then leave her and she must be hurt !
She`s gonna cry
because of your lie ...
And the tears will rain,
and the sun will shine
and with the power of her pain
the make up`s gonna fall
and she`ll forever go...
Then you`ll have a rainbow...

[Guitar Solo]

You fell in love with her.
Now it so much hurt.
And the sorrow`s gonna kill
me... I hadn`t feel...
The happiness doesn`t exist.
One thing`s always missed...
