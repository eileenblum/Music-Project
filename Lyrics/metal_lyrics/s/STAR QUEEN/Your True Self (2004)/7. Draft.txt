Time is drawing on my skin
paintings of horror.
I`m just a man to fight with him
even the energy of my sorrow
can`t help me to win.

I envy the time never goes back
that it`s invisible and lives
forever when it`s always dead
and its` pervert profanation
is dwelling in my madness, that is fact.

My loneliness I realizing,
becoming famous face
of times` romantic advertisement
I see all my love is wasted,
waiting for the rainbow rising.

I am kneeling in the mud
as nobody's phantom
on all my reveries` tomb...
