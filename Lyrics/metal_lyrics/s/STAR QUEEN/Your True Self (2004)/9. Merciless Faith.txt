Pulling up to me,
You face again the wall
I can feel it and I see
Your lorn and longing soul...
Only words remain for heat
Instead of a burning fire.
The heart of my lion bleeds
For a distant passionate desire!

[Refrain:]
The road is long...
The king is strong...
This fairy-tale has a happy end -
We both shall climb up hand in hand
To the top of the highest rock
And in the clouds we`ll walk...
But merciless illusion is my faith!
In the golden world - my dream must wait...

Pulling up to you,
I face again the wall
And I can`t break it too
But you`re the one - comfort my soul...
Can you see me watching over ?...
Close your eyes and try to sleep,
In your dream you`ll meet a rover.
It`s my passion and my weep!

[Refrain:]

Magic circle where we are...
There`s no way and exit to go out!?
Burning flame will take our pain!
The ice will melt and I will stray
My memories stricken with my grief...
Give me little piece of your belief!
