How could I think it could be too late
To spread my wings, to see an angel alate
If you wish, we both can fly away
To touch the stars knocking on the Heavens` Gate

[Refrain:]
Crying for an angel
Facing brave the danger
You picked up the crystals
To make me so blissful
My broken dreams will disappear
With my loneliness and my fear
It was broken in a million of parts
Do you - master want to take my heart

You lightened me there inner at one fling
You said those words I`ve always wish to sing
You found the magic key - I took the hint
When the night comes down, in my bed you`ll slink
