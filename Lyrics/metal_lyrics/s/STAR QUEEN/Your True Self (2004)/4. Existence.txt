Even my shadow
Has been gone
Let it run out
What I`ve done
So many questions
I shouldn`t ask
There is no face
Behind the mask

[Refrain:]
Time now is sleeping
Crime now is creeping
Calling to me
Coming to be
Piece of mind
Eyes of blind

The clock now is broken
Freedom fills all my soul
The words are already spoken
I don`t need a home
You want all or nothing
Anything`s not enough
Why are you losing
Why are you losing
All that you`ve got

[Refrain]

Finding the answers
Is always hard
Losing your temper
It happens fast
Never stood quite
Lived on the run
It was for the lost cause
All that you`ve done
A - a - ah ...
