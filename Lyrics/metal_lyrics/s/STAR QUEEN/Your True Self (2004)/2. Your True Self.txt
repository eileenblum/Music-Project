Call them for advice,
for salvation from your vice.
And subconscious filled with fears
till you see the queen of the spears.
She`s looking for the knight of the chalice
beyond the envious people` malice.

[Refrain:]
Angel`s compelling me to bend!
Chorus of angels: "Tell him!...you won`t offend
the honor of your dream -
sign of spirit, so supreme,
so supreme!"

Bind all the demons splendid!
Find the way to defend it -
heart wavering misled
in sliding reverie to death
of reincarnated truth
and revival of his youth.

[Refrain]

I`m an angel and you`re me!
Feel the spell, the melody
are carrying on the new
faith and light for you!
