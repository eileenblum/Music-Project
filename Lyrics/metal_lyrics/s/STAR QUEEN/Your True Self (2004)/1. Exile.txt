Sometimes I`m so tired
to be right and to get higher
over faults and troubles.
When all the things are double,
how to have a full control,
wondering which way to go.

I ventured to get loose
even it`s possible to lose
all I`ve got and love.
But there`s a heaven above
the iron of my mighty will.
I`m stronger than the pain I feel.

Fantasy and nothing at all.
No help and signs to show,
to save me from being in two minds -
may I reach you or I`m blind
to see the real picture of my life
and the profit of my cry.

Deep traces of my own decision
build the beauty of this vision.
It remains of you and me
in past life. Be born again to see
this empty room and smile
to defeat the loneliness of your exile.
