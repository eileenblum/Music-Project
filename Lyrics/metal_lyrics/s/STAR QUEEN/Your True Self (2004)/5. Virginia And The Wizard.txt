Majestic voice and vision...
Years of tears and oblivion...
Saved the lonely soul of
The princess as a ghost...
Innocence of rising dream
Calling wizard. What does it mean?
All the signs are ordered when
Living next time, may be then...

Falling broken figures
Out of space. He`s coming as a beggar
Return again into a heat...
Circles around her. It beats - her
Enchanted heart and leads her
Out of the darkest psycho hell
For search the matter in his spell

Dawn of passions rises wisdom
And her fantasy has mighty kingdom.
Riding fire queen Virginia...
King of mystery is her chasing mania
Miracle she`s waiting for,
In dreams wants more and more...
No secrets for the wizards` eyes -
Dissembled feelings, noble lies...

Falling broken figures
Out of space. He`s coming as a beggar
Return again into a heat...
Circles around her. It beats - her
Enchanted heart and leads her
Out of the darkest psycho hell
For search the matter in his spell.

Fast as lighting, you
Read this story with no
End. You`ll be amazed
Eternally hungry friend.
Do you believe - Virginia the queen
Of queens and the wizard they are
Me, because I`m absolutely free ?

( Are you free like me?... )
