Whenever I gaze
in the deep dark of your eyes
our sorrow I can face
as a wall between the crowd and
our tears frozen.
Don`t you feel yourselves alive
and close to me
when your pain I wanna share
and your despair ?
The souls weÂ´ll give into the dark
Will the apathy fall apart?...

[The Speech:]
Mankind ! So pitiful you,...
gave birth to my malice !
You told me grinning -
my holy dreams are children
of illness and illusions...
But you`ll scream for mercy -
punished for the oblivion
and your spiteful bliss
we will change with fear
and we`ll create our world
made of dreams...

All gods with lack of understanding
call the power of our hate !
She`s a witch beautiful and mighty
more than Love and Death.
As a ghost of our malice
she will range the human souls !
It will unify in revelation silent
the aggression and despair.
