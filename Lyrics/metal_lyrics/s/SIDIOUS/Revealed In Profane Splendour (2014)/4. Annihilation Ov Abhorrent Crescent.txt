Awake from induced stupor
Lift up thy mind and behold
As the earth shakes, structures crumble
Under shrill roar

Under shrill roar ov South

Awake! Be reborn ablaze
One immortal endless magnate
As heedless drones meet their fate
Our kin shall revel!

Under shrill roar ov South

We are conceived with the impulse to reason

We are conceived with the impulse
To reason, fend and cultivate the self
Yet the massese were conned
You have all been conned

Reborn once more are forlorn senses
Prying open the eye so blind
To bind the risible tongue ov script
Under shrill roar ov South

Awake! Be reborn ablaze
One immortal endless magnate
As heedless drones meet their fate
Our kin shall revel!

Reborn once more is primal nature
Reclaiming a once forlorn legacy
Reborn once more are forlorn senses
Withdrawn from all denounced fallacy

Behold our righteous crown
Coronation ov the South
Oru kin shall revel
Our legacy discerned

Pry open the blind eye
Bound be the mouth
That speweth untruths
