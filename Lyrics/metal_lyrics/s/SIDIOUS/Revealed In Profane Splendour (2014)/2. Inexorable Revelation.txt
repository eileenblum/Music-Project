Behold! Pathetic flock
Those blind to essence ov nature
O fallen from upmost grace

Primal nature!

An inconvenient truth for those heedless
Rash actions meet repercussion
As ashen eyes discern their fate

Law ov nature will be sated
Masses no longer suspended in disbelief
And blind to primal purpose
As ashen eyes discern their fate

Law ov nature will be sated
Masses no longer suspended

Who may contend with such majesty?
And attempt to cull the enhancement ov man!
As ashen eyes discern their fate

Primal nature~

Distorted beliefs create false reality
Deny thy triumph bold
A lie so oft told, it deemed truth..
Conceive spineless drones
Desecrate our domain
Yet aloft descent ov shame
I remain!
