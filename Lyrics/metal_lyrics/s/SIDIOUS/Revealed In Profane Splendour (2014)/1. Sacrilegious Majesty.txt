Callowness ov cursed life form
Psychosis o'er ill-fated race
Hellacious eruption!
Vivify! I see no wonders
Thraldom ov scripts' ancient leash
Evanscent distortion

Ablaze in the midst of their temple
I rear at visions ov ignorance
Deceived and divided
I see no wonders

Unto the Earth they vomit forth
Their lies so oft told
Lead by leash ov old

And we will redefine as grace ov God
Great storms surround as light
Is revealed with profane might

Callowness ov cursed life form
Psychosis o'er ill-fated race

I see no wonders ov old
Nor prophecy fulfilled
It's hollow!

They may demand repentance
Refute the might of I
Yet aloft gnarled knee resides
Truth that bows to none

Behold the coronation!
Splendor ov Mighty South
