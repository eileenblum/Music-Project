Awake Legions ov South
Unleash aeon ov merciless wrath
Be revealed in profane splendor
Lead by leash of old
Uncrowned in mass divide
Flock ov ever dimming light

Kneel before none
Become Grace ov God

[solo: Isfeth]

Ablaze! So long anguish leered
A bastard lie conceived by greed

Succumb to call ov primal aeon
O succumb! Kneel before none!
Be revealed in profane splendor
Lead by leash of old
Uncrowned in mass divide
Flock ov ever dimming light

Alas you consumed baseless lies
Lead by leash ov old
Uncrowned in mass divide
O pathetic, writhing masses
You are all spineless
Scorned and shamed

From thy eyes run tears ov blood
As pages ov untruth are scattered
Line by line you cease to exist
Toward aeon ov natural reign
Scorned as one, you'll writhe in shame
As truth bears no mercy, nor for your kind
For in thee such ceased to exist
Shame eternal

Awake Legions ov South
Unleash aeon ov merciless wrath
Be revealed in profane splendor
Anointed one thy will be done
Euphoric realm ne'er devoid
Free will! Adversary!

O pathetic, writhing masses
Spineless, scorned and shamed
Aloft I have always been
Lead by leash of old
Uncrowned in mass divide
Flock ov ever dimming light
Shame
