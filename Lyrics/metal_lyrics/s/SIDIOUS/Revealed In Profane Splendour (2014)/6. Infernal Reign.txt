Ne'er devoid!
Legacy discerned
Man ignites
As plated structures crumble
We take our place
On the throne carved
By utmost will

Ignite!

Conceived ov truth
I bow to none
And by upmost will
Ignite the sun

Emobdied! Infernal deity
In accordance with the hightest will
Law ov nature!
Faith extinct within

Conceived ov truth
I bow to none
And by upmost will
Ignite the sun

Cruelly 'God' is reduced to ash
The infernal day ov man ignites

Conceived ov truth
I bow to none
And by upmost will
Ignite the sun

Sedated by insatiable greed
A race unto them bathed in ignorance
Devoid ov truth
The flock adhered to their calling
Grossly manipulated

O conceived ov truth
I bow to none
And by upmost will
Ignite the sun
