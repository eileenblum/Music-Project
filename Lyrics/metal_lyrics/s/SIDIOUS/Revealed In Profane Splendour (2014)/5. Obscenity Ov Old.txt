I witnessed artifice! Obscenity ov old
Vomit unto the masses
And build high their temples ov gold

As man lost touch with instinct
He lost touch with what we are
Denying the glory ov majesty owed to us

As man lost touch with instinct
He embraced the upmost lie
Denying the triumph ov coronation nigh

Devotions held, repetitions ov old
Reducing the self to infancy ov intellect

I witnessed artifice! Obscenity ov old
Vomit unto the masses
And build high their temples ov gold
In the name ov plated gods
In the name ov faux gods

As man lost touch with instinct
He lost touch with what we are
The towers climbed as the flock adhered
Conned from legacy heedless!

I witnessed artifice! Obscenity ov old
Vomit unto the masses
And build high their temples ov gold
In the name ov plated gods
In the name ov faux gods
