I'm in the time of the smile
I feel the sun in heaven
A light breeze makes me smooth
And the fast moment...

(Majestic celebration)
Of and endless night
(Beautiful night adorned)
By a fallen sunrise.

(Who give the moon to the soul?
Who spells the ocean
Showing his secrets
Sorrowful to the silence of pain!).

(Majestic night eternalized by tears)
(His end is wait 'cause!)
There is no end
(Is to forget 'cause!)
There is no sun...!!

(Majestic night eternalized by tears!)
Oh night, (oh majestic night!)
I'm yours, (I'm yours!!)...

Oh night, (oh majestic night!)
I'm yours, (I'm yours!!).
