Shaking lost voices for my dark soul!.

Echoes for delirium
Blow in between the winds
In all four sad corners
Where the shadows come.

The great music invites me
Chorus of cloudy cults.

Ethereal symphony
Like a lethal opium
Suits my agony
Glacial Poem.

(Mystical reality
A thin vital blow
The cold fills the life
I an endless dive).

My heart's slowly troubles
In storms of sorrow.

Sleep walking
Through clouds of snow
Of moons and fog
Beyond my eyes
With poems and symphonies...
With poems and symphonies... symphonies.

Ethereal symphony
Like a lethal opium
Suits my agony
Glacial Poem.
