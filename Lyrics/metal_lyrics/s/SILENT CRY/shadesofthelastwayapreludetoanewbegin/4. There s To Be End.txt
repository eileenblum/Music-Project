A short and deep sigh is a life
A dirty page to loose
The poets smile and say good bye
Of your compassion and currents.

The lovers cry and remember
The flowers of old spring time
Falling all in the cold sleep
In the abyss of mistery.

Don't cry sweet child
Don't be afraid that pain
Since the deep one
There's to be end
There's to be end
There's to be end, to be end

The lovers cry and remember
The flowers of old spring time
Falling all in the cold sleep
In the abyss of mistery...

All in your far way
Marching to the someplace.

The light will turn slowly
Maybe rest whispers
Closed in the darkness
...In the darkness.

Don't cry sweet child
Don't be afraid that pain
Since the deep one
Oh there's to be end
There's to be end.
