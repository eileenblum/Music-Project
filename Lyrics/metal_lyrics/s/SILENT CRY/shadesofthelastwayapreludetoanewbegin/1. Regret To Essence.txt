Night fall dressed in black
Tears and torments are spillin' from sky
Upon the land of sin
Thunder explode the silence dawn!.

(From the land of the white dreams
With brutality take o' my soul)
(Setting free my memory
Scenes of an old moment!).

Falling down as an angel without wings I return to begin
Through the wall that apart of innocence
Washin' the begin of the way to the end...

(The stage of dramas and puppets it's opened
Is this life? or sarcastic delirium
Of crazy goodness drifting forever
Sowing their monster and creations!).

(Now the white pages will be stain
For the impure blood...
...And from the blood
Will stand the lines of affliction
Like parts of sad poem).

(The innocence is braking
And his pieces falling slowly
As dead leaves in autumn).
