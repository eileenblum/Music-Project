[Lyrics: Seully Ribeiro, Music: Silent Cry]

I hear the wind whisper a sweet serenade
That makes me find long roads
Between fantasies and desires
Supreme suffering, simple love...
The sun and the moon meet for an instant
THey are lovers
Universe, the looking!!!
Eternal in the winter, dying autumn
So much feeling, so much forgetfulness
Supreme suffering, simple love...
The sun and the moon meet for an instant
THey are lovers
Pleasure abysses
Separated days, charming and despised 
That will never become eternal.
Between fantasis and desires...
