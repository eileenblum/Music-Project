[Lyrics: Bruno Selmer, Music: Silent Cry]

Between two worlds
Crooked roads
Reality see to turn off

Lost in the walls
I won't close my eyes
To your wait I will be

Dreams in my mind
Until the end of the memory
Between two worlds
lost blind
To the end it does drive me?...
The light, stars will die 
Of my distant hands
If you don't live
Dreams in my mind
Until the end of the memory
I wish its lines
I wish you as poetry
I won't close my eyes
I will be your words
Don't forget me in the darkness
I only wish
I waited as poetry 
You no longer it is
