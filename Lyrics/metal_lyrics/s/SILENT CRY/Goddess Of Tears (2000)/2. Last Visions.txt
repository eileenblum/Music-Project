[Lyrics: Suelly Ribeiro, Music: Silent Cry]

Through his eyes
I could escape from myself
Please, can you help me?
In the infinite
in my soul... so lonely
I feel his silence
In serene harmony 
my soul burns
Let me touch you, let to hear you.
Let me dream in memory of this enigma.
Let me remember forever
His absence makes me feel
the wind screams of pain
And the sadness of traveled roads
in oceans of hope.
A vision... the last desire
in my heart.
