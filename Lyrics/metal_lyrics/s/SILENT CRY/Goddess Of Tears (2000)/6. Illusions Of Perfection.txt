[Lyrics: Bruno Selmer, Music: Slient Cry]

Failing down is your heart
Above the ruins of the thougths
Trying to go in the uncertainty
Your dogma suffers in the shades
Condemned in the illusions of the perfection
Your sickness true
In tears, drowned
Holding for pain 
Forging a smile
Come as flower
Beyond the nightmares
With the awake of the sun
In ground of thorns
Returning to the Eden as delirium
Beyond the worry's walls

Returning to the dust of the essence
The crosses of the memory
Come as flower
To the gate of your way
failing down
In the shades of your past
Your sickness true
In tears, drowned
Holding for pain
forging the paradise
