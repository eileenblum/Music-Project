[Lyrics: Bruno Selmer, Music: Silent Cry]

Don't come
Don't bring me deliriums
Don't extend its hands
Empty promises deceive its days
With promises, don't come to guide me
Desillusions waits you
In the end will find
No, don't come
Don't contain my tears
Let me, let me go without pledges
Desillusions waits you
In the end will find
Don't come to deceive himself
Desillusions waits you
In the end will find
Illusions guides you
In the end she will come...
...until you!!!
