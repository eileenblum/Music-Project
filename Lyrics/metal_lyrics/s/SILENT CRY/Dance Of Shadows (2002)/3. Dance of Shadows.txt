[Lyrics: Tandrey]
[Music: Albenez Carvalho / Ana Mï¿½rcia]

I am alone
Surrounded by moving shadows
I see the night
I feel the dark
And I listen the wind sing a sad song
Your sweet voice
Bring all my fears back

And I feel the taste the sweet
The tears choking my throat
The song become to the end
A dance of shadows
Don't stop no more

The day has come
Light takes the shadows away
My body's rest
In a deep never-ending sleep
Wating for another night
It won't late to come
