[Lyrics: Tandrey]
[Music: Dilpho Castro]

Thunders and lightning across the sky
Screaming and laughs I heard all the time
Flashes and bombs are hitting the ground
Even so far you can listen the sound

Mountains are shaking, flesh is in fire
Children are crying, tied in a wire
People are missing, between light dark
Some people are building, some falling apart

Cause rwo worlds colliding
The sky and the ground
Some people are riunning
Some killing his proud

Faces with fear, faces of death
Eyes full of tears, tears of remains
Bodies are falling, earth is in flames
Brothers are fighting, the world is insane

Troops are ridding strait to the thumb
A cloud of smoke it's make me numb
Anger it's growing in the heart of the men
My soul it's burning, my body is rotten
