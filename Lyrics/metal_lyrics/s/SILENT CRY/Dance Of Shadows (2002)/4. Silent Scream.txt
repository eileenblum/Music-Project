[Lyrics: Ana Mï¿½rcia]
[Music: Roberto Freitas / Dilpho Castro]

In a cold night without  knowing how it
would be
It happens the most beautyful union
supreme alliance
My future would be traced by the gods
And my life, a tale of glories

I know that the passion became my flesh
And the nature was uncharged of perfection
The most beautiful stars from heaven
Would guide me forever

Even being involved by a world so small
I put all my love and trust right there
Even trough the turbulence that gives the flesh
I'd never be abandoned by the holy protection

But in that autumn afternoon
They decided tu stop my dreams
As a comet trespassing my fortress
Making everything spins as a twister

I tried to escape but I couldn't hide I was trapped
No one could hear me cry 'cause it was silent
No one could hear my scream 'cause it was too low
At last they didn't give me chance to born

There is no regret, because there is no way back
There is no hope, because the dream is over
But I forgive those chosen to blow my life
Because I know the weren't light, cause they were in the darkness
