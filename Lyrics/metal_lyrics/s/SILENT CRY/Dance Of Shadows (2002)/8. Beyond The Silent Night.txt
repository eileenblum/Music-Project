[Lyrics: Rosa Leite]
[Music: Albenez Carvalho]

I know that I steel keep dreaming
With what I was and what I would be
If your road crossed with mine
In the night, penumbra or day light

I would fly around the world with whisperind winds
Come across the most wrong roads with you
I would travel years and years with the fallen stars
And bring to you all the incandescent dreams I live

I would be free, I would be loved
I wouldn't bring murmured songs in my pocket
I would run just like the river to the storm
But I'd be beyond the silent night

I wouldn't pass across the life in white clouds
Or sleeping in a placid rest
I wouldn't be a spectrum of life or even a small one
Beyond the space and the soul I would exist
