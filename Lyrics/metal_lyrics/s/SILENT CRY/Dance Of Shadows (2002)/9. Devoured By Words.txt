[Lyrics: Ana Mï¿½rcia]
[Music: Dilpho Castro &amp; Albenez Carvalho]

The words are devouring me
The same words that one day consoled me
I feel so all alone, afraid of everybody
So I down myself in nightmare

I'm alredy so tired
I dont want to be silent

I desire To escape every night
But my shelter is your empty eyes
So I turn to the sky and claim to the moon
Because it is the one who keep my secrets

But finally,
With strenght of one thousand suns
I crush my pain hurt by thorns
I get myself around the light to start over
But the words just dont stop
Shouting in my ears

I say good bye to the word
I say good bye to the silence
But I count the words
The same ones that devoured me
