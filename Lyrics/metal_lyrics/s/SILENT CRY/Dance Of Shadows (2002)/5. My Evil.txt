[Lyrics: Ana Mï¿½rcia]
[Music: Dilpho Castro]

I can't understand
The good that I do to you is my evil
I forge a smile to make you smile
I make you happy to hide my cry

I can't understand
Cause in my weeping lies
Your pleasant smile

I was your slave while I was tied
But now I figure out my strength
I'll laugh to see you cry
Fey to the stars to the humble you

How can I accept
To be attached to your wishes
And due to the vanity
Remain by your side
