[Music - Albenez Carvalho, Lyrics - Dilpho Castro, Arrangements - Silent Cry]

The Wind Brings constant shivering
I'm afraid of the future ahead of me
But tonight winds persist instant after instant
The moon irradiates the light's prettiest picture
I can no longer smile in front of such splendor
Such an astonishing and yet catatonic beauty
I shall wait out the persistence winds
I contemplate a magical moment, but I don't comprehend
It wont be easy to have this encounter be whole and beautiful
The main memory is in the darkness core
I feel strange in this mix of feelings
Maybe for I see my body laid
