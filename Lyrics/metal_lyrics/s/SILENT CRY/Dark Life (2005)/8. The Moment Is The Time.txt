[Music - Roberto Freitas, Lyrics - Dilpho Castro / Henrrique Gobbi, Arrangements - Silent Cry]

For long time in mind, I remember
Blood and battles, reflex of devastation
Have been tormenting me eternally
With anguish and sorrow

That awakes my thirst of revenge
Because the pain still hurts
Because the past still is present
The moment is the time
This warrior regret
And awakes the thirst of revenge
Still present in his chest
The moment is the time
Rise your sword and fight until the end
In this poor and disgraced land
My tears turns to blood
This bitter feeling moves my anger
