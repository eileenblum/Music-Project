[Music - Albenez Carvalho, Lyrics - Dilpho Castro / Sandra FÃ©lix, Arrangements - Silent Cry]

I'm feeling suffocated
The anguish burns me
I want to find the exit
But in each attempt I fall in the emptiness
I realize that I am stuck inside of myself
The light seems distant and blurred
I won't be quiet, this time I need to free my self
The hope no longer belongs to me
I will stay closed in the prison of the uncertainties
It's like a dream that never ends
I can't reach the exit
The gates are closed I can't see the hope
The screams are in vain
