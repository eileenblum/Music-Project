[Music - Albenez Carvalho, Lyrics - Dilpho Castro, Arrangements - Silent Cry]

Feel the contagious energy's force
That takes us in its contaminating rhythm
You're pale and cold, have some wine and renew yourself
Slow movements follow an enchanting symphony
And the souls dance, hypnotized by the darkness
There's nothing left for them but the wine's dance
Everything is possible in the dark room of dead souls
While they kiss, we feel the force that emanates form the energy
Drink the blood of our victims for they're dead
This path has no return, it contagious, move yourself, the wine's dance
This path has no return, it contagious, move yourself
We're like them, there's no return, and we've reached the end.
Taste the blood of our helpless victims
Cry not over life, for it no longer belongs not to us
