[Music - Albenez Carvalho, Lyrics - Jefferson Brito, Arrangements - Silent Cry]

She lies so cold, as cold as the night
Her hair so soft, as soft is the cold breeze
In her sleep, I know not where she flies
In her sleep, she drifts like the clouds, serenade and cry

The serenity in the last words
The uncertainty in the last kiss
The pain inside, that makes me burn
The grieving thoughts of an endless night
The promises of undying love
The silent screams in our last goodbye
Rest now my angel
For the night is falling
Together we cried
And that when the music silences
The sweet sound of your voice
Bringing me back from eye of the storm
Drying the tears I could no longer hide
