[Music - Albenez Carvalho, Lyrics - Sandra FÃ©lix, Arrangements - Silent Cry]

Flying to the sky she walks on thin air
Trying to realize why we can't see
What is hidden in the stars
With her calm and quiet ways
She dances the happiness
But what she really brings inside
Is the sadness

So she wants to be free and completely ethereal
We can't feel her, but she can feels the
Presence of everything
Belonging to everything
She can feel when the soul breaks free
And delivers itself to the scent of the win,
The colors, the flowers.
But even if invisible
She leaves her trace in an indelible way,
Occupying every place
Leaving the rare sensation
That something inexplicable and
Enigmatic happens to those who
Comes across her path...
