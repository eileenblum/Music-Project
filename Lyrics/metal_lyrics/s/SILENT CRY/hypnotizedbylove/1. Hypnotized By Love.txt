I cannot authorize this end,
Our minds were lost,
And I could not say goodbye,
I feel trapped,
Wandering alone, injustice hurts

Emptiness, suffering, solitude, where am I?

Fading away, breathing in vain, oh where am I?

Now your mind is turned off in your cold body,
Wasted and dead,
Fertilizer for gardens,
Without the pleasure of your presence,
What is left is the memories of our time

Can you see the way?
Can you see it? I canât wait
