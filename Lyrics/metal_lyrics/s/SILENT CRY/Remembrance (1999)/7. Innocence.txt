Days and nights, 
fleering for distant of himself
Days and nights, 
fearing what can find
The future is uncertain,
only a certainty.

She waits you 
Then break the currents
The current of the innocence.

Days and nights,
trying to deceive himself
Days and nights,
fearing the death and scaping from the life
The future is uncertain,
only a certainty.
