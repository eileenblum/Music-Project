Souls that bloom all of my being
and shines as it pours out
my remembrance.

Supreme silence
Listening to the swans 
songs,
in a deep sleep Into within I long to dream,
every night.

By the moonlight that reflects, deep inside
of me
all of magestic agony, that moves me.

I lose myself inside its eyes
sweet tears
Oh, sadness spread upon
me.

The sprout of poems
that speak of you.
