I remember the moon in the sky throwing it's sorceries
I remember sweet kisses taking me in perdition
TRAGIC MEMORY LIRICS

I remember sad songs heating up my decadent soul.

Distant roadswithout a destinationI wandered
Torments tried to bury
For distant roads relief, sought
Intense pain, I tried to cure.

I remember dead flowers beautiful as
the sun
I remember screams to the infinite beggining for
answer
I remember tears dropping on the face in silence.

Prostrated to the ground of lamentations
I spilled my suffering,
I cultivated my rancor
Prostrated to the ground of the lamentation
to the life I renounce myself to the death 
I surrender.
