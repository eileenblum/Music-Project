It arrives the night
Deep as desolation abyss
I look for the pale moon,
Eternal slave of lamentation.

Soft breeze whisper
A dismal song 
Temptress, 
the death appoaches,
It extends the handIt
invites me to dance,

Sweet voice
Promice that everuthing will end
The death invites to dance.

Through the deep night,
Soft breeze drives me
Through the melody
That seduce me.

Until her arms,
Drives me to dance.
