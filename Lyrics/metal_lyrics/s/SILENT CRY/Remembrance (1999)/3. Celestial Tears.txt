In your silent fields I feed sad
I see a rose bud
Bloom as your pass by
Within the singing of dew waters.

Your presence rules over me
Oh, sweet sadness
What did you to me?
How sorrow full I feel
As I see you witness.

I see roses dropping on my soul
Perfect paradise where enchants me
Celestial tears 
Winds that blow
Celestial tears over my memories.

I sense the sweet scent
Of flowers that live inside of me
Bitter dream
Ofan endless sorrow...I sense the
sweet scent
Of flowers that live inside of me.
