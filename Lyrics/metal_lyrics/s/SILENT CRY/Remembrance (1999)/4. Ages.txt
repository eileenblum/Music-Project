Path one crossed of pains and ilusions
Morning of dark
of dark dawn
In the night of tomorrow.

The wind that blows outside
Blous inside me
Clouds are like a veilIn
sublime magic.

With the air that
inspiresIn flight of eagles
A thunder comes
Announcing the arrival
of a new age
Should last until the fall of dawning

Path one crossed of pains and ilusions
Morning of dark
of dark dawn.
In the night of tomorrow.

In the distance of the vastness
I discovered a new being
A being from tomorrow
The being from tomorrow.
