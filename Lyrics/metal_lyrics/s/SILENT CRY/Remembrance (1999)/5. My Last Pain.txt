I hear playing bells, 
bells that anounced
I hear the echo of laughters,
that no longer they exist.

How many moons and suns,
already rested
So much moons and suns,
and I cannot forget.

I want the death now, 
to suffer doesnât support more
I want now, 
her that brought me the pain.

A lot of moons and suns 
already rested
And now 
I surrender due forever.
