I am going there, Into your shrine..
I'll dig your grave, And make you mine..

Prophet Muhammad, I'll exhume you...

For the deed of Oath..
For the deed of Hate..

With your corroded skeleton
I'll rape your corpse with grudge
I'll let your endless lust melt your stinky remains..

with all the people you killed by faith
I carry this will For centuries
To profane your sacraments..

Sex...With Prophet Muhammad's Corpse

I am going there, Into your shrine..
I'll dig your grave, And make you mine..
