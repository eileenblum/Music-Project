Imagine the world...without lies
Think about it...with no Islam
Imagine the life..without Quran
Imagine the world..without mosques
Imagine the streets..without Muslims
Imagine the world..without lies

Someday we'll make a war against the religious people
And we will win ..
Purifying our homeland ...
from the lies that we've been told
Purifying our homeland..

Someday we'll make a war..
against the religious people
And we will win ..And we will win ..
Purifying our homeland..
Purifying our homeland

Purifying our homeland
