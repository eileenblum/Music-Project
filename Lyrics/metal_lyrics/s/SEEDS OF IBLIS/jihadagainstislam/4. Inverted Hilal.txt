Take this Sora...And Invert the Hilal
Iblis will never be an enemy

Take this hadeeth..and Invert the Hilal
Shaitan will never harm you
Take this Aya...And Invert the Hilal
Seeds of Iblis welcome you..

Take this Aya...And Invert the Hilal
Seeds of Iblis welcome you..

The Sacrilege is our art
And Islam must be destroyed
These filthy mosques I will erase
These stupid books must be burnt

The Sacrilege is our religion
No ugly path will left to follow
Islam is fake..Islam is war
Islam is brutality..

Islam is a killing machine..

Take this hadeeth..and Invert the Hilal
Shaitan will never harm you
Take this Aya...And Invert the Hilal
Seeds of Iblis welcome you..
