As the fajr knocked its doors
The prayers got ready for the prayer
The holy Mecca is the target...
Of these falling missiles

Explosions are everywhere
The body-parts are raining
Declaration of war against Mecca

The flames are moving
Between Al-Madina and Mecca
As the hypocrisy is smoking the mosques
my foot are above the ashes
The ashes of Islam

The pagan shadows are painted blood
Beneath Mohammad's Ideology
The sacred places are full of filth
The black stones are full of menses
Mohammad's fake biography
Is naked and shattered behind the moon

missiles are chanting... Declaration of war
Mecca is the main target... To ease the Islam history
