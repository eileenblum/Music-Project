Islamophobia

I dig my way through the night
Toward the holy shrine
The shovel kissed the ground
And blew up Mohammad's history

Islamophobia
Islamophobia
Islamophobia
Islamophobia

The stinky corpse appeared
The history was under my feet
All what I felt was blasphemy

I poured the kerosene around
And sparked.
I set the history on fire
I set the Islam on fire

I've lightened away the night
Around the holy shrine
The flames licked the holy corpse
And blew up Mohammad's history

Islamophobia
Islamophobia
Islamophobia
Islamophobia

The stinky corpse appeared
The history was under my feet
All what I felt was blasphemy
