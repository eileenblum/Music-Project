In a place beyond earth
Where there are hell and heaven
Allah is waiting the terrorists
Above all universes

The license to homicide the nations
Has been made by the uneducated imam
Pathetic imaginary heaven with fake promises

The thirst of the desert people
Has been used to invade the lands
For the 72 virgins...
They are ready to kill..
Their brothers and fathers

The black skies are raining Quranic flames
Colder than ice under the furnace of delusions
Mohammad is crying blood in his rotten tomb
