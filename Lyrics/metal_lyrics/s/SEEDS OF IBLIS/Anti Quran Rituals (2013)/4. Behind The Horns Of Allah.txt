Behind the horns of Allah
Muhammad and his tribe
Are charging their hearts
With darkness, injustice
Behind the horns of Allah
The bearded are exploding
The innocent, the weak
The children, the old

Behind the horns of Allah
Bearded and covered nation
throwing stones on the poor to death

Behind the horns of Allah
The choirs of hell are calling
Muhammad is the master
Muhammad is the master
Behind the horns of Allah
A wide void of hell and torment
Where Muhammad found is holy book of Quran

Behind the horns of Allah
Bearded and covered nation
throwing stones on the poor to death
