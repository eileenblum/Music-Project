Fight those who believe
not in Allah Nor the Last Day,
Nor hold that forbidden
which hath been forbidden
by Allah and His Messenger nor,
acknowledge the Religion of Truth
from among the People of the Book,
until they pay the Jizyah
with willing submission
and feel themselves subdued.
[Quran, Sura 9 (Al Tawba), Aya 29]

O Prophet! strive hard..
against the Unbelievers, and the Hypocrites,
and be firm against them.
Their abode is Hell? an evil refuge indeed.
[Quran, Sura 9 (Al Tawba), Ayah 73]

If they repent, it will be best for them;
but if they turn back to their evil ways,
Allah will punish them with a grievous penalty
in this life and in the Hereafter,
they shall have none on earth to protect or help them.
[Quran, Sura 9 (Al Tawba), Ayah 74]

ALLAH, GABREIL HAS BEEN SENT BY YOU
TO THE FINAL PROPHET OF RAPE AND WAR
AND NOW YOUR MESSAGE HAS BEEN SENT TO THE WORLD
LET THERE BE WAR... AND WAR STARTED
LET THERE BE RAPE... AND RAPE SPREAD IT
LET THERE BE DEATH... AND THEN YOU CAME
