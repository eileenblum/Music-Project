On the soil of Islam
Muslims slay muslims
To hail the name of Allah
To raise the name of Jihad

The blood of brotherhood is spilled
Under the foot of the believers

In the faith of Islam
Muslims must kill muslims
A dogmatic enigma
And Allah to solve this mystery

When the blood turns to water
When the home turns to a battle
When the blind fight the blind
For the darker sight they see
When the blind fight the blind
For the darker Islam they see
