Bane in our veins
All blood's like tar
Bane in our veins
Oh blood's the way

To bring us there, to take us away
To bring us there, oblivious state
With smoke filled lungs
We dwell in the dark

Why?

Bane in our veins
My blood's like tar
Bane in our veins
Oh blood's the way

To bring me there, to take me away
To bring me there, oblivious state
With open mind
I dwell in the dark

Kingdoms of unconscious states
Tried to bring you back again
Bring you kingdoms
Bring new kingdoms
