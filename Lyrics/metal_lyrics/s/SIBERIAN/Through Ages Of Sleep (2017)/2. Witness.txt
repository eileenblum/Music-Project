She stands at the edge of my bed
Silently holding a paper scroll
These words tell of a revelation
Bringing the worst imaginable truth
Upon us

You will lose the ones dearest to you
But when you close your eyes
You can still be with them
I have witnessed the hypnosis
I have fallen so deep
I can not be awakened

Over and over again
The memories keeps haunting me

There will be no one
Incomparable

Never forget
