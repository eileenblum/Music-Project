He holds out his hands
Wanting me to let go
Years ago
I would not hesitate

I never thought 
You'd be the one to go
I never thought
You'd be the one to carry all this weight

All this weight
Answers to me

I tried to escape
Close every open door
But you'd break through
To offer a way of salvation
From all this weight

Answers

He holds out his hands
Wants me to let go
Won't let go
