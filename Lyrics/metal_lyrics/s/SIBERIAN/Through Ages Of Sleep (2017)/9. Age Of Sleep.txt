When your eyes change color
Hints of grief unveil in your smile
Makes my all a disorder
Forces thoughts round rings of fire
All parts of memories
Takes place combined
To make the moment so real
I could believe you're here with me

Don't wake me up
From this sleep
Just let me keep
This one dream

I will never be able
Able to touch your skin again
Only in this place
I can feel you
My wish to fall back in
Back from where I came
Where I found you a life

LÃ¥t mig falla, lÃ¥t mig falla
LÃ¥t mig falla, lÃ¥t mig falla in
TillÃ¥t mig falla in

Dreams will breed new realms
For us to exist
To exist
To be again
