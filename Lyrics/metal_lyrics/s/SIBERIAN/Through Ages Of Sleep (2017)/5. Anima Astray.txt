Disgrace
I never thought I'd be here
This place
Someone must have led me here

I followed them
Just followed them
I followed them blindly
Just followed them

Disgrace
I'd never thought I'd end up here
This face
Can not reflect into these eyes no more

Was it my choice
Who was it that really led me here
Was it my choice
Was it I that really led me here

Circles around the I
Bind up to tie it all together
Circles around the why
I will leave you proud
Promise
