Slipping through your fingers
All you ever imagined
Never
It will never be

Years falling away from you
Futures not where supposed to be
Never 
They will never be

Keep on pushing the boundaries
Mental, physical blood on my sleeve
If I don't believe what I can achieve
Then there's nothing left
Nothing left for me

Aldrig, som en dÃ¶d Ã¥t mina drÃ¶mmar
Aldrig, jag vÃ¤grar slÃ¤ppa in dem orden
Aldrig, all framtid rensat frÃ¥n hopp
Aldrig, jag vÃ¤grar slÃ¤ppa in dem orden
