Time and time again
Throughout the centuries
How many times
Must it be repeated?
A countless number
Of treatise
And all too few
Have absorbed their meaning

Regarded as prodigies
But You ignore the messages
Of these few
Perceived as honorable
And You can't find
The inner strength
To take to heart
Our responsibilities

And You have seen
The results from afar
Of perpetual neglect
Without a trace
Of empathy
So it will continue
That the words of wisdom
Will be ignored
Leaving us back
Right where we started
Wallowing aimlessly
In a world of ignorance
