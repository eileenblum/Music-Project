Fools! Stop waving Your flag
And clean the shit off Your glasses
Freedom of speech, a government lie
To calm and quiet the masses

Freedom of speech exists
If what You say is accepted by the majority
One will quickly lose
That right when they are part of the minority

All popular artists are the same
This is no coincidence
Maybe the public would not respond to
Deviants
That is an incorrect inference
People with money and power are blessed

But they can fund and promote
Subversive ideas they have intentionally
Suppressed
To insure the safety of status quo

If one's ideas pose no threat
They are the ones to succeed
Monetary backing they will get
By the claws of corporate greed

True freedom of speech
Occurs when all ideas
Are given equal viewing
To the general public

Censor art
Suppress reflection of society
Censor thought
