Curse the priest
Rape the nun
Kill Jesus Christ
Spit at the church

Sin - Unholy behavior
Blasphemy - Church desecration
Evil - Irreligious
Irreverent - Lack of reverence

Overwhelmed by hate
Ridicule the cross around Your neck
Set the torah a blaze
Religions are worthless and for the weak

Sin - Unholy behavior
Blasphemy - Church desecration
Evil - Irreligious
Irreverent - Lack of reverence

For God
For religion
For worship

Hatred and disgust
For the values You set
Ban all religions
Decay is all You get
Burn the churches and temples
Burn them to the ground
Who cares what they saw?
Rejoice at the mound
