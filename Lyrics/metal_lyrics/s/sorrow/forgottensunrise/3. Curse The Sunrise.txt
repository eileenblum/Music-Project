Reaching out, from beyond
He's dying to be killed
Screaming out, without a sound
The pain, it's in his eyes
Without a thought, his mind goes blank,
Blind stare confesses weakness
Rotting bones, decaying flesh
Makes him look almost human
Utters something only he understands
Watching, waiting, for the death of this stranger
That clings to life desperately
Forcing air into his lungs
Confused, he loosens his grip
As his mind slowly drifts away
Reality faces day after day
Screams in his darkness, his way, he can not find
A time to live, a time to die

[SOLO Brett]
[SOLO Andy]

You don't want to see his end
As if this wasn't it now
He takes a look into his past
And hopes this breath will be his last
