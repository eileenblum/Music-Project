[Words and music by Andy Marchione]

Begging to be saved as I fall to the alter
Her lifeless body still warm
I await the coming of the savior
He arrives to late
The battle is underway as I feel myself being torn in two
Many feelings, but I'm controlled by my hate
I remember the blade that ripped though her flesh
As she tried to escape
But she knew as I smiled
That I controlled her fate

[SOLO Andy]
[SOLO Brett]

I must be forgiven for all I've done
Because sin is a sin and sin is a pun
