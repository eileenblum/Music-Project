[Words and music by Brett Clarin]

Birth is the start of death
The endless process of decaying breath
Time has taken its toll
And your lungs resemble coal
Your life's so important in your own eyes
There's no way to prevent demise
And when your still here
Chresih the moments you hold dear
Because all that you've done
Amounts to nothing when you're gone
And when you're found lying in shit
Few people will care one bit
Kiss the Dead man's face
To respect someone who finished the race
Are the tears from sorrow or joy
Or tradition taught when they were boys
Laid to rest beneath the earth

You've fisnished the cycle you started at birth
When the Pains start to subside
Fewer are the tears they will cry
They visit Christmas, birthdays too...
And when there's nothing much to do
The visits become less frequent
And the flowers become Delinquent
Whomeever visited the last few times
Join the dead under the pines
Time has taken its toll
And your body resembles coal
Your life's now meaningless in your grave
The weeds on top you wouldn't save

[SOLO Brett]
