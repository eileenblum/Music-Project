[Words and Music by Brett Clarin]

The warning is clear, we must heed the call
A time to act, harmony for all mankind
The air we breathe
The land we graze
The water we drink
Destroyed by man
The earth's not ours to do as we please
We rent our land, no one lives forever
You live in excess you love to waste
You kill for greed the traits of man
The misuse, the misuse of rescources
Supply, demand
You demand more supply
Equal guilt, equal guilt to all
Use of services, you've serviced their cause
What are you going to do
When the filth has caught up to you?
Is that what it's going to take
For you callous bastards to awake?

[SOLO Andy]

Listen to what I have to say
Learn to use the strength of knowledge
Rather than the knowledge of strength
Together we can rise about the filth
To live in peace and harmony...
THose of you, those who know the faces
Use denial, denial to voer your guilt
Act now!
Act against the status quo
Upon their greed
Upon which the world is built
You can hear
Yet, you do not listen
You read the words
Yet, you do not think
Aware of the facts
But nothing will change
Laissez-fair the policy of mankind
