Awakening
When I was young
I'd thought I'd die
A lost man
A useless life
Truant to my atrocities
I sacrificed integrity
To turn relief of tyrants escaped
From the ground's sunburst upon my neck
Then you will feel my rage
Feel my rage
Wings of Gabriel
Descend to my fate
Curiosity filled with what was lost
