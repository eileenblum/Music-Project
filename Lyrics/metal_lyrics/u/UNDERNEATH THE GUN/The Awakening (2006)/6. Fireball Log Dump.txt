This is your last chance, now it has begun
Collapsing, faster, behind these closed doors,
Altered stories told,
A new promise, loss,
Tarnished, won't be told,
Now you all await,
The world is easy to float,
It is a chain to the throat
This is your last chance, now it has begun
This is your last chance, now it is done
