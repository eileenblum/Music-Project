I am no one
Put on this world as a killer
With my words you die
Turn around the blinding
With a mask of lies
You prepare the bodies, and I'll prepare the ice
Murderer with a mask
With him I find myself
Not lost anymore
No more death on my hands
My hate is lifted from
All their is left to do
Pick up the blood
