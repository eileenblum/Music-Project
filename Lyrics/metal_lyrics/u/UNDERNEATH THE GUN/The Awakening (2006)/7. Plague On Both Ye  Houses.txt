Blemished in filth
Bathed in plague
Showing the world who you are
Sweeping the world in wretch
Blemished in filth
Bathed in plague
Call in all unto
Massacre
Breathing their blood you smile in satisfaction like the plague you are
Calling all into massacre
The close minded fall and the open live only for suffering
