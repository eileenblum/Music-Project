Dark, burn glaze,
I saw in her eyes,
That night she would night stand by lies,
Engulfed she waits and treads for night,
This corpse a demon, awaits, inside
SHE CAN RUN BUT SHE CAN'T HIDE
End this trial, prophecies aside,
Devoured, in time, eternally, we lye
WHY WON'T YOU LISTEN TO ME
You won't take me for my faith,
You believe in time this fades
WITH EYES WIDE OPEN, NOW WE WILL SEE
