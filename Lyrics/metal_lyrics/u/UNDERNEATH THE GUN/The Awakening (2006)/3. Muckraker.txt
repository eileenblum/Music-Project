Pretend to feel, the love from these, broken hearts, pretend to feel
After all these broken thoughts you will never cease to remain
After all these broken thoughts you will never cease to remain
Scarred
Ripped open and scarred
Time for a change, a change in you
Can't forget the past
You stand at my side with a knife
As you wait for the time to make your deceiving turn
Get her out
Get her out of my face
