Destroyed the damned and wicked for altogether a time once more
It goes this time
A life of onslaught
A time for downpour for everything you're not
Believe
Believe
Believe
When you find yourselves in the end time
You will call on him to repent or deny
In him I truly arise
Calling father to son
Forgive the shameless life
Signing side with side in him I rise
Arise
Beneath defeat
