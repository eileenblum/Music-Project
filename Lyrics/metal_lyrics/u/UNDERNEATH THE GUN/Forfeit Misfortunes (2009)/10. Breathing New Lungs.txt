Oh how I'm falling faster, into this state of mind
I look at this barren page, with nothing left to write
How I'm falling faster!

You've raised suspicion
Based on what you've seen
Things keep coming up
I'm coming...

Coming clean
Coming clean
(Oh God redeem me) [x2]

Oh how I'm falling faster, into this state of mind
I look at this barren page, with nothing left to write

You broke down the arms that kept me safe inside

There has never been a love so strong
Keeping me in line

Oh how I'm falling faster, into this state of mind
I look at this barren page, with nothing left to write

Oh God! Rid me from myself! [x6]

Turn me against the burdens inside me
Open my eyes so I can clearly see
How I've broken against my own oppressive behavior

Normal isn't so normal anymore...
