Knowing now all your thought
Before you will
Take this bread and this cup
Losing grasp of what
What you will know
And don't give this conversation up!

Knowing now all your thoughts
Of what you will know
Don't give this conversation up!

Stand before His throne
(feast your eyes on His glorious robe)
Stand before His throne
(remember that you're not alone)
Stand before His throne
(He is everything you'll know)

Black is your heart for you diminish this decree of light
And you devour your own soul and sight

This is your part for new finished thought into action
You knew composure only cost a fraction

Back in the start of this disaster you forgot all loss
The last conviction was only lost

Your body shall forever rest on this dreadful night!
Your body shall forever rest on this dreadful night!

You, you will be forgotten
You, you will, you will be...

Forgotten
(you will be forgotten) [x2]

Forgotten
In this utter darkness

But your only escape
Is penitence within
Join with me brothers!

Black is your heart for you diminish this decree of light
And you devour your own soul and sight

This is your part for new finished thought into action
You knew composure only cost a fraction

Salvation is clear!
Salvation is clear! [x2]

Through Him!
