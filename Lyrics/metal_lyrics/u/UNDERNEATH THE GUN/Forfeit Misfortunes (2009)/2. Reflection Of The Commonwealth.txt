Face to face with yourself. Staring back at your own reflection. Take in the flood and the overwhelming thought of infliction. Every breath you take in eliminates every chance you may have. Pushing everything to the edge.

We are - Coming undone. You are - Coming undone. This is - Coming undone.

See the light shining through in this room. This is light shining through to you. Come to me (turn and see me) [x2]

This is your redemption (it's captivating) Can you feel it? (he is reaching for you) Will you see me? I will! Take your hand, lead you through the darkness inside of you. [x2]

Coming back to it all! Face to face with yourself. Staring back at your own reflection.

Take in the flood and the overwhelming thought of infliction. Every breath you take in eliminates every chance you may have. Pushing everything to the edge. To the edge. [x3]

And this my friends is an occasion. Rise to it! You must. Rise to it. [x2]
