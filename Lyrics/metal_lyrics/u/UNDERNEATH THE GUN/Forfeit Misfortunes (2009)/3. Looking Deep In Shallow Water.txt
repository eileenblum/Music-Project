What was thought the ending
Began a whole knew conclusion
This story that you called so old

I'm reading through
Turning the pages
This story is so new
And it's happening to you
Cloaked through pride
It's happening to you!

This story is so new...

Breathing in what you spit out
Tasting a dense devout
Breathing in what you spit out

Walk past the shame, run past what you became [x2]

Look up, look here
Nothing can be more clear
Look up, look here
Tension has found your fear
Your fear...

Listless, making a list of the unknown
Hopeless, hoping something was unshown
Careless, nothing was your own

Walk past the shame, run past what you became

You became...
So deeply shallow
Your words have become hollow
Concentrate
Reality has choked your swallow

If this is considered, hit or miss
Remember
Crossing the line is defined by walking it
