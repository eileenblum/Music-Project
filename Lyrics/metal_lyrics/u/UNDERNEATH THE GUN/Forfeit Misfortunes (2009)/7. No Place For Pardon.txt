I'm taking control of everything I've lost
I've drifted down this river side by side with everything I'm not

Horizons of he who never hungers
He who never thirst
Burnish the seems of feeble reaping
Destroying last competence of what it first
Losing grasp of what is keeping

I'll step this up
Because you're worth more than this
My God you're worth more than this!

I'm giving up on giving in!

I'll step this up
Because you're worth more than this
My God you're worth more than this!

I'm taking control of everything I've lost
I've drifted down this river side by side with everything I'm not

You are a sheep amongst wolves

No place for pardon
Potentials havoc in Eden's garden

Coming between the problem and the solution
Is nothing but yourself
Nothing but yourself!

You are a sheep amongst wolves

I'm giving up on giving in!

I am a selfish man without any hint of conviction
You made your point to get under my skin
But I'm on top and I won't let you in
I won't let you in!

Break the walls, close the gaps
Show me the likes of which you've never seen

It's not who I am
It's who you're not!
Who you're not!

Break the walls, close the gap
Show me the likes of which you've never seen

I'll step this up
Because you're worth more than this
My God you're worth more than this!
