Gigantic land of cold
Ruled by winter's wind, storms freezing all by frost
Once a mighty empire
Cities of gold so proud, remembering your past

Where are you now?

Led by utopia
Your people took control, October was the time
The great revolution
A new era begins, 69 years of reign

Years go by	centuries shaping your demise
History glorious relentless and violent
Was it what you stood for?
Was it all worth it?

What will remain of you?

Where are you now ?

Now that the West has won
Iron curtain crumbled, freedom for your people
Tell me what you've become
Is it a victory, or have you lost it all?

Years go by	centuries shaping your demise
History glorious relentless and violent
Was it what you stood for?
Was it all worth it?

What will remain of you?
