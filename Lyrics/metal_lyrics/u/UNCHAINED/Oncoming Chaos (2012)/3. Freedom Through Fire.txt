Never had the right to decide
No one ever gave you the choice
The rules are set for ever
Liberty is barely an idea

Raise your voice
Let yourself be heard
Raise your voice
Let yourself be heard

Sparkled by immolation
Of a man despaired, humiliated
Anger and frustration
Set a fire never to be tamed

Raise your voice
Let yourself be heard
Raise your voice

Now! Spread the word all around:
Freedom through fire
Spread the word all around:
Freedom through fire

Freedom through fire
Freedom through fire
