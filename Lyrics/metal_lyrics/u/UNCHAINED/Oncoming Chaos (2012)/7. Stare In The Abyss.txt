I can't escape
Four walls in my mind
Imprisoning me
Leaving me to rot

All alone now
My body is my cell
All hope is gone
Worst than any pain

Face the void
Stare in the abyss
Breathe no more
Suffocating thoughts

Plunging inside
Me, myself and I
Contradictions
Who I really am

Desperation
Heading for nothing
Vacuity
Emptiness of life

Face the void
Stare in the abyss
Breathe no more
Suffocating thoughts

Stare in the abyss
Staring into the abyss
