Running for your life
Hiding underground

Nothing will save you from this
No way to escape the fear
This time there's no compromise
You'll have to face destiny

So you got no choice
Meet your death from above

Praying for mercy
Crying in fear

Your soul can no more be saved
You're bound to wander in Hell
The root of all evil
Is yours forevermore

Death from above meet you maker
Death from above meet him now

So you got no choice
Meet your death from above
