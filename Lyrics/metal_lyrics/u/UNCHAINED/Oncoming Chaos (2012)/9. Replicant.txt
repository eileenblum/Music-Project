Four years is all I can hope for
Programmed to cease after that
Freewill is unknown to me
Emotions I will never feel

Exiled from the Earth
I serve as a slave

Independence
Not meant for me
Future perspective
Forbidden to me

No way I'll accept my fate
As a tool that will be retired
I want to be remembered
I'm more human than human

Came back to the Earth
I'm my own master

Independence
Not meant for me
Future perspective
Forbidden to me

Replicant

Four years is all I can hope for
Programmed to cease after that
Freewill is unknown to me
Emotions I will never feel
