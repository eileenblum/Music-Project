Paid for my crimes
Live for the kill

Life is so cheap, it's only my job
Death has a price, I'm a professional

I don't know your name
Or what you've done

Don't ask for mercy, I feel no pity
Blood on my hands, everyday's routine

I never ask, never feel, I'm just doing my job
Infernal, death machine, kill for a good reason

Money is my god, I've no regrets
Greed's my religion, I don't repent

How will it end?
I know too well

Who lived by the sword will die by the sword
My future is doom, but that's not a problem

I never ask, never feel, I'm just doing my job
Infernal, death machine, kill for a good reason

Money is my god, I've no regrets
Greed's my religion, I don't repent
