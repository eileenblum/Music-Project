Trapped in a life so empty since the beginning
Imprisoned by chains so heavy, you don't realize

Condemned to live for a purpose, a sense of duty
Crushed by a set of values imposed upon you

So tired of being played with, it's time to awake
Unleash the beast inside you, never to be tamed

Open your eyes and question, challenge everything
Casting a doubt on all things, disobedience!

Break away
From these chains
Break away
From these chains

Restless in our soul
Unchained from this life
Forever
Unchained we will live

Trapped in a life so empty since the beginning
Imprisoned by chains so heavy, you don't realize

Condemned to live for a purpose, a sense of duty
Crushed by a set of values, imposed upon you

Break away
From these chains
Break away
From these chains

Restless in our soul
Unchained from this life
Forever
Unchained we will live

Unchained we will die
