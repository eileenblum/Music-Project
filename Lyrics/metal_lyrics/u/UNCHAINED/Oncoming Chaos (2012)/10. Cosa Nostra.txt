More than just a soldier
In a soulless nameless army
I fight but not alone
The family's by my side

We run business on our own
The code of silence rules
Pay tribute to the boss
A made man 'til you die

Take an oath
Of loyalty
Cosa Nostra
Is our family

We just can't retire
It's a lifetime commitment
One choice for the future
In jail or in the grave

Non schierarti mai contro la famiglia
I will make you make you an offer you can't refuse

Take an oath
Of loyalty
Cosa Nostra
Is our family
