Cannot live with a broken soul
Cannot hope for a better life
Cannot dream with no desire
Cannot trust with no self esteem

So hollow
Your life is
Chaotic ruins

No one, nobody will cry at your funeral

You are sure there's no tomorrow
Nothing good can come out of this
You are fighting against your fate
You are pissing against the wind

So hollow
Your life is
Chaotic ruins

No one, nobody will cry at your funeral

Black is everything you see
Black is everything you touch

Cannot live with a broken soul
Cannot hope for a better life
Cannot dream with no desire
Cannot trust with no self esteem

So hollow
Your life is
Chaotic ruins

No one, nobody will cry at your funeral
