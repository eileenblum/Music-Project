I'm the fear within that's pouring outside
Make you sweat, unable to react
I'm the ghost that's coming from the past now
Memories rising to the surface
I make you sweat, you choke and you suffocate
Unwilling to live it all again
Feel the urge to plunge into the darkness
The only place where you find comfort

Oppression
Live the nightmare again
Liberation
Inflict it on others

You resist and you try not to give in
But your will is weaker and weaker
Humanity is drifting away now
Leaving you just like an animal

No stranger to our kind
Evil lives inside us
No scapegoat is to blame
Face your evil within

Oppression
Live the nightmare again
Liberation
Inflict it on others

No scapegoat to blame

Evil within us
