Blood in the water
Wounds open wide
Cold blooded murder
Time to face death

You scream but no one can hear you, can see you
You run but you know there's nowhere to hide
Breathless and sweaty, crying in vain
Screaming your lungs out but no one can hear you

Bled out completely
To the very last drop
No grave's deep enough
To bury your hate

Spirits are calling but you're not really there
Blood lust still growing, you start to enjoy it
Nightmare, fantasyâ¦ you don't remember

I can't, I won't shed a tear for you
I won't shed my blood in vain
I can't, I won't shed a tear for you
It's so easy to hate you

Scream in a deafening silence
Run but never escape
My favorite nightmare

I scream but no one can hear me, can see me
I run but I know there's nowhere to hide
Breathless and sweaty, crying in vain
Screaming my lungs out but no one can hear me

Never awake, feeling so numb, in this nightmare

I can't, I won't shed a tear for you
I won't shed my blood in vain
I can't, I won't shed a tear for you
It's so easy to hate you

Shapeless fearâ¦ suffocateâ¦ my nightmare
