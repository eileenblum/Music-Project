Promising victory
Leading men to their fate
Vultures circling above

Greedy dreams of glory
Spilling blood throughout time
No one wins in the end

Warlike spirit â slaughters mankind

Politics' hypocrite rotten words
Arrogance twisting truth

Feeding them with those lies
In the name of a god
They blindly follow

Promising salvation
Controlling the masses
By fear and violence

God addiction â man's damnation

Bigotry's hypocrite rotten words
Deaf and blind to all prayersâ¦to all your prayers

A world without god
No heaven nor hell
Time for a new age
Of enlightenment

Our lust for power
Our thirst for blood
No life after death
For this is hell

This is our hellâ¦ we can't escape

Rotten words of religion turning beauty into vice
Power is in knowledge, not your imaginary friends

Centuries of war and horror
History repeating itself
Never learn or remember
Same causes produce the same effects
From Christians sent to the lions
To crusades, holy wars in the East
Burning witches at the stake
Inquisition chasing heresy
Genocide, final solution
Industrialize the doomsday machine
Child abuse, protect the paedophiles
Massacre in a concert hall
