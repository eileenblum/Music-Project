A sound breaks the silence
A gunshot in the night
Still echoes in your mind

A body lies on the ground
Right in a pool of blood
A last death spasm and it's done

All hell breaks loose all around
People scream and cry
They only run for their lives

Everyman for himself
Mad rush to escape death
Chaos is turning you on

Are you just a witness
Of this mindless crime
Or did you start it all?

Did you have to listen
To your personal demon
A dark impulse took control

One foot in the grave
Death addiction
Killing each other is
Part of the game

No lessons learned
By shedding blood
