Born, live and learn
Life passes by like a flash of light
Soon, realize
Brief is the time before we say goodbye

It's a race we can never win
Time will win in the end
It's a trap we need to escape
Just as long as we're here

Waiting here is all in vain
Nothing in the afterlife

Now! Seize the day
Before your life just fades away
Live! Live your way
Carpe Diem is the only way

Waiting here is all in vain
Nothing in the afterlife

Soâ¦ make the most of your time
Sell your soul to pleasure and let it kill you
Loseâ¦ lose control, lose yourself
Live to find what you love and let it kill you

Let it murder your weak despair
Let it devour your apathy
Let it wipe out indifference
Let it drain all boredom of life

I gave my all
To notes and words and this noise I love
I surrendered
Gave way to the demon of music
