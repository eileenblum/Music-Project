King of the two lands
God for my people
Still I'm only human
Death will come for me too

Divine powers of mine
Useless in the afterlife
Magic funerary spells
Guiding my soul through the underworld â¦ through the underworld

Words carved on the walls
Or laid inside my coffin
A hundred and ninety two
Chapters of ritual speech

Aimed to protect the deceased
Bringing knowledge and control
Funeral incantations, prayers to gods
Preparing the dead for the weighing of heartâ¦ weighing of his heart

Written in the Book of the Dead
Magic spells of protection
Guiding my last journey

Buried with the Book of the Dead
Traveling across the sky
Dead king among the gods

Blessed spirit, equal to the gods
