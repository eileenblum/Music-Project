A winter caretaker hired to look after
The Overlook Hotel, snowbound and isolated
Built on an ancient site, an Indian burial ground, it has a life on its own
Back in 1970 a tragedy occurred, a family killed with an axe

Twin girls and wife butchered in a room
Cascade of blood flowingâ¦

The boy who shines
Sees visions from the past
Glimpses of the future
Tony knew he didn't want to go
Hearâ¦ redrum

Come play with us Danny, forever and ever
There's a woman in her bath, in a room in the west wing (2 3 7)
You are the caretaker, and you have always been
All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy

The boy who shines
Sees visions from the past
Glimpses of the future
Tony knew he didn't want to go
Hearâ¦ redrum

Twin girls and wife butchered in a room
Cascade of blood flowingâ¦

The boy who shines
Sees visions from the past
Glimpses of the future
Tony knew he didn't want to go
Hearâ¦ redrum
