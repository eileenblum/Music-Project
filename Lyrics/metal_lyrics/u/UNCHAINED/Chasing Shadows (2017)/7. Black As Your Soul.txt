Waste all the tears that fell
Roaming here in hell
Alone in this field of doom, so lost

Condemned to a useless life
Reduced to a worm
Chocking on the bullshit you swallow

Asking the reasons why you're here
Don't know if you deserve it
Breathing or maybe suffocating alone

Judged by creatures up above
Falling down in Hell
No hope for absolution ever

And as you're trying to escape
You can run and hide but never flee
Nightmares and visions will haunt you down
Make you drown in a hole as black as your soul

In a hole as black as your soul

Life fades away
Heat disappears
Light vanishes
Darkness surrounds

And as you're trying to escape
You can run and hide but never flee
Nightmares and visions will haunt you down
Make you drown in a hole as black as your soul
