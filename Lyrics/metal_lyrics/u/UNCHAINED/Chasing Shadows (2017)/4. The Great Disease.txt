Your disgusting certainties
Make you so proud
Standing by those ideas
Never questioning

A naked body on a cross
Birthed by a virgin
A book written ages ago
Dictates your life

Being kept in ignorance
Tamed by fear and guilt
Denying all obvious truth
Proved by science

I will never understandâ¦

I despise your beliefs and your convictions
This great disease called religion just sickens me

I'll remain an atheist

Brainwashing the young and weak
No education
Praying instead of thinking
Lest they understand

Hypocrisy becomes your law
Hate is your fuel
Homophobic and sexist
God-fearing bastardsâ¦ bastards!

Now it's time to open your mind
You can call me Antichrist
I'm better off damned

I despise your beliefs and your convictions
This great disease called religion just sickens me

I'll remain an atheist

'Til the end, an atheist
