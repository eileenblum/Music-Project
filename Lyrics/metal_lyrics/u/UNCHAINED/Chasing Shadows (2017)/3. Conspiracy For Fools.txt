Things can't be what they seem
Even though the facts are here
Everyone has a scheme
A hidden agenda

Nobody rides for free
Medias tell only lies
Governments are behind
Manipulating facts

Unknown forces are at stake
From the beginning of mankind
Conspirators are the same
The usual suspects

Must be the Masons or the Jews
Or secret societies
All fighting to establish
A new world order

You fools!

Never believe what you read
Always look for the conspiracy
Never believe what you hear
There must be a conspiracy

Suspicious deaths
False flag operations
Alien's encounters
Creation of diseases

Illuminati, Reptilians
Evil forces unseen
Paranoia as a rule
Ignorance as a pride

A matter of faith rather than proof

Never believe what you read
Always look for the conspiracy
Never believe what you hear
There must be a conspiracy
