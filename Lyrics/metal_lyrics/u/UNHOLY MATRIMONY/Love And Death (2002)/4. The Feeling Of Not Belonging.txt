Opening eyes and mind
Horrified by the extent of the degradation
We bear the revelation
But deny the living ashes

Sooty world
Led by absurdity
Though amongst the waves
We are not part of that sea

Dark rivers of hatred, scorn and contempt
Shall carry away the weak
Wiping the rust
Sons of modern lightness

The feeling of not belonging
Assails our soul...

Something has to be done
Time shall take car of it...

Opening eyes and mind
Horrified by the extent of the degradation
We bear the revelation
But deny the living ashes

Condemned we are to stand
This immoral steam of emptiness
But we shall rise
But we shall grow

Let reason be our guide
Whispering its secret words of wisdom to the ones who deserve it...

Dark rivers of hatred, scorn and contempt
Shall carry away the weak
Wiping the rust
Sons of modern lightness

The feeling of not belonging
Assails our soul...

The feeling of not belonging
Assails our soul
Preventing us from living
Preventing us from dying
