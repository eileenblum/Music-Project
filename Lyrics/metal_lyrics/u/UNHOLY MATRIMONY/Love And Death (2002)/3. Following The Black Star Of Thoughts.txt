Two silhouettes wandering within a maze of dead trees
Scrawny guards of time

Courageously we walk hand in hand
Far from the decadent human kind
Beyond the illusion of the sun we are
In quest for reason

United by soul and blood
Fusion of thoughts and flesh
Together as one
The Truth shall be ours

Azure eyes, golden hair
We are the keepers of the unholy flames
Nails of steel, teeth of diamond
As wolfs amongst sheep forever we shall wander

Time has come for us to rise
Chaos has just revealed

Absurdity, Nothingness
Against weakness we fight
No values, No ethics
Nihilism be our guide

This is the funeral march of the Elite

In a world of perdition We have found our path
Beyond Good and Evil we stand
Together as one

Following the Black Star of Thoughts

Now running but still hand in hand
Our bloods mingled in a supreme alliance
Calm before the dawn of the final fight

Azure eyes, golden hair
We are the keepers of the unholy flames
Nails of steel, teeth of diamond
As wolfs amongst sheep forever we shall wander

Time has come for us to rise
Chaos has just revealed
