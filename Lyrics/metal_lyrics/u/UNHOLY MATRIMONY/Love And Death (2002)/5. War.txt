Vengeance in our hearts
Vapours of Hatred blurring our vision
We, the legionnaires of the Elite
Are gathering under a dead moon

Against the law of shepherds
We follow our own path
Turning our back on the vile ones who fell
Under the sign of easiness

The declaration of War
Resonate through the gorges of Life
From thousands of winged silhouettes
In a choir of triumph

The declaration of War...

Fighting against the emptiness of thoughts
Satisfaction in decadence
Cursed are the poor in spirit
For the shall be exterminated

Thunder roars
The angry elements awake
Supporting us in our quest

Thunder roars
Vomiting innumerable tongues of fire
The sky starts its purification process

The declaration of War
Resonate through the gorges of Life
From thousands of winged silhouettes
In a choir of triumph

The declaration of War...

Fighting against the emptiness of thoughts
Satisfaction in decadence
Cursed are the poor in spirit
For the shall be exterminated

Evolution shall enforce its law
Te weak are to disappear
Denying their values
In a far but promised future we shall rise
