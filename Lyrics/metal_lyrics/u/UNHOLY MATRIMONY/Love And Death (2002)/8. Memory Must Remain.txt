Killing myself to live
A half life, a double pain
Two is power but two is war
One is peace but one is blight

Reason against heart
The choice of negation strikes
Mutilating the newborn god
Reducing His kingdom to ashes

Ashes from which no life can grow again
Except reasonable memory, memory, memory...

The myth is broken: Isolde lies dead on the ground
Who killed Her, what killed the sworn to be everlasting
Both a suicide and a murder
The treacherous whispers of Love acted again sewing both pain and shame

Love is a Lie

Memory must remain
Beyond the present stains of pain
And shame
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Be proud!

The myth is broken: Isolde lies dead on the ground
Who killed Her, what killed the sworn to be everlasting
Both a suicide and a murder
The treacherous whispers of Love acted again sewing both pain and shame

Memory must remain
Memory must remain
