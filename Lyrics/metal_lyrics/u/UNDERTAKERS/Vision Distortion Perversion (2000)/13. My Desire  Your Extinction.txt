During the night I always dream the same thing
I don't know the reason, I wanna do it
Waiting the moment to satisfy my self
I imagine your life destructing by my own hands

It's a fuckin' fever, I got the evil inside my head
You think it's a perversion, I think it's a desire
It's unrational pleasure, I have this in my mind
Fucked with a gun, cut up by a knife

Disjointed by a saw, strangled by a string
There is no difference, I wanna your suffering

Your unarmed body on the floor, it's a fantastic vision
I like to kill without stopping

The final extinction is my law
Enjoy my idea... you'll die
