Closed in this cell
Waiting my hour
Thinking about my life, misery, violence,
Destroyed
By the pang of hunger

You state, you're condemning me, you're killing me
Don't ask me why I have killed
You have condemned when I was born
Now, I'm dead man walking

Few minutes, justice will be done
Your justice, law of who can live
I'll pay my fault, a seat will be the last throne
You will be free, you can condemn
we condemn you You will be never accused

You state, you're condemning me
you're killing me
Don't ask me why I have killed You have condemned
me when I was born Now, I'm dead man walking

That's the end of a life without future
Of an useless existence only this you gave to me
Few minutes, a priest will ask to me
"Pray the 'God'" Embrace the faith
I got no God, that's why I never had a life.
Desperation and anguish were my unique fellows

You state, you're condemning me, you're killing me
Don't ask me why I have killed You have condemned me
when I was born
Now, I'm dead man walking
