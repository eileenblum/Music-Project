I got a story to tell (you)
It's about my secret passion
I burn the people alive
using different ways
Watching a body while it's burning
and its screams spread

Theirself through the space
in a silent night
the smell of his flesh ravish my brain
my ecstasy is covered in a terrified body
With a jerry - can

I don't use knives or guns I need just
A lighter It's so great vision to see

A running man
Wrapped by the flames
An human brand running to an inevitable death
I think to be a genius not a madman
Burnt Alive Burnt Alive

This is an art not a homicide

Burnt Alive Burnt Alive
No complication just Burnt Alive
