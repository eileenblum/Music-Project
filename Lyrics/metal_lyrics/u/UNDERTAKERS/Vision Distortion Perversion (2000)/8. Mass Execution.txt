Fuck you bastard
Die bastard

Extinction, pain and torture
are my vital strength
Piece of shit
Don't escape, fucking

Gimme a reason to
leave you on earth
Suffer in silence,
Don't scream, don't cry

Every day I need to kill, with my
gun, only this way I can satisfy
My fuckin' attitude
It's a cerebral orgasm to see
Piled bodies
It's my pleasure,
it's my life, relax
let to die

Gimme your brain
Die by hands
Relax, let to die

Everyone is killed
Different way

Don't ask me
Why I do it
Don't ask me
Why I do it
