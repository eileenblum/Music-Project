Hey you stay, away
I'm a fuckin' bastard
I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't care about your point of view
I just follow my instinct
I know only hate and disgust

Fuckin' loser you suck
Fuckin' loser you suck

Hey you, ridiculous worm
crawl following any fuckin' trend
Taste the cold of my gun
I'll shoot you till your
Brain will lump out your head
('cause) I'm a motherfucker
This is my life

Fuckin' loser you suck
Fuckin' loser you suck

It's so great feel
your bones
crashed by my fingers

I'm the motherfucker
You'll cry I'll laugh
