Stupid people, you believe
In something unnatural
You need Christ... you need Satan
They're the different sides of
The same coins

No Satan No God
Angel of the love
No Satan No God
Angel of the death

Catholics prey their god
Satanists sacrifice their life
but the human mankind can't survive
Only the strong survives

No Satan No God
Think by yourself
No Satan No God
No esoteric presence

Use your brain, no fuckin' imposition
It's your life, it's your energy

Weaker men follow the holy lords
painted guys like in a carnival show

Disgusting slaves of a surrealistic religion
I'm free without God and Satan

Religion isn't good for myself
preying your personal god show your weakness
Scream for your Satan, Satan doesn't exist
Burn the religion you will be much better
Subjected to the cross
No Satan No God
