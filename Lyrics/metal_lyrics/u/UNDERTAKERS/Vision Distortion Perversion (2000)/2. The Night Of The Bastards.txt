No piety, nothing to say
No forgiveness, no pray
No justify, no escape
No reason, no words

It's written in our hearts

Kicks, punches, cuffs
What do you prefer?
This is only the beginning
We'll cynical this night
Think to our lies
Think to our promises
You must pay
For everything

This is the night
Of the Bastards
This is
The night
...your last night

Ten stabs! That's what
I have Do with you

Revenge for our right
