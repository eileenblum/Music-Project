Pointless life trying to earn money
Subjected to your job and fashions
I got my pride, I got my life
I don't care about your life
No stupid rules for me
You're condemned to be a faggot
slave of yourself
I got my pride,
I got my life
I don't care about your life
Institutions, religious media,
False idols
I wanna be free
I don't need your comprehension
I don't wanna your friendship
Enjoy your ephemeral context
Without emotions and passions
Following success
losing your personality
Be happy, you got your shitty life
