I met you this winder day.
I came form a place faraway
you gave me shelter and you
held me warm.  You have me a
hand to hold.  The strength and
the will to grow old.  When we
were apart a day it felt like a year.

Oh, won't you understand that the
time of your life isn't coming again.
No use to runaway. There is no use
to stay and there is nothing to gain
anymore.  At the end of the bridge.

The white sand is running through the
hourglass.  I am abandoning you. betraying
the only one that was true.
Now I've found aonther one to guard me
and rock me to sleep.  But it's your
water in the tears that i weep...

Oh, won't you understand...

I send you my love through the stars in
the sky.  Because they shine over over me and
they shine over you.  You are a part
of my heart and I miss you a lot.  You
remind me of things that I thought I'd
forgot.  Whatever I see I'm comparing
with you but I must leave now my friend
and explore something new.  So I send
you my love through the wind and the  rain
so that the sidewalks will know, that I will walk
there again someday, someday.

Understand me....
