Let the pain get deep in me
Like the blood gets in my vains

Step behind me if you can
let the show begin

Behind a red curtain I wait
The crowd is not enough to inhale my hate

I know you need more
I'll give some more
I give more

Now you set your hell on me
destroying my ground

Now just let my soul be free
your world disables in my core

Take away everything that's holding me
Time to let your hand go now

Lay your burden all on my shoulders
I'm the one who pleases you
Applause for my majesty

I know you need some more
I know you need more
I give more

Now you set your hell on me
destroying my ground

Now just let my soul be free
your world disables in my core

How can I be so alone this time?
Inside I'm bleeding, I'm fading, I'm being
Something I could never be
never be, never be

Now you set your hell on me
destroying my ground

Now just let my soul be free
your world disables in my core
