I don't think you mind
Or ever do it again
Or feel inside the acid flavour of sorrow

I don't think you believe
Or ever do it again
Or ever felt just a little like me

All I need is to feel

I can see you turning over
Can you see me drifting away?
The life I make
The love I brake
To release me from this stray
The rules I break
My every mistake
Will just take me
And I will fade away

You never read my mind
Or you will ever again
Or got inside the acid flavour of pain

Don't wanna know what you believe
Or ever see your face again
Or ever felt just a little like me

All I need is to feel

I can see you turning over
Can you see me drifting away?
The life I make
The love I brake
To release me from this stray
The rules I break
My every mistake
Will just take me
And I will fade away

Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

I have no more blood to waste on you anymore
You burned my brain cells, cancelled my will
blurred my vision, mezmerized my soul
You think you still possess my mind?
You'll always be such a fool
Now that you're out of my life I can breathe again
I know who I am
I'm gonna find my way and raise my head up

I can see you turning over
Can you see me drifting away?
The life I make
The love I brake
To release me from this stray
The rules I break
My every mistake
Will just take me
And I will fade away

Judge me
Just me
