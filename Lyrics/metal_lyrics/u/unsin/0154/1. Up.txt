I need to find my way, find my way
I need to seize the day, seize the day
I need to find my way, find my way
I need to find my way and raise my head
Up!

When you're looking at me
Do you know what I see?
All I see is a dead mind
You never wanna go home
You're surviving alone
Isn't this a sick mind?

Truth
They never tell you the truth
The never tell you
They never tell you the truth

I'm gonna break this face down
I'm gonna make it out
I'm hiding my pain
I'm still in the game
I'm still in your face
Come back to the fight
I'm all that you hate
I'm killing your fate
I'm gonna find my way and raise my head

When you're looking at me
Do you know what I see?
All I see is a sick mind
You never wanna go home
You're surviving alone
Isn't this sick?

I'm hiding my pain
I'm still in the game
I'm still in your face
Come back to the fight
I'm all that you hate
I'm killing your fate
I'm gonna find my way and raise my head

Raise my head...
