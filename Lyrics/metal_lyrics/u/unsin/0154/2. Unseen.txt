It's been such a long way
It's been such a long time
There were a thousand fates
The black one was mine

I've seen all the wars
And I've been waiting to heal
My time is over now
Got out of this deal

I pray to my god that he forgets my sins
He sais there is nothing to do
You're in hell
With a light against my eyes
I take my dice and my pistol
I'm down
Goodnight and goodluck and I'm unseen

It's been such a long way
It's been such a long time
Like a constant replay burning my mind

A movie of fear
A song I don't like to hear
I cannot live inside this
Can't breathe into it
Unseen I wanna stay

I pray to my god that he forgets my sins
He sais there is nothing to do
You're in hell
With a light against my eyes
i take my dice and my pistol
I'm down
Goodnight and goodluck and I'm unseen
