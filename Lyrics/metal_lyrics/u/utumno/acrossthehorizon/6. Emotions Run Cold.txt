Bring me to a paradise
Where I can drown in my deceit
Shattered.... I pass beyond
My lost life, I now greet

Emotions run cold, fear begins to grow
Desponent feelings are mindless and gone
Gather here around me and lay me to rest
Forever lost I grasp...
Absolute darkness engraved in my mind
And my conscience dissolves for saints and sinners

I stand here in silence, emptiness surrounds me
My pain shreds my illusions, alone I stand as master

[Lead: Dennis]

And above I see, the wickedness of man
I sink deeper in the lies whitc cuts my wounds
Tempting my fear, as I pray for rain
It's getting hard to breath. I'm chocking in my pain

I'm tired of this life
And all the lies that is creates
But god have mercy, don't take me now
I don't have faith, but my soul I'll give

Emotions run cold, fear begins to grow
Despondent feelings are mindless and gone
Gather here around me and lay me to rest
Forever lost I grasp...
Absolute darkness engraved in my mind
And my conscience dissolves for saints and sinners

Take me away...
