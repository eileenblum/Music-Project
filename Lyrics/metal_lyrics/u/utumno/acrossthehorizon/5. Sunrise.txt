Watch the sunrise once again, distant echoes now profane
As I wander through your mind and wonder what there is left
To find

Now unleash all this bliss, find that the sun will never
Rise again
This journey ends, at this scene
Who will be?
The ones who will winess it, the effigy
And the thoughts that believes my fate with memories
Fall into depths I cannot see
Where I am, leave me be
Let me watch the sunrise just one again...

Leave me be...

Let me kill my pride, watch the sun go down
Sadness feels my soul, in the light I stroll
Secrets turn to dust, selling me your trust
Now I'm obsolete but is my journey now complete?

Watch the sunrise once again
Distant echoes now profane

I search for peace and tranquillity
Weaker I fall and drown in ripping seas
Forever denying this frustration
The long lost art of dying

CRIMSON SKIES...
CRIMSON RAIN...
CRIMSON THOUGHTS...

I fall beyond the dying rainbow to seek the truth
In this well I spread my seed of generations to come

Sanctuary in my fears...
Sanctuary for my tears...

Now unleash all this bliss, find that the sun will never
Rise again
This journey ends, at this scene
Who will be?
The ones who will witness it, the effigy
And the thoughts that believes my fate with memories
Fall into depths I cannot see
Where I am, leave me be
Let me watch the sunrise just one again...
