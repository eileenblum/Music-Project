Devourin their twisted lies
A creation of minds insane
Darkness surrounds my existance
Their prayers are inane
Preaching for eternal life
Your illusions clouds my mind
I seek comfort in my fears
Not in the saviour you follow blind

Saviour reborn, incarnate the seeds
Manifest the lies that controls your needs
Bleed forever, divine creation
I need no saviour from the blinded salvation...

Conceal the blasphemy, lucid stories of loyalty
Suffer for our thoughts, of a saviour that misery brought...

You are no saviour reborn...

Struggling to find a missing link
The insecure will suffocate
A blurred vision of christianity
To a lost truth they relate
Drowing in your stupidness
Corrupted minds deceased
This saviour of yours will not return
Nauseating fear unleashed

Saviour reborn, incarnate the seeds
Manifest the lies that controls your needs
Bleed forever, divine creation
I need no saviour from the blinded salvation...

I bleed.... for no god...
Only for... myself...

Bleed forever, divine creation...
Preacher can't heal, these deep wounds...

Save me from these minds
Release me from this life
Diluded I wander through this maze of pain
My saviour sees through me
Not by eyes domain
Forever left to suffer
In the truth that now remains
Sorrow begins, with tears in my eyes
No saviour reborn, your truth is a lie
