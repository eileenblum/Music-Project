Searching for supreme, cure to my misery
Stare down as I vanish, down the depths where doom....
Breeds...
My existance slowly fades, as I drown in my grief
I pray to gods of the mind, please end this life of mine

Non existing pain, unleashed upon my soul
I panic my life is forgiven, leave me to die alone
My inner fear brought before me, I pray my life will end,
Lost souls I hear them laughing
Calling out: "Rid this god you sent..."

[Chorus]
In misery I dwell, far beyond the point of life
I beg you end my existance, I kneel before the god I strive...

Leave my life - forever blind
In the tomb I see - my misery

Make my life, an endless journey...

Searching for supreme, cure to my misery
Stare down as I vanish, down the depths where doom....
Breeds
My existance slowly fades, as I drown in my grief
I pray to gods of the mind, please end this life of mine...

Calling out: "Rid this god you sent..."

[Lead: Steffan]

The realm is all that remains
Between me and my dying dreams
Inside I search for the domain
That might hear my pleads
You sing at my funeral as I lie In the ground deceased
Eternal misery I finally unleashed

[Lead: Dennis]

Take me there - show me the way

[Lead: Dennis]

My eyes they stare - alone I wither away

In misery I dwell, far beyond the point of life
I beg you end my existance, I kneel before the god I strive

In misery I forever.... dwell...

Rotting - I leave this world
I won't return - I'll remains in your minds...
