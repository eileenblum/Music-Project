I am your lost life, the one that slipped away
You are no longer mortal and in dreams astray...

Do not mourn
Do not cry tears of grief
See me fly
As I cross horizons

"And god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes
And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow
Nor crying. Neither shall there be any more pain,
For all the former things are passed away..."

You lie six feet under and only dust remains
Take these angels wings and we can fly into the
Heavenly kingdom

Fly on your wings across horizons
Denied by the mortal man, slowly lose existence
Images of fields, fields of infinity
Waiting for the one to reap the harvest

I am your lost life, the one that slipped away
