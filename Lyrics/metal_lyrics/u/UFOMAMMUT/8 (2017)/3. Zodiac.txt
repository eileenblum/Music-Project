All is nothing and nothing is all like an endless loop of time: circle
Time is running wild and loud a storm of sand within a hand: circle
Hands are gathering our life a sudden now in a vast wide time: circle
All is nothing and nothing is all like an endless loop of time: circle
Turn and turn and turn around the tree of life
Turn and turn and turn around a setting cold black sun
