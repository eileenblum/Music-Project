Out of chaos holy flame burn the sky touch the stars
You heat the stars tower to the sun toward the sky you rule the universe
Sky of the sky seal of the sea heart of the earth humanity divine
You are the sky you are the sea arise from earth you gail of the universe
You star that burns from earth to sky you blood and love you knowledge to deny
You essence of being chaos in the sky
