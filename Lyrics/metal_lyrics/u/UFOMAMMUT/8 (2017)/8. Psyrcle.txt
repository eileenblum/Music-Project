There's no beauty if there's not decay
There's no past without a present
There's no light without awareness
There's no power without fury
There's no love without denial
There's no death if there's no waiting
Emptiness circles the abyss
Abyss turns into a small grain
Grain unwraps itself into sky
Sky dissolves itself into emptiness
All is inside itself opposite the equal nothing turns into all all is just my mind
