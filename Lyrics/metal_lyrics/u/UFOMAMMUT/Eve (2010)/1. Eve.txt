Divine soul in silence deep labyrinths You womb of time
Geometry echo of space in Your hands is everything
Land of God where You lie stir Your soul with the stars
Words of lightr fill Your mind knowledge is a godlike snake
Black skies creep in
Water, fire and ground around You
Blinded pure moon You realize the Word of it all
You Eclipse You fall out of the eternal
God eyed
You cry while biting wisdom
Evil truns Good and Good turns Evil
God eyed
You fight to give Man knowledge
Like God You arise defying your maker
God eyed
You feel how empty is it all
Truths slides in Your heart
You set for life pure seed of light
Divine dark soul realized the real spell of it all
