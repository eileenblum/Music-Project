Maintain your father's laws
The land around me turns to grey
I don't know if I can follow you all
Man shows his faith man falls from grace
You walk in heaven
I await in endless
Hollow be thy name thy soul

And the angels come marching on out of graves
I'm sorry for all the victims cold
Your life just turns to old
You walk in heaven
I await in endless
Hollow be thy name thy soul
And the angels come marching on out of graves
I'm sorry for all the victims cold
Your life just turns to old
You enter your life with purpose for kings
Walking your path for purpose of this
This is your mission my son
Rise up yes
Rise from your grave show the world
I am the one who calls your name
I am the war who follows him
I am the one who falls from grace
Your host is a host of dreams and distant shadows
Your host is a host of host I'll be forever cold
Your host is a host of dreams and distant shadows
Rise
Maintain your father's laws
The land around me turns to grey
I don't know if I can follow you all
Man shows his faith man falls from grace
You walk in heaven
I await in endless
My father your father our father
Left you cold
