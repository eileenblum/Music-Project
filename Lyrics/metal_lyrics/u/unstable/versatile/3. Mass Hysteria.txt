Take it back
How you want to take it all away
We have no choice it's our territory
Why should we trust them
Why should we believe their lies
They write the books and write the laws
We vote their ways can't stop us now

Are we proud of what we're today
All the bullshit n all the lies
When we have to step to the plate
Will you represent u.s.
Mutha fuckas wanna be like me
I am my own way
If you really want me
Come and find your way
Mutha fuckas wanna be like me
I am my own way
They give me the skills
Now watch the blood spill
In the pit of the u.n.s.a. world
Fuck
Look at this world of shit
And the way we live
I'm not saying it's your fault
But you're not fucking helping
Mass hysteria leaves my mind in blur
Give us back the peace give us back our life
Everything seems to change when you have the pen
Now I have the pen what should I say
Should I say anything at all
Ask your god and there's the answer
Laying in the lions den
You're full of lies
Is my territory worth all this
My angel of death taking all of it
My mass hysteria
My world
Fuck
Look at this world of shit
And the way we live
I'm not saying it's your fault
But you're not fucking helping
Mass hysteria leaves my mind in blur
Give us back the peace
Give us back our life
If you don't like peace
Then just kill us all
With your war games
Mass hysteria
