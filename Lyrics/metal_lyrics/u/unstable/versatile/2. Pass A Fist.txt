Pass a fist through your face
Feel these scripts of ancient war
I believe I believe I believe
He sits once more
In these veins in these veins in these veins
His seed was born
I believe in I believe him I believe

He sits once more
Like god pass away
Like god all the way
Like god pass away
I'm god all the way
So so so so so
You wanna live my lifestyle
Never seen a trick
You never seen a trap house
Up on that block where we hold kid
I'll fucking show you gangstar
I lived it I breed it I've bared it
I'm fucking up now
So you think you
Can handle a situation like me
But you think you can handle a situation like me
Ima live my life not the way you live
Ima live my life just the way I live
Ima live my life not the way you live
Ima live my life not the way I live
Pass a fist through your face
Feel these scripts of ancient lords
I believe I believe I believe
He sits once more
In these veins in these veins in these veins
His seed was born
I believe in I believe him I believe
He sits once more
