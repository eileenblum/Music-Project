Discipline is what they lack you say.
Open your mind.
All we lack these days is not what it seems.
Open your mind they wash your mind.
Open your eyes they wash your mind.

29 feet.. 29 feet...29 feet to go.
That's where I live.
That's where I'm from.
Since the days that Brooklyn was won.
Since the days of mass hysteria.
This is my heart this is my pain.
I call you all for treason.
This is my mind this is my pain.
You had no right or reason.
Bombing our world bombing our land for greed.
Giving us death in your ecstasy.
I'll ask you... I'll ask you... Why is the earth not safe for man.

I know you're fucking with us.
I know you're haunting U.S.
Your master plan was devised.
You think where worthless entities.
Lives! Lives! They wash U.S. over again.
Come wash U.S. over again.
So wash U.S. over again.
So why shall we hide our feelings inside.
There's no place to hide.
Bombing our planet and leaving it dry.
Why all the lives.
They wash U.S. over again.
29ft is the way to god... Surrender your soul.
All the people of the world... Not in between.
Open your eyes... They wash your mind.
Open your eyes... They wash your mind.

This is my heart this is my pain.
I'll call you all for treason.
This is the mind. This is the pain.
You have no right or reason.
Bombing our lands bombing the world for greed.
Giving us death in your ecstasy.
I'll show you... I'll show you... Where the fuck you'll be in the end.
Witness... Weaken... Down... The End
