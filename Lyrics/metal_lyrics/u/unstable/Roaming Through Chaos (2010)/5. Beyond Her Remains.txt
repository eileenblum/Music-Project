Witness. Murder case. Lost. Dust.
Beyond the wake.
Beyond the pearly gates.
There lies a realm...a realm that lays to rest.
Witness. Murder case. Lost. Dust.
Beyond the wake.
Beyond the gates of Ule.
There lies a realm  a realm that waits on you.

I live between.
Here in your slave-nation.
Here on your soft sand.
I corrode with  Nations.
Lost.

Beyond her remains.
A world full of sacrifice.
Her flesh remains.
Food for the neo ghouls.

Beyond Her Remains.
World full of sacrifice.
Her flesh remains.
Food for the neo ghoul.

I remain the same.
(Lost) 
And her flesh remains.
(Dust)
And your soul remains.
(Lost)
There's no path to your future.
(Immortal)
And your flesh remains.
(Lost)
There's no path to your future.
Dust.

I remain the same.
There goes my future.
Her flesh remains.
While the Gods they feed on you.

So watch what you say  you just might get pushed back.
Back to the days and back to the dust.
I'm from that block where you just might get pushed back.
Back to the days and back to the sun.
So watch what you say  you just might get pushed back son!

I'm from this strange reality.
The one that turns to dust.
Her flesh a strange reality.
It all will turn to dust.

So watch what you say  you just might get pushed back.
Back to the days and back to the dust. 
I'm from that block where you just might get pushed back.
Back to the days and back to the sun.
So watch what you say, you just might get pushed back son!

I'm from this strange reality.
The one that turns to dust.
Her flesh a strange reality.
It all just turns to dust.
I'll walk thru.
I'll feed you.
It all will turn to dust.
Food.
