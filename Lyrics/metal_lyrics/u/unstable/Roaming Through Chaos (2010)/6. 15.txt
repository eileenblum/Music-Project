I knew a killer who was doing his own thing.
Doing his own thing  doing his own slang.
He turned around and his ass got shot!
Hex, Hex, Hex, your day.

Up on the block like nonstop to Ciro.
Smoke dro.
Let's go.
Get mo money if you can man.
Just stick to the plan.
Or stick to your man.
Or end up deep in the sand.

I am the rage.
We're breaking all the laws.
Your hiding in a constant fear.
The shadow over comes.
Violence &amp; emptiness.
Your shadow is a constant threat.
No pleasant smiles. You re gonna fall.
We're breaking all the laws.
Burning thru your veins.
To rot in the grave is better than to live.

Year I've fallen for this grace.
Mankind can't see what's in your mind.
You betrayed U.S.for this life of the dead.
Why should I live.
Why should I feed into all your bullshit
We are the rage.
We're breaking all the laws.
We fall into an open state.
We're burning down the walls.
Violence and emptiness.
You can't escape the void.
Your worthiness. Your constant hate.
We're burning down the walls.
Burning thru the veins.
To Rot in the grave is better than to live.
