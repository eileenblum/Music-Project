First you gotta roll that shit.
Then you gotta  light that shit.
Then you gotta pass that shit.

Get high.

I wake up to find a seed.
I plant her in the ground.
My harvest rise.
I thank the the skies.
No worries for my crown.
Give U.S. the Green.
Show me the Queen.
She's the one you want.
The people cry.
I thank the sky.
Who wants to smoke a blunt.

She smells so sweet she'll make you weak.
She smells so good she'll makes you weak.
She smells so sweet she'll make you weak.
She smells so sweet she'll make you weak.
Is she all you'll ever need?
White widows into my bowl.
That's how I spell relief.
I catch a fire burn away.
I got to hail the leaf.
Northern lights. That pale blue sky. Come burn me in the streets.
That sour deiz whoa baby please &amp; don't you ever leave.
Roll it up. Pack it up. Burn me as you please.
My harvest rise. I thank the skies. We got to burn a leaf.
I wake up to find a seed. I plant her in the ground.
My harvest rise. I thank the sky. We're burning up the town.

I get high...I get stoned. Let's go!
And we're so lifted.
It heals your mind.

She smells so sweet she'll make you weak.
She smells so sweet she'll make you weak.
Smells so sweet it makes you weak.
She is all that makes you weak.
She is all you'll ever need.
