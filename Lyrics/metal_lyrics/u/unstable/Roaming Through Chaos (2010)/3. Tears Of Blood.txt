I see you out there swinging.
Mosh pit is full of blood.
I hear the ancient calling.
Out from the sky above.
Oh father don't save me.
Don't save me from these cares.
The axe is falling in these tears of blood.
They laugh at your crown.
They step on your throne.
Burning villages down.

Rise to the edge of your feet.
Stand for your kingdom and conquer the globe.
I have the angel of death down by the river.
Open the flood gates. Enter your world.
I am the angel that walks with the science.
Enters your kingdom.
Opens the flood gates and conquers your world.

This our lives crucified a dread once more.
There goes my life.
There goes my pride.
There's goes my skills.
Not just your focus on me.
Not your fantasies.
Focus on what you will love.
Death from above.
Is burning out.
It's not what you fear.
It's not your full time tears.
It's not it's not your wars.
Death's for sure.
Is for sure  Is For Sure... in your life. 
Enter the lands of liars and thieves.
Fuel the fire. Your open greed.
This is so you can just claim for your child.

Watch as the laugh at your crown.
Watch how they step on your throne.
Burning the villages down.

The crown. The crown.
The children laugh and cheer.
Burn. Burn. Then the children rot this name.

Now you learn to realize the straight the straight of your word.
To rot this name. Father-less nations burn.
How you were born in a barnyard.
Now you were built on a cross.
Now you learn to realize the straight the straight of your word .
To rot this name. Father-less nations burn.
To rot. To live. To rot. To give. To bathe in these tears of blood.
