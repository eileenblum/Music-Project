The cold one I am
Veins frozen to death
To rise, to fall is mine
See her shine

My frozen heart
My frozen soul
To learn
To see her burn

Give me sanctuary
Sanctuary from the sun
I don't wanna be hurt no more
I stand alone, I'm the one
The one who stands alone
The sun is mine, she's not?!

Give me sanctuary
Sanctuary from the sun
I don't wanna be burned no more
No place to hide
Forever she will shine
Forever she will burn
