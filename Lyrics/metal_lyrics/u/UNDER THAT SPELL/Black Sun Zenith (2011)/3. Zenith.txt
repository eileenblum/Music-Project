Lone silence
Will be my grave
Under the rocks and roots
But above the Surface of day
Day

We are two - within
Frozen World - burning skin
We unite under your wind
We unite under your wind

My time
Is over
Ours is about to come
Guidance is: none
None

We are two - within
Frozen World - burning skin
We unite under your wind
We unite under your wind

Despair
Shine
Ruler
We die

Far above
The surface of day
We shine
As rulers
We die
Die

Die
Shine
We die
Die
