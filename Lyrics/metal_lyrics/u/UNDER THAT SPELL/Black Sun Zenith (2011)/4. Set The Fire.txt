You
Face the night
The night
I am mirrored by
You
Compose the storms around
To hide 
You
Force within the night
Abscondence
Inside

I set the fire
Snakes of Christ

You
Crown of bloodshed
Exiled from light
You
Dark and vigilant
Cover and gate
You
The heart and hunter
My merciless mate

I set the fire
Snakes of Christ
I set the fire
Snakes of Christ
Anaesthetised
In nights of these
You cannot hide
In nights of these
You cannot hide
I set the fire
Snakes of Christ
Fire
