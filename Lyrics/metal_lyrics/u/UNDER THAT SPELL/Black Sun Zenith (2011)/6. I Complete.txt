Craving of flesh
Wolf in the night
To rise above her

She blinds my eyes
Target exclusive
Victim alone
I

Strongest soul
I hunt you down
Pity unknown

To satisfy
My hunger is sin
Victim alone I

Paralysed nature
Weak as you are
Lost in this shame
Reason none
Feel the pain
The reward for me
Your true son I am
I complete
I complete
