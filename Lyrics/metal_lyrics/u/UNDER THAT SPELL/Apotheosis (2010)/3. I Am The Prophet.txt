Fieriness delivers me from snarly dreams
Visionary alien fields
Journeys through astral dimensions
Colourless intense
Not yet entirely awake
I stare into sardonic mist,
The nothingness

Tumbling between fear and fascination
What happened here again?

Wandering on alleys unknown
I searched for my territory
New dimly spheres of total surreality
Thou, who is out of borders with me
Find god's own prefiguration
And let's come across in meditation

I am the prophet
Beholder of what lies within
To conquer long forgotten lands
My nativeness with native hands

Dormancy creeps over me anew
Falling into my deeper self
Only pure volition causes
Metamorphosis

I am the prophet

I am the prophet
Beholder of what lies within
To conquer long forgotten lands
My nativeness with native hands

Volition and invalidation
Of illusionary human ideas,
Tradition and modern spheres

I am the prophet
Beholder of what lies within
To conquer long forgotten lands
My nativeness with native hands
