...And in the beginning
There was a child
Thrown into existence
Dull and infantile
Imprisoned in a pall
Of putrefying flesh
Not yet really living
Already burnt to ash

Called into existence
To be without calling
Inaptness is the shackle
Dooming me to live
Left without any senses
I even Lack the lust
To hate those godless beings
That made me crawl through dust

Accept, my sister
I am the most powerful
My last creation
Will overstrain you!
Accept, my sister
I am the greatest god
My last creation
Is senseless...

Unable to speak
Unable to smell
Unable to see
Unable to hear
Unable to feel

You tore my skin

Accept, my sister
You forfeit our rivalry
My last creation
Overstrain you!
Accept, my sister
I am the greatest god!
My last creation
Is senseless...
