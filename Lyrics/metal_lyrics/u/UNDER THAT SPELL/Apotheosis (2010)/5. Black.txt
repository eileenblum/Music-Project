What is black to you?

Hollow of negativity
Dragged into dark poisoned gravity
Covering the light
I send the signs

This is my effect
This one goes out
To the black souled
Black minded
Black
This one goes out
To the black souled
Black minded
Black
Choose your way

A slight feel of confusion
Your blackness might be illusion
What covers the light
Might be innocence in white

This is my effect
This one goes out
To the black souled
Black minded
Black
This one goes out
To the black souled
Black minded
Black

You fall without intention
But I intended my sign
You carry my purified reflexion
On banners hold up high

I
I intended my sign
Without
Without banners in the sky

What is black for you?

Choose your way
