You will never spell my name
Your imprisoned in my word

I returned on paths
Beyond all sanity
I enthroned myself
Creating the garden of feeding

You will never spell my name
You're imprisoned in...

...The world I gave
Created for slaves
Obey my name
You will never know
You will never speak

I jaunt through fields
Beyond your sanity
Enthroned by the name
Guiding your hand

You will never spell my name
You're imprisoned in...

...The world I gave
Created for slaves
Obey my name
You will never know
You will never spell

Every single drop
Of human blood
Saturates the nere
On which my name thrives
On which my name thrives

The world I gave
Created for slaves
Obey my name
You will never know
You will never speak

The world I gave
Created for slaves
Obey my name
You will never know
You will never spell
