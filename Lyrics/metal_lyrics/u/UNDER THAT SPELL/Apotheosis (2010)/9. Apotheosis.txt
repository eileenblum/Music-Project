King of all kings
Not like one before
Full of wit
And striving for divinity

Mightiness is increasing

Light
Sun

My light shall not be frozen
My light shall rise to sun
My light shall not be frozen
Reaching for height

His past dominion
No need for kings
To rule above all
To rule above all

Light
Sun

My light shall not be frozen
My light shall rise to sun
My light shall not be frozen
Reaching for height

When soon,
Death will cause our fall
You will remain as a king
But I rise to god
