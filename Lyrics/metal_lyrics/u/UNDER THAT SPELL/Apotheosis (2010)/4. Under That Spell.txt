This is my crown
I lived and reigned with
For decades
I was formed by its spirit
This is no dominion
Tortured my nameless men
For decades
This sign will be mine

Is this insanity?
Fear old kings' philosophy
I hate with sightless eyes
I deny my cosmis ties

And this is what I found!
Sources of mental waste
Ruins upon graves
For what I am above?
For decades
Under that spell

Is this insanity?
Fear old kings' philosophy
I hate with sightless eyes
I deny my cosmis ties

For decades
Under that spell
