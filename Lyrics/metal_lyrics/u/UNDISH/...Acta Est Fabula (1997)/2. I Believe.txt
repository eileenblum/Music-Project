I believe in God and people.
I believe in reason and soul. But I ask myself - is it possible?
Who has seen the soulful knowledge?
So much man has already destroyed.
So much he has squandered.
I still believe and I still love.
I want to run away from day to day routine to break the binding bonds.
I still believe.
The world kills thinking people, destroys them with its violence,
cuts off their return, oppresses them with its utopia.
I believe in God and people. I believe in reason and soul.
