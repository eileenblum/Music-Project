I'm sorry on my behalf and of many others for weakness, betrayal and evil.
I'm sorry for sinful thoughts, for my words and deeds.
I dare to ask for the order in the world and the paradise for all.
Forgive me Lord if it's the pride that actuates me.
But my thoughts are clouded with what the world offers to me.

I'm sorry for my soul and my world for what I praise and what I hate.

I'm sorry for being torn between the
Word and the Mind for the lack of faith in your masterpiece.
