Faith is the turning point in the life of the truly believing.
Is power, providence, the only mainstain?
It's primeral, weak and young although nobody remembers its birth.
The sea of blood was shed in its name.
Many thoughts and desires were smothered.
So much happiness and goodness was destroyed.
Yet life showed - Faith marked with blood and suffering is frail and dirty.
Is weak and untrue.
Today again the name of God Is supposed to obscure the Truth.
Today again the faith is supposed to cover human eyes.
But nobody sees it. Nobody feels it like hearts of those who truly believe.
Life will convey the Truth in the Book of History.
