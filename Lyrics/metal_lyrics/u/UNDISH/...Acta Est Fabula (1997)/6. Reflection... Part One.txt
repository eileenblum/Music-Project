Human personality is shaped by the world's reality.
It's made up of racial and national conflicts that poison the whole world.
Violence already from the dawn of time is both the cause and the result.
It's an infinite value, inspiring not only the common mortals,
but also the skilled professors of Evil.
Worldwide conflicts took a heavy toll on thousands of human lives.
The memory of them is the possibility to keep the problem alive.
It's also an ideal pretext to instill the power of destruction into people.
Lack of ideals contributes to breaking God's Commandments,
even by those who preach them. It gives the occasion to conceive such absurdities
like the fight for peace. Death has become the simplest of the possible solutions.
