When the grey walls of the room and sad Jesus on the Cross.
When the dirty days of my life hard as a rock.
When there's little happiness in reality.
When hearts are small and small is the rose in the window.
I'm afraid of myself of my thoughts and feelings.
Time passes, pain cools down and small is the rose in the window.
