Someone told that faith made strong.
Someone told that Jesus had died on the cross.
He suffered for me to live.
For me to suffer for the others.
God, the infinite, the Adored of a hundred names.
Guide your creatures and give them the positive power.
Give the reason and the objective thought to make me want to be what You want me to be.
