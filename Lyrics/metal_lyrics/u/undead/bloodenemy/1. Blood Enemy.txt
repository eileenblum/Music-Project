Architect of your own emptiness
Builder of the fake world of clay
Poisoned by the venom of your selfishness
Cursed to be the Lord with cage of bone and flesh

Freedom and Chaos, the only law
The furious blasphemous Fallen Star
The truth dies with your burning tongue
Loneliness is the price of being a wolf

Let my enemies devour each other
Blood feeds the seeds of hate

Beware! Priest, liar
Your faith is digging your own grave
Behold the fire!
Cremator of flesh, blood and bone
Beware your wishes
They may become real

Architect of your own emptiness
Builder of the fake world of clay
Poisoned by the venom of your selfishness
Cursed to be the Lord with cage of bone and flesh

Let my enemies devour each other
Blood feeds the seeds of hate
