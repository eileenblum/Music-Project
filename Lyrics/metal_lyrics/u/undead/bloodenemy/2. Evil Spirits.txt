Ascending my soul far beyond the black holes
Leaving my sick cells and shinning
with the light of Hell
No time, no matter, in ecstasy of decay
Melting where thy scaled one eats himself
Hideous fall of delusion walls
Towards glory as grave is full of worms

Blessed by the Snake and cursed by the light
Evil spirits obey no one!
Blinded by the sun I'm crawling in the night
Without a bloodline
The hunting has begun
Guardian of truth in a world of lies
From the wide womb of uncreated night
Feel the ever-burning sulfur
Spreading the disease

Horror! I am here to torment you
Terror! I came back to haunt you
Now I am one with darkness
Now you are one with dead

Rotten scent in the coffin of your head
Swallowed by darkness by the jaws of fate
The place where freedom dwells
To die hating them
