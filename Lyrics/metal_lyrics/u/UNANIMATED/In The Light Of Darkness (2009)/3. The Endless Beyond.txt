I DRINK THIS WINE
THE GRAPES OF DEATH
THE BLACK BLOOD OF VENOMOUS EVIL
THE FOUNTAIN OF THE BLACK LIGHT
HEAR THESE WORDS
THAT SPEAK OF THE END
THESE ECHOING WORDS OF DAMNATION
AND THIS WORLD LIES DEAD

EYES OF DARKNESS, VISIONS OF DEATH
VOICE OF TRIUMPH, TONGUE OF DECAY

BREAK THE BOUNDS OF FLESH AND BLOOD
BURNING VISIONS TO END ALL LIFE
FEEL THE FIRESTORMS BURN
BURN ME TO THE END

LORD OF DARKNESS, PRINCE OF DEATH
ILLUMINATE ME OF YOUR DARKNESS AND

MIGHT
EMBRACE ME NOW WINGS OF PLAGUE
LEAD ME NOW INTO THE ENDLESS BEYOND

AS I ENTER, WHERE NO LIFE DARE
DANCING IN ECSTACY, CHANTING TONGUES
AS I ENTER, WHERE NO LIFE DWELLS
BURNING AS I FALL, CHANTING GLORY
CHANTING GLORY

LORD OF DARKNESS, PRINCE OF DEATH
ILLUMINATE ME OF YOUR DARKNESS AND

MIGHT
EMBRACE ME NOW WINGS OF PLAGUE
LEAD ME NOW INTO THE ENDLESS BEYOND

BREAK THE BOUNDS OF FLESH AND BLOOD
BURNING VISIONS TO END ALL LIFE
FEEL THE FIRESTORMS BURN
BURN ME TO THE END

I DRINK THIS WINE
THE GRAPES OF DEATH
THE BLACK BLOOD OF VENOMOUS EVIL
THE FOUNTAIN OF THE BLACK LIGHT
HEAR THESE WORDS
THAT SPEAK OF THE END
THESE ECHOING WORDS OF DAMNATION
AND THIS WORLD LIES DEAD

LORD OF DARKNESS, PRINCE OF DEATH
ILLUMINATE ME OF YOUR DARKNESS AND

MIGHT
EMBRACE ME NOW WINGS OF PLAGUE
LEAD ME NOW INTO THE ENDLESS BEYOND
