AS A GOD I CAME FORTH UPON A WORLD OF

FLAMES
LIKE A FUCKING BEAST I CONQUERED THE

BEAUTY
MY COLD BLACK TONGUE SPOKE OF DARK

AND HUNGER
THE BLOOD OF MY MOUTH, DEMONS...

MAYHEM... MAN!

RETURN OF MAYHEM, FINAL DAMNATION
DIVIDE ET IMPERA, WORLD OF FLAMES
DARKNESS ETERNAL, ENEMY OF THE SUN
SOULS OF BLACKNESS, WORLD OF FLAMES

THE MOON IS GUIDING ME TO THE OTHER

SIDE
THE FLAMES ARE LEADING ME I ENTER THE

DARK
I AM THE DEMONS SEED I CONQUERED THE

BEAUTY
WINGS OF DEATH CARRY ME UPON A WORLD

OF... MASSACRE

[Lead: Ramstedt]

RETURN OF CHAOS, DARKNESS ETERNAL
WORLD OF FLAMES

RETURN OF MAYHEM, FINAL DAMNATION
DIVIDE ET IMPERA, WORLD OF FLAMES
DARKNESS ETERNAL, ENEMY OF THE SUN
SOULS OF BLACKNESS, WORLD OF FLAMES
