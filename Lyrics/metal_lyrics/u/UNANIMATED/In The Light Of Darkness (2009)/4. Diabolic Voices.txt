NIGHTSIDE!
ENDLESS NIGHTSIDE
ABODE OF MARVELS WITHOUT END
THROUGH BLOOD AND ANCIENT SORCERY
I JOURNEY INTO YOUR MYSTERY

A DARKNESS VAST
THAT GOD HIMSELF DOES FEAR
IN THAT DARKNESS
I HEAR THEM CLEAR
VOICES......
VOICES FROM THE DARK PAST
SO FAR BEYOND, SO FAR BELOW

IN TONGUES, THEY'RE CALLING
THE DEAD, THE FALLEN
THE CURSED ONES, THE ENEMY
FROM THE DARK, THEY'RE CALLING ME

SHAPELESS, YET I SEE THEM
POSSESSED AS IF IN A TRANCE
DEMONS, MALFORMATIONS
BACKWARDS, IN SPASMS THEY DANCE

[Lead: Ramstedt]

DEATH, THEIR ONE INTENTION
BLACK DEATH! IN ALL DIMENSIONS
A CALL TO ARMS TO ALL OF THOSE
WHOSE HEARTS BEAT NOT TO FOLLOW
BUT TO OPPOSE!

IN TONGUE'S, WE'RE CALLING
THE DEAD, THE FALLEN
THE CURSED ONES, THE ENEMY
FROM THE DARK, WE'RE CALLING THEE

I SHAKE AND I TREMBLE
NOT WITH FEAR BUT PRIDE
AS I RAISE MY BLADE
TOWARDS THE SKY
TO CURSE THE WORLD
AND ALL IT'S WEIGHT.
THAT SOON WE SHALL MEET
ITS FLAMING FATE...FATE!
