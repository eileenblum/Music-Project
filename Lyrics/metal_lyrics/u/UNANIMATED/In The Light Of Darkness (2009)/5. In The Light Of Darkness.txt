RELEASE ME NOW, SET ME FREE
FROM THESE BONDS OF FLESH AND BLOOD
BREAK ITS CHAIN, MELT ITS EXISTENCE
RID ME FROM THE FOUL STENCH OF LIFE
I HAIL THE BLACK, THAT HAUNTS THE

LIGHT
THE CALL FOR THE MORBID, SO COLD
I ABJURE THE WAYS OF CHRIST
(IN THE NAME OF) LUCIFER, I KISS THE

GOAT!

YOUR WEALTH INSIDE ME
AND ALL YOUR GLORY AND MIGHT
DEVOUR THE SUN
AND KILL ALL LIFE

IN THE LIGHT OF DARKNESS
MY SPIRIT IS SET FREE
IN THE LIGHT OF DARKNESS
SHADOWS AND FLAMES
IN THE LIGHT OF DARKNESS
MY SPIRIT IS SET FREE
IN THE LIGHT OF DARKNESS
IN THE SHADOW OF THE BLACK STAR

BLACK FLAMES, DANCING BEFORE ME
SALVATION OF BURNING STORMS
FROM DEEP BELOW, THE WINDS BLOW
INHALE THE SCENT OF DEATH
SUFFOCATE, STRANGLE, AND STAB
THE CENTER OF DIVINITY
WITH FEAR GOD TREMBLES
(AS THE) BLACK HEART LEGION RISE

YOUR WEALTH INSIDE ME
AND ALL YOUR GLORY AND MIGHT
DEVOUR THE SUN
AND KILL ALL LIFE

IN THE LIGHT OF DARKNESS
MY SPIRIT IS SET FREE
IN THE LIGHT OF DARKNESS
SHADOWS AND FLAMES
IN THE LIGHT OF DARKNESS
MY SPIRIT IS SET FREE
IN THE LIGHT OF DARKNESS
IN THE SHADOW OF THE BLACK STAR

RELEASE ME NOW, SET ME FREE
FROM THESE BONDS OF FLESH AND BLOOD
BREAK ITS CHAIN, MELT ITS EXISTENCE
RID ME FROM THE FOUL STENCH OF LIFE
I HAIL THE BLACK, THAT HAUNTS THE

LIGHT
THE CALL FOR THE MORBID, SO COLD
I ABJURE THE WAYS OF CHRIST
LUCIFER, I KISS THE GOAT!

YOUR WEALTH INSIDE ME
AND ALL YOUR GLORY AND MIGHT
DEVOUR THE SUN
AND KILL ALL LIFE

IN THE LIGHT OF DARKNESS
MY SPIRIT IS SET FREE
IN THE LIGHT OF DARKNESS
SHADOWS AND FLAMES
IN THE LIGHT OF DARKNESS
MY SPIRIT IS SET FREE
IN THE LIGHT OF DARKNESS
IN THE SHADOW OF THE BLACK STAR
