BLOOD IS RAINING DOWN ON MY FACE
HUNGRY FLAMES ARE LICKING MY SKIN
ANGRY SHADOWS AWAITS MY SOUL
MORBID SERPENTS CRAWLS FROM WITHIN

PURE FIRE WITH TRUE AND SIMPLE

DESIRES
WANTS ME TO RIDE THE FLAMES OF

ETERNITY
I FOLLOW THE WINDS OF THE SERPENTS

CURSE
TO THE END OF ALL LIFE, WHERE I WILL

BE BORN...BORN!

SERPENT OF THE FIRE
SERPENT OF DESIRE

ENSHRINED BY DARK, I WILL ALWAYS BURN
FOREVER CURSED, IN THE FLAMES OF

ETERNITY

TREACHEROUS AS THE DARK SHADOWS OF

BLOOD
THE LIGHT DIES AND DARK IS IMMORTAL
WHERE EVIL DWELLS AND WHISPERS

DAMNATION
OH CURSED ONE, LET ME SEE...

HELLFIRE!

SERPENT OF THE FIRE
SERPENT OF DESIRE

I FOLLOW THE FLAMES OF THE SERPENTS

CURSE
TO THE END OF ALL LIFE, THERE I SHALL

REBORN
WHERE EVIL DWELLS AND CALL UPON

DAMNATION
SERPENTS OF HELL, FOREVER I SHALL

BURN
I SHALL RETURN!

FOREVER CURSED, I WILL ALWAYS BURN
SERPENTS OF FIRE, TONGUES OF ETERNAL

FLAMES
FOREVER CURSED, IN THE FIRES OF

ETERNITY
SERPENTS OF THE FIRE, I WILL

ALWAYS... BURN!
