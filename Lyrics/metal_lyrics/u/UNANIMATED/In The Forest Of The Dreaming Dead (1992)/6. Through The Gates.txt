Black clouds in the sky opening my eyes
Dark reflections dancing before me
Light of the moon caressing the sky
The air that I breathe is so coldâ¦ so cold!

Through the gatesâ¦ evil ways
The darkened worldâ¦. grips my soul

Flying away with the wings of death
Enter the hellish timeless begin
Blackened grave awaits my flesh
A sinful mists sweeps around me

Moonlight blazing
Like fire in the sky
In a stream of darkness
I float awayâ¦

Through the gatesâ¦ blasphemous ways
The darkened worldâ¦. grips my soul
Through the gatesâ¦
