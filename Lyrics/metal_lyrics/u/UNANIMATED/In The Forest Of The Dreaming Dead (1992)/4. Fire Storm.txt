into the blackness i fall
visions so dark in my mind they call
chaos scream chaos dream in my
voyage through the flames
into my flesh they crawl
emotional lust to taste the sin
claws tearing through my soul i
cried take me down to hell...
wickedness by my side
sin and lust bowdown before me
storms of fire takes me away...
i fall from above
through the sky
thrown away
into the blackness
black jaws hunts me through the
halls of never ending pain
in pain of the realways to my
voyage through the flames
calls of rise in my glaceless
fallen ways
into the storms screams pull out my eyes
black roars hunts me to the
halls of never ending flames
a flame full of fire in a stillness
but cold as night
i shall remember the cold in my
soul forever more
as the storms screams and takes
my heart bleeding away ....
