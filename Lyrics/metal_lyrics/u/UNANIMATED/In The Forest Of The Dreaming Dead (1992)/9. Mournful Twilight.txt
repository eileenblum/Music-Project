the darkest sleep in the greyish shadows
close your eyes and follow me
into the dark beyond the dreams
where the memories of life goes
by your eyes ...
you dream in fire with open soul
from those dreams you hear me scream
to wake up and to fall back
for thou who dawn will see ...
in the mournful ... twilight i grow
i shall fall as the darkness steps in ...
the eternal sleep
in all our souls
into the flames
takes my soul to the very end ...
my soul must be surrounded by darkness
in the thousand skies of age
the evil fire burns in me
my burning hate is so strong ...
(take my soul)
