through the gloomy night
the silent shadows
reach out in the cold
and teares the dawn away
my seamless mind
hears the sound
of thousand voices
whispers my name
i must find a way
from the deadly shadows
the blackened movements
in time they seek
the burning spirits
will be as the same
the glowing moonlight
reflects in my eyes
whispering ... shadows
a grotesque touch
of the dead
eclipse my way
to await me
whispering ... shadows whispers
... my name ...
