like a vision, I am drowning into time of hate
running through hedges of pain
howling wolves in a glade of sleep
lost night cries in the crack of dawn

burned out candles on a hill so close
like a vision I die among the oceans
with hands full of blood I rest in the fire
into a greyish forest, rain never ends

i travel through ... the oceans of time
                     the oceans of time

time is standing still as I awake from my journey
cold eyes floating within time as one

with a heart of the blackest coal
i travel through, I breathe through the shadows

i travels through ... the oceans of time
