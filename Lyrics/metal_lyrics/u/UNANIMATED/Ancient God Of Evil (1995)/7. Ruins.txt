ruins among laughing dreams ... so real
knowledge of a wind so old ... whispers through the dark
the taste of haunted words ... comes forth
and pleasures a night so violent ... and pure insane

statues of stone wandering
wandering among the ruins .... among us

a wind through a solitude so dark
it sleeps in a path of anguish blood
thorns of steel cries in a fire of greed
of pain it leaves the day, and takes away
rivers of stone, deserts among ... me

statues of of stone wandering
wandering among the ruins .... among me
