the silent years of helpless crying
the bridge of hate travels in my mind
beyond all the doors of gruesome hunger
I hear the threnodes, I behold

eye of the greyhound
the eye of the greyhound

the dreaming moon so bloodlike
the feeding of the never ending night

end of time
the eye of my mind

so much pain and so much losts
helpless words cries in the air

eye of the greyhound
the eye of the greyhound

the eyes inside of me
please take them away, away
away
