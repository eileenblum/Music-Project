How can I dwell
Into a dream of fear
Can't even tell if
I am awake or asleep
Can't hear myself speak or breathe
Can't see or move, can't even feel

Thirsty for pain
My hunger is cold
Dark and misty, I die alone
Thirsty for pain
My hunger is cold
Dark and misty, I die alone

Standing in, a wind of sleep
Staring in, a night so obscene
Evil cold, growing onto me
I wander in this dream of mine

Thirsty for pain
My hunger is cold
Dark and misty, I die alone
Thirsty for pain
My hunger is cold
Dark and misty, I die alone

I swallow the pain I suffer
Let me be whole, let me die
I am blind but I still see
Beautiful cold dead eyes

There I shall rest in the fire
The songs from the abyss
My hunger is eternal cold
My life is a cold stream of living pain

Thirsty for pain
My hunger is cold
Dark and misty, I die alone
Thirsty for pain
My hunger is cold
Dark and misty, I die alone

I die, I die, I die, I die, alone
I die, I die, I die, I die, alone
