when the hunger breathes in me
nothing is real as the pain I feel
in a glade so dark dreams my escape
my hate is growing: more and even more

a flame of fire deep into my eyes
i ignore the screams I hear
hungry for nothing, hungry for it all
dead calm, crying for more

the calm outside my eyes
the storms inside my mind
before the storms dead calm

as soon it came, shadows of real and dream
greyish reflects of something old and mean
the dream has ended, the pain for me is send
awake or asleep the world for me has ended
.... the world for me has ended ....

the calm outside .... (see above)
