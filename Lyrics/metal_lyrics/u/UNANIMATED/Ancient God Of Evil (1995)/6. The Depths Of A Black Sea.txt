the fire of the endless youth
bleeds in the depth of my heart
running in a dream of dying silence
in a cold and deep, frozen sea

the silent the cold and the deep
the depths of a black sea

floating through the mistery of life
in a stream of naked eyes ...
i saw the fire across my shadows
the hungry shapes of my greyish past
it howls within this ceasing mist
i shall drown in this world of greed

the silent the cold ... (see above)

the silent .... (see above)
