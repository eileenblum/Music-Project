The wolves howls in Moncayo's summit
And the snow falls covering the old Templars chapel
It sounds a prayer in All Saints day,and the fog spreads its cold hands trough the ancient medieval cementery
Where the ancient knights rest in peace

But in the Anima's Mount,there's a young girl running
under the white full moonlight
alone among dark forests of nude trees
where all the nights the deceased spirits rides...
A night in Templars Mount

Phantasmagoric spectres of warriors who reborn in the heart of nocturn silence,oppening the doors of graveyard
the spirits covered with their shrounds,awakes in this cold night
And walks throught forgotten paths like a ghosts horde

A night in the Templars mount
legends and fables are real,and under Montecayo's shade
The wolves howls once again funeral songs
Appointing a new death

Sings the Lamias into the deep forest,and a pale girl is crying in a mislaid tomb
when the spirits raise one night more
In The Templars Mount
