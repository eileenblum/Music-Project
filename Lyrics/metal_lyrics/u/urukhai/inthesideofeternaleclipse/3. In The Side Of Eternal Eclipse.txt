Comes the night to the mountains
and the winds blow among ancient forests
Where darkness raise in the crepuscle hours
And like a nocturnal sun,
the Moon spreads her mystical veils
through hills and valleys in this winter days

Witches fly in the Iberian sky towards the unholy congregation
arround ancient dolmens
witness of forgotten ceremonys
And awaking again forbbiden songs...close to the blaze
That light the Cantabric nights

We are sons of the dusk,ejectet to the dark lands
We are the race damned by de christian priests

Comes the night to the woods and the hills,
and the feeling the breath of  de horned God
We embrace the old natural cult with pagan rites
Under this dark sky
thad govern our infrahuman suffering
