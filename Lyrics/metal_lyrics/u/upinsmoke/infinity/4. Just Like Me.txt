When was the last time you though on your own?
Controlled your own actions,
And conquered unknowns?

So
Light up the bong
And sing along
Maybe you'll see
That you're just like me
Just like me
Just like me

I have been everywhere
So let's go to the stars
We're so high
We're on mars
I'll roll this J
If you'll smoke with me
If the world's fucked up
Then why aren't we?

So go,
Don't fear the unknown
The unknown
Get stoned

Far out of sight
We lurk through the night
To go take flight
Smoke rings in the moon
Light

Light up the bong
And sing along

Maybe you'll see
That you're just like me
Just like me
Just like me

I would give anything
Just to show you this happiness
To help you escape
So let's run away,
We can smoke all day
I can open your eyes
And help you see
