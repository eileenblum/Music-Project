There's an inherent ebb and flow
In teachings this life will bestow
This mortal quest we embark
Treks through the light and dark

No need to fear your emotion
It's your life's eternal devotion
To find strength through the commotion
Though life sways like the ocean

But there's no need to be afraid

Can't stay stagnant
Life's like a lesson
Wisdom waits for whoever listens
No stressing, no second guessing
Just give every second attention
With presence of mind
In time we all find
The answers in the action
What matters is your reaction

You should know that you are not alone tonight
Life can be hard, but you'll be alright
[3x]

Breathe, just breathe
You must believe

Success is not as sweet
Without tasting defeat
Fret not on what is wrong
Tough times will make you strong

The mind links with the heart
Build it up or tear it apart
But I refuse to let all the small defeats
Sum up to be the demise of me

You should know that you are not alone tonight
Life can be hard, but you'll be alright

Life wasn't made to be easy
But we only have it so briefly
We can live for more than to die
But you have to try
So come on
