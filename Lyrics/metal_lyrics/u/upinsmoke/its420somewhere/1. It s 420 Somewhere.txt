Every day
Feels just like a replay
Same shit a new way
Maybe
We'll turn things around
Just looking for a pick me up
So don't pull me down

How long will you spout off your opinion
Like i give one fuck
Got a problem?
Why don't you come
And just try to take it from me
It's in the air
It's 420 somewhere

Just the neighborhood hoodrats
We roll it fat
Got a couple Bud sacks in the back pack
Meet me out back,
Bring a 30 rack and a snack
We just wanna kick back and get fuckin'
Reeeekt

Generally
Generous degenerates
Grind it up
And we got the wrap split
We kept it lit
So come take a hit
We kept it lit
Come take a hit
[2x]
Take a hit
Catch this fade

You ignore all the facts that have come along
Fight all you want, but you are wrong
Fight all you want, but you're wrong

How long will you spout off your opinion
Like i give one fuck
Got a problem?
Why don't you come
And just try to take it from me
It's in the air
It's 420 somewhere

With open eyes and open mind
I embrace life a moment at a time
[3x]

Gather 'round
Let me show you how it's going down

Consumed by control, you've gone blind
I'm laughing as you try
Constrict my conscious state of mind
Waste your fucking time
[2x]

Deny the proof
Deny the facts
But the truth will come out
