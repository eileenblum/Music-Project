Come on! Here we go now!
We will rock the place out!
Get up! Jump the fuck up!
I canât hear your voices!

Look in my eyes, I want to see every cell of your flesh
Come on and jump!
Weâre gonna throw out the trash!

You want to say goodbye?
Fuck you! And you know why.

If you canât hear me
You will feel the vibrations
If you canât see me
You will feel I touch your eyes

If you donât want it, then go away
Get outta my sight
But if youâre down for this,
Just scream and weâll rape this night

Come on!

Donât put your hands down!
Donât breathe out
Youâve got to wait till you can shout

If you canât hear me
You will feel the vibrations
If you canât see me
You will feel I touch your eyes

If you donât want it, then go away
Get outta my sight
But if youâre down for this,
Just scream and weâll rape this night

If you want it
You will get it
You will take this from this night

Weâre going on the war and I want to see you fight
Now blow your lungs out
Scream! Weâll rape this night

Jump! (jump)
I want to see you jump (jump)
I want to feel your rage (rage)
I want to hear your voices (voice)
Come on and shout
Weâll rape this night!
