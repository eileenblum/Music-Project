I see blood on my face
Wonder if itâs mine
Iâm so terrified

Oh my god!
Am I bleeding?
Oh my dear god!

Why does everyone want to hurt me?
Do they have nothing else to do?
Will they ever leave me alone?
And let me live free!

Free

Donât punish me if I am innocent

All they want is to suppress me,
Make me feel like I am nothing.
I want to get rid of all of you!
It seems like this is the only way

Kill

Iâll punish you for all my sufferings!

Everyone hates me
I wonât let them hurt me
Must
Kill

I see blood on my face
I killed everyone
Now I can be on my own
At last.

I dance on your dead bodies
