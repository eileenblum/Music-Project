Never
Giving
Anything to you

Iâm everything youâve ever seen
In your nightmares

Iâm free â youâre not!
Iâm roaming while youâre sleeping in your dog spot
Iâm free â youâre not!
Iâll never be your friend. Iâm hostile.

Iâm looking on the Moon
You never see it.

Iâm free â youâre not!
Iâm roaming while youâre sleeping in your dog spot
Iâm free â youâre not!
Iâll never be your friend.

Look in my eyes!
Do you see friend?
Never!

Iâm free â youâre not!
Iâm roaming while youâre sleeping in your dog spot
Iâm free â youâre not!
Iâll never be your friend.
Iâm Hostile!

No cages
No leashes
No treats
Freedom
