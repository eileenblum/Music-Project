I am with you.
Holding you tight.
Listening to your heart
I am with you
Waiting until you leave me alone.

When Iâm with you
Iâm always looking for a way to run
Away from you.
It makes you cry.
When Iâm with you
Iâm always thinking of another place
To hide from you
To make you waiting for me

When Iâm alone
Iâm paralyzed
Iâm dreaming of you
When Iâm alone
Iâm waiting till you come around

I am alone
Even when I feel your breath
And when youâre gone
Iâm always waiting
I am alone.
You cannot understand me
Now you can go
I will stand here waiting

I always want to be alone
I always want to be with you

I want to be alone
I always wanted!
I want to be with you
Youâve cut my heart to pieces.

Iâll be waiting
