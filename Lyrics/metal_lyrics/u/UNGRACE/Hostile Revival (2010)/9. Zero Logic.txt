When your attention is taken by someone beautiful and smart, you often make some decisions without giving a job to your brain. Later, when you wake up from your pink dreams, you realize what have you done.
Mostly, it doesnât matter.
But sometimes you sweat shit while recalling the events of yesterday
This state of mind can be called âZero logicââ¦

You get up and nod to your beautiful interlocutor
Then It wakes up.

Zerological beast creeps out of your brain and makes its way to the cords

You canât resist It, It makes you say,
And you say âyesâ

Zerological creature now can go to your heart and wait till you wake up from your pink dreams

It made itâs jobâ¦
Now It can take a restâ¦

Sleeping and dreaming of sweet hormones
Waiting till your mind will wake up from the pheromone dreams

Sleeping and waiting of sweet molasses of shame
Waiting till you stop and feed it!

Hush, hush, donât wake it up
You can live while Itâs

Sleeping and dreaming of sweet hormones
Waiting till your mind will wake up from the pheromone dreams

Sleeping and waiting of sweet molasses of shame
Waiting till you stop and feed it!

Zero
Logic
