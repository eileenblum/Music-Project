I woke up in the early morning
But I couldnât see the light
I rose my hands and touched my face
I felt the tie on my eyes

Oh God, what happened to me?
The yesterdayâs hiding in a fog
I stretched my minds to catch it
But suddenly I heard someoneâs moaning outside!

I cannot see anything
Paws of fear are gripping me

Nothing in this world is safe now
No one can hide from the rampant disease

Someone was scratching the door
So I thought itâs locked from inside
I calmed myself down and tried
To feel if Iâm all right

My eyes didnât hurt so
I tried to take the tie off
When the last bandage hit the floor
I was knocked down by the wall of bright lights

I cannot see anything
Paws of fear are gripping me

Nothing in this world is safe now
No one can hide from the rampant disease
The ancient spirits of chaos and diseases
Are awaken

When the white scales felt from my eyes
I took a look around to see what happens
I was in the hospital ward
And the door was almost opened!

I jumped and locked the door
Someoneâs moaning became louder
It tried to break in
I have got to find the weapon!

No one is going to escape
The rampant disease

The Humanity has lived its time
No more parasites on the Earthâs skin
Humanity will be dethroned
