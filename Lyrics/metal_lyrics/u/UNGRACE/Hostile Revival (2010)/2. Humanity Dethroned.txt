I went through the door
And then I saw it
It was almost human
It was even talking like human

âPlease, help meâ â it said.
I didnât listen to its voice
âNo, donât do thisâ â it shouted
When I threw my rage on it!

It was like human
Its blood was red
I left it lying
To the maggots in its face

Rampant disease
Is the end of it all
You cannot escape
The colossus will fall

Rampant disease
The old will be stoned
Rampant disease
The humanity will be dethroned

Iâve left the building
The street was full of bodies
But I wasnât scared
They were not humans

I see it very clear
With my new eyes
I see the truth
The truth is me
The truth is me
The truth is ME

I am the only real person!

I remember the Kiremethâs words
âYou are the edge. The end of it all.
I will give you new eyes. So you will see the real worldâ

Now I see it. Itâs so unperfect.

Rampant disease
Is the end of it all
You cannot escape
The colossus will fall

Rampant disease
The old will be stoned
Rampant disease
The humanity will be dethroned

Humanity has lived itâs time

Rampant disease
Is the end of it all
You cannot escape
The colossus will fall

Rampant disease
The old will be stoned
Rampant disease
The humanity will be dethroned
