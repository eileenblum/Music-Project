You smell incredible
Your skin is totally white
Iâm happy to lay with you

Weâve met at the party
I still donât know how I got there
You were standing alone
So lost and helpless

You make me shiver
Oh, Iâm so excited
Excuse me, can I take you away?

My curse, my bless
My sick passion

Your eyes are blue like the sky
Your hair is soft like silk
I fucking admire you

I took you to my house
Your strong body makes me sweat
The beauty that no woman can have
Oh, youâre the sexiest guy Iâve ever met

Then I took my scarf
Wrapped it around your neck
Your eyes roll back
Life slowly flows out of your body

For five days you laid under the floor
Then I took you out â I was alone
Scenes of normal life with a corpse

Iâve made some funny pictures of us
Then we took a bath â need to be clean
We had sex so much Iâve lost some weight
Itâs pity that you rot

My curse, my bless
My sick passion
I love you all
Though, itâs never enough

I want some more of dead menâs flesh
Again and again
Again
