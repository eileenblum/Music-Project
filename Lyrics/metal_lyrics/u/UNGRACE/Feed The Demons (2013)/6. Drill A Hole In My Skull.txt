Drill a hole in my skull
Make the fumes flow away

Ignorant mind â evil mind
Two of me â no oneâs right
I wanna be whole â help me now
Take this spike â and start

Drill a hole in my skull
Make the fumes flow away
If I survive, make me a favor
Hide the truth

Iâm tired of being what I am
The ugly mad freak with demons in my head
What for am I doing all these murders?
And raping . And sodomy.
Why am I such a fiend?

Ignorant mind â evil mind
Two of me â no oneâs right
I wanna be whole â help me now
Take this spike â and start
Right fuckinâ now!

Nothing is right
My brain is insane
One of me hates
The other doesnât care

Drill a hole in my skull
Make the fumes flow away
If I survive, make me a favor
Hide the truth

Iâm tired of being what I am
The only thing I live for
Is to feed my demons
I donât remember who I was
Before the voices in my head
Began to scream

Ignorant mind â evil mind
Two of me â no oneâs right
I wanna be whole â help me now
Take this spike â and start
Right fuckinâ now!

Drill a hole in my skull
