I forgive you all
Will you forgive me
For all the things I have done
To enable your anger?

Will you demand for contribution?
Or let me live
My past life of wrath and distrust?

I have no will to change me
Though, Iâve no will to change you

I give it up
No more âmessiahâ shit for me

I wonât tell you what you should do
If you want it, youâll get it yourself
I will not walk around you
For the sake of my profit
I realized that I have failed
All attempts to get out of my grave
Iâve lost my rage but still
I wonât claim that I have no more hate

Invidious face of life
Rubs on my leg
Like a shadow of black cat

Deflections of my mind
Raise a new god from the ashes
Of hatred and depravity

I have no will to cure me
Though, I see no way of doing it

I clear my minds from the
Rust of compassion
But still I donât care about you

I wonât tell you what you should do
If you want it, youâll get it yourself
I will not walk around you
For the sake of my profit
I realized that I have failed
All attempts to get out of my grave
Iâve lost my rage but still
I wonât claim that I have no more hate

No more hate
No more
Donât you ever fuckinâ ask me âbout what you should do
If you want it, youâll get it yourself
I will not walk around you
For the sake of my profit
I realized that I have failed
All attempts to get out of my grave
Iâve lost my rage but still
I wonât claim that I have no more hate
