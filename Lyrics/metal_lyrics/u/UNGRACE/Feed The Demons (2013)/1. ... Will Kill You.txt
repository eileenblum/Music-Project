It hides deep inside you
Your grace is what it hates
Your brain is under pressure
It can make it go away

It can set you free
Or it can kill you
You never know until you let it out
Until you let it feed

If you never hated
It will surely kill you
If you have no sins
It will surely kill you
If you are too self-righteous
It will surely kill you
So meet its face
And it will surely kill you

We are those who live inside you
Making you hate it out
Open your eyes and see us
We are right before your face

We are close
But if you want to see us
Youâve got to fall from grace
And believe
Believe that we are real

If you never hated
It will surely kill you
If you have no sins
It will surely kill you
If you are too self-righteous
It will surely kill you
So meet its face
UNGRACE will kill you

So break the fuck down!

Itâs coming for you
Itâs waiting for you
It will set you free
UNGRACE WILL KILL YOU
