Iâll hate it all away
Burn it to ashes
Save me from staining
And stagnancy

Now I will hate
And now I will scream
Because if I wonât
Then no one could help me

I just want to go away
âFuck it allâ - thatâs all I want to say
But Iâve got to let it out
Today and right now

There is no tomorrow
There is no sign
I will spit â you will swallow
Itâs my way to refine

I will redefine
My wants and desires

I will intertwine
My mind and my heart

Iâll hate it all away
Burn it to ashes
Save me from staining
And stagnancy

Now I will hate
And now I will scream
Because if I want it
Then no one could stop me

There is no tomorrow
There is no sign
I will spit â you will swallow
Itâs my way to refine

I didnât want to scare you, my friends
I just want to set me free
From the cage of abhorrence
Some day you will get it

There is no tomorrow
There is no sign
I will spit â you will swallow
Itâs my way to refine

There is no tomorrow
There is no sign
