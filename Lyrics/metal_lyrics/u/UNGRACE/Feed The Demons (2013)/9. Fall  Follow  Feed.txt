Yeah
Weâve come here following the autumn rain
Here we come
Watch us breaking you down
Here we come
Weâre all abused, weâre all betrayed
Here we come
Behold the great Hate Germs

High in the sky
We wait âtill you accumulate your anger
Then we fall down
Emerging your skin
Making you spit it out

Here we come
With a thunder sound we blind your eyes
Here we come
Waiting before your hate gains its size
Here we come
Zero logic parasites
Here we come
Feeding your emotions

Weâve come here
Following the rain
Riding the lightning
With a scattering pain

We are falling down
Following the rain
Slapping your faces
And eating you again

Here we are
On this scene, pushing you around
Spill your hate
In our eager mouth
Hate and scream
We need you to spit it out
Throw it all away
And we will thank you all

Weâve come here
Following the rain
Riding the lightning
With a scattering pain

We are falling down
Following the rain
Slapping your faces
And eating you again

High in the sky
Weâre looking at you
Our children of hate
Your emotions are sweet like motherâs milk
Just hate - so we could live

Weâve come here
Following the rain
