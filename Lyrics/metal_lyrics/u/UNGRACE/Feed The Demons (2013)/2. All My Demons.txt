Iâm getting out of me tonight
To find all my demons
Iâm sharpening all my teeth to bite
To bite all my demons
Iâm cutting my eye lids out
To see all my demons
I raise and scream my lungs out

Iâm lurking in the shadows
And then jump out and stab you
Your blood spills on my face
Iâm cumming
Yes, I am a pervert
At least I admit it
Canât blame anyone but my demons

I fucked a corpse tonight
To calm all my demons
Iâd cut him open to invite
Invite all my demons
I want to treat them good
To please all my demons
So they can give me strength to kill

Iâm lurking in the shadows
And then jump out and stab you
Your blood spills on my face
Iâm cumming
Yes, I am a pervert
At least I admit it
Canât blame anyone but my demons

All my demons

My demons love to play
My demons love to eat
My demons love to kill
My demons love to fuck

I love all my demons
I feed all my demons
I kill for my demons
And fuck for my demons

Iâm lurking in the shadows
And then jump out and stab you
Your blood spills on my face
Iâm cumming
Yes, I am a pervert
At least I admit it
Canât blame anyone but my demons

All my demons

FUCK!
