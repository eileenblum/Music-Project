Angels lost their wings
Theyâd grew too old
Feathers are rotten
Claws had been blunted

No more skies left to roam
No more souls left to eat
No more fables left to tell
No more hope for the damned

Angels and demons â they are the same
They want to take you to their place to hold forever there
Angels and demons â they are the same
BEASTS
Always willing to take you away

Forsaken and betrayed demons
Tired of their existence
Never they grow old
Never they die

Angels and demons â they are the same
They want to take you to their place to hold forever there
Angels and demons â they are the same
BEASTS
Always willing to take you away

Humans are sinners
No food left for angels
Demons will take them
And drink their souls with gurgling sound

Humans have left their horizons behind

Angels lost their wings
Theyâd grew too old
Feathers are rotten
They will die
