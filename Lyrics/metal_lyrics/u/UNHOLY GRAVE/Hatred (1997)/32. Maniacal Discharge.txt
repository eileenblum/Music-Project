Life is full of dispair 
Day after day 
Now you're maniac 
Time has come 

Lose control- Manic discharge 

Life is full of suffering 
Night after night 
Now you're maniac 
Blind and insane 

Lose control- Manic discharge 

Life is ful of hatred 
Time after time 
Now you're maniac 
Out of sight 

Unpunished murderers everywhere 
Under the war
