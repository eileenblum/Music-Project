Will it never come? Will never come?

So long as nuclear weapons exist
The possibilities of nuclear destruction
...never disappear
And it means total destruction, world's end

Zero hour, zero hour of nuclear attack
Zero hour, zero hour of nuclear attack

The day might be getting closer...
