[performed by Unholy Grave]This is not other people's affairs...
"My 'dear' was murdered, never return..."
"But judgment was 'not guilty'..."
Why? 'Cause of mental disorder? What?"
"Can't understand! Can't understand!!"

"How can I manage this fury?"
"How can I manage this fury?"

"Aarrgghhh! Quenchless, quenchless fury!!"
