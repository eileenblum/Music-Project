[performed by Unholy Grave]Born as a human, growing as a wolf...
Discovered by a human, education as a human
Another life with human, but died young as a human

Life as a wolf, life as a human
Which was better for her?
She might have wanted to die as a wolf...

So many ways of life...
Only you can know your best way
