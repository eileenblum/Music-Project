[performed by Unholy Grave]After the fuckin' nightmare... a "raped" woman
She came to fear "sex" itself... even with her lover
Because terror grips her heart...

A criminal can be "free" after some years in the walls
While she never knows when she can escape from the fear...
Because terror grips her heart
