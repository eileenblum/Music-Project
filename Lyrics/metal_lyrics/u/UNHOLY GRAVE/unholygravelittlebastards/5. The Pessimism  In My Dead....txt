[performed by Unholy Grave]
[originally by Intestate]A I too pessimistic? Am I too pessimistic?

Terror, counter terror, terror, counter terror....
It repeats like, endless tape, it just repeats...
Where is the end? Where is the end?
Is there the end? Is there the end?

I am so pessimistic, I am so pessimistic...


Aarrgghh! I lost my family by terror...

In my dead brain, In my dead heart...
It's void - only hatred remains, yes only hatred...
My hatred towards terrorists won't disappear
My hatred towards terrorists won't disappear!

My grief, my hatred is so deep...
I can't imagine the world "peace"
It's so "unreal" for me, it's so "unreal" for me...
