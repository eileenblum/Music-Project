[performed by Unholy Grave]Mushroom cloud climbing into the sky
A city turned into a burnt plain...

Groans in, groans in, the darkness
Groans in, groans in, the darkness

Escaping in silence
From the raging encroaching flames
Smelling burnt skin!!!

Groans in, groans in, the darkness
Groans in, groans in, the darkness
