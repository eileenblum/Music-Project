My memorable experience in a third world slums
A poor little child begged me...
"Give me your ice cream..."!!

...be born poor - what a destiny!!
Be born poor be born poor - what a destiny!!

He can not choose his fate he can not choose his fate
He can not choose his fate he can not choose his fate

Nothing he can do... doomed to be poor?
Blameless child... living in suffering...
