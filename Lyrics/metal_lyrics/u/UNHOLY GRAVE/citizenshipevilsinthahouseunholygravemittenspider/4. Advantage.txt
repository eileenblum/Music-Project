[performed by Unholy Grave]I am sorry for princess "tragic death"
Though I'm not a big fan of beautiful Diana
I wonder, if she was ugly
Would it has been the same "big thing"?

Beauty brings advantage?
Beauty brings advantage?

Undeniable different treatment...
A kind of natural discrimination?
Does beauty create better life?
A kind of undesirable actualities...

Beauty brings advantage
Beauty brings advantage
