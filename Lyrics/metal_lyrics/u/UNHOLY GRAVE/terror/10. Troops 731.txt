In China... numberless innocents
Were arrested as prisoners...
They lost their names, just got numbers
They were called "ma-ru-ta", it means "materials"

Materials? For what - what - what?
For human experimentation by Japanese troops

Fiendish troops 731
Fiendish troops 731

Slaughter...
For crime...
