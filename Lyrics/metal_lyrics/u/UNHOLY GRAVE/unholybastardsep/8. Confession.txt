This is ex-Neo-Nazi leader's confession
"Until I became an alien.
I had never understood how stupid racism is.
I realized my idea was wrong, dangerous &amp; foolish
Neo-Nazism never can be the solution of the matter"

"Until I became and alien
I had never understood how stupid racism is"...

Aaargghh! Neo-Nazi
Why you don't notice your folly?
Why don't your throw your poison idea away?

"My idea was wrong, dangerous &amp; foolish
Neo-Nazism never can be the solution of the matter"

Aaargghh! Neo-Nazi
Why you don't notice your folly?
Why don't your throw your poison idea away?

... NEVER TOO LATE!!
