[performed by Unholy Grave]A man asked to me
When he noticed I'm an athiest...

"Who created this Earth?"
I answered... "I don't know"

He explained "It's God!!"

What the fuck gods are seeds of battle
...I don't care who is the "creator"
It's not serious matter for me
What the fuck gods are seeds of battle
