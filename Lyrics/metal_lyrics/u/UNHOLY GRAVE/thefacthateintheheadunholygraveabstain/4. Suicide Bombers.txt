[performed by Unholy Grave]How many times did I ever hear this T.V. news...
"There was terror in the Middle East..."
Suicide bombers, suicide terrorists

How many more times will I see this T.V. news...
"Terrible sight of bloodshed"

...it must not be "unusual"

Suicide bombers, suicide terrorists
You dead... it's no problem
But why the innocent must die?
Your ideology is totally wrong!!
