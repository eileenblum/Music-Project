[performed by Unholy Grave]Blood!
A fanatic bombed himself
The innocent bodies, wounded... around

Innocent blood runs, innocent blood runs

A fanatic killed his future
At the cost of victim's future

Innocent blood runs, innocent blood runs

Why the innocent blood? Why the innocent blood?
Why the innocent blood? Why the innocent blood?
