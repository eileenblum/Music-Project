[performed by Unholy Grave]What is done can not be undone...
What is done can not be undone
It is too late to regret
But don't be afraid to try again
Don't hesitate in doing another action
Another action!
But remember
No need terrorist action
No need terrorist action!!
Stop your next cruel action, you bastard!
