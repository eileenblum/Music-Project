So many Prime-Ministers in these several years
Politicians only work for meaningless power struggle

Greedy pigs greedy pigs
Greedy pigs for political power

So many factional strife in these several years
Politicians only work for meaningless power struggle

We are fed up with your farce
We are fed up with your farce
