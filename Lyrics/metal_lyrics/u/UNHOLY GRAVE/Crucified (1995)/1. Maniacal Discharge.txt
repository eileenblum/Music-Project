Life is full of despair
Day after day
Now you're maniac
Time has come

Lose control - Manic discharge

Life is full of suffering
Night after night
Now you're maniac
Blind and insane

Lose control - Manic discharge

Life is full of hatred
Time after time
Now you're maniac
Out of sight

Unpunished murderers everywhere
Under the war
