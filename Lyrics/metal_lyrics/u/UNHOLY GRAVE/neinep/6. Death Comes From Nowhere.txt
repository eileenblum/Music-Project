I might die, I might die today, even everybody has possibility...
By accident, terror, catastrophe, disease, ect...

Death... death comes from nowhere
Death... death comes from nowhere

It's over our control... is this so called "fate"?
"Death" by our side, it's just hart to feel
Especially for healthy persons...

Death... death comes from nowhere
Death... death comes from nowhere

Life is "tough", nobody knows when it close
Enjoy yourself...
