Environmental adaptation?
Some sort of confusion?
Mindless behavior...
Do my eyes deceive me?

The pus in your brain

Ignore my personality...
Rub against the grain...

The pus in your brain

It raises from garbage
Stab me in the back
how can be so insensitive?
Or is it beyond my comprehension?
