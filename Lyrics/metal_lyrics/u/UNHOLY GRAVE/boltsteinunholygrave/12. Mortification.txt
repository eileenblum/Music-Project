[performed by Unholy Grave]Fanatics who dedicated their lives to a god...
Heading for promised paradise after the death
Are they the braves or the martyrs??
No, I gotta say, just selfish killers! Killers!!

How could victims know the causes of their death?
Have they ever thought how mortifying victims were?

Know their mortification!
Know their mortification!!

Think more about it!!
