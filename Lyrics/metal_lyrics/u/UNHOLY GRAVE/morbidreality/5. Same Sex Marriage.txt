"The institution of marriage"
It's to choose a partner of life
There are many forms of love... I believe so
Why it must be man and woman?

The same sex marriage
The same sex marriage... is their freedom

Here's their cry - "It's freedom of choice"
Here's their cry - "Why not?" "Why not?" "Why?"
