Kimigayo? - Why?
I amp proud of being a Japanese
But I am against the words of our national anthem
Kimigayo.. it's called "Kimigayo"
By why Ki-mi-ga-yo?
Why must we sing a song in praise of the emperor?
It's nonsense words
It should be performed
It's imperialistic words
He is just a one of us
Kimigayo?... no imperialism!
