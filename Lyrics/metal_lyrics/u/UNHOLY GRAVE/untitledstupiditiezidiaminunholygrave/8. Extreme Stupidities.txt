[performed by Unholy Grave]In the war...
Unholy abnormal corpses
Who cares those maimed bodies?
who knows the reasons for their death?
Who knows the reasons for next death?
Human kill human each other...
Extreme... stupidities called war

Even unholy abnormal brutal sight
Getting "normal" to the sense... insanity!!
Who knows how many more bloodshed?
Who knows the end of those unspeakable fear?
Human kill human each other...
Extreme... stupidities called war
Extreme stupidities called "war"!!
