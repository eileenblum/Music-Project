[performed by Unholy Grave]Uniform... uniform...
It sometimes changes self feeling
It sometimes changes other's attitude
But it never changes the essence of a person
So, don't be deceived! Don't be confused!

Uniform... it has strange power...
Uniform... it has strange power...

Be yourself, stay yourself... don't lose yourself

So, don't be deceived by uniform!
So, don't be confused by uniform!
