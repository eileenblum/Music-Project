Why did you die so young?
Why did you die so fast?
Why you gone so young?
Why you gone so fast?
Why did you die so young?
Why did you die so fast?

Your memories still haunt us
But entombed your soul never return

no one can escape his destiny
But this is the irony of fate
a sorrowful sight of "relations"
We all sorrowed for your death
We cried, cried, cried, cried
Aaarrrggghhhh!!
