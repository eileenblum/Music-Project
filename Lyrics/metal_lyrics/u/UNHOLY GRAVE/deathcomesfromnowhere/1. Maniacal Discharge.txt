Life is full of despair... day after day
Now you're maniac... time has come

Lose control - Manic discharge

Life is full of suffering... night after night
Now you're maniac... blind and insane

Lose control - Manic discharge

Life is full of hatred... time after time
Now you're maniac... out of sight...

Unpunished murderers everywhere
Under the war!!
