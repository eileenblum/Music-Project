Frosted Earth, ice-cold Earth
With the sun, it thaws slowly, slowly

Your closed heart needs somebody's help
Help to open the door!

Frosted Earth, ice-cold Earth
Without the sun, it never, never thaws

Your closed heart... no help never open
Who are you waiting for??

You are not a narrow-minded
But just chicken-hearted
Forget all your unrest
Your closed door... like frosted Earth
