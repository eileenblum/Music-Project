[performed by Unholy Grave]"I won't wanna fight
For our government
'Cause it means
I must kill the enemies..."
"War is murder, I don't wanna be
A killer!"... a timid person?

"I don't wanna see bloody corpses
And don't wanna waste tons of lives"
"War is murder, I don't wanna be
A killer!"... a timid person?
