[originally by Backwater](originally performed by Backwater)

Can you see the beast controlling us
People dressed in black and white
Power for the strongest, come what may
Why can't we live in peace

Streets of war, what are they fighting for
Streets of war, what are they fighting for

This is a nightmare that pulls the strings
Never let us come to rest
A power game where noone thinks
No one gives an inch
