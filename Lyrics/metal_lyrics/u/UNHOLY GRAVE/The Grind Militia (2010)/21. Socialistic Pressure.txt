Someone named their baby 'demon' 
It's their freedom. I believe ...! 
But government forced 'em to change it 
Why they have such 'power'?? 

... Baby once named demon 
... Baby once named demon 

In this modern democracy 
'socialistic pressure' from the state... 
... Complete unbelief !!
