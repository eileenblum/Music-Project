[performed by Unholy Grave]...A Cambodian's cry...

Give my leg give my leg give my leg back to me!!
Give my leg give my leg give my leg back to me!!

Here, it was usual explosion
But this time on me...
Dream, hope, all blown away by sudden blast
Blood gushed from the wound...

I thought I was going to die - disgusting mines
I thought I was going to die - disgusting mines

Give my leg give my leg give my leg back to me!!
