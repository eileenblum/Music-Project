[performed by Unholy Grave]At the court...
There's the criminal in front of me...
So this is the criminal who killed my "Dear"...
My uncontrolled anger for the criminal rises!!!

Can't allow, won't allow, don't wanna allow the criminal
Can't allow, won't allow, don't wanna allow the criminal

Aarrrggghhhh!

There's the criminal in front of me...
I wanna kill the criminal if I can
My strong desire for "death penalty" never disappear

My burning anger... my burning anger...
