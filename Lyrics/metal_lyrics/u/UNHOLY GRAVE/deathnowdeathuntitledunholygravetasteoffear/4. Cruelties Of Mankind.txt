[performed by Unholy Grave]Numberless cruelties - cruelties to mankind
Senseless cruelties - cruelties by mankind
Endless cruelties - cruelties for mankind

The innocent suffer under the pain
Just for egoists' sadistic lust
Will history repeat itself?
Will mankind never learn? Never learn?
