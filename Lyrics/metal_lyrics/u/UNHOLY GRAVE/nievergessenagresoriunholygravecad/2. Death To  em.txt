[performed by Unholy Grave]Deadly accident under the water
The crew are dying, president's holiday continues

Death to 'em? Death to e'?
It sounds like "die"!!

Is "military secret" heavier than "life"?
Patriotism, hard work for the state...
But "they" don't give a fuck about 'em
But "they" don't give a fuck about 'em

The crew are just waiting "death" in darkness
The crew are just waiting "death" in darkness...

Death to 'em? Death to 'em?
It sounds like "die"!!
