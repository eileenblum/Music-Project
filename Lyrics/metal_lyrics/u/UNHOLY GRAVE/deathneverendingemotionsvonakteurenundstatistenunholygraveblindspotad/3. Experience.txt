[performed by Unholy Grave]I used to smoke, now I don't, now I realize...
It's sometimes a nuisance for non-smokers

Experience, experience is better then precept

Racists might not realize their stupidity until they are discriminated
Anyway, I hope they realize it as soon as possible...

Experience, experience is better than precept
