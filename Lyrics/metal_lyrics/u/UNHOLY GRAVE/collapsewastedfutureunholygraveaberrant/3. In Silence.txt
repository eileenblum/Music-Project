[performed by Unholy Grave]
[originally by Heresy]Death, misery locked up in my mind
Terror, fear in this world so blind
Anger, hatred flowing thru my veins
Somehow, willing, release me from these chains

As I open my eyes
See reality flicker by
The question still remains the same
I scream so loud
But no one wants to hear
A pawn in their deadly game
Anger burns inside me
My heart is bleeding hope
Somehow I need to find a way
Sometimes it seems so hopeless
Nothing seems to change
Just live with this fear day after day

In silence [3x]
My mind screams in silence

I wait for days to come
I see the visions gone
Yearning for the love I need
I hang onto my dreams
Hang onto my hopes
And see what the future breeds
The past holds deathly shadows
Memories of pain
Ties around my burning heart
Misery and suffering
Drain this world of love
But my visions won't be smashed apart
