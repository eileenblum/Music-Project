[performed by Unholy Grave]"Remember Pearl Harbor" vs
"No more Hiroshima/Nagasaki"??
Each slogan and opinion
Each bombing and victims
Each unforgettable history
But confrontation of the world is nonsense!!

Isn't this our common slogan??
"No more war", "No more war!"
This is our common slogan "No more war!!"
