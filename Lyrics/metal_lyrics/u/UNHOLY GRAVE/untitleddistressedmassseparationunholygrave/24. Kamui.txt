[performed by Unholy Grave]"Ainu-noshiri"... we know it as Hokkaido
Before, no Japanese there
It was land for the Ainu race
For indigenous peoples lviing with Kamui

They have no letter
It never means the lower race
Before the Japanese invasion
it was land for the Ainu race

For indigenous peoples living with Kamui
