[performed by Unholy Grave]My memorable experience in a third world slums
A poor little child asked me...
"Give me give me give me your ice cream!!"
Be born poor, what a destiny!!
Be born be born be born poor, what a destiny!!
We can't choose his fate
Nothing he can do, doomed to be poor??
Blameless child, living in suffering
