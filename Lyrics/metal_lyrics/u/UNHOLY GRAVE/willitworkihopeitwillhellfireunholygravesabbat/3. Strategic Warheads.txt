[performed by Unholy Grave]
[originally by Terrorizer]Nations failing to defeat
Burning ash, who's to blame
Human suffer left in torture
Rise and fall, fear of war

Fear the future of mankind
Nothing left but wasted years
Can't escape, world downfall
Cut-throat system, spare no pain
Life and death, meet together
Why must one, lose like this

Fear the future of mankind
Nothing left but wasted years
