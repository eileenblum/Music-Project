[performed by Unholy Grave]The bomb explosion...
Everywhere, anytime...
There is no rule... no rule!!

World under terror, world under terror
World under terror, world under terrorism

It could be your place...
Just nobody knows...
There is no rule... no rule!!

World under terror, world under terror
World under terror, world under terrorism

Endless nightmare...
