[performed by Unholy Grave]The blow took a kids leg away
Rising terrible pain in bleeding

Yells for help, yells of pain, pain, pain, pain
Yells for help, yells of pain, pain, pain, pain

The blow took the kids future
Who's gonna take responsibility??

Yells for help, yells of pain, pain, pain, pain
Yells for help, yells of pain, pain, pain, pain
