[performed by Unholy Grave]"Love is blind"... this is just the case

A civil servant was crazy about a beautiful woman
From abroad...
He wasted "public money" to catch her attention
...and was arrested in the end...

Blind love... fantasy? Blind love... reality
Blind love... risky risky, blind love...

He lost everything, "beauty" included
"Love is blind"... this is it! Her love was illusioned...
She just loved "money", yes he just had been deceived
Now she is rich in abroad...
And he is just a blockhead...

Blind love... fantasy? Blind love... reality
Blind love... risky risky, blind love
