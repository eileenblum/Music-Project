[performed by Unholy Grave]...He did "euthanasia"... 'cause his patient begged
...doctor "death"?? No, he saved patient!
Only violent pain continues...
Though there's no hope to recover
Who can blame if patient demands "right to die"?
Euthanasia is not evil deed
Euthanasia is not evil deed!!
Euthanasia is not evil deed!!
