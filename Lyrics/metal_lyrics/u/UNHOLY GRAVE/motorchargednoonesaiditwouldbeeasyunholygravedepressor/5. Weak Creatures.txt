[performed by Unholy Grave]...when i was living alone, casually I wondered...
"If I suddenly got heart attack or brain damage at home...
Would I die alone even couldn't do a emergency call??"
...and I thought this is why people want to have family...
Human beings are weak creatures
Even if they act like strong persons...
