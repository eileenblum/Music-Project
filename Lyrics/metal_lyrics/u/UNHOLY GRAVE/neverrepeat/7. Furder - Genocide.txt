[originally by Ripcord and Heresy]Farmed in millions
For whims of fashion
a glossy image
With no compassion

Fur is murder

Parade around like
You've just walked off the set of cellas
Fur is murder
So shove it up your arse

40 dumb animals to make a fur coat
But only one to wear it
Whether it's gas or strangled, trapped
Or snared, or eloctrocuted



Out through the blackness
I look upon the earth
Smothered in decay
A waste of neture's birth
Engulfed in misery
Left to rot in time
Myths of eternity
Graves in our minds

Genocide Genocide
A million hearts bled and died

Lost in twisted time
Back into the fire
Darkness claims more victims
Thrown upon the pyre
Rivers of blood flow
Man's the victor yet again
His stagnant futile dreams
Trapped in the realms of pain
