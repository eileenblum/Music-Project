[performed by Unholy Grave]Over 10 years on many trials
Even ore years... for appeal
Lost precious life time...
Too slow trial too, slow judgement

It could be faster!
It could be faster!!?

Over 10 years on many trials
Even more years... for appeal
Even more years... for final appeal
Too slow trial, too slow judgement

Why it takes so long?
