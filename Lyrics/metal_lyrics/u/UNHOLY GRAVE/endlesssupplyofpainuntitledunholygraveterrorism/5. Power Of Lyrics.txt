[performed by Unholy Grave]You may say... "Everybody knows how miserable war is..."
Or... "Now it's too ordinary to sing about war"...
sure, it's nothing new, nothing new, I know it!!
And even it's nothing special, "special" or "cool"...

But I say, "We always have possibility of war"
And who wants to have "war-experience"??
