[originally by Ramones]Hanging out on second avenue
Eating chicken vindaloo
I just want to be with you
I just want to have something to do

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, well alright
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Wait now
Wait now

Hanging out all by myself
I don't wanna be with anybody else
I just want to be with you
I just wanna have something to do

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, well alright
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Wait now
Wait now

Wait now
Wait now

Hanging out all by myself
I don't wanna be with anybody else
I just want to be with you
I just wanna have something to do

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, well alright
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
