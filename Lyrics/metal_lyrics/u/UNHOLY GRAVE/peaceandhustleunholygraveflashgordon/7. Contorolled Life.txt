[performed by Unholy Grave]Imagine life without taking care of time...

Our schedule based on "time"...
It's standard for everything
Seems like we are controlled by time
...controlled by time...

I feel like controlled by time, time, time
Feel like controlled...
I feel like controlled by time, time, time
Feel like controlled...

Imagine life without taking care of time...
