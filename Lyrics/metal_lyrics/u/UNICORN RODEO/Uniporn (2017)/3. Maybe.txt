Maybe if I just keep on trying
I can figure out
What my life's supposed to be like
What it's all about

Maybe you are pleased for me
That I'm finally sure
What I want to get rid of
And what of I want more

Maybe you know
That I finally found a way to express myself each day
And say what I want to say

Maybe just because of you
I could learn to be
Fine with being me
Without being half of we

Maybe if I go away
I can find out what's true
True just for me
Not for anyone else, even not for you

I found out what's true
Just because of you
