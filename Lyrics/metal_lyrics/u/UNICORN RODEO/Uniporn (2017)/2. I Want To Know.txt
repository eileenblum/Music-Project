Life is like a journey
A tightrope walking with blinded eyes
Who will I take with me,
Who will give me some advice?
Where will my wishes lead me,
What treasures will I find?
Life is an open ended story that no one can rewind

I want to know
Where will I go
I want to find my peace of mind
I want to see
Who I'm gonna be
I want to try to find the reason why
I want to know...

Will I walk on beaten tracks
On footprints that I find?
Or will I leave my own marks
That others follow behind?
Will I take up my fears
And will I face each dare?
Defeating them will grow me then
So I can move along my way

What will I do, where will I go?
Whom will I meet, what will I get to know?
When will I fall, who really cares?
Why do I try, and how will I get there?
