I am the sound of creation
I'm the I who weaves the web
I am liberating sweetness
I dissolve all boundaries
I'm the life, I am transformation
I am death without dying
I'm like moss, I'm the insight
I'm the true garden of self
I am the tree of wisdom
I am laughter, wonder, delight

I am the wave that consumes you
I'm the center of emptiness
I am neither past nor future
As above, so below

I'm the hall of mirrors
I'm the endless reflection of self
I am the realm of awareness
I am the sacred flame
I am two ways â two ways
