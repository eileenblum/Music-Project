Head in the sand
Head over heels
I'm hiding from trouble
And glad about how safe it feels

No one is watching
I'm too far out of sight
I'm back to normal
Everything is alright

Here I stand
And I bury my head in the sand
Here I stand
And I bury my head

I am just a simple fool, obeying every stupid rule
I never had the guts to say let's do things another way

I'm living in darkness
And I don't want to see
Invisibly hidden
Is all I wanna be

Soul in the sea
What a huge mess
But the real world's out there
Kicking my ass
