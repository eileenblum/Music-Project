Black or white, or shades of grey
Words you can and cannot say
Right or wrong, false or true
Can something red make you blue?

Conceal the truth, cause if your conscience is quiet
You sleep alone each and every night
Too many choices that you have to make
Should you be real or are you fake?

Now or never
Here or nowhere
Stay or go
Figure out and let me know

Face up the fight or run away
Spend or save against a rainy day
Big or small, rise or fall?
Yet again you finally accept the call
