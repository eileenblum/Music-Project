Mash-up in the roots of fear
Which applied conjure insanity torn in sight
Mind hoar gave this syndrome a false, evocative name
Diseased, infected breed
Un-precedent opportunity to be heard by its original case of disease
Unleashed

Especially hostile to abhorrent terms
Exacerbated protests
Of
The neuronal sewer
Contemptuously agreed

Upholders of authority
To what need it can be brought to life
It belongs to all who already have, word and mind manufacture

Objurgated by own rivals out of circulation thrusts

Worlds demise for cognitive novelty and congenital eccentricity.
All epochs of insanity a living language is finally tyranny

Burning it
A living instability
An abhorrent and horrific term
Reproach, repress the conflict within

Inclined to believe it belongs to you
With word and mind
A living language is finally free
The will to repress

Often inclined to submit our genocide
Between authority and independence
As continuously stigmatizes our carved congenital delusion

Vehement and vociferous in demand
Often inclined to believe the power to forbid
All innovation
