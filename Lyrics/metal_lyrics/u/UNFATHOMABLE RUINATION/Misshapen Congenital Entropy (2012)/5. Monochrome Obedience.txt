Exacerbation
Towards the center of this void
Condemn the nature
Of obedience

More or less defied by the motion
There is no progress and no essence at all

Since naturally scruples are commonly
Corporeal or not

Nature left the Promethean way
To kill itself or rot

Suspended in a stagnant wisdom
A block of life via chemical ways
A construction of all living organisms
Through and by obedience

Demonstrated through plain defiance
Subjugated obscure realism
