The human horde, feasting in, its ignorant bliss,
Like bacteria it spreads, the earth it's host,
Draining it of life unaware, of its self detriment,
Unaware of its hosts, vulnerability...
Succumb to its own demise.
Burning towers,
Spew black poison,
Suffocation. Disarticulation....
It's landscapes distorted and burned.
This mindless parasite
Devours and eradicates.
Through parthenogenesis a clone arises.
Long forgotten and unseen,
The need to preserve it's surroundings,
A perfect being replicated
Eyeless yet not blinded,
It's judgment never tainted,
By misguided aspirations of materialistic gain,
It's one goal to eradicate this virus,
That jeopardises it's survival.
Humanity over run,
Starved and unprepared,
It's forced into remission,
Earth it's unwilling host regenerates,
As the last of humanity is purged from its body,
Genocide through parthenogenesis.
