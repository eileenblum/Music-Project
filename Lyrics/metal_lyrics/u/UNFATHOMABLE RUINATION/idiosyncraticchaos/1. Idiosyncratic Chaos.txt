Chasing false meanings into the shades of the void
For we are organic synthesis of structured chaos
In the mist of pre-deterministic beliefs

Chasing false meanings into the shades of the void
For we are organic synthesis of structured chaos
In the mist of pre-deterministic beliefs
The world, it devours itself to fuel... oligarchical energies
Generated by epitomes of mass lobotomy...
For we are undeniable pawns of bigoted systems...

Chained to the edge of cosmic spirals, earthbound eyes they dwell on vain
Attempts to disentangle the geometry of violated innocence

Induced bewilderment...
Chained to the edge of cosmic spirals
Dissipates the silent awareness
Nothing but annihilation
Lies above, below and beyond
For we are idiosyncratic patterns of chaos
Idiosyncratic patterns, of chaos
Worshiping life in pantomimes as our breed de-evolve
For the world devours itself to fuel the antinomies of existence
For we are idiosyncratic patterns of chaos.
