From the unknown, the unreachable void,
His slumber has been disrupted

Now he's awoken, his vengeance comes
Awoken by the fetor of a tainted realm
The perpetrators, they must suffer

Emerge from thy chthonic quarters, thy retribution cometh
Through fathoms of spoiled azure, the torrents of the abyss,
The bane of all existence, the scourge of humanity

Breach the fold, surface only to behold this counterfeit sphere,
This soulless, noxious, fabricated existence
Unaware of its inherent perdition

Colossal pillars of hardened flesh steal the sun,
Towering limbs becloud this polluted crust

"Suffocate in my venomous coils
You pestilent swarm of ungrateful affliction!
Fester in my shadow, cower before me! I shall revive utopia"

Now he's awoken, his vengeance comes
Awoken by the fetor of a tainted realm
The perpetrators, they must suffer

"Emerging from thy chthonic quarters, my retribution"
