Intoxication, ensnared
This blissful existence, complacency
A succubus obscured under a veil of falsehood, beguilement

The mask slowly dissipates,
Virulent true form exposed, maliciousness

Your dissimulation identified,
No longer enchanted by your toxic mendacity

Your graces dissolve into repulsion
Now unearthed, deception incarnate.
A fragmented and tainted, hollow shell

Deeply buried hatred free from containment,
Exposure of your disfigurement

Abomination
Revelation, tenacity overcome
Circumvention from a life of despondency
No longer intoxicated, free from obscurity
