Pathetic you stand before me, leader of disappointment
For I have returned, behold, great falsifier
The fruits of your endeavours have tormented this realm
You've taken paradise and created hell

Pitiful you beg before me, parasitic infliction,
Witness the result of the perversion of power
The results of your villainy have been recognised
You've taken paradise and created hell

Clutch your ears, your futile resistance
Recognise your failures. Succumb to my superior influence
Images fill your mind, your consciousness is mine

See your wretched guise, the view from your victimsâ eyes
Hear their screams, the cries of infants aflame in your hellfire
Ignited by your greed

Feel their pain, feel their hunger, see their demise
With infinite complacency and ignorance,
Confident in your empire over this world
You took resource and created destitution.

I watch you tear at your flesh, clawing at your skin,
Writhing in despair
My influence shall spread among your legions, across this plague
I, originator, architect, destroyer
