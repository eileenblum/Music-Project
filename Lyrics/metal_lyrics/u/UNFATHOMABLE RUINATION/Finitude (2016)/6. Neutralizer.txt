Kneel down to us, your true god
This agnostic horde,
An encyclopedic legion hell-bent on war

The eradication of the myth our one true cause,
Ruination of the sect,
Invalidation

Too long your pious deception
Has provoked the callousness of man
Your hierarchy shall end

Crush the hollow skulls of the saintly
Upon their tainted altars
Raise their sanctums to the ground,
Set them aflame

"Where is your deity now?"

Neutralised!
