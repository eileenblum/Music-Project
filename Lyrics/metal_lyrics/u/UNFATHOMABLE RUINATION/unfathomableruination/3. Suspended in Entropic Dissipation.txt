... and with the consequence of harmony's degradation
Its equilibrium scorned in surrender
Cause and effect, reversal of the order
As with beginnings, a certainty of cessation is assumed as the concluding chapter
The fundamental laws which determine this existence inevitably hasten its fate
The expansion of this doomed universe in futility is scripted
The measurement of beginning and end is rendering time defeated
When all creation and nature returns to nothingness, the balance re-established, existence not even but a memory
Stretching infinitely, forced into obscurity, no echo to remain
A vacuous expanse of silence, outgrowing the legacy of sentience
Forever extinguished
A terminal absence befalls the empyrean void and collapses the configuration of vitality
The procession of an instant to end all chronology
The fundamental laws which determine this existence inevitably hasten its fate toward a point of conclusion
Forever extinguished
Extinguished.
