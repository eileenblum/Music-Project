Darkness cloak us all
Wild cosmic onyx gorge
Where Orion once stood tall
And sagittarian arrows soar

Twilight engulf us all
Supreme existence ignored
United we shall fall
Independence unexplored

Lost, here in time
Perpetually still
We are indoctrinated blind
In opposition to our will

Fading is the light that never shines
Aiding manipulation against our minds
