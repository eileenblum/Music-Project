Here below the great watching eyes
Deception encases the illusion of our lives
Thy will be done, without the son
Where are we to seek meaning in your truth
When only fib, fable and fiction is absolute
Deny his name, there are no flames

Constitutionally enslaved
We would surely drown if it wasn't for the waves
Look to the sky, open your eyes
At what point will we try to break away
And turn back from the paths that they have paved
We have to see, we are not free
