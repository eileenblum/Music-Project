[Music by Theodore Amaxopoulos &amp; Lef Germenlis, lyrics by Theodore Amaxopoulos]

You're manipulated
A handful of disregard
Turn your back again
No need to sympathize yourself
I'd never trust those things you said
I don't want to hear

Emotions you can't feel
In a broken place
Never ending fear distorts your face

I don't want to hear
Turn your back again
I don't want to hear

Sometimes it hurts
Somehow I need to move on
I'm falling again
Sometimes it hurts
Somehow I need to move on
Falling from the top
There's nothing you can do

Look how the disregard
For the things that you said about me
Takes an ironic turn
And there is nothing you can do
Look down and breathe
Forget the past and overcome
This solitude you feel
Stop falling down
