[Music by Theodore Amaxopoulos &amp; Lef Germenlis, lyrics by Theodore Amaxopoulos]

[Male:]
Let me whisper some words to you
My beloved dark path
A few words to convince you about the entity
Still waiting for you on this late beginning

[Female:]
I can see you through these empty walls
'Cause I was meant to live those moments
[M:]
Let me grant you every secret of this world
Any sound you can't imagine

[F:]
And then he turned left at the crossroad
The inscription was so clear
But he couldn't see at all

[F:]
I can see you through these empty walls
'Cause I was meant to live those moments
[M:]
Let me grant you every secret of this world
Any sound you can't imagine

[F:]
Wonder if we are aware what we leave behind
All those black unspecified silhouettes

[F:]
I can see you through these empty walls
'Cause I was meant to live those moments
[M:]
Let me grant you every secret of this world
Any sound you can't imagine
Any sound
