[Music by Lef Germenlis &amp; Theodore Amaxopoulos, lyrics by Theodore Amaxopoulos]

Starting to become the emptiest selfless being
Like inside my dreams
It's necessary to do what it takes
But wait â a wake up call
The wings â of independence
We longed â for assistance
We got â a mighty distance
They both â denied the charge
And there's â a cloud of dust
We're just waiting to see
What the end will be

Listen I'm gasping for freedom
Because something might happen
We're brought here for a reason
But they lead us into prison
Dwelling in the darkness
Hopeless

It hurts so deeply when you cannot see the end
Like a scorpion stung my heart
Now we got nothing
Nothing more to lose
So find the gate that leads to happiness
Purifying my restless spirit
Spreading the meaning of my real intention
The oracle was consulted
Against the rancor
Against the ambition
Against myself

Listen I'm gasping for freedom
Because something might happen
We're brought here for a reason
But they lead us into prison
Dwelling in the darkness
Hopeless

How will she come?
Will she come back then
Whither will she come?
She'll come I know
Oh will she come?
Will she come back then?
Whither will she come?
She'll come I know
