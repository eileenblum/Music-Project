[Music by Theodore Amaxopoulos &amp; Lef Germenlis, lyrics by Lef Germenlis]

Laying on the ground
Wishing that it was easier
Come sit with me
And tell me that you can do better
The things that came to be
Drawbacks in my troubled ride
I'll survive
The path is dark but I'm not frightened
Mark my words when I say
I'll survive

I strongly believe â I will win
I'll do the best for me
Walk in my shoes before you judge
My life and my choices are not for debate

I've lost my freedom
My life was torn apart
From the start I knew
Something was holding me back
I will get rid of it

My strongest belief â I will win
I'll do the best for me
Walk in my shoes before you judge
My life and my choices are not for debate

I strongly believe â I will win
I'll do the best for me
Walk in my shoes before you judge
My life and my choices are not for debate
I strongly believe â I will fight for it
I'll do the best â the best â the best
For you and me
Run in my shoes
Before you reach the end
I'll be waiting for you
Waiting
