[Music by Lef Germenlis &amp; Theodore Amaxopoulos, lyrics by Theodore Amaxopoulos]

Off to a journey that we have to take alone
Hard to contemplate the things we should have done
And the fears inside
We drown them away
We never said a word and ever shed a tear
Even when people just smiled indifferently
As the seasons pass by
All ignorance remains

I was always trapped inside a cage
Through time that's fading
Waiting for a sign
Without self denial there is
No inner peace
Take me far away
To a secret place

But I will always give
And advice for you to keep
Brace yourself and fly while striving
Rather than living in fear

I was always trapped inside a cage
Through time that's fading
Waiting for a sign
Without self denial there is
No inner peace
Take me far away
To a secret place

Broken wing
