[Music by Lef Germenlis &amp; Theodore Amaxopoulos, lyrics by Lef Germenlis]

First impression scared me to death
Looking on the inside - Regret
Sounds of pain and no relief
Pictures speak of endless grief
I am here to glimpse the truth
Show me what you've been through all this time

Look at me
I wasted countless hours feeling in need
Of someone â anyone
Anything
Just give me something
I want â to grasp â to stay

Open your doors and let me in
No one knows the shit I had to deal with
Open your eyes â let's see it through
No living soul has ever known the truth

I'm dying on the inside
A rotten corpse with eyes that bleed
I scent your fear
The predator has taken forever my soul

Oh god what have you done
How can you allow this to continue
Scares me to believe that this is really happening
Looking in your eyes I know
You've been telling the truth all along

No â please â stop
This can't be happening
You've made your choice
Now sit back and be silent

There is no remedy
Torn to million pieces and lost
Redefine my life to cope with this darkness
Waking up to nothing
Life ain't worth living any more

No â please
Stop this nightmare
Help me to forget
You've been fooled again
You've learned the hard way

Perfect hypocrite
Disappears after all
Total ignorance
I wonder where you might have been

Molested souls
Like temples burning to the ground
Broken windows
Sinned on your most sacred place

Perfect hypocrite
Disappears after all
Total ignorance
I wonder where you might have been

Open your doors and let me in
No one knows the shit I had to deal with
Open your eyes â let's see it through
No living soul has ever known the truth

I'm here for you
Now I see the light coming in
Me and you
Let me be the one to give a meaning
I'm here for you
Now I see the light coming in
Me and you
We will pull through
