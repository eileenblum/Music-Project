[Music by Theodore Amaxopoulos &amp; Lef Germenlis, lyrics by Theodore Amaxopoulos]

Every night I choose to run away from my wasteland
A drifter lost in vain
I have forgotten â I have forgotten my son's face
Fear now embraces me as long as I'm in motion
The old man has betrayed me
I know I'm on my own

Day by day â the weapons of our warfare
One by one â they will turn against us

Our mission is to be migratory birds
In a world of illusion
An exit through the sea
Caught inside the net of our decadent union

This weird sense of dryness
Makes you an integral part
Nobody wants to play in this horror film of likeness
I'm scratching my skin off
I'm dying away from home
I'm lost inside the desert
I can walk no more

Day by day â the weapons of our warfare
One by one â they will turn against us

Our mission is to be migratory birds
But now I need to leave
I have forgotten
I have forgotten everything
