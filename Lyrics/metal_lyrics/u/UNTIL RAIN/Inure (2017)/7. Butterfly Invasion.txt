[Music by Lef Germenlis &amp; Theodore Amaxopoulos, lyrics by Lef Germenlis]

When I was a young child - quite innocent
You had never been there
I needed you to care
Still too young for this â dare
Another excuses won't suffice

Don't try to make it up to me
It's time to set my spirit free

Butterfly in the sky
I am a vile creature dying
I'm a butterfly in the sky
I am a vile creature dying

Now I am an old man â quite pitiful
I've got no compassion
Because I was abandoned
Still I've got no feeling - home
The nightmares 'til now won't stop

Don't try to make it up to me
It's time to set my spirit free

Grief, sorrow
Now I'm free
Flying above you
Sick, crazy
Now you see what you have done to me
Now I set my spirit free
