[Music by Lef Germenlis &amp; lyrics by Cons Marg]

Panic attacks â senses sharpened
The deal is lost but we ain't reaching out
We fell from grace
In shades of doubtful pain
This hopeless madness won't seal our fate

Born covered in colours of love
Fiction's taking over

On the edge of history
It takes a heavy toll but we won't fall
We will try to be one for as long as we can
Without your vanity

You may believe that we've lost control
You can assume that we are giving up
We stand today admitting every mistake
There is no need to prove you anything

Born without your obsessions to hold
This fiction must be over

Building a whole new world
Embody the creation now
Will by unity
Tear down this awful war
Respect from the beginning now
Powered by destiny

There's a chance to redefine
This failing value system
Of our compromised aesthetics
Smash the condescending
Unison with the ordinary
Induce the new word fiction

Building a whole new world
Embody the creation now
Will by unity
Tear down this awful war
Respect from the beginning now
Powered by destiny

On the edge of history
It takes a heavy toll but we won't fall
We will try to be one for as long as we can
It is our destiny
