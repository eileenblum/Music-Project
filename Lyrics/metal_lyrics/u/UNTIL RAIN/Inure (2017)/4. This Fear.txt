[Music &amp; lyrics by Lef Germenlis]

Isolate the present from the past
You keep looking for atonement
While you torment the innocent
Inside of me you will find no empathy
I don't understand how this system works
I only know

You only have one second chance
To make amends with everything
Rid yourself of this hostile stance
And I will feel for you again

I'm tired of this
I can only laugh at this
I now see it - clear
Your mind is full of fear
It's all the same
Inside of me you will find no empathy
I don't understand how this system works
I only know

You only have one second chance
To make amends with everything
Rid yourself of this hostile stance
And I will feel for you again
