Once upon a time near the end of Creation
We are living quietly in an age of destruction
Something new was born in a corner of the earth
Spread of an epidemic as if it was the Black Death

Pandemic H1N1 â Swine Influenza

So many people died, you should have warned them
This world is cripple and it cries,
For every now and then

All that is - pandemic

Burn your mind
And sell your soul
Lucrative civil affairs Iâm the victim on the wings of hers

Wearing the mask avoid the death
Whispering the words of prejudice
To protect your body health
And infect the other selves
(Wearing the mask avoid the death
To protect your mindâs health
Whispering the words of prejudice in their ears
Drugging with jab into the blood
To protect the body health
Whispering the words of terrorism in a state of panic
Brainwash. Schizophrenic. All that is â Pandemic)

Donât burn your mind and save your soul
Now give your fight. Play an important role
All that is â pandemic

Donât burn your mind
And save your soul
Behind this prism you can see
The sickness of misery

Donât sell your pride
Now give your fight
Things ain't what they used to be
The pandemic is killing me

Please donât try to fix me, canât you see?
Itâs time for me to leave I spent my life in front of a prism
And now Iâm trying to feel so free
All that is â pandemic

[Chorus]

Killing me.
