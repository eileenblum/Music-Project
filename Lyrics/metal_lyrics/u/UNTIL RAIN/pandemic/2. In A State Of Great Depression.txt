I have never felt so alone with so many people around me I gave up all the efforts to pretend that I am full
I have never imagined that I would end so fucked up that I would feel so close the breath of loneliness.

Now I try to change it all take decisions on my own leave the past and fight for all I dreamed about, I longed to make come true

Stop sacrificing your ambitions and fight for all you wanted, forget the fearful past
This time you will rise a king to your world to stop pretending, to find the peace of your heart.

She had lied to me with fairytales for the future
Just a normal life, every day same things, same words, a frozen life children, house, rot in the same place every day

Now I try to change it all, take decisions on my own leave the past and fight for all I dreamed about, I longed to make come true
