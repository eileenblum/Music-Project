Believe

Oh please don't cry now, the rain is gone
The clouds hide behind the wall
We'll find our way, the way back home

The pictures of the past are tearing me apart
Like knives we hold inside, we fade away
But brother you were late that night
You have forgotten who you are
You have forgotten who I am, and where the door of heaven laid this is the morning of your face

You slip and you fall. You crawl and you bleed but now it's time for you to rise and see I've seen that brother, you are lost
Desperate on a distant coast

We've run out of time, trying to turn the tide and now we recall.

The pictures of the past
Are tearing me apart like knives we hold inside (we walk away)
And when itâs dark at night
We leave it all behind
To find our way back to the light

Just another kiss before you leave
The dream is lost it wasn't real I don't believe
Oh please don't cry now,
The rain is gone, the clouds hide behind the wall
We'll find our way, the way back home

[Chorus]

In a different dream, we have forgotten now,
A dream that I believe
