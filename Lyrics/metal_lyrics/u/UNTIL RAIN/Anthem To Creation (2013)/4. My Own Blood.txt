My weakest part is you, the past can prove it
All those things youâve done to save me from the pit
You wiped the dust from my forehead
After all those years I betrayed you and him
You came back

Come to me brother I need you with me
No one can save me from the monsters I see

I never wanted this life for us
Escape was not an option
I thought I was protecting my own blood

Inside this fight there is no mercy. Neither a shelter to rest
We fool the people to protect them. Lies, from scratch âtill the end
Donât lose your patience and your faith
I tried to do my best. I wasnât strong enough
God where are you now that I need you

Stay with me brother Iâm counting on you
No oneâs here for me I canât stand losing you

I never wanted this life for us
Escape was not an option
I thought I was protecting my own blood

Come to me brother I need you with me
no one can save me from the monsters I see
Stay with me brother Iâm counting on you
no oneâs here for me I canât stand losing you

I never wanted this life for us
Escape was not an option
I thought I was protecting my own blood
I always wanted this life for us
Escape was the only option
I never said that you were
My own blood
