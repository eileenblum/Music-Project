Nothing comes without its consequences
Even if youâre dying to act, think again
Evil plans are brought upon you when theyâre trying to haunt you, think again

Think again nobody can undo their actions
Think again before you lose yourself again

Where was my fault where did I go wrong?

I tried to change
My heartâs desire (Living in vain)
She didnât listen to me I couldnât help myself be
A leap of faith I could never take (No turning back)
Should I give up or should I let you live

Think again nobody can undo their actions
Think again before you lose yourself
Think again, now is your time. Make your decisions
Think again before you lose your pride again

You said: âI never have or will regretâ
This second is a moment of remorse
You tried to leave these things behind and the
Scars from them in your heart never let you

Think again
Nobody can undo their actions
Think again before you lose yourself
Fight with pride. Itâs time to face your inner demons
Fight with pride before you lose it once again
