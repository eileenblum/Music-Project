(To die there in emptiness
Justice will prevail
Before he gave his final breath
They lead him to his grave)

Unable to move and find his way,
Heâs meandering through the secret pathâ¦
A brave man soaring up in distant space
They decided to burn his flesh and his heart

Embraced our humanity
That was his destiny

To die there in emptiness
Justice will prevail
Before he gave his final breath
They lead him to his grave

Far from these walls
The winter is gone
Following their logical atomism

He was restrained
In a distant space
Now slowly heâs dying alone.

Embraced our humanity
That was his destiny

To die there in emptiness
Justice will prevail
Before he gave his final breath
They lead him to his grave

Embraced our humanity
Yeah
It was his destiny

To die there in emptiness
Justice will prevail
Before he gave his final breath
They lead him to his grave

Iâm dying here in helplessness
Justice must prevail
Before I saw the eyes of this world
They took me to the grave
