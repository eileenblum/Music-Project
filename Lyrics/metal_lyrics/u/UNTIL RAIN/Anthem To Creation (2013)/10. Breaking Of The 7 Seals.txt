I feel so sad for you
Abysmal guilt surrounds you
All the things that will happen are your fault

I will break the seven seals
One by one they will destroy you
Everything will fall into place
The four horsemen
The white-dressed martyrs
Devastation released

It will be spoiled
The first creation
Youâve become an abomination
The firmness will be lost
The stars will miss their host
When everything falls apart

Please show mercy
The guilt lies with me
Things can change
I believe in you, I hope itâs not too late
To save my soul

The trumpets blared out
After the silence itâs the end of mankind
Iâve shown no mercy

The seven seals were broken
One by one they really did destroy you everything has fallen into place
Everything has fallen into place
