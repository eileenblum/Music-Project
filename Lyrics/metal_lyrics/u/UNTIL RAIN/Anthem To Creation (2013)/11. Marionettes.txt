Nothing has changed. She gazed at the past,
It was better than ever
Thereâs no time for pain. Against the stream
We will stay together

A newborn will come to life
Itâs my own debt to raise it
Weâll do it together
You shouldnât be afraid
We will fend for ourselves

Some people may rush to draw conclusions
Many of them might find the wrong solutions

Donât do it or youâll regret it
This was your last chance to prevent it
You will feel utter desolation inside you, itâs too late

Impossible is nothing
Youâve got no choice you have to face the cold hard facts
You canât run away for all eternity

-Soâ¦ weâve reached this dead end.
-Thereâs no avoiding the obstacles in our path. Shall we discuss the matter at hand?
-Please donât do this to me. I canât stand the thought of it. Itâs murder, donât you see?
-We have to face reality or else life will become a trial for us, full of pain and Suffering
-Face reality you say? Havenât you ever stopped to consider anything but the obvious? This soul is what will link us together forever. Itâs just an innocent child. Please, donât goâ¦ Youâll regret it.
-Listen to me:
-Iâll miss you my love, but I canât live this lie.
-Iâll miss you my love, this must be a misunderstanding
âGoodbyeâ.

The gift of life was given to you
It canât be thrown away like this
The mystery of raising a child The feelingâ¦ itâs irreplaceable

You are my whole life
I canât do you any harm
I will let you live
I will let you live in peace

Nothing remains the same
We picture the future
Itâs more difficult than ever

You are my whole life
I canât do you any harm
I will let you live

Impossible is nothing
