I woke up, where am I?
Canât remember a thing
What do I feel?
How did I come to this?

Addiction, needles burning my skin,
The lights around me are so dim
The substance is in my blood.
I feel it inside

Oh sweet relief of death where are you?
Release this dark chain from my heart
Carry me with you

Now I see, I finally understand
What was lost, entering this cell?
Dreaming of her, craving for the end...
I wanna escape from living this hell
This living hell

Paralyzed, alone,
Standing still
I can sense the emptiness surround me

Just because I canât feel
Doesnât mean I donât care
Sitting in this dark and empty room

Canât move, canât shed a tear
Canât breathe, Iâm trapped in here
My fragile eyes wide shut
Drifting off this endless road
This game for me is lost

Now I see, I finally understand
What was lost, entering this cell?
Dreaming of her, craving for the end...
I wanna escape from living this hell
This living hell

Gazing up at the vague sky
The sun is setting on me
But what an irony, God
You are always smiling at me

Canât move, canât shed a tear
Canât breathe,
Iâm standing still
This is my own demise
Never imagined it would end well
