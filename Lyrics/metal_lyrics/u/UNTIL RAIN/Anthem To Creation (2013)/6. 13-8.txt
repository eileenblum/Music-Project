âThereâs no hopeâ he said and left
And the evil spread like wild fire
We tried to flee, but we were crashed
Into the darkest desires

Out of this burning inferno
There was a child
With hands covered in blood
His innocence forever tainted

So for all your life, all your Life
You kept on hiding all your thoughts
With the eyes of your soul you can find all the things that you have lost
And keep on living

And God disappeared
From the face of the Earth
Now instead of Him
The human kind prevails
Ride on until you rise again
Cause the end shall not descend

So for all your life, all your Life
You kept on hiding all your thoughts
With the eyes of your soul you can find all the things that you have lost
And keep on living

ââFor nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in many places, as well as famines and troublesâ¦ââ
(These are the beginnings of sorrows á¼ÏÏÎ±á½¶ á½ Î´Î¯Î½ÏÎ½ ÏÎ±á¿¦ÏÎ±)

So for all your life, all your Life
You kept on hiding all your thoughts
With the eyes of your soul you can find all the things that you have lost, and keep on living

So for all your life, all your Life
You kept on hiding all your thoughts
With the eyes of your soul you can
Remind yourself of
all the things that you have got
And keep on livingâ¦
