Upon the world grey darkness
Smelling of blood and corpse
The candle wax in brightness
Showed me the way to roam
Creatures of the fall
Tolls in the midst of life
It took me years to find
The mysteries of your soul

The age of madness
This realm is where I belong
Searching in darkness
Why are my answers wrong?

Bringing down the demons of this world
This empire had to be destroyed
A clang of shields
I cannot avoid

Itâs a divine tragedy
Acting on the stage of insanity
We tried to kill our destiny
Itâs the beginning of absurdity

The age of madness
This realm is where I belong
Searching in darkness
Why are my answers wrong?

Bringing down the demons of this world
This empire had to be destroyed
A clang of shields
I cannot avoid

Time to escape from this living hell
The flood is coming I can hear the bells

Bringing down the demons of this world
This empire had to be destroyed

A clang of shields
I cannot avoid
I cannot avoid it
My spirit abandoned my body
And it flew away
