Iâm not trying to bring justice here and I donât want to see this case clear
Together we collect the debt and we condemn you
You set up a plan, to create a world of pain and doom
Dragged me to the womb of oppression

For a god with no soul
Youâre just a part of his game

Iâll learn the words by heart and play the role you trained me for
I can see the rectitude, Iâm coming through

A threat is coming from the sky
Canât you change my Disturbed mind?
Wearing a helmet on my head
Loyal to my countryâs will
Iâm Tired of Poetic justice

Look at me behind the bars of this jail
My purpose is lost and they cut off my hair
I have to be patient and comply
with the rules, oh no more hate!

I can feel the emptiness with a shotgun in my hand
And the sergeantâs voice is driving me insane
I canât hear you anymore
Can you stop to take a breath?
I want to escape from here
I need help but you canât hear

A threat is coming from the sky
Canât you change my Disturbed mind?
Wearing a helmet on my head
Loyal to my countryâs will
Iâm Tired of Poetic justice

Follow me in this misery
And march with the Army of Salvation
Engines of war have engaged
Soldiers, welcome to hell
Thousands of people are dead

I donât understand the reason weâve started to fight
I remember the horror of death, abandoning a newborn child
Declaration of war, from us
I uncover my eyes, but thousands of people are blind
Authority, for the benefit of our country
Submission to our nationâs will forever
I donât wanna break this seal
Allegiance, an evil plan upon us
And you cover up this masquerade
To make us live your own sick dream

How can you live with that? Dissension? For what?
Now I leave this place, lost in my reflection
This paranoia makes me live in my obsession
One nation against these schemes
And only now can I see what this means
