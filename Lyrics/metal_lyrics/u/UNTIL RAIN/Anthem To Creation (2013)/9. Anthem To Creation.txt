There... The nature goes wild
It sows and unfolds all her secrets
Wicked creatures unaware of this place
Draining sunlight with joy
Giving itself fully to its lord
They interfered with the Creation...

Million miles away, behind the snowy mountains
Under the cloudy sky, eyes are incapable of facing heaven
Just travelling with our memories, emotions and dreams..
With the sound of angels' harps and quests for eternity

Twelve ships closing to the land. Slipping slyly upon the sea...
The ropes of the sun are their captain
Night-stars are their compass
Willing to become Kings instead of her...

The harmony of nature, surrounding them like the moonlight hugs the Earth
Birds like nature's heralds beginning their Journey
The picture softly faded, till it turned white, one bleak night of December

Twelve ships closing to the land. Slipping slyly upon the sea...
The ropes of the sun are their captain
Night-stars are their compass
Willing to become Kings instead of her...

They used her beauty, they never shed a tear
She might be hurting, but she doesn't fear
They took advantage of every corner found
A prophet saw it coming, and heâs dead by now

She will rebel, with much anger
You may run but there is no escape

Willing to give you my seeds, willing to serve you always
But you have betrayed me, you are cursed

I will rule this place, you will kneel before me
If you misbehave, I will take your life
Now please give me more ground to ease my hunger
Some wine and some whores, itâs the perfect life

She will rebel, with much anger
You may run but there is no escape

Willing to give you my seeds, willing to serve you always
But you have betrayed me, you are cursed
You are all cursed!

You burned me, you dug me
You didnât care at all about my heart thatâs suffering

Everything is produced implanting the delusion
That all the things we sacrifice are for the common good
Who are you trying to fool?

Even when I warned you
You didnât hesitate
You made me feel so worthless
Now I will have my revenge

Everything is produced implanting the delusion
That all the things we sacrifice are for the common good
Who are you trying to fool?

Now I see our time is at hand, it is entirely my fault
This is the ending we deserve, we should have known
I can see the angels arrive; this is what I fear the most
This is the ending we deserve, we should have known

It was just a dream (wake up) this is your second chance
Donât screw it up (no time to lose) off you go to change the world

Twelve ships closing to the land. Slipping proudly upon the sea
The ropes of the sun are their captain
Night-stars are their compass
Willing to become, willing to become
Servants in her hands
