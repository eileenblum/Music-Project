My theory in life was so earthbound and
Suddenly this abstract figure, in person appeared
Iâm not of this world I can surely tell
That they know

Thus I cannot lie and I donât care anyway
The moments of sorrow within redemption
All this time in a parallel universe
Iâve got to find my way back
I guess nothing is forever in life
Will we disappear on the way back home?
