One rainy night i drove alone,
Was on my way to combat zone
Seems that an evil curse was chasing me
That for years i had ignored

A curse produced by a wicked priest
Back to the days when i was young
And it stains you
Feels like you're going insane
Things never gonna be the same
If you're trying to hide
Only i can seal your mind

Mesmerize and seduce the crowd
Push them all to praise god loud
Hypnotize them blind their eyes
On promised afterlife heaven skies

It hunts you hard until it takes you down
Face your fate
No other way
Can't turn around

Just another step before my grave
Blood everywhere, can't stand this pain
Just a little bit before i say
It's getting late
My vision's gone
But i will stay alive

Only for tonight
Oh please don't go, don't leave
I ain't dead i'm asleep
Can't you hear my screams?
Don't give up on me

Can someone tell me what i'm doing here?
Oh, someone wake me from this awful sleep
I don't like it here, in 1716
Gets cold at nights and there's no one here

When i writhe and twist never
When i sweat and rip my skin
And when voices in my side
Whisper in my ear
"come to me, come to the reign of dreamsâ

Doctors speak of a girl i killed
How could i know i can't recall a thing!
How did she die, did she die?
I'll never know, in this state i'm in,
I cannot grieve for her

Countless shrieks in melancholy themes

Rolling lost upon my highway of death
Women, children, allâve been cast to hell
Said, i can't go there you ask me too much
Got to show the world
Ought to know what's going on
And now it's taking me down
I feel the space spinning round
For the last time
I saw the sun touching the ground
Midnight falling until sunrise,
It brings the hollow dawn
Father, amen, save me now!
