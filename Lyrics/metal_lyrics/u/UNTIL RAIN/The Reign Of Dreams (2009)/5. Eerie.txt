Charming, beautiful mistress,
Start a voyage in my dream
How she slips in my mind,
Breaks my silence with her smile?
And i'm dancing, floating, swimming,
Like a fool in the ocean of lies
I've been deceived

How she looked in my eyes,
And i can't deny her glowing path
How her magical motions rouse an eerie feel
In a way i just can't take no more

Siren of the night,
Oh just sing to me,
Will you?
Lure me to your flight,
Can you dance for me,
Can you?
Take me to your side,
And i'll hold you tight, an' i
Kiss your lips, it's real,
Now i can't stand this eerie feel

Walk into my shallow tomb
Breathe into me, life
Slave me to your soul

Terrified,
Yet satisfied
To your arms,
I surrender tonight
Petrified,
I realized
I had fallen in love
It feels so real this time

Siren of the night
Oh just sing to me,
Will you?
Lure me to your flight
Can you dance for me,
Can you?
Take me to your side
And i'll hold you tight, an' i
Kiss your lips, it's real
Oh stay with me your my

Siren of the night
Oh just sing to me
Sing to me
Lure me to your flight
Now dance for me
Dance for me
Stare into those eyes
Their inferno fire,
Burn my soul
Sorceress dreams you steal
I can't deny this eerie feel
