Devoting their live a misused mentality
Thousands of victims running into open arms
Raised Fists, Lies
Brainwashing and Exploitation
Stealthed as Dedication to him

Turn your thoughts around, see the lies that you've chosen
Forget the ones, that deceive you from the truth that lies somewhere out there.
Find out what lies beneath.

Look through the facade, exposing your leader
Look through the facade, revealing the truth
Look through the facade, exposing your leader

Ending up dismembered in the sand
Or shot by an unholy weapon
Your leader's playing Sandbox with you as toy
And he destroys you and your brothers too
