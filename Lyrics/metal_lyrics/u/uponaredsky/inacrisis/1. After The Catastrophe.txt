Blown away, there's nothing left.
Your hive turns into dust.
It flies away to reach the sky,to rain down upon our filthy race.

The tower is quaking,like it never had before.
Everybody is poking him,until he will collapse [x2] 

At us

He buries us all in his huge vast parts
Now
Bury us all [x3]
Bring this to an end

He will bury us all in his huge vast past.
But we'll rebuild you again and again.
With the same unstable heart [x2]

Blown away, there's nothing left.
Your hive turns into dust.
It flies away to reach the sky,to rain down upon us.
