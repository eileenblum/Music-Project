What the fuck?
Slay the king

We are the people
That built this country up
But now we're minions
And you don't give a fuck [x2]

We're shattering your walls
And break your monument of fear

We'll go for your throat
And rip your insides out

Leave us alone, let us heal the wounds
Your reign is over, let us rebuild a country in ashes

Not even your people are believing in your fucking lies anymore
More and more are fighting with us and you can't stop us now

Slay the king now

Slay the king [x7]

Leave us alone, let us heal the wounds
Your reign is over, let us rebuild a country in ashes
Your reign is over now
