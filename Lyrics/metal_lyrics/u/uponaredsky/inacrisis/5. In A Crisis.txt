Fed by haste and hate, desire
Raising above the mind of the concerned
Enormous growth
Holding the ball with its huge pranks
And won't let go
Until, nobody knows
Nobody knows

Loads of green paper implying responsibility
Responsibility misleading into distrust
A person, a nation, a world
Loads of green paper implying responsibility

In a crisis

World, oh world, oh world where have you gone
Oh world, oh world where have you gone [x3]

Try, to fear the monster with itself away
Only destroying the symptoms
Not digging under the surface 
|Not destroying the core  | [x2]

We are in a crisis

Now we are at a point that we had already reached eighty years ago
Promoting the career of a man in pact with the evil
Hoping that it won't come so far
We're trusting in the the responsibles again and again and again and again
Again, we'll trust in them again, we'll trust in them again
