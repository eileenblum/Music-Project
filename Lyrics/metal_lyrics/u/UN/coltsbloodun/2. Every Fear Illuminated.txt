[performed by Un]Down on your knees
Defeated by grief
Clutching the earth
Where you belong
Seasons wither
Your bones to dust
And though time forgets
I can not

Every fear, every doubt, every regret
Brought to life by your demons
So you slip away into memory
And yet at your grave
Flowers still bloom
