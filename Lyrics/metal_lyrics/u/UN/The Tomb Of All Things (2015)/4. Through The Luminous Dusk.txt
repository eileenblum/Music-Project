How deep must I dig this Grave?
How far below must I bury these bones?
Must I completely abandon this life
Before I am no longer haunted by myself?

Fingers bloodied and nails torn back
But I will keep digging this shallow grave endlessly
For a vanished body

As daylight fades, I am awoken from some cruel dream
Shattered by a silhouette upon the horizon
Beckoning me through the luminous dusk
To leave all behind without a second thought
And I will not look back

Fingers bloodied and nails torn back
But I will keep digging this shallow grave endlessly
To leave an empty existence
