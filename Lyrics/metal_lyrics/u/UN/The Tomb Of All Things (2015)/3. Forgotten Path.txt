Long Iâve wandered this forgotten path
And on this journey, Iâve found nothing
Still I continue, Shedding this withered skin
But through this process, Iâve gained nothing
Bleak gaze turned inwards, peering through whatâs left within
Though of myself, Iâve learned nothing
Like fading embers, Life force begins to dim
And though you suffer, I feel nothing

I approach the temple of emptiness
To find my name carved in stone
I cross the threshold of mortality,
the path behind me now fadesâ¦
