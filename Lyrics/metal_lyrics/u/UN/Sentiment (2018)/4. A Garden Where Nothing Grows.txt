Gray stones
Hung with ivy
Shimmer in
The pale moonlight
Fading words
And forgotten faces
Nestled against
The heart of the earth

In this garden
Where nothing grows
The soil's turned to mud
And all that's left
Is dust and ash
And the memory of your passing

Ruins of life
Darkly buried
Amidst the fog
Of distant memories
In dreams of death
I see you standing there
With arms outstretched
But I can never reach you

Cold and alone
I've climbed
The heights of despair
To find you
But all I found
Was the ghost of myself

Hide all my pain
Deep within restless hours
And still you remain
Resting amongst the flowers
Hide all your pain
Deep within restless hours
And still you remain
Buried amongst the flowers
