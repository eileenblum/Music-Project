Dark clouds cross the sky
Like bruises to remind us
And for every drop of rain they hold
Another pain will find us

Pools of reflection
Laid upon stone
Every moment, a ripple
The stone crumbles
Beneath the weight of pain
The pools are revealed
To be mirrors of shame

Consumed with struggle
Forever fighting
To be free of yourself
To face the stranger
In the pool's reflection
Your true self revealed

Even when the clouds have parted
All life turns to gray
And yet unlike the bruises
Your pain will never fade

So you beg death to free you
To take away your burden
Like a leaf on an autumn wind
All to be forgotten
