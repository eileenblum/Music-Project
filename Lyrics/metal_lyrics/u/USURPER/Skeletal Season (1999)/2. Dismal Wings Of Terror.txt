Precognitions... false prophecies
Paraphysical manifestations
Kings of nations light the way for Christ
Prophecies turn to menacing death...
Innocent blood is spilled

Extraterrestrial theories abound
Interdimensional warfare
Headless, winged, (biomechanical) man
November's fire '66...
Innocent blood is spilled, once again

Cemetery slaves
Children transfixed in horror
Lurking from the trees
At one with night's dead breeze

[Solo: Scythe]

Mothman...
Descend your terror from the sky
Mothman...
Terrorizing human life

"...the dismal wings of terror
 shall descend upon mankind once again"
