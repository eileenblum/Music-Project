Deep behind the hills
Deep within the shadows
The phantom house appears
Upon the dead's domain
And within the walls
A man sits in the dark
Tombstones decorate
This desolate yard

Awaken the shadows!
For it's the devil's soul
A moonless night
A sleepless drone

Demons walk tonight
Transformation unlight
Souls awaken and roam
Can you hear their moans?

[Chorus:]
My earthbound walls
A dying season calls
Illuminations
Transformations

Tormented screams
The new years bring you death
Sombre spirits appear
They haven't slept in years

[Chorus]

Demons walk tonight
Transformation unlight
Souls awaken and roam
Can you hear their moans?

[Solo: Scythe, Necromancer]

[Chorus]
