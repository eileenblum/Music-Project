Of innocence you are welcomed
Enter into my life
From dust you have arisen
Carnality, your fatal touch

Virginity is her lure
Yet she is the demon whore
She whispers everything you long to hear
Then swallows your feeble soul

"On your knees you fucking bitch!"
Out of the womb of a witch
Your master is our lord
Lucifer I hear your call

[Chorus:]
Prowling death!
Demoness from hell
Possess me with your evil spell
Unholy lust is what I need
Demigoddess make me bleed

[Solo: Scythe]

Obedient to your words
Yet she is in total control
Demigoddess - she is death
Praying mantis' hunger, black widow's soul

[Chorus]
