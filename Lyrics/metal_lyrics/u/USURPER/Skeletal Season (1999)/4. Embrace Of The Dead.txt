Unlock then open the gate
For we are welcomed here
The cold, wet fog is thick
Upon this sacred ground

[Chorus:]
Embrace... of the Dead
Embrace... of the Dead

The cemetery is so dark
The candle light is so dim
The clouds have swallowed the moon
In tongues we chant our hymns

[Chorus]

[Solo: Scythe]

The plan 9 of unforgotten souls
Spiritual winds guide us into eternity
Come forth tonight at the stroke of 12
Dead forces of forgotten misery

Upon the stroke of 12
For we are not alone
For this knowledge we gain...
Incense is carried to... our god
(The desolate one)
