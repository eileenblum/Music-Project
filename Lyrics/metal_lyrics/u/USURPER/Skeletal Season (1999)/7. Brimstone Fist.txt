THC is in my blood
Acid is in my brain
Alcohol warps my thoughts
PCP runs through my veins

[Chorus:]
Left hand of God
You will cease to exist
Hell's fury
Brimstone fist

Rabid as a dog of war
Hatred fucking me insane
Inferno blazing in my eyes
Caesar Neron, Satan, Cain

[Chorus]

Hellspawn's Satanic roar
Visions my mind soars
Prelude for Apocalyptic war
Carnage, all religions destroyed

[Chorus]
