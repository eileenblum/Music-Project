Diabolical screams and electrical strings
As metal infects the air
Thunder abounds, drums of war pound
With spikes and blood in our hair
Ravge the women and feast on their blood
They offer their flesh with delight
Denim and leather, fists banging together
Assaulted by metal tonight

Grunts of death
Hear our call
Your bones like tin we shall crush
Deathgrunt
Our battle call
Warriors of iron and rust

Alcohol pours, bodies are floored
The sign of the devil held high
Necks start to break, your drugs we will take
And all of the posers will die!
Rabbi will hang, the priests will all burn
The false ones will all run in fright
Denim and leather, fists banging together
Assaulted by metal tonight

Grunts of death
Hear our call
Your bones like tin we shall crush
Deathgrunt
Our battle call
Warriors of iron and rust

Raise the dead!
Hear us stalking, from below
Feel the grip of the tyrants... Hey!
Dead are stalking, into your world
Below the earth... The iron reign!

The ways of old in our veins
Not of your reality
Older than time itself
Dwellers in obscurity
We're all fucking ultra violent!
Guided by ancient lust
100% Hard
Warriors of iron and... rust!
