Into darkness, into fear
Into nothingness... into the oblong box

Spawned of cosmic dust
Into human form
With the fear of death
Man invents his gods
Kings and tyrants reign
Religion is spawned
Fear becomes obsession
Obsession grips us all

Life is pain, sands of time run quick
Deaths' cold embrace... oblivion
Borrowed time, each breath we take
Brings us closer to our last

Into darkness, into fear
Into nothingness... into the oblong box

Universal chaos
Instinct to survive
Merciless existence
Alone... we die
Buried and forgotten
Lost in space and time
From dust we have arisen
To dust... we return

Romantic dreams
Tales of peace
Eternal sleep
Forever

Misery and pain
Brings us closer
To our home
The Box
