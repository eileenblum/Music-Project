Spells of evil sorcery
Poison from amphibian
Human remains, reptilian tongue

Awake the dead
Souls are drained
To speak my name, you speak in vein
Fires rise to seal your doom
Hdes now has no more room

Formulas to stop your heart
And eradicate your soul
I will raise you from the ground
Strenghtened by the Python God

Subhuman, undead, immortal, profane
Unholy cursing bestowed on your name
Voodo, black magick, forever enslaved
I will command you to raise from your grave

Potions transform you/a hypnotic state
Ritual murder, a zombified fate
I am your god/master divine
You are my servant unmortified swine

DEATHWISH!

Formulas to stop your heart
And eradicate your soul
I will raise you from the ground
Strenghtened by the Python God
