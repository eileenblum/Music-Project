Before the age of battle
Below the Arctic North
When beasts and demons ruled these realms
And frost covered the earth

Aeons now have passed
Volcanic lights dead
Mystic gateways open for man
Submerged dimensions appear

Spiritus-I hear your distant screams
Visions-appear to me in dreams
Succubus-You call me from below
Mesmerised-where funeral waters flow

Water demons possess my thoughts
They call me by my name
They lead me to the ancient loch
Secrets of mankind shall be revealed

I consume the anciet waters
Prophecies appear
I obtain the strenght of ancient gods
Yet spectres from the past tear my soul

Spiritus-I hear your distant screams
Visions-appear to me in dreams
Succubus-You call me from below
Mesmerised-where funeral waters flow

"Altough mortal man shall obtain the powers of the gods...
These waters crave his blood
For momentary immortality...
Man will enslave his eternal soul"
