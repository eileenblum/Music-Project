[Music and Lyrics: R. Scythe 3/95]

Soulless I have become
Death now calls my name
Under a dying sun
Beneath the frozen flames

Awaiting in silence, for there is no way out
Blackened, isolation, for I?m the one with the dead

Snow like ashes of bone
The frost now slowly sets in
(My) seconds in time have perished
Lucifer! I recall sin

Time.
Enslavement.
For there is no way out
The walls of sanity vanish into the air

THERE IS NO CITY OF GOD!
THERE IS NO KINGDOM OF FIRE!
THERE IS NO CITY OF GOD!
UNHALLOWED BE THY NAME!

The once proud temple of a dead soul
Becomes as one with the ground
Envoment by the Serpent?s Son
The reapers scythe is lowered down

The witches, the priests, the madmen
Weave thier tales of thier myths
The lull of false security
Guardians of the sane mind

SATAN BE...
THY FATHER
SATAN BE...
BELOW THE HEAVENS
SATAN BE...
UNHALLOWED
SATAN BE...
BE THY NAME
KINGDOM CONE...
KINGDOM GONE
ON EARTH...
AS IT IS IN EARTH

ANCIENT MYTHS OF MODERN MAN
AS IT SHALL BE... FOREVER
