[Music: R. Scythe 6/95, Lyrics: D. Slaughter 6/95]

Listen...
Listen to the words I?ve said
Prophecies from the dead
Into this war we fight as one...

KILL!
Under the blood red sky
TOTAL WAR!
Only the elite will survive

KILL!
Blood drenches my hands
Holocaust
This battle forges the end

METAL WAR! NECROCULT!

WAR!
War against humanity
We shall rule this earthly throne
Together we shall kill as one

KILL!
Eternal devastation
Exterminate
Total domination

METAL WAR! NECROCULT!

NIGHT OF HATRED
DEAD OF NIGHT

Black evil night-Faces of white
Fists held high-Onward we fight...

Triumph and glory
Obsession with death

A DROP OF BLOOD UPON THE WHITE CROSS
THE NIGHT WILL BECOME OURS...
FOREVER!
