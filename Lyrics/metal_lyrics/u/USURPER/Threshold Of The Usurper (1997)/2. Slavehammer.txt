[Music: R. Scythe 8/94, Lyrics: D. Slaughter 8/94]

Year scorned hag, with obsessions
Searching the realms, the dimensions
(With one) endulged with dark perceptions
Grasping for the eternal flame.

[Chorus:]
Ancient Mystic Summonings
Created Throughout the Past
Ancestral Passages
Scripture That Can?t Be Lost

Yearning desires, they come
They come to seek me out
The Daughters of man are mine...
... for those wear the sacred mark

[Chorus:]
Ancient Mystic Summonings
Created Throughout the Past
Ancestral Passages
Scripture That Can?t Be Lost

[Solo:R. Scythe]

Nurtured to be in league
The Abduction of thy soul
(They are) taught the oath of secrecy
For one more generation...
