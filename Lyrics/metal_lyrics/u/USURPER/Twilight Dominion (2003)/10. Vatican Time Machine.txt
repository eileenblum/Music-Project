Welcome to this cryptic encounter - A tale of the bizarre
A mystic monk named Father Ernetti and his Chronovisor

Come on ! Come on the view of ages
The Chronovisor is set
Come on ! Come on the view of ages
At the cryptic Vatican

Here we go, into the past - The dials are locked
Archaic music, tuned from beyond - Antennas pointed towards god
Tubes glow, transistors hum - Words of theses heard
Metaphysic, scientific - Here we go again

Come on ! Come on the view of ages
The Chronovisor is set
Come on ! Come on the view of ages
At the cryptic Vatican

Scientific priest, view the crucifixion - A quantum warp, A.D. to B.C.
Occult artist, man of the cloth - Vatican time machine

Come and see the unseen
Vatican time machine
Nothing's what it seems
In my Vatican time machine

Come on ! Come on the view of ages
The Chronovisor is set
Come on ! Come on the view of ages
At the cryptic Vatican

Scientific priest, view the crucifixion - A quantum warp, A.D. to B.C.
Occult artist, man of the cloth - Vatican time machine
