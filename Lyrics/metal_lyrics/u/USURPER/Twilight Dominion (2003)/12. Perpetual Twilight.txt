Between the realms of the angels and man
The laws of space and time diverge
An eerie stillness slowly shackles your soul
Psychic boundaries merge

The sound of silence harks the freakish lords
Illuminated in black light
From the sky, from Hades beyond
Pray to the freaks of night

Perpetual twilight !
Hypnotized in a veil of night

Embedding implants deep into your flesh
Radiation burns your eyes
A darkened void warping time into dusk
Cosmically controlling minds

Perpetual twilight !
Hypnotized in a veil of night

Perpetual twilight !
Hypnotized in a veil of night
