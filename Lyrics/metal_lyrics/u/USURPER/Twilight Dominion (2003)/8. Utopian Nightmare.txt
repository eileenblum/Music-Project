Come with me through the frozen waters
Beyond the northwinds, through the night
To the land of the gods domain
Deep within the twilight

Murderous storms and blinding fog
Black as Egyptian night
Frozen skin and frosted bones
Man and nature fight

I feel alive again
Journey to the worlds within
Northwinds guide my way
Voyage... to the gods domain

Illuminations of immortal realms (of which)
Mortal man has been banned to see
Terrathaw of layers of ice
Desalination of the sea

The red horizon of a rising sun
Lands which bask in eternal light
Lush gardens and crypto-beasts
Paradise for a parasite

I feel alive again
Journey to the worlds within
Northwinds guide my way
Voyage... to the gods domain

The gods awaken in rage and fury
Beasts are summoned to kill
Plants entwine and devour
Intruders shall cease to ever return
Bones are snapped and blood is poisoned
Their remains are cast into stone
