We are the shadows
We are the night
We become the darkness
We vanish out of sight
Nocturnal disciples of the surroundings we become
Fierce, spawning legions invisible, we ride as one

We are the black riders upon the blackest mares
Eyes of a funeral pyre - Infernal nightmares

We hunt for the ring - The ring that rules us all
Three rings for the elf kings - Seven for the dwarf lords
Nine for mortal men - One for the dark lord
One ring binds them together and controls them all

Militant chaos of thunder and lightning
Armies of darkness
Quest for the golden ring
Attack without a sound
Hooves and metal strike down
Razor sharp caress
Mortal blood it does infect

The poison draws you, the metal warps your soul
Toxins transform you into a soldier of the horde

We hunt for the ring - The ring that rules us all
Three rings for the elf kings - Seven for the dwarf lords
Nine for mortal men - One for the dark lord
One ring binds them together and controls them all

"I summon thee Lord Sauron to bring darkness to all lands !
Send forth the ringwraiths to usurp the ring once from your hand !"

Cloaked in the shadows
Cast from the moon
We ride in allegiance
(to the dark) Lord of mount Doom

"All hail the mighty Nazgul, from Mordor into the free lands !
Beyond the gates of Minas Morgul to usurp the ring once from his hand !"

Forces unite to destroy the one ring
Nine riders fight
Blasphemy upon kings

We are the black riders upon the blackest mares
With plagued daggers we vanish into the air

We hunt for the ring - The ring that rules us all
Three rings for the elf kings - Seven for the dwarf lords
Nine for mortal men - One for the dark lord
One ring binds them together and controls them all
