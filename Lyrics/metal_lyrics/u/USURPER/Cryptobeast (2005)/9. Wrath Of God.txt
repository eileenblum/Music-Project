I am the great traitor
There can be none greater

Whoever thinks of deserting
Will be cut into a hundred pieces
And then trampled upon
Until you can paint the walls with his blood

Whoever eats one grain too many
Or drinks one drop too much
Will be locked up for a thousand years

If I will the plagues
To descend upon all man
Then the plagues of my will
Will descend and decimate

I am the wrath of God [repeat 4 times]

The earth that I walk upon
Sees me and it quakes
The earth will bow before me
For I am lord

Whoever follows me
Will win untold riches
But whoever deserts...
