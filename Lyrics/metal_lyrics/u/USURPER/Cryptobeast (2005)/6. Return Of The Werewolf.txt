Wittlich Deutschland
(The site of the) Last werewolf slayed
There is a shrine to the beast
Protected by eternal flame
Never to extinguish-The candle must burn
For when the light dies-The creature will return

Winds of chaos summon this lycanthropic spell
Smoke now rises-light soon killed
In the shadow of the full moon-
Reborn by a dying flame
The candle now extinguished
The curse now spawned again

Return of the werewolf
Return of the werewolf

I am the fiend in the shadows
I am the eyes in the night
I am the stalker of man
I snuff the flickering light
My breath is the blinding fog
My fang like frost on a knife
The wolf prints is my chalice-I feed off your life

I am the wolf-man transformed
Abominations-a mind deformed
Never to return-never to shirft back
Schwytzer is thy name-the monster of Morbach

Return of the werewolf
Return of the werewolf

[Narrative:]
"This curse bestowed upon me is my blessing
To think as a man, yet stalk as a wolf
My spirit haunts the nocturnal landscape
Incarnated by the harvest moon"
