Assyria-empire of aggression
Drenched in atrocities-divine mission of kings

Ashur, father of the gods-hear my battle prayer
Guide my thirsty arrows-I am the lion slayer
Lions blood strenghtens me, to lead my men to war
Emotionless sons of chaos-hear our battle roar

Terror storms-impalement, mutilation
Conquering-rebellious populations

Crushing! The bones of my enemies
War!!! War against your souls
Crushing! The bones of my enemies
War!!! War against your fucking souls

Sargon-delegate of the gods
Stoic brutality-foes beg for slavery

Crushing bones, gouging eyes, avoiding innovation
Our code of life: 'no mercy'
Confirmed by Assyrian religion
Hordes of demons guide my path-curse their blood,
Cleanse the land
Proclamation of mutilation-overtures of extermination

"I destroyed" "I demolished" "I burned"
I took theur fucking lives!

Crushing! The bones of my enemies
War!!! War against your souls
Crushing! The bones of my enemies
War!!! War against your fucking souls WAR!!!

Assyria-empire of aggression
Drenched in atrocities-divine mission of kings
I cut their throats like sheep
My steed pranced in their guts
The wheels of my chariot
Bespattered with filth and blood

Crushing Crushing Crushing
The bones of my enemies!
