The endless summer-Heat of night
Along a desolate roadside
Through the shadows-The glow of red
For it's the eyes-of the lizard man

Backwater legends of a local tribe
Humanoid and prophecised
Serpentine malevolence
Beast of aggression and violence

Of Hades, swamps of Hell
Eyes of fire, teeth that kill
Stalking man, gouging metal
Hell spwan of Bishopsville

Reptilian
Reptilian
Reptilian
Reptilian

Cold blooded hunger from the swampen gloom
To harvest blood below the southern moon
A hybrid beast of genetic mutation
A predator from an alien nation

A venomous creature from the sea
Or government conspiracy
Interdimensional magica
Is this El Chupacabra
