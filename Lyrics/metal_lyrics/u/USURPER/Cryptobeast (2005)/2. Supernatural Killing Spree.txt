In 1938
In the southern part of the nation
A plague of murders arose
From a mysterious apparition

For earlier that year
A man found his infidel wife
Took a chain around her neck
Then took his own life

Murderous winds
Adulterous copulation
Dead man's curse
Suicide an strangulation

A young man mocks my tomb
"I cirse ye, mortal fuck!"
Spectral winds guide your path
The chain link grips your neck

His mother knows my curse
Blaspheme thy name
Desecrates with axe in hand
The marker of my grave

I killed that fucking whore
And many townsmen after her
Let this dead man rest
Or endure my murderous plague

Supernatural killing spree!!!
Supernatural killing spree!!!
Supernatural killing spree!!!
