Land of Eire-Age of unrule
The waves break-Horrors emerge
Children of the kingdom of Bile
No armies shall reach these shores!

Malformed clan of monsters and atrocities
Crush their fucking warships and slaughter invading kings
The lethal gaze of Balor, Ye of the baleful eye
Lead our wretched legions, for victory is nigh!

Rising! Up from the sea-conquer the free-usurp the throne FOMORII
Dwell! Below the lakes-the isle to take-under his eye
FOMORII

The Firbolg advance-battle horns sound
Humans shall perish-bones washed aground
Conquery and bloodshed-victorious horde
None shall kneel to Morrigan's sword!

Demonic kingdom ruled by the evil giant
Maniacal tyrant that feasts upon fright
The lethal gaze of Balor, Ye of the baleful eye
Lead our wretched legions, for victory is nigh!

Rising! Up from the sea-conquer the free-usurp the throne FOMORII
Dwell! Below the lakes-the isle to take-under his eye
FOMORII

Kneel! Pray for your lives-all man shall die-sent to your graves FOMORII
Death! The only escape-from the horrid shapes-crown of the gods FOMORII

Conquest of the grotesque
Conquest of the grotesque

[Narrative:]
We are Fomorii
In the name of Balor, we rise from the sea
Tyrannical forces enslave
With crushing tributes and cruelty

Blood! Staining the sand-defend the land-destroy them all FOMORII
Reign! Eternally rule-the kingship of cruel-Balor my god! FOMORII

Conquest of the grotesque
Conquest of the grotesque
