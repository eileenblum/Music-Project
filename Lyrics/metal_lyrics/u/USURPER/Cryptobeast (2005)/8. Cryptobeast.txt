Welcome
Elemental beast
On barren desert winds, you spread your wings
Welcome
Desert scavenger
Desolation, plague, and pestilential rage

Fiery breath of the desert storms
Drought and starvation, raining locusts swarms
Can not hide, no immunity
Angel of the fatal winds, bringer of disease

I am the beast-on rotting wings I ride
I am the beast-burning the desrt sky
I am the beast-infecting the sand
I am the beast-of the wasteland

Cryptobeast! Crytpobeast! Crytpobeast!

Return
Terrify the priest
Churchyard crushed below, you tower over God
Worship
Lamashtu's consort
Uncreation, pain
Incendiary flame

Brought forth to this time again, the plagues again
Casting filth and famine, fatality reigns
"Go forth man of the cloth, and spread my word"
Pazuzu shall spare none, the world of man I scourge

I am the beast-descending death arrives
I am the beast-horror in the dather's eyes
I am the beast-living blasphemy
I am the beast-and all shall worship me

Cryptobeast! Crytpobeast! Crytpobeast!
