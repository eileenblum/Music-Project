False god fallen angels
I hate the crucifix
The stupidity in rotten minds - false faces
Temples of pain and lament
Tones are taer of the the clean sound - flames of evil
The fire born in me
I stand on the white moon - I'm sleeping
But I haven't dream
Mighty power - dragon of darkness
The caves of true belief
Ohh sky, tell me the truth, who's ruler of my soul
Ohh sky, show me the way, show me the way to my father
Ohh sky, you are so black
In my heart is only the blood
Ohh sky...
Magic formula
The key to truth
Kingdom of eternal fires - cold snow in my hands
Rise!
Belief - in my father of darkness
Rise - and snow in his eyes
False gods - hatred
I'm son of darkness
Ohh sky, you've clouds, which I love
Ohh sky, you've wind, so cold wind
Ohh sky, you have sun
So warm sun
Ohh sky, I've big belief
My father is ruler of darkness
And I'm his son
I'm son of darkness
