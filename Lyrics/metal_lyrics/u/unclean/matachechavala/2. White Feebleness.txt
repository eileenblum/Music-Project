Black stone - their thoughts
The face of nameless life
Beuty of death revelation - of life end
Two dark eyes
Commanding rebelion - life of purity
Horror of forget world
Blood of unburied - sepulchre
Shadow of darkness
Might of magician in the sunheat
King of sacrifices
Devil's mass - stare of death
Beauty of the face
Full body of the blood - satan only drop
Death of fools - murder of the world
Destruction
Blindness of believers, primitive of all
Their blood is singing of the way
Last judgment - in the name of satan
I curse this life
Blindness, blindness... the blood
Light blood of the warriors
Their primitive - black altar
Devil's mass
Satan's ritual - self
Absolute concentration
Into - pandemonic name of my way
Might of blindmen, their death
Late understanding
War of self delusion - of white blood
White feebleness
