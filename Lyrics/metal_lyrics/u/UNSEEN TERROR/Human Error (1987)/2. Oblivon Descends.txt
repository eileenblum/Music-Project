Napalm falling, screams of torment, thousands die,
a deafening nighmare out of nowhere comes to life.
Blinding lite, intense heat and howling winds.
Legal murder, crimes committed just to win.

Barren wasteland, deadly silent,nothing left,
scorched remains of fallen buildings, scenes of death.
Those that lived through this madness still remember,
the fateful day when Hiroshima was burnt to embers.

War is timeless,
unpredicted,
thoughts of hatred,
unresttricted.
