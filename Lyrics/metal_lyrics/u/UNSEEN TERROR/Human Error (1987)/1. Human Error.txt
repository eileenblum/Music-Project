Mass malfunction, huge consumption, toxic waste, polluting death.
Realization that civilisation could be destroyed in one foul breath.

Death's constuctions, chemical destruction, widespread panic, unseen force.
Futile excuses, human misuses, wild fire slaughter takes it's course.

Defaying exposure,
severe decomposure,
unseen but there,
death in the air.

Fatal human error released unseen terror,
atmospheric genocide, annihilation - millions die.

There's no method that is foolproof,
mistakes with chemical could unleash the truth.

This could happen when we least expect,
but who'll hear the guilt for a millions deaths?
