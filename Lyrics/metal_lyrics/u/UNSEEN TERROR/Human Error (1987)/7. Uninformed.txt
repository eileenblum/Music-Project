Behind closed doors secrets told,
deals are struck and bargains broke,
as darkness strikes a victim dies,
cover up a bunch of lies,
unanswered questions, hidden truth,
broken promises, no real proof.
Freedom of speech doesn't have a say,
uninformed the price we pay.

Authority makes decisions and keeps us in the dark,
transactions never told - it's not for us to know.

Mass unemployment a problem of today,
inflation on the increase but do we have a say ?
Wealth divides majotiry, money hides the truth,
for a price a deal is struck abusive to our youth.
