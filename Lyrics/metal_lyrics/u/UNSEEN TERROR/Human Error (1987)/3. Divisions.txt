So selfish is the human race
that barries are caused - in life.
prejudice breeds frequently,
blind ingorance and thoughts of hate - but why?

People should stop and think
about the feelings of others,
there is no second class
we are all the same.

Hate because of someones colour,
can't you see some sense? - blindness,
todays worlds dividing lines
should be broken to make a better world - today.

Some will never learn
how to show concern,
sheer narrowmindless.
Just keep it to yourself.

Never judge too soon.
