The praise of living corpses
smell the stench of rotting flesh
Strangled by their murdering hands
nails that went deeper by every world

Misanthropy never fades
forever burning black a raven heart
The stain of flesh, that should never here
enraged by communion of blinded one

See through them
enslavement of their faith
controlling cloned gods with righteous tyranny

Spreading the disease by their hypocrite prayers
deeds of bastard society
the lies that bind chains of weakness and prove this human vanity

Sickening scorn of their blindness and all that breed from their slime
betrayal in heresy of infected masses
paradox of the eternal life

Crasping claws of pestilence, bloody hands of human plague
twiste world of lies and deceit
See through them their poisoned dreams
spreading the disease by hypocrite prayers

See through them
enslavement if their faith
deceiving illusion of bastard society
paradox of the vacuum
