Unearthly from... vivid scenes beyond this world
the reign of blackest truth trapped in a cadaver
Deep in the abyss if the soul
The energy of power... universal

the capture of flesh in  the prison of carcass
awaiting to float in divine vacuum
Diabolical insanity... peaceful madness
nihilistic way of self destruction

...rebellion, retribution...
murder of spiritual perfection
Grave of the mind, flesh surround with grasping claws
inner dimension in which desolation hold no boundaries...

Hellfire within dominating the grace and the soul drawn to emptiness
The enigma of the fallen, mysterious black inferno
dreaming benighted and breathing the dusk...

The call of carnival ones... requiem of suffering and pain
and the soul dream to nothingness... of a fiery vortex
Infernal wrath for the poisoned flesh
misanthropic way of self destruction

...floating somewhere between darkness and light...
in the empty room of nowhere
The trail promise of life a wish to enter the other side
where invincible chaos embrace the existence

To dwell no longer in a restless dream...
trapped no longer in a rotting cadaver...
