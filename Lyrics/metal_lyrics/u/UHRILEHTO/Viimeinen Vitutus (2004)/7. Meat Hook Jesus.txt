Born in a time of propaganda order
to the sanctum of serpents and vortex of lies
Born to be a slave for the righteous system
crawling like a maggot in this sweet human plague
Taught to swallow all they spit
feeding the gods of the worms...
Primitive roles of high education
learning to destroy yourself...
Suffocated by hypocrite morals
forced to followe their fucked up dirrection
...just what the hell is going on...
their world is our hace...
We dont need their lies
we dont need thair bastard game
They are not a justified...
to make us do their slime...
We are not blind to obey your meat hook jesus
we dont follow your damn rules...
Cant you see we are not slaves for your system
Cant you see we want swallow our pride...
We dont need their lies
we dont need their bastard game
Not part of their social world
...we dont give a fuck...
