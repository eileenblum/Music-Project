a misanthropic dream of great isolation
so cold from inside... desperate and agonized
In one moment I saw this all withering
felt how this world of shit fell down...
In one moment I saw this vanity dying
felt every warm breath fade away...
...and I saw them grieving without emotion
I saw them horrified for all they submit...
Yet, never crying for whom theyre grieving
...so weak in the chains of all thats human...
As long as we are in flesh and blood
life never own a true meaning...
and why you ever believe so blindly
that someday things could be fine...
In one moment I saw all greed turn so emptiness
felt how this deceiving illusion vanished away...
In one moment... clarity...
Felt how thw world bled its crimson tears...
