Like pathetic worms we crawl through the scorched earth
Searching for our fallen souls from the deserts of propaganda
Our inner selves devoured by illusion of murdering greed
Somewhere bleeding in the twisted nails of earths voulture breed
Distant smile in a bloodstained mirror, waiting destruction overhead to
Come...
Human plague that we breathe
Deciderium prosequitor amicorum
O quantum est i rebus inane
For it is a dream of the end
Of darkness and eternity
Perfect desolation
Life that disapered from it's form
Everlasting void in never fading vacuum
Total emptiness...
The supreme of death
In gasmasked earth predition
We buried our corpses to the dunes of nothingness
