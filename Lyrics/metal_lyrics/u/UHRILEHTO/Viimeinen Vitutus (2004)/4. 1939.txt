Year 1939
winter seems to be colder than before
Somehere there where the blood stain the snow
thousand shadows slowly start to fall
Screams fill the anxious air,screams of anguish and pain
As the bullets burn and rip the flesh
-fierce agony that makes insane

Year 1939
the line of fire is raging in the eastern border
Invasion of the red force striking with sound of weapons
Battlefields covered in blood and thousand corpses
horrid scenes of war come clear as hell

They wake as the morning brought the sun
slowly creeping throught the moments in night
 of death and grief,alone in silence
the enemy create strong conflict
when darkness fell over trenches
with freezing chill

And bloodshed visions strike clear with pain
this winter is colder than before

As misery conquers,while blood fall to the snow
these lands will sleep in mourning and sorrow
Grievance will come and death embrace the dying ones
in glory and honour to die for fatherland

Time never fades the blood of heroes
while horrid scenes of war come clear as hell

Year 1939
when the line of fire was raging in the eastern border
In bloodshed visions from the frontlines
battlefields covered by corpses
...somewhere there where the winds blew cold
