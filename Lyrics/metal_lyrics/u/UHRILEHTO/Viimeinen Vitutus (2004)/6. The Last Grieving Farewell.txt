I felt dead, as the rain fell from the sky
through that this is the end, that my time has come...
But there were something... a whisper in the darkness
a voice from the mist of night...
Breathing cold yet so warm through my heart...
singing to me songs of despair and grievance...
like the winds hum with the blaze of sorrow
and kissing my wounds that were bleeding...
...in the silent embrace of nightly chill
through the mist I saw my childhood fading...
and though, the fire in my soul has died long ago
before my last breath... I live my life again...
...and the night spoke to me, words of death
wept with me thousand blood red tears...
and though I didn't know what to say...
I realized all we are alive when we fade away...
...sadness fell so heave on my heart...
as I looked upon this world for the last time...
One moment of hope passed my heart as I left all behind...
as pale without
Remembrance of the fire in my soul
had died long ago...
Still I left one moment of purity...
as I realized the beauty of death and sorrow
