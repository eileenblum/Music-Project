Behind your every dream
I see a deceiver smile
Judas at your door,the uncreation of the killing kind

Still youÂ´re playing god
in your empty box
The game of "whoÂ´s the jesus and whoÂ´s the beast"

Like vertigo idol of modernized image of satan
and essence of devils work
Are you the serpent in the paradise?
in order to complete the mission to caress every pale body of disease...

It takes more than pain
when my blood runs cold
It strikes while IÂ´m beating this drug into my veins

They say some poisoned words
but they donÂ´t see
That the real wiew to darkness is deep within me

In a perspective I am mephisto
and I am standing proud on the streets of perdition city
With some vacuum of flesh yet plenty of wounds
and behind the mask I am only dust of eternity

I am here that theyÂ´d have something to hate
created as glorious power for their minds to rule
So when you see me from the mirror
nevermind the grim sight,just let me swallow you to my bloodred dream

I am whatever you thought not
a whore in the corner or the neighbour next door
So glad to lead all in ruin,I rule this "Alien city"
of deprivement society...I am No One!!!!
