[Lyrics by L. Englund]

Christianity the world 
Spread desease 
Infects you from the birth 

Lord of the weak 
Lord of lies 
Lord Jesus Christ 

Glorified and idolized, 
But we know the truth 
Son of a whore 
Not so innocent, 
Not so pure 
With lies of the holy one, 
He used the poor 
To create an army of fools, 
An empire built on worship 
Bow only to him, 
Or your soul will be 
Condemned and eternally 
Tortured in the prugatory 
The promised saviour, 
Truly a cruel tyrann 

We who stood above 
The feeble minded 
Realised the agony to come 
If the path lead 
To this glory destruction 
Was our only choice 

Guided by our inner voice 
He trusted us and didnât realize 
That the world treachery was 
Carved in our hearts 

Nail him on the cross 
Crusifie, crusifie, crusifie 

A cross, 
A crown of thorns 
And four nailsâ¦ 
Was all we needed 
To end his dream 

We had released the world 
From the false prophet 

Father, Son and the Holy Ghost 
Where are you know? 
See the holy cross rust, 
Your churches turn to dust 
Smell your rotting God 
Prepare to be blessed 
By the new Lord 
Jesus Christ Massacre
