Evilution is the solution
There was no god
Only Darwin theory
On how we got here
Where we go when we leave
What do you believe
Heaven's a joke
Hell's up in smoke
Can they deceived receive
They lie what they weave
By the word that they spoke
Heaven's a joke
They'll tell you about
Reincarnation
And coming back as a butterfly
It's a lie It's a lie It's a lie
They'll tell you about Reincarnation
And coming back as a butterfly
They tell you about being saved
I'm really not that depraved
Evilution is the solution
There was no god
Only Darwin theory
On how we got here
Evilution is the solution
There was no god
Only Darwin theory
On how we got here
Where we go when we leave
What do you believe
Heaven's a joke
Hell's up in smoke
They'll tell you about
Reincarnation
And coming back as a butterfly... fly.. fly
There was no God
Only Darwin Theory
Evilution is the solution
There was no god
Only Darwin theory
On how we got here
Where we go when we leave
Evilution is the solution
There was no god
Only Darwin theory
On how we got here
Where we go when we leave
Where we go when we leave
What do you believe
Heaven's a joke
Hell's up in smoke
Evilution
