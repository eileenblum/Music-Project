Coffin of surprises
Watch how the dead rises
Won't take no compromises
Coffin of no return
Evil candles burn
Coffin full of doom
Funeral parlor room
Your a pile of loom
Whom bugs will consume
A ticket a cascet
Your head in a basket
Need a favour just ask it
I gonna get you
Last thing I do
Fill you with goo
Gut with a knife
Gonna take your life
Then make you a wife
Draggin the woods
Hack off your goods
Come on the corpse
Come on the body
Just make sure
Your works not shoddy
Make it look like manson did it
Do it right and don't skid it
Hack off a member hack a digit
Make it look like manson did it
Coffin of surprises
Watch how the dead rises
Won't take no compromises
Coffin of no return
Evil candles burn
Coffin full of doom
Funeral parlor room
Your a pile of loom
Whom bugs will consume
A ticket a cascet
Your head in a basket
Need a favour just ask it
I gonna get you
Last thing I do
Coffin of surprises
