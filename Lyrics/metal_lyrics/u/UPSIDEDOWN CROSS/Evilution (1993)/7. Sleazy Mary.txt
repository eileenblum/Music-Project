Sleazy Mary
Judmental and contrary
She came to see
She came for free
Sleazy Mary
She came to sleaze
And sit in the breeze
She came for the Sun
She came to have fun
I'll strangle her with rosary beads
I won't listen to her pleads
I'll drowned her in holy water
She so cheap I just bought her
Tried to escape but I just caught her
I burn you like a candle
Twist your neck like a handle
Won't it cause a scandal
Sleazy Mary
Judmental and contrary
I burn you like a candle
Twist your neck like a handle
Won't it cause a scandal
She came for the sun
She came to have fun
She came for the sun
She came to see the sun
I'll strangle her with rosary beads
I won't listen to her pleads
Mustn't let go till she bleeds
I'll strangle her with rosary beads
I won't listen to her pleads
Mustn't let go till she bleeds
I burn you like a candle
Twist your neck like a handle
She came to see
