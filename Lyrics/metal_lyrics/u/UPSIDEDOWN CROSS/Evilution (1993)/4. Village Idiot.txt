Call him the village idiot
But he not really that stupid
Town people hurt the pit of his heart
Though they say he's not that smart
Can do a job and get a start
Won't give 'em a start
Try to put him
They try to put down
They call him a clown
Chase him outta town
Make him wear a frown
Ya say he's not perfect
And he belongs to a sect
With not much intellect
You show no respect
But he won't jump through your ring
Can do most anything
Can do most anything
Why are they so mean
I'm still a human being
Call him the village idiot
But he not really that stupid
Town people hurt the pit of his heart
Though they say he's not that smart
Can do a job and get a start
Won't give 'em a start
Try to put down
They call him a clown
Chase him outta town
Make him wear a frown
Why are they so mean
I'm still a human being
But he won't jump through your ring
Can do most anything
Can do most anything
But he won't jump through your ring
