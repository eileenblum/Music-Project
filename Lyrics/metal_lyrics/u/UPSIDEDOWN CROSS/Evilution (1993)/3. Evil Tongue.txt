With evil tongue
And a tobacco lung
And a song that's tung
And a jury that hung
A phone is rung
And mud is flung
With an evil tongue
Can set the world ablaze
Send people into a craze
Higher than the highest torch
Townspeople words really can scorch
Awful things they said
Makes me wish i was dead
Terrible tales they tell
Makes me wish i was in hell
Ugly rumors spread like tumors
Townspeople say
Bought the other day
Said they were in the way
Awful things they said
Makes me wish i was dead
Terrible Tales they tell
Makes me wish i was in hell
Ugly rumors spread like tumors
Townspeople say
Bought the other day
Said they were in the way
With evil tongue
And a tobacco lung
And a song that's tung
And a jury that hung
A phone is rung
And mud is flung
With an evil tongue
Can set the world ablaze
Send people into a craze
Higher than the highest torch
Townspeople words really can scorch
Awful things they said
Makes me wish i was dead
Terrible tales they tell
Makes me wish i was in hell
Ugly rumors spread like tumors
Townspeople say
Bought the other day
Said they were in the way
