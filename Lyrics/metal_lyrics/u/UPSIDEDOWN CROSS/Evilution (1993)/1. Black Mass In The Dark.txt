Black mass in the dark
It's a killing kind of lark
Sacrifices nailed to tree bark
You must follow the path
Follow the blood path
Where you meet the devil wrath
Black mass in the night
Everything is quite right
Sacrifices out of sight
And you must follow the course
You should show no remorse
You will be like the others
Cause these people are bothers
Ritual burning my only crime
I thought I was having a good time
So we wear a hooded robe
Universal power around the globe
Black mass in full moon
Metamorphosis from cocoon
The great satan to emerge soon
Black mass in the dark
It's a killing kind of lark
Sacrifices nailed to tree bark
Black mass in the dark
And you must follow the course
You should show no remorse
You will be like the others
Cause these people are bothers
