Cast into eternal darkness of the night
Cast into eternal darkness with no light
Sentenced to the devils den
This is where you'll be in the end
Cast to a world of eternal damnation
Cast to a world of eternal damnation
Cast into a sea of endless flame
Cast into a sea of endless flame
Cast in with no one to blame
And you must exist with endless shame
And each and every day will be the same
There is no light
Nothing in sight
When you open your eyes
To your surprise
Nothing but black skies
We became immune
We're creeping up soon
Flying high to the moon
Cause it's always dark at noon
Flying High to Outer Space
To escape the demise of your race
We can leave and you can stay
It will be the end of your day
No need to survive
Cause ya coming back i said
No need to die
Cause I didn't say goodbye
Cast into eternal darkness of the night
Cast into eternal darkness with no light
Sentenced to the devils den
This is where you'll be in the end
Cast to a world of eternal damnation
Cast to a world of eternal damnation
Cast into a sea of endless flame
Cast in with no one to blame
And you must exist with endless shame
And each and every day will be the same
There is no light
Nothing in sight
When you open your eyes
To your surprise
Nothing but black skies
We became immune
We're creeping up soon
Flying high to the moon
Cause it's always dark at noon
Flying high to outer space
To escape the demise of your race
We can leave and you can stay
It will be the end of your day
No need to survive
Cause Ya Coming back I said
No need to die
Cause I didn't say goodbye
No need to die
