From the penumbra of dusk
Surge a being that brings destruction
Is an abyss angel, from underworld
Unleashing chaos
Humanity's cry, is near you
Leaving on each step
A dreadful suffering

Oh! Evil Lord, guide us into the dark path
Through the lakes and over the mountains
Open the seven gates of thy reign and brings thy legions
We wait the glorious day of the great coming of theâ¦ utter hell
