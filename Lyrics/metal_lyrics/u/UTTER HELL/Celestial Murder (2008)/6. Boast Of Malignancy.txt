Said the "impure" in his heart: there is no god

The men surrendered, to follow their passions
There is not one that is fair, not one at least
All are strayed, have made themselves useless
there is none who does good, not even one

Their throat is an open grave
With their tongues are forging frauds
Under their lips thereâs poison of serpent
from their flesh, them evil sprout

Thereâs no fear to god in their lives
Boast of malignancy, in behalf of iniquity
Their tongue is which sharp blade, slanderer
They never knew the path of peace

Said the "impure" in his heart: there is no god

The men surrendered, to follow their passions
There is not one that is fair, not one at least
All are strayed, have made themselves useless
there is none who does good, not even one

From here i gaze to the impious, and the prosperity of the sinners
Donât seems to be death for them, neither blow that will hurtthem
Human miseries they donât feel, they yielded to the desires of their hearts
Therefore theyâve become proud and are lined with wrong

Filled is their mouth of curse and blasphemy
Their feet are swift for goin to spill blood
Its shares afflict and oppress your neighbor
Theyâve prefessed all sorts of deadly words

Thereâs no fear to god in their lives
Boast of malignancy, in behalf of iniquity
Their tongue is which sharp blade, slanderer
They never knew the path of peace
