Iâve sown my soul on desolated paths
Where senses turns a plague for life
Gets away the shadows from the past
And the ground trembles at the lightningâs roar

Echos of whispers resound in the void
As winged demons flitting on hell
Mind is assaulted by unholy images
When I descent to dephts of dreams

Entering to an underworl dimension
I feel the strenght of the sulphur souls that assault me

They are a legion of spiritual domain
Agains the faithful ones of the sacred lamb
The devilâs call down below is howling
To make us scorn the saint spirit

Merciless attack upon the sons of god, on christ relapse our rage
His followerâs lives shall fall in pain till uproot their religionâs faith

Cry for the blemished divinityâs defeated
The christ belief by demons has been outraged
Evilâs mark stays on skin impregnated
And their souls they will give us to be enslaved

We swear allegiance to black hordes for a whole darkness domain
weâll serve to our dark lord
The realm of hell must be bring to earth by us the wicked souls who here dwell
You can see them on dreams forever

I have dreamt a realm of evil
Where we the impure ones follow our way
I have dreamt a place that is not heaven
Where wickedness marks our fate
