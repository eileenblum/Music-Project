The clouds bleed
In dayâs agony
About the dead covered by ashes
Before the dauntless presence of the sky
Remains the corpses
Rotting themselves

The rattle of the bones creak
Deafening screems of pain
The sound that carrying fire and death
Itâs the prelude of the cataclysm

Desperation of the thirsty shadows
Cowardness of the light thatâs go away
Treason of the wind that carry the stench
Abrupt destruction of the world, subjugated

Satan takes the souls and carry them at fire to burn
Satan takes the souls and carry them at hell to burn

The voices are lost in the blasphemy of their words
Silent imprecations beating their faces
Humiliation of the sun before the storm
Fear of the night, that comes slow
