From the dark stars, they descend on the earth
Before of all living dominated the existence
Calm and silence were the kings who ruled
And just had a big void of space
The gods were there, in these emptiness
With their wisdom and power, conceived the man
As the ages passed, life they procreated
Till they were forgotten in time

Gods of the abyss, of the inmense sea
Of the icy poles and the mighty mountains
Throught the centuries they wait the moment
When the stars say the time of their return

Rituals of invocations and sacrifices in their name
Since inmemorial times accomplished in the night
uppon the altar the Offerings are shown
Offerings of blood
Offerings to forgotten gods
