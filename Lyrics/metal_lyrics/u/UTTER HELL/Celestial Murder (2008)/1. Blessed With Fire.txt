Lord!! Bless me with the unholy fire
I am a being enchained to sin and blasphemy
Condemned to spread the evilâs seed

Breathing a demonic ambiance, awaiting the arrival of the hordes
My steps follow this fateful path, where fulfillthe will of the wicked one
Until evil owns ye all

Let the heat of the flames of the torches
Burn the skin of those believers of god
Weâll throw their bodies on bonfires
As they did with the witches in the inquisition
Merciless attack against the saintÂ´s followers
WeÂ´ll finish all those useless beings
All pure and holy ones will be decapitated
And with their blood weÂ´ll fill the rivers of hell

Fire!! Blessed with fire
Unholy fire of hell that feed my soul
The blood will flow
Evil take possesion of the earth and Satan shall rise
