Riding over the hot winds of hell
Rips the sky leaving a red line
Vomiting on god and his crown of thorns
At thy home, the volcan of ice

Give us a place in hell
On eternity thy throne awaits
Creates and destroy the universe
Thou are the maximum demonic creation

Exterminator angel of apocalypse
Lord of the domains fo the seventh dynasty
Thou creates the world and grind it with thy hands
Take thy sword and throw the balls of fire

Thou that rules the black arts
Thou that are a genious of evil
Thou who between kings and gods
Are the maximum demonic creation
