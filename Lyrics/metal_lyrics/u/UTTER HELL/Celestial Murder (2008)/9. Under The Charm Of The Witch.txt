As i walk in the dark, toward an light
I see that gathering around the bonfire
It is the sabbath, the black ritual
The meeting for worship to Satan
Abissmal chants, and infernal prayers
To summon the powers of the night
The horned one, lord of evil
They prepare an orgy on thy name

Then one of those witches approaches me
Possessed by lust, sheâs dragged to my feet
She lead me at the center of that baccanal
Then she haunts me to take her in sodomy

Black moon has arisen
Itâs time of sacrifices
To suck the blood of the whore
And a virginâs deflowering

The wind blows hard and consumes the flames
All is so dark that only I can see some shades

A dreadful cry, makes me shake
And the harpies kneel before lucifer
A female is sacrificed
Her blood is taken from her holesâ¦ Raped

Dark lord we venerate thee with our concupiscence
Accept this offering and give us thy damnation

Under the charm of the witch
I drink the blood of a sweet cunt
While her flesh is flayed
For feast of the black souls

Under the charm of the witch
I sate with she the filthy pleasure
I lose me into bloodlust
Even if weâll burn in hell together
