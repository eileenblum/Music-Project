Like I said; "leave your baggage at the back door."
Where I'm leaving you the way I think it should be.
We're always pulling into spaces (that we can't back out of)
Starting fight we can't talk our way out of them
(talk our way out of this)
Talk our way out of this.

How does it feel to be on the receiving end of this one?
Of this one?

I'm half way there,
(and its all on me)
This is what I get for wanting more,
For wanting more.

This is the way it has to be
Dancing on all these changes
So I walk around with this rope in my hand
(rope in my hand)
So I'll tie it around, and around and around.
I'll tie me down.

I'll fantasize of being manic and leaving us behind.
In your eyes, you were the one that tried.

Acceptance is what holds us here
Then you my dear are the one I fear tonight.
We'll try this one more time.

This is the moment that we all live for.
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

I'm half way there,
(and its all on me)
This is what I get for wanting more,
For wanting more.

This is the way its got to be.
Dancing on all these changes
So I walk around with this rope in my hand
(rope in my hand)
So I'll tie it around, and around and around.
I'll tie me down.

You cant see past my waving hands.
(just running away again)
You cant see past my waving hands.
(good-bye)

You think so loud it hurts my ears
I want to know how to get through this
Without choking up
I can't feel you
You're so far from me

This is what I get for wanting more
This is what I get for wanting more
(and its all on me)
This is what I get for wanting more
This is what I get for wanting more
(and its all on me)
This is what I get for wanting more
This is what I get for wanting more
(and its all on me)
