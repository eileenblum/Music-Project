[special edition track]

Like I said
Leave your baggage at the back door
I'm leaving you the way I think it should be
We're always pulling into spaces that we can't back out of
Starting fights we can't talk our way out of them

How does it feel to be on the receiving end of this one (of this one)?

This night will swell with us
This night will run with us
This is our last surviving chance - I want to survive
[repeat]

(Run with us)
Feast your eyes
I don't care

I'll fantasize of being manic
And leaving us behind
In your eyes you were the one that tried

Acceptance is what holds us here
And you my dear are the one I fear tonight
We'll try this one more time

This is the moment that we all live for
Are you ready?

This night will swell with us
This night will run with us
This is our last surviving chance - I want to survive

(Run with us)
Feast your eyes - I don't care
And I'll never care

I can't see past your waving hands
(Just running away again)
I can't see past your waving hands
(Just run....)

You think so loud, it hurts my ears

I want to know how to get through this,
How to get through this without choking up

I can't feel you - you're too far from me
(Too Far)
