It's 12th and Hide on a Sunday
Feeling like we're gold
And we're nothing short of invincible

It starts again
Can you feel it?
It takes your breath away
Stop saying that we're invincible
(it's round and round)
You're uninviting, unrewarding
And I'm misinforming you

We all want to be somebody
Right now we're just looking for the exit
This is the way I would have done things
Up against the wall
You've got me up against your wall

It's you and me on a Monday
The lies that we told
This is were we both go numb now
You broke my heart again this time
You're fading now, you crossed the line

We all want to be somebody
Right now we're just looking for the exit
This is the way I would have done things
Up against the wall
You've got me up against your wall

Reaching out for a hand that's not there
But you're not there and I'm not

This is the way I would have done things
Up against the wall
This is the way we should have done
When we're up against a wall
Up against a wall
