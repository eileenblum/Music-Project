So lets not even try... you're right.
Let's ball it up and throw it out the window. It's becoming all so clear
In my mind.
I've thought this thing through more like once or twice. I feel that this
Is my last request to you.

Hold your breath.... bottle it up and save it for the next one. It's safe
To say we've been riding this
All night. None of this will ever change your mind. It's never safe to
Rely on borrowed
Time. Now we're both undone, and it's time to open
Up your eyes.

Consequence, it's our need in times like these.
Feeling free... it's our modern disease. Your a classic disaster, with a
Knack for losing your
Exterior. (I'm so sick)... from staring at the mirror.

This all needs a break from you, and I'm used to this.

I fear that I am just an end.
So you play the mistaken... and I'll play the victim in our screenplay of
Desire... I'm still writing the letters
I'll never send.

Running in circles I can't forget how many times
I've played this in my mind.... feeling free, feeling free.

Consequence, it's our need in times like these.
Feeling free... it's our modern disease. Your a classic disaster, with a
Knack for losing your exterior. (I'm so sick)... from

Staring at the mirror.

This is my panic... This is my call to arms.
