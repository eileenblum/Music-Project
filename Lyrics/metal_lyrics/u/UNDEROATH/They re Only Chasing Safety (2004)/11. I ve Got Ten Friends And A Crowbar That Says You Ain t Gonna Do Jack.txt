[Limited Edition Vinyl Bonus Track]

Carry out the sound
Past our eyes horizon
I'm standing still, I'm standing still
Waiting for this all to change
Now my hands are up.
I'm walking out, I'm walking out
What do you expect of me?

Did you think that this was all an excuse for
Hospitality
I know you think its all because of me
At first glance, I'll breathe in
Leaving myself no room to move, at all
My mind is so flooded and I'm drunk with regret
Swimming in a sea of hope tonight
I find your hand and trace it with mine
As we push away with everything we have
With everything we have left

Oh you're acting on my words
We can start the fire, that will light up the night
No I wouldn't be too sure of you at all
We'll watch it burn together on respective sides
(yeah)
We look so good, as we fall

I'll go ahead and re-elect perfection
Its never looked as good as it does on you right now
I'll go ahead and make an incision
Doubt you'll feel anything at all
A fake, a fraud, forked tongue and I am nervous
At least I can say I made it out this time
I am just fine where you have left me
As for you be sure to cover up your mouth

I don't know how to say this
My thoughts have just run out
