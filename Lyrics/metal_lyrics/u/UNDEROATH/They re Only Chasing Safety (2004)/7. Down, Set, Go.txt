I had the whole world in my hands, but I gave it away...
I had the whole world in my hands, but I gave it away...
Gave it away.

I'm a half-wit boy, cracking a smile and wearing it all on my sleeve.

So cool and so poised
It's true, I'm just around to see
Where this thing goes
I'll never know, but all I know is
Packing Bags is a remedy
It's a remedy

This time I'll be nervous 'cause I can't see your hands
In front of me... (in front of me...)
Tonight, I've spoken.
Lets forget all pretense of what they thought we should be
What liars we can be

I'm on my way to the top of the world,
And I've got a feeling I'll give it away.
I'm on my way to the top of the world,
And I've got a feeling I'll give it away.

Shes a maverick, shes so smooth...
If things go according to plan, I'll have her finished by five A.M.
There's no changing plans, there's no second chance,
I've already got both feet through the door
And I can taste the air, I can taste the air.

This time I'll be nervous 'cause I can't see your hands in front of me
(In front of me tonight)
Let's forget all pretense of what they thought we should be
What liars we can be.

Make a sound, it's safe for you,
To choke in here alone
Whatever I say goes (whatever I say goes)
Whatever I say goes (whatever I say goes)
You're not here with me, you're not here with me
You're not here with me, you're not here with me
You're not here with me, you're not here with me
You're not here with me, you're not here with me
