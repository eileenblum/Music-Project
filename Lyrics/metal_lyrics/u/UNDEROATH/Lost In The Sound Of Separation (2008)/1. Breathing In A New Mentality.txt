I'm the desperate
And you're the savior
There's been something else
Talkin' in my ear
Someone save me
When I Speak It begins to decay
I'm not about to bury myself
Oh, God! My hands are shaking again
Calm down! Now I can't feel the floor
And my vision takes it's toll on me

Oh, God! It's racing through my veins
I'm afraid there must be some kinda mistake
Oh, I'm in over my head again
reach in and grab a hold of me
I'm so scared that I've started to slip
They say that I'll never change
I'll prove them wrong
It's over
I hear the calling but its passing through
Clean me up show me how to live
Tear me down
Let me start again
