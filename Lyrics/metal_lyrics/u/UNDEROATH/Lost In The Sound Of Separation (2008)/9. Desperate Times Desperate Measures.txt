I've been crawling around in the dark for a while.
Sprawled out across the floor.
Not collecting dust anymore.
Define me a parasite.
Define my host.
Trapped beneath the floor.
I slowly waste away.
Now I pull my frail body into the chair.
And look me in the face.
Oh, disappointments, so disappointing.
This may be my last one.
It's gonna be good and hard.
It might be a touch out of key. (a touch out of key)
When this thing breaks.
I will be you
You will be me.
I pray that this is really happening.
When this thing breaks.
I will be you
You will be me.
Let's hope this is short lived and riddled with disease
Oh, God the noise! Is ringing in my ear.
It's so unclear. (so unclear)
I hear them talking.
But can't make out the words.
Speak up. Speak clear.
I hear them talking.
But can't make out the words.
Speak up. Speak clear.
God, where have I been.
I'm terrible company. With zero apologies.
My God where have I been?
Where have I been?
While I sink to the bottom.
I'll sing out as it fills with water.
I hope I've done enough.
When this thing breaks.
I will be you
You will be me.
Let's hope this is short lived and riddled with disease
When this thing breaks.
I will be you
You will be me.
I pray that this is really happening.
I'm worn out.
I'm worn thin.
I will never break through.
I'm worn out
(Where have I been)
I'm worn thin
(Where have I been)
I will never break through.
(Where have I been)
Let me out.
Let me out.
Let me out.
