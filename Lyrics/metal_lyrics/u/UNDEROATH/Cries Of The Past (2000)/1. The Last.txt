These fingers so frail paint in my mind.
Scars down the back of my eyes.
Death walks with me alone, tonight.
The coldness whispers; "It's almost near"
REST, FOR SOON IT WILL BE OVER!

Years flash before me, and I understand why I'm here...
...No one will ever know, as the pictures come clear..
"Don't worry", they tell me; this feeling won't last forever!
Voices beating their drums in my heart.
The water looks so peaceful below, and the struggle lets go...
...CLIMBING OVER THE WALL OF LIFE'S EDGE
LEAVING BEHIND THE SMILES OF YESTERDAY

The light that shined has vanished to a grayscale of night.
Tears once present, now look into the dryness inside.

Silent words enter the sky;
Screamed from this body as a reply.
And these words begin to write:
 "Dear Lord, if these break the earth, and enter your courts; save me tonight"

Time is short and the hurt of death grows with every breath.
Here I am at the end,
This wall that blocked you out for so long opens wide
And I begin to burn from the inside.
I'll never forget that night...
...The night Jesus Christ made the blackness white!
