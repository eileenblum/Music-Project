Another year has gone by
Time just took it away
Friends have changed
Clear skies watched over us
But we've had our share of rain
Romance still sits untouched
By the water she waits patiently
Hoping I'll take her home someday
To think I lost her
That my dreams were her only place
But for her I've learned to wait
A smile remains on my face knowing
God hold her at night
Letting her know I'm on my way
So I'll hold my head high
For love may be a day
I can't say
But tomorrow awaits
Bringing me closer to you
