[Hidden track]

I wait for my true love, but she never came
I cry for my true love, but she never came
I leave this world never knowing who she was, departing all alone..

I'd just like to speak for a second and say that, um.. I just encourage everybody who hears this album to look towards Christ and not towards people, because people allow you to fall away, people aren't perfect. Theres only one person that's perfect and that's Christ. And I see people every day who are looking at Christ and blow Christ off because something that someone else has failed on. And its just not worth it, Christ has blessed me and every other member of this band more than any other way that I can imagine, or be spoken. Just the way everything worked out tonight was just beautiful. I just pray for each and every one of you, we wouldn't sit here and we wouldn't do this unless we wouldn't put the time into it unless it was trying to touch you, trying to reach your life and I just ask please just give your heart to Christ, and allow him to come in and just accept him. It says, "If you acknowledge that you have sinned and you ask Christ to come into you life, he will enter you life just believe that he's died on the cross for your and risen on the third day, and Christ can life for you and he with you?? and I just pray that you just give him that chance to do that, you don't know what you missed, you don't know what you missed until you haven't had something and realize that its gone, then you realize what you've missed and what hasn't been in your life. And I just ask you please just give the LORD a chance to do that and I just hear a lot of people say that its just, I hear a lot of people say that its just you know, "Oh?? you know, "this some religious person is trying to force this down my throat.?? well that's not our intent our intent's not to force this down your throat. We do this because we love you and we care for the people that do hear this. And I just wish everybody just to look towards it and give it a chance, and not fall out. There is hope, you can find it, and Christ is hope and your never gonna feel a void, your never gonna feel that huge gap and that void in your life until you turn and you look at the truth, even though you may not see it as the truth, I just pray that God will reveal himself to you and you can open your eyes, just as we were in your same shoes and he opened ours, he opened our eyes eyes.. just... even though it's this late you can't even speak, I just pray that He'll please just show you his power. This album goes out to just, the victims of rape and suicide, child molestation, people who are broken hearted, people who just cant handle life anymore and just have to fall on their knees every night and cry. There is a better way, and we have found it, please don't give up, there is a better way.

Spirit of, the living God
Call fresh on, me
Spirit of, the living God
Fall fresh on me
Melt me, Mold me
Fill me, LORD use me
Spirit of, the living God
Fall fresh on, me
Spirit of, the living God
Fall fresh on, me
Fill me, Mold me
Fill me, Use me,
Spirit of, the living God
Fall fresh on, me
LORD melt me, LORD use me, LORD fill me, LORD mold me
LORD make me, the person you want me to be LORD.
LORD take me, and mold my, my mind.
Renew my mind LORD, help me not to listen to this world, politicians people of this world, who only long to bring me hate and frustration.
Help me to think for myself, to obtain knowledge, think! think for my self
Spirit of, the living God
Fall fresh on, me
