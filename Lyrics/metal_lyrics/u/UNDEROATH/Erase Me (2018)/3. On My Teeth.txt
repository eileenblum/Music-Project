Let's get this straight
I'm fine without you
I'm not your fucking prey
So save yourself
And no one else

What you believe
Your life is a lie
Get over it

You got the best of me
You stabbed me in the back
I taste you on my teeth
You're like a heart attack
And I'm not okay
I'm headed down the drain
I still feel safe
Down here where I belong

So where were you
When I fell out
Went back into the dark
I'm lost again
So don't come find me

What you believe
Your life is a lie
Get over it

One day you might be hungry
