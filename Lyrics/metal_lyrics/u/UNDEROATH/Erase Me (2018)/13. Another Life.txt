[Bonus Track]You walked away
And it saved me
I was tired and lonely
But hey its ok
I can finally sleep now it's over
Yeah, it's over
Well I'd pray, but I forgot how
I forgot how to feel wanted
I was so unwanted

You make me so unhappy
I just want to be free
You make me so unhappy
Why can't you let me be?

Maybe I'm better off dead
I swear I'm barely alive
Not enough fear in my head
To keep me by your side
After all the things you said
I've been tryin' to figure out
What's wrong with me
It's not me, it's not me

You're not gonna ruin my life
You're not gonna ruin my life
You're not gonna ruin my..

So watch me find another life
And hey, its ok to drift apart and start over
I'm sorry its over

You make me so unhappy
I just want to be free

Maybe I'm better off dead
I swear I'm barely alive
Not enough fear in my head
To keep me by your side
After all the things you said
I've been tryin' to figure out
What's wrong with me
It's not me, it's not me

You're not gonna ruin my life
You're not gonna ruin my life
You're not gonna ruin my life!

I'm better off this way
Just let me be!

Maybe I'm better off dead
I swear I'm barely alive
Maybe I'm better off dead
I swear I'm barely..

Maybe I'm better off dead
I swear I'm barely alive
Not enough fear in my head
To keep me by your side
After all the things you said
I've been tryin' to figure out
What's wrong with me
It's not me, it's not me

You're not gonna ruin my life
You're not gonna ruin my life
You're not gonna ruin my life!
You're not gonna ruin my life!
God you're not gonna ruin mine!
