[Bonus Track]Dragged out on my back
Everyone look - I'm still a wreck
Are you happy now?
I can't hear you, are you happy now?

'Cause the damage is done, I'm the damaged one

I know something 'bout loneliness
You know nothing, you never did
You say I've walked alone, but don't you fear my friend
I've faced my death alone
I know how it feels to be a ghost...ghost...
I'm just a ghost

You say it follows me where I go
I'm a ghost
Don't make me swallow my tongue

'Cause the damage is done, I'm the damaged one

I know something 'bout loneliness
You know nothing, you never did
You say I've walked alone, but don't you fear my friend
I've faced my death alone
I know how it feels to be a ghost...ghost...
I'm just a ghost

Don't you watch me when I walk away
Don't you watch me when I walk away
Don't you watch me when I walk away
Don't you watch me when I walk away
...

I know something 'bout loneliness
You know nothing, you never did
You say I've walked alone, but don't you fear my friend
I've faced my death alone
I know how it feels to be a ghost...ghost...ghost...ghost...
I'm just a ghost
