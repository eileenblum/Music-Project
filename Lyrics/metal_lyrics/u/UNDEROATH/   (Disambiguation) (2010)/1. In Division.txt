I lay in a bed of resistance
Chained to either side
I really wish I could, reset, rewind
Someone has clawed out my eyes
Can't identify
I really wish I could, reset, rewind
You know it's never the way we planned it
I really wish we could, reset, rewind
I'm planning a revolution, inside my head
I'm planning a revolution, when I break free
I call for annihilation
Describe the sunlight so I can feel its burn
If only I could get up from this bed

I don't know what they told you
But this place is not what you think
(Reset! Rewind!)

Living inside a hole, they put me underground
Where they could never find me unless they dig me out
I search for the answers
'Cause this is the end
I search for the answers

God, it's caving in on me
I feel them watching
But no one seems to care anymore
I'm digging, I'm digging my way out
'Cause when I'm breathing, there is no release

I can't believe this! I can't believe this!
My mind is starting to turn on me!

I've been living inside a hole, they put me underground
Where they could never find me unless they dig me out
I've been living inside a hole, they put me underground
Where they could never find me unless they dig me out
