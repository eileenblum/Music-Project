What a sad, sad picture to paint
Of a dirty, dirty little soul
We are so blind here
Won't you watch us all fall apart
I find it hard to believe in it, believe in it
Believe in what you give to me
I never thought I would find you here, find you here
Find you buried in chemicals
So tie a rope the either side, either side
And let's see how your limbs hold up
Eventually we will sink or swim, sink or swim
Sink into the great abyss
