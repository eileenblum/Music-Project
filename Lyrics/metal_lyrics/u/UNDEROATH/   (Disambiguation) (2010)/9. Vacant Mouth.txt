I took this picture in the dark
Spinning in lights till we fell apart
So turn it away, turn it away
You don't know what I've seen
The youth is hollow and so are we
They give it away, they give it away

This is what it feels like, this is disintegration
This is what it feels like, this is isolation

I can't find the light
Inside this empty room, I cannot find myself
I can't find the light
I won't let you down, I won't let you down

I hold on by a single thread
Sweet solitude is so complete in my head, in my head
You watch me dangle there and become just a memory
Like they said, like they said
Like they said I would end up

The youth is marching to tear us down
We built our lives here
We fight their calling
The youth is marching to tear us down
We built our lives here
We fight their calling

Take sides, take sides
Line up and take sides, take sides

I'm so sick of you calling the shots (I'll tear you down from the inside)
I'm so sick of you calling the shots (I'll tear you down from the inside)

I can't find the light
Inside this empty room, I seem to lose myself
I can't find the light
I won't let you down, I won't let you down

So write this down
I'm not using my lungs anymore
This is the last time
Write it down
I won't be your voice anymore
