Awake, to the sound of emptiness
Alone in a room that's filled with the darkest of light
I was told there was nothing beyond here
How do I know what side I'm on
How do I know what side I'm on
How do I know what side I'm on
How do I know what side I'm on
Bred a captive with nothing but their thoughts engraved in my skin
I don't belong here, but I can't find my exit

This is where they all come to hunt me down, hunt me down
Where they come to hunt me down, they hunt me down

Weigh out the options
Brave the new world
I know what you're thinking
Come on man, I swear you can do this
Come on man, I swear you can do this

I break free from this room they built for me
I break free from this room they built for me

This is where they all come to hunt me down, hunt me down
Where they come to hunt me down, they hunt me down

I tore out my naive eyes, so they locked me up
I tore out my naive eyes, so they locked me up

Preying on the innocent
Preying on the innocent
