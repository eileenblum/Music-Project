So follow me to the empty ocean
We can watch the city descend behind the skylight
On our backs we float away
And forget about the way it used to be

Tonight, I fail
But I never wanted to let you drown without me
Tonight, we are the only ones to watch it fall apart

We slide into our place where I can watch you swim
Don't forget my hands are still wrapped around your neck

We fall deeper into the ground
This nights never looked so hollow
I wanted to share this with you, with you
I'll wait until it opens up again
Sit here till the water reaches our neck
Finally get to watch them wash away my name

Tonight, I fail
But I never wanted to let you drown without me

Open your lungs, follow me down
Open your lungs, follow me down
I set this off
Keep swimming, keep swimming
Oh God, I am emptier than you...
