We are nothing, they own our lives
Just a statue of a stain in time
We are nothing, they own our lives
Spinning in circles, got left behind

We were all warned this would happen
But the words just rang in our ears
Machines, built by machines
Built by machines
Built by machines
Built by machines

We can only hide for so long, for so long
Before they harvest us for the souls that we have left
But we can only hide for so long, for so long
Before they harvest us for the souls that we have left

I swear we cannot wake up from this hell that we live in (we can't wake up)
But when the sun finally hits our face (we can't wake up)
We see that we are merely reflections of reflections left by our predecessors (we can't wake up)
Dragged through the mud (we can't wake up)
Chained by the ankle (we can't wake up)
There is no more running, there is no more escaping (we can't wake up)
If only God could lay his hands down on this barren land and wake us up (we can't wake up)
Because we are the lost (we can't wake up)
We are the helpless (we can't wake up)
We are the forgotten ones (we can't wake up)
We are the lost (we can't wake up)
And we are the abandoned (we can't wake up)

I swear it's worth, saving us
We pray for the sun, to dry us up
I need a clearer head, to see what we're worth
There's still life left down here to revolt
Oh, I know what it looks like from there
A loss of control to this place and we're set to extinct

I swear, I swear it's worth saving us
Oh I swear, I swear it's worth saving us
Oh I swear, I swear it's worth saving us
I swear, I swear...

Revolt! Revolt!
We stood by defeat for so long, for so long
Revolt! Revolt!
We stood by defeat for so long, for so long
We've been under you're control
We've been under you're control
We will not be a part of your disease
