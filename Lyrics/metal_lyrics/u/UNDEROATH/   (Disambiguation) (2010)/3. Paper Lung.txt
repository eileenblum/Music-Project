(It's too late)
(It's too late, now, to pry away)
(To pry away)
My candle burns on both ends so where does it leave us
Standing emptier than we ever left you
With your head in the water it's getting harder to breathe
So stand up, stand up

It's too late, to pry away
It's too late, to pry away

Don't get me wrong, I'm just as scared as you are now
You dropped us off here with no direction
But you never even tried to fight the current
Watch the water pouring faster into your lungs
So breathe in, breathe in

It's too late, to pry away
It's too late, to pry away

But it's hard to hear me when your sinking, down, here
I wanna see you wash it down, wash it down
How can you sleep here
I bear the weight of your world
I don't believe in a single word you sold to me, sold to me
I bear your burden for the last time
I swear I'm done with all of this

It's too late, to pry away from the undertow
I watch it take you, then I walk away
