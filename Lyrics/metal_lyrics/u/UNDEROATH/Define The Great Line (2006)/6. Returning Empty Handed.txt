How peaceful it feels against my face
Oh, what a long haul
You brought me here for this
I see nothing but disaster
Now I'm taking you with me

A transparent scenery that comes as fast as it leaves

Now my eyes flash with the white
It's settling in with all the flickering

Here again
The floor is more fitting for my face

Here again? This is getting old

I am being watched
This is overwhelming
Paranoia...

As you dig your feet in I will sink my teeth into the floor,
While I lay here alone

As the light begins to breach the border,
While I lay here alone

Aware of every step
I'm not aware at all
Black... flash white... I am awake
