The time has come for you to sit this out
To fit inside your mold
Would be to sell myself short

This ground we tread upon
Is now filling up to our necks
We turn the pages left to right
We see everything

Oh, my story's growing, it is on my last request
Don't make me feel so contradicting
There's no room for cheating and being yourself
Failure leaves such a bitter taste in my mouth

And on the last hour
We write so many new chapters again
And on the outside
Where there are no surprises

Oh, it's getting longer
To see it through their eyes
Would bring me so much closer
You can do this night after night
Failure leaves such a bitter taste in my mouth

Taste and see, I swear I know what's good
Be still and know that they won't lie to you every single time you're facing lies
I know why you never take your eyes off me
I've used my lungs for everything but breathing

I find myself dried up in this conversation
So pull me out, pull me aside
