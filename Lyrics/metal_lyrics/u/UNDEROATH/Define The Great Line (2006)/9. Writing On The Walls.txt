Maybe we, why don't we sit right here for half an hour?
We'll speak of what a waste I am, and how we missed your beat again!

I swear we need to find some comfort in this run down place
To bridge the gap of this conscious state that we live in
And I'm short of time

How come you try
(that brings us home)
To fit the shape of
(and i pray for)
what they tell you
(you to move on, move on)
But mostly what they show you

At this rate we can't give up
(I'm taking back all the things I said. I'm taking back all the things I
said)
But I sure can't just sit still
(Keep me filled in. I swear I'll come)

We walk alone,
We walk alone,
We walk alone,
We walk alone,
We walk alone,
We walk alone, back home
Alone back home

You're almost gone and I'm ok (I still say you're sorry) to give you chance to be afraid
But never your face again
I remember your presence

I hope to God you come down
I hope to God you can feel this now
I hope to, god you come down
I hope to,
(God)

I know there must be some way out of here and all of them will be waiting there
