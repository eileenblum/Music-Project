Blessed are we, the unlawful ones!
Blessed are we, the transgressive spirits!
Blessed are we, the denying ones!
Blesses are we, proclaiming rebirth!
None of tour words, shall ever menace me
And none of your curses shall make me relinquish
We possess the strength unknown to you
We crush the morals you dare not question
We disdain those before (whom) you kneel
We abhor and bash your commandments
None of tour words, shall ever menace me
And none of your curses shall make me relinquish
I shall not kneel
And I am the unstoppable
I rebel against
All this bullshit, this nonsense!
