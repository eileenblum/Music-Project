Since we appeared
On the blue planet
We have stood
Against the laws of nature
We now perform
Genetic transmutations
Our foolish behavior
Resulted in global pestilence

After a relatively short existence
On earth determined by blind laws of progress.

We reached
The yet
Unlocked
Gate of self-fucking-destruction

In the blink of an eye our glorious development
All our lives can perish in one nuclear wave

Third millennium the new dimension of pain!
