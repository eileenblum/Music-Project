Beware your death SS coming
Shadow warriors arriving
We crush our foes with fury
And we do not take captives

Denizens of tarterus
Will ally with us during this battle
"Quar'valsharess" inspires us
To proclaim the triumph of chaos

Our swords will remain thirsty
Until they quench with blood
And devour the flesh of
"Darthiiren" and "Rivvin"

Inside us the frenzy's growing
We crave to release our anger
We are strong enough
To conquer and enslave them all!!!

You will understand
The meaning of my motto
When I swiftly put my dagger
Straight into your heart

"Those who watch
Their backs
Meet death
From the front"

Onslaught

From victory to an inn
