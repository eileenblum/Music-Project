Walking beyond gravity
Traveller through endless times

The living flame
The burning torch
The northern star
The southern storm!!!

All who hide in shadows
Pursuing her
All who saw the prophecy
They could not bear
Face the end that's coming
See the truth unveiled
Watch the world that's falling
Reframed ...reframed ...reframed!!!

On debris
of the old world
The new order
Shall recreate
Don't look behind
Don't stop and run
Take a deep breath
Face the undone

Deep in the last outposts of humanity
Fortified and guarded by an uninviting mists
The royal blood and downfall incarnation
The cursed gene igniting extermination
The side product of vindictive days
The youngest doyenne with mutilated face
Hidden and released in her hour
Her destiny is to enter the tower ...the tower ...the tower!!!

On debris
of the old world
The new order
Shall recreate
Don't look behind
Don't stop and run
Take a deep breath
Face the undone
