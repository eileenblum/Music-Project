For more than two fucking thousand years
You spread your plague throughout the universe
Your pack of lies became philosophy
And fanatic were becoming saints

Lubricious popes
Pedophiliac priests
Vatican is the monument of hypocrisy

The only reason for your existence
The only way why you still here
The only excuse for all your crimes
Is the fear of damnation, you try to feed us

Lubricious popes
Pedophiliac priests
Vatican is the monument of hypocrisy

You hate the flesh if it's beautiful
You fear the mind if it's open
You hate the beings that don't abide you
Who don't kneel, You love the gold around your (fucking) neck

Lubricious popes
Pedophiliac priests
Vatican is the monument of hypocrisy
