I confront thee!!!
The mythic ruler of the universe
With genuine!!!
Will to trial thy lengthy rain
Confront Me!!!
The spawn of freedom and rationality
The mortal one!!!
BORN TO THIS EARTH!!!!!
Repulsive!!!
Is thy rotten mind and tasteless soul
Secluded!!!
Is the kingdom of thy followers
Seductive!!!
Are the promises you made
Disquieting!!!
Are the threats you cast upon the hordes of...

INFIDELS!!!!!
Our anger is rising
Our souls are free again
Our minds and hearts are the weapon of choice you fear most!!!

I am the one to crush the lies forevermore
I am the flame and the pulverizer of thy throne
PREPARE FOR WAR!!!
Since I enter the mental realm of thee
Since I come to tear thy dignity and smash thy dreams
And lay My sword upon thy throat in...
Single GOD KILLING COUP DE GRACE!!!!
