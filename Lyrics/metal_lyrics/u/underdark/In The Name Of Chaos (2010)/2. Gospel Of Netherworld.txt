The centuries ago
The world was drowned in pain
Slaves obeyed they masters
Scourges ...hit the backs!!!

Through dark medieval nights is where I wander
Fear and grief I intersperse
Curse for the living is what I am
Blessed by the ones who dwell in ...Netherworld!!!

Gospel of Hades was written with My hand
Blood of angels has sprayed My shield
Deity of fire girdled by My prophets
Manifest of heinousness uncharted

I triumph over servants
of parochial god
I bring the might and power
I'm holding the rod
I dream the darkest dreams
I howl in solitude
My legion grows in power
Unrivalled (...magnitude)!!!

Gospel of hades was written with My hand
Blood of angels has sprayed My shield
My spine is thrilled with ecstasy
The tantric storm of cruelty
Deity of fire girdled by My prophets
Manifest of heinousness
Uncharted lands (...lands) awaiting Me
Netherworld is the power that be ...forever ...be!!!
