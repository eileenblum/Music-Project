Rise!!!!!!
The ancient spirits
Evoke!!!!!
The flamboyant stars
Burn!!!!!
The fears to the core
Tear!!!!!
The weakness apart

In front of the throne I stand
...Enter the path of sin...
In delight I await
...Enter the path of sin...
The gates are open wide for Me
...Enter the path of sin...

With my deeds I will rebuild the temple of fornication
With my will I shall restore the fallen sacreligium
As a victor I'll take the spoils and blasphemate them
As a heathen king I'll bring to life the fallen minions

Oppressed for as long kept in acrid unawareness
The millions of souls blindly following the common rules
The total lack of thoughts, the fear of solitude and nothingness
Creates the race of slaves, the servile hordes deserving only pity

The battle flag is raised!
The wind are blowing hard
The triumph is at hand
The tyrant's reign shall end
The roaring sound of horns (...storm...)
The seal of victory
The unnamed warriors come
With the chaos stars on their plates!!!
