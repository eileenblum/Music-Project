We are the cold merciless hand
That kills the weak and sprinkles pain
We are the edge of razor sharp blade
That sculps the tides of history

Out evil ...evil ...evil!!!
Out demons ...demons
Out darkness ...darkness ...darkness!!!
Out malice ...malice
Out murder ...murder ...murder!!!
Out deicide ...deicide
Out poison ...poison ...poison!!!
Out nightmare ...nightmare

For countless times the icons of genocide
Dreamt of fulfillment of...
How long ago have they spread the plague of war?
The thing rooted in their flaming souls
Miles away from the sun and stars
In the realm of barbaric asperity

The incarnates of artism, treason and malignity
Creators of chaos, followers of code of chaos
In the name of ancient demon goddess
Creators of chaos...
In the name of ancient demon goddess...

IN THE NAME OF CHAOS!!!!!
