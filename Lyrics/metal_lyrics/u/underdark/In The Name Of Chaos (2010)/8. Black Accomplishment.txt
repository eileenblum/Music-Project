How deep lies the root of our hatred
How far can we push the boundaries of consciousness
Is it the time?
Is it the place?
To trigger the cloud of blackness!!!

Ultrin ...ultrin ...ultrin...

No senile gods
No foolish truths
No compromise
No longer the imprisonment
Beyond the gates of reality
Beyond the aeons
Beyond the thousands years of grief
The mighty ones released again
Will personify the deepest fears of your existence
Will drown the world in fire!!!

The cold-heart assassins
The necromancers obsessed with conspiring
The ones desiring black accomplishment
The demons craving for zounds of ritual sacrifices
