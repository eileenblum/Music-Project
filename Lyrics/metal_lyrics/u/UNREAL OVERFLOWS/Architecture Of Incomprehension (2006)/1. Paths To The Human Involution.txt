On the edge of the beginning of the end
The way is stained with the shed blood

Where the future is wrapped in the hate's dark veil
Where the dim flame of the existence fights not to go out

We walk aimlessly as puppets
Where the power fills our brains up with lies and promises
We are used to create and to destroy
To struggle and to give life

Our destiny is handled by their whim
They create hates which are destroyed later

We are an elimination objective
As soon as we raise our voice
As soon we are against their guidelines
As soon as we decide to think in a different way

Let's fight to look for a light
That will guides us over the understanding
We must try to obtain routes to avoid
The barriers of the human incomprehension

Let's destroy the frontiers of hate
Why eliminate ourselves across wars
Not to cause pain, not to rouse hate
Simply to be listened!

Our destiny is handled by their whim
They create hates which are destroyed later

We are an elimination objective
As soon as we raise our voice
As soon we are against their guidelines
As soon as we decide to think in a different way
