There is a lake of dreams in me
Where I see dawn and sadness
Where I am trying to not submerge

The pain does not satisfy me
While cries and moans increase
In my subconscious

I want to end and wake up
I want to hate you while I smile
And I fight against myself to not do it

I am proud of my lust
My pleasure expressions surprise me
While I look for an exit
In this alternative reality

Hate is a sweet scent
Which flows freely in me
I do not distinguish with clarity the reality

I am tired of this false way
Depressive lie that you call life
Genetic code erasedâ¦

I feel it touching me inside
I want to leave it
Psycho-thought
