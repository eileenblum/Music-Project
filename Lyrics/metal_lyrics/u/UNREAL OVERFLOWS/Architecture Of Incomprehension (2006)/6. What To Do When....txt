So tied and so downtrodden
So void like a lonely life
Like a thousand misfortunes
No comparable to a failure in our childhood

What to do when we die in the streets
What to do when there are no answers
In our home

And with no answer
We will be empty like our future

Without help, without destiny
We are not into a living sphere
Without help, with nothingâ¦

Repentant or forgiven is unsuccessful
Years of respect lost

Our first events stand out
And our last unfinished events

What to do when we die in the streets
What to do when there are no answers
In our home

And with no answer
We will be empty like our future
