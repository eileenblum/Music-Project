It is like a light that blinds me
All that I see disappears every minute that passes
I cannot breath
Come into me to help me
My illusions escape
I want to continue seeing you
This horrible pain, I hate it!
Destroying me. I loose the consciousness
Inside me. It is finishing with me

Cold, I hear only sobs when I am dying
Cold, I see only tears when I am dying
I want to stop crying. Please kill me!

The light becomes darkness. I hear sirens coming
The light is a humid hole where I am going down
This is not happening

The light is not yet
The faint is waiting
The air does not yet in me
Everything terrifies me
This horrible pain, I hate it!
Destroying me. I loose the consciousness
Inside me. It is finishing with me

Cold, I hear only sobs when I am dying
Cold, I see only tears when I am dying
I want to stop crying. Please kill me!

It possess my balance getting my senses out
It is killing my reason. Get it out now

It possess my senses
It possess our senses

It possess my balance getting my senses out
It is killing my reason
