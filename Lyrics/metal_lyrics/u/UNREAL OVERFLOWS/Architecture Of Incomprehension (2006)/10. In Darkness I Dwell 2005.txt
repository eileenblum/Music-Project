What living being endowed with senses does not love light over all that surrounds him?
But the deep sadness of darkness is a breath of life for me. That is why I turn to the night

Far away the world is lying in his deserted and lonely room
Unknowing dark moves souls he hides under his cloak away from him

Now I want to sink into drops of drew, to mix me with the shadows desires
I want the dark to devour my body and dissolve me into the night

Does the morning always have to come?
Will the earth's power ever end?
A sinister bustle let's as now the sun will not burn forever

I feel now night's empire throws the shadows of a twilight without return over us

Now I know that I am what I am because the night, and I can raise my eyes. I am hers
Night opened infinite eyes in me which see further than pale ones
Of those who proclaim miseries

Praise be to the night. Praise be to the dream
An endless way to do. Night control our faith

Light is going, night will come riding shadows
Sacred dream. Dream forever without fear to wake
Light has gone, night is coming riding shadows
Sacred dream. Dream forever. I am inside of your life

Days of light are numbered, I know. My uppermost sense tells me so
I know when it will be the last morning, the last dawn over the earth

Does the morning always have to come?
Will the earth's power ever end?
A sinister bustle let's as now the sun will not burn forever

Now I know that I am what I am because the night, and I can raise my eyes. I am hers
Night opened infinite eyes in me which see further than pale ones of those who proclaims miseries
