What pleasure is not to go on watching
The flames that cremate bodies every day
All my fears are seen in you
I watch them like in a mirror
To grow in me every moment

Look at here and you will cry
I am more and more nervous
I have got a dark feeling to you, dammed!

Cryings which are heard at dawn
The wind makes them remain to I never forget
That I am dead
That we are dead
And we will die in your eyes, dammed!

Children are a grey cloak
And as come from the heaven
Torn apart, their faces are a symbol of sadness
I am dead
We are dead
And we will die in your eyes, dammed!

Please, come with me
I need you save me!

Nothing has changed
I have shouted him a suffering
He has not heard me
I am drying myself crazy
My friends are not
I do not want you heard!
I have got a dark feeling to you, dammed!
