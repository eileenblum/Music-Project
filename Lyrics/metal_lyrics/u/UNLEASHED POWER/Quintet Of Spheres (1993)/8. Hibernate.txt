Defective machine dictating inane
For all its intent the crisis remain

Not to read and write
A disease we must fight
Incarcerated by no insight

Impervious to the lasting effect
Which carries through life as a strong defect

Not to read and write
A disease we must fight
Incarcerated by no insight

Because of this fallacy
Unaware of an event
Imposing this malady
Inveigled by false intent
Delete the education
Culminate in ignorance
Knowledge in hibernation
Wait to have deliverance

Words spoken but not read
How can we escape this dread
No one reads no one writes
Must secure our birth rights
The power inside subject to arise
In hibernation waiting to devise

Not to read and write
A disease we must fight
Incarcerated by no insight

Incapable of literacy
Awareness has been reduced
By their inadequacy
Lunacy has been induced
