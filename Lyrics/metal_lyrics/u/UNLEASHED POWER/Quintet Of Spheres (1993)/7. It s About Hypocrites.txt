The grimaces of surprise
Turn around no mass no size
Mechanical entity
Conscience with no gravity
Idealism of youth
Vanished along with the truth
The message they don't believe
Subconsciously they deceive
Abhor the changing of time
A government in decline
Habitant in a void space
Hypocrites reside in this place

It is all about the hypocrites
Who mock with our intelligence
The double morals become the norm
Not telling the truth propaganda
They have forgotten the real reasons
The seats they uphold twisting the form
The traitors and the thieves immune to the law
Bureaucracy and bigotry that won't thaw
Interest shifted away from the objective
Vanished enthusiasm and incentive

Mandatory involvement
In the game they repent
Exercise their wrongful force
Their power we must divorce
It's all about hypocrites
Whose lies and deceit won't quit
Impudent glow from the screen
The joker jests in this scene
Send a defiled delegate
So their lies will propagate
The grimaces of surprise
Turn around no mass no size

It is all about the hypocrites
Who mock with our intelligence
The double morals become the norm
Not telling the truth propaganda
They have forgotten the real reasons
The seats they uphold twisting the form
