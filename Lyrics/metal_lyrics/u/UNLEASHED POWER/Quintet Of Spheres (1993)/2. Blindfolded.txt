It is immortal with uncanny will
It will be leading the merciless kill
Once again it strikes
Arms and grief will grow
History tells us
All we need to know
The relentless lies
Penetrates them all
Glory can't be found
The nation will fall
It is immortal with uncanny will
It will be leading the merciless kill

The sins will be committed
Hiding behind a lie
By distorted sight
The different must die

A continent got torn
A nation with sick dreams
The incubus is born
The rnalaise tears up the seams

The hatred was the same
People throe and they pang
The slough of despond came
The demon is showing his fangs

There are corpses and destruction all around
Prejudice and fanatics to be found
Atrocity has come to reign with pain
They march in pride by this deranged campaign
In self-righteousness deluded with hate
Changing the world and forever its fate

It is immortal with uncanny will
It will be leading the merciless kill

Took what they believed
Belonged to their domain
Never mind who's there
Spreading fear and pain
Crumbled in the dust
Beauty from the Past
Can't be found again
Demolished and trashed

It is immortal with uncanny will
It will be leading the merciless kill
