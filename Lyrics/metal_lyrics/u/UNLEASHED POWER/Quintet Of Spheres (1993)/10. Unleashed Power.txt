Here is gloomy dark and cold
The terror has been unfold
Destructive power will erupt
This madness has to be stopped

Unleashed power is released
It's making this world diseased
Polluted landscape is devoid
Too much of nature is exploit

When will they deliberate
See the growth that suffocate
Look what's going on around
Are there grace to be found

Unleashed power is released
It's making this world diseased
Polluted landscape is devoid
Too much of nature is exploit

The fire sweeps over the plain
What are we going to obtain
How long can the balance last
The obstacle is too vast

Unleashed power is released
It's making this world diseased
Polluted landscape is devoid
Too much of nature is exploit
