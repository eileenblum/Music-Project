Perpetual absurdity
Festered by incredulity
Unreasonable and closed minded
Resolutions uninvited
Thrive on inert disputation
Revel in equivocation
Reverberate the futile task
To discard the troth less mask

Tantalized impetuous and tense
Dereliction of benevolence
The omission of faith and facts
Validity of everyday acts

The envoy of sophistry

Dwelling in disappointment
And restrained by bewilderment
Misinterpret sum and substance
Progressing the mind's impotence

The envoy of sophistry

Probing the anesthetic insight
Respite to resolve or recite
Committed into transgressions
No time for lasting impressions
Never to achieve fruition
And transcend the limitation
A journey through a narrow path
To amplify anger and wrath
