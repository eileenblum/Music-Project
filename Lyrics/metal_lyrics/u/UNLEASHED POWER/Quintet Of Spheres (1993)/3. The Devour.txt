Started with miscalculation
Stick to rage for your salvation
How will you get on your feet
You're too involved in deceit
Watch you die in your own spells
Return the devour to where it dwells

Can't you see your life's at stake
When will you realize your own mistake

Feel the pain when it returns
Strip your soul your inside burns
Desolate your own mind screams
Wasted life and no more dreams
Every attempt's bound to fail
Try to avoid, the treacherous trail

Another day in a living hell
Return the devour to where it dwells
Can you free yourself of this curse
No remedy it must reverse

Understand the end is near
Blinded by the reign of fear
Sell your life for the next day
The last resort is to pray
Doomed to eternal damnation
Just another failed expectation

Can't you see your life's at stake
When will you realize your own mistake

Another day in a living hell
Return the devour is where it dwells
Can you free yourself of this curse
No remedy it must reverse
