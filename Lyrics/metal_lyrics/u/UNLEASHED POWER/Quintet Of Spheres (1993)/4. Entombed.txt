Violating the old rules
Strangers to this land
The creatures fall at this hand
Severed bones and limbs taken
By superstition and greed
Beauty destroyed by this deed

Cynical annihilation
Of all the creations
Not a chance for evasions
Unnecessary killing
Scintillating in their rooms
The species we will entomb
The balance interrupted
Recalling the archaic time
Museum piece enshrouded
Hear the death bells chime

Senseless eradication
They must be killed and sold
Extinction of life
Tales that must be told

Pernicious interference
Egoistic belief
Proliferation of grief
In concordant harmony
Destroyed by the human pest
Implant the infectious nest
