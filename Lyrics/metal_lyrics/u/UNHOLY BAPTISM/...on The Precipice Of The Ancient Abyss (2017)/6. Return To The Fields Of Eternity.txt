Deep in the moonlit forests,
shadows of mountains.
shrouded in a cold mist.
The forests speak, tales of
ancient secrets and untold sorrow.
Follow the song of the wind,
whispering in the impenetrable woods
echoes of the past.
A cold, lifeless night, descended
from the frozen black reaches.
The fog descends, consuming
the heavens in endless darkness.

As I walk within the halls of the dead,
I hear whispers, forgotten secrets.
Traveling above ancient sepulchers,
I hear the baying of wolves.

Descending upon the world,
oceans of clouds, enshrouding,
devouring the night sky.
Fading into existence,
dimensions of space as
the heavens are consumed.

Entombed, my bones return
to the earth that once birthed me.
Whispering, deafening,
as the silent snow falls.
Here I shall remain,
lost and forgotten.

Surrounded by
the sentinels
screaming to
be set free.
