Left in the shadows,
alone and cold.
Lying crying and screaming
for death's cold embrace.
Cursing the name of God.
Shattered, broken
living in fear of the
mask of anguish,
the mask that you wear
to hide yourself
from the worlds beyond.

Surrounded by darkness,
the world becomes black.
Look deep, inside the shadows,
what do you see?
Your beauty, a facade,
a stranger with no place.
Gaze out to the endless seas
and despair.

Within the swirling chaos
the abyss stares back.

Staring into the black;
unveiling the mysteries
deep within.
Inside the darkness,
hopeless, pursued
by endless horrors.

The path that you follow
leaves you desolate and empty.
As the night descends,
a funeral dirge inside your head.
A lonely gasp of frigid air,
lost among the shadows.

Staring into the black;
on the precipice of
insanity's reign.
Let not the light tempt you,
and let your dreams fall
into oblivion.
