Carried on the wings of Satan,
deep within the chasms of
the ancient abyss.
Bringing eternal night,
blood red storms plaguing the sky.
Born from the outer reaches
of the mighty, endless dark
descending, descending.

Summoned from ancient dimensions,
anointed in blood.
Raining down storms of destruction
upon the mortal realm.
Cleansing fires
of damnation's reign,
burning in the moonlight,
calling His name.

Fallen from the heavens,
the black god of ancient stars.
Defying heaven's law
covered in ash and death.
God of infinite power
grant me your wisdom.

Power insurmountable,
reigning in the endless flames.
The great serpent, lord of shadow.
No light hath shone
in the corners of forgotten realms.

O great lord of night!
O great god of shadow!
We shall forever sing
songs in praise of thee!
