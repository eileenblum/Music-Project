Follow me, desolate soul,
into the depths of unknown.
Look to the north
as the black light shines.
Pray to the south,
as the shadows descend.
Beckoned from shrouded thrones,
through mystic rituals.

Feel the serpent's breath upon your neck,
the darkness consumes.

Almighty gods of forgotten ages,
grant me your wisdom.
Summoning ancient spirits
from the endless shadows,
Lords of terror and hate,
grant me your power.

Descend from your thrones!
Enshroud us in your darkness!

Descending on winds of destruction,
bathe us in your light!
Come forth, Lucifer!
Ascending from the deepest waters,
envelop us with your might!
Come forth, Leviathan!
Lord of blasphemy, lord of lies,
weave thy spells against the light!
Come forth, Belial!
King of the eternal fires,
exert your dominion!
Come forth, Satan!
