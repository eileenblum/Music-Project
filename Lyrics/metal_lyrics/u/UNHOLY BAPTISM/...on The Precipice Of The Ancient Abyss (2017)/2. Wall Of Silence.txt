Black rivers flow silently,
eroding memories, leaving
me empty in halls of
reflection, mirroring
something unrecognizable.
I have wandered these empty woods
for what seems like eternity, no hope.
Shadows dance in the moonlight
as a cold wind descends, piercing
through the flesh and the stone.

Surrounded by silence.

Distant voices scream from the edge of the woods.
The triumphant howling of wolves.
A blackened forest hiding secrets within its walls,
a dreamlike moon frozen in time.

I heard the voices then, singing,
a glorious melody.
Stirring deep within, a passing
reflection staring back,
surrounded by enveloping darkness.
A raven flaps its wings in the night,
meeting my gaze as I search for life,
yet we both find nothing.
The reflection trembles, relieving me
from the soul-piercing stare.

Surrounded by silence.

Distant voices scream from the depths of the woods.
The triumphant howling of wolves.
A blackened forest hiding secrets within its walls,
a dreamlike moon frozen in time.

I know I've been here before,
within these endless halls.
The chanting ceases, alone
again, as silence resumes.
I can hear nothing, nothing.
I can feel nothing, nothing...
