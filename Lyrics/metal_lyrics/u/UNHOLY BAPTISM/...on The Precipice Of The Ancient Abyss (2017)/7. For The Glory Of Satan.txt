Under the earth, eternally burning,
resides my master, the unholy one.
Down in the depths of the abyss,
forever resting, plotting His revenge.
Bow to the great serpent!
Pay homage to the beast!
Crucify the servants of the lord,
and destroy the god of old!

For the glory of Satan,
my lord and master.
The one true redeemer of souls,
rise up and spill the blood of the holy.

Marching in the name of Lucifer,
under the wings of the fallen angel.
We rise!
To carry out the command of Satan.
Destroying, burning and raping God's children.
We rise!

For the glory of Satan,
my lord and master.
The one residing in eternal fire,
rise up and spill the blood of the holy.

For the glory of Satan,
my lord and master.
The one who defies Christ,
rise up and spill the blood of the holy.

Under the earth, eternally burning,
resides my master, the unholy one.
Down in the depths of the abyss,
forever resting, plotting His revenge.
Bow to the great serpent!
Pay homage to the beast!
Crucify the servants of the lord,
and destroy the god of old!
