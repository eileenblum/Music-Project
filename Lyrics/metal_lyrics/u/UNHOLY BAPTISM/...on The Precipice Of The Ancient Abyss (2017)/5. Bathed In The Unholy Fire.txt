Pure evil, omnipresent,
a sense of impending ruin.
Freezing, binding death
as the torches blaze,
the flames of the abyss.
Inside the ancient tomb,
horrors await deep within
the bowels of the earth.

Bathed in the unholy fire.
Raped by the unholy ghost.
Bathed in the unholy fire.

Let yourself be freed
from the chains of the heavens.
Secrets revealed from
the ancient texts.
Cast off your shroud
and be reborn.

Read from the cryptic tome,
summoning gods of death.
The flames come to life,
furiously burning in the night.
Sacrificed, the cult
spills virgin blood.

Bathe in the cosmic light.
The endless devourer,
summoned from space and time.
Transcend this earthly tomb,
into unnameable dimensions
and blackened domains.

Bathed in the unholy fire.
Raped by the unholy ghost.
Bathed in the unholy fire.

Let yourself be freed
from the chains of the heavens.
Secrets revealed from
the ancient texts.
Cast off your shroud
and be reborn.

Cast down the gods
and burn the thrones of heavens.
