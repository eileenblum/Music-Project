Under a moonlit sky,
the feeling of emptiness,
longing, lost in the shadows.
Melancholic woodlands,
embraced by a cold mist.
Empires long passed
in forgotten ruin, an empty shell.
Satan, I bleed, on the
precipice of death,
I come to join thee.

None shall escape
the shadow of death!
None shall stand before
the coming darkness!

Cosmic force, envelop me,
I stain the ancient stones
with my blood, with my life.
Endless night, take me,
shall have my grief, my joy,
my very soul.

Under a moonlit sky,
ancient rites have begun.

Life returns to the earth
from which it was wrought,
suicide in ancient woodlands.
Father, bring me to your
worlds beyond, unknowably
so that I may serve.

None shall escape
the shadow of death!
None shall stand before
the coming darkness!
