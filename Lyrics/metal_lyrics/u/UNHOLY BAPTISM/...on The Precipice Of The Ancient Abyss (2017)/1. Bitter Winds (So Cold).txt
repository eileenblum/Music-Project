A blood-red sky,
a darkened sky,
purging the world of Heaven's light.
The moonlight, reflecting
from the new snow, fallen
from an ancient time.
The sun shall not rise,
worlds shattered
into eternal darkness.
The howling winds,
emanating through the night,
the horns of an invading army.
Bitter winds, biting
the flesh from my bones

I'm so fucking cold.
I'm so fucking cold.

The winds continue to howl,
frost withering the trees.
Desolation, stirring
death through my veins.
The cold air, oppressing
the lost wanderer.
Snow covered mountains,
the frozen northern winds
penetrating the night,
as the sun turns black,
sounding horns of eternal dusk.

I'm so fucking cold.
I'm so fucking cold.

My soul is frozen,
frigid as the northern peaks,
but ablaze with black fire.
Winter winds, corrupting eternity,
whispering only death.
