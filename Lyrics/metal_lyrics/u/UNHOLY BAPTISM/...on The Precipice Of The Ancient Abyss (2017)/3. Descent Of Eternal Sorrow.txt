"...through me you enter into the city of woes
through me you enter into eternal pain
through me you enter the population of loss.

Abandon all hope, you who enter here..."

Flaming gates, defiant,
echoes of damnation,
tormented, deafening screams.
Unknowable chaos, shifting
within dimensions of darkness.
Blazing fires, the heat of
a thousand suns,
the never-ending flames.

The flames are shining bright.
Look to the heavens and despair.
My master calls...

Descending into the flaming maw,
beyond the annals of time
and shifting realities.
Ancient power, lord of night,
forever in triumph.

The flames are shining bright.
The wind howls in response.

Down, descending forever
as the flames dance wildly.
The darkness is looming,
approaching dark lords,
forever separated from
God's iron will.
Trapped for eternity,
there is no escape.
