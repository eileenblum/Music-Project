BREAK DOWN MY WITHERED WALLS
FALLING SHORT OF THE ABLITY
TO PREVENT A KINGS FINAL FALL
UNRELENTING TRAGEDY

IM SURE ITS EASY TO SEE
THAT THIS BUSINESS WANTS ME DEAD
CONTRACTS ARE VOID &amp; NOTHINGS FREE
RESTLESS UNTIL THEY HAVE YOUR HEAD

WELL IM STILL FAR AWAY
FROM YOUR LIGHT OF GRACE
SO PLEASE DONT WAKE ME

MY NEED TO STAB YOU IN THE BACK
WITH THE KNIFE YOU LEFT IN MINE
KNOWING NOTHING EVER FUCKING MATTERED
AND I WAS JUST A WASTE OF TIME

IF ANYTHING COULD WAKE ME FROM SUCH A VIVID DREAM
CRY OUT MELANCOLY
WOULD YOU WAKE ME?

WHILE IM STILL FAR AWAY
FROM YOUR LIGHT OF GRACE
SO PLEASE DONT WAKE ME
WHILE IM STILL FAR AWAY
FROM YOUR LIGHT OF GRACE
SO PLEASE DONT WAKE ME

THE FINAL LESSON IN AUDACIOUS HURT
COMES ONLY ONCE YOU LEARNED THE WORST
THE FINAL LESSON IN AUDACIOUS HURT
COMES ONLY AFTER YOUâVE ACCEPTED THE WORST

WE BELONG DEAD
WE BELONG DEAD
WE BELONG DEAD
WE BELONG DEAD

THIS IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN IT GOES TOO FAR
YOUR BLEEDING SKIN AND YOUR BROKEN HEART
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN HE GOES TOO FAR
FROM LOVE TO PAIN
FROM SMIRKS TO SCARS

I HOPE YOUâLL PROVE ME WRONG
I HOPE YOU NEVER BECOME
EVERYTHING YOU WERE ONCE AGAINST
