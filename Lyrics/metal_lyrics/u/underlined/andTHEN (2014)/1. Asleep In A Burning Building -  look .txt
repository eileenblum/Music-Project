I KNOW WHAT YOUR FUTURE HOLDS
IS A FAILURE, A MYSTERY AND LIE
FEEDING THE HORRORS INFESTING YOUR MIND

I FOUGHT YOUR WAR AND I LOST MYSELF
WASTED AND TORN APART, DID THESE LACERATIONS HELP?
TELL ME AGAIN, WHAT WAS HER NAME?
OH MY, SHES LOST HERSELF AND NEEDS SOMEONE TO BLAME

MY GOD, TELL ME, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?

WE ARE THE SICK THAT YOU CAN NOT FIX
HATRED ONLY DISSIPATES WHEN MY HANDS ARE AROUND YOUR NECK
IM WAGING WAR AND YOUR LEAVING SCARS
YOUR TASTE STILL STAINS MY LIPS AND ITS POISONING MY HEART

I CANT BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME

BEHOLD! THE GODESS, SHE BLEEDS!
LET HER HAVE HER WAY WITH YOUR SELF ESTEAM
BEHOLD! THE WOMAN FROM MY DREAMS!
IM BEGGING YOU
DONT WAKE ME

I CANT LEAVE YOU BEHIND.
WHEN YOU SUCK OFF MY SOUL, ITS JUST FEEDING YOUR EGO

I KNOW WHAT YOUR FUTURE HOLDS
IS A FAILURE, A MYSTERY AND LIE
FED TO THE CREATURES INFESTING YOUR MIND

I FOUGHT YOUR WAR AND I LOST MYSELF
WASTED AND TORN APART,
NOW WERE LEFT INSIDE THIS HELL

ITS SUCH A DREAM FALLING FOR A CORPSE, YOU SEE?

BEHOLD! THE GODESS, SHE BLEEDS!
LET HER HAVE HER WAY WITH YOUR SELF ESTEAM
BEHOLD! THE WOMAN FROM MY DREAMS!
IM BEGGING YOU
DONT WAKE ME

JUST LET ME BURN
IM ASLEEP IN A BURNING BUILDING
LEST YOU WAKE THE DEAD
