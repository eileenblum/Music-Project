HIDING INSIDE DELUSIONS, ONCE AGAIN I DIG DEEPER
CRAWLING INSIDE
TO LEAVE WHATS LEFT OF YOU TO FUCKING ROT
TRAPPED INSIDE OF THE LIES SURROUNDING YOUR LIFE
THE POISON FILLING YOUR MIND
TO LEAVE YOU PARA-FUCKIN-NOID

BROKEN AND PARANOID TO BOOT
THERES NOTHING I CAN FUCKING DO
THERES NOTHING I CAN FUCKING SAY
TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT

WHEN YOUR FANTASY CRASHES DOWN
ILL BE BETWEEN YOU AND THE GROUND
BECAUSE THE ONES THAT CARE
ARE THE ONES THAT STICK AROUND

I AM NOT YOUR WHORE
(I AM NOT YOUR FUCKING WHORE)

UPON THE CORRUPTION OF YOUR INNOCENCE
WE WILL RISE

HOW COULD YOU TAKE THIS ALL AWAY?
HOW COULD YOU TAKE IT ALL FROM ME?
