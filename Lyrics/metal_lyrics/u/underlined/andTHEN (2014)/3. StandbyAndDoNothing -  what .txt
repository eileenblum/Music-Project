I AM DOOM

I AM WASTED POTENTIAL
WE ARE WASTED YOUTH
I AM CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO STAND UP FOR YOU

LETS PICK EACH OTHERS SCABS
LETS PRY APART OUR SOULS
LETS DIG UNTIL WE REACH BONE
NOW WE'LL NEVER EVER EVER HAVE TO BE ALONE

WHEN ALL AND ALL, ALL AND IN THE END
GOOD GIRLS FALL PREY TO BAD MEN
ALL AND ALL, ALL AND IN THE END

(INHALE) THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME
(EXHALE) FROM MYSELF
(INHALE) THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE
(EXHALE) LIKE NO ONE ELSE
EVEN THOUGH YOU LEFT TOO

IT DOESN'T MATTER, THERES NO GETTING THROUGH TO YOU
I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT MY HEARTS BEEN SOLD
I SEE YOU IN COLORS THAT DONT EXIST
IM JUST SILVER MEDAL WITH A BROKEN HEART OF GOLD

JUNKIES, LIARS, PUNKS &amp; THIEVES
THE SUNSHINE STATE OF FAILED BEAUTY QUEENS
JUNKIES, LIARS, PUNKS &amp; THIEVES
THE SUNSHINE STATE OF FAILED BEAUTY QUEENS

I AM WASTED POTENTIAL
CONSUMED, WASTED YOUTH
I AM CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO STAND UP FOR YOU
THIS IS TESTING MY PATIENCE
I KNEW ID OVERLOAD
I MUST HAVE MIXED THE RED WITH BLUE,
WHATS ONE MORE OVERDOSE?

WHATS A DRUG IF YOU CANT ABUSE IT?
WHAT THE MATTER ARE YOU SCARED YOU MIGHT LOSE IT?
OH WHATS A DRUG IF YOU CANT ABUSE IT?
WHAT THE MATTER ARE YOU SCARED YOU MIGHT LOSE IT?
WHATS A DRUG IF YOU CANT ABUSE IT?
WHAT THE MATTER ARE YOU SCARED YOU MIGHT LOSE IT?
OH WHATS A DRUG IF YOU CANT ABUSE IT?
WHAT THE MATTER ARE YOU SCARED YOU MIGHT LOSE IT?

HER BLOOD STREAM SWIRLS THROUGH MY WATER
WHILE THE LIGHT STARTS TO LEAVE HER EYES
I WONT DREAM OF ANY OTHER
THAN THE ONE I LOSE EVERY NIGHT
