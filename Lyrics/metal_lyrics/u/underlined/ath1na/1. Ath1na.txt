All that i know is how weâve changed
While everything else here stayed the same
After all these years, and all weâve exchanged
Swept up in introverted waves
Parallel thinking and throwing shapes
Third eye opened wide to the worlds pernicious games

There are too many things that iâve left unsaid
Confessions heard only in my head

Unearthed amalgams of dark matter
need all the miracles a man can gather
Her brain like sponge, my heart like a leach

All that i know is how weâve changed
While everything else here stayed the same
After all these years, and all weâve exchanged

You think through fools and you throw your shapes
Much too easily are you left to blame
Where are you, light of life?
Now youâve gone out of sight

Athina, know now, its seldom darkest before the dawn
Mirrored soul, know now, youâve moved the barely breathing to song

There are too many things that iâve left unsaid
Confessions heard only in my head

I donât know, whats our next move now?
I canât break new ground that Iâm buried beneath
Whats my next move now?
I canât break new ground that Iâm buried beneath

Athina, know now, its seldom darkest before the dawn
Mirrored soul, know now, youâve moved the barely breathing to song
