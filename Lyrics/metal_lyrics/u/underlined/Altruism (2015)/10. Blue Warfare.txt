When its too late, everyone cares
When its too late, everyone runs scared
When its too late, my eyes stay glued to the clock
When its too late, and my heart has stopped

I pledged allegiance to the heartless
Iâve sewn latex into skin
Opened veins so you could paint this
To be forgotten relapse

When its too late, Eurydice - esque
When its too late, release the denouement
When its too late, rhythmical equity
When its too late, sheâs lying much too still beside me

You slipped again into a haze of blue and black
Lost memories, unable to keep track
If the ones you love will always hurt you the most
Lets trade our pain for a shot at the thrown

Theyâre all insisting
Weâve been living in a fantasy,
Theyâre all insisting

So lend your ears, I'm moribund
When its too late, everyone cares
When its too late, everyone runs scared
So lend your ears, I'm moribund
When its too late, everyone cares
When its too late, everyone runs scared

Misreading the shore lines in your eyes

Bridges get burnt
Lessons unlearned preach willful psychosis with ravenous guilt
Wide awake and half stoned
Like everything that fell, I broke
Romantic parlor tricks can't keep this afloat.

Theyâre all insisting
Weâve been living in a fantasy,
Theyâre all insisting
And theyâre right
