Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have

If I made you feel second best
I'm so sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Please tell me, Tell me
That your sweet love hasn't diedâ¦
And give me, Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
Would you let me take the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
