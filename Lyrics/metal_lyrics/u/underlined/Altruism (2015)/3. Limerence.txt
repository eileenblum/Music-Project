Here I lay, chasing yesterday
And pushing daisies out of foggy memories
And welcomes that maybe Iâve overstayed
Though I followed through with the ties that bound you

Take your fruitions out on me
Give me the worst you can

If affections is all you need from
Iâd say youâve had your fill
You're a feast for the darkest eyes; the devils eyes
What ever happens, entombed, entwined in our minds

But I show you a light so bright that it blinds youâ¦
That it blinds us allâ¦

Head! Head! Off with their heads!
Heâs in love, she believes that sheâs better off dead
Head! Head! Shoot him in head!
Heâs in love, shes in love, but theyâre better off dead

Take your fruitions out on me
Give me the worst you can

Take your fruitions out on me
Give me the worst you can

Head! Head! Off with their heads!
Heâs in love, she believes that sheâs better off dead
Head! Head! Shoot him in the head!
Heâs in love, shes in love, but theyâre better off dead

Head! Head! Off with their heads!
Sheâs in love, he believes that heâs better off dead
Head! Head! Shoot her in the head!
Shes in love and believes that theyâre better off dead

Drive by hazed throughout these days
Iâve lost my way, could you take me home?
Draw the bath
Hold me down
Let me drown
Take me out
Set a flame
Tie me down
Leave a mark
Let it burn
Burn your house down
