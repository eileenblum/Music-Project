I donât feel right. Something doesnât feel right. No.
Nothing here feels right. Something doesnât feel right. No.
I donât feel right. Something doesnât make sense to me

Youâre just standing there, staring in disbelief
That a man, like myself, could confess all these things
All rise, give into me
All lies, spewing from you
Fuck life, empower yourself
Break free from the fairy tail

I donât want it. I donât need it
I'm standing here for your applause I only wanted
Not to be forgotten by the haunted
By this tonic for my sore eyes

If this didnât feel right, something might just make sense to me
Just when I realized things arenât always quiet as they seem
I canât materialize things my heart just doesnât believe
This is a fire fight. Get in while you feel youâre willing

Nothings as it seems. Nothings as it reads.
Feelings are all weâre inclined to believe
Nothings as it seems. Nothings as it reads.
Feelings are all weâre inclined to believe

I donât want it. I donât need it
I'm standing here for your applause I only wanted
Not to be forgotten by the haunted
By this tonic for my sore eyes

If this didnât feel right, something might just make sense to me
Just when I realized things arenât always quiet as they seem
I canât materialize things my heart just doesnât believe
This is a fire fight. Get in while you feel youâre willing

If this didnât feel right, something might just make sense to me
Just when I realized things arenât always quiet as they seem
I canât materialize things my heart just doesnât believe
This is a fire fight. Get in while you feel youâre willing
