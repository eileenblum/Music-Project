Take my hand
In these streets
Stay close. Breathe.
Drunkenly picking daisies
Sheâs the red queen
Turning full circle
Dreaming of your being
If there's one thing Iâll always recognize
Its the terrorized lustful look in her eyes.
You have my undivided attention.

Play off your master, you tease,
Until the day youâve drop to your knees,
Sucked out the hate in me, been tied up and displayed for me
Play off your master, you tease,
Until the day I drop you to your knees,
Suck out the hate in me, in this haze youâve won my heart from me.

If there's one thing Iâll always recognize
Its the lustful terrorized look in her eyes.

Take my hand
In these streets
Stay close
Breathe

Drunkenly picking daisies
Sheâs my red queen
Turning full circle
Dreaming of your being
You have my undivided attention

Take my hand
In these streets
Stay close
Breathe

Show me your cards
I'm no easy defeat
Taking my hand in these streets
While drunkenly picking daisies
Drunkenly picking daisies
