You would tell me all, all about your plans
Iâd bring them all to life for you, madame
But if men were gods, id be there tomorrow
To stitch your heart and heal your sorrow
Replace my soul your pain, carry your cross, and erase my name

I know Iâm betting a losing battle
But a soul like yours is worth the gamble
Youâve said youâre a losing battle
Iâd say that youâre worth the gamble

I know this is what youâve come to expect from me
Playing part in altruistic romantic telepathy

Youâre the only reason why I canât think straight
Youâre the only reason why I canât breathe
Youâre the very reason why I canât give up on my-
Youâre the very reason why I canât give up on myself

Youâre like a splinter; youâre like a cut
I wouldnât let it heal if I needed to
I wouldnât let it heal if I needed to

Hell is where the heart is, yeah you better believe it
Hell is where the heart is, yeah you better believe it

Tell me what do I exactly mean to this half-assed temptress?
Why donât ya get up off your knees and Iâll tell the world about it
Dear, youâve cut my puppet strings, permitting my heart to scream

Youâre the only reason why I canât think straight
Youâre the only reason why I canât breathe
Youâre the very reason why I canât give up on my-
Youâre the very reason why I canât give up on myself

Youâre like a splinter; youâre like a cut
I wouldnât let it heal if I needed to
I wouldnât let it heal if I needed to
Youâre like the seasons, the winters rush
I couldnât warm you up, if you let me
So Iâll just freeze youâ¦
Hell is where the heart is, yeah you better believe it
Hell is where the heart is, yeah you better believe it

Tied up in symbolism, what can you see through?
A double headed noose, one for me. One for you
Tied up in symbolism, can you even see through?
A double headed noose, two for me and none you
Tied up in symbolism, can you see through?
A double headed noose, one for me and you
A double headed noose, two for me and none you

Youâre the only reason why I canât think straight
Youâre the only reason why I canât breathe
Youâre the very reason why I canât give up on myâ¦
Youâre the very reason why I canât give up on myself

Youâre like a splinter; just like a cut
I wouldnât let it heal if I needed to
I wouldnât let it heal if I needed to
Just like the seasons, a winters rush
I couldnât warm you up, if you let me
So Iâll just freeze youâ¦

Hell is where the heart is, yeah you better believe it
Hell is where the heart is, yeah you better believe it
