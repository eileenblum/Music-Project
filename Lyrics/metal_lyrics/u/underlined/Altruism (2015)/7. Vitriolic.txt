Of all the horrors that darkness holds
To die alone is the worst I know

I've compromised convictions to maintain my compassion
And wasted time on a pipe dream
Exaggerated assumptions are simple aversions
Tell me what I should believe.

Drown me in your mainstream
Wipe the social slate clean (wake up)
Drown me in your mainstream
Don't pray for me

I still hear you clear as day
Saying everything will be okay
And yet I remain here horrified
At the thought of your genocide
Beating you down until you obey

So if it's all behind me, why does your face remind me
I am the faceless shell of my former self

Youâll disconnect, Iâm willing to bet
Youâll disconnect, Iâm willing to bet

That I found what I loved and let it kill me
I could never be a shill for your humanity
Yet, I've come to find, that you would surely deny my untimely demise

Who the fuck do you think you are?
Ruining me than expecting apologies?
I never waited to pursue the things I knew you hated
But when you were tested, you just couldnât erase me

Drown me in your mainstream
Wipe the social slate clean (wake up)
Drown me in your mainstream
Don't pray for me

Lock the doors, hit the lights
Tonight it's just you and I
Close the curtains, hit the lights
Tonight it's just you and I

Drown me in your mainstream
Wipe the social slate clean (wake up)
Drown me in your mainstream
Don't pray for me

But I found what I loved and let it kill me
I could never be a shill for your humanity
Yet, I've come to find, that you would surely deny my untimely demise

I'm sick of paying someone else's dues
Slandered, abandoned, straight up used
