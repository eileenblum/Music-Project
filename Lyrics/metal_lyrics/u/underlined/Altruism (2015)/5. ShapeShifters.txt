Iâve never dared to call you mine, Not one single time
You are yours (I am mine)
Iâve never once called you mine, Not one single time
You are yours (I am mine)
I am mine
No Iâve never once called you mine

And that's why when yours and mine unite
Which side are you on? Ours worlds collide
And that's why my heart stops
At the sight of the look in your eye
At the sight of the look in your eye
At the sight of the look in your eye

Lock the door, dim the lights, tonight its you and I
Lock the door, dim the lights, tonight its you and I

Youâre the only reason why I, the only reason why I,
The only reason why I, why canât think straight
Youâre the only reason why I, the only reason why I,
The only reason why I, why I canât breathe
Youâre the only reason why I, the only reason why I,
The only reason why I canât give up on myâ¦
Youâre the only reason why I, the only reason why I,
The only reason why I canât give up on myself

Must I bash this into your head?
Weâve seen the worst of the worst, Yet here we stand
Whats not to get?

Youâre the only reason why I, the only reason why I,
The only reason why I canât give up on myself

Must I bash this into your head?
Weâve seen the worst of the worst, Yet here we stand
I must tighten the grip around your neck
Until the light in your eyes fades grey to black

Tell me your stories of life gone wrong
This is where the tension takes us
This is where our intentions break us

Tell me your stories of life gone wrong
Show me all about what makes you
Tick, scream, beg and obey

Iâve never dared to call you mine, Not one single time
You are yours, I am mine

No Iâve never once dared to call you mine
And that's why my heart stops at the sight
Of the look in your eye
Lock the door, dim the lights, tonight its you and I
Lock the door, dim the lights, tonight its you and I
