Alone she stood, alone I fell, alone I have this story to tell
Repeating vows over again and again, inside my head,
Where the brave go to bend

But have I wasted all this time
Paying someone elseâs dues?

Alone I loathed, alone I know,
That everyone in this world is in it for themselves

But have I wasted all this time
Paying someone elseâs dues?
Is this special effects orâ¦

Am I getting through
An altruistic point of view

Have I wasted all this time paying someone elseâs dues?
Is this special effects, am I even getting through to you?
Am I getting through?

Open your eyes, queen bee, and feed off the emotional debris
To maintain your once was sanity
Or whatever it takes for your face to be
Upon the grand marquee
Where everyone can see your transparent vanity
Plaguing all once was dear to me

I stand on gimmick street, preaching sincerity
To anyone out there listening

Have I wasted all this time paying someone elseâs dues?

Am I getting through an altruistic point of view?

If what youâve seen is all that you get
Then id be willing to bet that youâve had your fill
If what youâve seen is all that you get
Then Iâd be willing to be bet
That sheâd be glad to forget me
