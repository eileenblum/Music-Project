THE TALE OF MANKIND, ONE OF CONSTANT STRUGGLE
AGAINST THIS HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT 
UNYIELDING HARVESTS, BITTING DISEASE
VICIOUS WARFARE PLAGUING THESE HUMAN BEINGS

SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME, TO THE 21ST CENTURY

A SIRENS CALL TO SUBMERGE
WITH AN AGREEABLE GROUPTHINK 
4 YEARS WASTED, ALL LIES
AN UNDENIABLE PURPOSE
TO MATE, TO FEED &amp; TO HATE TO BREATHE
INFESTS AND RUINS EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING

I STRIVED TO SAVE THE WEAK WILLED
TO MAKE THE WHOLE WORLD HEAR THE TRUTH
I SWEAR IâD GET MY REVENGE
FOR WHAT THEY DID TO YOU

I FEEL SO FAR FROM YOU, ITâS NEVER ENOUGH
I TRIED TO FACE MYSELF
THE DYING DAYS THAT I REMEMBER, HAVE WITHERED AWAY
ARE WITHERED AWAY

I COULD NEVER GET THE THOUGHT OF YOU OUT OF MY 
BLOOD SOAKED MEMORIES

I WONT LET YOU BE FORGOTTEN

A SIRENS CALL TO SUBMERGE
WITH AN AGREEABLE GROUPTHINK 
4 YEARS WASTED, ALL LIES
AN UNDENIABLE PURPOSE
TO MATE, TO FEED &amp; TO HATE TO BREATHE
INFESTS AND RUINS EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING

I WONT LET YOU BE FORGOTTEN

I FEEL SO FAR FROM YOU, ITS NEVER ENOUGH
I TRIED TO FACE MYSELF
DYING DAYS THAT I REMEMBER, HAVE WITHERED AWAY
ARE WITHERED AWAY
I SWEAR ITS NOT WHAT I WANTED TO DO
I SWEAR ON MY LIFE, THIS IS ALL THAT I HAVE FOR YOU.
