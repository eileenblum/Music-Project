I AM ALL PAIN, OVERCOME BY LACK OF FAITH
WELCOMED BY NONE, YET FEARED BY ALL

I AM THE OVER COME, FORCED FEAR OF A NESSACARY EVIL
I AM THE OVER DONE, THE EMBODIEMENT OF PAIN

YOU NAMES ENGRAVED, ON THE ARMS OF A MAN IN CHAINS
BOUND BY HATE, SET FREE IN VAIN
I WILL PREACH THE WORDS OF A ONCE FORSAKEN LAND
I WILL DENOUNCE AND SET A FLAME TO A WORLD ENSLAVED

I CALLED ON THE RIDERS OF THE HELL
TO RISE BEYOND YOUR GRAVE
I CALL ON THE HEARTS OF THE DAMNED
TO DESTROY THIS WORLD IN VAIN

I AM THE PREACHER OF PURE HATE
I AM THE EMBODIMENT OF A DISMAL PAIN
I AM THE PREACHER OF PURE HATE
I AM THE EMBODIMENT OF PURE DISMAL PAIN
PURE PAIN
