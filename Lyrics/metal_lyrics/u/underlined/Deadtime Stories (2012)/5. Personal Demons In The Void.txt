YOUâRE JUST PATHETIC, RESPECT NON-EXISTENT
A PERFUSION OF THE FAITHLESS, YOU BATHE IN YOUR IGNORANCE

I AM REBORN (WE ARE THE FUTURE OF YOUR GENOCIDE)
I AM REBORN (WE ARE A PLAUGE CONSUMMATING IN YOUR BED OF LIES)

I AM THE FATHER, THE ANCENT CREATOR
AN OBSESSION OF THE DECEIVED, AN EVIL WITH NO DESTINY

DONâT LEAVE ME DONâT RECEIVE ME 
DONâT SEE ME DYING WITHOUT YOU 
DONâT LEAVE ME NEVER DID YOU NEED ME
DONâT SEE ME DYING

I'LL SAY, NOTHING (ITS WHAT I CAME FOR)
WHAT YOU TOOK AWAY
I'LL LEAVE NOTHING (ITS WHAT I PAID FOR)
WHAT YOU TOOK AWAY

I AM REBORN (WE ARE THE CHILDREN OF YOUR GENOCIDE)
I AM REBORN (WE ARE A PLAUGE CONSUMMATING IN YOUR BED OF LIES)


I WANT TO SAY, TILL YOU GO AWAY
I HATE YOU, AND WHAT YOU HAVE BECOME
I WANT TO SAY, WILL YOU GO AWAY
I HATE YOU, AND WHAT YOU HAVE BECOME

DONâT LEAVE ME
DONâT RECEIVE ME
I DONâT SEE ME DYING WITHOUT YOU
DONâT LEAVE ME
NEVER DID YOU NEED ME
I DONâT SEE ME DYING WITHOUT YOU
DYING  WITHOUT YOU


I WILL BE WHATEVER YOU WANT FROM ME (WHILE I WASTE AWAY)
