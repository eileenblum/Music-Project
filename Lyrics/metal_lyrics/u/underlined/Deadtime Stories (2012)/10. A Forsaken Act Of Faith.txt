ITS LIKE FUCKING WITH YOUR EYES SHUT (OH)

IN THE DARK I CANT REMEMBER YOUR FACE
BUT I FEEL THE SNAKES BEHIND THOSE EYES
YOU'D PROBABLY PICK UP ALL YOUR SHIT AND SPLIT
IF YOU HAD ANY IDEA WHATS IN MY MIND

I NEED A FAVOR HON, I NEED A MERCY DONE
I GUESS IM COUNTING ON YOUR LIGHT
I KNOW I AINT WHAT YOU THOUGHT
BUT HELP AND PITY, WE COULD MAKE IT ALL ALRIGHT

REACH UP WITH ALL OF YOUR LIGHT
MAKE AN ACT OF FAITH AND TEAR OUT MY EYES
REACH UP WITH ALL OF YOU FAITH
TAKE YOUR MOUTH OFF MY DICK 
TEAR OUT MY FUCKING EYES 

DO YOU TRUST ANYBODY?  DO YOU DARE BE SURE?
DO YOU TRUST ANYBODY? IN A WORLD WHERE NOONE IS PURE
DO YOU TRUST ANYBODY?  DO YOU DARE BE SURE?
DO YOU TRUST ANYONE, ANYTHING?
OR ARE YOU FUCKING WITH YOUR EYES SHUT?

IS ANYBODY LISTENING? (NO)
DOES ANYBODY CARE? (FUCKING NO)
IS ANYBODY LISTENING TO THE SOUNDS
OF INNOCENT SUFFERING, SUFFERING SILENTLY?
