BREAK THROUGH THESE WITHERED WALLS
FALLING SHORT OF AN ABLITY 
TO PREVENT THE KINGS FINAL FALL
A REDEFINING MEANS OF TRAGEDY
IM SURE ITS SO EASY FOR YOU TO SEE
WHY THESE PEOPLE WANT YOU DEAD
YOUR SLAVES NOW BROKEN AND FREE
WONT REST TILL WE HAVE YOUR HEAD

WE'VE COME SO FAR AWAY, FROM THE LIGHT OF GRACE
TO THE RIGHT OF WAY
I'VE SUNK TOO FAR TOO SOON
IM OVERCOME BY WHAT MUST BE DONE

ILL BE SURE TO STAB YOU IN THE BACK
WITH THE KNIFE YOU LEFT IN MINE
KNOWING NOTHING EVER FUCKING MATTERED
IT WAS ALL A WASTE OF TIME
WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, SINCE IT SHIT THE BED
I KNOW YOU'RE QUESTIONING YOUR MOTIVES 
AND THE THINGS YOU SAID
WELL TELL MY ONLY FUCKING CHILD JUST WHAT YOU DID
WHEN HE WONDERS WHY HIS "ABSENTEE DAD" IS DEAD

TO INVEST IN YOUR OWN REDEMTION MEANS A SACRIFICE TO A FERAL GOD
TO INVEST IN A CONSUMATION BRINGS A GREATER GOOD TO THE LESSER MENTIONED
FUCK YOU

A SACRIFICE OF OUR OWN REDEMPTION 
BARES A SACRIFICE TO A GREATER GOD
THE FACE OF OWN SALVATION
BRINGS A LACK OF GOOD, TO THE LESSER MENTIONED
FUCK YOU

I WILL INVOKE THIS INNER HATE
TO LAY WASTE TO A BOUND SLAVE
LEGIONS IN RUINS, CRY OUT IN PAIN
FROM A WARPATH FUELD BY MY PAIN
WOMEN AND CHILD LAY SLAIN TO WASTE
STRUNG HIGH AND BLOOD DRAINED
AND SET A FLAME TO A WORLD INSLAVED

THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY'VE DONE
THEY'RE BOUND TO THE TRIVAL
THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY'VE DONE
NONE WILL BE SPARED, EVERYONE IS DONE

THEY FALL FROM THE HELL THAT THEY'VE BECOME

LAY SLANE ON A BED OF NAILS, YOUR TIME HAS COME AND PAST
BOW DOWN, ACCEPT YOUR FATE. OUR TIME IS NOW

ALL IS GONE, HOW COULD YOU

HOW COULD YOU BECOME
WHAT YOU SWORE YOU WOULD RISE AGAINST
