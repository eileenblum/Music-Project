NOW CAN YOU SEE, IM SUFFERING
THIS HATE STILL MOTIVATES ME, AMONG OTHER THINGS
NOW I CAN BE, WHAT YOU'LL NEVER BE
THIS PAIN STILL LOCK AND CHAINS ME
ITS HOVERING

RIPPING THROUGH ME
TEARING THROUGH ME
THE MORE IT CONSUMES ME
THE MORE THAT YOU'LL LOSE ME

PULLING INTO ME
UNTIL IT MOVES ME
THE MORE IT CONSUMES ME
THE LESS I CAN CHOOSE TO BE

IM SUFFERING, THE HATE STILL MOTIVATES ME
IM SUFFERING, NOW I CAN BE
WHAT YOU'LL NEVER BE
THIS PAIN STILL LOCK AND CHAINS ME
ITS HOVERING, ITS HOVERING
