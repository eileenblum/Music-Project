WE'RE LOST IN TIME, ALONE AGAIN
TRAPPED IN MY MIND
SERVING MY FUCKING SIN
THESE SCREAMS OF MADNESS 
ECHO THROUGH THESE HALLS
SUCH A COLD WORLD BUILD BEHIND THESE
CONCRETE WALLS

AS THE FIRE BUILDS
YOURS IS OVERWHELMING ME
AS THE SMOKE FLOWS THROUGH YOUR LUNGS
I'LL FIND MY GOD IN YOUR SUFFERING
THESE SCREAMS OF A SO CALLED NIGHTMARE
OPENING OF A MAN-MADE CELLAR DOOR
THESE SCREAMS NOW A SO CALLED NIGHTMARE
YOUR FEAR TO ENTER MY WORLD

I MUST FACE THE SUN, TO LIGHT THIS FUCKING PATH
TO DEFEAT THIS HORRID BEAST, MY JOURNEY HAS JUST BEGUN
I WILL FEED ON THE FEAR OF THE MAD-MADE ANTI-CHRIST
I WILL FEED ON THE FEAR, INDULGING SACRIFICE.

I WONT EVER, I WONT EVER LET THIS END
