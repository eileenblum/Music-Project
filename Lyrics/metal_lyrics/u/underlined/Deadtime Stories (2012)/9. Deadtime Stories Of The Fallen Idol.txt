FORMING TALES OF DEATH
THAT WILL CALL THE
VILE FILTH FILLED WHORES
THAT SURROUND ME

I WILL CALL ON THESE FAITHLESS INFESTERS
OF HEARTLESS EMOTION, FROM THE BLACK BRUISED &amp; WILLING

BARE YOUR WORTHLESS MINDS
THAT BLEED FOR MANKIND
I WILL CALL THE NAMES 
OF THE ONE WE BLAME

TO LEAVE THE NORM, FOR THE WARMTH OF ANOTHER
YOUâRE BOUND &amp; TIED TO THE LIES OF OUR FATHER
A USELESS GOD WATCHES YOU SUFFER IN PAIN
WHEN ONLY ONE QUESTION BRINGS DOWN EVERYTHING

I'D SELL MY SOUL TO SEE THE SHELL OF WHO YOU USED TO BE
I'D SELL MY SOUL TO KNOW THAT YOU HATE ME

I WILL CALL ON THESE FAITHLESS INFESTERS
OF HEARTLESS EMOTION
FROM THE BLACK BRUISED &amp; WILLING
TO LEAVE THE NORM
FOR THE WARMTH OF ANOTHER
YOUâRE BOUND AND TIED 
TO THE LIES OF OUR FATHER

I DRAGGED YOUR SOUL TO THE UNFORGIVING ASUNDER
FORGIVING THE LOST, AMONG THE MIST OF DESIRE
INCASED OUR MINDS TO ERASE YOUR FAILURE
INCASE OUR SOUL TO MOVE ON TO ANOTHER
