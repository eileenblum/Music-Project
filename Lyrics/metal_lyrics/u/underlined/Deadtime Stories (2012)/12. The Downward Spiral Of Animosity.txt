HIDING INSIDE DELUSIONS, ONCE AGAIN I DIG DEEPER
CRAWLING INSIDE
TO LEAVE WHATS LEFT OF YOU TO FUCKING ROT 
TRAPPED INSIDE OF THE LIES SURROUNDING YOUR LIFE
THE POISON FILLING YOUR MIND
TO LEAVE YOU PARA-FUCKIN-NOID
FOCUSING ON THE LIES SURROUNDING YOUR LIFE
THE POISON FILLING YOUR MIND
TO LEAVE YOU PARA-FUCKIN-NOID

I AM NOT YOUR WHORE (I AM NOT YOUR FUCKING WHORE)

UPON THE CORRUPTION OF YOUR INNOCENCE, WE WILL RISE

HOW COULD YOU TAKE THIS ALL AWAY?
HOW COULD YOU TAKE IT ALL FROM ME?
