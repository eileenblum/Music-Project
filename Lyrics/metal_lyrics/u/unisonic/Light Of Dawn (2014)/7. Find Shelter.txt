Dealing with danger, for freedom we strive
The guild of the faceless won't take us alive
Up to the heavens, a prayer to be blessed
Searching for purpose and meeting obsessed

A quested mind and soul will answer
The question of the heart
An overzealous crowd will trust
What's tearing them apart

Find shelter
We're lost in the haze of the sovereign ways
Find shelter
Hide us away from the storm

Out in the open with fear of the dark
The journey is futile but still we embark
Exit the madness, leave distress behind
Enter perception, a new state of mind

Beliefs become the thoughts of many
The thoughts turn into words
The words turn into actions and
The actions are absurd, so absurd

Find shelter
We're lost in the haze of the sovereign ways
Find shelter
Into the light we transform

Find shelter
We're out in the could for the beast to behold
Find shelter
Hide us away from the storm

You stand alone before an open door
It's up to you to step inside
To have a choice means only choosing it
And it's only up to you decide find shelter

Find shelter
We're lost in the haze of the sovereign ways
Find shelter
Into the light we transform

Find shelter
We're out in the could for the beast to behold
Find shelter
Hide us away from the storm

From the storm, yeah!
