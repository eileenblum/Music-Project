The hangman's waiting for then
With the rope in his hands
The silence makes him cast doubt
On their innocence

(Then he says)
This cross I have to carry
This cross I have to bear
So keep your mind at ease
This blood that's on my hands
I simply wash away

I'm not a judge or a peer
Just a man with and iron heart
And I can't set them free to live again

It's their time, I won't stall
And you should never blame me, I'm not at fault
I don't strive for pleasure, cause there will be none
And no appreciation - when the deed is done

The eyes all focus on me
As I walk to the side
To pull the lever that could be released by anymore

It's a battle of will
Between conscious and righteousness
And it's more than one soul that's on the line

It's their time, I won't stall
And you should never blame me, I'm not at fault
I don't strive for pleasure, cause there will be none
And no appreciation - when the deed is done

The hangman just stands in the distance
To be shunned in dismay
From any cynical feelings, I just shy away
I won't find my glory, drying in the sun
There's no appreciation - when the deed is done
