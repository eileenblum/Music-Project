I fell from the stars
Down from the top of the hill
Put me back into place but now
I take the controls
Choosing to face the aggressor
I'm not gonna take anymore

While looking down into the great divide
So many questions come to mind
I've traveled long and hard to find my way
It's a fight for acceptance
And the word is my sword

The walls of Jericho came tumbling down
Goliath stood meet his fate
There is a way for justice to be served
It begins with believing, believe in yourself

One voice can be heard above the crowd
One voice, it can resonate oh so loud
I raise my head then I shout out so justly proud

I fell from the stars
Down from the top of the hill
Put me back into place but now
I take the controls
Choosing to face the aggressor
I'm not gonna take anymore

I break the silence
I am defiance - without violence

I fell from the stars
Down from the top of the hill
Put me back into place and now
I follow the signs
Pursue the way of the masters
That give me the strength so that

I can take the controls
Choosing to face the aggressor
I'm not gonna take anymore
Anymore!
