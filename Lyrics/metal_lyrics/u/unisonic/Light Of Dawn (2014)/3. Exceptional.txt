I walk in shadows of the past
Ten thousand voices are calling me
And I ask myself: "Is this real or just a dream?"

Spotlights are shining in my eyes
I can feel the synergy, it makes me whole
So I ask myself: "Will I turn my world around?"
Then I brace myself, like a king that's waiting to be crowned

I can be exceptional, sensational for you
And I could be acceptable, expendable to you

There's so much static in the air
Power and eloquence enchanting all
Then I ask myself: "has it only just begun?"

Into the realm of the unknown
I live the fantasy inside my head
Then I ask myself: "It this the zenith of my soul?"
Yes I ask myself: "It's this the only thing
that makes you whole?"

I can be exceptional, sensational for you
And I could be acceptable, expendable to you

I won't deny the lies and deception
I've sought, I've learned, I've grown

And I can be exceptional, sensational for you
And I could be acceptable, expendable to you
Yes I can be exceptional, invincible for you
But I might be delusional, pretending all I do
