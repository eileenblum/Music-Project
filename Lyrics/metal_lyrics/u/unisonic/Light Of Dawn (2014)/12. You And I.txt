The winds of change we can't outrun
We can't hide away from the rising of the sun
And all the fears we've ever known
Are just fertilizing the seeds that have been sown

No need to dwell, or wish them well
It's all right
What's left to do, what's left for you?

There is sadness, there is madness
So we must come together, you and I
From the mountains, to the oceans
It's just you and I - and I believe it's time

What goes up, it must come down
It's an endless cycle, we all go round and round
And now the time to change has come
But to start again we must admit what we've become

There's more to say so don't shy away
Just listen
This path we choose won't make us heroes

There is sadness, there is madness
So we must come together, you and I
From the mountains, to the oceans
It's just you and I

I'm not a martyr for the sake of the fight
There's a force that's even greater than we pursue
So much too lose but even more we can gain
And it's only up to us - to come through

There is sadness, there is madness
So we must come together, you and I
From the mountains, to the oceans
It's just you and I

So we must come together, you and I
So take your passion, and make it happen
It's just you and I
