Are they lost to the world
Or just forgotten by it?
Can they take back control
Or did they ever have it?

The light is guiding them towards
And unfold fate
Don't relax, make some tracks
And show you really want it

Throne of the dawn
And a star shall rule the morning
Such an endless feud for the coming of the son
Throne of the dawn
And the fight will heed no warning
There's a crown for two
But the sear is just for one

Is it right, is it wrong
Why do they even aggress?
Will the battle illume
Or thrown us into darkness?

Into the final round, mankind will place their bets
Be aware and take care, this is a final menace

Throne of the dawn
And a star shall rule the morning
Such an endless feud for the coming of the son
Throne of the dawn
And the fight will heed no warning
There's a crown for two
But the sear is just for one

Who'll be victorious and climb into the

Throne of the dawn
And a star shall rule the morning
Such an endless feud for the coming of the son
Throne of the dawn
And the fight will heed no warning
There's a crown for two
But the sear is just for one
Destiny, questioned, destiny questioned
