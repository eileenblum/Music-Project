The blood won't hold the love
Love's now sent from above
I see trouble coming up
The demons of the past shouldn't last
Shouldn't last

I feel the cold, when the old law is told
Let it go, let it go!

And your heart is singing
The heart is bringing all we need to know
Here's brother killing his brother
Killing the brotherhood to grow
There is no one forgotten by God
And no soul without light
Yes my heart is willing
The heart is willing
My heart follows the son

You broke my heart at first
Cause I couldn't still your anger-thirst
It's so hard to let you go
Those bonds of the past
I cannot know anymore

I fell the cold, when the old law is told
Let it go, let it go

And your heart is singing
The heart is bringing all we need to know
Here's brother killing his brother
Killing the brotherhood to grow
There is no one forgotten by love
And no soul without light
Yes my heart is willing
The heart is willing
My heart follows the son

I stand on demand, you will understand
Strengthening my head, willing to defend
We will follow thee, if he'll make us see
Redemption from our sin
We finally need to win!

And your heart is singing
The heart is bringing all we need to know
Here's brother killing his brother
Killing the brotherhood to grow
There is no one forgotten by God
And no soul without light
Yes my heart is willing
The heart is willing
My heart follows the son
