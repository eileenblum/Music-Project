Feel the wind flowing across the sea
Hear the storm become a symphony
Now it's rolling out the thunder
The fury will soon have an end

All the madness of the centuries
See an latch and a prophecy
So the sky's fallen
We run to the hills

We have it all
We are the star
We can change the future
And we can rise again

The sun won't last forever
This panic so louder
The day will finally come
For judgement day

Words were spoken trying to guide our faith
Tales were told to help us steer the end
But it's a never ending story
We're making the rules as we go

And if the world should fall on to its knees
We search a cure for a divine disease
But to receive redemption
We must first understand

We have it all
We are the star
We can change the future
And we can rise again

The sun won't last forever
This panic so louder
The day will finally come
We all surrender
The sun won't last forever
It shines so stronger
The day will finally come
For judgement day

Defy your faith be free at last
Give hope a stray for the heavy blast
We fall from grace but still a vein
A vein

The sun won't last forever
This panic so louder
The day will finally come
We all surrender
The sun won't last forever
It shines so stronger
The day will finally come
For judgement day
