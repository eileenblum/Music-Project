She says I think I really love you
Got to steal prey from the other

Never said it will be easy
My guns will make you queasy
The minds set on you baby

She's a manhunter target is his heart
She's a manhunter aiming from the start
She's a manhunter he's ought to feed her soul

He says I think I've seen you lately
You try to reach me night and day

She says you'll see that I'm you woman
I know that you're my man
I will try out all I can

She's a manhunter target is his heart
She's a manhunter aiming from the start
She's a manhunter he's ought to feed her soul

I-I know I will get there
We will be together
And I won't go down
I see the day coming nearer
And I will always be eager
And I won't go down

She's a manhunter target is his heart
She's a manhunter aiming from the start
She's a manhunter he's ought to feed her soul
