Stop running away so no one can find you
So relentless and reckless
You haven't a moment to spare

So vague and obscure, this course has confined you
Won't you sooner or later
Emerge to the surface of air?

Far away from home
Take rest to clear your mind
You've been patronized and compromised
But one day you will climb...

Out of the dark, into the light
Out of the iron cage
And you know your time has come
You've made a mark, and left a sign
You've made the world your stage
And you know your time has come

The years have gone by, and little is changing
One more notch on your belt
And the seasons have lightened your skin
The passion still flows like a river of fire
But to come to an end
You must understand where to begin

Find a place to dwell
Some place to free your soul
From the days of old
You break the mold
And let the faith arise... 

Out of the dark, into the light
Out of the iron cage
Then you know your time has come
You've made a mark, and left a sign
You've made the world your stage
And you know your time has come

Far away from home
Take rest to clear your mind
Don't be patronized or agonized
There's only one way up to climb

Into the light
Out of the iron cage
Then you know your time has come
You've made a mark, and left a sign
You've made the world your stage
And you know your time has come

Out of the dark, over the land
Into the lit up night
Yes you know your time has come
You've left a mark, and stood your ground
You've fought with all your might
And you know your time has come
