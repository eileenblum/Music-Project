Gonna take this place
Drowning up the blueprint in his head
The time has come for a rule under the gun
And thy will be done by order of the one

He's got a list on his mind

There is talk on the street and it's driving him crazy
There's a lesson to learn but it's not gonna save them
Doesn't care about danger cause he's out of time
Got to call on the guardians
He's gotta keep the plan alive

A marching union, vow to the oath
Carry out a message of fear
Into a cell, they're gonna take you to hell
The prophecy will unfold

Night of the long knives
For power they do strive
An allegiance sworn to keep their master
Safe from rival harm
Night of the long knives

Soon the henchmen return from the purge of the nation
Then is given the word to being liquidation
Like a turn of the page it was said and done
And a hundred of minions were executed one by one

A marching union, vow to the oath
Carry out a message of fear
Into a cell, they're gonna take you to hell
The prophecy will unfold

Night of the long knives
For power they do strive
An allegiance sworn to keep their master
Safe from rival harm

Night of the long knives
The master must survive
Operations silencing the nemesis of the command

Take hold and clench your fist
Striked a deal that they can't resist
But in the end when the damage is done
Start counting all of your losses

Night of the long knives
For power they do strive
An allegiance sworn to keep their master
Safe from rival harm

Night of the long knives
The master must survive
Operations silencing the nemesis of the command
Night of the long knives
It's the night of the long knives
