I sit at home, I'm all alone,
I donât know what to do
Don't wanna see nobody else
I get so bored with all the news,
They bring me down again
I end up talking to myself
There is a voice inside my head
It talks to me again and says:
Wait,
âcos there is a million ways to make my day
Out on my own
Wait,
âcos there is a million songs , still left unsung,
Still to create
And itâs never too late

Whateverâs cool with all the fools
Is not for my own sake
Donât wanna ask for no oneâs help
Iâll find the key and let them see
I do it my own way
And if they try to break my will

The voice comes back into my head
It talks to me again and says:

Wait,
âcos there is a million ways to make my day
Out on my own
Wait,
âcos there is a million songs, still left unsung,
Still to create
And itâs never too late

Thereâs a way to be free from the dark
And thereâs a way to get out of all the cold
Thereâs a way to be safe from it all
Thereâs a way, a better way

There is a voice inside my head
Just walk the silver line
Or rather youâd be dead

Wait,
âcos there is a million ways to make your day
Out on your own
Wait,
âcos there is a million songs, still left unsung,
Still to create
And itâs never too late
