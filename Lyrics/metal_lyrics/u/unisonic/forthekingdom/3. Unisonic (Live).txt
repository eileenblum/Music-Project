Coming outta nowhere
Running from the rain
Rocking on a groove
Crying out again

Sing a little high
Sing a little low
Everything we do comes down to
Rock and roll...yeah

All I wanna be
All I wanna know
Got to feel the power
Loose control

Everybody there?
How about you?
Come on over here
Get in the groove

Another ride
Another day
We've come and gone
A long long way!
Unisonic, unisonic, unisonic

Chugging like a monster
Buzzing like a hive
Everything is set
To overdrive

Give a little here
Take a little there
Living on the edge but
I don't care.
