Life can be so frustrating
Boring and aggravating
So hard to read between the lines

Gotcha stuck in overdrive
But you're running low
As you fight against the undertow

And your heart is yeaming
World keeps on turning
No way back in time
Though your body is striving
Your soul is denying
Keeping you behind -
Then you come undone

Your fate is pre-decided
Opinions all provided
Everybody's got a piece of mind

Got a bottle of desolation
Let it fuel the fire
Then you crawl away from all desire

Now your heart is yeaming
The world keeps on turning
No way back in time
Though your body is striving
Your soul is denying
Keeping you behind -
Then you come undone

You can hold the flame
To find the way
And make you see
Light is hope, hope gives meaning
Take a chance and live
It's not too late,
Don't you come undone
