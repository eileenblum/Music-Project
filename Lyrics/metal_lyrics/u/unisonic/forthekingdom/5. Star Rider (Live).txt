The sky is dark, itâs nearing dawn
And all the senses are aware
The drama mounts, the cameraâs on
There is a tension in the air
All systems go, t minus nine
And vapor soars across the sun
Heâs lifting up to the divine
The thunder shakes him like a gun
All for one

Star rider â star rider
Heeding the call
Out in the heavens
One and for all

Heâs lifting up and looking out
Over the mountains down below
Raise your hands
Heâs got to prove, beyond a doubt
There is a space that we should know
Itâs such a grand illusion
And then the light becomes the dark
Home is so very far away
Got to stake your claim
The second stage left on the mark
Right on the mark
And all thatâs left is just to pray
Gonna be what you wanna be
Make the day!
Following the truth following the

Star rider â star rider
Heeding the call
Out in the heavens
One and for all

Itâs all that I wanna be
So much that I canât believe
Itâs magic!
Itâs all that I wanna be
So much that I canât believe

Itâs all that I wanna be
So much that I canât believe
Show me
Thereâs more than the eye can see
Far behind the sun...

Star rider â star rider
Heeding the call
Out in the heavens
One and for all
