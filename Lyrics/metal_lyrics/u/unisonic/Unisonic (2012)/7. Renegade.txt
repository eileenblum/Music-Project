[Music: Ward, Lyrics: Ward]

I can feel the winds are changing
thunderâs underground
Like an unsung visionary
longing to be found

Take me home
Iâve got no place I can roam
Been a rebel for so long
All the days Iâve had to be strong
being my own savior

Faces in the night
they storm the barricades
Run with the renegades
âwrongâ is now the ârightâ
leading this escapade
Run with the renegades

Is it time for retribution?
Or is it time to die?
Should I live in constant fear, itâs
one eye for an eye?

Iâm on fire
my will out reasons desire
And Iâm tired of walking the wire
All this time it took me to learn
I donât need a savior

Faces in the night
they storm the barricades
Run with the renegades
âwrongâ is now the ârightâ
leading this escapade
My pathâs already laid
when I run with the renegades

Take me home
thereâs nowhere left I can roam
Itâs a journey to the unknown
Iâve been waiting here far too long
let me be your savior

Faces in the night

Faces in the night
they storm the barricades
We run with the renegades
âwrongâ is now the ârightâ
out on our escapade
They carry us away, because
our pathâs already made
And we run with the renegades
