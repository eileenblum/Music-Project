[Music: Hansen, Lyrics: Hansen]

I sit at home, Iâm all alone,
I donât know what to do
don't wanna see nobody else
I get so bored with all the news,
they bring me down again
I end up talking to myself
There is a voice inside my head
it talks to me again and says:
Wait,
âcos there is a million ways to make my day
out on my own
Wait,
âcos there is a million songs, still left unsung,
still to create
and itâs never too late

Whateverâs cool with all the fools
is not for my own sake
donât wanna ask for no oneâs help
Iâll find the key and let them see
I do it my own way
and if they try to break my will

The voice comes back into my head
it talks to me again and says:

Wait,
âcos there is a million ways to make my day
out on my own
Wait,
âcos there is a million songs, still left unsung,
still to create
and itâs never too late

Thereâs a way to be free from the dark
and thereâs a way to get out of all the cold
Thereâs a way to be safe from it all
thereâs a way, a better way

There is a voice inside my head
just walk the silver line
or rather youâd be dead

Wait,
âcos there is a million ways to make your day
out on your own
Wait,
âcos there is a million songs, still left unsung,
still to create
and itâs never too late
