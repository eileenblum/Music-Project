[Music: Ward/Hansen, Lyrics: Ward]

I play a role in a world gone wrong
Create a man that can do what I can't do
Skills are meant for two.

Into the realm where the shadows fall
I'm looking for the one that will
Keep me safe from you
And tell me who is who

Now I'm hiding from the enemy
Just fighting to be me
I'm out in the cold

So alive, running free
In my sanctuary

Flying on wings of eternal bliss
Preoccupied with a creature that won't fall
I left him standing tall

I'm summoned then to a familiar place
And looming in the door is a woman oh so cool
She says "your kind of late for school"

Now I'm screaming out in misery
Why can't she leave me be?
I'm out in the cold

So alive, running free
In my sanctuary
Flying high, only me
In my sanctuary, my sanctuary

I'm hiding from the enemy
So much to loose
I wanna take control

Sanctuary, Sanctuary
Give me Sanctuary

So alive, running free
In my sanctuary
Flying high, only me
In my sanctuary, my sanctuary

Give me sanctuary, sanctuary
Give me sanctuary, sanctuary
So alive, running free
In my sanctuary
