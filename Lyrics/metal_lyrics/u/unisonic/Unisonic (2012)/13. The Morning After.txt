[Japanese Bonus Track]Still we go! It's all a show
How much farther can we fall, who knows?
There used to be eternal bliss everyday

Innocence has no defense
Being labeled as not heaven sent
It's the hardest lesson to be learned
And it shows us all the way

You can win, you can lose
You must try and have to choose
Don't give in! There will be a morning after

It's a fight, not a game!
And for love nothing's in vein
Don't just lock away the passion in your heart

Mothers cry, children die
All in all it's one goodbye
We're crying out: What's leading us through the night?!

Some of us carry much
It's often hard to stay in touch
With their inner light to guide them through
But it shows us all the way

You can win, you can lose
You must try and have to chose
Don't give in! There will be a morning after!

It's a fight, not a game!
And for love nothing's in vein
Don't give in! There will be a morning after!
