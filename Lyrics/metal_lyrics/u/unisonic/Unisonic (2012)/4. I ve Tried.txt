[Music: Ward, Lyrics: Ward]

Iâve been down
long and tedious roads
Stood alone in the dark
with all that I own
My agenda is open and simple:
I must survive, ohhhh

Thereâs so many things one can regret
and more that one denies
but Iâll always have my pride

Donât you know that Iâve tried
shying away from danger
hiding the tears Iâve cried
brushing aside the anger
God only knows how Iâve tried

The words define
and occupy our mind
but the question remains:
Is this craving for freedom
still what we strive?
For our hearts are torn with delusions
of who we are, ohhhh

So Iâll ask my judge and jurors be
to take it all in stride
cuzâ itâs building up inside

Donât you know that Iâve tried
shying away from danger
hiding the tears Iâve cried
brushing aside the anger

Yes Iâve tried
letting the rest think for me
swallowing all my pride
I never said Iâm sorry
but God only knows how Iâve tried

Where is the sin?
The crime is âknowing everythingâ
So I often wonder:
Why should I care
when the crimeâs everywhere?
I might have been a fool
for giving more than I had

Donât you know what Iâve tried
shying away from danger
hiding the tears Iâve cried
brushing aside the anger

Yes Iâve tried
letting the rest think for me
swallowing all my pride
I never said Iâm sorry
but God only knows how Iâve tried
yes, God only knows how Iâve tried
