[Music: Meyer/Hansen, Lyrics: Ward/Hansen]

Coming outta nowhere
Running from the rain
Rocking on a groove
Cryin out again

Sing a little high
Sing a little low
Everything we do comes down to
Rock and roll...yeah

All i wanna be
All i wanna know
Got to feel the power
Loose control

Everybody there?
How about you?
Come on over here
Get in the groove

Another ride
Another day
We've come and gone
A long long way!
Unisonic, unisonic, unisonic

Chuggin like a monster
Buzzin like a hive

Everything is set
To overdrive

Give a little here
Take a little there
Living on the edge but
I don't care.

Another ride
Another day
We've come and gone
A long long way!
Unisonic, unisonic, unisonic

Comin out of nowhere
Healing all the pain
Summoning the demons
From your brain

Frisk you up
Shake you down
Listen to the sounds around
And when the stars will come alive
A million voices fill the sky
And then a sound will shake the night
It's Unisonic!

And there's no end to come I know
There is no enemy or foe
We're cryin out for all the world to know:
We're Unisonic!

Unisonic!
