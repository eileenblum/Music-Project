[Music: Hansen, Lyrics: Hansen]

So here we're talking again tonight
and you say nothing is alright for you
that things could all be so much better
if I would choose a different way

Thereâs one thing you should know
before I turn to go:
Youâve pulled the trigger on a bomb
and the timerâs going crazy

No, youâll never change me tonight
âcos so far Iâm doing alright
Youâll get the best of me
but you will never change me
at all

Heaven knows what Iâve gone through
and the situationâs getting worse
the same old game, it drives me crazy

I need a place to hide
before I kiss the sky
Youâve got my back to the wall
but it never gets you anywhere

No, youâll never change me tonight
âcos so far Iâm doing alright
Youâll get the best of me
but you will never change me
never change me at all

Donât need a reason why
now go and kiss the sky
this is our last goodbye

Youâve got your ass on a bomb, and the timerâs going...

No, youâll never change me tonight
âcos so far Iâm doing alright
Youâll get the best of me
but you will never change me
never change me at all
