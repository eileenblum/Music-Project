[Music: Ward/Hansen, Lyrics: Ward]

Hands of time are spinning
miles and miles rolling away in the dark
One more night defeated
paid our dues so we can leave our mark
but it takes forever

Wait for me, oh wait for me
though all is said and done
driven by desire to be the number one

We rise, we fall
the writings on the wall
I donât want to live this life forever
Itâs all a game
Itâs always been the same
No one gets to live this life forever!

Seeds of fate are growing
like a vine creeping into the cracks
First comes the delusion
then reality will break you apart
without compensation

Wait for me, oh wait for me
though all is said and done
driven by desire to be the number one

We rise, we fall
the writings on the wall
I donât want to live this life forever
Itâs all a game
itâs always been the same
And no one gets to live this life forever!

We rise, we fall
the writings on the wall
I donât want to live this life forever!
Itâs all a game
itâs always been the same
no one gets to live this life forever!
