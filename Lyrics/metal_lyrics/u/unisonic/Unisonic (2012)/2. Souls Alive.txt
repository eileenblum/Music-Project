[Music: Meyer, Lyrics: Ward]

Shot in the dark, walk in the park
Hiding frustration, refusing to talk
Loosing your mind, pretending nothing is wrong.
Ooh, such a lonely child

Hiding the tears, wasting the years
Trapped in a world of despair

Kneel to insanity, donÂ´t let the cries be heard
They are the young hearts that suffer in the end
Need some time to make amends
Need to find another way

The cloth was only a disguise,
Abuse of power, simply lies
Heaven, keep their souls alive

Blank is the face, show no disgrace
Feeling alone in this gathering place
Reading the lines, but none define what they do

Ooh, what a cautious child

Open their mind, reasons weÂ´ll find
Why must one be so betrayed?

Kneel to insanity, don't let the cries be heard
They are the:

Young hearts that suffer in the end
Need some time to make amends
Need to find another way
The cloth was only a disguise,
Abuse of power, simply lies
Heaven, keep their souls alive

They see the light, feel the hand on their shoulder
Wrong or right? they donÂ´t want you to know
WhoÂ´s to blame? when the world's in denial
WhereÂ´s the shame? can you look them in the eyes?
Look at them in their eyes.
Can you see our demise?
