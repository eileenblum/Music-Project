[Music: Kiske, Lyrics: Kiske]

Anna hurts herself to cover up
the deeper pain inside
and if you ask sheâs alright
but in the night she cries

Her father says: You better get your head right!
Cause if you donât, youâll lose the fight of life!
Youâll find a man that will give you guidance
Who you can tell what you never shared with us
do you ever think about us?

No one ever sees me!
No one ever hears me!
No one knows me
No one feels my pain
I fade away

Satiâs dad is honoring
what always was tradition
he will choose whoâll marry her,
there must be no confusion!

And if she starts to babble âbout love
I will forget what I am made of
I will end her life with my own hands
do what it takes and what honor still demands
it ends right here

No one ever sees me!
No one ever hears me!
No one knows me
No one feels my pain
I fade away

No one ever sees me!
No one ever hears me!
No one knows me
No one feels my pain
