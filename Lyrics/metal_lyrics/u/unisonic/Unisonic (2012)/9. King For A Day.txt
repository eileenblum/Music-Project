[Music: Hansen, Lyrics: Hansen]

Where are the chains
that keep holding me down in my life
Who holds the key
to unlock all the doors in my mind

No one came to rescue me
I donât want to wait for a sign
I take my leave from all Iâve known
and fly out into the divine

Free as the wind
onwards I sail
King of my world
King for a day

Where is the love
Iâve been searching for all of the time
Who is the God
that just keeps me from heaven to find

On and on and on I hear myself
cry for redemption
Let me go
I walk the line and I will waste no time
Iâm free and I am me after all

Free as the wind
onwards I sail
King of my world
King for a day

I am free as the wind
onwards I sail
King of my world
King for a day

I am free as the wind
and on and on, on and on I sail
in my great white hall Iâm leaving all, Iâll
be forever
King for a day
