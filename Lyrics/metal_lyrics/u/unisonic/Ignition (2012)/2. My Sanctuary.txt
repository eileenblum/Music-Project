I play a role in a world so wrong
Create a man, I can do what I can do
Skills are meant for two
Into the realm where the shadows fall
Looking for the one that will keep me safe from you
Tell me who is who

Now I'm hiding from the enemy
Just spite, too beneath
I'm out in the cold

So alive, running free
In my sanctuary

Flying on wings of eternal blaze
Preocupied with a creature that won't fall
I left it standing tall
I saw the nature of a million place
Loaming in the dark is a woman old so cool
Just gotta late for school

Now I'm screaming out in misery
Why can't you leave me be?
I'm out in the cold

So alive, running free
In my sanctuary
Flying high, holding me
In my sanctuary, my sanctuary

I'm hiding from the enemy
So much to loose
I wanna take control (sanctuary)

Give me (sanctuary Ooh),
In my eyes, give me
(sanctuary, give me sanctuary
Oooh)

Give me sanctuary, sanctuary
(Oooh)
Give me sanctuary, sanctuary
Oooh

So alive, running free
In my sanctuary
Flying high, holding me
In my sanctuary, my sanctuary
Give me sanctuary, sanctuary
