When she said the bones
On - High
When she said the dog
Gone - High
Blast through the front
Door - High
Blast through the back
Doo - You're all mine - oh

I am the one day
I am the sun lay
Only if you and in your head
Something is wrong babe
Just come to me said
I am the only one for you, yea

When you move your hips
Babe, so fine
When you move your head
Babe, looking alright
When you shake your ass
Babe, your looking so fine
And when you said your heart breaks
You better shake it down

I am your only just because lonely
I am the one because you're true
I am your only, something is lonely,
Something is wrong because you're true
You are my only, something is gone now only because
And if you're true

You got me right, you got
You got me right, yeah, you got me
