Red like the river
Blue like the eyes of the woman who loves you
Red like the river
Blue like the eyes of the woman who hates you

Too many listen for love
Too many listen for hate
Too many listen for someone who wants to be something, someday
I'm gonna tell you something, Or nothing, yeah babe
I'm gonna stick it to someone, or something

I can't use that line
I can't use that line
I can't use that line
I can't use, use that fucking line
