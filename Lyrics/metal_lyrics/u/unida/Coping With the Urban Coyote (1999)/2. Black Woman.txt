Just ride all night long, yeah (alright)
Heavy like my lady
Just fly all night long, yeah ride on
Some say that you're crazy
That doesn't mean my face is always blue, yeah (alright)

Should it be the answer, should it be a sun?
Should it be the boy you never call you're gone (yeah)?
Should it be the intro should it be the sun?
Can it be the black girl you never call at one?

So can you find my lady
Can you justify the love you see tonight? yeah (right on)
So fly with me baby, just fly all night long (right on) huhh

Should it be the answer should it be the sun?
Should it be the yon you never want to come?
Should it be the intro should it be you're gone
Should it be your boy you never call your son?
Can it be the black girl you never call at one?
