Well I was born, I woke up in a hurricane
Too many lights come through than what I'm really used to
You're always drinking the hard line
You're only laughing at that fucking line
You've never taken the time to go, oh baby
Well I could get used to
Get used to
Get used to
Get used to
Oh baby, well I could get used to

And you were gone, like I've never really seen
You went through a rise, now we bring you to your knees
I hope you know what you came for
You only laughing at the locked door
You've never taken the time to go
Oh baby, well I could get used to
Get used to
Get used to
Get used to
Baby, well I could get used to
Get used to
Get used to
Get used to
Baby, well I could get used to

You're gone, without a brain, I said, you're gone
You, still get used to...
Oh baby, well I could get used to you
