And you should've told me
You had a nervous fucking break down
And you should've said to me
You were going down
And I should've told you
You heart, momma, it's going down
And you should've told me
You had a nervous fucking breakdown

And there's a flip side to that coin
There's a flip side to your coin
Well is there?
And there's a flip side to that coin
There's a flip side to your coin
Well is there? Is there?

And you should've told me
You had a nervous fucking breakdown
And I should've run from you
Well I'm not turning around
And you should've said to me
You heart, momma, it's going down
And you should've told me
You had a nervous fucking breakdown

And there's a flip side to that coin
There's a flip side to your coin
Well is there?
And there's a flip side to that coin
There's a flip side to your coin
Well is there?
Is there?
