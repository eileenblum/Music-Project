Do you wanna say goodbye to your best friend, your buddy?
Never wanted to slap to your girl, she's your money
I said love, only love
You spread your wings and you fly with the best
It's so bloody, it's so bloody

Love, whoa love, you wanna survive
Love, whoa love, you wanna survive

Take your time, take your hate out
I can tell you, it's a lady's game
You take a life of shit
Oh man, you almost went insane
Love, only love
No one cares, and you lie to yourself
It's a wrong place, it's the wrong face

Love, whoa love, you wanna survive
Love, whoa love, you wanna survive
Love, whoa love, you wanna survive

Love, only love
You spread your wings, and you fly with the best
It's so bloody, it's so bloody

Love, whoa love, you wanna survive
Love, whoa love, you wanna survive
Love, whoa love, you wanna survive
Love, whoa love, you wanna survive
