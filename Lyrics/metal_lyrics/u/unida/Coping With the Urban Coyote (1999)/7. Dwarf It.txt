Too many nights I said
Too many love the two ton bed
When you cry yourself to sleep
Next to your love that doesn't care

And you are the answer
To your own secrets in your head
So, so, so, so fucking sad

Too many nights I said
Too many love the two ton bed
And you cried yourself to sleep
'Cause your love is always scared

And you are the answer
To your own secrets in your head
So, so, so, so fucking sad
