Nothing, is gonna survive
And her thing, always alive
Despite on the edge
Well it'll make you cry
It's never ending
And never surrendering

Nothing, is gonna roll
And her thing, out of control
And shame, on the underdog
And who's to blame,
About the other day?
It's never ending
And never surrendering

Nothing, is gonna survive
And nothing, always alive
Despite on the edge
Well it'll make you cry
And who's to blame
About the other day?
It's never ending
And never surrendering
Her end, something new
And nothing, all but you
And the life you want to live
And the life you want to live
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right...
