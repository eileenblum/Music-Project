I never wanted to lend mine
I never needed to spend time
Someone's naked wearing my lights
Someone's sellin' a drug to my own wife

Well all right

I never wanted to lend mine
I never needed to spend time
Someone's naked wearing my lights
Someone's sellin' a drug to my own wife

Inside I go there in your life
And if you never believed in you/yeah will it ever come true
Then what the hell am I
What the hell am I
Doing with you

He always wanted to kick your hands
He never needed the hitman
Your sister's walking on the edge of my bed
Your mother's walking in the edge of my own head

He always wanted to kick your hands
He never needed the hitman
Your sister's walking on the edge of my bed
Your mother's walking in the edge of my own head

Now inside I go there in your life
And if you never believed in you/yeah will it ever come true babe
Then what the hell am I
What the hell am I
What the hell am I
Doing with you

Cause inside I go there in your life
And if you never believed in you/yeah will it ever come true babe
Then what the hell am I
What the hell am I
What the hell am I
Doing with you

Sittin', choppin'
Take a slice of can a blind so nice
Nothin' but talkin' and he even cried aloud time to me/tonight

Now inside I go there in your life
And if you never believed in you/yeah will it ever come true babe
Then what the hell am I
What the hell am I
What the hell am I
Doing with you
