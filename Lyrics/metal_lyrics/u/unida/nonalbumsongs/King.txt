Now why are you stuck in mine
When you've been gone lost in time
She took my plans, now how do you feel
When I've been askin' are you real

An I'll be your everything yeah
Your everything yeah,
Your everything well hello.
And they say you walk too fast,
They say you, talk too fast
Well in your blond hair face tonight

She said hey (I would like to)
She said maybe... (Would you like to?)
Just maybe.... well can you count the night time?
Hey (Well I like to)
Well oh baby (Would you like to see?)
I said maybe.
Well can you count the 9th time?

Then why are you stuck in mine
When you've been gone lost in time
You'll be my everything, my other thing
My everything, well goodbye

So if you ask my twice,
Some bout the night sometime
Then you'll be pushing down Tennessee
And she said hey... (What I like to...)
And just maybe... (Would you like to see?)

And since maybe,
Well can we make our own rhyme?
Well hey... (What I like to...)
Well oh baby... (Would you like to see?)
Just maybe

I said no
She said yes, oh yeah
I mean no, oh no

She said hey... (What I like to...)
Well oh baby... (Would you like to see?)
Well are you crazy?
Well could there be a next time?

Oh... (What I like to see)
Said oh ... (Would you like to see?)
Just go, Well then will you, will you
Go... (What I like to see)
So go... (Would you like to see?)
Just go
Well then will there be a fourth time?

Oh yea... (What I like to be)
Well oh yeah... (Would you like to see?)
well can you count the night time?
