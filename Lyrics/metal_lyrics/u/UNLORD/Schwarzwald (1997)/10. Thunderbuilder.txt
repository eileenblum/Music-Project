Thor
Terrorize the night
with your hammer
crush the weak of mind

Thunder
Brought before dawn
Prepare the underworld
for the final storm

Thunderbuilder
Bring us war
Thunderbuilder
Master Thor

Winds
Cleaning the lands
We raise our Iron fists
towards the horizon

Fire
The anvil of steel
Bring the hammer down
prepare the slaves to kneel

Thunderbuilder
Bring us war
Thunderbuilder
Supreme lord

Thunderbuilder
Enslaved are we
We tasted richness
paid the price and
chant unholy blasphemy

Beyond us fires burn
We hold our daggers high
And watch the lord return
Riding fierce right to the sky
