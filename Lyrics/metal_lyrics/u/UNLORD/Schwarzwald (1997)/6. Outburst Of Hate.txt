all holy houses
around the earth
by this means warned
for total destruction
the time has cometh
to set things right
the exploiting churches
all burnt down

outburst of hate

terrify all mortals with
the only choice
of heaven and hell
the treasures robbed
from all the men
are pillaged and burnt
to justify

the warmth
the fire
all sinners win
in our hands
burning torches
of evil flames
all burnt down
