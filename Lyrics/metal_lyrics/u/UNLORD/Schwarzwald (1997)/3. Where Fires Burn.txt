hear the dark call, burn with me
erased in darkness, blasphemy
a choice so clear, like skies so high
a life eternal, the eternal night
we build the stake, the sacrifice
and gather forever to end this life

and the flames are reaching high
as the hordes from hell arrive
the sacrifice is made
to resurrect the master

burn die headless corpse!
ghost ride on the cross
taste blood, demon's wine
unholy soul to be mine
praise the night when fires burn
in the haunt of no return
the call of darkness whips the sand
as we build our new land
our new land
where fires burn
