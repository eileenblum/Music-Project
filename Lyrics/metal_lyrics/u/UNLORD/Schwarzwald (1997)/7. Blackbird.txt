the wind carries on enticing voice
blackbird suffly has made her choice
I feel her power possessing me
trapped in her moisty cave my destiny

black bird black bird
my horny spirit
premortemly unsatisfied
devouring mortals
like sheep by wolves
blackbird blackbird fly

she haunts my dreams
her nails tear my skin
my soul my soul burns
eternal pain
burns like salt on the wound
the ultimate revenge
of the only with black wings

blackbird spread your wings
oh blackbird
her look will capture your mind
her lusts were never satisfied
devouring mortals
like sheep by wolves
