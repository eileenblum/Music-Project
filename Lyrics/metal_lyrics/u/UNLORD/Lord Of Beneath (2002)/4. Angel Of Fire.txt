[Visions of prophecies]

Praise the Unlord
From the earth ascends the creature, surrounded by red strokes of light,
as the young boy awakens, the beast looked up into the night
'You are here to serve me' speakes the one in tongues unknown,
'You are here to be tought, by the serpent hell has spawn'
Angel of Fire
The newborn sinks into sleep, for forty days and forty nights,
as a man he awakens, with the power to kill, the power to fight
'You have tought me, your serpents tought me, I'll avenge my bloodline,
for the prince of Evil Blasphemy'
Angel of Fire
