[Aha-Hith's conception]

And the serpent falls from heaven, he descends in human form
In this night his seed will arrive, in the womb of the gypsy whore
A young girl called Aha-Hith, was embraced by the demon of sin
With brute force he will take her, to him she will give in
Raised is the son all whats dark, raised among the slaves
Prisoner of the Christian hounds, the birthground of vile hate
'I deny the christ, the child of light, profane be his name'
A life of suffering, honour and blood as the son of God is slain
Saint in heaven
Sinner in Hell
Lucifer Descends
The Angel who fell
Pig on a cross
We have no remorse
In an age of war fall to the force of the serpent
And when my son arrives, the pig, who shall be crucified,
is the son of Nazareth, drink the blood from his head
Saint in heaven
Sinner in Hell
Lucifer Descends
The Angel who fell
Pig on a cross
We have no remorse
In an age of war fall to the force of the serpent
Raised is the son of all whats dark, raised among the slaves
Prisoner of the Christian hounds, the birthground of vile hate
'I deny the christ, the child of light, profane be his name'
A life of suffering, honour and blood as the son of God is slain
