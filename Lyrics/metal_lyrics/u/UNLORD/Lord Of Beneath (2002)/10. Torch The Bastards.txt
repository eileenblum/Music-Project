[Triumphant warmarch]

Bringer of Sword
Bringer of Flames
Bringer of Steel
Bringer of Pain
The galloping hordes, marching and slaying
Pounding hooves of death
Apocalyptic gladiator, leading the troops
The enemy, we behead
Bringer of Sword
Bringer of Flames
Bringer of Steel
Bringer of Pain
Master, guide me away from the light
Serpent, lead the people into the night
In sword we trust, your god is denied the sheer power you exhume
desecrate the christ in its tomb
overwhelm the bastard, the bastard whores
and set the controls for the Unlord
