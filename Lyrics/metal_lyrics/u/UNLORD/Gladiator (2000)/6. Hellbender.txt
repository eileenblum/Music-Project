[Wartales from the crusade towards Rome]

Riding on demons through forcefields of fire
Feeding the heat with raw steel and desire
Burning the christians, the whores and the slaves
Out on the run just to kill and slay

Raping the savages, storming the lands,
villages are left to be burned
Hellspawn evil crossfires descent,
the master of hell now returns

Thru acres we march on horses of steel,
we brutally ride through villages and fields
We're hunting old and the sick for their lives,
enslaving the weak, raping their wives
We melt what we steal, forging new swords,
our army is growing and hungry for war
Only the best gladiator survives,
only the strong, the darkest of minds

The heads of our slaves, are marking our paths,
a true christian is one slayed by our wrath
Animals we are, savage wild beasts,
upon your death earth, we are unleashed
The heads of our slaves, are marking our paths,
a true christian is one slayed by our wrath

Animals we are, savage wild beasts,
upon your death earth, we are unleashed
The heads of our slaves, are marking our paths,
a true christian is one slayed by our wrath
Animals we are, savage wild beasts,
upon your death earth, we are unleashed
