[Casting the spell upon Christianity (translated)]

From the womb is arising a new breed
Born from the horned one's powerseed
6 little goats with a human touch
6 pair of eyes like unclean rust

Impaled Liar

Thrown is the beast out of the devils womb
Bringing the salvation of unholy doom
Upon mankind and its stupid breed
Delivered in the hands of satanic greed

Impaled liar
Let the master come in human form
Impaled Liar
For he shall be followed by a thousand and one
Impaled Liar
He shall avenge and give the earth to the righteous one
Impaled Liar
Born is evil, satans son
