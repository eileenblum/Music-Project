[In sword we trust]

I leave the arena Covered with blood
Wounded but the triumph is mine
The betrayers appear, behind me they stand
Indulged by the opponents of lies
My master in spirit warned me before
Your close ones stand for demise
I seek for assistance
Which I find in my sword
But the bastards give me no time

'For it is power that we wil need
to kill the lord of sin
he brought us victory when we
thought we couldn't win'

They stabbed him and stabbed him, murderers
Betrayal of their lord
forgotten that they have sworn,
in the night of sin
To his steel sword

'For it is power that we wil need
to kill the lord of sin
he brought us victory when we
thought we couldn't win'

He's left in the temple, raises up his head
'Master, why have thy summoned me'
His last words vanished, his eyes closed down
and his body is reborn for blasphemy

In the night after, when the moon was gone,
suddenly a vision appears
to the betrayers all drunken of lust,
trapped in their own fear

'For it is power that we wil need
to kill the lord of sin
he brought us victory when we
thought we couldn't win'
