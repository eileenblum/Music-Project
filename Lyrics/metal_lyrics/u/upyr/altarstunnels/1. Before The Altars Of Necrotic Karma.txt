Deserted groan from haunted sickened mind,
Not meant to reach deliverance.
The webs so strong that shroud me back to you
And only you can save me from.
Oh, will I drown again into this endless chasm of pain
Or I will mesmerize myself, entering the emptiness.

Murder! Treason! Screaming within.
Dearest! Distant! Our colors fade.

And when your shadow grows chaotic legions march my soul.
I kneel to sacrifice myself to save the rest what's left of you.
As I sink into the Mire, our colors fade.

I let the storm within to deconstruct, devour my will.
Of bond that dies by our own hands, of life that ends before the end.
Our love could only blossom in a soil of blood and tears,
And now we separate the magnets, it's time for farewell, my dear.

As I kneel before the altars of necrotic karma.

Clouds of Nihil above my head.
Chemical rivers running through my veins.
If we could only blossom, but we fade.

Sobriety is lost.
Corrupted self.
Empty.
Self.
Empty.
Shell.

As I kneel before the altars of necrotic karma.
Altars of death.
