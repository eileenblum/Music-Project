Thick shadows weight upon the Hypnos gates of sleep.
My fears running deep into the borderland of dreams.
I can't rest no more in that capsule I've built from the seizures of my wrongs and the solid walls of fear.

Kneel, my savior, kneel, beside my weakened body
And guard me with your shield in horrid nights like these.
Shivering in liquid state. Half-asleep, half-awake.
In the vortex of ill thoughts when I close my eyes I see the black no more.

Shapeless demons feeding from miasmic soul.
Wake me, oh You, Monarchs of the Not or drown me once and for all.
Godless landscapes are my dreams. Endless tunnels of my sleep.
Here I belong where the walls are echoing my cries:
"Phobetor, Epiales, Patheos, Oneiroi!"

The night is not a host. The day brings no salvation.
In hypnagogic trance, hallucinate, each time I fall apart.
Lucid dreams and dreadful hours
When I close my eyes I see no black.
At the Hypnos gates of sleep into the borderland of dreams.

Kneel, my guardian, kneel, beside my feverish body,
and cover with your shield the wreckage left of me.
