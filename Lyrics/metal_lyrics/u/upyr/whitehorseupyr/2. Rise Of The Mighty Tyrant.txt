[performed by Upyr]No I can't spend more time in this graveyard.
I know some call it home but I want out of here, alive.
I see Him rising in barren lands, uh.
his voice is calling, darkness descents.

We crowd around deceitful Saviour
to set our souls rest in torture chambers.
I see Him rising from ruthless pest.
His arms wide open to procreate.

For our Lust he has come.
Obscure entity.
And his Kingdom we Become.
Dark contemplation.
On our greed he now feeds.
Chimeric evil luxuriates.
For our Lust he has come.

If I could only not witness that grim sight.
of heavy-laden burden and demise.
If I could only save them with my prayers
before their faces ashen with the gravest stare.
If I could only not witness that grim sight.
Malignant Will that withers, devours all mankind.

Invocation of the Hollow,
Sacrificial whorish mass,
Hypnotizing eyes illuminate.
Ab-human minions gather to serve as carnal Host.
The might tyrant rises, his Kingdom now befalls.
And the flock comes marching in, as we are all so full of Sin.

Manifestation of the Hollow, corpse-riving noisome rout.
His voice is calling you into the void.
And the swarm/herd comes marching in as we are all so full of Sin.

Dark form materializing of putrid flesh and bone.
Under the sickle moon on a throne of ancient stone.
