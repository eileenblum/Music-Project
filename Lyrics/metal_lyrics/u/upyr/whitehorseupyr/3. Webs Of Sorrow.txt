[performed by Upyr]Unlit fire I want to bring, the cryptic truth I seek.
I lick the sacred toad to leave that dismal hole.
Feasting on my leaking spleen, absorbing poison deep within.
In psychedelic waltz mind stumbles on the threshold.

Beyond the reason I commit like toxic sprite I creep.
Unveiling what's concealed still comfortless I kneel.
Drifting far from self-appeal, less earthbound I fail to feel.
Wretched yet I grasp again the doom of mortal men.

In that unhallowed shrine blurred are my ghastly eyes.
The missing answers hide where webs of sorrow lie.
There's nothing I adore. No, nothing I stand forâ¦
Hopeless I withdraw.

Elders, elders, speak to me. Why am I so blind to see?
And thousand questions are clouding my mid.
Elders, elders, speak to me.What's the purpose of my being?
And thousand questions are clouding my mid.

Unlit fire never meant to burn.
Plunged in shadows in our kin.
The missing answers hide where webs of sorrow lie.
There's nothing to adore.

And where horizons end I will meet you dear friend.
As we embrace the tides of chilling endless night.
