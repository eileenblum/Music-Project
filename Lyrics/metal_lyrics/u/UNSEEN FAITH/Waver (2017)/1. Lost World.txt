We aren't prophets or priests holding a holy cross
Only beggars and thieves living in great remorse

This place is a wasteland
We are destined to fall
Like a castle in the sand
Crumbling apart
This place is a wasteland
We are destined to fall

A hopeless life, a hopeless time
We're forever lost
Kill all, crave all
Nothing left to save us
Only memories left to be broken
Antichrist will arise
Six six six

This place is a wasteland
We are destined to fall
This is it; life or death
This place is a wasteland
We are standing on the edge
Which way will you take?

We are blinded by the gods we've made
We have forgotten the one who creates
We are facing our final breath
We are facing our final fate
Wasted

A hopeless life, a hopeless time
We're forever lost
Kill all, crave all
Nothing left to save us
Only memories left to be broken
Antichrist will arise
Six six six

I can hear the angels cry tears of blood in the sky
Open my eyes take me to the see highest heights
I can hear the angels
I can hear the angels cry tears of blood
