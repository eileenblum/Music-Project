I don't know which way is right but I believe once I die I will be alive
All around me turns into death
Wherever I go I stumble in the mess

No control over anything
When will all this shit fall in order
All the questions I do not understand
Or is it me, misreading

How can this be life?
Will I pay the price?

I don't know which way is the right but I believe; once I die I will be alive
All around me turns into death
Wherever I go I stumble in the mess
I don't know which war is the right but I believe; once I die I will be alive
When the moon and stars fall from the sky, will I be alive

Loosing myself to my obsessions
I forget what matters the most
Putting out all my aggressions
Don't believe this is my confession

How can this be life?
Will I pay the price?

They call me sceptic
I call them hypocrites
The lies run deep, deeper than you think
Sceptic, I am

I don't know which way is the right but I believe; once I die I will be alive
All around me turns into death
Wherever I go I stumble in the mess

I don't know which way is the right but I believe;
I don't know which way is the right but I believe; once I die I will be alive
