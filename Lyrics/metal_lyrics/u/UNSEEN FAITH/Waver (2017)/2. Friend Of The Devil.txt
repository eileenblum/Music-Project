Hell, is empty
The devil is here

Forgive me now,
I have sold my soul for gold
Years of addiction to greed has lead me to this
These lies are hard to resist

Make me see
What's the truth
Make me see
What's to loose
Don't you try to forget
Every time you've lost the bet

I know, I know
I am the only one to blame
Even though I wish to forget
All the pain we used to 'cause
I am not a friend of the devil

Make me see
What's the truth
Make me see
What's to loose
Don't you try to forget
Every time you've lost the bet

I wish I had cut out your filthy tongue
And never heard you speak out to me
I am a man who doesn't stand back from a fight with you
I am not afraid

I'll rip out your heart
To show you that you are nothing to me
I will never see you again

I'm no friend of the devil
I'm no friend of the devil
Friend of the devil
