We all know what is coming to us all
Death in all its holy glory
We all know what it comes down to in the end
It's part of life they say
I say it's what it takes

I do not believe we are meant to die
Die alone
Inevitably it leaves us broken inside
Religious or not; no man shall be afraid

We are a species in search
Searching for answers
Why do we fear the unknown?
It's a sickness to mankind
Wake up
There's nowhere to hide
Don't fear what is coming

We all know what is coming to us all
Death in all its holy glory
We all know what it comes down to in the end
It's part of life they say
I say it's what it takes

In the end, we'll only regret
All the chances we didn't take

It's a sickness to mankind
Wake up
I hope don't see what we will become
Wake up
