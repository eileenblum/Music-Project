This is our sacred home
Why do we keep repeating?
The countless wars?

Look at the world we make
Look at the world we create

We're cheating and beating
We forget we're one race
Filled with disgrace

Above the ashes of our failures
We'll make a new foundation
Tomorrow is alive
Tomorrow never dies

Look at the world we make
Look at the world we create

Side by side together we will rise!
We will rise!
We will rise!
Side by side, we will rise!
