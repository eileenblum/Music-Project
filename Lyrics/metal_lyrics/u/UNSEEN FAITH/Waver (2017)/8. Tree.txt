Good people turn into wolfs
I would rather say nothing
Than speak with you

Drinking my own poison, I'm polluting myself
Hate will become my disease
It is eaten me up from the inside
But still I will try to see

A beautiful tree so mighty, strong and tall
Tree of the earth
Remove my curse
A beautiful feeling; I hear you call
Tree of the earth
Tree of the earth

I want to stretch my branches towards the light of the sun
No storm shake me
No storm can break me [2x]

Desperate people use desperate measures
Desperate people use desperate words
They go for the throat

My selfishness makes me forget
What I want
Arrogance blindfolds me
So, I can't see

A beautiful tree so mighty, strong and tall
Tree of the earth
Remove my curse
A beautiful feeling; I hear you call
Tree of the earth
Tree of the earth

No storm shake me
No storm can break me [2x]

A beautiful tree so mighty, strong and tall
Tree of the earth
Remove my curse
A beautiful feeling; I hear you call
Tree of the earth
Tree of the earth
