You have forgotten your children
You have abandoned the weak
Why don't you answer when people are calling
You have forgotten your children
You have abandoned the weak
Why don't you answer when people are calling
Don't you hear them screaming?

My hope is burning out
My contempt is growing bigger
The world is on fire, don't let it burn

King of kings, king of the universe
Your spirit echoes throughout the earth
Calm the storm, calm the fire
King of kings, king of the universe
The true alpha, the only omega
Save our souls!

You are the maker and creator
You are the judge and the jury
Why have you rejected so many people?

King of kings, king of the universe
Your spirit echoes throughout the earth
Calm the storm, calm the fire
King of kings, king of the universe
The true alpha, the only omega
Save our souls!

Eager voices calling
Praying for you to come down
Save our souls
