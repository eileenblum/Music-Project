Do you remember?
Remember when my heart was filled with constant hope?
Do you remember
That time when I broke the promise I made?

Do you remember? [2x]

Take my wrath; refrain my anger!
Rescue me, attach my anchor! [2x]

Anchor me

I still remember
Remember when my heart was filled with constant hope
I still remember
That time when I broke the promise I made

I still remember!

I will give anything
To go back to that moment
I will give anything
To go back
