I donât want a funeral
Without the tears or red swollen eyes
Do I dare to take the risk
To live a life with you by my side

This is not the first time I find myself buried beneath
I always end up lying in my own grave (Lying in my grave)
Going back and forth â to what end?
Raised from the death - we stand here again

Show me a sign
Give me something real
Something to hold on to
Something that is clear

These thoughts keep spinning around and around
It is all in my head
I want to live it out
Take the control
Cover the grave

For every second you lie to my face
Is a second wasted in life
Show me a sign
Give me something real
Every second you lie to my face
Is a second wasted in life
Show me a sign
Give me something real

Please tell me if you think Iâm wrong
Iâll walk away and leave you alone
Letâs not settle for anything less
Than we aim for

I donât want a funeral
Without the tears or red swollen eyes
Do I dare to take the risk
to live a life with you by my side?

I want to walk the earth to search for our home â in this world
I will not rest until you start to believe in my words
If that day arises - unified, no compromise
No more tries, no more fights, no more lies

I donât want a funeral
Without the tears or red swollen eyes
Do I dare to take the risk
To live a life with you by my side
