They live in a game where every human looks the same.
Shoulder to shoulder they walk
Try not to break the ranks
Donât lose the momentum, donât fall behind
When they jump, why do you follow?
Donât lose the momentum, donât fall behind
Break the chain, break the chain, and walk away

They put on a fake smile
They put on a mask
You put on a fake smile
You put on a mask

Take it off show your face
Take it off show your face


I am the voice
That speaks out your name
Take it off show your face
Take it off show your face

My mask is not my story
My mask hides my glory
My mask is not my story (my story)

Take of your mask

Let it go

Marching down the streets to the break of dawn
Our fists raised in peace
Take back your life

I am the voice
That speaks out your name
Take it off show your face
Take it off show your face

I am the voice
That speaks out your name
Take it off and show your face to me
Show your face
