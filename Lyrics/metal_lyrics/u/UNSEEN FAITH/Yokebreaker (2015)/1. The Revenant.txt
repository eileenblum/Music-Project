In a mist I walk around in despair
It is unbelievable how hard it is to breathe
Under the heavy burden of false words

All the accusations you speak about me
All the filthy rumors you spread about me
It once was the truth that I lived
But here I am.
Free
Thatâs no longer me.

I have left and broke the chain.
I threw my old cloak away [2x]
I have started to adapt
To a new life
To a new start

Still I hear whispers in the mist

âDonât think we will ever forget
Forget the things you did
Nobody will ever change
Youâre still the man
You used to be
Donât think we will ever forget
Forget the things you did
Youâre still the man
You used to beâ

I know I have done you wrong
I hope you feel it is long time gone
I admit my evil deeds

Take me as I am
Donât turn your back on me
This is who I am
This is what I have to offer.

I have left and broke the chain.
I threw my old cloak away [2x]
I have started to adapt
To a new life
To a new start

Take me back [2x]

Take me as I am
Donât turn your back on me
This is who I am
This is what I have to offer.
