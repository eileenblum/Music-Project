I have scars
Scars that will never go away
Memories that will forever stay

Temptation, hunger and chaos
This is what you bring into my life

Your words [2x]
Are like poison to my ears
Your words [2x]
Bring up the hidden fear


With you I feel hunger and lust
Destruction it costs
Where you go
Darkness will prevail

I have taken you down
My enemy
ENEMY

Still I fear your return
My enemy

You want me to stand up, just to fall back down
Screaming nonsense, I hear the sound

I got to admit
I feel the attraction to run in your nest
Once again
Once again

Chaos, chaos
This is all youâll ever know
Chaos, chaos
This is what you bring to my world

Stay away
Donât come any closer

Your words [2x]
Are old stories to my ears
Your words [2x]
Will forever stay unclear
