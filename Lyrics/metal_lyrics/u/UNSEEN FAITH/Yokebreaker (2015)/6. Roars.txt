A bone shivering storm
roars like thunder
A million words like hails
Keeping us constrained
in this slavery

Ground is shaking, walls are breaking,
Flickering eyes, hidden behind their disguise

Closer to the true I
Closer to the break from why
closer to the will to life
And closer to the break from my death

Shut your mouth
Stay out of my head
With all your lies
I know I welcomed you
I know how great mistake it was
Disappear and never come back again

Iâm sick and tired of giving up
I lost my mind it had to stop

Life is what we make it
Grab it, own it and make it yours

And their voice says dance to the rhythm from our head
From the dead
On the verge of insanity
Enslaved by their vanity
Everything beyond seems to have lost
its will and its course.
Strangely different poles, numbers and equations without a meaning.

True image, true purpose, true life
Where will we find our way
Here we stand now full of destruction
Nowhere to place it
Nowhere to hide it
Thatâs how it feels, but we must keep walking
Just keep walking
Just keep walking!

Life is what we make it
Grab it, own it and make it yours
