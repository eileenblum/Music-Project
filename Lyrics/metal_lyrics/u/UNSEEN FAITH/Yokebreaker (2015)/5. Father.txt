Are we left to rot in hell?
No one is going to save us?
In the distance I hear a voice
So calm
So warm

See through the dark
I hear the silent sound
In the darkest days
The darkness fades away
The world is our home
We are not alone
Stop all the angry roars
Accept the difference

It is all or nothing
We donât have anything to lose
This is what weâve created
All lies

Now it is time to chose
This is the final hour
It is all or nothing
What are we waiting for?

Great powers threaten the dream about a peaceful world
False prophets fill us with empty hopes
Blow out the only light
In this world
Make us blind and deaf
The peace becomes consumed by lies
This is hell

Fear becomes hate
Hate becomes destruction
We all have fear
We got to stop the corruption
Fight for our world
Love becomes peace
Peace becomes silence
The silence of unity
What is the big mystery?

Why do we keep talking?
We rather want to see the world burn
What are we so scared of?
Look your brother in the eyes

So tell me who got the blame?
Is it me or is it you?
Or is it all of us

So tell me who got the blame
Tell me who got the blame
Tell me who got the blame
Tell me who got the blame
