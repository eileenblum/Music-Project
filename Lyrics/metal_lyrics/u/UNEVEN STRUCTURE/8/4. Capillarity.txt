Going right away through the meaningless form of capillar structure tied to the fibers of used flesh.
It sinks into primordial synapses of the very essential part of the inextricable cage of emotions.

Ripping away the barrier. Delivering so much power
that ridiculous inert matter can not even exist - be animated.
Do these misaligned cells deserve the incandescent and necessary ray of life?
Realms of voltaic reactions bathe in the ultimate void.

Going right away through the meaningless form of capillar structure tied to the fibers of used flesh.
It sinks into primordial synapses of the very essential part of the inextricable cage of emotions.

An absence of life...
