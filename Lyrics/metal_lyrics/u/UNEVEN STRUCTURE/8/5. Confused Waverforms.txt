And absence of sense...

All is false - Everything is illusion.
To incur a constant, yet linear spurious waves of feeling.
Abnegation is the only way so all dreams looks true.
Reality is impulsion. Never being as it unconsistanly shows.
Fainting it all - Reality of confused waveforms.

Predefined as an altered model of chaos.
Undefined as a stream of energy.
That ridiculous inert matter can not even exist - be animated.
Does these misaligned cells deserve the incandescent and necessary ray of life?
Realms of voltaic reactions bathe in the ultimate void and absence of sense.
