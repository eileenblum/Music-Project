A regretful instant breaks
This is not the road leading to fullness
This is not what I wanted to reach
This is not the place I belong to
This is not where I was supposed to land
This is not the aim of this routine
This is not why I did build this
This is not a conclusion
This is not who I was meant to be
Why this discrepancy
A cause lost into fraudulent behaviors
Depicting a strong weakness of the self
All integrity shattered in million pieces
Mislead into temptation
This is not a denial, this is the true face of resentment
I demand redemption for all my transgressions
Prepared to strip myself down to the gist
A deafening silence slants over this desert
The burn of these distresses is extinct
I feel now freed from that perturbed shallowness 
Ready to take one last impulse and lift off
I am aloud in the escape
Allowed to leave this place.
