...gray landscape filled with pitch black clouds
All heat has gone sensing frost
Frost, surrounding everything, freezing it
Trapped into thy consciousness
A flawless void pours into the indefinite shell
Extinguishing the inner discomfort, drowning it
And wiping the haze out of these glass bulwarks
Emptiness of Everything magnifies thy sensitivity
As the pain slowly resorbs and lets the channels free
Motionless ashes structures the horizon
Mentally building an uneven grid
Polygonal nests modeling brightless patterns
The only visible waypoints giving a comprehension
An understanding of the depth of this non energy
The subconscious strings can be felt now
Controlling the actions as a puppet master
This manikin state avoids me to make mistakes
Every little stimulation reproduces an ersatz of freewill
Informations runs through these freshly born pits of senses
The revigorating effect buries the verity of the context
Now the assimilation (is done), host of an education.
