Unleashed, the components takes over everything with no consideration
The will to annihilate every element of this abhorrent scene becomes ripening
A fierce ocean spills toward this already botched up kingdom 
It is now my turn to draw strings shackling this disgusting matrix
At the apex of the obelisk, order can be determined beyond one's sight
Escaping the uncertainness of these realms
A ceremony to seat the presidency of a now frigid blossom
Desire spouts down the surface
Eroding this illusion of wellness
Once taking one's lump through hail
I am now casting it back, hampering it all
Evoking awe.
