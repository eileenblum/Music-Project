Hail
Walls of rain washes out the innocence
The magnificent flood carves the letters down the flesh
Hierarchy slips into the felt strings - Alterating it all
Facing the preys as if they were real threats - Schism
Paranoid illusions leading to an higher step of evolution
A lull in the storm
Scattered clouds
At the break of the day
The allayer of fears
Dissipates the marks
Dries out the swamping lands
As water resorbs, ground can finally be seen
Very first sensation of an embodied existence
Fertility welcomes an higher comfort
An abode where experiences can melt.
