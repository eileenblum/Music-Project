A stream, a motion
Lifting matter through the bonds
Sentience of knowledge
Healing the scars of innocence
I rationally straighten the surroundings, theorise the randomness
Scraping the surface, infinite bandings are exposed
Hypnotised by the vertigiousness of things to come
I break the ropes of whiteness out and burst into buds
Getting closer to a well-defined path
A chess-like game where all pieces are mine
Buds, sprouts
Boundless in cognition
Escalating the tower of Babel
The coiled design mesmerises me
Am I taking this for the promised land?
Bemused by this opportunity
The fragile balance is lost 
Too soon to dive in, too late to scarper
I glimpse the agressive vastness of this mental fluctuation
Essence is corrupted by vice emanating out of knowledge
And that unbeatable volition of tasting to ultimate perfection collapses
Magnifying the shadow of failure toward the ramparts of sageness
Now is the moment where my reign begins.
