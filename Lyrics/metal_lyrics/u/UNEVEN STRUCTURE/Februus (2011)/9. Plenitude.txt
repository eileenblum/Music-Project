No longer connected to the ground
The ultimate ascension is triggered
No longer obstructed from my condition
Everything is revealed
Curves crossing and dead ends are all past
The vivid chunk is standing out in front of me
Still out of reach it irradiates my essence
Last breath before air turns into light
The dim contrast of the experience vanishes
Colorless patterns are filled with a permanent brightness
The convergence of every challenges and disillusions
Spurs me beyond the very state of grace
A measureless momentum where matter and mind
Collapses together to commute into Plenitude.
