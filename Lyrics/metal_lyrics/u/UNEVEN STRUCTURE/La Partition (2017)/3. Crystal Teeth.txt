Endurance no more, I let myself cave in after the exhaustion of my race
Vanished, I let myself slide down this slippery slope

Stumbling back and forth between spit and breath
As I sense again the caress of your mold, its warm milk
Revelations happens where screams are forged

I'm remembering the seed I was, growing up in there
Every second, every moment is now staring at my face

I have to find my way in these crystal teeth

So brittle yet so sharp, reflecting a million selves
Is all of them looking us down
Pick apart but what have you done?

Too proud to give a fuck, too weak to take a step
There's no answer to find through your idleness
We need to consider the journey
Think over the actions and appreciate their direction
