Embarrassment of eternal darkness,
With the ancient souls by my side.
In solitude I have my pride.
I'm a darkness worshipper.

In my stone heart
Your black flame burns.
My eyes are as cold as death.
My blood is rivers of hate.

Far beyond all light,
Within the dark and coldest breeze,
My soul is blackened,
It reflects your flames.

Broken dreams of immortality,
As I drown in obscurity.
Let me become a soldier of darkness,
I will command the destruction of light.

In my stone heart
Your black flame burns.
My eyes are as cold as death.
My blood is rivers of hate.

Far beyond all light,
Within the dark and coldest breeze,
My soul is blackened,
It reflects your flames.
