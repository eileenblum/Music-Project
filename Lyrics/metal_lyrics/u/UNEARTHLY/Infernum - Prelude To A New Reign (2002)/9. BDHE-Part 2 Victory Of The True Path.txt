The time has come
To take revenge,
For what they've done
They will pay.

Raise your axe,
Raise your sword,
Prepare to engage in the battle
That we've been waiting for.

No sign of Christianity
Shall prevail,
They shall be
Erased from the earth.

We've been silent for so long,
Now it's time for us to speak
And take action over them,
Destroy them and their beliefs.

We'll make them run,
Make them cry,
Make them beg
For mercy.
The mercy that
They didn't find
In their lord
Who looked away.

Victory of the true path!
Victory of the true path!

Christians have ran,
Have cried,
Have begged
For mercy.
The mercy that
They didn't find
In their lord
Who looked away.
