Inspired by blasphemous signs I live
Denying sacred dogmas
Christ weeping image
Inspires hate on me.

I'm marked by blasphemy
Denial of Jesus Christ.
Destroying false hope,
Living under the sign of blasphemy.

Not born to be a slave of faith.
Cursed I am by Christian standards.
Won't feel mercy for those that I hate.

Living under the sign of blasphemy,
Destroying all false hope,
Punishing christian believers.

Delighted by Christ's grieving face,
Proud to be his enemy,
Proud to hate his name.

Living under the sign of blasphemy!
