They've based the meaning of human race
Upon an idol's fame of grace,
But errors have been put in recognition,
Are those "the mysteries of religion"?

But the day has come.
Their "greatness" has gone.
While they're still waiting for Jesus,
We'll take revenge for all their insults

Blindly believe
And wish for me
The eternal suffering

Wait for your "Lord",
Die by my sword.
Days of storm for christian souls.
Wait for your "Lord",
Die by my sword.
Days of storm for christian souls.

Or words are
Like an axe through
The skull of Jesus Christ
