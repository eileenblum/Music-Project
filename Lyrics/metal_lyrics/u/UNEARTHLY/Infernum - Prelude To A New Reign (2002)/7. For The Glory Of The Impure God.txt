For the glory of the impure god!

For revenge we shall be known,
Destroying the kingdom of the Christian's lord
The angels grieving we shall hear,
As we hunt them down and let them bleed.

For never a messiah has caused such hate,
And made the infernal legions awake.
And even his father will fall in hell,
Something the bible never did tell.

We will prove that Jesus is a fake,
Just like when Judas his lord betrayed,
A mere human who wanted fame
For world's troubles we have to blame.

For the glory of the Lord of Hell
We shall praise the elevation of the self,
No more glorification of fakes,
The chains of religion we shall brake.

For the glory of the Lord of Hell
We shall praise the elevation of the self,
No more glorification of fakes,
The chains of religion we shall brake.

Battle for the destruction of hypocrisy's empire
