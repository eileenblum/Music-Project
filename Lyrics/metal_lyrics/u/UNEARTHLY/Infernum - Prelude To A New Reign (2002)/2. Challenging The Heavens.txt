Humanity, creatures of habit
In the need of superior beings
Need of idol, and heroes.
Need of superior entities.

Eternally thought
To search for the "Lord"
To reach the eternal life

Following the divine,
Christians are enchanted
Following the path of Christ,
Following the path of lies.

I'm challenging the heavens
To make a sign,
To prove me that
They exist.

Oh heavens!
They're not responding,
They are so afraid,
They are so weak.
Or they don't exist,
The way Christians preach.

Oh heavens!
They're not responding,
They are so afraid,
They are so weak.
Or they don't exist,
The way Christians preach.

There's not a "God"
For us to believe,
Fantasies, lies, fakes...
Christianity!
