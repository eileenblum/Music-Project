Caliber of my rage
Made with a touch of disgrace
Nothing can stop me now
Death is my name

Colt is my hate
Turns this into an empty place
I hold the power of mayhem
Sight of untrue pray

FULL METAL, FULL METAL JACKET 7.62
FULL METAL, FULL METAL JACKET 7.62

ONE SHOT, ONE KILL.
I SEE RED.
