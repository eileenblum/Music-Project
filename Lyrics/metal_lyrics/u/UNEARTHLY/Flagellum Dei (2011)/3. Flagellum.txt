Godâs flagellation is more than the eyes can see
Behold your wishes are what make him bleed

I believe what I can see
I believe what I can hear
I believe what I can taste
I believe what I can feel
I make my laws
I follow my rules
Godâs flagellation starts now
I am the Flagellum Dei
Anti-god terrorist face
