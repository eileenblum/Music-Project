From its birth, the black light will shine upon our souls
It will convulse the earth
Annunciation will be proclaimed
Alfa and Omega will be released
As the lightning comes from the east 
And flashes from the west, 
That will be the coming of the son of beast.
But the day of them will come, like thieves in the night, 
In which the heavens will pass away with great noise, 
Osmotic Haeresis 
And the elements will melt with fervent heat; 
Both the earth and the works will be burned up.
The worm that lived in your body is now dead
