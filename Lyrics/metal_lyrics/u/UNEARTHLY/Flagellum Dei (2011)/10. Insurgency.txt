Who are you?
Who is the next?
Listen to voices from the past?
Orders you to lie down in a void
Bring me your head to deploy

The instant insurgency
You take only one sacrifice
Just for your own salvation
Pleasure becomes a vice 
Addicted in that thing who turned my life

I give you a whole new life
Under oath you will hear my commands
The edge of the knife
Flowing through your hands

Refuse to be innocent
Wounds of insurgence
