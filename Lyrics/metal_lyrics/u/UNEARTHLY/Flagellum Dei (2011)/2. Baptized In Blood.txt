Under siege of my ideals and my conflicts
I started to question myself
âIâll either be the refuge or the heroâ

Taken by revulsion, 
I only imagine the bereavement 
Upon their deathbeds

I am like few, rare and lethal
Revenge is my sacrifice
But I canât go alone
This is the moment, destroying all of men's beliefs
In this battle everyone is my enemy, itâs no time for innocence, for my sadness has shed, a body fell to the ground.

Baptized in blood I marched to war, 
In the name of god and my insanity 

Itâs me against the world, this is my ideal, I shock the world Baptizing in blood
