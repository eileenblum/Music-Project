I hear the screams
Coming from the blast
Under the black sun
Now here I am 
From hell and back
Under the black sun
The testimony of unearthly faith
Is the nature of Discordia
Antithesis of giving life to the scum
Revival by the blood of the damned
Shed and offered
In honor of thy unholy star
The gathering shall live forevermore
The abjuration of sacred life
Mighty pest flowing through me
