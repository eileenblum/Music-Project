Life for life
Forgotten by god, rise up!
Eye for an eye
Death by death
Anti-god, rise up!
Every day, battles are grand
Death's on your feet
The trial is done
Fallen into the gutter 
With anger and death
Building an Empire
In this territory 
Chorus.
From the hills, he controls all movement
Creating insanity, bringing the pain
People crawling out in disgrace
Revenge is so truthful
Your god will fall at my feet.
All denying the one god.
Chaos will be the new order
Symbol of man's inherent nature
Redeemer by the blood
Adversary to all spiritual creeds 
Lex taliionis viam meam
Kill God
Revenge is so truthful
your god will fall at my feet.
All denying the one god.
Chaos will be the new order
only the path of fire
will bring freedom to all
lex taliionis viam meam
