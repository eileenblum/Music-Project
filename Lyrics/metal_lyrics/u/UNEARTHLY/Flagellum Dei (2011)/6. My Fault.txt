Sweet disease running in my veins
Smells like sorrow, fear and pain
Black blisters blown up in my brain
Nothing but ashes shall remain 
My Fault
Condemned by hate
My Fault
Poisoned by faith   
Affliction runs down by the bloody river
Suffocating my reason
Beyond our arms, beyond our breath
Who will set me free?
The last step, bullet in my head
