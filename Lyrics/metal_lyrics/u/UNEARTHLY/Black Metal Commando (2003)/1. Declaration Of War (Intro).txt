The ultimatum has been stated,
And time has expired.
We can no longer see this world
Being dominated by hypocrisy.

We declare war,
Seeking freedom.
We will no longer stand
Alienation crawling over these lands

We shall crush their heads,
For now war is inevitable.
With hateful eyes
We stare at the enemy that shall be beaten.

Behold our armies!
Behold them advancing
In the name of blasphemous freedom.

Destruction and bestial devastation
Is what we offer to our enemies.
Death to their dogmas and doctrines.
We shall mercilessly crush their empire.

We shall establish a new order
No gods, no masters, no religion.
