Elite troops
Ready to attack,
Destroying hypocrisy
As a way of life.

Mass hypnosis
Assaulted with hate.
Violent interventions,
Made to provocate.

Fully loaded weapons
To aim, shoot and annihilate
Religious mind domination
And their preachers of fakes.

Hungry for revenge,
War is what we shall taste!
Hungry for revenge,
War is what we shall taste!

War has been declared,
Peace is not an option.
Black metal commando
Shall attack with
Unholy devotion.
