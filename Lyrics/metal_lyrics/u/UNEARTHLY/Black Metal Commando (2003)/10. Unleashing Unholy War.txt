Raising our weapons,
Christianity is our target.
War to destroy
The reason for blindness
Attack with a stone heart,
We are unleashing unholy war

Revealing against
A weak saviour
Of heroic corruption
And humanity's
Self destruction.

Attack by all means
Every christian belief.
Conquer their lands,
Install the flag of sin.

Install the sense of confusion
Over "world peace"
Christian illusion.
Total war to eliminate
Institutions made to alienate.

War, war, war, war,
War to eliminate the
Installment of blind hope.
War, war, war,
War to eliminate the
Followers of the cross.
War, war, war,
War to eliminate the
Installment of blind hope.
War, war, war, war...
