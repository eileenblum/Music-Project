Where lands were created,
Allegedly by a peaceful master,
Death rises in the air
Proclaiming disaster

War / hate / disgrace
War / hate / disgrace

A deeper examination
Of what reality is,
Shows that god has failed
We've fallen into the abyss
In the chaos
Of god's invention
Humans are victims
Of god's "biggest inspiration"
