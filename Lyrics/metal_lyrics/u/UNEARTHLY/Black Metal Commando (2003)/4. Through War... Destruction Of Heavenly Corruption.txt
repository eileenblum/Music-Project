Corrupted by "good",
Confusing the truth,
Angelical topics
Exposed human wounds.

Hear the screams
From the abyss.
Don't dare to spit rules.
This war is your deed
Hatred on me!

War of revelation,
No acceptance of redemption.
For too long the divine hand
Has swayed humanity's cradle.

Such filthy corruption,
Spreading mass illusion
And, finding no retribution,
Humanity's led to destruction.

Bombing christian ideology,
Holy institutions fall to pieces.
Inverting heavenly intentions,
Like christian crosses inversions.
