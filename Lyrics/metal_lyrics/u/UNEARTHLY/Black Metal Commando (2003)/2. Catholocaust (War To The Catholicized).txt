A revival of crucifixion
To end this weak addiction
Of accepting god's mistakes

Catholocaust!
The awakening of human nature
Against god's whims and perversions.

Never again shall guilt and fear
Command human behaviour
For a catholocaust shall erase
The idea of a holy saviour.

Total human deprivation,
By psy-catholic education.
Total nature misconception
To be destroyed by
Our war declaration.

Declaration of war.

Suffer!
Even more than your messiah.
Victim of our holocaust!
Is that your god's desire?
