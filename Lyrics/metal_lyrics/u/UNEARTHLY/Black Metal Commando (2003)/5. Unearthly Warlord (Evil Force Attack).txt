I've come
Proclaiming war,
I've been breaking
God's sent commands.

I've been unleashed
To unmask christian preached lies.
Attacking holy institutions,
Delusion of heavenly retribution.

No more christian preached lies
Shall have importance
On human life.

Die, servants of the light.
The unholy revenge is here.
Christianity's death is near.

Rise, servants of the night
Attack by all means
Every slave of god's whims.

Preacher of masked fakes,
Be the victim of our rage.
I am the cause of your god's woe
Bringing revelations
Of unholy truth.
