To watch his mutilation
And his sublime face
To wrinkle in pain
Tears running down his face

Murder the messiah
Prophet of illusions

Our hate is eternal
We condemn his dogmas
His coming to earth
Will be chaotic again

Murder the messiah
Prophet of illusions

We are marked and we accept
The number of the beast
Spread our and your desires
During centuries we have waited
For his return
Your martirium...is ready

Pain, disgrace
In his cross again
Pain, disgrace and agony
