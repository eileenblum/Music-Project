The age of chaos was installed
Inert on violence
Terrible by the chaos
Much has spoken
But any as proved
The age of chaos
When the crucified was idol

Call your name Maha Kali
Call your era Kali Yuga

The age of chaos was installed
Lies and false
Answers were exposed
War for your name
Kill those who are against
Behind this bastard era
The age of chaos was installed

Call your name Maha Kali
Call your era Kali Yuga

No mercy, pay for your mistakes
It is not novelty, we kill for nothing
It is not today if this era has
Instituted
