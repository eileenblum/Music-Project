He is already between us
Walking between people
Commanding his legions
His is a not different
From me or you

Make the ritual
That you believe
It's a false law
Blind doctrines

I'm incarnation of salvation
The way and the truth
I'm the light and the faith
I am the Antichrist

The god's face, now I possessed
The triumphal turn is now

Humans without soul
The vengeance does not pass
Of a request of justice
The vulgar era has devastated
The truth was sealed
Now the chaos for the
Christian souls
