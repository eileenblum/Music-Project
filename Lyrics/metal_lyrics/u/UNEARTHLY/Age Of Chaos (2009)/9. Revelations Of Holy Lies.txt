We are cruel dogs
We came to reveal
We are called heretics
His doctrine of pretense
It will be totally destroyed
With the fire...

What burns in our eyes
His decimated faith
We will stain with our blood
The great book of the lies

All his greed
It survived for centuries
Telling a dissonant hope
Our blood boils

Revelations of holy lies
