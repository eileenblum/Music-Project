I hear songs of war
Carried by the strong winds
Coming from the battlefield

Anthems of preparation

The war continues
Attacks are inevitable
They didn't succeed to stop

Anthems of preparation

Marches that anticipate the battle
They couldn't control our onslaughts

We are determined to crush
The church and the lies
We are determined to destroy

Anthems of preparation

They will feel the steel of our bayonets
Punishing through their flesh
We will see in their eyes
The despair of their soul

Anthems, marches and war songs

Their blood spilling itself
Through our hands
Stains the ground we step on
Through the earth

Anthems, marches and war songs
