Quiet and obscure look
Before a devastated land
The scent of death rises
And it is present everywhere
Clear revelations of intolerance
Battles everywhere

The angel of death present
Satisfies his dark wishes

Every ripped out soul
Is like a prize
Christian lives agonizing
Ritual must go on
More deaths are necessary
Let you massacre
Kill your enemies
With only one short

Kill all hypocrisy
Crush all false hope
Wake the eternal pain
The scent of death rises
