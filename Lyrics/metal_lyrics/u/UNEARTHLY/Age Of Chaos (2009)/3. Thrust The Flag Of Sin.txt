Fixating human nature
Feelings and actions
Without fear of punishment
Of summary condemnation

Without the real knowledge
Of each being's interior

Install your feelings
Without pre-judgment
Of what's good or wrong
That's the satanism we defend

Thrust the flag of sin

Opposition to all dogmas
Destruction of doctrines
Crushing alleged sanctities
That's our way of life

We don't kneel nor prostrate
Before inert figures
Pathetic statues created to press
Join us to install the flag
