Look into your past, what can you see?
Lack of reprisal
Walked upon as though you don't exist
Call out to no one

Light shines through, transparent as my pain
Darkness in my eyes
Soulless, fragile, broken mortal frame
The ending of life

Reach inside to find that place of real
Take me from hell to freedom
Transcend the pool of broken dreams
Walking from the shadows

Break me, hate you
What do you find when you turn this stone?
Like me, I'm like you
Does this make you a better man?
You've broken my mind
Has it taken you there?

Moments of clarity pierce the hollow
Living from the shadows
Exposing all to all who care
Repressed by times gone by

Torn within, scars of the mind
Frail, with each new layer
In me I trust, in you I find
Nothing but betrayal

Reach inside to find that place of real
Take me from hell to freedom
Transcend the pool of broken dreams
Walking from the shadows

Break me, hate you
What do you find when you turn this stone?
Like me, I'm like you
Does this make you a better man?
You've broken my mind
Has it taken you there?

Reach inside to find that place of real
Take me from hell to freedom
Transcend the pool of broken dreams
Walking from the shadows

Break me, hate you
What do you find when you turn this stone?
Like me, I'm like you
Does this make you a better man?
You've broken my mind
Has it taken you there?
