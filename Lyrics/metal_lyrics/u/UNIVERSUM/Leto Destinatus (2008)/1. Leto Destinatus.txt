What a slap in the face
Whiplash! Never saw the impact
Can he see their life?
Fall before his eyes

Hell no
Justify this pain
Drained and dropped, now it's all over
In his eyes a dead man's gaze on fire

This life so great
Who ever knew it could end so fast
But surely there's another way?
This building rage, I feel it's going to explode

Now time rolls by
The cracks emerge, breaking down another moment
Now, one more time
In this life no one ever wanted this

I know I will find you someday
Take you from this world
You will always fear and
I can't free you

He stalks at night
Weaving through the shadows of daylight
Everyone hates the lies
How well do you know him?
If his spirit's broken he'd accept it alright
But his will won't let it lie
And it will never collapse

I know I will find you someday
Take you from this world
You will always fear and
I can't free you

I say, look in my mind
See the wreckage buried deep inside

And now I see you walking right by
It's well known you'll never be left alone
And I was the one that you were falling for
That life I adored
I refuse to let anybody love you
I refuse to let anybody love you

A mistake to hurt me
I never wanted this for you
I see now I was used
We never had a chance to waste

Now we spread to the world with this darkness within
Shed a tear for no one, a cold so deep inside
It would block out the sun, no light for no one
A mental void, damaging everything
I can't hold my sanity

[Solo: M. Soininen]

And now I see you walking right by
It's well known you'll never be left alone
And I was the one that you were falling for
That life I adored

Stand high in this troubled mind
Fall to pieces with every moment
Stand high in this thoughtless life
We're never moving on
