Reaching out for something more, something else
Listening in silence from within this shell
Trapped as this futile life turns to hell
Last page of the final chapter, blank to read

Is this destiny locked in time?
Another bearing grinding, grinding to nothing
Can't challenge this sequence locked inside
I close my eyes and search within

With each day I dissipate
And die a bit, searching inside
I can't cross the line
This psychologic mind
I won't allow it
No, I won't allow it!

Search deeper for something more, something else
Reaching out from within this shell
Trapped as this shit turns to hell
The last page of this final chapter rips

Another life dissolved in time
Another bearing grinding, grinding to nothing
A locked in sequence of self destruction
I rupture

As everyday falls far away
I can't take it
I won't return
And it feels like the struggle is ending

Prepared in the darkest shades of light
A challenge of mind to do or die
Can't do anything at all

With each day I dissipate
And die a bit, searching inside
I can't cross the line
This psychologic mind

I've lost myself to misery
I can't use your sympathy
I won't allow it
No, I won't allow it!

As everyday falls far away
I can't take it
I won't return
And it feels like the struggle is ending

[Lead: M. Soininen]

I stay for a higher day
But each is one, and one of the same
This misery cell of mind
Keeps the demons inside

As the event horizon pulls me in
The black hole of life, my creation, my sin
And driving internal forces of decreation
Blinded by this darkness

Leeches take hold and let bleed
As the light of life leaves without me
And take flight on the machines of eternity
With blood dripping from these fucking wings

As everyday falls far away
I can't take it
I won't return
And it feels this struggle has ended
