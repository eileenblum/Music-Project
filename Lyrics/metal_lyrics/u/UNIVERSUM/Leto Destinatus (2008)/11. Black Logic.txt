Thrashing through all that is me
Stranglehold on my soul
Blinded by this self driven machine
The burnt, frayed ends of control

Why do I feel obliged to such enmity?
A faithless, perfidious being
Through all the years, such allegiance to me
There's emptiness within

Screaming, running from times gone by
Another turn in this lifeless life
I'm further from my field of dreams
Temptation has won this time

Puncture my soul with sordid angst
As I fade away from the real I find
Washing away with this amber of mine
Numbing decay of the drowning mind

Strength pulled from the raging depths of my hate
Replacing my weakness and fear
Born from this, the force you see in me
Your injustice is near

Piece by piece, rebuilt upon tragedy
Transformed by retribution
Ever evolving sense of worthiness
Vengeance will be ruthless

Screaming, running from times gone by
Another turn in this lifeless life
I'm closer to my field of dreams
Temptation has lost this time

Mending my soul with the sweet of revenge
As I realise the real I find
Pouring away all this amber of mine
Faithless!
No more do I feel this time

Screaming, running from times gone by
Another turn in this lifeless life
I'm closer to my field of dreams
Temptation has lost this time

Healing my soul with the sweet of revenge
As I realise the real I find
Pouring away all this amber of mine
Faithless!
No more do I feel this time
