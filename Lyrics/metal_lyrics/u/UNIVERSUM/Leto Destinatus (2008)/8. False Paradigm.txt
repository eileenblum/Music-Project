It's as though we can't believe
That our earth will ever come to an end
And with our insatiable taste for failure
Regeneration never a chance to begin

Intellect surrendered to desire and greed
Humanity has become earth's disease
With only everything to regret now
As this world comes crashing down

Down, as we shut our eyes and turn away
Drowning deep in this slow state of decay
Blinded and conceited, self justified
As another earth bleeds and dies

And still we can not believe
That our earth is bleeding to an end
Still trapped in a state of negation
Until the beginning of the end

To ourselves we perpetuate this lie
Blackened artifacts remain in our minds
And now we wonder how
The whole world came crashing down

Down, as we shut our eyes and turned away
No remorse, we laid our earth to waste
Shame, blinded and conceited
As earth bleeds and dies

Evolution, a fabled illusion
Humanity's self annihilation
We fall, toward the sun
Burning in ignorance, it brings us down
Our ignorance apparent now
How?
Our ignorance burns us down

Well I'm waiting for us to learn but I'm walking in circles
I'm waiting, why don't we learn? We're going nowhere
I'm waiting! Yet we're still walking in circles
Well I'm waiting, why don't we learn?
What the fuck is wrong with us?

Evolution, a fabled illusion
Humanity's self annihilation
We fall, toward the sun
Burning in ignorance, it brings us down
Our ignorance apparent now
How?
Our ignorance burns us down
