[Instrumental]

"Deep in a mind of haunting shadows
Loss and silence keep away the sleep
Drifting through the sacred moments
And emotional scars cut so deep
Filtering the fragments of time
Contemplating all to be left behind
Consumed and cold, I lay awake
With nothing more now
Than a plan for the great escape..."
