Come all you fiends and swine
Another life passes by this time
Claim redemption in a new religion
Crossing over to the other side

What's your halo doing in this dirt field?
You're waiting for something
Praying it's alright

I'm praying for everything in this life
Pieces of me, you're taking away
Whatever I say, whatever I do
My life is falling away

Systems crashing
Eternal misery if you like
I wanted far more

For ever and now
You pray for me
I'll pray for you
I choose not to hide, but to be a man
Don't jeopardise future lives for cheap values
Pray for me, I'll pray for you

Come all you filth and pain
Another life passes by this time
Claim redemption in a new religion
Crossing over to the other side

Claim redemption in a new religion
Crossing over to the other side

What's your halo doing in this dirt field?
You're waiting for something
Praying it's alright

I'm praying for everything in this life
Pieces of me, you're taking away
Whatever I say, whatever I do
My life is falling away

Systems are crashing
There's no cure for this bitter taste
My fight, you break

It's all I had
For ever and now
You pray for me
I'll pray for you
I choose not to hide, but to be a man
Don't jeopardise future lives for cheap values
Pray for me, I'll pray for you

I'd rather see you buried alive
Another lie, we peel away
Show me something, give us hope
Or be the next strung up to waste
I will live for nothing else
Absorb the lies and twisted filth
I'm falling, we're all falling
Another day in this lifeless pull

[Lead: M. Soininen]

I'm searching for something in this life
Pieces of me, you're taking away
Whatever I say, whatever I do
My life is falling away
