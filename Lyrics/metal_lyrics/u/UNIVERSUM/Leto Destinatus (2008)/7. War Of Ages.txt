Changing minds like the wind
I'm forever blaming you
That time dissolves to emptiness
It's spiraling inwards
The windows into the unknown
Captures this moment
Sometimes we find that we want to see
This is our story

Yes I give my life to you
A memory in waiting
Cataclysmic clash of the gods
This is the war of ages

With simple contemplation
I find the complex
No more my will
But the way it will be
Relentless searching
This is self realisation
And I know nothing

Show me all that you have lost
It's time to show your colours
Fail to see the light from the dark
Now I grant you freedom

Yes I give my life to you
A memory in waiting
Cataclysmic clash of the gods
This is the war of ages
Yes I give my life to you
A memory in waiting
Cataclysmic clash of the gods
This is the war of ages
