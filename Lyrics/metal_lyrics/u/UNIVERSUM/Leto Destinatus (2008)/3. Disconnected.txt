Who'll give you a picture of your life?
Supplying the rage to burn
Fragments of nothing, no meaning, no light
Lock it tighter in your mind

You'll systematically process more lies
Drown the life deep in your mind
They die staring at you
Indifferent to what you're screaming about

I have no answers this time
So many times I'll watch you fall
I'll see it one more time
Giving up on you is closing the door

You'll drop this time
On the tight rope of life, you're walking blind
Fall back, last breath
Meet the man, it's time to shine

Who'll give you a picture of your life?
Eternal rage to burn
You've got nothing, no meaning, no light
Twisted, locked inside your mind

Your calculating resides this time
Accepting the voice this one last time
Life skewed to the side
Not caring to know what I'm screaming about

So many times you tried to realise
That everything in time will be just fine
But I can't see the path when tears blur my sight
Please heal my plight

I have no answers this time
So many times I'll watch you fall
I'll see it one more time
Giving up on you is closing the door

You'll drop this time
On the tight rope of life, you're walking blind
Fall back, last breath
Meet the man, it's time to shine

Pessimism's the creature hiding deep within your mind
Dissatisfaction purports to waste away your time
We've got to fight for the keys to unlock our life
Accept the task hold on tight

Fight this fight
Just to prove you own your life
Don't let integrity fall on blind eyes
Tear through the shattered remains

have no answers this time
So many times I'll watch you fall
I'll see it one more time
Giving up on you is closing the door

You'll drop this time
On the tight rope of life, you're walking blind
Fall back, last breath
Meet the man, it's time to shine

I want to show you everything
This love we live in, can you feel it?
Reach out and take it, there's no limit
Flood your soul with inner healing

Honour your being, you're so perfect
It takes all types to make this earth spin
You, are you real?
Yes, you're real
It's all real
