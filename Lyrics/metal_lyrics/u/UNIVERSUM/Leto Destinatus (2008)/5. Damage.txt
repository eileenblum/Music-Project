As this day unfolds I'll cease to exist
I'm losing control and you, you're turning away
How can you explain that I'll mean more to you when I'm missed?
I'm bleeding in pain as you leave me to go through this

Falling away, the connection torn
Misplaced existence, I'm alone
Everything is set to end today
Fading away, the damage is done
Desperation grips, life is undone
There was always a time when it would end this way

Everything I ever was is gone
Finally my soul can breathe
Was there any point to the damage done?
Was it time for me to leave?

Falling away, the connection torn
Misplaced existence, I'm alone
Everything is set to end today
Fading away, the damage is done
Desperation grips, life is undone
There was always a time when it would end this way
