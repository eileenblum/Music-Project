Glimpse into a new life
Cut through darkest nights
Guardian of truths
It's my keeper

Like the flames of a dying star
My memories are fading
Understanding who you are
I live for no one

Desire and determination
Hartfelt desperation
It's time to wake up from your lies

Now you're breathing new life
Through clarity of mind
Walk without fear
I can stand alone

Like the flames of a dying star
My memories are fading
Understanding who you are
I live for no one

And I feel
Like you're the one who makes it
So real
As feelings unfold, I'll take it all

Well I've suffered
For no reason than to ease your pain
It cuts deeper
Deeper than before

Like the flames of a dying star
My memories are fading
Understanding who you are
I live for no one

And I feel
Like you're the one who makes it
So real
As feelings unfold, I'll take it all

Now I'm breathing new life
Through clarity of mind
Walk without fear
I can stand alone
