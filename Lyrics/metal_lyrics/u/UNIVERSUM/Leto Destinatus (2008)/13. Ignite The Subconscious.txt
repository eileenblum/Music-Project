There once was a place I used to live
Emotionless, cold, void and nil
Dejected by the places I used to want to go
So many years have broken me down

And I never said this life lived far away
Inside seeks strength, but that memory has drowned
To pass you by in this backwards life

We are created
Specifically for your entertainment
This is termination

It's just another life
It's just another life

Reflect on yesterdays
Another sober moment
I am the fool of my own game
I've broken up over social taunts
And stay a victim in my own world

Today is the end of it all
If I'm going to break
It would be for something better than this
I'll stand no matter if I'm to trip

Did you feel like you're worth nothing?
These days will come to an end

Do you feel unloved?
Is there something weighing on your mind?
It's all gathering dust
That's where it lays, all by your side

[Lead: T. Laisto]

Today is the end of it all
If I'm going to break
It would be for something better than this
I'll stand no matter if I'm to trip

And everything is great
Yes fucking great

And I never said this life lived far away
Inside seeks strength, but that memory has drowned
To pass you by in this backwards life

We are created
Specifically for your entertainment
This is termination

Now it's time to die
