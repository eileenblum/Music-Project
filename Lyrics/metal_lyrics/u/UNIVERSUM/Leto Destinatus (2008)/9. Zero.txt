Closing in the skies of grey
Celestial winds will take me
Floating in between two worlds
Caught in the ethereal

All I have ever said and done
Has let to this point in my life
Now as I reach for the truth
It's time to say goodbye

Fire upon me
I will kill you
You'll go down this time
Told what to do
Told what to say
So take it as the truth
What lies?

Screams paralysed by absolution
You are free from nothing
Make the ultimate sacrifice
All you love left behind

You've been called to take the blame
Come on forth and feed the flame
Another pawn in the big men's game
We'll roll this dice, there's no shame

Bloodied heroes on parade
Death and carnage on display
Count the ones who chose to stay
All of this amounts to zero!

Colours splay the sky
Screams paint the night
An eye for an eye

Meet your maker
You're a number
You're not missed
Just a count of the crime

Take a look, we're the walking dead
Transient existence

If I was to die, would you die for me?
If I was to die, would you die for me?
Would you die for me?

Celestial winds will take me
Floating in between two worlds
Caught in the ethereal

All I have ever said and done
Has let to this point in my life
Now as I reach for the truth
It's time to say goodbye

Fire upon me
I will kill you
You'll go down this time
Told what to do
Told what to say
So take it as the truth
What lies?

Screams paralysed by absolution
You are free from nothing
Make the ultimate sacrifice
All you love left behind

You've been called to take the blame
Come on forth and feed the flame
Another pawn in the big men's game
We'll roll this dice, there's no shame

Bloodied heroes on parade
Wounds and carnage on display
Count the ones who chose to stay
All of this amounts to zero!
