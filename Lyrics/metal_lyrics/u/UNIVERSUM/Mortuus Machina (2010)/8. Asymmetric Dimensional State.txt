[Music: M. Soininen, Words: A. Soininen]

Torn between frayed realities
Shattered forms of oblivion
Deprived of light and sanity
Weakened by this fear and pain

A negated call to reincarnate
From failure to find the light within
Skewed waves of thought located
In this dimensional asymmetry

Delusions filter the light
Human form lives to die
Prepared for endless night
Pain ignites the flame inside

Flames traverse the lines
Of self hate and desolation
Stained in fading transparency
Now what colours do I show?

Past life blinded by fear
And faltered ascendancy
Distorted states of disparity
Ignite the war inside of me

[Lead: Michael Soininen]

Delusions filter the light
Human form lives to die
Prepared for endless night
Pain ignites the flame inside

[Lead: Stephen Murphy]

Delusions filter the light
Human form lives to die
Prepared for endless night
Pain ignites the flame inside
