[Music: M. Soininen, Words: M. Soininen]

You and I, one and the same
These eyes so drained
We march as one, numb beings
Slaves to the new order

The higher echelon pre-determined
An unbreakable cycle
A deliberate step into thankless ranks

The certainty of our future
May fire you into greatness
Kneel now and etch your name

Work to live, live to die
All but a few see through
Subliminally shown how to move through life
In everything we do

Deflected all cohesive thought
A droning sound, machines in idle

The certainty of our future
May fire you into greatness
Kneel now and etch your name

You and I, one and the same
These eyes so drained
We march, numb beings
Slaves to the new order

Work to live and live to die
All but a few see through
Subliminally shown how to move through life
In everything we do

Yes we are one, one and the same

Deflected all cohesive thought
A droning sound, machines in idle
