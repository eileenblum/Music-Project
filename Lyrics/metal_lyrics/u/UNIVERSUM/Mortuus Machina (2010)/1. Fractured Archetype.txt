[Music: S. Murphy, M. Soininen, Words: S. Murphy]

Suspended deep within the cognition storm
A shattered perception of existence evermore
The depression born futility burning inside
Fuels the vortex of this mental suicide
Ingesting the darkness as we're lacing the end
An injected sequence of systematic descent
Distorting evolution of the eternal machine
As we turn the page towards our blank infinity

Subjugated, cyber archetypes the new divinity
Mutilated, dark mutations of biotechnology
Desecrated, remnants of the final resistance
Annihilated, the fallen human subsistence

Corroding the existence of this cybernetic mind
The disconnected genetics sci-cloning inside
Processing this state of dimensional symmetry
A million light years inside a cold magnetic dream
Disseminating this disease of tech-pestilence
This integrated sequence of systematic descent
Eradicating the final fragments of reality
As we turn the page towards a blank infinity

Time burns life from the mortal frame
Breaking down the structured bio-machinery

Reborn in this symbiotic state
True retrogression of humanity
Apathetic as we sell disintegrate
Oblivious to this insanity...

Inhuman form ignites, induced from past decay
Ever frozen in time
The emptiness of this depleted energy
Burns forever inside
