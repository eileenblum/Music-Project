[Music: M. Soininen, Words: M. Soininen, S. Murphy, A. Soininen]

I take these hands
And place them round your throat
Mortality near straight away

And still I run from this fucking pain
Infected, this curse unknown
Changing, distorted, deranged within
The degeneration ends

After this sense of reality
The question begs, why was I chosen?
Powerless in this fight for immunity
Against this genetic sequence distortion

We're all the same and this is not a game
The ones you loved left alone, unchanged
Take the strength and burn it away
Pull it apart and start again
Never again I'll feel this pain
Hauled down to hell, more of the same
More of the same

Lifeless, I take your soul
Absorbing your affliction
Making it into my own

[Lead: Michael Soininen]

Re-engineering the mind
Morphing of the flesh
A fate inherited in blood
Infected with malevolence

Malignant strains coursing through these veins
Cut in deep like a curse from hell
Changing, distorted,
deranged within Degenerations end

After this sense of reality
The question begs, why was I chosen?
Powerless in this fight for immunity
Against this genetic sequence distortion

Can you see me now?
My pathogenesis
Cut me from this sequenced chain
Can you see me now?
My pathogenesis
Destroy this relapsing metastasis

We're all the same and this is not a game
The ones you loved left alone, unchanged
Take the strength and burn it away
Pull it apart and start again
Never again I'll feel  this pain
Hauled down to hell, more of the same
More of the same

[Lead: Michael Soininen]

You're enslaved
Suppressed in your mental cage
A mutilated sin of my time
Wretched, wasted it all
It takes every ounce of strength
Induced mutated genes
Creation's failed auto immunity
Failed immunity
