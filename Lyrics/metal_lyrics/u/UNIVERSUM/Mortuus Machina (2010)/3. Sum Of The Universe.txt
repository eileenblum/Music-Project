[Music: M. Soininen, Words: M. Soininen]

Traces of life dispersed through eternity
The onslaught of evolution
Remnants of worlds floating in darkness
This is all our Universum

Meridian lines through space and time
Continuum, bring forth a solution
A small cog in the grand design
Spin us a new revolution

It is certain

Did we exist before time?
Is this our final dejection?
A dissipating point of aggression
Indifferent toward our perception

Can you hear them through the pain
All but one are calling
They see you losing your own way
Closed eyes, no one remains

[Lead: Olof MÃ¶rck]
[Lead: Marios Iliopoulos]

I can't feel anything
These thoughts are blinding me
Detached from all that's real
I don't want anything
It's taking over me

[Lead: Michael Soininen]

Turn from the world
I'm leaving all behind
Transcending all the lies

Did we exist before time?

Is this our final dejection?
A dissipating point of aggression
Worlds of indifference toward our perception

Traces of life dispersed through eternity
The onslaught of evolution

Remnants of the worlds floating in darkness
This is all our Universum

Meridian lines through space and time
Continuum, bring forth a solution
A small cog in the grand design
Spin us a new revolution

It's uncertain?

Fearless, they're trembling
Ageless, the reckoning
It's damaging
Pure memories
All uncertainty, my mortality

Can you hear them through the pain
All but one are calling
They see you losing your own way
Closed eyes, no one remains
