Breathing in the chilled air
The final taste of these last days
Filled with vast depression
Reminiscent of yesterday

The weathering of old storms
This face of years gone by
Cold with regret, empty wasted life
Standing, watching in slow motion
Conscious thought completely dissolves

Despair calling out my name
Can't protect myself from this anymore
Constantly consumed with these thoughts
Cold as winter's breath
The final moment sets in

Watch until the end
Look into the eye, I'm falling
Nothing lasts forever
To watch, watch until the end,
To gaze into the eye, we're falling
Nothing lives forever

Tomorrow bring me rest
Lay waste to these dying cells
This emptiness inside
To exist where nothingness dwells

The weathering of old storms
This face of years gone by
Cold with regret, empty wasted life
Standing, watching in slow motion
Conscious thought completely dissolves

Hunting, searching for the answers
To an existence never resolved

[Lead: Stephen Murphy]

Live forever
Sheltered from your reality
I've known no better
Deprived of life and normality

Can't control this
Fallen in too deep
Skewed waves of thought reside in me
Bleak dimension of asymmetry
Of asymmetry

And now
We watch until the end
Look into the eye, I'm falling
Nothing lasts for ever
To watch, watch until the end,
To gaze into the eye, we're falling
Nothing lives for ever

Breathing in the chilled air
The final taste of these last days
Filled with vast depression
Reminiscent of yesterday

Hunting, searching for the answers
To an existence never resolved

And now, watch until the end
Look into the eye, I'm falling
Nothing lasts for ever
To watch, watch until the end
To gaze into the eye, we're falling
Nothing lives for ever
