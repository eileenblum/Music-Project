[Music: M. Soininen, Words: M. Soininen, A. Soininen, S. Murphy]

Cold and disillusioned with you
What do you offer?
Pain, self defeat, blacken my view
So be it, I'll take another

Defiance in all who brought me down
Denied oneself from life
Conside in no one else for the fear of truth
Torn from fragmented youth

[Lead: Michael Soininen]

Push me beyond cerebral limits
Potential's there for the taking
Drifting through these blackened skies
Set forth upon my awakening

I hear you in the wind
Lead me to my saviour
I stand before my former self
Shadowed now forever

Life transformed to these memories inside
Confined within the waning strands of time
Searching for those left undefined
To find the answers within this life

Push me beyond cerebral limits
Potential's there for the taking
Drifting through these blackened skies
Set forth upon my awakening

Cold and disillusioned with you
What do you offer?
Pain, self defeat, blacken my view
So be it, I'll take another

Life transformed to these memories inside
Confined within the waning strands of time
Searching for those left undefined
To find the answers within this life

[Lead: Michael Soininen]

I hear you in the wind
Lead me to my saviour
I stand before my former self
Shadowed now forever

Life transformed to these memories inside
Confined within the waning strands of time
Searching for those left undefined
To find the answers within this life

We are all destined to one demise
Take hold of what you believe in
Change is for the strengthened mind
Reasons to keep on breathing
