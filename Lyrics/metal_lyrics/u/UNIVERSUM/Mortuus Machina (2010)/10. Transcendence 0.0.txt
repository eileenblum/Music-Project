[Music: M. Soininen, Words: A. Soininen, M. Soininen, S. Murphy]

Wade through the pain
Still burns the same
Tiresome, so mundane
Take me away
Wash out the rage
Shattered and so alone

Glass like figures stare through the sphered windows
Passing with the light they they hold
That they hold on

Flames blaze through the darkness that follows in
Burning the creatures that roam inside, they're still alive

Questioning the dark unknown
This unnatural existence

This can't be avoided
The white sun draws me near
But will I reach it before gravity takes hold?

[Lead: Michael Soininen]

Descend into death

Now left behind in the dark
Should I fight or should I deny?
Once afraid, still unchanged
Distant now, fading life

Flames blaze through the darkness that follows in
Burning the creatures that roam inside, they're still alive

[Lead: Michael Soininen]

To await
The flame is dying now
Regret to late
Watch how this day will end
