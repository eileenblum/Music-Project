[Music: M. Soininen, Words: M. Soininen]

Plagued by senseless tragedy
All consuming pain
In the eyes of the other man
Killing is today

Just expect to walk away
I thought he would never be named
Descending on the very mistake
Decisions of fate, is mine for the taking

My delusions surround me
No longer a senseless dream
Are these the threads of my sanity?
It's a side of my emptiness
Blackened thoughts so far
Spare me as I'm the only son

Evil has delivered a changed man
A mind in blackness
Two point zero, in the darkness

My delusions surround me
No longer a senseless dream
Are these the threads of my sanity?
It's a side of my emptiness
Blackened thoughts so far
Spare me as I'm the only son

[Lead: Michael Soininen]

Just expecting to walk away
I thought I would never be named
Descending on the very mistake
Decide this fate; mine for the taking

My delusions surround me
No longer a senseless dream
Are these the threads of my sanity?
It's a side of my emptiness
Blackened thoughts so far
Spare me as I'm the only son

Devoid of light, it sees all
Devastation, make the final call
