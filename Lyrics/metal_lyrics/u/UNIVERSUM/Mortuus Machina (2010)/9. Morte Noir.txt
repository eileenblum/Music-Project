[Music: M. Soininen, Words: A. Soininen]

Can you hear demons crawl?
They're feeding on our flesh
A bite into the depths
We proudly wear the scars
Unrest again
Lost in a maze of thrashed nerves
And now unashamed, we've changed forever
We are the haters

So we've lost our way, now we will lose it all
Who is left standing when the black death rolls in?

Devour us all
A seascape of bones decayed
None will stand here as the black death rolls in

We push to reach our limits
And face the impossible rain
Pushing deep into the abyss
Towards our final decay...

Unearth the horrors
That lay beneath the ocean floor
Our ravaged frames for the feed
Few are left to honour
Today the skies are turning grey
Destruction left in your wake

So we've lost our way
Now we will lose it all
None left standing, devour us whole
A seascape of bones decayed
Enduring sleep in pain
None left standing, the black death rolls...

Unrest again
Lost in a maze of thrashed nerves
And now unashamed, we've changed forever
We are the haters

We've pushed to reach our limit
And faced the impossible rain
Dragged deep into the abyss
Towards our final decay...

So we've lost our way
Now we will lose it all
None left standing, devour us whole

A seascape of bones decayed
Enduring sleep, so grey
None will stand when black death rolls?

With so much to give and desire to share it all
And belief so strong the demons can't hold on
Rising fall, taken away
The feeble are left to crawl
Broken and made to crawl

Still we find ourselves so numb
Still we find ourselves so numb
