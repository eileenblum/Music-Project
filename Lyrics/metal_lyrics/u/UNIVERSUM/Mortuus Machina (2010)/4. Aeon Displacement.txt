[Music: M. Soininen, Words: A. Soininen, S. Murphy]

Enslaved to fear inside
Trapped in this life
The closing walls of time
Tainted transparency
A faltered mind of travesty

I walk the path with none by my side
I've failed to grasp the light

Tears flow from the eyes of pain
This vortex pulls me down

Left bleeding and trapped inside
A dark reminder of the sin I live
Falling, I've had too many chances
The judgement is called, now and I am sinking

Take me away
This fate, forever cursed
Don't leave me alone in my misery

A slave to fear inside
Trapped within these
Closing walls of time
Fading transparency
A faltered mind in travesty

A judgement of death determines my fate

[Lead: Paul Wardingham]

Embodied, a dark reckoning mind
Devolving  thoughts, fading in time
Falling supremacy
Shattered versions of reality

In this state of disarray
Of shadows and eternal flames
Distorted figures of humanity
Consumed by this fucking disease

Take me away
This fate, forever cursed
Don't leave me alone in my misery

Enslaved to fear inside
Trapped in this life
The closing walls of time
Tainted transparency
A faltered mind of travesty

Take me away
This fate, forever cursed
Don't leave me alone in my misery
Tears flow from the eyes of pain
This vortex pulls me down
