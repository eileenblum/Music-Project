Here lie the embers of a sun,
Light stolen by the tides of time.
The stepping stones of worlds beyond
That fade forgotten in our flight.

Abandoned dreamers left for dead,
The pilgrims' path has reached its end.
We turn our backs, untie the thread,
The exodus begins again.

Unlearned, the lessons of the past,
Quicksand foundations of our pride.
The pedestal on which we stand,
So monumental in decline.

Hear cries that echo now as one,
Defied creators long ignored.
Reap arrogance so idly sown
From soul-less generations born
