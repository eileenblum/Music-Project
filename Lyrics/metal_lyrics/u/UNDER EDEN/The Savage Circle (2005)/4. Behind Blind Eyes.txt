Behind blind eyes,
Synaptic silence.
Apocalypse
Eclipsing dawn.

Obscured by tears
Bled from inside,
The drowning dream
That comes to life
When we wake.

Behind blind eyes,
The spinal cord contortion
Is strangling and
Entangling life and death.

One whispered wish
Choked out at last.
Unbreathing,
Seething dread sets in.

Deceiving my senses,
Believing the lie.
Revealing, releasing
Through clenched eyes torn wide.

Behind blind eyes
Inflamed by fears,
Old scars defleshed.
Refresh the screaming dirge.

The hollowpoint
Hallucinations guide,
Dividing day and nightmare
Intertwined.

Never know
He light,
Too dim to show
The way.
Written red,
The path
A narrow line now.

So denied
The sight
That points the road
Ahead.
Deeper still,
Grows wide
To spiral down"

So alive,
The fire
That marks the sign
Below.
The embrace
So cold
Despite the flame.

The shadows fade
Like shedding skin.
The vortex drags
The sunlight back inside.

An inner storm
Released at last.
The tempest spins
Confined within the eye.
