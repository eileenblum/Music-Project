Born out of dust
Giving flesh to a whim.
The second son's
Sacrificial sin.

This mortal span is closing in.
Prime the next one to begin.
Eternity is taking seed
From a sleepless dream.
This mortal span is closing in"
Close to its end.

Thousands of lives
In the blink of an eye.
Celestial night
At the advent of time.

"And on the seventh night
A darker twilight fell.
Angels turned their burning eyes
As the serpent worked his spell.

"And on the seventh night,
As a newborn world turned
The victim race called Man
Was seduced and left to burn.

The sons of God put to the sword,
Hell's hunters heed the call to war.
Force-spawned chaotic demon breed
And locusts feed.

Leviathan, beneath the sea
Elusive, shapes infinity
And factors into human fate
With perfect hate.

Mining the stars
For the glimmer of life.
Point to the depths,
Testimony from the blind.

"And on the seventh night
A darker twilight fell.
Angels turned their burning eyes
As the serpent worked his spell.

"And on the seventh night,
As a newborn world turned
The victim race called Man
Was seduced and left to burn.
