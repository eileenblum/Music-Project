Most low gods
In hushed incantation
Rising up from the depths of the night.
Most low gods
Through greed and through malice
Are summoned forth to extinguish
The light.

Human souls are turned
In worship and fear of the darkness.
Sacrifice binding them deep in
The pit...
Mortal worlds burning
Damned for their sins of defiance
As ancient evils take wing in
The mist.

Existence turns to ashes
As it burns before my eyes.
Our Earthly Mother fades to grey
And the dying spirits rise.
In the midst of judgement
Comes a cleansing rain
To drown the last survivors,
Cold mercy for their pain.

Lies of the hypocrites,
Cries of the damned
Swept from this mortal veil
Like blood upon my hands.

Whispers of heretics,
Dark words of old
From dreaded prophecy
Bringing death untold.

Humankind is banished
In a fiery demise.
The heavens fall around me
As the lords of hell arise.
Peace and hope have failed
In this world of ours,
Where hate and greed prevail
Is a world full of war.

The master of the legions
Enthralled upon his throne.
For my sin of heresy
I live to burn alone.

Lies of the hypocrites,
Cries of the damned
Swept from this mortal veil
Like blood upon my hands.

Whispers of heretics,
Dark words of old
Now take form among us
The bloody end foretold.
