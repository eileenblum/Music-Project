[Lyrics: Karina Florencia Conicelli]

Up from above
They will see us all
Guiding us
There's no escape

Kingdoms of pilgrims
Exist no more
But history
Will immortalize...

Far beyond the sun and the sea...

For every being
There's a guardian
You will ask them
And they will hear...
They'll answer you...

Prayers to the wind,
So they could exist
The Creators of the first breath,
Hidden by memory

They want to return,
Recover what's their own,
When everything collapsed
And the empire fell apart

I want to find
The whereabouts
Where could they be?
The thread that keeps
The worlds unite
As one...

For every being
There's a guardian
You will ask them
And they will hear...
They'll answer you...

They'll answer you...
