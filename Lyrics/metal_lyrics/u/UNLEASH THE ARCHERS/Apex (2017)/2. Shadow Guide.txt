I wander aimlessly still reeling from the change
Waiting for a sign or for a spectre
That can guide me on my way
Often times a watcher waits for me
My days are passing under skies I cannot read

Until a silhouette wings silently above
Circling the ahead and giving me the sense that he's the one
A falcon cries, echoing inside of me and ushering the tide

Finally you found me

Shadow guide, you lead me to horror
Shadow guide, you harbour destiny

Nowhere to hide, dark wings enfolding over me
I can't escape, I can't defeat, shadow guide

Though I know you navigate me to the chains
Of the one who'll use me to do wrong
I can't help but follow your wake

Shadow guide, you lead me to horror
Shadow guide, you harbour destiny

Shadow guide, you lead me to horror
Shadow guide, you harbour destiny
