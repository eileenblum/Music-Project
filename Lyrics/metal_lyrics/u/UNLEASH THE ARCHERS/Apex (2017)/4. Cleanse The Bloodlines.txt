Here you are, you've finally come 
You're mine, at last! I've waited so long 
Listen well, this is why you are here 
I need you to find my sons 

Journey wide they're spread across the land
They will hide they know what I plan 
My sons were born for one purpose only 
Their blood my elixir of life 

Return them alive, I'll kill them myself
I'll open their throats and drink from their skulls 
The ritual is very precise 
Bring them to me before the planets align 

The altars wait in silence, an effigy
Soon their purpose divined 
Blood will run as rivers upon them 
The time has come to 

Cleanse the bloodlines, free me from the clutch of 
Death incarnate, my reign must never end 

Unearth my descendants, find them and bring them to me
Feed my insatiable lust for blood 

I can give what you've longed for your whole life 
Freedom from this earthly tie 
Know this in your heart of hearts 
Betray me and spend eternity as mine 

Cleanse the bloodlines, free me from the clutch of 
Death incarnate, my reign must never end
