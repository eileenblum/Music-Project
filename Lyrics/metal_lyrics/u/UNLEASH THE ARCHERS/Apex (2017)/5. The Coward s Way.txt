So now it has begun, seems easy enough
I haven't to go far away to find the eldest son
He cannot hide from me; his friends won't shield him now
It doesn't matter who you are your tower's coming down

Your ruin has arrived, politician's lives are like the tide
You had to know that I would come for you
Hear the Matriarch, she needs your heart, you know it's true

Fallen from on high, forsaken lies
You can't resist the chance to beg and scream
Out for mercy, I'll drag you out
The coward's way, down on your knees

Don't bother with the scheme, there's no beguiling me
You're just another job that's to be done before I'm free
Your time is at an end, enough with bargaining
Your seat of power is vacated for someone else

To hide the truth away,
To take all that there is, to never give, you're all the same

Fallen from on high, forsaken lies
You can't resist the chance to beg and scream
Out for mercy, I'll drag you out
The coward's way, down on your knees

Down on your knees, I'll drag you out

Fallen from on high, forsaken lies
You can't resist the chance to beg and scream
Out for mercy, I'll drag you out
The coward's way
Forfeit all you own, abandon hope
She's called you back; the altar waits for you
No time to waste, you cry in vain
I won't let you go; fight me no more
