To look up into the night's sky
To see the stars they are changed
To know a thousand years or more have passed, and I am still the same
This mountain hollow that keeps me in a suffocation embrace
A prison and a safe haven, it's always been this way

Lo, a new master calls me to awakening
I know this one brings the end
Far out beyond the darkness I've been living in
It's true, a whole new world awaits

Stellar constellations rise, lighting my way in the night
Once again revitalized, to roam; to never die

My path begins with the new dawn
A voice is calling my name
It always starts as whispering then manifest to a scream
I'm dawn to the creature that wakes me
Bound to them by the curse
My soul exists only to serve, a covenant of birth

Fear not the task ahead there's no escaping it
There's no good nor evil here

Stellar constellations rise, lighting my way in the night
Once again revitalized, to roam; to never die

Come to me, awakening
Follow my voice, come to me

Fear not the task ahead there's no escaping it
There's no good nor evil here

Stellar constellations rise, lighting my way in the night
Once again revitalized, to roam; to never die
