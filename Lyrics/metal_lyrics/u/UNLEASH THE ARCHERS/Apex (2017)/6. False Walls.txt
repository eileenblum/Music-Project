To the south there's a city, ruled by a serpent-tongue
Spinning his lies and tales, blinding everyone
When I come to end this tyrant, he spouts words of silken twine
Winding me in vapours, mystifying, clouding up my mind

Then I recall words of warning said by my master
Never allow for his enchantments to penetrate
Know his weakness is my strength; overcome this haze

Overlord your reign is at an end
Your false walls are crumbling within
Oppressor your spell has come undone
Defy no more, impostor, overlord

Once I see through the veil he has conjured out of dust
Trapping his followers in a world they cannot trust
Like a curtain hangs his doctrine, enslaving all who hear
I must destroy this web, free the people, alleviate their fear

As though a fog has been lifted, cries echo around us
And like his brother before him I feel no remorse
He will lie upon the altar, a well-deserving course

Overlord your reign is at an end
Your false walls are crumbling within
Oppressor your spell has come undone
Defy no more, impostor, overlord

You conjure your false walls
Impostor, you surround us
Your serpent tongue is enslaving everyone
Oppressor, overlord
Your doctrine, just vapours
Your lies are leading the lost
I will end you here
