This night my son, keep your eyes to the sky, against the black see their shadows for miles
They come with vengeance and hate in their hearts, itâs time, they fly, prepare
Thereâs no escape when they take to the air

So come on over, to the other side, where it is colder

[CHORUS:]
Hear tell of these wingless angels flight, escaping through the night
Racing over silent mountain sentries, soaring for their lives

Theyâve chosen their side there is no going back, and Heavenâs gates they are closing for good
So when they fight they will fight to the end, itâs time, unite, defend
And theyâll stand shoulder to shoulder with men

So come on over, to the other side, where you are stronger

[CHORUS]

Cast out and betrayed for fighting against His terror, broken by the pain but rising again and again
