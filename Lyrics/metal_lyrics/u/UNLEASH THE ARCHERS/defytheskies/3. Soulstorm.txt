There is a storm coming, I can feel it in my soul, watching the sky go dark as thunder speaks to me
Menacing clouds approaching, they will wrap us in the cold, tempest rising

[CHORUS:]
Electrify! Lightning spans the corners of my mind, abandon all control; release the power
Electrify! Arcing through my fingers, sparks will fly, overloaded itâs my final hour

There is no time for running, feel the static in the air, I canât delay the charge itâs growing constantly
Try to escape, Iâll find you, I am here and everywhere, tension building

[CHORUS]

Crushed and contorted, no more a human heart
If I embrace electric destiny, always an internal hurricane

[CHORUS]

Surging with the force, I can feel it, Iâll electrify!
