He can not eat, he can not sleep, he can not see that death is coming, I know thereâs nothing more I can do
In fits and dreams he speaks to me, he says these things beyond belief; I can not take his words as truth

He comes to say his piece...

I know heâs travelled so far to find me in this landscape, perilous and full of unknown treachery
And now heâs giving his life to tell me things I canât face, how could I betray his utter trust in me?

[CHORUS:]
And with his final breath he, imparts his vital prophecyâ¦
Carry on for your generation, you are the one to guide them all
Donât delay, your time has come, lead the way into a brighter dawn

I must prepare for the path before me, ever daunting, indemnify for my naivetÃ©
And I can no longer hide away pretending nothing, when the world is ending right in front of me

[CHORUS]

And to bring honour to his soul, I will accept this righteous role
This nameless prophet that could see, that which resides inside of me

Deep inside, I reconcile my fear
Sustain my sickening apathy for good
For the worthiest of men, but a promise escapes me
Wicked blood will run

[CHORUS]
