My fists will fly to seek the remedy
That festers sweet in fallacy
Tied to a stag and bound by hands and feet
Constricted, restless like a catapult
I see the red, my eyes are closed
Hung upside down amongst the starving wolves

[Chorus:]
Anger I'm yours, invade my heart like venom
Take all you find, seep in enslave my senses
Vacant of core, flood through my veins like poison
Fill me with fire, render this world defenceless

I've killed for less
I've killed for less, bitch

Abject it dragged me ragged, a host to utilize
This anger sharp and jagged, blind and unjustified
When all is lost and won, still it remains behind
Unfettered and free to run, This madness undefined

Pay for you sins
Pain, internal, guide my hand
Flee from this fight, make my stand

In hadal acres, and endless terrain of constant, this menace will not sleep
Abyss of tempest, a raging storm inside this, tenebrous chasm deep
This twisted ailment, a blazing force it drives me, malevolence without yield

No way of hiding from this treachery
A nebular menagerie
This avid feral beast inside of me
Submit the light and share the carnal need
Surrender mind and feed the greed 
Take up the knife and now at last concede

[Chorus]

What a way to kill
