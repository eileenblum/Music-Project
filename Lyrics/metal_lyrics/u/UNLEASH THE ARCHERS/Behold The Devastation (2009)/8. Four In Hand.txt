Sin and an aversion to right
Such things have become hallmarks to his existence
Character flaws don't exist
This hallowed cult must desist
This prophesizes their death
The world will burn, and you will embrace it

Evil rides in on Saracen sons, chore, tossing them in our midst
Demons, gifts from this giver of sin for ages of treachery
Feel them writhing into our skin, angels can't hear us now
Lean on habits that used to kill, feels good when we are one

Luxuria Lust
Gula Gluttony
Avaritia Greed
Acedia Sloth
Ira Wrath
Invidia Envy
Superbia Pride
Saligia Sin

Driving horses from the stables, deep within the flames of netherworlds of purgatory
Four in hand he rides among us, he won't stop as long as man is prone to hatred
Sorrows aside, he brings misery

From beneath the reins
Ascending, collecting, preparing for wielding pain
From beneath the reins

Stop, he is near, hold your heart in your hands
Feel the age old torture
Fly from the fear in your soul, how you know
He is right behind you
Look to the sky, dark will come, he will rise
See his chariot flaming
Sin will revive, stranglehold, drown in vice
Feel the pain of his pride

Still hearts don't beat
Black death repeats
[x2]

Feel his presence, one you can't forget
Look to the horizon, see his silhouette
