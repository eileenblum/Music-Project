Burn me alive, scorched earth, burnt souls
The carcasses rot, torments behold
Bear witness

Hide my eyes from the light of the dawning eternal
Heat from the earth sears a whole through the story I tell
Wonder why all the prophesies foretold nothing of this abyss

I am weathered commencement severed 
Clear the waste, renew
I am slowly surviving judgement
Day by day I change
I am better, the future's shepherd
I rebuild the age

This is hell on earth, hell on earth
Two seconds till you asphyxiate, seconds till you asphyxiate
This is hell on earth, hell on earth
Seconds till you die by my, seconds till you die by my hand
Die by my hand, die by my hand

Even when our life seems over

I will reign supreme, let the earth redeem
For it's past failures
This I can promise you; the world just won't be the same
[x2]

Can't deny that the end of the world is finally come
I stand alone in a pool of humanity's blood
Hunger for life as I knew it, know this, I am the last one left

I am weathered commencement severed 
Clear the waste, renew
I am slowly surviving judgement
Day by day I change
I am better, the future's shepherd
I rebuild the age

This is hell on earth, hell on earth
Two seconds till you asphyxiate, seconds till you asphyxiate
This is hell on earth, hell on earth
Seconds till you die by my hand
