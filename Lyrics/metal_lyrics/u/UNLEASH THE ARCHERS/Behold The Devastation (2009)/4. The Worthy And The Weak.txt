[Chorus:]
Silently, the plague consumes all
Daring the worthy and the weak
Equally, equally

To turn hands on brothers
Near and far

These beasts just keep on rising, brought forward from the dead
as soldiers we'll keep fighting on
They're eating as fast as we can run, this feasting already begun
Step forward and be turned
This season of slaughter has dawned on us all, now we've become
Horrors of the night, horrors of the night
Dragging our bodies, though endless death, now we've become
Horrors of the night, horrors of the night

[Chorus]

Though I trudge through weeds, bleeding on to me, I stand redeemer
[x2]

Feeding on the brains of the ones we've left behind
Cleaning up the remains of a world that we've defiled

So sew me a soul and throw me aside
So sew me a soul and throw me aside
Tell me this is what you've always wanted

[Chorus]

Cerebral feast
The undead rise
