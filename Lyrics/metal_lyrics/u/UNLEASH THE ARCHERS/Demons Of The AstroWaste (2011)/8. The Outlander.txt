[CHORUS:]
Hear him calling out 
Don't be a fool, cast away this solitude 
Behold the wisdom which reveals the truth 
Cruel twist of fate, or foretold destiny 
Welcome the power it is yours to take 

Out of the sun, a figure comes 
Somehow he knows of everything I've done 
Time to arise, apologize 
He leads me on towards the brightening skies 

[CHORUS]

Nowhere to turn, dishonoured 
Pulled me from the fire where I laid to burn 
He sails away, break of day 
Knowing his words forever resonate 

[CHORUS x2]
