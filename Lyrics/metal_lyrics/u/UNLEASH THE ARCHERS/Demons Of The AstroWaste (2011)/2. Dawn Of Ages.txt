Begin our journey back through mists of time 
As we arrive at the dawn of mankind 
Engulfed in hatred, the world is at war 
A sword is made to bring peace evermore 

[CHORUS:]
Created by the nobles one 
Raised by champions, Great Defender 
Assailed by ravenous fury 
Conquered and eclipsed by evil splendour 

Now man he cowers in fear and in shame 
It holds a power which can not be named 
What once held virtue is wicked instead 
And none can hinder it's thirst for the dead 

[CHORUS]

Over the mountains and the trees 
Through valleys and the seas 
We stand united on the plain 
Mount up the barricade, or meet the end 
Against an army of us all 
There is no chance we'll fall, hear the call 

Through smoke and ashes stands one mortal man 
Alone triumphant, the sword in his hand 
The worlds destruction at last is complete 
A tale of anguish that's doomed to repeat 

[CHORUS x2]
