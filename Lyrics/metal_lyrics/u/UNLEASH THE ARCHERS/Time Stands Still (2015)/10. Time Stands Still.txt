[Chorus:]
Abandon this sun
Whatâs done is done
And time will go on and on
It wonât be long
We will come
And time will go on and on

Hold on, though it seems that the end 
it is now upon us
Fear not the fall
Rise up, we will find thereâs a way 
For us to carry on
For once and for all

Fortuneâs favor is ours now
Ride to glory

Stand with us, be the one that will lead them 
When the night is over, answer the call
Rebuild, history can only be written 
By the victors, and we will write it all
Break through, when the walls have fallen 
And the ash has lifted, light will come
Gather now, we have risen on the winds 
of our transformation, we finally have won

[Chorus]
