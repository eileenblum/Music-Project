Come on
Youâre the one that brought us here
I canât believe what you say
Tell me youâre kidding
Hell no, youâre not gonna leave us stranded here
No way, youâve ruined everything
Canât you see weâre lost without you
Though we hate to say
There's so much at cost
You know itâs true
And you can only take

Oh, weâve heard it all before
And now weâll hear it once again

Take your cut and go
Leave us out in the cold
You can never get away
Not this time

[Chorus:]
Going down fighting [4x]

If you never want us to return again
Thatâs fine with me
Not gonna stand for thievery
I know, you probably think that
Youâre gonna get away with your little game
But rules are made for breaking
Canât you see weâre lost
There's so much at cost

Oh weâve heard it all before
And now weâll hear it once again
Stop this lying to yourself
Youâre crying to an empty floor
And we are not to blame
Stop denying

[Chorus 3x]
