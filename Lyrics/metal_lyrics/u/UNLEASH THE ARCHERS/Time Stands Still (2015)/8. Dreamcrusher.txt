Come; follow your soul, onto hope
Heed not the words others throw
For the heart is the strongest of all
Only fear can defeat what is right
And you canât let it swallow your mind

But I donât want to feel
that weâve wasted our lives
When weâre holding our hearts in our hands
And the terror it looms in our sights

Tomorrow this fight will tear us from the sky
To follow the path to the rest of our lives
Someday weâll find the truth of whatâs been said
Find a way to reconcile the lies weâre fed

This fight is noble, can't afford our freedom
Not like the ones who can't admit what we all know

For the fallen must arise, a phoenix from the fire
Carried on the wind, this new crusade begins

No more chains, I refuse to play the games
Never kneel again
To words others say
When they tell us how to be
Find the strength to break the lines of fate

Can you feel it lurking deep within
I can feel it, striving to begin
Can you feel it something has to give
I can feel it rising up again

[Chorus]
Go on have your share
No one can stand in your way
Who said nothingâs fair
I say nowâs the time to take

When the dust settles
The silence brings relief
From all the constant cries
of entitlement and greed

Can you dare to stand apart
And finish what you start
United on the path, rise up and resist

Through bone and ash
I see the light in the eyes
Broken inside, Dreamcrusher
We won't go, with the dead
All we know, never said

Kill the noise, raise your voice

Can you feel it lurking deep within
I can feel it, striving to begin
Can you feel it something has to give
I can feel it rising up again

[Chorus 2x]

This world is a Dreamcrusher
