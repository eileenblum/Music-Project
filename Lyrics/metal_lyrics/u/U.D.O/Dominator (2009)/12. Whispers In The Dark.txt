[Kaufmann, Dirkschneider / Kaufmann, Dirkschneider, Wienhold]

The silent times they are the worst -- so still and unforgiving.
You're all alone, you fear the words, the end and the beginning.
They're calling you, they call your name, and then you've got to answer.
Is nowhere safe, no way to hide, beware the devil's chancer.

[Chorus:]
Inside the spark of pestilence is hiding in us all,
And when you hear the evil words you're ready to be called.
Here they come, have their fun twisting minds -- whispers in the dark.
So beware, just take care -- whispers in the dark

A look that kills a breath that hates
Takes over on the inside
A game that thrills the open gate to hell and back a joyride
A visit to the underworld -- an easy way to fool you
And when you don't know where to go: a wrong turn -- and they'll doom you

[Chorus x2]
