My Bleeding Heart
No Way Theyâre Gonna Take
All That Away From Me
My Bleeding Heart
No Way Are They Gonna Try
It Screams For Right And Justice
It Screams For Us To See
The World Is Our Party
Itâs There For You And Me
So Listen To Our Story
And You Will Understand
The Way Leads Us To Glory
Together Hand In Hand
My Bleeding Heart â¦
Stand Up And Be Honoured
And Join The Company
Raising Up The Colours
To Be All We Can Be
We Are All Together
Together We Are One
Longing For The Future
The Partyâs Just Begun
Get Up And Fight
Weâre Gonna Do It Right
Get Up And Scream
And Shout It Out For Real
My Bleeding Heart â¦
My Bleeding Heart
And Itâs Always Gonna Be A Part Of Me
My Bleeding Heart
Only Way Itâs Gonna Be
