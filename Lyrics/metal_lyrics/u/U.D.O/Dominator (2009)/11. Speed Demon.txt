And Petrol In Their Veins
Fire In Their Bodies
Vibrations In The Air

Headlights Screaming Carnage â Synchronicity
Metal Cage Corrosified â His Reality
Out Of All Control He Is
The Speed Demon
Speed Demon â Ready For The Race
Maximise The Traction For
The Speed Demon
Speed Demon â He Will Choose The Ace
Red Zone Revolutions
Millions Of Octane
Faster Is The Master
Disaster Is His Name
Chequered Flags Are Lowered
Overdriven Speed
Nothing For The Coward
Itâs All You Ever Need
