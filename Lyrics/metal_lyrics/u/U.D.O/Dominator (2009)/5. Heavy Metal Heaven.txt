I Am Untouchable
I Am Invincible
I Am The Lord Of All The Visible
I Am The King Of Kings
So Touch My Iron Wings
I Am The Cure So Kiss My Metal Ring
So Hold Me High Up Unto The Sky
To A Heavy Metal Heaven
Through The Storm And Sea
I Will Set You Free
With An Ever Burning Heart
My Golden Crown
Never Let You Down
Youâre In Heavy Metal Heaven
With A Screaming Sound
We Shout Aloud
You Will Rise Up To The Stars
You Have To Feed Me Now
You Have To Heed Me Now
You Have To Hail Me â
Bow Your Head To Vow
Iâve Got An Eye On You
An Iron Sign On You
I Am The Metal God Thatâs Over You
