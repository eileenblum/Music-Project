[Kaufmann, Dirkschneider]

Doctor Death Is On The Ward
Searching For His Prize
Body Bags Are Cold As Ice
Screams Cut Through The Night

Through The Bars The Madman Sings
That Permeate His Sight
It Drips Away With Holy Thanks
And Radiated Light

Snip The Blood Line
Cut The Veins
Chop It Real Fine
Hack The Brains

Donât Deal With â Donât Heal With
Donât Freak With Dr. Death
Donât Trust Him â Combust Him
Disgusting Dr. Death

Operate Unparalysed
No Mercy In His Eyes
Bodies Are Dehydrolysed
No Chance To Testify

With Shining Deadly Instruments
A Torturer Of Pain
A Sick And Bloody Tournament
Heâs Mental And Insane
