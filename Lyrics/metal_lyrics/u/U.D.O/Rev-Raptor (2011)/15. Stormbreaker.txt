[Bonus track]
[Kaufmann, Dirkschneider]

Living With The Pack
Never On The Rack
Iâm Higher Than An Eagle In The Sky

Lightning On My Back
The Sky Is Turning Black
Iâm Burning With The Fire That Collides

And When My Time Is Over There Is No Return For Me
Youâll Find Me In The Elements â And Finally Iâm Free

Stormbreaker â Stormbreaker
Iâm Running With The Forces Of The Night
Stormbreaker â Stormbreaker
Iâm Rolling With The Thunder And The Light

Better You Beware
Thereâs Static In The Air
Thereâs Nothing That Will Stop The Flow Of Fear

Fear Becoming Storm
Hail And Rain Below
The Centre Of The Eye Is Rushing Near
