[Kaufmann, Wienhold, Dirkschneider / Kaufmann, Dirkschneider]

Donât Wanna Read Between The Lines
I Know Whatâs Good, I Know Whatâs Fine
I Know What Makes Me Feel Just Right
Donât Wanna Have An Endless Fight

And I Know â Whatâs Right
I Know Whatâs Right
And I Know â Whatâs Wrong
I Know Whatâs Wrong

I Give As Good As I Get
I Give As Good As I Get

I Know What Time To Lay My Head
I Know The Answers Best Unsaid
And No Decree Can Make Me See
Another Way Of Being Me

I Know The Way To Cross A Street
I Even Know To Trick Or Treat
I Know Whatâs Right â I Know Whatâs Wrong
You Better Listen Or Youâre Done

I Know Thereâs No One Same As Me
I Am Unique â Iâve Got To Be
This Is The Way â I Am For Real
The Only Way For Me To Feel
