[Kaufmann, Dirkschneider]

We Gotta Drink Some More
Until We Hit The Floor
Weâre Gonna Go Rocking Wild

Weâre Gonna Blitz This Town
With Our Heavy Sounds
Weâll Have A Crazy Time Tonight

What Do You Want â Wanna Spend Your Cash
Spend Your Night In A Headlong Crash

Raise âEm High For The True Born Winners
Here We Stand And Here We Fall
Raise It Up For The Midnight Sinners
All For One And Another For All

Weâre Gonna Stare You Down
We Are The Loud And Proud
Weâre Gonna Sow The Seeds Tonight

Weâre Gonna Roll And Ride
Weâll Blow Your Underside
We Got Our Heads Up For The Fight

Crazy Nights And Red Light Warnings
Tough And Rough On Hazy Mornings
