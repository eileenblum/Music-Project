[Bonus track]
[Kaufmann, Dirkschneider]

We Live Assault And Battery
We Donât Fucking Care
Heavy Metal Liberty
Hands Up In The Air

Soldiers On The Battleground
With Canons Left And Right
Armour Plated Light And Sound
Ready For The Fight

You Are Heavy â Metal â W: O: A
So Come On Rock Me â Rock Me â W:O:A
You Are Heavy â Metal â W: O: A
So Come On Rock Me â Rock Me â W:O:A

Vengeance That Youâre Screaming For
The Highway Leads To Hell
Paranoid Hysteria
The Ace Of Spades As Well

We Welcome You With Open Arms
Youâre Answering The Call
You Heavy Metal Maniacs
Your Balls Against The Wall
