[Kaufmann, Gianola, Dirkschneider / Kaufmann, Dirkschneider]

Electric And Dissected
Iâm Taking It All On
Fulfilling All Your Wishes
The Gaming Has Begun

Dismembered And Remembered
The Winner He Will Fall
Youâve Got Just What Youâve Asked For
Youâre Under My Control

I Am The Man Who Is Eager To Take You Apart
I Am The One Who Will Send You To Hell And Beyond

Pain Man â Writing All The Rules
Pain Man â Will Not Suffer Fools
Pain Man â Alive And Demonized
Pain Man â Sharp And Razor Like

Directed And Suspected
The Common Tools Of Trade
Forsaken And Mistaken
Decisions Have Been Made

Draining And Debraining
Youâre Choosing Up The Mode
Confess You Really Like It
Youâll Like The Overload
