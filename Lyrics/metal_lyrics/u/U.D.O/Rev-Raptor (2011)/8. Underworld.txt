[Kaufmann, Dirkschneider]

Iâll Wipe Away Your Tears
If You Kiss My Frozen Smile
My Soul Is On A Voyage
Aflame With Golden Light

The Guardians Of The Dark Land
Will Kneel As I Pass By
And Guide Me On My Journey
To The Land Of Ever-Night

Dressed In Mortal Finery
The Coin Placed On My Lips
Iâll Meet The Final Referee
The Ferrymanâs Been Tipped

Give Thanks For All The Mysteries
Thatâs Why Iâm Not Afraid
Iâm Headed For The Underworld
The Helmsman Has Been Paid
Although Iâm Cold Of Body
And Though Iâm Not Alive
Iâll Watch You All There Down On Earth
Youâll Run But You Canât Hide

So Put Away The Memories
A Life Against All Odds
A Shining Dream Will Satisfy
The Payment To The Gods

Shadows Form In Darkness
I Hear The Beckoning
Those Who Fell Before Me
The Final Welcoming
