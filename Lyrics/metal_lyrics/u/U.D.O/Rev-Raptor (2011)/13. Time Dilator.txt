[Bonus track]
[Kaufmann, Dirkschneider]

It Was A Deadly Night â A Time Of Fright
Ho Ho Ho Ho
I Had A Time Machine â A Shining Dream
Ho Ho Ho Ho
A Cosmic Stream â A Daring Scheme
In Space And Time â The Futureâs Mine

Forward With The New Adventure
Centuries Pass By
A Time Warp Through The Universe
A Case Of Do Or Die

Time Dilator â Space Inflator
World Creator â Protected For The Flight
(Beat The Speed Of Light)

Arriving Blind â Whatâs On My Mind
Ho Ho Ho Ho
The Here And Now â No Matter How
Ho Ho Ho Ho

The Senses Shocked â The Travel Locked
The Past Is Blocked â The Clock Has Stopped
