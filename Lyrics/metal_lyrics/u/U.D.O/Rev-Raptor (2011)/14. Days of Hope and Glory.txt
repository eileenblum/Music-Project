[Kaufmann, Dirkschneider]

When I Was A Child
The Whole World Looked So Wild
Oh Oh â So Wild
Then I Was A Boy
And Discovered New Toys
Oh Oh â The Joy

Wanna Get It Out â Gotta Get It Out
This Is My Tale â These Were The Times Of My Life
Running With The Pack â Never Turning Back
Thanks To You All â Wonât Get âEm Out Of My Mind

The Days Of Hope And Glory
And Nights Of Solitude
Donât Ask Me Whatâs The Story
Thereâs Nothing There For You

Then I Was A Youth
On The Hunt For The Truth
Oh So Uncouth
Adrift On A Blue Ocean
So Far And So Wide
Far Far And Wide

Now I Am A Man
Still A Child â Deep Inside
Deep Deep Inside
I Wandered Far And Wide
In The Dark And The Light
The Black And The White
