[Kaufmann, Dirkschneider]

Just Give Me A Reason
And Iâll Put You Down
Youâll Never Get Up
Youâll Be Deep Underground

Youâre Like A Dog In A Manger
Youâre Sickly With Sin
Youâre Messing With Danger
Thatâs Where Iâm Coming In

Donât Count Your Chances
Your Chances Are None
Donât Make No Advances
Iâve Only Begun

I Am The Leatherhead â Leatherhead
I Am Acoming â Leatherhead
Donât Say Anything Or Iâm Gonna Come Around

You Think Youâre The Tough Guy, Hah
Well, Iâm From The Streets
I Come From The Wrong Side
Wild Animals Meet

Iâll Kick Out Your Daylight
Thatâs Gonna Be Fun
Iâm A Twenty-Four Carat
Iâm A Son Of A Gun

[Bridge]

I Am The Leatherhead â Leatherhead
I Am Aflame â Leatherhead
Leatherhead â Thatâs My Name â Leatherhead
Donât Be Making Waves Or Iâm Gonna Cut You Down

I Am The Leatherhead â Leatherhead
I Am Aflame â Leatherhead
Leatherhead â Thatâs My Name
I Am The Leatherhead â Leatherhead
I Am On Fire â Leatherhead
Donât You Make A Move âCause Iâm The Guy From Central Evil
Donât You Gimme Lip And Donât You Make A Sound
