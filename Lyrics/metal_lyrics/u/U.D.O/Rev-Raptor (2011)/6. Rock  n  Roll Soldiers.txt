[Kaufmann, Dirkschneider]

Iâm No Mr. Minute
Iâm No Mr. Clean
Iâm No Mr. Nice Guy
Still Dirty And Mean

So Donât Try To Cross Me
Donât Put Me Down
Alive And Still Kickinâ
Iâll Be Around

There Is No Reason To Stop
And I Will Never Give Up
I Am A Master Of My Destiny
I Am A Diamond In Rough
Some Times Had It Tough
Never Surrender Or Die

âCause We Are Rockânâroll Soldiers â Weâll Bring It On
Rockânâroll Soldiers â Fighting It On
âCause We Are Rockânâroll Soldiers â Giving It All
Rockânâroll Soldiers â The Fireâs Still On

Iâve Never Been Beaten
Donât Know How To Lose
Iâve Never Been Eaten
Itâs My Time To Chose

Iâve Never Known Worry
Iâd Spit In Its Face
Iâve Never Said Sorry
Respect And Disgrace
