[Kaufmann, Gianola, Dirkschneider / Kaufmann, Dirkschneider]

Reach Back To The Hidden Past
Not There For All To See
Itâs Only With The Victory
Who Writes The History

Whole Nations May Be Slaughtered
Has Been Reality
Intriguing The Survivors
The Truth Has Been Deceived

The Truth Is Always Possible To Fail
The Truth Is Simply Just A Fairy Tale

Of Victory â Fairy Tales Of Victory
Fairy Tales Of Victory

And When They Try To Tell You
Whatâs Behind The Act
Impossible To Filter
The Fiction From The Fact

State Run Propaganda
Feeding You The Lies
Not Knowing Where Youâre Going
Loyalty May Die
