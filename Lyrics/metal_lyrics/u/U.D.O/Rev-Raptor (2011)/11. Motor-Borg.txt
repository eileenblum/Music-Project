[Kaufmann, Dirkschneider]

Here He Comes
Thundering Hot
Motorizing Speeder

Fast And Loud
Hard And Proud
Supersonic Wheeler

Only Join The Circus
When You Know That You Can Win
Only Join The Madness
When Youâre Breaking Your Way In

Here Comes The Reaper â The Creeper
The Cyber-Lord Redeemer
Here Comes The Rider â Decider
The Motor-Borg Defiler

Heaven And Hell
Is What He Lives
Dirty Tricks To Master

Rough Salvationâs
What He Gives
Heading For Disaster

Connections Burn And Circuits Fry
Lifeâs A Bitch And Then You Die
