Enter the land of the iceman
A place where the sun never sets
Where the vains of the land are strong and crystal clear
Under the spell of darkness
The roots of the land grow deep
And the sight of the eagle soaring on the wing

Eternal nation - for evermore
A proud creation - what we're fighting for

When you're riding the sky so high
Immortal, wild and free
Cast your eyes to the far and near
Over oceans never seen

When you're riding the sky so high
Your glory will be done
And your hearts are open wide
In the land of the midnight sun

The whispering sound of the mountains
The howling of the seas
If you listen very closely you will hear

Stand by the stones of the shadows
In a kingdom cold and white
Where the halls of the Gods are lit by a million suns
