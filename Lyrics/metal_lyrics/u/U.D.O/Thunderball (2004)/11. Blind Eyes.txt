Nothing - is easy
Don't play the part of the fool
Told me - didn't listen
I know I played it too cool

This is how I should be
Turn the key and be free
A turn around - don't play the game
Better off you will be

Don't walk around with your blind eyes
This game is over to me
Don't walk around with your blind eyes
It's so important to see

Wanting - needing
It was hard - it was real
Maybe - sometime
You'll get back what you need
