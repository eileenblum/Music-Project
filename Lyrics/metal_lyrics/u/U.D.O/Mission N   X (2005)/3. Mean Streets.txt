For God's sake - you're just like a brother
For God's sake - not like any other
For God's sake - you're not just another man
For God's sake - there's no way of knowing
For God's sake - there's no way of showing
For God's sake - it's not just another crime
Down in the streets - it's just dirty and mean
Down in the streets - we're just living in fear
Down in the streets - we're gonna burn and fry
'cause we're living in mean streets
Mean streets
We're living in mean streets
Mean streets
For God's sake - we can't keep a going
For God's sake - we reap what we are sowing
For God's sake - it's not just another time
For God's sake - another dead brother
For God's sake - they're all motherfuckers
For God's sake - there's no way to heal the blind
Down in the streets - dirty and mean
Down in the streets - living in fear
Down in the streets - we're gonna burn and fry
Down in the streets - we're gonna take you high
