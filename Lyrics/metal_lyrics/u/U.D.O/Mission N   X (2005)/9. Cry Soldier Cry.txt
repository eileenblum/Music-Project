Cold wind in the morning
A telegram arrives
Arriving with no warning
Another mother cries
Husbands, sons and brothers
Hailed the call to war
Blinded by the others
The promise - one for all
What's it all in aid of
Obeying the command
Cold and tired and hungry
Dying for some land
Why don't you cry, soldier, cry
Another letter - you should know better
Cry, soldier, cry
There will be sorrow - until tomorrow
So cry, soldier, cry
The fear and all the sadness
Of what it has become
In this world of madness
Another soldier gone
Salute the highest honour
The folding of the flag
Finally the end is
Another bodybag
And all the time your comrades
Their backs against the wall
A band of brothers fighting
One by one they fall
