[Words: Dirkschneider, Wienhold]

I'm a pit bull
Well I'm a shotgun
I'm a ten ton truck loaded down with TNT
I'm a missile
Well I'm a tiger
I'm a midnight, hellcat, bastard, s.o.b.

Holy Moses
Holy smoke
Everything I've been
I am what you will regret
Cause I'm the king of mean

I'm a chainsaw
I am lightning
The hammer of hell to take your life away
I'm a bad dog
I'm a crosshair
I'm the axe that's come to terminate your day

[Repeat Chorus]

I'll devastate you to the wasteland
You're riding on the devil's tail
My heat is gonna make you melt down
I know you're guaranteed to fail

[Repeat Chorus]
