[Music &amp; Words: Dirkschneider, Wienhold]

Hard and loose, this is the life I choose
I own the higher ground
Life can be a bitch
Sometimes cannot be fixed
Rolling on, like a wheel

Waste of time, some are broken
Hard and tough, no fantasy
You and I - you broke in two
I've got you under - take the lead

Let me bite you - iron hard
Let me bite you - straight to your heart

Don't take the devil's bite
So we can stay together
Don't take the devil's bite
So we can live forever
Don't take the devil's bite
So we can fight together
Don't take the devil's bite - no devil's bite

What you do, sometimes it must be true
It's up to you
Told you it's a bitch, time to burn the bridge
So let me bow, that's the deal
