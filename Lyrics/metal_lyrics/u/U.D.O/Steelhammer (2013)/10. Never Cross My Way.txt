[Music &amp; Words: Dirkschieider, Wienhold]

Just in time - I realised
Your words - not true
Everything or nothing
It was hard for me to do

What I decided - not forever
You - for me is history
You have twisted me - talking to a wall
Just keep away from me

So if you ever cross my way
If you ever cross my way
So if you ever cross my way
I won't be hiding - hiding away from you

In the morning when I wake up
My mind is full of hate
But nothing lasts forever
For you I stay awake

I was the crown - you are the poison
Like a shadow - hanging over me
Thrown away the key - just keep away from

[Repeat Chorus]
