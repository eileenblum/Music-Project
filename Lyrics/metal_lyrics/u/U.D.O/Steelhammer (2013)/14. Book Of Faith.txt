[Music &amp; Words: Dirkschneider, Wienhold]

There was a time - without belief
The world was lost - and not in shape
There was a need
For a preacher or a priest
To fill their dreams and hopes

The promised land - of milk and honey
The day did come - the curtain called
By blinded light and trumpet call
They came and saw
The book of faith

So read your book of faith
You will understand
So read the book of faith
You hold it in your hand
So read the book of faith
You'll see the glory land
So read the book of faith

Now the time has come - if you believe
Now the world is in your hand - you got the sign
You've paid your price
Now take your honey and leave
You see my eyes - it's no surprise
Read the book of faith

[Repeat Chorus]

It's not the final end
