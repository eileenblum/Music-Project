[Music &amp; Words: Dirkschneider, Wienhold]

Open up and ram it down ya
The penny's dropped, and gone inside ya
The scales have fallen from your eyes
The die is cast, you're in my sights

You can stay with me
Stay on safer ground
What you wanna do, you wanna fly

Back to my kind of medicine
It's what you want
Take my medicine
Making you strong
So take my medicine
It's a heavy pill
Take my medicine	Â»
You got the thrill

Take a bite of what I got ya
Bite down hard, you cannot break it
In your head, yes you'll be mine
Heartbeat searching for a life

[Repeat Bridge]
[Repeat Chorus]
