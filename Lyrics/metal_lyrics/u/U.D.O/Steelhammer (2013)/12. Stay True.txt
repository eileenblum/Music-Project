[Music &amp; Words: Dirkschneider, Wienhold]

I've moved some mountains
I'm telling you
I've crossed the rivers
Just to be with you
I'm boiling metal
I am your sin
I am your nemesis
I change you from within

I fill you up
With everything you need
I am your chariot - with speed

Stay true - to you
I see your hungry eyes
It's you - stay true
No need to roll the dice
Stay true - to you
I feed your hungry eyes
Stay true - do you
Stay true - to you

I burn the heavens
I'll let ya know
Across the nation
Out to bring you hell
A target power
I've pulled the pin
I'll be your genesis
And play the bloody game
