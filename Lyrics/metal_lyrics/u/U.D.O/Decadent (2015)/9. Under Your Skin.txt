I hate the way â that you turn up
I hate the way â how you look
Youâre telling lies â of your life
Donât forget I have the book

You always talk â with two faces
I always had the solid truth
You are a rip off and a liar
What did you do with all the loot

Your stories have been blown to pieces
Youâre not protected anymore
All you think about is ego
You are rotten to the core

Iâm like a needle â under your skin
Iâm your parasite â under your skin
Like a needle â under your skin
With all my might

How did the cheating come so easy
How can you sleep with all the lies
How did you fool all those people
You are Jekyll and Hyde

Your stories have been blown to pieces
Youâre not protected anymore
All you think about is ego
You are rotten to the core

Iâm like a needle â under your skin
Iâm your parasite â under your skin
Like a needle â under your skin
With all my might

Iâm like a needle â under your skin
Iâm your parasite â under your skin
Like a needle â under your skin
With all my might
