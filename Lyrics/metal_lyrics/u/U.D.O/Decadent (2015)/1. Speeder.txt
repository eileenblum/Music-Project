Switch on the power
Screaming fast
Lungs are burning â sucking in the dust
Like a freebird
Flying high
Tearing up the atmosphere - ripping up the sky

Itâs faster than the light
You better step aside
The speeder of the night

No way to stop it
Out of control
It has no limits â I want it all
High as a fever
Extreme and hot
Terrifies your braincells â it never stops

Itâs faster than the light
You better step aside
The speeder of the night

Speeder â deadlier then all
Speeder â like a thunderstorm
Speeder â like a wrecking ball
Speeder â faster then you all

Redline the hour
Coming fast
Countdown to zero â like a lightning blast

A supernova
Radiates
A thunderwall â itâs coming in your face

Itâs faster than the light
You better step aside
The speeder of the night

Speeder â deadlier then all
Speeder â like a thunderstorm
Speeder â like a wrecking ball
Speeder â faster then you all

Speeder

Speeder
