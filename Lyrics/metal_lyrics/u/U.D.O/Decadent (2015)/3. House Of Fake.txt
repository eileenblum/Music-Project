You are the bastard thatâs behind the mask
You are the lying living proof
You are the bad dog bites the hand
You wouldnât recognize the truth
I burn you down â to the ground

You are the clown like all the rest
I'd like to flush you down the tube
I smell you like a sewer rat
Youâre always fucking up the rules

I burn you down to the ground

Weâre living in a house of fake
What you mean
Heâs done enough to play the game
What you see
I wanna scream I wanna shout
What you feel
This time I burn him to the ground

You are the master of the war machine
Evidence is blinded by your truth
So take away this masquerade
You are nothing without us

I burn you down to the ground

Weâre living in a house of fake
What you mean
Heâs done enough to play the game
What you see
I wanna scream I wanna shout
What you feel
This time I burn him to the ground

IÂ´m gonna break the spell
And send you right to hell
And take away this fucking chain

ItÂ´s time for you to run
Your crimes have been undone
And now the change has just begun

Weâre living in a house of fake
What you mean
Heâs done enough to play the game
What you see
I wanna scream I wanna shout
What you feel
This time I burn him to the ground

Weâre living weâre living
What you see
In a house of fake
Weâre living weâre living
What you see
Weâre living weâre living
What you see
In a house of fake
Weâre living weâre living
What you see
