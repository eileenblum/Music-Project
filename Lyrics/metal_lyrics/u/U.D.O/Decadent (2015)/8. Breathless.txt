Itâs totally wasted
Letâs bring it down
This road is hectic
Iâd rater take my time

Weâre going faster than the world should be
Itâs going out of control
Iâm sick of wasting energy
I need to feed my soul

We got to stop at this station
Jump off this ride
Itâs all bad sensations
Donât apologize

We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cosâ we are restless in the mind
We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cosâ we are crazy in the mind
Getting back the fire inside

Wasted and senseless
Feet on the ground
You just accept it
Or do you wannaâ drown

Like a bullet blowing up your head
The price of being bad
You better watch your lazy back
Before it drives you mad

We got to stop at this station
Jump off this ride
Itâs all bad sensations
Donât apologize

We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cosâ we are restless in the mind
We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cosâ we are crazy in the mind
Getting back the fire inside

How you gonna taste it
When all you do is waste it
Itâs all for you
All for you
How you gonna make it
When all you do is break it
Itâs all for you
All for you

We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cosâ we are restless in the mind
We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cosâ we are crazy in the mind

We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cosâ we are restless in the mind
We are so breathless all the time
So breathless
Cosâ we are crazy in the mind
Getting back the fire inside
