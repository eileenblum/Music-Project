You know your time has come
Another life begun
You took the key out of the door

So leave your past behind
Because you freed your mind
You found the meaning of life

Thereâs no more fear â to start from here

You cannot cheat the time
You have to say goodbye
Just leave the old days behind

Donât look back on life
Then you will realise
It will be better than before

Thereâs no more fear â to start from here

Rolling the dice itâs the meaning of life
Until your number will be called
Just take your chance till the end of the dance
This journey leads you to the light
Into the light

Donât be afraid to lose
Was just another move
Into a new way of life

Another highway grows
Like a river flows
You read the signs of life

Thereâs no more fear â glad to be here

Rolling the dice itâs the meaning of life
Until your number will be called
Just take your chance till the end of the dance
This journey leads you to the light
Into the light

Rolling the dice itâs the meaning of life
Until your number will be called
Just take your chance till the end of the dance
This journey leads you to the light

Rolling the dice itâs the meaning of life
Until your number will be called
Just take your chance till the end of the dance
This journey leads you to the light
Into the light
