I give my finger to the system
I give my finger to it all
I donât care about the reason
I donât want it anymore

Let us live our life
Yes I can decide
Let us be alive
Put the pain aside
Then you know youâre living right

How much pain can we take
No more for gods sake
Itâs enough for everyone

How much pain can we make
Before we leave it all
I donât want it anymore

I donât wanna play your system
Donât wanna play your stupid rules
I donât care about your reasons
Donât you take me for a fool

Let us live our life
Yes I can decide
Let us be alive
Put the pain aside
Then you know youâre living right

How much pain can we take
No more for gods sake
Itâs enough for everyone

How much pain can we make
Before we leave it all
I donât want it anymore

Try eating some of your own shit â for once
Cosâ Iâm not taking it â anymore

How much pain can we take
No more for gods sake
Itâs enough for everyone

How much pain can we make
Before we leave it all
I donât want it anymore
