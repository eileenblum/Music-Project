So many people tell me what to do
Stay away from me
Donât need that look youâre giving me
Just stay away

Iâll only warn you once again
Donât waste my time
This is the line you donât cross
I will cut â you down

Rolling on
Pay attention â we donât care
Rolling on
I wonât say these words again

Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbreakable
Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbeatable

You carry on your way I told you, you can keep on walking
All Iâm hearing from your mouth is the crap youâre talking

You better go, get off my street
Youâre smelling like a bad disease
I know youâve heard - where I come from
I know what I see â I know itâs wrong

Rolling on
Pay attention â we donât care
Rolling on
I wonât say these words again

Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbreakable
Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbeatable

Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbreakable
Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbeatable

Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbreakable
Yes we are untouchable
And we are unbeatable

Untouchable
