It was a perfect dream
A lovely wonder scene
It took me over and I surrendered

I felt the harmony
Was like a symphony
Drifting on a broken cloud

Then I wandered â nothing conquered
I had my faith â lost in time â lost in memory

I was lost in pain
Free from shame
Beauty has a consequence

Now I realised
It was cold as ice
Staring at a frozen mirror

Now the curtains closed â like a dying rose
No more fantasy for me
For me

Secrets in paradise
Why you let me go
Why you didnât show

Secrets in paradise
Why you let me go
Why you didnât show
Why you left me all alone

Now I feel the loneliness
My bleeding heart is aching less
What a meaning - what a feeling

Secrets in paradise
Why you let me go
Why you didnât show

Secrets in paradise
Why you let me go
Why you didnât show
Why you left me all alone

No more secrets in paradise
