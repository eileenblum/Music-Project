What a wonderful world we live in
Values dead and gone
A wonderful world we're killing
Why did it all go wrong

It's up to you â no matter who
Never ever cross the borderline
I'm telling you â yes, me and you
Never ever cross the borderline

Satellite connections
Saw it on TV
Killing all our senses
The games become too real

What a wonderful world we live in
Values dead and gone
A wonderful world we're killing
Why did it all go wrong

It's up to you â no matter who
Never ever cross the borderline
I'm telling you â yes, me and you
Never ever cross the borderline

One thing that you can do
Mess with the rules
It's not too hard to try
It's up to you â yes, up to you

The world is in a fever
Colour, speed and sound
A high-tech generation
We lost the solid ground

What a wonderful world we live in
Values dead and gone
A wonderful world we're killing
Why did it all go wrong

It's up to you â no matter who
Never ever cross the borderline
I'm telling you â yes, me and you
Never ever cross the borderline
