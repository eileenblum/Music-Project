Born in deepest woods
Blackend blood floods the veins
ancient memories of times before

Storms are passing with their rage
Dark seasons full of rain
Washing away the earth

As the wicked spread their mighty wings
Guided by black storms
Deliver me unto the lands
Reclaming my black throne

I can see beyond infinity
Blackness devours the sky
I raise my sword to the dead

And I command them to
Destroy those who slaughtered
In the name of Christ

As the wicked spread their mighty wings
Guided by black storms
Deliver me unto the lands
Reclaming my black throne

Shadows of the ancients
Suffocate the earth with rain
Clouded skies surround us
Reopening the passage of time

Set the world aflame
They rule again!
The scent of burning mortals now begins!
Jehovas blood on earth - burning!

Cast in the cosmos
Dominion of the Lords!
Opening the gateways
To countless unknown spheres!

Blast of light
Travelling through blackness
You'll never conceive
The passing of the storms
