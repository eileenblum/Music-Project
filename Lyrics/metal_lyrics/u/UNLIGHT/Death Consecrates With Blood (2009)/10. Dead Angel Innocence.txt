Angel innocence
weak and declined
there you lay
now torn apart

What were your last thoughts
Recieving the mark of the dead?

The day you died
You left a sigh
A tribute to life
But no one cares!

Dead angel innocence
weak and declined
Dead angel innocence
Bleeding stiffened flesh

The waves of doom
have taken you
Grant one final desire

The day you died
You left a sigh
A tribute to life
But no one cares!

Dead angel innocence
weak and declined
Dead angel innocence
Bleeding stiffened flesh

Angel innocence
weak and declined
there you lay
now torn apart

What were your last thoughts
Recieving the mark of the dead?
