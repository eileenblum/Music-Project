That old Black Magick has me in it's spell
That old Black Magick straight from Hell

The same old witchcraft since my birth
The same old fire I feel inside

That old Black Magick has me in it's spell
That old Black Magick straight from Hell

Cursed and Damned!
Cursed and Damned!
Old Black Magick straight from Hell!

That old Black Magick has me in it's spell
That old Black Magick straight from Hell

A union that nothing can divide
Like a leaf caught in the tide

That old Black Magick has me in it's spell
That old Black Magick straight from Hell

Cursed and Damned!
Cursed and Damned!
Old Black Magick straight from Hell!

I hear your name, and i'm aflame
Aflame with such a burning desire
I hear your name, and i'm aflame
Aflame with such a burning desire

Aflame! Aflame!
Desire!
Aflame! Aflame!
Desire!
