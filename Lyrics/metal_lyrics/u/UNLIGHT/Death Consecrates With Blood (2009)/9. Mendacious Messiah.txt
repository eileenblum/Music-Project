The times has come for unholy indulgence
The wrath of Satan is near
Mendacious messiah
I'd never follow your light

Come forth from the gate beyond
Glory rises from below
Unsaints awaken
Blackened hate shines in my eyes

Mockery of the father
Sodomy of the son
My master will hail me
And all Christs shall fall

The holy prepare for their doom
mocking the father and sodomize his son
Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit 
Desecrate the Holy Church

The times has come for unholy indulgence
The wrath of Satan is near
Mendacious messiah
I'd never follow your light
