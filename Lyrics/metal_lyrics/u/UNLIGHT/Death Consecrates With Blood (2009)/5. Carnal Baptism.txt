The concealed os revealed before me
Light of the free mind
Bathed in the blood of the divine perception
Cold mind in a dead body
But by far not without flesh
By far not without flesh!

Carnal Baptism!
My blood is the wine of sin
Carnal Baptism!
My blood is the wine of sin

Absorb my spoilt foetus - A dark indecent oath
And an even more shameful baptism
Flesh is the desire that signifies life
I am what I am, What I am for good

Long live the free will and the sanctum of flesh
Long live the free will and the sanctum of flesh

Carnal Baptism!
My blood is the wine of sin
Carnal Baptism!
My blood is the wine of sin
