Black goddess of infernal lust
Hear my begging and request
I am fulfilled by obsessions
Developed in dark, blackest dreams
I took an oath on you
Called you by the ritual's flames
Your Blasphemy is to me the light
In the world of the dead and the living

You're the ungodly sin
From my blackest dreams
You're the ungodly sin

Black dreams awaken dark desires in me
They burn inside like a painful longing
You rise in me the most sombre passions
You're paralizing with eyes of a snake
Me life will grow between your legs
And we'll become the most ungodly sin!
Because I took an oath on you,
and called you by hte Ritual's flames

You're the ungodly sin
From my blackest dreams
You're the ungodly sin

I took an oath on you!
Called you from the flames!
I took an oath on you!
We're becoming the ungodly sin!

Sin is for sinners
â¦ and sinners we are!
Sin is for sinners
â¦ and sinners we are!
