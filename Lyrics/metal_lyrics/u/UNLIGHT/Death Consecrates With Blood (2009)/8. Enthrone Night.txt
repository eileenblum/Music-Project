Oh, I care for dark desires
Set my heart and soul on fire
Oh, final conqueror of earth
The one who's born of flames

Skies turn black
All light comes down
I curse the light
Enthrone the night

Son of fire - Baphomet
The conqueror of earth
Thy everlasting crown of fire
Brings the heavens fall â¦
Brings the heavens fall â¦
The heaven fall!

Enthrone the night

Son of fire - Baphomet!
The conqueror of earth
The magick of the gloom
Seducer of all Christs â¦
Seducer of all Christs â¦
Of all Christs!
