He has risen from frozen tombs
Bringing cold murderous steel
Fleshcutting frost
Bites all the desperate life

There's no escape
Mankind will fall!
All life turns dead
Destruction of descending angels
Now dawns the dead age
Reign of steeldemons
The virgin, she suffers
Jesus weeps all tears of blood

[Refrain:]
Death consecrates - with blood!
Death consecrates - mankind falls!
Death consecrates - with blood!
Death reigns again!

Shrouded in darkness he comes
Either a friend you welcome
Or one you fear
He's the only Lord that all will come to
The only Lord that all embrace in Death

Now dawns the dead age
Reign of steeldemons
The virgin, she suffers
Jesus weeps all tears of blood
There's no escape
Mankind will fall!
All life turns dead
Destruction of descending angels

[Refrain]

He has risen from frozen tombs
Bringing cold murderous steel
Fleshcutting frost
Bites all the desperate life

Now dawns the dead age
Reign of steeldemons
The virgin, she suffers
Jesus weeps all tears of blood
There's no escape
Mankind will fall!
All life turns dead
Destruction of descending angels

Shrouded in darkness he comes
Either a friend you welcome
Or one you fear
He's the only Lord that all will come to
The only Lord that all embrace in Death
