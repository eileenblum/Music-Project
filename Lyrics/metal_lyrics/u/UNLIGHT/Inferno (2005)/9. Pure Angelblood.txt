My spirit is greater than yours!
I will crush the aeon of god!
Die jehova! The enslaver!
Your life lies in my hands!
You and your angels you
Are the whores of fear!
I will rise in the night of the land.
And my dark spirits will rise like plague!
Spitting poison and hate!

Pure angelblood I sip!
As I slay the lambs of christ!
Offer me your soul!
God I tell you time has won!

The white of your angels!
The white of your light!
Polluted by the blood
Of your fallen cities burning!

My demons are hunting
For your angels fresh white flesh.
Your angels are crying
And dying all alone.

I am shipping angelblood!
