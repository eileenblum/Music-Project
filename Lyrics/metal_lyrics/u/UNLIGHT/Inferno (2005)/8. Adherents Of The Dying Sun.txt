Lucid clouds are gathering.
I am raising the storms wrath.
A sky in colours like red curdled blood.
The sun throws the last ray ever.

Now the bright age casts down
Cold fog falls onto the ground.
Dark veils creep across the land
To devour the helpless adherents
Of a dying sun.

Your force is declining.
Your will I am going to break.
Your illusions are ineffectve.
No gold, no splendour will decive me.
A noble heart filled with
Darkness, honour and pride.

Passing bells are ringing.
Sweet sleep awaits.

Leaves will fall. Flowers will wither.
Light will doze away.
As I prove my love to satan.
