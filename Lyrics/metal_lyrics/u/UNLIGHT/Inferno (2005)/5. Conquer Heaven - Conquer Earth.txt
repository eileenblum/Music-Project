The sky has now darkened
And sunlight has reached its end.
Lightning is striking
As satan is starting to rise!

Angels are bleeding
Falling down to die alone.
With their god they are rotting
As we conquer heaven and earth!

My master satan was falling down from grace.
And now he is leading the chosen human race.
To serve at arms - I promised from my heart...
We will conquer heaven, we will conquer earth!

My master satan was falling down from grace.
And now he is leading the chosen human race.
The hordes of satan will gather for attack!
We will conquer heaven, we will conquer earth!
