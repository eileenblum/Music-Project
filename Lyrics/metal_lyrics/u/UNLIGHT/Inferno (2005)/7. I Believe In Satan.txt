I was born to serve the darkest kingdom
And to slay the lambs of christ!
There will be no force to stop me fighting
Just because I believe in satan!

I do believe in satan!
In chaos and destruction!
I do believe in satan!
Until I die!

As I ride to battle
I am with the antichrist.
Now the time has come to
wash my hands in blood.
Angelcrowds I am slaying
And their wings I burn.
And all the blood I am spilling
Is the blood of your god.
