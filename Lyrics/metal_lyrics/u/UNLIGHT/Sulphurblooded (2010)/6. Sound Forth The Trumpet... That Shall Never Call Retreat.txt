My eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the lord
Heâs trampling the deceit
His truth is marching on

Iâve seen him in proud fires
Of a thousand burning hearts
An altar built from wisdom
His day is marching on

Sound forth the trumpets! Sound them forth!
That shall never call retreat!
Sound forth the trumpets! Sound them forth!
Letâs die to disinfest men!

I have read a fiery gospel
A writ in burnished rows of steel
As you deal with his opponent
With you all his grace shall fall

Heâs sounded forth the trumpet
That shall never call retreat
Be jubilant and free
Our lord is marching on

Heâs born to make men holy
Heâs born to make men free
A truth is marching on
That enlightens you and me
