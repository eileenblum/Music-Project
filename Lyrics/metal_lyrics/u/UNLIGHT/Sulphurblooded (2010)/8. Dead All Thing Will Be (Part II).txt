This is the hour to fall into a death deep sleep
Weâre hasting towards death
We do not want to sin any longer
Life is short and shortly it ends
Death comes faster than one believes

Death destroys and spares no one!
Cold and dead all things will be!

Death destroys and spares no one
Weâre hasting towards death
We do not want to sin any longer
You cannot turn around
And become pure like a child

Oh, dearest brothers, donât be afraid
Bitter is death and the tears you cry
The baleful ones are calling
They will never escape

You will be a worthless cadaver
Why do you protect yourself from sin?
Which honour do you expect?
Why donât you admit your guilt?
