With pride I orbit the worlds
My work which I created
Who can resist me?
Who is able to escape from my strength?

Eternity itself to me is subject
I stride on the path of perdition
No one exists who could ever resemble to me
Greater than god and the aim of creation

Unite with the ungod
Turn back!
Become an opponent!

Hear my word! I am the first!
What springs forth from my hand
Cannot be destroyed
It remains free
Born from everlasting world

In chaos I became your creator
Soon rising a new world
My empire in proud form exists
Mankind and their god cannot break it
