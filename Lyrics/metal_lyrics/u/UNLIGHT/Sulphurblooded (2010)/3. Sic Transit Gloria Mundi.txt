I soak the world in light and shine
I am the glare of darkness
I soak the world in light and shine
Light bearing I remain

Leading towards a distance
Conducted by seductive forces
Symbolic memories became
False convictions

Epidemic cult of perversion
The essence of man is denies
The quintessence of existence
Is reversed

Sic Transit Gloria Mundi
I shall resurrect
Sic Transit Gloria Mundi
When hope turns into hate

Live silently in devotion
Never raise your voice
Suppress any instinct
Your hope is becoming nothing

This holy counterfeit silence
Broken with no tongue
Leaving the stones unturned
By building fragile castles of sand

Condemned to feed the void
Mundane pleasures are hell
How arrogant to tell
Man is blasphemy
