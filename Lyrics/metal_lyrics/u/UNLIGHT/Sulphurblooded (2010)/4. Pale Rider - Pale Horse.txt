The first to appear is pestilence
Who rides upon a white horse
Revelation has begun
The first seal is opened

Wearing a crown and a bow in his hand
Victory is coming, his hand holds deliverance

Pare rider, pale horse
The horses of disaster plunge in the heavy clay
Pale rider, pale horse
Hear their tossing manes and their tumultuous feet

In the wake of pestilence come war into land
Slaying each other, giving no peace

There will be famine following war
Tremendous famine, so great
He rides silently across the lands carrying the scale
The black horse and hunger are stalking the land

And after them comes death
His horse is stark pale
This is the end
Of the first four seals
