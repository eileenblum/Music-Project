As I command it, so shall it be
I seek revenge on thee
The spell will bring the spirits
To serve as I wish
To serve my own aim

By then seventh spell
Weâre setting the black circles
By the seventh spell
Unbar the guarded door

Sprinkling masses of blood
Of innocent souls
Sprinkling more and more blood
Iâll spit it all down on your cold and wooden coffin

Prior to midnight by the dark of the moon
Burning some incense to summon the dark
Invocation by the light of black candles
Anointed with blasphemous oil

By the dim lights and the silence
I summon the quiet of the grave
As the seventh hour will strike
Black ink is scribing your name
