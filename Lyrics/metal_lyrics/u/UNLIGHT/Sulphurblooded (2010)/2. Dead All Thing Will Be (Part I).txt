Streams will cease to flow
All wind will cease to blow
The clouds will cease to fleet
All heart will cease to beat

Laid so low, so very slow
Dead all things will be
Dead all things will be

Oh, vanity! Death is waiting
See! Our friends are all forsaking
We are called, so we must go
Laid low, so low

All the things will be dead
Dead all things will be

Death is calling while we speak
Heads are falling, skins are paling
Even strongest limbs are failing
Nine times goes the passing bell

In the dark we must lie
For all things must die
All things must die
Dead all things will be
