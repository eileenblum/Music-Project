Now that the skyline
is of crimson colour
And the moon is up in the sky
I sense them
I sense them calling for me

Ill omens
in the air
I must not move,
but my feet, they take me there

I feel the pull to the skies

Insane howls
Morbid melodies
Pagan fires burn
The earth
starts to turn

Sanity, my sacrifice
for knowledge beyond belief

Dreams in the witch-house
The dreams in the witch-house
My fate is clear

No!
No!

The memories are coming back
Now it's all too clear to me

Yes!
Yes!

This is it!

Yes!

This
Is
It
