When oily darkness chokes the light
When chill reaches the bones beneath the skin
The nighttime noises now have deep meanings
as shadows dance on the empty streets

I can feel it
true meanings and the Hidden
Will lie naked before me
Intuition and senses
This night is mine

Finally the stars are right
Right now right here, there is no time to waste
With day comes blight
for the constellations are drowned in light

Now I know the way
Now I know the way
Now I know the way
Into the gutter
