So below as above
Infinite vacuum
Multitudinous stars
flicker cold light
Beyond them
what horrors may exist?

Vast waters
Below the surface
what horrors lie in wait?
They are yet to be perceived
Mirror image of oneself
Repetition
Repetition
Without an end in sight

The same old horrors..
What is this
The same old surroundings
The same old disgust
Among masters of void I am
Kingdom of emptiness
So in between as above

Fear of the void
Fear of the void above
Fear of the void
Fear of the void within
