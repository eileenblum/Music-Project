Zircon's blaze might be a lure for the fad crown
In the pale interior of this empty Ark
Since the Orcoid orb's fast wounded me
Wuth the greatest passage of a flamming spark

On the North Sea, the King's Hall
Dance the Jester with his serpent

Perfidious, forsaking, rotting the royal blood
As the likeness of a poetic fact
Of a household used to this deceit of vespers gold

On the ornamented throne, the previous fell
Engulfed by the perfume of the sweetest kiss
It's that Bergamot travels the wind of Arcane
With the ugly imp naked in the nebula

The hidden family in the King's own
Vanishing with deep sleep dusk

Perfidious, forsaking, rotting the royal blood
As the likeness of a poetic fact
Of a household used to this deceit of vespers gold

"Thus the glorious vessel climbed
On the incontournable way of the palace
In the chaos of the grotesque clown
Diagram of the noble malicious art
The ship strugglin into horror
The ruler learned with the crystal
To conquer the black ice of punishment
The stars grasp for their proper"

The ornamented throne on the galley...Dream the black...
My landscape pleases me well in this legend
Wretched existence on an Atlantis burried by the lack
My Eden filled of my only fantasy
Following the tragic wind that made you a fool
My empire befell on my beloved creation, sordid star

Standing alone on this leand see of the Silvertree
The acclamation of Fire to dream the last leaf
Before the masquerade relive the Carnival
The Juggler presanting the feast of Arthrone's King

Zircon's blaze might be a lure for the fad crown
In the pale interior of this empty Ark
A grand ceremony for the bastard prince
Who mourn his lost sphere of Archeen

On the North Sea, the King's Hall
Dance the Jester with his serpent

Perfidious, forsaking, rotting the royal blood
As the likeness of a poetic fact
Of a household used to this deceit of vespers gold
