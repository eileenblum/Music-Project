To raise from the earth
Dark forces of old
Undeads feel the appeal

In a morbid dance
They research the entity
Wich gives them the primary state

In this chaotic quest
They search a relic
In a world where times are upset

Vestiges of future
Rise in a past Era
Of despair and sorrow

Damned creatures wandering
To their will
