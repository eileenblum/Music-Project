Where the shadows carress the mind
None is apt to revive the reason
Stroking, manipulating, craving to find
Attractive and irrestible is the temptation

My pure soul she tasted
And the savour inebriated her with desire
The only one to soothe her ire
This uncut jewel she could shapes without haste

She charmed me with her voice, soft as the night
A crystalline sound carried along by the wind by a man who starved
Queen of beauty and sensual delight
Nymph with an unnatural body, all of marble carved

The paleness of her skin
Blends oh so well with the clouds so white
But her soul, filled with an infinity of sins
Is like the darkest coal burried in the dephts of an abyssmal site

We gave ourselves to the pleasures of the flesh
In the ruins of an ancient cathedral
Where in distant times, bounds and ruptures were derived 
Amidst shades of the pas and old memories of passion forgot
Under a timeless veil...

Where the shadows capture the minde
None is apt to revive the reason
Drinking, draining, yet loving in kind
Attractive and mortal is the temptation
