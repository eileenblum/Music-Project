Through the sky, the blood of gof pour out on the Kobold streets
Through the eyes, the villagers feel the malediction's terror
Evil curse, the birds crushing on the church walls
Gruesome witch, a raven tears out the High Priest eyes

A witch has been put to chain, to be judged
Before sentence is pronounced
By a curse, the judge will die

Wizard spell, His twisted mind
Witch hunt, the Divine avenge himself
Chosen by the funeral-pyre, call the anguish of the ceremony
Her deeds of justiciary, through the century

Burnt at the stake, for the sake of stupidity
Ill-treatment for them, faithful to their malefice master
In her last hour, her body cold to pain
No confessions marks her defat
What place will she inhabit amidst the firmament's infinity
She who has been purified by the flames.
