Pass the life unconscious
The entire light is never seen
By the one who close his eyes
On the sad reality of conception
So years of false truth
Guide existence on a reveir of deceits

Ethereal dimensions
Strange worlds of the Vortex
Black holes are the mysterious passages
For mystic places between the stars

(Other forms of life grow silently
Strings of existence make the sound of a sweet melody)
Essence of light creates the source
Creatures feel the ethereal energy
The twilight time of solitude and tranquility

Neutrality, law of the balance
Who commands the Equilibrium
For the unwinding of time
Debalanced by the weight of wickedness
Convert the beings who became corruptible

Construct on the columns of a unique kingdom
Going on a never-ending road
Going in a vicious circle

Spiritual abolishment of the forces of nature
Loyalty, disorder, ethereal dimensions

Walking the edges of middleness
On these plans where the soul is dreamless
Wondering where the Thinkers hide
On the fringe of total madness
Pawns of this futile gods-mode game of chess
