Life still resonates in us
And the echoes of its memory coagulate our resolve
to believe in this fading stance that is called Love
The Reaper himself trembles in front of so noble a power
For his branch is not even mentioned in the Book of Obstacles
Our two souls shall be one from now onâ¦
Until yet a few more deaths do us part
And in the absence of a proper authority to do so
We hereby declare ourselves husband and wife
A most morbid union bringing hope in this bleak land
In dire need of tolerance and serenity
