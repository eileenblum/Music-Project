Marry me !!!
â¦then Iâll kill you
â¦and then you will kill me again with your pocket shark
â¦so handy on week days
Zombie Lovers for life you saidâ¦
â¦how ironicâ¦

(Snongioj son semÃ¢)
Look, I caught you some flowers
Remnants of a late meditation in the sewers
Of course theyâre dead and withering
But so are youâ¦arenât we, dear?

Ceremonial aura
A disgusting samba
Cadavers cooking for your funeral wedding
A most delicious cake is in the making
Does it hurt when I write in your mind?
Because I donât want to be rude
I still can go to the paper store if you desire soâ¦
My skin is itching like crazy and I got a bloody poem in my veins
Wonât win the Pulitzer thoughâ¦
It says:

âThe loving look in your dripping eyeballs gives me hope
Of a most memorable honeymoon
Maybe we could jump off the highest gallows, swinging the rope
Or craft for ourselves a gory cocoon
Yes !! On the way to Salem weâll build a glorious meat temple
A monument to our loveâ¦so meaningful and subtleâ

â¦donât you like it my putrid prince ?

Being part of the walking dead community is far from easy
Misunderstood and abused to the point of extinction
When all we want is a hugâ¦

âThe loving look in your dripping eyeballs gives me hope
Of a most memorable honeymoon
Ride a magic carpet to the Wizard of Oz
Maybe we could jump off the highest gallows, swinging the rope
Or craft for ourselves a gory cocoonâ

Dear Ghoulish and skeletal friends
Rise up from your graves!
Finally, the nuptial rite is about to commenceâ¦
Dress up nicely,
Invoke your ancestorâs spirits; for theyâre also invited to this nighttime festivity
Light your bone candlesâ¦hold them high and tight
Macabre and steady processionâ¦a thousand sparks in the night
Walking up their way to the summit
A wonderful storm is brewing for the celebrationâ¦
