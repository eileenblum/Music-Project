They twist and tangle in this circle of sand
Unclassified

They crawl up the walls everywhere, without precisions
Shapes in a giant bunny's cranium
Hopping and irresolute
Unsolved ideas of a distorted guest
No justifications, for these flavors are tasty passages
The pleasure of sharing a so special collection

If only I had some mechanical apparatus
Involved with my torso
My personal darkness would fade out to the nine winds
Blown away by grafting cells

She tasted spontaneity with an honorable mission in mind
Just to spit out intense squares of uncolored ink
In the face of a pulsating mass of flesh
Talking nonsense on its throne
Damn well she did!

And in view of that case
The oracle declared
That it would be more pleasant to be naturalized
Than to make conversation
With a blind beholder in need of affection
Only to find the same patterns on the fast lane

We are within the nonsense of a larger plan
Worthy of some salt pouring on a bloodied part
Merry, merry, joy, joy!
A nice and pleasant dip in an acid pool

Don't you see my smile?
I just glow with derision!
Or perhaps my eyes, turning pitch black
Only want to pierce these dense walls all around me
They always do when sarcasm is on the verge of punching a well-earned goal

Horns and screams are tools
For the altered thoughts of an attitude
Rooted in multiple layers of beings

We once lost our wings
And can't ignore the excruciating pain of a grounded life

We are within the nonsense of a larger plan
Worthy of some salt pouring on a bloodied part

Sonority Divine!
Positive feelings made this frustration vanish
In a shout of pure energy

To blend is not to bend
To be is one two three
Impulsions on the throne
Choices for you alone
The earth is not round

Sans mÃªme user de paroles intelligibles,
Ils se comprenaient tous
AlignÃ©s du mÃªme cotÃ© de la dÃ©mence temporaire
Ces sons qui salivent de sens Ã©parpillÃ©s
Signalaient un Ã©tat d'esprit intense et implacable

And in view of that case
The oracle declared
That it would be more pleasant to be naturalized
Than to make conversation
With a blind beholder in need of affection
Only to find the same patterns on the fast lane
