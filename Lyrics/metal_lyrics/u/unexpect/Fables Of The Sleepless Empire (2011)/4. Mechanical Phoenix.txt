Orphaned ideas, fusion with this undying snowflake
Meltingâ¦but nothing lostâ¦
Another formâ¦different incarnations
Brains are snowing sites
Mental skiing on neuronal paths
Sport of the dreamers
Transformation, such a natural movement
Unavoidable and so necessary
It passesâ¦and I die frequentlyâ¦to be reborn on the next momentâ¦
Death is part of my short term cycleâ¦for the absolute delight of Life

Thereâs a Phoenix in all of us
Rising out when given the chance
Sweeping across dull horizons
To offer back their fire to the Grays
The universal teapot is bursting with possibilities
Letâs drink moreâ¦shall we?

Extracting the sky from your pulsating heart
Hands outstretched, gray minds, deviant strips of flesh; ingredients to a corporate form
Call me human but I wonât drop itâ¦flattery wonât budge the sludge of time
Indeedâ¦in need of some bakeries you will stand strong
But this fleeting colossus shall not prevail
I donât think soâ¦

At the top of the pyramidâ¦weather is far better
â¦and youâll never know
Keep on crawling

A perpetual flood of obligations
To douse the flaming hearths of rebellion
Taming the wilds
Flaunting the art of deception
Stabbing backs while they watch the buffoons in their act

Empires rise, Empires fall
Structures collapse and lords are disgraced
But no power shall ever strip humanity
Of its creative capacity

The sea is waiting, donât waste seashellsâ¦
It's a wonderful evening

Empires rise, Empires fall
Structures collapse and lords are disgraced
But a free Phoenix stands tall

Drip your personality into my open arms
Soak your feelings into the black hole of abuse
Wash your pain unto others
Donât try anything newâ¦it could be interestingâ¦
What a nice machine you are!
