{ You darken OUR world to brighten the sky
The mud of time and pale drinks won't paint
the clown's face
No father should bury his SON!!
the mask in his face is YOU. }

{ Meet me at the carrousel on the 29âth street...
we'll drink a whole epitaph
Poison of the earth makes us laugh...
Still... I think the clown fakes happiness. }

{ What have we done, running around the sun
for so long ?
It reminds me of a dream...
What's behind us ? }

{ Sounds make him count the times he's die for
an epoch of derision
May I see YOU in younger eyes... }

{ Welcome further !!... Leave your beliefs
at the door
We are the forgotten project... }

{ You darken OUR soul and silence the smiles
The mud of time and pale drinks won't paint
the clown's face
No father should bury his SON!!
The mask in his face is YOU. }
