{ So much for the wicked bonds strangling inspiration, Silent...you retreat
into the Temple _Desert Urbania and drown... }{ Deep within the mosaic
of an inward fraction _Float forth subtle emissaries from outer-materia
_Emerging, but THEY are one, blooming on Mount Chimera _Globular
insinuation, mystic mood in a nameless location. }{ Enu edayon Ã©ikerppa
_Sink and desert Urbania _"He offered me a shapeless way so unusual
_A breach in the maze to feel the unexplainable". }{ Mere words !!
They're not suitable swords _To elate the pagans and their hordes _(Veiled
treasure, I still dream beyond this mortal frame ) _We must focus on
guiding pupils willing to soar _The school of thoughts, mirage haven for
the sightless to explore. }{ Enu edayon Ã©ikerppa _Sink and desert Urbania
"Dancing on the limbs of a venerable and graceful oak _Escorted by fad-
ing Elvish shadows, to me He spoke : }{ "Truth is a shattered sun blinding
the senses of nations proclaiming they gaze at the right fragments... In
this perspective...I prefer okapis to humans". }{ Admire the Invisible, _The
misunderstood majesty of the imaginative ghost _Seize the momentanous
splendor, disciple _Short-lived, Fleetingly sublime. }{Admire the Invis-
ible, _The misunderstood majesty of the imaginative ghost Acknowledge
with serenity the inescapable gaping jaws _Obsession of the voracious
clock... }{ Standing on the edges of reality, one could magnify even a sea
_Believe and develop your innermost We conjure you, be our host... }
{ Controlled madness _Lucid mummy _Ghoulish caress _Acid coffee
Would it seem senseless ? _If we scream like banshees ?!!? }{ Orches-
trated wonders _"Lose your way" and plunder _A charred Bone-Wheel
is spinning _Unique !! Everything is yours to taste..._Wave it still... Long
Live The King ! _Want to peel your skin ? There is no haste... }{ Trancelike
motion _Absorb our potion... }
