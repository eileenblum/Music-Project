[by Artagoth]

Running in a cage like freak beasts on a stage _to acquire the honor of
dishonor. _Humble idea for Machiavellian seeds _to grow their old
megalomaniac trees. }{ See no evil, hear no evil ; Ellet tse erton esived.
}{ In sick organic shadows, _where nano-things are the crutch of life, _The
test-tube men eliminate themselves _inside this asymmetric archaic circle.
}{ See no evil, hear no evil ; Ellet tse erton esived. }{ Tragedy of
selfishness become as they are, _their old bark left bare and infected.
_Root's thirst so immense, _it could transorm the sea to salt. }{ Enu
ratis... will ends the events _I know you will be...lenger arelurb _You will
see, Trom te eiffiret _Tnemeleus at xiork Arengiomet ed nok reunnohsed_ Enu
ratis... will ends the events _I know you will be an ancient shadow. }{ See
no evil, hear no evil ; Ellet tse erton esived. }{ The tragedy is just
beyond our roots _The world stops... }{ We wander here, where only the mad
knows the truth _And knowledge testify in their names _We barter our bark
like stupid pawns sacrificing for their king _Like some miracle boy's
transformations _We transmuted our sap into living bribes. }
