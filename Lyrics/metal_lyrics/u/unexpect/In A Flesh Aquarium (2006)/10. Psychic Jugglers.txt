[by Syriak]

âA dialogue between paradoxes.
Feuding perceptions in the everlasting
scales-tipping warâ

Subconscious foreword
{ Goblins, Imps and farfadets of this cerebral realityâ¦
Mischievous children of the elusive spiritual magic
Atomic parcels of a slippery slippery immensity
Dance ! Gambol ! Exult !!
Go astray of linear paths !!
Free yourselves from the coherent slavery suggested
by the Unclean !!!! }

{ Sporadic fireballs !! Experiment Chaos intensity !! }

{ Perpendicular euphoria
Burst ! Feverish coloured bubbles !!!
Blotch this predictable mindscape. }

Reason
{ You Lunatic ! Be Damned !! Irresponsible
traitor to the Order !
Whyâ¦why this spontaneous incitation to mutiny â¦?!
Herald of confused notionsâ¦ }

{ I AM discernment ! Monochrome protector of the cellular enclosure and its shepherd.....
These imps must be controlled, supervised, realistic...}

Subconscious
{ Obliterate the lock !!! Open Wide the Arenaâs gates and let the Goblins
play !!!! }

{ âFeasting ! Rejoicing ! The tyrant is sleepingâ¦
May the will-oâ-the-wisps sip His foolery as it
Is time for Tea ! Feasting ! Rejoicing !
The willows are drippingâ¦ As robotic genes sing
lullabies, pretty, pretty ZOMBIE !! Catch a falling
moon ! Will they paint our skin !? Voodoo !!â }

{ Besieged by you, Reason and Conformity.
Thieves of the imaginary realm,
Immolators of Childish soulsâ¦ Binary tasteâ¦.
Strolling slowly within this infinite playgroundâ¦ }

Reason
{ Eccentricsâ¦..you cannot appreciate
the pertinence of a slumber
devoid of rodents â¦.
Your purple blood wade within
The sensorial estimation of
A slimy walled fortress !! }

{My wisdom submerges
the disillusioned reptilian
--- Never look up or down ---
Unwavering â Steady â Straight
UnwaveringÂ âÂ Steady â Straight. }

Subconscious
{ Grimace and run, to the opposite side of the herbivore gates who devour
the greenish mixture !! I see your bones and they are aligned such as
paladin ants crossing a wall of stimulating magma. Tame the Cerberus, aim
with serenity and get out of its cavern the swiveling tower of Intra-cosmos
!! }

{ Stupefaction ! The fictive inexistent is materializingâ¦internal visual
information astounded by the absence of total nothingness. Behold Emptiness
and meditateâ¦
â¦..is it not magnificent, to transcend/surpass the focus of an elitist
visionâ¦.not so hard to fix oxygen when youâre living with usâ¦ }

Living Ideas/Goblins
(in the booklet, and following stanza is almost impossible to read with the
texts overlapping each other ... wish I could show you)

{ âHey !!! Vile hunchback, Youâre trampling my mushrooms !!
The me of your anyway is getting oh ! silence must prevail
Economically speaking we cannot afford to let them live decently
What a grotesque nose !
Le the sun shine ! Teeth are painting your insideâ¦
Bah ! May rust nibbles your winged boots !
Everybody ! Caress your hands and letâs be happy friends with big joy !
Does my tan contrast with the architecture ?
Talk talk to me broomstick !
He...He.. Are you frightened of Free Brains ?
May I borrow your head for the evening ? â }

Hummmm....swimming in boiling holy water is such a bloody delight
Shut up !! Gather yourselves and join the assembly...
La Sarabande commence...

We're a boneless civilization in perpetual distraction
In the recess of our volcano
Digging, initializing sequence number 9 : Evolutive Eruption
We are not, we are nuts
Fools in a flesh Starship !

Let's munch our gnarled fingers, Oh ! Sweet atrophy
Skeletons in the gallery, sons of a hybrid galaxy
Trelinak GÃ¶r, ChÃ¼ss Eilorka Snurtifov
Screamed words of goblin's faith, Just never say Checkmate !
