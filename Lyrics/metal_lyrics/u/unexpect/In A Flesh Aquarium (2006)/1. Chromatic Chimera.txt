[Lyrics Written By Syriak]

{ Microscopic dust...
To exist as I of many eyes
Tentacles in our heads wrestling with
anonymous segments. }

{ Rowing deep into the murk with psychosis
sitting on my lap
Finding a rhythm entangled in nothingness
On witnessing the present system
A monstrous collage in movement
Free to stray, swim in a tomb if you want. }

{ All directions, every angles
Nuances, infinite possibilities
Confusion of a saturated mind
The flood is so stimulating, but just where do we stop?
Currents numerous...hard to focus...yessss...yESsSSSS !!!
We want answers ! Not confused babblings ! }

{ Losing control is a treat, still...
We could be drained...
We could be drained...of... }

{ Chimeras, precious chimeras
Ejected from the assembly
Unto a circular technological slave pen
Bound to be part of this geometrical harem
Speak the frequencies of liberation
The universal language of positive similarity
When one crosses the threshold of the collective territory. }

{ An antidote for the imperial poison. }
