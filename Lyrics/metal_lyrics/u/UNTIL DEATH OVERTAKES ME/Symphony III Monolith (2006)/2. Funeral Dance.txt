To continue that motion towards the end,
Slowly...circling...dancing.
This path of solitude,
Towards the immense shapeless emptiness.

Graceful Transcent,
Circling towards the ineditable.
Bereft of will and life,
Tempting whispers from the dark.

Their hands wave a last goodbye...
No-one sees...No-one hears.
And I move silently,
Away, like aeons on the stream

Wandering this funeral path,
Circle slowly...away.
The emptiness is ours...eternally
