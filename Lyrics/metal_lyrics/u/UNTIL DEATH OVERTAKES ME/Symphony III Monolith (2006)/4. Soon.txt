In here...solitude
In here... the pain
You cannot understand

Dark vast shape

Eyes like statue... dreams for tonight
Once the dancer , nothing no more

Refuge in tapers of thought
Flee in aeons of dreams

Afraid...
Want this... to end
Lost all...

Chosen
Solitude...can not flee
From self

Want this to end

You cannot understand
You shall never care...
