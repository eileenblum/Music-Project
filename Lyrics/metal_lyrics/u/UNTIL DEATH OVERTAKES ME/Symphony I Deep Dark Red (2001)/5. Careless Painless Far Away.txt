Deep dark slow...stream flows
Deep dark red...warm blood
My blood falling...this life fading.

Deep dark blood, colder, to forest shadows flowing.

Cold dim sad...open still
Light has left....these eyes
They will shine no more...no more.

Burn no more, eyes, weary of life forever remain dim.

Cold...feel no more
Dim...see no more
Pain...feel no more
Dark...care no more.

Care no more...care no more.
To far away...to far.
