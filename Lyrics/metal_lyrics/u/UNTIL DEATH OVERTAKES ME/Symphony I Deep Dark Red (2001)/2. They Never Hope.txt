Dead trees rise from the snow
This is where my path leads me
Leads me to misery.

They lost their name
They will never dream, never hope
Without words they accept my life.

Desire for endless moments in your arms
Evoken by one look in your eyes
Now there is only the winda?Ts embrace.

Enchanting voice from sweet lips
I wona?Tt hear again...
Only the sad whisper from the cold waste.

Dead trees turn to dust
Covered with eternal snow
I will never dream, never hope again.

This is where my path lead me
To misery so cold...to the end
And i will never return.
