We will never meet again,
Never dream again.

There is no other way,
No reason to go on.

Our eyes shall not be clouded
By beliefs, by hopes.

Our paths leads us,
Straight to the end.

The edge of time,
Where days turn to aeons,
Aeons to eternity
And life to death.

In the cold of the earth,
Where dreams are denied.

Where the knowledge is given
That we will never meet again.

Never again.
