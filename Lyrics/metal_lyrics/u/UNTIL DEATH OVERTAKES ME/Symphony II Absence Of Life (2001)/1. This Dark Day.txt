Tore my hope away, left nothing within - hollow, scarred forever. And their eyes never cease to look, the laughter goes on,
inside my mind. Every dream they tear apart.
My own belief against the masses. Praise their own empty lives, they are shallow gods. Force me to believe their lies, infesting
me with self-hate. Self-hate is opening my veins, killing my mind. Neverending self-destruction, neverending this hurt. Want me
to die, want me to weep, so many of them against my mind - torturing my dreams.
I rather weep eternally, than join your mindless optimism, i rather die now, than ever be a part of your sick world. i try to
forget all this pain, deny all the hurt, deny my own pity life.
The gentle dance - to caress, infest, a gate in my mind towards another life, this one already forgotten. Never have to look at
them again. Breeding as the beasts that they are. Procreate - promutate - why wona't you just become extinct.
The raging hate kept me here for another dark day, hating myself, hating them, who denied my life and love. The anger towards
this world burns and grows within, together with my facination and my desire for Death.
