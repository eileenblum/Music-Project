Shea'd smile - lovely dance.
Shea'd cry - of sheer joy.
But no more - death took her smile away.
Mountains guard the core of her being,
A soul of immense pure beauty.
Keep me safe - far from the hurt.
Hold me tight, keep me warm.
Never leave me.
Shea'd cry - of sheer joy.
Now I cry - life ebbs away.
Death, you took my friend away.
Be so kind to take me, too.
