Where will i tomorrow be
When no longer here

No longer here...
no more dreams...
Slip away
Here, the rain...so empty

They are not here...not here anymore
And i drown in desolate waves...desolate waves
Of bottomless black seas...alone...alone
Slip away...alone...alone
Slip away...away...away

Here the cold...alone forever
Soon will be gone
No more dreams...no longer here

Soon will be gone...soon...soon
