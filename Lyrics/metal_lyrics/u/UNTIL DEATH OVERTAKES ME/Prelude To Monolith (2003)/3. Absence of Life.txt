Reach for the cold - eyes stare dead - unspoken dreams.
Absence of will - no joy in life - let me go.
Guide me away - another path - another life.
In need of - Understanding - for times to come.
All of my ways - all of my dreams - so meaningless.
More affection - in my heart - than in the world.
Absence of will - absence of love - hate this world.
