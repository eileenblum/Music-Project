I'm so afraid to have you feel like this
But you're so afraid of second chances
Despite the walls growing in between us
I'm moving on...

I'm so afraid of feeling like this
You're so afraid of going past us
You just betrayed the one to never turn their back
I'm moving on...

You built this up the best you could
But there are things misunderstood
Like how to love, and how to care
And always trying to be there
When life was hard and I fell down
You left me crawling on the ground
You let me suffer and you didn't care
And all I needed was you there
It's time for me to be moving on
To start the life that's not begun
I'm moving on...

This is the last time you will betray me
This is the last time that you will hurt me
This is the last time you've destroyed my hope
I'm moving on...

I'll be okay after you have gone
Without you my life will still go on
But neither hope nor bliss
Will undo all the shit you've done
I'm moving on...
This is the last time that I'll stay
And then again I'm moving on
I'm moving on...

You built this up the best you could
But there are things misunderstood
Like how to love, and how to care
And always trying to be there
When life was hard and I fell down
You left me crawling on the ground
You let me suffer and you didn't care
And all I needed was you there
It's time for me to be moving on
To start the life that's not begun

I'm moving on...
