So UNCARINGâ¦ so UNKIND
You BUILTâ¦ MY WALLS up HIGH
Dead emotionâ¦ and NO DEVOTION
You've NOâ¦ IDEAâ¦ WHY
Given upâ¦ blame and ???
There's NO REASONâ¦ to FORGIVE
DEAD INSIDEâ¦ leave a shell
There's NOTHINGâ¦ LEFT to GIVE

So UNCARINGâ¦ so UNKIND
You BUILTâ¦ MY WALLS up HIGH
Dead emotionâ¦ and NO DEVOTION
You've NOâ¦ IDEAâ¦ WHY

Your FACEâ¦ SHOWS DISGRACE
Which LEAVES youâ¦ COLD and BLIND
??? bleeding heart ?? of another time
My spirit collides, and [?]

Your FACEâ¦ SHOWS DISGRACE
Which LEAVES youâ¦ COLD and BLIND
You HAVE NO HEART, ??? of another time
Your SOUL in a RUTâ¦ in YOUR WORLD of LIES

So UNCARINGâ¦ so UNKIND
You BUILTâ¦ MY WALLS up HIGH
Dead emotionâ¦ and NO DEVOTION
You've NOâ¦ IDEAâ¦ WHY
