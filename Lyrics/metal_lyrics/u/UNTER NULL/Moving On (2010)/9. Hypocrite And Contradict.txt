You've BEATEN DOWN on me
And TRIED to TAKE AWAYâ¦ WHO I AM
Without BOTHERINGâ¦ to LISTEN
Without even TRYING to UNDERSTAND

[Chorus:]
GET OUT NOW!!!!!
And LEAVE MEâ¦ to MYSELF!!!!!!!
Go FUCK!!!!! Your IDEAS!!!!!!
Go FUCK!!!!
YOURSELF!!!!!
I can NEVER TRUST YOU!!!!!! You ALWAYS LIE!!!!!
[?]
WHY should I TRY???!!!!
GOODBYE!!!!!!!
GOODBYE!!!!!!!!!!

I HATEâ¦ what you've DONE!!!
You've TOYEDâ¦ with MY MIND!!!!
ONE SECONDâ¦ you say you CARE FOR ME
And the NEXT you're SO GODDAMN UNKIND!!!!
If THIS is what I GETâ¦ for TOLERATINGâ¦ your ABUSE
Then I NEVER, EVER, WANT TO KNOWâ¦
What will BECOMEâ¦ of ME AND YOU!!!!!!!

GET OUT NOW!!!
And LEAVE MEâ¦ to MYSELF!!!!!!!
Go FUCK!!!!! Your IDEAS!!!!!!
GO FUCK!!!! YOURSELF!!!!!
I can NEVER TRUST YOU!!!!!! You ALWAYS LIE!!!!!
[?] martyr!!!!!! WHY should I TRY???!!!!
GOODBYE!!!!!!!
GOODBYE!!!!!!!!!!

No more FUCKING with meâ¦
No more messing aroundâ¦
No more [?] to bleedâ¦
NO MORE BEATING ME DOWN!!
No more BACK-HANDED WORDS!!!
No more BLAMING and SHAME!!!
No more GUILT WITHOUT CAUSE!!!!
NO MORE OF YOUR GAMES!!!!!

I cant see [?] so blind
I won't let you [?]
I let it out [?] the last man [?]
But youâ¦ you won't EVER tear me down

GET OUT NOW!!!!!!
And LEAVE MEâ¦ to MYSELF!!!!!!!
Go FUCK!!!!! Your IDEAS!!!!!!
Go FUCK!!!!
YOURSELF!!!!!
I can NEVER TRUST YOU!!!!!! You ALWAYS LIE!!!!!
[?] martyr!!!!!! WHY should I TRY???!!!!
GOODBYE!!!!!!!
GOODBYE!!!!!!!!!!
