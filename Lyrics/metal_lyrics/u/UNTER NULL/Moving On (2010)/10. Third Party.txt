Don't ever say you think of me!!
I don't want to be in your memory!!
A part of you, a part of me
There's nothing left of this to speak!!
Don't ever speak my name again!!
I don't want to be some fucking sordid tale!!
That is all just lies and fallacy!!
I don't want to be a part of history!!

I know you heard I'm doing well
And as far as I can tell
Another day has passed since I fled
And you haven't said a word
So I'll tell you what my secret is to moving on
Like I did
I'll tell you what my secret is
To moving on

Rise above, you stupid man!!!
[?] you are
You'll realize you're nothing!!
Pretense of caring soul!!
And a mockery of heart!!
I paid your dues!!
I'd bide my time!!
I cursed your name!!
[?]
[?] my life
You relentless fuck!!!
You made my life, a living hell!!!!
How dare you (?insult?) those tears (?you made?)
All the [?] you played, portrayed!!
(?the projection?) game is so fucking old!!!!
And you're the only one to blame!!!!!!

I know you heard I'm doing well
And as far as I can tell
Another day has passed since I fled
Oh yes I fled
I know you heard I'm doing well
I'm no longer in your hell
Another day has passed since I fled
Oh and I laughed
I know you heard I'm doing well
And as far as you can tell
Another day has passed since I left
Oh since I left
I'll tell you what my secret is to moving on
Oh like I did
I'll tell you what my secret is to moving on
Oh I'll tell you what my secret is to moving on
I'll tell you what my secret is...

Don't ever say you think of me!!
I don't want to be in your memory!!
A part of you, a part of me
There's nothing left of this to speak!!
Don't ever speak my name again!!
I don't want to be some fucking sordid tale!!
That is all just lies and fallacy!!
I don't want to be a part of history!!

I paid your dues!!
I'd bide my time!!
I cursed your name!!
[?]
[?] my life
You relentless fuck!!!
You made my life, a living hell!!!!
