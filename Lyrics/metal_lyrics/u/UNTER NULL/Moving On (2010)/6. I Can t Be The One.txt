In the SILENCEâ¦ in this POISONOUS ROOM
Iâve got NO SPACE to BREATHE as you HOVER and LOOM
GUILT over my head, it's TOO HEAVY to TAKE
I feel myself BREAKING under the WEIGHT of MISTAKES
You CONSTANTLY SAY I have ROOM to IMPROVE
YOUR LIFE DOESNâT REACH HIGHERâ¦ YOU NEVER IMPROVE!!!!!
THIS LIFE of these GAMES, they become SO APPARENT!!!!
And I am READY to MOVE ON and LEAVE YOU in TORMENT!!!!!

[Chorus:]
I WILL BE THE ONE who REMAINS UNBROKEN!!!!
I WILL BE THE ONE who SPEAKS WORDS UNSPOKEN!!!!!
I WILL BE THE ONE who DOESNâT ACCUSE!!!!!
I WILL BE THE ONE who DOESNâT ABUSE!!!!!!!!!
I WONâT BE THE ONE who CONSTANTLY BLAMES!!!!!!!
I WONâT BE THE ONE who PLAYS FUCKING GAMES!!!!!
I WONâT BE THE ONE YOU CONTROL ANYMORE!!!!!!!
I WANT YOU TO KNOW, AS I WALK OUT THE DOOR!!!!

I CANâT TAKE YOUR LIFEâ¦ and YOU SHOULDNâT HAVE MINE
You're DEPENDENT and SICK, though you DENY!!!!! DENY!!!!!
DISAPPOINTING your CURSE, so SHUT OFF from LIFE
You're TOO PROUD to ADMIT, so you LIE!!!!! LIE!!!!!!!
I CANâT save your SOLACE, though you're LACKING in HEART
I CANâT say you're BROKEN, though you're FALLING APART!!!!
I CANâT GUIDE YOU AWAY from the PATH you must TAKE
You will ONLY find RUINâ¦ PAIN and HEARTACHE!!!!!!

[Chorus:]
I WILL BE THE ONE who REMAINS UNBROKEN!!!!
I WILL BE THE ONE who SPEAKS WORDS UNSPOKEN!!!!!
I WILL BE THE ONE who DOESNâT ACCUSE!!!!!
I WILL BE THE ONE who DOESNâT ABUSE!!!!!!!!!
I WONâT BE THE ONE who CONSTANTLY BLAMES!!!!!!!
I WONâT BE THE ONE who PLAYS FUCKING GAMES!!!!!
I WONâT BE THE ONE YOU CONTROL ANYMORE!!!!!!!
I WANT YOU TO KNOW, AS I WALK OUT THE DOOR!!!!
