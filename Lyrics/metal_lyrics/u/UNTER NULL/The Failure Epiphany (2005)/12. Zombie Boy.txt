I want to be your zombie girl
And you can be my zombie boy
You have my heart, now give me yours
Let's play dead before we die

I want to be your zombie girl
And you can be my zombie boy
You have my heart, now give me yours
Let's play dead while we're alive

I want to be your zombie girl
And you can be my zombie boy
You have my heart now give me yours
Let's play dead before we die

I want to be your zombie girl
And you can be my zombie boy
I have your heart right in my hands
Let's play dead before we die

Can you be my zombie boy?
Can I be your zombie toy?
Can you be my zombie boy?
I will be your zombie toy

Let's play dead, let's play dead
Let's play dead
