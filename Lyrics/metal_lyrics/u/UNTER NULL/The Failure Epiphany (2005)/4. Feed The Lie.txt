Feed the lie
You're laying in a darkened room and hoping for the time to cease
Wishing that this wasn't real, discard your memories
You're waiting for my company to fill your empty void and need
You fed the lie and I have fed the taste is poison sweet
Feed the lie

Your friendly gesture's full of lies
Your smile you wear I now despise
Your gruesome mask you wear with pride
You twist the truth before my eyes

You're laying in a darkened room and hoping for the time to cease
Wishing that this wasn't real, discard your memories

You're waiting for my company to fill your empty void and need
You fed the lie and I have fed the taste is poison sweet
