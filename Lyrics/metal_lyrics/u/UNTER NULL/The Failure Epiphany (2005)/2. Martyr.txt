I've fallen down for you before
I will not do this anymore
There's been enough tears shed for you
If only you could see me now

I've wasted time on you once more
I cannot do this anymore
There's been enough life spent on you
If only you could see me now

I want to make you watch me bleed
As you drain the life from me
I want to make you watch me die
As you have so many times

And I have fought your sorry war
I will not do this anymore
There's been enough blood spilled for you
If only you could see me now

And you are rotten to the core
And you have played me for a whore
There's been enough love lost on you
If only you could see me now
I want to make you watch me bleed
As you drain the life from me
I want to make you watch me die
As you have so many times
