What distance remains to keep us apart
No concept remains no beat of the heart
What silence is kept to keep me away
No promises held to lead me astray
I take my last breath, final sinking down
I found the place to die alone
I see the last light, dim, growing dull
Sinking down to unter null

If only you knew
What truth and lies behold
If only you knew
You left me dead and cold
If only you knew
I only wish you dead!!!
If only you knew
I could blame God instead!!!

Whatever you lost, you held close at hand
No passion retained, no will to stand
What war you have waged, to fight to the death
No loyalty slips from your dying breath

I try with last hope
Fearful, growing scared
I know the place I need to be
I make the last call, mute, fading fast
If only dreams like this would last

I only wish you dead!!!!!

What distance remains to keep us apart
No concept remains no beat of the heart
What silence is kept to keep me away
No promises held to lead me astray
I take my last breath, final sinking down
I found the place to die alone
I see the last light, dim, growing dull
Sinking down to unter null

I only wish you dead!!!!!

What distance remains to keep us apart
No concept remains no beat of the heart
What silence is kept to keep me away
No promises held to lead me astray
I take my last breath, final sinking down
I found the place to die alone
I see the last light, dim, growing dull
Sinking down to unter null

If only you knew
What truth and lies behold
If only you knew
You left me dead and cold
If only you knew
I only wish you dead!!!
If only you knew
I could blame God instead!!!
