[sample:]
"So wrong.. "
[-???]

I KNOW you DESPISE meâ¦ but WHAT can I DO?
You ONCE SAID you LOVED MEâ¦
I TOOK IT as TRUTH.
I KNEW you'd DESTROY meâ¦ with your VERY FIRST HIT
But it's ALREADY DONE
I'm TOO SCARED to ADMIT

The MIND-GAMES are TIMELESSâ¦ the ANGUISH WONâT END
I've TRIED to REPAIRâ¦
The things that WONâT MEND
The HEARTBREAK is CAUSTICâ¦ the RANCOUR lays DEEP
I thought I would FIGHTâ¦
The battle so STEEP

I KNOW you RESENT MEâ¦ with MY EVERY BREATH
I'm SORRY, I'm TRYINGâ¦
I'd FIGHT to the DEATH
I know you IGNORE meâ¦ to PUNISH my PAST
To TARNISH my FUTURE
I thought it would LAST

DESTROY MEâ¦â¦
DESTROY MEâ¦â¦
DESTROY MEâ¦â¦
DESTROY MEâ¦â¦

"It's hard to feel safe.."

DESTROY MEâ¦â¦
DESTROY MEâ¦â¦

YOUâLL TAKE NO MORE
I'll RISE from it ALL
You'll SEE that I'm NOT who I WAS ANYMORE
YOU CANâT TEAR ME DOWN
YOU CANâT BRING ME PAIN
Iâll NEVERâ¦ BEâ¦ the MARTYR AGAIN

DESTROY MEâ¦â¦
DESTROY MEâ¦â¦
DESTROY MEâ¦â¦
DESTROY MEâ¦â¦
DESTROY MEâ¦â¦
DESTROY MEâ¦â¦
DESTROY MEâ¦â¦
DESTROY MEâ¦â¦
DESTROY MEâ¦â¦
DESTROY MEâ¦â¦

"It's hard to feel safe.."

DESTROY MEâ¦â¦
DESTROY MEâ¦â¦
