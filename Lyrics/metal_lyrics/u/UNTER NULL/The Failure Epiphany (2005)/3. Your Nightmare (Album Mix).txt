"This is just a dream, you're not alive.."
[      -???]

Burning hell burning rage
Unholy fear can't be erased
Shaking, tremors. hold me down
Lips sewn shut - trapped and bound

Shaking...shaking..shaking..

"Ever have that feeling where you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?"
[     -The Matrix]

Guide me down beneath the flames
Make me feel the guilt and shame
Pull against your steel resolve
Slowly shatter and dissolve

Burning hell burning rage
Unholy fear can't be erased
Shaking, tremors. hold me down
Lips sewn shut - trapped and bound

My veins they flow with blood of ice
No mercy spared, no compromise
Malice, hatred, soft licks of lies
All that hides behind your eyes.

Burning hell burning rage
Unholy fear can't be erased
Shaking, tremors. hold me down
Lips sewn shut - trapped and bound

Draw your blade across my skin
Never thought you'd be so cruel.
Another dream lies forgotten
In this spreading pool.
