"Why can't you give me.. the respect I'm entitled to??!!
Why cant you treat me?!!  Like I'm treated by any stranger on the street??!!"
[-????]

My final offer to you
Is one pound of flesh
One pound of sin
These deeds have gone unjustified
You entered forceful in my life
I've nothing more to offer
While you take more and more and more and more and more and more..
I can't face the day
You hid the sun
And everything, is dark again

You broke my heart
Tore me apart
You broke me down

I hope you rot
Oh, I hope you rot

I'm worthless, useless, this is what you've done
I'm scorned and bitter, you have won
I hope you rot
Oh, I hope you rot
You broke my heart
Tore me apart
You broke me down

I hope you rot
Oh, I hope you rot
You're worthless and useless
This is what you've done
Don't you see what you've done?
You broke my heart
Tore me apart
You broke me down

I hope you rot
Oh, I hope you rot
Don't you see what you've done?
You broke my heart
Tore me apart
You broke me down
I've nothing more to offer
While you take more, and more, and more..
