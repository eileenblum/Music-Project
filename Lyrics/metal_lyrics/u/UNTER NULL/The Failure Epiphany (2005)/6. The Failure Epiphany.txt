Let me be your savior
To guide you from the depths
That reach up with a pull so strong
Too intense to resist

Let me be your confidante
To lead you not astray
The crooking winding paths go far
Guiding you away

I am a lover
I am a friend
I mean well
And I understand

I'm a fighter for your heart
I never want to be apart

Let me be your everything
Let me break you from these chains
That bind you down without a cause
That curse your life with grief and pain

Let me be your helping hand
I'll reach far as I can
To pick you up when you're fallen down
To lean against so you can stand

I'm a fighter for your heart
I never want to be apart

You, Deceiver
You, Destroyer
Of everything that's beautiful
You, denier
You, a liar
You're everything so horrible

A monster in disguise
Where ugliness evades
A martyr with no cross
A killer with no blade

You, Deceiver
You, Destroyer
Of everything that's beautiful
You, denier
You, a liar
You're everything so horrible
