For god's sake - you're just like a brother
For god's sake - not like any other
For god's sake - you're not just another man

For god's sake - there's no way of knowing
For god's sake - there's no way of showing
For god's sake - it's not just another crime

[Bridge:]
Down in the streets - it's just dirty and mean
Down in the streets - we're just living in fear
Down in the streets - we're gonna burn and fry

[Chorus:]
'Cause we're living in mean streets - Mean streets
We're living in mean streets - Mean streets

For god's sake - we can't keep a going
For god's sake - we reap what we are sowing
For god's sake - it's not just another time

For god's sake - antother dead brother
For god's sake - they're all motherfuckers
For god's sake - there's no way to heal the blind

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

[Rap:]
Down in the streets
It's just dirty and mean
Down in the streets
We're just living in fear
Down in the streets
We're gonna burn and fry
Down in the streets
We're gonna take you high
