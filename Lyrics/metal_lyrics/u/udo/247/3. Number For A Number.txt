There are secretes better left alone, like Pandora's Box
Throw away the master key, high-tech fantasies

And the mystery of our history, stories been untold
Some words have been classified, hide the danger code

[Bridge:]
The scream to stop they silence, they're working on to win
Blindedy by their science they carry on the sin

[Chorus:]
Scream killers - Right and always wrong - Scream killers
They are the scream killers- Always go too far - Scream killers
(Never go too far)

Universal energy, the world is not enough
Science of insanity, 'n' one day time is up

And they all dismiss the reason why, playing with our fate
Cast away the destiny, stop - or it's too late

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

[C-Part:]
Corruptible intruders seed the dragon's liar
Exposing generations, fall out's in the air

Scientific medding, technology unleashed
Microbiotic pahsing, the helix of the beast

Even if there is a master code deep inside withing
Follow nature's symphony, the only way to win

And the time has come to turn on the game, make your final choice
Listen to your heart and soul, mind the inner voice
