Detrimental assets, money down the drain
C-C-Cash in all their pockets
(let's) ride the gravy train

Playing at casinos, yachts and caviar
Mistresses and champagne
Apartments and fast cars

[Bridge:]
Dehumanise resources, fix the budget plan
A grey suit revolution, hide the paper trail

[Chorus:]
You take a number for a number
Take a penny for a dime
A number for a number
Another dirty crime

Capital expenditure, global energy
Upsize all the markets, cost is misery

Siphon off the excess
Secretive accounts
Documents and contracts
Third world body count

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
