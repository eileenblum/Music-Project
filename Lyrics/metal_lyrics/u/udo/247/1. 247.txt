I'm gonna blow your mind and push you higher
I have my may to find and nail the liar

You want it cleaner - I make it meaner - Anyway you want
You're gonna squeeze it - you're gonna please it - Always on the hunt

[Bridge:]
Come on and roll it - So fucking hold it - Move your ass
Come on and screamed it - We fucking mean it - Living fast

[Chorus:]
You know we live it - 24/7
Twenty-four hours - Seven days a week
You know we give it - 24/7
Twenty-four hours - Seven days a week

I'm gonna kick you hard, you want disaster
We only take it rough and tough and faster

You want it cleaner - I make it meaner - Right between the eyes
You're gonna squeeze it - You're gonna please it - Always pay the price

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
