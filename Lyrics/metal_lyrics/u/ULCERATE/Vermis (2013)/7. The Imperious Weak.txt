Eyes of the viral and absolute
To never be met as equal
Pollute the masses
Their past ordained
Their future annulled
For the dominion of the vain

Dictate the righteous
Inhuman decree
Boundless hate and callousness
Spare no blood
Not the congenial nor kindred
The austere concede only to their means
And their ends served only in death

Inside the fractured mind lay decrepit convictions
Embedded and never erased

Unashamed
Unchallenged
Unmoved
The imperious weak

Becoming damnation
Assure the path to infamy
Fall to opprobrium

Within the prison bereft of hope
Collapse is determined

Unashamed
Unchallenged
Unmoved
The imperious weak
