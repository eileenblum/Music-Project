Call upon apparition
To answer a fervour for cessation of time
So thinly veiled yet resolute
Submit and become worthless

Unchain totality
And be witness to chaos

Darkness
Cold and vacuous
Sink under its power
Swallow those within

They of unjust order

Frail
Broken
Mortal

I am released
Upon acknowledging our terminal nature
Liberated from immortality

All that has amassed
May not be long of life

Disown in vain
Await rescission

We will remain stagnant
Before observing the reflection without prejudice

Frail
Broken
Mortal
