No pity for the destitute
Of the land stained in blood
Left deserted to face futility

We must not dream of virtue
Us poisoned elite
We are void

Decry the willing
Decry the resolute
The desperate grasp releasing
In refusal to subsist

An endless aperture
Is the essence of their disposition
Obtuse at the surface
Pernicious in being

Cut through the superficial, cursory effusion

What is ignored in the present
Will be resurrected

The forsaken confront entropy
Alone, helpless, wandering toward demise
