The helpless wander in vain
To forget all before them
This inner sanction
A blinding vision

Through neglect we falter
All are subservient

To burn out the absolute
Shadow our nature

Crawl into the darkest of holes
With reason forbidden we fade
And our shattered remains will lay to waste

This is our weakness, our failing

Suffer at the hands of those we feed
With wounds to show for nothing
Breathe the ashes of our burning past
To swallow whole, the denial

These self-conceived walls close in upon us
And we shall never see the light of day
