Etched into the earth's effigy
The graven image of man
Inhale your idols and parasites
Cold blood of the declining all

Visions of desire cut deep
Reject them and rot
Rot away in worthlessness
In fear, in isolation, in realisation

In fear of inferiority
Swallow the blunt reality
This earth bleeds for no one
Indifference is your existence
Indifference is your execution
Cower in shame

The shadow stalks in the wake of regret
My eyes roll back to never see again

And on my deathbed I remain silent
I cannot uphold the dogma
I will not shed this trusting secret
The coming soullessness embraced
Darkness
Fortitude
Nothing
