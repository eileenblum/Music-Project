The primeval genesisEtched into forgotten fleshIn darkness, oblivious, we exist to no avail To no availTo never unearth The insipid with their deadpan stareLong for worth in dying oceansTo never unearth By the scorn of weaknessLay me to rest Rip away the flesh we scarred with godAnd scour our bones for deceitBeneath the black shroud of abandon lay fields of usOur bodies still; our minds hollow and sightless Here we lay, nothing without deceit The immortal, reflected in dead oceansDrowned by frailty tied at their feet Even still in death, this falls on deaf ears I am the eyes of our inceptionSewn shut
