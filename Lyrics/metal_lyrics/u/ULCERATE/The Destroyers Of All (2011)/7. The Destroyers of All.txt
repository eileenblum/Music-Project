They fall from spoiled skiesStrangled of graceAnd know only to mask their vile faces They know not the figure staring back at them;Not their beginning nor endThey surrender in blissful fate The undying pariahTo which the cowards shun and beg remissionCold-blooded and callousIt does not grieve It will never grieve So detached, the destroyersWide eyed in rapture and unfulfilledIn ignorance they remainUntil their ruin Bring me the comfort of cold inertiaBring me the graves, poised for our leaden demise Our extinction, seeded in blind avarice Come dawn, no light will be thrown on themThis vermin, these ingratesUs of the earthThe destroyers of all
