Sleep now, willing hostsIn envy, accede to this void of life so bleak and fragileThere is only silence hereNo resistance A silent corrosion of mind This innocence lostThe tide long retreatingYou cannot see above the walls, encircling high This sanctuary and its need, infectiousYou will not see againThe infected will never see again To claim this as nothingYou should not be of this worldOf those who preach deathYour words are poisonAnd those of stone in apathyYou crawl with them You crawl with them in decay This cold becoming never dethroned Of those who claim this fire as nothingI will forever despise
