Shallow worship of the azure and the earthNot as they are or have beenBetrayed and distortedDragged through tarnished waters and purged in tongues Gouge no deeperFor our hollow souls are upon us Our hollow souls, our enemies, upon us The marred hands of our leper idols wring us of all hopeOur hollow idols wring us of all hopeWe have betrayed ourselvesAnd now forever lie dormant Trailing this solemn road at duskAt its end, we leave no markWe have no futureWe will be rightfully forgotten
