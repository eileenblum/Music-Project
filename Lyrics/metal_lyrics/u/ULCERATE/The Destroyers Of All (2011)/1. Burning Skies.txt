Atop the shameless towerWith wings outstretchedAn apprehensive shadow is cast over allDrain us of our divinityAnd leave us dry amongst the dirt of men In the worst of our nightmares we are weak and servile We, as martyrsFear runs through our veinsHung for grandeur and fateWe hang lifeless With blind eyes turned from daylightWe denyWith blind eyes turned from the glare of beingLoathe that which we are I abhor the undiscerningNo more of my blood will be shed of pityWith an empty and unforgiving heartOnce more, I scream to the sky For I am mineThe rot of subordination I burn away I am mine
