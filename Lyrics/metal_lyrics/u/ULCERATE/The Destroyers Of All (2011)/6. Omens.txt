The reverence of those lost owed to the landTo us it is withered and worthlessTo us it does not belong What of this radiance we have left behind? Creatures of abyss, born of viceWe are not theyThey preach chaos and delusionAnd welcome it without breath With the omens in flameWe are still; we desert the truth Truth has no name hereAnonymous in clouded visionOur disgrace, far from reachLeft unknown
