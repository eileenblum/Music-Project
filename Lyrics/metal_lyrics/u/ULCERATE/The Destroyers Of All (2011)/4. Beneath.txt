RejectionIn gasping air from vast surroundsSubjection to all that breathes itSuffocate in the idle and emptyIt calls for no one The beast of no willGives rise the servants of causeThey hold their breath as it sets behind the hillBanishing them to the dark It will set and rise again and again Speaking only of your endIt pierces your unyielding pretenseThe illusion shattered and exhausted It will set and riseDull and fruitlessIt will set and rise again and againWith no ambition
