Against the tide of empire
To which we are wedded
To which we are nailed
Exorcising every breath and whim
Strangling the hosts
Desperate and complicit
Burning for grand illusions

Idolatry of power
Immersion of self
We are fixed in a moment of time
But sooner imagine annihilation

In the minds of all
Implanted death
Annihilation

The burning and longing are unmet

Delusions of being in the midst of all
We are but a speck of dust in hell

Walls of futility tower above
Transparent to the weak and oblivious
Built with betrayal
Unbroken by mutiny
Betrayal of their own accord

Perish in the fervour
For everything and nothing
Bring down what remains
Forfeit all for annihilation
