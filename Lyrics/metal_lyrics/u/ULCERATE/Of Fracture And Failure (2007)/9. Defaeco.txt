Brightest white, blinding
Angelic and rustic
The greatest beauty I've ever breathed

I for one know what this is
The great redeemer
Our bastard child
Let it rise

Standing aside the crippled dreamer
We begin to understand the design
And prepare to climb back into the womb
To be reborn as bone and ash

Absolution is all that remains
Swallow the truth and chase it with blame

In bliss, watch our smiles melt away
Wash us away, drowned in relief
Still and open for the first and last time
Repaid and returned

Let our blood mix with the soil
The earth soaked in us all
Our sorrow and our pardons
Now, my good friend, we are even

This is our end
