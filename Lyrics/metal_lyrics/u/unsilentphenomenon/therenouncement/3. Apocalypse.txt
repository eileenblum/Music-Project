War or peace, something we miss.
This is (a) choice of (the) mankind.
Past and future are the same.
Gods will tell goodbye!

From the moment that we see
Always take anger and greed.
Colors of the life
Turn into black.

[Bridge:]
Make your choice
And vote for freedom.
Choose the peace
And blue sky above...

[Chorus:]
Agony, heroin, melancholy,
Wrath within.
Revolutions, life disease
In the future - Apocalypse.

Human's insolence so much,
Our plan's destruction.
Everything is falling down.
We have no reaction

Acid rains, polluted seas,
Fucking soot instead of breeze.
We must stop all this
Or we will die.

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

War or peace, something we miss.
This is (a) choice of mankind.
Past and future are the same.
Gods will tell... goodbye...
