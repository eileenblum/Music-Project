I am the Evil master
And you should know.
Diablo is real
Don't you think so?

My ancient entreaty
Shake the air
And awful devil
Is instantly here.

[Chorus:]
Diablo it's your nightmare.
Diablo is everywhere.
Diablo takes you and me.
This is insanity.

Devil has come
Like pretty girl.
She took my proud
She made me crawl.

I see reality,
I choose my love.
She is a devil,
But who cares of staff

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2:]
She is a horror evil,
I understand that.
Maybe I want it,
Maybe I'm not.

This is my way I choose it,
And time will tell
I'm falling down,
See you in hell.

[Chorus]
