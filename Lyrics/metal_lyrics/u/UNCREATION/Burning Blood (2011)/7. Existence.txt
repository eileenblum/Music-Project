Hearing my screams
they die on walls
just like my hope
fearing the dawn

I can't hold on
to breath the air of liest
timegreyed hair
and dead blue eyes
endless nails
on useless hands
carrying the spawn
of electric scans

Bloodpainted signs on the dead walls of the corridor
through the keyhole I can see them all
humaoid demons in white wea rs and a pen in claws
writing down the fears and dreams to see
how the madness spreads in us
the vicitims of sorrows lust
guiding to insanity
to the doors
to kill me free

The windows are made of steel
there's no way, there's no heal
quarantine, the desease,
I can feel it
I can feel the c haos in me

I can't living with all this pain
inside of my head
headache is bursting my head
into flames of chaos
and the committed crimes
shoes us the legation
of human madness

step by step
step by step
step by step
step by step

step by step
step by step
step by step
to insanity

Bloodpainted signs on the dead walls of the corridor
through the keyhole I can see them all
humaoid demons in white wears and a pen in claws
writing down the fears and dreams to see
how the madness spreads in us
the vicitims of sorrows lust
guiding to insanity
to the doors
to kill me free

Hearing my screams
they die on walls
just like my hope
fearing the dawn
