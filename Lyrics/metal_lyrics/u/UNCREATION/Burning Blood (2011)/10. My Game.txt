There the shade
Above the land
Screaming lightning, roaring thunder
Black clouds befogs the sky
Breathing storms escorts your fly

Seeking, bleeding, raging eyes
Burning head, uproarious cries
fogging tail swallowes the tracks
running fast, I bite your neck

Iâm watching
Your run down
There in the
Scanty land
Youâre lost there
In my game
of hate
go down to die

Seeking, bleeding, raging eyes
Burning head, uproarious cries
fogging tail swallowes the tracks
running fast, I bite your neck

You will never come out
You will never sleep there
Youâll never get a hideout from my cruelest hate
You will never laugh again
You will never feel save
You know the only way out here of my game

Iâm watching
Your run down
There in the
Scanty land
Youâre lost there
In my game
of hate
go down to die

for me
In my game
Go down on your knees and pray
Give your live
To the new
Cruelest God
I'm your god

Now were together here my love
Your sorrow grows to my personal war
Not to decide about mankind
Just you, your torture and this tide
