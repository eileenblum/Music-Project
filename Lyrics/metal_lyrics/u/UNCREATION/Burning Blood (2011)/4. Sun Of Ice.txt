The signs are falling, like my stars in the night
Splitted pieces of my mirror skin

The Fog of your breath
fills your face with thorns of tears and ice
your deny the frost that grows
over the sea and land
a symphony of white and blue
that blinds your senses and creates
another worlds, where feelings seems still alive
oh, such a lie

I look around in a snow filled world
and a frozen sun is crying down on us
Unknown tears in our forgotten hearts
stonemade bullets in masked war

Approach the sky

The signs are falling, like my stars in the night
Splitted pieces of my mirror skin

I look around in a snow filled world
and a frozen sun is crying down on us
Unknown tears in our forgotten hearts
stonemade bullets in masked war

Approach the sky

The signs are falling, like my stars in the night
fragments of my skin reflect the painfull light
The last prints are marked by glass blood and ice
guiding into a frozen lake
leaving the lie behind
