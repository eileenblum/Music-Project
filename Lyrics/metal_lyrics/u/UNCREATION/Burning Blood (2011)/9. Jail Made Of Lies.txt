So much fear
in your silent face
your life
so cold and dark

You're too
proud to cry
but you are
slowly losin g your self

Running out of this reality
hiding in your own world
shadows move
where light should be
this place is a jail made of lies

Stay alive
stay by my side
don t stop
to fight

Stay alive
stay by my side
weâll destroy
this jail made of lies

Your dreams
are like drugs for you
but theyâll never
come true

You want to scream
to get out of here
but youâre too tiered
to hold on

Everything what you hear
everything what you see
is not true
and real

I know
how hard it is
to wake up
to feel this pain

Your voice betrays your sorrow and your loneliness

I will save you
I donât want you to die alone in your fantasy
I donât want you to die alone in your fantasy

Running out of this reality
hiding in your own world
shadows move
where light should be
this place is a jail made of lies

Stay alive
stay by my side
don t stop
to fight

Stay alive
stay by my side
weâll destroy
this jail made of lies
