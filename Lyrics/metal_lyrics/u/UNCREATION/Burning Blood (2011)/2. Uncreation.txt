Burning feathers, broken wings
blinded eyes and spell bound skins.
Black faces, striking fists
broken chains around our wrists

Another night, they hear our yells
frigthend people and the sound of bells
Once we were, like no one heard,
Observers, no revengebird

Spread your wings
and start to fall
it comes the time
to end it all
Cause the time has come
To rise up high
Uncreation
Let them fly

Mute can scream
and blind can cry
I cannot hear but I hear the lie

Take a last look, behind your back
Remember the world, like it were before
ruled by blindfolded
we can't stand this anymore

Spread your wings
and start to fall
Now it's time
to end it all
Cause the time has come
To burn up high
Uncreation
Let them die

Mute can scream
and blind can cry
we cannot hear but we hear the lie

You'll never know,
you won't learn,
what it means
to waste this life
And we won't teach
now it's our turn
To sculp this world
how it's ment
