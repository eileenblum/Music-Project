Close your eyes
and fly with me
far away
from reality
take my hand
we`ve got a way to find
out of darkness
out of mind
back to life

Hear my voice
and run with me
into our own eternity
all qualm you left behind
out of sorrow
into the light
back to life

It`s my place to hide
my seat to cry
my time for life
my world to die
this universe is mine

Between the stars
and the sky
i build my world
my second truth
my sweet demise
dreams of dead eyes

Leave me alone
with my little light of life
leave me alone
in my own paradise
a never-ending story
of an eternal night
never-ending heartache
of a great desire

IÂ´ve to kill
a part of me
Hate will change
what`s left from me
no way to see
the tears behind my eyes

IÂ´ll let die
a light in me
for eclipses
of my destiny
no chance to feel
the tears behind my eyes

When my dreams
erase my heart
silence
leads me back to dark
I donÂ´t care about the rest
of that sick machine in my chest

Close your eyes
and fly with me
f ar away
from reality
take my hand
we`ve got a way to find
out of darkness
out of mind
back to life
