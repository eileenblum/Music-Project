Unreal memories
Created in my mind
Make me feel like
Iâm living in a lie

There is a way
Inside of me
My time
is running away from me

Nothingâs holding me back
Nothing can fill this space
In my empty heart

Moonlight rain
Is falling on me
Heâs calling me
To escape from here
Moonlight Rain
Iâm feeling under a sky
Full of razors

Iâm dreaming of the rising sun
Iâm waiting for someone who takes me out of the rain
I know Iâll be alone for eternity
My last hope is the embrace of the death

Some wounds can never heal
Iâll try to fly away from the past
I know thereâs nothing more than pain to feel
And I run in the end

Every night I cannot sleep
The fear is hunting me
Somethingâs bleeding deep in me
In the night

Moonlight rain
Is falling on me
Heâs calling me
To escape from here
Moonlight Rain
Iâm feeling under a sky
Full of razors

Iâm dreaming of the rising sun
Iâm waiting for someone w ho takes me out of the rain
I know Iâll be alone for eternity
My last hope is the embrace of the death
