Clashing clouds around your eyes
fear and desire in one expression
a sound is dying in your throat 
empty thoughts, in obsession

I can break your innocence
I can break you
I can break your innocence
I will break you

Flying high in to a several dream world
Greets the moon and stars, breaking human laws

Kissin your mouth and kissin your lips
your wet skin is glowing of our heat in eclipse
Your yells are the music, and orchestra of lust
Your exta cy spends me light in the dust
Fired colours are burning my head
The bodys alive, but the senses are
The longing in your eyes is empathy
Mute and too loud in my insanity

I can break your innocence
I can break you
I will break your innocence
I will break you

We are merging into a perfect dreamart

Earthquakes and the hate of naure
Human madness the ways of death
We're left out of your world
Don't take notice nor a breath

I can break your innocence
I can break you
You will break my innocence
You break me

Flying high in to a several dream world
Greets the moon and stars, breaking human laws

Close your eyes and take my hand
Up on the moon, down in the oceans sand
Inside the water without a thought
We have no need for any god
We're alone in this empty world
Our fanatic screams were never heard
Dreaming until we escape from the time
Dreaming until the last moonshine
