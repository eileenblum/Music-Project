Your heart pulses a stream of fire
pushes it throug your hands and brain
Claws are ripping in into stone
Broken bones don't feel no pain
Your anger rises up, against yourself against the world
Curtain's now on fire and i shout

I'm praying for a life without your
Rotten grin inside my dreams and I burn
I can't stand another look into your face
And I sprinkle you with my burning blood

Travelling now to the time we met again
The place I cursed a thousand times
The eyes I felt in love with and
wish to forget to clear my mind

They say, nothing stays forever
Neither you nor her
Save yourself and save your heart
stop to hope, you'll be apart
Love is made to break in pieces, breaking steel and breaking hearts
Even without my eyes I see you splitting us in parts

I'm praying for a life without your
Rotten grin inside my dreams and I burn
I can't stand another look into your face
And I sprinkle you with my burning blood

Use your burning blood
Use your blood
Burning blood
Burning blood

Travelling now to the time we met again
The place I cursed a thousand times
The eyes I felt in love with and
wish to forget to clear my mind
Love is made to break in pieces, breaking steel and breaking hearts
Even without my eyes I see you splitting us in parts
