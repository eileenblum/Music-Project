[Music and lyrics: Leirbag and wulf]

Riding on his deadly horse,
He's crushing all in his way.
The dead is rising
And the panic starts.

The pain is the code of doom
And he uses it to kill at all.

Death takes all that he sees,
Corpses in the highway of blood...

Rivers of blood in his name
Flow through the world,
They do sacrifices to him,
To the Doom Knight!

In the night he appears,
Cause of doom and disorder.
Only the magic can stop him,
The wizards have a reunion.

He knows all and he is awaiting for them
And they will go to their own death!

Total doom around the world,
Doom Knight, lord of this world.

Rivers of blood in his name
Flow through the world,
They do sacrifices to him,
To the Doom Knight!
