[Music: Leirbag, wulf and 8a. Lyrics: 8a]

Mixed cultures, living together.
Abstract races, meaningless biblical rituals.
Art of culture, it has changed and it's history...
Without our knowledge â dominated by false ideologies!

We don't own neurons.
We have no memory.

Actions without field, now man's routines.
To experiment personal life... live without fear and lies.

One renewal... one language...
Understand chaos â find your lost life.

We don't own neurons.
We have no memory.

[Solo]

Enters a new mind...
Syncretism insane...
I represent nature...
Bloody history and texture!

It's the reality, it is a way of life,
Hybrid thoughts.
Connected by the system.

It's the today... diversity of forms.
Abstract and real effect:
The insane syncretism!
