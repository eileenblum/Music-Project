[Music: Leirbag, wulf &amp; 8a. Lyrics: Leirbag &amp; wulf]

Look through the evil eye,
His insane iris is of blood,
Red as a putrefact flesh,
Piercing look of freezing heat.

Now I can see my lord is coming,
My own possessive death.
My heavy body start to falling,
Time is ending, is over yet.

And then in my brain,
The immense solitude possess my body
And feel my soul in hell,
Burning and suffering the sentence of death.

Blood, cut off blood.
Bloody evil eye.
Blood, cut off blood.
Death die now!

[Solo]

When the evil sees you,
You cannot save yourself from him.
Your body is calumnied in hell
And the pain of the evil will consume you.

I will survive for the next match,
Something says me you can try,
Alone, searching in the dark,
The devil can attack and catch.

Feel the fire of hell
And praise for your soul, pray hard
And prepare to the power of Satan
In your eyes: the evil eye!

Blood, cut off blood.
Bloody evil eye.
Blood, cut off blood.
Death die now!

[Solo]

[2x]
Blood, cut off blood.
Bloody evil eye.
Blood, cut off blood.
Death die now!
