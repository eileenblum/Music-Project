[Music: Leirbag, wulf &amp; 8a. Lyrics: Leirbag]

Hot winds of hell, arrive to the world,
The evil hand take your soul, the death comes to life,
The undead awake and take the world.
Kingdom of doom, the nightmare comes true,
The people falls in fear and the humans disappear
In the act!

Devastation and terror I see in my destiny,
Holocaust in his name the evil Christ.
Undead awake and take the world again,
No mercy no more love,
The only feeling available is the sorrow of the death.

Undead awake!

Madness and frustration cause terror,
The undead kill at all, nobody can be saved.
The lives of all we take and turn the world
In a kingdom of sorrow and pain,
The undead awake again with the power to change all!

Undead awake!

Run and save your ass if you can,
The death is over you.
The nightmare comes true,
Your end is near...

You cannot escape!
You cannot survive!
The undead is around you,
The death is over you!

Fight like a beast!
Die like a fly!
No one can defeat me!
No one can destroy me!

Destroy your brain
With the metal power.
Feel the evil,
Be an evil!

[Solo]
