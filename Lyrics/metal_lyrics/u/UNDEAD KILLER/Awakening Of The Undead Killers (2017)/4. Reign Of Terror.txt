[Music &amp; lyrics: Leirbag]

Masters of the ancient religion,
Demons from the deepest hell,
Soldiers of the darkness army,
All that are we the undead!

Horror and scare is the only way to feel,
Pain and terror, our reign will begin,
Madness and torture you cannot resist,
Survive or die now, the choice is yours.

Reign of terror,
Land of no one.
Reign of terror,
Madness and sickness.
Reign of terror,
No one will survive.
Reign of terror,
The undead will arise!

Masters of the darker religion,
Demons from the hottest hell,
Someone has awakened us,
The ritual has been done!

The scream of a virgin,
The cry of a child,
Black roses in the altar,
With a sword in his hand:
The ritual begins!
