[Music: Leirbag, wulf &amp; 8a. Lyrics: wulf]

Humans!
Of this despicable world,
Now we will destroy you,
With our singing of infernal fury.
Schizophrenia!
Madness!
Dementia!

[Solo]

We are the killer circus!
We will impale your existence!

Our brains so dread and dark,
Like the human hearts.

From our hands
We will spawn
Vices for the humanity.
We are he killer circus!

[Solos]

You weak mortals!
