[Music: wulf, 8a and Leirbag. Lyrics: wulf]

Enter in a world of chaos
Between the life and death,
Machinery controls your life
With the cogs of misery,
System leads you straight,
In their greedy need,
Power and control:
You're turned into a zombie!

Brainwashed you walking
Looking at your screen
Thinking that your life
Is under your control,
While the leaders take over
Each one of your strings,
Sucking all your mind,
And your money too!
Is the government...

Are the companies...
Is the religion...
Is the war!
Scheming with your life,
Writing your destiny,
With your own blood
They fuel their
Death machine!

Using you for war,
Testing with your brain,
Infecting cults of evil,
Zombified puppet!
Born, grow and die,
Is their programming,
If you don't fight back
You'll be just an undead!

Is the government...
Are the companies...
Is the religion...
Is the war!
Scheming with your life,
Writing your destiny,
With your own blood
They fuel their
Death machine!

Death!

[Solo]

Death machine!
Death machine!
Death!
