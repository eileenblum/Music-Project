Lessons are taught, yet not learnt...by all that surrounds us,
Strange how we never listen, travel blindly through Life...
In our citadels, bastions of power...
Surely we will prevail, as ever before...

Well now wake up the giant, as it slumbers beneath,
The World proud and defiant, surely we cannot fall...
The cities of man, will be as nothing...
When our final demands, are met with silence...

In the end...we'll see...too late...
All that's left is nothing, but the strife for survival
Our last reward

With faceless devastation, can Life be classed as foe?
Or divine intervention, for what crime who's to know?

Despite all beliefs, and creed or colour,
With no distinction made, all must now cower...

Now is the time, we shall survive
Conquering fears, do it or die

Now the ending, has come for you...
Cease your questions, wasted breath...
Words unanswered, voiceless terror...
No emotion, this just is.

Earth...Flames...liquid forms...
Fear...Pain...sets the norm...
Calm...Waves...before the storm...
False...Hopes...Gojira is born...

No enemy, can be fought, when it is no-one
With pain of birth, a face beheld, yet it is futile
You seek to thwart that which, is beyond comprehension...
With destruction comes new life ...The cycle is completed...
Faceless Devastation!!
