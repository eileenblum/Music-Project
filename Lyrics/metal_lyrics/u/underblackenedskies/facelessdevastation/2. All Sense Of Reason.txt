When pressure breaks throughâ¦all sense of reason, lost!!
And tension snaps tautâ¦the inner core, seethingâ¦
To be unansweredâ¦definition, shatteredâ¦
The fragile truth thatâ¦weâre all stretched too thinâ¦

Allow meâ¦to explain something to youâ¦
This canât beâ¦more than just passing fancyâ¦
I see the truth that lies within every manâs deceitâ¦
The thought to rationalise, now leaves you incompleteâ¦

Sense the feelingsâ¦building in youâ¦
Invasive questionsâ¦feed confusionâ¦

You may findâ¦an easy path to reliefâ¦
Walk on blindâ¦.with pretence that all is normalâ¦
I see the truth that lies within every manâs deceitâ¦
The thought to rationalise, now leaves you incompleteâ¦

Now raise your walls upâ¦seek protectionâ¦
Pertinent questionsâ¦erase foundationsâ¦

When pressure breaks throughâ¦all sense of reason, lost!!
And tension snaps tautâ¦the inner core, seethingâ¦
To be unansweredâ¦definition, shatteredâ¦
The fragile truth thatâ¦weâre all stretched tooâ¦
Thinâ¦

Life will be sacrificedâ¦
And thereâll be more to passâ¦
To walk this pathâ¦
Even the worthy will succumbâ¦
The paradox in thisâ¦
That love we must destroyâ¦
In this we stand as one,
And yes, weâre coming home!!

The Skies awaken!!

When pressure breaks throughâ¦all sense of reason, lost!!
And tension snaps tautâ¦the inner core, seethingâ¦
To be unansweredâ¦definition, shatteredâ¦
The fragile truth thatâ¦weâre all stretched tooâ¦
Thinâ¦

When pressure breaks throughâ¦all sense of reason, lost!!
And tension snaps tautâ¦the inner core, seethingâ¦
To be unansweredâ¦
The fragile truth thatâ¦weâre all stretched tooâ¦

Donât even tryâ¦We see the truth that lies withinâ¦
Walk on byâ¦Our sense of reason isâ¦
Complete.
