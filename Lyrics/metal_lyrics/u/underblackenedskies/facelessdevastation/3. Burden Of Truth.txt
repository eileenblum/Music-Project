A dark haze devoid of responsibility 
A numbing pain self-destruction born of lethargy!
I hate that they see this disappointment mirrored in their eyes.
To give in to weakness self-doubts behind a mask of pride

To be considered, you must at least take part...
If it's up to fate, you'll be left down below...
When visions beacon, crossroads you still dictate...
The burden of truth, that you don't give a shit...

A red mist devoid of responsibility!
A raging pain self-destruction born of apathy!
I hate that you do this disappointment mirrored in my eyes.
To give in to weakness self-doubts behind your mask of pride

Cower I will be seen to walk upon the path of failure
Too self-absorbed in my righteous behaviour
Now you may know I will defend this,
I'll stand my fucking ground The right to question,
Justification easily found You gave us reasons,
A few more than just one And rejected chances,
You won't let go We will defend this,
We'll stand our hard-fought ground The right to question,
Justification easily found You gave us reasons,
A few more than just one And rejected chances,
We will let go
You will not accept That we've walked upon that path to failure...
Too self-absorbed in our own behaviour
