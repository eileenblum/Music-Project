When we came to life, the future was already paved.
When we first came to life, instead of a name a number
Nice jobs, big studies is what our parents wished
Same for our government, the more money we'll make,
The more money they'll get
They want you addicted to drugs you don't need
Hypochondria you feed the pharmaceutical companies
On the check board survival is the only goal
We fight our way through society
Overwhelmed there's no future
Annihilating the superstructure we could avoid
Bring bound to servitude
Without change the bodies will pile up faster than a bushfire
Inside the wasted youth the fire still burn
That's what happens when you're condemned to serve
