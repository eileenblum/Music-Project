The world is a Warfield with hate and corruption.
We have supposedly evolved in 100 years
But everyday too many children lost their souls.
So what are we fucking waiting to react?
We can't change the past but we can change the future.
Dictators, Violent minds, chaos agents will pay for the destruction
For their part politicians agreed to send their army to defend the right of men at a huge price.
We can't exist in this world of war.
When people will stop thinking only about money, the true human values will appear
All of us have the capacity to change a thing in this shit.
The corpses of all violent brains who love to see atrocity will burn.
Never stop fighting against people who don't follow our way of peace.
How can we survive in this?
