After many years of violence, and human conflicts another kill another death another war
Each day is always the same
Nothings change over the years
Terrorists war start in the beginning of the day and then runaway
More than thousands corpses, mutilated cadavers
And circle of dead children on the ground
Violent attacks against civil are not justifiable
Too many thoughts in my mind
Too many violence in my veins
How can we change this world?
How can we survive?
Today all dreams are only hope
A goal to reach, today's dreams are only fear
Because you won't have the chance to get it
After all those years of conflict in this world is there an end to that game?
