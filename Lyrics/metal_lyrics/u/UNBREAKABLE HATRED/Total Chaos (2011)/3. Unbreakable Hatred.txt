Time's passing but always same shit happens
Politicians are lying when we want some explanations
Always same clauses, same ideas
How can you trust future?
How can you build a family knowing future is doubtful?

Our bitterness is so deep that time makes it evolve to hatred
Cash is a critical problem in our state management
Contractor and business owner just want their quarterly profit to grow up
Those guys don't give a fuck
About little employees who wake up every morning to do their best
Anyone can take our place
Every single of us
Should have an equal chance
To live in harmony with himself
We got to express this hatred which is inside of us
Economy, politic, violence
All those topics blast us all
It must stop
Our life's battle just began
Some time, it will come to an end
