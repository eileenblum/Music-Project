Behind our thoughts hide our anger and fury.
We look all these pigs whose systematically spit on the poor
We have contempt for society as a taste of ashes in our mouth.
The workers like us always pay the bill
We destroy the enemies, as we destroy a band of fucking rats!

Death is always present
Your days are numbered
We hate your indifference
Death, the only way
Time pass and nothings change so it's the time to express our anger and our fury
