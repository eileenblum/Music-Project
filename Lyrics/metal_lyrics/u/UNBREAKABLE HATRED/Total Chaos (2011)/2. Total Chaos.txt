First light of the day bring violence and destruction
Cadavers piles along the streets
Lay in the front of the morgue
Everything destroyed
People try to survive
Last night they bury the corpses
Tomorrow, they try to rebuilt
TOTAL DEVASTATION CHAOS!!!
Several wounded persons are left to themselves
They try to save their lives
Morgue is surrounded by corpses
Every hour, trucks unload bunch of cadavers
Asking for help, searching in the rubble
Decomposed bodies, ruined streets
Survivors stand up through the carcass
Putrefaction smell is amplified
Annihilated state, destroyed installations
Damaged streets, food and water become rare
People are ready to kill to get some
Because there is no fucking law
Epidemic risks, infection, butchery
When we say that life is stronger than death
This is not bullshit!
