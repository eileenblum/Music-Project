s it normal for a doctor to be set free only a few months after killing his two children?!
Stabbed dozens of times, the steel got the best of these innocent kids.
So much blood and tears were shed without any justice being given for them.
A society hurts deeply because of those more than barbaric actions.
there's no way to justify this blood-bath.
We're supposed to believe in our justice system.
Murderers run free while innocents rot behind bars.
A defective justice system run by brown envelopes filled with money.
Police officers tempering with evidence to get a conviction.
They tell society everything works fairly so no one disturbs the peace.
Money driven lawyers defending the indefensible, specialists testify to explain the unexplicable.
How can we sit back and accept this so called justice system that doesn't give justice to our victims?
Two innocent souls are reduced to ashes 'cause a man they loved unconditionally couldn't contain his violence and rage.
Police officers tempering with evidence to get a conviction.
On that day, his solution was this cold kitchen knife.
