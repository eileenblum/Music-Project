Live with his own demons, human distress and suffering,
keeping your head out of the water becomes difficult,
to not trust anyone, to betray life,
even hell doesn't outfear my everyday's nightmare.
the only worthy thing is this addiction.
To spoil your loved one's life, to lie and to manipulate
just to find your way out,
getting trapped into thinking everything's alright when all is crumbling.
Suicide in daily thoughts,
psychosis and questioning, hell doors are open and angels of death flying above your head like starving
vultures.
To always take the bad decision to the detriment of yourself.
Hate yourself more than anything you've ever hated.
An endless cycle, pain and distress.
Being a good person but proving you're not.
Until you're alive, nothing is lost.
Believe in other things than this addiction.
