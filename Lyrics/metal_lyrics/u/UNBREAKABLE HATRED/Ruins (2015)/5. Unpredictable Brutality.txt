In a house that could resemble ours,
Extremists are preparing an act of brutality without precedent.
Their goal, blow up a bomb and dismember innocents in the name of their religion.
Those maniac's beliefs aren't like ours.
Those mindless soldiers can't tell what's right from wrong.
Blindly fighting for a cause
It's definitely hard to predict random act of savagery.
With their raging hearts, they live in the shadow,
Hating, Plotting to kill innocents.
All these maniacs want is for us to talk about them, to install fear into each of our homes.
Small cells, living independently but always ready for torture.
Entirely manipulated by a chief, who hides underground like an vulgar insect.
That is how racism slowly emerge through popular opinion, who don't know how to react.
Hating other colors because of some individual's sadistic gesture.
Unpredictable Brutality.
