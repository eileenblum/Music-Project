The high society is willing to do anything to see it fucking fortune magnified.
They believe that the prestige in life is achieved by owning as many goods as possible.
Greediness, betrayal, and corruption define the heart of these motherfuckers
Even politicians get involve in robbing and fooling us.
They should represent middle class workers who give all they have to feed their families.
Meanwhile, they bought mansions with filthy money.
It's hard to come back after living a rich and luxurious life.
They became addicted and crazy like junkies, they will do anything for their own.
Alliance between politicians and swindlers are omnipresent.
Those fuckers believe that we don't know,
So they will carry on until someone gives opposition.
People like us suffocate and are pissed off by them laughing at us.
