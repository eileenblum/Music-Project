Modern human still experience primitive thoughts: facism, racism and homophobia tempted to live in a materialistic world
Some people forget the real values
The reality behind this is some humans think than they have the absolute truth
Primitive thoughts: anger, hate, jealousy, envy and pride
History shows us
That violent dictators like Hitler did not have an open mind about difference
In fact, genocides took place 'cause these people were not able to tolerate other things than their own visions
Many men died because their skins were not white or they were not religiously affiliated
Can someone take a human life?
Occidental society is doomed
Violence, death, hate in collective thoughts
we can find solution to live without primitive thoughts
We must accept finite disappointment but never lose infinite hope
