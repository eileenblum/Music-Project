Human existence is now sinking by itself
The perfect life we try to create everyday can come to an end at anytime
Our world shows us unpleasant vision of what's to come
Violence, murders and rapes spilled blood over territories
That the patriots of peace and freedom hardly defended for centuries.
The beginning of the end is imminent.
Eventually, because too much hatred surrounds us,
It will be hard to believe that reason will chase darkness away.
