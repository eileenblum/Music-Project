Days have passed, and nothing goes better.
The only thing that remains is human flesh sculptures.
We are destroying the world.
This is the result of today's politics.
Structure of societies destroys humanity.
Can't rebuilt something that can't be rebuilt.
No one will take the blame.
No excuses for this loss

Ruins, this is the reality
Ruins, consequences of our actions.

No one will take the blame.
No excuses for this loss
If I choose between war and death, I choose death

Your god won't be useful.
Too much errors made.
Hell awaits for us.
Only hate and chaos.
Armed conflict and violence.
Entire cities severely damaged.
Population decline.
More diseases and catastrophes.
Genocides, mass executions.
Modern warfare.
Survival instinct. American dream is dead.
