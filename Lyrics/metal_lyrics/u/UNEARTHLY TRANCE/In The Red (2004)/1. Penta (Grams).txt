[words: Ryan Lipynsky]

Pentacle vents inside the mansion
Enormous consequences
Loom in the sky
Nomad + Magician = 1 (instead of 2)
Trident Guides Me
Through The Storm
All chaos shall be attributed
to the triple five (HADIT)
Grains of a Gorgons memory,
Who is to care?
Rain brings snow, let us
smoke into the night
annointed by the daughters
of Thelemba
Mastic is burning and I am
but a sun of resistance
Soldier of science, Sorrowed by Silence
