[words: Ryan Lipynsky]

inside the winds of the stress tornado...in drug I trust
inside the winds of the stress tornado...in electric I trust
inspired by myself and the intoxicated enlightened-self
STATICKSTATICKSTATICK
I dared to cross a few lines to discover the coals
which roast the secrecy...
call me a pagan if that means if it means I am
the crooked stick in your path
I am that bastard..I took that oath
A razor tongue could fuck you till you bleed!
full of lust and a bad attitude...
its all so raw and silver
dont try to cover up the bleeding
you cant disguise a sea
dont accept a "seal" of nothing
listen to the faint musick
A nightmare soul...
sold me a wound...
so I torched the tyrant...
and taught the thief!
