[words: Ryan Lipynsky]

beware of the asocial artistry
it is the husk of depravity
behold the circle around me
introduce the parasite to catastrophe
it is the far and near that you never hear
it is the never and forever that you fear
a casual death becomes salvation
a sabbath enveloped by desolation
synchronicity scorching like a red river
between the legs of the scarlet woman
the might of the downcast is growing
inside the silver vessel....
what will be taken is what they have forsaken
what has been given is not what has been living
