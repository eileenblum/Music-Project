[words: Ryan Lipynsky]

I hear flowing lava here in this freezing dawn...
there is a deficiency of mercy
(and) an efficiency of heresy
after all these years
im underneath the fire
this is the molten mourning
just another pyre
in the red glowing...chasing the blinding opal
in the red glowing...smoked out in the pristine chamber
who would dare spit in the face of destruction?
these butchers are just hallucinations
so understand this:
I have no problem stepping on a heart if it pollutes my haven
So let me sleep!
or ill strike down with the hammer on the last nail in the coffin
.....the needle is pinned......
