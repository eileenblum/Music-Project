[words: Ryan Lipynsky]

-reserve the right to vanish
-reserve the right to incinerate
-preserve the fight for lust
-preserve the height for might
So horrified by the hallowed halls which suck my inners towards
the hellish hatred.
The chasms of struggle, deep down in the valley
of the conquerors frequency.
So I sold my soul to Lucifer, he said to me..
"Act dead and sing my song"
Insert the devil of hope in my weapon,
I aim without discretion.
