don't feel like speaking
no distinction in vapid thoughts
slipping into a chasm
the compass contorts towards the strange lands
to the plane of ancient dead
tracks in the facade
transmissions from the stars
the gold is buried too deep
bombed ears and crushed resolution
slipping into a chasm
dislocated vomiting numb words
repulse the absurd minds to the plane of bewilderment
cracks in the stars
transmission from mother earth
each footstep takes me into a parallel vortex
parallel past present and futures
among the ancient atmosphere
and relive the reasons for revelation
the course of the cursed
the consequence of the course
the pitch black behind closed eyes
all meaning is meaningless
