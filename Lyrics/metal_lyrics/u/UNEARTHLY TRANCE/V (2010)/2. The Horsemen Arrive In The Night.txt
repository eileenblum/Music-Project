the horseman arrive in the night
the lambs are ready for the slaughter
morose future
murky past
heat waves - future ice storms
soundless shot - precisely piercing
aimed carelessly - havoc under the moon
so few
control
so many
way past due
foreboding abolishment
control is flesh
no one is saved
salutations from the death camp
waiting for the train to nowhere
pressure cooker
politicians hooker
butchers cleaver
witches lever
hourglass of dreams
never will obtain
