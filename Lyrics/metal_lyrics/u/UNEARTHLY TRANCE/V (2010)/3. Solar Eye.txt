tallest north serpent rise
eucharist disregard in mire
slowing sinking, scowling
fevers of descent
don't think you are dreaming
this daze is made of sirens
blackening beast bombings
pathological fires
look with eye in the middle
in the middle of the skull
never will you see it
not through the sea
nor through any land
entrance:solar eye
sacred silent spider webs
biological anomalies
faint glorious discordia
beckoning beyond bleakness
metaphysical manifestations
rabidly clenching souls
invoke the eight
obey the five
from the middle of the planet
invisible grip of the inner
never will you see it
not through the sea
nor through any land
entrance:solar eye
grey decay, the truest, only way
inside nothing, the anti manifests
grey decay, the truest, only way
outside everything, everything is nothing
staring into the sun as if it was pitch black
