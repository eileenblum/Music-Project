its high time for the shit to hit the fan
choke on the fumes seeping in
surrounded by shallow murky filth
take the last blind walk out now
on the splintered hopeless plank
let the sewers overflow
engulf the putrid streets
enjoy your ride on the tide out
former metropolis, submerged
of vermin - and human
fleeing from the toxic flood
of vermin - and human
half alive in the aftermath
there is no future in this nightmare at last, nothing left but atlanti(c)s
former metropolis, submerged
of vermin - and human
fleeing from the toxic flood
of vermin - and human
there is a forgotten past
in this dream
there is no dreaming in this reality
