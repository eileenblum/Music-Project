current brings fire - fire brings ice
the constant whirling of the machines
visions from the inverted universe
surges of current through your bones
mind waves lost in the grid, there is no way home
current brings fire - fire brings ice
dark light of the volcanic dawn approaches
walk amongst the stone and metal hydras
hanted hawks of the event horizon
these coils will emit fire
there is no escape
now you're lost in the grid
aether winds blast infinity
now your tomb is the grid
all drowning for eternity
