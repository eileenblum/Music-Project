without these invisible chains?
that path was never taken
penniless broken deathbed
hopeless prayer of tesla
teleforce
conductor
phenomenon
disturbance
chained to the final word system
deathray transmission
hidden hands from the future
war of currents
force of motion
man as machine
cosmic destiny
maimed by the final world system
deathrays ressurection
devoured by the past
man will always be in the shadow of its own beast
fate will bring about the terrestrial convulsion
