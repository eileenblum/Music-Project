a mockery
this suffering is a remedy for the dullness
ritual void for cave life
parallel life of the stimulated
reincarnated storms
waves of truth
quest for the ocean
weary of this wavering world
a solitary path of seeking
the next moment of majesty
the tallest forest
unveiled
as I step inside the night
petrified moments
reincarnated storms
waves of truth
quest for the ocean
everything eliminated
luciferian infiltration
tree of life tied to roots of inner earth
