Severed veins, I knew it all along
Sorrow, failure
Return of the icicles
3rd equinox and many long days to come
Ugly bullets, scammed by commitment
Forest of ashes, unleashes the hex
I sharpen my tongue for many long days to come
Burnt flesh, claustrophobic room
Crushed insect, revealing of the turncoat
Five five's deep in the march to the coffin
Abandonment, death to yesterday
Betrayed, death to retrospect
Blood is nothing but the fluid of heart and hate
This knife you stuck in my back is mine to keep
One day you'll see it in my hand in your sleep
....but it will take a lot more than that to kill me
