I have fled to the outermost realms to hone my senses
The wolf alive inside the current
Let the abyss be my solitary superior
Raised by the Wolves, in droves we follow the scent of blood
The order of the wilderness under the ancient sun
I am the sacred predator
The wolf in me brought forth
We are the scarce, in true obscurity we are feared
Feel the gash of my defiant will
Not god by chaos hears the prayer
