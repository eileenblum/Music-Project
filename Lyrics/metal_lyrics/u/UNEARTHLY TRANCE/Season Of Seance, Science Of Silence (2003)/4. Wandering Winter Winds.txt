Hail inevitable solstice
Winter circle, guard of the moon
Tides of ice, shield of the frigid star
Under the cloadk of tundram the temperature plummets
Monochrome visions of the artic
Season of seance, science of silence
Lifeless soil, lion persevers
Inexorable distance, cold blood sanctuary under the cloak...
The sound of nothingness
Deafening roars of wandering winter winds
I bid the sun farewell as it flees from the cursed sphere
Numb bones, painless in hibernation
