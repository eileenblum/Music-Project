I won't suffocate in a hollow voice
that is just a pretty face with
a hole to avoid
Laugh at her guts in revenge
just to calm my nerves
i don't do "assimilations"
I won't speak to your kind
(keep in mind)
Let the sacrifice fester
cast aside the deathray
a shredded negative
on the floor of a meaningless
(meaningless)
sanctuary of the undead
Bold intrusion
Mold and confusion
Cold persuasive delusion
made me spit on the last ember
She's choking and it don't
phase me
She keeps crawling
back to a cadaver
Her cadaver
You get what you want.
