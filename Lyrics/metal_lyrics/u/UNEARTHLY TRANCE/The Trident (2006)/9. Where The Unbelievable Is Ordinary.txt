This is where the unbelievable
is ordinary
I crawled right inside
Made 418 branches
out of 3 lines
Saw the lights in the sky
and left
but it was all the smoke
that chocked me up
travelling inside cemeteries
without a light
speak the word of the "sun"
without fear
the frowns and fears melt like ice
in a crowded chamber
I talk to myself when you are
looking
I take words and dissect them
into numbers
You lose something with the thought
but gain trillions with
slaughter house comedy
The foul fowl swoops
down on the robotic river
I own something that left me
and returned once again
the thrill of addiction
is lost down in hurricane country
Who cares when you have
to plant mines for a dollar?
Will you be reading "the book"
while drinking up the
salt water?
Searching for words that
I haven't found.
