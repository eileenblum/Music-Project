It all leads to that unexpected
coma canyon
All rooms are filled with liars
and there is always a misplaced
stolen shotgun somewhere
the hourglass emits the
stench of panic
Black lung, black coffin
massive energy swirls
inside the vortex
unconscious, consciousness
a psychedelic broadcast
to the anti Christ inside
the amplifier
It all leads to that unexpected
coma canyon
Nihilism nosedive
into the pitch black aeon
Hallucination omen
Elixir vehicle
In self, infinite
Human lesson
Human lesson.
