Let all matter decay
so the filthy horde can starve
Serve them all justice.
let them all kiss their death machine.
If will is delirium then a shield is oblivion
Stars of the dead future.
Super nova addiction.
Truth is cancer that I need.
Conspiracy is the seed.
Hell falls violently (finally).
Permanent ice speaks volumes...

But first the meltdown must come
followed by sacrificial slaughter
depraved in dead century.
The floods will drown their bodies followed by the end of the calendar
before the end exterior vision of the inferior spirits.
Antarctica awaits.
