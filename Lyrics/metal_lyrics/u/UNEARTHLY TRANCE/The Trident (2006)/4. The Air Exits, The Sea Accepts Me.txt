Peer into the rift
which ressonates with the dead silence
I live for the day that I die
in the eyes of the watchers.
Carefully I fall overboard
faithlessly swimming
in the treacherous waters
where I once safely
navigated.
I denounce the world in my insomnia
trace my finger over the braille like
glacial lashes
A brain soaked with the wines
of a salesman
But who is selling the black medal
of drowning to who?
I saw it all!
But I remember nothing
but a sea spider and its
eminence
8 appendages hold a quill
with the ink of the devil fish
Writing on the walls of dead cities
in illuminating code
Beating the life out of the life
sink my body sink
The air exits, the sea accepts me.
