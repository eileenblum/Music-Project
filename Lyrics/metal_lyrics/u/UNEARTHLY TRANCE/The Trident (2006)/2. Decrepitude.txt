Fast forward those eyes
To see decreptitude
And make sure you don't need
a clock to tell the time
Witness the corpse
prepare for something real
Rewind your mind
to the last time you died
Who were you? Did you have the will?
I call every last one of your bluffs
The golden horse will become a corpse
Lay down your cards you cowards
So take some advice
Smoke yourself awake (if you must)
Write yourself into sleep if you can
but make sure you can stomach the blood
take your first shot like
it's your last.
