Visions from yesterdays
have materialized in the first corridor
Disease greets us from the vacuum
and the rats are floating in the holy waters
Run for your death
and sleep for your survival
The holy synthetics
Vague! Levitation! Recollection!

The glaring alarm of the
orange midnights

Putrid green poison seeping
through the cracks
end of the hallway is a
decaying white light
Drink up the extinction spirits
and clench your weapon
Sell me nothing and empty your
pockets
Hands behind your back
and lead me to the arsenal
Psychic battalions will disperse
to the north
Southern grips and swamps
have exchanged retinas
This is an ode to where I come from
Location is everything in purgatory
"That smell, can't you smell that smell"
