The birds of prey 
Will watch and wait in silence 
There is no avoiding 
What you can't see coming 
Swirling in the Great Cauldron 
Meticulous, maniacal monstrosity 
Until the last bone is picked clean 
Vultures are the new gods 
There is no evading 
When you are frozen with fear 
Swirling in the Great Cauldron 
Controlling, constricting, conforming 
Sized up and broken down 
Another corpse thrown into the pile 
Poisoned the promised feast 
Soiled souls writhe in the ether 
The warning came, but no one took heed 
The blade is ready to fall on our necks 
Black clouds float in a rank atmosphere 
The warning came, but no one took heed
