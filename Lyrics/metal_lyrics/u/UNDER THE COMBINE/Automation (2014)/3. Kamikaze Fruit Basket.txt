Now hold your breath as everything begins to fade into the depths of your cold dead heart.
The words you speak are just a fabrication of the web you weave.

How can you live within a shell with no light and that overbearing smell?
Where your hand is your only friend.
Searching for an end but all you found was Hell.
How does it feel to know, you fucking suck at life?

Where is the line drawn? A prosthetic smile and these depressing sing-a-longs

Walk down the road. Don't cross the street.
And now that you're gone, the world will live on

You've never had integrity. The blood we shed builds the foundation of the bed we lay.

Although you're gone, the world will live on

Thanks to nacroskey for sending track #3 lyrics.
