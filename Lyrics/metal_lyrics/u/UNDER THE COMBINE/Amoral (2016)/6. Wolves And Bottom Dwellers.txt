This is an anthem for all wolves and bottom dwellers
Hiding beyond the horizon, all ties left severed
Buzzards swarm ahead
Feasting upon all of our expendable assets
If time is money and money is everything, we have nothing left
There is no mourning for a dying world
No sympathy for the dead
We will not stop to rest our eyes, only once our pockets are fed
We roam the ruins in our tattered cloaks
We wear our tired on our sleeves
There is no telling how far we'll go with no summit in sight to reach
This is the farthest our eyes have ever seen
Look out to the gallows and execute our life's meaning
Execute life
All work and no prosperity
We were never fed with a silver spoon
For silver would only weaken our heart
Stay grounded. Never to forget where we once made our start
We are amoral and we will do whatever it takes
Whether it's wrong or if it's right
From the bottom we will rise
All work and no prosperity
Keeps the dogs at bay
All work and no prosperity
Leaves us pushing through everyday
We're giving up everything to ensure we don't become the prey
