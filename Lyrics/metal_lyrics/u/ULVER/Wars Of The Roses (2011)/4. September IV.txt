the family is gathering
in silent prayer

before the bed
where he is laid out

beautiful in black
and closed eyes

only a boy
and a brother

and a lover
and a son

his sudden
and violent death

leaving us without words
and looking away

from the mother
and the father

left alone to go through
a great grief forever

Vegard in memoriam
