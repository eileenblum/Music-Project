how did we end
so far out

past praying
and past recall

to believe in nothing
is a faith in itself

a lighthouse
in the eye of the storm

the nightmare
of the nightmare

to follow the signal
of a ghost ship

our names are
written in water

the knowledge
is all around us

we came here
to be washed away
