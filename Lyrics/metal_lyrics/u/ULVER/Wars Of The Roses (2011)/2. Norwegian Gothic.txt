this is a history
of pride and romance

such an eerie fantasy
when you think about it

sins of our fathers
their land and nature

amusement and abuse
in the old farm house

the good wishes
in black and white

photos of ghosts
and the family tree

in a circle of fire
traditions dance

maidens to the altar
of milk and honey

slaughtered goats
fucking in the woods

the blood runs deep
this is our heritage
