Nu har han ey meer sin Drackt
Saa rÃ¸d som Viin &amp; Blod
Fro Viin &amp; Blod vaer paa hans Haand
Ved SÃ¦ngen der han stood
Hos Liiget aff sin elskede
Dend Stund man fandt de to

No more he wore his constume
Red as bloode &amp; wine
For wine &amp; bloode was on his hands
As he stoode by her bed and corpse
When the two of them were found
