Science - The new aristocracy
Progress - The world is on the march
Why shouldn't it turn too?
It's the vision of numbers.
We are moving towards the Spirit.
Certainly deserted: It's the voice of the oracle, what I say.
Understand, and not knowing how to express myself without using hidden words.
I prefer to remain silent

[original excerpt from Arthur Rimbaud's "Bad Blood"]
Science! The new nobility! Progress. The world progresses!
Why shouldn't it turn as well?
It's the vision of numbers. We advance towards the Spirit.
It's quite certain: it's oracular, what I say. 
I know, and unaware how to express myself without pagan words, I'd rather be mute
