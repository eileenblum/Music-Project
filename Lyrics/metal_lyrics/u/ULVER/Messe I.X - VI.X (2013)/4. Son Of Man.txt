Oh Father
Heavenly Father
Forgive Me
For I Have Sinned
Against your Word
In Sadness and Joy 
In Rainbow Light
And the Dark Woods
Childhood Haunts
The Twilight of my Life
The Heart Stops
Without Warning
The Destruction of the Temple
The Broken Home
Oh Father
We Are Defined
By Our Blood 
The Massacre of the Innocents
And the Sacrifice of the Son
What Kind of Choir
Of Angels will Receive us
