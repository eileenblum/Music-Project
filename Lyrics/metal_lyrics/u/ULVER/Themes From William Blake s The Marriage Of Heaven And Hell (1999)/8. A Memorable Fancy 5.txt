[plates 22-24]
Once I saw a Devil in a flame of fire. Who arose before an angel that sat
on a cloud, and the devil utter'd these words: 'The worship of God is:
honouring His gifts in other men. Each according to his genius, and loving
the greatest men best: those who envy or caluminate great men hate God;
for there is no other God, ' The angel hearing this became almost blue,
but mastering himself grew yellow.&amp; at last white, pink,&amp; smiling, and
then replied: 'Thou idolater, is not God one? &amp; Is not He visible in
Jesus Christ? And has not Jesus Christ given his sanction to the law of
ten commandments, and are not all other men fools, sinners &amp; nothings? '
The devil answer'd: 'Bray a fool in a mother with wheat. Yet shall not his
folly be beaten out of him; if Jesus Christ is the greatest man, you ought
to love him in the greatest degree; now hear how He has given His sanction
to the law of ten commandments: did He not mock at the Sabbath, and so
mock the sabbath's god? Murder those who were murdered because of Him?
Turn away the law from the woman taken in adultery? Steal the labour of
others to support him? Bear false witness when He omitted making a defence
before Pilate? Covet when He pray'd for His disciples, and when He bid
them shake off the dust of their feet against such as refused to lodge
them? I tell you, no virtue can exist without breaking these ten
commandments. Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse, not from
rules! When He had so spoken, I beheld the angel who stretched out his
arms, embracing the flame of fire &amp; he was consumed and arose as Elijah.
Note: this angel who is now become a devil, is my particular friend; we
often read the bible together in its infernal or diabolical sense which
the world shall have if they behave well. I have also the bible of hell,
which the world shall have whether they will or no. One law for the lion &amp;
ox is oppression.
