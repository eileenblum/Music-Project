[plates 6-7]
As I was walking among the fires of hell, delighted with the enjoyment of
genius, which to angels look like torment and insanity, I collected some
of their proverbs: thinking that as the saying used in a nation mark its
character. So the proverbs of hell shew the nature of infernal wisdom
better than any description of buildings or garments. When I came home: on
the abyss of the five senses, where a flat sided steep frowns over the
present world, I saw a mighty Devil folded in black clouds, hovering on
the sides of rock, with corroding fires He wrote the following sentence
now perceived by the minds of men &amp; read by them on earth: how do you know
bu ev'ry bird that cuts the airy way, is an immense world of delight,
clos'd by your senses five?
