In the year of the Lord
The word became flesh
But our bodies now
Will bleed as before
Nothing has changed
Since the late sixties

We all must carry
Rosemary's baby
Helter skelter

On the surface of the Moon
A heart of darkness
Let it bleed
Inside yourself
For your father
All the way alive
Inside Golden Gate
There used to be a house
At 6114 California St.

Helter skelter
