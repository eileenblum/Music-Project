Legends fail
And houses fall
In great shame
In elliptical ruins

A king gouges his eyes out
Forbidden love takes poison

Tragedies repeat themselves
In perfect circle
Wrong, wrong, wrong
(As in death)

As Colossus stands
So shall Rome
When Colossus falls
Rome shall fall
When Rome falls
So falls the world
