Gone, is the black horizon
But not the images of passed time
Dead are the many brave warriors
Who fought by my side
Who fought by my side

Now as i carve the names in stone
Of those who dies so far from home
I mean for these words to bring them pride
As time will pass, their deeds will never die

Accept this gift of eternal remembrance
For the courageous and bold
Thor, give these runes your blessing
As time will unfold
As time will unfold

Now as i carve the names in stone
Of those who dies so far from home
I mean for these words to bring them pride
As time will pass their deeds will never die....
