Religious filth, spreading like the plague
Bombs and prayers
The damage you've done, will not be gone
In a thousand years

The world had been a captive
I bring you

Destruction,hatred and terror
You will bleed for me
Destruction,hatred and terror
You children will burn

I laugh at your faith, you are all the same
Maggots of God
Prophets and priests, and their fascist beliefs
Will be torn apart

The world will be mine again

Destruction,hatred and terror
You will bleed for me
Destruction,hatred and terror
You children will burn
