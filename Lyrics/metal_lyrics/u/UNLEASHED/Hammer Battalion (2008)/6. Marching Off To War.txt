Free from their boundaries and chains
We march for revenge again
With our legions prepared by our side
To fight, to live and to die
The hour of truth is here
So we rise to the challenge everywhere
Marching off to war
Join or fall!

Behold as we march off to war
Cities shall burn and fall

Nothing can stop us now
By the hammer of Thor they shall bow
For the masters of art have returned
Our enemies' flag will be burned

The hour of truth is here
So we rise to the challenge everywhere
Marching off to war
Join or fall!

Behold as we march off to war
Cities shall burn and fail
