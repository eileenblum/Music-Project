Oppressing the poor, mocking the sick
Crusader of virtues, your holy fire lit
Blessed be the ones who will not fight
Against the words of the moral tyrant's might

The empty prayers of absolution that dies
Obedient souls bow to the passion of the Christ

The passion of the Christ
The greatest of all lies
The greatest of all lies

The Christian values a marketing game
Through holy wars and terror in your name
Upon this rock your church has been built
For all mankind, to live in fear and guilt
The empty prayers of absolution that dies
Obedient souls bow to the passion of the Christ

The passion of the Christ
The greatest of all lies
The greatest of all lies

Nailed to the cross, as death sets in
The blood of Christ spilled for all human sins

The great illusion of his final sigh
Obedient souls bow to the passion of the Christ

The passion of the Christ
The greatest of all lies
The greatest of all lies

My God, why hast thou forsaken me?
