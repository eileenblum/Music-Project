Common man you make me sick with hate
Nothing about you is real
Talk in circles to avoid the truth
All the things you must conceal
Prove your point just once and I'll give in
All the crap you need to say
Point your finger at us, brave like few
Standing safely miles away

I want you dead
I want you dead

Sacred son of yet an ugly bitch
Comprehension ain't your game
Christian looks - it is the look of your face
Lack of knowledge is your name
As i vomit in your general direction
Tears are falling as you flee
Walk the roads without a spark
I'll help you die as charity

I want you dead
I want you dead
So fucking dead
