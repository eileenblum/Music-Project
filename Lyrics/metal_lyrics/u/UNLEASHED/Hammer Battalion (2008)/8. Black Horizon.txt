Towards a black horizon
Our brothers are avenged, the battle is won
The longships set sail in the night
On the raging sea, with the stars as guide

Thoughts of those we could not sail,
The wounds i received and blows i gave
The darkness before my eyes
The freezing wind that chills my spine

Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon

The waves that clashes to the side
The hunger and pain i must survive
Still i can feel the smell
Of my enemies blood and hear their cries for help
A glance from an axe blade shines
As memory of those i slayed this time
Long is our voyage at sea
To Birka shores, to the land of the free

Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon

Thor, give me the strength
Like so many times before
Thor, give me the power
To bring us home to Birka shores
I raise my hammer in honour
Of those who'll never come home
I swear an oath to their fathers
I carve their names in stone

Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon
Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon
