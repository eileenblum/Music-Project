Politicians and employers
Lack of needed future knowledge
Protectionism is what they grow
Scared to death by the things we know

Never fall into their trap
Never buy their empty crap
Their institutions will fail
Our way of life prevail

The new breed that won't be led
Warriors of Midgard
we define the road ahead
Warriors of Midgard

Society of imitation
No place of innovation
Vassals of conformity
Want to end individuality
It's a zombie's dance all the way
And become just another prey
Their institutions will fail
Our way of life prevail

The new breed that won't be led
Warriors of Midgard
we define the road ahead
Warriors of Midgard
The new breed that won't be led
Warriors of Midgard
