Nature stands erected
The season of the Sun
Gather around the stones
The time for blot has come

Light the fires of the north
Bring forth the goblets
A toast to our fortune
To Freya, Frey and fortune

Come lust for ecstasy
Unleash the seal of man
Come lust for ecstasy
It is Midsummer's Eve

Morbid spirits rising
Essence of the night
They sing a song of blasphemy
The demons dance tonight

Light the fires of the north
Bring forth the goblets
A toast to our fortune
To Freya, Frey and fortune

Come lust for ecstasy
Unleash the seal of man
Come lust for ecstasy
It is Midsummer's Eve
