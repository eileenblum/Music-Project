Onward pounding war machine
The hammer battalion Unleashed
Warheads armed with nuclear hate
Using humans as our bait

The order is to kill
Fire at will
The order is to kill
Fire at will
Hammer battalion Unleashed

Smashing through like rabid hounds
Walls they built fall to the ground
Those who oppose is flee or die
Death is marching on our side

The order is to kill
Fire at will
The order is to kill
Fire at will
Hammer battalion Unleashed

Join the battalion!
