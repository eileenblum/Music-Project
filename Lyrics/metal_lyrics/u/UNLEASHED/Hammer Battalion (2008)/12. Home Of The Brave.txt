As Gungir has beed thrown
Over the battle field
Brynhilde chooses her price
Among those with sword and shield

Home of the brave
Home of the brave
Where Odin awaits
Preparing for the final day

In the blood of every warrior
In the heart of honest men
In the souls of those who are dying
There is comfort at the end

Home of the brave
Home of the brave
Where Odin awaits
Preparing for the final day

....home of the brave

Welcome to Valhalla!
