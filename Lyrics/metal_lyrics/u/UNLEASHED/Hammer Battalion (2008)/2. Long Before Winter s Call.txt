Now it came to pass in those days
There went out a decree
From Caesar on his throne
That all the world should be enrolled

So Joseph took Mary to the balls
And from Nazareth they went
To the city of Bethlehem
For registration and taxing, right on then

The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call
The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call

And it came to pass, while they were there
That she was great with child
Lived in a stable 'til it was done
She brought forth her bastard son

And as the shepherds in the field
Were keeping watch over their flocks at night
An angel of the lord
Said unto them a saviour has been born

The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call
The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call
