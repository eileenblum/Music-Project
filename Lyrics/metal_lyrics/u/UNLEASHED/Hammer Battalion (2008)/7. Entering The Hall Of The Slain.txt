Burning illness deep within
Demons haunt my every breath
All the years in agony
Staring into the eyes of death
....into the eyes of death
The time that was given to me
Alone with the thoughts some would dread
Staring into the eyes of death

Entering the hall of the slain
Entering the hall of the slain

I fear no God
I fear no pain
As my time has come
Entering the hall of the slain

Leave it all behind me now
Soil, wind and fire
No regrets as i bid farewell
Valkyries, come take me higher!
....come take me higher
The hour has struck for me
At the end of my conscious desire
So come, come take me higher....

Entering the hall of the slain
Entering the hall of the slain

I fear no God
I fear no pain
As my time has come
Entering the hall of the slain

Open wide the gates of Valhalla!
