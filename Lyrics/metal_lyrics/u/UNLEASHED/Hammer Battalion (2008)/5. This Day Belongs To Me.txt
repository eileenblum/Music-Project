Through mist and shadows dim
Stained with life ever so grim
Timeless travails in the utter dark
In the valleys of death i have walked

Now, is my time!

Odin, set me free
This day belongs to me

Face down in piles of human dirt
Endless pain that doesn't hurt
Torn apart yet physically whole
By the filth of man nothing grows

Now, is my time!
Odin, set me free
This day belongs to me
