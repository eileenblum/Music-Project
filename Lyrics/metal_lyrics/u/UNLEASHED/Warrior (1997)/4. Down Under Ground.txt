THIS IS THE STORY ABOUT
A YOUNG MAN WHO DIED
WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS
TO FIGHT BACK
HE PUT HIS PRIDE
IN A PLANT SO GREEN
HE STARTED SUCKIN'
HIS OWN BLOOD...

COWARD... ARE YOU
A MAN OR A MOUSE - JUNKIE?

DOWN, DOWN, HE WENT
DOWN UNDER GROUND
DOWN UNDER GROUND

WELL HE GREW UP
JUST LIKE YOU AND ME
HAD HIS DREAMS
BUT HE JUST COULDN'T SEE
WHY HIS LIFE WAS
FULL OF PAIN... AND MISERY
HE CHOSE THE EASY WAY
AND ESCAPED FROM IT ALL
HELF MAN - HALF MOUSE -
A COWARD!
HE STARTED TAKING THEM
WHITE LITTLE PILLS

(HE WAS ON HIS WAY...)
DOWN, DOWN, HE WENT
DOWN UNDER GROUND
DOWN UNDER GROUND

THE YEARS PASSED BY
AND THE SPRING CAME
HE WAS AS GONE
AS THE "SNOW" THAT DAY
WHEN HE FIRST TRIED
HEROIN...
SO HE GREW OLD
BUT HE WAS JUST A BOY
FOR POLITICIANS
HE BECAME A TOY
HE LOST HIS PRIDE
TO A PLANT SO GREEN

COWARD... !
DOWN, DOWN, HE WENT
DOWN UNDER GROUND
DOWN UNDER GROUND

COWARD... !
DOWN, DOWN, HE WENT
DOWN UNDER GROUND
DOWN UNDER GROUND
