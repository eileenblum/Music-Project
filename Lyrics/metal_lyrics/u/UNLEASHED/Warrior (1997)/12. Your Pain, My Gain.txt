[Music - Anders / Johnny]
[Lyrics - Anders]

YOUR PAIN - MY GAIN

SO MUCH HATRED
TOWARDS MAN
A TRUE PSYCHO
YES I AM
I WILL FEED YOU
WITH FAKE TRUST
BUT YOU'LL MEET MY
MORBID LUST

YOUR PAIN - MY GAIN

NOW I'VE GOT YOU
ON YOUR KNEES
AND I'LL USE YOU
AS I PLEASE
WHEN I KILL YOU
PEACE OF MIND
A LIFE TAKEN
I FEEL FINE
