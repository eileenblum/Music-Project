[Music - Fredrik]
[Lyrics - Fredrik]

THE WORLD IS OLD AND TIRED
IN MY DREAMS I SEE THE END
NOW I SEE THINGS CLEARER
I WILL NOT BE CONDEMNED

MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
...THE END

THE SUN HAS SOON BURNED OUT
THE SIGNS ARE THERE TO BE SEEN
THE STARS ARE FALLING DOWN
THE ONLY GOD IS ME

MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
...THE END

THE SOULLESS CHILD IS BORN
IN MY DREAMS I SEE THE END
THEY WHISPER IN MY HEAD
THE WORLD WILL BE CONDEMNED

MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
...THE END
...THE END
...THE END
