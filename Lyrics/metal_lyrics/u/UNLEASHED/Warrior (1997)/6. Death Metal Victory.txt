...DEATH METAL VICTORY

ALL OF THOSE WHO TRIED TO MAKE US STOP
THEY MUST ALL BE MADE OF CLAY
TRIED SO MANY TIMES WITH NO RESULT
YET ME GET STRONGER EVERY DAY
LIE TO MEDIA BEHIND OUR BACKS
ANY GAME YOU LIKE TO PLAY
ANY CHALLENGE YOU HAVE, WE ACCEPT
DEATH METAL IS HERE TO STAY

MY WARRIORS SCREAM FOR ME -
DEATH METAL VICTORY

BORN OF HATRED TO SOCIETY
WE HAVE RISEN UP TO FIGHT
LIKE A NEVER ENGING WARMACHINE
WITH HEARTS OF FIRE &amp; METAL MIGHT
WE DON'T NEED TO FIT INTO YOUR WORLD
AND WE DON'T NEED YOUR ADVICE
LISTEN BUDDY DON'T YOU PUSH YOUR LUCK
IF YOU WANT TO STAY ALIVE

MY WARRIORS SCREAM FOR ME -
DEATH METAL VICTORY

MY WARRIORS SCREAM FOR ME -
DEATH METAL VICTORY

REPEAT VERSE 1

MY WARRIORS SCREAM FOR ME -
DEATH METAL VICTORY
