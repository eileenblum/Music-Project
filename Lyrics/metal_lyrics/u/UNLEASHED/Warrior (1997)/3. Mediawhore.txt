[Lyrics - Johnny]

MEDIAWHORE...

JUST ANOTHER FACE
ON THE TV-SCREEN
WHAT A SAD EXCUSE
FOR A HUMAN BEING

YOU'RE A MEDIAWHORE
WITH COCAINE UP YOUR ASS
A MEDIAWHORE

JUST ANOTHER NAME
IN THE EVENING PRESS
SPEAKING FOR THE POOR
BUT YOU COULDN'T CARE LESS

MEDIAWHORE...

POSING LIKE A FOOL
FOR JUST ANY BRAND
COS' WHEN MONEY CALLS
YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN

YOU'RE A MEDIAWHORE
WITH COCAINE UP YOUR ASS
A MEDIAWHORE

PREACHING FOR THE TRUTH
THAT THEIR COUNTRY IS FOR SALE
A LIBERALIST ON CRACK
JUST ANOTHER WHORE FACE

MEDIAWHORE...

SAID YOU SPOKE TO GOD
BUT SPERM WAS ALL YOU GOT
WHEN YOU SUCKED YOUR WAY
RIGHT UP TO THE TOP

YOU'RE A MEDIAWHORE
WITH COCAINE UP YOUR ASS
A MEDIAWHORE

PULLED ANOTHER JOKE
TOLD ANOTHER LIE
ONE WAY CONVERSATION
TIL' THE DAY YOU DIE
