[Music - Johnny]
[Lyrics - Johnny]

WE TRAVELLED FAR
ON THIS PATH OF WAR
WHERE BRAVE WARRIORS
FROM TOWN TO TOWN
FROM LAND TO LAND
JOINED TO FIGHT
(MY LIFE FOR YOU)

YOU HEARD THE CALL
AND MARCHED TO WAR
BRAVE WARRIORS
YOU STOOD SO STRONG
RIGHT BY OUR SIDE
THROUGH STORM AND RAIN
(MY LIFE FOR YOU)

YOU STAYED ALL TRUE
THROUGH THE WINDS OF CHANGE
BRAVE WARRIORS
DEATH METAL PRIDE
DON'T WASH AWAY
LEGIONS OF HATE -
(MY LIFE FOR YOU)
