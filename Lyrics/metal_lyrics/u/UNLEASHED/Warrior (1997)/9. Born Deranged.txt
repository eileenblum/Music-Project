[Music - Johnny]
[Lyric - Johnny]

BOMBS GO OFF AND SHAKE THE GROUND
RADIATION ALL AROUND
IT DOESN'T SMELL, IT DOESN'T SOUND
ALL SURVIVED OR SO IT SEEMS
ANOTHER NUCLEAR LIFE BEGINS
A CHILD IS BORN WITH TWISTED LIMBS

BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED

BORN A MUTANT SO DERANGED
CANNOT SEE IT'S PARENTS FACE
CANCER INSIDE GROWING PAIN
COUGHING BLOOD, THE DAYS GO BY
ORGANS SLOWLY BURN INSIDE
ALIVE DECAYING, HOPE TO DIE

BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED

BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED

BORN DERANGED OUR PRICE TO PAY
FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION'S AIM -
TO LEAD THE MARKET'S "HALL OF SHAME"
FACE THE FACT: IT'S JUST A PART
OF UNITED STATES OF EUROPE'S START -
THIS LITTLE "GIFT" FROM JACQUES CHIRAC

BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED
