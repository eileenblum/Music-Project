[Music - Johnny]
[Lyrics - Johnny]

I URGE YOU TO BE BRAVE
BE STRONG AND FACE IT
STAND UP AND FIGHT LIKE A MAN

BE A WARMACHINE
WARMACHINE
WARMACHINE

DON'T LET THEM GRIND YOU DOWN
RISE UP AND CHARGE 'EM
FIGHT BACK AND NEVER GIVE IN

BE A WARMACHINE
WARMACHINE
WARMACHINE

WARMACHINE
WARMACHINE
WARMACHINE

SO HOLD ON TO YOUR PRIDE
BE WHAT YOU ARE AND...
SHOW THEM A WARRIORS WRATH

BE A WARMACHINE
WARMACHINE
WARMACHINE
