[Music - Johnny]
[Lyrics - Johnny]

YOU PRAY THE LORD TO SAVE
SAVE YOUR SOUL FROM HELL
TO KEEP A PLACE IN PARADISE
WHEN YOU DIE IN VAIN

YOU BLOW YOUR GOD IN HEAVEN,
SO THAT HE'LL TAKE YOU HIGHER
YOU BLOW YOUR GOD IN HEAVEN
...I'D RATHER BURN IN HELLFIRE

SO YOU WAN FORGIVENESS
FOR ALL SINS AND CRIMES
WELL, YOU NEVER HAD THE GUTS
TO STAND UP AND PAY THE PRICE

YOU BLOW YOUR GOD IN HEAVEN,
SO THAT HE'LL TAKE YOU HIGHER
YOU BLOW YOUR GOD IN HEAVEN
...I'D RATHER BURN IN HELLFIRE

...IN HELLFIRE

[REPEAT CHORUS - VERSE 1]

[CHORUS]
