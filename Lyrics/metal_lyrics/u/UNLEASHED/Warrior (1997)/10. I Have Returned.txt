[Music - Johnny]
[Lyrics - Johnny]

I HAVE RETURNED
9 HUNDRED YEARS I HAVE WAITED
I HAVE RETURNED
THE TIME IS NOW TO RISE ANEW

HEAR MY CALL
MY WARRIORS COME WITH ME NOW
HEAR MY CALL
MJOLLNIR SHALL GUIDE US THROUGH THE BATTLE

...I HAVE RETURNED

I HAVE THE POWER
TO CRUSH THE FORCES OF DECADENCE
I HAVE THE POWER
TO TAKE BACK WHAT'S RIGHTFULLY MINE

I AM THE NEW AGE
WHERE NATURE REGAINS IT'S STRENGTH
I AM THE NEW AGE
WHERE MAN IS ABOVE ALL GODS

...I HAVE RETURNED
