[Music - Johnny]
[Lyrics -Johnny]

15000 YEARS
THE EXCEPTION OF MANKIND
THE TIME TO LIVE, THE TIME TO DIE
...AGAIN

THE END OF ALL... SOON TO BEGIN
THE COMING OF THE ETERNAL ICE:

RAGNARÂK... RAGNARÂK

YEARS OF WARS
MAN AGAINST MAN
LAKES OF BLOOD... FLOW
BURNING HORIZONS
THE SUN IS BLACK...

RAGNARÂK... RAGNARÂK

15000 YEARS
THE EXCEPTION OF MANKIND
THE TIME TO LIVE, THE TIME TO DIE...
...AGAIN
