Tied up in a moral life, made up like a play
Systematized and tamed
Play a role in every part, never step aside
Too boring and too lame

So you kneel...
And come crawling at my feet
You're dead to me
I'm not the one you seek
You're dead to me

Always living in the past and in lack of words
Searching for a fate
Waiting for the peak of life, it is all a dream
And it's getting much too late
Wake up to another world, all the same but new
The needs you cannot meet
Look around and face the fact, your time is running out
Christ is obsolete

Yet you kneel...
And come crawling at my feet
You're dead to me
I'm not the one you seek
You're dead to me
