The time is up, the dices are cast
So it came to this at last
The words you spoke were all too grand
No turning back you little man
And since you lack common sense
Suffer now the consequence
Suffer the consequence
Suffer the consequence

What you will experience is far beyond hell
So far beyond hell

A second chance you beg for me
Oh, i have ways to set you free
Your praying death comes without pain
Well killing isn't quite my game
I see now that you understand
For you i have this special pain
Suffer the consequence
Suffer the consequence

What you will experience is far beyond hell
So far beyond hell
What you will experience is far beyond hell
So far beyond hell
