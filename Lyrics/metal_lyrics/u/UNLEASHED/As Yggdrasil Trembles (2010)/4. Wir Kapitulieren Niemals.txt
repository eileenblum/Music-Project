Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)

Face the fact here we are
You said we'd never come this far
Viking death metal
Viking death metal
We took you all for a ride
As 20 years were passing by
Viking death metal
Viking death metal

Was andere sagen ist uns scheissegal
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)

Risen from an ancient force
To the hammer we are sworn
Viking death metal
Viking death metal
Listen up and listen fast
We are the future and the past
Viking death metal
Viking death metal

Was andere sagen ist uns scheissegal
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)

All the world against us
The enemy is great
But this is our life, this is our fate
We drink to Odin, we drink to Thor
With swords drawn onward into war

Was andere sagen ist uns scheissegal
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)
