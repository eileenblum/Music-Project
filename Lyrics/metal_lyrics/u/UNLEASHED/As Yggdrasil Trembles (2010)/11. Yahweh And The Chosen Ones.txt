You are a holy people to your god
And god has chosen you, this is your call
For all the earth is mine and you shall be onto me
A kingdom of priests and a holy nation above all

Our king is truth, and nothing else compares
Bow to the holy one
Blessed is he
Now to the holy one
Down on your knees

Praised are you, Lord our God, King of the universe
Who has chosen us out of all the nations on earth
Raised us above all tongues and made us holy
Through his commandments, we are holy from birth

Our king is truth, and nothing else compares
Bow to the holy one
Blessed is he
Now to the holy one
Down on your knees

For god did not make us like the nations of other lands
And did not make us the same as other families of the earth
God did not place us in the same situations as others
And our destiny is not the same as anyone else's

Bow to the holy one
Blessed is he
Now to the holy one
Down on your knees
