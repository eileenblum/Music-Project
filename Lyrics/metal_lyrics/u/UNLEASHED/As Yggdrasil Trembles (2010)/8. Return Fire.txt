You're think we're easy prey
A battle without losses
So load your guns and aim
Come at us anytime
With everything you've got!
Be the next in line (as we...)
Return fire, return fire...

Your chances will decrease
As Odin chooses side
Attack us and you'll see
We were born to fight
No mercy will be given
Target now in sight
Return fire, return fire...

Battalions lock and load
Guns ready, aim, fire!
Battalions on my command
Guns ready, aim, fire!

We rise against you all
In every town and nation
Until you flee or fall
The warriors of the brave
Now standing firm and strong
Will win or die this day
Return fire, return fire...

Better listen fast
This is our final warning
You cannot hope to last
Against the rapid fire
From one of our battalions
There will be no survival...
Return fire, return fire...

Battalions lock and load
Guns ready, aim, fire!
Battalions on my command
Guns ready, aim, fire!
