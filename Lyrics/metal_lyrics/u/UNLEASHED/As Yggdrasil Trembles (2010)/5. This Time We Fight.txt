So many years
He struggled hard
And stood against the oppression
He saw the fall
Of all his kin
In a dark premonition

As the battle rages
Will this be his day to die?
He holds his hammer toward the sky
This time we fight!

Now is the day
For the justice
So rightfully claimed
He called to arms
Sharpened his axe
And put on his chain
The call to rise
And be strong
As the hour grows near
A blot to Thor
For protection
And against all fear

As the battle rages
Will this be his day to die?
He holds his hammer toward the sky
This time we fight!
He holds his hammer toward the sky
This time we fight!
