I rule the living
I claim the dead
Bringer of good and evil
As mankind will be led
I tame the winds of time
And decide all fate
The creator of purpose
Teacher of the ways

I am the master - master of the ancient art
I am the master - master of the ancient art

I am the warrior
Of the glory and the might
Tyr armed me with his sword
For the battle of life
I rule the kingdom of beasts
Oppose me and fall
Behold the most vicious animal
Of them all

I am the master - master of the ancient art
I am the master - master of the ancient art
