All that was the past
Comes to an end
Survive and evolve
Or die again
The hour of change
So definite in sight
Indiscriminately
The unprepared will die

So it begins
The unprepared will die

It is the dawn of truth
And it dominates
Like a pestilence
With no cure but fate
Rejuvenating death
The seeds of a new time
Induscriminately
The unprepared will die

So it begins
The unprepared will die
So it begins
The unprepared will die

It is the dawn of truth
...as Yggdrasil trembles...
