What troubles the earth, wind and sea
What powers will be unleashed
Is the age of mankind soon gone
Are we prepared for what will come
Whatever stirs beyond the dark has no shame
Nothing will ever be the same

Battalions of the world are you ready?
For the lasting cold and the darkness
Battalions of the world are you ready?

What will the future hold
What horrors are yet to unfold
Is this our way to Odin's hall
Are we prepared for the final call
Whatever stirs beyond the dark has no shame
Nothing will ever be the same

Battalions of the world are you ready?
For the lasting cold and the darkness
Battalions of the world are you ready?
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
Battalions of the world are you ready?

Our loyalty will be tested
Allegiance to Midgard we have sworn
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
We stand to face the new dawn

Battalions of the world are you ready?
For the lasting cold and the darkness
Battalions of the world are you ready?
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
Battalions of the world are you ready?
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
Battalions of the world are you ready?
