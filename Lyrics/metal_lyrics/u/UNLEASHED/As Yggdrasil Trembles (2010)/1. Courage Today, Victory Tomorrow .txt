At the ends of all things
Behold what nature brings
For what comes on the final day
You must be brave

Oh heed my call!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!

The great war of our time
Gods and men side by side
Like in the past as they fell
Some must survive to tell
The old tales without end
The legacy passed on again
In a new time, a new place
We shall live the ancient way

Oh heed my call!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!

Oh heed my call!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!

...and so it begins...
