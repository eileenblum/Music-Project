O taste the goodness
Of our god
And eat his flesh
And drink his blood
Come and partake
In the gospel feast
Be saved from sin
And feel at peace

Embrace the holy communion!
Eat - this is my body
Drink - this is my blood

Give not that which a holy
To the dogs
Honour me as i die
Don't share me with hogs
