In a world of black and white
His colours blazed
A heart that burned like a thousand fires
With the passion to create
Every day a new challenge
Was taken by storm
Not a chance for a dampened spirit
As new ideas were born

I think you know...
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar

All against the odds as trouble came
But no task to great
Gave us courage to stand the ground
Put no trust in fate
A true warrior, yes he was
Right until the end
In the halls of Valhalla
We shall meet again

I think you know...
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar
