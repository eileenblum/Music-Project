Demons gather slowly around this city of hell
The zombies are dancing in the moonlight
A feast for all you sinners of joy and blasphemy
The evil armies attack to night

We'll come for you
We'll come for you
We'll come for you
Ain't nothing you can do

A morbid angel signs with demented voice
The orchs are pounding the drums of doom and night
Men and ghouls with blackened eyes and faces deranged
The evil armies attack to night

We'll come for you
We'll come for you
We'll come for you
Ain't nothing you can do
We'll come for you
We'll come for you
We'll come for you
Ain't nothing you can do
