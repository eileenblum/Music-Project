Your head is mine
With my choice of wine

I want your body and I want your flesh
I plunge the dagger in oh what a mess
I cannot stand and wait for you to die
Your body drenched in blood I'll eat you dead or alive
I feast on young ones and I feast on the old
I just gut'em up and spice'em then fold...
You are my evening dinner can't you see
I've got this special taste in humans I feed

Your head is mine
With my choice of wine
Your head is mine
With my choice of wine

I want your body and I need your flesh
I plunge the dagger in oh what a mess
I cannot stand and wait for your last cry
Your body drenched in blood I'll eat you dead or alive
I take the young ones and I take'em old
I just gut'em up and spice'em then fold...
You are my evening dinner can't you see
I've got this special taste in humans I feed

Your head is mine
With my choice of wine
Your head is mine
With my choice of wine
