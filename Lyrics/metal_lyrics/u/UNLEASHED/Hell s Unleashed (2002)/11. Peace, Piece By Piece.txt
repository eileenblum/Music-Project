I am the one, the man, the myth with a knife
Destined to take your life
I am Mr. Insane
Now let me taste your pain

I'll cut you piece by piece
Oh man I feeled so pleased
Only death can end this show
Peace for my restless soul

I'm the god and I'm here to seal your fate
You'll suffer my evil hate
I am the Mr. Insane
Killing is just a game

I'll cut you piece by piece
Oh man I feeled so pleased
Only death can end this show
Peace for my restless soul

Peace, piece by piece
