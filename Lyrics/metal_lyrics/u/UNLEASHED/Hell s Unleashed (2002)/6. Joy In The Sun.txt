Wanna go on a date
Gonna have some fun
Pick you up in my new car
Take a ride in the sun
Driving down the boulevard
Headin' down to the beach
Gonna drive real slow now
Grab a hold on me...

(...for some...)
Formaldehyde fun
Joy in the sun
Formaldehyde fun
Joy in the sun

Well then here we go
Rock around the clock
Playin'hide and sick now
She sure knows how to suck
Such a nice little mouth
Drives a man insane
Guess I ain't that dead yet
Taste that smell again...

(...of some...)
Formaldehyde fun
Joy in the sun
Formaldehyde fun
Joy in the sun
