I don't want to be born...

I lay here and wait it this virgin's womb
My pleasure dwells right here within this tomb

I don't want to be born
Don't want to be born
Don't want to be born

Intensive silence, all in blood red
A spawn of hell I am the evil dead

I don't want to be born
Don't want to be born
Don't want to be born
Don't want to be born
Don't want to be born

Do you really want to give me birth?

Don't want to be born
Don't want to be born
Don't want to be born
Don't want to be
