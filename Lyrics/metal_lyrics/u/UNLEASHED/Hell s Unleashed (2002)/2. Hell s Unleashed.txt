Like it or not but we're back again
Hell's Unleashed, yeah all insane
Freakin' hard so fuckin' wild
Join the madness or step aside

Their souls will bleed
Yeah Hell's Unleashed
Their souls will bleed
Yeah Hell's Unleashed

Heaven's hell comes falling down
Hammer of Thor will shake the ground
Cracking amps so wild'n'free
Sons of christ they come for me

Their souls will bleed
Yeah Hell's Unleashed
Their souls will bleed
Yeah Hell's Unleashed

Bangin' heads yeah sick as few
Satan took my soul that's true
Evil live death metal war
Warriors now hear my call

Their souls will bleed
Yeah Hell's Unleashed
Their souls will bleed
Yeah Hell's Unleashed
