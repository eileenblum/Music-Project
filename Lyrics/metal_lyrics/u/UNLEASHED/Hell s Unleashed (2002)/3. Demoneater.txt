Demons haunt my every waking hour
Making life into a living hell
Need to keep it down, I need to end it
Searching for the one thing that can help
Demoneater's there within my reaches
To calm the storm that rages in my head

Demoneater

Demoneater

Walk the streets and all I see are victims
And soon I must give in to all the rage
To kill, destroy and fuckin' rip to pieces
My anger grows and soon it is too late
Flashing pain is tearing at my inside
My soul is sick and all I feel is hate

Demoneater

Demons haunt my every waking hour
Making life into a living hell
Need to keep it down, I need to end it
Searching for the one thing that can help
To calm the storm that rages in my head
