I am the Triggerman
Come make my day
I am the Triggerman
No time to pray
There'll be no last words
No time to cry
There'll be no last words
No time to fly

I am the Triggerman

I am the Triggerman
And you are dead
I am the feeder honey
You eat my lead
It's coming through now
Don't turn around
It's coming through yeah
Just lay right down

I am the Triggerman

I am the Triggerman
Come make my day
I am the Triggerman
No time to pray

I am the Triggerman
I am the Triggerman
