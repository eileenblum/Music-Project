[Music - Fredrik; Lyrics - Johnny]

A life beyond reality, a must to reach the only way out
So distant to this rotten world and I know - it isn't for me
I don't care of what they say, I am myself and live my own way
Like rats they run in life's eternal wheel - but they'll never
get me

Hear the silent whispers, all the talking heads and see all
their fake smiles
Protected by a wall of laws they hide - they dare not face me
Talking in circles to start confusion
(but empty words they fly through my mind)
With all their lies and prophecies they try - but they'll
never get me

... They'll never get me

With staring eyes they follow me
(it seems to be the peak of their lives)
I hate you all, why can't you fuckin' see - you cannot scare
me
Like an image passin' by I see it ends the day that I die
Until then I'll have powers left to fight - they'll never get
me

... They'll never get me

All that's left to say... as I turn away
I hate you all... and I will 'til I fall!!

A life beyond reality, a must to reach the only way out
So distant to this rotten world and I know - it isn't for me
I don't care what they say, I am myself and live my own way
Like rats they run in life's eternal wheel - but they'll never
get me

... They'll never get me
