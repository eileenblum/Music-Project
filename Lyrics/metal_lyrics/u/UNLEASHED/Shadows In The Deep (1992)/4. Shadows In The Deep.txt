[Music - Fredrik; Lyrics - Johnny]

Shadows in the deep, once flesh and blood
Promised to finally see the light
Taking farewell of this life's mortal Hell
Hope to face the master, his blessings to tell
But lost are the souls who gaze into void
In search for a life beyond the grave

Still shadows bleed... eternally

Shadows in the deep, longing for life
Endlessly regretting the search for the light
The mortal life is gone but still shadows bleed
Tortured are the souls from a life without sins
An eternal wait for bodily ecstasy
To revel in lust, anger and greed

Still shadows bleed... eternally

Shadows in the deep, not for man to see
Captured here forever, never to be free
Taking farewell of this life's mortal Hell
Hope to face the master, his blessings to tell
But lost are the souls who gaze into void
In search for a life beyond the grave

Beyond the grave... shadows still bleed... eternally
