[Music - Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

Mindless people without a face
Cannot stand our human race
So they call us left behind
We laugh with pride, stand and fight

Never ending hate

Politicians in the lead
Empty brains they will feed
Never trust'em not a sound
Slay'em down to the ground

Never ending hate

Try to make us compromise
Listen fast simple minds!
No pretending, we don't care
Bangin' heads everywhere

Never ending hate

Try to push us off the way
Here and now is the time to slay -
The lowest form of human life
Are fashion wimps with lying eyes
With crushing power from within
Every battle we shall win
Man of clay say goodbye
We're unleashed step aside!

Never ending hate
