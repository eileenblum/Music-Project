[Music - Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

Silent nights
Under the winter sky
In the land of ice
Where the snow is white
Silent nights
And the northern breeze
In the land of ice
Where my soul is free

...My land of ice

Silent nights
On my ancestors ground
In the land of ice
Where the hooves of Sleipnir pound
Silent nights
And the oath is sworn
In the land of ice
As my son is born

...My land of ice

Silent nights
Where all shadows lay
In the land of ice
Oh, so far away
Silent nights
Where my eyes can see
In the land of ice
I shall rest in peace
