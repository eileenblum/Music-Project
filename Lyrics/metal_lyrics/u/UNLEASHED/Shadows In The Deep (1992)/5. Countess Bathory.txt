[Lant / Dunn / Bray]
[These words taken from Venom's original version]

Wellcoming the virgin's fair,
to live a noble life
In the castle known to all
The Count's infernal wife

She invites the peasants
with endless lavish foods
But, when evening spreads its wings
She rapes them of their blood

Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory

All day long the virgins sit
Feast on endless meals
The Countess laughs and sips her wine
Her skin both crack and peel

But when nighttime fills the air
One must pay the price
The Countess takes her midnight bath
with blood that once gave life

Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory

(Countess)

Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory

Living in her self-styled hell
the Countess dressed in black
Life so distant, death so near
no blood to turn time back

The castle walls are closing in
She's crippled now with age
Welcomes death with open arms
The Reaper turns the page

Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory
