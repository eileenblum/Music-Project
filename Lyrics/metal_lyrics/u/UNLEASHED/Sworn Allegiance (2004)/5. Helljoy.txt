There is no holy land
No better place to dwell
Here is our day of joy
Here and now is our hell
I am my own god
I am my own slave
There is no redeemer
To see me through the day
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
There is no glorious heaven
But the one you create
Live your life in sin
Live before it's too late
You must take control
Pleasure of the flesh
Cut the moral leash
Indulgence 'til death
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
