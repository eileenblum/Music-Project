Forest silent waiting
Frozen winter breeze
Snowfall ever lasting
Covers mountains and fields
Ice... cold... winterland
Ice... cold... winterland
The mighty Thor has spoken
Autumns final breath
The dying of all living
The triumph of nature &amp; death
Ice... cold... winterland
Ice... cold... winterland
Ice... cold... winterland
Ice... cold... winterland
