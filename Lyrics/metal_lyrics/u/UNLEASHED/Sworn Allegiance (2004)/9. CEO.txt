Rich parents and poor hygiene
Born in the 40's to a life of luxury
You sucked all the right cocks well
To get a really nice job your dad can tell
You call home and say you're working late
But there's another thing now that just can't wait...
What a leader the CEO!
His big secret just doesn't show
He pays a girl to get him through
Puts on his diaper and feed him gruel
A big house, the suburban dream you have
A boring ass wife and a daughter crack queen
You drink drive the brand new car
Na djust bribe another cop when you get caught
You whine out loud 'bout the income tax
Because the monthly 5000 Euros never last
What a leader the CEO!
His big secret just doesn't show
He pays a girl to get him through
Puts on his diaper and feed him gruel
