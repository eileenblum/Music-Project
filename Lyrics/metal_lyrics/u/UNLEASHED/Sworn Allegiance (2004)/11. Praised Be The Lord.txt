Need a better life?
Come to paradise
Live in happiness
Long for Jesus Christ
He can save your soul
Heal your flesh and bone
Any one disease
Welcome to the show!
Praised to be lord
Give us all you can afford
Praised to be lord
Give us all you can afford
Give a contribution
And behold the light
For the second coming
Of holy Jesus Christ
Listen to the preacher
On your knees and pray
Mercy and forgiveness
If you do obey
Praised to be lord
Give us all you can afford
Praised to be lord
Give us all you can afford
