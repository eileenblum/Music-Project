Once a friend
With open arms
A moment black
Now dagger sharp sits in my back
Felt the pain
Seeing red
It's all too late
Before my eyes the veil of hate
You took my soul, I'll take your flesh
So filled with rage I bring you death
I bring you death
I bring you death
On you knees
Before me bleed
How's it feel?
To be the one to be deceived
See the life
Now drain away
As you die
Your filthy pleas jusr pass me by
You took my soul, I'll take your flesh
So filled with rage I bring you death
I bring you death
I bring you death
