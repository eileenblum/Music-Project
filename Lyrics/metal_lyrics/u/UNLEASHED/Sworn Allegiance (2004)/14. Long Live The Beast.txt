Nothing's left from the final war
Feeble race exists no more
Time is up for the rule of man
It's an age swallowed by the sand
Long live the beast
In this final curtain call
Long live the beast
That will outlive us all
Long live the beast
In this final curtain call
Long live the beast
That will outlive us all
All is dead, silence in the air
Smell of death is everywhere
In a lair from ages past
Something's born in this aftermath
Long live the beast
In this final curtain call
Long live the beast
That will outlive us all
Long live the beast
In this final curtain call
Long live the beast
That will outlive us all
