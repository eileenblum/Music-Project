Saruman commands his army
An army of 10000 strong
To march upon the land of Rohan
A war on man that must be won
From Isengard the Uruk-Hai march off to war
For destruction, destruction
For destruction of the race of men
Isengard has been unleashed
The Uruk-Hai march to war
They will leave no one alive
Helm's deep is soon to fall
From Isengard the Uruk-Hai march off to war
For destruction, destruction
For destruction of the race of men
Destruction, for destruction
For destruction of the race of men
"A new power is rising
It's victory is at hand"
"There will be no dawn of men"
Destruction, for destruction
Of the race of men
Destruction, for destruction
Of the race of men
