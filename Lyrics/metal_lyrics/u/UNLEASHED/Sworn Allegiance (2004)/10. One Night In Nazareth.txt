Oh, Virgin Mary, maiden of the lord
You are the chosen one, one lucky whore
Don't be afraid now, you've got grace with me
I'll come upon you yeah in just a little less harmony
I'll be your incubus
The angel you can trust
I don't need you to breed
Just swallow all my seed
One night in Nazareth, with the chosen one
So let it be written, so let it be done
I'll be your incubus
The angel you can trust
I don't need you to breed
Just swallow all my seed
