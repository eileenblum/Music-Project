Insane hunger, cold heart beating
Intense bloodlust, pressure increasing
All excited at every reek of death
Stop at nothing, must feed from human flesh
Insane for blood
Insane for blood
The frustration keeps on peaking
Internal torment pain comes creeping
The night's falling must seek another prey
A new source of blood to live another day
Insane for blood
Insane for blood
