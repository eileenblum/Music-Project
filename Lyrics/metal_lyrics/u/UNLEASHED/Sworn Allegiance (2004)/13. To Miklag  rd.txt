From Birka the norsemen set sail
Across the wide open Baltic sea
At Lagoda and Novgorod they settled
Slaves and fur they would trade for silver and silk
Forward to MiklagÃ¥rd
Forward to MiklagÃ¥rd
On the Dnjepr, they struggled to pass Aifur
Around Kiev, tribes and folk were gathered
And the new master's name was the infamous Rus!
Two thousand ships that sailed the Black sea...
Forward to MiklagÃ¥rd
Forward to MiklagÃ¥rd
