Lindisfarne, holy land
Of pilgrimage for the christian man
Church of god, and monastery
8th of June, in the year of 793
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
Oh lord, hear us pray
Save us from the norsemen's rage
In despair, final grasp
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
