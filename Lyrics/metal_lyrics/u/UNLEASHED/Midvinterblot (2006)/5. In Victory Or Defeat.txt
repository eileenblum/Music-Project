On the endless path of war
We may be torn and beat
But we have sworn to stand as one
In victory or defeat

We are the immortals
From Hell we rise
We are the immortals
Death Metal - No compromise!

Others follow the winds of change
You came to swear allegiance
No conformity at all
We didn't come to reason

We are the immortals
From Hell we rise
We are the immortals
Death Metal - No compromise!
We are the immortals
From Hell we rise
We are the immortals
Death Metal - No compromise!
