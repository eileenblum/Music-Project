Dressed in black, a flame from Hell
You feel her presence all too well
She'll take you for a magic ride
To Hell and back with legs astride
She'll take all that she needs
Leave your mind and soul to bleed

Dressed in black, a flame from Hell
The witch has casted her spell

Domination, lust will reign
Her lions are aflame
The nectar mixed with sweat
Dripping from her eager cleft
Shall act as pollen rain
To your slumbering brain

Dressed in black, a flame from Hell
The witch has casted her spell
