Upon this land his forefathers walked
The call from the past
That warms his heart
Decades pass by, the changing of time
Still there's a fire that burns inside

Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!

The struggle to survive
The seeds he has sown
All he has built can soon be gone
The deeds of white Christ
Which must be avenged
He summons the Gods,
for courage and strength

Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!

The cold wind blows
And the hour draws near
He must stand his ground
With shield and spear
Its time for the warrior
To defend his kin
For a new dawn to rise
Its a battle he must win

Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
