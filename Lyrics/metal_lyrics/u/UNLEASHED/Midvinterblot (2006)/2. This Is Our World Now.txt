Too long you've slandered our name
And dragged us all in the dust
Arguments of incompetence
Are easily returned and crushed

We will hunt you down
This is our world now!
We will hunt you down
This is our world now!

Hunt, hunt, the battle rages
The legions of Hell are here
You can run but you can't hide
There's not even time for fear

We will hunt you down
This is our world now!
We will hunt you down
This is our world now!

The time of the common man is over
The age of the warrior has come!
