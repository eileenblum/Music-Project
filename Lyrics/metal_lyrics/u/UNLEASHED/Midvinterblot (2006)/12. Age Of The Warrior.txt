Decades of despair, Christian decadence
And human defeat
Where no life dwells a new power grew
Like shadows in the deep
Immortal spirits bred in Hell
In time, all will see

It's the age of the warrior
The age of the warrior
The age of the warrior

Across the open sea, from land to land
It was time for victory
They fight so proud, with a warrior spirit
As Hell's unleashed
The have sworn allegiance,
With loyalty and pride
In time, all will see

It's the age of the warrior
The age of the warrior
The age of the warrior
