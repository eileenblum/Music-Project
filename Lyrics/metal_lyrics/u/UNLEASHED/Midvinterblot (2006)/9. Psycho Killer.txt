I'm all that you want me to be
Yeah, read about me soon
I drink the blood of babies fresh
I am impending doom
I kill for pleasure yes I do
Or is it out of greed?
Another day, another death
I'm what the public needs

I am a psycho killer
I am a psycho killer

The politicians love me too
I am a human shame
For unemployment and inflation
I am the one to blame
I'm a star in the evening news
A lamb left to die
Another story covered up
Some other fucking lie

I am a psycho killer
I am a psycho killer

I drink the blood of a newborn child
I'm all about death
I kill for pleasure yes I do
I confess

I am a psycho killer
I am a psycho killer
