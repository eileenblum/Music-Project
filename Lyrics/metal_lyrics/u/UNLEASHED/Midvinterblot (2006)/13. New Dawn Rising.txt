Join us in this great adventure
Our common time on earth
To make the best of what you've got
For better or for worse
Tomorrow shall belong to you
Stand up and face the world

New dawn rising
New dawn rising

We are the ones to write the pages
Of coming history
Deadly metal onward pounding
Innovative and free
So behold the new dawn rising
A new creation is unleashed

New dawn rising
New dawn rising
