Civilian killing squads
With clubs and machetes
So the killing starts
There is no escape
From the interahamwe
Clubbed, burned and raped

The triumph of genocide
The United Nations stood aside
And watched the triumph of genocide

Bodies floating down
The Kigara river
Tied, hacked and drowned
Average killing rate
Thousands by the day
The UN evacuates

The triumph of genocide
The United Nations stood aside
And watched the triumph of genocide
