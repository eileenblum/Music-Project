Stolen from a Roman cave
By a follower in need
Of a selfish holy tale
To plant the Christian seed
Took the bones and ran away
Resurrection is the sign
Soon he'll come to us again
It's salvation for mankind

Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ
Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ

Don't you see the holy sign?
Its an act of God you've seen
Here's the proof, an empty tomb
Not a thing to be revealed!
Millions praying all in vain
For the secret to unwind
Waiting for the second coming
It's salvation for mankind

Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ
Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ
