A man of the ancient way
From a barren land he came
With a spirit forged of steel
To become a man that never kneels
To anyone or anything
His strength lies deep within

The mark of faith
He wears with pride
The Hammer is his sign
The mark of faith
He wears with pride
The Hammer is his sign

The Hammer is his sign
Of loyalty and pride
A Viking warrior of today
From any land from any place
Holding his head up high
Through war and troubled times

The mark of faith
He wears with pride
The Hammer is his sign
The mark of faith
He wears with pride
The Hammer is his sign

With a mind of honest deeds
And a spirit that is free
He'll fight for kin and tribe
With them he'll live and die
