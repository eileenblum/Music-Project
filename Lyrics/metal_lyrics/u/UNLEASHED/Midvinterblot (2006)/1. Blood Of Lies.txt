A life in denial
Mindless and bleak
Herded as cattle
A sign of the weak

Heavens Sons
Now you bow
For the ones
To rule you now
Blood of lies
Spilling Forth
Feeble Flies
Say goodbye

Blood of lies
Blood of lies

Impotent, holy
All but a wraith
Cursing your idols
I spit on your faith
Ravage your angels
Crushing your gods
Gutting your prophets
I'll tear down you all

Heavens Sons
Now you bow
For the ones
To rule you now
Blood of lies
Spilling Forth
Feeble Flies
Say goodbye

Blood of lies
Blood of lies
