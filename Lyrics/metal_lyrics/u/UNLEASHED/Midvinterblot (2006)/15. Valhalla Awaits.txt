The battle is over
Blood covers the plain
Courage is proven
Brave men died this day

Oh the Valkyries fly
To choose from those who died
Oh the Valkyries fly

Valhalla awaits

Choosers of the slain
Honor the brave men's call
Soon the Einheriar
Rise again in Odin's hall

Oh the Valkyries fly
To choose from those who died
Oh the Valkyries fly

Valhalla awaits
