Oh, come light again
And break the spell of winter

Lets drink to Thor
The return of the Sun
And to our dead
Yes raise your horns
Hail Thor! Drink to remember our dead!
Hail Thor! Drink to remember our dead!

Oh, come victory
Bring prosperity in the coming year

Midvinterblot

Lets drink to Frey
The good of our folk
And the coming year
Yes raise your horns
Hail Frey! Drink to prosperity!
Hail Frey! Drink to prosperity!

Hail Odin! Drink to victory!
Hail Odin! Drink to victory!
