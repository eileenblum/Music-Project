Welcome warriors of Unleashed
Tonight is our time to feast
You know its always worth the wait
Lets drink to Thor and celebrate

I have sworn allegiance
I have sworn allegiance
I have sworn allegiance

We've traveled far to prove our faith
No sacrifice can be too great
Our home is this Viking hall
United we shall stand or fall

I have sworn allegiance
I have sworn allegiance
I have sworn allegiance

Odin bade me his welcome
Into his hall of the slain
To reserve a place for the faithful ones
The immortals - The warriors of Unleashed
Who all swore to stand as one... forever
To you I have sworn, to you I have sworn
I have sworn allegiance eternally
