Smoke is rising from the mountain
The mountain of doom
A great eye, lidless, wrapped in flame
On the tower of Barad-DÃ»r
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
Or we have chosen death

We must join with him
We must join with Sauron

His gaze goes through
Cloud and shadow
Earth and through flesh
The lord of Mordor sees it all
Gathering all evil without rest
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
Or we have chosen death

We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron

We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
Or we have chosen death
