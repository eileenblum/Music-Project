The battle is over and we march again
Across the northern lands so grand
We take back all that once was given to us
Village by village, land by land
The cross of terror shall be set on fire
And burn like so many times before
Where churches once burned by our fathers' Vengeance
Again, behold the rule of Thor!
...behold the rule of Thor

Where churches once burned
Now behold the rule of Thor!

Ans so we're chasing White Christ off our lands
And burn their churches to the ground
We take back all that once was given to us
And reinstate the Hammer Now!
...reinstate the Hammer now

Where churches once burned
Now behold the rule of Thor!
Where churches once burned
Now behold the rule of Thor!

[Chorus]
