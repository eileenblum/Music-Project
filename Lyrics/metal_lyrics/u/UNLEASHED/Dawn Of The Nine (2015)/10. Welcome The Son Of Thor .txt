Our ships return to the shores of our Folklands
The sky is blue, a northern wind, it's a day so grand

He has returned!
He has returned!

Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born

Warriors standing proud, with raised fists, yelling hails
This is your day of truth, reckoning and prevail
Freedom from fascist Christ, his holiness is forever banned
Hope has now finally come to these forsaken lands

He has returned!
He has returned!

Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born

Our time has come
A new day has risen
Our time is now

Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
