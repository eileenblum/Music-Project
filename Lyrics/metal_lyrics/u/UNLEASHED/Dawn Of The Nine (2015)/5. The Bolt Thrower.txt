He was born of the northern wind
With a spirit of steel, destined to win
A master of war
A master of war that feels no pain
That feels no pain

Forged in the fires of Muspelheim
His will stood the test of time
A master of war that feels no pain
His loyals calling out his name...

The Bolt Thrower
The Bolt Thrower

A master of war
A master of war that feels no pain
That feels no pain

Long was our wait this night
As he called out White Christ to flight
Their time is up, no more hiding in shame
His loyals calling out his name...

The Bolt Thrower
The Bolt Thrower

He was born of the northern wind
With a spirit of steel, destined to win
A master of war that feels no pain
His loyals calling out his name...

The Bolt Thrower
