Through the dark, dark caves
That was once built
By our fathers determination
Strength and will

But we will rise again
And fight, fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end

A time to heal and prepare
For tomorrow
As we march with our minds
Black with sorrow

But we will rise again
And fight, fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end

Through the dark, dark caves
That was once built
By our fathers determination
Strength and will

But we will rise again
And fight, fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end

Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
