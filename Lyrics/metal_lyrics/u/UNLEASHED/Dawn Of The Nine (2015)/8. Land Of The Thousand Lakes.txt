Behind us churches burn to ashes
The quest continues across the Baltic sea
(The Gulf of Bothnia)
To the land of the thousand lakes
Where the forest gives us time to rest and breathe

In a warrior's mind
His father's words from another time

Ride out my son
Ride forth tonight
Warriors so proud
Will fight by your side

We reached the clan of the wilderness
Our forces join in a blot for the dead
Together in the endless war
We speak of the past and what lies ahead

In a warrior's mind
His father's words from another time
Ride out my son
Ride forth tonight
Warriors so proud
Will fight by your side

And defend the helpless ones
So hold your head up high
Stand strong for your kin
And face the world with the nine...

In a warrior's mind
His father's words from another time

Ride out my son
Ride forth tonight
Warriors so proud
Will fight by your side
