In the far distance
Under an unknown flag
A vast army appears
Will the great war end at last?
Overwhelming power
Hammer battalions on retreat
Overwhelming power
White Christ now flee

Our time will come
A new day will rise

Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise

Thousands of soldiers
Lying dead in the fields
Fires across the plains
Again the Folklands bleed
We await the return
Of the avanger of Odalheim
Our time will come
A new day will rise

Our time will come
A new day will rise

Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
So stand proud...
A new day will rise

(Have faith my warriors
And stand strong, for a new day will rise)

Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
So stand proud...
A new day will rise
