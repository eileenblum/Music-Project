Onward into battle now
Fearless rage, gun them down
Some will fight, some will flee
Shoot them dead, watch them bleed

Thor rides his chariot
Rides across the sky
Let the Hammer fly

Kill them all
Leave none alive
Kill them all
Let the Hammer fly

Headless bodies on their knees
Upright as their torsos freeze
Falling down onto the snow
By the firing squads' massive blow
Vengeance now taken for their deeds
In the battle at Uppsala fields
God is still nowhere to be found
Did he flee to higher ground?

Thor rides his chariot
Rides across the sky
Let the Hammer fly

Kill them all
Leave none alive
Kill them all
Let the Hammer fly

Let the Hammer fly, let... the Hammer... fly

(Tyr draws his sword
The Spear of Odin is thrown
Thor rides his chariot
Hel will take her share)

Let the Hammer fly
Kill them all
Leave none alive
Kill them all
Let the Hammer fly
