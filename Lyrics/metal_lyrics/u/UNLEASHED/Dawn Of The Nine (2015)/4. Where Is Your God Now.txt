Here we are alive again
In a battle without end
So we rise from the caves
And march until sol descends

Here we are. Who could tell?
We will all be unleashed from Hel
We will have our revenge
On the soil where our fathers fell

Where is your god now? [4x]

Here we are, but he is gone
The search is on for the sacred one
Hiding out, a cowards game
White Christ in on the run

Here we are. Come out and play
Take his place, die in vain
Or send him out and he shall meet
The bolt thrower on the open plain

Where is your god now? [4x]

Behold the crucifix.
What does it symbolize?
Pallid incompetence
Hanging on a tree

Here we are alive again
In a battle without end
So we rise from the caves
And march until sol descends

Here we are. Who could tell?
We will all be unleashed from Hel
We will have our revenge
On the soil where our fathers fell

Where is your god now? [4x]
