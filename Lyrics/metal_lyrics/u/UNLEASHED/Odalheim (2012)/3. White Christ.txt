Rape, pillage, burn
As White Christ returns
Women scream in pain
Gutting children is a game

I have seen it before

I see the death
All that is left
Is their blood of lies
And the terror of White Christ

Death is slow
Burned eye sockets glow
With the light of Christ
Shining, oh so bright
Sawed-off limbs fouund
Scattered on the ground
Bodies without heads
Cut off as they fled

I have seen it before

I see the death
All that is left
Is their blood of lies
And the terror of White Christ
The blood of lies
The terror of White Christ

Rulers of the earth
Their message will be heard
Kneel to the cross
All will be lost
Rape, pillage, burn
As White Christ returns
Women scream in pain
Gutting children is a game

I see the death
All that is left
Is their blood of lies
And the terror of White Christ
