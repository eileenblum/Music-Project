Healing the wounds
From the attack
Rest assured they'll be back
Time to prepare
And bury the sorrow
Our retaliation must follow

The hour to defeat, the hour to defeat
Blasting, bursting, will this be our time to retreat?
Blastint, bursting, the hour to defeat

Arming the forces
Now ready to fight
Odin, guide us tonight!
Grand is the view
Of our ships of war
Closing in at enemy shores
Sounding the charge
Fire at will!
The enemy standing still...

All against the odds
Their guns are too great
Outnumbered it is all to late

The hour to defeat, the hour to defeat
Blasting, bursting, the time has come for retreat
Blasting, bursting, the hour to defeat

[Repeat chorus]
