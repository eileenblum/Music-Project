From the ashes of the old world
A new one begin to take form
At the end of the great winter
The new age was born

Black is the dawn
As the new world appears
The air is all silent
We are still here

Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim

The winds of the aftermath
Sweeping the shores
Of our ancestor's land
Where we shall build once more

Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim

We are the warriors of Midgard
A kindred of mental bloodline
Hammer Battalions of the world
Stand up! This is our time!

Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim

Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim

We are the warriors of Midgard
A kindred of mental bloodline
Hammer Battalions of the world
Stand up! This is our time!

Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim

As the new dawn is rising
The age of the warrior is here
Raise your hammers high
For Odalheim everywhere
