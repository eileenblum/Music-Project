In a time not far from ours
The lasting cold will prevail
The utter darkness will cover all
Nothing will ever be the same
The great ice will lose its grip
Its water will flood the earth
Like an ever flowing stream
Death and rebirth

The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
Come RagnarÃ¶k...

Continent by continent
The black storms invade
And destroy everything
That comes in its way

Mother Nature takes back
What's rightfully hers
RagnarÃ¶k the liberator
Death and rebirth

The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
Come RagnarÃ¶k...

Three years of lasting cold
Three years of darkness

[Repeat chorus]
