Our journey has come to an end
The svithiod we have returned 
As Sol descends
On the winter solstice night
Our forces now prepare
For the final fight
A blot to Thor and Odin
As the morning breaks
The battle begins
The battailons of the world
At Uppsala fields
Their call is heard...

This is our world now!!!

The great battle of Odalheim
The great battle of Odalheim

The armies of White Christ
Now fire upon us all
Blitzkrieg light the sky
Warheads that explode

Shreds that burn their way
Into flesh and bone
Men cut in half
Blood rains from the sky
Breaking through enemy lines
Now close to victory
In the great war of our time

The great battle of Odalheim
The great battle of Odalheim

The armies of White Christ
No mercy behind enemy lines 
So close to victory
In the great war of our time

The great battle of Odalheim
The great battle of Odalheim

In the far distance 
Under an unkown flag
A vast army appears...
