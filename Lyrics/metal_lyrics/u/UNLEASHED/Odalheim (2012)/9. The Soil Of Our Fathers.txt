Onward through the land of Gaul
Over the Pyrenees
Warriors are joining our quest
From the desolate cities

We shall struggle and toil
We shall fight again on our father's soil

March my warriors, march!
To reclaim our land
Fight proud my armies, fight!
On our way to the final stand

Gather with the Iberian battailons
Crossing the Ebro river again
Each day our numbers grow
Odin guide us to the very end
Marching to the Roman kingdom
Where the thirteenth legion rule supreme
Our forces now band together
And march against the tyranny

We shall struggle and toil
We shall fight again on our father's soil

March my warriors, march!
To reclaim our land
Fight proud my armies, fight!
On our way to the final stand

[Repeat chorus]

...the final stand
