We shall fight on the seas
We shall fight on the beaches
Disembark and make them flee
We shall never surrender

Rule battailons, battailons rule the waves
Midgard Warriors never will be slaves

We shall fight in the fields
We shall fight in the jills
Marching fast in firm belief
We shall take back what's ours
We shall fight to the last man
We shall fight in the streets
Hunting White Christ off our land
We shall never surrender

Rule battailons, battailons rule the waves
Midgard Warriors never will be slaves

Hammers of Thor held high
We stand victorious, watching our enemies die

[Repeat chorus 2x]
