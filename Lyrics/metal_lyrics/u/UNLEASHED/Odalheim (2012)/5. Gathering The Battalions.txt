Fled the guns blasting death
Through forest, field and sea
Decimated to extinction
The last of our kin yet free

Through a darkened land, once so proud and grand
Gathering the battailons, gathering the battailons

Terror now rule the lands
Where free men one walked
The ALthing council now decides to gather
The battailons of the world to a final war
On the ancient rrails of Norrland
We start journey to be free
Struggling through the Norwegian forest
Raching the coast finally

Through a darkened land, once so proud and grand
Gathering the battailons, gathering the battailons

[Repeat chorus]
