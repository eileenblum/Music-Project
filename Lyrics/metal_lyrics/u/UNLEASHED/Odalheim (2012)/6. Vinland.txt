Left the coast of Norway behind
With the vengeance burning in our minds
All determined to return one day
As Soll will shine

Across the open sea, to Vinland and test our steel
Longships towards a black horizon
Like our fathers in the past
We shall have our victory at last

Rubble, chaos, death and decay
Through dead cities on our way
From the east coast to the west
Our forces grow by the day

Across the open sea, to Vinland and test our steel
Longships towards a black horizon
Like our fathers in the past
We shall have our victory at last

[Repeat verse 1 and chorus]

Fearless with swords drawn into battle
Like our fathers in the past
We shall have our victory at last
