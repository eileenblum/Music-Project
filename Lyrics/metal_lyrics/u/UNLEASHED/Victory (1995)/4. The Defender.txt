Down he rode from the hills where he was born
With sword and shield and baatle axe in hand
Young and strong he was the chosen one
To lead the armies and to defend his land
The day had come to kill the intruders
By the shore, the enemies now stand
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
AND I'LL SLAY THE ENEMY
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
TO ETERNAL VICTORY
Strenghtened by the words of his own father:
Son, you must be merciless and brave!
Never let them take an inch of land,
No, he'd never let his family be raped
Never let them march upon his fields,
No, he's never let his people be enslaved
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
AND I'LL SLAY THE ENEMY
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
TO ETERNAL VICTORY
Thor of might now throws his hammer in wrath
Thunder roar the lightning strikes the sky
Now the battle rages into chaos
Blood is running strong and the valkyries fly
Finally the defender stands victorious
And Vlahalla awaits for the brave who died
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
AND I'LL SLAY THE ENEMY
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
TO ETERNAL VICTORY
VICTORY
