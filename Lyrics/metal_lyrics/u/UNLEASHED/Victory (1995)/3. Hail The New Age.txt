Hail the new age
Where we fight proud
And we take back
All that was ours
Hail the new world
Honest not fake
And we praise nature
Ever so great
HONOUR AND FAITH, HAIL THE NEW AGE
Hail to our fathers'
Wisdom of the past
And the inheritance
Forever will last
Hail to the land
Where I was born
Honour and faith
To the flag sworn
HONOUR AND FAITH, HAIL THE NEW AGE
