Be hailed oh precious land
That in greatness and glory stands
Here where ancestors walked
Forever be my heart
PRECIOUS LAND
HAIL
PRECIOUS LAND
Oh, as the inter fades
Behold, the nature awakes
Oh, feel the wind caress
Here where my soul can rest
PRECIOUS LAND
HAIL
PRECIOUS LAND
Sun, come cast your spell
And bring forth life
Where spirits dwell
Forever
Come morning, day and light
Embrace the silence at night
Come lust and beauty great
Oh, precious land ba hailed
PRECIOUS LAND
HAIL
PRECIOUS LAND
