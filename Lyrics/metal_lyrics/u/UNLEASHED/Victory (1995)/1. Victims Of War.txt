VICTIMS OF WAR
VICTIMS OF WAR
The sound of enormous bombs
Tearing apart the ground
Bursting, crashing, slashing
Black clouds fill the once blue sky
Everything set ablaze
Bursting, crashing, slashing
VICTIMS OF WAR
WAR
VICTIMS OF WAR
Bodies burned and ripped apart
Ashes and blood remains
Screaming, crying, dying
Agonizing repulsive screams
From all life that is left
Screaming, crying, dying
CHAOS
The infernal heat
Eating through the skin
Of all the innocent
That areleftto die
In this meaningless war
There's nothing more
Than those who pay
Welcome to doomsday!
