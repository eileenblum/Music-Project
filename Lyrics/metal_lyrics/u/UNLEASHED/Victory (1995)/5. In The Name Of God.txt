In the name of God
A preacher rapes a child
He puts his hand
On top of his little head
He says: My son
You mustn't be afraid
I am your friend
In the name of God
He now takes off his clothes
Caresses his legs
So gently with his hands
He says: My son
You mustn't be afraid
I am your friend
(You have to trust me)
He says yeah
SUCK ON THIS OR ROT IN HELL
In the name of God
He now pools out his tool
And smiles, it hurts,
He enters from behind
He says: My son
You mustn't be afraid
I am your friend
In the name of God
When the blood is flowing free
And on the floor
The helpless body lies
He says: My son
There is the will of God
(You must have a faith)
HE SAYS YEAH
SUCK ON THIS OR ROT IN HELL
Religious harmony fills the air
Where the helpless bodylies
The erected member now was satisfied
God's messiah have had this way
