One thousand years ago
In this land of ice and snow
Man lived with hatred just like me
The wrath lives on eternally
BERSERK
Feel no pain, there's only hate
No regret, it's all too late
I see your face, it's all I need
To grind you down and watch you bleed
BERSERK
My mind is blank, I am insane
You cry for mercy, cry in vain
I leave you trashed, for all to see
Berserk in me, eternally
BERSERK
