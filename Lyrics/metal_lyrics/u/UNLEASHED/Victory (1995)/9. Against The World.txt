AGAINST THE WORLD
He was alone against the world
An outcast ever since birth
On and on night and day
They told him to behave
You must fit into society
Oh, how he tried but could not agree
Be like us and follow trends
No, he'd rather fight 'till the end
AGAINST THE WORLD
AGAINST THE WORLD
He was alone against the world
Every day a slave at work
Be a man don't make a sound!
Oh, he tried to tear him down
So he was one of a kind
But theycould not control his mind
And he knew the day will come
To take revenge on every one
AGAINST THE WORLD
