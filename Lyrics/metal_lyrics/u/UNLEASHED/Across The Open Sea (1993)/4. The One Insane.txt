I am the psychopath
I live in my own world
I'll be the one you fear
...the one insane

People say I'm mad
And the one insane
I mustn't speak my word
And never to complain
They say I have the change
Cannot be this way
Must stay out of range
Now what can I say?

I am the psychopath
I live in my own world
I'll be the one you fear
...the one insane

So a doktor said
It was the best for me
To give me coloured pills
and neurosurgery
So I hit him with a hetchet
And ran from my cell
Need no special cure
To try keep my well

I am the psychopath
I live in my own world
I'll be the one you fear
...the one insane

Yes I migth be mad
And I am insane
But I'll speak my word
And I'll never change
I don't need to hear
All the things they say
Now what do I care
I'd never walk their ways

I am the psychopath
I live in my own world
I'll be the one you fear
...the one insane
