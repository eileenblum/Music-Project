I am Jesus Christ
Hear my holy lies
I fool the poor &amp; weak
To the light they seek
I sell the blessings for
50 dollars more

I am god
I kill people just for pleasure

I love to see them cry
And watch them slowly die
I lead every war
Trust in me for a better score
I don't care at all
If they stand or fall

I am God
I kill people just for pleasure

I plot a way for the destruction
Of the earth
To plague, starvation and diseases
I gave birth
I let them all die, cause my will
Is the law
The bullets of war are all mine
Yeah, I am God

I am Jesus Christ
Can't tou see the light?
I preach the holy way
Join or be my prey

I am god
I kill people just for pleasure
