Memories of a troubled past
Appears before my eyes
It seems to be the very last
I see before I fly
High above the earth and soon
To reach another day
The good old 1995
Is now just a memory

...goodbye

Flying high above the sky
As the planet burns
A journey to another world
There is no return
Visions are dancing in my mind
Of pictures never seen
Where the day and night are one
And life just cannot be

...goodbye

From the end of the universe
I scream in endless vain
I've realized I never will
See the sun again
I wonder as the hours pass
If someone will ever find
This message from another time
2045...

...forever... goodbye
