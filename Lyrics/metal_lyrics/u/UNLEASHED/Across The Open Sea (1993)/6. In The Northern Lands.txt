Gods on high, behold...!
To thee I reach for might

Long ago in the northern lands
They sacrificed for might
Brothers Three who killed to give
Mortals land and sea
Midgaards rose from giant's flesh
Slaughtered to give life
Hail to the allseeing,
He who for wisdom gave his eye

Gods on high, behold...!
To thee I reach for might

The ravens flay across the plains
TO tell their master's tales
Tales beyond narrow minds
Weak lambs led astray
Our gift of blood &amp; life to thee
O ancient heathen gods
Therefore now to thee we give
This human sacrifice

Gods on high, behold...!
To thee I reach for might

Long ago in the northern lands
They sacrificed for might
Brothers Three who killed to give
Mortals land and sea
Midgaards rose from giant's flesh
Slaughtered to give life
Hail to the allseeing,
He who for wisdom gave his eye
