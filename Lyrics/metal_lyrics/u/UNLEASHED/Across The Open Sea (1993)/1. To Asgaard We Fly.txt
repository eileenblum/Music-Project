Guided by my father's call
End of search, I hear them all
Now my quest is to live your dream
Land of the free passed on to me

I hail to thee on precious land
Brave &amp; grand so strong she stands
Reaching from the mountains high
Down to the woods where the ravens fly

To asgaard we fly
The spirit will never die

I gaze across the open sea
Ships return but soon to leave
For all the men in battle slain
Let their spirits guide the way

Warrior of faith and pride
A spirit that can never die
With sword &amp; shield I stand on guard
I'll fight til'death, we'll never part

To asgaard we fly
The spirit will never die

Guided by my father's call
End of search, I hear them all
Now my quest is to live your dream
Land of the free passed on to me

I hail to thee on fatherland
Brave &amp; grand so strong she stands
Reaching from the mountains high
Down to the woods where the ravens fly

To asgaard we fly
The spirit will never die
