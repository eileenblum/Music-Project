Up he rose &amp; forth they went
Into the battleground, fortress, tent
Mountains, wilderness, fielsd &amp; farm
The soldier &amp; the general arm in arm

Off they ride
Side by side

"Through the travail of ages
Midst the pomp &amp; toils of war
Have I fought, strove and perished
Countless times under the stars
As it through a glass and darkly
The ageal stripe I see
I fought in many guises, many names
But it was always me..."

Off they ride
Side by side

I was there in...
Lived &amp; died...

So up he rose &amp; forth they went
Into the battleground, fortress, tent
Mountains, wilderness, fielsd &amp; farm
The soldier &amp; the general arm in arm

Off they ride
Side by side
