[Feb '90]

I - am my own god and master
No one - will take my soul away
I - will rise in stern invasion
Die - the enemy I slay
Choose side, follow mine - take his fuckin' life
I - will enter no path of decay
Stabbing the dagger in their eye
I - will tear 'em down, for all to see
My revenge of all the false in mind
Choose side, follow mine - take his fuckin' life
I will set it free
Violent ecstasy
I will set it free
Violent ecstasy
I - am my own god and master
No one - will take my soul away
I - will rise in stern invasion
Die - the enemy I slay
Choose side, follow mine - take his fuckin' life
