[July '90]

God of lies,
Slaughter and sacrifice
We spit in his face
And laugh as we die
...Where life ends
Mother Christ -
Your son we crucified
On a path to hell -
We choose to live our lives
...Where life ends
Where is the gate
To heaven of glory bright?
Vanished in the dark,
Where is the promised light?
