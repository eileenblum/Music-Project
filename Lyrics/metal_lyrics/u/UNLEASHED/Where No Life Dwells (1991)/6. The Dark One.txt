[Dec '89]

Stalking through the utter dark
Evil eyes glow in the distance
Prepared for a battle in rage
The end for the cruel adventurer
Blow to side - strike through eye
A battle-axe wields to charge
And separates head from body
Darkest blood flowing free
My eyes are filled with pleasure
Blow to side - strike through eye
A hunt for an ancient treasure
No herbs to restore his life
To die by an orchish arrow
Victorious the olog-hai
Slow you'll die - the dark one smiles
