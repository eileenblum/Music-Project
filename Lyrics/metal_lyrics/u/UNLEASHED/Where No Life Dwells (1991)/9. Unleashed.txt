[Music April '90, lyrics Nov '90]

When they bring us holy water
We'll tear 'em down to the core
The cross of weakness burns to ashes
And Jesus Christ is no more
This is the way - we're unleashed
So they named us evil men
Evil minded yes we are
Living proud by the law of nature
By the hammer into war
This is the way - we're unleashed
...Join our side and we'll crush the enemy
When they bring us holy water
We'll tear 'em down to the core
The cross of weakness burns to ashes
And Jesus Christ is no more
Tsirhcitna - he's unleashed
...Beware...
