[Oct '90]

Once upon
An evil time
Up in the north
Mighty men
Fought and died
By the sword
...Onward into glory ride
Into battle
Sign of the hammer
Be my guide
Standing proud
In victory
Into glory ride
...Onward into glory ride
To Birka we sail
(Birch Island)
And celebrate
Hail Thor
And the fallen
Join with Odin
At slain hall
(Valhalla)
...Onward into glory ride
