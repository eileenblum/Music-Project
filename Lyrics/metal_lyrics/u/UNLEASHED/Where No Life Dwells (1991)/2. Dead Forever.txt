[Sep '90]

I detest your sanity
You're blinded by the light
Empty eyes of suffering
Get out of my life ...life
Take my hand and ride with me
Into the dark
I am the asexual
Tear out your heart ...heart
...Slow
Frightened by shadows
...You hide away
So weak in mind
...You fade away
Now your mind is dead forever
All left behind
Came to shake my hand again
Bow down and die!
Born to walk alone forever
I shall remain
Suffer now my child and see
I am insane! ...Insane
