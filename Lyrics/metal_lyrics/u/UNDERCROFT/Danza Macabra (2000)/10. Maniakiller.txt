Flowing slowly like acid
Decaying by pieces all moral
Have no escape from insanity
Flowing slowly - pumping blood to the head !
Destroying it all
Make the time to kill
Slowly !
While the mind is black !
Face to face in front the truth
Blind the eyes and cold the neck
Have no escape from insanity
Flowing slowly - cumming on her frightened face !
Destroying it all
Make the time to kill
Slowly !
While the mind is black !
Walk on the path of transgressions
Every unrestrained killing... impulse !
Burning the skin, piercing the flesh... 'till the end
Flowing slowly - the sick art of the maniac killer !
