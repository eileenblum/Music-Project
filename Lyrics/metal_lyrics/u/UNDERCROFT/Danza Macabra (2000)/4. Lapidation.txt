The rotten thorn in your front
Is the freezing touch of fear !!!
I rise my hand
Your face is the mirror of god
I grab the stone !
Your shame and my anger embrace
Children and old bitches
Smiling and spiting your face
I guide the stone !
The weight of your sin condemn you !
Lapidation !
Please... cry in pain
I want to enjoy your death
I am the stone !
That crushes your vermin faith !
Lapidation !
