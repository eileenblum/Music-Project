Every step in the night
Black hood, evil mind
Opened gates many symbols on the ground
Circle of fire, blood is all around !
Death's smell in the air
Hanging heads on the gates
One by One rising their knifes
Shining, burning keen and proud !
Pieces of flesh... mutilated
Have no rest, have no pain
Opened gates many symbols on the ground
Merciless show... sex with corpses !
Drink the blood, eat the heart
Necromancy - unknown act
Meat of life - water of life
Valuable treasure hidden beneath !
Cut... satbbed in the holy temple !
Kink... stamp on the holy bible
Every step in the night
Black hood, evil mind
Opened gates many symbols on the ground
Circle of fire, blood is all around !
Death's smell in the air

Hanging heads on the gates
One by One rising their knifes
Shining, burning keen and proud !
