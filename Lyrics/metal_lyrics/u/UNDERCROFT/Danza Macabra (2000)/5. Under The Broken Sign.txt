One malefice... mortal trap
Melted wax... spells... one broken sign !!!
All witches run away hopeless inside
Their witchery surrenders before their eyes
Pain and sorrow on pale faces
Under the broken sign, even death dies !!!
Then from the sky will fall rain of fire
And from everywhere, whirling the winds
The face of god will never smile anymore
Under the broken sign, the serpent's complete !
Under the broken sign !
Under the broken sign - demons appear !
Under the broken sign - hope disappears !
Under the broken sign - is opened the abyss !
Under the broken sign - is boiling the water !
One malefice... mortal trap
Melted wax... spells... one broken sign !
