Through the night's veil
Exploiting my eyes
Behind the endless sky
It beholds a secret
My dream, my steps alone
Charm me in silence
Ill me with mystery
Call me from your womb
Are sweet caresses
Are smooth groans
Hidden in the shadows
Through the night's veil
Have no words on my lips
Cold and pain: no exist
Pureza maligna llega
Detras del cielo oscuro
Left... guided by fear
Oh !!! my steps !
Unknown reason
Through the night's veil
Are sweet caresses
Are smooth groans
Hidden in the shadows
Through the night's veil
