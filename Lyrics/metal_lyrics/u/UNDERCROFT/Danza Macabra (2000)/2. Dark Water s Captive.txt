Dark water's captive
Your dreams are my creed and my joy
My oldest temptation
My works, my path and my end !
Dark water's captive
I see your chains without my eyes
Your time oncoming
Drag the waters under the earth !!!
Captive in a nameless grave
King of forgotten reign
Older than the kingdom of men
Captive under the earth !
Dark water's captive
My words are your vital remains
Are the perverse power
Are the pain from your shelter of death !!!
... from the depth of the waters !
... to the height of the skies !
I am your servant forever
Offspring of ancient art
I am your evil progeny
Survivor of summer land
I am your servant forever
Offspring of ancient art
I am your evil progeny
I am forever... i am !!!
... wake up !
... from the depth of the waters !
... to the height of the skies !
Captive in a nameless grave
King of forgotten reign
Older than the kingdom of men
Captive under the earth !
Dark water's captive
Your dreams are my gift from the past
Dark watersleeper's 
Your eternal sleep i'll remember
