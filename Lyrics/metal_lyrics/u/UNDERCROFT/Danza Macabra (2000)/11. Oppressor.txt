You must suffer when you think of me
I'm the cause of eternal pain
You must suffer when you think of me
'cause i have... absolute power !
Oppressor, oppressor, oppressor
Absolute power !
Oppression, oppression
Is your resolution
You don't question my will
I'm the cause of your existence
Give it a way to the irrevocable
Or the punishment will fall on you !
Praise me and i'll bless you !
And you'll be the lamb of my flock !
Close your mind
Obey me blindly
Don't question me!
