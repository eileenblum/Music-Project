The evil particles
Of the singular night
Surround the innocent victims
Summoned to drink from the devil's chalice
Which will drive them
To their being's most inhuman condition
It's the sabbatical potion
Created by the witches for the black gathering
It's the sabbatical potion
The infernal sacrament of the beginners
The powerful spell dominates
All of the congregation
Morbidity penetrates in to the minds
Creating an endless mirage
Madness has begun
Some practice sodomy
While the golden calf
Rapes the virgin madness
Sabbatical potion
Infernal insanity
The out rageous orgies
Between man and animal
Make way
For pain and sadism
