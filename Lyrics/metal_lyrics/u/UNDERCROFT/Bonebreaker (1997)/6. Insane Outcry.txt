You still have time damn bastard
To deny all your principles
Otherwise we will apply the maxim
Sentence and the church will claim
Die for god, die, sacrifice
We can see you don't want to repent
Have the stars put a spell on you
Why don't you answer? are you dumb?
Well then, if you want death you'll get it
In the name of the father
We condemn you ananimously
For have injured
The perfect creation
The flames will consume you
Your flesh will slowly burn
And the power divine
Light the stake
Death to the heretic
