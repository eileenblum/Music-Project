This is the law of the holocaust
Fire of hatred upon the altar
Burn by the eternal night
The fire will never cease
The law of sacrifice
The law of sacrifice
The priest will dress in black
To begin the ceremony
Garments ornamented with gold
Will see the blood spill
Blood in the tabernacle, of the temple
Sacrifice in the name of the god
An innocent maiden
Will the ideal victim
Maggots swallowing her up
Once killed by father the sacred place
Was violent
By religion it self
Bring your flesh to the
Throne of the hill
Jehova's law command to
Stab a knife in her heart
Therefore you will get forgiveness
Your soul, in perdition
Throught the time
Sacrifices in name, of God
To kill now !!
