Rise up warriors of the night
Our war is about to begin
The thunder announces the battle
Bloody and merciless
Fire guides our steel warriors
Through the massive Christian destruction
Full with wrath well burn their remains
Come on, to destroy the empire
Come on, to condemn the unfaithful
Come on, to kill Christian
Come on, to the final battle
The blood of the gods is with us
Protecting their loyal disciples
To fight the Christian empire
That wants to dominate the world
