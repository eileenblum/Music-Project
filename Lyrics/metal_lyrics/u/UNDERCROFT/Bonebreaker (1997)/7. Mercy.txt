Them winners who tread
The battle field
Grow deaf by horrifying anthem
Of human moans that has begun
The sharpened oil soaked stakes
Are begin occupied
By the defeated ones who claim
Mercy before the tyrant Vlad
Mercy, mercy, please kill us fast
Mercy, mercy, don't make us suffer
The impaler wants to eliminate
The invaders of his empire
The impaler wants to hear the cry
For mercy at this feet
The roaring of the wind 
And the misteries of the night
Always take you towards victory
Your blessed sword under the order the dragon
Will never meet defeat
