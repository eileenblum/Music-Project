The crowd is silent
And completely paralyzed
Before the horrible act
In front of their eyes
The punisher of prisioner
Is already at the sacred altar
Ready to stick the dagger
In the chest of the naked body
The victim's terrifying yell
Breaks the mass hypnosis
They become excited
At the sight of the pumping heart
In the butcher's hands
Now this breaking of the bones begins
The priest throws the guts and bones
To the stairs of death
While the skin is troddden on
By their weird dance
It's pestilent hair entangles
With the gore it brings
