Ancient sins everlasting in time
Nightmares control my mind
Unforgettable memories
Of my life's dark past
I condemn
All the power in my hands
Owner of dreams and goals
To decide the uncertain fate
Of weak men
I condemn
Given the authority, i condemn without judgment of court
Executing the unfaithful
I condemn, i condemn, i condemn
Thousands of bastards slaughtered with rage
Spreading the pieces of bone and flesh
I condemn, i condemn, i condemn
Tearing their bodies limb
Slowly mutilating their carcasses
Far worshipping false gods
I will cut their tonguess off
For blaspheming against
I will condemn to the abyss
The ones who lies
Will eternally suffer from my punishment
