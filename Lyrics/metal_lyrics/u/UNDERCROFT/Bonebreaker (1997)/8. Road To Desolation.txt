In the last minutes i have
Before i take the final decision
Everything overwhelms me
Storming my brain, have no choice
But to end my life full alcohol and violence
Execution
Trapped in the drugs of the world
I want to find complete release
Madness invades my sense
My mind is unable to reason
Defying the all unknown
Suicide, the solution to my problems
Condemnation, the road to the desolation
Execution, step to rest in peace
