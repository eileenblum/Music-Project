"The line between inner and outer landscapes is breaking down!"
Down!

Sing the die song!

Psychiatric mistake, unnatural disaster at the end, cold-blooded killer! Killer!
Someone cry for some sort of rhyme or reason. A madman is roaming the streets! A killer!

Sing the die song!
Sing the die song!

Die! Die! Die! Die!

"The line between inner and outer landscapes is breaking down!"
Down!

Sadistic mayhem, most likely to succeed, kill so that others will be saved! Killer!
Schizophrenic delusions, voices inside your head. Why just one victim at the time? Killer!

Sing the die song!
Sing the die song!

Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

Kill! Just the pleasure to kill!
Kill! Nothing left to fear!
Kill! Just the pleasure to kill!
Kill! Nothing left to fear!

Sing the die song!

It was your duty, it was all what they asked for. Bizarre rampage, shot them one by one!
Killed! Stabbed! Dissected! Eviscerated! From 13th to 13th â¦ 13 has died!

Sing the die song!
Sing the die song!
