Inbred! Seed of dementia, seed of perversion, seed of lust!
Bastard! Crowned by sorrow, crowned by lies, die!

Bastard son! Die!
Bastard son! Kill him!

Killing the bastard son! Killing the bastard son!

Nail him! Up on the cross, high up the hill, hang him!
Bastard! Bleeding to death, crying betrayed, stab him! Die!

Killing the bastard son! Killing the bastard son!

[Solo: Vollmer]

Killing the bastard son! Killing the bastard son!

Inbred! Icon of illusion, savior of no one, die among thieves!
Bastard! Time has come, time to erase the lie! The lie! The lie!

Bastard son! Kill him!

Killing the bastard son! Killing the bastard son!
