I've seen the dying world of men's illusion,
I've seen the rotten heart of this creation,
I've seen the horsemen riding with the death!
I've seen the Devil himself burning in the fire!

The hand that turns the wheel!

I've sat at dawn waiting for the dark,
I've sat with demons, where is no fear,
I've sat at the edge of the light and the light is black!
I've sat with the Devil himself burning in the fire!

The hand that turns the wheel!
â¦that turns the wheel!

Oath taker, oath breaker!
The hand that turns the wheel!
