The lord of darkness
Claim revenge from hell
The lord of darkness
Wants to rule again
Imposing hatred and terror
On the weakest
Demons will return
The new order will rule
The armies of fire
Will fight without mercy
And celestial angels
Will fall eternally humiliated
Demons awake, revenge is near
Demons awake, revenge is near
The path is ready
Immortality will take them
To the total victory
Final times are present
Holocausts were just the beginning
The desire of revenge
Of the lord of darkness
Crashed mankind
That trembles before
The return of the demons
