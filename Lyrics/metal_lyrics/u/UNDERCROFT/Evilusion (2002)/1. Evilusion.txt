Your life can play with pain
Death plays with vengeance!
Feeling death - dripping the hope
Illusion or evolution!
All is black
The senses are over
Dead alive
Have no mercy!!!
Hear the laments
Of hollow soul
Any solution
Calm the merciless!!!
Evilusion!
Your life can play with pain
Death plays with vengeance!
Feeling death - dripping the hope
Illusion or evolution!
Evilusion!
All is black
The senses are over
Dead alive
Have no mercy!!!
Evilusion!
