"The long way to the soul recess
be marked by the fine line of sacrifice!"
I seek by any means
Break the walls of inert
Why doesn't anyone?
Bleed to Death!
If you have the blood
Write your name forever
Set your eyes in flames
And bleed to death
Eternal suffer - run over the veins!
Eternal suffer - to the end!
I search anyway
Break the walls of inert
Why doesn't anyone?
Bleed to Death!
Eternal suffer - run over the veins!
Eternal suffer - to the end!
