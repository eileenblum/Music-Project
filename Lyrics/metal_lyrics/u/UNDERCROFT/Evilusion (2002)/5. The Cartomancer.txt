Face to face with your destiny, hand
To hand with your silence
The cartomancer turn up your life, the
Weak wall of your secrets
No lies, no question ...running free the
Spell!
The cartomancer charming the air
Each card shows the way!
Sweet sin of your pleasure, flies
Beyond your fear
The cartomancer, the bridge of the
Devil, play in front your eyes!
Bleed your wound, creeping your
Path, each card shows the way!
The cartomancer ...women or men?
Are the old same demon!
Now! your fear is gone
Now! your life is changed
Tell me cartomancer about ...DEATH!!!
