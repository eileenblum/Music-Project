Cries the night in silence
Covers up the starshine
By the tears of darkness
Cries the night!
Cries the night unaware
Words of pain
Whispers of harassing
Cries the night!
Fade away the rashness
Fall down the mercy plea
With the last shadow
On the earth!
Dying eyes...beholding!
Dying ears...hearing!
Feeling from the other
Other sky!
Whispers from the other sky!!!
Whispers from the other sky!!!
Other sky unknowing
Oh!
Beyond the end
Kingdom of the other
Viskningar!
