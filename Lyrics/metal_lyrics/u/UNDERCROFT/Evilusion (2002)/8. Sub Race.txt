A sub-race of human race
It comes back
With the eyes
Flashing by blood!
A sub-race of human race
Sowing the panic
With the existence
Of sick faces!
From the dusk reborn
Of ancient time
Titanic Shadow
Black wing of death!
Forgotten warriors
They come back
Embracing us again
Reborn from the ashes!
A sub-race of human race
It comes back
With the eyes
Flashing by blood!
From the dusk reborn
Of ancient time
Titanic Shadow
Black wing of death!
A sub-race of human race
It comes back
With the eyes
Flashing by blood!
A sub-race of human race
Sowing the panic
With the existence
Of sick faces!
