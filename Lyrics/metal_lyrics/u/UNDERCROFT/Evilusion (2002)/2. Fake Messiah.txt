Hipotetic ceremony for a dead human
King of lies, king of doves, impaled
King of Jews!
Fake messiah!
I can see the tears coming for Kranion! 
Fallen by the cross, stained by the blood!
Fake messiah!
I laugh in your face!
I spit on your words!
DEAD!... savior or what?
DEAD!... savior or what?
Fake messiah!
Hipotetic ceremony for a dead human
King of lies, king of doves, impaled
King of Jews!
Fake messiah!
