Where PAZUZU yells with pain
Where carrion awaits!!!
Where death's reborn
Are temples of carrion!
It's time of the other time
It's time to remember
It's time for sacrifice!!!
Come sumerian magic
Come from chaos
When nature break the silence!!!
Rise the walls of temples
By KINGU by ABSU!!!
Ancient's temples
Chambers of shells!
Where the smell of filth and carcass
Are the smell of HUMWAWA
-abomination's lords!!!
Where the evil words are strong
And the act are filthy
You'll be inside the dark shine world
In the temples of carrion!
Where PAZUZU yells with pain
Where carrion awaits!!!
Where death's reborn
Are temples of carrion!
When the mother TIAMAT will be
Restless and rejoicing
It's time for sacrifice!!!
Come sumerian magic
Come from chaos
Come the dark shine world
In the temples of carrion
