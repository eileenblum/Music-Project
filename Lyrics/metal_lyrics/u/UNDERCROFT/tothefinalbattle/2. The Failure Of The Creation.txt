Since the beginning
The evil creation
Of human being
The appearance of the great god
But the history
Reflects the truth
In front of the eyes
Of humanity
The failure of creation
Obliteration and genocide
The range of humans
Of body lust and pleasure
Unchained before your error
To god !!!
Lord, your crucifixion was useless
Your guides and prayers
Where not heard neither listened
The pain, and hate
Are there allied
Over the world
Satan, has triumphed
The error, of god
Now, god prepares his vengeance
The last battle is near
The human race will be annihilated
But Satan, will not die
