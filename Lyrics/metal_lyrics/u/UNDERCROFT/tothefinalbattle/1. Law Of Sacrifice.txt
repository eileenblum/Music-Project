This is the law of the holocaust
Fire of hatred upon the altar
Burn by the eternal night
The fire will never cease
The law of sacrifice
The law of sacrifice
The priest will dress in black
To begin the ceremony
Garments ornamented with gold
Will see the blood spill
Blood in the tabernable, of the temple
Sacrifice in the name of god
An innocent maiden
Will the ideal victim
Maggots swallowing her up
Once killed by father the sacred place
Was violented
By religion itself
Bring your flesh to the
Throne of the hill
Jehova's law commands to
Stab a knife in her heart
Therefore you will get forgiveness
Your soul in perdition
Through the time
Sacrifices in name
Of good
To kill now !!!
It will always remain
In the twilight of time
You won't find it
The sacrifice was useless
You will never be forgiven
You will wander through the time
You won't have and end
It will always remain
This is the law of the holocaust
Fire of hatred upon the altar
Burn by the eternal night
The fire will never cease
