They swore to clean
To kill the unbelievers
To christen and cleanse
Humankind
To kill in the name of god
To get his blessing
Was the highest aspiration
For the lords of terror
Their blessed swords
In holy water
Willing to destroy
Who offend god
Lords of terror
Showing the false
World of god
Lords of terror
To breathing the eternal glory
And pleasure divine
Their blessed swords
In holy water
Willing to destroy
The cultures
That offend god
