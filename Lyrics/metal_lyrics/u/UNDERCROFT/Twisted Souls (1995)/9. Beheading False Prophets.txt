With my arms of fire
I will crush the false prophets
Who fill the earth
Hiding under the cross
I will face the servants of god
With the rage of the beast
Cutting their heads off
Mutilating their bodies
Ripping their hearts apart
Burning them at the stake
Of my inquisition
Being from the averno
Guide my arms
Messiah's emmisaries
Will try to stop me
I will alive their bodies
I will burn their souls
In the flames of hell
Brutal display of force
To slaughter the bastards
Brutal display of power
That will condemn them forever
Beheading false prophets
I will go around the world
Beheading false prophets
Till eternity...
