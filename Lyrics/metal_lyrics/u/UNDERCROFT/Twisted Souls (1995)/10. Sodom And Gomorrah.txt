Welcome to the
Evil cities
Where sin is a
Symbol of worship
Where blasphemies
Howl without mercy
And sacred images
Are spirit on
The power of god
Tried to destroy him
But human evil did
Not allow him
Sodom and Gomorra
Are not dead
Sodom and Gomorra
Are alive
Praises, ritual of war
Carrion for worms
Children holocaust
Fetus mutilation
Blood for the gods
Of sin
Evil, is still on
Hell, is on earth
