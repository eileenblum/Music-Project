Infernal angels take my hand
Through holocaust
In the bloody way
To the final battle
They kill for me
They kill for me
Pieces of flesh get together
Fragments of bones cojugate
To form my legion
Against god's law
Army risen from the graves
To unmercifully mutilate angels
To regain a place on earth
With the king of darkness
The war has no limits
They need much power
My alliance with the angels from the abyss
Secures his power
Nazarene's emmisaries
Try the stop the massacre
Everything is useless, everything will fall
To my feet, the immortal rites
In the dark, dark side
My power will never fall
