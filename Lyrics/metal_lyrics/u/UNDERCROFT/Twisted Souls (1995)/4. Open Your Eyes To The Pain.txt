Open your eyes
To reality
Existing in the world
Of twentieth century
Pace and love
Are both utopias
Reason, bullshit
Power and courage
Feed the spirits
Of humankind
Blood and putrefaction
Trigger suffering
Open your eyes to the horror
Open your eyes to the pain
Open your mind to the failure
Of bastard religion
Servants of god
Proclam morality
Servants of god
Will die in their way
To cleanse the world
Jews and muslims
Christian and evangelicals
Will die in their attempt
Of going back in time
To inquisition
Because
Their power is not real
Open your eyes
To the reality
Of the neverending road
Life cease
But your soul doesn't die
It will wonder
In the space
Of reality or lies
There's neither eden or paradise
Just your death
Blood and putrefact ion
Wait for you
Close your eyes
And die...
