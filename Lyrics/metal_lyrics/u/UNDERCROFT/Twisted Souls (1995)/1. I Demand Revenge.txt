My body is slowly
Being consumed
By the flames of inquisition
I'm to blame for saying the truth
I'm to blame for unmasking
False earthly saint
But my doctrines will struggle
Without rest through time
Until breaking the chains
Of christian ignorance
My immortal soul
Demand revenge
Before the humiliation
Done by the dawn servants
Of the god of lies
My soul !
Demand revenge
Storm of soul
Come to me and spread
My doctrines
Around the world
My soul !
Storm of spirits
Come to me and shake
The christians bastards
Who didn't comprehend me
