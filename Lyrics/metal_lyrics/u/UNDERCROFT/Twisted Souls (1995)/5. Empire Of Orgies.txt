Obscene winds
Wrap civilization
Decadent winds
That break time's boundaries
To reign from century to century
Humiliating the holy name
First it was Sodom &amp; Gomorra
And the decaying Babylon
Then Roman empire
With the merciless Caligula
Empire of orgies
Empire of orgies
Now these winds
Shake the big potencies
And third world states
While the old carnal
Pleasure practices
Make their creators
Come back to life
The decadence of the human race
Cause the increase of luxury
