Art... Addiction... War!!!

See what you get
Hear my insolences
You'll never take away
The dagger that burns in my hand!

The art of vengeance!
Art... Addiction... War!!!

Fast as the torment
Cutting you throat and your dreams
Roads to the death
Fields of spines - my revenge!

The art of vengeance!

I wanna see what you got
At the time I enjoyed my revenge
I wanna feel how you bleed from every stab of my rage!

The art of vengeance!
Art... Addiction... War!!!

There on your knees
Imploring for mercy
Here on my feet
With blasphemous weapons
I kill!

The art of vengeance!
