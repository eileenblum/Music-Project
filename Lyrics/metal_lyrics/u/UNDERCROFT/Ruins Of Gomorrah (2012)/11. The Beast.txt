[Bonus Track][originally by Twisted Sister]You can hear the thunder
Long before the storm
But you can't hear the lion
When he stalks his prey
He's moving like a shadow
Creeping up on you
And like a siren's call
He's gonna have his way

You'd better run, forget your pride
Don't make a stand, just step aside
If you don't have what it takes
Don't try to play you'll lose your stakes
Remember this at least

It's the nature of the beast!
It's the nature of the beast!

You won't hear a footstep
Comin' up on you
Movin' like a snake
He's in complete control
This killer knows his business
He is the predator
You are his only target
You're his only goal

What will you say what will you do?
Your wildest nightmare's comin' true
There is nothing you can say
No way to change, he won't delay
This Cain will have his feast

It's the nature of the beast!
It's the nature of the beast!

If you play
You're bound to lose
Don't roll the dice
Don't turn the screws
Just listen to the priest

It's the nature of the beast!
It's the nature of the beast!
