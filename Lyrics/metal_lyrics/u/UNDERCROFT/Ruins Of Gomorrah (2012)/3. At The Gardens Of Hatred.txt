In enormous shadows
covered by the poisonous rain
thousands walls from the hand of doom
cracking all this creation!

In a place where no fear grows
there stands the mountains of perish
empty hall of deadly winds
between the walls of perdition!

At the gardens of hatred!!!
At the gardens of hatred!!!

I belong to the rotten flowers, evil seeds and twisted branches!

Come, embrace the hatred!
Kill, just with hatred!
Taste, from the lips of hatred!
In my hands... Just hatred!!!

Dark graveyards of malevolent bright
where the waters of blind rivers dies
deadly moonshine tear the ground
where no life, no existence survive!

At the gardens of hatred!!!
At the gardens of hatred!!!

I belong to the rotten flowers, evil seeds and twisted branches!

Come, embrace the hatred!
Kill, just with hatred!
Taste, the lips of hatred!
.... And all it grace!!!

I belong to the rotten flowers, evil seeds and twisted branches!

The bonefires of murderers 
enlighting me in black
at the gardens of hatred again!

The bonefires of murderers 
enlighting me in black
at the gardens of hatred!
The torches of a madman melting his blood
over the petails of sorrow!

At the gardens of hatred!!!
At the gardens of hatred!!!
