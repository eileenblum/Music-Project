The image of us, you will relive forever, burned like the sun
It will be, etched forever, flowing pain
Our ecstatic pain, like disease, consumed with ease!

Until victory, no more hypocrisy,
Burning within, flowing free, through me!

Demonized!

[Solo: C. Illanes]

We'll stand alone, or we'll live the fever, no rejections
Confirmation! Until victory, no more hypocrisy

Burning within, flowing free
Burning free, through...me!

Demonized!

Be careful what your wishes are
Greed to obtain the darkness
Intended to be spiritually uplifted
Reach the balance between the opposites

Until victory, no more hypocrisy,
Burning within, living free,
Until victory, no more hypocrisy,
Burning within the flame

Demonized!
