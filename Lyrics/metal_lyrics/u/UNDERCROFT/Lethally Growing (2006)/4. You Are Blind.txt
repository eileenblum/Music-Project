It hides inside one stupid disguise
to self create a mirage of purity
offering you, your sins forgiveness
giving your self...your self away!

They are thirsty for you
from your fears they feed
they are thirsty for you!

You are blind,
in front of lies!

Their words hypnotize you
they take...advantage of your fears
your ignorance makes them stronger
you are the slave...slave to the lies!

They are thirsty for you
from your fears they feed
they are thirsty for you!

You are blind,
in front of lies!

You turn yourself into a victim
you have no spirit on your own
but you feel joy!
with the salvation they promise you!

The fear doesn't give you an opinion
your self is devoured by parasites
the fear doesn't give you an opinion
your self is devoured!

[1st solo: C. Illanes, 2nd solo: E. Belmar]

You are blind,
in front of lies!

They are thirsty for you
from your fears they feed
they are thirsty for you!
