Flowing hate, right through my veins,
burning me, please set me free!

Humiliated and stepped upon,
Punished into submission,
Stripped down of my worth,
Hate is the only opinion,
Powerful almighty force,
Devouring like a cancer,
Feeling the deception,
Increasing the tension

Flowing hate, right through my veins,
burning me, please set me free!

Aggravated and spited upon,
feeling the scorn going on,
Solitude no precedence,
Servitude and decadence,
Eternal grief is my fate,
That obscure horror will create,
Feeling of deception,
Amounting the tension

Impossible is the urge,
Bury my burden!
Unstoppable is the force,
Bury my burden!

Unleashing the rage,
Vindictive hate!

Tying your hands, keeping you silent
Assuming control, keeping you down

Reborn through pain, forever fighting
Burden of the past, now laid to rest!

Impossible is the urge,
Bury my burden!
Unstoppable is the force,
Bury my burden!

[Solo: E. Belmar]

Flowing hate, right through my veins,
burning me, please set me free!
