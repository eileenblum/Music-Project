Filthy plagues with different masks
devouring everything that's on their way!

Spit them, spit them, spit them,
...on their faces!

[Solo: C. Illianes]

They are leeches, they suck your blood
they are the cancer of humanity!

Spit them, spit them, spit them,
...on their faces!

They want you, catch you...on their net!
They want to, waste you...consume you!

They want to, have you...for a slave!
They want to, waste you...annihilate you!

But you can resist,
you can fight and never surrender!
Keep away from their masks,
stay away from their control!

[Solo: C. Illianes]

Filthy plagues with different masks
devouring everything that's on their way!

Spit them, spit them, spit them,
...on their faces!
