The journey takes me away
The distance is unknown
Between big trees, absorbing the last
...light
I walked alone, stepping careful over fallen
...heroes!
That once proudly cared
expectations that scarred the soil

Enemigo!

In my hand I drag my axe
That many lives ended quickly
Soon I'm done and can relax
Cause it can end suddenly...

Enemigo!

Now I can see above a mile
Though I try to climb over the pile
...of bones left behind...
Who will never disappear from my mind

[verse 1 repeat]

Left on the field stands my only friend
That a sunturn ago...was my enemy
We end the war as it was meant
Slowly the dark turns in to clarity
