Penetrate, Penetrate
All the simple minds
They adore, what a bore how they stand in line
Dilate, Dilate
What's my drug of choice?
It's okay when they pay they say I got the voice
Look at this the motherfucker is a millionaire
Realize it's a mask that you wear
Violate, Violate
Such a simple plan

Turn me on turn me on Mr. Deadman

Yeah I want it
I need it
To make a million
Yeah I love it
A fuckin' rockstar

Penetrate, Penetrate
All the simple minds
They adore, what a bore how they stand in line
Dilate, Dilate
What's my drug of choice?
It's okay when they pay they say I got the voice
Look at this the little faggot is a millionaire
Realize it's a mask that you wear
Violate, Violate
Such a simple plan
Turn me on turn me on Mr. Deadman
