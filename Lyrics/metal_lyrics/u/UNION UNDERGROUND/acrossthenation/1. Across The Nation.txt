Now get the guns, the drugs, from my generation.
Iâll take the fall, the saints, across the nation.
And itâs the sex, the gods, the freaks, the frauds.
Theyâre messing with me come on letâs get it on!

Move to the music play that fucking music move it to the music get it on
Move to my music play that fucking music,
Live through my music move to the music.
Move it to the music move to my music live through the music
(Test, test, test, test) Move to the music.
(Test, test, test, test) Move it to the music
(Test, test, test, test) Move to my music.
(Test, test, test, test) Live through the music
(Test, test, test, test)

Now get the guns, the drugs, from my generation.
Iâll take the fall, the saints, across the nation.
And itâs the sex, the gods, the freaks, the frauds.
Theyâre messing with me come on letâs get it on!

Forget the lies, the money, weâre in this together.
And through it all, they said nothingâs forever.
And they refuse to see the change in me,
Why wonât they wake up come on letâs get it on!
