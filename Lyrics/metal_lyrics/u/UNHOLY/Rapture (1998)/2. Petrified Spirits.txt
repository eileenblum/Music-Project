I looked thru misty eyes of future
Warped truth of plastic culture
Sublime thoughts barred into black concrete
Technical suicide tragicomic it will be
Petrified spirits
Oblivion of past
Vulnerable whisper
Cheap kiss for a second
Envy brings the cause
Blindness executes
Drive has its weapons
In playground of power
Echo of deep emotions split the paradox
Touch of speaking nature is it lost ?
Candels  of wasted life well burning
Questions of blazing consciousness calling
Glance carves visions of eternity
Meaning rides on the crest of dreams
Tomorrow caressing the waves of the universe
World shivers the glow of quilt
