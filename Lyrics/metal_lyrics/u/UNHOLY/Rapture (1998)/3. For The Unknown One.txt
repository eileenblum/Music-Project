On the altar under the sun
You may believe though he'll never come
Across the emptiness
To soothe your loneliness
To fill the hearts so hollow
To ease the seeking souls
On a rock under the sun
You may believe though
They'll never come
Across the emptiness
To soothe your loneliness
To fill the hearts so hollow
To ease the seeking souls
In here somewhere
Turning and turning again
Idols in the making
We're not the ends of everything
In here nowhere
Turning and turning again
A spirit in time
A soul craving to be recognised
Forever wrecked on the shores of solitude
The rapture of the sun the calm of the moon
On the edge of emptiness
Once meaningful is meaningless
One wonderous beast no more no less
Here I dwell in the core locus of consciousness
