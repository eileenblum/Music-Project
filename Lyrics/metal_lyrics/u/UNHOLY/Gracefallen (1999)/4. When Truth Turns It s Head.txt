World has melted into flow of thoughts
Secret hopes are hidden inside my maelstrom
Pale face in the depths of reality
For ever and ever, Life's a stroll in minor key
Sympathy of cosmic powers
Rest in the arms of sky
Self-sacrificing volition
Lost into chasm of lies
Burned into collective trance
Flagrant embrance of timeless dance
Burned into collective trance
Flagrant embrance of forgotten land

In the rapture of night
The wind is blowing thru' the head
Looks blindly lashing
Deadly shapes take their final step
Rapacious dawn
Sends night into damnation
To face itself, to born to die
To feel its spirit, to discern a world
When truth turns its head
Karma retires into its face
When truth turns its head
Silence is only what you can say
When truth turns its head
End of civilisation
When truth turns its head
It's time for a new breath

[Lyrics by Pasi Aijo]
