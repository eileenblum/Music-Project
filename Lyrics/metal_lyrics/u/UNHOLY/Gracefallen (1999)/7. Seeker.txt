No lord no other than mine. No me without my lord
Out of lord deliverance. Deliverance of Golden Cage
No evil not without lust. No lust not without need
No need without fear. Out of terror gods breed.

No rest for the one that seeks!!!
Is it Hope? Is it Fear that drives me?
Wicked are the weak in their meekness
And Hope - the evil they adhere to
No rest for the one that seeks!!!
Desperate one - haunted me!

No rest for Seeker! So many souls to skin!!!

No Evil without Lust. No Lust without Need
No Need without Fear. Soul skinner fear within
Fear of Truth - Mother of Deception,
deception - Father of Lies
Brothers of Mischief - Brothers of Lie -
Dream of Reason - Triumph of Will

"Thus Spake Elektra. In the Heart of Darkness. Under the Sun of Torment.
To the Capitals of the World. In the Name of the Victims.
I Shall Push Out All Seed I Have Taken Within Me.
I Shall Turn the Milk of My Breasts to Deadly Venom.
I Shall Take Back the World I Gave Birth to.
Suffocate the World between My Thighs. Bury It to My Shame.
Down with the Bliss of Submission. Long Live Wrath, Contempt, Mutiny, Death.
When a Woman Walks Across the Bedroom.
With Butcher's Knife in Her Hand, Then You Shall Know The Truth."
