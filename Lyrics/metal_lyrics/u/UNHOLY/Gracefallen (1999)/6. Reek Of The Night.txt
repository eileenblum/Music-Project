I searched You there
in the reek of the night
In my hour of need
You bereaved me of thy consolation
Mercy I sought I never found in you

Where were you!?!?!

Prayed for You in my plight
Lonely roaming In search of you
You turned the Lion loose into the Night

On the back of the Pale
He loves me like a beast loves its prey
I'm only passing thru'
no one may stay

Ride cowboy, Ride, for one last time
The Lion is on the loose
In the Night

[Lyrics by Jan Kuhanen]
