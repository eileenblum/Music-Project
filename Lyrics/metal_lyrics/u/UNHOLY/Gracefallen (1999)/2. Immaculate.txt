Love built this passion
Wrath wrought it strong
Know your place, noble one
Go harvest Babylon

Can't hold down this cardinal pain
cannot bear this searing flame
Hate myself raging mad
fear myself as my day turns black

"Can you imagine how it feels
when I come to you
Can you imagine how it feels
when I'm unleashed, when I'm pure"

it's the spirit of necrofilian age
to praise lifeless to praise decay
broke my rapture took away the pain
turned to lifeless, wicked, lame

"Can you imagine how it feels
when I come to you
Can you imagine how it feels
when I'm unleashed, when I'm pure"

So pure...

Rejoice you men!!!
The Bitch is in heat, again!!!
