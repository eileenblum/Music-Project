Slowly goes the night
On earth surrounds darkness
From space moonlight throws back
And clearly no one is no one in here

Somewhere outside of circle, questions, whispers
This is my place, i know, strange power
I must continue my trip eastern, hail
Fire: Strongest of everything
Air: And the whispers will be
Earth: The seal of destiny

To a big circle arrived I
But why? I don't know
I look: But I can't see
I listen: But I can't hear
I sniff: But I can't smell

The lightning from the deserted sky
I'm one of them

(I see) Flagstones surrounding me
(I hear) Screams fill my mind
(I smell) Stench of Ishtar

Blow from abyss,
struggle of soul, blood from sacrifice
Harmony of power,
materialism is lost souls win

I had rejected everything, except myself,
No prayer, no god
I'm lord of myself and I'm free to go out
