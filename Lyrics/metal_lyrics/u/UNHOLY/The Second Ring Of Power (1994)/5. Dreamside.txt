Grey beauties of my sleep
Reaching for better tomorrow
Crying the deeds of yesterday
Taking me into lockers of my dreams

Shining water's wild song
Towards the Seas of Chance
Sitting on a shore
Letting the chance come over

I see all thoughts Veiled dark
And the eyes behind the veil
Reflection of my face
Like the surface of dark lake
Shadows of my nightmares I left back

Let us fly to the rain
As if it was easy
Exciting kiss of art
Runs through emotions
To the land of truth
From one delight To another

Exciting kiss of art
Runs through emotions
To the land of truth
From one delight to another
Let us fly to the Dreamside
