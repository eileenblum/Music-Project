Was it the wind or whispers of mind
Inside me
Rumble of thunder eating my soul
In a distance
Storms and earthquakes finally begin
Closing fast

Bolt of lightning lights up the sky
Confused minds begging for mercy
Darkness surrounds this unreal world

Horizon alters red, it sparks blood and all burns
Black shadow in the sky once was the sun
Goddess of Air makes us scream with fear
The voice of crying wind heralding the end

Blood in the sky...
Light and shadow join each other...
At last comes silence

New days dawn, all begins again
Wind is crying
I feel the power, power of death
Growing fast
Is this the wind or a whisper of god
Inside me

[Lyrics by Ismo Toivonen]
