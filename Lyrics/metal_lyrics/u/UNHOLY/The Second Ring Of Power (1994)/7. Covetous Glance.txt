Oh, beauteous one Goddess of all men
She has a violent craving for me
I'm the minister of enraged copulation
Supporter of violent passion
I grew out of childlike anima to find
True personal love
Is it me who has Covetous Glance ?

Think Clearly with no forbidden thoughts
Everything is acceptable
Your animus is personification
of Dream Warrior
With four Left Hand Path symbols

 "Come o lonely warrior or drown"
...Her divine body clothed with pleasure
"Come..."

I watch Her charm with delight
Together we raise the veil of shadow
Two subjects, one will connect to Cosmos
I am the woman and you are the man

Covetous Glance
Opium Odor

[Lyrics by Jarkko Toivonen]
