How I wish
That all those gentle words
Would pour out of my lips
How my sincere thoughts
Would tenderly capture
Your yet clear mind

How my strong arms
Would carry you thru
All those dim valleys

Hear me, hear me
Try to stay away
I'm to be your doom
Oh how I wish
I was the one
I used to know

No reason for you to wither
With my wicked hollow soul
Still the memory of what we had
Will always be with me
For your beloved place
No one can ever take

[Lyrics by Jan Kuhanen]
