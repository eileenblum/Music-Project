From my past into the river of depression
Fatefull numbers caught around my way
Mutilating my past through eternity
Life is like a chinky steel...

Twisted branch of life
Feed my pain
I protect myself behind others dreams
Artistic analyse of cruel fate
Equilibrium on the stairs of past
Stairs painted by blood of my heart
Fury lightning inside my head
I'm turning towards mysteries of originality
The way is blocked by sorrow of emptiness

Heroine is locked inside the casket of oblivion
Time forgot me in the Circle of Shadows

Neverending Way
Neverending Day
Neverending Pain
