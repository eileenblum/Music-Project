Did I hear that Voice or was
it just a hallucination?
And what about those Shapes (Allies)....
For fourteen Days I haven't slept
Still my Shadow the secret of my life kept
By going through a long period of Depression

I reached a permanent state of enlightment
I'm the Master above you bunch of slaves
I'm the Demiurge, creator of this universe

Master of not-doing
I, myself not fooling
The God of not-being
Everything as it is seeing

Near my death I saw the white
Gate of Death calling
There I didn't fall in
Let Self die
Loosen Souls Dimension
For Sorcerer exhaustion brings ecstasy!
