You arrived to valley of
Endless black memories
Bloodlust starts
You notice the smell of death
Time may end, serenade will start

Procession of Black Doom
Dark shadows swallow you
Review to reality
Exclamation breaks

Fog has descended
You feel the power of
Allies of eagle
You will loose your mind

Second attention
Is too much for you
Without the Nagual
Death will Pay
A visit to you
