Five days travelled
Wakened in the land of the black desert
Rotten corpses everywhere
Endless fields, rising fear

Endless fear
Moves me on
Time has gone
Past is here

Moonlight twists my mind
Perfect silence surrounds me
Dreams turn to nightmares
The black walls of death

Ritual of horrid monsters
The cult of the evil or your sick imagination

Fear - Pain - Darkness
Destroys my mind
