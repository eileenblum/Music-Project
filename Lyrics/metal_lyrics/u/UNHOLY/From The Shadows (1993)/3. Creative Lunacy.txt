I'm trying to visualize the dream where Gadrel stands tall
Gaze bends in purple wind
My emotions come slower
Sight of my experience arrived !
Power of storms shows the vision

Covering the past

Call of attractive genius
Return to my everlasting consciousness
The consequence of needlessness is direct and dominating
The dream needs the one to escort the self through every essentiality

Ideal self: creative and lunatic
Real self: multicoloured
Oh, come to my dream Lilith
Ideal self: creative and lunatic
