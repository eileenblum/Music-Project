I'm inside of giant arche hydra
Lord of dreams passed me here
this warm slime - realm of fear
There's only one solution, use explosives,
Detonate the way out

I failed, rabid stream of worms covers me
Horrible lifeforms, I can't stand it
Oxygen is running out, I can't breath
My thoughts are slowly fading away

I sail trough colossal visions
Visions of other dimensions
Beautiful trip through eternity
I travelled through everything
Forbidden side of the universe
Earthly limitations disappeared

Strange hymn, echoing softly
Rhyme from transspace

Malformation past, present, future
I have unchained this desecrated trinity
This is my release to all lifeforms
A gift of the supreme being
