From the distant lakes to a gloomy dream
Friends of cosmos dive into the sea of worlds
Last ray of sunlight disappears and ritual begins

Shadows of the arctic mountain surrounds primitive people
Excited rhythm becomes absorbed by the shaman
Extreme suitability of emotional and instinctual forces

Wisdom of silence
Stillness of the dark
From self to cosmos

There are worlds beyond imagination
Worlds in space, aeons so strange

Honoured ancestors, the noble,
the mighty, the wise of the earth
We shall overcome the doctrine
of the demented nazarene
For the law of the strong
is the joy of the world
