The day was clear
Unknown feeling
You wake up and time stops

You leave your body
New dimension under sun
Leave earth far behind
Only in dreams you see it

Alone...

Spectrum through you
Bombastic experience
What you see you can't believe

Echo from universe
View disappeared
Now you're alone
This is twilight

See ultimate things
I'm the masters apprentice
Time of earth has ended
In everywhere are you
