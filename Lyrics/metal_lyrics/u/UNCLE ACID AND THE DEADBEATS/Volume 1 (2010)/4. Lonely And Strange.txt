I look through the window to see world passing me by.
The Harvest sun setting, the smoke rises up through the sky.
The cold chill is creeping through cracks in the ceiling and floor.
Old branches we gathered and brown leaves to seal up the door.

We won't ever change,
You know we just stay the same
I'm lonely and strange

Old October breeze as we walk through the trees to our home.
We're stopped by a farmer, an old fashioned charmer alone.

We won't ever change,
We just stay the same
I'm lonely and strange
