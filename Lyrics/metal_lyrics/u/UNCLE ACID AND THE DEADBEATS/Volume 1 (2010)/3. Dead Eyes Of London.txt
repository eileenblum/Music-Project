There was a ring of blind men
Sent by the reverend to kill
Wealthy old pigs feasting on swill
Inside the mouth of madness
The killer creeps into view
A shadow cast in torment
Coming for you

Dead Eyes of London - They're watching you
Dead Eyes of London - Follow you home
Dead Eyes of London - They're watching you

You're never coming back, you're never coming back

Down by the river
They found another man
Old fat and wealthy he fits the plan
The foggy streets are silent
The cobbled stones are slick
Blind flash of violence, you must be quick
