On a winter's cold and frosty morning she came
Eyes were glowing red to all that looked at them
What did she see, it was not me
And in her hand were coins of three

On her crooked back, the sack of crops she'd sewn
Beneath the harvest tree, she stood there all alone
And in her eyes, saw her disguise
An evil woman tell's no lies

Here comes the Vampire Circus
Come taste warm blood from her kiss
Enter the death wall of mirrors
You'll die in Vampire Circus

The woman passing steals from dead men's eyes
The sickly village taken by surprise
What do they need, the count is freed
On little children they all feed

Here comes the Vampire Circus
Come taste warm blood from her kiss
Enter the death wall of mirrors
You'll die in Vampire Circus
