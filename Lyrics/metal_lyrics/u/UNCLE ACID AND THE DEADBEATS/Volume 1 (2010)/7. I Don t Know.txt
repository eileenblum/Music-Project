I don't think anyone's here, but I have no eyes.
Footsteps I follow are clear, they tell me no lies.
I don't know what you know.

I don't think anyone cares, they don't come see me.
Left at the top of the stairs, they don't believe me.
I don't know what you know.

I feel the pain down my back, yeah.
Roll down the stairs to attack, yeah.
My sharpened nails are so strong.
I wanted you oh for so long, yeah.
I plunge the knife in your neck, yeah.
I slip on the blood on a wreck, yeah.

I should have stayed home in the night.
Because killers don't kill in the light, yeah.
