Up on the tallest mountain, there lives the highest priest
Above the bloodied fountains, below the godly feast

Do what you want to do, is what he said to me
Do what your love tells you, to do

He stopped the rain with his chanting, the villager looked to the sky
The white sun had appeared, the black clouds had gone by

Do what you want to do, is what he said to me
Do what your love tells you, to do

He raised his hand up in silence, the gathered crowd all stood still
He said he brings with him violence, just through his mind he could kill

Do what you want to do, is what he said to me
Do what your love tells you, to do
