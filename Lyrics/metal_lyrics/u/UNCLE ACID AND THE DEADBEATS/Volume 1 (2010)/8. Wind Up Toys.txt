Left up alone in the attic with the crucified picture of Christ.
There was blood on his hands and a memory from those he enticed.
The wind up ballerina dances to a tune I've heard a thousand times.
But all I've got to keep me sane is her old chimes.

Now and then I'll wind her up again.
I'll push her hair. She likes it when I'm there.
My windup toys. Windup toys. Windup Toys

I've yet to see a day of sunlight. I guess they don't want me around.
It's just me and Jesus and a gentle playing sound.
Little drumming soldier drumming and a carousel that sings and glows.
When I'll be set free nobody knows.

Now and then I'll wind her up again.
I'll push her hair. She likes it when I'm there.
Windup toys. Windup toys. Windup Toys

I'd like to go downstairs, but it seems nobody cares.
I'd like to see the blue sky and the clouds that pass on by.
I'm trapped within my cell with Jesus here as well.
But I hear that wood latch good. If I had a match I would.
