In the witch's garden,
Plants are burning red.
Hear the witches chanting,
As they raise the dead.

Man is watching from forest trees.
Man is watching from forest trees.

In the witch's coven,
Bells are tolling long.
See the spirits dancing,
To their master's song.

Man is watching from forest trees.
Man is watching from forest trees.

In the witch's sermon,
Garland passed around.
In the burning circle,
As they hear the sound.

Man is watching from forest trees.
Man is watching from forest trees.
