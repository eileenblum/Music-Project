They stood by the edge of darkness
And bowed at the end to the spell
The cue from above swept through them
As they knew this would never end well

The fire in the sky had warned them
As the marching of men came through
The elders had all decided
It was better to die than to lose

And through the haze they fought for days
They never knew
Fate's cold hand in this wasteland
Will bury them too

Further away by the ocean
The waves [...] the rocks in the land
The hardships that sailed are all broken
As the bodies washed up on the sand

Four horsemen arrived at daybreak
As the sky up ahead turned black
The cold and the rain cut through them
But they knew they would never come back

And through the haze they fought for days
They never knew
Fate's cold hand in this wasteland
Will bury them too
