Open your eyes to the nightmare
Watch as the screen flashes by
In the middle of a dream you've broken
Sleep as you mean to remember
All of your past slips away
While the children of the beast have woken

Hear the sirens of the damned for the BLOOD RUNNER
Hear the sirens of the damned, BLOOD RUNNER

Store all your memories in thought banks
File as they capture your mind
By the middle of the night, they've faded
Drink up the poison they feed you
Sit back and wait for the ride
Through the ocean of your blood, they've waded

Hear the sirens of the damned for the BLOOD RUNNER
Hear the sirens of the damned, BLOOD RUNNER
