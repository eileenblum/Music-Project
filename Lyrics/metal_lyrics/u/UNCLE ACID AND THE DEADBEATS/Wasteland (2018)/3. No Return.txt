Come taste the darkness
Fulfill the urge
Our sky is starless
As we hear the dirge
We've lived so long in silence
It's time to burn it all away

Come worship nothing
On barren lawns
Come watch the suffering of the jailor's pawns
We've gone and done it this time
It's time to burn it all away

There's just no return
There's just no return
There's just no return
There's just no return
No return
Your mind is dead
Your mind is dead
Your mind is dead
