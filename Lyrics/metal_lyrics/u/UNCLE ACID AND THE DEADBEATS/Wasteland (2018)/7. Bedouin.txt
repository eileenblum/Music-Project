BEDOUIN they've been waiting for you
BEDOUIN they've been taking from you

Oh can't you see the pain you've caused for me
Is chained forever to your heart
And when you sleep your conscience starts to creep
And cuts you right back to the start

BEDOUIN they've been waiting for you
BEDOUIN they've been taking from you

And so my friend until the lonely end
You'll have to learn to live this way
Until you find what I hope you'll find
Your soul will suffer everyday

BEDOUIN they've been waiting for you
BEDOUIN they've been taking from you

BEDOUIN the're waiting til the darkness falls
Although their hands are empty they once had it all
BEDOUIN, BEDOUIN, BEDOUIN, BEDOUIN...
