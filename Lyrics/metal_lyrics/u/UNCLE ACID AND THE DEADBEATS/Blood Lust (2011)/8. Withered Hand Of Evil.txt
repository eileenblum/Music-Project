The devil took one look, could see it in his eyes
The burning fire and sulphur smoke, reveals him from disguise
The curtain fell at once, a man behind the wall
Smiling through the broken glass his hand had cursed them all
The tricksters wicked ways, deceived them all through time
Tormenting each and everyone, too slow to the see the signs
His angel boils inside, a beast without a cage
He smashes through the world around him, blinded by this rage
Come hold the withered hand of evil as it guides you through the trees
Come hold the withered hand of evil, this all seeing eye that sees
