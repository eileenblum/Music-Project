I saw the world through the stars that crashed down
to guide me to you
You smoked out your brain through a jar, your blood lust
told you what to do
I'm here to kill you and to take you away, oh
I saw your future in time, and all of the evil you do
The mist in the sky was a sign, there'll be no tomorrow for you
And I work all alone, I don't need any one
Find the seeds that you've sown and I'll be there
