I was born a wicked man, no hopes or dreams
I get my kicks from torturing and screams
I lust for women's blood, and their evil ways
I twist my words to what the good book says

I want you, and I need you, and I'll bleed you
It's all true, I've been told to, and I'll cut you down.

My mind in purest white, in lawless land
I'll smash right through the evil hidden hand
I'm paid in drugs and gold, it's all I need
I'll take your soul and cleanse it with my greed, yeah.

I want you, and I need you, and I'll bleed you
It's all true, I've been told to, and I'll cut you down.

I'll burn you down
To save this town

Lady in gentle slumber
Wary you're not alone
Maybe, I'm torn asunder
Lady, you're not on your own
You're not on your own
