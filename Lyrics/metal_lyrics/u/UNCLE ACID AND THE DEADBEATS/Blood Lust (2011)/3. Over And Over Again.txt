The rat familiar cries out, to the witch in the village
She rises up from her hideout and screams over and over again
They couldn't kill her with fire, although her body did burn
Left on the funeral pyre she screamed over and over again
And through her eyes, saw blackened skies, I don't want to know her any more
She cast her spell on the people, could see the pain in their eyes
From the soil to the steeple, they screamed over and over again
The blood rose up from the red lake, crashing down on them all
Destroying all that's in its wake, they screamed over and over again
