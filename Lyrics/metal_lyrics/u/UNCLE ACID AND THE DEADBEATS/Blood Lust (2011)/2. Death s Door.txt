I don't know what I hold in my hand, could it be that I'm evil?
Plunder on there's no law in this land, the horror guides me through
Masterer and subjector of pain, I'm the Godder of worms
Devil's Lieger controls the insane, you'l see it when I'm through
I'll hang you higher than before
I'll leave you dying at death's door
Overruller and slaver of blood, she's impaled in the fire
Fear of god drags her name through the mud, and now her life's cut short
Dominator and firmer of sins, I'm the lord of the wastelands
Bloody hammers and burning hot pins, her story shall be told
I'm the juster and steerer of good, as they lace my hand with gold
I'll stand guard as she's nailed to the wood, no truer man than me
I'm the kind and tormentor of all, as I travel the cities
Broken peasants and mayors shall call, my BLOOD LUST never ends...
