Iâve got evil intentions
Iâll trick you with my lies
I know your emotions
Are slaves that Iâve tied
Your mind starts to wander
Through the canyon and the dust
Like a rifle in the river
Bleeding with rust

From the ashes of the morning
To the tail light of dusk
Iâve got you under the spell

I feel our connection
As I slither up inside
Iâm a snake in the tall grass
just trying to hide
Your body fills with venom
As I smile from afar
When Iâm finished with you girl
You wont know who you are

From my hideout in the desert
A bloody thirst you cannot quell
Iâve got you under the spell

The world will kill your spirit
As youâre lying in the dirt
Forget your tomorrows
You wont feel the hurt

Youâll ride out and follow
And do it as I say
A card tomorrow 
A dealer today
