I wish that I could find a window
Somewhere to watch the rain go by
I wish the darkness in the city
Would find another place to lie

Now that I can't near them scream
They need you here

I wish that I could find the killer
And wash the blood away from here
A psychopath that's out to get me,
Under a city wrapped in fear

I wish that I could wee the forest
From all the 'buildings stood like trees
So when the rain falls down in silence
I hear no terror in the breeze
