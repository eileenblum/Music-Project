I run through the valley
Out on the road 'cross the sand.
They're girls with no family;
They don't think anyone cares.

Oh I'll be your father,
Show them the love that they need.
Everything's harder and harder,
'Cause they don't think anyone cares

RUNAWAY GIRLS

I'll fight all the battles,
Throughout the wind and the rain.
Death comes as our engine rattles;
They don't think anyone dares.

Oh I'll be your family;
Death Valley Motorpsych Club.
They're all alone and they need me,
'Cause they don't think anyone cares

RUNAWAY GIRLS
