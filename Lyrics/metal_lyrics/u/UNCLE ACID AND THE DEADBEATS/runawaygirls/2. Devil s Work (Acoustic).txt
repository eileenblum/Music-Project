It was late at night when I cut the wire
I climbed the magic pole till I got no higher
All the lines to safety are slashed away
The sun has set on their final day

I'm the Devil
And I'm here to do the Devil's work

As we walk through the gates of heaven
Our numbers multiplied from one to seven
With our reflection on the TV screen
No violent death remains unseen

I'm the Devil
And I'm here to do the Devil's work
