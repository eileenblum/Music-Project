Just like a china doll
Her face was glazed and clear
I knew I had them all
Under my spell of fear

Valley of the dolls
Valium blood walls

And then I sent them off
In darkest danger night
Into the piggy trough
All dressed in vinyl white

Valley of the dolls
Valium blood walls

Beyond the valley of the dolls...
Beyond the valley of the dolls...
