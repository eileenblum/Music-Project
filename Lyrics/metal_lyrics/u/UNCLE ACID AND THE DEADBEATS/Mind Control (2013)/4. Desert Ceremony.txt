And when the circle starts to burn
Out on the highway
The highest priestess brings the urn
She knows her body will return

Out on the dusty desert wind
The ceremony will begin
And when the light comes round the bend
We know the Earth will meet its end

But we won't have time
To ignore the signs
And the screaming will start
But we won't mind
Won't mind
Because there's nothing left for us to find
