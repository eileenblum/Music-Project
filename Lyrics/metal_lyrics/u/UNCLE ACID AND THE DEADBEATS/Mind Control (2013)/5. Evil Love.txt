When I left home for you
I had nothing to hide
Now I'm a prisoner locked inside

You gave me drugs and lies
And programmed my mind
Now I'm a killer that they won't find

You need our love
Our evil love

Now I have TV eyes
That flicker with pain
Like Hollywood faces in black cocaine

They took my empty heart
And filled it with hate
I must escape before it's too late

You need our love
Our evil love
You're here
To our programme
