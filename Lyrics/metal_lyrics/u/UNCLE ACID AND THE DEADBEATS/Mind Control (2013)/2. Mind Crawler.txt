When I came down from the mountains
I had BLOOD on my hands
When I came down from the mountain
To cross the desert sands

And I knew just what I had to do

I took a motorcycle
Rode through the gates of hell
I took a motorcycle
And I'll take you as well

And I knew just what I had to do

I wanna know
I wanna know
Just what you could do
And would you die for me too?

Because I might go mind crawling on you

I'll stand up high on the altar
As my words seep into your brain
I'll stand up high on the altar
To start my terror reign

And I knew just what I had to do
