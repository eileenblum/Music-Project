I'll show ya God on the highest
Up where no one can see
Up where no one can find us
But me

As you look through the window
Of your mind getting high
You won't know that we're all here to die

They don't know
They don't know, there's nothing up there at all
They don't know
They don't know, there's nothing up there

As we climb up the mountain
Through the clouds and the snow
Through the blood in the fountain
We'll go

As we all reach the summit
Where the truth shall retire
To the darkness below us
Afire
