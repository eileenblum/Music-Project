A creaking howl
Black wings upon it's back
The unbaptized apparition
Circling until dusk

Entombed beneath the soil
Lies the heedful
Unending redemption
Thy Predicted Faith

Nocturnal watcher
Thy chant is heard
Forsaken hunter
The bell toll's for thee

Befouled raven's
Blighted herd's
Man's creational perdition
The face of all our fears

The nightmares horror
Eternal sentinel
Obedience compels
Thine is the hour at hand

Nocturnal watcher
Thy chant is heard
Forsaken hunter
The bell toll's for thee
