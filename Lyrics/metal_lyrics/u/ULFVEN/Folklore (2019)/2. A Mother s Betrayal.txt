In the deep dark forest
In a forgotten grave
The wretched slumbers
A tainted child, guided by grief

Hidden by his mother, to hide her shame
But under the moonlit pine, echoes itâs cry

Wakes up when itâs dark, to quench the thirst
Screams out loud in pain, to sound infernal

Killed to claim salvation
But still she feels afraid

He just wants a name, heâs unbaptized
But at least he wants to rest in wedded dust

Wakes up when itâs dark, to quench the thirst
Screams out loud in pain, to sound infernal
