Beneath the mire
In the obscuring woods
Something crawls within the fog
Feline eyes, watches me
Whispers of grief calls to me

Deep within, she dwells
A faceless wraith
Accursed child
Lost in aeon's
Keeper of the hymn's

The moonlight draws her out
Aimless wander, until dawn
Her cries, echo's through the moor
As the hunter she call's

Forlorn guardian
I hear the sorrow in your song
Damned to walk alone
Forlorn guardian
I see your burdens toll
Forever to be carried

Thy oath that you spoke
In conjunction with death
A pale resemblance holds you now

Harvested since long
As the roots holds you down
To always be scorned
But I see you nigh

Haunting screams have kept you afar
A conjuring darkness roams you now

Forlorn guardian
I hear the sorrow in your song
Damned to walk alone
Forlorn guardian
I see your burdens toll
Forever to be carried

I release you from this torment
For I have seen your beauty
As the stream carries you home
Rest now your vigil watch has ended
