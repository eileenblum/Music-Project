Within the forest
At the roots of the mountain
The orphan's cry is heard
Feeble and lost
Only afflicted
By the dying mother's words

"Kindred child,
Cherish the thought of hope
As you set out
From the heart of the mountain
As a lurking shadow you rise
Shrouded by the autumns guise"

Born from temptation
Burdened by solitude
Forever searching for it's kin
Knows not the sin
Nor the heresy of it's birth

Vernal tears
Like dewdrops on a meadow
Caress it's cheek
Like a mother's touch

Beneath the willow
The youthful withers
Embedded in leafs

A once hopeful has faded
Unending seasons has past
Sorrow take's it's heart
As the final breath speaks clarity

"Kindred child,
Cherish the thought of home
And don't set out
From the heart of the mountain
As a lurking shadow you will fall
Shrouded by the autumns cold"
