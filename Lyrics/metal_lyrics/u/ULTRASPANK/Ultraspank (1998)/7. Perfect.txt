Clinging to a hope dust that makes me choke a tiny piece of dirt happiness 
assured can't be too far can't be too hard, traction having slipped, i think 
i've lost my grip, mine but not for long, mine, think i'm losing pressure 
think i'm losing ground, think i'm losing pressure think i'm losing ground, 
down falls down hurts me much less so good, so good so perfect like how 
could, how could how could you try what for, what for what better life once 
more, once more it all slips by me...again by me think i'm losing pressure 
think i'm losing ground think i'm losing pressure think i'm losing once more 
put it in a package of perfect like leave it in package of perfect size 
never opened up and it can't slip by it all slips by.
