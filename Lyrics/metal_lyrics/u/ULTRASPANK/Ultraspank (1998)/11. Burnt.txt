Crawled from my hole
Covered in Mud
Forced my face up
towards the sun
Burnt
This happened to me once before
Now I make myself go back again
They've known me
Smothered me
Forget life and accept
Then I wait
I don't need you
(I don't need to know)
We'll be down here
(Live without a clue)
I don't want you
(You resist me)
Came here to exist
(I don't want all of this)
Rubbing me out
Pushing me down
It's picking me up
Stooding me on
Starving me
Surviving me
Starving me
Surviving me
Leaving me
Still see the gap
They've known me
Smothered me
Forget life and accept
I don't need you
(I don't need to know)
We'll be down here
(Live without a clue)
I don't want you
(You resist me)
Came here to exist
(I don't want all of this)
Rubbing me out
Pushing me down
It's picking me up
Stooding me on
Burnt
