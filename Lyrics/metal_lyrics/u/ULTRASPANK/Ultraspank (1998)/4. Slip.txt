Lifting up from this
Balance under pressure shifts
Feel the gears slip
Feel the gears slip
Strain
Nothing ever lifts
Nothing ever lifts
Drain
Nothing ever shifts
Nothing ever shifts
Wiping sweat from battered brow
Dreaded thinking living now
Feel the years shift
Feel the years shift
Strain
Nothing ever lifts
Nothing ever lifts
Drain
Nothing ever shifts
Nothing ever shifts
Again
And I've been here before
Bled
Again
The machine turns out more
Blackened from the dirt
My vision seared and blurred
Here beneath the wheel
My face against the steel
Clutching at the earth
Where is my support
Falling into line
Is losing what is mine
Falling into line
Losing what is mine
Here beneath the wheel
My face against the steel
