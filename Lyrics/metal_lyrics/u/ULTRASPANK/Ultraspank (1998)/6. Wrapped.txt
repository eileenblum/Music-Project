Hold me to the light all this for me arms wrapped around me
breathe out gold cold hold me to the light hold me to the light all this
for me arms wrapped around me breathe out gold cold all i could want all i 
could need
all i could feel all i could see damn myself am i safe bought myself a 
better
life gave myself a reward a worse hand was never dealt a worse hit was
never felt damn myself am i safe back myself paid the price back myself
bought you a better life told me to the light see what i just might offer up
forgiveness think that i'd forget this? with all i could want with all i 
could need with all i could feel with all i could see bought myself a better 
life gave myself a reward a worse hand was never dealt a worse hit was never 
felt hold me to the light all this for me arms wrapped around me i don't 
think so.
