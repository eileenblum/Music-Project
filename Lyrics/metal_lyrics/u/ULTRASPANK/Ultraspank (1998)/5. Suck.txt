an icy grip creeps over me a shivering glimpse of what's about to be think 
that's all it's gonna take think that's all there is at stake it should be 
getting easier i don't know what it is i feel myself falling apart i wish i 
could start...again i wish i could start again i wish i could start i've 
known these parts i've known this loneliness i've known these parts i still 
feel misinformed on this suck until there's no way out is just what this is 
all about suck until there's no way out must be a better way suck until 
there's no way out suck until there's no.
