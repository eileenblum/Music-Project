You've found my need of last time
I could leave the worse kind
Imposing like it's over now
Reaching out wrong
I still wait
Holding my blessing back
I still wait
Holding my blessing back
Underneath a death hand
Underneath realms
I still wait
Holding my blessing back
I still wait
Holding my blessing back
You know I can better see black around
You know I can better see light down
You know I can better see against yours
You know I can better see against yours
It's your life
Your life
Your life
Your life
Wanting me then
Taking the steer and
Imposing like it's over now
Reaching out wrong
Burned, burned
Burned, burned
All the way
Your eyes
All the way
Your eyes
You know I can better see black around
You know I can better see light down
You know I can better see against yours
You know I can better see against yours
It's your life
Your life
Your life
Your life
