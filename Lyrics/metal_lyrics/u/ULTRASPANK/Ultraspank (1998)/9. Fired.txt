Feel I'm waking up
Feel I'm breaking lose
Start begin to turnin
Feel the inside break
Fired
Push it to the red line
Push it to the edge
And it starts to unwind
Last call sucker
Holds you steady
As it starts to shudder
Fill me with her f**king lies
Fill me with her f**king lies
Fill me with her f**king lies
Fill me with her f**king lies
Crashing through the bassline
Leaving in the dust as you beat in decline
Mold, I'll crush her
Selling our skin as it fuels you within
Fill me with her f**king lies
Fill me with her f**king lies
Fill me with her f**king lies
Fill me with her f**king lies
Burnt
These f**king lies
I figured out
I feel alive
I feel alone
I feel alive
I feel alone
I feel the pressure
I said, give up
I feel the anger
No anger
I feel the pressure
Said, give up
I feel the anger
No anger, say it
Fired
Push it to the red line
Push it to the edge
To begin the unwind
Soft hill sucker
A wind within so that I could begin
Told you we would f**king learn
Told you we would f**king learn
Told you we would f**king learn
Told you we would f**king learn
Repent
Repent
Repent
Repent down
Cursed
Hurt
Cut
Oh
