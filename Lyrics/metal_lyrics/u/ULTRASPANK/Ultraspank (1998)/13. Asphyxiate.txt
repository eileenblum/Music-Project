i see the things that you do 
i see the people you screw 
i see the world that you make 
i see the mess you create 
i see you contaminate 
with your refusal to wait 
a mouth that's dripping with greed 
you destroy with your need 
and there's nothing left 
and there's nothing left 
same m.o. 
waste 
watch it grow 
i see you bump into walls 
i see you stand up and fall 
i see you stretched out and dry 
under the new sun you fry 
you stare directly ahead 
to pull yourself from the red 
you pull the rug from your feet 
to glue the ends that you meet 
and there's nothing left 
and there's nothing left 
same m.o. 
waste 
watch it grow 
don't you fucking deprive me 
you offer what you can't give 
you take what once made you live 
with steps you can not retrace 
you need a past you erased 
and there's nothing left 
to this endless lie 
take it down 
same m.o. 
waste 
watch it grow 
don't you fucking deprive me
