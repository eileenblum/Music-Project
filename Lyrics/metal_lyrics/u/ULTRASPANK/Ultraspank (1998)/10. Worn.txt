Working too hard
Keep myself thin
Wearing the scars
Of where I haven't been
Yearns, yearns
Yearns, yearns
Working so hard
Grown this far
Clutching the charts
I've always torn apart
Nations worn down
They're just fooling around
Threating your world
Released in my ground
I'm up against an old brick wall
I've tucked my nails in
Hanging to the same old sore
Here is where I know I've been
All alone
Towards the end
Raise myself again
All alone
I'm killing this soul
Convince myself again
Covered in sin
Carrying the stones
Cease fire, fire, fire, fire
Killing these lies
Killing these lies
Killing these lies
Killing these lies
All alone
Towards the end
Raise myself again
All alone
I'm killing this soul
Convince myself again
Working so hard
I'm innocent
I'm wearing the scars
Of what I haven't been
I'm up against an old brick wall
I've tucked my nails in
Hanging to the same old sore
Here is where I know I've been
All alone
Towards the end
Raise myself again
All alone
I'm killing this soul
Convince myself again
I'm telling this for
All my friends
Tell it like it is
