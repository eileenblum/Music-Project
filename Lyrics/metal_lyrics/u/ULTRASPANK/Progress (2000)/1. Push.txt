I've felt the tap
on my shoulder
I've turned around
and grown older
I feel it burning
on the horizon
the orange glow
I've never known
push
I've been left here out in the cold
it's nothing different a story of old
a thin line push in close
a thin line no one knows
push
see it down
push
see it drown
how'd I get here
what have I sold
I can feel it within
I can feel it begin
it's hard down here
with just an idea
that's never clear
push
I need something to bring it down
I need something to hold it down
it's hard
down here
with just an idea
that's never clear
never told me
what you wanted
only sold me
what you needed to
I need something to bring it down
I need something to call my own
the thin line
push in close
a thin line
no one knows
I need something to bring it down
I need something to hold it down
