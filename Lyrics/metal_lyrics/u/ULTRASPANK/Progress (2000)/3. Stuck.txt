find me wherever
I hide myself away
always there beside me
despite my efforts to shake
I must lose this shell
unleash myself
brand new
own me forever
strip my life away
always there beside me
despite my efforts to break
I must lose this shell
unleash myself
brand new
try to shed my skin
tearing me within
from you
lift me
above this
climb to nothing
must be something
to redefine me when I fall apart
and sure to find me when I've gone too far
to pick up the pieces when they come apart
to realign me on my way
