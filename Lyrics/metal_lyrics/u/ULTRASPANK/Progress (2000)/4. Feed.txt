under
it's dark
right now
release me
I've come this far
I'd don't need you
right
I don't miss much
I don't miss you
see right through me
convince me that I'm wrong
feed me this line all twisted
convince me to be strong
did it before
and you'll do it again
step on my toes
as you call me a friend
your massive attack
is to prey on the weak
let the fun begin
every time you speak
under
inside
right now
release me
