just in time
to steal what's mine
uprooting
again
cold and blind
can't feel what's mine
unpleasant
surprise
who was I
to think that I'd
not be here
again
days unwind
as time divides
and sweeps then
all away
rust and time
are finally
catching up
stay away
push, push away
I throw another useless moment away
to reach me
to leave this place behind me
to lead myself away
to leave the guilt behind me
to clear the path it made
fade away from me
fade away
stray from me
fade away
stay away
push, push away
I throw another useless moment away
to reach me
