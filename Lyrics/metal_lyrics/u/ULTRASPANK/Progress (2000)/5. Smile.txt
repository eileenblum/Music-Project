I don't know enough about you
to leave myself wide open
and I don't know when I've had enough
to remove myself from you
try not to think it out
try not to act it out
cut it shut it keep it down
never let it leave the ground
I gather up what you'll give
but it never helps fill the sieve
because I don't know enough about you
to leave myself wide open
try not to think it out
try not to act it out
cut it shut it keep it down
never let it leave the ground
it doesn't matter anyway
when it's all said and gone away
accumulate experience
accumulate experience
time goes by and within it's smile
you think you'd find a way
but it seems so hard to pick apart
it is so far away
it's only what it means
and never what it seems
it's only in the eyes of me
it circles to the end
it lives to upend
that's only when it starts again
times goes by and within it's smile
you think you'd find a way
but it seems so hard to pick apart
it is so far away
times goes by
it seems to hide
it is so far away
and all the while
it beams this smile
it is so far away
it is so far
