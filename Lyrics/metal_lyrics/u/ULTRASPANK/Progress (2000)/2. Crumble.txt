staring at the empty
I need to move along
choose to see it your way
leaves me all alone
I need to find a reason
I need to find the answer
I need to pick it apart
I need to make sense to restore confidence
so what so what you're too good
for what for what you once stood
so what so what you had it all
so why so why the big fall
leave you all behind me
leave you all alone
with all there is before me
where do I belong
I need to rise above this
I need to pull the rug out
I need to rip it apart
I need to make sense to restore confidence
so what so what you're too good
for what for what you once stood
so what so what you had it all
so why so why the big fall
look at you now
wouldn't you know
try to save a face
time won't erase
permanent
evidence
now
crumble
