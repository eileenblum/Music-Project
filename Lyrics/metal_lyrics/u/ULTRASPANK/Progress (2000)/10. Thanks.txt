invite yourself in like a bad case of fleas
parasitic ploy fills and obvious need
set me up
cut me down
cash me in
spit me out
thanks for nothing
stealing the fire from the unsuspecting
freak
opportune time to perpetuate the breed
set me up
cut me down
cash me in
spit me out
thanks for nothing
the pressure builds
the balance sets
the level tilts
as thoughts compress
try your best you will
to bury my head in the sand
keep me lost in the dark
with the promise of a new spark
played me
drained me
tried your best
to win
played me
drained me
you try
try
plowing your way through a delicate maze
crushing the dreams that a lifetime made
rest will come away as the planets fall in line
karma piling up will catch in time
set me up
cut me down
cash me in
spit me out
thanks for nothing
played me
drained me
tried your best
to win
played me
drained me
you try
try
sit down
