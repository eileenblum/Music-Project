there
somewhere out there is a better day
somewhere out there has to be
better than today hopes to be
anyway
to be a part of anything
shows me what I've missed
to be a part of all the answers...
my wish
stand there before me
with your emptiness, emptiness
so true to form
so true to all I've missed from you
to be a part of anything
shows me what I've missed
to be a part of all the answers...
my wish
I've run from you before
and closed this door
to be a part of anything
shows me what I've missed
to be a part of all the answers...
my wish
I'll miss you anyway
and I'll miss you anyway
