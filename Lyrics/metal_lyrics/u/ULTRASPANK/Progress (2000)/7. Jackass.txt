all grown up
made your mother proud
hey look at me
sitting on my cloud
weak frightened little boy
meek the source of so much joy
think you lie above the rest
on your head the golden crest
preach a word we can't believe
preach a word we'd never need
speak about me
speak tell me how you feel
think you lie above the rest
on your head the golden crest
preach a word we can't believe
preach a word we'd never need
save us would you from the fire
save us would you from the liar
tired drowning man
tired drowning man
bigman
not so big
running of the mouth
is what brings you down
so pathetic convoluted
how do you get by
try to revive
try to survive
try to realize
bigman
not so big
running of the mouth
is what brings you down
speak about me
speak so I might see
you don't belong
bigman
not so big boy
big
