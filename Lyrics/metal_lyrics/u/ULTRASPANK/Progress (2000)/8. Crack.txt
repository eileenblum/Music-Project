I don't know what's growing on the inside
but I do know how it looks from the outside
surprise...suffer
never before...until you dropped
arrogance has swept you off your feet
as you celebrate the many ends you meet
surprise...suffer
never before...until you dropped to the ground
in the mess you built for yourself
you bury your fingers
in the shards of what you once prided for
carry your need to feed
upon your shoulders
crack
you can't support
the weight of your mistakes
building walls in accolade of your wins
you missed the world that lives beneath
your chin
never before
bury your fingers
in the shards of what you once prided for
carry your need to feel
upon your shoulders
crack...you can't support
the weight of your own mistakes
