Stare of a eyes so black
Cold, inhuman and bottomless
It draws you nearer
To hand and lose a soul

Arousal of flame, the embers, ash
Every heart holds the key to damnation
The sinner's blood

The great shadow is closing in
From realm of hell he calls
The name written in book of death
A soul for Satan to claim

The embers, ash
The sinner's black blood
