It feels like years
On this star-shed path
For human light
Now accept our offering

Moon's web
Breaks the crust of winter
Crying dark north
At the face of dream

Eyes of intent bear down they bear down on
The ice that gleams that frosts the blood by
This night my god now it boils and the shine
We hold inviting our life into you and yes
We are the blasphemy you never knew...

Stones cleared
With the word of ages
Knowers ascend
By this sidereal bath

Winter
Die
