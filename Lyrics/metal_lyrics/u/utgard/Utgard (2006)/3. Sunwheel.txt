Eternal winter, impenetrable
Grey brother has swallowed the warmth of sun
With the northwind reaches a distant croak
And all lays barren and cold

All that our forefathers fight for,
Was forgotten and lost
Cursed brood of traitors,
Brought infidel values and blood

Few were the men of northern glory
Who rode across the snowy hills
To sacred place of their gods
For rite to unleash the winter of ages

The gods spin the wheel of sun
Cast the blizzards and deadly cold

Forever are we,
Under the northern sky
At these valleys and the hills
In forests dark and thousand lakes
Even when we are died our ghosts shall march

For their fatherland,
The voice of northman still echoes
Hail, Hail, Hail...
