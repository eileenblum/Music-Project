The sombre castle stands upon the hill
Cold walls that kill the last rays of sun
Winter night laid itÂ´s frosty grip
To veil the valleys and forest dark

Ghost of midnight
Cast the morbid shadows
In the nakedness of the moon
Thy minions howl

Evil gave life
To tormented spirits of old graves
The fog scratches the windowpanes
The Devil works undisturbed

Ghost of midnight
Tyrant of northern darkness
It haunts to steal your souls
With hate to drink your blood

Phantom of night, life eternal
Coiled in wings of darkness
Grim and evil, the lord of nightmares

Before the pale gleam of dawn
Ghastly visitor has left itÂ´s mark
Belltower tolls mournful tune
Once again hearse drags the deceased

Ghost of midnight
Cast the morbid shadows
It haunts to steal your souls
With hate to drink your blood
