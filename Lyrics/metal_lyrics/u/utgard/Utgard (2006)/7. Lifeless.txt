Darkness builds around
All is silent
This cold soil
Will be the grave

Dreams of child
Turned to dust
Under the old skin
Yearn for sleep

Ages ago, shadows have eaten the soul
In this field of frost, there's only death

Dead emotions
No human inside
Malicious grin
On scarred lips

Vanish to ground
Where once came
This cold womb, solitude
Is the nameless grave
Cold, without light
For lifeless

In this field of frost, only death
