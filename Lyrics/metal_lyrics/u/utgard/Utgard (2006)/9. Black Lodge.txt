Wind is restless
Rain whips my face
I stagger blindly
Into the wood's shadow

Mad stars spat on
Every sound contains a mocking tone
Light is shattered
And left my body

Seeking salvation of somekind
From solitude and death
A wreck, collapsed by despair

There it stands in the glade
The black lodge
And I enter,
Nothing but an empty vessel
Beg to be filled
With new light... with new darkness...

Fire walk with me

Behind my mask, turmoil has stopped
There's a new meaning, in life and death
My purposeful steps, lead me out
Carrying the black flame, planted in my heart

Wind is calm
Rain finally stopped
