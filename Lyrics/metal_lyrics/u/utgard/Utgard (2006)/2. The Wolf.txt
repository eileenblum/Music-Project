Fearful legend told us
He was born from womb of night
Crawled out of hell
Dressed with sin and evil

He wears the mark
Of the devil
And is cloaked
With wolf's skin

Lock the doors
For fullmoon is risen
With his diabolic howl
He lures your children

In the woods he stalks
Lurking in shadows
Serving another victim
To his hellish frenzy

Howls,
Heart rending at the night of wolf
Blood,
On the leaves fallen marks death
Satan,
Planted his seed in every man
To kill,
With shape of beast when moon is high
