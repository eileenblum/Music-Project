Shadows and night are one with me
And cold darkness fills my life
I am wandering here eternally
On a path of sorrow

In the forest I walk alone
Crystallic ice covers the trees
And thick snow falls from the nightsky
Under the evershining star of the north
I was born and I will die
And then my soul shall rise with the wings of winter

The cold northern winds blows into my soul
I stand on the forest and watch as the snow falls
This winter-night feels so everlasting

The night birds on a beautiful sky
And wolves carry my name in their midnight speech
Shadows of the past reflect from my eyes

Thrones of black ice I see
The wings of northern winds I feel
Towards the thrones I walk
With cold wings my spirit is free
