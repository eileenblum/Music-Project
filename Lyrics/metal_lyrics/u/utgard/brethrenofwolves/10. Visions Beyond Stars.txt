On the windswept hills I walk
Cloaked by the winter-nights veil

With the moonrise by the moonlight
Views from ages of shadows
Reflecting, silently reforming
Under the opening stargates
Which bleed their haunting light upon me
Gather images, mirror to the other world

Once upon this frozen ground
Dragons spread their wings
Sorcerers and laws of steel
This mighty kingdom rules supreme

Lost and forgotten beyond the realms
Yearning entered to my soul
Shedding it's painful memories
Visions and the key that makes them live again

Once again upon this frozen ground
dragons spread their wings
Sorcerers and laws of steel
This nightly kingdom rules supreme
