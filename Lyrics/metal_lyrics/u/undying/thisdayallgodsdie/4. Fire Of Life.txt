THE FIRE BURNS WITHIN AN INCANDESCENT FLAME
KINDLED AND REKINDLED
THE FIRE OF LIFE BURNS FOREVER

SELF CONSUMED AND RENEWED
EVERYPLACE AND EVERYTHING IN THIS UNIVERSE
SHARE IN THE BLAZE, NO ONE AND NOTHING IS EXEMPT

HUMANITY - BORN FROM THE COMMUNITY OF LIFE
YET SOMEHOW WE SEPARATE OURSELVES
FROM THE WORLD TO WHICH WE BELONG

NATURE'S LAWS (DIVINE LAWS) - WE DEFY
AN UNRELENTING WAR WAGED AGAINST CREATION
THROUGH PROVIDENCE
I WILL SURRENDER MY ONLY LIFE

THE FADING SUN CARESSES THE HORIZON
NOW IT'S TIME TO FINISH WHAT WE'VE BEGUN

TAKE A LOOK AROUND - WATCH THIS WORLD SLOWLY DIE
TO DUST CORRUPTED VISION
HUMAN OR NOT - LIFE WILL GO ON

LIFE ETERNAL

SELF CONSUMED AND RENEWED
EVERYPLACE AND EVERYTHING IN THIS UNIVERSE
SHARE IN THE BLAZE, NO ONE AND NOTHING IS EXEMPT

THE FIRE OF LIFE
