UNDER THIS BLOODRED SKY
I OFFER THIS TORTURED FLESH
TO GODS UNDER YOUR HEAVENS
MY SOUL SPENT WORTHLESS

LAY THIS LIFE DOWN

BRING ME DIVINITY
TO ANSWER CRIME WITH THEIR LIES
BR ING FORTH THE ARMIES OF GRIEF
RANCID BREATH OF AN ANGEL DISEASE

FEED ME TEARS OF A MARTYR'S LAST CRY
MY FLESH TO YOUR FLESH TO DUST AS WE --- DIE

IN THIS WORLD BOMBARDED BY BELLOWS OF MADNESS
I CLING TO THE LONELY CHAMBERS OF MY MIND
SCRATCHING THE SURFACES
SEARCHING FOR SOME SANITY

UNDER THIS BLOODRED SKY
I OFFER THIS TORTURED FLESH
TO GODS UNDER YOUR HEAVENS
MY SOUL SPENT WORTHLESS

BRING ME DIVINITY
TO ANSWER CRIME WITH THEIR LIES
