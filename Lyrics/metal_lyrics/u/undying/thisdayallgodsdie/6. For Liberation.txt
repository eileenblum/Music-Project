(INTO) THE BIRTH OF CARNAGE
WILL YOU BUT WATCH WHEN INNOCENT LIFE
IS BORN AND DESTINED
TO AN UNJUSTIFIED WRETCHED EXISTENCE?

I REFUSE TO DENY THEIR PAIN OR IGNORE THEIR SUFFERING - I FIGHT FOR LIBERATION
ASHES ON ASHES WE BUILD THEIR FATE
WITH BLOODSHED UPON OUR HANDS

CRIES - OH WE WHISPER OF THEIR DEATH IN BLOOD, OF THEIR MISERY TO FLESH A VICIOUS PRICE
DRIVEN TO NIGHTMARE WHILE WE COULD SLEEP

I REFUSE TO DENY THEIR PAIN OR IGNORE THEIR SUFFERING - I FIGHT FOR LIBERATION

ASHES ON ASHES WE BUILD THEIR FATE
WITH BLOODSHED UPON OUR HANDS
ASHES ON ASHES TREAD OUR PATH TO DEGRADATION

THEIR BLOOD UPON YOUR HANDS
PRIZED WITH GIFTS OF DOMINATION
THEIR BLOOD UPON YOUR HANDS
OUR FALL TOWARDS DEFILEMENT

A WAIL IN THE SILENCE
A SHREIK FROM THE DARKNESS
ONE LAST DYING BREATH

SCREAMING TONGUES FLEXED WITH CRIES FOR MERCY

I'LL FIGHT FOR LIBERATION
