where the footsteps of one culture tread
the righteous still sing
as we march to the tune of "humanity's" hymn
a restless night awaits the dawn of a silent spring
our mythos and this way of life
have led us astray - disconnected
we've stepped outside the circle and into the reign

for they so loathe the world
children search for heavenly bliss
and abandon this sacred earth
damnation - the chance I am willing to take
for life everlasting I return to the womb

day by day - from birth
page by page - the script we enact
to an unsound story of conquest and glory
by a culture about to collapse
blood flows from the fountains
of bondage and brutality
(this captive earth to flood)

as one whom the mother caresseth
so will I comfort you

through every waking moment
the pleading whispers of mother culture
are spoken softly in my ears
begging me to turn my back
instead I shun her lies
with the truth of a newfound worldview
I'm deaf to salvati on's cry

for they so loathe the world
children search for heavenly bliss
and abandon this sacred earth
damnation - the chance I am willing to take
for life everlasting I return to the womb

my blood for her blood, my breath for her breath
back into her arms, to the place we belong
mother culture reborn and I again to the earth
to break the chains, to give freedom a name
and put the life back in living
