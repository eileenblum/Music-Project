there is a place in hell for you
for each minute suffered, for each day survived
paradise lost to heavens and hells
have we emerged as that fallen grace?
as adam who casts the first stone
as eve who is first raped

sister rise up to take your place
shatter our hearts - rearrange us as one
so I may know beauty as well as hate
sister rise up to take your place

...and she writhes in tear-stained sheets
through fevered nightmares and whispered screams
gifts of filth from a heaven divine
revealer of secrets and bringer of lies

as silently death is companion
through each breath of death she takes
hers is an anguish he can never know or understand
under the shelter of his heaven we dance
and await the violations his angels bring
in this world that is hell

sister rise up to take your place
shatter our hearts - rearrange us as one
so I may know beauty as well as hate
sister rise up to take your place

shatter our hearts and rearrange us as one
have we emerged as that fallen grace?

for she who is lost
for she who is shamed
for she who the world looks black
wonder not whose heaven crushes you
when sin and slavery is all that is offered you
