Male sirens deceiving with chants of berserkers,
unsteady uniforms in those who never faced war,
sword only wielded in front of bright friendly flashes,
the hammer of Thor bound around hippiesÂ´ necks.
They take from old horns the merry drinks of peace,
they stain the great causes for which they say to fight,
happy female-music warriors cannot lie to us at all:
as soon as NÃ³tt brings war they leave us in their flight.
Weak luminaries pervading the dark airs of Helheim,
feeble glimpses of idiocy from ethereal social words,
human decay is now drinking from our coldest fountains:
to keep our waters clear we must mix them soon with blood.
Black mountains crumbling down to only dust and ashes,
manhood eclipsed by bitches barking from their homes;
while legions fall under the fagsÂ´ spell of word and image,
we come back to state out loud that we are...
Proudly alone in war!
