[performed by Usnea]elder gods rise from the ocean
destruction human garbage
wastrels nameless the world
cleansed by ice deep water
the tarot war wolf the deep one blank card
the stars configured
in shapes and patterns
our sacrifice must be worthy
minstrels that plucked
swansongs of demise
now burning in oblivion 
immolated on a
pilgrimage to dead gods
all has been in vain.
