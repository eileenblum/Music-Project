Godless, godblessed? Godhead, behead it. 
Yahweh, Mithra, Baal, Beelzebub. 
delirium dreamt, darkness plunged,
a great beyond, the vastest void
blackest jest, a bleak comedy,
synapses fire, in cosmic aberration.
illusions, shadows, delusion 
assailing every last neuron, in a failing mind
now utterly relieved , of conscience and consciousness.
torture, the blind, the terror, of god. 
infects, our minds, infects, our children
intelligent design? or sadistic cruelty?
baffling devastation, a disgusting premise.
Find the meaning, in absolute filth...
Lying in ruin, until the lie is truth.
