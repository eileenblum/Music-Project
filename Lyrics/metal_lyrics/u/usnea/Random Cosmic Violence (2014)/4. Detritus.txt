Echoes of destruction fill the void
With existence comes pain, a hollow ascension 
knelt down sprung forth apostasy River Lethe
darkness nemesis anthropos in repose
Elysium emanation ashen waste defiled
stamped out in Asphodel mourning streams of woe
mythos sullen to reckon meaningless lies
To explain transcendence in modern lexicon
The order corrodes, annihilation is all
Nothingness' edge, Oblivion's gate
our folly of hubris, mists close in
Detritus, lamentation, for ourselves we cry
