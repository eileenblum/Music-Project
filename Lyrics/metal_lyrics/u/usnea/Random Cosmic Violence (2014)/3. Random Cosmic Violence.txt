epochs of pandemonium 
whence order corrodes to chaos 
demonic aberrations
of the cosmic condition, conditioned. 
salvation tantalizes with delusion 
comeuppance visited by illusion
incredulity at the mire of
cosmic savagery, grotesquery
helpless in vain, no document of pain
demented plight, no glimpse of light,
eternal night, born just to spite
absence of right or wrong
Just ever seething on... until all is gone. 
Star Death Submission
Black Time Dilation
Event Horizon 
Dense Space Formation 
Nebulous Creation Ignition 
Chaos Bind Destruction
Starts Begins with Ends. 
Infinity's edge, the dark horizon 
Light falls, no escape 
Turbulent clouds spin in Space
Sucked in, Time infinite 
Sights seen in new dimensions 
Matter crushed to quantum beginnings 
Parties shifted, planes upended 
At the edge you see no ending 
Energy recycled for stars and beings 
disorder abstraction collision diffusion
