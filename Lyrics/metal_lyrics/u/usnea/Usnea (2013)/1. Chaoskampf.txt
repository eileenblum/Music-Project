The wolf, the wolf descends 
Darkness, the chaos reigns
The howl echoes in the tress
The prey, the prey heightens 

Fangs bared it leaps beset clenched down
Blood sprays sweet death, apex

The man, the man ascends
Lucid, god's chosen form
Concrete razes the tress
The chaos, the chaos dissolves

Of wolf and man, the blood sustains
Nature is god, her will is strong
Transition absolved, entropy is law

From chaos to death, false dominion
The serpent falls, the coup de grace 

Man's wall will end nature takes us all
Behold! The blackened heart of man
Covetous of ascendancy
Marauding transfixed just on slaughter
Oh!, for the living a her 
Inheritors of grave conquest

Purveyors of violence reach the summit
Of all the paths before us, we choose cruelty
Eternal tumult unlocks our infallible malevolence 
Oh!, For the living a debt
To shoulder the burden of death
Sequestered taken lives
Manipulated broken souls
Now mournful at the edge of the abyss
