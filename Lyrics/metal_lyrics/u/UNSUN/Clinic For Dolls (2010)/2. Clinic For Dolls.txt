She ran to the door â now impossible
For her to pass
Night as a guard
On the other side of time

She said â it will pass, after all
It must end
She said â I'll return transformed
With the power of places
Time crumbled into grains of sand
Traces of fillings
How to remove the spell?

Clinic for dolls
White rooms, beds in rows
Clinic for dolls
Clinic for dolls
White ladies with aching souls

She said â what will be
Will be, tough luck
And she walked the night down the path
Of nightmares
Refused to listen when he told her
The World will harm you
How to, how to, how to, how to
How to remove the spell?

Clinic for dolls
Glass eyes, dead smiles
In the Evil carnival

Clinic for dolls
Ballet of shadows with empty hearts

Clinic for dolls
Glass eyes, dead smiles
In the Evil carnival

Clinic for dolls
Ballet of shadows with empty,
Empty hearts.
