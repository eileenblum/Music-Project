Why are you not here,
I'm waiting for you
The hour is late
Outside a full moon
I look in the closet
With all of my dreams,
Hung on the hangers
are our memories

Single touch, a single stare
The air stood still as thick as glue
Like inspiration, out of nowhere
You changed the world I knew

Time so slowly runs
I yearn for a day
When longing shall pass
When I finish this game
You're finally here
Your face full of sorrow
Caused my heart to chill
And burned my eyes hollow

Single touch, a single stare
The air stood still as thick as glue
Like inspiration, out of nowhere
You changed the world I knew

We walked in the forest
Picking blackberries
Your basket was full
Of blood-red raspberries
And just as a bolt
That comes from the blue
Your unspeakable sorrow
Into my basket flew
We walked in the forest
Looking for flames
Walking barefooted on the ground's
Solid frame
And just as a bolt
That comes from the blue
Your unspeakable sorrow
Into my basket flew

Single touch, a single stare
The air stood still as thick as glue
Like inspiration, out of nowhere
You changed the world I knew
