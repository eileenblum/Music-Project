Alone I look for the way
Hoping youâre waiting for me
Where the hostile world has no say
That is where I always want to be.
Where my eyes want to follow
When Iâm far, far away
When life brings me sorrow
Into silence I escape.

Among the stars
there is a place
to where my heart
always returns.

Alone I look for the way
Hoping you're waiting for me
Where the hostile world has no say
That is where I always want to be.
Where my rush of thoughts
In oblivion drowns
To forget the evil lot
I will sleep in safe arms.

Among the stars
There is a place
To where my heart
Always returns.

There I always have some time
To heal every wound,
To help the life's shine
Long forgotten, return.
There is such a place,
My own little space,
After each lost battle
Its power remains.
There I always have some time
To heal every wound,
To help the life's shine
Long forgotten, return.
There is such a place,
My own little space,
After each lost battle
Its power remains.

Among the stars
There is a place
To where my heart
Always returns.

There is always some room
When the world brings me gloom.
