In the purple glow of the fall
In shivering, chilled arms of trees
Struck with the very last breath
Our love like a dragonfly flees
In the purple glow of the fall
In shivering, chilled arms of trees
Struck with the very last breath
Our love like a dragonfly flees

Why? Why? Why? Why?
I keep asking, Why?
Obsession, depression
Resurrecting the past
Same fear in the eyes
Same fighting for air
Time turned dusty grey
The evil steps echo

Why?

There is no need to look for the culprit
Maybe there is no one to blame
Life is sometimes been unfair
It gives us love and then takes it away
There is no need to look for the culprit
Maybe there is no one to blame
Life is sometimes been unfair
It gives us love and then takes it away

Why? Why? Why? Why?!!...

Someone slam the door on my heart
Run down the stairs without...

Someone slam the door on my heart
Run down the stairs without...

Someone slam the door on my heart
Run down the stairs without...

Someone slam the door on my heart
Run down the stairs without saying sorry.

Why? Why? Why? Why?!!...
