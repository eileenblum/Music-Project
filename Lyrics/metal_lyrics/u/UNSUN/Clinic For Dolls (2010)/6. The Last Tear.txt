Something out of me flows...
Love so unrestrained flees.
Slowly becoming less
My tears turn into seas...

I tore down the wall,
Armed well my own heart
Banished grief and pain
And made tear depart...

I'm not scared of the places
Where my heart hurts the most.
I'm not scared of the moments
My mind full of ghosts.
I'm not scared of the words.
That cut like a knife.
I'm not scared of dreams,
When it's hard to survive the night.

I hide from the world, my blurry eyes.
I don't reach out for help, I never ask why.
Kind God refuses to hear my requests.
Uncertainty chills the heart in my chest.
Slowly becoming less
My tears turn into seas...

I'm not scared of the places
Where my heart hurts the most.
I'm not scared of the moments
My mind full of ghosts.
I'm not scared of the words.
That cut like a knife.
I'm not scared of dreams,
When it's hard to survive the night.

Something out of me flows...
Love so unrestrained flees.
Slowly becoming less
My tears turn into seas...

I'm not scared of the places
Where my heart hurts the most.
I'm not scared of the moments
My mind full of ghosts.
I'm not scared of the words.
That cut like a knife.
I'm not scared of dreams,
When it's hard to survive the night.
