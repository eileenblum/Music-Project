I ceased to say what I feel
I didn't stop feeling, did I?
It's an eyesore to hear something real
Slowly faith also dies
Silence fails to bring salvation
Maybe there is none at all?
I will not find the direction
To places where hope still strolls

One word and a word too much
Was spoken between us tonight
Broke the calm before the storm
Tore the velvet of the night

Now live the way you like
Don't ask me how I feel
When words are full of spikes
No thoughts ever seems to be real
When our ways, our ways again
Go apart and we can't carry on
Why play on, why remain
Maybe rain, maybe wind
Will bring back faith to us

One word and a word too much
Was spoken between us tonight
Broke the calm before the storm
Tore the velvet of the night

I ceased to say what I feel
I didn't stop feeling, did I?
It's an eyesore to hear something real
Do what you want, live as you like
The turmoil of words we know
I don't want anymore empty terms
What will be time will show...

One word and a word too much
Was spoken between us tonight
Broke the calm before the storm
Tore the velvet of the night
