When rain washes blood off the ground
Down the shadowy path I'll come by
When you utter your last sin aloud
My star will shine in the sky
When time decides to kill
When time closes our eyes
Our sins will vanish in tears
The ground will hush our cries

And the rain keeps falling outside
As if crying on our behalf
And the wind keeps howling outside
As if screaming on our behalf
And the rain keeps falling outside
As if crying on our behalf
And the wind keeps howling outside
For the eternal soul that I have

When the blood is washed off by rain
The sky will never shed tears again
I will utter my one last request
In silence my sadness will rest
And then time once again
Will open our eyes
The glow of new life shall reign
What was turned to dust shall rise

And the rain keeps falling outside
As if crying on our behalf
And the wind keeps howling outside
As if screaming on our behalf
And the rain keeps falling outside
As if crying on our behalf
And the wind keeps howling outside
For the eternal soul that I have

When time decides to kill
When time closes our eyes
our sins will vanish in tears
And then time once again
Will open our eyes
The glow of new life will reign

And the rain keeps falling outside
As if crying on our behalf
And the wind keeps howling outside
As if screaming on our behalf
And the rain keeps falling outside
As if crying on our behalf
And the wind keeps howling outside
For the eternal soul that I have
