Empty and strange
Bad omens catch the rain
Outside
The wind howls

All the years lost
Like fools we spent most
Of our lives
You and me

Not enough warmth
Hell was too cold
Shivering hands
And dark

Love's gone away
Ultimately slain
By our final
Night...

I thought you said
It's for the best
If nothing last
Forever

This night will grow old
And the sun so cold

I thought you said
It's for the best
If nothing last
Forever

This night will grow old
And the sun so cold

Not enough to say
On forest ways
And whispers as quiet
As night

In order to live
We need to believe
As long as we
Still can

Not enough dreams
To go down the stream
To places where light
Flickers

When in dark mirrors
Emptiness whirls
And heart wander
In fog

I thought you said
It's for the best
If nothing last
Forever

This night will grow old
And the sun so cold

I thought you said
It's for the best
If nothing last
Forever

This night will grow old
And the sun so cold

Not enough warmth
Hell was too cold
Shivering hands
And dark

Love's gone away
Ultimately slain
By our final
Night...

I thought you said
It's for the best
If nothing last
Forever

This night will grow old
And the sun so cold

I thought you said
It's for the best
If nothing last
Forever

This night will grow old
And the sun so cold
