I've changed my world
When you were away, I'm waitingâ¦
That is my truthâ¦ without you
That is my escape

I close my eyes
You disappeared behind the doors of my heart
I can't listen to your lies
I don't hear your bitter words

I can't look in back
I search for my love
I search for my luck
I can't be taken care of

I close my eyes
You disappeared behind the doors of my heart
I can't listen to your lies
I don't hear your bitter words
I close my eyes
You disappeared behind the doors of my heart
I can't listen to your lies
I don't hear your bitter words

This time has been lost
Never were together,
And never will beâ¦
Now you suffer the most

You light my fire when I fall
You light my fire when I fall
You light my fire when I fall
You light my fire when I fall

I close my eyes
You disappeared behind the doors of my heart
I can't listen to your lies
I don't hear your bitter words
I close my eyes
You disappeared behind the doors of my heart
I can't listen to your lies
I don't hear your bitter words
