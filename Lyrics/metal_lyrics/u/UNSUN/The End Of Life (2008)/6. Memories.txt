I drown in the oblivion
In the grey ashes of my dream
Never looking back
I don't hear anymore the bitter words
Every night the nights moaning wakes me up
I hide my face in your hands
Save me please from my fears

I have the spell on the merciless time
The pain and grief that grow within us
I have the spell on the merciless time
The pain and grief that grow within us

I drown days with tips of my fingers
In the grey mist
Too late for the tears
Shed too soon Bitter Ocean
I drown days with the dark rain of sorrow
I wash off the blood
If we don't live there
Will be only fog misty days

I have the spell on the merciless time
The pain and grief that grow within us
I have the spell on the merciless time
The pain and grief that grow within us
