I know nothing about life
All the wisdom is hidden deep in the heart
I am scared of the upcoming days
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on my way

My boat is cruising over there,
I want it and I know where
I am handling my life to destiny
My boat is cruising over there,
I want it and know where
I am handling my life to destiny
My boat follows in the wake of you
I am handling my life to destiny
I don't know what future will bring to me
My boat follows in the wake of you
I am handling my life to destiny
I don't know what future will bring to me

Everyday I meet the ghosts of the past
Darkness is left behind me, but I'll be free
Someday in my life the light will shine
I'll forget the past before the dusk comes up

My boat is cruising over there,
I want it and I know where
I am handling my life to destiny
My boat is cruising over there,
I want it and know where
I am handling my life to destiny
My boat follows in the wake of you
I am handling my life to destiny
I don't know what future will bring to me
My boat follows in the wake of you
I am handling my life to destiny
I don't know what future will bring to me
