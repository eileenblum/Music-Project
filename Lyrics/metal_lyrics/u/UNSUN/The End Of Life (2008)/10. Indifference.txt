There's a horned demon in my heart
Eyes â they are pitch-black
The face in the mirror isn't really me
I'm walking the line between good and evil

There's a horned demon in my heart
Eyes â they are pitch-black
Indifference is my queen
A black cloud seems to follow me

I fail to weep; I have lost faith and hope
I drift in the ocean of lost reliance
I fail to weep; I have lost faith and hope
I drift in the ocean of lost reliance
I fail to weep; I have lost faith and hope
I drift in the ocean of lost reliance
I fail to weep; I have lost faith and hope
I drift in the ocean of lost reliance

There's a horned demon in my heart
Eyes â they are pitch-black
I standing at the gates of hell
I smell fear; the back of beyond is near

There's a horned demon in my heart
Eyes â they are pitch-black
I hurt more than I thought I would
I will not be cute, I will be a brute

I fail to weep; I have lost faith and hope
I drift in the ocean of lost reliance
I fail to weep; I have lost faith and hope
I drift in the ocean of lost reliance
I fail to weep; I have lost faith and hope
I drift in the ocean of lost reliance
I fail to weep; I have lost faith and hope
I drift in the ocean of lost reliance
