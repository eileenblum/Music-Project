I don't want to hear the lies
I don't want to see the pain again
I don't want to think, I just wanna feel
Take me away from this place
I don't want to hear the lies
I don't want to see the pain again
I'm closing doors to my past
Keep your promise and bring me to heaven

Keep your promise and bring me to heaven
Take me away from this place
Keep your promise and bring me to heaven
I'm tired of being afraid
I've lost my hope of a new day
Keep your promise and bring me to heaven
Take me away from this place
Keep your promise and bring me to heaven

I don't want to cry no more
I don't want to regret the things I've done
I don't want to miss you when you're gone
Take me away from this place
I don't want to cry no more
I don't want to regret the things I've done
I don't want to see the pain again
Keep your promise and bring me to heaven

Keep your promise and bring me to heaven
Take me away from this place
Keep your promise and bring me to heaven
I'm tired of being afraid
I've lost my hope of a new day
Keep your promise and bring me to heaven
Take me away from this place
Keep your promise and bring me to heaven

I don't want to hear the lies
I don't want to see the pain again
I don't want to think, I just wanna feel
Take me away from this place
I don't want to hear the lies
I don't want to see the pain again
I'm closing doors to my past
Keep your promise and bring me to heaven

Keep your promise and bring me to heaven
Take me away from this place
Keep your promise and bring me to heaven
I'm tired of being afraid
I've lost my hope of a new day
Keep your promise and bring me to heaven
Take me away from this place
Keep your promise and bring me to heaven
