Lost between heaven and hell,
They were able to kill each other
Only screams were coming out of their mouth,
Only screams it was like a bad dream
Lost between heaven and hell,
They were able to kill each other
Only screams were coming out of their mouth,
Only screams it was like a bad dream

It's too late to reclaim the lost dreams,
The merciless world made them victims,
It's too late for the tears that've been shed
They'll never grow up blinded by hatred
It's too late to reclaim the lost dreams,
The merciless world made them victims,
It's too late for the tears that've been shed
They'll never grow up blinded by hatred

Sometimes everything was all right,
They were able to talk together
But only, only for a while,
Their love has made everything better
Sometimes everything was all right,
They were able to talk together
But only, only for a while,
Their love has made everything better

It's too late to reclaim the lost dreams,
The merciless world made them victims,
It's too late for the tears that've been shed
They'll never grow up blinded by hatred
It's too late to reclaim the lost dreams,
The merciless world made them victims,
It's too late for the tears that've been shed
They'll never grow up blinded by hatred

They were able to kill each other,
They knew nothing of one another
They were able to kill each other,
They knew nothing of one another

It's too late to reclaim the lost dreams,
The merciless world made them victims,
It's too late for the tears that've been shed
They'll never grow up blinded by hatred
It's too late to reclaim the lost dreams,
The merciless world made them victims,
It's too late for the tears that've been shed
They'll never grow up blinded by hatred
