There is something in her soul,
It is pain, I know
Why is she so sad?
What is the secret
Of her deep sorrow?

Her innocence is lost,
Somebody took it away
From her by force
It's so hard to find
The sense of life
It's so hard to find
The sense of life

There is something in her eyes,
She was crying every night
There was someone at the door...
Tell me the truth, tell me more

Her innocence is lost,
Somebody took it away
From her by force
It's so hard to find
The sense of life
Her innocence is lost,
She never will be
As she once was
In her eyes there will be fear,
That will never disappear

There is something on her mind
My little girl leave the past behind
His soul will burn in hell,
This will put an end to your pains
There is something on her mind
My little girl leave the past behind
His soul will burn in hell,
This will put an end to your pains
