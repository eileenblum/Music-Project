I would like to know what it will be like
Tomorrow, in 10 years and longer
Together or alone, you and me
We will grow old someday
We will be close to each other,
When I'll breathe with my last breath?
My body will become ugly
We are closer to the point of death

You can't stop the time
You must know that you and I,
We will grow old someday
Don't ask me never again:
What for? And where do we aim?
You can't stop the time
You must know that you and I,
We will grow old someday
Don't ask me never again:
What for? And where do we aim?

I would like to know if your eyes
Will be looking for me
Together or alone in our life
Our future is a great mystery
I'm scared, I'm frightened
I don't wanna be alone
I trust our love's might,
Like nothing I've ever known

You can't stop the time
You must know that you and I,
We will grow old someday
Don't ask me never again:
What for? And where do we aim?
You can't stop the time
You must know that you and I,
We will grow old someday
Don't ask me never again:
What for? And where do we aim?

Together or alone? We are closer to the point of death
Together or alone? We are closer to the point of death
Together or alone? We are closer to the point of death
Together or alone? We are closer to the point of death

You can't stop the time
You must know that you and I,
We will grow old someday
Don't ask me never again:
What for? And where do we aim?
You can't stop the time
You must know that you and I,
We will grow old someday
Don't ask me never again:
What for? And where do we aim?
