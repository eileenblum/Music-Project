Blood,
Covering my teeth
Force
Fists of Iron
Itâs nothing but hunger what I feel

Death,
Beyond any age
Instinct
Born once again
Iâm hungry not for blood but for revenge

Welcome to the underworld,
Where white gets its darker side,
Welcome to the clan that see the light
We are gonna dance across the blade.

Suck,
Human flesh
Kill,
Those I hate
The traitors that stole me what I cared

Sun,
A matter of light
Race,
For keeping alive
Christ has come inside to drink my wine.

Welcome to the underworld,
Where white gets its darker side,
Welcome to the clan that see the light
We are gonna dance across the blade
