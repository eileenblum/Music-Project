You can call me the beast
If you think I look like that,
But Iâm still looking for my beauty,
despite the fact that I'm kind of mad.

Many years have passed
Since the last time I saw the sky
In my castle surrounded by hawthorn
I observe my life going by.

Oh, have you seen that creature in the dark,
Breaking the mirrors at the beat of Gothic jazz.
Lying beneath a leave of frozen grass,
Lying in your rancor, lying in your heart

Can anybody tell me how to reach my goals in life?
Can anybody show me what I am not doing right?
Can anybody tell me what the people really think?
I know I can do it, just, if I believe.

My hands are full of blood
Wetting my stone made claws,
You better donât never ever
Look at my half-moon eyes.

My lips are interrupted
By an orgy of shiny fangs
My voice sounds like the demonâs
Choir of cats.

Sometimes I feel like trash, as a mistake in the earth,
I canât find the way for leaving weeping, rancor and hate.
I try to be optimist, buy every failure still hurts,
Then the beast awakes and the beauty goes mad.

Can anybody tell me how to reach my goals in life?
Can anybody show me what I am not doing right?
Can anybody tell me what the people really think?
I know I can do it, just, if I believe
