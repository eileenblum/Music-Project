Dear friend, you, who are suffering the yoke of the state
Itâs only fear what they live for: be brave
Dear friend, you, who are suffering the result of the hate,
This fighting is long, so be strong

I wanna drink in the roof of a bank
Singing rock as if I were in the Bastille
I will juggle with your head if freedom is dead
I need no ties, I'm a in the Bastille

People do not think about how free they could be,
If they just acted the natural way.
No masks, no lies, not to pretend how happy they are,
showing faces smiling to a flash.

I wanna drink in the roof of a bank
Singing rock as if I were in the Bastille
I will juggle with your head if freedom is dead
I need no ties, I'm a in the Bastille

Sometimes in the dark I don't feel the same,
But walls are hard enough
to not to make them fall.

I wanna drink in the roof of a bank
Singing rock as if I were in the Bastille
I will juggle with your head if freedom is dead
I need no ties, I'm a in the Bastille

Being oneself as a way of rebellion!
Just think that prejudice is based on ignorance and fear

Tell me how can I find reasonable way to explain
Life is short, be strong be brave
