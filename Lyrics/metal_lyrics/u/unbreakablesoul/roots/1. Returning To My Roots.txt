The open mind is a glorious tool for escaping from yourself,
Every time I follow a star I end up lost in the depth
So we must follow our own breath to find light in mess
Carry your failures to an urn of ashes putting your head on your neck.

We must insist on stealing time the seconds it took apart,
Transcendental memories to be rebuilt from sadness to the sands
Living the life you want to or watching opportunities pass,
Counting every minute weâve been wasting is nothing but a trap.

I will go back (I will go back)
Lend me some time (I will go back)
I donât know how
But I want to feel like that again.

Open a book and travel its pages tasting the smell of the ink.
Your brain is an excellent landscape full of ideas and sensations to feel.
But there are fires and nasty animals trying to make the forest disappear,
Promise forever youâll take care about it and I will rest in peace.

I will go back (I will go back)
Lend me some time (I will come back)
I donât know how
But I want to feel like that again.

Returning to our roots,
Itâs something we can choose,
Maybe you haven't realised,
But you are a fire in the grill

Go to the mirror and see,
What is what you want to be?
Maybe you havenât realized,
But you are a fire in the grill

Shall I change my dirty clothes just because theyâre dirty?
I would rather change them by subtracting old beliefs,
Everything surrounding me is nothing but burned leaves,
I was in civil war but now the chieftain is asleep
