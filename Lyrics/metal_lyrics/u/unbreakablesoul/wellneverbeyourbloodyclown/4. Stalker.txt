The window is open and I tend to think,
How special is the people walking through the streets,
Beauty, handsome, unreal and cool,
How I wish I felt the same way they do.

I know you donât know that Iâm the man
Whoâs watching you through the looking glass,
Observing every little step you walk,
Iâm your secret stalker that searches for your talks.

Youâre that kind of person everybody loves,
The heartbreaker, the leader, the ultimate boss.
I feel so small when I look at you,
How I envy those cool persons that I use to look.

Yesterday you told me it was a coincidence,
But casualties are lies, just remember it.
Iâve become a suicide expert for you.
Was it the destiny? I donât think so.

I know you donât know that Iâm the man
Whoâs watching you through the looking glass,
Observing every little step you walk,
Iâm your secret stalker that searches for your talks
