Sun is closed,
Thereâs no road in the sky.
Silence remains on the earth,
Our last kiss was mine.

Sun comes closer,
For spoiling my rest,
Love is not healthy,
I decide to put an end.

Heart feels lonely,
Locked in its cage.
Aurum is dying
As I recite this page.

Iâve been loving two persons at the same time,
I did not forget you, not even the other can I.
Summer has dead for a while.

Sunâs been eaten,
By that gluttonous moon,
That naughty moon,
Makes my eyes wither.

Autumn is quiet,
Cause you don't walk the streets.
Days are rivals,
I can hardly defeat.

Life is so short,
I canât even live until the next dawn

Until the next dawn Iâll wait

Both, pick me out of the floor
of my life,
of my soul;
Aurum is gone
