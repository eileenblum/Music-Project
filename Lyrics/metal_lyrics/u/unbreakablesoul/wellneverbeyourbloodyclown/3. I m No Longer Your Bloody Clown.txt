I was the God of your arms,
The prince of your personal dream lands.
I was your priest and you followed my teachings,
But then your fidelity broke down.

Drink the bile of the overfall of my mouth,
I'm no longer your bloody clown.
Keep strong, cause I'm gonna use my thorns,
Now it's time for me to say "I won't".

Now it's time to reconstruct the fort,
For shooting Hell and take the way to the sky,
For looking there for what I was made for,
To call myself "The new Godâ.

You ignite me yesterday,
But now I return from the ashes.
One day you loved me,
But I resurrected the third day.

Drink the bile of the overfall of my mouth,
I'm no longer your bloody clown.
Keep strong, cause I'm gonna use my thorns
Now it's time for me to say "I won't".

Now it's time to reconstruct the fort,
For shooting' Hell and take the way to the sky,
For looking there for what I was made for,
To call myself "The new God"
