Through my life watching their faces,
Some of them canât see my eyes.
Their lives seem to be happier than mine.

Inside my mind thereâs an obsession,
Absurd, I know, Iâm not that mad,
I always know whatâs really true or bad.

A reality beyond what really happens (Obsessive)
An illusion of your head you just imagine (Obsessive)
I just canât live with this hell inside me (Obsessive)
Do you dare to be free?

Now my dreams sleep inside me,
Now my force is going down,
I canât pass the barrier of the sound.

It seems so crazy ask for help,
That I prefer to stay alone,
I hope my anxious heart will hold my soul.

A reality beyond what really happens (Obsessive)
An illusion of your head you just imagine (Obsessive)
I just canât live with this hell inside me (Obsessive)
Do you dare to be free?

Do you dare to find the way out?
Do you dare to find the might?
Do you dare to take the liberty train?

Itâs all on you, believe in faith,
Donât pray; donât waste your time away,
Love yourself, relax and follow meâ¦

A reality beyond what really happens (Obsessive)
An illusion of your head you just imagine (Obsessive)
I just canât live with this hell inside me (Obsessive)
Do you dare to be free?
