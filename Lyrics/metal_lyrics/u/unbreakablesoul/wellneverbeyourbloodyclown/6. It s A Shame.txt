You are lying in your bed,
It feels so comfortable.
But five hundred miles away
Youâll find âthe unbearableâ.

You have your own home,
Your bed, your I Phone.
They have blood in walls instead,
And hope is pretty dead.

Youâ¦ why donât you ask yourself why?
Why do you enjoy a âgood lifeâ?
Ask yourself for a whileâ¦

Let your mind wake,
Open your eyes and observe,
It's a shame!

The only thing you know
Is what they tell on television.
They show you what they want to show,
And you exceed their expectations.

Itâs difficult to find the truth,
On newspapers or TV.
It seems that we donât want to watch,
The harsh truth of reality.

And never say itâs useless,
If you do nothing is your blame.
Keep your dreams in mind,
Together we are the snowslide.

Donât believe a word from them,
Besiege the congress, change the game.
Itâs time for us to take control,
Come to life, there we go!

Youâ¦ why donât ask yourself why?
Why do you enjoy a âgood lifeâ?
Ask yourself for a whileâ¦

Let your mind wake
Open your eyes and observe,
It's a shame!
