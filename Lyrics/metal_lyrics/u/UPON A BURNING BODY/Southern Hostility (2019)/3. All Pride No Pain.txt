I can be the war
You can be the victim
I can be the sum of all your deepest fears
You will either follow close or step aside
In our sites you can not hide
You know the less you take the more you'll be
To leave behind a legacy
And I feel alive!
I feel alive!
I won't give up on you
Not yet no no no no!
Fear none show strength
I won't give up on you
Your life, your name
All pride, no pain
All pride, no pain
All pride, no pain
I feel alive!
I feel alive!
Fear none show strength
I won't give up on you
Your life, your name
All pride, no pain
All pride, no pain
All pride, no pain
