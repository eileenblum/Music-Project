Look into their eyes
If you're gonna dig the knife
Can you do it? Can you do it?
You failed at life
And haven't even fucking gone through it
Look into their eyes
Dig the knife, can you do it?
Can you do it?
When my sight's on you
You're fucked
Where I'm from
You better prey to god
I come from a darkness you'll never know
And I smell the fear inside your soul
Fuck sake what you want me to say
Run I won't stand in your way
Bite your savior's hand
You'll never understand
Look into their eyes
Try to find a light
Can you do it?
When my sight's on you
You're fucked
Where I'm from
You better prey to god
I come from a darkness you'll never know
And I smell the fear inside your soul
You don't know what it's like to live in fear
What you think you know is a fucking lie
I come from a darkness you'll never know
And I smell the fear inside your soul
I come from a darkness you'll never know
And I smell the fear inside your soul
