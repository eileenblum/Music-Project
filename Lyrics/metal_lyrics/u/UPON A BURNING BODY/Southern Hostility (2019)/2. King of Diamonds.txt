No one gets left behind!
It's fucking no man's land
So watch what you say
Choke on the violence you're fed
No words are spoken
No room for debate
Just run straight through the ones that you hate
Power, strength, and virtue
Failure won't deter you
We will never surrender
Here on the front line, it's a war
Never forget what you're fighting for
No one gets left behind!
Power, strength, and virtue
Failure won't deter you
We will never surrender
Here on the front line, it's a war
Never forget what you're fighting for
Here on the front line, it's a war
Never forget what you're fighting for
Never surrender
We are all born for battle
Let power reign!
Here on the front line, it's a war
Never forget who you're fighting for
Here on the front line, it's a war
Never forget who you're fighting for
