When the light is near how far will you crawl
When the weight bears down will you rise or fall
Every avenue will lead you to pain
And when you hear the roar of the crowd you'll know my name
Dig to where demons come from
Run when you find 'em
Dig to where demons come from
Run mother fucker cause you found 'em
You better start running
The storm is coming
You better start running
The champ is coming
Talk is cheap so tell me what's it gonna be
There's only one way to the top and that's through me
Show me what you got cause I'm never gonna stop when I'm gunning for you
What you gonna do when the bell rings and they yell and new
You better start running
The storm is coming
You better start running
The champ is coming
You better start running
Because a storm is coming
You better start running
The champ is coming for you
Dig to where demons come from
Run when you find 'em
Dig to where demons come from
Run mother fucker cause you found 'em
You better start running
