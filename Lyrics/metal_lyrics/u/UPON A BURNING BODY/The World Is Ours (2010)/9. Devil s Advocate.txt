If you had to ask me how hard it must be to walk the path that I have chosen, then youre already to weak to even try
You dont have the heart
The struggle, the sacrifice, this is the only thing I know
Its complicated, some say its overrated
This is happening all because of you
This is the dream they said we would never have
Countless years
Weve sacrificed everything to spread the infection
Yeah, so bang your head
Would you fight for what they say is already dead to the point of suffering
This is the path where you dont have to die to go through hell
This is the birth of hate and death of love
We will decimate the human race
Creating the words of your salvation welcome to a new age, a rebirth
This is, this is the birth of hate
Its too late for your salvation
So who the fuck is laughing now?
The struggle, the sacrifice, this is the only thing I know
Its complicated, some say its overrated
This is happening because of you
Its a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll
Freedom baby is never having to say youre sorry
So when the fix on at full strength and you cannot stop your hands from shaking, whos side will you choose?
