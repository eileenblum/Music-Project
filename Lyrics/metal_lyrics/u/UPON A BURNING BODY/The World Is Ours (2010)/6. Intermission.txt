Steady from the ground up
Take it down
Line 'em up so they can get knocked down
This room is up in smoke, I'm gonna fucking choke
Welcome to the jungle
The daily ritual has begun
Lets blow the roof off of this motherfucker and get loose
Bounce, til the break of dawn
We will be going strong
The wheel of death has come for everyone
This is a real song about our real lives so put your drinks up cause tonight were gonna party like its 1999
This party's done but the next one has just begun
Not drunk is he who from the floor can rise alone and still drink more
Blackout
This is the anthem of our new generation
So lets take it all down
This is our anthem, get down
Here's to you, here's to me
The best of friends well always be
But if we should disagree
To hell with you and here's to me
Take it down
Now were falling, the ground keeps calling
Set 'em up, knock 'em down
