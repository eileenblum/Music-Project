Face me and tell me that this was all for nothing
You took the one thing that I had in this world
It brings me to fall to my knees
I pray you dear God, tell everyone when Im gone, when I return the only ones who will die will be all
Destroy
So say goodnight to the bad guy
You all turned away
What you have done will be done on to you
In a moment youll all be dead
My only wish was to say goodbye
