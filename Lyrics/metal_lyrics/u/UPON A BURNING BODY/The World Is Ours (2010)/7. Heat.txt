It never stops
Were living in a world of hatred, everything that you have ever loved will suffer
Dear God if youre here listening, dont you fucking fail me now
Because its never too late to die
Dont waste my motherfucking time
Hatred, hatred kills the things you love to pass the time
The sick and weak are the ones who get left behind
Your only hope is certain death
Its gonna fucking kill us all
De-evolutionized and cursed
Were turning back, goddamn
Were becoming animals, killing instictively
Ive watched you fall aprt
Open your eyes
Enjoy the serenade cause it wont last forever, everything is so beautiful
Enjoy the serenade, it wont last forever
Everything is so beautiful
This ones out to all the shattered bruised and broken souls
Hold on tight cause theres no stops to where were going
Hold on tight, it never stops
Living in a world of hatred
Everything that you have ever loved will suffer
Dear God if youre here, dont you, dont you fucking fail me now
Whos ever fantasized to live forever
How could you be so blind?
The simple truth lies in us all
When will this all be over?
Withholding knowledge from the innocent to become immortal
Wheres your fucking heart?
Its gonna kill us all
