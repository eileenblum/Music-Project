When the dream is so far gone how hard will you push?
When theres no one to follow, how long til you fade away?
Will you stay?
I must stand alone, I can, I am dreams of the day to come
It never ends, theres no resignation
Would you sacrifice everything you know?
Just to stand alone, I can, I am
So when theres no one left to follow, how long until you fade, fade away
I choose to fight back, I choose to rise not fall
I choose to live not die and I know, I know that whats within me is also within you
When the dream is so far gone, how hard will you push?
When theres no one to follow, how long til you fade away?
And when it looks like theres no where else to go, there is
When it feels like youre all alone, youre not
If you dont wanna fail, you wont
If you wanna live, you will
This is the moment that separates you from everyone else
To everyone whos believed in us through the highs and so many lows, we did it and no one can ever take this away
I am supposed to be here
I was born to be here
I can, I am
