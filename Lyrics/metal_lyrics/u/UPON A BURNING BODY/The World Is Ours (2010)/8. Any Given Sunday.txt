Welcome to youre full of shit 101
This is a crash course for all the fortunate ones
Now there will be no searching for reason so kiss your ass goodbye
Step down, Im fucking sick of it all
We can fight our way out of the light, we can climb out of hell one inch at a time
This is your new resolution
A last chance to redeem your treason
You glory days die
This is reality but not the one you see
All the fake smiles hiding the truth inside you and all of your wretched ways
Now will pay the ultimate price
Scum of the earth
You will suffer eternal demise
Feel these words burn as they come one by one straight into your black heart
Someday a real way will come and wash the scum from the streets
Theres no handouts when your whole world is drowning in a river of greed
So how the fuck does it feel?
How does it feel to be cast out and all alone?
The more you take the less you give
Its all because in the end youre all the same
Wheres your fortune and fame?
Watch it fading away
Wheres your fortune and fame?
Its fading away
Scum of the earth, you will suffer eternal demise
To the highest mountain I will climb just to throw you off and say goodbye one last time
