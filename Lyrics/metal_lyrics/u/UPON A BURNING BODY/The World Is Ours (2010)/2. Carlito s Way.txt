Im hearing every word you say only Im not listening
I hope you regret this
Attack and destroy the line
Speak the words that you want me to remember and Ill take them to the death, to the death
This is a payment of society
If you promise theres no forgiving me
Just a precaution of security
I want it all, yeah
I must walk on the blood of all humanity
To mark the yard where hope drowned, this is the battleground, here we go
Now well set the tone
Youre becoming the sheep and were the cannibals
This is only a game
As you were bending the rules we built our foundation
You think youre big time?
Youre gonna fucking die big time
Now speak the words you want me to forget, to the death
Enjoy the company
I will show what it is to yearn
We'll shake the fucking ground
Lets burn this mother down
It shook before and well shake it again before were done
This is my payment to society if you promise there is no forgiving me
Attack, we will set the tone we will take it all back
Youre the sheep, were the cannibals
This is just a fucking epilogue
Well shake the fucking ground
