Ive been to hell and back again, waging wars with all who step before my eyes
Redemption is the sweetest taste that I have come to know in natures wrath
I will be there for the christening, and to satisfy your hunger for the reckoning
Youll acknowlegde all my power, reaping all your dealing while breaking every feeling
You must abandon everything, go
While revealing all your secrets to me
A righteous man before me stands a hero in these filthy lands
Start devouring, savages youre invited
No more can they be guarded
Through the fire, this is suffering in its entirety
Open up and wage the suffering
Turning rotting flesh to walls
You must block the sun from the chosen one
Kneel before your bastard son
I am the chosen one, to hell and back again
