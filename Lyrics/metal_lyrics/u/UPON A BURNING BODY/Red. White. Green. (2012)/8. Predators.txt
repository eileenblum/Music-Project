Pray for your soul

Understand the world waits for no man
In the end we are the forgotten
Just a drone dropped in hell
Searching for a way out
All alone in this wretched place you've only dreamt about
But nightmares are the least of your problems
Cause in this food chain you're at the bottom
Nightmares are the least of your problems
Nightmares are the least of your problems
Nightmares are the least of your problems
Cause in this food chain you're at the bottom

You are the problem, so pray for your soul
In the presence of guilt
You are nothing but the enemy
Pray for your soul
You'll never find redemption
You'll be nothing but a memory

Through the eyes of the heavens
By the hand of the sun
Cast into the shadows
The forgotten ones
We are the forgotten ones

Fear is reborn when they're all gunning for you
Now just how far will you go to survive?
Fear is reborn
It's not a fucking game
And you must become the hunter to stay alive

Pray for your soul

They told me life wasn't easy
But they didn't say it would be this hard
They told me life wasn't easy
But they didn't say it would leave these scars

Fear me! And I refuse to lose
And I refuse to fail
I have been to the bottom
And I have come back from hell
I have come back from hell

Through the eyes of the heavens
By the hand of the sun
Cast into the shadows
The forgotten ones
We are the forgotten ones

Through the eyes of the heavens
By the hand of the sun
Cast into the shadows
The forgotten ones
We are the forgotten ones

Just a drone dropped in hell
Though you can't comprehend
If this death will bring salvation from this rotting palace
Then in salvation losing faith will be your only challenge
And in the end you'll be nothing but a memory

Pray for your soul
In the presence of guilt
You are nothing but the enemy
Pray for your soul
You'll never find redemption
You'll be nothing but a memory

Through the eyes of the heavens
By the hand of the sun
Cast into the shadows
The forgotten ones
We are the forgotten ones

Through the eyes of the heavens
By the hand of the sun
Cast into the shadows
We are the forgotten ones
