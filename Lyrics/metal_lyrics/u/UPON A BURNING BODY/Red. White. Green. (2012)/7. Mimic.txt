Drowning in a feeling of regret
So face your conscience with a sense of guilt
And bet understanding of your imperfections

In a world you created your shame surrounds you
Now become a victim of the chains that bound you

No you were supposed to be there
Where were you?
You said you'd die to save me
I called for you
You were my only savior
With my last breath I'll scream
Where were you?

There's no hiding in the shadows of abomination
In god we trust
When we all turn to dust

You know what you have done
You fear what they've become
Realize that you are the reason
They are the enemy but who is the demon?

You are the demon
Awaken the forsaken
Breathing life into the horror
You won't be coming back

There's no remorse for you
I see the fear in your eyes
It will eat you alive

There's no remorse for you
Feasting freely all deceiving misconceptions
Of an altered solution

So face your conscience with a sense of guilt
And bet understanding of your indiscretions

In a world you created your shame surrounds you
Now become a victim of the chains that bound you

You are the demon
Awaken the forsaken
Breathing life into the horror
You won't be coming back

You know what you have done
You fear what they've become
Realize that you are the reason
They are the enemy but who is the demon?

You know what you have done
You fear what they've become
Realize that you are the reason
They are the enemy but who is the demon?

You are the demon

There's no remorse for you
I see the fear in your eyes
It will eat you alive

There's no remorse for you
I see the fear in your eyes
It will eat you alive
