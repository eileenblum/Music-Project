This is blood for blood
And by the gallons
These are the old days, the bad days
The all-or-nothing days - they're back
There's no choices left, and I'm ready for war
And I'm ready for war

We are back, back to shatter
Any stupid motherfucker that's thinking they can change the world
We've all been deemed the poison coursing through your veins
Re-constructing
Regret all that you believe
Destruction becomes all that we need
Just when you thought you had it figured out that's when
The wave of terror comes crashing down
And just when you think the pain is too much to take
You're way too fucking late

When your eyes go dead, the hell we send you to
Will seem like heaven instead

An eye for an eye
Fall to your knees
Motherfucker tell me how do you plead?

Guilty as charged

Just when you thought you had it figured out that's when
The wave of terror comes crashing down
And just when you think the pain is too much to take
You're way too fucking late

When your eyes go dead, the hell we send you to
Will seem like heaven instead

So when you're trapped in your own hell don't wonder why,
Because
Life sucks and then you die
So live it up, who gives a fuck? Let's tear it up tonight
