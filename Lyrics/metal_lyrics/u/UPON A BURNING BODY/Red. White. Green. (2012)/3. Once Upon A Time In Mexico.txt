With fire in your heartbeat and a chill within the words you speak 
Come one come all back to reality - trapped in an ocean of illusion with no notion, only confusion 
Within the shadow of the one who holds more than your thoughts, trust you won't see clearly 
Every minute you waste is a minute you've lost
And you will never get it back
In a world under glass
You can watch the time pass
As the earth becomes an echo Of what's left outside
But the wind can blow cold
In the depths of your soul
And no one will find you
In the place where you hide
You'll be branded, for the weak who follow your shame will lead your reign
and you'll be back to where you started
Within the shadow of the one who holds more than your thoughts, trust you won't see clearly
Bounce
Let go of the fear that you've guarded
Cuz when i look in your eyes i can see that
You lied and i knew it ever since we started

You deceive
I won't believe any word you say
I won't obey

In a world under glass You can watch the time pass
As the earth becomes an echo Of what's left outside
But the wind can blow cold
In the depths of your soul
And no one will find you
In the place where you hide
Let Go
let go of the fear that you've guarded
Cuz when i look in your eyes i can see that
You lied and i knew it ever since we started
