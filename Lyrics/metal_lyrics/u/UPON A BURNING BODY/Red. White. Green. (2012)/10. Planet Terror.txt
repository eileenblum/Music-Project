This is the end of everything
Death consumes all and walks on
This is the end of everything
Terror in your presence
Leaving your body with chill and no soul
As the darkness fills your eyes
And the essence of life begins to fade away
Renounce your place at life's throne
The undead now walk this Earth alone
No comfort your flesh as it rots in dismay
And the light in your eyes decay
What was once a treasured gem
You have no use for them
This is the end of everything
Death consumes all and walks on
This is the end of everything
Waves of the dead closing in
Now they surround you
They can smell your flesh
But why do they just walk around you?
The urge to feed is getting stronger
You can't resist the taste of blood any longer
How can you save your life when you realize you're dead inside?
Flat line
Through their infected hateful grin
They will tear you limb from limb
Flat line
Viral infections
They came pouring in
That boy's got the devil in him
There is no hope
They feel no pain
Shoot them now
Destroy the Brain
Now comfort your flesh as it rots in dismay
And the light in your eyes decay
What was once a treasured gem
You have no use for them
Are we worth saving when too hot
The eye of hell shines
Are we worth saving
Or should we all be left behind?
