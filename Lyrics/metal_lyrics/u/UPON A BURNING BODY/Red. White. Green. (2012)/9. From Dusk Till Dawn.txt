Blood will fill the oceans and turn the skies red as it crashes down
The end of life as you know it
Have you reached your point of absolution
Or in the end will you face your retribution?
Wake up - Hate [x4]
You are all just sheep in a crowded meadow
A fucking leach with no heart inconsequential
No one will be spared
So don't repent cuz you're fucking scared
Inhuman flesh shall now embrace the knife
Here is the peace in death I could not give you in life
Time is of the essence
To learn your lesson as it comes undone
The end of life as you know it
Have you reached your point of absolution
Or in the end will you face your retribution?
Come seize your punishment
It's payment for the life you lived
Come size your punishment
And depart with a stake through your heart
There's no forgiveness
You are all just sheep in a crowded meadow
A fucking leach with no heart inconsequential
No one will be spared
So don't repent because you're fucking scared
Here is the peace in death I could not give you in life
No remorse for the flesh
Here is the peace in death I couldn't give you in life
Blood will fill the oceans
