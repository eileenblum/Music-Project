I will never look back, I will never turn around
I will never look back, I will never turn around
Keep your friends close but keep your enemies even closer
Make them swallow their pride

They will never adore this moment
A loss of devotion leaves them empty and broken inside
Like gas to a flame igniting a fire that's inside me
Have I done all i can to ensure my light is blinding.

No longer living in the shadows of doubt
We are the fire that will never go out
In the eye of the storm lies the truth that i seek
In a world thats in darkness theres no place for the weak

Just close your eyes and scream with me
What we do in this life will echo in eternity
Tiptoe around the same path
I have walked it for the last time
Some people never need a reason to lie
All i needed i got when i last looked into your eyes

Like gas to a flame igniting a fire that's inside me
Have I done all i can to ensure my light is blinding.
I will never look back, I will never turn around
I will never look back, I will never turn around

Remember where you came from and where you've been
Remember everything that you stood for
And the promise you made to never let the fire go out

Just close your eyes and scream with me
What we do in this life will echo in eternity [fade out]
