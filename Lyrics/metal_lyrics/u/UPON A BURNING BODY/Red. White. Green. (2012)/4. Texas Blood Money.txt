The stars at night are big and bright deep in the heart of Texas.
Hell yeah!

If you cannot tell by the way I talk
Then you sure as hell better check by the way I walk.
A million miles tall and wide is just to scratch
The surface of our pride standing tall through it all.
The lone star shines and flies alone,
The only place that we call home.

Everything is bigger in Texas, loaded double barrel blow you to pieces.
Everything is bigger in Texas, loaded double barrel blow you to pieces.
Let us do a toast for our lone star state,
Put them up shotgun heavy drinking booze all day.
Everything is bigger in Texas, loaded double barrel blow you to pieces.
Everything is bigger in Texas, loaded double barrel blow you to pieces.
Ten steps closer to hell we stand this is our God-given promise land.
The stars at night are big and bright deep in the heart of Texas.
The stars at night are big and bright deep in the heart of Texas.
We respect the land that we come from, it's the place we call home.
We respect the ground that we walk on, it's the place we call home.
Don't fuck with Texas!

I am back motherfuckers this round to pour me a fucking Jagerbomb
Fuck that I got whiskey let us mix this shit from the east to the south.
Now my friends lay me down to sleep
A fifth of whiskey down by my feet
If I should die before I wake
Tell everyone that I drank it straight.

Just another night in the lone star state next round is on me
All the cowboys from hell drink for free.
Respect, walk respect the land that we come from,
Respect the ground that we walk on it is the place we call home!
So walk on home boy.
