to conform is to be destroyed.
From the top of a wasteland I bow to no man
so when the shadow of evil sets in you must pray for damnation
And I will watch you bow your head in shame
and I will set this world aflame.
For through the blood of the innocent I now know your name.

reap what you sew
I'll be the one in your front
and I'll bring the worst of intentions with me.
And I now I know you cant endure the pain anymore
the world has left you behind.
With the setting of the sun you shall follow the path of deception.
and the running through the streets of your sorrow will plant the seeds of infection.
your not a martyr
your just a follower

and to conform is to be destroyed.

bow your head in shame
and I will set this world a flame

For through the blood of the innocent I now know your name.
you need to use restraint
so tell me are you a martyr
I'll challenge every word of your faith
and watch your kingdom slip further and further and further away.

Your not a martyr
your just a follower

and to conform is to be destroyed
(hell bound)
I bow to no man
who the fuck you to say what's treason
(hell bound)
Conform to man
so fuck you what the fuck do you believe in now
I bow to no man
I bow to no man
So fuck you what the fuck do you believe in now
What the fuck do you believe in?
