[x2]
No more respect, no more power
The whole world is my enemy now
Get up, get up
The whole world is my enemy now
Fuck

Now what makes you think I ever cared?
Just what the fuck you thought about me?
It's not likely
I'm sick and tired of being ignored
Cut the shit, I've heard this before

I've got no time for an alliance
I'm saying "fuck you" out of kindness
You're spineless
And you're in trouble, seeing double
Falling to the floor, quit
You don't want a war, bitch

[x2]
If it's a war that you're looking for
Let me see you come and get it
This ain't the war that you're looking for
Motherfucker come and get it

No more respect, no more power
The whole world is my enemy now

I've got a license to hate
All the backstabbing cowards that stood in my way
And you fucked yourself when you left me for dead
And left the scars I can't get out of my head
[x2]
Get out of my head, fuck

Give me a reason not to smash you out
Shut your fucking mouth, this is my house
My rules, if you don't like it, fuck you
You're in trouble, seeing double
Falling to the floor, quit
You don't want a war, bitch

[x2]
If it's a war that you're looking for
Let me see you come and get it
This ain't the war that you're looking for
Motherfucker come and get it

No more respect, no more power
The whole world is my enemy now
No more respect, no more power
The whole world is my enemy now
No more respect, no more power
The whole world is my enemy now
No more respect, no more power
The whole world is my enemy now

The whole world is my enemy now
The whole world is my enemy now
