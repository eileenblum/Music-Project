Get the fuck up

Take a step to the edge
Left behind far from bliss
Heartless coward
Suicide is painless but you've never felt it anyway
Soulless bastard
Never trust a snake slither soul on fire
There is no place for you
So run away, fade away
Get the fuck away from me

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Everything burns, so why give a fuck?
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Everything burns, so why give a fuck?

Pledge your allegiance to our anthem

[x2]
Generation hate
Generation hate
Generation hate
Pledge your allegiance

Hear it, feel it
Need it, want it
It's like a drug but no one supplies it
Dissatisfaction's guaranteed
So you can hear it, feel it
Need it, want it
I am the drug you fucking fiend
Now beg now plead
Motherfucker on your knees

Heartless coward
Soulless bastard bow
Heartless coward
Soulless bastard
I'll bet you're sorry now
I'll bet you're sorry now

While we're speaking of cowards
I'll look straight through you, a.k.a fuck you
Where are my manners?
I don't have to hurt you
I'll just let you kill yourself

Never trust a snake slither soul on fire
There is no place for you
So run away, fade away
Get the fuck away from me

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Everything burns, so why give a fuck?
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Everything burns, so why give a fuck?

Pledge your allegiance to our anthem

[x2]
Generation hate
Generation hate
Generation hate
Pledge your allegiance

Hear it, feel it
Need it, want it
Hear it, feel it
Need it, want it
