I refuse to be the victim
I've been on trial all my life
I refuse to be the victim
This is the part where I pull out the knife
I've been on trial all my life
This is the part where I pull out the knife

The world "love" it has no meaning to me
Just an abandoned ship lost in a black sea
Hide my scars
Hide my bruises from fight after fight
Pages in time I wish I could rewrite

We have all been here before
To a place you hate, you hate to adore
We have all been here before
To a place you hate, you hate yourself for

[x2]
I'm not holding my breath
I'm tired of trying
I've got nowhere to rest in a world that's dying

[x2]
Cursed is the man who dies
But the evil done by him survives

Welcome to no man's land
In a time that feels like a world war
No intervention for a global meltdown
It's too late to help
I feel it's out of my hands now

We have all been here before
To a place you hate, you hate to adore
We have all been here before
To a place you hate, you hate yourself for

[x2]
I'm not holding my breath
I'm tired of trying
I've got nowhere to rest in a world that's dying

I don't believe in this world anymore

All rise:
In the case of Danny Leal against the World
The jury has reached a verdict
We find the defendants guilty on all charges

Judgment

I refuse to be the victim
This is the part where I pull out the knife
I've been on trial all my life
This is the part where I pull out the knife
