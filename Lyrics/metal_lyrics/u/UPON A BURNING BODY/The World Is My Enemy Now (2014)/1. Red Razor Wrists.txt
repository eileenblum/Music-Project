I'm not sorry for the way that I am
The price of power

When you've never had anything
How far would you go to have it all?
They told me I could have everything
But I never thought I'd have to take the fall

Oh so heavy lies the crown that you paid for
Greed is the priority, it's fucking killing me

Red Razor Wrists I don't know if I'll even make it to hell
Red Razor Wrists I don't know if I'll even make it to hell

It's like the harder I try the more I fail
I'M A GOD DAMN MONSTER

All my life searching for something
All my life it's left me with nothing now

Blood in my eyes
Blood on my hands
I can't see I can't feel anymore
Blood in my eyes
Blood on my hands
Oh so heavy lies the crown that you paid for

Go ahead and turn your back to me
Here's a big fuck you, the first one's free
On your knees or on the throne
In the end we all still die alone

Oh so heavy lies the crown that you paid for
Greed's the priority it's fucking killing me

It's like the harder I try the more I fail
I'M A GOD DAMN MONSTER

All my life searching for something
All my life it's left me with nothing now
Blood in my eyes
Blood on my hands
I can't see I can't feel anymore
Blood in my eyes
Blood on my hands
Oh so heavy lies the crown that you paid for

Blood in my eyes
Blood on my hands
Blood in my eyes
Blood on my hands

I'M A GOD DAMN MONSTER
