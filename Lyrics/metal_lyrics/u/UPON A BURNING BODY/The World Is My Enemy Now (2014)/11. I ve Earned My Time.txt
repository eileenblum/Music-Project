Yeah!

So say that I've changed
And call me a liar
It's funny what the fame can inspire
Shovel shit while they still say I didn't work for it
You haven't paid your dues
You couldn't stand in my shoes!

From the outside looking in
I remember where I came from and where I have been
So never again will I let you win
You don't know what I've been through
I earned my time alright!

We've earned our time!
I earned my time!

They said we fail no matter how hard we try
We kept coming!
We kept coming!
They said we wouldn't look the devil in his eyes!
We're not running!
We're not running!

From the outside looking in
I remember where I came from and where I have been
So never again will I let you win
You don't know what I've been through
I earned my time alright!

I'm on the outside (outside)
I'm on the outside looking in!
I'll never forget where I come from
And I'll never forget where I've been

I earned my time!
We earned our time!

From the outside looking in
I remember where I came from and where I have been
So never again will I let you win
You don't know what I've been through
I earned my time alright!

I'm on the outside (outside)
I'm on the outside looking in!
I'll never forget where I come from
And I'll never forget where I've been!

You haven't paid your dues!
You couldn't stand in my shoes!
You haven't paid your dues!
We earned our time!
