The guilt, the shame drives you insane
Here we go!

Burn it all, burn it all, burn it all.
Iâm not looking back,
Thereâs nothing to gain burning it all and ignoring the pain.
Tell me whatâs the reason
Give me something to believe in.

Stop. This isnât insecurity.
Stop. And I donât know what you want from me.
Stop. Forcing your standards upon me.
Stop. Because Iâm better than youâll ever be.

Iâll never. Iâll never re-live my past again.
So donât ever, donât ever come at me like that again.
Iâll never. Iâll never re-live my past again.
So donât ever, donât ever come at me like that again.

And the scars that light up the sky
Show the strength in me
Through the pain and the sacrifice
Thereâs still strength in me
To take away the sorrow.

The more lives I touch the less I feel
End it all, mother fucker
And seal the deal.
Iâm no stranger to the place where demons wait
They fill up my heart with hate so

Stop. This isnât insecurity.
Stop. And I donât know what you want from me.
Stop. Forcing your standards upon me.
Stop. Because Iâm better than youâll ever be.

Iâll never. Iâll never re-live my past again.
So donât ever, donât ever come at me like that again.
Iâll never. Iâll never re-live my past again.
So donât ever, donât ever come at me like that again.

Iâm a bad, bad man without a doubt
Iâll chew you up and spit you the fuck out.
Iâm calling you out
And now youâll see thereâs still strength in me.
Iâm calling you out
And now youâll see thereâs still strength in me.
And the scars that light up the sky
Show the strength in me
Through the pain and the sacrifice
Thereâs still strength in me
To take away the sorrow.
