You may not like me but you'll remember my name,
I've never known what it's like to have a home,
Love me or hate me, I still end up alone.
All my temper, all my doubt are eating my soul.
No need to re-live the past, my memories are torn,
But tonight, I am reborn.

One more coin in a fountain of wishes,
You try and try and try,
You're too addicted to resisting.
The bitterest truth is always better than the sweetest lies.
The bitterest truth is always better than the sweetest lies.

Are you gonna face me? Or are you gonna run?
I am everything you said I could never be.
What's the matter?
Don't you recognize me when I'm standing above you.

The bitterest truth is always better than the sweetest lies.
And there's no way to hide when I look in your eyes.
The bitterest truth is always better than the sweetest lies.
And there's no way to hide when I look in your eyes.

They poisoned the best of me
...When I look in your eyes
They poisoned the best of me
...When I look in your eyes
But now I feel nothing!

One more coin in the fountain of wishes,
One more coin in the fountain of wishes,
One more coin in the fountain of wishes,
One more coin in the fountain of wishes,
One more coin in the fountain of wishes,
One more coin in the fountain of wishes.
