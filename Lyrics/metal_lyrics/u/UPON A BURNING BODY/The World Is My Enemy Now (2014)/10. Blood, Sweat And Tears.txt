Every thought [?] is a battle.
Every breath is ignored
And I'm tired of excuses.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

Over and over and over again.
I've had enough. I've had enough.
This struggle has come to an end.
And I have no reason to make amends!

With blood, sweat, and tears.
I'm over it!
Used, abused, and held down by fear.
[2x]

In the shadow of a burning desire.
Can you stand alone in the fire?

If you're not with us, you're against us. No turning back! [2x]

We are the counter attack!
I refuse to fall!
We'll overtake it all!

Every thought is a battle.
Every breath is ignored.
And I'm tired of excuses.
You have been warned!
This is the point of no return.
I'm not going back.
I am the counter attack!

With blood, sweat, and tears.
I'm over it.
Used, abused, and held down by fears.

In the shadow of a burning desire, can you stand alone in the fire?

If you're not with us, you're against us. No turning back!
[2x]

We are the counter attack!

If you're not with us, you're against us. [2x]

1, 2, 3, 4!

We are the counter attack!
No turning back!

If you're not with us, you're against us. [2x]

No turning back! We are the counter attack!
