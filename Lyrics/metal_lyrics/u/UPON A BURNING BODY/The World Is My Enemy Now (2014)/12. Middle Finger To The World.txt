Middle finger to the world!
Oh, middle finger to the world!

All this time
Instead of living in a dream world, you said I wouldnât (no), I couldnât (no), I shouldnât (no)
Said I was left behind and need to stay alive, but Iâm not like you, Iâm one of a kind
I got a problem with authority so proving you wrong is a priority
You said I didnât have the voice but now Iâm making noise and with a rebel yell
We cry more, more, more

Donât look back anymore
The blessings of the retched heart like the penance from the bastard gods
Donât look back anymore
The blessings of the retched heart, never, never

I thought you werenât supposed to be the closest or the furthest from me
Iâm not a victim of jealousy and talking all that shit will get your head split, I donât give a fuck
I see what I want and I take it, youâre just a bitter pawn of my creation
Still think my singing is out of line, can you see this crowd, I think Iâm doing just fine

And with a smile on my face, I got a middle finger to the world
And another one just in case, move!

Middle finger to the world!
Oh, middle finger to the world!
Fight fire with fire where the odds are stacked
Fight fire with fire and donât look back

Donât look back anymore
The blessings of the retched heart like the penance from the bastard gods
Donât look back anymore
The blessings of the retched heart, never, never

Donât look back

I, I, I
I'll fight fire with fire with the odds all stacked (Iâll fight fire with fire, Iâll fight fire with fire)
What would you know about hurt, what would you know about death (Iâll fight fire with fire, Iâll fight fire with fire)
I'll fight fire with fire with the odds all stacked (Iâll fight fire with fire, Iâll fight fire with fire)

What would you know about hurt, what would you know about death (Iâll fight fire with fire, Iâll fight fire with fire)
(Iâll fight fire with fire, Iâll fight fire with fire)
(Iâll fight fire with fire, Iâll fight fire with fire)
(Iâll fight fire with fire, Iâll fight fire with fire)
(Iâll fight fire with fire, Iâll fight fire with fire)
(Iâll fight fire with fire, Iâll fight fire with fire)
