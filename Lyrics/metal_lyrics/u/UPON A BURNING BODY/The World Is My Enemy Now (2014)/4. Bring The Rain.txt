We are setting the fires
that light the way
and as the flames burn
they blind us from the pain
but this path leads only
to our darkest days
so give me something to believe in
and Iâll bring the rain

I donât need to escape from this maze
cause Iâm about to set it all a blaze
itâs time to face my fears
the past is gone Iâm still standing here!
Iâm still standing here!

Iâm looking for a match if you couldnât tell
I wonât shy away from RAISING HELL!

We are setting the fires
that light the way
and as the flames burn
they blind us from the pain
but this path leads only
to our darkest days
so give me something to believe in
and Iâll bring the rain

[2x]
Raise the flags, rev the engines, letâs find something to believe in

Raise the flags, rev the engines, we are something to believe in!
Raise the flags, rev the enginesâ¦â¦ THUNDER!

I believe!!!
Iâll bring the rain, you bring the thunder!

I believe
yeah you better believe!
Iâll bring the rain, you bring the thunder!

[2x]
Iâm still standing here!

We are setting the fires
that light the way
and as the flames burn
they blind us from the pain
but this path leads only
to our darkest days
so give me something to believe in
and Iâll bring the rain
