I'm tired of the same ol' bullshit
Tired of the liars, the cheats, and all you hypocrites
I'm just trying to live my life
Squeeze a dollar out of a dime just to survive
I'm not looking for sympathy but right now you don't want to fuck with me
You can't take what you haven't earned
You keep playing with fire you're bound to get burned
Ah shit â here we go again
Work all day ain't got no time to play
It's the same shit just a different day
Ah shit â here we go again
I'm living my life the best I can
You want a fucking role model, but I'm just a man
The pressure is killing me
The weight of world is on my shoulders
I'm not the person you think I am
You've turned me into a monster
I'm tired of the same ol' bullshit
D.T.A. motherfucker
Don't trust anyone
It's dog eat dog in the big world
So don't start shit, there won't be shit
Ain't got the time for piece of mind
When everyone's trying to get a piece of mine
You can't take what you haven't earned
You keep playing with fire you're bound to get burned
Ah shit â here we go again
Work all day ain't got no time to play
It's the same shit just a different day
Ah shit â here we go again
I'm living my life the best I can
You want a fucking role model, but I'm just a man
The pressure is killing me
The weight of world is on my shoulders
I'm not the person you think I am
You've turned me into a monster
Don't waste my time with your same ol' bullshit
Fuck
Ah shit â here we go again
I'm living my life the best I can
You want a fucking role model, but I'm just a man
The pressure is killing me
The weight of world is on my shoulders
I'm not the person you think I am
You've turned me into a monster
Don't waste my time with your same ol' bullshit
