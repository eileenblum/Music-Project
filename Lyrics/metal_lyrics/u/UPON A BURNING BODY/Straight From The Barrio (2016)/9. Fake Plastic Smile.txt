We bow down to no one
You walk around with your head in the clouds
Thinking this life is your life like you should be proud
We live every day getting beaten down but stand tall
Push it back â push it back we're about to attack
Flaunting this and that better watch your back
Because I'm calling you out for everything that you lack
Rich boy, bitch boy thinking you're the shit boy
Motherfucker you don't deserve that new whip
You didn't pay for it
Them fly clothes
You didn't buy that shit
Rollie on your wrist
You little spoiled ass bitch
You think you're rich boy?
You're just a bitch boy
You walk around with your head in the clouds
Thinking this life is your life like you should be proud
You can't keep playing pretend
You had a good run on that high horse â it's time you comprehend
I'm calling you out and I hope it stings
Trust me I'm not trying to teach you anything
I see through your fake plastic smile
All the money in the world can't make you happy
All the money in the world couldn't make me like you
You think you can live like this for the rest of your life 
Where will you turn when your daddy's money runs out? 
You never worked a fucking day in your life
I don't even expect you to know how to fight
Rich boy, bitch boy you don't know shit boy
Motherfucker you don't deserve that new whip
You didn't pay for it
Them fly clothes
You didn't buy that shit
Rollie on your wrist
You little spoiled ass bitch
You think you're rich boy?
You're just a bitch boy
You walk around with your head in the clouds
Thinking this life is your life like you should be proud
You can't keep playing pretend
You had a good run on that high horse; it's time you comprehend
I'm calling you out and I hope it stings
Trust me I'm not trying to teach you anything
Born with a silver spoon in your mouth
'Bout time some one put you in your place
Bitch
