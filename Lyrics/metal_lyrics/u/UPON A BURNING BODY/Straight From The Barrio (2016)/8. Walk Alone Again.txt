I can't escape
My past is going to haunt me forever
The darkness tries to taunt me
Give in
Just a taste of what you desire
Get out of my head you fucking liar
Everywhere I look there's a constant reminder
My demon's coming here to take me under
I won't go down without putting up a fight
I'll be bruised and bleeding before I let you take my life
I am the one who will claw my way out
You can push and pull but you won't drag me down
I am the one to walk alone again
You can beg and plead but you're dead to me
Let go of me
Your grip is failing to hold me down now
I'll walk out lock the door and throw the key away
You can have my past, that's all you are to me
You can have my past, trapped with all that misery
That's not me anymore
I've come too far to fail
Knife to the throat of me giving in
I can see the eyes bearing from the fire inside
All of my demons try to drag me down to hell
I am the master of my own way out
I am the one who will claw my way out
You can push and pull but you won't drag me down
I am the one to walk alone again
You can beg and plead but you're dead to me
No
You're not welcome in my head
Your condescending words about who I am
No
You're not welcome anymore
