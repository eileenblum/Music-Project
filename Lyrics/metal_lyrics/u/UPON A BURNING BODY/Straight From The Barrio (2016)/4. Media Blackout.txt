You got a problem with me?
Come say that shit to my face
Hate me
'Cause I know you love it
Love me
When I know you hate it
You fake piece of shit, you're waiting for me to fall
but I'm at the top sipping my alcohol
Why you always got to be fucking with me
I know you would love to break me
Media's always trying to blame me
With one hand holding my dick I say...
Fuck you if you don't like it
Let me see a show of hands if you're perfect
...That's what I thought
But you're so quick to judge me
You want my spotlight but you don't deserve it
Just like the rest you can't take it but you will serve it
I know you would love to break me
Media's always trying to blame me
With one hand holding my dick I say...
Fuck you if you don't like it
Shit-talked by many
Hated by some
Guess how many fucks I give?
3?
2?
None
Keep talking shit about me
I know you would love to break me
Media's always trying to blame me
With one hand holding my dick I say...
Fuck you if you don't like it
