Lay me down to sleep tonight
Pray that I wake up this time
'Cause I've been living my whole life one bottle at a time
I don't need you in my skin
Just to feel alive again
I'm awake for the first time
You can't change what's in my mind
I'm awake maybe this time I will leave the pain behind
I can feel them trying to wake me
I can feel you trying to break me
I don't need you in my head
I'd rather feel alive instead
I don't need you in my skin just to feel alive
I'm awake for the first time
You can't change what's in my mind
I'm awake maybe this time I will leave the pain behind
I'm no longer dead inside
I gave in too many times
I'm no longer dead inside
I'm coming alive
I'm awake for the first time
You can't change what's in my mind
I'm awake maybe this time I will leave the pain behind
I don't need you in my skin just to feel alive
