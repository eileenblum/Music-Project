You can't break me 'cause I'm already broken [2x]
I'm already broken inside

I've seen so many bad things
I will never be the same
Shaken to many times it's hard to explain the pain
But I've grown and developed a sense of sight
One that leads me to believe things can be alright
No me puedes quebrar porque estoy quebrado

You can't break me 'cause I'm already broken
Ya no me puedes quebrar
You can't break me 'cause I'm already broken
Poque estoy quebrado

This moment marks the day I believe in me
One a hollow shell now radiates infinity
I will become a new kind of entity one that will be heared now and through centuries

You can't break me 'cause I'm already broken
Ya no me puedes quebrar
You can't break me 'cause I'm already broken
Poque estoy quebrado

No more being played like this
I'm done â I'm numb from all the pain
No more
I didn't ask for this
I'm done
I'm moving on

You can't break me 'cause I'm already broken [2x]
I'm already broken
You can't break me 'cause I'm already broken
Ya no me puedes quebrar
You can't break me 'cause I'm already broken
Poque estoy quebrado
