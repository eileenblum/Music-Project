Motherfucker, you don't own me

You can't please everyone, so listen up and understand
I make music for me and for the people who love it
I don't need permission from you and I damn sure ain't your fucking puppet
All I hear is walk this way and talk this way do it just how I say
I won't be criticized for the man I am
A word of advice: Start your own band

I say what I mean and I mean what I say
Like the words of a king
From the bottom on the grind to the top
You think I'm sorry I'm not
I say what I mean and I mean what I say
Like the words of a king
From the bottom on the grind to the top
So if you're with me I'll give you all I've got

Oh yeah, I see you looking at me and I can see your mouth moving
But I'm not listening
You ain't got nothing better to do than talk shit about
Who's who from what you've seen on YouTube 
All the shit it took for me to get here
You couldn't hang with me if you wanted to
I won't be criticized for the man I am
A word of advice: Start your won band

I'mma do what I want and I'll do it the way I want
I'mma sing what I want and I'll sing it the way I want
I'mma do what I want and I'll do it the way I want
I don't need permission from you
Who the fuck do you think you are

I say what I mean and I mean what I say
Like the words of a king
From the bottom on the grind to the top
You think I'm sorry I'm not
I say what I mean and I mean what I say
Like the words of a king
So true fans put your hands up stand up and scream it with me

Motherfucker, you don't own me and I don't owe you a goddamn thing

I say what I mean and I mean what I say
Like the words of a king
From the bottom on the grind to the top
You think I'm sorry I'm not
I say what I mean and I mean what I say
Like the words of a king
From the bottom on the grind to the top
So if you're with me I'll give you all I've got
