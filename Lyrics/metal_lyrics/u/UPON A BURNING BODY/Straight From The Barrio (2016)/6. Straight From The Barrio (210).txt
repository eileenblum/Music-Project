Now for those of you who don't know
You got two choices: Either get up, or get the fuck out
Here we come
Motherfuckers back at it again
We're back in town
Feel the heat
The new black is brown
Come get that good shit, that hood shit
That straight from Texas music and before we're done
We're going to own this town
San Antonio, we're about to explode
Straight from the barrio
We're out of control
The party don't start we kick in
All you fake motherfuckers you out we in
From the bottom of the barrel to the top of the world
This is still who I am
From the river city to the ocean shores
I won't forget you
Get up
Born and raised in that dirty, dirty, dirty south
I walk the walk, kid â you just run your mouth
If you respect me I'll respect you that's without a doubt
But if you don't like my city you can get the fuck out
Light it up, burn it down, feel the heat, we own this town
From the bottom of the barrel to the top of the world
This is still who I am
From the river city to the ocean shores
I won't forget you
From down in the gutter when all we had was each other
This is still who I am
You believed in me when this was only a dream and I won't forget you
San Antonio, we're about to explode
Straight from the barrio
We are the 210 â San Antonio
We rep that 210 and we're outta control
Ain't nobody going to represent the city like we do
You bleed for me and I'll bleed for you too
Ain't nobody putting S.A. on the map like we do
You bleed for me and I'll bleed for you too
I'm on top of the world
And this is still who I am
From the river city to the ocean shores
I won't forget you
From down in the gutter when all we had was each other
This is still who I am
You believed in me when this was only a dream
And I won't forget you
Get up
