See me staring back in the mirror
You don't have to try so hard
Suddenly life is much clearer
You don't have to change a thing

I'm not perfect and that's okay with me
I'm not perfect and that's okay

And I don't care what they think of me
Cause I'm not ashamed
Of the person I am today
I want you to see the happiest that I'll ever be
Is just being myself

Because I'm not perfect and that's okay with me
I'm not perfect and that's okay (And that's okay)

Over and over, I pay the cost of playing this game
What can I do to escape?
I will never be the man I want to be
If I can't learn from my mistakes

I'm not perfect and that's okay with me
I'm not perfect and that's okay (And that's okay)
I'm not perfect and that's okay (I'm not perfect!)
I'm not perfect and that's okay (I'm not perfect!)
