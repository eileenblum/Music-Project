Stop letting critics be your rudder and make your own way
No matter what you achieve they try to take it away
Go
This one's for the black sheep, the bullied, the ones like me
To the divergent, the outcast
I want you to scream with me
We won't listen to the pointless words you say
About how we aren't the same
We are the ones who will change the world today
Tirelessly, we break society's chains that bind us to hate
The pain and sorrow wilt away and from it blooms a brand new day
Free â I can feel the sun looking down on me
Feeling like no one ever gave you a chance
They judge too fast
Brand you the outcast
I used to be just like you
Hated the thought of getting bullied at school
Insecure about the color of my skin
So sad I just wanted to fit in
Terrified of going home most nights
A broken home, this can't be right
The pain and sorrow wilt away
And from it blooms a brand new day
Free I can feel the sun looking down on me
Remember it's never too late to believe in yourself
Rules are made to be broken
Doors can be slammed shut
But they can also be opened
Inspire someone
Walk through the fire for someone
Rebuild the good we have lost
With the odds against us
Push through at any cost
The pain and sorrow wilt away
And from it blooms a brand new day
Free I can feel the sun looking down on me
Inspire someone
Walk through the fire for someone
Rebuild the good we have lost
Push through at any cost
