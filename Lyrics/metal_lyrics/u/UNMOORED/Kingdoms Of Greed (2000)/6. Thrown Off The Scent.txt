[1.]
Never thought you would realize
It has been this way all through
Affected &amp; indifferent
You broke belief in two

[Chorus:]
Cause of disruption
Extravagant mistrust
Absorbing sufficiency
Through self-destruction

[2.]
Always knew what you now know
Apathetic termination
You had it coming to you
Premature extermination

[Repeat Chorus]

Thrown off the scent

[Repeat 1.]
[Repeat Chorus]
