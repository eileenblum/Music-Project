[1.]
I am inside you all
In the interior of your minds
Underrated &amp; given over by some
Devotion of a different kind
I possess an excessive hunger
Often refered to as greed
Corroder of your natural impulse
I am your darkest need

[Chorus:]
This world is my creation
My universal design
Set to outlive duration
Continuance will come to be mine

[2.]
Losing touch with reality
Entering a self-seeking dream
Give me an inch &amp; I will take a mile
Let me show you the unseen

[3.]
I invented this game
You play your parts so well
Possessed, yet not knowing
You slave inside my shell
Striving to satisfy me
When causing global hell
To feed my magnitude
What I want is what you give
All I need is what I made you
Just obey me and youâll live
You canât run, I will go on
After youâve died!

[Repeat 1.]
[Repeat chorus]
