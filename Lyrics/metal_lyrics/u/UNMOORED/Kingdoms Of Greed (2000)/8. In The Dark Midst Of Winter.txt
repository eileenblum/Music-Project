Autumnâs dawn, a seasonâs sigh
Like always when the summers die
Rainy days did come to stay
&amp; had the unfading washed away

Winterâs dawn, a seasonâs sigh
Like always when the autumns die
Silvery days did come to stay
&amp; had the undying washed away

Spring-tideâs dawn, a seasonâs sigh
Like always when the winters die
Fluent days did come to stay
&amp; had the enduring washed away
