[1.]
Your final departure
&amp; still youâre so strong
Rejecting the only thing
That would keep you from end up gone
Oh God, this cannot come to pass
Not now, not this way!
How I wish I could keep you from sliding
Into decay

[Chorus:]
&amp; so you bid us farewell
Setting along with the sun
Crowned with the courage of despair
Leaving creation behind
Your will is drawn to a close
&amp; so is your self-reliance
For that, youâre taking your leave
Rising above defiance

[2.]
Iâve tried putting myself in your place
Iâve tried to imagine what it must be like
But all that it comes to is nothing but fear
Fear of hat Iâd have to fight

[3.]
With a look full of pity
I sense your dismay
How I wish I could keep you from sliding
Into decay

[Repeat Chorus]
[Repeat 1.]

[4.]
The thought of never seeing you
Again is scaring me
Why does it have to end like this?
I will preserve the memory of you eternally
In my mind you will exist â forever!
