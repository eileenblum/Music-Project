Misery â despair
Useless empty pages
The future is now routine
Through endless ages

[Chorus:]
For what itâs worth
Yet itâs not too late
Just donât give in
Chances lie in wait
Whatâs yet to be
Yesterdays may drown
But still thereâs long
Before the sun is down

Bitterness â defeat
The dying life portrays
Entrance of denial
Indifference to faith

[Repeat chorus]

Misery â despair
The dying life portrays
The future is now routine
Indifference to faith

[Repeat chorus]
