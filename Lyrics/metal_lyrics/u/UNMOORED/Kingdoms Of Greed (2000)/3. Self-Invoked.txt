[1.]
Waiting for you
To help me find âmyâ way
I need direction to lead
To carry the day

[2.]
Make-believer â you cannot keep this
Smokescreen from dissolving
Some sunny day you will become aware
Of what youâve done
Self-deceiver â youâre blocking up your
Own evolving, why else would you be losing
Every time you think you have won!

[Chorus:]
Self-invoked

[3.]
Preying upon you
I am the vulture you feed
Collector of impressions
The harvest of your seed

[Repeat 2.]
[Repeat chorus]

[4.]
Following in your steps
Always close behind
With eyes shut wide open
Sighted yet blind

[Repeat 2.]
[Repeat chorus]
