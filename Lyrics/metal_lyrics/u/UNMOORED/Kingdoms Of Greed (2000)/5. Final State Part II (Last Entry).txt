[1.]
I cannot seem to overlook you
Iâve tried for years now
But you just keep coming back
I put my trust in your reality
Still you had to overeach me this way

[2.]
What comes hereafter
I donât know
So cold as things go

[Chorus:]
Time &amp; again you fullfilled me
What am I to do without you here
Even though I donât want you around me
How can I go on when youâre not near

[3.]
For long Iâve tried to break away
I may be craving
But I wonât be slipping back
At every turn I ruminate on you
There is no switch off
I just have to submit

[Repeat 2.]
[Repeat Chorus]

My â life â is â yours!

[Repeat Chorus]
