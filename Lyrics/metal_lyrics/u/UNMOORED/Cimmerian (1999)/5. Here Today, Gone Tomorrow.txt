They were all a part of my great masterplan
Characters inside my head unable to take a stand
I did them a good turn, for all I care
Although I may have left their loved ones in despair

It's all the same to me now
It doesn't really matter what will come
I might as well just close my eyes
And face what I have done

Don't know where it started, don't know where it ends
The more I try to see things clearly, the less it all
Makes sense
They've put me off my stride but still I struggle
For all involved is the grief that's shared a grief
Made double

Clenched fists and immense convulsion
Once the curtain falls
Then silence spreads across the room
Set to take its course
Day of retribution, at last the clouds disperse
Remember what they say
Who evil does, he evil fares!
