Act of warfare; the ultimate strategy
Belligerent dark projection
Sowing the seeds of insanity
Genocide - disclosure
Deflower this world at any cost
the candle's burning at both ends
What is forever has already been lost

Cannot keep this world from dying
There is no point in even trying...

Put them out - for all time
Yet it's not too late
Masterminds or simply madmen?
Inventors that discreate!

...So (just) let the bombshells rain
Yeah, let them fuckers rain
