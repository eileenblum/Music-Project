Bastard-fuck, you feeble low-life
What the hell are you trying to pull?
Master of the prodigal disaster
In for a penny, in for a pound
Can't you see it's bringing you down
Stabbing you like a dagger in the back
Misanthropical apathy
Oh yeah, it's gonna get you boy

Why do I feel so alone
When I know you're always by my side
Please say that you're my friend
At least let me keep my pride

Self-inflicted "24 H" living hell
Seven night suicide come-down
"Pals for life," concluded contract with the Devil
But will you endure the performance to the bitter end?
Gone too far, not being able to return
Gravestate injuries rotting you whole
100% consumption of requirements
Smothered in blood by tragedy

Lifeless I am running
Without any real goals
For rainy days of dying
A dried-out source set course

Terminal-vein art life-eating injection
Mental murder in the first degree
Self-destruction now has access to your mind
Your world's a disease no man can ever cure
Another grave unflowered, another grave disowned
Bloodsuckers dancing upon where you belong
Roots never meant to be cut are grown back together
Crimson is their colour - blood by tragedy
