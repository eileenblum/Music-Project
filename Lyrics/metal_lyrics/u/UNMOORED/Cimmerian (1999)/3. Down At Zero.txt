Cannot shuffle off this self-destruction
Eating my long-sufferance away
Crawling in the ashes of submission
Knee-deep in substantial decay

Life's like ice that holds, but still won't carry
Destined, swallowing the bitter pill
Sadly it's always the same old story
No use sowing what you cannot till

I've tried so hard to get by on my own to find a way
But every time I end up clutching at straws
What can I say?
I guess I just have to submit to my fate as things go
There is no point in indulging in hope when you're
Down at zero

Off the beaten track the entries narrow
Making it much harder not to fail
May be that, but life only lies fallow
Weighing anchor, ready to set sail
