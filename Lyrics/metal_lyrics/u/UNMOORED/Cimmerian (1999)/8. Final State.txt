Slipping away, out of the sight
Well, be that as it may
A tragical turn, setting it right
Just leaves it all to burn
Will not last, won't let alone
How could this come to pass
Time and again, what has been sown, now ends

Cannot change the way things are
Even if I wanted to
I don't know which way to turn
As well as what to do
After all is said and done
What will be, guess time will tell
Don't know if I can fall any further
Perhaps it's just as well
Now that I've sunk this deep

Once it's gone, out of the way
The race against time is on
Send it all forth, carry the day
Just let things take their course
Put under pledge, can't make known
The thin end of the wedge
As sure as fate, these seeds have been sown too late

I never thought that I would be the one down on my 
Knees for you
But sometimes things don't turn out quite the way you
Want them to
