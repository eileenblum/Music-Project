What makes you think you're so fucking special?
You trademark-wearing parasite superbitch
When your so called standards are merely fake, yeah!
You identity-seeking bloodsucking witch

With twisted perspectives for guidance you search
Can't you see something's wrong with this picture?
Problem is youâre too drunk with the urge
Your need of being somebody fictitious

Trendmade bitch - rip-off whore
You make me wanna fucking puke
Trendmade niche - fashion war
You motherfucking copying crook

Just by looking at you I know your type
You're a "want me to spread my legs" bitch
I've seen you before 'cause you keep coming back
Just why won't you keep off my pitch?

Trendbrainwashed bitch!
