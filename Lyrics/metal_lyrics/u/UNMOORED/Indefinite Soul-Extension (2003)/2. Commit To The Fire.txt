deathlike rebirth 
another passage being razed 
symptomatical third-degree burns 
inmost nature set ablaze

[Chorus]
commit to the fire - submit to desire

degeneration of an everlasting 
struggle within 
aftermath of vast proportions 
ending all therein 
enigmatic regeneration 
avalanche-like 
structural mutations 
by cycles of uncertanity 
pulling the wires
and taking its breath away 
burnt between two fires

last resort
without a parallell
tranformation of fear
accidental occurance
or just frality?
buried-to-be
won't last another day
expiring at dusk
leaving an existence void behind

not ever rising
never going down
insistent delusion

not ever darksome
never full of light
persistent illusion

not ever falling
never holding out
existent delusion

not ever intact
never left undone
resistant illusion

breathing its last
embers of dispiritment
an amaranth in the ashes
yet a turn has come to pass
