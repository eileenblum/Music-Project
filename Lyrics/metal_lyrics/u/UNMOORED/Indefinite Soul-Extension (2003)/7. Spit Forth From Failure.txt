torn out pages
inked with greif
from a blackend chapter
of disbelief
a new beginning
taking rise
spit forth from failure
descendant of demise

fragments
of what used to be
now riding on a dying wind
vanquished and forsaken
in the twilight set aside
stillborn dreams
no longer
in the process
of beheading hope
turning frality inside out
the vital force resumed
