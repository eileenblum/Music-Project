freed from impurity
washed away
is the fall of innernight
the veil once drawn over
this festering void
no longer needed
in order to preserve

shadows close
gasping for breath
there's a new era dawning
beginning today

[Chorus]
the sands of yesterday
beyond repair
empty of guidence
past time
to lay in the grave
empty of lead
never again
reduced to nothing
empty of aidance
recollections dressed in black

the future is taking heed

phase of revulsion [x4]

dark are the lights
burning out

ceasing to be 
end of the weight
putting off reality
turned into ash
is the sun
cremating
strength
source of belief
setting in
rising at length
