in the depths of duration
far away from a close
the extension of yet another
ending shows
loss of time by the hour
seasons scattered to the winds
from the dying of tomorrow
wearing thin

[Chorus]
never to return
whait is said to be
will not come to pass
tides no longer turn
what is yet to be
will not last

changes of little moment
for the better or the worse?
into what is of no more,
in reverse
on the verge of existence
one more rise falling through
where the bloom of ever-enduring
now once grew
