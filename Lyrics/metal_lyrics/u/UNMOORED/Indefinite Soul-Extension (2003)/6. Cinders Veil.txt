ethereal stronghold
metempsychosis nocturne
labyrinthian transition
the spirit shifting shape
resurrectional final event

subconcious denial
in contradiction with the soul
at birth dying
inmical days to be seen no more

[Chorus]
closing in upon
another coming into life
undergoing change
the now passing left behind
presentness all gone
a second entry making strife
here and out of range
the intermediate stage defined

"if no-one turned around when we entered, answered when we spoke, or minded what we did, and if every person we met "cut us dead", and acted as if we were non-existing things, a kind of rage and impotent despair would ere long well up in us, tortures would be a relief; for these would make us feel, however bad might be our plight, we had not sunk to such depth as to be unworthy of attention at all" [William James 1890]

easily broken
this tower of drastic turns
re-established mortar
cardinal collapse
resurrectional final event
