strong resemblance
premotion
destructive final turn
days gone by
consigned to oblivion
now once again in bloom

the no longer existing
has been brought back to life
primordial confusion
struck just to be lost anew

lasting contortions
abiding discord
in the depths of reanimation
seeking release

undecided
subsistance
in quest of constancy
nature of a delicate structure
a broken reed
dark affinity - misgiving
a dire lash of wind
pointing out the close at hand
the calm before the storm

falling through 
overthrown
fearful calling to mind
at first site
biding time
lying in wait for the eclipse
of what can't be set right

the mist is slowly lifting
exposing newborn sprouts
remains of failure
standing out
