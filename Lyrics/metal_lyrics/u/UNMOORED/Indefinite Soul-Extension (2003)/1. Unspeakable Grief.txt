eyereflector
throwing back a symbol 
of dark transparency
and shadows rendered pale
strangulated microcosm
cracked mirror of the soul
spirit changed beyond recognition 
tarnished and frail

[Chorus]
wakefulness or an allusive dream?
seeking shelter in a maze
bearing witness to the unforeseen
vanishing without a trace

returning to the end
of all that will not mend
a thousand griefs transcend
recover and extend
