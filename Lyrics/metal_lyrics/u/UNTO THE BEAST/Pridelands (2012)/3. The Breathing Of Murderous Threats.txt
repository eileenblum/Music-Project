(Saul saul why are you persecuting me?)

My tongue is stained with red from the blood of a thousand dead in Christ.
My eyes are void of sight with the dark of night from a blinding light
My sins have fled from death by the wrath of God I have been redeemed
My life's been cleansed by blood from the wounds of christ death has met its end

SAUL!

Everyday I swallowed the words that poured fourth from your mouth with the
breathing of murderous threats I am he who's name you've shamed
My God My God my hands have fought you slandering your name for sake of
gaining my own prideful praise
Saul you are my chosen son whom I've redeemed and vouched to free the
death that's chained you to the pits my cross is all you see that fits
My God My God my hands are reaching and though I am blinded my eyes shed
their scales and I am made victorious

Is this not the man who slaughtered and killed our kin for sake of himself
Speak the name of Christ for you will live forevermore in the throne of kings
I know that you watch the gates all the day and night plotting to silence
the flames on my tongue

I am not worthy of the fear that you all bestowed upon me
I feel blinded am I to be All that you have spoke to me

Arise my chosen one
Arise my instrument

I have risen to the cross and I will speak the name of Christ
I will speak the name of Christ
I have risen to the cross and I will speak the name of Christ

Paul, you've been made new
Paul, you've been made new
Hear me you meager souls
All have been made new

Cast aside the old man and put on the new
