I don't even know your names
and I don't care you're all the same
and I feel so inclined to state
that I'm the type of person you all should
HATE!
HATE!
FEAR!
You all should hate me
YOU ALL SHOULD HATE ME!

I am the type of man you should try and keep your
children far away from but I'm here to stand
in front of you and proclaim the life that Christ
has changed in me.

Hear me now my cry for thee is to be free from tyranny
My wrath it haunts me through the darkest of the night.

Even though spirit and flesh rage inside. My tongue
will always struggle to abide I hide not myself from the
face of the sun and boast only in the God that I love.

You hide yourself from on looking eyes and paint
on a face with church pews and tithes.
Religion means nothing when rotted inside
and though you smile and shout out your prayers
the most evil I've seen is in your private affairs
And when that mocking bird don't sing
You'll cry cuz daddy didn't buy you a ring.

Deep in my heart darkness resides in me
Fear me
Deep in my heart these chains they set me free
Fear me

I am murder I am sin
I am hatred I am Strife
I'm the fingers that grasp to the knife
I'm the gnashing of teeth in the night
I am murder I am sin

I can only boast of my God
for I have illustrated death
now I'm obliged to do what's right
for Lions lay with Lambs tonight.
Judge me not for I know I've sinned
but Christ has brought me hope again

all streams run into the sea but the sea
remains unfilled
what has been does is what will be done
there's nothing new under the sun
Of sinners I know, I am chief
I boast not myself, I boast only grief.
