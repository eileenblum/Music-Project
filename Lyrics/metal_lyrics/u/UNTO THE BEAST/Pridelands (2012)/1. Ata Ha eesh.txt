[Ring! Ring!]

[Guy:] Hello. Hello?

[Friend:] I don't think there's anyone there dude Just hang up.

[On The Phone:]
This is the Lord your God. The Father of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob.He who delivered the Israelites form oppression in Egypt. Hear Me.
You have reacted to My convictions with anger and hastily with violence.
For far too long you have denied My passage into your life. The scrapes
have become festering wounds, you've become bitter and selfish, exact
things spoken against. The time has come for you to return to your
prideland. For the burden you carry is not yours, but mine to bare.
