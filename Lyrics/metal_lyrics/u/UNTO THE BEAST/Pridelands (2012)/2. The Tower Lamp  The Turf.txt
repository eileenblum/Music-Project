Wake up! Wake up! children! Wake up!

You cattle get your heads off the ground 

Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

Take your head from the trough, and listen to me I will tell you a story,
life is much more than devouring the chaf of another mans glory

Everything that youve known has already been known you see with your eyes
only, how can you know the truth when your on the turf with no visibility 

Take the scales from our eyes, on the tower we rise, the sea brings forth
the beast, how can you see whats is true with no perspective!!

Wake! wake! Wake up! Wake up!

Open your eyes
