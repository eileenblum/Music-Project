Blind to deceit - By our fears - To a kingdom of false pretence
Selfish hands- Fallacies - Never ending
Dominate - The fix is in
A crusade not meant to win
Historize and plagiarize to seize control

Control-Control

Believe my every word
Believe and I will protect you
Don't criticize
Bow down you might meet your maker
I will dedicate my soul - Dedicate my life for you
Bow down you might meet your maker

Eyes in the sky - Tyranny
A fascist stranglehold - Never ending
Submission - A punished age
Accept all though end of days
Hail the shrine - All hail the shrine to seize control

All Hail the shrine
All hail the shrine to seize control

Believe my every word
Believe and I will protect you
Don't criticize
Bow down you might meet your maker
I will dedicate my soul - Dedicate my life for you
Bow down you might meet your maker

A house of judgement so divine that we burn our brothers
