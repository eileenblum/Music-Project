Take us back - reawake.
Take us back - erases the wrongs that plague us.
Reawake - rewrite the page that changed me
Take us back - to the times of cherished past.
Reawake - allow us to find the way.
Endured a lifetime of cold frustration.
Now lick the wounds and fight another day.
Your hands will reach.
The walls are coming down.
Stand up against the rage.
The walls are coming down.
So it goes.
Hypnotize.
So it goes.
The blood pours from your heart.
Hypnotize - allow us to find the way.
Man down look around.
Seven riffles to the sky.
Lock and load, lock and load.
Gung ho, Gung ho.
Afraid of the rage you feel from a bullet named life.
And a gun called pride, aim - fire.
We fight to live or live to die.
We all fight the same old wars.
Will you fight to live or will you live to die.
So it goes.
Stand up to find the way.
