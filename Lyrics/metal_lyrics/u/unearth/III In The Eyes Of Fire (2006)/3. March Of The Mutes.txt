How an we close our eyes when the walls around us wear thinner each day.
How can we mute our voices when a parade of chaos marches throughout the land.
This is the end, end of all.
We've been down this road before, yet we all just stand and watch.
Everlasting ignorance hes led our ways.
Forewarned, but still forgotten - our history erased.
This is the end of all.
Down on our knees we bow to hatred.
Down on our knees we fade away.
We've tried and failed.
Now Rome burns again.
This time it's all of us.
This time it's forever.
