Put your face on, stage your play.
Deep deception, you've dug your grave.
Cowards cross - Indignation - impostors mount.
The loss of the faithful feared.
How long can you live in denial.
How long will you ignore what's real.
Live your own lies, taste your blood.
Cowards crossing is feared.
And you celebrate your fame.
You celebrate your impostors kingdom.
Nothing is real anymore.
They claim to feed us the truth.
It's the deepest hypocrisy.
Impostors Kingdom.
