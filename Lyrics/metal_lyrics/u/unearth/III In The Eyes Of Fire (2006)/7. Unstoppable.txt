Wander this world with tired hands, wander these streets a broken man.
Been Through this time after time and it won't be the last, but I won't break again.
Second lease on a terminal chance.
Every step met with force and demands.
Reclaim all that loved and destroyed.
Belief lends a hand to the path of the strong.
I want to know, need to know, my next lesson.
I want to feel what's alive inside of me.
I want to know, need to know, my impression.
I want to look inside and see what's made to be.
I want to know.
Concede the loss of the some to fuel the life of others.
The Unstoppable.
Wondered alone, won't break again.
Left forgotten and without hope, I still remain.
Can't stop this heart, won't break again, forever as stone.
