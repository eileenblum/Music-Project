The lines been drawn.
The lines been blurred for far too long.
The years have scaled frustration.
How can you shine within your shell with such profound pretension.
We have lost ourselves to self contradiction.
We have lost ourselves to the rise of opposition.
The hand that leads and feeds you.
Would we all still battle if this caved in beneath you?
We've done it on our own.
All the years of Bleeding.
We've done it all alone.
Now you will bleed for me.
It's a war
We have lost ourselves to our own lies.
The bleeding intentions.
This is the line I've drawn.
This is your last chance.
This is the line I've drawn.
Now you must bleed dry for me.
Wars.
This is the line I've drawn.
This is your last chance.
