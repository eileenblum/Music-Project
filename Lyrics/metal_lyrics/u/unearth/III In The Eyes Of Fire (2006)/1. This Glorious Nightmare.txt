Divine intoxication spills out the pores.
A self diluting fix that craves all the more.
Destructive seasoned vet, full glass of sting.
A bittersweet triumph that weighs in each day.
Obsession - my falsest friend.
Moderation - a fantasy that I can't win.
Devastation - a hardship loss.
Demanding - the pain of wasted years.
Lift me up, tear me down.
Will I last through this glorious night mare?
Collapse all that's sacred, prey on the weak.
Slow painful suicide that steals from each man.
Hells fire soon returns to rape the well.
Prolific doom machine that hears our words.
I'm fighting the will to live with countless persuasions.
I'm fighting the will to live - the endless temptations Its lifeless grip, that haunts us all.
Pulling from every direction, it's lifeless grip grabs hold.
Yearning is now my dissension, it's lifeless grip grabs hold.
Tear me down.
