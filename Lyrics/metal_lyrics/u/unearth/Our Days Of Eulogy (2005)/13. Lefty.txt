Rolled for a chance.
Taking back.
Earned my wings.
Solid ground.
Never fall.
Fueled by strength.
Scale the walls.
Fearless fire.
Focused mind.
Clear a way.
Synchronize your soul and mind.
Rising high.
Feel the life.
Grabbing on.
Vision clears.
A great escape.
Claims our senses.
Stride or fall.
Cleanse to grow.
Fight for all.
Brick foundation.
Play your own.
Skill to gain.
Own the strain.
Lease your future hold.
Future home.
Undying will.
Silence all.
Strife the odds.
Overcome.
Brave return.
Crush rivalry.
Breathe in thought.
See an end.
Tooth and nail, seize, maintain control.
I never will kneel.
I won't let go.
Never chained or slowed by a lack of drive or strength.
Filled in soul.
An everlasting flame I bring.
Clash.
Combine.
Defending my integrity.
Shine.
Foresee a child born who thirsts to grow.
Forever soar.
Sees.
Perceptive judge of barren truth.
A guided hand.
Hold a vital force of life's desire.
Flare the sky.
Essential find.
Fistic vein.
The fuse that binds.
Sear the fuse.
Fistic vein binds.
A nature find.
Brilliant sky I find.
No other way to build foundation.
Time is stalking you.
