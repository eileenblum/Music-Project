It was last night
On the midnight train back home
I ran into this one
Yet unfamiliar tone
I know I should have known
It was last night...
I knew I should have known.
Chaos!
Our busy minds asleep
We drudge across the land
Is this the coming end
Of our monarchy.
Harmless!
We meet increased demands
Is this the life we all
Had in our dreams
Our eternal nightmare.
All of us are blind to others!
(All of us are blind to others)

[Background]

Hide behind our plans to nothing!

[Bridge]

[Solo]

Cage us!
We weep in self defeat
All humanity is lost
In this eternal
Nightmares.
All days are lost...
To conditioned zones
All days are lost...
To what we know.
Free us!
A piece of mind
Gone are dreamers
Who strive to know.
All days are lost...

[Background]

Free us!
A piece of mind.
Gone are dreamers
Who strive to know.
All of us are blind.
