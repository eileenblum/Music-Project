what have we done. never thought that life would come to this. eternal sense of self hatred. blame not who, but ask us why we
did. this is an open book of failure. deceive ourselves all that we can, so we can be cycle of life disrupted. halted by a force
too close to home. guilt runs through our blood. close your eyes and let yourself forget. this guilt runs on and on. consumed all
senses gone. torn, these wings of spirit godless relations. scar this heart beyond all home to heal. this being won't meet this
world. I know I'll take this to my grave. all but saved. die for us my child. this is an open book of failure. deceive ourselves
all that we can, so we can be. I walk each step in anger. found fault in our design. now I kneel down to pray. to plead for a
better time. now I kneel down to pray. in hopes to awake from this. die my child
