it's true there were better ones. that led their people. to lead their country. who cared for this world but who are we to
change. without the strength of all. the nations will crumble. feed lies for war bring the nations to it's knees. risking worldy
structure and integrity. the balance of our kind controlled by hatred, distorted truth and lies. united is the only way to stand.
leaders of the free world lead into the land of the un-free. god sent politics hammered down with a fist too bold. play the
council of pawns in the quest of total control. free us of this hate. free us from this hate. take over the world does hate meed
freedom. divide our home. does hate mean freedom. take over the world. divide our home does hate mean freedom
