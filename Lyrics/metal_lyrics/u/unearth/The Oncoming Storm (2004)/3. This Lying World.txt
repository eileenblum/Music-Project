be afraid of infection. be aware of evil ways. be scared for your protection. best watch your every step instinctual appeal to
fear. collapse and paralyze. far gone is good intention. smokescreen to commercialize teller of tales spin us a line. front page
impersonation. cities burn; the skies will fall civilization reduced to nothing. disease will spread to all. we buy so we
survive. feel the acid rain corrode. I want to take a picture. our lives would look disguised. wash away this lying world.
terminate this iron fist. strangled are we by the bastards of facist culture. strangled are we by the hands of our own people on
the stage it's "our lives". on the stage grows a mountain. as we stumble on we forget. steel toed this path of corruption.
conceal and steer our minds away
