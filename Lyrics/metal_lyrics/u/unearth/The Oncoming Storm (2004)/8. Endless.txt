shadows of doubt consume you. the light you barely see. growing wings of sorrow; have brought you to the winds of plague.
increscent boundries fade the way. a barren future all to real. and still I try to seek up and find the flame. and still I try
inside. it's endless. a barren future all to real and still I try inside endless fight. endless tragedy. endless lunacy. chalk up
the past as a memory. this battering sickness has surely won. all I have wasted. will this erase me. all I have wasted. wash
away. all I have I will erease. time to clean my wounds. can I win my own battle inside and out. can I win this battle
inside-outside. endless fight. endless tragedy. endless lunacy
