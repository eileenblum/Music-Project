Hellbent on the final word
A death stare to prove your stance
Content means nothing more than to rot and crawl in your own filth
Concern has come and gone
Just casualties remain
Go perish on your cross and bleed this change for all its worth
Hollow
You bleed the stench
The constant throes of our remission
The final act of my contrition
This war for the ages has only begun to fall
Possess few loyalties
A passionless unrest
Obsessed with the fallacies
The parasitic ignorance
Itâs over and over in time
A war for the ages has only begun
The final act of my contrition
This war for the ages has only begun to fall
Through the cursed throes of our remission
Look How far weâve come to surrender it all
This War for the Ages has only begun
This War has only begun to fall
