This is a burial of an Age
Of an age of unrest
Consider still each weakness; each bloodshed
Will, once cut from stone fell away
Fell away; put to test
Now bury me; To rise, to rise again
And in the wake of it all times churning
Whoâs left to save; whatâs left to save; whoâs left
The time has come to deliver hell through the beast of Archangel
The time has come to deliver hell - Defend the sacred ground
Do you remember the fire weâre standing in?
This World bestows us the Guards of Contagion
Sold to the golden crown; false ways, false hopes intact
Itâs heresy [3x]
The time has come to deliver hell through the beast of Archangel
The time has come to deliver hell â Defend the sacred ground
Do you remember the fire weâre standing in?
This world bestows us the Guards of Contagion
This is a Burial of an Age
This is the Burial of an Age
The Guards of Contagion
