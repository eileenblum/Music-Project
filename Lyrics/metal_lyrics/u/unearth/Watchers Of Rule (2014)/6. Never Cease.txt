Itâs preposterous to think that Iâd second guess a thing
Itâs preposterous to believe Iâd kill a single moment
With the years at my back
I find that Iâm still reaching
For an answer that keeps at a distance
For an answer that keeps staring back
I am the one true enemy
I am the constant defeating
A madness surrounds
A madness surrounds
A madness surrounds
Itâs wrapped around my neck and severs the life
There is a night wind coming in
There is a night wind coming
The weight crushes down with the fiercest intrusion
Like a catalyst for implosion
The barriers grow high
Higher and higher
Now this is my nature
Higher and higher
Still I keep coming back
On the ashes of the falling ground
Iâll keep coming back
Iâll weather the storms
Iâll bury the weak
And My reaching will never cease [2x]
Will never cease
The weight crushes down
A true catalyst for an implosion
Barriers growing high
Now this is my nature
Itâs wrapped around my neck and severs the life
