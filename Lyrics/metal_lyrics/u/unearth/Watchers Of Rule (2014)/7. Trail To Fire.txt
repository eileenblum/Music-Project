What is to be will be
As evil stalks this sacred ground
A push forward with the promise of a better life
What is to be will be
Under siege, refuge now breeched
Doomed for the divine loss
The diabolical hand of God
Bring down the steel, lead and fire for blood
A crossed venomous command
The misery runs deep
Paranoia consuming the conscience of man
The misery runs deep
Lead to slaughter in the midst of a mountainous rage
A trail to fire
A darkness lays wait in these plains
A trail to fire
A burden of truth ascending on massacre lands
Itâs too late
All anguish reprieved in shallow graves
What is to be will be
A valiant defense falls to cease
The hoary beast of hatred betrays
What is to be will be
Seventeen now orphaned cry
A trail to fire
All led to Slaughter
