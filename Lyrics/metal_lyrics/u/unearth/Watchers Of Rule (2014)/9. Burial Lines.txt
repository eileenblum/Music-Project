This cornerstone
A Testament of worth
With razored claws that freeze the hands of delusion
Force feed a dream in a state of pure unrest
This cornerstone lines the stars never resting
No one can take it away
A life unresting
No one can take it away
Iâll defend my Kingdom
No one can take it away
Force feed this dream until I drown
No one can take it away
Now die my will unconquered
Through the bloodshed burials lines
A darkness waits for the night to come
Blood spilled while the watchers fall
Now face to face to defend my kingdom
With razored claws that freeze the hands of delusion
Not again I wonât let this slip through my fingers
Iâll keep running through
Iâve found my home lives at the Rivers Edge
Iâll keep rushing through
Through the bloodshed burial lines
Face to face I defend my Kingdom
Face to Face
