The clearest of lines seen for what itâs worth
With all the missteps that lay before
The sins in the wake met at full sight
Invited, accepted these ruins of life
The cold constant breach - a pale serenity
Owned by the darkness that swallows the sun
Time to look deep in the heart of this rift
A consequence or a reason
It plays like a passion to sharpen the blade
Just dragging you deeper inside
Your pulse is breathing its life
A finite awakening
It cuts like a sword thatâs been kissed by the flame
Just dragging you deeper down
It drags you deeper- Itâs dragging you down
I know [3x]
Lifetime in ruins
Ruins of Life
