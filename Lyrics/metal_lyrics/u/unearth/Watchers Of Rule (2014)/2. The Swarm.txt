Cast dread to sever ties
Enslave to crush the force
Incensed by the wretched few that feeds the beast in all of us
Long lost the blinded faith- Far gone the common ground
Forewarned of this cold wind - still caution drowns in the dark of night
Here lies our King of Kings
Succumb to rot
Quartered and stoned
Witness the judgment beckoned
Far across the fall has come
The crows of black will seize the throne
Behold these splintered lines of steel each on a path their own
The blur is all we see; Yet firm we lay in our own filth
Release the dragons fire to bring the kingdom to its knees
Here lies our King of Kings
Succumb to rot
Quartered and stoned
Witness the judgment beckoned
Now Beckoned - Our sentence
Bring the kingdom to its knees
We set fire to the reigns
For one â A personal reckoning
For one of the least of these
A death swarm for our personal reckoning
