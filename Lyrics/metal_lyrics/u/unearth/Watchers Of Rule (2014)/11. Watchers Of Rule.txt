This is nothing new, but now you know
The promise of what you believed to be has been stricken long before
The faceless are gone; We all fit their mold
The careless, impulsive rats of this world
Strike fear-concede-control
We are all guilty, strike fear, concede, control
Theyâll put it together
All Faces down
We pledge allegiance to
All Faces down
Halves stand divided fall
All Faces down
A Scored distraction to
All Faces down
The tyranny has come
Now we are all their Game
Fear strikes the rights of fools
Halves stand divided fall
A scored distraction to enslave
The Storms come
The Watchers Rule
They aim to save the world
The Watchers Rule
A scored distraction to enslave
Strike fear, concede, control
Halves stand divided fall
The storms come
The watchers rule
