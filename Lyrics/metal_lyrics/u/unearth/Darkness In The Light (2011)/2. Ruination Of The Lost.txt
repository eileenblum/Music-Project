Like the blade that clipped the wings
And the plague that's drenched the wind
it's now our blood in therising flood

Resentless: All conquering Terra
Demons breath will that and drown all faith and light
Blackened clouds bestow our plight
Raped and marred for their opulence: Opulence
She can and will erase. She will erase

This Loss: Contagious. Bury us Blood; Bury us Blood
Befallen on the masses, Bury us in Blood

Besieged by the coming infliction
Forever blinded by ignorance
Forgotten steps we've sealed our own fate
Ignored and jeered the vast warnings
Demons breath awakes: Demons breath awakes
She can and will erase, Erase

This Loss: Contagious. Bury us Blood; Bury us Blood
Befallen on the masses, Bury us in Blood

Ruination of the Lost
Befalls the masses
Burial us Blood

This Loss: Contagious. Bury us Blood; Bury us Blood
Befallen on the masses, Bury us in Blood
