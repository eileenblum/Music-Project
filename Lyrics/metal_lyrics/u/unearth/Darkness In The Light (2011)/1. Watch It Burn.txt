No longer on your side, No longer within your prison
No longer here to speak with a positive spin on society

So sick of your politics, so sick of your fading religions
So sick of the endless lies that ignite and divide; it's homicide

This is the reason your walls are coming down

Did you even hear a word I said? Torch it all; Torch it all
Did you even hear a word I said? Watch it burn

The writing's on the wall - Watch it burn

So tired of your ignorance, So tired of your passing trends
So tired of your predictive script, You're all dead inside [x2]

It was supposed to be better than this
Can you imagine why?
The path of no return has killed all reason to believe

A paradox in the vow you've taken. Engulfed in your own world
The tried and true are now unspoken. God save you all

Did you even hear a word I said? Torch it all; Torch it all
Did you even hear a word I said? Watch it burn

The writing's on the wall. The writing's on the wall. Watch it burn

Can you imagine why? - The writing's on the wall
We're all paralyzed - Ours has died

Paralyzed - Hope has died. Paralyzed - Our hope has died
Our hope has died [x4]. Our hope is dead

Burn your eyes on our setting sun, Burn out your eyes
