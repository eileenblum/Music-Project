Turn it off; Turn it off. (I) Won't make that mistake
(I've) Been down this road before

Think again; Think again. I will not compromise
(I) Won't compromise anything

Beat down; (I'm) At the end of my rope
Beat down; (I) Can't stand these changes
Beat down; Headfirst I take on survival: survival

Try to tear my down
I won't hesitate to stand face to face with my worst enemy

Standing tall in the face of defeat. Go it alone at my discretion
The hammer falls whenever my will says it does, I promise you

I've fallen way too far, Obsession with the shadow in the light
This constant war will lead me home
This constant war will force me onward

Try to tear me down, Headfirst I take on survival

I fell all too far, Obsession with the shadow in the light
I'm at a constant war, Yet this strife has carried me to my home

I've fallen way too far, Tear me down
We're lost in the shadows in the light, tear me down

Only word
It's been a lifetime of fueled obsessions; a promise kept is my only word
Only word

We're lost in the shadows in the light, tear me down

A promise kept is my only word
Only word, it will be kept. I promise you.
