Ban from our homeland.
A statute for our rights at hand.
A privilege for our protection.
Sliced from our peoples arms.
See how long the fight wages on inside our nations heart.
We are better off to fight ourselves.
How long will we see te battering and tragedy?
No more.
Let it stop.
Let's see how long the fight wages on inside.
We are better off fighting this battle ourselves.
How much will we lose before we fall.
Put down your goddamn weapons.
We are slaughtering our own sons.
Each side solid.
Neither will crumble.
Who will lose?
Only the people.
