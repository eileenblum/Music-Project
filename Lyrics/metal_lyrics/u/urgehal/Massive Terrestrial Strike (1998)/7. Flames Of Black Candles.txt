[lyrics by Mr Triggerhappy Lepermessiah, 1995]

This darkness, so slumb (and) this atmosphere, my hands were numbed
The only movement was the flames of black candles
Who cleansed the air in this chamber of death

My head was slunt as I gazed into the flaming candles
Visions filled my mind
Visions of a rising desecrated power
In this chamber of death, black roses grew
Up from the ashes of souls who lost for my lust and desire
There they will stand as a monument for victory
Over our christian annhilation

lineup:
