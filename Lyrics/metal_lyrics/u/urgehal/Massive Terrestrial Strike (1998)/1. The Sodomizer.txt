[lyrics by Trondr Nefas, 1997]

Torture, slavery, molesting, endless pain
You'll feel them all scum, as you bow down before me
Feel my whip as it shreds the skin of your back
Making your blood stream, out of your wide open wounds

I'm your ruler, you're a fly to my face
A plague for me, i've got to get rid of you
I'm no beast, i'm worse than a beast
Therefore i'll sodomize you like i've sodomized the fluffy sheeps of god

Sodomizer! The fucking sodomizer!
