[lyrics by Seculariser, 1995]

For distant centuries ago
When long forgotten kingdoms and reigns still existed
Our clandestine denomination probed the face of the earth
And discovered the entrance
Our knights entered the passage
Entered another dimension
Stronger and violently powerful

With awe, they looked upon the mighty fortifications
of the pandemonium
His fortress
he granted them
Wisdom...
Immortality...
and prophecy

Now the mortal descendants of this proud ancient people
Seek annihilation of those weak in mind
Of those who defile the soil with their existence
Those who give their souls to Jesus Christ

Steathly entrada success
Wipe the jewish mess
Fucking zionist disciples
Semite rabid rabbi
I exceed excessive pain for you

In one swift stroke the new order of knights
Will seize those who are true anathema

Their shrieks of agony and beseechment for their lives
Will be long remembered as the day of triumph among us, when the new
order has banished them all
To cold void vacuum
And they are truly betrayed by their pity god

Then a new prosperous era will begin, and a powerful empire will be built

The prophecy of a forthcoming millenium
