Sulphur is your mind
Eternal misery

Psychedelic asteroid journey
through infernal maze of horror
Death lurks behind each bend
ready to wheel you in

Rabid these last years have been
alone you have proved the mind
but the exit is lightyears away
and the riddle have no right answers

You search for your ticket to beyond the stars
But in reality you're digging frantic for hell
