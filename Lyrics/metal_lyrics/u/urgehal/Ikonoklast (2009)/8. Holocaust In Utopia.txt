Two decades ago
I tossed around no fairy tales
I hear their lies
I witnessed apartheid

I heard their lies
I witnessed apartheid
I saw their eternity
I hate them
I hate them
I hate them
I HATE THEM!
â¦
All of you filthy cunts!
Their innocence is false
Their words are like poison
Their madness must come to an end
To prevent intoxication of coming generations

Blinded from reality
They think everything is all the same
When theyâre really swimming along the river Styx
May the jaws of Cerberus await them

They are all actors
Their playâs called life
â¦
... make
A dreamworld for eternity!

Down syndrome is just another form of religion


â¦.
A total holocaust
