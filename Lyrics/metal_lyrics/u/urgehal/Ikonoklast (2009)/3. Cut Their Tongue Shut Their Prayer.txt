Black is the world filled with despair
no hope and no salvation
The loss of god is obvious now
Stagnation of all his creation
Axis of evil cycle of death
Universal bleeding a genocide
Total religious propaganda
in the eastern land veiled woman sheltered by the hands of Allah
Imprisoned behind curtains no one sees the rape
of her sewn ups syphilitic synagogue

Slanderous holy man a "martyr"?
Will you be blessed with eternal life and joy?

Knives will rape your children
Mosques becomes tombs
Blood on the walls
The five fucking pillars will fall
Ã la oss gro sammen i skitt

Pilgrims of mecca
Behold the night sky
Kneel before the gleaming light
It will be your last sight

As the flaming star approaches
Death missiles strikes and erase all traces of the cube
A crater of desolation

Death and extermination
Pass into black oblivion
