I'm the thorn in the eye of christ
I'm the carrier of light
I'm the rumours that have been told
Believe in me, or my victim you will be

Embraced by my own shadow
That reflects the consciousness in my soul
Crafts hidden from the weak
Hear our message!

Hordes of blasphemy - burn the temple of god
Condemn the holy spirit and spit it's weak followers on a peak

Come on, let's shed some blood!

A celestial life we were promised by birth 
Instead we were fooled by the gays of god 
Fooled, ha!
Their false piety will never stand proud 
How pity, hahaha!

Come on!
Let's shed some blood

Our battle will be victorious
And heaven will fall
