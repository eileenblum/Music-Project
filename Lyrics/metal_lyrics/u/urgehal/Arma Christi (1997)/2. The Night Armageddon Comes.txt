When the sun is half covered by the moon
The time is ticking fast towards destruction
Fires of the deep will burn all holy 
And the moon will eclipse the sun forever
The christians will suffer the apocalypse
Humanity will be an extinged race
The abyss will rise from the soil
And hell on earth will become reality
When Armageddon has reached it's full point 
The sun suffers a total eclipse

The christians will suffer the apocalypse
Humanity will be an extinged race

And the planet will be invalved by a new life
A life risen from the abyss 
A life strong of hate, strong of hate
The days fade into darkness and exist no longer
The colours that used to be withered into a sea of chaos
Everything is dead
When the night armageddon comes
