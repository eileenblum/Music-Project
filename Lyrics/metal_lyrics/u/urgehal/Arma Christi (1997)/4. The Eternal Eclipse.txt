The eternal eclipse has come
Nightfall will never again suffer the morning sunrise
The night is pure and will forever stay dark
As it can never be menaced by the day 
Those who have kneeled before the cross
Will pray for the last time
Crying for their god, begging helplessly

The churches and the christians bleed
Now that Satan has swallowed their god and sun

The final battle between good and evil is won
And the pain the pain of watching the daylight is gone
Black is the path to the cemetery
Where we feast on the christs in infernal blasphemy
