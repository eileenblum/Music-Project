Deep into a drenched forest drenched by the rain and mist
I lay cold in my lenting, praying to the darkest one

Possess me as I sleep unholy master
Possess me so my dreams can come true
Make me forever a worthy servant
A servant of your unholy might

Conujure the hordes of your proud realm 
To penetrate my body

Conjure the horde of blasphemy

Gather them in a circle of black
And make them to eternally dwell within me
Make me stronger, make me prouder
And make me forever immortal!

Conjure the horde of blasphemy
