In this rotting forest
In this eternal darkness
Where we see, hear and feel

See the naked bodies 
Hear the moaning voice
Feel the cold breath
Three senses that will forever last

Orgies to satisfy our souls
Precious skin so ghastly, so smooth
No heating blood, forever cold

Them I penetrate like knives of the night
Screams of derisious, orgasm of the satisfied
Sexual lust and pleasure, it's no release
No rest embraced by cold
