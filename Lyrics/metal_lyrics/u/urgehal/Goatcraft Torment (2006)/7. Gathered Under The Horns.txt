Demonic forces rising at the night of Armageddon
The soldiers od Satan are armed to fight
All hordes are gathered under the horns
(Evil united to destroy all holy)

The 7 gates of hell are opened
The infernal war is at hand

The sun turn black and the moon turn red
And in mayhemic darkness the world is conquered
By hell...
Christian blood and broken wings as far as
The eye can see, no tomorrow... Eternal night

One thousand years chained to their lies
One thousand years entangled in shit
One thousand years fucked up by their rules
One thousand years is just too long

The sheep has always been a metaphore for the holy ones
There are no sheep they are wolfs locked in cases
