Dead way before death strikes you.
In hell way before the flames eat you.
Stripped from joy, stripped from life,
Embraced by nothing... only death !

What pleasures life may grant you,
It will be robbed from you.
What misery life brings you,
It will always stay with you.

The reaper probes the earth,
Collect's and count's the dead.
Sending us all to hell as fuel for the flames.

And as the quire roar's its tunes.
And death ride's out.
Harmony and peace
finally soothe your heart and soul.

Endless mayhem
Infernal riot
Morbid feast
Satanic black metal in hell.

Infernal soldiers demonized.
Fucked up angels sodomized.
Face of the earth decristianized.
The uiverse satanized.
