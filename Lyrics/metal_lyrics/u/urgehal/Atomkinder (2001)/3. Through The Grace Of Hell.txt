[lyrics by T Nefas 2000]

The dance of the swaying trees
In the holocaust winds

The morning song of the swans
Their wings covered with oil

The flowers that used to grow
Has withered into toxic mud

The rain that pounds to the ground
Are angels tears for our world who died

The snow falls silent from the clouds
The nuclear winter has arrived

Humanity lies sunbathing in cancer rays
Just like children lying rotten in the street

Through the grace of Hell
A voyage through a desert landscape
Through the grace of Hell
The shreds of mankind
Through the grace of Hell
A planet of death
Through the grace of Hell
Pure satanic holocaust

Welcome to the dead zoo
The museum of time
Behold the rise of the sulphur desert
