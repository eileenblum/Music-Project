[lyrics by Ravenloft]

Not a star did shine that night
Only the fullmoon erupted the jetblack sky
As we stood and watched from the top of the hill
It's light guided us through the valley of death
And the mirror in the lake

As wolfs at night we howled at the fullmoon
Our bodies stretched to touch it's glance
Out of reach from our mortal grasp we cry our pain
And pray for release of our earthly confinement
And haunted voices chilled our skin

As eagles we flew over the vast plains
The nocturnal landscape laid spread beneath us
Our eyes flashed through the eerie of the dark
The frost laid like layers around our souls
And forever we shall rule the world

There has always been a night such as this

I wield my blade with pride
Our souls at one with the dark
My will is the law
And before none we kneel

I know now who I am
It's clear written in the stars
I know now and I have always been
A whore to demonic works
