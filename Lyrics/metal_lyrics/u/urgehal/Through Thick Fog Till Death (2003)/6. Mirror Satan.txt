Totally alone I wander by each pillars of hell
Sunken deep beyond the devil waves
Blessed be hellfire and royal satanic dwell
Possessed and vanished
Into the darkness of pentagram caves
Invocation, desecration and ritual conjuring of the goat
Oh father, lick my blood that from my cuts deep float
Its 666 paths to almighty father Satan
Becoming the crooked waves on the horror sea
Purveyor of unholy blasphemic light
Just what almighty Satan wants me to be
By the nocturnal shores the angels screams and dies
With hundred and thirteen tons of might
Our destroyer strikes
And quiet the choir sung
The cordial satanic cipher

Mirror Satan, hail Satan
Mirror Satan, hail Satan

Now when I've usurped the Satanic hell driver cult
Watching and commanding
From my black throne of thousand Christian skulls
It's just the beginning of everlasting murder and insult
So it became, now the reflection is the same
As I kneel down, do the sign and pray
Almighty father Satan, I am now your left hand
For you I will obey and this in hells ever domain
I will never regret now when the curse and the circle is set

Mirror Satan, hail Satan
Mirror Satan, hail Satan
