Invasion storming through the land
Invasion coming from the coast
Invasion coming through the air
Invasion everywhere

Can you hear the bells of Armageddon Tolling?
Feel the end is near, holocaust is coming

Motorized death machines probe the soil
Destroying everything in its way
Armies of insane soldiers kills on command
Raping the old bitch mother earth

See the dead bodies lying rotting on the ground
Heare the alarm of war, it's the devils sound

The metal birds on dead wings are coming
Hear the sound of messerschmith-death
So run for cover cowards or stand and fight
For the glory of your land:
... The glory of Hell

... And the invasion probes the soil
