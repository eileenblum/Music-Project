Thirteenth of December a night of full moon darkness
A empty dead world sigh in the silence
Mesmerizing magic Luna mirrors herself in my eyes
On the edge of sanity depths to cruelty

Dead cold December embrace me bold
Dead cold December possess my soul

It drove me closer to Hell, further from heaven
Dreaming high on mushroom madness
The flames dances, trees around me whispers
This forest fades to grey decay

Dark void illusions, this a night is my nearest
Dark void illusions, this night is the dearest

Ritual, I evoke thy evil spirit
Sacrifice, the shepherdess decorates my altar
Ghastly skin I caress
Dead cold December grace

A mixture of lust and death teases my senses
A quite weird smell indeed
I effuse my seeds and negative hormonal energy
A necrophilic invocation of lustful passion

Another winter to come
On different ground
Surrounded by hells fire
Subterranean desire
