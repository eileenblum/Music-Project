The hair on my arms rise and my skin turns pale
My heart pounds infernal and my penis erects
In these silent hours as I think of you
The feeling is the same as when I killed you
My mind was in a haze, intoxicated
You were the chosen so my visions told me
By each read line from the unholy bible
The urge for death grew to strong to resist

So I chanted the demons from the underworld
To possess my soul
To grant me the power, strength, will and courage
To take the final step

I found you by the river under a pale moon
Your spellbinding beauty were of another world
And the look you gave me with those steel-blue eyes
Spellbound my soul and set my heart afire

But still I found the power and will to rape you twice
And slit your throat, sacrifice your unpure corpse
To master Satan

You were the key to my last journey
My portal form earth onto the flaming threshold of hell
(The key) to enter the realm death: hell:
But still I am here as a mortal in despair
Though countless sluts has suffered my wrath
To complete my sacrificial ritual
(But) of all the bloody faces, you are the one I remember
No single starlit night has passed
Since I poured your death
Without you haunting my dreams and sodomize my soul
Your death became my curse

Haunted by immense nightmares
Filled with bestial fear
Drowned in necro-sorrow
Possessed with infernal blasphemy
