Feel it nesting inside you
Taking control
Something else in charge of your
Body and soul

Be aware of the mirror
Of what you might see
This thing inside
Will never set you free

You're riding on the wave
Of the supreme Satanic pain
Death would be a sweet relief
From this harsh internal rape

Immense pain boiling under
Your skin
As if demons rush through
Your veins

Insane on pain (fear)
You're demon now
