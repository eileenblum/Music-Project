In decadent darkness I grew black wings
Wings of Destruction, a sign of devastation

My ripping claws itched to scar and slice
In infested flesh through the soil of death

Open the ten thousand coffins
Reveal the power of the dim tempting deeps

Sight so far, yet so close
Lurking so gloom, emerge throughout doom

As a discord wave of a massive violating noise
I rise destitute for abomination
Join my quest to live life over tuned
Forever connected to the bounds of suicide control

Enter a new supreme time
Filter the weakness which lies within mankind

Creating the ultimate machine
With flesh, with blood, and misanthropic discipline
