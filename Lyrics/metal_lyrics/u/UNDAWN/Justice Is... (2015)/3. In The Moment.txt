Somewhere between delay and haste
We look back to reflect
Tell us what tomorrow brings
The locus of control

Embrace the beauty of life
Live every day like itâs your last

Seize the day
In the moment
Tomorrow shall be erased
For the moment

We always search for our happiness
In the moment we feel the most of it

Itâs not about the observation
Itâs a state of mind, one of a kind
A conscious act, participate!
Afraid to lose control

Locked in our tailor-made prison cell
Grab opportunities by their throat
And never ever let them go

[Chorus]

Embrace the beauty of life
Live every day like itâs your last

[Chorus]

Embrace the beauty of life
Live every day like itâs your last
We always search for happiness
In the moment

Seize the day in the moment
