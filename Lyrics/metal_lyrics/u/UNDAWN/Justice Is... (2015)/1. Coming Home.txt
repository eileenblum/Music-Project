For those who still believe
For those who blindly trust
Home is where the heart is
The heart is where we belong

The list of grievances
On and on those sentences
Either with or against us
Now Iâm giving in
Coming home

Resistant for the tides,
Safe before the flood
They saw the water coming
But they all said: Johnny-be-good

For decades theyâve been seen
As the towers of strength
Now whatâs only left of it
Is a square of greed, I donât understand

Suit up, disrobe
Got to get myself out, misanthrope

Iâm coming home
The place I used to live
I used to know
This is a one man show

This narcissistic culture
These spoiled walls
Deceive, mislead
Just another day at the tower of greed

This is revolution
This is counterweight
Iâm walking down the stairs
Hellevators passing by

Let it go, let it go
Just a little step, Iâm coming home

Iâm coming home
The place I used to live
I used to know
Iâm not giving in
Iâm coming home

This is a one man show
I used to know
This is a one man show

For those who still believe
For those who blindly trust
Home is where the heart is
The heart is where we belong
Where you belong

For those who still believe
For those who blindly trust
Home is where the heart is
The heart is where you belong

For those who still believe
For those who blindly trust
Home is where the heart is
The heart is where we belong

Iâm coming home
