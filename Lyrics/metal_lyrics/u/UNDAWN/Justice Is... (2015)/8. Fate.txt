You can run, but you cannot hide
Because your ass belongs to me
A smile from side to side
Will be the last thing you see

My cold breath
Brings shivers down your spine
You've crossed the end of the line

You can ask for forgiveness
And hope you'll be heard
But no one's gonna save you now
You can beg me for mercy
And hope for the best
But it won't be enough
I'll put you to rest

You took it all, everything I had
All my loved ones are gone
No time for regret
Wave of destruction goes on

So much hate
So much pain
So many broken that remain
So much death
So many gone
Hell's where you belong

[Chorus]

You can beg me for mercy
