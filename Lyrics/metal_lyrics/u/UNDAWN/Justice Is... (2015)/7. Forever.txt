I can always count on you
Always there to break my fall
Mr. and Mrs. Know-It-All again

Of course I have my doubts
We disagree, we scream and shout
But there's one thing I regret
Those three words I never said

They are imprisoned but meant the heart
When I'm broken

'Cause I know
At times we're filled with hate
And we might think we're better off alone
But we ain't stronger on our own

We're bounded
Your support I take at heart
A family from the start and till the end
Forever and always a friend

I know that one day will come
I'll realize that when you're gone
The echo of your voice
Will be heard, on and on

Your lessons are a privilege
Forever I'll hold on to this
Your wisdom I will cherish
As I carry on your name
Carry on your name

[Chorus]

I love you forever
Forever and always

[Chorus]
