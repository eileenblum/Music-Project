I'm moving on

We were friends for such a long time
Shared everything
I knew you like the back of my hand
But the times are changing
And your path leads astray
I can't take it anymore

So this is where it ends for me
I'm moving on alone
I guess there's nothing left to say
While you're waiting I'm long gone
I'm moving on alone

You were so strong, a beloved person
The kind that's real
But the gamble changed it all for good
Now you're here showing innocent eyes
But I'm staring in the eyes of a dead man

[Chorus]

We're through here
I'm moving on
While you're waiting I'm long gone
I'm moving on alone

Of course I had my doubts
When your thoughts became my reality
Your heart played tricks on me every time
When I needed you

Your words
Mean nothing to me
When you hated me for so long
And I won't regret everything I've done
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
