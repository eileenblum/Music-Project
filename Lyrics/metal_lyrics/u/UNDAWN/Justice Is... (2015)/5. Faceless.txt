Every day
Every day I'm coming clean
Pulled by the strings of routine

Automatic
Automatic pilot flies my life
Destination: âAlways Rightâ
Until I met you

Imagine
What we're able to do
I'll give you back
What they took from you

When I see your face
Guide me through
The world you did create

Do your work
Do your dirty work
Like a man
Molten man of the iceberg

Handheld
Remote controls your life
No destination you can't find
Until you met me

Imagine
That nothing's what it seems
That my existence
Is nothing but a dream

[Chorus]

I will give you shelter
Thoughts are overwhelming
I am you, you are me
The faceless

No one can replace
Where we lay our heads
Now I realize
You're just a projection

Greed, my friend
Deceit, despair, dead end
Disappear
You're just a projection

No one can replace
Where we lay our heads
Now I realize
We are both the faceless
