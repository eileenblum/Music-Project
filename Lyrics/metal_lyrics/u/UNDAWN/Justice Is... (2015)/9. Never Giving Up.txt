[feat. BjÃ¶rn Strid of Soilwork]Guided by inner arrogance
Towards our values they march
From the top of their lungs
Singing war song after song

This one last serenade
Is for those who gets the blame
Everyone who feels the same:
Walk through this acid rain

This storm, this storm
This storm is upon us
Guard yourself
Together we will unite

We never give up
For what we stand for
Not in a million years
No matter how long it will take

Making bets in a burning house
We will rise, we will step out of this
Hoist your sails, the water is fierce
To this injustice we will resist

This storm, this storm
This storm is upon us
Over my dead body
They shall not pass

This is to every single creature that lives
Just don't give up and let's get rid of this

[Chorus]
Keep your head up, keep your head up
Eye for an eye, we will survive

Now the water is calm
And the wind is fair
In a stream of consciousness
The world has woken up

A moment of serenity
For our own dignity
But not in a million years
We'll let them affect us

We will resist
We will survive
Keep your head up
Never give up

[Chorus]
Keep your head up, keep your head up
Eye for an eye, we will survive
