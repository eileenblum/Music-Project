My brother

We can argue over silly little things
Not with our mouths but with our fists
So when you disagree and I am provoked
You can be the person I hate the most

We are friends related by blood
Iâll watch your back; just like I should
So when you grow mature as were getting old
You can be the person I love the most

You can be furious in peace
Truly loved
When times are rough
No one can change the bond we hold
No other, my brother

Together we can handle everything
Whatever life may bring
Whatever song it sings
Together we are stronger than alone
A force unknown
So let us conquer all

[Chorus]

In the darkest of times
You remember to turn on the lights
Brother, do you feel this within
There is no fight we cannot win
Together stand strong

My brother
