This is justice
Blocked by knowledge
This is justice
Lean on our blindness
This is justice
The veil of ignorance
This is justice
Based on our kindness

I am the best off member of society
Living life just as it should be
Wealth, power and prosperity
This means a whole lot to me

Utopia, based on jungleâs laws
Ignore the poor, and the trouble they caused
Every resistance, will be declined
Who falls behind, shall be left behind

Seek for rest in your thoughts

Assume you wouldnât know your place
Knowledge blocked
Create a veil of ignorance and bliss
Define for yourself what justice is

Define for yourself what:
Justice is equality in democracy
I am the worst off member of society
No mouths strapped, a chance to participate
No more tools to suppress and suffocate

All for one, none for all
Dead end, with your back against the wall
Watch your steps, donât dare to fall
Lay on the ground and start to crawl

[Chorus]

This is justice
Blocked by knowledge
Define for yourself what justice is
Seek for rest in your thoughts
Ruling your life, in the depth we dive

Imagine that nothingâs true nor false

[Chorus]
