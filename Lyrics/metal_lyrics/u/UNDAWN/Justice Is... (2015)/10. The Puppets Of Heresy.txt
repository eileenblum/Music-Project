They are our opinion
They are hunting us
Unknown power of dominion
In which we blindly trust

They are elusive, distort the yin and yang
We acknowledge as fast as we can
Our freedom, is singularity
We are the puppets of heresy

Broken, with arms wide open
I am still walking
The path that leads to nowhere

We are the puppets of heresy
We got used to it, we're blind to see
We are the puppets of heresy

We follow footsteps
Hold us blind and make our day
Even the architects got lost in this maze

Define our imposed values
Fulfill our hungry thoughts
Bombardment of influence
Like a magnet bound to be:

[Chorus]

Trying to find the way
To get through these times
I'm trying to find the way

I'm trying to find the way
To get through these times
I'm trying to find, I'm willing to find
That your path is mine

Trying to find the way
To get through these times
I'm trying to find the way
