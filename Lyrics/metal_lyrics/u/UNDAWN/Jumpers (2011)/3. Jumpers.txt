Weâve got jumpers

One day, a damn hard day
The clock was ticking too short
Letâs throw these men overboard

This day, this fucking mad day
The innocents have to pay
The wounds for you and me

Weâve got jumpers

Next day, a flashbacking day
Itâs on our retinaâs burned
What the fuck have we learned

Same day, this crazy feared day
All the bodies weâve found
Itâs the only thing that counts

All the bodies are falling
Falling from the sky
The fear that is crawling inside
From the inside out
Feel the airâs galling
Itâs a black day for us all
