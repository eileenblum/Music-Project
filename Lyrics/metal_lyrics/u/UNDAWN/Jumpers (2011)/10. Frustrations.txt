Frustrations
When you feel love
It turns out to be hate
Nothing you can
create
But only devastate

Our future turns out to be the past
The first turns out to be the last

When you are hurt
Thereâs nothing you can heal
Donât tell me what you feel
But only say whatâs real

Our future turns out to be the past
The first turns out to be the last

I gave my all
More than you should know
Youâre not the same
But who am I to blame

Frustrations

Trust is fucking gone

Frustrations
