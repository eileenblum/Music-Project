Here I am, born in a world of people
Here I am, born in a world of fools
Here I am, screaming loud
Here I am, suffering religious rules

There they come
Taking over control (taking control)
There they come
Making scars on my body

I want to run away from here
Run away but thereâs nowhere else to go

There they come
Taking over control (taking control)
There they come
Cutting through my soul

Why does no one help me
Why does no one really care
Why does no one help me
Why does no one really dare
âCause there is
Nowhere else to go

They will prevail, I know
