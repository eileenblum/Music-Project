I have become
The upper man for now
I look down
Now itâs your turn to bow
I donât waste
Any more energy
You have started
My own anarchy

You mean nothing to me

I donât deserve

These things youâve put me through,
I was your friend
But now youâre my foe
I donât care any longer
It is your turn, you see
You see

You mean nothing to me

Perfect, in imperfection,
Reject, by indirection
Reflect, without reaction

You mean nothing to me
