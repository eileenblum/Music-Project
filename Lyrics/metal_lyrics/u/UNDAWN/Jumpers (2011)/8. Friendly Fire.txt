Mist is all over the place,
Tightness all in the face
Targets disappearing, oh hell

Appearances occurring
As wolves in the night
My friends on fire
The beginning of a fight
What are they thinking
Bullets are flying around
This ship is sinking

Friendly, Fire
The path of my desire
Friendly, Fire
Hitting our men
Friendly, Fire
The path of my desire
Friendly, Fire

In this dark rain of fire,
They donât caress desire
My heart is beating fast
Would this be the last

Burning thoughts
All over my head
One shot will be paid
By a thousand in your back

What are they thinking
Bullets are flying around
This ship is sinking

Friendly, Fire
The path of my desire
Friendly, Fire
Hitting our men
Friendly, Fire
The path of my desire
Friendly, Fire
