Going down

Going down (going down)
We are descending
Fasten your seatbelts
And pray for a proper landing

Losing your friends in life
Was the worst of our fears
The plane came crashing down
Onto the glacier of tears

Embrace me
Will you stay with me
Donât walk a way
Embrace me
Will you stay with me
Erase this day

Deadly silence after the first hit
Not dead but bleeding just a bit
Trying to help my teammates out
The ones who are injured, scream and shout

Who is lost (who is lost)
Search for survivors at all cost
Is there anyone still breathing
Or did they all die by the frost

Embrace me
Will you stay with me
Donât walk a way
Embrace me
Will you stay with me
Erase this day

No
