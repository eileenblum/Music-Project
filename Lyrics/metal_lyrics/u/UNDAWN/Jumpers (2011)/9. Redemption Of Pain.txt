Do you know what pain is
Fatally like a black widowâs kiss
Heartless like a graveyard of bones
Treacherous like a world full clones

Anger through your veins
Helpless stuck in chains
Anxious to face the pain

Would you be there
My redemption of pain
Would you help me
My redemption of pain
Would you save me
My redemption of pain
Release the pain

Do you think that I am insane
Fuck you all you donât know pain
One person, who made me feel like this
Only can fulfil, my greatest wish

Pay the price Iâve paid
Destroy what you have create
Feel what I have felt

Would you be there
My redemption of pain
Would you help me
My redemption of pain
Would you save me
My redemption of pain
Release the pain
