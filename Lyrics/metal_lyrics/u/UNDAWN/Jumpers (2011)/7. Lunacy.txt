Hey there mister lunacy
Stuck in your own fallacy
Be what you want
Or go away

Back off (back off)
Back off (back off)
Stay away
Heavy burden
To shoulder is released

Theoretic and pathetic
The attitude you show
The lowest of the low

Heretic, pragmatic,
This time I will fight back
Now I wonât be wrecked
Once and for all

Back off (back off)
Back off (back off)
Stay away
Heavy burden
To shoulder is released

So here I am heads up this time
Donât you dare to cross this line
Iâm not yours but you are mine
So this is it I know Iâll be fine

Back off (back off)
Back off (back off)
Stay away
