I'm not a guy who can forget these feelings
Like a minute in an hour
Iâm not a guy to guide
Not a strong guy to fight

I want to cry but there are no tears
What can I do to give up these fears
Iâm bleeding and my hatred comes alive
I am alone in this dark night

But my regrets are useless
My intention to live, clueless
This is a black day of my life
But I was wrong
Those were not the arms where I belong

Life is a treasure
Love is a lie
Live without you
What can I do

But my regrets are useless
My intention to live, clueless
This is a black day of my life
I blame my feelings
To find an answer to the question
Iâm turning back to the sentence of my life

Life is a treasure
Love is a lie
Live without you
What can I do

I want to cry but there are no tears
What can I do to give up these fears
Iâm bleeding and my hatred comes alive
I am alone in this dark night

I want to cry but there are no tears
What can I do to give up these fears
Iâm bleeding and my hatred comes alive
I am alone this night
