Did something break in your chest?
You're talking constantly
like those condemned to death
to restrain reality

Volcanoes ejaculate
as you rape yourself
Come, let's release the hate
and blast the hiding shell

We live at the border of the known world
Like lizards we crawl the monstrous wall

Erase that golden day
It becomes nothing
Nothing is real but these hands
Clutching the darkness of the winter ahead

The endless winter ahead

Erase that golden day
It becomes nothing in these hands

Let's praise the pain in your chest
That was your fate
Evolution at its best
Your altered state

We live at the border of the known world
Like lizards we crawl the monstrous wall
