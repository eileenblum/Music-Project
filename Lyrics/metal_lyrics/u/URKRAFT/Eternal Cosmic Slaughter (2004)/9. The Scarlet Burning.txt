Thinking of breathing
Not trying myself
If I open my eyes it will just
torture my senses to death

Thinking of accepting
Not trying myself
Still-standing blood
streaming again

Dreaming of the scarlet burning
Dreaming of the hopeless waste
And if I live forever
I'll awake when you reach me here

Heat of the scarlet burning
melts the blood in my veins
Pain from the glowing embers on my skin
awakes me again
