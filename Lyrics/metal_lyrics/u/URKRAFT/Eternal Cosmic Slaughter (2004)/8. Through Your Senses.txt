My eyes are learning how to see
Been away in darkness for so long
Travelled night and day to get through
Get into reality where they belong

Submit to the ray of light
Subside in the alternate frame
Conceal your deepest thoughts
Conceive your eyes as a sky-high flame

My ears are learning how to hear
Been away in silence for so long
Listened to an endless quiet scream
Now even the wind blows a flighty song

Submit to the blasting sound
Subside in the alternate song
Conceal your deepest thoughts
Believe your senses - imagination might be wrong

Live in the world from within
Step out of the deep black shade
Let your senses sustain...

Caught in a changeable world
Rooted in denying doubt
Constantly exposed in every direction
Through your senses

Live in the world from within
Step out of the deep black shade
Let your senses sustain...

My skin is learning how to feel
Been away in numbness for so long
Embracing all - unable to touch
Now every brush makes me feel strong

Submit to the fragile flesh
Subside in the alternate brush
Conceal your deepest thoughts
Deceive your senses in reality's mush
Caught in a changeable world
Rooted in denying doubt
Constantly exposed in every direction
Through your senses
