All-embracing urkraft
unknown to my face

All-destructive death craft
Eternal cosmic slaughter
Cold, so cold

This gift from the ancient primate
was only lies and chains
Give praise to what we inherit
We hail you, AMoeba God

On the empty sky
Fortune is floating homeless by
Mocking, sobbing:
Come on, come on!

Screaming to the sky:
Come down!

Will I find truth in intensity?
Will I find truth in devotion?

Show me truth in lechery
Show me truth in love

Frailty

Creating truth in devotion
Creating truth in love

Frailty
Frailty
