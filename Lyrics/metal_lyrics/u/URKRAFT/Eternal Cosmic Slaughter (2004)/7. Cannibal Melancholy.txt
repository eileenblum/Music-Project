Who gave birth to this disease?
What feeds the demons in my blood?
Sick cannibal melancholy
Who blew this freezing wind my way?
Is this my love supreme?
Sweet whorish machinery

The forthcoming time
- Ages in darkness
Lights out, everyone!

We sleep together
- Ready for abortion
I would have died in your womb

How could we forget,
who gave birth to this disease?
Shooting Heaven down - lying worthless at our feet

Spiritual defective world order
Defective world order

The forthcoming time
- Ages in darkness
Lights out, everyone!

We sleep together
- Ready for abortion
Dying in your womb
