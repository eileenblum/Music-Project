The soul of our being stands rooted
Planted deep in earth's heavy soil

As the body stretches
in heavy strokes dragging Heaven down

The empty time where death is lost
and body becomes eternity

Our detest for the know-all of the sky
The merciless future
The spirit of the world is slowly turning in

Slaughter of our language within
Windless tornado eye
A word is just a sign
Signs from the soul's face

Life ends in the midst of the world
Spiritless and empty-headed
Life starts in the midst of the world
Mindnumb and soulless

Under the sun life grows
Joyfull it shows
Under the sun life withers
True self forget me not

Slaughter of our language within
Windless tornado eye
Our life is just a sign
Mercy of time
