Come on, let's breathe the air
internal joyfull ease
Go break the graceless hope
and let your faith decease
Go on - get down and feel the mud
I?d rather kick your ass
than testify against my blood

Why feel dignity?
Every day is just a one-night stand
We need no sympathy
Death will take care...

When free - then lost
Caught in an empty shell
We feel - through touch
Our flaming lips reveal the will

When free - then lost
Caught in an empty shell
We turn to dust
Unleash the will

Come break my fragile heartbeat
and put my face beneath your feet
Let me evanesce in eternity

Come on, let's be prepared
and make their stonehearts bleed
Go out in darkness - grope
You'll suffer and succeed
We scream - for a solution never found
Let hell break loose
because fate has never been around

Why feel dignity
Today is just a one-night stand
I need no sympathy
Death will take care... of the man in me
