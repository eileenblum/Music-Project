Now lost in chaos - perfect world
Transcending truth - it signifies
the monochromatic picture of reality

Hey, you triumphant, King of Flesh!
Don't bow your head and lick the dust
Arise and blast distinction between soul and blood

Blameless incarnation
of the human beast
Shameless since creation
Of Earth's flesh he feasts

Prince of lies - commit your fate
A fate - that we will die
Empty skull - face your hate
The hate we deny

In this spacial allocation of time
written signs assure eternity
Still life is defined by our mortality

Fragile incarnation
Bones are screaming underneath
Hopeless domination
Blessed be the human beast

Blessed be the human beast
