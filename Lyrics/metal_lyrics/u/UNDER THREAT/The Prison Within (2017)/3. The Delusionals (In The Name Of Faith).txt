The very substance of our living,
The essence of what lies beneath
To believe or not to believe,
There lies the question...

What is true? What is false?
Life or death it's what's at stake,
To stay in touch with reality
To truly try to understand

Listen to those who talk
Watch what they stand for
Form your own thoughts
Donât be led astray
Find the source, believe them not
They might seem, well intended lies!

See what they have done,
The pain that they have caused,
The hate, the shame,
That faith has brought us all
The cost we've paid, the lives at stake,
The blood they've shed, in the name of faith!

The path of reason is full of enemies,
To succumb to empty promises of eternal life is to allow the fear to fester, to take control

Once the eyes of faith have opened confirmation's anywhere

Once belief in afterlife has conquered
Intolerance prevails

Wake up from the deluding slumber
Of the ancient lie

The common places of our language
Conceal the vacuity and strangeness
Of many of our beliefs

Subdue the fear, cast out illusions
Embrace what's real

Wake up from the deluding slumber
Of the ancient lie
