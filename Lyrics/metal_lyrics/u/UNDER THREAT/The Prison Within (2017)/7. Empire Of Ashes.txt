Wake up to the stench of rotten doctrine
Cult of the absurd
Witness the incoherent domain of pseudo knowledge, followed by its herd

Delusion and blind faith as core life values
Otherworldly fantasy
Freedom of belief at the expense of countless lives
Dire lunacy

Vacuousness of speech,
Ideological bankruptcy sugarcoated by sanctimonious preachy hypocrisy!

Bigotry, misogyny, demagoguery
The poverty of your thinking will be
Laughing stock of future eons,
The ruins of your theocracy
An Empire of ashes itâs all that will be left!

Antithesis of reason, antagonist of logic
The core value of your doctrine is indistinguishable from mental illness.
Alienation, clouded judgement, the insanity of your toxic rationale:
World destabilizing stupidity!
