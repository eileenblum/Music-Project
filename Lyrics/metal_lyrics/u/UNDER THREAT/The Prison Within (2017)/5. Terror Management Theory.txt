Permanence is an illusion we all love to feed and entertain
We give it form, meaning and names
And in our denial we distract the truth collectively
The unnameableâ¦the ultimate...

Theâ¯terrorâ¯livesâ¯in meâ¯
Thisâ¯fearâ¯Iâ¯can'tâ¯escapeâ¯
Butâ¯Iâ¯shouldâ¯faceâ¯
Thisâ¯fateâ¯Iâ¯can'tâ¯changeâ¯
â¯
Itâ¯keepsâ¯me up atâ¯nightâ¯
Theâ¯awarenessâ¯ofâ¯theâ¯endâ¯
Should I embrace the darkness ahead?

All these fabrications, every single thing we use to escape
Make who we areâ¦or so we think

Bittersweet's the flavor of existential delight
Have it as much as you can, it's all you'll ever have
Don't let the illusion fool your senses

Completely out of control, your emotions get the best of you
It's the fear you lock inside buffered by your self-esteem

Anxiety...need and painâ¦
Oh please death come at (at last) once and rid me of them!
