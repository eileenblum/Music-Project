Impossibility overwhelming me
But I'm done trying to figure it out existence
There is no meaning, purpose, destination
Only the burden of the here and now

Another made up escape
To cope with all of this

All we can have is distractions
From inevitability

I am the meaningless trapped in an absurd world
I am the existentialist
The big picture I see andâ¯the causality of it all
I'm terrified to think there isn't more than this

Another day another pointless race
All so caught up in their catch 22
So lost and drowned in hopeless routine
Condemned by time and oblivion

I struggle everyday
To escape the apathy
Fleeting joy, then hell again
The abyss smiles at me

I am the meaningless trapped in an absurd world
I am the existentialist
I am the troubled one
Trapped in the prison of the self
I sometimes crave the end to set me free

I treasure so much the here and now
But then it too soon becomes the past
Existence is the wax of the candle
And time the flame that melts it away

I am the anxious one
The over thinker I can't escape
I am the existentialist
I'm terrified to realize there isn't more than this
So I often crave the end to set me free.
