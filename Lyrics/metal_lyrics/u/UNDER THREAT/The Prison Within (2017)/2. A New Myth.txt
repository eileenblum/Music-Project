Tradition is our doom
Old scripture is the cancer
The time for ancient symbols
And old values has run out

Our systems are crumbling
Our actions are disturbing
Misguided, alienated
Sleepwalking towards the abyss

Misread mythology
Overrated superstition
This neo-obscurantism
Is the root of our downfall

We must see past religion
And transcend our self and culture
Stress skepticism, break all chains of prejudice

Secular and free from dogma
And systems of belief
A new myth

Maybe there's the key
To a new dawn for humanity
To a new myth

Spirituality and morality
Free from doctrine
A new myth

Learn to train your mind
It's time to find the answers within
Time for a new myth

Expel every taboo
Give way to honest conversation
Far from bias and self-righteousness
Open up to questioning beliefs
The truth lies beyond what you want it to be
