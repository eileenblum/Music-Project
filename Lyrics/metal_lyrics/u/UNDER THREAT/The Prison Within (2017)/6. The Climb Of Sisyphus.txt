From the day you are born
You are fed with the illusion
Expected to play a role, to serve a purpose

No room for inquire
No questioning allowed
Just forced to join this herd

Then your naive self is all wired
Full of ideals, hopes and desires
Another fool to join the race
What is it that you expect to get?

Eventually you'll realize
There is no winner, there's no prize
Where is it that you expect to arrive?
Rolling this boulder all your life

Controlling, possessing
So urged for the outcome
Constantly missing
The wonders before you

Scheming and planning
Obsessed with tomorrow
Too busy with anticipation
To savor the moment

At the top of the hill the boulder will roll
Life will have happened while you pushed a stone
Doomed to start over like Sisyphus before
'Til the end of your days.
