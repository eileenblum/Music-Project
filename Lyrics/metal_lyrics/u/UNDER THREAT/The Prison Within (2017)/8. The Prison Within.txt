Perception is the mother of deception
Just watch how interaction, semantics and perspective
Change the way you feel and think
We are not the ones running the show

We're mere survival machines
Vessels for our genes generation after generation

Consciousness is nature's cruelest joke
The phenomenon of feeling like someone
Who isn't really there

The experienced world
Both construct and fact
Come to terms with the bars that lock us in

Your states of mind
Constantly deceive
Learn to deal with the prison within

Prisoners of unexpected change
Slaves to biology in a cage of flesh
Vulnerable to our complex chemistry
Nowhere to be found is the one we so call "I"

It's never been about how happy you can be
But more about how to survive
When you accept the temporary nature of things
Oblivion may be the only place where you'll be free
