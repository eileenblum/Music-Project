As if everything I were, just an illusion of control...
The self-deceptive sense of being someone else

As if I had a choice, pulled by the strings of
Predetermined fact.
The only way to learn, is to accept and see the facts; for what they really are!

Choice, fate, guilt, will, thought, goals,
Merit or fault, only mirrors of the delusion
that you call " yourself"

Freedom, decision, act and volition, all superstition, source and cause, only a product, just a result of space and time.

Love or hate, lust and faith, fail or gain or simply insane;
the strings that determine your sense of
experience and thought... are being pulled again!

A marionette's lament, the realization of lack of control, prisoner of your own thoughts
never to understand exactly why.

Only a marionette's lament,
Only a marionette's lament.

The strings that make you what you are,
Are the strings that determine what you'll never be

The strings that attach you here and now
Are the strings that will detach you from existence!
