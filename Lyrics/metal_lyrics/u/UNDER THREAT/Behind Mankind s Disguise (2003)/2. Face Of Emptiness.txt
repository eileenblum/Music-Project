[Lyrics: D.Bermudez]

Deceptive form of perfection
Lies around the putrid
bouquet of success impragnated
by sceptic desires of beauty an arrogance

Slave puppets of skin an vanity for sale
in a ninety-sixty-ninety
magnetic-cocktail conversation
Waiting to justify a cosmetic existence

Articial touching confection
false commiseration
in fancy dressed
Face of indiference
wearing a suit
in a sarcastic emptiness magnification

Vulgar elegance appetites
dancing satisfied by pride
in the slow valtz of degradation
around the sofisticated icon
of unconssiousness and luxury.
