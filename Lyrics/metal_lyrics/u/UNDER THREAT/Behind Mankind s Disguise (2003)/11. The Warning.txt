[Lyrics: N.Bermudez]

Coming suddenly
invading silently
crushing slowly
the crucial moment arrives

This words you can (hear) read
but you will never learn
till the beast devours
the last piece of your being
So the warning is here
be the strong one that survives

Crashing once, crashing twice
you will never know
when it's gonna end
Once I said: this chance could be the last,
But sometimes the animals are deaf
living by their selfish genes

Losing perception of acts
becoming the feast of time
and one of those who will fall

Living in the random of posibilities
we are the animal devouring or dying
dragged by the change of times.
