[Lyrics: D.Bermudez]

The trap is beside you 
waiting to devour
every second trying to subdue
your unwelcomed efforts

Twisting and standing down the storm
containing the fury of the clash
resisting the power of the established
Holding to avoid ourself extermination

Listen to the lost voices of those who fell
under the voracious appetite of the machine
remember everyday that this chance could be the last
cause we all are under threat

Fighting to survive
in the middle of the tragedy
trasgressing the jealous realm
of this bizarre theater.
