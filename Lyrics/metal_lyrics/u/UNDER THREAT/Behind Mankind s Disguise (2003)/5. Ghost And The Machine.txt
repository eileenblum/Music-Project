[Lyrics: D.Bermudez]

Who is "me"?
The machine that vibrates with pain?
What am I?
an inner ghost that guides my hate?
Who is "in there"?
A divine comander from a higher soul dimension?

What is "me"
Am I an improved animal
scultured by culture?
Is there an "in there"

I am not the ghost trapped inside
I am just the possiblity made act
Not the machine moved by will
I am in fact the one who acts

No guilt, no merit, no will
I am the interaction become fact
the result of my own action

The ghost in the machine
A trap settled by the past
The source of real confussion
Your self inflicted guilt

I am a confluence of the universe
I am the past, I am the environment
I am not inside, I am not outside
I am your act in me, you are my act in you.
