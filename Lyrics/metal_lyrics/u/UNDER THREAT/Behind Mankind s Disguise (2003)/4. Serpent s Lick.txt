[Lyrics: D.Bermudez]

I am the serpent's lick
dressed in the casock of the truth
exploiting your emotive nature
you will love to be my slave

Feed me with your ignorance
I will satisfy your emptiness
By the power of the words
I will lead you into confussion

I will tell you how to live
I will tell you what to love
I will tell you how you'd wish to die

I only am what you would be
If only you could be it
I am the serpen't lick

Improving the art of deformation
mastering the skill of manipulation
In the name of freedom and justice
Information will be
the most burning of your adictions.
