[Lyrics: D.Bermudez]

Where can you draw the limit for deception?
when is the final frustration?
How can I find the source of control?
Does my pain increases your strenght?

I am looking for the way out
to stop the screaming of the soul
to understand the reasons to be
to decifer the strange riddle of interaction
I am at the gates of deception

Your false concern
misleads my sacrifice
impurity inundates
usurping my genuine intention
fragments of my innocence
Stunt of a dream
Leaving just the ruin of a paradise for rent

Like a laughing joker
conditions appear to me
to show my own desolation
to demonstrate the misery of existence
saddly dressed like ilussory hope.
