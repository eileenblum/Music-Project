[Lyrics: D.Bermudez]

Back to the window of the lost ilussions
Reminding the sea of forgotten emotions
Where clouds of emptiness fill the sky
the answer to the riddle lies murdered

Opening the door to the invisible
waiting for the imperceptible
guided by the trace of my bleeding wounds
I am searching for my own forgiveness

Now I just hear the silence so noisy
now I only can look into the dark
seeking the cure to my own deception
I close my eyes to the past

Getting closer to the mirror
I can see the other side of the end
guided by the trace of my bleeding wounds
I am searching for my own forgiveness

Escaping from the beauty of this tragic Me
I fall free into the arms of my next past.
