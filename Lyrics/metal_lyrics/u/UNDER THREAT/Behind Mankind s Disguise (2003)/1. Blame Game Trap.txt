[Lyrics: N. Bermudez]

I dare you to look
deep inside my errors
don't you see by chance
a familiar face?

Hidden beneath human pride
becomes invisible
Lost in the sea of slanted views
becomes imperceptible

Blinded by the urgency of solutions
clarity can wait for another day
pointing out from your comfortable position
you forget to get and insurance for errors

The lack of objectivity is our
self settled trap

Now you are falling in disgrace
Have ran your race in vain
Always ignoring the hidden face
Filled with tiredness and dejection
You have fell and loose
In the blame game trap

Stumbling and falling
in the search for understanding
forgetting this condition
as result of alienation
playing the role of maximum creation
condeming brothers in the name of perfection.
