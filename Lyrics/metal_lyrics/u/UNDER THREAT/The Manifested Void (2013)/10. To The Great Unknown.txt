The time has come
For me to join the whole
The quest of a lifetime
I shall follow beyond
In nothingness, the truth I shall find

Do not mistake my resolution for pain or illness
For the power of my sight has no equal
My soul is ready, my mind is ripe
To cross the threshold, to enter the timeless void

To complete the circle in unity
To enter totality and abandon bitter and sweet

To join the thousand heroes
And leave the million sorrows
I offer my spirit in dissolution
To the great unknown

In a deathlike state I wander aloof into the night

Embracing the light of my one way journey
And the radiance of its vast immensity
I reach out to grasp the fruit of the tree of knowledge

Purified, true and immortal
Embraced by the waters of time eternal I drown

To join the thousand heroes
And leave the million sorrows
I offer my spirit in dissolution
To the great unknown

My mind is ripe, my soul is ready
Standing at the edge of the abyss
I stare into the deep
I shall not fear!!

I shall not!!
