I shall not serve, I shall not praise
That in which I no longer believe

No fatherland, no home and no church
Shall bound my true self nor dictate who I am

I won't compromise nor settle down
My inner voice has never screamed this loud

No more right or wrong
Now I'm free to speak my heart out

No more ends to serve, no more artificial disciplines
No more tyranny upon me...

Turn inwards and see
Follow the thread and find the truth of your being
Time to escape the maze
The clues are there; my craft will set you free
I am Dedalus

I fly above the hostile waves of life
Moving as I will I manifest
The ancient ways

I shall not serve, I shall not praise
That in which I no longer believe

No more ends to serve nor right or wrong
No more artificial disciplines
No more tyranny upon me

Fly above the sea
Spread your wings and find the artist within
Time to reconnect
The source is there, the timeless vision awaits
I am Dedalus
I found the tune of the everlasting song
Wholeness, harmony and radiance
Dwell within my soul

Out of this prison
The time to slay the tyrant inside has come
The gates of perception are cleansed
To transcendent horizons I shall now flee!

I am the seer guiding the way
Out of desire, social duties and fear

I am the maverick holding the key
To unlock the door to the wonder beyond

Open yourself to what lies out of sight
Turn to the center, to the still point

Don't turn away

Turn inwards and see
Follow the thread and find the truth of your being
Time to reconnect
The source is there, the timeless vision awaits
I am Dedalus
I found the tune of the everlasting song
Moving as I will I manifest
The ancient ways

I, saint and demon
I do not strive for dark nor light no more
Can't deny what I've become
Nomad at heart forever more...
