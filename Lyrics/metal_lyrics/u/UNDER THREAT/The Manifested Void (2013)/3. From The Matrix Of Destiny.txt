Venus-mother!
You are the virgin morning star
Demoness!
You remove this veil of maya

Cosmic mother!
You create, preserve, and destroy
Mighty Kali!
Swallowing us back into the dark void

Thou art the living fount of hope
You clear up the skies and bring the storms
Thou art the peace of paradise
You dwell within the sanctuary of my heart

Lady of my abundance
My life and death depend on you
Universal goddess
Only the One can see you in true form
Oh great Ishtar
Precipitator of my destiny
Born of the divine Creatrix

I am

From the matrix of destiny
I've been born to play my cosmic role
To the matrix of destiny
World redeemer shall return

Ilmatar!
In thy womb the unborn hero
Water Mother!
Shaper of all that we see

Nourisher!
You are the life of everything that lives
Womb and tomb
You are the death of everything that dies

Back into the cosmic mother-sea
Oh number nine!
All shall emanate and then dissolve
Again and again...
