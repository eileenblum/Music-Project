Out of the timeless void
The unfathomable reach beyond manifests
Bringing forth the frame of the visible world;
...The breaking of formlessness into form

Out of the void
The cosmogonic round begins
From uncreated endless dark
...Beginning in the end

Out of the timelessness	
Into which everything dissolves
Silence of the unknown emerges
Translated into shapes
Forever present, Imperishable

Out of the sea of night
Into which everyone descends
Living being and living cosmos
Come back renewed
Aeon after aeon endlessly around
