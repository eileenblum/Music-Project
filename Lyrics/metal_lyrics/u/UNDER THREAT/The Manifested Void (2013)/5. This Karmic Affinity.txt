There has to be life to ensure death
There has to be death to ensure life

It's the ultimate paradox

There has to be light to ensure dark
There has to be right to ensure wrong

Only in contrasts we live

Silence of the unknown
Shines through every form
Eye of Prajna, show me the way
To the cosmic door!

Wisdom of the void
Break all this chains of conventional thought!
Shatter all these notions of self
(Once and for all)

We need our beliefs and concepts
To fulfill the idea of ourselves

We fail to see past the symbols

We need our plans for tomorrow
And a past to look proudly back on

To build up whom we are today

Want it now!
I have strived enough
When will I finally arrive at my goal?

What's the point? Whereâs the end?
Cannot wait no more
Need to reach success
No matter the cost

I need more
Cannot have enough
I must make you mine, must have control over all

I deserve, I demand
Life is way too short
What have I done wrong?

I cannot seem to escape this recurrent sorrow
This futile grasping for what cannot be reached

I cannot deal with all the sadness and horror
This tragic wheel of birth and death
This karmic affinity

There must be a reason why we are here, why we're alive
Or is it all a problem of semantics?
Are we all stuck on metaphors?
