Nothing in life could have ever prepared me for this
The thin ice I was walking on cracked right under my feet
The familiar ground on which I used to base my whole being
Is far behind now and all i see is a vast ocean ahead

Several thousand miles away
I left a whole life far behind
Now I'm shedding my skin to get through
The threshold where the past must die

From the belly of the whale
I must break out to be born again
I have to head for the unknown path

The grandest ordeal 

Everything changes, the past feels like it was a dream

Reality, time and all that which we love to control
The illusion then suddenly fades, the big picture I see
But still I am trapped in this tormenting deceiving self

Haunted by the memories, a prison in my head
The power to let go seems to grow weaker day by day

I have no choice but to turn to the demons inside
A long inward journey awaits and there's no turning back
I might not survive the dark forest of my shattered soul
But this is the path I must take right here in front of me.
