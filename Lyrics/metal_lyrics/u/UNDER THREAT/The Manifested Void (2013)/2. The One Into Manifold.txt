From the manifested void
Emanations of a new born cosmos coming forth
The play begins, the dance of space and time
Unfolding chaos, genesis of life.

Eyes of the demiurge opening wide
Awareness of the self distorting unity
Multiplicity of forms in growing expansion
Self dismemberment of Atman has begun 

...And the One broke into manifold
   Illusion of duality began
   Perspective shifted from the central cause
   And so the One broke into many forms...

Male and female brought about
In God's own image
Paradox of dual focus, beginning of the fall

From the manifested Void
The emanating presence willingly yielded its flesh
Into a harmony of forms, poured into being
The inevitable began

We are He and He is us
What he became live in all
Undivided He remains in us

We're characters
In a divine cosmic play
We are Vishnuâs dream, One in manifold 

Divided in play, undivided in reality
We come into form to always dissolve back into him

From the other side of the veil, the created field we behold...
