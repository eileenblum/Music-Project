Dissolution of the illusion
Magnificent destruction
Temporality and duality disintegrated at the bottom
Of the abyss

"Namu amida butsu"

The transcendent God was my mirror
Now I am my own mirror
This God and I have vanished
Back into the bliss of Eden
In selflessness

I, you and I are the cold mist of dawn, and a drop in the sea,
Wherever you may turn, is a reflection you see

Nothing left to say "I" just disappeared, 
We are all but cosmic dust transformed into beings

I, you and I are the cold mist of dawn, and a drop in the sea,
Wherever you may turn, is a reflection you see
I, you and I are the roar of the wind and the night thunderstorm, wherever you may stand, right at the centre you are
Nothing left to say "I" just disappeared, every moment that you live is all that there is
