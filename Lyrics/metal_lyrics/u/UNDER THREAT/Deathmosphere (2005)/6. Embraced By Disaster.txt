[Lyrics: D. Bermudez]

Running blind through the maze,
Searching for the light
Looking for a made up self salvation
Guided by the certainty of the ignorant

Slowly sinking in the sands of misery,
Devastating awareness of his own destiny
Consumed in every attempt,
Blinded by faith

The last moment is coming
I can feel the death rattle closer, the silent choking extermination,
I'm being embraced by disaster
The tragic ending of a poisoned soul.

Consciousness of guilt,
The bleeding wound of a broken promise,
Downcast by the infamy, drowned by injustice
Diminished by hope, condemned to witness his own demise.

Slowly sinking in the sands of misery

Suffocating ecstasy of despair
The tragic ending of a poisoned soul

The last moment is coming
I can feel the death rattle closer,
The silent choking extermination,
I'm being embraced by disaster
The tragic ending of a poisoned soul.

Slowly sinking in the sands of misery,
Devastating awareness of his own destiny
Consumed in every attempt,
Embraced by disaster
