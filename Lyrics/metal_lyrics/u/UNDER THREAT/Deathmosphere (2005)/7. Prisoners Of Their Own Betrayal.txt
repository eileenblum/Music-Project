[Lyrics: D. Bermudez]

They rise with the edge of the sun,
To live a life that's not theirs,
Running against father time,
Only to see him die
Their souls they burn in the flames of conformity

In emptiness they smile with grin of the failed,
Just not to cry the tears of decay
In secret they share the joy for their demise,
Knowing no better, slowly they die
Prisoners of their own betrayal

A dream of victory they dreamed once,
But now they run not remembering why
Meaningless and tired they look away
Wondering, maybe, where they lost their way

Aged eyes, now look forward to what never will be
Soar hands, pain reminding past pain
Burned mind, never to understand
Lost soul, in failure they die

Prisoners of their own betrayal

A dream of victory they dreamed once,
But now they run not remembering why
Meaningless and tired they look away
Wondering, maybe, where they lost their way

Prisoners where they lost their way
