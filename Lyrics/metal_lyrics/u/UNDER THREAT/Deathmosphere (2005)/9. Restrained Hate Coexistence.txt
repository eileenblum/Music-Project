[Lyrics: D. Bermudez]

Every time I look at you
All I see is the decaying of your revolting kind
So superficial, almost artificial,
The obviousness of the truth you cannot see
You rather make up all your enemies.
You seem to have every thing you wanted
Except for what you always needed

I will be there watching you
I will be there watching you falling
I will be there seeing you
I will be there seeing you rotting

The judge of judges, enforcer of justice
Don't even know the limit of your truth
Unable to understand, you rather destroy
Unable to create, you rather consume

Ignorance is your bliss, envy is your disease
Criticizing is your only ability!

I will be watching you meeting
Watching you meeting your demise
And still you will be wondering
And still you will be wondering why

Every time I look at you
All I see is the decaying of your revolting kind
So superficial, almost artificial,
The obviousness of the truth you cannot see
You rather make up all your enemies.
You seem to have every thing you wanted
Except for what you always needed
