[Lyrics: N. Bermudez]

Disgrace in infinite forms
Suffocating condition of impotence
Every personal exit door from hell is locked

Desperate thoughts unable to find
The way out through the gates of understanding
Missing pieces, the disgrace of every single ignorant structure
Unexchangeable individual temples
Of relentless frustration

Lifetime prison inferno
In a multidimensional era of hollow intentions
Unmeasurable degrees of sorrow profundity
Uncalculable levels of emotional devastation

Equidistant from pain
Till the fatal end dying on parallel hells

Desperate thoughts unable to find
The way out through the gates of understanding
Missing pieces, the disgrace of every single ignorant structure
Unexchangeable individual temples
Of relentless frustration

Equidistant from pain
Till the fatal end dying on parallel hells

Disgrace in infinite forms
Suffocating condition of impotence
Every personal exit door from hell is locked
