Abstraction I'm facing
Misleading I'm living
So complex, yet so shallow
So righteous, yet so hollow

Existential illiteracy
Alienation supremacy
Simplicity proliferation
Implicit, yet invisible
Interactional equations

To arise
From the swamps of subjectivity
And get rid of the inculcated inferiority
Read the codes
Written in the book of experience

To awake from the ignorant's sleep
And get off the highway to frustration
Read the codes
Written in the language of the observer
