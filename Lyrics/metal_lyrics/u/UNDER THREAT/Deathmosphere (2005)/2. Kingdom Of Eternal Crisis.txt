[Lyrics: J. Perez]

Crossing through deception the worst level of agony
Swimming in the deepest sands of depression
Reflecting the pain in their eyes

Can't you find your way out of your weakness?
Can't you find the source of your destructive force?
There is no time, cast the sickness out of your being,
Run away, before they find you

Complex inconsistence in your mind
A therapy of punishment is what you deserve
The memories of your past will take control
For the rest of your life

One by one they will be drifted away
One by one they will disappear
One by one they will sink forever
In the sands of eternity

One by one they will be drifted away
One by one they will disappear

Can't you find your way out of your weakness?
Can't you find the source of your destructive force?
There is no time, cast the sickness out of your being,
Run away, before they find you

Walking in circles with empty hands,
Buried in the abyss of impotence
Crowning your world to live at the
Enslaving kingdom of eternal crisis
