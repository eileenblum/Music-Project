[lyrics: D.Bermudez]

Disorder instigation
Social disease
War is untying before the inminent
civilization's end,
Distorted thoughts
murder counsciousness.

Elemental instincts emerge as low
Survival replaces understanding
And death rises as a worship icon
Now virtue is a corpse in decomposition.

Social involution, lost of reason
Force prevails over intelligence
Impelling the inevitable
return to the animal instinct
While ideologies evaporate
In the massacre's warmth.

Excited multitudes
crawl to the vortex
Their elemental passion is to kill.
Their appetite and voraciousness
devours hope
There's no other way
by their self destruction

Social involution, lost of reason
Force prevails over intelligence
Impelling the inevitable return 
to the animal instinct...

The inexorable destruction
marks life extermination

Consumatumm est.
