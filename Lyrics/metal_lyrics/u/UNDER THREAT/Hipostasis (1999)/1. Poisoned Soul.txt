[lyrics: J.Perez]

Deepest wounds rest in the
destruction of a pain
that still lives and hurts.
Damned wounds openned by
a situation and a lost moment
leaving eternal traces

Negative consequences creates
confuse situations,
opressing the weak minds
of those who change their lives

Adversed experiences obtained
that carried us to uncontrol
Poisoning the soul
for believing in something.

Insatiable repressed desires,
limited roads of ideas,
ignoring possible solutions
limiting us to the established

creating inconsistence
killing the tomorrow
closing the eyes
we see that it doesn't matter anymore

Damned wounds that left eternal traces
poisoned soul

Adversed experiences obtained
that carried to uncontrol
Poisoning the soul 
for believing in something.
