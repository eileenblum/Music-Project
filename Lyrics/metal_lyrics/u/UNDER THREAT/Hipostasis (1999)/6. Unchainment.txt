[lyrics: N.bermudez]

I have been rescued by understanding
It got me out of an invisible prison
Out of the cemetery of rout
off the blindness universe

Lifeless minds murdered by failure
Bodies hanged by chains of resignation

I'm escaping through 
the tunnel of knowledge
So although it seems to never to end
It is the only exit
to the paradise of comprehension.

Unchainment
Ihave been released from
the false ideas temple
I have been released from
the mediocrity temple
from the learned helplessness temple

My wounds slowly will heal
the scars from the chains will erase
A battle inside I will win
Then new lands I will conquer.
