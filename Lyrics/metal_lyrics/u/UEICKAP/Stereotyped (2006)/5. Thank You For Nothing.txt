[music by Ueickap, words by I.F.]

It
To find a face behind
Dressing up my life
I
There
Nothing left to tell you about me
And my sad story

All of my life I
All of my lies have been taken as natural

I think when I was a child
My father always told me
When I was a little child
Playing with my life
Knowing that my friends where different from me
And my sad truth

All of my life I
All of my lies have been taken as natural
All of my life I
All of my cries have been wasted for something wrong

Watching through my window
I see the life outside
Standing as the wind blows
I think about me

All of my lies have been taken as natural
All of my life I
All of my cries have been wasted for something wrong
