[music by Ueickap, words by I.F.]

I, I can
I cannot change in that desire
Now I am diving in my tears
I cannot give you

Can
Can I bleed you?
You can
And notwithstanding my sacrifice

Your date is over
Come back to your staidness
Your empty words resound inside my head

Hi, this is my hand this is my heart
You must believe in honesty
I cannot put my eyes on you
I cannot stop this running

Can
Can I bleed you?
You can
And notwithstanding my sacrifice

Your date is over
Come back to your staidness
Your empty words resound inside my head

Leave your side, its time to take a chance and
Know your mind, if you want to make it
Cross your town if you want to see there
Be yourself if you want to change

Feel you, need no reason
Dream your hero within yourself, and I
Hero within yourself, and I
Yourself and I
Yourself and I

Your date is over
Come back to your staidness
Your empty words resound inside my head
Your date is over
Come back to your staidness
This endless war
It
