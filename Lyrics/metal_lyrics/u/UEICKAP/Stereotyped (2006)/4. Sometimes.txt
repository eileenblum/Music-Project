[music by Ueickap, words by G.M. &amp; I.F.]

All is cold between my fingers
Just remains of my dead past
I sense memories that linger
But i know they won

I
Upside down for a while
Now I
When everything around dies

I
Always in mind
I
Always so fine

Sometimes I wish for my world
To fall down shattered from the sky
Sometimes I wait for my soul
To vanish in the night

All my undecided faith
All my delicate balance
Have been troubled by your stupid sentence
Your fucking sentence

I
Always in mind
I
Always so fine

Sometimes I wish for my world
To fall down shattered from the sky
Sometimes I wait for my soul
To vanish in the night
Sometimes I pray for some God
To come and shine light on my soul
Sometimes I have to stay here
But I just want to go

Last time I looked into your world
The same time I listened to your words
My mind got lost under the stars
So high

Sometimes I wish for my world
To fall down shattered from the sky
Sometimes I wait for my soul
To vanish in the night
Sometimes I pray for some God
To come and shine light on my soul
Sometimes I have to stay here
But I just want to go
