[music by Ueickap, words by I.F.]

Can you hear the different sound of your words
It seems like a preach, they want my respect
Carry your double face out of the room
Your time has just finished, mine

You know I
You know what
It smells like a beautiful thought in my head
You know I
You know where
Now keep your position
And just let me live my life

Watching the truth coming mixed with your lies
Remember my honesty will take it out
I see the difference between our skins

You know I
You know what
It smells like a beautiful thought in my head
You know I

Take by your noiselessness
Leave me to fill in the blanks
Take me by your noiselessness
Save your breath I

I can
I feel you crying
I won

Take by your noiselessness (take my hand now)
Leave me to fill in the blanks
Take me by your noiselessness
Save your breath I

Know I
Trouble in my heart
I see you, I see the dark
I want to give you your last breath
