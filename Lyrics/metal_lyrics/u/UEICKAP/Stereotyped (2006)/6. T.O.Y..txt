[music by Ueickap, words by G.M.]

Listen to me
Slow down for a moment and set your mind free
It
And open your eyes to the truth deep within
Did you ever realize that
We
Those walls are trapping us inside

False messiahs speak their truth
Selling cheap dreams they tell you what to believe to
With their voices, silky and smooth
Producing hysteria now they own you

Stop praying me
I
It
They smashed you, they thrashed you
They silenced your screams
Revenge is the answer
You
No broken promises you

False messiahs speak their truth
Selling cheap dreams they tell you what to believe to
With their voices, silky and smooth
Producing hysteria now they own you
Always trying to keep you down
Enjoying your pain they gain and you lose
Be yourself before it
You

Just a freak show
Running too slow
I
All time wasted
(wake up!)

Just a freak show
Running too slow
I
It

I
My mind

False messiahs speak their truth
Selling cheap dreams they tell you what to believe to
With their voices, silky and smooth
Producing hysteria now they own you
Always trying to keep you down
Enjoying your pain they gain and you lose
Be yourself before it
You

False messiahs
Believe only in what you choose

Just a freak show
Running too slow
I
Nothing
