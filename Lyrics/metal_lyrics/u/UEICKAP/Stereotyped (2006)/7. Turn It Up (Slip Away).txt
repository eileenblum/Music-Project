[music by Ueickap, words by G.M., I.F. &amp; D.S.]

You have to face this now
Will you choose to let it out and show me what you are
You always turn things down
And always try to explain your truth with a single line

This time I know the things you
This time I

You have two faces now
Will you choose a better one to show me what you are
I
And as always, i have to find another way to stay fine

This time I know the things you
This time I

Turn it up, and I
Turn it up, and I
Turn it up, and I
You

If I can tell (the) truth from (the) lies
The answer
I can
In your nothingness

I

This time I know the things you
This time I

Turn it up, and I
Turn it up, and I
Turn it up, and I
You
Turn it up, and I
Turn it up, and I
Turn it up, and I
You
And I
