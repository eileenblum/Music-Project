[music by Ueickap, words by G.M. &amp; I.F.]

I don
I don
And I
I

Think? Well I don
My time has come

A whole new life is waiting in the world outside
Turned my heart to stone well I

I won
I won
I won
And I

Think? Well I don
My time has come

A whole new life is waiting in the world outside
Turned my heart to stone, well I
Stopping my slow falling down, as I bleed I make no sound
I am here, I stand my ground, while you

It takes time
It

A whole new life is waiting in the world outside
Looking for my soul, well I
Stopping my slow falling down, as I bleed I make no sound
I am here, I stand my ground, while you

Looking for my soul, well I am willing to be sacrificed
I am here, I stand my ground, while you

I
