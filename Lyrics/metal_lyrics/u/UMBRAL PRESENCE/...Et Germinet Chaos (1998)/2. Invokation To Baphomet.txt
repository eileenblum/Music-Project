"We stand armed and dangerous
before the bloody fields of history.
Devoid of dogma but ready to carve,
to defy the trancient.
Ready to stab forth
with our penetrative will.
Strain every leash, run yellung
down the mountainside of man.
Ready and willing
to immolate world upon world
with our stunning blaze.
And let them all sing
that we were here as masters
among the failing speciens called man.
Our being took form in defiance
to stand before your killing gaze.
And now we travel from flame to flame,
and tower from the Will to the Glory!!!"
