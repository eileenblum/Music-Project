"Agios o Satanas"

"To you, Prince of Darkness and Lord of the Earth
I dedicate this Temple:
Let it become, like my body,
a vessel for your power
and an expression of your glory!"

"With this salt I seal the power of Dark Gods in!"

"With this earth I dedicate my Temple"

"Satanas - venire! Satanas - venire!
Agios o Baphomet!
I am God imbued with your glory!"

"With my blood I dedicate the Temple of my life!"

"I am here to begin my sinister quest.
Prince of Darkness, hear my oath!
Baphomet, Mistress of Earth, hear me!
Hear me, you Dark Gods waiting beyond the Abyss!"

"May your power mingle with mine,
As my blood now mingles with fire!"

"With this drink I seal my oath.
I am yours and shall do works
to the glory of your name!"
