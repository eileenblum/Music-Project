The whispering wind
Deep in the woods
Covered with pearly carpet
The diamond high above
The darkened trees
Yet lit by moonlight

Depths of mind unfold
Revealing lore of ancient words
Wisdom, dark enlightened
Elders' knowledge

"The moon wraps itself
Around Savage God
Impaled on the throne
As the wheel of skulls turns
The Jewelled Lady, the crone
Winter in the wildest of woods"

The whispering dusk
Silver light
Caressing ghostly forest
The diamond above the trees
Mesmerizes slowly fading mind
