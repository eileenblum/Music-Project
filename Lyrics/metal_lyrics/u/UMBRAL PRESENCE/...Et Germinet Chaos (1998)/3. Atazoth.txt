"The depths of the sea, a tunnel of knives
There's a union here while he directs
The chosen rage in the eye of the goat
The golden triangle stands against the sky of fire"

"Come as a reaper for thus you will sow"
No lambs shall live as new Aeon rises
"Blessed are the strong for they shall possess the earth"
And cursed are the weak
"Respect not pity or weakness for they are disease
Which make sick the strong"

New moon with Saturn rising
Forsaken hill-top, the open sky
Priest and Priestess naked
The shining crystal, the invokation starts
"Nythra, Kthunae, Atazoth
Binan Ath, Ga Wath Am"

Dark nebulous chaos
A rend in the fabric of star-studded space
Changes into the dragon - Atazoth has come
The union is over, the star gate is open
"Aperiatur Terra, et germinet CHAOS!!!"
