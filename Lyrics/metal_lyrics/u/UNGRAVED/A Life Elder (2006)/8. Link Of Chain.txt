[Music by Fucker]
[Lyrics by Angel]

Sun will rise for tomorrow's battle
And now I sit near stormy river
I hear sound of quiet flute
My life become dearer...

My soul, forget your fear!
The War - is our life.
My future drown in stream
This thoughts are like a knife

One - is more than you think,
No mercy, if you fall
My blade, save my force -
Hatred to my foe's
War-cry, I hear him in dreams
Take leave of sky.
It's not sentence, it's a call,
Your resistance is a trap.

[CHORUS 1:]
I brace your fetters
And my blade is own revenge
You lost control. Can you live with
Wild wish to kill!!!!...
Wish to kill!!!...

[CHORUS 2:]
Burn to ashes own fear
(It's a) Link of infinite chain.

[REPEAT CHORUS 1]
