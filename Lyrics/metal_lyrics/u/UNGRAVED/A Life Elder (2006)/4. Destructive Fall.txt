[Music and lyrics by Fucker]

I hear heart-rending screaming
Instead of moonlight charm
Crust of pain
Buried in my flesh

Chasing my thoughts by my friends
Jar upon myself
Clank of withered pity
Clink like brazen grave-bell

[CHORUS:]
So I...
Bleeding, smashing, crashing,
-"You hear me?"
-"No, my mercy,
I fucked!
Destructive fall...

[POSTCHORUS:]
...I keep your dawn...
Forever keep done.."

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[REPEAT POSTCHORUS]
