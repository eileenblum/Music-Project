[Music by Fucker]
[Lyrics by Angel and Lutiy]

I feel force of strong wind
And soak up each spark of fire,
I Charm full bright moon
And see a power of thunder

[CHORUS:]
There are a lot of worms around
They are blind and defenceless
Worms crawl to your life
And monotony will set in your mind
Can you break it out?
Break worms' stereotypes!
Why do you stand aside?

I see a poison of identical worms
The poison are they Gods
Bible is your obituary!
Irony of hate! It's your cemetery!

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[POSTCHORUS:]
Worms are under our legs
Slowly rot from birth to the death
You don't deserve to live
If you're one of them.
