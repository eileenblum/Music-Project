[Music by Fucker]
[Lyrics by Lutiy]

Black blood in my veins
Dark mind is in my brains
Wolf's howl I hear in my soul
Death doesn't kill me 'cause
I'm a ghoul

[CHORUS:]
I don't feel sorry
'Cause you are lying,
But don't have a worry -
You'll be next, who die.

You can hear me every night
Step by step I turn off the light
I see, your blood is liking fast
And now your soul turn's back to dust.

[REPEAT CHORUS]
