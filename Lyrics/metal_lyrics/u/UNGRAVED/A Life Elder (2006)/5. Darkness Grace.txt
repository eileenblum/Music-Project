[Music by Fucker]
[Lyrics by Angel]

This place never saw sunlight
'cause ebony trees are grand.
Dreadful roots digging up all ground,
Fragrance of Death is always near.

[CHORUS:]
A Forest of hundred ages,
It's shelter for lonely spirits.
A place of thousand lives,
It's chasm for stars.

Each stone is more alive than you -
You sleep in melancholic dream.
Your time is out. Wake up!
You can be free. It's Darkness grace.
Disappear in the Water of Oblivion
It's enviable prize
All who die here have forgotten
Rely on Darkness grace.

[CHORUS:]
Revive your dark
Necklace of your sins
Hurl your curse,
Blaze away!
Guzzle my thoughts
And you never be lonely
Like this dying souls,
You are Gadfly.
