[Music by Fucker]
[Lyrics by Angel and Lutiy]

Devastation will be last
For each of us and for all,
Grow from darkness
To make universal evil
Humanity lost his sight,
Lost of memories, lost of consistency
They send damnations to themselves
And with is vicious circle

[CHORUS 1:]
Downfall of the age,
Satanity, brutality, insanity's domination...
On the decline
Occultly, vitiately, decadence...

The fewer is the best sign of approval
Will remain only dust &amp; spiritual cage
Unnoticed closed of unpardonable sin
That called people life

[CHORUS 2:]
Resurrection is complete.
Satanity, brutality, insanity forever...
Contemplate version
It's too hot &amp; only war in this world.

[REPEAT CHORUS 1]

[REPEAT CHORUS 2]
