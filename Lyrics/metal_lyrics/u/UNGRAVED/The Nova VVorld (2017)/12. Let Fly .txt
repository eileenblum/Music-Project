Daylight turns into darkness.
Trunks lost its rigid form.
To years grown time's naturalness.
Dreams left the 'public-dorm'.

Death as reliable way to be saved
Speaks a numbers, (and) we'll becomes ungraved.

Strong diction changes to liquids.
Black letters take live breath.
Brain lights from some of wick-feeds
Plunged into emptiness.

Death as reliable way to be saved
Speaks a numbers, (and) we're became ungraved.

Wishes won. Circus was forgot. Prudence is gone. Senses a lot.
Of beauty words is not enough to realize imagine cloth.
Let take one's last sleep for thoughts emotions to evolution, perpetual motions.
Forget all questions "for whom and why?",
By inspiration wings, for ever, let fly!
