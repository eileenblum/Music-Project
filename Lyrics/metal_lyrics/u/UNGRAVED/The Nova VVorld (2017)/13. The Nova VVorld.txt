Steps towards other side to forget this pain, yeah!
Come over worn-out life for the wonder and beauties.
Let bygones be bygones, ruin this, destroy!
New senses, new fortune, this is yours, enjoy!

And looking for the nova that is named 'The Sun'.
The era of your dreams, sweet and unreal, begun.

All your passions are pointed to master of
This huge and varied world!
