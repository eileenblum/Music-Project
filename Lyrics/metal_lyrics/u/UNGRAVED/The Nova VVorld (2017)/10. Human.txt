Frighten by first inspiration
Dazzled by natural light
Crying self-heart out of passions
Compel its father to smile

Eyes closed to world's imperfects
Perfect was one life before
Mindset has to make a verdicts
To beget prodigy lores.

Individuality rove
Bring to the longed-for crop.
Since by birth made concrete ones to laugh,
Make by death vast mass to sob.

Individuality rove
Bring to the longed-for crop.
Since by birth made concrete ones to laugh,
Make by death vast mass to sob.
Make by death vast mass to sob!
Make by death vast mass to sob!
