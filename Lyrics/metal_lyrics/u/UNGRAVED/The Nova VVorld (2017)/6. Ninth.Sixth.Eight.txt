Lo and behold something obscure I get,
Some pieces unified.
In the likeness of cord indispensable set
To make chance for something find.

Third, fourth, eighth to first I'm back.
Poor choices still host. I'm looks black!

Lo and behold everything passing shape
This nothing is my mad.
It's seems total-lot, I can't make mistake.
Matchstick pulls at random state.

Ninth, sixth, eighth to first I'm back.
Poor choices still host. I'm looks black!
