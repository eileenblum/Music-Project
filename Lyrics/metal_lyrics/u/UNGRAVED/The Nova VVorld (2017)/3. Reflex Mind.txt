Underground day in and day out
Open mind for mental aughts.
Appreciate a quantity of views
At lower point than absurd fews.

...Every grave says broke by morbid says...

Follow the feat to another feat!
Learning the milieu philosophy.
Image obsession like the fobic kind,
All this ones reside in the reflex mind.

Life devoted for theory
No else left, no fantasy.
Heart's rhythmics is harmony without,
Going mad day in and day out.

...Every grave says still broke by fuckin' says...

Follow the feat to another feat!
Learning the milieu philosophy.
Image obsession like the fobic kind,
All this ones reside in the reflex mind.
