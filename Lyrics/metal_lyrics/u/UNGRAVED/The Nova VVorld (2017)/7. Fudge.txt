I force your cold store case.
For my friend I lead finding.
I looks at your toe label
You have a pretty name!
We looks like in our life ends,
But your death is few older.
It's pity what you silent...
Therefore you has to listen my fudge.

No matter in you deaf, my free-will hanging judge.
Stare out of it all, entirely my fudge.

No matter in you deaf, my free-will hanging judge.
Stare out of it all, entirely my fudge.

For tunes, impression-wein cup I drink little by little.
For you inspiration be dumb, I walk up to the torch.
This art is never forget. More beauty more lifetime.
Greatness be always observed. Set feat to get its prime.
