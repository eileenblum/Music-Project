Indifferent mood took away comprehension
Of what among the material percept
The mere boredom give birth for vivid impression
For novel things, for new concept

The beautiful and strange sounds and voices I'm hear
The unknown universe
They're brought to this.... I'm fear

First touch. The black long era:
Reason, remains, hard memories
Next touch. The white some instants:
Pleasure, fortune, the moments

Like telling a story, creates new history
A canvas space filling up with damped strokes
Infatuated with aesthetization, Father
Gave final thoughtless touches to concocted works

The terrible and frightful visions I'm dream
The taunting horror and chaos creeping me I'm scream!

New touch. The pain flesh aches:
Scars, blood, bleed veins, asthmatic fits
Last touch. In tears hard senses:
Envy, hatred, hurts, loneliness
