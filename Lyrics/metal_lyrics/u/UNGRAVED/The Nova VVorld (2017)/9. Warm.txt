In search of main answers from corner to corner
Carrying back dreams called up by mistakes
It torments white quiet while it's growing to mourner
Of wasted wise tears for unreasonableness.

One shoot for shame and for mind chance second.

When hatred bowl is blood-poured.
When razor's points come dulled.
Scared tongue give worst right...
And warm pierce the heart by gride...
