Live so much long - zest for life.
As already old, not in least rife.
Its pitifully, stupidly
To take end on, thoughtlessly.

Carry out all dreams, everything read about,
Secrets kept by book, not depraved.

Rather ware, gusty way, from onset to decay.
On and off, suddenly, skinned over scars stands bleed.

Live so much long - zest for life.
As already old, not in least rife.
Its pitifully, stupidly
To take end on, thoughtlessly.
