Stuck in a daze
Stuck once again
Itâs been days since I felt a thing
Nothing to prove or to claim
Nothing has changed, I am still the same
For every bridge that Iâve burned
And every lesson I didnât learn
Lost reason, lost control
Of who I am and what Iâll become
Fogbound inside my mind
And I canât see through the clouds
Sleepless nights and tired days
Feeling life slipping away while trying to stay awake
No peace
No peace - within me or within reach
