To carry the weight of this hopeless mind
Is like trying to hold up the sky
Keep telling myself the same old lie
That I only bide my time
While all I'm doing is pine away
And the single change is that I'm losing friends
Stuck in a desolate dead end
Before my life has hardly begun
Procrastinating my life away
There's nothing else but me to blame
Slowly wither on my own
Until my skin fits my torn soul
In a life as grey as the sky above
I'm heading down a blackened road
Carry on alone
But have never known and will never know how
Twenty-four hours of night
As I repeat my ways
Twenty-four hours of night
As life repeats itself
Clouds
