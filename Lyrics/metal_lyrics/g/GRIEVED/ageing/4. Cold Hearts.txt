A crouching mass at the feet of a few
Deluded to think that they care about you
Lights put out and lives put out
Cold hearts - no guilt, no doubt
Deceitful snakes
Carriers of lies and plague
A crouching mass at the feet of a few
Deluded to think that they care about you
Lights put out, lives put out
Cold hearts, no guilt, no doubt
Lies infecting weak minds
And controlling weak souls
Humanity â Earthâs poisoned seed
Fucked and deceived
They wonât understand
Until everything has died by the hand of man
