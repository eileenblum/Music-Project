Rising fright, falling skies
A burned out sun, a world covered in ice
Closing eyes, closing time
Facing the end of all human life
Among the ruins and the fallen dreams
I'm aware that there's nothing next
And to the sound of a million screams
I gather my last fucking breath
What the fuck?!
Discharge this world
From all that we are
As you've made your bed
So you must lie in it
And we've prepared us
For an eternal sleep
