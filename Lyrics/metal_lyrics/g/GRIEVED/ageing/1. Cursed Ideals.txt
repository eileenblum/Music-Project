In the darkest corner
In the center of defeat, among the despaired
I'm not even aware
Who or what I'm competing against
Or for what cause
In the claws of the ones without heart
We're shaped to fit in
Bred into coercion without free will
That's how it works
In the land of the cursed
The unquenchable thirst in the land of the cursed
Make a career
At any cost
And you'll get on top
At someone elses loss
And if you fail you haven't tried enough
'Cause in this world you have to make your own luck
There's no safety, there's no trust
So don't expect help if you're getting fucked
This is where future plans die young
I am one of the uncertain ones
