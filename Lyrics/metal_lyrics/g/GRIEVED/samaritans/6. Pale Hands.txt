She gets around the locks with her pale hands
Whispering things next to my bed
I can't help it but those celestial eyes
Are too fine to feel any fright
This night is only skin-deep
This night is everything else but real
The great relief when no reality remains

How could it take me so many years to percieve ?
That there's no reason to be scared
If I sleep, will you visit me again ?
I could kill for you to visit me again
Let's pretend this is only in my head
Let's pretend this is more than imaginings
