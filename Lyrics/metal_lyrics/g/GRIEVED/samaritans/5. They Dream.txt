Forced into faith
An enslaved, encased belief
But it was you
Who swallowed the lies, who swallowed the key
Daydream, daydream

Forced into faith
An enslaved, encased belief
But it was you
Who swallowed the lies, who swallowed the key
Daydream, daydream

Blessed by shackles, loyal to a shattered myth
