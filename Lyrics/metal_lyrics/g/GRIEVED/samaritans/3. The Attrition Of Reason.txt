There is no safe haven for the hellbound
We are a destined letdown, the disenchantment of it all
No second thoughts
No second thoughts

Forgotten values, regretted vows
The attrition of reason
We have lived but never learned
And our guilt is profound
You bought the sermon that everything leads to something more
But meaning was killed years ago.
Another conscience left to rot

This life long void, the endless cold
Is all we'll ever know
