Bottom reached for reaching hands
Where samaritans have resigned
Somewhere along the way, we've lost both substance and shape
Misspent days and long gone names
Somewhere along the way, we've lost both substance and shape
Misspent days and long gone names

Drowning in a sea of shame, drenched by our own disdain
Drowning in a sea of shame, drenched by our own disdain

Bottom reached for reaching hands when samaritans have failed
Without guidance, without faith, there are hollow wraiths that roam the streets
Day by day, reckless schemes
