These despondent thoughts has caused this town to give up
A life filled with nothing at all,
We were born within these walls
Flawed, flawed

Our bodies, our temples,
Our ruins has brought us nowhere but beyond
Has brought us nowhere but beyond

A climate that keeps breeding hopelessness
But nothing changes nonetheless, and when all else fails - point the blame
This is it - Stockholm blues,
Another day, another to get through
