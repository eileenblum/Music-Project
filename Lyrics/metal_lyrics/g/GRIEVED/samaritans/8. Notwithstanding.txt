Still spending time, fighting for temporary peace
To be able to get by and stay alive in this dead end town
Feeling lonesome when I'm with friends
And it makes me think that it's true
As they say, I'll never change, I'll never change
Feeling lonesome when I'm with friends
And it makes me think that it's true
As they say, I'll never change
I'll never change

Golden memories slowly fade as my mind only gets hurt by reliving them
I can't distinguish now from then
But everyday feels like the end
I've ruined it for myself again
And allowed this Hell to stay the same
Self-made self-contempt
