My heart is bleeding im fighting alone
darkness around me is getting cold
i saw the light in your eyes
i have chosen you to be my guide
and hope you hear what i say
you schould give me a last chance
i choose the way of love and pain
everything seems to call your name

Oh my queen oh my lord!
we'll win in this bloody war
total mayhem total death
if you don't feel it
you won't understand

Lend to me your wings i shall fly into the sky
in anger become the lighting bolt

I'am the one who wants to show you
your secret lies make it true for you
great army of swindlers is all i see
don't you cry so much it doesn't help
don't stick your head in the sand
blood runneth over for your sins
shut you mouth and listen prophecy

oh my queen oh my lord!...

Deafining silence reigns as twilight fill the sky
we'll makes this night a special one
