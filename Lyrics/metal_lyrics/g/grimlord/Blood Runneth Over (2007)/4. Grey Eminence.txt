You're the one who scares, bad people with the truth
In love and war there ain't no rules
my lady starlight, help me tonight
they tried to break me with your rules

violence, pain - love and hate
will my longing ever end?
violence, pain - love and hate
hear my voice, see my face

ooooo... If you leave me
now don't go away so far
ooooo... If you leave me
on broken wings, no flying hight

you must know by now, i won't let you down
If you feel real sad somtimes
grey eminence! save me please from the flames of hell
You'd take all my sorrow away

violence, pain - love and hate
will my longing ever end?
violence, pain - love and hate
hear my voice, see my face

ooooo... If you leave me
now don't go away so far
ooooo... If you leave me
on broken wings, no flying hight
