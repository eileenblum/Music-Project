Monotonous reality, like a stone crushes me
imprisoned under pressure I try to catch one's breath
blood boils in my head, and body sweats
there is not escape from here, lying there, on the bottom

i can't move myself.
there already isn't me.
someone tread me again,
this is all I gotta say

death got me in its clutches, the terrible grip strangles me
half-conscious I've hope, It will be successful exit from here
why do, I feel so rotten,let someone say, me at last
if my life has to, look so without the breath.

imprisoned I've still called,
let somebody draws me at last from here,
i've had enough it.
i've had enough it.
