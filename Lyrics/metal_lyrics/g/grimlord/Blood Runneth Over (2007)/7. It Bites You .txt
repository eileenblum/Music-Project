It bites You!!!
it bites You!!!
it bites You!!!

I'am the man that feeds off your pain
i'am your hell When you pray once again
you want some shit? I'll fuckin' pound you, son
many lies been told a thousand times

it hardens me - the things I see
you're gonna die groveling on your knees
so glad that you could be so blind
you wanna close, your eyes to hide
In constant remind I'm deep inside your mind

it bites you! sing with me
keep wallowing in your misery
sing with me! It's inside you!
you could learn a thing or two

i'm a steel tormentor I'm a child of the stars
you're a fucking shell that's dead in my eyes
ate you alive since you were a child
now come and watch me rise

and I'm never ever falling again,
For the tricks you play,
or the fronts you claim

you'll fear my strength if I'm backed into a cage,
i'm taking down what the fuck is ever in my way

this iron strength will never fall
do you feel around the falling sun?
so welcome to the world that I lived in
in front of me empty loser i see

It bites You!!!
It bites You!!!
It bites You!!!
