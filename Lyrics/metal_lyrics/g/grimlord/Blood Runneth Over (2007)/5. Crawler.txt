The sun is gone
i'd like to tell you something now
you're breathe of life surrounded me

can't this be a dream?
now you know how i feel
you've got to see what i means

oooooo
i try to stand it for a while
oooooo
just say it pay me after life

today i show you how i love you
and i don't care what you think
i show you darling how i love you
if i can't have then no one will

i feel so sad
tears were rollin' down your face
i remember what you said

you're my ecstasy
when can i join you to be free
i guess you'll know what i mean
