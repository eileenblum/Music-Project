Hello sorrows, guardians of our lives
in the streams of light faceless bodies, silent cries
today Mr. sorrows gives more pain
little meeting, face to face
i'm gonna make you a perfect day
there's just one way I see the way I think it's right for me

is there any place for us to live?... yes! no reason for despair

you pull me closer, I push you away.
invisible demon dancing 'round my brain
now he's got a grip, just downright mean and forever attacking
assailant from hell, piercing through my brain
each time I dream you're standing there
night after night! day by day! the same old game

is there any place for us to live?... yes! no reason for despair

why don't you leave me alone?
i'm at my best when I'm against the wall
why don't you leave me alone?
i'm much stronger now, so take me on

no surrender
no no no
no surrender no no no
no surrender
no surrender
no surrender
no endless pain will change me
!burn in hell!
