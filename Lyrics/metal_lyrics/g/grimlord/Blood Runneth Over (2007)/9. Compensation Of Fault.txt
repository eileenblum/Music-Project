Here you cheat and there you lie,what do you expect? don't be surprised
you cannot reach me now,no matter how you try
hunters won't get me 'cause I'm not fools
you tell me I will repent what I do
i realise there is no time

many things to make me sad
some can even drive me mad
i never thought Id be betrayed
by my best friend

what is a lie? what is the truth? hey i'm talkin' to you
don't you blame me! Don't you touch me!
I take what I need

here i stand alone again, I wanna love but I always hate
i'm standing back against the wall, my self i now must find once more
do you see now where I stand,
imagine i'm in heaven but it is a hell
can you feel what I see?
now you know how i feel

many things to make me sad
some can even drive me mad
i never thought Id be betrayed
by my best friend

what is a lie? what is the truth? hey i'm talkin' to you
don't you blame me! don't you touch me!
I take what I need
