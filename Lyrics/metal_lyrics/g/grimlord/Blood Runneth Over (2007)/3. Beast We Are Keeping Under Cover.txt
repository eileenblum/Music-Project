Take another deeper breath, take a deeper look and see
you won't believe 'till you know, that it's real... so real
time has come for her to rise, look inside and try and find
time has come for her to rise, better watch out, open eyes
open eyes..

B.W.A.K.U.C.... can you feel? can you see?
B.W.A.K.U.C.... she waits on it! she waits on it!

there's nothing left that you can do
and raise your ears because somebody search you
say your prayers till the beast she comes
or not 'cause dead men don't need it anymore

B.W.A.K.U.C.... can you feel? can you see?
B.W.A.K.U.C.... she waits on it.. she waits on it!

can you see the beast?!
can you see the beast?!
can you see the beast?!
can you feel her?
