Die sweet die! with your lie, Proud bitch! for the tears i cried
you are as cheap wine, each fellow can drink up you!
you keep on fuckin' till your dyin' day, Your all colour's slowly turning to grey
better look for a safe place where no one will find you

messin' around with every sucker in town
she's pretty tied up hangin upside down

why do you look at me when you, when you hate me?
you take my pride and in my eyes, You kinda rape me, inside
gonna make you pay for that great big hole in my heart
on with the action now, I'll strip your pride! In the name of fun

when I look into your eyes,
theirs nothing there to see,
nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me.
nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me.
die die honey! bye bye!
die die good bye!
