My wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
Fallen angels at my feet whispered ...voices at my ear
Death before my eyes stand next to me
She beckons me shall i give in 
I've got to open my eyes to everything

When the heads are going down
Don't turn out the light
Waking up is knowing who you ...really are

When the heads are going down
Don't close your eyes
Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away

I know that we cant wake, again from this dream
I tried to kill the pain but only brought more
Suddenly feelings learn to die
I don't need to touch the sky
Here in the darkness I know myself

When the heads are going down
Don't turn out the light
Waking up is knowing who you ...really are

When the heads are going down
Don't close your eyes
Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
