Shake with fear, The end is near
Their face at the window leers into your own
You are left alone with no helpin' hand beside you
Darkness and night your only friends
May hide you but also may be your grave
Run down to the demons you once dared to call

Death on the throne! [4x]

Oh what a fucking feeling!
you don't wanna die do you? But you will
Your fate is sealed, there's no place to run
Put a sword at your throat, another body on the pile
They crowd around your bed, Destruction is complete
Oh no no no! Destruction is complete auuu

Death on the throne! [4x]

You wake in fright there in your room
Utterly destitute and all
Long ago, you always brought their down
Kicked the weak around
But now tables turn and things have changed
And they're hunting you over your holy land
A lower form of life to them
so let's spell it out again

Death on the throne! [4x]
