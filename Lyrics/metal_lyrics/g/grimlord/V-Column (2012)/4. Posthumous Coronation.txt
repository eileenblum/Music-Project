Valued after death, mocked for lives
In vain intention aspiration
No sympathy no chance to return
Endless demeaning isn't cool
Some day you'll find a sanctuary
Our only hope's your victory
Full fucking anger that's what you breathe
Forget this life come with me
Come with me!!!

Forget this life come with me!!! BOOOM!

Posthumous coronation
This is your destination
Posthumous coronation
All goes in the right direction!

In your heart in your soul
great wrath to the core
you go through by immortal avenue

[Music and lyrics: La Picard]
