Who is your idol?
you obey?
Give me a one fucking reason!
Silent statues, silence cover truth
Lying colors, silent rain

Do you know what you're fighting for?
Did you make..
Did you make your choice?

It's a strategy for all
Telling people bed time tales

Mass delusions and Hysterias
Revelation, false creation
Scream it out..
Did you make your choice?

[Music and lyrics: La Picard]
