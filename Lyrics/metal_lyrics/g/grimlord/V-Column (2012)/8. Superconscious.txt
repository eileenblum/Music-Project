You never close your eyes
You never make a compromise
Because you walking om the edge

You never take the easy way
For any trouble that may cross your way
You were born just to play the hero's game

It must be superconscious mind

No time to waste no turning back
Honor is to win, honor is to play
No time to waste no turning back
I have to live it up before I die

Don't let it pull you down, Hold on tight
The chance you've got comes never twice

Cling to your dreams, think for yourself
you're on your way and win the game
Don't you depend on someone else

No time to waste, no turning back
Honor is to win,Honor is to play

No time to waste, No turning back
I have to live it up before i die
