Somewhere in shelter... sit the evils men and they don't realize that.....
deadly traps waiting... everywhere for them..

They all look so harmless but deep in their headquaters..
rebel is lurking and he will strike.....

Get him down to take the crown
but there is the destiny...you don't know

You are hero with one eye!
Man who tried to kill Antichrist!
Another chance!! Another strike!
Some pigs are still alive!

Get him down to take the crown
but there is the destiny...you don't know...

[Music and lyrics: La Picard]
