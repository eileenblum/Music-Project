They saw good future but traitors not!
National army protected her grounds

Poland ... Poland is our land! [2x]
Poland ... Poland is our land! [2x]

Zabili kapitana.. wiecej nie powiem

When the night will come... we must find the âss totenkopfâ
At dawn we move to east.. to greet the âbolshevicksâ

we are living in hell who's name is Poland
we won't give back piece of the ground
we won't let you rest after struggle
we will rape up you your bayonets

Poland ... Poland is our land!
Poland ... Poland is our land!

[Music and lyrics: La Picard]
