Planned treason for helping hand
bastard are waiting for fall from heaven
on the greatest fortress of English empire
Vipers prepare the biggest conspiracy

Alone against all! As an eagle among crows
Alone against all! doomed to collapse our last hope

Red Lion rubbed his hand
Dwarf with cigarettes turned his back
Convinced of the rightness.. they did carnage

traitors are waiting at the gate
last common supper with culprits
good bye to you immortal brave crew

secret of blind liberator
who knows where are the spectators
secret of blind liberator
we must wait still fifty years

[Music and lyrics: La Picard]
