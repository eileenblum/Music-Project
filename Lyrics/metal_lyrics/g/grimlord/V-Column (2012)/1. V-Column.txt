Today we are good neighbours, but it will change soon
willingly we drunk beers in your bar
and our wifes walked to the same barber

V-Column we will shatter your peace
V-Column it sad but real

We will shatter your peace... we'll poison wheels...
we'll blowing bridges up...
and we will deprive contacts of you..
Effectively we will distract your attention...
and we will distract your powers...
in short our role is damaging! I'm very sorry..

Fifth column... Fifth column....

[Music and lyrics: La Picard]
