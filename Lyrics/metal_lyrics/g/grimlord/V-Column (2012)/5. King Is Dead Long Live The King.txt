[Introduction:]
The Chains will be broken by all slaves on the earth
Your blood will flow down to the gates of hell
We're strong we're alive
We've faith in his might...

Hey! we arm for years!
Hey! we prepare to march out!
ready on all! ready to fight! we're right!
with pleasure I'll dress my armor torn after fights

pseudo ally..lies dead long ago!
Who's the master of them all? it's know
pseudo ally...lies dead long ago!
end to your lies and your law

For those to long to hear .. immortal melody
we arrive with the support when you lie on knees
For those to long to hear .. immortal melody
we arrive with the support when you lie on knees

King is dead long live the king...

[Music and lyrics: La Picard]
