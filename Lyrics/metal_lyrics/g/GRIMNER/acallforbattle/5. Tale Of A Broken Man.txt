Accused of a crime that he did not commit
The king to him said: "You are not one of us"
They called him a murderer, in exile he was cast
Sent out on his own, to become food for the wolves
And so he wandered alone

Many winter nights
He has slept under the stars
Darkness is his only friend
And frozen to his soul
Many winter moons
Hopelessness fills his heart
And his nights are filled with dreams
Of coming home again

Once he was a great warrior
A hero in everyone's eyes
But then he was framed
Dishonored and shamed
For taking the life
Of another villager
And so he was cast out in the winter cold

But then, after some years, he turned back to his home
Where his wife sat alone in the freezing night
That's what he thought, as he opened the door
And saw her, with his best friend and his son

He could not believe his eyes
They both stood paralyzed
And that's when he swore to leave forever

Many winter nights
He has slept under the stars
Darkness still his only friend
And frozen to his soul
His time is almost done
With crushed dreams in his heart
He has wandered to the edge
And fallen into the sea
