I have seen the cruelest of deaths
and I've died and come back to life
Slaying my enemies with no remorse
To hear their screams brings a smile to my face
With sword in hand, I fight without fear
Nothing weakens my heart
I hear the trampling of hooves on the ground
I stand prepared for war

Of death I am not afraid
To die in battle is my call
To be in the presence of the Allfather

As I see the light
Coming from the sky
The axes are cutting deep
Into flesh
My name will live on
I shall drink with the great in Valhall
But as long as there is a call for battle
I shall continue to be victorious

I stand here, on the battlefield,
thousands of foes in sight
Coming to fight us, to destroy our land
My people, my army, outnumbered
But as long as I am alive
Many of them will die
If they try to fight me back
They will walk into a nightmare

I'll slaughter them all
Put them to rest
Make them suffer a horrible fate
They will scream as I cut through their skin
And send them off to the kingdom of death

We're victorious today, once again
Against all odds we sent them to their deaths
But many wars are yet to be fought, so I rest
Until the day comes when my last battle-shout will sound

As I see the light
Coming from the sky
The axes are cutting deep
Into flesh
Now I am here
In the hall of fallen warriors
But I can still hear the call for battle
The horn of Heimdall sounding through the sky
