A feast to praise the glory of
The Allfather and his sons
Mead is served in pints and we sing
Hymns of heroic conquests

Telling the tales of our forefathers
Of gods, battles and victory
In a great hall, where songs are to be sung
Merrily dancing upon the tables

In the evening cold
We dance, sing and fight
Drinking mead as if Ragnarok
Is closing in
Into the night we drink
We dance, sing and fight
Until the sunrise
It has only begun

The feast goes to an end in the morning
All of us have grown tired
But this hall will be lit up again
And we'll sing and dance by the fire

Telling the tales of our forefathers
Of gods, battles and victory
In a great hall, where songs are to be sung
Merrily dancing upon the tables

In the evening cold
We dance, sing and fight
Drinking mead as if Ragnarok
Is closing in
Into the night we drink
We dance, sing and fight
Until the sunrise
It has only begun
