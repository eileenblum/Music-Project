You stand on the brink
You stand on the precipice
And you can't stop looking down
You're starting to think 
And hating the prejudice
Even though no ones around 

You want to fly
But you're stapled to the ground
You say "Why can't I just spread my wings?"

And say goodbye?
We don't care for the accolades
We don't care for the lies
Because everything here will surely die

It's ok to feel alive inside
Even when you feel alone
It's ok to question everything
'Cause everyone eventually 
Finds their way home 

We dance on the ledge
We laugh at the heretics
We know we have this figured out
We push to the edge
We push 'til we're sick of it
We push beyond every form of doubt

They try to pry
They try to make us lose our grip
We turn our backs because we know we're better

Than all this shit
All they want are the accolades
All they want is a prize
But we take pity on the pain they hold inside

It's ok to feel alive inside
Even when you feel alone
It's ok to question everything
'Cause everyone eventually 
Finds their way home 

I don't want, I don't need, I don't care
What did you think that I would say?
It is a choice that I make every single day
It's mine to make the choice to be alive in-

How you like me now?
There's no room for extremities
There's no time for reprise
It only takes a moment to decide

It's ok to feel alive inside
Even when you feel alone
It's ok to question everything
'Cause everyone eventually 
Finds their way home 

You gotta make a choice
And find your way back home
We are alive inside
