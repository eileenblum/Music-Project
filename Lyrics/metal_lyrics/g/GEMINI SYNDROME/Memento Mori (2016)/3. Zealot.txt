Not to concerned with deserting
All the differences everyone's observing
Take me away from the verdict
All the simpletons, all our minds are blurring.
Raise the hands for the haunting
All the imbeciles everyone is running
Put it all down til there's nothing
Not repentance, at-least you live with something.

We will believe
Whatever you think we need

Everybody's scratching just to get to the surface
Find their purpose in this wasted life
Everybody wants to know their ending is worth it
That its worth it
Its not wasted time

We don't believe in you (Zealot)
We don't believe in you

Taking a meal from the beggar
It's already rotten and he doesn't even need it
Who needs a sheep to be a shepherd?
All is a waste because nobody can eat it
Who needs knowledge from a prophet?
Scribble the words down but nobody will read it
Sell the page to make a profit
Speak the truth and yet nobody will eat it

We will believe
Whatever you think we need

Everybody's scratching just to get to the surface
Find their purpose in this wasted life
Everybody wants to know their ending is worth it
That its worth it
Its not wasted time

We don't believe in you (Zealot)
We don't believe in you

We are a...
Seller, Martyr and a Trader
Order, Harder and a Beggar
You are a fools prophet and forsaker
We don't believe in you....

You have deceived
With every breath you breathe

Everybody's scratching just to get to the surface
Find their purpose in this wasted life
Everybody wants to know their ending is worth it
That its worth it
Its not wasted time

We don't believe in you (Zealot)
We don't believe in you

We don't believe in you!
