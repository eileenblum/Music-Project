Do you ever find yourself in the backseat when you know you should be driving the car?
Do you ever feel like you are the victim?
Do you even know how strong that you are?
Do you ever see the flaw in the system,
Thinking history just happened again?
Do you ever wanna tap into wisdom:
Find a cause you can truly defend?

Look inside.
No matter what you do an idea can't die.

We are anonymous.
We are all of us.
We are everyone.
We are one in the same.
We are everything.
We are everywhere.
We are everyone and we don't need a name.
Anonymous.
We don't need a name.
Anonymous.
We all die the same.

Anonymous.

Do you ever take a look in the mirror and recognize the beauty you see?
Do you ever think of pulling the trigger?
Imagine how important you'll be.
Do you ever think that you are the master and everybody else is a slave?
Do you realize everything's equal and everybody sleeps in a grave?

Pick a side.
No matter what you do the idea survives.

Everybody love each other
Everybody go
Everyone is an infidel in someone else's eyes.
No one ever wins a holy war if anybody dies.
I am the pale horse.

We are anonymous.
We are all of us.
We are everyone.
We are one in the same.
We are everything.
We are everywhere.
We are everyone and we don't need a name.
Anonymous.
We don't need a name.
Anonymous.
We all die the same.

Are you one of us?
Then you don't need a name.
