You got your model, you got your PhD.
You got in your house in the hills and now you're looking down on me.
You forgot compassion, you forgot integrity.
You forgot all the things that are human and make you resemble me.

You know, you know, you know.

You can't take it with you; you're only gonna leave it behind.
The only thing that's helping you push through are the memories that live in your mind.
While everyone is chasing the dragon, losing sight of what should have been clear.
I'll be here to deliver a message; I doubt it's what you wanted to hear.
I'm not sorry (not, not, not sorry)

You're so persistent, like a cancer eating love.
You cut at the beauty below but then you curse the world above.
You're an infestation, you're a condescending lie.
You're ignoring the soul and forgetting that your body won't survive.

You know, you know, you know.

You can't take it with you; you're only gonna leave it behind.
The only thing that's helping you push through are the memories that live in your mind.
While everyone is chasing the dragon, losing sight of what should have been clear.
I'll be here to deliver a message; I doubt it's what you wanted to hear.
I'm not sorry (not, not, not sorry)

Why should I apologize for everything I feel inside.
For everything I've been denied.
Sorry not sorry.

You can't take it with you; you're only gonna leave it behind.
The only thing that's helping you push through are the memories that live in your mind.
While everyone is chasing the dragon, losing sight of what should have been clear.
I'll be here to deliver a message; I doubt it's what you wanted to hear.
I'm not sorry (not, not, not sorry)
