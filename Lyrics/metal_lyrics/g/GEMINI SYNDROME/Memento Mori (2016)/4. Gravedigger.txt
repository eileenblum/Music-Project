Gravedigger, gravedigger...
I can't...
I can't sleep...

I cannot sleep but I don't wanna wake up.
Chemicals and entropy and all the other things that we make up.
Hide and seek, blood and all that it's made of.
Chemistry and symmetry and blasphemy, below and above...

No one is coming to save you.
You don't have the answers but I do.
Open your eyes.
Follow the light.
Bury the darkness behind you.
Bury the darkness inside of you.
Gravedigger, gravedigger

Where did you come from if all of the embers are gone?
The world's an asylum and I am patient... number one.
You say I'm not sick but behind your smile your finger's on the trigger!
Push me away, push me down but when no one's around,
I'll do what I say to you...

No one is coming to save you.
You don't have the answers but I do.
Open your eyes.
Follow the light.
Bury the darkness behind you.
Bury the darkness inside of you.
Gravedigger, gravedigger

All of the pain that you feel is a lie.
The real salvation is living inside.
The shadows just want you to run and hide.
We need to remember that we are alive!
(We are alive!)

No one is coming to save you.
You don't have the answers but I do.
Open inside.
Shine in your light.
The fire is rising inside you.
No one is coming to save you.
You think you're alone, well me too!
Open your eyes.
Follow the light.
Bury the darkness behind you.
Bury the darkness inside of you!
Bury the darkness inside of you.
Gravedigger, gravedigger
