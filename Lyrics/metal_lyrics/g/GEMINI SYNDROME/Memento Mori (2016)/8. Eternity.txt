Everyday is a new dream

We take for granted all the beauty in our life
It's not supposed to be that way
With all the torment and the struggle and the strife
It's up to all of us to see the light again

I wish I had nothing to say
Everyday is a new dream - a new reality
Everything existing - all in one for us to see
Welcome to eternity

We make assumptions that are only based on lies
Because of the trauma that we see
So take a deep breath, then just open up your heart to hear
The universe in harmony

I wish I had nothing to say

Everyday is a new dream
A new reality
Everything existing
More than one for us to see
Welcome to eternity

Give yourself the opportunity to see free
Rid yourself of insecurity and we become we

How could you have nothing to say?
How could you have nothing to say?
Everyday is a new dream - a new reality
Everything existing - all in one for us to see
Weâre becoming something greater than infinity
Welcome to eternity

ETERNITY!
