Daylight
It's just too bright for me
I won't compromise
If it's my demise
You don't have the eyes

Awaken

It's a grand design
And now it's time to awaken

And now it's time to awaken

You don't have the eyes to see
What's living inside of me
You don't know what I could be
It's just an atrocity

I'll die with a smile on my face
