It's time to say goodnight to the nightmare as it gently falls asleep.

Another restless night, another show plays in my head.
It seems to never end.
Another hopeless plight, another cold and empty bed,
And the solitude again.
How can I live this lie again?

Is it time to say goodnight to the nightmare as it gently falls asleep?
Is it time to say goodbye to the demons and the skeletons we keep?
Sweet dreams.

Another go-around, the clock just waves its hands at me.
It's the only thing I see.
Just one more time around and still no promise of relief.
I don't think I'll ever sleep.

How can I face another day?
Will I ever be okay?

Is it time to say goodnight to the nightmare as it gently falls asleep?
Is it time to say goodbye to the demons and the skeletons we keep?
Sweet dreams.
Sweet dreams.

As I close my eyes, I feel sweet release.

Is it time to say goodnight to the nightmare as it gently falls asleep?
Is it time to say goodbye to the demons and the skeletons we keep?
Sweet dreams.
Sweet dreams.

It's time to say goodnight.
