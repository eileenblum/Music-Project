Sit down
And pay attention to
The lesson that I have for you
I am renowned
For my pretension and
All the wisdom that I spew
I'll lead the way
And you will follow me
Even though I don't have a clue.

We're tired of everything you say

You just know
No matter what they say
That everyone is wrong
You know it all
You're just waiting
For the whole world to adore you

You're so on point

Are you done?
I think I've had enough
Of you rambling on and on
It's time for you to realize
That you drive everyone away
You're just a clown
And we are laughing at every word you say

But you keep talking anyway

You just know
No matter what they say
That everyone is wrong
You know it all
You're just waiting
For the whole world to adore you

You're so on point

Whispering
Screaming
Or something between
It all lacks a meaning
We don't hear a word you say

You just know
No matter what they say
That everyone is wrong
It's such a shame
You fight it tooth and nail
Until everyone is gone
Who is to say that there is anything
Left for you to learn?
You know it all
You're just waiting
For the whole world to adore you

You're so on point
