I take a deep breath
The smell might get me high
You get fucked up just to get by

I sleep all day 'cause I can't open my eyes
You pissed it all away
And never said goodbye

The strength I find
I find on the inside
And I will not apologize

We are so scared of
What's around the corner
That's why we try to destroy the order

Chaos won't let us see
What's coming around the bend
The journey is more important than the end

The strength I find
I find on the inside
And I will not apologize for my prize

I guess you didn't know
It's not a weakness
It's just my syndrome

You will never know
The depth of my syndrome

Why do we try to die
Syndrome

The pills will make it go away
Depression is my only friend
I'm never getting better
And I don't want to anyway

The strength I find
I find on the inside
And I will not apologize for my prize

The angels are calling me home
I guess you didn't know
It's not a weakness
It's just my syndrome

Why do we try to do all the time
Isn't it enough to be alive?
