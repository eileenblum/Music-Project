A stranger asks me
"Where you coming from?"
I say I don't know
"Well where you going?"
Surely I'm going home

Like everything we rise and fall away
Just as the ocean ebbs and flows each day

I'll take you away from your nightmare
If only you would come with me
I wanna show you a better way
Take this

A stranger stops and offers me a gift
And says "Take this please"
I never wanted anything more
The pressure brings me to my knees

Like everything we rise and fall away
Just as the ocean ebbs and flows each day

I'll take you away from your nightmare
If only you would come with me
I wanna show you a better way
So you and I will finally be free
Won't you please
Take this

I never lived a life I wouldn't die for
But I guess it's all the same
The dream is still alive
While you're not sleeping

The dreamers dream

As flawed as you may think you are
You're perfect to me
Crawl inside the hole in my heart
And we will never leave

I'll take you away
I wanna show you a better way
So you and I will finally be free
Won't you please
Take this
