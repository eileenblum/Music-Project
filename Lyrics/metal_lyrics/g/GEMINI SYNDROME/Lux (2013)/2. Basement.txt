Color-coded blasphemy
This really strange anatomy
Is this really my life?
Something isn't right
The ambiguity
This whole damn conspiracy
Playing out in my head
Something isn't right

I never wanted this
I never asked for it
This is what you gave me
I never wanted this
I never asked for it

Stranger than a massacre
This homicidal afterbirth
I am not a stranger
To living with the anger
I don't need a miracle
I just need a place to go
Send me to the angels
And tell God I said goodbye

I never wanted this
I never asked for it
This is what you gave me
I never wanted this
I never asked for it
But this is what you gave me

I could care less about the world sometimes
A certain inspiration takes me to the afterlife
I'll see you on the other side

Nothing ever takes away
The shit that I see everyday
With total inconsistency
So fuck the whole conspiracy
So long I'm fucking done

Why would you forsake me?
