Focus eludes me
What a stupid game to play
The shadows that haunt me
Hide in just the same way

Mother can you
Can you come save me?
I can't see you
But I'm afraid to look away
And I'm afraid to say

Nothing left of who I have been before
Broken pieces of me
Remind of something more

No one can take away
The things that I remember
The fire that used to burn
Is now a dying ember

Father will you
Will you try to help me?
I wish I could
I wish I could help you see reality

Nothing left of who I have been before
Broken pieces of me
Remind of something more
Choking on the stories and lies you tell
Something is wrong
And now I stand beside myself

Nothing left of me

The puzzle's broken
It's scattered over the floor
The puzzle's broken on the floor

The puzzle's broken
It's missing pieces
And I was hoping
That the missing piece was me

The puzzle's broken
Nothing left of me
