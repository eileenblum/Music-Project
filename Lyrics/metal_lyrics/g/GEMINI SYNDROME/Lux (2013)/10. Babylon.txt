Everybody turn with a blind eye
To a diet of death and cyanide
Just pretend that you're OK
And it'll all be fine

Welcome to the fall of Babylon
And the rapture of the world
We built it in

The scenery is quintessential
And our ignorance is fundamental
To our pending demise
Now I claw out my eyes

Is there no repentance
For me here?
Is there any other way
For me to try
For death to die

Kiss your life goodbye
And hold the sun
Feel the fire in my eyes
It's only just begun

Welcome to the fall
Goodbye Babylon

Goodbye
