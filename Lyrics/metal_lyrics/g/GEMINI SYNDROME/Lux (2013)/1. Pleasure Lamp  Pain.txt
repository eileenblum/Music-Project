Infinite
The Ultimate expression of who I am
Incredulous
The barren definition of a dying man
Presumptuous
To assume that a tomb is not
The body you're walking in
In all of us
Is a sin that begins and doesn't end
Until we syphon the last breath

I am alive inside of your truth
I am your proof

We are all the light of the sun and the moon
And we will be the same as one
You are just a reflection of all that you see
And you are always alive in me
We are only one and the same
In pleasure and pain

Permissive
The fatal flaw of a forgiving God
Dismissive
Reactionary to all of the laws above
Reverse it
Into the wake of mistakes and see
The cosmos exploding
Deserve it?
In the land of the sages we render the verdict

Pain
My weakest pleasure
Deranged and a sense of abandon
Tame in the wake of a tyrant
Survive in the aftermath
Nothing comes after that
Moment of fiction and friction is
Truth

I am aware that I'm vicious

We are all the light of the sun and the moon
And we will be the same as one
You are just a reflection of all that you see
And you are always alive in me
We are only one and the same

Pleasure and pain
