I know this place
It smells like innocence lost
We left traces of the sins we bought

But I wouldn't change a thing
It's just a waking dream

Look at the wake
From the stardust pouring from your eyes
It's no mistake
You are perfect
You are perfect in my mind
And you won't fade away

I know this face
It's so familiar
I'm sure I know you but it's all a blur

Now I can't recall a thing
It's such a wicked dream

Praise to the memory
Living inside of me
Host to entirety writing my story
Lusting and gluttony
So unbecoming
The stardust is making me blind

But you won't be left behind
The memory is here to remind

Look at the wake
From the stardust pouring from your eyes
It's no mistake
You are perfect in my mind
And you won't fade away
