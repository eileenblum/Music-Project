Look inside the picture frame
The faces have been empty for so long
You are a prisoner
The story is sinister
Only memory remains
The space is only empty when you're gone
Today is apocalypse
The story is on your lips

I can't save you

Every time I try to redirect your eyes
To see through to the real you
You push me to the side every single time
And I can't help you
From falling apart again

Every day is a tragedy
And everything is dying anyway
I'm not afraid to die
The memories multiply
Hope is just a breath away
Your hear it when the angels call your name
Is anyone listening
The Deity is beckoning

I can't save you

Why?

The journey to save yourself
Is but a reflection of the dreams you have
That try to separate you from
Heaven and Hell
You wanna quit but never will
Because it's already over
