Sick of myself my world my life
Get out of my way this truth can't lie
I stop myself every second I try
Every minute of time is an hour I die

Every day is another complication
A journey through another maze
I found my way through recapitulation
Everything is still a haze
But Heaven still holds me
I live my life inside imagination
Keep the secrets that i have made

It's the silence that enslaves me
It's the only thing that saves me

If you knew what it meant to me
To make it through tonight
You would be a mourning star
And guide me through this life

Everyday is another conversation
Soaking our intent with lies
The whole thing is open to interpretation
It should come as no surprise

The enemy is everywhere

Death would be an ample compensation
Even if it's my demise
But Heaven doesn't want me
Head to toe in blood and perspiration
I would wipe the tares and lies

But Heaven disowned me
Now Heaven won't know me

Nobody gets out alive
And I know there's no way to buy my way in
I can't say that i didn't try
I guess that I'll just have to try again

Sick of myself my world my life
Get out of my way this truth can't lie
I stop myself every second I try
Every minute of time is an hour I die

The enemy is everywhere
