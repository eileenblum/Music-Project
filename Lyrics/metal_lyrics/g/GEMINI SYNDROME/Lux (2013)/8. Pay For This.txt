Everything a little piece of now
And everybody wonders how
We designed the whole thing
Without killing the whole dream
Take a lesson from the stars
And never question who you are
These are just the soul screams
The are just the new memes

Soul dead
My head is bleeding

One day you're gonna pay for this
But right now you get away
I'm still the first in line
And left behind it's so benign
One day you're gonna pay for this I know

Cancer of integrity
Sucking all my energy
I am not afraid to say
Stay the fuck away from me

Soul dead
Your head is bleeding

I like the pain a little bit
If I was less I would have to quit
I'm sick and tired of all of this shit

You're gonna pay for this now
You're gonna pay
I'm still the first in line
And left behind it's so benign
One day you're gonna pay for this I know

I like the pain a little bit
I was less I would have to quit
I'm fucking tired of all of it
