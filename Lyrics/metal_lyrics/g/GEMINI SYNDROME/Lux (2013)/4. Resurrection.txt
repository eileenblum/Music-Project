Rise up

Broken misery
Adjectives for my heart
Stifled consistently
Right from the start

I watched you burn alive
And from the ashes you rise

Strip down and separate
The things you really need here
Dissolve and dissipate
Everything that I fear

There's monsters in the closet
They're hiding under the bed
An analog composite
of the illusions in my head

I watched you burn alive
And from the ashes you rise
It should be no surprise
You were always a phoenix in disguise

My actions criticized
My intentions demonized
The negative redirected
And the enemy
Now I recognize

The atrophy is pushing me
Deeper down into the storm
Divine come alive
And make me reborn

I watched you burn alive
And from the ashes you rise
It should be no surprise
You were always a phoenix in disguise
The phoenix never dies

Rise

No the phoenix never dies
