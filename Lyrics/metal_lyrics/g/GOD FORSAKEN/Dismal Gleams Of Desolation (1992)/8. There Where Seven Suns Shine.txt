Rise up to the dark colours, travel through the yesterday clouds
Ride with the cold autumn winds...
There where seven suns shine
Walk with the whispering gods...
Learn the secrets beyond...
Until another grreatness will fall in the world's debris

[Repeat]

The remains of a new day are gone...
With the wasted years
Expired into mirages and entombed in future sorrows
