Echo from the depths of sorrow
Filled by voices of tedium
Losing the reality...the opacity of existence
Thoughts become numb...human guises misled
[Chorus]
Extinguishing pain
Immortalized suffering
Dark shadows straying in a maze...yearning for relief
Exhaling timeless tedium
Petrified dready forms...crying in continual sadness
For unfailing gloomy blackness...

[chorus]
