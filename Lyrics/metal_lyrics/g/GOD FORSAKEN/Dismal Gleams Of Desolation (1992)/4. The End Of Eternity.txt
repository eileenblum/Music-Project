Tell me what I see, are the sands of time ending for me?
Tell me the stories untold, 'cause I know that tomorrow won't come
Let me feel the forgotten fears of our darkest dreams
Take me to the hidden valleys, show me your mighty kingdom

[Chorus]

I'm dead, but can you feel my still warm remains?
Is this the end of eternity?
My pale cranium lies on dreaming deserts

[Repeat chorus]

And now I see the glories of your divine worlds
I wander ahead through grotesque pleasures
Take me into your mind
Let me feel the lustful desires

I want to copulate with it all
"Like the man Adam knew his wife Eve"
I know that you can't give my life back
Why don't you take me away from this rotting body?
And burn my soul in frozen flames 'till I understand

[Repeat 1st verse]
