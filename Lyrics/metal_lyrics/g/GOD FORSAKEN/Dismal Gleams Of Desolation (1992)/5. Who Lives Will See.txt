Watch the dark clouds go by...
Look away and see the humble absorbed in sad thoughts
Believing in God, whom they will never see
Not knowing that their soul won't be saved

[Chorus]

He who lives in the end will see the truth
Those who lived with the blissful promises
Will drown in their own holiness
Tremble in fear...as you grive for lost bindweed
Unbearable pain torture your innerself
Amorphous darkness closes your knowledge
Forever lost...
Walk endlessly through the invisible doors

You praised the Lord which never came
And now you lie in holy mass graves with your beliefs

[Repeat chorus]
