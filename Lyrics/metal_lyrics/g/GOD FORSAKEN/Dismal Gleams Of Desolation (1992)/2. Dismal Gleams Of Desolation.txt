Lying in my bed, afraid to fall asleep
The time passes by so fast as I'm thinking of the past
Plans for tomorrow so vast, my pointless life without peace
No reason to make it last

[Chorus]

The night comes so soon, everything seems so gloomy
As I'm waiting for the dawn, dismal gleams of desolation
Looking in the mirror, all I see is the sorrow
As I close my tired eyes, drown in waves of darkness
To feel again the fears of my dreams

[Repeat]

[Repeat chorus]

After the sleepless night I leave the darkness for a moment
Feeling the warm sun on my dying body
So much has to be done 'till I reach it all
