Engulfed by a sense of loneliness
Feeling empty inside I silently cry
With tears in my eyes I scream for your name
You were so real, like the way it should be

Emotions failed, forsaken by what I am
Has it all come to an end?
Devoid of love my only friend
My love for you died within the end
I let you go, in a way I never wanted
And it is all over now, I leave myself to die
