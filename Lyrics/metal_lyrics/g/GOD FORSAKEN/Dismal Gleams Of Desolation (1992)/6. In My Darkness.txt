My absorption inside the circle of confusion
I finally reach the consolation...
Awhile I am falling in a drowning dream
I see myself in a dark room...
Where the shadows of astray souls make walls to my dream
I see myself lying dead...
The people around me are sad...
A priest above me seems like a God's emblem
The roses fall down from the hands of a stranger
My dream refuses to end, the shadows they lead me

[Repeat]
