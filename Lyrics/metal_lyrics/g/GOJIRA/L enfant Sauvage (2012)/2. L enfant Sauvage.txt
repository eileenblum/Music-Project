So long I've been trying to match
It doesn't work
I'm trying
I don't know
The aberration of this world
I try to deal with

It killed a part of me
That was raging
The pain is gone
The denial
I've run away from institutions
I owe myself
Life

There's no way
I will respond to this passion and anger
Flowing through me
There is light in this world I fight for
The reason you won't leave this cage
Betray your child
The desire you once had to reveal yourself
Forgot to create your own life

Anger
Lies
Denial

This righteous anger
Boiling inside of us
Won't last forever
Don't fear to let it out
Branches have grown through,
The wolf is your master

The sky is all over me
I run on time.
