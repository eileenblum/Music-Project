[Special Edition Track]The speed of the line was rending, my hands on blood
But I always grab on these darkened visions
And I try my best to avoid this poison

Amplifying the sounds from under
Horror vision increasing, they're crawling
So broken, twisted, I feel their grasp on me
Can I trust this night mare, kill me

You wield a secret so dark and cold
Never bow and obey to soul control
Are these creatures part of me insane
And their shadows my only shelter, last creation

Run for your life, like the wind, go, run
Leave behind the conflict, the load you carry
Don't fear the light of tomorrow
This fire will wipe them out forever

Sound underground, alive
I grow my soul wide inside
Grow

You wield a secret dark and so cold
Never bow and obey to soul control
Are these creatures a part of me insane
And their shadows my only shelter, last creation
