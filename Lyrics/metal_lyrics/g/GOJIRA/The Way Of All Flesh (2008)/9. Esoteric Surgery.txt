You have the power to heal yourself

All illness can be healed
the cell regenerates
disambiguated situation
There is a secret code
in the structure of the mind
You have the power to heal yourself

Flesh bodies mute and blinded
roaming uncertain, lost
infected misinformed
Releasing a black enormous insect
out from the chest
archaic form disease

Esoteric surgery a dissection of the soul
Unsuspected precise power
on the wounded astral body
projected beam of light

All illness can be healed
the cell regenerates
disambiguated situation
There is a secret code
in the structure of the mind
You have the power to heal yourself

Suspended floating in empty spaces
Descending swift like a fire running down
Obstruction disintegration life force
overcoming all circumstances
Release the pain
