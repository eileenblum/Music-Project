Over the flows
I take my time
I search and turn around
Watching the stars
I want to dive in the sky
Deep inside of me

Over the sky
I found a place I can be
No need to run
Follow my heart
I understand why and when
And what it's all about

Watching the signs
Dancing all around
Over the flows
I find now a way
Speak the words
Already know
And now I learn
Open the door
