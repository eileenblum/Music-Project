I feel I come from better conditions
Buried deep in my mind I forgot
Awake my soul
I want to find and drink this light

Images of the past
Other lives and other places
Always the same embraces
I return to where I've been

I take inside a forward movement
Involved in desire of consciousness
Progress, understand
I want to find the keys of the past

Remember the past present future
Memory is a force
So many things have happened
To me the hardest of all

But the gates would never again
Be opened to me unless
I could bid them open at my
Own will and command

I feel I come from better conditions
(opened them at my own will and command)
Buried deep in my mind I forgot
(opened them at my own will and command)
Always the same light, same embraces
(opened them at my own will and command)
I take inside a forward movement
