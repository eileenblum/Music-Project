I'm sitting by a lake
But it's not of this earth
The water is so clear
And the birds are alive
A mirror for the sky
They see themselves
And fly away

I'm sitting by a lake
The universe is alive
I lay down by the river-flow
It's a river of stars
I'm living by the ocean
It's an ocean of light
How do you call
This place around us
It's a world that I once saw
In a dream

Will you please tell me now
If I'm dead or alive
Landscapes so bright
All around
It's a city of light
Where who when and why?
I think therefore I am
I feel like I know this land
But it must be so far away...

This world is life
This "clouds-and-wonders"
Is all I need
And it will never go
You say it's lost
I don't believe it
This is my vision
We can never know

This is the earth
But ages after
I know the world
Will overcome its' pain
The simple fact
I dream about it
Already makes it
Happen in the rain

It's right in front
But you don't face it
I'm dedicated
All my life in me
And made of light
Our sun is growing
Like in the heart of some of us
I pray

And other lands
You will discover
This form of life
Is not the only one
I was a child
And I just knew it
And know I know
The vision came alive
