Lay down fall away
Lie awake
Just cannot move
My arms and legs
I'm paralyzed
Don't recall how to free
Myself from this
In the heart of the dark
My face contorted
Don't know how to
Reach the light
But I feel so bad
Like a freak in a cage

Open the door
Enter your heart
You go so far

Golden unworldly silence
Space flight at speed of light
I cross the clouds and colours
The black hole is calling me
I slide on the horizon
On the frontier not to cross

Black dwarf
Time's gone distorted
In the heart of the dark
A whirl of light

Enter in
The realm of nothingness
I fell the cold, my eyes are shut
My fear is slowly dying
Light years from here
Are my thoughts and cages
I can hear their moan
But now a long deep breath
Is calling

Overtaking time
And now understanding space
I feel united
I do cross light
I feel the living
Here in the center
Stands the light of love
That never can be touched
From greater silence
Shall return
