Four hundred thousand years ago
They came from outer space
And gave us life here
And we are just taking everything for granted
I don't think we should do this now

And when I see the smoke around
I feel like I'm not from humankind down there
I feel like glaciers are my eyes
And mountains are my head
My heart is ocean

And I feel all alone
'Cause everybody's wrong
I fear the living
What is this thing that we call hate
And that's inside of me
Get out of here!

A world is down
And none can rebuild it
Disabled lands are evolving
My eyes are shut, a vision is dying
My head explodes
And I fall in disgrace

I hold my inner child within
And tell him not to cry,
"Don't fear the living"
One day you will stand as a king
And no fear can erase
This light below us
Each one of us is now engaged
This secret we all have
This truth is growing
And as a warrior I have to fight
I can already feel
The love I'll discover

I had this dream, our planet surviving
The guiding stars always glowing
And all the wealths
The fates of the countries
They're all rebuilding at the same time
I never fell and always believed it
We could evolve and get older
Open thy eyes and let all this flow in
Now see a new hope is growing inside

We will see our children growing [13x]
