On my way
To the vision-come-true
I enter a galaxy rising
And I land on this
Brown and green old place
Whose wild is giant trees

Trees so strong
That they never can fall
Four suns alight
In silver grey sky
Wild river flows
With rage alive
Lions of fire approach me

Carved by the wind
And the fall of water
From the treetops
I can see the end of a time

Living respectful
Low your axe
And learn from the trees

Second dawn
Meet the sylvanlings
Passageways into the deep
Invitations to explore the forest
Lions gales and chambers

A tree trunk
Larger than a mountain
Stands on the top
Of this hill
Made of rock and mist

Living respectful
Low your axe
And learn from the trees

Henceforth
I will be always there
Planet earth will overcome
Men destroyed
Scorned and killed their lives
But the world is on her way
