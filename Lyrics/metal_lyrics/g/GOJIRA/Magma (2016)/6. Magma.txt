Analyze this chemistry, producing poison
And creeping in your veins, for the love of blood
The poison slowly spreads, through the body and mind
Close your eyes and drop your things
Be ready to fly

You're now, highâ¦
In the sun, burnâ¦
You're away, aliveâ¦
On the moon, roundâ¦

After walking all the miles, consumed into your bones
And breathing all the dust, of the desert land.

I know that all along
You were doing it for absolution
It's written in your eyes

You're now, highâ¦
In the sun, burnâ¦
You're away, aliveâ¦
On the moon, roundâ¦

Awayâ¦
Just want to fly awayâ¦ always
Higherâ¦ Awayâ¦
Embrace the light on the other side.
