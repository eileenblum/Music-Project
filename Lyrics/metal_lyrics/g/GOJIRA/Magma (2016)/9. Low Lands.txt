Tell me what you see,
In the after-life
Par-delÃ  le ciel
Par-delÃ  le soleil

In all there is to learn
The sun is on our side
And though you're on the run
You will surviveâ¦
Expanded to the state of light
The deepest corners of the world
Gliding through the lowlands
And swimming all the oceans

Walking through the silence
Already made it through the night
There will be a new day
Whenever the sun rises

You're invisible, you're in everything
Tell me what you see
Tell me you're everywhere
Tell me nowâ¦

While you drift away,
From all the plagues of this world
You're put out of misery, giant monsterâ¦

You won't have to face it again
Every step of the way gets you higherâ¦

All the voices trapped underneath the ground
Let them all go in the sky!
Find the power lost underneath the ground
Let it all blow in the sky!
All the voices trapped in my head
Let them all scream in the night!
Find the power lost underneath the ground
Let it all blow in the sky!
