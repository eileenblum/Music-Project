As we shoot up a flare all along the runway
Transmit impulses into the void
Ready to get lost amid cries of fragment knowledge
Tremendously tempted from the tabloid

Morning occurs after morning
Occasions will come so far
Rare updates keep turning
Waving around the stop

As we drift outside
How should we grasp the sense
For we dissipate wastes
Everywhere

In relation to daylight we figure
Benefits of elaborate orders
In absolute trust and complacency
Blatant ignorant vacancy
Easy to be found and controlled by social units
That watch and ward us accordingly
Interpret our vision
Arrive at decisions
Harden grips on my throat if you care

Sequence of days seeks warnings
Heading to wading stars
Trading for minor planets
Almost unseen from above

As we drift outside
How should we grasp the sense
For we dissipate wastes
Everywhere

And why should we care for the coming
Why, when it's always in store
