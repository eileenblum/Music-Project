Dreams caress me down
Melting like wax
Social instincts fade
Triumph of chaos

[Chorus:]
Stand motionless like a tree
On a rainy day

Whispers in my head
Unwanted noises
Thereâs no choice in the end
Creeping disaster

[Chorus:]
Stand motionless like a tree
On a rainy day
Breathe quietly
Into the stream of cold dismay

Unbelievable lie
Nothing but disgust
Left high and dry
With a handful of dust

Stand still and motionless in the rain

[Chorus:]
Stand helpless and left for dead
Praying in the rain
Fall into a trap
No, no, no escape
