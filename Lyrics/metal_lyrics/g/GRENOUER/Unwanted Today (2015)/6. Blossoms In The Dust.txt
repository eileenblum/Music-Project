How do you make peace with troubles?
How do you heal yourself?
How can you bounce back when life falls apart?
You cannot tell

[Chorus:]
Blossoms in the dust
Raising lights
True brilliance
Scratches on the glass
Challenging experience

There's so many ways to lose a battle
To lose track of time
What makes you want to try harder?
You cannot tell

[Chorus:]
Blossoms in the dust
Broken wings can still fly
Tainted with rust
The well of teas has run dry
Cold and bitter

Cold and bitter tears
Blossoms in the dust
The well of tears

[Chorus:]
Blossoms in the dust
Raising lights
True brilliance
Scratches on the glass
Challenging experience

Brightly painted stars
Blossoms in the dust
