Stop telling me your secrets
I donât want to know
Thereâs no need to flirt
If youâve been hurt
Throw your fears away

Leave your cares behind
I wonât sooth your pain
I won't sooth you

[Chorus:]
Artificial tears
Down-and-dirty tricks
Innocent disgrace
You will never fool me

Fake smiles
Stupid worries
Insecure thoughts
You complain too much
You enjoy being watched
Nothing sets you free

Practical confusion takes a hold of you

[Chorus:]
Artificial tears
Down-and-dirty tricks
Innocent disgrace
You will never fool me

You're not gonna fool me
Leave your cares behind
I wonât sooth your pain

[Chorus:]
Artificial tears
Fooled me twice
Faint memories
Hit me in the heart
