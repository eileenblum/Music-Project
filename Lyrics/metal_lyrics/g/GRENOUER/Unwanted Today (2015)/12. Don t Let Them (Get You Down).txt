Welcome, summer
You are so desirable
Days of glamour
Wild and free

Life's too short
Short like summer
Hear the strokes of the clock
Hear the tone of the bell
Hear the bell

[Chorus:]
Don't let them get you down
Don't let them
Don't let anyone get you down
Don't get down

Goodbye, summer
Farewell to childhood
Sweet and lovely
Sun in my heart

Life's too short
Delightful as a noon
Drink to the last drop
Follow the call and bloom
Follow and bloom

[Chorus:]
Don't let them get you down
Don't let them
Don't let anyone get you down
Don't get down

[Chorus:]
Don't hide behind the screen
Don't complain
Come and play
Don't let anyone lock you down
Step outside
