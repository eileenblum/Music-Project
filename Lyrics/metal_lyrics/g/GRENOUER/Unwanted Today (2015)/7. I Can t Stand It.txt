The bottom of your soul
Uncertainty
Silent as a stone
Obscurity

What a mess
You're not an easy guess

[Chorus:]
I can't stand it
I know
I won't stand it
I can't stand it
I know
I won't stand it

This is the last attempt
The trail of doubts
I can't pretend
I want to hang around

Mixed emotions
Harder than toothache
Harder than pain

[Chorus:]
I can't stand it
I know
I won't stand it
I can't stand it
I know
I won't stand it
Easy come, easy go
Nothing left to lose
I won't stand, I won't stand it
Yes I know

[Chorus:]
I can't stand it
I know
I won't stand it
I can't stand it
I know
I won't stand it
Everything goes wrong
I'm better on my own
I won't stand
Yeah I won't stand
What I cannot stand
