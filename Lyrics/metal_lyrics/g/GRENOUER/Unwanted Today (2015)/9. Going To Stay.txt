We don't share the blame
But we don't break up
We get mad when we fight
And we can't stand it

Hey, hey, hey
Maybe that's enough
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus:]
Don't step away
Regain your innocence
You 're going to stay
I beg you, ease the strain

We are hoarse from shouting
Lost our voices
As if we were rivals
And we are rivals
You don't hear what I say
No matter how I shout
I don't speak silence

Hey, hey, hey
Well, that's enough
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus:]
Don't step away
Regain your innocence
You 're going to stay
I beg you, ease the strain

Hey, hey, hey
Are you going to stay?
Don't let me down
Hey, hey, hey
Are you going to stay?
Still need you around

[Chorus:]
Not going to stay
'Cause you are not here
Not going to stay
'Cause you are not here
Got no one to lose
No one to fight with

You're not going to stay
And not going to fight
No way
Not going to wait
And still you're not going
