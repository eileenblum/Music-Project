You never asked me
You were overconfident
It all seemed fine
I didn't mind
We had troubles in the end

Big troubles travel fast
You could defeat me

[Chorus:]
Oh, no
I won't be forever missed
You could defeat me
I know that I won't be forever missed

You sent me pictures
Foolish pictures,
Links and applications
Kept sending me
I was always at work, working hard
You were always on vacation

Fairy tales are over
You could defeat me

[Chorus:]
Oh, no
I won't be forever missed
You could defeat me
I know, I'll never be missed

I am unwanted, I am unwanted
I am unwanted today

[Chorus:]
I feel unwanted
You've passed me by
Never been missed
Called it a day
I know, I'll never be missed

I'm awake now
I'm unwanted today
