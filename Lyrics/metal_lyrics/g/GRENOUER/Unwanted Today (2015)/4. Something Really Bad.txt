Loosing a street fight
No one by your side
Loosing a street fight
No one by your side
You don't quit
No matter how much it hurts

Bloodshot eyes
Social tension
Lunacy never ends
Social tension

[Chorus:]
Terror flows through your heart
Something really bad
Hideous faces in the crowd
Pretty tough

So untrue
Something really bad

Wearing a uniform
Lying wounded
Wearing a uniform
Lying wounded
You watch the stars
Splendor of the night

Violent playgrounds of moral panic
Harvesting cruel seeds
Social seeds

[Chorus:]
Terror flows through your heart
Something really bad
Hideous faces in the crowd
Pretty tough
Corrupted happiness
Disordered world
Staring into your soul
You are distraught

You've been lost
You've been blind
You've let them dim your shine

[Chorus:]
You can't breathe
Blood and guts
Something really bad
You have got your reward
Something really bad
Corrupted happiness
Disordered world
Your hands turned blue
Everything seems so untrue
