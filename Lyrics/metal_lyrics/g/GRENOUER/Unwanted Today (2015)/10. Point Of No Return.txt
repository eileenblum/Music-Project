You wake up on my shoulder
Tender as a rose
Fair glowing skin from head to toe

There's no magic anymore
Point of no return
Your smile can't make me smile
Don't make me smile

[Chorus:]
I don't belong here
Don't belong here
I don't belong
I don't belong here

I can't bite my tongue
I feel so low
Colors have faded
The wind starts to blow

There's no pressure anymore
Your cry can't make me cry

[Chorus:]
I don't belong here
And I won't belong
I don't belong
Don't belong to you
It's been a long way and we've made it
I don't belong here

[Chorus:]
We can't go on
I don't belong here
Let's move along
It's been a long way and we've made it
I don't belong here
And you don't belong
