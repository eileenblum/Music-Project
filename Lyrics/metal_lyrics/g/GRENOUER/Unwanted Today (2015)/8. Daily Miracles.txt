I've been waiting for tomorrow
It must be just around the corner
Just around

[Chorus:]
Just another sleepless night
Endless summer night
I won't complain about life in summertime

I behold the signs of autumn
A season with two names
Once so easily forgotten
Completely forgotten

[Chorus:]
Just another sleepless night
Endless summer night
I won't complain about life
I have turned my dreams into daily miracles
In the world of delights
Clear skies

Yeah, I won't complain
I won't complain
Yeah, I won't

[Chorus:]
Little daily miracles
Amazing summer nights
Something bigger than life
I have turned my dreams into daily miracles
In the world of delights
Clear skies
