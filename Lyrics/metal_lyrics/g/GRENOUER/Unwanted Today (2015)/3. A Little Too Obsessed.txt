Open diamond horizon
Velvet stripes
Uneven shades
Wonderful sadness
Sacred tides of yesterday

[Chorus:]
You canât stop teasing me
I don't have time to waste
A little too obsessed
Youâve got to forget me
Undoing the knots

I want your diary burned
Scary handbook of diseases
Put all bitterness aside
Climb out of the abyss

[Chorus:]
You canât stop teasing me
I don't have time to waste
A little too obsessed
You âve got to forget me
Undoing the knots
Donât ask me anything
I am sick and tired of you
Youâve dragged me down
Refresh your mind
Turn the things around

A little too obsessed
Get me out of your head
A little too obsessed
You own what you don't possess

[Chorus:]
You canât stop teasing me
I don't have time to waste
A little too obsessed
You âve got to forget me
Undoing the knots
Donât ask me anything
I am sick and tired of you
You âve dragged me down
Refresh your mind
Turn the things around

Donât you have a clue?
I am not stunned by you
