A pig has launched a pussy's forge
Malignant broods remark with hoots
They waste their time with no concern
Just serve one's turn
The matter brooks no delay

A senseless quiz to wink your lens, to grab a goal
With no pretence of laying on a downy bed
Which keeps your head above still waters
Hay-hoo

And I revive and then survive
To play the proof to pad the hoof
I'm on beam I am on wires
My words are glib
Highly inspired
Hay-hoo
AAAHHH

Though I had plenty of battles to fight
Trouble affairs and sleepless nights
The noose was fastened around my neck
And I replied Death ought to wait for me

AAAHHH
And when it comes I turn Her back
We shake our hands, disperse like friends
The vital spark flows on again
Cause I keep saying Death ought to wait for me

They say I was born with a silver spoon
That's not enough
You should be tough
I find amusing an uncertain weakness
We must make our life
We are a-choosing
Hay-hoo
...ought to wait for me
