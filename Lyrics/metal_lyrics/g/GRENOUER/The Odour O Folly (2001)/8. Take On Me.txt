[A-Ha Cover]

We're talking away
I don't know what
I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, OK?

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends but that's me
Stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh the things that you say
Is it live or just to play
My worries away
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two...
