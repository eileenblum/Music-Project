Strap me, plague me, would you grip me?
Deprecation, insurrection
Still feel alive I'm confident
Yearning to cast you down
Still feel abused I'm evident to deviate from laws
Still interdicted from rivalry, still got the noxious flam
Personalized monstrosities
Into the world of damn

Corpulent prolixity
Sloppy turbid shame
Pitiable tenacity
Unresponsive vane

The lackluster zest has rubberized the rest
Carrion's serenity
Tawny pallor

Rack me, fold me, could you hasp me?
Overanxious invocation
Still feel alive I'm confident, unbearable and extreme
Still contradict I'm insolent in desecration of trim
I stigmatize, notorious, gonna dispatch my wounds
Still outstay I'm glorious, a contumacious coon
Aaahhh
