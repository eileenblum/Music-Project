Flaring knots of benevolence
Nerves to cut, overgrown
Malty contracts with elegance
A crude and naked and old anthropoid for the privileged
An execration to gripe
Takes refuge in violence
Remains true to type

Twist the wrist
Raid upon
Flattery will not do

Consummate, mystify
Little pigeons can fly
Breathe against the tide
Dice away every right
Interlacing inside
Let the fury be white
Let yourself off your dot
Or return to the slops

Armchair love is market maze
Introspect blatant lies
Lifelong burdens to carry on
Dizzy attraction shows
Sweep your tenacious memories
Put the world to the sack
Harvest folly and ignorance
Use a fearful hack

Everything reels before
Your stark eye
Takes a shine

So wake up paralyzed
Being doubtfully wise
A bloody bastard to dare
From nowhere to nowhere
Laid to waste faint hopes, left to puzzle out knots
Till the end of the days
Mankind weeds grow apace

Consummate, mystify
Little pigeons can fly
Breathe against the tide
Dice away every right
Interlacing inside
Let the fury be white
Let yourself off your dot
Or return to the slops

So wake up paralyzed
Being doubtfully
A bloody bastard to dare
From nowhere to nowhere
Laid to waste faint hopes, left to puzzle out knots
Till the end of the days
Mankind weeds grow apace...
