Sheitan Sheitan Sheitan
Into This World we're Ground
And After All we're crowned
A Necessary Carnage
Jihad Jihad Jihad
A Million Dead at One Slap
And Millions Wait Their Turn
Everyone Is Condemned

Rip These Joints
Gain the Points
Set the Toils
Burn Away
Pray and Slay
Desolate

Sheitan Sheitan Sheitan
The Day of Judgment Has Come
We Leave No Stone Untouched
With A Heavy Hand
Rejoice Rejoice Rejoice
We're At the Top of Our Voice
We Have Taken the Choice
We Won't Hesitate

Sacred Wars
Come To Blows
A Lethal Dose
The Drowning Sea
Gives No Quarter
Around The Bend

And So, Endeavor
