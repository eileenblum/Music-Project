Let My Story Be Your Story
The Consummation of the Deal
Even If You Take Objections
Retribution Will Begin
When One's Heart is In the Wrong Place
With No Care for a Straw
Contradiction Run Together
To Unleash Eternal Wars

Widowed Hamlets, Breathless Bodies
Underrated Butcher's Bills
Obsolescence of Ideas
Propaganda Torrents Rill
Helpless Recruits, Slaughtered Looters
Heroes Drilled OK To Die
Epidemical Infections
Let Me Offer My True Mite

Activate My Fire, C'mon
An Unexpected Virus, I Go
Rattlesnake Desires
Are Smoldering
Dissipate Your Trying, C'mon
Creep Away, Retire, Oh Yeah
Sheltered In the Mire
I Soak Through the Mill

Let Your Glory Be My Glory
Flavored Hunger, Screamy Tints
More than Hatred Meets Repulsion
Less than Thinking, Unconcern
Turn the Tables on Your Rivals
Make a Score off Your Own Bat
Take Revenge for Your Misfortunes
Use Your Magic to Impact

The Last Bullet
Eyeshot
No Difference
