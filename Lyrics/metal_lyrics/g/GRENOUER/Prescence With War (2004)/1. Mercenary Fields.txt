Piercing Razors inside Me Captivate Mentality
Bits and Pieces outside Me Interfere With Sanity
Running Fires around Here Entertain Anxiety
Sparkling Traces of Anger Segregate My Vanity

Heavy Parcels besides Me Indicate Locality
Silent Trenches behind Me Incarnate Fatality
Cartridge-Cases along Them Demonstrate Proficiency
Rotten Mascots in Caskets Animate Lethality

I'm Going Home
I'm On My Bones
I'm On the Rolls
I Need a Rest
I'm Turning Hoarse
Losing My Throat
I'm On My Toes

Solemn Phrases Upset Us, Weigh upon Our Self-Respect
Towered Targets Below Us Leave No Time to Controvert
Fearsome Victims between Us Follow Hard On Our Heels
Current Symptoms of Stupor Aggravate In Our Thrills

I'm Going Home
I'm Feeling Stoned
I'm Falling Prone
I'm Getting Cold
I Quit the Show
Losing My Hope

I'm Going Home
I'm Ill Bestead
My Star Has Set
Stuck In the Ooze
I'm Slowing Down
A Long Way Round
I'm Going Dead
