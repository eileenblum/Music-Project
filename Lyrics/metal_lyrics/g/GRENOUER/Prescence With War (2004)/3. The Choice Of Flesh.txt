The Choice of Flesh
Depravity
Putridity
Abnormity
Infamous Deeds
Incessant Lies
Tightened Ties
Subversive Greed

The Pick of Breath
Profanity
Hostility
Calamity
Impending Staves
Converging Rays
Distorted Plugs
Enormous Trucks

Human Flesh Is Fairly Paroling Me
Aggravating Me Up To the Neck
Nasty Blood Is Warmly Exposing Me
Staining Bits of the Annular Fleck
Savage Content Is Firmly Controlling Me
Overwhelming My Opening Chest
Pangs of Fury Are Coldly Absolving Me
Chain Reaction Is Mending the Burst

The Break of Thread
Deliverance
Uncherished Sense
Inconsequence
Primeval Guides
Annoying Lights
Impiety
Expectancy

The Rest of Quest
Priority
Intensity
Authority
The Story Is Short
By All Accounts
Razed To the Ground
With No Response

Human Flesh Is Making Integrity
Scraping a Living and Paying Debts
Gruesome Habits Are Nicely Inherited
Treated Under Several Heads
Self-Destruction Is Fiercely Correcting Me
Giving Rise to Malicious Intents
Dirty Slogans Are Densely Advanced By Me
Troublesome Idioms, Directive Offence
