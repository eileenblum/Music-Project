Free enough from sweet emotions
Crying for help
Deep into religious options
Memories are held
Paralyzed with obligations
Nothing to decide
Unprepared for alteration
Coming from inside

I am away from now
I don't turn around

[Chorus:]
There's no temptation to react
Ain't no sorrow
I am not sorry for tomorrow
There's no intention to contact
Ain't no sorrow
I am not sorry, I am not sorry now

Undeveloped or restricted
Helpless from he start
Insecure and afflicted
Willing to depart
Stuck between despair and weakness
Crazy to the bone
Friendly with disgusting sickness
Never too alone

I am away from now
I don't turn around

[Chorus]
