Willing to help yet increasing the fall
Changing the place and building a wall
Speaking the truth and supporting the fraud
Yawning in public and playing the lord

Contradicted
Looking almost unwise
Inconsistent
Criticized

What you do is not lucid wisdom
Got to become the people's choice
What you stress is not a charisma
Got to win another vote

[Chorus:]
One can
Rise above
And now you can
Rise above

Messing around and talking a lot
Smiling a little and giving a nod
Kissing the poor and winning a war
Killing the wounded and becoming a whore

Equalized by mass production
Advertising public reforms
What you do is not your commission
Stipulating basic norms

Neither laws nor the cause
Make you feel at a loss

[Chorus]
