Keeping more than pain, internal pain
Forbidden words
Losing more than life
When you die
Don't let them reboot your mind
Comprehension comes through the bleeding hands
The curtain falls
Exposing confrontation

Repressed
Tremendously terrified staying reduced and affected
Transfixed
Continually optimized staying confused and neglected

Moving slow and hard to get to know
Misleading facts
The system's on
You've got it â you hate it

[Chorus:]
Make the principles work
Get the ignorance blocked
Hear the impulses talk
Have the attitude rocked
Make the principles work
Get the ignorance blocked
Hear the impulses talk
You wish to meet with complications
You are the one to protest
All the things they gonna put inside you
Will you get along?

Rising up again to fall again
Offensive thoughts
Turning back at once to see the end
Looking into the day
Comprehension comes through the bleeding hands
The curtain falls
Exposing confrontation

[Chorus]
Make the principles work
Get the ignorance blocked
Hear the impulses talk
Make the principles work
Get the ignorance blocked
Hear the impulses talk
Have the attitude rocked
Intensive/ Reactive
Intensive/ Reactive

The case is obviously falsified
Being increased and effective
Expressed and properly organized
Being diverse and objective
Lifelong days
Lifelong days
