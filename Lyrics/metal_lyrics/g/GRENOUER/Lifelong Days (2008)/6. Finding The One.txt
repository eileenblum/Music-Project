New ways, new ways into reality
Nothing before and nothing behind
Stay well, stay in placid simplicity
Nowhere to live and nowhere to hide

New ways, new ways out of reality
So much before and plenty behind
Check files for superior capacities
Regarding the world identified

Nothing's gonna set us apart
Nothing's gonna ruin the belief
Nothing's gonna set us apart
Nothing's gonna ruin the belief

[Chorus:]
Find the one
The theory's gone
Find the one
All efforts are done

Confidential concentration renovates my property
Occupation in relation to obscure misery
What a big rout
Wanna turn around
Wanna be about
Wanna bout

[Chorus]

Find the one
Finding me

True ways, true ways into reality
Finding the one and missing a chance
Fly fast through the visual galaxy
Throwing the light and dying at once

Nothing's gonna save us at last
Everything stains at the feet
Nothing's gonna save us at last
Everything stains at the feet
