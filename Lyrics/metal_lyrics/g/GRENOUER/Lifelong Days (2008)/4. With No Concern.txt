Waste all the time
I don't have
Lose my sweet home
I don't mind
Coming down easily
Calming down easily

[Chorus:]
Never completely recovered
And giving my freedom away
With no concern
Never completely recovered
And giving my freedom away
Till the last drop

Less lights faint pale
There's no light
Read the grey sky
Getting dark
Breaking ice of my heart
Scratching soul of my heart

[Chorus]

The sign of the events
There's more behind it
Unwritten words that fail
To flash through the mind

Showing the range
Showing the range of my attitude
Riding the wheel
Riding the wheel of my destiny

[Chorus]

I don't dare to find
I don't wish to come across and
Manage to survive
I don't long to save my efforts
Wired
Wired
Waste all the time
Read the grey sky
