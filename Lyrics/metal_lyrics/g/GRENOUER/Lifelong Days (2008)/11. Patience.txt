Troubling you
When it's over
I will never make you care
Wish you well
Being someone
Your ridiculous affair

[Chorus:]
Lost and found without fear
I will gladly outstay
Safe and sound with you
I will hardly be your mate

I will gladly be your mate

Asking why
Only asking
You will never say a word
A silken touch
Gentle motions
Wanna lay my hands on you

[Chorus]
