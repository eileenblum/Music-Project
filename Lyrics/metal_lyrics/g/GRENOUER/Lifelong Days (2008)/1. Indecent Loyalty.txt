Watch out
You wanna come up to me
Looking cute
In the mood
Doing well in your dimension
Come on
And separate you from me
Staying tuned
Knowing good how to play your combination
Attention
Move on and push me into the maze
Telling me I am to blame
I am the slave of your reactions
Take my breath away
Make me psycho day by day
Fulfilling all your wants

[Chorus:]
Indecency is here
Indecency is here

Lose you
If I don't follow your rules
Painful kicks
Dirty tricks
I'm being fooled by your compassion
Drive me nuts again
Showing wilderness of lust
Indecently
Unfaithfully

[Chorus]

Cheated and displeased
I am down on my knees

Come on
Indecent looks work fine
Unfair tears go by
Hold on
Deceptive words fly high
Move on
Unfaithfully
You will get me
