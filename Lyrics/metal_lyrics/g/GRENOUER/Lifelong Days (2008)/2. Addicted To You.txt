Stressed
Stressed and afraid
Badly hurt in dismay

As long as torrents flow
I hesitate at the door
Whenever fears grow
I enter into your soul

Voices from the past
Wait news flying fast

[Chorus:]
The final rise
Driving off a cliff
Agonized
Half dead

Stay
Stay unsafe
Count minutes of the day

You deep into your soul
And never open the door

Addicted
Addicted to you

[Chorus:]
The final rise
Commonly deceased
Passed away
Gone dead

Addicted
Addicted to you
Addicted
Addicted to me

[Chorus:]
The final rise
Driving off a cliff
Agonized
Gone
The final rise
Commonly deceased
Passed away
Dead
