Stab the knife between the teeth
Operate with broken knees
Unexpected raids
Spray apart in thousand drops
Try to run on creaking bones
Unexpected raids
Demonstrate the dirty deeds
Violate all theories
Unexpected raids

Ripping skin for self-protection now
Flaming hours
Chasing demons
Feeling pangs of pain
Restless chaos

[Chorus:]
I'll start
I am all for
Walking away in someone's shoes
Finding the way to me

Interfere with common peace
Navigate through tendencies
Unexpected raids
Hurry up to seize and fetch
Snatch and win the privilege
Unexpected raids
Concentrated into hatred
Dead asleep and dead awake
Unexpected raids
Flaming hours

[Chorus:]
I'll start
I am all for
Walking away in someone's shoes
Finding the way to me
I'll stop
I am all for
Staying alive in a distant place
Hiding away from me

[Chorus:]
I'll stop
I am all for
Staying alive in a distant place
Hiding away from me
Walking away
Finding the way
Staying alive in a distant place
Hiding away from me
