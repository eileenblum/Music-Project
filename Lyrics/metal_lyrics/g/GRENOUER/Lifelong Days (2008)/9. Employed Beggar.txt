Working day by day will set me free
Doing things okay is what I need
Finding the mistakes can save my head
If I watch the things I don't care a shit
Helping other mates is not my task
I prefer to sleep when someone asks
I spare my time and will to hesitate
I don't hurry up but I never come late

Am I still the same
Working day by day?
Can I go insane
If I quit the game?

[Chorus:]
I am the same
I am the happiest mate
I am the same
If no one is here

Work still, sleep still and think as agreed
Demonstrating obedience and wish to repeat
Stay calm, sit straight and know how to fit
Operating with confidence and don't change a thing

Reading rules aloud will suit the boss
Taking careful notes can save the course
Now and then I check and look around
Nothing's gonna leave my goddamn mouth

Am I still the same,
Working day by day?

Back to think as agreed

Work still, sleep still and think as agreed
Operating with confidence and don't change a thing
Ah, if I go insane now

[Chorus]
I am the same
I am the happiest mate
I am the same
If no one is here
I am insane
I am the craziest mate
I am insane
And no one is here
