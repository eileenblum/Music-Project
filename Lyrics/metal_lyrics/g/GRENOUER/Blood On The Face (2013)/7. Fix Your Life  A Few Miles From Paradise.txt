Feel the night
Before you open your eyes
Before you raise your head
Before the magic is gone

Find your soul
You want to find your soul
In your dreams
You hope to fix your life

[Chorus:]
A few miles from paradise
Farewell to heart sores
Take steps to realize
That you are almost there

Up and down
But every time it gets worse
Youâre gonna hit the ground
Internal splendor is lost

Take this pain
You have to take this pain
Day by day
Youâll never fix your life

[Chorus:]
A few miles from paradise
Farewell to heart sores
Take steps to realize
That you are almost there
The last forlorn attempt
You have been alone
Youâve paid your body rent
Angels guide you home

A lifelong movie starring you
Still days of sadness sharing truth

[Chorus:]
The last forlorn attempt
You have been alone
Youâve paid your bloody rent
Angels guide you home
