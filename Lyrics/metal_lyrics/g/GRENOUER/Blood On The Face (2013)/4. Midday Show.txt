Take a moment of reflection
Take a moment for yourself
Wake up
Wake up to sunlight
Welcome to the real world

[Chorus:]
Midday show
Years of life lost
Void inside your soul
You have turned it off

Dirty words and filthy phrases
Broken promises of wealth
Sadness
Sadness and madness
In the garden of delights

[Chorus:]
Youâve missed the midday show
Years of life lost
Void inside your soul
You have turned it off
Latest stories
Dreams and hopes
Screams and nightmares
Youâve turned them off

Wakinâ up in the morninâ gotta thank God
Cuz my Televisor channel shows a hot bod
Hot chicks and Glamur talkinâ "Dom 2"
Bullshit like the remnants of a cattle prod
I know itâs bad I know I shouldnât sit and watch
But Iâm soakinâ in a tidal wave of Fendi and Versace
Livinâ on the boulevard of Slomanyie Mechty
Thereâs so many missed dreams, smother them in tit'ki

Treat her right, get a sitter for the night
Gulyatâ like itâs the last night of your life
Or get out on the streets, meet somebody random
Take 'em by the hand and make 'em understand, son

And like my mama said it take a lotta frittatas
And a bottle of water to wash down an enchillada
But if you gotta Regatta of singinâ heads from Estrada
Them boys is gonna beat you like a fuckinâ Pinata

[Chorus:]
Youâve missed the bullshit show
Years of life lost
Void inside your soul
(Midday showdawn)
You have turned it off
Latest stories
Dreams and hopes
Screams and nightmares
Youâve turned them off
