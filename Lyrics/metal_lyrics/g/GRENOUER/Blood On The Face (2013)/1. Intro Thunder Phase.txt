Summer heat
Aggressive sun
Withered trees
Reduced air
Swollen eyes
Vibrating pulse
The yellow haze lingers on

[Chorus:]
Shaking the sands of silence
Watching the fields of fire
Opening arms for a final embrace
Taking a trip into space

Aching feet
Colossal wounds
Burning lips
Compressed ribs
Twisted nerves
Distorted light
Waking dreams wonât go away

[Chorus:]
Shaking the sands of silence
Dipping below horizons
Saying farewell to sorrow and pain
Taking a stroll down the memory lane

The sands of silence
I'm saying farewell
I've lost myself
Down the memory lane

[Chorus:]
Shaking the sands of silence
Watching the fields of fire
Opening arms for a final embrace
Taking a trip into space
