Driving along a deserted road
The wind cools my head

Driving alone
Yes, I am driving alone
Yes, I am driving alone again
This road will come to an end

Driving along this deserted road
Driving along this deserted road
Whenever a town appears
I am going to make the last stop

[Chorus:]
I am staying on the highway
I am waiting
I am alone with my despair
I am not scared
This is my home

Living alone
Yes, Iâm living in solitude
Yes, I am living alone again
The road has reached its end

Driving alone for miles on end
I travelled around this barren land
Maybe itâs only a vision
Maybe Iâll see again

[Chorus:]
I am staying on the highway
I am waiting
I am alone with my despair
I am not scared
This is my home

In the midst of deadspace mist
I refused a poisoned kiss
In the midst of deadspace mist
I am staying
Dirty lights blur before my eyes
Scary sounds of the night
Dirty lights blur before my eyes
The world is trembling

I have no story to tell
Iâll never turn back with my despair

[Chorus:]
I am not staying on the highway
I am not waiting
I am alone with my despair
I am scared
This is my home

I am going to make the last stop
