Heavy rain outside
I am lost in desperation
Thunder cracks in the sky
Cruel trials and tribulations

Obscure nights
Uneasy sense of demise
Obscure nights
Anxiety ruins my life

[Chorus:]
Alien landscapes on the wall
Brain fever

I will never return
Iâll go into the deep
Painful seizures occur
My last vacation is almost over

Obscure nights
Uneasy sense of demise
Obscure nights
Anxiety ruins my life

[Chorus:]
Alien landscapes on the wall
Brain fever
Beams of moonlight on the floor
A silver river

Tears forever cloaked in the pouring rain
My brain is shocked

[Chorus:]
Alien landscapes on the wall
Brain fever
Beams of moonlight on the floor
A silver river

Brain fever
