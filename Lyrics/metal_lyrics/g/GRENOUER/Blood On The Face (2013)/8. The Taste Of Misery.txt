Problems without answers
I cannot sleep
Troubles and concerns
Follow me

Grief and hatred
Love and loss
Lie behind my ruined hopes
On the streets of Restless City
Of my deep regrets

[Chorus:]
Donât shape my destiny
Spiders in the bath
The bitter taste of misery
Voices from the past

Medications do not work
I hate those pills
An utter failure to connect
All my dreams are silly movies and Iâm a hero
I am somewhere else

[Chorus:]
Donât shape my destiny
Spiders in the bath
The bitter taste of misery
Voices from the past

[Chorus:]
Donât shape my destiny
Spiders in the bath
The bitter taste of misery
Voices from the past
The taste of misery
Phantoms in the brain
Superstitious ignorance
Anger and disdain
