Answer the telephone
I know you are at home
You are my fear
Canât wait to hear you
Cast a fairy glance
Take me in your arms
Iâm tired to death
And short of breath

[Chorus:]
Youâre a big mistake
I donât need to come across
Youâre a restless flood
Everything falls down
I see no sun

Bring me slight relief
Give me a chance to live
Go down the drain
Take my escape
Destined to play your game
Ready to crack my brains
Iâm sick at heart
I fall apart

[Chorus:]
Youâre a big mistake
I donât need to come across
Youâre a restless flood
Everything falls down
I see no sun

I see no sun
I see no light

[Chorus:]
Youâre a big mistake
I just want to make away
Youâre a restless flood
Why do I come back
To see no sun?
