The smell of rapture in the air
Overcast with burning clouds
Blades of fury and despair
Broken bones and broken hearts

Youâve turned the world against me
Youâve turned the world upside down
Iâve no reason to survive

[Chorus:]
Between the worlds of scattered minds
Blood on the face

I am a prisoner of fate
A lonely island in the sea
The violent power of my hate
Turns me on
Glows deep within me

Youâve turned the world against me
Youâve turned the world upside down
Iâve no reason to survive

[Chorus:]
Between the worlds of scattered minds
Blood on the face
Iâve left my heart behind
I wonât survive

[Chorus:]
Between the worlds of scattered minds
Blood on the face
Iâve left my heart behind
I wonât survive
