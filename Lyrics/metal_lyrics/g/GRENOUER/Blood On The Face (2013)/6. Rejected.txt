Freedom is not happiness
You never know where you can go
Youâre left to be alone

Busted, thereâs no harmony
I have no faith, I have no principles
Iâve lost control, Iâve lost my memory
Somewhere in the past
Somewhere in the pit of life

Memory erased
âCause Iâm rejected
Misery and pain
Iâm not accepted
I tried to be myself
And lost control
I hoped to win the world
Without fortune

[Chorus:]
Life was full of passion
Time shows no compassion
Why do I feel rejected and wasted?

Headaches every day
I go insane, I have no tolerance
I rise and fall and lose my confidence
Itâs hard to realize
I never had my own world

Never said a word
I canât remember
Never bet against
I just surrendered
Never spoke to friends
Iâve never had one
Never showed concern
Just kept pretending

[Chorus:]
Life was full of passion
Time shows no compassion
Why do I feel rejected and wasted?

Wake me up
Warm my heart
Make me live
Make me breathe

Without fear thereâs no strength
Nothing happens
Without fear I am not myself
In the darkness

Is there no forgiveness
I surrender

[Chorus:]
Life was full of passion
Time shows no compassion
Why do I feel rejected?
I surrender
