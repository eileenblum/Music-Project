The golden age of democracy
Carries out atrocities
Common virtues that they choose to preach
Destinations that you fail to reach

[Chorus:]
Bad faith
Strained silence
Fast lane
Will you stay away?

Golden years brought by hurricane
Purple clouds pull you down again
Find the world as never seen before
Got to make the words you can ignore

[Chorus:]
Bad faith
Strained silence
Fast lane
Will you stay away?
Wrong place
Veil of fire
Deep cuts
Keep your mouths shut

Get the message
Get excited
Get the message
Get excited

[Chorus:]
Bad faith
Strained silence
Fast lane
Will you stay away?
Wrong place
Veil of fire
Deep cuts
Keep your mouths shut
