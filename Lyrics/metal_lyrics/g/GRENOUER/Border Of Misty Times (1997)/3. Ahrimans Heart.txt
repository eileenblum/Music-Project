To save this world
Transgress yourself
Ahriman's heart retains might
Sinister spells
Sorcery dodge

The shroud is swayed by the wind
Black monolith city
White flames in the burial-vault
Delirium is steady and dire

Mystical concentration
Severe asceticism
Knowledge and power as aim
Subject of sacrifice
Certain religiosity
Disincarnation for ritual
Testimonial chaos
Scions of mayhem
Lyre without strings
Let their sovereign play
Rule over reasons
Play over minds
Filled with compassion and odium
Mask on the face
Blood-spelled letters
Read between the lines

To make a step
Subdue the fear
Ahriman's heart, the invocation
Temple of sin
Boundless abyss

Divine diamond

Muddle force, imitation
People - worms, worms are silt
Spitting snakes, spreading steam
Pleated dress, wrinkled face
Senile hand holding warder
Dampness, cold, sensual myriad

Messiah, you've got to believe into another messiah

Mystical concentration
Severe asceticism
Knowledge and power as aim
Subject of sacrifice
Certain religiosity
Disincarnation for ritual
Testimonial chaos
Scions of mayhem
Lyre without strings
Let their sovereign play
Rule over reasons
Play over minds
Filled with compassion and odium
Mask on the face
Blood-spelled letters
Read between the lines
