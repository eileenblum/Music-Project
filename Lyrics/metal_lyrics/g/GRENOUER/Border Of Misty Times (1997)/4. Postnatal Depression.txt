Prolapse imbues disconcerting flow
Letargized burial of pride
Lashing reconstruction uterus reluctance
Muffled curse, self-seduction

Indian chief smoking his pipe

Rectal drainage pericarp's release
Placentized natural bliss
Being in labour being abused
Painkilling just refused
Primitive decontamination

Section with a knife
Hands are holding tight
Struggling to break lose away
Biting someone's flesh
Stout stitch piercing through
Tiny body 's almost blue
Make it breathe - obsolete relation

Indian tribe smoking their pipe

Talent to survive overstraining trials
Feelings leaving easy mind
Rancour 's turning grief
Ovary is cold
