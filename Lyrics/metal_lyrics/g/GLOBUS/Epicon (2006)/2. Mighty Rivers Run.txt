I am your Mother
In my womb you've seen a universe
Precious life, now I bring you into my world
Fear, love and pain are your guides

Can I provide a sanctuary to shield you from a world that preys

Angels from heaven pray see your children through the day
For knowing the coming tomorrow's ways

Demons await where the mighty rivers run
Children, sail on!

Head for home
Through the wild night, sail on...

...Mother, will you keep me, hold me?
Father, be there, strong for me

Demons await where the mighty rivers run
Children, sail on!

Holy angels, rest on high
For tomorrow, sanctify!
