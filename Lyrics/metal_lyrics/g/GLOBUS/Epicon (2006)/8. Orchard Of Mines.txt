Don't taint this ground with the color of the past,
Are the sounds in bloom with you?
'Cause you feel like an orchard of mines
Just take one step at a time

And you seem to break like time,
So fragile on the inside, you climb these grapevines
Would you look now unto this pit of me on the ground
And you wander through these to climb these grapevines....

I'll say it to be proud; won't have my life turn upside down
Says the man with some, with some gold forged plan
Of life so incomplete, like weights strapped around my feet
Tread careful one step at a time

And you seem to break like time,
So fragile on the inside you climb these grapevines
Would you look now unto this pit of me on the ground
And you wander through these to climb these grapevines

To know, to feel, to play me once again
Do you denote from what we feel
Do you not know, I see you play the game
Do you denote.....

La flama riposa
La ombra dispare
La noce immortale
La voce murmure

To know, to feel, to play me once again
Do you denote.....
Do you not know, I see you play the game
Denote.....
