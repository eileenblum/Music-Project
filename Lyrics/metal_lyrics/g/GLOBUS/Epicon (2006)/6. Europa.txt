From Agincourt to Waterloo
Poitiers and then Anjou
The Roses War, the Hundred Years
Through battlefields of blood and tears

From Bosworth Field to Pointe Du Hoc
Stalingrad and the siege of York
The bloody turf of Gallipoli
Had no effect on the killing spree

Bannockburn to Austerlitz
The fall of France and the German Blitz
The cruelest of atrocities,
Europa's blood is borne of these

Heaven help in all our battles
Heaven see love
Heaven help us

Bolshevisks and feudal lords
Chivalry to civil wars
Fascist rule and genocide
Now we face the rising tide

Of new crusades, religious wars
Insurgents imported to our shores
The western world, gripped in fear
The mother of all battles here

Heaven help in all our battles
Heaven see love
Heaven help us
Avant hier, avons Ãªtre
DÃ©ja demain, (nous) sommes Ã©clairÃ©e!

All glory, all honor
Victory is upon us
Our saviour, fight evil
Send armies to defend us

Empires built, and nations burned
Mass graves remain unturned
Descendants of the dispossessed
Return with bombs strapped to their chests

There's hate for life, and death in hate
Emerging from the new caliphate
The victors of this war on fear
Will rule for the next thousand years

All glory, all honor
Victory is upon us
Our saviour, fight evil
Send armies to defend us

Europa, Europa
Find better days before us
In kindness, in spirit
Lead us to a greater calling!

Leningrad, Berlin wall
march on Rome, Byzantium's fall
Lightning war, Dresden nights,
drop the bomb, end this fight!
Never again!!
