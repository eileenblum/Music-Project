[At the beginning we probably can hear the choir of Menashe Levran Singers]

[Terry Wood]

Mother, Father - hear my song
Look at your creation
Brother, where did we go wrong?
Where is our salvation?

Lying naked on the floor
Dying of starvation
In the darkness we explore
Find Illumination

All day, all night
Give a little bit of your love
Back to yourself
It's all right
If we all give a little bit
We can make it

This is our world
This is how we made it
And now is the hour
Only we can save it
Don't be afraid
Love will light the way
The spark that lives in the heart
Of everyone will become
Like a flame
Like the sun

Mother, Father - I'm your
Son, Sister, Brother, Daughter
I am you and we are one
Like the mighty water

Feel the music fill your soul
Feel the love vibration
We are golden, we are whole
We are love's creation

All day, all night
Give a little bit of your love
Back to the earth
It's all right
If we all give a little bit
We can make it

[Sirsa Shekim, Renee Massey]

Here is our world
This is how we made it
And now is the hour
Only we can save it
Don't be alone
Love will light the way
The spark that lives in the heart
Of everyone - will become
Like a flame
Like the sun

This our world
This is how we made it
We all have the power
Only we can save it
We won't be alone
Love will light the way
The spark that lives in the heart
Of everyone - will become
Like a flame
Like the sun

[Terry Wood]

Give a little bit of your love back

[Northwest Sinfonia]

Magna est veritas
Magnus ab integra
In cor unum credo
In salve sat credo

[Terry Wood]

We can make it
