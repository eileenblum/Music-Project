Goodbye Earth, hello Moon
Fancy meeting you so soon
I'm taking leave, taking flight
Leave the universe in light

Goodbye Sun, hello Void
Strap me to this asteroid
Shoot me far, throw me deep
Let me find the golden sleep

One million black holes in my head
Swiss cheese brain, those cells are dead
No carbon matter goes to waste
I'll dissipate in endless space

Lost my hair, shed my skin
Look just like a skeleton
Numb to pain, no appetite
Nothing ever felt so right

Close my eyes, drift away
Past the walls, across the bay
I'll take some friends, hurl them ahead
This ward could use the empty beds
