You don't believe in love and war
You found the truth 
You can't ignore
And all the hopes for your conforming have all crumbled now

You take the route 
You've been forewarned
You've been cast out and felt the scorn
And all the lies just mount like broken glass upon the ground

How many words have been spoken about a dream that still survives
And to keep the hope alive
How many promises broken by the ones that still delight
In the spreading of the lie

You don't believe in the Holy Grail
You've seen those dreams get so derailed
And all those words like thunder crashing through a broken sky

How many words have been spoken about a dream that still survives
And to keep the hope alive
How many lives have been broken by the ones that still delight
In the spreading of the lie

One journey ends, one life begins
One truth will find you free again
One journey ends, one life begins
One truth will be revealed again

You don't believe in love and war
You've seen those fears played out before
And every heart embattled lies in pieces on the ground
We send our boys to distant shores
We cannot tame them anymore
The day will come when we have no more lives to squander

How many souls have been taken to the mountaintop and down
To the valley once again
How many lives are forsaken by the demons at the gate
Teach the child within to hate

One journey ends, one life begins
In truth you'll find you're free again
One journey ends, one life begins
One truth will make you heal again

One morning breaks, one night will end
One truth is all you can defend
One morning breaks, one night will end
Break from this world and live again

One journey ends, one life begins
One truth will rise to heal again
One journey ends, one life begins
One truth will make you free again

You don't believe in love and war
You found the truth you can't ignore
