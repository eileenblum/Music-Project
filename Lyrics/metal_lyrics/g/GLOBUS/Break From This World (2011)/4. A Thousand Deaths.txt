In excelsius benedictus
Blessed angels hear our prayer
Immortales resurrectus
Let thy whisper dry our tears
In excelsius benedictus
Blessed angels hear our prayer
Immortales resurrectus
Let thy promise calm our fears
Hosanna, hosanna, aeterna
Holy we'll arrive forevermore

[Arabic chant]

Two lovers, two forces of love and hate
I pull you, you pull me, we complicate
Unlikely defendants in a lovers' trial
And facing a world in complete denial
From London to Aden, the stage is set
Two cultures in conflict, love under threat

And I'd breathe in fire and ash
All for the sake of love
And I'd die a thousand deaths
All for the sake of love
And I'd breathe in fire and ash
All for the sake of love
And I'd die a thousand deaths
All for the sake of love

[Arabic chant]

The fires of the righteous will always burn
And turn us on each other until we learn
To harness the power of our distinction
And throw off these shackles of bad religion
One thousand and one nights change everything
You are my scheherazade, I am your king

In excelsius benedictus
Immortalis lacunam
In extremis abyss domus
Introitus gloriam

And I'd breathe in fire and ash
All for the sake of love
And I'd die a thousand deaths
All for the sake of love
And I'd breathe in fire and ash
All for the sake of love
And I'd die a thousand deaths
All for the sake of love

In excelsius benedictus
Immortalis lacunam
In extremis abyss domus
Introitus gloriam

The last hope for justice is fleeting fast
Salvation, extinction, we're free at last

In excelsis
Immortalis
In extremis

And I'd die a thousand deaths
All for the sake of love
All for the sake of love

In excelsius benedictus
Blessed angels hear our prayer

[Arabic chant]
