Now have we seen this light for the last time
They're turning back the clock and we won't survive
On just hope this time

They slowly break us down from the inside
And force a way of life we don't recognize
And free will has died

We take our breath for the last time
We'll give it one more cry before they burn a hole
In our hearts again

We saw it coming, this black parade when will it end
Oh you and I both know, this black parade on fear depends
We can fight it but we can't pretend

The turbans reign supreme over virtue
You cannot lift your veil or speak the truth
They promise nothing but keep that bar held high for you

We saw it coming, this black parade, will forge ahead
Oh you and I both know, this black parade
The demon's edge
We will fight it with our dying breath

And now they've pumped the masses full of rage
We're going to light some fires
We're going to burn the stage
The lightning is coming, the marchers will fall
Fall
