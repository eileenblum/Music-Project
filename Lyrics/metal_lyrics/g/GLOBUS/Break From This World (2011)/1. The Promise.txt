One sails the seas of life and believes
The storms will lead you home
These open roads will call you with the promise
You'll walk the Earth alone

We lopen 
We vallen
We leren, we falen, we staan
We vechten 
We helpen
Haten, luisteren, en gaan
Beminnen 
We duiken 
We dansen, we lachen, ontluiken 
Verwonderen
We hopen
We bidden, verlaten, vergaan

I live in a dream
With open eyes I breathe again
I see all your fears
Together we can feel 
We can heal
And take the road less traveled on
To here, in the new
Like diamonds we will shine
We will rise
Two hearts, where souls are free again
We live

We sail the seas of life and believe
The storms will lead us home
These open roads will call us with the promise
We walk the Earth alone

We lopen
We vallen
We leren, we falen, we staan
We vechten
We helpen
Haten, luisteren, en gaan
Beminnen
We duiken
We dansen, we lachen, ontluiken
Verwonderen
We hopen
We bidden, verlaten, vergaan
We lopen
We vallen

This dream is a universe
And every soul shines
Where the darkness turns into light
I take you to fly with me
And follow the way
There will always be a new day

There will always be a new day
