See me take my bones
And I'm heading for the exits
I can't stick around

This life's been hard
And I can't see the sense in fighting it anymore
Can't you let me go
Won't you show me the door

'Cause I've made mistakes
That have hurt the ones I've loved
And I've thrown them under the bus
One too many times

There can be no redemption for a sinner such as I
Won't you wish me to the cornfield now
Won't you help me stop living a lie

So here I am in the corner of a dark room
The same way I began
Alone with these mournful thoughts
And a loaded gun in my hand

But a foolish part of me
Still holds out for a shred of humanity
For a queen in a robe or a knight on a steed
Can't you see that I'm just a child on his knees

So save me from fear and pain
And love will rain on me
Save me today 
Before tomorrow finds me at rest

Save me from fear and pain
And love come down and rain on me
Save me today
For tomorrow will find me at rest

Now I'm standing alone in the moment of truth
As the judgement's handed down
And my feet are scarred from the broken glass
Strewn across the ground

Then you come to my side 
And only to you I confide
That I've been battered and shattered and bruised and abused
For the very very last time
Won't you help me, just

Save me from fear and pain
And love reign o'er me
Save me, Save me today
For tomorrow will find me at rest

Save me from fear and pain
And love will rain on me
Save me today
For tomorrow, find me at rest
Find me at rest
