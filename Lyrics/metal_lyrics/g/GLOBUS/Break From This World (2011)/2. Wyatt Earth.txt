Looking down at this barren land
Once known as home before
Destruction, all the world
It's an ending we have brought

The world we wrote a million times before
And what we allow to break this all down
The world we broke a million times before
What should have been stunned is now all struck dumb

Cities they fell, life's a choke
On bittersweet warnings took for a joke
Misspent days, spent in a haze
Pumped from our factories into our graves
They must know that they're so close to bringing nothing
So they show
They've brought success at bringing nothing

The world we wrote a million times before
And what we allow to break this all down
The world we broke a million times before
What should have been stunned is now all struck dumb

Struck dumb

Still looking down at this broken land
Once grass has turned to sand
Hindsight's broke, sky is smoke
We've passed this point of doubt
They must know that they're so close to bringing nothing
So they show 
They've brought success at bringing nothing

The world we wrote a million times before
And what we allow to break this all down
The world we broke a million times before
What should have been stunned is now all struck dumb

The world we wrote a million times before
And what we allow to break this all down
The world we broke a million times before
What should have been stunned is now all struck dumb
