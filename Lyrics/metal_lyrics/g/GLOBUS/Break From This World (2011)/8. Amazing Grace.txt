Well they cut me down and threw me out
'Cause I didn't fit in with the crowd
'Cause I bang the drum too slow and out of time
And the stuff I think is not allowed

Well they cut me off from all the ways
That could give my soul a chance to feel
And the tea leaves in the wind are pointing south
As an angel comes in time to heal

Amazing grace
Comes to embrace
In a world filled with rage
With the love and the light of her face
Amazing grace

Well I'm fighting off a heavy heart
But I got no one but me to blame
And the medication tries to do its part
But it's you who puts me back in the game

Amazing grace
Comes to embrace
In a world filled with rage
With the love and the light of her face
Amazing grace

Well they cut me up and left me scarred
On the fringes of my sanity
But a particle of light cracks through the dark
And delivers your humanity

Amazing grace
Comes to embrace
In a world filled with rage
With the love and the light of her face
Amazing grace

Amazing grace
Comes to embrace
In a world filled with rage
With the love and the light of her face
Amazing grace
