You fool
Who do you think you are?
You fool
You're not the brightest star

Stuck in your hellhole
And you can't climb up
Fight your existence
But you're nailed to the wall

Can't you see
How time slips by
You want to be like me
But your words don`t rhyme

Stuck in your hellhole
And you can't climb up
Fight your existence
But you're nailed to the wall

Temples of gold falling down
Temples of gold fall to the ground

The unknown
Is the most you fear
Turn to stone
Just cry your bitter tears

Stuck in your hellhole
And you can't climb up
Fight your existence
But you're nailed to the wall

Temples of gold falling down
Temples of gold fall to the ground

Right from the start
You did have a choice
You choose the devils daughter
And you lost your voice

Stuck in your hellhole
And you can't climb up
Fight your existence
But you're nailed to the wall

Temples of gold falling down
Temples of gold fall to the ground
