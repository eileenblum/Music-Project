Come take my hand
I'll lead you to the unknown land
Haunted by the evil within
Mesmerized for all the good that it brings

Blind to the truth
If you follow the ancient fools
Haunted by the evil within
Mesmerized for all the good that it brings

Black as night
Filled with anger
Rising high above this land
With second sight
I will search for him
No rest until I find
The evil within us

I don't leave any stones unturned
Just wait and see there's something to be learned
Haunted by the evil within
Mesmerized for all the good that it brings

Black as night
Filled with anger
Rising high above this land
With second sight
I will search for him
No rest until I find
The evil within us
