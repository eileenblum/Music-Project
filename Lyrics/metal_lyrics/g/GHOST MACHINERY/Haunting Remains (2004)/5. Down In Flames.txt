Strange that you don't feel no shame
Of how you satisfied your hunger for blood
I only feel the pain
But my misery loves the company

Dreamers can be bought
By selling them lies
I can hear your words
But your eyes you can't hide

Down in flames
You will burn
Down in flames
Never will return

Knowledge brings the pain
But things stays the same forever
There's no end in sight
I loose the track of time
(We've got to) rise up
Together

Dreamers can be bought
By selling them lies
I can hear your words
But your eyes you can't hide

Down in flames
You will burn
Down in flames
Never will return

In the house of lies flames grow high
No returning back
Can't see the real world your emotions stirred
Your future's looking black

Dreamers can be bought
By selling them lies
I can hear your words
But your eyes you can't hide

Down in flames
You will burn
Down in flames
Never will return
