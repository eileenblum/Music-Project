Stupidity reigns
When you open your mouth
Feels like I'm dying
Just want to scream and shout

Fatal mistake
When I called you my friend
No rules apply
You're an evil sent

Before the storm is raging
The shelter you seek
And when the guns starts blazing
They're not aiming at your feet

Heaven or hell
There's no place in between
Fire and ice
Only elements inside your mind

I'm out in the cold
Trying to look inside
Speechless, helpless, mindless
That's who I am

You think that you're the king
And the ruler of all
I've got news for you
We'll be witnessing the fall

Before the storm is raging
The shelter you seek
And when the guns starts blazing
They're not aiming at your feet

Heaven or hell
There's no place in between
Fire and ice
Only elements inside your mind

Can't you see you're not immortal
Not the king to be
Can't you see that you're not the chosen
Or ever reigning majesty

You'll find the truth
In the mirror within your soul
Rescued by the unknown soldier
But your stories will be told

Before the storm is raging
The shelter you seek
And when the guns starts blazing
They're not aiming at your feet

Heaven or hell
There's no place in between
Fire and ice
Only elements inside your mind
