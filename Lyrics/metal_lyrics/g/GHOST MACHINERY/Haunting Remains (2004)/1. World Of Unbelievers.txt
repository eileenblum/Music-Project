You caged yourself to the life full of sorrow
Lost and confused with no hope of tomorrow
Stranger to all like a thief in the night
Chosen to be on your own

There is no reflection in the mirror of your time
Innocence born wiped away your past life
Sky`s turned to black there's no signs of light
And all the hearts turn to stone

You tried your wings
And they got badly burned
Where's the missing link
Who's voice can`t be heard

Into the world of unbelievers
You are bound to crash and burn
Heart in this world of unbelievers
Your voice can`t be heard

Surrounded by insanity and cruelty
This train of madness you got fooled in
Stranger to all like a thief in the night
Chosen to be on your own

You tried your wings
And they got badly burned
Where's the missing link
Who's voice can`t be heard

Into the world of unbelievers
You are bound to crash and burn
Heart in this world of unbelievers
Your voice can`t be heard
