You're shadow dancer
You don't know my game
I'll let you live
Because it suits me fine
Just enough the rope
To keep you satisfied
With my strings
Your hands are tied

If you think that you are better than me
Why you're not in my position?

Fallen angels cry
Never saw the signs

Needles to point out
I'm in control
Without me
You'll lose it all
I am the master
And you are my slave
Just enough the rope
To make you stay

If you think that you are better than me
Why you're not in my position?

Fallen angels cry
Never saw the signs

I have prove you wrong
So many times
You don't explain me why
Now I can hear a bells of death
And they're calling for you

If you think that you are better than me
Why you're not in my position?

Fallen angels cry
Never saw the signs
