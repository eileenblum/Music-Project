Again it's knocking my door
I can't take it no more
Too much is overkill
Falling into a deep void
But not by my own choice
Too much is overkill
Emotions too fulfilled

The closer you get
The more I drift away
For the reasons I can't explain
My demands for privacy
Is it too much?
I hope that you finally can understand
Before the promised land

I've had my share of pain
To last the one lifetime
Bloody stains
That won't wash away with the rain

In my darkest hour
I reach for the light
To give me the power
I need in this fight
But you turned your
Back and walked away

My shortcomings as a human
You point me
But your own reflection in the mirror
You just can't see
Fatherless child as I am
The endless line of the children of the damned
we don't get the helping hand

I've had my share of pain
To last the one lifetime
Bloody stains
That won't wash away with the rain

In my darkest hour
I reach for the light
To give me the power
I need in this fight
But you turned your
Back and walked away
From the pain of knowing
That you don't care
I rise like the Phoenix
Soaring to the air
Darkest hour
My cross to bear

Who holds the answers to our lives
The recipe for the painless times
If The Oracle you're the one to find
I bow to you you're next to God

In my darkest hour
I reach for the light
To give me the power
I need in this fight
But you turned your
Back and walked away
From the pain of knowing
That you don't care
I rise like the Phoenix
Soaring to the air
Darkest hour
My cross to bear
