Stop your deep moral preaches
And get off your high horse
Decent from the ivory towers
Welcome to my life

Out of time and out of place
You're retired from this world
Get out from the golden palace
Welcome to my life

This kingdom of madness
I lay in your arms
From this kingdom of sadness
You're so far apart

Blinded eyes
You can't see how the world is turning
Blinded eyes
You're so far away from my life

Inside you there is darkness there is light
Unable to control who`ll win the fight
I hate to live in these days of no trust
Welcome to my life

This kingdom of madness
I lay in your arms
From this kingdom of sadness
You're so far apart

Blinded eyes
You can't see how the world is turning
Blinded eyes
You're so far away from my life
