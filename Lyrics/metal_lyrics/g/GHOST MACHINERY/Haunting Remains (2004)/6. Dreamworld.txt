I hear the sound
Of a distant thunder
Scene from the window
Tells me I'm far away from my home

Now I got time to make
The journey to my mind
I'm closing my eyes
And enter my world of dreams

Don't suffer in silence
Just scream your need out loud
Because time passes by us
If we're too afraid to shout

At the gates of a labyrinth
I wonder who I am
Am I trouble in paradise
Or a man who fits the plan

Behind each door
There's new mystery to find
Solve the problems one by one
And break the chains that bind you

Don't suffer in silence
Just scream your need out loud
Because time passes by us
If we're too afraid to shout

I'm living in a dreamworld of my own
Where nobody can tell me I'm wrong
This is the dreamworld of my own
Here is my heart here is my home

When darkness surrounds me
I look for a place to hide
From the mysteries of my dreamworld
I find the piece of mind

Don't suffer in silence
Just scream your need out loud
Because time passes by us
If we're too afraid to shout

I'm living in a dreamworld of my own
Where nobody can tell me I'm wrong
This is the dreamworld of my own
Here is my heart here is my home
