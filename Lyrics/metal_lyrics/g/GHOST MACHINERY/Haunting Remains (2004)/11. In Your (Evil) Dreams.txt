Room full of people
But no familiar face
Distorted images on the walls
Kneel before the mask
Of the forbidden god
Distant echoes in the halls

Am I dreaming
Or is this for real?
I scream
Scars so deep
Impossible them to heal
I don't want to be

In your evil dreams
Inside this masquerade of lies
In your evil dreams
Inside this masquerade of lies

Threshold of madness
I passed a long ago
Sickening silence hurts my ears
Ruins of a king stand before my eyes
Castles crumbled down
In the ancient years

Am I dreaming
Or is this for real?
I scream
Scars so deep
Impossible them to heal
I don`t want to be

In your evil dreams
Inside this masquerade of lies
In your evil dreams
Inside this masquerade of lies

Your piercing eye can't see
My sign of victory
Shackled to this world of lies
I will live while you die

Am I dreaming
Or is this for real?
I scream
Scars so deep
Impossible them to heal
I don`t want to be

In your evil dreams
Inside this masquerade of lies
In your evil dreams
Inside this masquerade of lies
