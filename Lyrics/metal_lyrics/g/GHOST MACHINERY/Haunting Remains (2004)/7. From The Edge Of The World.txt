Now I'm here
To set the record straight
I'll bring fear
I've rose above my fate

I plant my seeds
To the angry soil
You better believe
I am here to stay

Stages change
But I'll remain forever
Tormented souls I'll unfold
For everyone to see

Far beyond the time
There is powers in my reach
If you take me for a fool
Inner forces I'll unleash

You will pay the price
If you act against my will
Enforcer that's who I am
You're not slipping through my hands

Stages change
But I'll remain forever
Tormented souls I'll unfold
For everyone to see

(When you) see me
(When you) hear me
(When you) speak to me
You've reached the point of no return
(When you) when you feel me
(Then you're) too near me
(You only) fear me
I'm calling from the edge of the world!

Without my guidance
You will fall to your knees
So full of defiance
But still I do what I please

You will pay the price
If you act against my will
You got no control anymore
I'm the master to be

Stages change
But I'll remain forever
Tormented souls I'll unfold
For everyone to see

(When you) see me
(When you) hear me
(When you) speak to me
You've reached the point of no return
(When you) when you feel me
(Then you're) too near me
(You only) fear me
I'm calling from the edge of the world!
