[Music &amp; Lyrics: Pete Ahonen]

Safe and sound from the world around
Blood bound brothers just waiting to be found

Perfect strangers in this unknown land
We thought about rising but you hide your face in the sand

If you cut me out you'll lose the game
There's no returning, they remember your name

Deep inside in the heart of darkness
We will find the truth
We have seen the Mask of Madness
We believe, we've seen the truth

Lies on lies and you thought you had it all
Darkened skies will be witnessing your fall

I guess we knew you're not fit to last
You missed your cue and your time has passed

If you cut me out you'll lose the game
There's no returning, they remember your name

Deep inside in the heart of darkness
We will find the truth
We have seen the Mask of Madness
We believe, we've seen the truth

[Solo]

If you cut me out you'll lose the game
There's no returning, they remember your name

Deep inside in the heart of darkness
We will find the truth
We have seen the Mask of Madness
We believe, we've seen the truth

Deep inside in the heart of darkness
We will find the truth
We have seen the Mask of Madness
We believe, we've seen the truth
