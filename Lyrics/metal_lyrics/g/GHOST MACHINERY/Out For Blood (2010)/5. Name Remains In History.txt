[Music: Pete Ahonen, Lyrics: Pete Ahonen &amp; Taage Laiho]

In my lonely room I'm waiting for the gloom
I'm waiting for my guardian angel
To guide me to the light out from endless night
Cover me and be my savior

I confess my sins in the night
And shout my anguish to the sky

In this world that I am in, I'm a hero I'm the king
And forever my name will remain
In history

In my fantasy eyes deceiving me
The light is calling me to enter
Fighting for my dreams that are leading me
To the world where I'm the center

I confess my sins in the night
And shout my anguish to the sky

In this world that I am in, I'm a hero I'm the king
And forever my name will remain

In this world that I am in, I'm a hero I'm the king
And forever my name will remain
In history

The walls are crumbling
Have I lost my way?
The truth is fading
Shadows calling
Nothing left to say
I am falling

[Solo]

In this world that I am in, I'm a hero I'm the king
And forever my name will remain

In this world that I am in, I'm a hero I'm the king
And forever my name will remain
In history
