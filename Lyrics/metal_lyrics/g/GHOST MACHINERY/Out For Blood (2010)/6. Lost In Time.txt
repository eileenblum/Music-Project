[Music &amp; Lyrics: Pete Ahonen]

Needles to say I am lost
From the day one I'm paying the cost

Standing at the crossroad to nowhere
And the night descents over me

My soul is Lost in Time
So many ways I can't explain
Just try to find a way back home
My soul is Lost in Time
Attempts to rescue are in vain
Am I here to die all alone?

Face to face with the demons inside
Fighting back the tears I don't want to show that I've cried

Standing at the crossroad to nowhere
And the night descents over me

My soul is Lost in Time
So many ways I can't explain
Just try to find a way back home
My soul is Lost in Time
Attempts to rescue are in vain
Am I here to die all alone?

Unable to show the hurt inside of me
I locked it up and throw away the key

[Solo]

My soul is Lost in Time
So many ways I can't explain
Just try to find a way back home
My soul is Lost in Time
Attempts to rescue are in vain
Am I here to die all alone?

My soul is Lost in Time
So many ways I can't explain
Just try to find a way back home
My soul is Lost in Time
Attempts to rescue are in vain
Am I here to die all alone?
