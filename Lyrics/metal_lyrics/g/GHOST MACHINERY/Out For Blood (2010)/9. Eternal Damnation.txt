[Music: Pete Ahonen, Lyrics: Pete Ahonen &amp; Taage Laiho]

Only speak when spoken to
Keep it down or soon you will see my hatred
Rules of war are lost on me
Down by law and nothing's sacred

Don't forget all the things that you've said
Or pay the price with your head

High above in your lonely world
In your kingdom of fools
Bridges burning, the hell awaits
Eternal Damnation, Eternal Damnation

Actions mean and the heart is black
Keep it clean or soon you will feel my anger
I don't care and I turn my back
Unaware of the underlying danger

Don't forget all the things that you've said
Or pay the price with your head

High above in your lonely world
In your kingdom of fools
Bridges burning, the hell awaits
Eternal Damnation, Eternal Damnation

[Solo]

Don't forget all the things that you've said
Or pay the price with your head

High above in your lonely world
In your kingdom of fools
Bridges burning, the hell awaits
Eternal Damnation

High above in your lonely world
In your kingdom of fools
Bridges burning, the hell awaits
Eternal Damnation, Eternal Damnation
